1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Welcome to Podcasts that Ride the Second Gate,

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
with the only podcast where the indoor pool causes humidity

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
that just destroys our microphones constantly.

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm Jason Sheridan, joined by Scott Gardner.

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
And we insist on it though, because it has therapeutic value

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
and yeah, do we have to replace our equipment

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
over and over and over again?

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Yeah, does it stink? Yeah, but you know what?

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
That after show splashdown can't beat that.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Can't beat that, and A, the ceilings are just demolished

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
wherever we record.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
It's cheaper to demolish than repair.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Mike Carlson also here.

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Everywhere we go, we demolish.

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
That's the thing we literally and figuratively, I think.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Don't you think?

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
We're like the Ramones in a hotel room.

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Yeah, that's true, yeah.

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
That's anytime we've gone and traveled for a show,

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
we destroy the hotel rooms as well.

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
With humidity.

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Yeah, yeah.

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Bathrooms we demolish in a different way.

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm running like 10 different humidifiers

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
in a hotel room to trash it.

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
That's the way I do it.

28
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Turn the water, turn the bath all the way to hot,

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
and don't run the fan.

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The wallpaper starts peeling by the morning.

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I'm just a fucking chaos agent.

32
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Oh yeah, and you sleep terribly.

33
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I hate it.

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I hate it.

35
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I hate sleeping like that.

36
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
But you gotta do it.

37
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
But I'm like the fucking Ramones, baby.

38
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
You build a climate around yourself.

39
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Mikey Ramone, that's what they call me.

40
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
That's what I sign in under at a hotel

41
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
just to keep the listeners away also.

42
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
They're always bothering me.

43
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
So I do that for many reasons.

44
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
But anyway.

45
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Anyway, it's my birthday shot.

46
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
It's my birthday shot.

47
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
And today is actually my birthday.

48
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
This is coming out.

49
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
This is the first.

50
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
That's great.

51
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
It actually lines up.

52
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
That's wonderful.

53
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Well, happy birthday.

54
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Happy birthday to you.

55
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
And thank you to all the listeners for voting.

56
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
This was kind of a, I don't want to say a blowout.

57
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
But the topic.

58
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
It took an early lead and never really wavered.

59
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I agree, yes.

60
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
You did a poll.

61
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
You threw it to the listeners in a nice way.

62
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
It was nice of you to democratize your own birthday

63
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
to fraction off sections of your own mind and interests

64
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
and let the listeners pick the Jason they want.

65
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Yeah.

66
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
And they resoundingly picked Holodome.

67
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Holiday against Holodome.

68
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
My choice of law is like dead last again.

69
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
What was it?

70
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Generation X.

71
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Oh, OK.

72
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Yeah.

73
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
We'll get to it.

74
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Well, I was like, I think I would either.

75
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I'm curious to see what wins.

76
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'm rooting for either Holodome or Island Skipper Tours.

77
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Island Skipper Tours feels like a second gate any time.

78
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I mean, it's a theme park mode of transit.

79
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
You don't have to justify it to me.

80
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Yeah.

81
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
So, but Holodome had just been a recent obsession.

82
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I don't think I knew about it.

83
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Really?

84
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Until a few months ago.

85
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
This has just been something you've been thinking about.

86
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I've been thinking about and was reading about it.

87
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
But this was apparently, you know, this was all over the place.

88
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Uh-huh.

89
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,000
And this is, so the basic premise here, we know holiday ends.

90
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
There are holiday ends.

91
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
This is a chain that we know and trust and love, maybe.

92
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Probably not.

93
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I feel like there was a time where this was a chain that people liked of hotels.

94
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
But some are fine, I'm sure.

95
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
But the idea being that there's a little bit more.

96
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
This isn't just a hotel.

97
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
This is a place where you can stay and play.

98
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Yeah, well, it was one of the first big chains to every location has a swimming pool.

99
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
And this was, yeah, I guess you take for granted that this was not the case.

100
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Yeah.

101
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
With hotels, that hotels were miserable and plain.

102
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
You were lucky if there were sheets on the bed.

103
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
You didn't have to bring your own.

104
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Yeah.

105
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
This is fine.

106
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,000
You are here for your meeting and then you get out of town and you don't travel with your family.

107
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
No.

108
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
This is for business only.

109
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Women weren't allowed to travel until the late 50s.

110
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Yeah, yeah.

111
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Yeah.

112
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Look, I saw Carol, you know.

113
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
You saw what?

114
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I saw Carol.

115
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
You saw Carol.

116
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Oh, the movie Carol.

117
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Yeah, the movie Carol.

118
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Oh, I don't know what the movie, what is the, whatever's in there.

119
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
They kind of go on.

120
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,000
It's like a woman falls in love with a woman who works at an apartment store and they go on the run for a little while.

121
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Ah, okay.

122
00:04:51,000 --> 00:05:00,000
But yeah, so the Holiday Inn opens, you know, and they start franchising.

123
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:11,000
And some local franchisers, franchisees in North Dakota are like for eight or nine months of the year, the pool is useless.

124
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
So they build in like an atrium sort of thing.

125
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
They enclose it.

126
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Yes.

127
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
And then they extend that.

128
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
A corporate sees how well it's doing and extends it.

129
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Seemingly nationwide.

130
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I truly thought initially this was like a proof of concept thing.

131
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
But they were everywhere.

132
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
And what defines a holiday?

133
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
If you, if then on the corporate level, this becomes the thing that they roll out.

134
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,000
What are we expecting as guests when we see, oh, this is no mere Holiday Inn.

135
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
This is a holodome.

136
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Well, here's a post.

137
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
There's some postcards that are pretty well preserved.

138
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
So this is an indoor pool.

139
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,000
There's a tiki bar, some mini golf or putting greens.

140
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Some of the others I saw video at pool tables and later on video arcades shuffleboard.

141
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Yeah, there's pool tables in that, in that image.

142
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I have that pulled up as well.

143
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
It's really funny because they're just kind of hanging out in this big open space.

144
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I know you always think of pool tables in a small, like a smaller room.

145
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:22,000
It's you don't, you don't expect pool tables, I guess, to have so much ceiling.

146
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Yes, exactly.

147
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
So much narrower spaces is what you expect.

148
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Your pool halls.

149
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Yes.

150
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
A big pool, a big pool.

151
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
A pool, I don't know.

152
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
A swimming pool.

153
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
A big swimming pool.

154
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
And then two pool tables nearby with shirtless people.

155
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Shirtless people or I guess there's a lady playing.

156
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Here's another one.

157
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
This is also South Dakota.

158
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Yeah, and there's pool tables there in a big open space as well.

159
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
And skylights.

160
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
That was a big feature on some of these.

161
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Some of them let you see natural light.

162
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Yeah, and that apparently let moonlight in at night is very nice.

163
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
There was inner lighting.

164
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
And you could swim all year round.

165
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
You could swim all year round.

166
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:10,000
That's the idea here, which I will say as a kid, this was so exciting to me growing up in the chilly Midwest during the fall and winter seasons.

167
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
The idea that, oh my gosh, we could go and swim in the winter.

168
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:26,000
And yes, and that is, are you talking about in Illinois that there are indoor, like, are you picturing like vacations close-ish to home?

169
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Or I know the Wisconsin Dells loom large in your childhood.

170
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Yes, there was indoor pools there.

171
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
And I forget there was a nearby hotel that I don't forget.

172
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I don't think we stayed at there.

173
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
There was some reason we used the pool.

174
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
But there was, I forget, maybe I was 10 or 11 or 12.

175
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:50,000
At the park, the local park district, they did a big renovation on the local pool and they made it.

176
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,000
It used to be outdoors and they put a big, I don't know, it wasn't a dome, but a building over it.

177
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
And they certainly changed the name to Waterworks.

178
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:04,000
And then they put in a pool with a hologram on mist at the bottom of it, which was very unremarkable.

179
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
We used to make fun of it all the time.

180
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
But you could go picture of that work.

181
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
It was just like Barbosa or.

182
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
But they do tell tales in the Pirates of the Caribbean, but much worse.

183
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
And you couldn't tell what it was.

184
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Oh, OK. You couldn't.

185
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
But it was it was making no sound because it's under the water.

186
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
No, there's no fun.

187
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,000
But it was just yeah, there was just like it was misting at the end of the slide and there was a projection on it.

188
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
And they would change it and we could never tell what it was.

189
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
So we would make jokes about it.

190
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
But it was you could go swimming all year round.

191
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
And it was very exciting.

192
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I do love the sound of that because I like I wish that there were more because I'd want to talk about them all the time on this show.

193
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I wish that there were more water slides with plots.

194
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Sure. Yeah. Like Dr. Von Dark.

195
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Yeah. Yeah.

196
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Dr. Von Dark.

197
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Raging Waters.

198
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:59,000
And I. Oh, well, that's just for the listener, because I you know, there's no way to like that's a that's too big of an area to canvas.

199
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
If you've been on a water slide with a plot that we don't know about.

200
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Yeah. Yeah.

201
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
There's one close to you.

202
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Please let us know.

203
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Because water water slides with plots, I think, is completely an episode.

204
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I agree. Yeah.

205
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,000
There's the Typhoon Lagoon one that's connected to see.

206
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Yes. Yeah.

207
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Yeah. Sure. Yeah. Yeah.

208
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
But, you know, it's a little showy, right?

209
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Like I want the I want the I want the raging waters of the world to do it.

210
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
You know, the places with no money.

211
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Yeah. Yeah.

212
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
And at it for good.

213
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
And because that's going to stand out a lot.

214
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:39,000
If you're a place with 15 slides and only one of them has a story and what the hell is at your disposal.

215
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Yeah.

216
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:46,000
To create a story, I guess just missed walls, but those are broken through right away and you probably don't know what you're looking at.

217
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:55,000
And what possibly could like, I guess, like what what could a slide be that works as a store?

218
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Like it is. Is it just like an evil guy putting you down a pipe?

219
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Like, yeah, I mean, there's a viable story.

220
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
You got. God, I'm so sorry.

221
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,000
But like an animal shits you out like you're shooting out of an anus or something.

222
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
And I'm sorry, but that's what I was going to say.

223
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Yeah, I know.

224
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
And I said it with a poll like apologetic tone in my voice.

225
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
You're like in King Kong's.

226
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
His body. Yeah.

227
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Yeah. It's lower intestine.

228
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
And you come out of his butt.

229
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Yeah.

230
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Shoot out the.

231
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
He's having diarrhea.

232
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Well, yeah.

233
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I mean, that's the, you know, you're coming up with what it would be.

234
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:37,000
But I think the water park is not going to want to associate themselves with diarrhea and monkey colon.

235
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,000
So do you have to does the thing have to be like a cleanse?

236
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Forgive me. I don't know.

237
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Like more words for when you just like wash it all out like an enema.

238
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Yeah. Yeah.

239
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
And those are two different things.

240
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,000
So so King Kong's enema could be the name of a of a water slide.

241
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Yeah, that's yeah, that's good because it makes a lot of sense.

242
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Because what you do with an enema is you shoot water up there and then it kind of like you hold it in for a while.

243
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
And then it all comes out very fast because it's water.

244
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
So you're trying to get everything out.

245
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
So that's the rapid speed of a water slide.

246
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
It makes sense.

247
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:18,000
This is a great slide that you would show that you you get a launch at the beginning.

248
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I feel like there's slides that do that.

249
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Shoot shoot up in your king Kong's but all.

250
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Oh, you go up and then slide.

251
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
How you doing? How you going up on a water slide?

252
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
There's no there's a ways to do that.

253
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I mean, like, you know, I mean, maybe you got to slide down.

254
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
You got to do a ramp down and then jets shoot you back up.

255
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
OK, yeah, yeah, like that rides that shoot you back up.

256
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
That's true. Yeah. Yeah.

257
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I was thinking of more of like a regular human in a slide, but maybe I'm not thinking of one.

258
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
There's the ones that like are the top very tall and then they like the thing opens up.

259
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
The floor apparently drops out essentially and you shoot.

260
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Oh, sure. So there's those that could be if you're taking if King Kong is taking a supplement.

261
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
It's his throat opening up.

262
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:05,000
There's a lot of anyway, the entire water park that is going through all of various parts of King Kong's body.

263
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Oh, my God. I got piss. You got butt.

264
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
You got pissing. You got butt.

265
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Yeah. You're same category. I realize.

266
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
That's right. Yes. And but both of them together.

267
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Anyway, all right.

268
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
It is. Those are free for you.

269
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Yeah. Thank you. Water slides.

270
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Were there water slides in these? Or is that like to 67 later of the thing?

271
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Yeah, that comes later.

272
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:33,000
This all reminded me of a there was an inclusive resort in the Poconos where my family went to a few times called Mountain Laurel.

273
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
And they had a big indoor pool.

274
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:42,000
And then they had a restaurant and they had like a kids club where like mom and dad could drop me for a couple hours.

275
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
And then they go do stuff and hiking trails.

276
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I think a lot of the Pocono resorts eventually also started expanding not just indoor pools, but indoor water parks, which I think the technology got better.

277
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
The filtrate like the air filters got better.

278
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Yeah. And so I think that and then reading about this holodome, there's a story at the Globe and Mail, the Canadian paper.

279
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:22,000
And they mention in the 1970s, Aldean built a number of these leisure oriented hotels marketed towards families, but with amenities that would appeal to grownups as well as kids.

280
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Early versions of fun places similar to the Great Wolf Lodge Water Park Resort in Niagara Falls.

281
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:39,000
So I think that's why I was when we started doing Great Wolf Lodge, I was like, this place looks cool because I was like, oh,

282
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,000
it reminds me of this Poconos Hotel where you just stayed in the hotel the whole time.

283
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Right. And clearly this idea did work for a while.

284
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
You're more you were more in on it maybe than certainly I.

285
00:13:52,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I by the end of the episode that we did, I was like, no, I was even teetering on like fascination with it.

286
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
And by the time we were through talking about it, that's OK.

287
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,000
But you were more like aesthetically, you wrap your head around like this enclosed space.

288
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Well, with a lot of pool must.

289
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Because I think what I was thinking was more like what turned out to be the holodombs, which is like seems to be geared mostly to adults.

290
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
But there's stuff for kids. Sure.

291
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:31,000
And they also made an effort of like, have your business conference here, have your class reunion or prom or wedding here.

292
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:41,000
You know, it's interesting you're coming at it from this Poconos perspective because I I did like I'm fascinated by these when it when we landed on holodombs.

293
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I'm like, that's cool because aesthetically great.

294
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
These postcards look cool. I like that.

295
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:57,000
You know, the few remaining ones, the stragglers like have an inherent kind of 70s feel and indoor rock fountains and it's ended in the tiki nature of it.

296
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
So like aesthetically, I'm into holodombs.

297
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:08,000
But then I think about if I had to stay at one and I look at Great Wolf Lodge and I find Great Wolf Lodge kind of depressing from a distance.

298
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:15,000
And that's Great Wolf Lodge where the where the water parks are huge and there's, you know, stories and Dunkin Donuts and what have you.

299
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
These I kind of wonder maybe it depends on the month.

300
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Maybe it depends. I just wonder if you in a holodombs would start to feel a tad trapped, but I don't think you would.

301
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I don't know. I mean, here someone did a medium post.

302
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
This is one of Perrysburg, Ohio.

303
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,000
That was unfortunately demolished a couple of years ago, but they like kept it up.

304
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I saw this this post you're showing and that the floor in the with the tile floor, the base tile floor that you showed that looks so much like the early iteration of one of my local malls, the Fallbrook Mall.

305
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I forget if it was Fallbrook Square at the time.

306
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,000
So I'm fond of this atrium space because it reminds me so much of the Fallbrook Mall.

307
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:04,000
The way that Discovery Zone added that was one of its claims to fame.

308
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,000
But the but I also am like that was one of the first malls to go.

309
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
That didn't survive till the late 90s.

310
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I don't think. Oh, yeah.

311
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I'm like, I would I love to go there for an hour today.

312
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
The original Fallbrook Mall.

313
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Absolutely. Would I want to stay there for four days?

314
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I'm not so sure.

315
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,000
You wouldn't want to stay in one of these rooms overlooking the kind of corner pool.

316
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
This with this one, it depends on indoor outdoor.

317
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I guess that's a choice you have has an indoor outdoor pool, which I never stayed at a place like that.

318
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Another idea I loved.

319
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I love twice.

320
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Yeah, that does seem terrifying to me.

321
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Swim under the wall.

322
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
No, no, no, no, no, no.

323
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Amazing. Really? If you've never surprised because I liked doing it.

324
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
But I thought of it as a challenge.

325
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Like, here's my little Olympic event.

326
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
But I would but I would think that would fit into one of the things you would be afraid of.

327
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Your mom would make you afraid.

328
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Maybe she would have been close attention.

329
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
We swam a lot, actually.

330
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I took a lot of swim lessons.

331
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
So I think I was pretty comfortable in the pool.

332
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
So that really never I don't think was a big fear.

333
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I just thought it was cool.

334
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I had fears about diving boards and stuff.

335
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
But, you know, I think I just was like, this is cool.

336
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,000
It really felt like such a gauntlet where I like there was still part of me.

337
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I didn't believe in myself so much.

338
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Like, I thought, like, you know, I might do it, but also I might slam up.

339
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:41,000
My back might just like hit that divider wall, lightly paralyze me for several months.

340
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I don't know if they keep spikes on that thing, if they're trying to keep intruders at like it's the main way that robbers sneak in via the indoor outdoor pool.

341
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I think I found the Mary out by the O'Hare airport in Rosemont, which we would just sometimes buy like a day pass and go to the pool.

342
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I believe it looks like they still have it.

343
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
This looks like I think this is exactly what they had when I was a kid.

344
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
That's pretty beautiful.

345
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
This is a shimmering place.

346
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Yeah, it looks much better than my memory of it.

347
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Maybe they've they've updated it or this is like a Photoshop thing.

348
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
But yeah, you can see you can go under that bridge.

349
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
It's an impressive dome there.

350
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Yeah.

351
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
So yeah, we would.

352
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Okay, here's a more realistic photo.

353
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Okay, that's a tad more drab, but I feel like I have a fun time there.

354
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Sure. Yeah.

355
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
But yeah, I remember going like under that wall was really cool.

356
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
That was the bravest thing.

357
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Yeah.

358
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Maybe it was the bravest thing.

359
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I forgot about this.

360
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:42,000
The executive floor lounge at this holodome looks like.

361
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Oh, yes.

362
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I would love to be there.

363
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:50,000
This looks like Sydney Lumet's crazy apartment and I switch.

364
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
It totally does.

365
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Yeah.

366
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
It's very like the lamps are very network also.

367
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Yes.

368
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Yeah.

369
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
You're right. Sinister deals are happening.

370
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:09,000
You know, like, you know, corporations are being traded and merged in there and perhaps people are being traded and sold on this room.

371
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Possible.

372
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Jim Cavieza will make a movie about it.

373
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:18,000
That does look like a room where suddenly the walls would get shot up.

374
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Like one wall explodes all of a sudden.

375
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Like, where are the girls?

376
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Yeah.

377
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Show me the girls.

378
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I don't know if we can look up holodome stories if that existed.

379
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
They can fabricate it if they want to.

380
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Interesting discovery on friends of this podcast.

381
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I learned Eva Anderson texted me and she's like, my family, when we moved to Washington state, they lived in a holodome for a week.

382
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Wow.

383
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
She.

384
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Wow. That's weird.

385
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Yeah, I think like wherever they were moving was still getting ready.

386
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:03,000
She said the it was very echoey and mildewy.

387
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Yeah.

388
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
The mildew would become a problem everywhere.

389
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Seemingly.

390
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Sure.

391
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:15,000
She said her parents started saying kids use your holodome voice.

392
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
And I said, what is a holodome voice?

393
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
And she's like, it's just inside voice.

394
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Because again, it was so echoey in there.

395
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,000
The soundscapes don't seem ideal in these giant open rooms.

396
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:35,000
That's such a good like parents having doing the job of parents, but also doing bits for each other, like making each other.

397
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Right.

398
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
That's delightful.

399
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
It's so funny.

400
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:46,000
She says she believes it was in Eugene work on it had been buried in her memory until I mentioned it.

401
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:56,000
She said she the other detail she mentions, which I think is my favorite, the screen doors were always wet.

402
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
From the roof to each room.

403
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
From the humidity, I think.

404
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
So each room had a screen door.

405
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Well, I think if you were staying in a room that looked out onto the deck, like you.

406
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Oh, so yeah, you would open it.

407
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
You open the sliding door, you open the screen door and then you can walk right out.

408
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,000
You get the chlorine smell stronger in your room because it would go through the screen.

409
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:22,000
What I'm a little disturbed by is that I feel like this aspect of it doesn't deter you, Jason.

410
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
I think you like the witness.

411
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Well, Jason and I are both humidity guys.

412
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Yeah, we're humidity guys.

413
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
As addressed at the beginning of the episode.

414
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Yes.

415
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Yeah. Chicago area and Philadelphia area certainly are humid places when the weather warms up.

416
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,000
It's a little humid lately here in Los Angeles.

417
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
We have got humidity in LA.

418
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:56,000
It has happened a little and there's something, I like the novelty of it a little that like on this day and if I'm in this place, like, oh, this is oddly a little Hawaii or a little Florida, but a little bit goes a long way.

419
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
A little bit goes a long way and I don't love the mosquitoes that come with it.

420
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Well, the mosquitoes a whole, I can do a whole podcast about that.

421
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
If you're not here, oh boy.

422
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
It's been.

423
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I'm doing a whole mosquito dunk thing in the backyard with buckets of water.

424
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
The mosquitoes are so bad they're out at 3pm.

425
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
It's ridiculous.

426
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I know. Can't enjoy the unbelievable.

427
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I need a holodome now. I need a holodome in my house.

428
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:27,000
I complain as I like listeners, possibly in places where it is, there are always mosquitoes.

429
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
It's way worse.

430
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,000
When when LA is not perfect right now.

431
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:37,000
I used to practice soccer by little like swampy places and then the mosquitoes would just like eat you up.

432
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
It was crazy.

433
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
And then I got out here.

434
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I was like, now this is the life.

435
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
And all of a sudden these fucking mosquitoes came back.

436
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Climate change, baby.

437
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Great.

438
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
We're all we're all shuffling.

439
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Well, we all get to experience different ecosystems.

440
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
That's right.

441
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Yeah. The holodome where there are mosquitoes in every holodome.

442
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,000
The answer will be ultimately to build a giant holodome for everyone to live.

443
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Yeah, that's true.

444
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
The only need was just they.

445
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Yeah. They just need to be bigger.

446
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:08,000
The domes need to be bigger and the the pool tables need to be bigger.

447
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Not more.

448
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Giant pool tables.

449
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Right. Bigger pool tables.

450
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
And everyone can play.

451
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:22,000
But thankfully, due to the American collective memory being so short, they are not going to remember to fix the roofs.

452
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
No, probably not.

453
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Or filter the air.

454
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Don't filter the air. Yeah.

455
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
We'll fix it.

456
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
If it becomes a problem and then it becomes a problem within three months.

457
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
One of the reasons the holodomes caught on.

458
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:45,000
I mean, this sort of traveling like you go and mom and dad can get drink, get drunk and the kids can just run around the pool.

459
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
They can get drinks.

460
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I love that.

461
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
We can have play.

462
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:53,000
They can eat over cooked prime rib dinners.

463
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
You know, this was definitely a product of its time.

464
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:02,000
But a thing that helped them out was the gas crisis in the 70s.

465
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:07,000
So people were traveling less far for vacations.

466
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Yeah. So they were doing like a staycation.

467
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Almost like a staycation or maybe you're driving half an hour away instead of two hours away.

468
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
You ever hear about this?

469
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Like, I don't doubt that this gas crisis was crazy.

470
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Did you ever think about that gas crisis in light of, you know, how the last three and a half years have been for us?

471
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,000
And you've been complaining about the gas crisis.

472
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
That was your big thing.

473
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Oh, yeah.

474
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Big line at the door.

475
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Yeah. Well, as for us, all of all of our lives and time were rearranged and shattered.

476
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Yeah.

477
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
It's a good point.

478
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
It's a good point.

479
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,000
If you want to compare the two crises together, what was worse?

480
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:55,000
It really threw a wrench into the lives of the characters of licorice pizza.

481
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
The waterbed business.

482
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
It was their COVID.

483
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
The leaning for gas for their trucks.

484
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
That's right. Yeah.

485
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:07,000
It made it tougher for brief cameo John C. Reilly as Herman Munster to make it to the autograph show.

486
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
That's right.

487
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Yeah.

488
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
That's so.

489
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:19,000
And even briefer seemingly also brief cameo from Oscar winner Bradley Cooper.

490
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Did he win supporting for that?

491
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Two scenes.

492
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
No, I don't for that.

493
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Was he nominated?

494
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
No, for did he win for like the Lady Gaga movie?

495
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Is that what you're asking?

496
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
No, no, wasn't he?

497
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
He's not saying he won for liquor pizza.

498
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
He's saying did he win for a different role?

499
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
But wasn't he nominated for licorice pizza?

500
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
No, I don't think so.

501
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
He should have been.

502
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
He was great, but I don't think he was.

503
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
I don't think that's.

504
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Well, we're going to take a second here.

505
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Correct.

506
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
He's in a good deal longer than.

507
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
He's in like four scenes or something.

508
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Herman Munster is much longer than Herman.

509
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
That's true.

510
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Oh, it's just like a one line or something and then he goes by.

511
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,000
I feel like liquor pizza didn't get a lot of Academy Award.

512
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
No, I don't think so.

513
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
I don't think.

514
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Picture screenplay director, noms, no other noms.

515
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
No noms.

516
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
No noms.

517
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
No noms for Brad.

518
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Sorry, Brad.

519
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
You're going to have to put on a big nose to get your noms.

520
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Get your next noms.

521
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Are you thinking when they were trying to get him nominated as Rocket?

522
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Remember that was a big push to nominate like 10 actors from the Avengers?

523
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Oh, I forgot about that.

524
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
I might just be thinking of the pushes.

525
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
The what?

526
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,000
The pushes for a nomination.

527
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Oh, you should get a nomination for such and such.

528
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
I didn't remember.

529
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Why are we talking about this for so long?

530
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
I don't remember a push for it.

531
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Where we don't have all the facts and aren't prepared to talk about it.

532
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
He was great.

533
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
He's so funny in the movie.

534
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
He's hilarious.

535
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
We talk about the John Peters giant spider story.

536
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
OK, and everyone's heard that six ways to Sunday.

537
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Well, they put the giant spider in the flash.

538
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:59,000
I watched all the flash the other day and the flash is not as bad as everyone says the flash is.

539
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
It fucking is.

540
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
The first half of flash is.

541
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,000
I'm going to be back away from the mic and raise my voice.

542
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:12,000
The first half of the flash is like pretty watchable and the second half is not very good.

543
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,000
I'll say why it's not watchable because of Ezra Miller from line one.

544
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Here's what I would say.

545
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:23,000
I think that Ezra doesn't know that they don't have the character of the flash down at all.

546
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
They don't know what they're doing exactly.

547
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Then there's two flashes and then I found the interplay between the flashes.

548
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
And there's a couple of other people that have agreed with me that you would have respect on some level.

549
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
I don't have to say them because I'm saying my own opinion here.

550
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
I found those names fine.

551
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Who thought that was good?

552
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Who do we know?

553
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Lindsay agreed with me and Susser agreed with me.

554
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
And then the second half of the movie is just gloopy CGI.

555
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Were they both on nice drugs that were enhancing their feelings about everything?

556
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Neither of them are drug takers.

557
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Please don't fight on my birthday.

558
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
It was.

559
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
I'm not saying this is a great movie.

560
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,000
The double Ezra is one of the worst things I've ever seen in a movie.

561
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
There's some fun stuff in the double Ezra, I think.

562
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:15,000
And I am not a big fan of the character in the other stuff or the first part of the movie or the rest of the movie.

563
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
But there is some stuff when they're interacting that I enjoyed.

564
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Meet Ezra number one. Very annoying. Meet Ezra number two. Annoying and dumb.

565
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Now watch the interplay.

566
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:31,000
It ended up working better than just the regular Flash character that Ezra was playing.

567
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
That's what I think.

568
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Is it the first movie I'd seen in months? Yes.

569
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
I'm not saying that's why.

570
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
I guess what I liked is that it was a movie.

571
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
I like the baby scene. I like the baby scene too.

572
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
I think the baby scene is good.

573
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,000
I watched it forwards and backwards. I liked it.

574
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
I'm not fond of it.

575
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
I think it was funny.

576
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Jason's opinion wins because it's his birthday. Overruled.

577
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
I'm fine. I'm fine.

578
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,000
You have to, Jason, you weigh in in the future.

579
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,000
I demand that you watch this film.

580
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
You have to watch Flash. We're doing a Flash episode.

581
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,000
No. Not an episode. I just want to know.

582
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,000
You need to see some interplay. Flash saga.

583
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Think about what you just heard your friend say.

584
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Scene by scene breakdown.

585
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:21,000
I mean we have to get ready for creature commandos and all the other D-list characters that are coming.

586
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
You gotta get Flash. You gotta see Flash first.

587
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Okay. Here's something I do actually think is fun.

588
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Play school. You all know play school.

589
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
I do know play school. Yeah.

590
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Play school had a line.

591
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Are they little eggs? The eggs?

592
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Yeah. Kind of egg shaped.

593
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Play school had a line called familiar places in the 70s.

594
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Really?

595
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
They sold a holiday in place.

596
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Wow. Holy shit. This is awesome.

597
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
You can find this on eBay.

598
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
That's cool.

599
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
I found an eBay seller just selling the sign.

600
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Which is what I really, I just want the sign.

601
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Yeah.

602
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Well do they have like a, can I see the big picture again?

603
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
I wanted to see if, is there a pool in there as well?

604
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Yeah. There's a pool. It's got the courtyard layout. It's not, it's like half holodome.

605
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Wow.

606
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
A lot of early holidays.

607
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Do you consider it a holodome? Well there's a slide I guess and a swing.

608
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
I guess that makes it a holodome.

609
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Yeah.

610
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
A lot of them had the pools in the courtyard.

611
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Yeah.

612
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Yeah. I, but I just think that's fun.

613
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:28,000
I mean it's a little sinister to teach children about a brand when they barely know object permanents.

614
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
But are not all toys brands.

615
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
That's true.

616
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:36,000
You know, they're trying to grab you at least in one way, if not multiple.

617
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:41,000
This one in Cincinnati, this holodome was called the Solar Dome Fun Center.

618
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
I think there were a few solar domes.

619
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Yeah.

620
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:54,000
That was common-ish. Why? Because you can enjoy the sun, some of the sunlight is trapped inside the dome.

621
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Yeah. Do we know like dome, just like when people get dome crazy?

622
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Because like it seems like 70s, 80s dome were very popular.

623
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Biodomes.

624
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Well, bio, yeah, biodomes. Yeah. I don't know when that word came into fruit.

625
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:14,000
I don't know. I guess, or Cinerama Dome.

626
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Yeah, well that's early then.

627
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
When were domes able to be built?

628
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Yeah.

629
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,000
People probably went dome crazy when domes could be made.

630
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Technodrone is a different thing, not a dome.

631
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
No.

632
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
But sometimes I feel like people have called it the Technodome.

633
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
They're incorrect.

634
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
But they're wrong.

635
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:37,000
That makes me mad if you call Crane's ship the wrong thing.

636
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:52,000
One historian from the, it's a very funny name, University of Southern Mississippi Center for Oral History and Cultural Heritage, Ross Walton, says they were originally called Fun Domes.

637
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Okay.

638
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:59,000
They had to go, they went to this person for this quote. The quote is shorter than the credit.

639
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Fun domes.

640
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,000
The quote is shorter than his title.

641
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:09,000
All right. So they were once called Fun Domes. Anyway, make sure you say my full name and profession and place of work.

642
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Because you needed to know he was like a reputable source before.

643
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Yeah.

644
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Fun Dome.

645
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:26,000
He goes on, a lot of franchise owners had U-shaped buildings, a pool in the middle, two partners in Kansas City who had holiday inns, came up with the idea of enclosing the courtyard.

646
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Okay.

647
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
So everyone's kind of experimenting with this stuff.

648
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:35,000
You have some of these facts and it just like, you're just like very like, it almost feels like you're an authority.

649
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:40,000
You almost seem like you're embodying the man who like is saying them in a lot of ways.

650
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Oh, okay.

651
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
That's when I thought of enclosing the courtyard.

652
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Well, thank you.

653
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Yes, you're an old businessman.

654
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Yeah.

655
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:56,000
I have an issue with these things I would say, because I like the name when I heard it.

656
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,000
I feel like, I think I first heard of this as a second gate suggestion.

657
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,000
I think we threw out what's fun second gate stuff and I never heard that word, Hall of Dome.

658
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
That's weird.

659
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
So were they like mini theme parks?

660
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
And the answer is like, well, not quite.

661
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,000
It's if you consider shuffleboard, sort of.

662
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
I don't know.

663
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Tiki bar is a themed thing.

664
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,000
But then I'm looking up like, what do they look like?

665
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
And I am imagining domes.

666
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
I know.

667
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
These aren't really domes.

668
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
I'm a little let down by the name.

669
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
They're enclosed, it's atriums.

670
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,000
And I like that they called them holodomes.

671
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
But the name is not necessarily accurate.

672
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:38,000
And I felt like I was disappointed to discover that it's not low modest hotel and then next to it is a big weird dome.

673
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Like circus has.

674
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Because like the Astrodome was at least, there was a dome on the top.

675
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
It's a dome.

676
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,000
It's not fully as like dome like as I would want it to be, I don't think.

677
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
But yeah, this is not not really living up to it.

678
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Was there anything that any of them that were close to being a dome, which I just it's like a half sphere, essentially.

679
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Yeah.

680
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Right.

681
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:05,000
I think I think I also think that was Astrodome slander.

682
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
I'm looking at the Astrodome.

683
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
How much more of a dome can this be?

684
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Well, it could be more completely like half sphere.

685
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,000
You know what I mean? The top is for certain part of a sphere.

686
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
You're right. It goes flat at some point.

687
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,000
But I have to say I'm satisfied by the amount of dome that the Astrodome was.

688
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Yeah, I'm and you're speaking ill of the day.

689
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
All right. Well, I apologize to the Astrodome.

690
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
It does have a part.

691
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Are you happy with this amount of dome, Jason, on the Astrodome?

692
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
I would say that's a sizeable dome.

693
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,000
A dome feels like the second half of the spheres underground.

694
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
You know what I mean?

695
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Like that in my kid brain, that's more what it is.

696
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,000
How many domes are actually 100 percent domes?

697
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Not many.

698
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
What is circus circus even like dome wise?

699
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Adventure dome.

700
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,000
I think at some point you're getting a flat wall.

701
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,000
I think that makes more sense as far as a building is concerned.

702
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:57,000
But it's a waste of space because as you start getting down to the end,

703
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:02,000
right, right, like towards the wall, you're going to end up with like just a foot of space, you know?

704
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
So what do you put over there?

705
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
That's a good point.

706
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
But some plants maybe.

707
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:11,000
But besides that, you're losing parking spaces.

708
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Yeah, this adventure.

709
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Yeah, this is not a true.

710
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
This is even a full.

711
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,000
I don't know. There's a couple of problems I have with the adventure dome exterior.

712
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:24,000
I think you probably have a lot of problems with the interior as well.

713
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Well, I don't know.

714
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
The adventure dome leaves a lot to be desired.

715
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Yeah.

716
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
The Cinerama dome, kind of a dome dome.

717
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Cinerama dome to me feels closer to what I'm talking about, what I want with it.

718
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
That isn't open.

719
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Nobody's bought that, right?

720
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Is that just sitting there?

721
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
I thought someone bought it.

722
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
I think I've said this on the show before.

723
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
There's no movement on that.

724
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
I know the Vista's going to open soon.

725
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:53,000
There's a few historic movie theaters in Los Angeles that are still crawling to reopen.

726
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Yeah.

727
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Can we do an episode about the Cinerama dome?

728
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:06,000
And I'll tell you why I say this, because in Googling pictures of it, you see different weird things happening to it, like Spider-Man bursting out of it.

729
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Yes, right.

730
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Oh, yeah, Godzilla.

731
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Godzilla.

732
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
I didn't know about that.

733
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
I'm looking at a photo of that.

734
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,000
The 98 Godzilla shooting out of the center.

735
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
The 98 one?

736
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
The best one.

737
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Maybe not.

738
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
I don't know.

739
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
That's what it looks like to me.

740
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
No, because it's got a 24-hour fitness.

741
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
I think it's newer.

742
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
I think it's newer, yeah.

743
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,000
That was the boring one, the Brank Cranston boring one.

744
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Yes.

745
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
I'm sorry if you liked that movie, but that's what I'm going to say.

746
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
I actually liked all of those.

747
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Sorry.

748
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Okay.

749
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
I didn't even see all of it.

750
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,000
I didn't hate the movie, so it was boring.

751
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:39,000
But yeah, so stuff that happened to the Cinerama dome.

752
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
I don't want to detract from the sphere.

753
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,000
I know the sphere is going to have to get the attention sooner than later.

754
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:49,000
But when we feel speared out, if that ever happens, maybe we can feel domed.

755
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
I don't see it happening.

756
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Head to the dome.

757
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Anyway, so we've got to get this place back open.

758
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
No, Cinerama dome is closest.

759
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Cinerama dome is close.

760
00:36:54,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Let me say, though, also when I heard the name Holodome for the first time, there's

761
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,000
kind of an odd, there's sort of an evil air to it.

762
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Like you, you know, I just did, I don't know when it's coming up, but I was on

763
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Talking Simpsons, friends of the show, and we covered the Simpsons episode where

764
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,000
they go to Epcot or F cot in it.

765
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:24,000
And they and there's this whole thing about Eastern Airlines taking over the

766
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
world and turning it into a dystopia.

767
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,000
And there's big, crazy cyborgs with airplane heads.

768
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
And I hear Holodome.

769
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Holodome.

770
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
It doesn't.

771
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Does it not sound like somewhere like the Holodome kind of sounds like somewhere

772
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:42,000
that the Holiday Inn would like round up their enemies and execute them?

773
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
You know, it's like a bill.

774
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Well, Thunderdome.

775
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Yes, exactly.

776
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
What makes that?

777
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Yeah, there's a sinister dome.

778
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Yes.

779
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Yes.

780
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Yeah.

781
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,000
In the Holodome, anyone who is dared to stay in a dome to be a regular at a Hilton

782
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,000
or a Sheridan will be punished for their crimes against the superior brand.

783
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Yeah.

784
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Yeah.

785
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:03,000
It feels like it's going to be Lord of the Flies or it's going to be some sort of

786
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
most dangerous game situation.

787
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:09,000
But you're going to have to fight your way out or some kind of future sport.

788
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:16,000
100 families, 100 families fight each other to see who can escape the Holodome.

789
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Yeah.

790
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Sawed off pool cues or shuffleboard cues.

791
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Don't know what those are.

792
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Sticks.

793
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
I love shuffleboard.

794
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
I haven't played it in a long time.

795
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
I've never played shuffleboard.

796
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,000
I haven't played it proper.

797
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:37,000
I was flashing to the place that I've been staying around Disneyland with the family

798
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,000
has a games floor like this.

799
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
It's open air.

800
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
It's up on the roof.

801
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,000
And I've started to really look forward to grabbing coffee in the morning, taking the

802
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,000
kid up there, giving Aaron a break.

803
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:55,000
And then he's too young to play anything, but we screw around with the shuffleboard,

804
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:59,000
the foosball, with the basket ball, with the ping pong.

805
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Just like, let's just feel all these objects and see how they work and make a mess and

806
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
then clean it up.

807
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Is anyone up there?

808
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
No, never.

809
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Yeah.

810
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:11,000
This is not used at all, which you got to wonder, did that start to happen here?

811
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Did people like, I'm sure when these were new, they were hopping.

812
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,000
But I wonder if like it started to book.

813
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,000
I wonder if like the actual game started to deteriorate and they don't have the money

814
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
to fix.

815
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:27,000
I bet some of these, the game areas, I bet got into some sorry states.

816
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Well, yeah, I think that happened.

817
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
A few things happened.

818
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,000
One, airfare became much cheaper.

819
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
So people started traveling.

820
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Get the fuck out of these holodomes.

821
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Yeah.

822
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,000
The buildings started to deteriorate.

823
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:50,000
And someone I think said like, it's cheaper to demolish this and keep the hotel.

824
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,000
You know, it's cheaper to demolish the holodome.

825
00:39:53,000 --> 00:40:01,000
There was also some questionable financial dealings in the late 80s with former President

826
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Donald Trump.

827
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
You don't say.

828
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
What?

829
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Another thing that was ruined.

830
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
What?

831
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Yeah, why does he think?

832
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Okay, I'm trying to, I got it.

833
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
I only wrote some of this down.

834
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
I'm going to try to do this off the dome.

835
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Off the dome?

836
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Off the holodome.

837
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:22,000
At some point, Donald Trump quietly owned 5% of Holiday Inn stock.

838
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Okay.

839
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:34,000
The reason because Holiday Inn built a casino hotel in Atlantic City, but they needed parking.

840
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:39,000
And the lot that they were like, this is right next door, we can use it.

841
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Who owns that land?

842
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Oh, Donald Trump.

843
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Oh no.

844
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:48,000
So they made a devil's bargain to lease it from Donald Trump.

845
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Then Donald Trump starts looking into Holiday Inn company and realizes this company, the

846
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:59,000
hotels do well, but this is a real estate company.

847
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Like, it's franchise.

848
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,000
They own a ton of real estate around the country.

849
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:07,000
For all the potential sites they might build on or just like, let's grab it now while it's

850
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
cheap.

851
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Just that the hotels are on.

852
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
That's real estate.

853
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Oh, what they already have.

854
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Yeah, yeah.

855
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
They own stock.

856
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:19,000
And this causes the stock price to shoot up when someone gets wind that like, hey, Donald

857
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Trump's buying a bunch of Holiday Inn stock.

858
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,000
The company worries about a hostile takeover.

859
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Wow.

860
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,000
So they start like doing stock buybacks.

861
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:36,000
They start doing stuff to make good for the shareholders so they don't jump on board of

862
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
like, we're going to sell to Donald Trump.

863
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Okay, yeah.

864
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Eventually, the company is in like a bad shape and they have to sell to a British hotel company

865
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
who also owns Bass Brewing.

866
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,000
You know, Bass Beer, the British beer.

867
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Okay.

868
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
So eventually they have to sell.

869
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:04,000
A ton of people in Memphis lose their jobs at the headquarters and who is left has, they

870
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:09,000
have to move to Atlanta to either the new headquarters or the headquarters of this other

871
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
company.

872
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
To probably the Lake Nona equivalent of Atlanta.

873
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Oh, yeah.

874
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Oh, maybe.

875
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Very point where it's possible, yeah.

876
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:19,000
So yeah, Donald Trump almost tanked Holiday Inn in the 80s.

877
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,000
He seems like, yeah, he like ruptured the company in a way.

878
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Right.

879
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Yeah.

880
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
That they're still around, but he-

881
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Did he still maintain his 5% I wonder or when they sold a-

882
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:34,000
I think he sold when it was at a high and made a hefty sum of money.

883
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
It's one of the smartest business guys.

884
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Did it again.

885
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
It's the art of the deal, Michael.

886
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:42,000
You gotta give it up to, you know, ultimately the guy's a smart businessman.

887
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Yeah, yeah.

888
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,000
If we would just let him do, be businessman for the country.

889
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Let him do his thing.

890
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Let him do his thing, you know.

891
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
You know what the kids say?

892
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Let him cook.

893
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
That's what the kids say.

894
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Yeah, you know.

895
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Which kids?

896
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
All of them.

897
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
I'm always talking about cooking and letting people cook.

898
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Let me hear Rodrigo says it.

899
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Yeah.

900
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Let him cook.

901
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Yeah, they're always saying let him cook.

902
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
She's saying it.

903
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
She's saying it, yeah.

904
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
I hear her.

905
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
She's saying it more and more, frankly.

906
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Okay.

907
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,000
You gotta believe that.

908
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:17,000
I forget where this is from, but it says the holiday in chains start to rethink its marketing

909
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:23,000
after changes in corporate ownership and a failed hostile taker in the 80s by a developer

910
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
named Donald Trump.

911
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:30,000
So, yeah, the buildings are falling apart.

912
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,000
People are going to Disney World instead of the damp hotel.

913
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Was there a holodome in Orlando?

914
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Do we know?

915
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Well, I...

916
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:43,000
Because you would think if people were traveling, they would still go and maybe think of staying

917
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:47,000
at a holodome if they were in a place that was very tourist heavy.

918
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Well, that is an interesting fact.

919
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
The first one was in North Dakota.

920
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Again, it's pretty cold there.

921
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,000
The most popular ones were in Florida.

922
00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:02,000
And in the CNN story, someone said, I think it was that historian again, there's nothing

923
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:07,000
worse than taking your kids on a vacation in Florida and it rains for a whole week.

924
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,000
This is a bit of vacation insurance for a lot of people.

925
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,000
For the pool, to get the pool.

926
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
To get the pool time.

927
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Right.

928
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
What was his name again?

929
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Walton.

930
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Last name Walton.

931
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Mr. Walton.

932
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Give me the whole thing.

933
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,000
If you could say this whole thing with the title.

934
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Just give me one.

935
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Hold on a second here.

936
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Ross Walton.

937
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Historian.

938
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Great.

939
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:35,000
The University of Southern Mississippi Center for Oral History and Cultural Heritage.

940
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Okay, wonderful.

941
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Cool.

942
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Thank you.

943
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:42,000
It's like wanting to hear the chorus again for the second time.

944
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,000
You want to hear the hits.

945
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
It's stronger than the first.

946
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:51,000
I'm seeing on some message board, you know, on flyertalk.com where there's a board where

947
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,000
people are talking about where the holodome's locations were.

948
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:59,000
I found a number of message boards where people were doing that.

949
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Well, this guy says Orlando.

950
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:08,000
So I think maybe Orlando was, you know, there was some location coasting off Disney World.

951
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Sandusky.

952
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Louisville.

953
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
I wonder how far west they made it.

954
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Because I never heard of this.

955
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
You've been in Chicago, Adam.

956
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Do you have any, do you feel like, rolling meadows?

957
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:22,000
I played rolling meadows in tennis many times, but I did not know of the dome.

958
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
Were they good?

959
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Did you feel like they sharpened their skills in the holodome?

960
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Maybe at the ping pong tables or the pool tables.

961
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:33,000
I think we were an anti-holiday in family for some reason.

962
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:38,000
I don't think, I think because we were very, you know, brand loyalty for some reason was

963
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:42,000
very big in the house, which I think it was for many of us as kids.

964
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,000
I don't care.

965
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,000
I don't really care about that anymore.

966
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
But there's still some people who I've said this before.

967
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:50,000
We're like, well, we only go to Disney World and go, well, yeah, go to Universal for a

968
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,000
day or something.

969
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000
It's good stuff there.

970
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
We go to Disney World and you're like, what is this?

971
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,000
What are you doing?

972
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Dude, also I've heard you say that you want to be that.

973
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:03,000
You've said about like Park MGM, like this is the place that I go and this is where I'd

974
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,000
like to.

975
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:10,000
I do like having a little spot that feels comfortable, but I am also, stuff changes

976
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
after five or so years.

977
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,000
So it's not like I think I want it in perpetuity, but I like.

978
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
You want to check in and make sure that quality is still.

979
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:23,000
I like the routine of it for a few years and then chances are you're going to have to change.

980
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,000
You shake it up.

981
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,000
Sure.

982
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
Okay.

983
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:31,000
You said that and then I manifested it because I've been Vegas every year since 2020.

984
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
And you've stayed at Park MGM.

985
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
It's where we stay.

986
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
That's what we do.

987
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000
We have Skippy.

988
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,000
We would have Skippy peanut butter.

989
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
We did not have Jif.

990
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
We were Skippy family.

991
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,000
We did not have Domino's pizza.

992
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,000
We had Pizza Hut.

993
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,000
That's what we did.

994
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,000
And we do not stay at Holiday Inn's.

995
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
We stay at Marriott's.

996
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Marriott's are nicer.

997
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
I wonder how much I will end up being this way.

998
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
I guess I have the things where I'm set in my ways.

999
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,000
Will I ever adopt that tone?

1000
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,000
No, no, no.

1001
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
We have the.

1002
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Some of it.

1003
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:08,000
The whatever the crunchy unsalted peanut butter from Trader Joe's because that is where we shop.

1004
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
That's right.

1005
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Some of it is unspoken.

1006
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
A lot of it will be unspoken.

1007
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Sure.

1008
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000
But it is.

1009
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:18,000
I'd rather it be unspoken than go into no because son, this is what we do.

1010
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,000
This is how we are.

1011
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Because that is what we do.

1012
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,000
That's right.

1013
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:28,000
You want to make sure your children are able to track all of the anxious unspoken rules that you have at the house.

1014
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
Yeah.

1015
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Well, they need to know.

1016
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
About brand loyalty mostly.

1017
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Yeah, yeah.

1018
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Corporate takeovers and etc., etc.

1019
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
They need to know all of it.

1020
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
Yeah.

1021
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
So yeah, I don't think I don't.

1022
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:43,000
I don't know if I've ever stayed in a holiday and I'm sure I have, but I think it was when I was older.

1023
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
It was not when we were kids.

1024
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Okay.

1025
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,000
They think the one.

1026
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Holiday Inn Express.

1027
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
A lot of Holiday Inn Express.

1028
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:54,000
I may have done a Holiday Inn Express in San Diego one year for Comic Con.

1029
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Yeah.

1030
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
The wet.

1031
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Far back.

1032
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
The wet eggs.

1033
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
The wet.

1034
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,000
The wet.

1035
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,000
The breakfast.

1036
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,000
The wet fat of the eggs.

1037
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Yeah.

1038
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Yeah.

1039
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,000
Well, yeah, they all have wet eggs though.

1040
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
If you go in the morning.

1041
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,000
That's true.

1042
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,000
We've talked about.

1043
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,000
Hey, wait a minute.

1044
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:12,000
This message board, this clarifies something that I was, I was genuinely curious about.

1045
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:19,000
There is a hotel that I stayed at once that when I started looking into the vibe of this,

1046
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:23,000
mainly when I heard, oh, really musty chlorine smell indoor pool.

1047
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:29,000
I thought that reminds me of where I stayed when I made the mistake of going to Bonnaroo.

1048
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Oh.

1049
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:34,000
It was a gig is why I went and various fun things happened.

1050
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,000
It was the Beach Boys year, so I got to see them there.

1051
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:46,000
But I, this was in the relatively nearby town of Murfreesboro and now it's a Clarion Inn.

1052
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:50,000
And according to this message board, that was a holiday in a holodome.

1053
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Oh, wow.

1054
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:55,000
I was, I Googled even Murfreesboro holiday, holodome and found nothing.

1055
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,000
But here this is the, that was, that was so much the vibe.

1056
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
Wow.

1057
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Interesting.

1058
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
And I, I, there was, you know what?

1059
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
It's exactly, it's how I think I would feel about all of these.

1060
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
I liked it architecturally.

1061
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:12,000
I like looking at a big like indoor pool atrium, but the smell added to the general depression

1062
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:19,000
that I felt when I realized how many days I was stuck in this kind of like miserable shuttle around job

1063
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:22,000
where the producing was kind of not good.

1064
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Beach Boys made up for a lot, you know.

1065
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Yeah.

1066
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,000
That was the 50th anniversary year?

1067
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,000
That was, yeah, surprise.

1068
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,000
They were all there.

1069
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:34,000
So I broke my, if you're tracking from my birthday episode, I only, I've only seen the Mike Love Beach Boys.

1070
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:38,000
If Brian Wilson is involved, I was only on one tour, which was 2012.

1071
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Ben Folds Five that year too.

1072
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Oh, that's good.

1073
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
So that was the year to do it.

1074
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,000
Yeah.

1075
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:53,000
But anyway, so that's been, so listener, if you were worried about me not being sure that that one clarion in Murfreesboro was in fact a holodome, it was in fact a holodome.

1076
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Some of them flipped to Ramadas.

1077
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
I don't know that they've lasted.

1078
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:03,000
It kind of reminded me of the Hotel Nevada Samstown.

1079
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,000
The name of the killers has a big atrium.

1080
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Not really a pool, but this is the lobby.

1081
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,000
So you check in.

1082
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Because it has like a glass ceiling.

1083
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,000
It has a glass ceiling.

1084
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,000
What did you say?

1085
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
Samstown, the name of the killers?

1086
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,000
What did you say?

1087
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,000
There's an Alka.

1088
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,000
The second killers album is called Samstown.

1089
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Yeah.

1090
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,000
To the casino.

1091
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,000
Yeah.

1092
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,000
Okay.

1093
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Yeah.

1094
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Is that a nickname for Vegas or is it just the name of that casino?

1095
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:31,000
I know it as a nickname for the casino.

1096
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
I don't know.

1097
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,000
Hmm.

1098
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:38,000
At some point they sing I See London, I See Samstown.

1099
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,000
Which song is that?

1100
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,000
I forget.

1101
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
The album takes the name from Samstown Hotel and Gambling.

1102
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Yeah.

1103
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,000
It's just that from that.

1104
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:49,000
I think it might be the guy who started station casinos.

1105
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
His name might have been Sam.

1106
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,000
Oh, okay.

1107
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:56,000
So there's not a pool inside here, but there's like some rock where it looks a little like

1108
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
the old Polynesian lobby.

1109
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:04,000
I think I have a fear of glass ceilings because of Beethoven.

1110
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:08,000
Because when Charles Grodin jumped through the skylight of Beethoven.

1111
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:13,000
To get to the evil Dean Jones doctor is going to hurt Beethoven.

1112
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:16,000
It felt traumatic to me because it was looked high up.

1113
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
He should have been much more hurt than he was.

1114
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Not the numerous Batman movies where Batman or one of the villains comes through a glass ceiling.

1115
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Probably played into it too, but Batman seemed to know what he was doing.

1116
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Charles Grodin, who I liked a lot, seemed like your fucking dad just fell two stories.

1117
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,000
Unequipped.

1118
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Like a relatively heavy sweater, but that's not the same as a bat suit.

1119
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Yeah.

1120
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
That whole scene was very traumatic for me at the end of Beethoven.

1121
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,000
The needles?

1122
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,000
How old was I?

1123
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Eight?

1124
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,000
When did Beethoven come out?

1125
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,000
Ninety-one or ninety-two?

1126
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,000
I don't know.

1127
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,000
Don't say it's ninety-seven, please.

1128
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
No, you're in the range.

1129
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,000
Yeah.

1130
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,000
It was, but I remember like glass.

1131
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Just the idea that glass was fragile would stress me out.

1132
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:59,000
So seeing glass ceiling like that sometimes would make me a little uncomfortable.

1133
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
Or like the glass is going to fall, it's going to break.

1134
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Charles Grodin is going to, his body is going to get hurled through the glass and it land on me.

1135
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,000
Anything's possible.

1136
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
It'll be him who lands on you and Charles.

1137
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,000
It'll be specifically Charles Grodin.

1138
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,000
Not Batman.

1139
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,000
Ninety-two is basically.

1140
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,000
Ninety-two, so yeah, and what am I, eight?

1141
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,000
That's a little older.

1142
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:20,000
So how close is, because Clifford came out in ninety-four, but it sat on the shelf for a while.

1143
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,000
He maybe had shot Clifford already.

1144
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Yeah, I'm sure.

1145
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,000
Or they were like close.

1146
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,000
They could have been back to back.

1147
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,000
Probably in the same year.

1148
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:30,000
He was home for a week or two and he was like, all right, I got to go make Clifford.

1149
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:37,000
Yeah, he was so dialed in of making faces at annoying people or animals.

1150
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,000
Children or animals.

1151
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
Yeah, like I might as well just keep it going.

1152
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:44,000
Clifford, come on, Clifford, what, Beethoven, what are you doing?

1153
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,000
Oh, Clifford, oh God.

1154
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,000
Can I take that again?

1155
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
I said Beethoven instead of Clifford.

1156
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,000
I said Clifford.

1157
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,000
I said Clifford.

1158
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,000
Geez.

1159
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,000
Geez.

1160
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,000
Oh, Beethoven.

1161
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
You can't go to dinosaur world, Beethoven.

1162
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:58,000
No, wait, I said dinosaur world.

1163
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
Oh, come on.

1164
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,000
It's probably they left a couple in and we didn't even notice.

1165
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:08,000
He keeps calling Mary Steenburge and Bonnie Hunt.

1166
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
Actors.

1167
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:13,000
What else we got?

1168
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:16,000
What have we missed, holodom-wise?

1169
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,000
Well, Donald Trump playset.

1170
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:22,000
Mr. Walton, the historian.

1171
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
We got him.

1172
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,000
We covered him.

1173
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Even lifting one for a little while.

1174
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,000
Several times.

1175
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:35,000
There are a lot of positive memories online between Reddit and YouTube videos.

1176
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:38,000
There's a lot of camcorder footage video of the holidays.

1177
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
I think we got here before the smell.

1178
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:44,000
OK, the smell of like that not room that's like a greenhouse.

1179
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,000
Yeah.

1180
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
That's pretty crazy, but I do like it.

1181
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Yeah.

1182
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,000
I like it in there.

1183
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,000
It's the humidity is off the charts.

1184
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
But I do want to get out of there.

1185
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,000
It smells weird.

1186
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,000
I'm not staying in there.

1187
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,000
No, I know.

1188
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:59,000
I think one of the day, one of these days we're going to have an episode with see how long

1189
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,000
we can last in there.

1190
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,000
The three of us.

1191
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,000
You guys.

1192
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,000
Something tells me.

1193
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Don't make a home as a game game.

1194
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Whole day.

1195
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
Something tells me I'm taking the bronze.

1196
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:12,000
We drive down to Buena Park and we just sit in that room and see who taps out first.

1197
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,000
And then Scott leaves after two seconds.

1198
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,000
I love the room.

1199
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,000
Let me be clear.

1200
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,000
I know you do.

1201
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,000
I'm just saying it's not a math.

1202
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,000
It's not about amount of time.

1203
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:24,000
But I'm saying I think there's a there was a period, probably a sweet spot of where it

1204
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:31,000
was just sort of pleasant humidity, humidity with like a decent weird smell that you could

1205
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:38,000
actually appreciate versus the complete mildew weird smell that surely happened quickly in

1206
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,000
the lifespan of these things.

1207
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
You got to get there in the first three months.

1208
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:45,000
So I can imagine that a lot of people like thought it was cool, especially was probably

1209
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,000
felt like a novelty.

1210
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,000
Yeah.

1211
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:52,000
But you can also see that if no one was putting money into it, that this thing's the king.

1212
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:58,000
I mean, I noticed that Eva and the Andersons didn't choose to stay there.

1213
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:02,000
They didn't they didn't throw out the plans of the house that they were going to move

1214
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,000
into.

1215
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,000
You know what?

1216
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,000
I think it's a better life for us here in the Holodome.

1217
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,000
Yeah.

1218
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:11,000
Have any actors like stated a holodome while they got in character for a role?

1219
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:15,000
For being like, for being like, for being like, for being like, for being like, for being

1220
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,000
like, for being like, for being like, for being like, for being like, for being like,

1221
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
I have to play a half human, half crocodile.

1222
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,000
Right.

1223
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:23,000
For that reason or just, you know, you had to get your head right for.

1224
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:27,000
She really emphasized the echoey nature of the holodome.

1225
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Oh yeah.

1226
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:32,000
You had to use the, you had to use the holodome voice because that's, it's going to travel

1227
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
if you just like.

1228
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:42,000
So yeah, I, I, I, Jason, can we, can we, can I, can I ask you a question or two about

1229
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:49,000
like, say you're a kid at this point and you go to a holodome, what are the things you

1230
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:54,000
would have wanted to experience if you were six or seven years old in, in like, and I

1231
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:58,000
guess an adjacent dream holodome scenario is what I'm asking something that would seem

1232
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,000
appropriate for the time.

1233
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:03,000
It can't be some like, it can't be like there's an X-Men room in a holodome.

1234
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,000
It has to be realistic.

1235
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
That's the parameter I'm putting on this.

1236
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:09,000
Well, there might be an X-Men arcade cabinet.

1237
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:15,000
That was very funny seeing one corner of a holodome, which is like 20 arcade machines,

1238
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:19,000
kind of like the pool table, just kind of like out in the open.

1239
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,000
Yeah.

1240
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:23,000
It just seemed odd to not have them back to get.

1241
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:28,000
Yeah, there needs to be a little arcades along in the least, a low ceiling type room.

1242
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,000
Usually is weird, isn't it?

1243
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,000
Yeah.

1244
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:33,000
I mean, it's all things that I feel like the atmosphere is what's missing.

1245
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
They don't have to be, but doesn't it feel unnatural?

1246
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,000
Yes.

1247
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:39,000
If you're trying to trap that energy Vegas style, although I guess casinos have higher

1248
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,000
ceilings.

1249
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,000
Yeah.

1250
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:44,000
I mean, obviously there's a whatever that Flynn, they made Flynn's in Disneyland.

1251
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,000
It was I think a tall ceiling because that building was pretty big.

1252
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,000
So that was cool.

1253
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,000
But there's a lot of lights and stuff.

1254
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:54,000
This just feels like somebody was moving a couple arcade cabinets and they forgot and

1255
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
they just left them in the middle of a big room.

1256
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
And you're like, well, why are those here?

1257
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:01,000
A couple visits, the arcade for sure.

1258
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
Swimming, the pool.

1259
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:06,000
I think here's doing some wandering on my own.

1260
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:10,000
I love to wander around hotels myself when I was a kid.

1261
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
So wandering counts as nothing.

1262
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,000
Wandering counts as no activity.

1263
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,000
Yeah.

1264
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,000
I know.

1265
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,000
I think it is an activity.

1266
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,000
Like, I just want to stretch my legs.

1267
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,000
I want to wander around the world.

1268
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:26,000
I inevitably want to get like a magazine and like a key chain souvenir, like a key chain

1269
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
or a T-shirt or something.

1270
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,000
Yeah.

1271
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
I probably Sheridan's day.

1272
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,000
I love this.

1273
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:35,000
I was thinking you were going to order.

1274
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:40,000
I want to I want to wear something on the adults menu.

1275
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
I'm going to eat off kids menu mostly.

1276
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:46,000
But one night I'm like, I want the cheeseburger on the adults.

1277
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
I want the bigger hamburger.

1278
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,000
Oh, OK.

1279
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:54,000
Or like an honest like I want to make a big show of like ordering the chicken Parmesan

1280
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:57,000
from the adults menu.

1281
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:00,000
The way I actually don't want to order from the kids menu tonight.

1282
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,000
I want to order the adults menu.

1283
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:06,000
Because what you're describing, I I almost think I would I would have thought it was

1284
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:11,000
cool because I think I was obsessed with the idea of like living in a cool tiny little

1285
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
city or something.

1286
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:18,000
So as a kid, like there was something cozy in my mind about going and living in the X-Men's

1287
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:22,000
Mansion or living in some like little base or something that felt like you were just

1288
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:25,000
your family, but you could get everything you needed there.

1289
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:26,000
And there was fun to be had.

1290
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:30,000
So I think I would have loved this as a kid in general.

1291
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:34,000
I think I would have I would have loved to go wander and get a magazine and then order

1292
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
it off the adult menu as well.

1293
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,000
Really jumping out.

1294
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,000
I mean, we were all magazine boys.

1295
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:41,000
We were all magazine boys for a little period of time.

1296
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
There was the equivalent of Tiger Beat magazine.

1297
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:48,000
But for boys about the Power Rangers and sat and like X-Men.

1298
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,000
I see your equivalent.

1299
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
And I think so it's girls.

1300
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
And you say no, no, no, no.

1301
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,000
No, I don't.

1302
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,000
Power Rangers.

1303
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
Yeah, Power Rangers, my friends.

1304
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:01,000
Were there were there like posters from that and stuff?

1305
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,000
Yeah, I think so.

1306
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,000
The Power Rangers.

1307
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,000
Yeah.

1308
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
Did you put them on your wall?

1309
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,000
I don't think so.

1310
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
Who was your favorite Tommy?

1311
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:12,000
No, Jason, the Red Ranger.

1312
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,000
Red Ranger.

1313
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,000
Okay.

1314
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:17,000
But then when they were centerfold of red this month, when they replaced them, were

1315
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,000
you upset?

1316
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
I was not particularly thrilled.

1317
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:23,000
I think I switched to Tommy at that point.

1318
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,000
Okay.

1319
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:28,000
I liked Billy to some extent because he was blue and had glasses like me.

1320
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,000
Mm hmm.

1321
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,000
Yeah.

1322
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,000
When I found out the one.

1323
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,000
You were blue emotionally.

1324
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
No, I just saw his other color.

1325
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
No, that didn't start until later.

1326
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,000
Thank you.

1327
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,000
Okay.

1328
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,000
This was the heyday.

1329
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,000
He's talking about the Power Rangers.

1330
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:46,000
I just sent Jason, Super Seven's making very realistic looking Balkan skull action figures.

1331
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,000
Oh, yeah.

1332
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,000
Very exciting.

1333
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
I was like, I'm going to make two goons from Power Rangers.

1334
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
And I was like, this is great.

1335
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,000
This is good stuff.

1336
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:54,000
I know Jason's going to appreciate this.

1337
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,000
And he did.

1338
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,000
I will.

1339
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,000
He was very excited.

1340
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:04,000
I've been really into like thinking about buying more action figures where it's just

1341
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,000
a person in clothing.

1342
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:10,000
Where it's just because we were talking about Peter Parker that you can get like casual

1343
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,000
Peter Parker.

1344
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,000
You know what?

1345
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:15,000
This small toy company is making a Kurt Fuller figure.

1346
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:21,000
Kurt Fuller being like the guy from Ghostbusters 2 or both Ghostbusters who's like the

1347
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,000
Mayor's envoy.

1348
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,000
Yes.

1349
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:24,000
Yes.

1350
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
So you just get a Kurt Fuller action figure.

1351
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
And I'm like, this is great.

1352
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,000
I want more of this.

1353
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,000
The guy is like.

1354
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,000
He's in Wainsboro.

1355
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,000
Yes.

1356
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,000
Yeah.

1357
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:34,000
Yeah.

1358
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,000
That's right, Your Honor.

1359
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,000
This man has no damn.

1360
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,000
Yeah.

1361
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:38,000
I was like, ooh, this is a good road to go down.

1362
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
He's in Sound of Freedom.

1363
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,000
Is he?

1364
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:42,000
I guess so.

1365
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:43,000
Wow.

1366
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,000
There's some bigger actors.

1367
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,000
You got Mayor Cervina.

1368
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:46,000
Hey, the job is a job.

1369
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:47,000
You know?

1370
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,000
Yeah.

1371
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:49,000
So yeah, maybe you'll get a Kurt Fuller action figure.

1372
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:50,000
And then you can dress him up.

1373
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:56,000
You can, well, I don't know what role he plays in Sound of Freedom, but you can, I don't know.

1374
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,000
I hope he's one of the good guys.

1375
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:58,000
I hope so too.

1376
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:59,000
I don't want to figure out of him.

1377
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:00,000
Okay, that's good.

1378
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:03,000
Well, this is just him the person, I think, is the figure.

1379
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,000
So that's good.

1380
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:08,000
Him the person in Ghostbusters or just him like getting a coffee?

1381
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
It's just him getting a coffee, I think.

1382
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,000
Oh, great.

1383
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:15,000
He probably, he can scale to certain Ghostbusters figures, but it's just Kurt Fuller.

1384
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
It's just presented as Kurt Fuller.

1385
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
And it's officially licensed.

1386
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:22,000
An officially licensed character actor action figure.

1387
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,000
Well, I like this.

1388
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:24,000
Yeah.

1389
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,000
Wow, they worked with Fuller Co.

1390
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:28,000
All the Fuller merchandise.

1391
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:34,000
Finally, the figures coming after the years of his clothing brand and everything else.

1392
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:35,000
His lifestyle brand in general.

1393
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
His chain restaurants.

1394
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:38,000
Fullerville.

1395
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
He's really leveraged.

1396
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:41,000
Yeah.

1397
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:42,000
The mismanaged.

1398
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
The man that look like his bald head.

1399
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
This man has no dick-arita.

1400
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:50,000
The signature drink at all of his spots.

1401
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:54,000
Can I order a Frosty Frost?

1402
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:57,000
Frost is, of course, his character from Sound of Freedom.

1403
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:58,000
Of course, yeah.

1404
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:01,000
I have a question on the way out.

1405
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:06,000
I think you wanted all of these topics that the listeners get to, you know.

1406
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,000
Oh, yeah, sure.

1407
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,000
They got to, you know.

1408
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,000
I'd be happy with all of them.

1409
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:10,000
Pick their mode of view.

1410
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,000
Yeah.

1411
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:12,000
Like customizing an action figure.

1412
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
And they chose holodomes.

1413
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:21,000
Here in calling your birthday shot, what do you think holodomes say about you?

1414
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:24,000
How are holodomes, Jason?

1415
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
How are holodomes made?

1416
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:32,000
This one, I think, was just like, okay, I picked an old made-for-TV Marvel movie.

1417
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
A couple of islands of adventure topics.

1418
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
You're talking practically here, though.

1419
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,000
What's that?

1420
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,000
You're talking practically.

1421
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
What does your heart say about holodomes?

1422
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
I'm saying heart, too.

1423
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
You're ramping up, and I apologize.

1424
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
Just giving me the business on my fucking birthday.

1425
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
I know. You're right. I apologize.

1426
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,000
I apologize for a lot.

1427
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
I don't know. I love hotels.

1428
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
I've always loved hotels.

1429
01:02:53,000 --> 01:03:02,000
As an adult, I feel like I indulge in more of the thing that I always wanted to do as a kid,

1430
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:05,000
but my family would only indulge a little, which is like,

1431
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:08,000
let's eat at the hotel restaurant a few times.

1432
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:11,000
And then you just walk down there, and then you walk back to the room.

1433
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:14,000
Maybe you step outside for some air, walk around the property.

1434
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
There's a nice feeling to it.

1435
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:19,000
You've got to go to Tokyo is what you've got to do.

1436
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:22,000
Where those hotel restaurants are pretty superb.

1437
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
I was having such a Tokyo...

1438
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:31,000
In the Disney area, I found the breakfast buffets in the morning pretty fantastic.

1439
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:34,000
Just at the Hilton, not at the non-themed, the non-Disney one.

1440
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:39,000
I have a Tokyo Drift when my memories go and drift away to Tokyo,

1441
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:43,000
because I just the other day was looking at some Instagram stuff and going, oh, take me back.

1442
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:51,000
Oh, I followed the Hilton in the Tokyo Disney day so that I could in my feed sometimes go, oh, yeah, that's right.

1443
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
Oh, look, they're decorated for spring.

1444
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
It's looking lovely, Hilton. Good work.

1445
01:03:55,000 --> 01:04:00,000
Did you go to the rooftop of Tokyo Dome City Hotel?

1446
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:03,000
I don't think I could. I always walked around Tokyo Dome City.

1447
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
Oh, that's right, domes. I was in that area.

1448
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:09,000
I don't know if I was able to make it or wasn't open yet or something.

1449
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
I didn't go to that, but I was in that.

1450
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:12,000
Rooftop bar, yeah.

1451
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
I mean, that's some locked in 80s lobby.

1452
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:15,000
Oh, yeah.

1453
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:16,000
For sure, which I love.

1454
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
Did either of you go to...

1455
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:22,000
I'm assuming this is a reference point that you will know.

1456
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
The Lost in Translation bar is up.

1457
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,000
Yes.

1458
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:26,000
Yeah, we didn't.

1459
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
That fucking rules.

1460
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:29,000
That's a Tokyo tip.

1461
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
If I never said it in an episode.

1462
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:35,000
Famous location from Lost in Translation where it's portrayed.

1463
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
It's at the top of a Hyatt, I believe.

1464
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
I mean, it's easy to Google.

1465
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:45,000
But in Lost in Translation, it's portrayed as this kind of depressing, corny place

1466
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:48,000
where there's cruddy jazz happening.

1467
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:51,000
The opposite. It is packed to the gills.

1468
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:57,000
Great music. At least when we were there, fantastic cocktails.

1469
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:02,000
Truly alive. Some of the best views you're ever going to see.

1470
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:06,000
That Lost in Translation bar, that is no dumb tourist thing.

1471
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:09,000
You will not be sad like Bill Murray if you go up there.

1472
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
I should have gone. Yeah, we got to go.

1473
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:12,000
It's happening. Yeah, when you go back.

1474
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,000
Yeah, highly recommended.

1475
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:18,000
Well, the way his film looks pretty beautiful, but his character is just so sad.

1476
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
It brings down so many scenes.

1477
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
Well, that's a good...

1478
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:25,000
Because I wander in hotels a lot.

1479
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:28,000
We all spent a lot of time at the former Holiday Inn in Burbank

1480
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:32,000
with the multiple bar on the top and the bar on the bottom.

1481
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:35,000
I always... There's something about...

1482
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:39,000
I don't want to be depressed like a person traveling for business,

1483
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:45,000
but there's kind of this melancholy or sense of reflection.

1484
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:49,000
Because I'll go work in hotel lobbies where I'm not staying.

1485
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:55,000
I just did it with Bug in the Anaheim area.

1486
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:58,000
There is some... I don't know if melancholy is the right word because that sounds sad,

1487
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:03,000
but there's some reflectiveness that comes from hotel lobbies.

1488
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
There's something that makes you feel like you're on a vacation

1489
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:08,000
even if you're only in there for a half hour.

1490
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:11,000
It's just a mood. There's something about it.

1491
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:17,000
I think it's one of the things that some people call an in-between place.

1492
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:23,000
Like train stations or the best parts, nicest airports,

1493
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:26,000
where it's just like, oh, I can just be...

1494
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:29,000
There's only three things I can do right now.

1495
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
It definitely is read a magazine.

1496
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:34,000
Read a magazine, go to a restaurant, go to a bar.

1497
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:37,000
Yeah. I mean a good hotel bar.

1498
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:40,000
Airport bars can be great too.

1499
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:43,000
That's interesting. That is a good framing for that.

1500
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
It eliminates your options.

1501
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:48,000
Maybe you're on the way to something that'll be busy and crazy,

1502
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:52,000
but here you just got to stay in your little bubble and try to entertain yourself.

1503
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
If you're solo, get a little thinkin' done.

1504
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:55,000
Sure.

1505
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:56,000
Sure. That's right.

1506
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,000
That's bad.

1507
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:02,000
I feel like people probably came to some big determinations in their lives in the holodome.

1508
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
I'm sure that's the case. They would have to have.

1509
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:08,000
There was so much time and so much humidity hitting their brain.

1510
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:11,000
It was just moisturizing their brain.

1511
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:14,000
Acting like an enema.

1512
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
That's right. Getting the bad thoughts out.

1513
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
Hearing things out.

1514
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:21,000
They would save money. They didn't have to travel as far.

1515
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
The humidity would make them a little lightheaded,

1516
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:27,000
so that Canadian club and soda they were drinking would go a little further.

1517
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:28,000
That's true.

1518
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,000
To relaxing.

1519
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:30,000
Good point.

1520
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:31,000
Yeah.

1521
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
Good times ahead, I'm sure.

1522
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
I had a good time talking about it. You feel good?

1523
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
I feel great. Yeah.

1524
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
This was a really fun one.

1525
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:42,000
This one, very well documented.

1526
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:47,000
I had lots of great blog posts and recollections, some great pictures and postcards.

1527
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
Pretty fun.

1528
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:54,000
See if I can track down just the tiny holiday inside, I don't need the giant place.

1529
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
I want you to have the whole thing.

1530
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
Because then you could have Kurt Fuller live in the...

1531
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
He says it comes with 38 pieces.

1532
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:04,000
Kurt Fuller is not going to scale with the Playmobil toys, which does bother me.

1533
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
I'm a scale guy.

1534
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:10,000
Because I like to have my toys scaled correctly next to each other,

1535
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
unless it's a real like kind of grab bag shelf.

1536
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:19,000
I've been interested in these 3.75 inch Marvel figures that kind of look like the shittier 80s, 90s ones.

1537
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
I have one or two. It's not my thing.

1538
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:28,000
My thing is I want it to look exactly like the characters, not the toys from the old days, in general.

1539
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:29,000
I see.

1540
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
I want it to... There's a specific... Yeah.

1541
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:36,000
I have things that I sort of prefer, let's just say.

1542
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:44,000
In this house, we have characters that look like they were looking on the screen or on the page of the comic book.

1543
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
That's how I do it in this house.

1544
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
That's how we do proportional consistency.

1545
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
That's right. We like... That's what we do. That's what we like.

1546
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:53,000
That's right. 7 inch Neckos, toys.

1547
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:59,000
We don't like the 3.75 Marvels. We like the Marvel Legends, the ones that are a little taller.

1548
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:04,000
Dad, I just asked you to sign the permission slip so I can go to the Natural History Museum.

1549
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:05,000
I didn't need all that.

1550
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
I'm not finished yet. I'm not finished.

1551
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:10,000
This is a one-way ticket to your daughter not liking toys.

1552
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:11,000
That's right.

1553
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
Well, she's already not allowed to touch...

1554
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,000
This whole area, I don't...

1555
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:21,000
The parent-teacher conference, it's like, well, she's very studious, a great student, hates toys for some reason.

1556
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:22,000
She really hates them.

1557
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:23,000
We're a little worried.

1558
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:24,000
During playtime.

1559
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
Never met a child who despises toys.

1560
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:30,000
Well, she wasn't allowed to touch them, so she had some anger towards them.

1561
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:33,000
Well, that's just the case. Sorry.

1562
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
She was going to break them. That's all.

1563
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:41,000
Well, Jason, I think you survived Podcast The Ride of the Second Gate, your birthday shot.

1564
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:42,000
Happy birthday to you.

1565
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:43,000
Thank you.

1566
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:47,000
Nice choice. Thanks, listeners, for the choice.

1567
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:54,000

1569
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:04,000
I think the question to ask here at the end is, do we repeat the birthday shot program?

1570
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:10,000
We all had our chance. March for you, July for me, October for Jason.

1571
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:11,000
Do we...

1572
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:12,000
I feel like we liked these.

1573
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:13,000
I think it was pretty successful.

1574
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:16,000
I think we all got something out.

1575
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:17,000
Yeah.

1576
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:21,000
Something deeper and got to explore fascinations.

1577
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:25,000
Do we have thoughts? You don't want to ruin it, necessarily, the surprise.

1578
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:33,000
There's many thoughts I have. There's a few different deep dives I'm wondering which would be the most appropriate or it doesn't matter if it's appropriate, I suppose.

1579
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:41,000
But yeah, I got ideas. I don't know if I've mentioned before we can in the spirit of your Beach Boys, I certainly could do a Weezer episode.

1580
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:44,000
You did mention it. Yeah.

1581
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,000
I could certainly do...

1582
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:46,000
What else are you thinking?

1583
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:50,000
I could do more of a bare naked ladies deep dive.

1584
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:59,000
I could do... I almost kind of want to do an episode fully just on the Ninja Turtles Archie comics that I was obsessed with as a kid where Raphael punches out Hitler.

1585
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:05,000
That's significantly more fun maybe than that Weezer episode.

1586
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:06,000
Oh, I disagree.

1587
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:13,000
I was about to suggest, well, Mike, you did say, what about program a whole month and we each program a month of second game.

1588
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:14,000
Well, Michael month is certainly...

1589
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:19,000
But then when he starts in with the Weezer deep cuts, I'm like, oh, I regret that suggestion.

1590
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:25,000
I think days are good, unless there's a comic where Raphael punched rivers.

1591
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:29,000
Maybe recently. I haven't seen it.

1592
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:36,000
But there's other things. There's other things. So there's options. I'm not... I'll say this. I ain't letting the audience decide.

1593
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:42,000
That ain't happening. Sorry, folks. You're not deciding. It's Michael's time to shine.

1594
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:45,000
This is how I do it. This is how we like it.

1595
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:50,000
Jason's a man of the people, not me. I choose my own.

1596
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
I can't guarantee you'll do it next year. I might just pick.

1597
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:53,000
Yeah.

1598
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
You know, I let them invent your original soundtrack.

1599
01:11:55,000 --> 01:12:02,000
I may say that my choice is just all the ones that I've picked from this club threes over the last months and we just do them all at once.

1600
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:08,000
That might be actually a club three that is all of your less than 10% losers.

1601
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:11,000
Sorry, you gotta pick one.

1602
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,000
Yeah, we'll see.

1603
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:16,000
Oh, I picked some. I mean, I picked some. What am I? Went to hell.

1604
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:17,000
Oh, that's right.

1605
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:18,000
Which one did you go to hell?

1606
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,000
Google CES.

1607
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:20,000
Oh, yeah. We'll never talk about it.

1608
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:21,000
Yeah, that's right.

1609
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:22,000
Oh, even this is too much.

1610
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:23,000
Too much, yeah.

1611
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:24,000
We gotta get out of here or there'll be a curse.

1612
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:25,000
Let's go.
