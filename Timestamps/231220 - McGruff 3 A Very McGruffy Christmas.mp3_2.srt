00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:28,440
Welcome to podcast the ride the second gate for McGruff three, the rise of Skywalker of

2
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:35,680
the McGruff saga in the sense that it's the thrilling conclusion or no what what

3
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:40,920
well to a trilogy to a trilogy I didn't say that it's gonna be the end of the

4
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:45,680
McGruff episodes because as we know Ray is coming back that's right a new movie

5
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:54,140
mm-hmm but that was a trilogy 789 Star Wars somehow McGruff has returned my

6
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:57,740
name is Mike speak my name is Mike Carlson join me as always

7
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:03,900
Scott Gardner that's right and McGruff we all can't believe the very first

8
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:07,780
thing said wasn't like this I thought about doing it but then I thought

9
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:10,820
everyone was gonna expect it so I said you know what I'm not gonna do it cuz I

10
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:19,260
gotta say like welcome to my gruff three I'm blowing this voice out you know we

11
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:23,020
should do we should intro you to our ourselves but also our McGruff's as well

12
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:27,420
because there's actually six hosts that will be on this show today it's not just

13
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:34,060
a B and C so Jason Sheridan hi but Jason Sheridan's McGruff impression Mike knows

14
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:38,820
that you have to play with expectations to keep interest that's exactly right

15
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:43,660
creative endeavor thank you Jason's McGruff so yeah we're all six of us are

16
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:47,940
here today to do McGruff three it was supposed to maybe happen two years ago

17
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:52,860
but we just didn't do it yeah I don't know what it well um I mean probably

18
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:58,620
some scheduling has bumped and changed it in some way because we've been

19
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:03,580
waiting to do it in the holiday season because right that's true this is my

20
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:09,740
gruff three a very McGruff Christmas so I don't want to get it's a Christmas

21
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:13,620
McMiracle I don't want to get complicated immediately but I have to

22
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:21,300
explain that McGruff three is gonna primarily focus on McGruff cassette for

23
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:28,100
so McGruff three is McGruff four make no mistake if you hear about a McGruff three

24
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:33,540
that is that isn't McGruff four you got the wrong McGruff three that's where

25
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:36,580
counterfeit McGruff three that's exactly right McGruff

26
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:42,100
Scott's McGruff thank you gruff see let's say so I'll be polite and take the

27
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:48,100
last letter here's what here's here's what we have to figure out before before

28
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:53,260
the fun fully begins there's a lot of McGruff material out there is another

29
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:57,380
album that's separate that's why I'm saying trilogy because like we talked

30
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:00,700
about smart kids of course which is the classic McGruff album that is a

31
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:06,300
masterpiece legit and then we have been discussing or at least the last episode

32
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:10,860
two different McGruff cassettes and there are four of these Burger King proudly

33
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:16,500
presents McGruff cares for you do you remember what because the last one we

34
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:21,300
haven't done this in three years I know gruff two was in 2020 and all speaking

35
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:26,580
personally all 2020 pandemic era episodes I have blacked out on

36
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:31,660
completely I don't remember any of the previous McGruff songs and I certainly

37
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:35,460
don't remember if it was McGruff one or four or three or whatever well I do

38
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:39,100
remember what we did I do remember I looked into all this I listened to

39
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:45,780
McGruff to yesterday there's a lot of jokes about hunter Biden's laptop so

40
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:52,060
there's some time we called it finally getting taken to justice

41
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:58,580
laptop so yeah so there's that's in there but what happened was that and let

42
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:02,540
me just double check my number of cassettes okay we did smart kids on

43
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:07,140
first McGruff's music career and then we did a little of cassette three on that

44
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:11,100
episode which we did the song alpha better we talked about we talked about

45
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:17,100
the song who has zards oh yeah remember czar hurts hazard short for hazards I

46
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:22,420
just got checked for zards none this year but I'm getting older so you're

47
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:28,700
always a great you gotta get checked for czar don't worry here don't have a

48
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:35,220
friend burn off your zards with a lighter that can go horribly wrong let

49
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:39,740
doctors do it with a camera a zard spotting camera we did a song strangers

50
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:44,540
don't look strange of course from cassette three I mean we can refresh if

51
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:49,460
you want some if people don't remember some of these songs but we did we did

52
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:53,060
cassette three I'm trying to play strangers don't look strange it's

53
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:56,900
crashing my computer as anyone doesn't remember my songs it's good there's

54
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:02,220
smoking doobies every shot guess he's really a stranger I don't even know

55
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:10,420
right how about the school crossing guard so nice and he helps us he's not a

56
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:16,900
good friend of my family he's a stranger yes he is how about the woman who works

57
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:22,100
in the ice cream store she's never been to our house for dinner so she's a

58
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:26,780
stranger so McGruff really breaks down how you know a stranger and I don't

59
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:32,100
I see him every day he knows my name what do you think but my family doesn't

60
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:37,220
know him he's a stranger yep he's a stranger

61
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:42,660
I don't see him every day but he's not a stranger one dinner in that on Clarem

62
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:48,500
that's the sister our strangers you know his favorite song is you can't talk to

63
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:52,620
strangers because you only have to talk to the wrong one once that's right and

64
00:05:52,620 --> 00:06:04,860
then you go and then I look I look we talked about this one though there's no

65
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:09,660
room for discussion but we did this in the first McGruff mm-hmm and then in

66
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:15,940
McGruff to we tackled cassette one and two someone so McGuff do we do them all

67
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:22,180
well we don't four is still here okay we got through them we got through both of

68
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:27,100
them but we were running out of time so we said we'll save four but around that

69
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:31,900
same time I learned of a different McGruff album not connected to the four

70
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:37,020
cassettes and not connected to smart kids a separate story like rogue one or

71
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:44,260
and or I'm a gruff story yes McGruff rising I'm never letting anybody play a

72
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:50,820
younger me over my dead body I'm not letting some dumb puppy take my film I

73
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:56,700
don't so the the album is called McGruff and scruff and the crime dogs and this

74
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:59,820
is another thing and this was a this was an issue we had with the cassettes is

75
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:05,140
that McGruff doesn't sing enough on them and boy is that true with this but I

76
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:09,100
think we could breeze through some of McGruff and scruff in the crime dogs

77
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:16,220
before we get to McGruff cassette for but now is it a Christmas music no it's

78
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:21,860
not wait I thought wait I thought this was Christmas for is for is set oh but

79
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:25,780
not this I was about to go are we doing McGruff Christmas for no reason at

80
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:29,620
Christmas no I'm so sorry I'm really Jason I truly have not heard any of this

81
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:36,060
no I know this is coming in fresh yes so no for is holiday stuff great so my only

82
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:41,900
question would be what happens to McGruff for are we watering down McGruff

83
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:46,020
for no I here's what I think here's what I think I think McGruff for is we

84
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:50,020
start to get into the specials that's why I'm saying this is the end of the

85
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:55,060
trilogy is because it's sort of the end of the music just album specific

86
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:58,980
discussion and then because we know there's a Drew Barrymore special there's

87
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:03,300
a different there's two other specials I was looking at last night so we move on

88
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:08,820
from McGruff's music career right to McGruff's acting career exactly uh-huh

89
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:12,140
okay so that's what I and then we could do commercial we could do more

90
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:17,660
stuff there and that's like McGruff will move into my commercial stuff yeah if

91
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:22,580
you want the real you want the album cuts check this one out yes so so that's

92
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:25,300
what I think I think we can go through McGruff and scruff and the crime dogs

93
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:30,260
which again is this so totally separate thing I accidentally hit well play on

94
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:37,260
there why not just push play huh there are some said we all remember that that

95
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:46,100
was actually just an ad that started on YouTube scary mysterious beware some of

96
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:52,540
my music might be so we're a lot of it is I'm always trying to sell you

97
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:56,700
something I want to say also though I do have the puppet which I mentioned in the

98
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:00,220
last McGruff episode there is that friend of the show Andrew Grissom got me

99
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:03,460
and I said it's one of the greatest gifts I've ever received and boy

100
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:10,220
especially with a child yes this is a really fun good and I go hey how are you

101
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:14,420
and then she usually likes it but then once in a while she's scared right to my

102
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:19,060
daughter that is or just like doesn't like over it isn't ready like kind of

103
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:24,020
over my bullshit so usually she likes it and she gets excited especially when she

104
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:28,460
was a little when McGruff would pop up she'd go nuts she gets so excited to see

105
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:33,300
him it is funny that you and I like I think I don't know that you and I do our

106
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:40,260
kind of show personas we aren't like yeah character as parents however seems

107
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:45,180
like you had a great time entertaining your young child with McGruff and I just

108
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:49,380
found a big bunch of old videos I forgot about where I'm making my son go nuts

109
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:55,460
with the DJ Rex robot oh yeah we have had these moments of like what you the

110
00:09:55,460 --> 00:10:00,140
listener would expect us to do with little kids that's true yes and I was

111
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:03,780
doing this without a little kid too but now it's like it really feels good

112
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:08,540
making yourself laugh in the mirror yeah I wake up you slept through your alarm

113
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:16,780
again I have there's an elf I have a big elf puppet now too that I do a lot of

114
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:21,660
that hmm my friend Luke got a Kermit the frog puppet and the problem is I haven't

115
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:24,340
used Kermit a lot because I don't feel comfortable doing that I want the voice

116
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:28,340
to be right and I'm trying to get the voice better before I do Kermit you're

117
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:33,620
in the lab yeah yeah yeah but no McGruff is McGruff is the best thing

118
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:37,540
you're gonna do boy you're gonna be on to something when you crack that Kermit

119
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:46,460
nobody does a Kermit impression that's very true maybe I can get a job so yeah

120
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:50,420
so I we should we could pass the McGruff around if you want even I don't know

121
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:55,220
what you could do the mm-hmm puppeting if you want I don't know it's up to you

122
00:10:55,220 --> 00:11:00,180
he could sit in the middle here Mike are these are these guys strangers or

123
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:06,560
not if they're strangers I don't want to be touched and harassed by them no no

00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:48,660
of good ideas where's your club random McGruff oh he shot it already it's too

156
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:54,500
long they're taking taking forever to edit it down I don't like kids doing

157
00:13:54,500 --> 00:14:00,660
drugs but said but a 70 year old man in the company of a great but disgracing

Carola everyone else throw him out Carola what a guy he's got the greatest

162
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:31,420
guests Alan Dershowitz and Chris should be on less they should do their own

163
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:36,700
smart lists podcast remember when we discovered in a recent episode that

164
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:41,060
animated thing the fairy tale that Johnny Cochran is in yeah you know who

165
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:44,540
else is in it go ahead Alan Dershowitz Wow of course he is

166
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:55,300
injure Cochran and Dershowitz all brought together on the plane yeah

167
00:14:55,460 --> 00:15:02,780
they're smart full that's all I gotta say all right well let's get to the

168
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:07,820
music my throat hurts oh yeah let's just go yeah okay this is a McGruff and

169
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:14,460
scruff in the crime dogs album I believe it's from 1992 and let's just do so

170
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:20,260
there's some stuff to like on here but I'm gonna again say this is no smart

171
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:27,300
kids so don't expect a legit cool indie rock album because it's not this but

172
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:34,860
there's here this will get one for them one for you this is called living it

173
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:39,940
safe at home which I do think you'll find something to enjoy

174
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:55,460
I don't want to die doing it yeah

175
00:15:56,060 --> 00:16:01,380
here's a song about some safety stuff introducing scruff the nephew of McGruff

176
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:06,540
the message in the song is relative so just sit right back I'll tell you what

177
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:08,860
it is

178
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:13,820
I enjoy this

179
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:22,860
crime crime take a bite out of crime let's do what's right don't you think

180
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:27,500
that it's time for us to say no to walk on and tell one and all we're standing

181
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:30,860
up on the side of the law

182
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:36,860
I'm gonna take a break

183
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:41,860
rat music is famously anti-police it's time for us to fix this

184
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:45,860
safe that is so play it smart don't mess around with that danger bitch

185
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:50,860
this is real life not a pop quiz if you find a gun leave it where it is

186
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:54,860
if there's a knock on your door don't just let him in you've got to be certain

187
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:59,860
this person's a friend you know being safe at home can be really tough so feel

188
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:03,860
free to use these words from my friend

189
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:08,420
he wrote it McGruff wrote the song my spirits in there so there's a lot of

190
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:12,740
that like there's yeah there's there's little tastes of McGruff or and scruff

191
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:15,140
and by the way I want to say this in case we didn't say this on the last two

192
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:20,260
episodes those are two characters people call McGruff scruff McGruff that is not

193
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:25,220
his name that was rough is a separate character I did that I did that plenty

194
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:31,500
yeah I was confused why the child would have a mailing address like a P.O. box

195
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:36,300
that is weird that is a you know yeah yeah the post office made me do two

196
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:42,700
names when I get it cuz you're talking about scruff McGruff Chicago

197
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:48,220
but it should have been scruff comma McGruff Chicago and only 606 don't tell

198
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:54,620
it to me my P.O. box is different I got a different address just for me for my

199
00:17:54,620 --> 00:18:02,580
stuff for personal things I don't want to talk about it it's a it's a man in a

200
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:07,340
an office somewhere remember I called the National Crime Prevention Council on

201
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:12,900
the first or to try to figure out who wrote smart kids which we think maybe we

202
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:18,020
found the person who did it yeah I forget where that all was left Pandora's box of

203
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:22,100
like I don't know if we want to talk to this person this is a problem we run

204
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:25,780
into from time to time as well we might be able to have somebody on it did this

205
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:30,940
thing that we like oh yeah of an age where they might have some beliefs that

206
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:35,820
are not beliefs we want to talk to hear about or make our listeners here about

207
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:39,500
yeah yeah so I think that's what happened with the trying to track down

208
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:44,940
who wrote smart kids like you're never gonna believe this the guy who made a

209
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:55,620
bunch of 80s music on behalf of the police pretty liberal actually Sting's

210
00:18:55,620 --> 00:19:01,860
all about saving the rain for us the other the real police oh we thought he

211
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:06,740
was gonna come on here and then talk about rides with us and talk about like

212
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:10,780
yeah now maybe yeah maybe you would say show us the gear he made it with that

213
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:15,780
might be interesting the key Oh the music music here yeah yeah but if you

214
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:22,380
could let yeah can I touch the keyboard that played but I think that this guy

215
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:26,820
yeah I think that this is the album that because when I called the Crime

216
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:30,300
Prevention Council and I said this on the episode I made it seem like it was

217
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:36,580
an old like oh what are you looking for a CD I remember we made an album yeah

218
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:40,580
and like I think they were talking about the this album actually because I

219
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:44,260
because they said there was a guy in Florida and I found a guy in Florida who

220
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:49,500
I contacted and he said it was not him who did smart kids but he did this oh

221
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:55,540
okay who we're hearing right now is that the singer I don't know that he's saying

222
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:59,140
but I found like remember I found this guy who did like a risk he like recently

223
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:03,140
did a recycling video like a couple years ago it's like a kids video for

224
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:06,460
like making sure you recycle and I was like oh this has got to be the guy and

225
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:11,700
it was a guy but not for smart kids it was for I think scruff or McGruff and

226
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:16,180
scruff and the crime dogs okay do have you calling the Crime Prevention Council

227
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:21,220
and they pick up hello is there a crime that you need prevented yeah well not

228
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:25,500
quite oh well the crime of podcast audience listening out on a great pile

229
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:31,100
of music you see the person didn't seem that busy so that was a good thing I

230
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:35,380
again I'm still confused what it is it's supposedly some sort of government

231
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:42,180
agency but anyway so here's something that's very much of its time it's it's

232
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:48,380
called phone card peace of mind and this is just to basically tell kids how to

233
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:52,820
use a phone card which I don't know if there was any deal made with a phone

234
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:55,140
card

235
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:09,140
safe place it will spring to action in emergency

236
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:14,700
easy to use just listen to me

237
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:23,580
it's as easy as one two three there's help waiting to lend a hand you'll see

238
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:32,740
this was one dollar number that is on the back to enter your pin number it's

239
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:41,460
as easy as that three dollar number that you want to reach

240
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:50,540
help get someone to teach you won't need a coin there's no need to worry it's

241
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:57,140
okay it's a caught you call a number enter a pin number then or the phone

242
00:21:57,140 --> 00:22:04,700
number you want to reach is this like is this just for me to use day to day can I

243
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:09,060
use this if I want to talk to grandma or is this how I'm supposed to like if I'm

244
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:17,060
getting attacked if there's a lot of questions here simple but I did leave me

245
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:22,300
with a few questions yeah okay here number one the card helps know that it

246
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:30,220
helps I guess number two take it out read the back dial one number then put

247
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:35,660
in a different set of numbers there I like that boy I have to wait for it

248
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:40,780
depends on the phone then put in another set of numbers for the phone the phone

249
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:46,340
you're trying to call do you know how I have the card did you are you do does it

250
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:53,060
come with this album no $10 card you got to get it from your parents so it

251
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:56,780
doesn't need a coin it just needs just means that the game was already dealt

252
00:22:56,780 --> 00:23:02,180
with but it's not part of the whole process of calling like a normal pay

253
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:06,580
phone in 1992 okay the coin exchange has already happened so that's where the

254
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:11,700
convenience yeah that's right so the song is clear and it's pretty good and

255
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:16,220
helped a lot of kids so I hope I hope you know everyone remembers this and

256
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:21,300
probably got out of a good jam or two with this so I was that oh yeah I saved

257
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:26,940
lives yeah I saved a couple lives at least when the kids got a phone card and

258
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:31,460
they remembered this song cuz it's so catchy yeah they remembered how it

259
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:36,580
worked I could have spent upwards of $10 have they used one eight on your collect

260
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:41,500
that is what I was like doing their collect call this is often how those and

261
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:45,980
those would all usually have someone 800 like yeah like a jingle you would

262
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:51,300
remember yeah and not like a very tuneless song that's just telling you

263
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:55,500
can't name the numbers behind yeah so I don't did anyone have a photo you have a

264
00:23:55,500 --> 00:24:01,060
phone card we were a kid I don't know I think so I remember being given one I

265
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:07,220
think when we went on the you know high school DC trip Oh high school really to

266
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:15,700
use the you know pay phone down the hall use the phone card yeah I gave you

267
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:19,900
that that was you a neat thing you would have never known what your parents are

268
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:23,980
you could have parents could have been killed I never would have known about a

269
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:28,700
lot of kids tried calling into the card itself and using that as a phone but it

270
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:33,300
didn't work cuz it was only a piece of paper a lot of kids are fucking idiots

271
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:39,740
the dumbest kids picked up the card and said hello hello mommy please that's

272
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:45,460
not how cards or phones little high school Jason called into the card a few

273
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:51,580
times until he remembered my song the tune of my song oh wait yeah I have a

274
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:57,100
pin and then I call the number and then I call the actual number okay the song's

275
00:24:57,100 --> 00:25:01,540
not over let's listen to what the rest of the song is hold on

276
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:08,740
it's not like the other phone cards around

277
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:16,100
by far the best one that we found got a picture of a dog on it gives you the

278
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:25,460
power of communication stores a lot of important information

279
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:32,100
even speed dial to call the police don't leave home without one of these

280
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:37,980
okay the police you call 9-1-1 there's no reason to speed dial the police yeah

281
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:43,700
with a calling card or whatever well the speed is 9-1-1 isn't it of course dial

282
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:49,180
that fast yeah but if you know the cards number real you got to go fat you can do

283
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:55,660
it fast that way to 9-1-1 is sometimes too slow okay it's a different line

284
00:25:55,660 --> 00:26:00,340
actually I guess you're like let me give you some credit when it was the turn oh

285
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:05,220
that's true that you know that like that really nine you got a loop all the way

286
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:09,860
back around is that what you were thinking McGruff yeah that was it what

287
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:17,580
this one is just one one one one one so it's actually faster yeah yeah and you

288
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:22,660
taught kids do you ran drills how fast can you one you taught them yeah it's a

289
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:31,220
song I was working on that I never made it how fast can you one like run no

290
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:50,260
listen up got waxing your ears got another ear infection I'm finding it

291
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:55,460
impossible to believe that we were gonna get to the Christmas song yeah I could

292
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:59,660
go back what if well what if we'd save some of the songs that it was a word

293
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:02,140
there's no way we could do another one oh yeah okay you're right you're right

294
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:05,660
we could songs in I mean I'm enjoying this very much but it's gonna be right

295
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:08,900
you're right we get to a point where it's like all right so half of McGruff

296
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:16,140
Christmas will be in spring 2026 the last episode we did we did two things so

297
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:18,280
I felt like we could get through it but you're right there's no way we're

298
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:21,300
getting through this well we can if we give we pick up the pain you're right

299
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:24,700
you're right no we're not and we can why would we want to do that though yeah

300
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:28,940
let's go okay you're right each one of these has 25 minutes where I'm gonna

301
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:35,140
opening about it being a trilogy and then they can learn our process discover

302
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:41,220
on the fly yeah like see we're not so bad we're kind of smart like my bootleg

303
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:48,140
sausage okay McGruff McGruff cares for you cassette for this is called gift wrap

304
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:03,700
I will say these are the most confusing songs out of all the four cassettes

305
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:09,620
narratively you almost have to hear

306
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:18,300
now I like this by the way

307
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:38,860
tired well you don't always need money to buy a gift to go to someone very

308
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:44,100
special wrapped in paper big your gift can be your helping mom gets to great

309
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:49,020
letter to a friend out of state

310
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:57,780
just cleaning up your room long before you dad get mad and had to tell you to

311
00:28:57,780 --> 00:29:02,500
not bad no not bad at all

312
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:07,980
it ain't just forgiving your little sister when she broke your favorite

313
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,980
skateboard or video bike or a pen

314
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:11,980
your favorite video bike

315
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:13,980
forgiveness is a great gift too

316
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:15,980
but what would you do with it

317
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:17,980
I was guessing toys that might come in the future

318
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:19,980
they love their engines they love video bikes

319
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:21,980
does that sound cool you'd want one

320
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:23,980
be first in line

321
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:25,980
something to wear something to share just in a on a show

322
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:27,980
this is confusing this song is really all over the place

323
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:29,980
again

324
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:31,980
I'm not sure what to do with this

325
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:33,980
I'm not sure what to do with this

326
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,980
I'm not sure what to do with this

327
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:37,980
this song is really all over the place

328
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:39,980
a good gift is like forgiveness

329
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:41,980
but also it's like a regular gift is good too

330
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:43,980
I like some of those keyboard things

331
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:45,980
I like some of those keyboard things

332
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:47,980
yeah, I liked it until the boy

333
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:49,980
showed up

334
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:51,980
yeah, the rapping

335
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:53,980
this next song is called

336
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:55,980
golden age rock

337
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:57,980
and this is about

338
00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:59,980
going to a retirement home

339
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:01,980
and decorating it

340
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:03,980
for Christmas

341
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:07,980
hi troops

342
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:09,980
what's all the excitement here?

343
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:11,980
sounds like a party

344
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:13,980
hey McGruff, you're just in time

345
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:15,980
could you please grab that box over there?

346
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,980
sure, but what's going on?

347
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:19,980
we're going over to the golden age

348
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:21,980
retirement home

349
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:23,980
to help them decorate for the holidays

350
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:25,980
great, let's go

351
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:27,980

352
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:29,980

00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:35,980
gang, let's decorate

356
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:37,980
grab all the ornaments

357
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:39,980
and light up the lights

358
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:41,980
we're going to make this place sparkle

359
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:43,980
tonight

360
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:45,980
don't use the blue

361
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:47,980
put the blue away, red and green

362
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:49,980
we're sticking to the blue

363
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:51,980
I'm clapping stairway banisters

364
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:53,980
in gardens of deep green

365
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:55,980
in gardens of deep green

366
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:57,980
then I'm adding lots of bright red bows

367
00:30:57,980 --> 00:30:59,980
the biggest you've ever seen

368
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:01,980
the biggest you've ever seen

369
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:03,980
I'm laying some bows

370
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:05,980
a fresh cut pine

371
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:07,980
a complimental piece

372
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:09,980
so everyone

373
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:11,980
can enjoy the set

374
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:13,980
when it's a marble year place

375
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:15,980
I hung

376
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:17,980
the Christmas wreath I made

377
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:19,980
over by Mr. Blair

378
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:21,980
Mr. Blair

379
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,980
he said he wants to look at it

380
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:25,980
from his favorite

381
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:27,980
overstuffed chair

382
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:29,980
hey here comes Mrs. Carpenter with cookies

383
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:31,980
I can't wait

384
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:33,980
she said she made them just for us

385
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:35,980
those are mine, I drove us so

386
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:37,980
I get them, I get first duty

387
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:39,980
if I have any room left I'll give them to you

388
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:41,980
I came here for Mrs. Carpenter's cookies

389
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:45,980
dogs love chocolate cookies

390
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:49,980
I'll have them but I'm going to

391
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:51,980
take a bad shit tonight

392
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:53,980
I'll regret it later but they're going to be good going in

393
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:55,980
thank you so much Mrs. Carpenter

394
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:57,980
for these cookies

395
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:59,980
Mr. Blair is an asshole

396
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:01,980
he won't give me any of his treats

397
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:03,980
and you know what

398
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:05,980
Merry Christmas Mrs. Carpenter

399
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:07,980
and Mr. Blair whatever it is you do

400
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:09,980
whatever you do your thing

401
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:11,980
yeah

402
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:13,980
this is really

403
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:15,980
the kids, first of all

404
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:17,980
this was on the other cassettes

405
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:19,980
but the kids singing, these kids are awful

406
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:21,980
these kids are terrible singers

407
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:23,980
make a special treat

408
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:25,980
make a special treat

409
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:27,980
like there's one part where the kid comes in

410
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:29,980
and he just couldn't be more off

411
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:31,980
on it, which I mean I guess

412
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:33,980
I like it about this

413
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:35,980
I chose them based on how good

414
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:37,980
they were as people

415
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:39,980
not how, not singing

416
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:41,980
ability, you've been to Hollywood

417
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:43,980
ever, performers

418
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:45,980
are corrupt sinners

419
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:47,980
they're trouble

420
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:49,980
that's the voice of an angel

421
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:51,980
I also didn't want to

422
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:53,980
I didn't want them

423
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:55,980
overshadowing me in my vocal talents

424
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:57,980
they're gonna make me look better

425
00:32:57,980 --> 00:32:59,980
by comparison

426
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:01,980
let's finish this out here

427
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,980
care for me

428
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:05,980
I heard it's Mr. Bair's birthday

429
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:07,980
he got new dancing shoes

430
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:09,980
he said he wore his last pair out

431
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:11,980
while we say happy 82

432
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:13,980
when on the road

433
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:15,980
he said he was a little bit sad

434
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:17,980
he said he was a little bit sad

435
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:19,980
he said he was a little bit sad

436
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:21,980
wait until you see

437
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:23,980
the nice display

438
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:25,980
on the second floor

439
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:27,980
I found

440
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:29,980
the perfect table there

441
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:31,980
and we set up the menorah

442
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:33,980
alright, wait, wait

443
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:35,980
hold on, they don't deserve a rhyme

444
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:37,980
yeah, you can put it in the corner

445
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:39,980
I'm more comfortable

446
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:41,980
with that there

447
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:43,980
it's their fault for choosing words for things that don't have rhymes

448
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:47,980
I just, look

449
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:49,980
there's a war on Christmas

450
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:51,980
and truth is I

451
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:53,980
we gotta get it

452
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:55,980
we gotta get it more prominently displayed

453
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:57,980
the Christmas tree, you know

454
00:33:57,980 --> 00:33:59,980
and then there could be a little menorah in the corner

455
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:01,980
I for one am glad that in the next presidential election

456
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:03,980
everyone will be of the

457
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:05,980
ages of the people

458
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:07,980
in the golden age home

459
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:09,980
they're in the golden ages of their lives

460
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:11,980
they're in their primes

461
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:13,980
I don't want anyone

462
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:15,980
south of 50

463
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:17,980
running my country, I'll tell you that

464
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:19,980
I'd like Mr. Blair to run

465
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:21,980
as a third party maybe

466
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:23,980
but that's about it

467
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:25,980
I'm starting a fundraiser for Mr. Blair

468
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:27,980
Mr. Blair's got a lot of the same Robert F. Kennedy

469
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:29,980
beliefs which I'm

470
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:31,980
finding more appealing

471
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:33,980
day by day

472
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:35,980
the older I get the more I like the sound of it

473
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:39,980
so this is a nice song

474
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:41,980
a song

475
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:43,980
I'll say this, I don't even know you consider this a song

476
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:45,980
it's technically a song

477
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:47,980
with melodies and stuff but it's not

478
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:49,980
so memorable

479
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:51,980
da da da da da

480
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:53,980
you say that but it's possible I wake up from a sound sleep tonight

481
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:55,980
da da da da da

482
00:34:57,980 --> 00:34:59,980
it's a nightmare version of

483
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:01,980
Rock Around the Plants

484
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:03,980
I found a table

485
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:05,980
clop of fine brown steel

486
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:07,980
the menorah

487
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,980
shines so brightly

488
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:11,980
say can I have a glass of milk

489
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:13,980
Anthony

490
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:15,980
it's so much fun

491
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:17,980
we are a band

492
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:19,980
hanging from the ledge

493
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:21,980
all the other

494
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:23,980
beds are sparring

495
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:25,980
the tinsel is so shiny

496
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:27,980
well everything is ready

497
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:29,980
there's nothing left to trim

498
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:31,980
we wish you joy

499
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:33,980
we wish you health

500
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:35,980
we wish you happy holidays

501
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:37,980
we wish you friends

502
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:39,980
and fun with love

503
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:41,980
and Anthony

504
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:43,980
Miguel and Joy

505
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:45,980
happy holidays to our friends of all ages

506
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:51,980
now with respect to all you seniors

507
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:53,980
I know some of you have your various

508
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:55,980
conditions or what have you

509
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:57,980
those kids and I

510
00:35:57,980 --> 00:35:59,980
just really sweated it out doing that dance

511
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:01,980
you stand up

512
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:03,980
you show us the respect you get on your feet

513
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:05,980
I don't care how your body feels

514
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:07,980
get up, you, all of you

515
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:09,980
nurses

516
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:11,980
make them stand

517
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:13,980
pull their chairs out

518
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:15,980
please clap

519
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:17,980
I can't hear you

520
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:19,980
empty your

521
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:21,980
pockets

522
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:23,980
for gas money

523
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:25,980
we don't work for free

524
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:27,980
you know

525
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:29,980
while you've been applauding I've had Anthony

526
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:31,980
go through your stuff in your personal rooms

527
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:33,980
I've flexed a lot of you

528
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:35,980
the trick worked

529
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:37,980
we're in

530
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:39,980
all your wills now

531
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:41,980
McGruff and the gang

532
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:43,980
it says, you're leaving me that

533
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:45,980
menorah

534
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:47,980
I'm taking that

535
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:49,980
I'll put some real candles on there

536
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:51,980
put it on the top of my

537
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:53,980
Christ and Mary on them

538
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:55,980
put it on the top of my Christmas tree

539
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:57,980
it's a Christmas tree topper

540
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:01,980
Mr. Blair

541
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:03,980
McGruff just like

542
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:05,980
holding

543
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:07,980
like just right in front of his face

544
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:09,980
Mr. Blair screaming at him

545
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:15,980
some of these

546
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:17,980
okay, there's a song called

547
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:19,980
Heroes here

548
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:21,980
what do you mean we're not allowed back at Golden Age

549
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:23,980
to retire at home? We decorated

550
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:25,980
we put up a tinsel

551
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:27,980
we gave him some joy for once

552
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:29,980
you have to let me in, I have power of attorney

553
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:31,980
over most of these residents

554
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:37,980
I set up those wills, that's how I knew how to insert us in them

555
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:39,980
Mike, you keep holding the

556
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:41,980
puppet to your face

557
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:43,980
like he's whispering in your ear

558
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:45,980
yeah, yeah, I'm telling him what to do next

559
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:47,980
yeah, see what the top

560
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:49,980
of the clock tower is like

561
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:51,980
you can really toot some people up there

562
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:55,980
who's really running the show at this point

563
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:57,980
is it the McGruff voice or is it me

564
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:59,980
it's like the Twilight Zone episode

565
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:01,980
if listeners did a percentage breakdown

566
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:03,980
they'd probably

567
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:05,980
70% was McGruff voice, the rest was the hosts

568
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:07,980
I like when I have to

569
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:09,980
do something practical like move the computer a little

570
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:11,980
and I just like

571
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:13,980
wait let me document that, put your mouth on

572
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:15,980
yeah, you keep holding the corner

573
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:17,980
that's really cute actually

574
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:19,980
like this

575
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:23,980
okay, this song is called

576
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:25,980
McGruff's Holiday Surprise

577
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:27,980
oh no

578
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:29,980
it's not what you think

579
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:31,980
the golden age is getting a surprise

580
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:33,980
a big bag of my shit on the door

581
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:35,980
my chocolate chip cookie shit

582
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:41,980
they did it to me, Mrs. Carpenter

583
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:43,980
it was worth it though

584
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:45,980
hey McGruff

585
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:47,980
happy holidays

586
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:49,980
well happy holidays to you too

587
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:51,980
what's everybody doing here

588
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:53,980
we have a surprise for you

589
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:55,980
what's up for you McGruff

590
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:57,980
oh boy I like surprises

591
00:38:57,980 --> 00:38:59,980
is it that you all straightened up your rooms

592
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:01,980
no I mean we did

593
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:03,980
take me to all of your rooms

594
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:05,980
well is it that you

595
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:07,980
cleaned some graffiti up in your

596
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:09,980
neighborhoods

597
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:11,980
not really, uh no

598
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:13,980
since it's the holidays now, we're at five

599
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:15,980
each of us wanted to say thanks for everything

600
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:17,980
you taught us this past year

601
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,980
and show you how glad we are

602
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:21,980
that you're our friend

603
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:23,980
we've talked about this before, other songs

604
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:25,980
are very much into like

605
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:27,980
building up McGruff as like a Jesus-like

606
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:29,980
figure, and like you have to

607
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:31,980
praise him, and this is one of those

608
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:33,980
one of those songs where it's

609
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:35,980
like we gotta tell you how good you are, McGruff

610
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:37,980
let's hit it

611
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:39,980
McGruff, he is the cry dog

612
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:41,980
he's our friend

613
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:43,980
and there's no doubt

614
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:45,980
he's on the scene to talk about

615
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:47,980
what's really going down

616
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:49,980
what's really going down

617
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:51,980
need to double up

618
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:53,980
no matter what your problem is

619
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:55,980
I'll never let you take a fall

620
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:01,980
he's just sitting there not responding

621
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:03,980
positively or negatively

622
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:05,980
it's good, continue

623
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:07,980
it's a gift to song

624
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:09,980
I learned to speak up loud and clear

625
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:11,980
into the phone's mouthpiece

626
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:13,980
so he taught this

627
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:15,980
little girl how to talk into the phone's mouthpiece

628
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:17,980
she's claiming at least

629
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:19,980
closer, get it in there

630
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:21,980
hey dummy, flip it

631
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:23,980
it's not gonna bite you

632
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:25,980
I will if you don't get it right

633
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:27,980
don't remove the keys

634
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:29,980
from the phone

635
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:31,980
before you try to talk into it

636
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:33,980
come on, what are you doing

637
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:37,980
don't swallow it

638
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:39,980
you're dialing 818

639
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:41,980
you're pulling the 8 out of

640
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:43,980
the phone console itself, that's not how

641
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:45,980
it works, you have to hit the button

642
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:47,980
somebody needs to go to

643
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:49,980
how to 1 class again

644
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:53,980
I had a scare

645
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:55,980
with no one there, I smelled

646
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:57,980
some smoke, and then

647
00:40:57,980 --> 00:40:59,980
I dropped down low below

648
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:01,980
the smoke, got out and I ran

649
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:03,980
and ran, without

650
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:05,980
delay I sped away

651
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:07,980
and was helped by a friend

652
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:09,980
the fireman

653
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:11,980
came and saved the day

654
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:13,980
blasting on the truck siren

655
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:17,980
what does that have to do with McGruff

656
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:19,980
stay on topic

657
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:21,980
he's more like

658
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:23,980
Smokey the Bear's domain

659
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:25,980
right? don't say his name

660
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:27,980
I know, I taught him

661
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:29,980
about the smoke thing and how they gotta get

662
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:31,980
down and be careful

663
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:33,980
I helped the fire department out too if you

664
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:35,980
didn't know, he pretty much stole

665
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:37,980
it all, I set that fire to teach

666
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:39,980
a lesson

667
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:43,980
chaotic good

668
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:45,980
I was there in case it went bad, don't worry

669
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:47,980
I had an axe ready at the door

670
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:49,980
I had a dying extinguisher, it expired

671
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:51,980
but it was still good

672
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:53,980
it was like a David Fincher's the game

673
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:55,980
thing going, I created

674
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:57,980
a scenario, I was always in control

675
00:41:57,980 --> 00:41:59,980
she fell through the glass but there was padding

676
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:01,980
yeah, totally

677
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:03,980
controlled

678
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:05,980
so I guess they're thanking McGruff for that

679
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:07,980
I said

680
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:09,980
blasting on the truck siren

681
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:11,980
it's weird how he's

682
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:13,980
dropped off

683
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:15,980
yeah, he left, he's gone

684
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:17,980
you didn't even notice

685
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:19,980
you weren't paying attention to your surroundings

686
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:21,980
I'm in my home

687
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:23,980
I clocked out for the day

688
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:25,980
I left minutes ago

689
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:27,980
your rap wasn't good enough to keep

690
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:29,980
me here

691
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:31,980
my sister and her friends

692
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:33,980
and I walked away, cause we aren't

693
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:35,980
fools

694
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:37,980
you're just a loser

695
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:39,980
I'm always

696
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:41,980
a loser

697
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:43,980
you kids are winners

698
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:45,980
this is something we happened upon last time too

699
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:47,980
is that sometimes when McGruff is singing in these cassettes

700
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:49,980
he sounds completely drunk

701
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:51,980
I told you losers

702
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:53,980
I'm at home

703
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:55,980
I'm drinking with Johnny Walker

704
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:57,980
my friend

705
00:42:57,980 --> 00:42:59,980
McGruff, you're drunk

706
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:01,980
yeah, so he

707
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:03,980
sounds like that for some reason in these cassettes

708
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:05,980
just say no

709
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:07,980
thanks a lot from Joy

710
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:09,980
Anthony, Miguel

711
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:11,980
and Anne

712
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:13,980
and we know there are many more

713
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:15,980
who will be joining in

714
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:17,980
so McGruff, they're thanking him for

715
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:19,980
teaching them how to use a phone

716
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:21,980
in general

717
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:23,980
and then knowing

718
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:25,980
to get out of the house when there's a fire

719
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:27,980
and then three, saying no to drugs

720
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:29,980
which is something we know he says

721
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:31,980
that's a thing we've heard him say

722
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:33,980
but they're attributing a lot to him here

723
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:35,980
they could have put this in a card

724
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:37,980
well that's true

725
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:39,980
because then at least he could put it on the mantel place

726
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:41,980
you know

727
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:43,980
but it's still like, thank you McGruff

728
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:45,980
for teaching me how to eat

729
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:47,980
meals are so much better now

730
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:49,980
I used to put the food

731
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:51,980
on the floor

732
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:53,980
and now I'm no longer

733
00:43:53,980 --> 00:43:55,980
doing that

734
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:57,980
plates don't work upside down

735
00:43:57,980 --> 00:43:59,980
I have an adult friend coming over

736
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:01,980
we haven't really had the conversation yet

737
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:03,980
so it's more of a situation

738
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:05,980
you know what

739
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:07,980
it'd be best if you kids got out of here

740
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:09,980
yeah but

741
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:11,980
tell me what all their good stuff

742
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:13,980
but write it down

743
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:15,980
I'll hear it later

744
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:17,980
I'll peruse it at my own time

745
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:19,980
Mrs. McGruff

746
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:21,980
oh Jesus, not Mrs.

747
00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:23,980
don't tell Mrs. McGruff

748
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:25,980
I'm not telling, I'm not doing marriage game

749
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:27,980
but Mrs. McGruff doesn't know

750
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:29,980
it's me and Bill

751
00:44:29,980 --> 00:44:31,980
Marr have the same opinion about marriage

752
00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:35,980
she doesn't know I rent at this apartment

753
00:44:35,980 --> 00:44:37,980
address so

754
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:39,980
we both have about 7 young

755
00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:41,980
girlfriends, we rotate

756
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:43,980
that's what he does, that's what I do

757
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:45,980
I take my cue from him

758
00:44:45,980 --> 00:44:47,980
is her 23, mine are 2

759
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:49,980
it's okay

760
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:51,980
it's different with dogs

761
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:53,980
I also only eat seeds regularly

762
00:44:53,980 --> 00:44:55,980
that's basic

763
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:57,980
he got it for me

764
00:44:57,980 --> 00:44:59,980
he's scurrying about at the base of a tree

765
00:44:59,980 --> 00:45:01,980
then he started doing it too

766
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:03,980
he got it all on his hind legs

767
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:05,980
num num num seeds he said

768
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:07,980
we'll talk about it on our

769
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:09,980
episode when it comes out

770
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:11,980
now you

771
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:13,980
I taught you the seed thing

772
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:15,980
you don't ever give me credit

773
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:17,980
what's up with that Bill

774
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:19,980
I'm getting loose

775
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:21,980
I gotta watch my mouth

776
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:23,980
I'm gonna end up saying

777
00:45:23,980 --> 00:45:25,980
say yes to drugs

778
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:27,980
I can't have that on tape, cut that

779
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:29,980
cut that

780
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:31,980
I think my acid

781
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:33,980
reflux is being triggered by the McGruff voice

782
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:35,980
oh no, it's okay

783
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:37,980
then Mike threw up onto the microphone

784
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:41,980
it's worth it

785
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:43,980
retiring that windshield

786
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:45,980
it's yellow stain

787
00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:47,980
none of us have puked during an episode yet

788
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:49,980
that'll be interesting

789
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:51,980
or come close

790
00:45:51,980 --> 00:45:53,980
let's see how much Green Day talk

791
00:45:53,980 --> 00:45:55,980
there is in 2024

792
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:57,980
I'll tell you what, the punk band

793
00:45:57,980 --> 00:45:59,980
I like, the only good one

794
00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:01,980
the only one

795
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:03,980
we haven't talked about that on the show

796
00:46:03,980 --> 00:46:05,980
we don't have time, but we found

797
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:07,980
this was a Tim Heidecker find

798
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:09,980
that he and Sharpling talked about it

799
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:11,980
that there's an episode where

800
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:13,980
Bill Maher just, I hate all punk music

801
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:15,980
it's all junk, it's all three chord

802
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:17,980
crap, and then who is it

803
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:19,980
is it Jeff Ross

804
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:21,980
in a remote of The Clash

805
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:23,980
crap, bunch of crap, fuck The Clash

806
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:25,980
crap, you know there's one

807
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:27,980
punk band I like though, Green Day

808
00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:29,980
now those guys

809
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:31,980
now that American idiot

810
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:33,980
that's perfect, that is great

811
00:46:33,980 --> 00:46:35,980
so never forget

812
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:37,980
Mike has the same taste in punk music

813
00:46:37,980 --> 00:46:39,980
well, hold on

814
00:46:41,980 --> 00:46:43,980
it's funny, because the first wave of

815
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:45,980
punk music is like 50

816
00:46:45,980 --> 00:46:47,980
years old, and Green Day

817
00:46:47,980 --> 00:46:49,980
early Green Day is like 30

818
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:51,980
years old, yeah that's why they perfected

819
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:53,980
it, they got around

820
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:55,980
to see what didn't work

821
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:57,980
toss that in the garbage

822
00:46:57,980 --> 00:46:59,980
yeah, yeah, we gotta go

823
00:46:59,980 --> 00:47:01,980
on Club Random, I gotta find out more

824
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:03,980
I wanna know, I don't know, yeah I think

825
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:05,980
that's a, all three of us wouldn't go on Club Random

826
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:07,980
I think that's a one, yeah

827
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:09,980
we don't wanna get in the way

828
00:47:09,980 --> 00:47:11,980
I wanna be photographed in the same frame

829
00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:13,980
you guys at 5am

830
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:15,980
like, oh and here I go

831
00:47:15,980 --> 00:47:17,980
now I'm gonna put on 21 guns

832
00:47:17,980 --> 00:47:19,980
oh perfect, listen to that on my

833
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:21,980
hi-fi, that sounds perfect

834
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:23,980
hey uh, should I bring the girls

835
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:25,980
in?

836
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:27,980
they've been

837
00:47:27,980 --> 00:47:29,980
they've been doing

838
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:31,980
a lot of pills in the pool house

839
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:33,980
as I told them to for hours

840
00:47:33,980 --> 00:47:35,980
Mike, I'm willing to introduce

841
00:47:35,980 --> 00:47:37,980
you, I'm married

842
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:39,980
so pfff, not

843
00:47:39,980 --> 00:47:41,980
in Club Random you aren't, nah the roles

844
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:43,980
are different, McGruff's there

845
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:45,980
too, I'm here too, yeah

846
00:47:45,980 --> 00:47:47,980
McGruff

847
00:47:47,980 --> 00:47:49,980
you guys like the album

848
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:51,980
Nimrod?

849
00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:53,980
it's a good one

850
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:55,980
it's pretty, you know what, they honestly

851
00:47:55,980 --> 00:47:57,980
they get into kind of the musical stuff

852
00:47:57,980 --> 00:47:59,980
and that's what I, the albums are statements

853
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:01,980
and there's a reason it made it

854
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:03,980
to the Broadway stage, because that is

855
00:48:03,980 --> 00:48:05,980
songwriting, yeah

856
00:48:05,980 --> 00:48:07,980
yeah, I like to see the Ramones do

857
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:09,980
that

858
00:48:09,980 --> 00:48:11,980
make a eight minutes

859
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:13,980
Buzzcocks, I'm offended by the name

860
00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:15,980
bleh

861
00:48:15,980 --> 00:48:17,980
makes me wanna puke

862
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:19,980
or shit out chocolate chip cookies

863
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:21,980
sexy pistols, that's filth

864
00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:23,980
I'm offended before

865
00:48:23,980 --> 00:48:25,980
I've even read the album title

866
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:27,980
sex walk away, pistol leave it there

867
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:29,980
hahahaha

868
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:33,980
uh, uh, alright

869
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:35,980
okay, let's see here, okay

870
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:37,980
uh, oh god, the resolute, I think this one's

871
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:39,980
really boring but I'm gonna play it

872
00:48:39,980 --> 00:48:41,980
Resolutions is what this is called, because

873
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:43,980
it's the end of the year

874
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:45,980
McGruff, my sister said she's

875
00:48:45,980 --> 00:48:47,980
making a list of New Year's resolutions

876
00:48:47,980 --> 00:48:49,980
for next year, what's a resolution?

877
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:51,980
well a New Year's resolution

878
00:48:51,980 --> 00:48:53,980
is usually a promise you make to yourself

879
00:48:53,980 --> 00:48:55,980
you've entrusted me into the program

880
00:48:55,980 --> 00:48:57,980
to try to do something better for yourself

881
00:48:57,980 --> 00:48:59,980
or for others in the coming year

882
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:01,980
who wants to make a New Year's resolution?

883
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:03,980
I do

884
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:05,980
my grandpa's friend Barney

885
00:49:05,980 --> 00:49:07,980
he lives all alone

886
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:09,980
except for his strife cat

887
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:11,980
named Blue

888
00:49:11,980 --> 00:49:13,980
I know he gets lonely

889
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:15,980
when grandpa can't come

890
00:49:15,980 --> 00:49:17,980
so I think I'll go visit him too

891
00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:19,980
what a great idea

892
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:21,980
lots of terrific older folks

893
00:49:21,980 --> 00:49:23,980
who maybe can't get around so well

894
00:49:23,980 --> 00:49:25,980
would love to have regular visits from you

895
00:49:25,980 --> 00:49:27,980
theme

896
00:49:27,980 --> 00:49:29,980
I put a theme in it like Green Day

897
00:49:29,980 --> 00:49:31,980
coloring motifs

898
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:33,980
what about you, Miguel?

899
00:49:33,980 --> 00:49:35,980
on Saturday mornings

900
00:49:35,980 --> 00:49:37,980
I'm taking my bike

901
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:39,980
down to our community square

902
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:43,980
it's gotten so messy

903
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:45,980
from littering folks

904
00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:47,980
I'll help pick up all the trash there

905
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:49,980
terrific

906
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:51,980
lots of neighborhoods have community centers

907
00:49:51,980 --> 00:49:53,980
needing volunteers to help with all kinds

908
00:49:53,980 --> 00:49:55,980
of activities

909
00:49:55,980 --> 00:49:57,980
giving them your morning

910
00:49:57,980 --> 00:49:59,980
will make anything you do in the afternoon

911
00:49:59,980 --> 00:50:01,980
twice as much fun

912
00:50:01,980 --> 00:50:03,980
because you can feel really proud

913
00:50:03,980 --> 00:50:05,980
of being a volunteer

914
00:50:05,980 --> 00:50:07,980
I noticed a sign

915
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:09,980
in the grocery store

916
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:11,980
help, we need a sitter

917
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:13,980
it read

918
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:15,980
for a three year old girl

919
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:17,980
that's for money

920
00:50:17,980 --> 00:50:19,980
that's not going to count

921
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:21,980
volunteering is what we're talking about

922
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:23,980
hey hey

923
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:25,980
babysitting is a tremendous responsibility

924
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:27,980
so lots of what you've learned

925
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:29,980
about locking doors

926
00:50:29,980 --> 00:50:31,980
and knowing important phone numbers

927
00:50:31,980 --> 00:50:33,980
can really help you here

928
00:50:33,980 --> 00:50:35,980
I see Anthony has one too

929
00:50:35,980 --> 00:50:37,980
clean up all the graffiti in their house

930
00:50:37,980 --> 00:50:39,980
a lot of this is trying to figure out

931
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:41,980
how to get free labor out of children

932
00:50:41,980 --> 00:50:43,980
yeah, that's the resolution

933
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:45,980
is I'm going to answer a stranger

934
00:50:45,980 --> 00:50:47,980
wait, a stranger's ad

935
00:50:47,980 --> 00:50:49,980
at the grocery store

936
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:51,980
also grandpa's friend, you're going alone

937
00:50:51,980 --> 00:50:53,980
to hang out with grandpa's friend?

938
00:50:53,980 --> 00:50:55,980
that's what they said, right?

939
00:50:55,980 --> 00:50:57,980
yeah, grandpa's friend

940
00:50:57,980 --> 00:50:59,980
his friend's a grandpa, he's not a stranger

941
00:50:59,980 --> 00:51:01,980
because McGruff has the criteria

942
00:51:01,980 --> 00:51:03,980
for if this is a stranger or not

943
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:05,980
so I guess grandpa's friend

944
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:07,980
would

945
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:09,980
can he be not a stranger?

946
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:11,980
presumably grandpa's been over

947
00:51:11,980 --> 00:51:13,980
had him over for dinner

948
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:15,980
yeah, but what if it's grandpa's friend just in the home

949
00:51:15,980 --> 00:51:17,980
and it's more of like a new friendship

950
00:51:17,980 --> 00:51:19,980
and he doesn't know

951
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:21,980
like, I don't know

952
00:51:21,980 --> 00:51:23,980
that could be a little dicey

953
00:51:23,980 --> 00:51:25,980
this seems like a city that should reallocate

954
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:27,980
some funds to community centers

955
00:51:27,980 --> 00:51:29,980
and elderly care

956
00:51:29,980 --> 00:51:31,980
well, I'm fighting with myself

957
00:51:31,980 --> 00:51:33,980
with my thoughts

958
00:51:33,980 --> 00:51:35,980
I think that we should maybe

959
00:51:35,980 --> 00:51:37,980
just use an army of children

960
00:51:37,980 --> 00:51:39,980
to fix a lot of the problems in society

961
00:51:39,980 --> 00:51:41,980
army of children, all the budget goes to the cops

962
00:51:41,980 --> 00:51:43,980
to buy tanks

963
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:45,980
yeah, there you go

964
00:51:45,980 --> 00:51:47,980
that cops need cooler tanks

965
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:49,980
qualified immunity is expensive

966
00:51:49,980 --> 00:51:51,980
they need to get those

967
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:53,980
big exoskeletons like in Aliens

968
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:55,980
like the big walkers

969
00:51:55,980 --> 00:51:57,980
every cop needs a mech

970
00:51:57,980 --> 00:51:59,980
I think, we talked about this last time

971
00:51:59,980 --> 00:52:01,980
this feels familiar

972
00:52:01,980 --> 00:52:03,980
well, any kid can be

973
00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:05,980
adult sized if put in a mech suit

974
00:52:05,980 --> 00:52:07,980
yeah, but those are for the cops

975
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:09,980
not kids

976
00:52:09,980 --> 00:52:11,980
well, I think

977
00:52:11,980 --> 00:52:13,980
I disagree with you, other McGruff

978
00:52:13,980 --> 00:52:15,980
but it turns a cop

979
00:52:15,980 --> 00:52:17,980
into a super sized man

980
00:52:17,980 --> 00:52:19,980
but it turns a little kid into a ripple

981
00:52:19,980 --> 00:52:21,980
grown adult

982
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:23,980
who can clean up graffiti for free

983
00:52:23,980 --> 00:52:25,980
money goes to suits, doesn't it kids?

984
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:27,980
we should

985
00:52:27,980 --> 00:52:29,980
find a kid in a mech suit

986
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:31,980
to babysit your child

987
00:52:31,980 --> 00:52:33,980
if a stranger comes to the door

988
00:52:33,980 --> 00:52:35,980
super babysitter

989
00:52:35,980 --> 00:52:37,980
they'll be able to kill them

990
00:52:37,980 --> 00:52:39,980
quickly like Robocop

991
00:52:39,980 --> 00:52:41,980
crush their heads in

992
00:52:41,980 --> 00:52:43,980
so yeah, resolutions

993
00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:45,980
yeah, okay, resolution

994
00:52:45,980 --> 00:52:47,980
you go visit an old person

995
00:52:47,980 --> 00:52:49,980
but then yeah, babysitting

996
00:52:49,980 --> 00:52:51,980
is also

997
00:52:51,980 --> 00:52:53,980
a resolution

998
00:52:53,980 --> 00:52:55,980
I answered

999
00:52:55,980 --> 00:52:57,980
an ad in the grocery store

1000
00:52:57,980 --> 00:52:59,980
it said, I want one little

1001
00:52:59,980 --> 00:53:01,980
girl to come over soon

1002
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:03,980
no questions asked

1003
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:05,980
we swear it's for babysitting

1004
00:53:05,980 --> 00:53:07,980
and not for anything

1005
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:09,980
else, sounds good, no red flags

1006
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:11,980
there, glad you took the number

1007
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:13,980
give them a call, get over there ASAP

1008
00:53:13,980 --> 00:53:15,980
make sure you say it out loud on New

1009
00:53:15,980 --> 00:53:17,980
Year's Eve

1010
00:53:17,980 --> 00:53:19,980
keep an eye out though

1011
00:53:19,980 --> 00:53:21,980
if the family is too perfect

1012
00:53:21,980 --> 00:53:23,980
like a running scared situation

1013
00:53:23,980 --> 00:53:25,980
hey kids, you wanna watch

1014
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:27,980
this R rated movie, running

1015
00:53:27,980 --> 00:53:29,980
scared, so you can learn

1016
00:53:29,980 --> 00:53:31,980
things, I don't think I know what the situation

1017
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:33,980
in running scared is, there is

1018
00:53:33,980 --> 00:53:35,980
a thing where it's like

1019
00:53:35,980 --> 00:53:37,980
serial killers

1020
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:39,980
and they look very like

1021
00:53:39,980 --> 00:53:41,980
leave it to beaver and stuff

1022
00:53:41,980 --> 00:53:43,980
and they're killing kids and other people

1023
00:53:43,980 --> 00:53:45,980
that's what happens in the Billy Crystal movie

1024
00:53:45,980 --> 00:53:47,980
running scared, no, no, the Paul Walker

1025
00:53:47,980 --> 00:53:49,980
movie running scared, oh gosh

1026
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:51,980
cause I only know the Billy Crystal one

1027
00:53:51,980 --> 00:53:53,980
has the Michael McDonald song Sweet Freedom

1028
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:55,980
which is a lot of tropical fun

1029
00:53:55,980 --> 00:53:57,980
I bet this doesn't have like child

1030
00:53:57,980 --> 00:53:59,980
murders in it or whatever

1031
00:53:59,980 --> 00:54:01,980
do you think McGruff's watching

1032
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:03,980
a movie where they're

1033
00:54:03,980 --> 00:54:05,980
portraying a leave it to beaver type family

1034
00:54:05,980 --> 00:54:07,980
as evil, that's

1035
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:09,980
that's not correct

1036
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:11,980
people that look like that are good

1037
00:54:11,980 --> 00:54:13,980
they're always doing right, yes

1038
00:54:13,980 --> 00:54:15,980
pipe smoking dads are the perfect

1039
00:54:15,980 --> 00:54:17,980
dads and white children are the best

1040
00:54:17,980 --> 00:54:19,980
rappers, white

1041
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:21,980
50's people never

1042
00:54:21,980 --> 00:54:23,980
did nothing wrong

1043
00:54:23,980 --> 00:54:25,980
remember that

1044
00:54:25,980 --> 00:54:27,980
and the media they produced also

1045
00:54:27,980 --> 00:54:29,980
was right, so Paul

1046
00:54:29,980 --> 00:54:31,980
Walker, God rest his soul though

1047
00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:33,980
I don't want to disrespect

1048
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:35,980
but I don't like

1049
00:54:35,980 --> 00:54:37,980
the type of film he made

1050
00:54:37,980 --> 00:54:39,980
Pleasantville either

1051
00:54:39,980 --> 00:54:41,980
with all it's orgasming and stuff

1052
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:43,980
oh yeah, it's about upending 50's

1053
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:45,980
too much criticism in that movie

1054
00:54:45,980 --> 00:54:47,980
I don't want to hear it

1055
00:54:47,980 --> 00:54:49,980
I plug my big ear dog ears

1056
00:54:49,980 --> 00:54:51,980
I liked the beginning before

1057
00:54:51,980 --> 00:54:53,980
it tilted, before the

1058
00:54:53,980 --> 00:54:55,980
premise kicked in, I did hear that this show

1059
00:54:55,980 --> 00:54:57,980
talks a lot about a guy named Don Knotts

1060
00:54:57,980 --> 00:54:59,980
I do like

1061
00:54:59,980 --> 00:55:01,980
the sound of that folks

1062
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:03,980
and there's a repairman

1063
00:55:03,980 --> 00:55:05,980
excuse me, let's go to

1064
00:55:05,980 --> 00:55:07,980
Santa's Helpers

1065
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:09,980
I will tell you a story that is quite true

1066
00:55:09,980 --> 00:55:11,980
it was told to me by a caribou

1067
00:55:11,980 --> 00:55:13,980
who lived up near the cold north pole

1068
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:15,980
he said it's true and he ought to know

1069
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:17,980
tell us, tell us, let us know

1070
00:55:17,980 --> 00:55:19,980
what the caribou said from the land of snow

1071
00:55:19,980 --> 00:55:21,980
he said

1072
00:55:21,980 --> 00:55:23,980
in Santa's workshop

1073
00:55:23,980 --> 00:55:25,980
there were two elves

1074
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:27,980
and they were

1075
00:55:27,980 --> 00:55:29,980
the elves were the ones

1076
00:55:29,980 --> 00:55:31,980
who were the most beautiful

1077
00:55:31,980 --> 00:55:33,980
and the elves were the ones

1078
00:55:33,980 --> 00:55:35,980
who were the most beautiful

1079
00:55:35,980 --> 00:55:37,980
there were two elves

1080
00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:39,980
whose department painted

1081
00:55:39,980 --> 00:55:41,980
all the shelves

1082
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:43,980
where brand new toys

1083
00:55:43,980 --> 00:55:45,980
were put away

1084
00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:47,980
waiting to be delivered

1085
00:55:47,980 --> 00:55:49,980
on Christmas day

1086
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:51,980
one was named Wink

1087
00:55:51,980 --> 00:55:53,980
the other was Bip

1088
00:55:53,980 --> 00:55:55,980
while one worked hard

1089
00:55:55,980 --> 00:55:57,980
the other was Flip

1090
00:55:57,980 --> 00:55:59,980
Wink was happy to share a task

1091
00:55:59,980 --> 00:56:01,980
the one called Bip

1092
00:56:01,980 --> 00:56:03,980
would never think to ask

1093
00:56:03,980 --> 00:56:05,980
Elf or Wink

1094
00:56:05,980 --> 00:56:07,980
was very elfish

1095
00:56:07,980 --> 00:56:09,980
the way we all should be

1096
00:56:09,980 --> 00:56:11,980
wait, elfish is good?

1097
00:56:11,980 --> 00:56:13,980
yeah

1098
00:56:13,980 --> 00:56:15,980
wait

1099
00:56:15,980 --> 00:56:17,980
that's really confusing

1100
00:56:17,980 --> 00:56:19,980
elfish is good but selfish is bad?

1101
00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:21,980
we gotta be very clear here

1102
00:56:21,980 --> 00:56:23,980
Wink is an elf

1103
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:25,980
and he is very elfish

1104
00:56:25,980 --> 00:56:27,980
he's helpful

1105
00:56:27,980 --> 00:56:29,980
and Bip is an elf who is selfish

1106
00:56:29,980 --> 00:56:31,980
and if you heard her just sing

1107
00:56:31,980 --> 00:56:33,980
it led to his misery

1108
00:56:33,980 --> 00:56:35,980
oh god

1109
00:56:35,980 --> 00:56:37,980
this is a story song about two elves

1110
00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:39,980
Wink and Bip

1111
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:41,980
original characters as far as I know

1112
00:56:41,980 --> 00:56:43,980
this is like a goofus and gallant situation

1113
00:56:43,980 --> 00:56:45,980
yes

1114
00:56:45,980 --> 00:56:47,980
but Bip is riddled with misery

1115
00:56:47,980 --> 00:56:49,980
I was gonna say goofus wasn't riddled with misery

1116
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:51,980
was he? he should have been

1117
00:56:51,980 --> 00:56:53,980
I'd like to make Bip

1118
00:56:53,980 --> 00:56:55,980
do an ice walk like in Dark Knight Rises

1119
00:56:55,980 --> 00:56:57,980
I hope that

1120
00:56:57,980 --> 00:56:59,980
I hope it cracks it within five steps

1121
00:56:59,980 --> 00:57:01,980
Bip should be

1122
00:57:01,980 --> 00:57:03,980
in the cold brink

1123
00:57:03,980 --> 00:57:05,980
Bip might get some of that visual anti-justice

1124
00:57:05,980 --> 00:57:07,980
that Vera Farmiga

1125
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:09,980
dishes out in Running Scared

1126
00:57:09,980 --> 00:57:11,980
my favorite film

1127
00:57:11,980 --> 00:57:13,980
I can't look away

1128
00:57:13,980 --> 00:57:15,980
I hate it but I can't not watch it

1129
00:57:15,980 --> 00:57:17,980
uh

1130
00:57:17,980 --> 00:57:19,980
McGruff yeah so this is

1131
00:57:19,980 --> 00:57:21,980
these are original McGruff characters too

1132
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:23,980
Bip and Wink

1133
00:57:23,980 --> 00:57:25,980
but the

1134
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:27,980
elfish is good

1135
00:57:27,980 --> 00:57:29,980
elfish yeah

1136
00:57:45,980 --> 00:57:47,980
why are the

1137
00:57:47,980 --> 00:57:49,980
it's like people that have never written a song

1138
00:57:49,980 --> 00:57:51,980
writing all the melodies for this

1139
00:57:51,980 --> 00:57:53,980
as they go

1140
00:57:53,980 --> 00:57:55,980
this is like the improv

1141
00:57:55,980 --> 00:57:57,980
piano guy at the Chicago

1142
00:57:57,980 --> 00:57:59,980
Laura Hall on the piano

1143
00:57:59,980 --> 00:58:01,980
yeah

1144
00:58:25,980 --> 00:58:27,980
well you know

1145
00:58:27,980 --> 00:58:29,980
worker hourly worker rights

1146
00:58:29,980 --> 00:58:31,980
Bip might be in the right here

1147
00:58:31,980 --> 00:58:33,980
you don't make this a workers rights issue Jason

1148
00:58:33,980 --> 00:58:35,980
if they're not paying

1149
00:58:35,980 --> 00:58:37,980
time and a half or double time

1150
00:58:37,980 --> 00:58:39,980
you know you gotta they'll find a way to screw you

1151
00:58:39,980 --> 00:58:41,980
you've got the right to do the work

1152
00:58:41,980 --> 00:58:43,980
I tell you to do

1153
00:58:43,980 --> 00:58:45,980
keep your mouth shut

1154
00:58:45,980 --> 00:58:47,980
you want me to replace these names with two regular names

1155
00:58:47,980 --> 00:58:49,980
for people that work at a McDonald's

1156
00:58:49,980 --> 00:58:51,980
cause I feel the same way

1157
00:58:51,980 --> 00:58:53,980
you gotta be positive all the time

1158
00:58:53,980 --> 00:58:55,980
happy with whatever lot you've gotten in life

1159
00:58:55,980 --> 00:58:57,980
when I order at the drive through

1160
00:58:57,980 --> 00:58:59,980
I always say alright an egg McMuffin

1161
00:58:59,980 --> 00:59:01,980
and a coffee

1162
00:59:01,980 --> 00:59:03,980
hey and keep it elfish back there

1163
00:59:03,980 --> 00:59:05,980
I want to see everyone's face at the window

1164
00:59:05,980 --> 00:59:07,980
Merry Christmas

1165
00:59:07,980 --> 00:59:09,980
I didn't see a smile

1166
00:59:09,980 --> 00:59:11,980
a big smile there

1167
00:59:11,980 --> 00:59:13,980
I wanna can I lean my head in the window too

1168
00:59:13,980 --> 00:59:15,980
and see the guys making the burgers

1169
00:59:15,980 --> 00:59:17,980
I want to see that they're laughing

1170
00:59:17,980 --> 00:59:19,980
and having a good time

1171
00:59:19,980 --> 00:59:21,980
I want to see the guys

1172
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:23,980
laughing and having a good time

1173
00:59:23,980 --> 00:59:25,980
let me touch some of your machines

1174
00:59:25,980 --> 00:59:27,980
and make sure they're properly calibrated

1175
00:59:27,980 --> 00:59:29,980
let me behind the counter

1176
00:59:29,980 --> 00:59:31,980
I want to get back there

1177
00:59:31,980 --> 00:59:33,980
put an apron on

1178
00:59:33,980 --> 00:59:35,980
uh yeah

1179
00:59:35,980 --> 00:59:37,980
so this is uh

1180
00:59:37,980 --> 00:59:39,980
just I guess they're trying to say you should be

1181
00:59:39,980 --> 00:59:41,980
helpful and not unpleasant

1182
00:59:41,980 --> 00:59:43,980
which I suppose is a decent

1183
00:59:43,980 --> 00:59:45,980
lesson I guess but I don't know what

1184
00:59:45,980 --> 00:59:47,980
McGruff is trying to say

1185
00:59:47,980 --> 00:59:49,980
they're really reaching on McGruff's

1186
00:59:49,980 --> 00:59:51,980
created for here

1187
00:59:51,980 --> 00:59:53,980
he's like they're trying to make him like a catch all

1188
00:59:53,980 --> 00:59:55,980
for just like advice for children

1189
00:59:55,980 --> 00:59:57,980
yeah yeah it's not just law

1190
00:59:57,980 --> 00:59:59,980
it's basic morality

1191
00:59:59,980 --> 01:00:01,980
it's yeah well based on morality

1192
01:00:01,980 --> 01:00:03,980
but basically just like getting bought like

1193
01:00:03,980 --> 01:00:05,980
like if you're on a first date

1194
01:00:05,980 --> 01:00:07,980
always ask questions about the other person

1195
01:00:07,980 --> 01:00:09,980
yeah like

1196
01:00:09,980 --> 01:00:11,980
why would that be McGruff but that seems like that could be

1197
01:00:11,980 --> 01:00:13,980
in there if there's time to

1198
01:00:13,980 --> 01:00:15,980
lean there's time to clean

1199
01:00:15,980 --> 01:00:17,980
children have no right to privacy

1200
01:00:17,980 --> 01:00:19,980
and are their parents property

1201
01:00:19,980 --> 01:00:21,980
uh McGruff would be

1202
01:00:21,980 --> 01:00:23,980
tuck your shirt in while you're in

1203
01:00:23,980 --> 01:00:25,980
it shows disrespect

1204
01:00:25,980 --> 01:00:27,980
I'm happy with what the speaker of the house and his son

1205
01:00:27,980 --> 01:00:29,980
are doing

1206
01:00:29,980 --> 01:00:31,980
keep each other honest

1207
01:00:31,980 --> 01:00:33,980
I have encouraged

1208
01:00:33,980 --> 01:00:35,980
wink and bip to

1209
01:00:35,980 --> 01:00:37,980
be on a chain

1210
01:00:37,980 --> 01:00:39,980
where one is alerted if

1211
01:00:39,980 --> 01:00:41,980
the other is being selfish

1212
01:00:41,980 --> 01:00:43,980
but both are rewarded with a nice

1213
01:00:43,980 --> 01:00:45,980
vibrate if they're both

1214
01:00:45,980 --> 01:00:47,980
being elfish

1215
01:00:47,980 --> 01:00:49,980
uh so I wonder if they I

1216
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:51,980
don't there was a book somebody sent me a book

1217
01:00:51,980 --> 01:00:53,980
and we looked at it last time

1218
01:00:53,980 --> 01:00:55,980
and it was it was not it didn't have

1219
01:00:55,980 --> 01:00:57,980
like a lot of notes about the songs but I wonder

1220
01:00:57,980 --> 01:00:59,980
if there was ever any like

1221
01:00:59,980 --> 01:01:01,980
artwork of wink and biff I don't think

1222
01:01:01,980 --> 01:01:03,980
a bit excuse me I call them biff

1223
01:01:03,980 --> 01:01:05,980
wink and biff whatever

1224
01:01:05,980 --> 01:01:09,980
I thought of this in two fucking minutes

1225
01:01:09,980 --> 01:01:11,980
oh the puppets nodding off

1226
01:01:11,980 --> 01:01:13,980
like

1227
01:01:13,980 --> 01:01:15,980
I'm tired

1228
01:01:15,980 --> 01:01:17,980
how do you do this for so long

1229
01:01:17,980 --> 01:01:19,980
keep it short and sweet

1230
01:01:19,980 --> 01:01:21,980
like smartless

1231
01:01:21,980 --> 01:01:23,980
they get what their points

1232
01:01:23,980 --> 01:01:25,980
out in a nice tidy

1233
01:01:25,980 --> 01:01:27,980
hour I assume

1234
01:01:27,980 --> 01:01:29,980
and they got big stars too have you ever had

1235
01:01:29,980 --> 01:01:31,980
Tina Fey on this

1236
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:33,980
well they're friends or it's tough

1237
01:01:33,980 --> 01:01:35,980
we have who we like but we don't you know

1238
01:01:35,980 --> 01:01:37,980
we don't know everybody

1239
01:01:37,980 --> 01:01:39,980
bossy pants writer Tina Fey on here

1240
01:01:39,980 --> 01:01:41,980
I ain't thinking of this as legitimate

1241
01:01:41,980 --> 01:01:43,980
you dipshits don't seem to have any

1242
01:01:43,980 --> 01:01:45,980
stories about making Will & Grace

1243
01:01:45,980 --> 01:01:47,980
laughter

1244
01:01:47,980 --> 01:01:49,980
laughter

1245
01:01:49,980 --> 01:01:51,980
I like when Debra

1246
01:01:51,980 --> 01:01:53,980
messing tweets that's all I know

1247
01:01:53,980 --> 01:01:55,980
laughter

1248
01:01:55,980 --> 01:01:57,980
wait was she Will & Grace yes

1249
01:01:57,980 --> 01:01:59,980

1250
01:01:59,980 --> 01:02:01,980
Jenna Elfman is Dharma & Greg okay got it

1251
01:02:01,980 --> 01:02:03,980
I don't know what she tweets about

1252
01:02:03,980 --> 01:02:05,980
we need their voices right now with what's going on

1253
01:02:05,980 --> 01:02:07,980
in the world

1254
01:02:07,980 --> 01:02:09,980
uh let's see

1255
01:02:09,980 --> 01:02:11,980
tomorrow please

1256
01:02:11,980 --> 01:02:13,980
those bright red those snow white

1257
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:15,980
those deep green

1258
01:02:15,980 --> 01:02:17,980
Biff stared up and cried

1259
01:02:17,980 --> 01:02:19,980
out to himself it can't

1260
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:21,980
be done it's too much hay for

1261
01:02:21,980 --> 01:02:23,980
one elf Biff worked past

1262
01:02:23,980 --> 01:02:25,980
8pm he worked past

1263
01:02:25,980 --> 01:02:27,980
10 and he worked till 8

1264
01:02:27,980 --> 01:02:29,980
o'clock came around

1265
01:02:29,980 --> 01:02:31,980
again yet as the sun

1266
01:02:31,980 --> 01:02:33,980
played peekaboo

1267
01:02:33,980 --> 01:02:35,980
Biff still had

1268
01:02:35,980 --> 01:02:37,980
over half the shills to do

1269
01:02:37,980 --> 01:02:39,980
outlawing

1270
01:02:39,980 --> 01:02:41,980
now it's starting to seem like

1271
01:02:41,980 --> 01:02:43,980
slavery like now it's starting to seem

1272
01:02:43,980 --> 01:02:45,980
like a worker abuse

1273
01:02:45,980 --> 01:02:47,980
the first set of musicians

1274
01:02:47,980 --> 01:02:49,980
on this record were a bunch of Biffs

1275
01:02:49,980 --> 01:02:51,980
where are they today

1276
01:02:51,980 --> 01:02:53,980
well they're all a bunch of drips

1277
01:02:53,980 --> 01:02:55,980
they ain't got no music

1278
01:02:55,980 --> 01:02:57,980
producing jobs

1279
01:02:57,980 --> 01:02:59,980
but now I got all now it's a full

1280
01:02:59,980 --> 01:03:01,980
crew of Winx right let me see you

1281
01:03:01,980 --> 01:03:03,980
smile Winx don't

1282
01:03:03,980 --> 01:03:05,980
care if you say you're doing a 72

1283
01:03:05,980 --> 01:03:07,980
hour shift with no breaks

1284
01:03:07,980 --> 01:03:09,980
they won't complain to you

1285
01:03:09,980 --> 01:03:11,980
Briggs on the other hand

1286
01:03:11,980 --> 01:03:13,980
don't care if you cover up the

1287
01:03:13,980 --> 01:03:15,980
signs in your places of

1288
01:03:15,980 --> 01:03:17,980
work that have all the labor

1289
01:03:17,980 --> 01:03:19,980
rules and minimum wage

1290
01:03:19,980 --> 01:03:21,980
if you cover those up with signs that say

1291
01:03:21,980 --> 01:03:23,980
take a bite out of crime

1292
01:03:23,980 --> 01:03:25,980
he's really what he's doing is

1293
01:03:25,980 --> 01:03:27,980
he's teaching the general the kids on this one

1294
01:03:27,980 --> 01:03:29,980
to work long

1295
01:03:29,980 --> 01:03:31,980
hours for a little money

1296
01:03:31,980 --> 01:03:33,980
and no complaining

1297
01:03:33,980 --> 01:03:35,980
and preparing them for the real world

1298
01:03:35,980 --> 01:03:37,980
none of this striking

1299
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:39,980
and union crap

1300
01:03:39,980 --> 01:03:41,980
Winx take the session fee

1301
01:03:41,980 --> 01:03:43,980
and don't take the royalties

1302
01:03:43,980 --> 01:03:45,980
just like Llewyn Davis

1303
01:03:45,980 --> 01:03:47,980
laughing

1304
01:03:47,980 --> 01:03:49,980
laughing

1305
01:03:49,980 --> 01:03:51,980
laughing

1306
01:03:51,980 --> 01:03:53,980
when you guys were on the picket lines for this

1307
01:03:53,980 --> 01:03:55,980
writer strike I was a guy honking

1308
01:03:55,980 --> 01:03:57,980
but I was honking in a bad way

1309
01:03:57,980 --> 01:03:59,980
I was mad

1310
01:03:59,980 --> 01:04:01,980
you need more money I saw what

1311
01:04:01,980 --> 01:04:03,980
I see what the writers for Frazier

1312
01:04:03,980 --> 01:04:05,980
made you don't need anymore

1313
01:04:05,980 --> 01:04:07,980
of that those who I hear all

1314
01:04:07,980 --> 01:04:09,980
the time with the Will and Grace

1315
01:04:09,980 --> 01:04:11,980
I listen to Carvey Spade

1316
01:04:11,980 --> 01:04:13,980
they talk about how much Spade got

1317
01:04:13,980 --> 01:04:15,980
paid for commercials

1318
01:04:15,980 --> 01:04:17,980
you writers you all make that

1319
01:04:17,980 --> 01:04:19,980
you don't need more money

1320
01:04:19,980 --> 01:04:21,980
that's what Zaslav told me when I was courtside

1321
01:04:21,980 --> 01:04:23,980
with him at the Lakers

1322
01:04:23,980 --> 01:04:25,980
he said he was going to have to settle and I'm paying him

1323
01:04:25,980 --> 01:04:27,980
to do it but the great writers

1324
01:04:27,980 --> 01:04:29,980
weren't that ultimately

1325
01:04:29,980 --> 01:04:31,980
dumb

1326
01:04:33,980 --> 01:04:35,980
I just want to see where this resolves again I forget

1327
01:04:59,980 --> 01:05:01,980

laughing

1347
01:05:56,980 --> 01:05:59,980
Santa's praise was like winning a prize

1348
01:05:59,980 --> 01:06:01,980
laughing

1349
01:06:01,980 --> 01:06:03,980
That really jumped out

1350
01:06:03,980 --> 01:06:05,980
That was like instantly iconic to me

1351
01:06:05,980 --> 01:06:07,980
Try, if you, hey

1352
01:06:07,980 --> 01:06:09,980
Listeners, if you're gonna sing Christmas carols

1353
01:06:09,980 --> 01:06:11,980
out there this season

1354
01:06:11,980 --> 01:06:13,980
forget old Jingle Bells and Sleigh Ride

1355
01:06:13,980 --> 01:06:15,980
Startboo throwing these songs in the mix

1356
01:06:15,980 --> 01:06:17,980
laughing

1357
01:06:17,980 --> 01:06:19,980

1358
01:06:19,980 --> 01:06:21,980
So wink and boop

1359
01:06:21,980 --> 01:06:23,980
selfish

1360
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:25,980
Santa's praise was like winning a prize

1361
01:06:25,980 --> 01:06:27,980
Everybody do it, come on

1362
01:06:27,980 --> 01:06:29,980
laughing

1363
01:06:29,980 --> 01:06:31,980
These songs

1364
01:06:31,980 --> 01:06:33,980
I think cassette 4

1365
01:06:33,980 --> 01:06:35,980
is absolutely the worst songs

1366
01:06:35,980 --> 01:06:37,980
Yeah

1367
01:06:37,980 --> 01:06:39,980
Some of the most complicated songs I've ever heard

1368
01:06:39,980 --> 01:06:41,980
Right, I was gonna say the confusions

1369
01:06:41,980 --> 01:06:43,980
Not like jazz fusion math

1370
01:06:43,980 --> 01:06:45,980
but just in terms of

1371
01:06:45,980 --> 01:06:47,980
I'm like baffled

1372
01:06:47,980 --> 01:06:49,980
I can't sing any hook or melody

1373
01:06:49,980 --> 01:06:51,980
Tuneless message songs

1374
01:06:51,980 --> 01:06:53,980
laughing

1375
01:06:53,980 --> 01:06:55,980
This is Christmas too?

1376
01:06:55,980 --> 01:06:57,980
This is like the most stressful Christmas

1377
01:06:57,980 --> 01:06:59,980
That song is called Santa's Helpers

1378
01:06:59,980 --> 01:07:01,980
laughing

1379
01:07:01,980 --> 01:07:03,980
That sounds like fun, right?

1380
01:07:03,980 --> 01:07:05,980
Well, wait to hear how half of them

1381
01:07:05,980 --> 01:07:07,980
are no good lazy bums

1382
01:07:07,980 --> 01:07:09,980
laughing

1383
01:07:09,980 --> 01:07:11,980
Don't judge a book by its cover

1384
01:07:11,980 --> 01:07:13,980
Some of Santa's Helpers suck shit

1385
01:07:13,980 --> 01:07:15,980
laughing

1386
01:07:15,980 --> 01:07:17,980
You gotta weed out the weak ones

1387
01:07:17,980 --> 01:07:19,980
laughing

1388
01:07:19,980 --> 01:07:21,980
You gotta be able to identify who's not gonna do what you want

1389
01:07:21,980 --> 01:07:23,980
and kick them to the curb

1390
01:07:23,980 --> 01:07:25,980
Kick them out right before Christmas too

1391
01:07:25,980 --> 01:07:27,980
These kids, they hear Polar Express

1392
01:07:27,980 --> 01:07:29,980
They're like, travel, trip to Santa's

1393
01:07:29,980 --> 01:07:31,980
home and workshop

1394
01:07:31,980 --> 01:07:33,980
It's gonna be great, it's always gonna be so wonderful

1395
01:07:33,980 --> 01:07:35,980
and nice

1396
01:07:35,980 --> 01:07:37,980
I got news for you, Jack

1397
01:07:37,980 --> 01:07:39,980
There's a lot of real no goodniks

1398
01:07:39,980 --> 01:07:41,980
up at the North Pole

1399
01:07:41,980 --> 01:07:43,980
Just like here in America

1400
01:07:43,980 --> 01:07:45,980
And when I say no goodniks, I mean

1401
01:07:45,980 --> 01:07:47,980
people that won't work more than

1402
01:07:47,980 --> 01:07:49,980
8 hours for a

1403
01:07:49,980 --> 01:07:51,980
hour daily wage

1404
01:07:51,980 --> 01:07:53,980
laughing

1405
01:07:53,980 --> 01:07:55,980
Everyone's lazy, everyone gets a trophy

1406
01:07:55,980 --> 01:07:57,980
No one wants to work anymore

1407
01:07:57,980 --> 01:07:59,980
No one wants to work

1408
01:07:59,980 --> 01:08:01,980
Panera Bread CEO is right

1409
01:08:01,980 --> 01:08:03,980
laughing

1410
01:08:03,980 --> 01:08:05,980
People don't want to help the shareholders anymore

1411
01:08:05,980 --> 01:08:07,980
You don't want to be awake for all 24 hours

1412
01:08:07,980 --> 01:08:09,980
so you drink that death lemonade

1413
01:08:09,980 --> 01:08:11,980
I drink the lemonade and I'm fine

1414
01:08:11,980 --> 01:08:13,980
laughing

1415
01:08:13,980 --> 01:08:15,980
I shit real bad, but I didn't die

1416
01:08:15,980 --> 01:08:17,980
Oh, McGruff's died

1417
01:08:17,980 --> 01:08:19,980

laughing

1422
01:08:27,980 --> 01:08:29,980
Yeah, and it all gives me moral fortitude

1423
01:08:29,980 --> 01:08:31,980
laughing

1424
01:08:31,980 --> 01:08:33,980
Be careful, don't buy a counterfeit

1425
01:08:33,980 --> 01:08:35,980
Charge Lemonade when you're on the street

1426
01:08:35,980 --> 01:08:37,980
It could be full of anything

1427
01:08:37,980 --> 01:08:39,980
Scott, do you know what we're talking about?

1428
01:08:39,980 --> 01:08:41,980
Yeah, yeah, the panera that kills you

1429
01:08:41,980 --> 01:08:43,980
The lemonade that kills you

1430
01:08:43,980 --> 01:08:45,980
No, it's like

1431
01:08:45,980 --> 01:08:47,980
For Loco, they change the formula

1432
01:08:47,980 --> 01:08:49,980
Only drink original panera murder juice

1433
01:08:49,980 --> 01:08:51,980

The next song is called Self-Esteem Team

1436
01:08:55,980 --> 01:08:57,980
How many are left?

1437
01:08:57,980 --> 01:08:59,980
Two

1438
01:08:59,980 --> 01:09:01,980
Oh, okay

1439
01:09:01,980 --> 01:09:03,980
music

1440
01:09:03,980 --> 01:09:05,980
Here's the deal, Self-Esteem Team are bad

1441
01:09:05,980 --> 01:09:07,980
Half of them are jerks

1442
01:09:07,980 --> 01:09:09,980
laughing

1443
01:09:09,980 --> 01:09:11,980
music

1444
01:09:11,980 --> 01:09:13,980
music

1445
01:09:13,980 --> 01:09:15,980
Have self-esteem

1446
01:09:15,980 --> 01:09:17,980
not alpha-steam

1447
01:09:17,980 --> 01:09:19,980
In this case, alpha-steam is bad

1448
01:09:19,980 --> 01:09:21,980
They switch

1449
01:09:21,980 --> 01:09:23,980
I once heard a mighty

1450
01:09:23,980 --> 01:09:25,980
river say

1451
01:09:25,980 --> 01:09:27,980
I began as a

1452
01:09:27,980 --> 01:09:29,980
lifting stream

1453
01:09:29,980 --> 01:09:31,980
So how did that river

1454
01:09:31,980 --> 01:09:33,980
grow so wide

1455
01:09:33,980 --> 01:09:35,980
The stream has

1456
01:09:35,980 --> 01:09:37,980
self-esteem

1457
01:09:37,980 --> 01:09:39,980
Too much metaphor

1458
01:09:39,980 --> 01:09:41,980
When I was re-listening to all this

1459
01:09:41,980 --> 01:09:43,980
This one I really threw my hands in the air

1460
01:09:43,980 --> 01:09:45,980
Because I said, wait, well this song is about

1461
01:09:45,980 --> 01:09:47,980
self-esteem, but the first example is what

1462
01:09:47,980 --> 01:09:49,980
happens to a stream

1463
01:09:49,980 --> 01:09:51,980
I guess

1464
01:09:51,980 --> 01:09:53,980
The stream had

1465
01:09:53,980 --> 01:09:55,980
self-esteem

1466
01:09:55,980 --> 01:09:57,980
This kid added in his contract

1467
01:09:57,980 --> 01:09:59,980
and he only does metaphors

1468
01:09:59,980 --> 01:10:01,980
and it's really pretentious and I hate it

1469
01:10:01,980 --> 01:10:03,980
music

1470
01:10:03,980 --> 01:10:05,980
Self-esteem, the feeling

1471
01:10:05,980 --> 01:10:07,980
that's true, self-esteem

1472
01:10:07,980 --> 01:10:09,980
It comes

1473
01:10:09,980 --> 01:10:11,980
from what you do

1474
01:10:11,980 --> 01:10:13,980
Does it always?

1475
01:10:13,980 --> 01:10:15,980
music

1476
01:10:15,980 --> 01:10:17,980
How did a little

1477
01:10:17,980 --> 01:10:19,980
pail of milk

1478
01:10:19,980 --> 01:10:21,980
get to be chocolate ice cream

1479
01:10:21,980 --> 01:10:23,980
Alright, Jason

1480
01:10:23,980 --> 01:10:25,980
How did the little pail of milk get to be

1481
01:10:25,980 --> 01:10:27,980
chocolate ice cream?

1482
01:10:27,980 --> 01:10:29,980
Well, you put, I mean if it's

1483
01:10:29,980 --> 01:10:31,980
an old school ice cream maker

1484
01:10:31,980 --> 01:10:33,980
You put the dairy in the thing

1485
01:10:33,980 --> 01:10:35,980
and you put salt on top

1486
01:10:35,980 --> 01:10:37,980
and ice around it

1487
01:10:37,980 --> 01:10:39,980
Oh, okay

1488
01:10:39,980 --> 01:10:41,980
Because of what it did

1489
01:10:41,980 --> 01:10:43,980
now, a pail of

1490
01:10:43,980 --> 01:10:45,980
milk has become chocolate ice cream

1491
01:10:45,980 --> 01:10:47,980
All milk dreams

1492
01:10:47,980 --> 01:10:49,980
of being chocolate ice cream

1493
01:10:49,980 --> 01:10:51,980
Not other flavors, chocolate's the best

1494
01:10:51,980 --> 01:10:53,980
And don't say

1495
01:10:53,980 --> 01:10:55,980
that the milk's parents, how it

1496
01:10:55,980 --> 01:10:57,980
treated the milk was the reason

1497
01:10:57,980 --> 01:10:59,980
for its self-esteem, that's not right

1498
01:10:59,980 --> 01:11:01,980
It's what it did

1499
01:11:01,980 --> 01:11:03,980
If you ever see a pail of milk

1500
01:11:03,980 --> 01:11:05,980
know that that is a quitter

1501
01:11:05,980 --> 01:11:07,980
That's a milk that didn't

1502
01:11:07,980 --> 01:11:09,980
It says an ice cream

1503
01:11:09,980 --> 01:11:11,980
that didn't believe it could be an ice cream

1504
01:11:11,980 --> 01:11:13,980
So just remember, Jason

1505
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:15,980
when you're having your nightly chocolate ice cream

1506
01:11:15,980 --> 01:11:17,980
that this is a very

1507
01:11:17,980 --> 01:11:19,980
this has a high level of self-esteem

1508
01:11:19,980 --> 01:11:21,980
This person, this milk is

1509
01:11:21,980 --> 01:11:23,980
very confident in itself

1510
01:11:23,980 --> 01:11:25,980
Okay, I'm sorry

1511
01:11:25,980 --> 01:11:27,980
I'm sorry

1512
01:11:27,980 --> 01:11:29,980
I just want you to learn it

1513
01:11:29,980 --> 01:11:31,980
I will

1514
01:11:31,980 --> 01:11:33,980
Jason, how much more do I need to wag my paw at you

1515
01:11:33,980 --> 01:11:35,980
I'm squeezing your hand for a reason

1516
01:11:35,980 --> 01:11:37,980
You're squeezing my hand too hard

1517
01:11:37,980 --> 01:11:39,980
You're imagining the hitting

1518
01:11:39,980 --> 01:11:41,980
I'm only grazing you

1519
01:11:41,980 --> 01:11:43,980
I'm giving you self-esteem

1520
01:11:43,980 --> 01:11:45,980
You smell like Johnny Walker Red

1521
01:11:45,980 --> 01:11:47,980
I didn't like when you

1522
01:11:47,980 --> 01:11:49,980
touched it on Kudy Serk

1523
01:11:49,980 --> 01:11:51,980
That's a fine beverage

1524
01:11:51,980 --> 01:11:53,980
Kudy Serk and ice

1525
01:11:53,980 --> 01:11:55,980
That's a way to relax

1526
01:11:55,980 --> 01:11:57,980
Self-esteem

1527
01:11:57,980 --> 01:11:59,980
Self-esteem

1528
01:11:59,980 --> 01:12:01,980
Your mind will try and prove

1529
01:12:01,980 --> 01:12:03,980
Self-esteem

1530
01:12:03,980 --> 01:12:05,980
It comes from what you do

1531
01:12:09,980 --> 01:12:11,980
Think of the lonely

1532
01:12:11,980 --> 01:12:13,980
long-wounded girl

1533
01:12:13,980 --> 01:12:15,980
who's now a diamond

1534
01:12:15,980 --> 01:12:17,980
It was her dream

1535
01:12:17,980 --> 01:12:19,980
She brilliantly applied

1536
01:12:19,980 --> 01:12:21,980
herself

1537
01:12:21,980 --> 01:12:23,980
All it took was self-esteem

1538
01:12:25,980 --> 01:12:27,980
How is a diamond made?

1539
01:12:27,980 --> 01:12:29,980
Well, you'd think it'd be complicated

1540
01:12:29,980 --> 01:12:31,980
but there's only one step

1541
01:12:31,980 --> 01:12:33,980
When it comes to Christmas

1542
01:12:33,980 --> 01:12:35,980
lumps of gold

1543
01:12:35,980 --> 01:12:37,980
You're always talking about how they become diamonds

1544
01:12:37,980 --> 01:12:39,980
That's the glum-b-cold Christmas thing

1545
01:12:39,980 --> 01:12:41,980
Right?

1546
01:12:41,980 --> 01:12:43,980
This is a holiday song

1547
01:12:43,980 --> 01:12:45,980
Self-esteem team, supposedly

1548
01:12:45,980 --> 01:12:47,980
Okay

1549
01:12:47,980 --> 01:12:49,980
And I don't know

1550
01:12:49,980 --> 01:12:51,980
Seasonal affective disorder

1551
01:12:51,980 --> 01:12:53,980
can affect everyone

1552
01:12:53,980 --> 01:12:55,980
I like Jingle Bell Rock

1553
01:12:55,980 --> 01:12:57,980
but I also like Self-Esteem Team

1554
01:12:57,980 --> 01:12:59,980
If you're trying to give a kid a practical lesson

1555
01:12:59,980 --> 01:13:01,980
obviously dialing the phone is a lesson

1556
01:13:01,980 --> 01:13:03,980
Kids should know how to do that

1557
01:13:03,980 --> 01:13:05,980
Saying no to drugs

1558
01:13:05,980 --> 01:13:07,980
Okay, yeah, that's a pretty simple way to do it

1559
01:13:07,980 --> 01:13:09,980
but okay

1560
01:13:09,980 --> 01:13:11,980
But you should have self-esteem

1561
01:13:11,980 --> 01:13:13,980
and all the examples are non-humans

1562
01:13:13,980 --> 01:13:15,980
and just like a transformation

1563
01:13:15,980 --> 01:13:17,980
that they've made

1564
01:13:17,980 --> 01:13:19,980
and just being like, you know why they transformed?

1565
01:13:19,980 --> 01:13:21,980
Because they have self-esteem

1566
01:13:21,980 --> 01:13:23,980
Anyway, next song, next lyric

1567
01:13:23,980 --> 01:13:25,980
I don't know

1568
01:13:25,980 --> 01:13:27,980
I don't know, this one really

1569
01:13:27,980 --> 01:13:29,980
How does a piece of wood

1570
01:13:29,980 --> 01:13:31,980
become a table so sturdy and clean

1571
01:13:31,980 --> 01:13:33,980
It just needs self-esteem

1572
01:13:33,980 --> 01:13:35,980
Yeah

1573
01:13:35,980 --> 01:13:37,980
Aren't there people involved?

1574
01:13:37,980 --> 01:13:39,980
Carpenters?

1575
01:13:39,980 --> 01:13:41,980
Yeah, but like if you're a kid

1576
01:13:41,980 --> 01:13:43,980
I don't know how to tell somebody

1577
01:13:43,980 --> 01:13:45,980
to have more self-esteem

1578
01:13:45,980 --> 01:13:47,980
I'd say maybe go to therapy

1579
01:13:47,980 --> 01:13:49,980
first and

1580
01:13:49,980 --> 01:13:51,980
really discover where this

1581
01:13:51,980 --> 01:13:53,980
negativity is coming from

1582
01:13:53,980 --> 01:13:55,980
I guess it's a little nuance

1583
01:13:55,980 --> 01:13:57,980
but yeah, this one really

1584
01:13:57,980 --> 01:13:59,980
I threw up my hands in the air

1585
01:13:59,980 --> 01:14:01,980
I was like, I don't know, this one

1586
01:14:01,980 --> 01:14:03,980
Self-esteem

1587
01:14:03,980 --> 01:14:05,980
How does a stream

1588
01:14:05,980 --> 01:14:07,980
How does a little trickle of water

1589
01:14:07,980 --> 01:14:09,980
become a full stream

1590
01:14:09,980 --> 01:14:11,980
This is like

1591
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:13,980
It's not one to one

1592
01:14:13,980 --> 01:14:15,980
No

1593
01:14:15,980 --> 01:14:17,980
Okay, so that means that

1594
01:14:17,980 --> 01:14:19,980
I should strive

1595
01:14:19,980 --> 01:14:21,980
to be, if I want self-esteem

1596
01:14:21,980 --> 01:14:23,980
It'll probably come if I

1597
01:14:23,980 --> 01:14:25,980
get on the path to becoming 800 pounds

1598
01:14:25,980 --> 01:14:27,980
My problem is

1599
01:14:27,980 --> 01:14:29,980
I'm not big enough

1600
01:14:29,980 --> 01:14:31,980
Or just, you could also like

1601
01:14:31,980 --> 01:14:33,980
That could be one interpretation, yes

1602
01:14:35,980 --> 01:14:37,980
It's also just like, ah, you want

1603
01:14:37,980 --> 01:14:39,980
self-esteem, change into

1604
01:14:39,980 --> 01:14:41,980
something different

1605
01:14:41,980 --> 01:14:43,980
Change who you are

1606
01:14:43,980 --> 01:14:45,980
completely

1607
01:14:45,980 --> 01:14:47,980
And then maybe you will feel good about yourself

1608
01:14:47,980 --> 01:14:49,980
Milk and ice cream

1609
01:14:49,980 --> 01:14:51,980
are pretty different

1610
01:14:51,980 --> 01:14:53,980
So, you know, like, take everything about your

1611
01:14:53,980 --> 01:14:55,980
personality, strip it away

1612
01:14:55,980 --> 01:14:57,980
and change it, fake it

1613
01:14:57,980 --> 01:14:59,980
Make yourself different, be born

1614
01:14:59,980 --> 01:15:01,980
anew

1615
01:15:01,980 --> 01:15:03,980
Change your clothes, change the look

1616
01:15:03,980 --> 01:15:05,980
Change how you talk, I mean, do a

1617
01:15:05,980 --> 01:15:07,980
Lauria Baldwin thing and maybe do

1618
01:15:07,980 --> 01:15:09,980
a Spanish accent all of a sudden

1619
01:15:09,980 --> 01:15:11,980
The only person who took her

1620
01:15:11,980 --> 01:15:13,980
self-esteem now that she's from

1621
01:15:13,980 --> 01:15:15,980
Spain She heard my song

1622
01:15:15,980 --> 01:15:17,980
and she said, oh, you know what

1623
01:15:17,980 --> 01:15:19,980
How you say

1624
01:15:19,980 --> 01:15:21,980
Spanish

1625
01:15:21,980 --> 01:15:23,980
I am how you say

1626
01:15:23,980 --> 01:15:25,980
Spanish speaker now

1627
01:15:25,980 --> 01:15:27,980
And she begged

1628
01:15:27,980 --> 01:15:29,980
the ultimate husband

1629
01:15:29,980 --> 01:15:31,980
The prize of all prizes

1630
01:15:31,980 --> 01:15:33,980
The man we all want to be with

1631
01:15:33,980 --> 01:15:35,980
Man, woman, or dog

1632
01:15:35,980 --> 01:15:37,980
One of the only guys who

1633
01:15:37,980 --> 01:15:39,980
anytime a photographer takes a photo

1634
01:15:39,980 --> 01:15:41,980
he punches him

1635
01:15:41,980 --> 01:15:43,980
He'll take him out

1636
01:15:43,980 --> 01:15:45,980
The only guy who fights against the paparazzi

1637
01:15:45,980 --> 01:15:47,980
Look at him, they made a beautiful litter

1638
01:15:47,980 --> 01:15:49,980
of children

1639
01:15:49,980 --> 01:15:51,980
They're the rare family with a

1640
01:15:51,980 --> 01:15:53,980
dog-sized amount of children

1641
01:15:53,980 --> 01:15:55,980
and he loves it

1642
01:15:55,980 --> 01:15:57,980
Cheaper buy than doesn't, I'd say

1643
01:15:57,980 --> 01:15:59,980
Yeah, they

1644
01:15:59,980 --> 01:16:01,980
buy in bulk

1645
01:16:01,980 --> 01:16:03,980
I go see him all the time, Alec Jr

1646
01:16:03,980 --> 01:16:05,980
Wink, Bip

1647
01:16:05,980 --> 01:16:07,980
All the kids' names

1648
01:16:07,980 --> 01:16:09,980
That Bip, though

1649
01:16:09,980 --> 01:16:11,980
He's pretty selfish

1650
01:16:11,980 --> 01:16:13,980
Take a seat, Steve Martin

1651
01:16:13,980 --> 01:16:15,980
Sit down, Zach Braff

1652
01:16:15,980 --> 01:16:17,980
When Alec asks Wink and Bip

1653
01:16:17,980 --> 01:16:19,980
to do coverage on one of his scripts

1654
01:16:19,980 --> 01:16:21,980
You know, Wink is always

1655
01:16:21,980 --> 01:16:23,980
the one volunteering

1656
01:16:23,980 --> 01:16:25,980
and Bip says, no way

1657
01:16:25,980 --> 01:16:27,980
Bip Baldwin

1658
01:16:27,980 --> 01:16:29,980
He's the one who's very selfish

1659
01:16:29,980 --> 01:16:31,980
Alec didn't send Wink Baldwin

1660
01:16:31,980 --> 01:16:33,980
and Bip Baldwin to the North Pole

1661
01:16:33,980 --> 01:16:35,980
for under-low-paid jobs

1662
01:16:35,980 --> 01:16:37,980
to get rid of them

1663
01:16:37,980 --> 01:16:39,980
They wanted to do it

1664
01:16:39,980 --> 01:16:41,980
to show initiative, but then Bip

1665
01:16:41,980 --> 01:16:43,980
ultimately didn't have what it took

1666
01:16:43,980 --> 01:16:45,980
But Alec will sometimes call

1667
01:16:45,980 --> 01:16:47,980
and use some strong language

1668
01:16:47,980 --> 01:16:49,980
at him, but that's what you do

1669
01:16:49,980 --> 01:16:51,980
as a parent, and he says

1670
01:16:51,980 --> 01:16:53,980
You ungrateful little shit

1671
01:16:53,980 --> 01:16:55,980
You stay up there and learn to be an elf

1672
01:16:55,980 --> 01:16:57,980
because there's no

1673
01:16:57,980 --> 01:16:59,980
You don't have a room here

1674
01:16:59,980 --> 01:17:01,980
I've turned your room into a study

1675
01:17:01,980 --> 01:17:03,980
Adults can use answering machines like Alec

1676
01:17:03,980 --> 01:17:05,980
but you kids can't

1677
01:17:05,980 --> 01:17:07,980
Bip, don't be a selfish little pig

1678
01:17:07,980 --> 01:17:09,980
Okay, what's the last song, though?

1679
01:17:09,980 --> 01:17:11,980
Is it Christmas?

1680
01:17:11,980 --> 01:17:13,980
Well, it's a hold on, hold on

1681
01:17:13,980 --> 01:17:15,980
Hold your horses, Jason

1682
01:17:15,980 --> 01:17:17,980
I'm just so excited by the holiday season

1683
01:17:17,980 --> 01:17:19,980
Jason wanted to get to the end

1684
01:17:19,980 --> 01:17:21,980
faster than the other hosts

1685
01:17:21,980 --> 01:17:23,980
Don't be a Jason

1686
01:17:27,980 --> 01:17:29,980
Be a Mike and Scott, not a Jason

1687
01:17:31,980 --> 01:17:33,980
Jason, don't be a Jason

1688
01:17:33,980 --> 01:17:35,980
Jason was a kid who tried to open a book

1689
01:17:35,980 --> 01:17:37,980
Jason was a kid who tried to open

1690
01:17:37,980 --> 01:17:39,980
all his Christmas presents at once

1691
01:17:39,980 --> 01:17:41,980
Mike and Scott

1692
01:17:41,980 --> 01:17:43,980
would wait a good five minute interval

1693
01:17:43,980 --> 01:17:45,980
and let everyone have a chance in between

1694
01:17:45,980 --> 01:17:47,980
but not Jason

1695
01:17:47,980 --> 01:17:49,980
Smile, brother, do it

1696
01:17:49,980 --> 01:17:51,980
Alright, here we go, it's called Wonder

1697
01:17:51,980 --> 01:17:53,980
Dash Full

1698
01:17:53,980 --> 01:17:55,980
Okay

1699
01:17:55,980 --> 01:17:57,980
Here we go

1700
01:17:57,980 --> 01:17:59,980
Sounds Christmasy

1701
01:17:59,980 --> 01:18:01,980
My little brother Joey asks us

1702
01:18:01,980 --> 01:18:03,980
questions day and night, but even

1703
01:18:03,980 --> 01:18:05,980
with our answers, he asks

1704
01:18:05,980 --> 01:18:07,980
everyone in sight

1705
01:18:07,980 --> 01:18:09,980
Do brown cows give chocolate milk?

1706
01:18:09,980 --> 01:18:11,980
When you put icing

1707
01:18:11,980 --> 01:18:13,980
on a cake, does it get

1708
01:18:13,980 --> 01:18:15,980
cold? Does lemonade

1709
01:18:15,980 --> 01:18:17,980
really need help?

1710
01:18:17,980 --> 01:18:19,980
Can a hot dog get fleas?

1711
01:18:21,980 --> 01:18:23,980
My sister asks the same questions

1712
01:18:23,980 --> 01:18:25,980
again and again

1713
01:18:25,980 --> 01:18:27,980
Yesterday she caught my mom and then

1714
01:18:27,980 --> 01:18:29,980
she started it

1715
01:18:29,980 --> 01:18:31,980
Why don't they call it a hot fudge

1716
01:18:31,980 --> 01:18:33,980
Monday

1717
01:18:33,980 --> 01:18:35,980
If there are boys and berries, are there

1718
01:18:35,980 --> 01:18:37,980
girls and berries?

1719
01:18:37,980 --> 01:18:39,980
Does a river keep its money in a river

1720
01:18:39,980 --> 01:18:41,980
bank?

1721
01:18:41,980 --> 01:18:43,980
If I planted jelly beans,

1722
01:18:43,980 --> 01:18:45,980
could I grow jelly?

1723
01:18:45,980 --> 01:18:47,980
Save these for popsicle sticks

1724
01:18:47,980 --> 01:18:49,980
My cousin is a pain, he asks me

1725
01:18:49,980 --> 01:18:51,980
questions by the ton

1726
01:18:51,980 --> 01:18:53,980
It got so bad that when

1727
01:18:53,980 --> 01:18:55,980
I see him now, I turn around

1728
01:18:55,980 --> 01:18:57,980
and run

1729
01:18:57,980 --> 01:18:59,980
Do Eskimos stick their house together

1730
01:18:59,980 --> 01:19:01,980
with igloo?

1731
01:19:01,980 --> 01:19:03,980
Where's the gum in gumdrops?

1732
01:19:03,980 --> 01:19:05,980
What do you call

1733
01:19:05,980 --> 01:19:07,980
a boy ladybug?

1734
01:19:07,980 --> 01:19:09,980
How can a square

1735
01:19:09,980 --> 01:19:11,980
dance?

1736
01:19:11,980 --> 01:19:13,980
I'm glad I don't have someone

1737
01:19:13,980 --> 01:19:15,980
like that bugging me at home

1738
01:19:15,980 --> 01:19:17,980
But since you guys all brought it up

1739
01:19:17,980 --> 01:19:19,980
I have questions of my own

1740
01:19:19,980 --> 01:19:21,980
Oh no!

1741
01:19:21,980 --> 01:19:23,980
Who pays

1742
01:19:23,980 --> 01:19:25,980
the bill of rights?

1743
01:19:25,980 --> 01:19:27,980
How do potatoes get chipped

1744
01:19:27,980 --> 01:19:29,980
This is my statement against comedy

1745
01:19:29,980 --> 01:19:31,980
and comedians

1746
01:19:31,980 --> 01:19:33,980
The only one I like is Bill

1747
01:19:33,980 --> 01:19:35,980
The whole group of

1748
01:19:35,980 --> 01:19:37,980
Amelia Bedelia's and it's exhausting

1749
01:19:37,980 --> 01:19:39,980
Why aren't reindeer always wet?

1750
01:19:41,980 --> 01:19:43,980
Why aren't big storms

1751
01:19:43,980 --> 01:19:45,980
called hizzocanes?

1752
01:19:45,980 --> 01:19:47,980
Help us, McGruff

1753
01:19:47,980 --> 01:19:49,980
Hurricane is a small

1754
01:19:49,980 --> 01:19:51,980
storm, but that's

1755
01:19:51,980 --> 01:19:53,980
the here's this is a

1756
01:19:53,980 --> 01:19:55,980
McGruff, this is a weird new way

1757
01:19:55,980 --> 01:19:57,980
of being sexist

1758
01:19:57,980 --> 01:19:59,980
I'm always innovating

1759
01:20:01,980 --> 01:20:03,980
You think

1760
01:20:03,980 --> 01:20:05,980
hurricanes are wimpy?

1761
01:20:05,980 --> 01:20:07,980
Like a

1762
01:20:07,980 --> 01:20:09,980
smaller, like a woman would be?

1763
01:20:09,980 --> 01:20:11,980
Feminine, yeah, hurricanes

1764
01:20:11,980 --> 01:20:13,980
I don't think so

1765
01:20:13,980 --> 01:20:15,980
They always get emotional, they always go spinning

1766
01:20:15,980 --> 01:20:17,980
around and around, they can't control themselves

1767
01:20:17,980 --> 01:20:19,980
Not like men

1768
01:20:19,980 --> 01:20:21,980
Adult dog men

1769
01:20:21,980 --> 01:20:23,980
Hizzocanes, you're saying

1770
01:20:23,980 --> 01:20:25,980
Hizzocanes would be just

1771
01:20:25,980 --> 01:20:27,980
direct to the point, get the destruction

1772
01:20:27,980 --> 01:20:29,980
job done and be on with it

1773
01:20:29,980 --> 01:20:31,980
Yeah, and with none of that

1774
01:20:31,980 --> 01:20:33,980
crying, it doesn't rain

1775
01:20:33,980 --> 01:20:35,980
when a hizzocane is going

1776
01:20:35,980 --> 01:20:37,980
I gotta tell you that

1777
01:20:37,980 --> 01:20:39,980
You gotta make sure

1778
01:20:39,980 --> 01:20:41,980
to identify

1779
01:20:41,980 --> 01:20:43,980
Hurricanes are female tears?

1780
01:20:43,980 --> 01:20:45,980
That's right

1781
01:20:45,980 --> 01:20:47,980
Are they making the cry female tears?

1782
01:20:47,980 --> 01:20:49,980
That's right

1783
01:20:49,980 --> 01:20:51,980
So hizzocanes are big and dry

1784
01:20:51,980 --> 01:20:53,980
Quick

1785
01:20:53,980 --> 01:20:55,980
Powerful

1786
01:20:55,980 --> 01:20:57,980
Shellshock from war

1787
01:20:57,980 --> 01:20:59,980
With some PTSD

1788
01:20:59,980 --> 01:21:01,980
but they're dealing with it

1789
01:21:01,980 --> 01:21:03,980
And they also, what, I guess they don't

1790
01:21:03,980 --> 01:21:05,980
ask for directions either

1791
01:21:05,980 --> 01:21:07,980
They know where they're going

1792
01:21:07,980 --> 01:21:09,980
This is another

1793
01:21:09,980 --> 01:21:11,980
They chart a quick course and they do it and they're there

1794
01:21:11,980 --> 01:21:13,980
McGruff, I don't know

1795
01:21:13,980 --> 01:21:15,980
that kids being precocious

1796
01:21:15,980 --> 01:21:17,980
and asking too many questions is

1797
01:21:17,980 --> 01:21:19,980
very Christmas focused

1798
01:21:19,980 --> 01:21:21,980
Hold on, there's

1799
01:21:21,980 --> 01:21:23,980
another few seconds of the song left

1800
01:21:23,980 --> 01:21:25,980
Oh, okay

1801
01:21:25,980 --> 01:21:27,980
Merry Christmas from McGruff, bye

1802
01:21:27,980 --> 01:21:29,980
Hi kids, I'm glad you all asked questions

1803
01:21:29,980 --> 01:21:31,980
so you can learn about things

1804
01:21:31,980 --> 01:21:33,980
but the best way to find out

1805
01:21:33,980 --> 01:21:35,980
more about all the things you're interested in

1806
01:21:35,980 --> 01:21:37,980
is to learn how to explore

1807
01:21:37,980 --> 01:21:39,980
your school and public libraries

1808
01:21:39,980 --> 01:21:41,980
They're a great place

1809
01:21:41,980 --> 01:21:43,980
to learn all kinds of things

1810
01:21:43,980 --> 01:21:45,980
They have books, records, tapes, and even films

1811
01:21:45,980 --> 01:21:47,980
on every subject you can imagine

1812
01:21:47,980 --> 01:21:49,980
So ask about getting your

1813
01:21:49,980 --> 01:21:51,980
very own library card

1814
01:21:51,980 --> 01:21:53,980
It's absolutely free and you can explore

1815
01:21:53,980 --> 01:21:55,980
the wonderful world

1816
01:21:55,980 --> 01:21:57,980
inside your library

1817
01:21:57,980 --> 01:21:59,980
This song's about libraries?

1818
01:21:59,980 --> 01:22:01,980
It's called Wonderful?

1819
01:22:01,980 --> 01:22:03,980
So the end of

1820
01:22:03,980 --> 01:22:05,980
the end of the holiday

1821
01:22:05,980 --> 01:22:07,980
cassette is just about getting a library card

1822
01:22:07,980 --> 01:22:09,980
Famously keep limited

1823
01:22:09,980 --> 01:22:11,980
hours around the holidays

1824
01:22:11,980 --> 01:22:13,980
or close

1825
01:22:13,980 --> 01:22:15,980
All the kids ask annoying joke questions

1826
01:22:15,980 --> 01:22:17,980
and they ask it to McGruff and he goes

1827
01:22:17,980 --> 01:22:19,980
Alright, I'm enough of this shit

1828
01:22:19,980 --> 01:22:21,980
There's a building you can go to

1829
01:22:21,980 --> 01:22:23,980
and you can look it up in books

1830
01:22:23,980 --> 01:22:25,980
He doesn't even say happy holidays

1831
01:22:25,980 --> 01:22:27,980
He's just, I'm outta here

1832
01:22:27,980 --> 01:22:29,980
And that's the end of the cassette

1833
01:22:29,980 --> 01:22:31,980
That's the end of McGruff's cassette

1834
01:22:31,980 --> 01:22:33,980
Hello, you work here? Yes, I'm a librarian

1835
01:22:33,980 --> 01:22:35,980
Okay, is there a book

1836
01:22:35,980 --> 01:22:37,980
that could teach me why

1837
01:22:37,980 --> 01:22:39,980
big storms

1838
01:22:39,980 --> 01:22:41,980
aren't called

1839
01:22:41,980 --> 01:22:43,980
is-a-canes

1840
01:22:43,980 --> 01:22:45,980
There's

1841
01:22:45,980 --> 01:22:47,980
one of those big decay

1842
01:22:47,980 --> 01:22:49,980
picture books

1843
01:22:49,980 --> 01:22:51,980
There's one on natural

1844
01:22:51,980 --> 01:22:53,980
disasters

1845
01:22:53,980 --> 01:22:55,980
Don't talk to me anymore

1846
01:22:55,980 --> 01:22:57,980
That's what McGruff said

1847
01:22:57,980 --> 01:22:59,980
I have 50 more

1848
01:22:59,980 --> 01:23:01,980
subjects where I have

1849
01:23:01,980 --> 01:23:03,980
questions, is there a book about ladybugs?

1850
01:23:03,980 --> 01:23:05,980
Because I wanted to know about boy ones

1851
01:23:05,980 --> 01:23:07,980
Excuse me, librarian, I went to see

1852
01:23:07,980 --> 01:23:09,980
Carrot Top in Las Vegas

1853
01:23:09,980 --> 01:23:11,980
and a lot of the things he said

1854
01:23:11,980 --> 01:23:13,980
confused me

1855
01:23:13,980 --> 01:23:15,980
and there were plays on words and I have so many

1856
01:23:15,980 --> 01:23:17,980
questions about it now

1857
01:23:17,980 --> 01:23:19,980
most of them about

1858
01:23:19,980 --> 01:23:21,980
his-a-canes and hurricanes

1859
01:23:21,980 --> 01:23:23,980
I assume

1860
01:23:23,980 --> 01:23:25,980
that's what Carrot Top's act is, right?

1861
01:23:25,980 --> 01:23:27,980
It's like a lot of puns like that

1862
01:23:27,980 --> 01:23:29,980
He has his items

1863
01:23:29,980 --> 01:23:31,980
so he could have a his-a-cane

1864
01:23:31,980 --> 01:23:33,980
He would say, here's a hurricane, but here's a

1865
01:23:33,980 --> 01:23:35,980
his-a-cane

1866
01:23:35,980 --> 01:23:37,980
It's big

1867
01:23:37,980 --> 01:23:39,980
It's got the male symbol

1868
01:23:39,980 --> 01:23:41,980
We just wrote a joke for him

1869
01:23:41,980 --> 01:23:43,980
Toilet seat with the rear view mirror

1870
01:23:43,980 --> 01:23:45,980
Wow, that's a classic, he brought that up

1871
01:23:45,980 --> 01:23:47,980
That's his hit

1872
01:23:47,980 --> 01:23:49,980
That's good stuff

1873
01:23:49,980 --> 01:23:51,980
What is this called?

1874
01:23:51,980 --> 01:23:53,980
Is it just called Tape 4?

1875
01:23:53,980 --> 01:23:55,980
They're all McGruff cares for you

1876
01:23:55,980 --> 01:23:57,980
Cassette 4

1877
01:23:57,980 --> 01:23:59,980
But it is vaguely

1878
01:23:59,980 --> 01:24:01,980
It's not properly a Christmas

1879
01:24:01,980 --> 01:24:03,980
album, it just has some

1880
01:24:03,980 --> 01:24:05,980
Christmas music on it

1881
01:24:05,980 --> 01:24:07,980
Does the cover reference

1882
01:24:07,980 --> 01:24:09,980
Christmas in any way?

1883
01:24:09,980 --> 01:24:11,980
I'm trying to remember, it's not with me

1884
01:24:11,980 --> 01:24:13,980
It's a strange blend, some of it is

1885
01:24:13,980 --> 01:24:15,980
about Santa's elves who are

1886
01:24:15,980 --> 01:24:17,980
largely bad

1887
01:24:17,980 --> 01:24:19,980
Right, but

1888
01:24:19,980 --> 01:24:21,980
then

1889
01:24:21,980 --> 01:24:23,980
I'm looking at cover

1890
01:24:23,980 --> 01:24:25,980
Oh wait, I'm kind of seeing it

1891
01:24:25,980 --> 01:24:27,980
It's pretty small, it's on worthpoint.com

1892
01:24:27,980 --> 01:24:29,980
And yeah, he's reading

1893
01:24:29,980 --> 01:24:31,980
a storybook

1894
01:24:31,980 --> 01:24:33,980
By a fire, which has some Christmas

1895
01:24:33,980 --> 01:24:35,980
decorations on it

1896
01:24:35,980 --> 01:24:37,980
So that's kind of

1897
01:24:37,980 --> 01:24:39,980
This one really feels

1898
01:24:39,980 --> 01:24:41,980
like they ran out of time

1899
01:24:41,980 --> 01:24:43,980
And they had to finish, they promised

1900
01:24:43,980 --> 01:24:45,980
four cassettes for whatever

1901
01:24:45,980 --> 01:24:47,980
Burger King deal, and they ran

1902
01:24:47,980 --> 01:24:49,980
out of time, cause like

1903
01:24:49,980 --> 01:24:51,980
There's, some of those

1904
01:24:51,980 --> 01:24:53,980
songs make the first three cassettes look like

1905
01:24:53,980 --> 01:24:55,980
masterpieces

1906
01:24:55,980 --> 01:24:57,980
Those are all

1907
01:24:57,980 --> 01:24:59,980
bad songs, but some of them were a little

1908
01:24:59,980 --> 01:25:01,980
more mundane, forgettable

1909
01:25:01,980 --> 01:25:03,980
I remember very little of what was

1910
01:25:03,980 --> 01:25:05,980
in MacGruff too, I don't know

1911
01:25:05,980 --> 01:25:07,980
if I'll soon forget

1912
01:25:07,980 --> 01:25:09,980
Selfish and Elfish and

1913
01:25:09,980 --> 01:25:11,980
Santa's Praise

1914
01:25:11,980 --> 01:25:13,980
was like getting a prize

1915
01:25:13,980 --> 01:25:15,980
I feel like that's gonna occur

1916
01:25:15,980 --> 01:25:17,980
to me on my deathbed

1917
01:25:17,980 --> 01:25:19,980
Santa, praise me

1918
01:25:19,980 --> 01:25:21,980
That's true

1919
01:25:21,980 --> 01:25:23,980
His last words were, Santa, praise me

1920
01:25:23,980 --> 01:25:25,980
I want the prize

1921
01:25:25,980 --> 01:25:27,980
He's better off

1922
01:25:27,980 --> 01:25:29,980
dead, I guess

1923
01:25:29,980 --> 01:25:31,980
Well, I mean, look

1924
01:25:31,980 --> 01:25:33,980
There were songs probably we didn't even play

1925
01:25:33,980 --> 01:25:35,980
So, maybe, you know

1926
01:25:35,980 --> 01:25:37,980
with no limits, MacGruff

1927
01:25:37,980 --> 01:25:39,980
7 can be a re-examining

1928
01:25:39,980 --> 01:25:41,980
of all these cassettes

1929
01:25:41,980 --> 01:25:43,980
So how many songs are left

1930
01:25:43,980 --> 01:25:45,980
in this expedition now?

1931
01:25:45,980 --> 01:25:47,980
Well, there's MacGruff and Scruff and the Crime Dogs

1932
01:25:47,980 --> 01:25:49,980
and I just played, what, two?

1933
01:25:49,980 --> 01:25:51,980
Yeah, just a sampling

1934
01:25:51,980 --> 01:25:53,980
So there's probably like

1935
01:25:53,980 --> 01:25:55,980
six or seven left

1936
01:25:55,980 --> 01:25:57,980
That could be like the B-sides

1937
01:25:57,980 --> 01:25:59,980
Yeah, so we can combine that with some of the

1938
01:25:59,980 --> 01:26:01,980
TV specials

1939
01:26:01,980 --> 01:26:03,980
Those specials are good

1940
01:26:03,980 --> 01:26:05,980
I think we're gonna get to MacGruff

1941
01:26:05,980 --> 01:26:07,980
Well, wait a minute

1942
01:26:07,980 --> 01:26:09,980
We already did 1, 2, 3, so you can't go backwards

1943
01:26:09,980 --> 01:26:11,980
like prequels

1944
01:26:11,980 --> 01:26:13,980
Do we

1945
01:26:13,980 --> 01:26:15,980
We could rename it like George did

1946
01:26:15,980 --> 01:26:17,980
Remember he called New Hope

1947
01:26:17,980 --> 01:26:19,980
He called it New Hope after the fact

1948
01:26:19,980 --> 01:26:21,980
and called it 4

1949
01:26:21,980 --> 01:26:23,980
So, alright

1950
01:26:23,980 --> 01:26:25,980
We could change it on the

1951
01:26:25,980 --> 01:26:27,980
Yeah

1952
01:26:27,980 --> 01:26:29,980
MacGruff 1 is now

1953
01:26:29,980 --> 01:26:31,980
MacGruff 4, but MacGruff 3

1954
01:26:31,980 --> 01:26:33,980
was about MacGruff Tape 4

1955
01:26:33,980 --> 01:26:35,980
Right, yeah, yeah, we can do that

1956
01:26:35,980 --> 01:26:37,980
MacGruff 1 is now

1957
01:26:37,980 --> 01:26:39,980
called a New Hope

1958
01:26:39,980 --> 01:26:41,980
It's not, I think we

1959
01:26:41,980 --> 01:26:43,980
wrote MacGruff, the Crime Dogs singing career

1960
01:26:43,980 --> 01:26:45,980
but it's not that anymore

1961
01:26:45,980 --> 01:26:47,980
I guess if you're going in

1962
01:26:47,980 --> 01:26:49,980
terms of quality

1963
01:26:49,980 --> 01:26:51,980
if it's sort of agreed that Empire Strikes

1964
01:26:51,980 --> 01:26:53,980
Back is the best, then MacGruff 1

1965
01:26:53,980 --> 01:26:55,980
probably, Smart Kids is

1966
01:26:55,980 --> 01:26:57,980
Empire Strikes Back

1967
01:26:57,980 --> 01:26:59,980
And you know what, this was

1968
01:26:59,980 --> 01:27:01,980
kind of odd

1969
01:27:01,980 --> 01:27:03,980
and confusing and seemed to change the plan

1970
01:27:03,980 --> 01:27:05,980
a lot, is it Christmas? No, it's

1971
01:27:05,980 --> 01:27:07,980
Wonderful and Library

1972
01:27:07,980 --> 01:27:09,980
I think this tape is the Rise

1973
01:27:09,980 --> 01:27:11,980
of Skywalker of

1974
01:27:11,980 --> 01:27:13,980
It's a bizarre

1975
01:27:13,980 --> 01:27:15,980
conclusion

1976
01:27:15,980 --> 01:27:17,980
that is kind of all over the place

1977
01:27:17,980 --> 01:27:19,980
Yeah, I think that's right

1978
01:27:19,980 --> 01:27:21,980
That introduces some new

1979
01:27:21,980 --> 01:27:23,980
characters, but is Mrs. Carpenter

1980
01:27:23,980 --> 01:27:25,980
Mrs. Carpenter maybe as

1981
01:27:25,980 --> 01:27:27,980
will have the

1982
01:27:27,980 --> 01:27:29,980
cultural impact of

1983
01:27:29,980 --> 01:27:31,980
Babu Frick

1984
01:27:31,980 --> 01:27:33,980
Babu Frick though, I just saw somebody had a license plate

1985
01:27:33,980 --> 01:27:35,980
on Twitter

1986
01:27:35,980 --> 01:27:37,980
I thought you passed that on the road

1987
01:27:37,980 --> 01:27:39,980
I would have turned my

1988
01:27:39,980 --> 01:27:41,980
car in front of that person's car and made them

1989
01:27:41,980 --> 01:27:43,980
pull over so I could shake their hand

1990
01:27:43,980 --> 01:27:45,980
But no, I saw it

1991
01:27:45,980 --> 01:27:47,980
on X, I saw it on X

1992
01:27:47,980 --> 01:27:49,980
Yeah, so

1993
01:27:49,980 --> 01:27:51,980
there's more MacGruff

1994
01:27:51,980 --> 01:27:53,980
It's an interesting

1995
01:27:53,980 --> 01:27:55,980
thing, it's really

1996
01:27:55,980 --> 01:27:57,980
Should Alex Jones be reinstated

1997
01:27:57,980 --> 01:27:59,980
on X?

1998
01:27:59,980 --> 01:28:01,980
Vox Populi Vox Dei

1999
01:28:03,980 --> 01:28:05,980
Well, the people spoke

2000
01:28:05,980 --> 01:28:07,980
That's weird, yeah, there was that Twitter

2001
01:28:07,980 --> 01:28:09,980
circle the other day that was

2002
01:28:09,980 --> 01:28:11,980
Vivek Ramaswamy

2003
01:28:11,980 --> 01:28:13,980
Elon Musk

2004
01:28:13,980 --> 01:28:15,980
Andrew Tate and MacGruff the Grimedog

2005
01:28:15,980 --> 01:28:17,980
I actually, I think I got a shot

2006
01:28:17,980 --> 01:28:19,980
I think if I started running

2007
01:28:19,980 --> 01:28:21,980
now I could be up there with Vivek

2008
01:28:21,980 --> 01:28:23,980
and Nikki Haley

2009
01:28:23,980 --> 01:28:25,980
And MacGruff, he forgot to mute

2010
01:28:25,980 --> 01:28:27,980
his mic when he was licking himself

2011
01:28:27,980 --> 01:28:29,980
Did you hear that too? Yes, yeah, yeah

2012
01:28:31,980 --> 01:28:33,980
Vivek left his mic on and was

2013
01:28:33,980 --> 01:28:35,980
peeing

2014
01:28:35,980 --> 01:28:37,980
So they heard

2015
01:28:37,980 --> 01:28:39,980
MacGruff was really, he was gross

2016
01:28:39,980 --> 01:28:41,980
Hey, sorry

2017
01:28:41,980 --> 01:28:43,980
Gotta do it, it's a long one of those

2018
01:28:43,980 --> 01:28:45,980
spaces or whatever it's called

2019
01:28:45,980 --> 01:28:47,980
He smoked, he's done it

2020
01:28:47,980 --> 01:28:49,980
He's gonna call him little peepee boy

2021
01:28:49,980 --> 01:28:51,980
and he's gonna be done

2022
01:28:53,980 --> 01:28:55,980
I hope so

2023
01:28:55,980 --> 01:28:57,980
That's good

2024
01:28:57,980 --> 01:28:59,980
Alright, well

2025
01:28:59,980 --> 01:29:01,980
So remaining now

2026
01:29:01,980 --> 01:29:03,980
six songs, but we did

2027
01:29:03,980 --> 01:29:05,980
clear the holiday stuff, but we also

2028
01:29:05,980 --> 01:29:07,980
we cleared the holiday stuff an hour ago

2029
01:29:07,980 --> 01:29:09,980
because technically

2030
01:29:09,980 --> 01:29:11,980
the only holiday songs

2031
01:29:11,980 --> 01:29:13,980
There's also other songs we didn't

2032
01:29:13,980 --> 01:29:15,980
play on MacGruff too, we were

2033
01:29:15,980 --> 01:29:17,980
skipping around, so

2034
01:29:17,980 --> 01:29:19,980
B-sides, we might play B-sides and Rarities

2035
01:29:19,980 --> 01:29:21,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah

2036
01:29:21,980 --> 01:29:23,980
So we've

2037
01:29:23,980 --> 01:29:25,980
really opened up more

2038
01:29:25,980 --> 01:29:27,980
which is a good thing, because it's always

2039
01:29:27,980 --> 01:29:29,980
fun to do the voice. This is more like

2040
01:29:29,980 --> 01:29:31,980
the ending where the fist pump

2041
01:29:31,980 --> 01:29:33,980
shoots out of the ground at the end

2042
01:29:33,980 --> 01:29:35,980
and there's more

2043
01:29:35,980 --> 01:29:37,980
the villain is not dead, it's a

2044
01:29:37,980 --> 01:29:39,980
the end question mark, and then the question mark

2045
01:29:39,980 --> 01:29:41,980
explodes, because I don't think

2046
01:29:41,980 --> 01:29:43,980
we are done. We're not done, yeah

2047
01:29:43,980 --> 01:29:45,980
Geez, thank God

2048
01:29:45,980 --> 01:29:47,980
because, wow, I don't know how we

2049
01:29:47,980 --> 01:29:49,980
waited three years to do it

2050
01:29:49,980 --> 01:29:51,980
It was so much more fun to do it not

2051
01:29:51,980 --> 01:29:53,980
under shadow of Pandemic

2052
01:29:53,980 --> 01:29:55,980
and to be here with MacGruff in person

2053
01:29:55,980 --> 01:29:57,980
Hey, let me give you the guest treatment

2054
01:29:57,980 --> 01:29:59,980
MacGruff, you survived

2055
01:29:59,980 --> 01:30:01,980
podcast The Ride, The Second Gate

2056
01:30:01,980 --> 01:30:03,980
Oh, wow. Let's exit through the gift shop

2057
01:30:03,980 --> 01:30:05,980
Is there anything you'd like to plug?

2058
01:30:05,980 --> 01:30:07,980
Well, I'd just like to tell you

2059
01:30:07,980 --> 01:30:09,980
to have self-esteem

2060
01:30:09,980 --> 01:30:11,980
I want to remind you to use the phone

2061
01:30:11,980 --> 01:30:13,980
correctly

2062
01:30:13,980 --> 01:30:15,980
I like to... So, cards

2063
01:30:15,980 --> 01:30:17,980
don't have zards

2064
01:30:17,980 --> 01:30:19,980
but do

2065
01:30:19,980 --> 01:30:21,980
use cards

2066
01:30:21,980 --> 01:30:23,980
Yeah, your phone card

2067
01:30:23,980 --> 01:30:25,980
and make sure the directions are in your head

2068
01:30:25,980 --> 01:30:27,980
because of a tune

2069
01:30:27,980 --> 01:30:29,980
I kind of remember it

2070
01:30:29,980 --> 01:30:31,980
Make sure when you're walking outside

2071
01:30:31,980 --> 01:30:33,980
to look straight ahead, not down

2072
01:30:35,980 --> 01:30:37,980
What else?

2073
01:30:37,980 --> 01:30:39,980
Libraries, you said

2074
01:30:39,980 --> 01:30:41,980
Yeah, that's good

2075
01:30:41,980 --> 01:30:43,980
Figure it out at the library

2076
01:30:43,980 --> 01:30:45,980
Keep our dumb questions

2077
01:30:45,980 --> 01:30:47,980
to us, to ourselves

2078
01:30:47,980 --> 01:30:49,980
until we get to a library

2079
01:30:49,980 --> 01:30:51,980
That's probably the main thing you want to plug

2080
01:30:51,980 --> 01:30:53,980
Yeah, and

2081
01:30:53,980 --> 01:30:55,980
stay away from the woke police

2082
01:30:55,980 --> 01:30:57,980
Not the police

2083
01:30:57,980 --> 01:30:59,980
you represent

2084
01:30:59,980 --> 01:31:01,980
Okay, well, appreciate you being here

2085
01:31:01,980 --> 01:31:03,980
This has been The Last

2086
01:31:03,980 --> 01:31:05,980
Second Gate of 2023

2087
01:31:05,980 --> 01:31:07,980
Fun way to close it out

2088
01:31:07,980 --> 01:31:09,980
We do have one more Christmas treat

2089
01:31:09,980 --> 01:31:11,980
coming on Club 3, our VIP tier

2090
01:31:11,980 --> 01:31:13,980

2091
01:31:13,980 --> 01:31:15,980
vote on topics and get our regular main feed

2092
01:31:15,980 --> 01:31:17,980
episodes ad-free

2093
01:31:17,980 --> 01:31:19,980
So if you want one more bonus treat for the year

2094
01:31:19,980 --> 01:31:21,980
that'll be on patreon.com

2095
01:31:21,980 --> 01:31:23,980
slash podcast the ride

2096
01:31:23,980 --> 01:31:25,980
otherwise we'll be back with new stuff

2097
01:31:25,980 --> 01:31:27,980
in January

2098
01:31:27,980 --> 01:31:29,980
Well, have a

2099
01:31:29,980 --> 01:31:31,980
McGruffy Christmas, do what McGruff

2100
01:31:31,980 --> 01:31:33,980
would do, and may

2101
01:31:33,980 --> 01:31:35,980
all of Santa's praise

2102
01:31:35,980 --> 01:31:37,980
feel like a prize

2103
01:31:37,980 --> 01:31:39,980
Well said, thank you
