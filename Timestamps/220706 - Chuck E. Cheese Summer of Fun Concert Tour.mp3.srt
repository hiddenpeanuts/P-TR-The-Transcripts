1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,360
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:26,600
Welcome to podcast the ride the second gate where it is of course the dog days of summer.

3
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,440
My name is Michael Carlson.

4
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,440
My name is always Jason Sheridan.

5
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:33,360
I think we're pre summer on the calendar though.

6
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,120
Is this the first day?

7
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,680
Oh, will it be the first day when this comes out?

8
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:38,360
I know it will be summer when this comes out.

9
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:44,800
All I know is I went to a summer of fun concert tour and they don't have those in the spring.

10
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:50,120
So I listened to what the big mice tell me.

11
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,120
That's right.

12
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,320
And according to them, it is the ultimate summer.

13
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,360
Yeah.

14
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,360
So look, I'm podcast the ride.

15
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:02,560
We don't do a ton of concert reviews where we go and see musicians perform.

16
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:07,200
No, it's not so much about checking out the local rock scene as much as we consider ourselves

17
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,200
part of it.

18
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,560
We are part of it.

19
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:16,040
But yeah, you know, this is a very special episode because sort of a bit of a trip report

20
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:20,240
where we got to see some of our favorite musicians perform live.

21
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,240
Boy, yeah.

22
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:28,680
Mike and I went to the ultimate concert and which, you know, the bar is high because we've

23
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,920
I've declared that my favorite concert I've ever been to was with you.

24
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,400
It was a desert trip.

25
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:38,960
We're rolling stones where we broke through the barricade in several ways and we're really

26
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,640
close to the stones.

27
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,360
But we were even closer to today's act.

28
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,360
So close.

29
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:48,120
Blew them out of the water because they're, you know, these guys have been around for

30
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,320
a while too.

31
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:55,680
Keith Richards can do all of his blood changing out as much as he wants.

32
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:01,600
But what he doesn't do is literally take a new shape and form every 15 years or so.

33
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,600
Right.

34
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:06,360
As do these and then slim way down.

35
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,480
They get skinny.

36
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:11,520
This band gets skinnier and skinnier as the years go on.

37
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,440
I think there's a decent chance, though, that like in the next Rolling Stones tour, they're

38
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,760
like, and Keith Richards and it's just a young man and no one explains it.

39
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,320
You're about to witness a great becoming.

40
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:29,120
And it's there. Maybe they're all young, like just like the technology was just invented.

41
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,880
This isn't the Rolling Stones as much as it is a legacy.

42
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,360
Cool to the Rolling Stones.

43
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,840
Well, that's that's the torch to a new generation.

44
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,240
No joke about that. That's going to happen.

45
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:42,640
We will totally start your theory on the Beach Boys where it's like they'll just hand it

46
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,000
off. And yeah, I mean, I think this has already happened.

47
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,360
The ones that you can't track as well, like the, you know, the the temptations who is

48
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,200
probably not probably the the temptations all showed up around 2002.

49
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,320
Yeah, right. Nobody's nobody's looking up who these guys are.

50
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,280
They sing the songs great. They were.

51
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,160
They kind of like twirl around each other.

52
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:06,080
Great. Done. No one asks any questions like those.

53
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,480
Those guys look young.

54
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:10,760
John, the temptations in the 60s.

55
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,800
These guys all look like they're in their 50s.

56
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,080
I don't know. And I don't care.

57
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,840
I am drunk and my girl is on.

58
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,640
Oh, I know this song.

59
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,880
Uh huh. Yeah.

60
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:27,560
So so most people won't even question it when you go see the Rolling Stones and they're

61
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,880
21. Yeah, I know.

62
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:33,600
We'll we'll start getting the episode nines of bands soon enough.

63
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,160
Oh, yeah. It's on the way.

64
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:39,040
Right. Not this. This is there's more of this is a direct continuity here.

65
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,400
And not all of the members were able to be there.

66
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:46,360
But the core ones were, hey, look, we're talking about Munch's Make Believe band.

67
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:53,360
Yeah. And you hear this and you're like, yeah, I know you guys talk about them all the

68
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,640
time. They play in different Chuck E.

69
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,320
Cheese settings.

70
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:01,480
And what are you going to bust out to surprise me here?

71
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,880
Well, psych, this was not in a Chuck E.

72
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,320
Cheese. They're on tour.

73
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,280
They are on tour.

74
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:15,200
They're stopping all across America in Chicago, Miami, Fort Worth, L.A.

75
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:18,520
The end is a multi city.

76
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:24,480
And by multi, I mean, four to and we saw them not boxed into their box.

77
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:27,840
We saw them at the world famous Santa Monica Pier.

78
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,160
Here's why. Yes. And we were at the Santa Monica Pier.

79
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:35,400
They had set up a stage on the pier by the rides on the Santa Monica Pier.

80
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:41,040
And I thought a couple of people had tweeted this at us and I was mulling it over.

81
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:46,440
Should we go do this? And then I thought our chance to see the performers live is

82
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:50,720
dwindling. Our chances are dwindling because of, as you know, full Munch.

83
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,280
Yeah, they're going away. We don't have a lot of full Munch's.

84
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:58,760
So by that, I mean, because I was set a long time ago, that's where it is.

85
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:02,720
That is a full robot set and not just one Chuck E.

86
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,720
Cheese robot, which is what a lot of these places have landed on.

87
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,880
And in some cases, in many cases, zero robots at all.

88
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:14,200
I did. I did get a little tip that there is one closest by here is a full much.

89
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,480
I have to I forget which which town.

90
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:20,000
Sunland. It's not Sunland, but I'll look it up.

91
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,560
West Hills, close to where I'm from.

92
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,600
That might still have full much. I will look at the rock.

93
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,200
I'm getting a lot here.

94
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,160
Don't think they're all.

95
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,960
No, I don't think they're full much.

96
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:32,160
It's not too far. Hold on. Let me look it up.

97
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,520
Full Munch is a weird.

98
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,000
It does sound like it's some like it's like we're like

99
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,560
it's like we're pornographers, like in a rush

100
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,040
where we have to just have a shorthand of what kind of movies we're making tomorrow.

101
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,280
And then that will be full Munch. Great.

102
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,000
Torrance. Torrance.

103
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,720
There's a full Munch in Torrance.

104
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,560
Wow. All right.

105
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,480
Yeah, I think so.

106
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,360
We're going to head out of Torrance to a full Munch.

107
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,400
Bing bang. Boom. Done.

108
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,120
Then gang bang.

109
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,360
Then towards I think. Yeah.

110
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:04,360
Also home to a location of Brewster's Ice Cream,

111
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:10,280
which is a a local establishment that started near where like right where I'm from

112
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:15,520
and like has suddenly franchised to Southern California.

113
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,840
And this is like the second time it happened or third time, I guess, too,

114
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:22,800
because Rita's Italian ice franchise out here.

115
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,160
And then in Anaheim, I was down there once and I found that Joe's Italian ice,

116
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,760
which is another like Philly.

117
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:33,720
You know, Joe, I don't know Joe personally, but they used to be everywhere.

118
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,880
Did you have but you sampled Joe's ice?

119
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:40,360
I sampled Joe's ice both in Southern California and back in Pennsylvania.

120
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:45,560
So Torrance could see a full Munch and then go get some fresh made

121
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,160
Joe's ice cream.

122
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:50,480
Not from there was one crucial name in there that was missing, though,

123
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,440
and that's Mike Gambuza.

124
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,880
And that's the name Mike Gambuza is around.

125
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,640
I don't know if I care about this Italian ice.

126
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:00,160
I well, no, no, the Torrance has a Brewster's ice cream.

127
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,840
The Italian ice is in Anaheim.

128
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,120
Oh, sorry. I got confused.

129
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,720
Oh, I see. So you get a little Brewster and then a full Munch.

130
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,800
Yes. OK. OK.

131
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,720
You munch on Brewster's and see a full Munch.

132
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,560
Yes. OK. It's your day in Torrance.

133
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,560
Nice. Sounds nice.

134
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:19,760
Mm hmm. So so that's why I thought, OK, we really do have to see them

135
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:23,720
because our opportunities to see this band live are going away.

136
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,040
Just like the Rolling Stones.

137
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,240
Members, one of them just got covid.

138
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:32,640
I don't that much as make with man hasn't been very forthcoming with this.

139
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:36,920
We don't know if Jasper ever had about if he's got long covid.

140
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:40,000
I'd spoil or alert. They say Pasquale is not there.

141
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,600
He's back home.

142
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,560
So he may have had a positive covid test.

143
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,760
Oh, was that a euphemism? Might have been. Yeah.

144
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,160
Yeah. They're like, oh, Pasquale is back home.

145
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,880
He's in the pizza kitchen.

146
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:52,160
Wink, wink. I got negative.

147
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:55,520
I hope I get the back on tour.

148
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,160
What are we supposed to tell Jasper?

149
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,280
What are we supposed to tell everybody?

150
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,120
We can't we can't.

151
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,520
But these kids don't even know what covid is.

152
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,240
We can't say they're going to be begging to see Pasquale.

153
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,080
Just get the session guy, you know, just get there.

154
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,360
There's so many good people out there these days.

155
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,920
You know, they know you, Pasquale.

156
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:17,840
They don't they're we can't just shove a mustache on any idiot.

157
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,160
I know they're lapping me on SoundCloud and Bandcamp.

158
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,400
I don't know. These kids are doing in their house in their bedrooms.

159
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,000
No way.

160
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,440
I'm the greatest musician of your generation, of any generation.

161
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:37,280
I am mainlining Pex Floyd drug to take so I can get back on the tour super fast.

162
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,440
Now I've got it.

163
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,080
We'll tell him you're at home making pizzas.

164
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,080
It's a foolproof excuse.

165
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,960
Chuckie, you already got me

166
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,320
sick feeding me the horse eye for Becton.

167
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,680
What are you doing?

168
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:53,480
That's that's I didn't take enough of it.

169
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:57,600
And at the right temperature, that brings up an actual interesting idea.

170
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:02,560
You doing sort of classic Chuck's voice is maybe classic Chuckie is still alive.

171
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,600
Oh, he's actually the sort of behind the scenes guy.

172
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:10,960
And this new mouse Chuckie is like a young actor kind of a guy.

173
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,560
Oh, he hired some energetic guy with kind of like

174
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:18,320
like glee youthful energy behind the candelabra.

175
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,040
They say they don't like me anymore.

176
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,560
Behind the pizza pie.

177
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:25,440
Get one of the new kids, the new kids with the talent and the maxi.

178
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,640
Yeah. So he's back there calling shots.

179
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:31,000
Chuck, Chuck, I'm going to call you Chuck.

180
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,520
You're going to get plastic surgery to look like me

181
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:39,840
or not look less like me to look more family friendly.

182
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,640
Look, these suckers will buy anything.

183
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,520
Blippi did it. We can do it.

184
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,240
That ain't even the real Blippi.

185
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,600
They don't know their kids. They're dumb.

186
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,800
Chuckie is also like we haven't seen him in so many years.

187
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,160
So he's like old and like let himself go.

188
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,240
Like he looks crazy.

189
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:58,200
His hair's grown out like he's just sitting on a desk.

190
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,120
He's like he's got like the crazy.

191
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,520
He's got the Bill Cosby's eyes.

192
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,320
Crazy. We don't.

193
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,720
He's yeah, there's a lot going on with what Chuck with Chuck behind the scenes.

194
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,840
Chuck, he's like Howard Hughes type.

195
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
He's like like Perlmutter.

196
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,320
Yeah. CEO of Marvel.

197
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,880
There only is like three pictures, like one of which from the set,

198
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,640
one of which with Donald Trump, one of which him in the 80s or 70s.

199
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,600
Don't look at me. Don't look at me.

200
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,320
My neighbors are trying to steal my DNA.

201
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,440
Chuck's lost his mind.

202
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:33,160
He's eating his own shit more than usual.

203
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:39,000
Yeah. Baking into a pizza.

204
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I would love that.

205
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,840
Now that you're saying this, I would love to see a classic Chuck E.

206
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:47,120
Cheese just acting out the script to Robert Altman's Secret Honor,

207
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,440
which was the the late film maker.

208
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,080
Hall. Yeah.

209
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:56,920
Playing Richard Nixon, just monologuing for like 90 minutes, two hours.

210
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,720
Yeah. Sure.

211
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,560
Let's make it happen.

212
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:02,040
We find any quotes from that movie.

213
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,400
I think we're here. OK, hang on.

214
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,240
There's not like her. OK, here we go.

215
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:11,360
Uh, I am America.

216
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:15,240
I'm a winner who lost every battle up to and including the war.

217
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,680
I am not the American nightmare.

218
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,680
I'm the American dream period.

219
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,440
That's why the system works, because I am the system.

220
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,640
Oh, period. It's powerful.

221
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,640
Folks.

222
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,360
He has to be. Yeah.

223
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:35,000
Something like if the concert we saw went wrong, like,

224
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:38,080
and like everything was like going to shit and kids were rioting

225
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,320
and people were like trying to rush the stage like that.

226
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,440
Chuck would have been forced to come up on the behind the scenes

227
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,840
and make a speech like that to try to calm everybody down.

228
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,920
But he was making worse.

229
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:51,080
I've come too far to work too hard for this.

230
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:55,360
Do you want you want to look me in the eye and say I'm not America?

231
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,560
I dare you. I got bugs all over my face.

232
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,600
So what?

233
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:04,160
He's yelling this to my son.

234
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,920
Yeah. Yeah.

235
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,200
You there with the kid.

236
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,880
You know, me.

237
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,480
Let me entertain him.

238
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,920
I prove I still got it.

239
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:15,360
Charles and a cheese.

240
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,480
Don't cry.

241
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,120
You're crying because you're a quitter.

242
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,440
Together, we got it.

243
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:24,080
We got it together with me and these bugs.

244
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,960
We got it.

245
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:29,080
You'll have them to get used to them.

246
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,040
All you kids have bugs for once.

247
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,120
All you kids will have bugs one day.

248
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,960
Grow some hair on your chest.

249
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:40,800
Getting bugs is a rite of passage for a young man.

250
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,800
I'm still hung up on Mike.

251
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,960
Oh, you said, let me entertain him.

252
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:51,480
So so unexpected.

253
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,440
I can do it.

254
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,640
I'm just channeling.

255
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:58,400
I can entertain him.

256
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:01,400
The greatest entertainer on the planet.

257
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,920
You're a star. You're a fucking star.

258
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,520
Oh, I don't want to talk about the show.

259
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,320
Let's just do it.

260
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,760
Let me dive off the pier.

261
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,720
I'll do it.

262
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,640
I'll die. I got nothing left.

263
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:19,320
I'd be I'd be a coward if I didn't.

264
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,840
Eight dollars for funnel cake.

265
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,360
What is this price?

266
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,360
This guy in the hell.

267
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,680
I know who is here.

268
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,560
No more.

269
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,680
The horse leave the pier.

270
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,680
Yeah.

271
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:36,320
This used to be good and fun.

272
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,120
Now the corporations came in and ruined it.

273
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,000
The mob used to run this appear.

274
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,440
So he was so much better when the mob ran.

275
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,360
You and you are getting.

276
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,360
Chuck E. Cheese.

277
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,360
You were.

278
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,760
You were a part of them.

279
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,760
Everything was better.

280
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,920
Anyway, we saw a concert for babies at the Santa Monica Pier.

281
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,360
Is what we did.

282
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,040
It was a little too loud for babies.

283
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,080
It was too loud for me.

284
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,520
It was. We got there.

285
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,400
It was far too loud.

286
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,400
Yeah, we had a hole up in the.

287
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:12,280
My brain is so broken, I can't produce the word arcade.

288
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,040
There it is.

289
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,600
Yeah, casino, the baby casino.

290
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:20,240
I almost just said the word baby casino because I couldn't think of what arcade

291
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,040
was. People, people online I've seen refer to Chuck E.

292
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,320
Cheese as a child casino, which makes sense.

293
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,720
But yeah, you know, even better.

294
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,360
It's it's.

295
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,640
Prices and ships.

296
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:34,480
And so I was I was I was I was pretty much on time, but I was like, oh, I hope I

297
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,800
hope I'm able to find the concert.

298
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,240
Yeah, we didn't know where at the Santa Monica.

299
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,160
Yeah, because it doesn't really specify.

300
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:44,240
And I was I was just getting to the coast.

301
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,360
If you've ever been there, like you can pretty much see there's an amusement park

302
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,520
and it's on a long point, like a long pier.

303
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:54,320
And then immediately I heard, are you ready for Chuck E.

304
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,200
Cheese? Like school?

305
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,240
I was so I was like blocks away.

306
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,200
I was like a mile away and I could hear somebody screaming about Chuck E.

307
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:06,200
Cheese. And I was like, well, OK, I should be able to find this pretty easily.

308
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:07,960
And then Scott had texted me.

309
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:10,120
It was by the roller coaster, which made it even easier.

310
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:14,840
But I could have just followed the like young person screaming screams.

311
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,800
The script web, my young person.

312
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:20,600
You mean the DJ from Coast 103.5?

313
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,560
Yes. Easy listening.

314
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:26,280
You mean the morning host of the easy listening station in L.A.?

315
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,600
I might have been older than me.

316
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,800
That might have been a decent chance.

317
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:30,760
He was older than me.

318
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,600
The young ish for the young acting person.

319
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:37,640
I just think of everyone on radio as being so hip and young,

320
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:43,360
even though I don't get to radio unless you've got Moxie like the cool kids.

321
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,600
Yeah, I guess I should.

322
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,080
I actually don't think that I think of Rodney on the Rock.

323
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,880
I think of Little Stevens underground.

324
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:52,120
I think of some ancient men who on the radio.

325
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:56,240
So, yeah, it was all it was very loud,

326
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,240
which was upsetting for this.

327
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:04,240
Yeah, it's loud yelling before the concert and loud just pop songs

328
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,000
to get the energy up.

329
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,360
And then this was my son had never been to the Santa Monica Pier.

330
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:13,880
So it inspired that, which was nice and mostly pretty nice to do.

331
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:17,560
But there's another one of the things that my son is pretty scared of is

332
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:21,640
hand dry, like air dryers outside of bathrooms.

333
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,520
Those are those are like guns going off to understaff.

334
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:27,440
You never do are new on this planet and then

335
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,360
you don't know where it's coming from and why.

336
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,880
And there's so many of those.

337
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,680
So we made it down an alley.

338
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,720
There was just nothing but those going off.

339
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,800
And he's gotten calmer.

340
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,760
But it still is like he's he's literally shell shocked.

341
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,360
Not literally. There's no shells.

342
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,400
He is acting shell shocked.

343
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:47,960
And then we get down this corridor to where a man is screaming at us.

344
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:50,160
So I'm like, oh, this is maybe not the best.

345
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,560
And I think this will turn a corner and it'll be fun.

346
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,600
Yeah. But that's yeah.

347
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,320
So you were you had mentioned this, Mike.

348
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,880
You were going to go seemingly no matter what you had your heart set.

349
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:02,600
Probably. Yes. The 11 a.m. show.

350
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,240
There were two shows, 11 a.m. and 1 p.m.

351
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,400
Yes. Yeah.

352
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,960
And I wanted to go early at the pier on a Saturday.

353
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:13,280
And I kept changing my answer.

354
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:17,040
I think I was it was like, oh, Aaron, a morning.

355
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:19,760
I really got to take him for the day.

356
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,040
So do I really want to go do that?

357
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,600
And then I looked it up and like from the video that I watched.

358
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:27,000
OK, this is clearly a concert for babies.

359
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,160
This is like plush.

360
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,760
This is suited characters dancing around.

361
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,440
And I went, well, do I really want to go down there for a concert for babies?

362
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,800
And then I went, wait a minute.

363
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,640
He's a baby.

364
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,920
Baby would like a concert for babies.

365
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:44,960
Actually, this makes more sense than I was going to go solo or Mike.

366
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,280
What you do, which was to go solo.

367
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,560
Well, I was essentially you ended up with it with a kid.

368
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,320
I was so glad you brought a child with.

369
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,480
So I wasn't alone there.

370
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:54,520
Would have been.

371
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,600
Yeah, I don't know that there's a lot of solo.

372
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,640
I mean, here's the thing.

373
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,960
It's in such a wide open spot.

374
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,160
It's not so crazy.

375
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,320
There were folks wandering.

376
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:06,000
Yes. And plenty of well, yeah, it was not exactly.

377
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
It wasn't a seated situation.

378
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,080
It was still it was open.

379
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,240
G.A. Pitt. Yeah, yeah.

380
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,240
Yeah. Yeah.

381
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,280
Literally, but fucking.

382
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,520
Pit. Yeah.

383
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,440
Love someone.

384
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,680
That's what it was open.

385
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,600
People were kind of coming and going.

386
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,120
A lot of parents around.

387
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:22,920
So it's not like you.

388
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:27,480
It wasn't just like, here are 100 children who are this height

389
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,280
and then you who are my kite.

390
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:33,280
Yeah. So it was there was no issue there.

391
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:37,720
And there were like drift, like drifter to wandering into the like, it's not like

392
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,840
I would have been arrested.

393
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:40,760
Yeah. Yeah.

394
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,040
Mm hmm.

395
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,800
So but I still.

396
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:49,440
One question that I had is what you were imagining you were going to get,

397
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:54,120
because once I saw a video of it and it's people in suits going like that,

398
00:18:54,120 --> 00:19:00,080
I like that adds up and maybe I'll only go if it entertains my son for

399
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,440
for 10 minutes. Yep.

400
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:05,040
I'm not sure. Did you think you were going to get

401
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:08,440
because obviously you were saying we want to see the band and they're taking out.

402
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,800
There's no full munch.

403
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:12,280
But like this was never going to be.

404
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,600
They bring some robots out.

405
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:17,480
No, I knew there weren't hauling robots around the country.

406
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,920
I thought I didn't actually know I didn't want I went in pretty cold, cold and clean.

407
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,920
I thought maybe there was a chance we were going to see the puppets from the videos.

408
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,920
I thought perhaps it would be a puppet show, which kind of seemed fun to me.

409
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,360
Yeah. In a way, seem maybe even more fun than just the suit of characters.

410
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,520
Oh, I like we obviously like suited characters.

411
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,720
So I didn't know.

412
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:41,640
So so the draw for me kind of was thinking, oh, maybe it'll be puppets and

413
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:47,280
we'll hear the songs from the albums we've played over the years.

414
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:52,040
From the Chucky, the newer Chucky cheese and maybe even together, we got it,

415
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:55,760
which they've I've seen recently they've posted on Apple Music.

416
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,960
So I think the new band does together.

417
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,600
We got it sometimes. Right. Interesting. OK.

418
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:05,520
So I would have that would have hit you like as if you got to see.

419
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:10,000
Wow, I got to see the like when we got to see Neil Young and Paul McCartney do.

420
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,960
Why don't we do it in the road?

421
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,560
A song Paul doesn't do a lot.

422
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,240
And Neil was having a ball like you go.

423
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,320
It's a special performance.

424
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,240
Paul doesn't do this song a lot or ever.

425
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:23,480
So these touring 19 year olds dancing to

426
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,720
we've got it together, we've got it.

427
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:29,800
We've had a similar effect, similar effect or yeah, or a nice.

428
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,160
What are what are the two ones?

429
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,920
Another Chucky Day, which we've talked about before.

430
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,760
That is the Snoop Esk.

431
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,280
And then me and my friends.

432
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,280
And then me and my friends is the

433
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:44,480
bird, my friend, which is much, much, much.

434
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,320
Is that the that's the Bruno Mars Esk?

435
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,920
I think that's I got the name right.

436
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,440
Let me look just together.

437
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:55,320
We got it. The first track off the album Songs in the Key of E.

438
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:59,200
Uh huh. Is it?

439
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,000
Is it a new version of it or is it?

440
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,320
Let's let's let's see. Let's explore it.

441
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,280
So this way, so if you're following along with us,

442
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,760
if you're a Billy, I believe on Apple Music or Spotify.

443
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:09,320
Yeah. Chuck E.

444
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,760
Cheese is on there.

445
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,120
New songs coming out.

446
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:12,960
So I'm shorter.

447
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,680
Sometimes E.P.'s, you know, you want to check in and get quick hits

448
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,880
from your favorite artists. Chuck's doing it on there.

449
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,600
Yeah. So this is me and my friends.

450
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,520
Mm hmm.

451
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,160
It's time again.

452
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:22,880
All right.

453
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,040
Got brand new news and they're easy to do.

454
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:28,480
And they're all about me and my friends.

455
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,000
It's telling me and she like.

456
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,440
So they kind of go through all the kind of Bruno Mars.

457
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,440
They very well.

458
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,360
You know, very exactly. Yes.

459
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,080
Yeah. Which is a thing they do often.

460
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,160
And there's a question I have.

461
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,920
Is that allowed of like, you know, what is this parody?

462
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:43,920
Law?

463
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,280
Did you did we want to hear what their version?

464
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,000
I would like to hear whether they're.

465
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

466
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,600
How similar is this to the original?

467
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,040
Do they bring some new life to it?

468
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:56,080
OK, I think I think it sounded like the old one to me.

469
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:04,680
Ladies and gentlemen, we are proud to present to you.

470
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,240
Oh, yeah.

471
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,240
Munchies and Chilter.

472
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,400
Oh, classic.

473
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,240
Chuck E.

474
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,560
Cheese.

475
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:12,760
Hi, everybody.

476
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,040
That's me. Chuck E.

477
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:14,880
Cheese.

478
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,720
And even though this is going for super guy, I am not a star of the show.

479
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:21,840
You are because the magic only happens when.

480
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,920
Just make money and we're going to make you.

481
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,960
We've got it together.

482
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,680
We got it.

483
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:32,320
We've got it together with you.

484
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:36,000
We got it together forever.

485
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,720
They just begun.

486
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,640
This man is number one.

487
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:42,920
Maybe they've like re recorded over the Chucky voice

488
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:46,160
with the bowling for soup guy who now does if you're just catching up

489
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,640
the lead singer of the band bowling for soup, does Chucky

490
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,840
Cheese's singing and speaking voice?

491
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,200
Yeah.

492
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,600
Jared Reddick, Jared Reddick.

493
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,720
So it sounds like, yeah, he's on that track, but it sounds like the classic.

494
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,080
I don't know. I'm not sure if they recorded it.

495
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,840
Is it is it a situation where they didn't have the masters

496
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:05,960
where they had to be record?

497
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:08,560
Oh, like Taylor's version, like Taylor's version, right?

498
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,120
Chucky is Chucky's version.

499
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:14,080
Well, that might be it is Chucky himself is the stand in for

500
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,320
awful guy who's the shooter brawn.

501
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,880
Scooter brawn. Yeah.

502
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,920
Yeah.

503
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,560
I guess you can't do it.

504
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:24,160
I'm giving you my name, but not the masters.

505
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,080
I own the masters kid.

506
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,920
I own you.

507
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:32,120
I got a 360 deal on you.

508
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
No, no, that's that

509
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:38,120
eviscerating new 10 minute version of

510
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:42,360
I love pepperoni really tore me a new asshole.

511
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:49,040
Who knew the new check would elevate the form by remaking all the old songs?

512
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:51,240
Yeah, it's been coming.

513
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,680
I eat it, Scooter piece of shit.

514
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:59,720
So, yeah, so so there's some classics on the Apple Music.

515
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,960
And then there's a lot on Spotify.

516
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,360
There's a lot of music, a lot on YouTube.

517
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,400
There's so many songs.

518
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,440
We've played them on our previous Chuck E.

519
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,120
Cheese episodes.

520
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:13,360
So, yeah, I was going down, yeah, for the idea that maybe it was puppets.

521
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,960
Still happy about seeing people in suits.

522
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:20,320
But then to hear some of those classic songs we've talked about.

523
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:26,040
And I was a little bit sad and to learn those songs are not in the setlist.

524
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:30,040
Yeah, none of the songs I was hoping to hear are in the setlist.

525
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:33,720
So you brought I need to hear the hits energy

526
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:36,920
to this show of a cartoon mouse and bird.

527
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,880
That's right. You were like, can I guess?

528
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,600
I'll go to the bathroom.

529
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,320
And here's the deal.

530
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:45,360
I normally do not like this behavior at a concert.

531
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:49,440
Usually when I not all the time, but I'll go to a concert and I'm a snooty

532
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,040
concert goer.

533
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:54,480
If they do just all the hits, I go, OK, we know.

534
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:56,960
We know this is your like Vegas setlist.

535
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,920
Give us a little bit of the obscure.

536
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:02,000
Give us a little. That's usually how I am.

537
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,160
You're the guy going, play the new album.

538
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:07,760
Well, not always that depending on who the band is.

539
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,200
Not always that buffetters Sammy Hagar.

540
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,960
Well, the new puppet album, I would be on that actually.

541
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,880
And the last one was good because it has the song Cousin Island,

542
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,280
which is one of my favorites.

543
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,520
What's what happens?

544
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,840
Wait, sorry. Is that Cousin Island or Cousin?

545
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,680
No, no, not Cousin Island.

546
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:26,560
That's a dozen album.

547
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,040
Hang out with your cousins on an island.

548
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:31,080
Yeah, hang out with cousin on island.

549
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,480
Thanks for the song. Oh, it's written.

550
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,400
I finished it.

551
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:39,200
Cousin Island, which is about like parents on a road trip with kids.

552
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:40,880
It's very confused.

553
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,120
The song is very confusing.

554
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:46,080
And we presented this before you introduced what Cousin Island was.

555
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,680
You presented this as a good album and a good song.

556
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:51,560
Now you can continue to explain.

557
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:54,960
It's a classic Buffett song that doesn't make much sense

558
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,800
and is really odd.

559
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:59,840
Fruitcakes is obviously the king of that is that's the top one

560
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,080
where you're like, what is this song?

561
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:06,240
And Cousin Island is in that tradition of kind of confusing narrative

562
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,080
that he is.

563
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,000
That's a long song.

564
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,280
I feel like maybe it's like five minutes, six minutes.

565
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:15,600
Cruising down the coast of Panama with my kids, snorkeling with the stingrays,

566
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:20,400
kudos and the squids, kudos, of course, shortening of barracuda.

567
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,160
Yeah, got it. Jimmy, no need to explain.

568
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:26,720
Uh, there's a song he has on an album called like Who Gets...

569
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:29,240
Oh, yeah, go ahead with the young lady.

570
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:32,480
Did I just hear you call your brother a stupid little shit?

571
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,080
Yeah, right. Exactly. This is what I'm saying.

572
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,400
You know, you're not allowed to use those words now.

573
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,200
Apologize, lickety split.

574
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,840
Like what? Like, huh?

575
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:43,080
I feel like he used to have more of an angle of like, well, parents

576
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,840
just don't understand.

577
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:47,720
Well, then now he's like, parents do understand and they're right.

578
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,160
Kids are saying shit.

579
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:51,680
And I know I'm saying it too, but it's to prove a point.

580
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:55,800
You send your daughter to goddamn NYU and she's like, I can do social media.

581
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:58,560
That's like, I guess I'm giving her a job.

582
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,600
Uh, it doesn't say shitless.

583
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:03,640
Like he said something about like that's some shit list.

584
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,920
He says shit like twice, I think, in that song.

585
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:08,280
Jimmy. So he's cursing up a storm.

586
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,960
It's very confusing. And the song is called Cussin Island.

587
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,280
And then, yeah, there's other songs on that album like,

588
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,760
who gets to live like this?

589
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:19,480
Like, blunk, blunk, blunk, blunk, blunk, blunk, blunk, blunk, blunk, blunk.

590
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,680
Let me think.

591
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:24,160
Oh, now that you now that you mention it.

592
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:29,160
Don't do, don't do, don't do.

593
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,280
I mean, I guess we got to play a little bit of it now,

594
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:34,440
Cussin Island, now that you've called for it.

595
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:37,120
There's a song called Who Who Gets to Live Like This?

596
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,800
We were like, is this really like appropriate for a billionaire

597
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,680
to be writing a song like this? Yeah.

598
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,160
Like, we know you do.

599
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,320
The answer is you.

600
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:47,280
You're not like like 25 anymore.

601
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:48,960
Do they think they do?

602
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:49,920
I think.

603
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,680
Oh, no, it's a world of difference.

604
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,560
No, Mr. Rogers.

605
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:59,240
It's Jimmy.

606
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,240
With the little tail.

607
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,680
It's Jimmy.

608
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,600
Oh, maybe you like this.

609
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:09,520
I know I never should have written this song.

610
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:16,080
I know I'm in trouble if you can't sing along.

611
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:23,080
This is my heart goes out to Lindsey so hard right now.

612
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,040
I just really want to give her my sympathy.

613
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:31,160
And I know the same thing like for the times that you have said,

614
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,200
have you heard Cussin Island?

615
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,360
And she said yes. And then you still play it.

616
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:37,880
She does. She does not like Cussin Island.

617
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:42,360
I don't think I'm saying something out of school here.

618
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,680
She does like the lead singer down at the lot.

619
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,520
The lead single down at the Lottie.

620
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,640
She does like that one.

621
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,640
Jason likes it too.

622
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,640
Yeah.

623
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,080
The Devil I Know, also a good song from that album.

624
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:56,280
OK. I feel like Eva was not pro down at the Lottie.

625
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:59,120
I feel like she didn't have teeth.

626
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,720
I'm this is early pandemic.

627
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,400
Hey, it came out early in the pandemic.

628
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,000
And it was a it was an oasis.

629
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,320
We were discussing down at the Lottie.

630
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,880
Yeah. It's you know what it's about.

631
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:12,120
It's about drinking a margarita at a bar.

632
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,880
Jimmy Explorers and clap like the monkey.

633
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,760
I clap like the audience at the Chucky show.

634
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:24,440
So your point was that the Chucky band did Cussin Island.

635
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:27,400
So so you were disappointed you didn't know it.

636
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,920
But when you realized there's a full cover of Cussin Island,

637
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,360
I'll give you my full concert.

638
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:36,520
Yeah, yeah. My my concert opinions in general are like I like the band.

639
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:39,640
Did not just give you the the greatest hits album.

640
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:43,080
But I was I mean, it's a short first of all, short show.

641
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:45,880
I was thinking they playing for an hour at least.

642
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,400
They only gave us like 20 minutes.

643
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:50,880
Thank God it was free because I give Chuck my money.

644
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,440
I want triple encore.

645
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:56,040
But but yeah, I thought at least we get one of these.

646
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,520
And it was mostly new stuff.

647
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:01,120
And you really you genuinely.

648
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,440
Yeah, it's not under the hits.

649
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:05,720
You know, yeah, you know, so I said it to you.

650
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:08,160
I go, I hope they play me and my friend, me and my friends.

651
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:08,800
I said it to you.

652
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,760
So it wasn't it was an active thought I had.

653
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:13,760
Well, my other favorite thing that was said before the concert began

654
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:18,120
is that you were still kind of trying to make heads or tails of of what this was.

655
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:21,560
And at some point you said, God, it's so like, well, like,

656
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,440
what's this going to be like? Who's going to be here?

657
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,600
What like Chuck fans?

658
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:31,360
It's like I think what it is is babies for a baby concert.

659
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,640
It is a baby. You're not wrong.

660
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,640
It is a baby concert.

661
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,800
We went to a baby concert.

662
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:37,560
But I was like, are there like Chuck E.

663
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:40,080
Cheeseheads that are coming out for this?

664
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:43,840
Because how many people do you think were actually

665
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:48,200
standing there had come with purpose to see it?

666
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,640
Couple families, you guys.

667
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,840
And did you run into Jamie Loftus or did you go to the one?

668
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:59,040
I thought about a messaging or about this, but I feel like

669
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,360
that's too much of a weird thing to say to somebody.

670
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:02,800
Do you want to go to the Chuck E.

671
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:03,720
Cheese show?

672
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,600
Do you want to see Chuck at the pier?

673
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,840
Like maybe if all three of us were going for sure.

674
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,600
But it was like, hey, do you want to go to the Chuck E.

675
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,800
Cheese show? Like, I'm not going to.

676
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,280
That's not well.

677
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,440
She will do Chuck E.

678
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,360
Cheese three proper eventually.

679
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,120
Yeah. But this is a concert review.

680
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,760
So check out her podcast, Ghost Church.

681
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,360
It's really good. Oh, sure.

682
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,240
I like to listen to it. Yep.

683
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:27,960
So, yeah. So, no, there were a couple of families.

684
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,920
Unclear. I didn't go up and pull them.

685
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:32,560
Did you come here on purpose or were you here already?

686
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:34,360
Why are you here? Why are you here?

687
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,560
Excuse me. Why are you here?

688
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:38,160
Hey, can I take an informal poll?

689
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:42,160
I try to get on stage and wrestle that morning DJ out of the way.

690
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:45,400
Can I take a quick, informal poll?

691
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,600
I really want to get a microphone. It's a emergency.

692
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:51,760
I have a Patreon exclusive podcast that I need to I need to fill with content.

693
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,560
I need to know the level of irony with these four year olds.

694
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:58,640
Do you like this version of Chuck or the old one?

695
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,480
Let me show you a photo on my phone.

696
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,480
I know it's bright out here, but you have to squint.

697
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,880
So so, yeah. So there were.

698
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:08,360
But people were I will say the people there were psyched.

699
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,520
I think they were in the joint.

700
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:12,800
I mean, the music gave you no choice but to be psyched.

701
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,200
It was so loud.

702
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:17,520
It was not as loud as when I saw the Yeezus tour,

703
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:21,320
which I think I brought up before, where the Yeezus tour base,

704
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:26,800
which was at the now crypto dot com, then the Staples Center, the Yeezus tour base.

705
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:30,400
My heart felt like it could stop it.

706
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,560
Like the base felt like it could stop my heart.

707
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:35,240
It was so like crazy loud and resonating.

708
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,760
And I remember, like, finally, like after five or 10 minutes,

709
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:41,760
getting used to my heart now going along with whatever the rhythm of

710
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,960
the Yeezus songs were.

711
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:47,400
So the so the current popular rapper,

712
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:51,720
Kanye West, had a louder bass than the concert for babies.

713
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:54,760
Yes. But I'm just saying the concert for babies was very loud.

714
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,840
Louder than concert for babies.

715
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:59,800
I'm seeing a lot of anything that I take my boy to see.

716
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:00,800
I was I was worried.

717
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:03,720
I was like, oh, God, like these kids are going to like their hearing

718
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:04,880
is going to be affected.

719
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,160
I can't get earplugs into those little ears.

720
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:09,120
Right. If they make so.

721
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,480
So, yeah. So people there were psyched.

722
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:13,160
There were there were tents out.

723
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,960
They had a lot of Chucky representatives.

724
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,120
There were just there were two tents out. Yes.

725
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:20,800
My memory is there were 50.

726
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:23,760
But I guess two, I guess two is right.

727
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:27,600
I'm still a little hung up on you saying you had to find the venue,

728
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:30,160
which if you've never been at the Santa Monica Pier,

729
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:33,680
you just keep walking towards the ocean until you hit a railing.

730
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:37,240
Right. But there's like a little bit behind.

731
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:39,320
It was they essentially took over the parking lot.

732
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:41,840
Like, I figured I'd find it.

733
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:44,920
I wasn't too concerned, but it was tucked behind some stuff.

734
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:50,000
They took over the parking lot where Rockford would park his Winnebago

735
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,360
and the Rockford files. That sounds right. Yes.

736
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:54,120
Yeah, thereabouts. Thereabouts.

737
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:56,840
It might be another beach town. You'd be wrong.

738
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:58,480
So, yeah, no. So I found it.

739
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,800
I found it by following the voice.

740
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,520
I found it by following the hype.

741
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:04,560
And, you know, we went over there and we waited a little bit.

742
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:07,080
I got there like 10 minutes before the show started.

743
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:09,320
But so they had two tents.

744
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,560
One was selling shirts.

745
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:14,360
One was giving out, Jason, you'll like this and you're going to kick yourself.

746
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:18,080
You didn't go. Free sunglasses, free waters.

747
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:20,800
Oh, well. And I know you like a free water.

748
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:23,200
I love a free water, especially in this heat.

749
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,800
I know I needed it. I actually did not come prepared.

750
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,560
No, I needed it too. It helped dad out.

751
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:28,320
And they were helping.

752
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,200
They were walking around with the waters, too.

753
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:31,000
So like they were.

754
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:35,760
And I saw like Chucky team representatives down by the pier,

755
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,640
like trying to get people in.

756
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:40,360
Like there were a lot of his street team out.

757
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:43,080
I think there were more people working it than attending it.

758
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,800
Yes, absolutely.

759
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,160
So there were shirts.

760
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:47,080
I looked at the shirts.

761
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:49,520
Nothing was retro enough to justify it.

762
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,000
But not bad.

763
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,040
I think they were only like 12 or 15 bucks, which, you know, that's good

764
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:57,840
because, you know, concert shirts now 30, 35 bucks, 40 bucks.

765
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:02,160
Sure. So the baby concert has not followed the trends of the general concert.

766
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,200
Exactly. Yes.

767
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:08,240
So this free concert, free baby concert was not trying to milk us

768
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,520
if we wanted a free shirt.

769
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:14,040
I mean, babies are smaller also, so you don't need as much shirt.

770
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,480
The shirts looked big, though.

771
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,960
The shirts looked for adult like they were from big shirts to.

772
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:21,400
Yeah, sunglasses of all sizes, which is, you know.

773
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,200
Yeah, I have my sunglasses.

774
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,440
I have them in. I think I left them in the car.

775
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:28,720
But I've been wearing them on when I walked in or you had them on your head.

776
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:31,440
I thought somewhere they're in the bag or something because I had them.

777
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:33,880
Yeah. So we got free sunglasses.

778
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:36,640
And at that point, I thought, is it winter ready? Yeah.

779
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:39,240
I'm out in the sun. I haven't been on the pier in years.

780
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,800
Free sunglasses, free water. Great.

781
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,360
You're doing great.

782
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:50,560
So so the the whole show starts pretty quickly.

783
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:54,200
They do some banter up top and they go into the show right away.

784
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:58,720
Now, I was happy to learn, especially for the purposes of this episode,

785
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:04,200
the entire show verbatim is on Apple Music and Spotify's and Spotify.

786
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:08,680
Yes. So if you want, you can experience this.

787
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,800
This is already a perfect live.

788
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:14,040
You can experience this when we play it through the microphones right now.

789
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:16,120
That's right. Or you could go and do it.

790
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,040
You do it yourself.

791
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:20,640
Well, they can't because it's the last show, I think, is in Fort Worth.

792
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,880
And it's in the past. Oh, I mean, this is coming up.

793
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:25,920
I mean, they sort of could do it on their own speaker.

794
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,640
And then they could take it on a run or a date.

795
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:32,240
Which album they put on the summer fun album,

796
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:36,600
summer concert tour, parentheses live exclamation point,

797
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,840
which you did, you're texting about logistics of this episode.

798
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:43,760
You said, well, the live album is up on you did refer to it as a live album.

799
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,560
Oh, did I? Mm hmm.

800
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:49,200
OK. I remember that, by the way, it is it's called live.

801
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:52,120
So, yeah, yes, yes.

802
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:54,560
So guess I guess it's not a studio.

803
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:55,880
It's not a studio.

804
00:36:55,880 --> 00:37:00,960
So but if you hear it, though, that yeah, what this album is, is a lot of

805
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:05,000
it is it's all the things that happen, including all of the narration of the

806
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:10,760
it is the full soundtrack of the show mixed with some very optimistic ideas

807
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:14,960
of what applause would or could be, because there's parts where the

808
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:18,240
cheering is very loud, there's parts where jokes kill.

809
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,880
There's even parts where there is a full audience.

810
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:25,800
Oh, which again, when you're looking at a crowd of three year olds,

811
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:30,040
probably you're not getting a perfect sound, perfect full house level.

812
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,760
Oh, right.

813
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:36,800
So, yeah, they they the ideal reception is was the way they sweetened this.

814
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,600
I imagined it. Yeah.

815
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:41,360
And the show is basically the suited characters.

816
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:45,920
And then there's a human named Jesse that is sort of like helped to wrangle them.

817
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:49,040
I mean, I guess we can play a little similar to the little shows

818
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:53,200
that I like at Knott's Berry Farm, where there is one human and then all peanuts.

819
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:56,840
Yeah. And the human helps the peanuts to dance and get in the spirit,

820
00:37:56,840 --> 00:38:01,280
but also to see and know where they're landing and standing.

821
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:04,440
Yeah. Jesse, nice gender neutral name.

822
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,160
Right. Could be changed by. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

823
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:10,360
So just I mean, this you probably get the picture, but it's like.

824
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:14,080
Hi, everyone.

825
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,880
Thanks for joining us for the Chuck E.

826
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:18,360
Cheese Summer of Fun concert.

827
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:21,320
My name is Jesse and I'll be your host today.

828
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:25,960
And now what do you guys say we get this party started?

829
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,200
So they bring out Chuck E.

830
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,360
and Munch at that point.

831
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:34,240
Yeah, that's kind of the minimal much like stop making sense.

832
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:39,080
The band comes out in waves and the concert experience builds before your very eyes.

833
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:42,800
And yes, it's it's it's because of that, and it's not because they need to give

834
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:46,640
the performers breaks from being in 90 degree heat in these suits.

835
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:49,400
So they stagger all beach side.

836
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,520
They stagger everyone doing it.

837
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:56,520
They have tents. You can see they're changing tents very obviously behind.

838
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:57,880
Right behind that. Yeah. Yeah.

839
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:02,680
But Munch is the bare minimum you need for a concert because he is the DJ.

840
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:07,600
So he's doing his DJ act like like when we talked about that one Halloween.

841
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,440
With the head. Yeah, he's not in the head.

842
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,280
He's not in the dead mouse.

843
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:12,840
Not in the dead mouse. Which would be very awful in the heat.

844
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,280
I would have gone nuts for that.

845
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:17,040
You're called upon in many cases to say hit it.

846
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,680
DJ Munch, which is far bigger, certain things.

847
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:21,600
You would have liked that, Jason.

848
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,400
OK, you would have liked it.

849
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,520
What would have been nice.

850
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:26,520
So they do. They do.

851
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:31,000
It sounded like a threat the way you said you would have liked it.

852
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,200
You would have liked it.

853
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,280
You would have liked it.

854
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,360
Like you would have liked it.

855
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:39,160
Ren for Ren.

856
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:41,080
You idiot.

857
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,600
So so they do it.

858
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:45,480
So they do it. The first song, I think the song starts playing and I go,

859
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:50,080
Scott must be in heaven here because it is called.

860
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:54,080
What I'm supposed to think is very bad, particularly

861
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:59,120
a sort of early Beach Boys sound like song.

862
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,320
So it's not exactly outside.

863
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:07,920
So it's not because it was way too many things to be happy about.

864
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:09,120
Wait, I missed it. I missed it.

865
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:11,440
Wait, wait, wait. What's happening?

866
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:16,160
To talk to the beach ball.

867
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,240
Dive in the ocean.

868
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:21,040
Let's get your way.

869
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:23,000
So.

870
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:28,160
I'm sorry, since when do I do the show with a couple of angels

871
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:31,720
because I ended up in heaven?

872
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:33,280
But I thought I go, OK, good.

873
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,320
They're not going to lose, Scott.

874
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,640
They got Scott right away.

875
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:36,840
His beach party stuff.

876
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,720
He loves the surf and the sun.

877
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:41,080
Oh, boy. And they started off with a bang.

878
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:43,400
Don't leave the sand in the sand, of course.

879
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:46,280
So so that's a quicker.

880
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:50,000
Got my got my boy going to he's so he's been to Chuck E.

881
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,200
Cheese just in an organic way.

882
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:55,040
He'll go and then like press every arcade button,

883
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:58,200
but not actually play the game and then get bored after 20 minutes.

884
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,600
But he's familiar.

885
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,640
I felt the recognition of Chuck E.

886
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:04,880
Cheese when he came out and being impressed by the Chuck E.

887
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,640
Cheese was very close to him.

888
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:13,120
And and the dad had muscled his way up and secured some roughly fourth row seats.

889
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:16,720
So he definitely was like, whoa, like he got it.

890
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:17,720
The Chuck E.

891
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:20,360
Cheese is not usually right in front of his face. Right.

892
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:21,720
So I felt I felt good about it.

893
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:24,320
This will work for for baby means.

894
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:26,480
Well, that's good. Yeah, I wasn't sure.

895
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:31,120
I wasn't sure how he was was was receiving his you and you guys rushed

896
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:35,360
the front of the stage, which is what I which I did not do because I'm a tall guy.

897
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:36,800
A lot of kids there.

898
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:40,600
I thought maybe that would be improper for me to just start pushing kids out of the way

899
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,160
to get to the front of the stage.

900
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:45,120
Why you have a kid so right in front of you at a room.

901
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:46,800
Yeah, no, no problem.

902
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:49,280
So I hung back to be a good spectator.

903
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,600
Good, good. But I was wondering Chuck.

904
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:53,880
All to pass it off as a baby.

905
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:56,480
Right. I didn't pull a Billy Zane.

906
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,320
I didn't pull out a child.

907
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:00,000
I didn't pull a Rex Harrison, Dr.

908
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,720
Doolittle and grab a seal, put a wig on it.

909
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:05,920
Let me through.

910
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,480
Let me front row center.

911
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:14,000
Your old your old instincts from like those black flag concerts didn't kick.

912
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:17,200
Kick in. You didn't get in the pit and start kicking people.

913
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,400
Nope, it didn't happen.

914
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,480
So so yeah, I'm glad that he was enjoying it.

915
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:25,040
They do some like narrative stuff, which always happened like what happened?

916
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:28,360
You were supposed to pick Pasquale and Helen Henny up.

917
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,200
And yeah, well, this is OK.

918
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,240
We talked about this a little bit.

919
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:34,600
This is my favorite part of the show is that for a minute

920
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:38,120
I wondered, is this going to only be Chuck E.

921
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:43,000
Cheese and Munch? And then there is some well, here's the big runner is

922
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:46,080
Jesse, the human encouraging Chuck E.

923
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:49,520
and being so excited to hear Chuck E.'s song of the summer.

924
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:53,200
Yes. Yes. And a lot of requests to hear this song.

925
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,920
And he denies her. Yeah. Over and over again.

926
00:42:55,920 --> 00:43:01,800
Each time. And then in this first case, he doesn't feel up to it

927
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:04,320
because all of his friends aren't there.

928
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:06,560
And you start to wonder, are they just not here at all?

929
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:08,640
And we're going through them one by one.

930
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:12,360
Well, I know Pasquale had to stay back and make pizzas.

931
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:14,760
So Pasquale has been written out of the show.

932
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:16,120
He's got to work.

933
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:18,200
Look, he set up that ghost kitchen.

934
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:19,080
He knew what he was.

935
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:21,280
He was he knew he was shooting himself in the foot.

936
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,200
The Earls are on his ass every day.

937
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:26,360
Robert and Robbie.

938
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:28,600
He's losing ground in the breakfast club.

939
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:33,440
And Bella is on vacation with her family.

940
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,360
And you so I can't. And that, yeah, I think.

941
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:37,200
I got to me and he goes, who's Bella?

942
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:39,920
Bella. I do. You know, Bella.

943
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:41,440
I think we learned about Bella.

944
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:43,000
I don't think it was on the microphone.

945
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,760
I have died on have Bella in my brain.

946
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:46,960
We may have learned about her off, Mike.

947
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:50,720
Bella is a new character who depends on the source.

948
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:55,280
I think some people consider Bella a member of the Make Believe band.

949
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:57,960
Right. Bella is.

950
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:00,080
Wait, I had the info about Bella.

951
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:01,920
Bella is a bunny.

952
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:04,280
But also known as Bella B.

953
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:08,880
And so and that's it's a diverse

954
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:11,760
pick and she's bilingual.

955
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:13,680
OK, things things in Spanish.

956
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:15,120
So this is a good there.

957
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:18,960
There hasn't been a new edition, I would say, in a long time.

958
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,360
So Bella's around.

959
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:23,240
But it's an odd way for this is only since twenty twenty.

960
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:24,520
Right. And something new.

961
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:25,920
Yes. Something new.

962
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:27,920
Somebody new showed up in a band in twenty twenty.

963
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:29,520
I don't even know that it happened.

964
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:31,320
There's an odd way to get this information.

965
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:32,440
I don't know.

966
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:35,440
This would have been a great way to introduce the world to Bella.

967
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:37,640
So that's maybe a complaint.

968
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:40,680
Don't just mention Bella and make me take me out of the concert

969
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:41,880
to have to look it up.

970
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:43,880
Is Bella trying to like.

971
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:45,640
Yeah, I got to look up Bella.

972
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:46,360
Don't leave.

973
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:49,680
Like when the Rolling Stones added Ron Wood, I mean, they they didn't say like,

974
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:52,280
oh, yeah, he's playing on the album, but he's not on tour with us.

975
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:53,680
A bit of fanfare.

976
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:58,680
Yeah. And so you're both in the crowd going, what's the continuity of this?

977
00:44:58,760 --> 00:44:59,840
Like, what are we?

978
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:01,880
Sorry, Bella.

979
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:04,280
I know. I know these.

980
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:07,080
I know everything you're saying was recorded two months ago, but

981
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:10,160
can you answer me this?

982
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:13,840
Bella is kind of like Linda McCartney and that she was a member of Wings.

983
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:17,640
But on the McCartney solo record, she's credited on some of the tracks,

984
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:19,400
but not everything. Yeah.

985
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:21,040
Yeah. Mm hmm.

986
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:23,880
So keyboardists. Yeah.

987
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:26,880
So we welcome Bella, but Bella's not there.

988
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:29,360
So you're starting to go, oh, my God, none of Chuck's friends are here.

989
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:31,760
We're never going to hear the song of the summer. Right.

990
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:34,800
But luckily, there's two of the heavy hitters roll up.

991
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,080
Thank goodness. All is lost.

992
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:39,280
Jasper and dog and Helen Helen.

993
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:42,000
So yeah, she's a bird hen.

994
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:43,840
Yes, they're out.

995
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:51,120
So now this concert can really kick into gear and they can do a song.

996
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:53,400
What did they do? There's a song that's kind of in that like,

997
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:57,640
like, like, did it?

998
00:45:57,640 --> 00:45:58,440
It didn't. It didn't.

999
00:45:58,440 --> 00:45:59,920
And I play did it. It did.

1000
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:02,600
It's like a little like I don't even know what genre it is.

1001
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:04,160
I'm trying to call this is.

1002
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:05,680
They kept saying play in that really.

1003
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:09,720
Yeah, it's it's it's let's let me let me pull it up here.

1004
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:14,080
It is a modern I'm trying to think what modern song it is.

1005
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:19,000
And I can't I can't place it like Cardi B a little maybe a little bit.

1006
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,600
Yeah. I mean, I think there's a couple of songs that's like in the style of

1007
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:24,320
it's a popular style of music these days.

1008
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:26,840
That's the way I believe.

1009
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:28,400
So hold on. Let me see.

1010
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:30,280
I have to gear. I don't know why I shut it off.

1011
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:32,600
But yeah, Chuckie does look.

1012
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:35,400
We know he can. We know he can rap.

1013
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:37,440
Yeah. Well, one of his great strengths.

1014
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:39,280
Yeah. You got to bring to the live venue.

1015
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:41,280
All you can play.

1016
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:43,160
Play all you can play.

1017
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:47,760
As much as you can make time every day to get into playing and make it a plan.

1018
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:48,680
Plan on it.

1019
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:50,520
We're banishing boredom.

1020
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:52,280
Before it's begun.

1021
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:55,600
We'll chase it away because you'll find a way to make anything fun when you play.

1022
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:57,040
Play. All you can play.

1023
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:58,840
Play. Just look for the game.

1024
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:01,000
Find it and you'll find right away that you're working.

1025
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:04,280
One of the same plays important in playtime is gold.

1026
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:05,280
Now more than ever.

1027
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:06,280
So we got it.

1028
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:07,600
We got it.

1029
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:09,280
We didn't get to Chuckie's verse.

1030
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:12,360
That is that is another one where it's just like the music is another song.

1031
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:14,720
And I apologize. People are yelling it, I'm sure.

1032
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:17,040
What that modern song is.

1033
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:25,600
But yes, Chuck has a verse and it's do I like it is what I'm trying to figure out

1034
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:26,880
right now as we're talking about it.

1035
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:30,080
I think I do like it, but it is funny.

1036
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:31,440
I kind of like it.

1037
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:33,960
I still was like amused by it.

1038
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:37,360
I was still like I wish this was, I don't know, another Chuckie day or something.

1039
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:39,040
But I still was OK.

1040
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:41,720
I can get into this. OK.

1041
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:43,200
So they do that.

1042
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:47,960
And then then they have to get Chuckie a munch off the stage before they overheat,

1043
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:48,840
before they collapse.

1044
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:51,800
Chuckie needs a break because Chuckie's been out there a long time.

1045
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:56,720
So they leave Jasper and Helen up there to do a song.

1046
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:59,520
Oh, at this point, I think you were around me.

1047
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:04,120
And I look and I kind of peeked over and I saw Jasper had a guitar strapped.

1048
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:07,440
Yeah. And I was like, oh, baby, here we go.

1049
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:11,920
For a second, I thought, oh, maybe the performer will play it live.

1050
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:14,480
And then I went, what are you going to suddenly?

1051
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:18,120
I said, for a second, any of human hands, the rest of the show?

1052
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:19,840
No, I know.

1053
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:21,760
Of course, it's wrong. I said a half second.

1054
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:24,360
I went, I wonder if I wonder if.

1055
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:25,960
And I went, no, of course, he's not going to do it.

1056
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:29,360
What do you. But it was it was, you know, it was because you were you're reacting.

1057
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:31,840
You were watching this through the eyes of a three year.

1058
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,240
You were thinking everything a three year old would think.

1059
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:36,560
But here's the thing. He it was a real guitar.

1060
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:38,560
Why not get like a fake guitar?

1061
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:40,280
Why not just like a. Yeah. Really?

1062
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:42,160
It had strings and I believe so.

1063
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:43,680
It was a real guitar. It was heavy.

1064
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:45,400
I was like, why did they just get a fake guitar?

1065
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:48,120
Like when you get the wooden guitar and pretend fake guitar,

1066
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:51,480
the Chuck E. Cheese Corporation has access to fake instruments.

1067
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:54,760
You're waiting for him to come out on stage and just start going.

1068
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:58,160
There is a house in New York.

1069
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:01,360
Like you're at a Jeremy Renner show.

1070
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:03,120
Driving house on the rise.

1071
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:06,320
Something you I guarantee you will be at at some point in your life.

1072
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:07,680
Oh, I'll go to a Jeremy Renner concert.

1073
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:10,080
Oh, man. The medicine.

1074
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:12,560
That's been definitely delayed since 2020.

1075
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:14,960
I will go see Jeremy Renner any day of the week.

1076
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:17,720
We got to hit you got to hit Johnny Depp and Jeff Beckford.

1077
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:20,000
She Johnny Depp concert.

1078
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:24,280
This is the was this song.

1079
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:27,440
The song about the first time we're going to hear it.

1080
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:29,160
Johnny Depp.

1081
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:31,400
It was it's a shit show.

1082
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:34,360
Johnny Depp is doing an album with 77 year old Jeff Beck.

1083
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:37,080
And the first single is called A Song for Hedy Lamar.

1084
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:42,160
Hedy Lamar, which is a fucking Bowie ripoff song.

1085
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:43,800
It's about her inventions.

1086
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:46,320
Right. But it's actually about Johnny.

1087
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,720
OK, like that's really what it's about.

1088
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:50,240
He didn't help win the war.

1089
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:53,200
Lindsay does not like Lindsay's like, I can't deal with this.

1090
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:54,560
I can't deal with this.

1091
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:56,120
No, no.

1092
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:58,680
This vampire was killed when the viper room died.

1093
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:02,080
Also, I figured out somebody's going to be mad at me for saying this,

1094
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:04,240
but this is my take. Jeff Beck stinks.

1095
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:07,400
I don't think I'm just saying this because he's doing this.

1096
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:09,360
I don't know what he thinks.

1097
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:12,080
He's noodle. He's like they're all those guys.

1098
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:13,440
He's their boring friend.

1099
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:15,480
We have to be nice to because he's around.

1100
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:16,960
I am dead yet.

1101
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:19,040
So Jeff's here.

1102
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:22,040
Look, he's got poor self-esteem because he hasn't done anything.

1103
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:25,160
I think good like I only know him.

1104
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:30,600
I only know him from being 14 at used record shops looking for Beck albums.

1105
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:32,520
And I would always hit those first.

1106
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:34,720
And I'm like, who is this isn't right?

1107
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:38,960
This is like a there's like a dragster on the cover.

1108
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:43,240
There should be a little dog hopping over something.

1109
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:45,640
Yeah, it's a weird, furry mush.

1110
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:47,240
Whatever is on the cover.

1111
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:50,080
Yeah. So let's go back to more pleasant topics.

1112
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:51,800
Jasper T.

1113
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:53,920
Jowell's getting a time to shine.

1114
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:57,600
My favorite song of this whole this whole set,

1115
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:02,520
the dog days of summer, which is a well, I like this song.

1116
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:03,640
I like that. Yeah.

1117
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:05,280
OK, I'll give you a little bit of it.

1118
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:12,000
You can hear it's a lot of modern country, you know, it's a little mad.

1119
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:19,360
The summer days growing up at home.

1120
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,720
Some of the best times that I've ever known.

1121
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:25,360
Leading with sticks and skipping stones.

1122
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:27,800
What could be better?

1123
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:29,040
I have a list in your country.

1124
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:31,360
I mean, it will get to the course in a second.

1125
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:34,280
Jasper, I think honestly, just put like

1126
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:38,400
Alan Jackson's voice on that and like we're having a party.

1127
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:42,000
That's perfectly like no, no difference needs to be made.

1128
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,640
No lyrics need to change.

1129
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:46,520
He's not like talking about like sniffing his own butt or anything like

1130
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:49,320
there's not even really many dog specifics in it.

1131
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:53,760
As part of summer's having a weird dick.

1132
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:59,760
So I feel like a little lipstick and fleas and ticks.

1133
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:02,800
Like it's it's not far.

1134
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:06,720
Don't forget the back medicine on the eighth

1135
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:10,520
the flea medicine on the eighth every month.

1136
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:12,920
Put it in your phone between the show.

1137
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:14,040
I need my pill.

1138
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:17,480
So between the shoulder blades, don't do a glob.

1139
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:20,200
Do the whole neck.

1140
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:23,240
Wipe it off when it was slapped down my sides.

1141
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:25,560
It's going to be 90 dollars.

1142
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:30,600
So, yeah, no, there's not many even dog specifics,

1143
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:33,920
but this is also one where they tell you in the same way when you go

1144
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:37,680
see Ben Folds in college and he'd explain to you how to do the horn part on army.

1145
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:41,680
You know, you'd explain which one side is going to do this part.

1146
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:45,680
But you know, everyone knows, you've seen him.

1147
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:46,560
That's fun.

1148
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:48,840
So they explain to us there's going to be a na na na part,

1149
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:51,280
which they're going to call upon us to do.

1150
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:55,440
And I was very like, army, like when Ben Folds does the army.

1151
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:59,920
You when he's doing it so certain some of the older parents here know

1152
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:02,840
you, sir, with the gray hair.

1153
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:06,960
Yeah, you remember kids oddly late, you know, and only you know.

1154
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:09,400
The one whose better days are far behind him.

1155
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:10,440
You there.

1156
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:15,920
I know.

1157
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:19,320
But remember, but so so.

1158
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:24,600
Summer nights sleeping out underneath the stars so bright.

1159
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:28,520
I wish I may wish I might lick my own ass.

1160
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:33,040
So then I have a lunch and grab a cold.

1161
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:36,640
And we head on down to the home.

1162
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:40,160
Without fear and wonder,

1163
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:41,840
it was a dog day.

1164
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:45,080
It's a hanging out with all my friends.

1165
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:47,920
We'll get to the non-us.

1166
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:52,080
What is the magic spell we're under?

1167
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:53,960
It was a dog day.

1168
00:53:53,960 --> 00:54:00,400
It's a na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na.

1169
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:01,600
Jason, you would like this.

1170
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:03,480
Jason, you would love this.

1171
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:04,280
You would love this.

1172
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:05,880
I love a good na na na na.

1173
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:06,920
Yeah, you would love that.

1174
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:09,520
You know, I got the one thing we had to clap.

1175
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:12,040
And that's one of the things my boy knows how to do.

1176
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:15,320
Yeah, he gets a command that he can fulfill.

1177
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:17,080
So good. So that was good.

1178
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:19,680
Yeah, he he liked this one, I would say.

1179
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:22,000
So I don't want to jump too far ahead.

1180
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:25,520
But since you were there, did you give him like the first time

1181
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:27,880
experience of going to a bubble gum shrimp?

1182
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:31,160
I did not.

1183
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:34,720
That's a stressful location is what I recall.

1184
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:39,840
I think I gave him experience of passing by one and pointing and laughing at it.

1185
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:43,560
Yeah, but now baby's first shrimp did not.

1186
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:46,080
Baby's first overpriced popcorn.

1187
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:49,400
Now, Uncle Michael was drinking an ice cream smoothie

1188
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:51,600
that turned out to not have any alcohol.

1189
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:55,840
Yeah, this is a place where you and Uncle Mike can have the same beverage.

1190
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:58,240
And it's legal.

1191
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:01,120
But only they'll like it more than you.

1192
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:02,400
He'll yeah.

1193
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:06,080
You will only drink a few sips and he'll go, I'll take that off your hands.

1194
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:08,800
I'll finish that for you, my man.

1195
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:09,960
Can I finish that bottle?

1196
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:12,200
I got a headache after the concert, I'll be honest.

1197
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:14,280
Why? I don't know.

1198
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:15,640
Too much sun.

1199
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:17,800
Not enough of the water.

1200
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:20,280
I almost went to the bubble gum, but then I went to forget the name of the place

1201
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:23,040
and I had to tune him out and drink.

1202
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:24,880
Wow. It was nice.

1203
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:26,880
Which was the dog days.

1204
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:28,960
Dog days of summer.

1205
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:33,640
So then right after this, this is my favorite version of the plot coming up.

1206
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:34,040
Yeah.

1207
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:38,040
She's like, all right, so we've done this and that.

1208
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:41,760
And now, Chuckie, it's time for you to sing the song of the summer.

1209
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:45,760
And he's like, no, it's just really flat.

1210
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:47,200
No.

1211
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:48,280
And then you get further.

1212
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:50,800
Finally, he kind of opens up.

1213
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:52,480
He is withholding.

1214
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:54,960
And then they hit a therapy breakthrough.

1215
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:59,880
And what Chuckie thinks is that when the song of the summer has ended

1216
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:03,040
and this concert has ended, that that means that summer has ended.

1217
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:06,600
And Jesse needs to teach him that summer is only just beginning.

1218
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:10,840
And even though this moment has passed, we've got so much summer left

1219
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:17,520
and so many summers left, and that moves him enough to actually to do his fucking job.

1220
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:20,760
Open his trap and start singing the song.

1221
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:23,080
Contract said that he would be there to play.

1222
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:23,880
They did. Yes.

1223
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:26,640
And they did like they did like some happy birthday bullshit

1224
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:29,360
because they're Chuckie Cheese and they have to do that.

1225
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:31,640
It's OK. I mean, it's just like their happy version.

1226
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:33,720
I'll play a second of it, but it's not.

1227
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:36,480
There's nothing to talk about too much.

1228
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:42,080
And it's like the traditional birthday song.

1229
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:43,440
Don't have stage fright.

1230
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:45,280
And then they sort of are the oh, excuse me.

1231
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:47,160
Here's the here's the.

1232
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:49,160
All right.

1233
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:52,240
You win them right now, you freeze.

1234
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:55,080
Can you place this ripoff, Jason?

1235
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:57,200
We say happy birthday.

1236
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:59,360
Happy birthday. Happy birthday.

1237
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:00,200
Happy.

1238
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:03,320
You'll stop your feet.

1239
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:04,240
You're going to kick yourself.

1240
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:06,520
We're not in the ripoff part, I guess.

1241
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:09,200
But it's still the chord progression.

1242
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:10,560
I can go back here. Here. I'll start.

1243
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:11,400
I'll start.

1244
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:13,360
Birthday. Happy birthday.

1245
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:15,920
Birthday. Clap your hands.

1246
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:17,520
He'll stop your feet.

1247
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:18,760
It's time to dance.

1248
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:20,960
Turn to dance. Play your guitar.

1249
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:22,200
It's right there.

1250
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:23,360
I can't play.

1251
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:25,760
Happy birthday.

1252
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:28,040
Sunshine in my pocket.

1253
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:29,720
No, no, no.

1254
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:30,440
It's Timberlake.

1255
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:31,720
The Troll song.

1256
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:35,360
It's the Troll song, which is not the song from Secret Life of Pets,

1257
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:39,040
which is a different, very similar party song at the end of the ride.

1258
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:39,560
Yeah.

1259
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:40,320
Yeah. OK.

1260
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:41,880
Different, different generic.

1261
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:43,000
So, yeah, they do that.

1262
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:46,360
And then, yes, finally, the song of summer is here.

1263
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:49,960
And then at this point, I went, oh, shit, that's it.

1264
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:52,400
We're not getting the songs.

1265
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:52,960
Yeah.

1266
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:53,440
Yeah.

1267
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:55,920
Because obviously that has to be the climax.

1268
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:56,400
Yeah.

1269
00:57:56,400 --> 00:58:00,360
So, I mean, he doesn't know what the meaning of the word climax, I guess.

1270
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:02,560
Well, did you take pictures?

1271
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:03,200
Did you get some pictures?

1272
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:04,480
Yeah, I got video. I got pictures.

1273
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:08,160
I'll play the song this summer a little bit for, or unless we want to play that on the way out.

1274
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:08,880
Maybe.

1275
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:09,520
I don't know.

1276
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:11,520
Yeah, seems like appropriate exit music.

1277
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:12,920
But, yeah, we're...

1278
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:15,440
Exit music for a podcast episode.

1279
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:16,680
As you file out.

1280
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:17,440
Yeah.

1281
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:20,040
Yeah, so we're reviewing this.

1282
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:21,320
You're not going to be able to see it.

1283
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:21,960
It's done.

1284
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:23,320
It's over.

1285
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:23,840
Nope.

1286
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:26,160
But you can listen to it out, listen to it along with us.

1287
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:27,840
Maybe they'll do it again. Maybe they'll tour next summer.

1288
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:28,720
Maybe they'll add more dates.

1289
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:29,760
This is the second one, apparently.

1290
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:31,120
So they might keep this up.

1291
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:31,440
Yeah.

1292
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:37,840
When they see how amped we all got, except for the end when this one guy got real pouty and they couldn't tell why.

1293
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:38,160
Yeah.

1294
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:41,880
They didn't poll him to find out because they didn't do the songs that he liked.

1295
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:44,920
They didn't give me a free shirt or anything because they saw sad.

1296
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:47,160
They saw the tears hitting the pier.

1297
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:52,000
Now, another free thing, they are giving out a great autographed photo.

1298
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,280
Wow.

1299
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:54,680
Yeah, look at that.

1300
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:55,680
There's all of them.

1301
00:58:55,680 --> 00:59:02,800
Mr. Munch, Jasper T. Gels, all with distinctive kinds of writing and a cute starfish and a cute beach ball.

1302
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:04,880
Oh, the beach balls came out.

1303
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:06,000
Yeah, I forgot about that too.

1304
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:06,720
What a finale.

1305
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:09,000
Oh, how can you say it wasn't a climax?

1306
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:09,440
Yeah.

1307
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:10,280
They threw beach ball.

1308
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:16,840
The Chucky Street team, all 50 of them had beach balls and then they threw them out while they were doing the song.

1309
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:18,800
There wasn't really like a second round of it.

1310
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:21,120
Everybody just kind of pocketed those beach balls and left.

1311
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:23,160
Yeah, kids got to take the beach balls.

1312
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:23,960
Yeah.

1313
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:26,120
So that's good, but we didn't get one.

1314
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:27,840
So you weren't aggressive enough.

1315
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:28,320
Yeah.

1316
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:33,800
Yeah, because Mike spiked it into your child's head and it bounced into the ocean.

1317
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:36,920
I'm the best at being at this concert.

1318
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:39,320
I'm the best fan of Chucky.

1319
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:40,320
I'm the best fan of Chucky.

1320
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:41,680
Chucky, come out here.

1321
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:42,920
You're a pretender, kid.

1322
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:49,560
Well, we need to talk about, we need to talk about real quick where I made the, I had to figure out if I was going to wait in line with the children to meet Chucky.

1323
00:59:51,080 --> 00:59:54,800
You asked if we were, and I was like, he can't, this guy can't.

1324
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:55,800
Scott said no, they're not.

1325
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:57,080
You can barely keep him in the show.

1326
00:59:57,080 --> 00:59:59,800
He kept like, if a helicopter went by.

1327
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:00,560
Yeah.

1328
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:01,120
God.

1329
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:02,880
There's a lot of pointing at the roller coaster.

1330
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:10,240
Yeah, my favorite part of the Chucky Cheese concert was that there was a roller coaster nearby for my son to point to.

1331
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:11,240
Do you do any rides?

1332
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:13,080
What did you consider?

1333
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:14,080
Well, we'll talk later.

1334
01:00:14,080 --> 01:00:15,080
Oh, okay.

1335
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:16,080
About Santa Monica Pier.

1336
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:17,080
Oh.

1337
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:20,360
I didn't do anything else, but we wandered a bit.

1338
01:00:20,360 --> 01:00:28,480
It was a fun place to, I'm happy with that as like a, hey, and inspired, you know, living in LA, people in LA know, you live in Burbank.

1339
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:31,960
You start thinking Santa Monica is like another state.

1340
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:34,640
You think you need a passport to get over there.

1341
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:37,680
You forget that it could be a quick drive or a nice drive.

1342
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:40,480
And I had a very pleasant day with the boy.

1343
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:44,520
Yeah, it was, I was very happy I went.

1344
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:48,800
I will say the Taco Bell has gone from the Pier, which had bummed me out.

1345
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:51,880
But yes, it was a fun time.

1346
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:53,680
But where else are you going to find those?

1347
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:54,880
Yeah, it's hard to find.

1348
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:57,760
I wanted Pier Taco Bell, though, which is, it hits differently.

1349
01:00:57,760 --> 01:01:00,280
It's got extra salt in the air.

1350
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:08,120
But yeah, I mean, more, how often is it that we get to see suited characters dance around to pre-recorded tracks?

1351
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:12,800
Well, I think every day if you go to Chuck E. Cheese down the street.

1352
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:14,280
Well, and we don't have time for it.

1353
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:16,480
We'll discuss it in the next Chuck E. Cheese 3.

1354
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:17,920
And I don't know how soon that's coming.

1355
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:19,120
That's not even planned.

1356
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:24,440
But I was I was looking into the Chuck E. Cheese annual pass program, which exists.

1357
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:26,800
What? So we'll have to discuss this later.

1358
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:28,600
It's a summer. What a tease.

1359
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:33,200
Chuck E. Cheese summer annual pass program they've done the last two years.

1360
01:01:33,240 --> 01:01:39,640
So, you know, at Disneyland and Disney World have both shut down their annual pass programs for right now.

1361
01:01:39,640 --> 01:01:41,080
Like, they're not selling any new ones.

1362
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:42,600
We can still go.

1363
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:44,560
Well, but there's a lot of confusion.

1364
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:50,800
Well, I have some confusion, which is how do you sell an annual pass for something that is free?

1365
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:55,360
Well, I walk into Chuck E. Cheese and don't have zero dollars when I'm in there.

1366
01:01:55,360 --> 01:01:56,520
And maybe we can get to Chuck E.

1367
01:01:56,520 --> 01:02:00,800
3 soon, because if we were birdies are burning questions by the end of the dog days of summer.

1368
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:03,080
But maybe by the end of the dog days, we'll do another Chuck E.

1369
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:07,000
Cheese episode and get into this three tier Chuck E.

1370
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,200
Cheese annual pass program. Wow.

1371
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:10,840
So that's a tease. OK.

1372
01:02:10,840 --> 01:02:12,480
Well, one tier for each of us.

1373
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:14,640
We can compare and contrast. That's right.

1374
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:16,960
Yes, we should all do it.

1375
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:19,160
That's for sure. So, yeah.

1376
01:02:19,160 --> 01:02:23,360
So all that to say, you know, go get the album.

1377
01:02:23,360 --> 01:02:26,360
Enjoy your summer. We're kicking it off right now.

1378
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:30,280
One thing at the end in the relisting I realized is that it finished

1379
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:32,120
and then everybody got their curtain call before that.

1380
01:02:32,120 --> 01:02:35,160
Jesse said, all right, got a hand for everybody.

1381
01:02:35,480 --> 01:02:38,720
We're going to remember this for the rest of our lives.

1382
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:41,800
And that's true.

1383
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:45,000
Very grim outlook about the current state of the global warming.

1384
01:02:47,160 --> 01:02:49,240
That was a hint. That was a shopping.

1385
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:52,880
This is more about the rest of our lives and about the quality of the thing.

1386
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:54,560
It's a good point. Yeah.

1387
01:02:54,560 --> 01:02:56,800
Hey, it I don't know.

1388
01:02:56,800 --> 01:02:58,480
I enjoyed it.

1389
01:02:58,520 --> 01:03:02,320
I liked it. We got more of an episode out of it than I thought.

1390
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:05,520
Me having vocalized before that, I wasn't sure.

1391
01:03:05,600 --> 01:03:07,920
Multiple times, I was like, is there enough to talk about?

1392
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:10,160
Are we sure? I have no thoughts about this place.

1393
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:11,320
Yes. I said I have.

1394
01:03:11,320 --> 01:03:15,200
I don't think I had more than a minute to say to my wife,

1395
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:18,000
whose son was a participant at it.

1396
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:22,560
Look at us. We started a lot was said.

1397
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:26,040
I really like the exchange where it was a lot of there was a lot of back

1398
01:03:26,040 --> 01:03:28,600
and forth that was like, do we think this will be enough?

1399
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:31,240
And you said, I think this will be enough.

1400
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:34,960
And then I said, I think it's well, maybe it's a little funny

1401
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:37,040
that like you think it'll be plenty.

1402
01:03:37,040 --> 01:03:38,640
And I'm not so sure.

1403
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:40,640
Maybe that's the dynamic for the episode. Yeah.

1404
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:43,560
And you said, yes. Also, I didn't say plenty. Yeah.

1405
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:49,360
Well, I wanted to make I know this isn't like a three hour country bear start.

1406
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:51,320
Like, I know there's not that for this.

1407
01:03:51,320 --> 01:03:55,200
It was just such a it was a funny little like I wanted to be on record.

1408
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:57,240
So to be said in a trial.

1409
01:03:57,240 --> 01:03:59,520
Now, by the way, I didn't say plenty.

1410
01:03:59,720 --> 01:04:03,680
Yeah, I wanted to make sure it was clear that I never said, oh, my God.

1411
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:05,400
There's one show.

1412
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:08,120
There is so much to talk about when it comes to this show.

1413
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:10,800
Don't put in the word plenty in my mouth.

1414
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:14,120
Okay. I would say plenty to us all.

1415
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:16,920
It truly was another Chucky day.

1416
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:23,360
Well, and now to play us out of the song we'll remember for the rest of our lives.

1417
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:24,840
Yeah, let's do this here.

1418
01:04:24,840 --> 01:04:25,720
This lobby.

1419
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:28,920
OK, now, everybody.

1420
01:04:28,920 --> 01:04:30,960
There's a part a little later in the song.

1421
01:04:32,280 --> 01:04:34,920
I forgot you survived podcast, the riot and do the guys.

1422
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:36,800
Put three years up.

1423
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:39,080
Also, this is clearly juice by Lizzo.

1424
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:42,360
Oh, yes, that's where it is.

1425
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:44,800
I couldn't figure out what was a ripoff.

1426
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:47,320
All right. God, it's driving me crazy, actually.

1427
01:04:47,320 --> 01:04:48,200
That helps.

1428
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:51,680
Chucky feels like it's over.

1429
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:53,560
We've been together.

1430
01:04:53,560 --> 01:04:55,360
So come on out.

1431
01:04:55,360 --> 01:04:57,800
This is kind of a ripoff of both.

1432
01:04:57,800 --> 01:04:59,840
Yes, there is.

1433
01:04:59,840 --> 01:05:04,760
And then I'm going to go outside and play.

1434
01:05:05,080 --> 01:05:10,080
And it's so good to feel the sun is shining down,

1435
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:18,000
down on the ground and it's so good to see all my friends are coming around.

1436
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:20,960
I'm so excited now.

1437
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:24,760
So turn up the radio and play my favorite song.

1438
01:05:25,120 --> 01:05:27,040
I don't want any other.

1439
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:28,680
It's in my song.

1440
01:05:28,680 --> 01:05:31,080
So it's a stereo.

1441
01:05:31,080 --> 01:05:33,120
We can sing along.

1442
01:05:33,120 --> 01:05:34,960
I don't want any other.

1443
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:37,280
So sing the song of summer with me.

1444
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:42,280
Wow.

1445
01:05:43,160 --> 01:05:45,360
Sing the song of summer with me.
