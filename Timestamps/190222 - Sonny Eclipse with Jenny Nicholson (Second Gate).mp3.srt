1
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:05,360
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,176 --> 00:00:24,176
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to podcast the ride, the second gate.

3
00:00:24,436 --> 00:00:30,416
We're here with our guest Jenny Nicholson to talk about one of the most important topics

4
00:00:30,416 --> 00:00:37,256
I think we've ever tackled in our theme park, you know, podcast history, sunny eclipse.

5
00:00:37,736 --> 00:00:38,896
This one's been looming.

6
00:00:39,336 --> 00:00:40,896
It's a big one.

7
00:00:41,876 --> 00:00:45,616
Jenny, I think the first time you're here, I just thought I'd watched the first video

8
00:00:45,616 --> 00:00:48,076
of yours I'd watched like, oh, she knows about sunny eclipse.

9
00:00:48,076 --> 00:00:51,056
Right, the top 10 lame things to do at Disney World.

10
00:00:51,276 --> 00:00:51,916
Which was that number one?

11
00:00:51,936 --> 00:00:52,696
He was number one.

12
00:00:52,716 --> 00:00:54,036
He was number one.

13
00:00:54,236 --> 00:00:54,276
Yeah.

14
00:00:54,276 --> 00:00:54,576
Wow.

15
00:00:55,016 --> 00:00:55,736
He took gold.

16
00:00:56,096 --> 00:00:56,576
Geez.

17
00:00:58,336 --> 00:01:02,056
If we're talking, well, what's some rationale for that?

18
00:01:02,076 --> 00:01:03,556
What was some of your reasoning?

19
00:01:03,616 --> 00:01:08,736
I mean, my favorite thing about Magic Kingdom's Tomorrowland is the ambiance and I think he

20
00:01:08,736 --> 00:01:10,236
represents that really well.

21
00:01:10,496 --> 00:01:13,956
He's a constantly performing animatronic act.

22
00:01:13,956 --> 00:01:17,776
I love animatronics and I love being near food.

23
00:01:18,476 --> 00:01:20,116
So he delivers on all fronts.

24
00:01:20,376 --> 00:01:23,076
I actually, there's very little I can eat at Cosmic Race.

25
00:01:23,396 --> 00:01:23,676
Yeah.

26
00:01:23,696 --> 00:01:28,896
They have kind of a lame falafel burger and even the toppings bar can't save that one,

27
00:01:28,936 --> 00:01:29,676
to be honest.

28
00:01:29,956 --> 00:01:31,256
They were robust toppings bars.

29
00:01:31,956 --> 00:01:35,976
So yeah, so in case you're listening to the second gate and for some weird reason you

30
00:01:35,976 --> 00:01:39,736
don't know who sunny eclipse is, I don't know if it could, I am curious.

31
00:01:39,736 --> 00:01:40,336
There's no way.

32
00:01:40,336 --> 00:01:44,576
If you're a listener and you're subscribing to our Patreon, do you not know Sunny Eclipse?

33
00:01:44,676 --> 00:01:46,756
If that is the case, be honest and tell us.

34
00:01:46,776 --> 00:01:48,576
I'm just curious what the percentage is.

35
00:01:48,776 --> 00:01:49,936
You're shaking your head no.

36
00:01:50,776 --> 00:01:51,776
He's like the queen of Disney World.

37
00:01:51,836 --> 00:01:54,616
Queen the performing artist, not Queen Elizabeth.

38
00:01:55,396 --> 00:01:56,976
Wait, so what do you mean by that?

39
00:01:57,516 --> 00:01:58,796
Like everyone knows him.

40
00:01:58,796 --> 00:01:59,316
Oh sure.

41
00:01:59,596 --> 00:01:59,876
Oh yeah.

42
00:02:00,096 --> 00:02:00,476
Everyone.

43
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:02,876
The band from that great movie that just came out.

44
00:02:03,836 --> 00:02:06,276
By this point, potentially Oscar winning film.

45
00:02:06,756 --> 00:02:12,476
Yeah, in the film about Sunny Eclipse, contractually the space angels need an equal amount of screen

46
00:02:12,476 --> 00:02:13,016
time.

47
00:02:13,016 --> 00:02:14,956
So it really messes up the editing.

48
00:02:15,356 --> 00:02:18,816
Space angels' husbands are jammed in their weird side stories.

49
00:02:19,056 --> 00:02:19,456
And they don't care.

50
00:02:20,036 --> 00:02:23,576
Mike Myers will be playing the same character though, oddly enough.

51
00:02:24,476 --> 00:02:26,016
A little finger is there also.

52
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:28,516
An alien who sings about burgers.

53
00:02:28,956 --> 00:02:30,016
It'll never work.

54
00:02:30,996 --> 00:02:33,336
Teenagers will never bang their heads to the.

55
00:02:33,616 --> 00:02:38,356
And the space, the angels also, they're not into partying like Sunny is.

56
00:02:38,576 --> 00:02:40,656
I just want to make sure that like they're very responsible.

57
00:02:40,796 --> 00:02:41,596
They're family men.

58
00:02:41,816 --> 00:02:43,296
That's what they buy heads over.

59
00:02:43,356 --> 00:02:45,096
It creates a lot of dramatic tension.

60
00:02:45,896 --> 00:02:49,756
Sunny went wild, but not the space angels.

61
00:02:50,756 --> 00:02:52,236
So Sunny Eclipse is?

62
00:02:52,236 --> 00:02:54,916
He is an alien lounge singer.

63
00:02:55,336 --> 00:02:56,656
From the planet Zork.

64
00:02:56,656 --> 00:02:58,036
From the planet Zork.

65
00:02:58,816 --> 00:02:59,636
The city of U-Nork.

66
00:03:00,676 --> 00:03:01,496
U-Nork City.

67
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:07,696
I've been working for a guy, Dennis McNicholas, to be working for a Sunny Eclipse fan.

68
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:11,256
I told him we're doing a Sunny Eclipse episode.

69
00:03:11,956 --> 00:03:14,076
And I just learned that he's from U-Nork City.

70
00:03:14,156 --> 00:03:16,456
And he said, oh yes, on planet Zork, I believe.

71
00:03:17,436 --> 00:03:19,396
Man, oh man, what a good man.

72
00:03:20,096 --> 00:03:24,216
And he's several times now sent me selfies with Sunny.

73
00:03:25,116 --> 00:03:25,956
Which I encourage.

74
00:03:26,236 --> 00:03:28,676
We're getting this already a little bit.

75
00:03:28,676 --> 00:03:31,336
People do, I think, send us photos with Sunny.

76
00:03:31,516 --> 00:03:32,536
Which keep them coming.

77
00:03:32,996 --> 00:03:36,616
I'm really happy people have been sending pictures of my favorite bear, Truffles the

78
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:38,596
Bear from the Rocky Man Chocolate Factory.

79
00:03:38,716 --> 00:03:40,016
But if you're with Truffles, I want to see it.

80
00:03:40,016 --> 00:03:41,276
And if you're with Sunny, I want to see it.

81
00:03:41,276 --> 00:03:45,056
People will send me selfies with Sunny as well, ever since I mentioned him in the video.

82
00:03:45,116 --> 00:03:46,676
They'll say, I'm working through your list.

83
00:03:46,696 --> 00:03:48,036
And they'll send a pic of Sunny.

84
00:03:48,496 --> 00:03:50,656
I want to say how much I appreciate this.

85
00:03:51,376 --> 00:03:54,356
Whenever you first saw Sunny, probably as a little kid.

86
00:03:54,356 --> 00:03:54,776
No.

87
00:03:55,076 --> 00:03:56,136
In some way.

88
00:03:57,216 --> 00:04:00,216
No, my first visit to Florida, I was an adult.

89
00:04:00,376 --> 00:04:01,336
Oh, right.

90
00:04:01,596 --> 00:04:01,796
Never mind.

91
00:04:03,176 --> 00:04:05,056
I'm making an assumption there.

92
00:04:05,296 --> 00:04:06,356
Oh, you weren't even, oh really?

93
00:04:06,356 --> 00:04:07,096
You didn't go until.

94
00:04:07,136 --> 00:04:08,436
Oh, then that's an interesting perspective.

95
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:10,936
Yeah, there was a lot of retro stuff I never got to see.

96
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:14,656
My first visit was mere months after they closed Maelstrom.

97
00:04:15,176 --> 00:04:17,896
We had in fact booked our Fast Passes for Maelstrom.

98
00:04:18,356 --> 00:04:20,516
And they were canceled because Frozen was announced.

99
00:04:20,516 --> 00:04:21,576
What the hell?

100
00:04:21,576 --> 00:04:25,816
They didn't even give us a good for anything Fast Pass in apology.

101
00:04:26,416 --> 00:04:29,236
They didn't promise you front row VIP seats.

102
00:04:29,236 --> 00:04:31,696
No, they just took away our Fast Passes for Maelstrom.

103
00:04:31,736 --> 00:04:33,356
And I've never forgiven them for that.

104
00:04:33,476 --> 00:04:35,136
Geez, that's harsh.

105
00:04:35,136 --> 00:04:35,556
It's hellish.

106
00:04:35,756 --> 00:04:36,216
It's harsh.

107
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:36,876
They should pay.

108
00:04:36,996 --> 00:04:39,516
So yeah, I don't remember what year that was, but I was an adult.

109
00:04:40,016 --> 00:04:41,476
That's like five years ago.

110
00:04:41,676 --> 00:04:42,476
I was grown.

111
00:04:42,736 --> 00:04:43,436
Wow.

112
00:04:43,456 --> 00:04:45,096
But you knew about it.

113
00:04:45,096 --> 00:04:46,136
You made a point of go.

114
00:04:46,136 --> 00:04:46,856
Or was it a surprise to you?

115
00:04:46,856 --> 00:04:47,996
I had heard about it.

116
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:48,216
Okay.

117
00:04:48,276 --> 00:04:49,756
And I needed to find it.

118
00:04:49,776 --> 00:04:52,616
So yeah, it was like really high on my list to find.

119
00:04:53,036 --> 00:04:53,396
He's not.

120
00:04:53,676 --> 00:04:55,376
He hasn't been there that long.

121
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:58,316
It feels like something he's been there since like 95, right?

122
00:04:58,316 --> 00:04:58,436
Okay.

123
00:04:58,576 --> 00:04:59,076
That's pretty long.

124
00:04:59,616 --> 00:05:00,396
94, I think was 94.

125
00:05:00,396 --> 00:05:00,996
That's a long time.

126
00:05:01,436 --> 00:05:02,496
Tomorrowland shift.

127
00:05:02,696 --> 00:05:04,456
To me, that's like when the world started.

128
00:05:04,896 --> 00:05:09,896
If like, probably listeners know all this as well, but like they, I think it's safe

129
00:05:09,896 --> 00:05:15,916
to say Tomorrowland 94 in Florida is the most successful of the Tomorrowland shifts and

130
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:17,136
remakes.

131
00:05:17,156 --> 00:05:21,036
Partially because it has a lot of personality to it.

132
00:05:21,036 --> 00:05:27,056
They imagine this really specific kind of thirties meets future jets and Z.

133
00:05:27,336 --> 00:05:33,676
It's like, it's this bustling future metropolis that's kind of self aware that it's a sci-fi

134
00:05:33,676 --> 00:05:34,796
parody world.

135
00:05:34,976 --> 00:05:38,076
And so it's really, it's so much fun.

136
00:05:38,196 --> 00:05:41,876
And those little details, I think it's like, okay, like I don't think we care about this

137
00:05:41,876 --> 00:05:46,336
so much anymore, but how Tomorrowland, I'm sorry, Toontown has all that you can pick

138
00:05:46,336 --> 00:05:48,916
up the phone or you can open the lid and it talks to you.

139
00:05:48,956 --> 00:05:50,636
I would love even more of that.

140
00:05:50,656 --> 00:05:51,076
Yeah.

141
00:05:51,856 --> 00:05:53,216
And Tomorrowland does have that stuff.

142
00:05:53,336 --> 00:05:53,896
They have a little bit.

143
00:05:54,216 --> 00:05:54,316
You can pick up phones.

144
00:05:54,616 --> 00:05:55,336
They don't anymore.

145
00:05:55,736 --> 00:05:56,436
Oh, do they not anymore?

146
00:05:56,456 --> 00:06:00,476
They just permanently removed the phone and the robot and apparently it was confirmed

147
00:06:00,476 --> 00:06:01,436
that they're not returning.

148
00:06:01,916 --> 00:06:03,196
Oh, that's so good.

149
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:03,636
I know.

150
00:06:04,056 --> 00:06:05,896
Well, that makes me worry about Sunny.

151
00:06:06,436 --> 00:06:08,196
Can Sunny possibly stay there?

152
00:06:08,336 --> 00:06:09,436
It makes me worried about Sunny.

153
00:06:09,476 --> 00:06:13,436
They're going to put a screen and have like, you know, Vanessa Hudgens dance party.

154
00:06:13,696 --> 00:06:15,856
I'm too old to know who's on Disney Channel anymore.

155
00:06:15,936 --> 00:06:17,276
Probably Meghan Trainor.

156
00:06:17,276 --> 00:06:18,816
She's just in everything now.

157
00:06:18,816 --> 00:06:19,916
No, no, no.

158
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:21,016
They did refer.

159
00:06:21,016 --> 00:06:23,116
They just refer and he's there.

160
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:23,976
And he's still there.

161
00:06:25,216 --> 00:06:28,656
I mean, the next time he breaks, will they decide he's not worth fixing?

162
00:06:28,896 --> 00:06:30,616
That's my ongoing fear about Sunny.

163
00:06:30,616 --> 00:06:32,796
It's like Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

164
00:06:33,356 --> 00:06:33,896
Sure.

165
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:34,756
Stay healthy.

166
00:06:35,096 --> 00:06:35,796
We need you.

167
00:06:37,816 --> 00:06:38,936
It's exactly the same thing.

168
00:06:38,936 --> 00:06:40,596
It's pretty much just like Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

169
00:06:40,596 --> 00:06:41,216
It's important to me.

170
00:06:41,336 --> 00:06:42,076
One to one.

171
00:06:42,676 --> 00:06:42,836
Yeah.

172
00:06:44,336 --> 00:06:47,396
It is lightly attended every time I've ever been.

173
00:06:47,656 --> 00:06:52,236
And I'm always the only one in there that looks like I'm paying attention.

174
00:06:52,236 --> 00:06:54,736
Yeah, I'm worried we're going to see on like an exit survey.

175
00:06:54,936 --> 00:06:59,236
Like one of the questions, did you go to Cosmic Ray's to see Sunny Eclipse?

176
00:06:59,356 --> 00:07:02,076
And if enough people say no, they'll stop refurbing him.

177
00:07:02,136 --> 00:07:03,836
Maybe they'll make him a statue.

178
00:07:04,196 --> 00:07:05,236
Oh, yeah.

179
00:07:05,376 --> 00:07:06,196
I see that.

180
00:07:06,536 --> 00:07:08,456
Or make it so only the mouth moves.

181
00:07:08,476 --> 00:07:12,136
The problem, we're getting, I guess, ahead of ourselves worrying about this before we

182
00:07:12,136 --> 00:07:13,136
will celebrate him after this.

183
00:07:13,316 --> 00:07:19,176
But yeah, I think there's a there's a thing with robots in front of a spot that you can

184
00:07:19,176 --> 00:07:19,316
eat.

185
00:07:19,376 --> 00:07:23,696
We have not done a full tropical hideaway episode, but we just, Lindsay and I just won.

186
00:07:24,296 --> 00:07:27,476
And Rosita does like little jokes every minute.

187
00:07:27,496 --> 00:07:30,816
And it's odd because she's a little too loud and it's a little too loud.

188
00:07:30,896 --> 00:07:33,856
But she also like it seems odd that she's just gotten all of a sudden.

189
00:07:33,916 --> 00:07:37,536
It's like blurts out a joke and then goes back to being silent.

190
00:07:37,696 --> 00:07:40,736
Like she's crazy in front of an audience either.

191
00:07:41,076 --> 00:07:41,476
Yeah.

192
00:07:41,476 --> 00:07:45,396
And they don't want I think I think the thing with that is they probably were like, we can't

193
00:07:45,396 --> 00:07:47,336
do a full show because we have a limited amount of space.

194
00:07:47,336 --> 00:07:48,476
And they don't want people to linger.

195
00:07:48,476 --> 00:07:49,576
And we don't want people to linger.

196
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:52,856
Whereas Sunny does a full 30 minute show.

197
00:07:52,956 --> 00:07:54,156
No one lingers.

198
00:07:54,496 --> 00:07:55,116
And it loops.

199
00:07:55,856 --> 00:07:59,856
I think there's probably a way to maybe make the show more like turtle talk or something

200
00:07:59,856 --> 00:08:01,456
where like there's some interactivity.

201
00:08:01,516 --> 00:08:04,556
But then I think they have the problem of like, then everybody comes in.

202
00:08:04,556 --> 00:08:06,016
Yeah, they want to turn over those tables.

203
00:08:06,076 --> 00:08:08,596
They don't want people in huge waves coming in for the show.

204
00:08:08,776 --> 00:08:08,916
Yeah.

205
00:08:08,916 --> 00:08:13,236
And I also have some personal theories that we can maybe get to later about why the show

206
00:08:13,236 --> 00:08:15,356
is a little less attendant than it should be.

207
00:08:15,356 --> 00:08:16,556
Interesting.

208
00:08:17,256 --> 00:08:18,256
Nothing that smart.

209
00:08:18,396 --> 00:08:20,776
We're in a related territory also.

210
00:08:20,876 --> 00:08:23,856
Obviously robots performing in front of places where you can eat.

211
00:08:24,076 --> 00:08:26,496
We're in a territory close to Chuck E. Cheese's.

212
00:08:27,076 --> 00:08:30,056
And we'll do.

213
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:33,716
We're going to spend probably a year of episodes on Chuck E. Cheese.

214
00:08:34,156 --> 00:08:35,716
Do you guys have a local Chuck E. Cheese?

215
00:08:35,716 --> 00:08:36,856
And does it have robots?

216
00:08:37,136 --> 00:08:37,776
It's right over here.

217
00:08:37,896 --> 00:08:38,896
That's a good question.

218
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:39,956
I walked by there.

219
00:08:40,076 --> 00:08:46,376
I went to Subway and I walked by there and I was alone and I was looking peering through

220
00:08:46,376 --> 00:08:49,136
the window, which is weird enough when it's an adult man looking at Chuck E.

221
00:08:49,136 --> 00:08:49,916
Yeah, when you're an adult man you can't do that.

222
00:08:51,116 --> 00:08:52,936
But I was just, I mean, I was casually peering.

223
00:08:53,036 --> 00:08:56,556
I didn't do the full cup hands face against the glass.

224
00:08:56,556 --> 00:08:57,476
You did have a cold.

225
00:08:57,576 --> 00:09:00,696
So that was the week you were breathing exclusively through your mouth.

226
00:09:02,076 --> 00:09:02,876
There's a big face.

227
00:09:03,056 --> 00:09:03,796
And it's been cold.

228
00:09:03,836 --> 00:09:04,856
So you're wearing a trench coat.

229
00:09:05,076 --> 00:09:09,196
Someone on Twitter should just tell us like in SoCal, I would love to sign one that still

230
00:09:09,196 --> 00:09:10,916
has the four animatronics set up.

231
00:09:11,136 --> 00:09:11,636
If any still exist.

232
00:09:11,716 --> 00:09:12,676
Should I yelp it?

233
00:09:12,956 --> 00:09:13,116
Should I yelp it?

234
00:09:13,116 --> 00:09:14,396
I don't know if you can take it.

235
00:09:14,556 --> 00:09:15,816
I think it's going to take you a minute to decipher it.

236
00:09:15,816 --> 00:09:18,396
I've been to the one in Fullerton, like my friends and I straight up went inside, played

237
00:09:18,396 --> 00:09:19,656
games and bought a pizza.

238
00:09:19,656 --> 00:09:26,236
And they had the modern one Chuck set up where it's like a very modern looking Chuck E. He's

239
00:09:26,236 --> 00:09:27,996
like Slim and Sonic the Hedgehog S.

240
00:09:27,996 --> 00:09:28,636
And it sucks.

241
00:09:29,016 --> 00:09:29,716
And yeah, he sucks.

242
00:09:29,716 --> 00:09:30,716
And there's just one of him.

243
00:09:31,316 --> 00:09:33,396
This is Studio C is what you're describing.

244
00:09:33,396 --> 00:09:34,216
I think that is what it's called.

245
00:09:34,216 --> 00:09:36,336
I think that is what it's called.

246
00:09:36,456 --> 00:09:40,156
And part of that is that there's a green screen where your kid could pretend they're on TV.

247
00:09:40,256 --> 00:09:41,576
It's before the green screen.

248
00:09:41,596 --> 00:09:45,516
It's just one Chuck E. The new one is I think just going to be some kind of tube with an

249
00:09:45,516 --> 00:09:47,276
image of Chuck E displayed on it.

250
00:09:47,476 --> 00:09:47,656
Like a hologram.

251
00:09:47,656 --> 00:09:49,776
So there won't even be the one robot?

252
00:09:50,216 --> 00:09:51,316
There's no robots.

253
00:09:51,576 --> 00:09:52,496
They're phasing them all out.

254
00:09:52,516 --> 00:09:53,696
No, no, no.

255
00:09:53,896 --> 00:09:59,176
I want to know though, is there any of them that have just the original outfit characters?

256
00:09:59,176 --> 00:10:03,376
Because I think most of them at a certain point were converted to like skateboard Chuck

257
00:10:03,376 --> 00:10:03,576
E.

258
00:10:03,616 --> 00:10:04,036
Right.

259
00:10:04,336 --> 00:10:07,196
Which like he has his like blue and green shirt and baseball hat on.

260
00:10:07,196 --> 00:10:10,196
Entertainers should wear tuxedos at all times.

261
00:10:10,896 --> 00:10:13,596
I think I do remember the tux and tails Chuck E.

262
00:10:13,816 --> 00:10:14,116
Sure.

263
00:10:14,596 --> 00:10:20,436
He would be in a tux once in a while, but the one I grew up with was just the classic

264
00:10:20,436 --> 00:10:22,876
red and yellow and the bowler hat.

265
00:10:23,136 --> 00:10:23,876
Right, I think so.

266
00:10:23,876 --> 00:10:25,776
He was a huckster rat.

267
00:10:25,896 --> 00:10:27,136
He was a jerk.

268
00:10:27,696 --> 00:10:28,336
Oh, you're right.

269
00:10:28,596 --> 00:10:29,016
The bowler hat.

270
00:10:29,016 --> 00:10:30,596
He was like a carnival barker.

271
00:10:30,956 --> 00:10:33,916
Yeah, he was like a shady character and that's what was great about him.

272
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:35,656
And then they like poochy him up.

273
00:10:35,656 --> 00:10:38,216
And it had like a grubby city vibe kind of.

274
00:10:38,376 --> 00:10:41,716
They had like a cityscape like it was a late night show behind the set.

275
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:46,516
Yes, and they would do those loops of like the fake Chuck E. shows and stuff.

276
00:10:46,536 --> 00:10:49,656
Yeah, it would cut the TV and then you'd see like puppets or something.

277
00:10:49,956 --> 00:10:50,736
Yeah, so.

278
00:10:50,736 --> 00:10:51,836
So yeah, I'd love to find one with that.

279
00:10:51,836 --> 00:10:52,516
That's what I want.

280
00:10:52,656 --> 00:10:56,196
I feel like in the Midwest there are more that haven't been touched so much.

281
00:10:56,256 --> 00:10:58,096
I think in California they update them more.

282
00:10:58,096 --> 00:10:58,936
I think so.

283
00:10:59,316 --> 00:11:08,256
My hometown one, which was in West Hills, California at the Fallbrook Center, was hung

284
00:11:08,256 --> 00:11:09,436
in there for a while.

285
00:11:09,656 --> 00:11:14,616
I actually don't know if it shifted to Studio C and I pray that it hasn't.

286
00:11:14,836 --> 00:11:17,016
Yeah, but like it made it a while.

287
00:11:17,016 --> 00:11:21,376
So I did have a place where I could go see Helen and Jasper and.

288
00:11:21,876 --> 00:11:22,796
Yeah, Helen Henney.

289
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:23,836
Helen Henney.

290
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:25,716
Jasper T. Jowell's.

291
00:11:25,776 --> 00:11:27,496
They're still merchandising Helen Henney.

292
00:11:27,496 --> 00:11:31,816
I know this because I subscribed to a Chuck E. Cheese fan YouTuber and as soon as they

293
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:35,396
made it, he had to go buy it and do a plush review of the two sizes that came in.

294
00:11:35,396 --> 00:11:36,196
Oh, wow.

295
00:11:36,856 --> 00:11:38,216
So a new Helen Henney plush.

296
00:11:38,636 --> 00:11:41,496
Is that do they sell some stuff at Chuck E. Cheese or is it just the trick?

297
00:11:41,536 --> 00:11:43,296
Because my family found this out at some point.

298
00:11:43,296 --> 00:11:46,996
It's like, OK, that's 200 tickets.

299
00:11:47,056 --> 00:11:48,056
It's exactly that.

300
00:11:48,056 --> 00:11:49,816
You can save up tickets or buy it.

301
00:11:49,816 --> 00:11:53,456
And I think that's not true of all their stuff, but that is true of Helen Henney and the Chuck

302
00:11:53,456 --> 00:11:53,576
E.

303
00:11:53,836 --> 00:12:00,696
If you follow me on Twitter, a couple like a month or two ago, I Uber E delivered a Chuck

304
00:12:00,696 --> 00:12:01,496
E. Cheese pizza.

305
00:12:01,536 --> 00:12:02,516
I would do that.

306
00:12:02,516 --> 00:12:03,496
I would so do that.

307
00:12:03,596 --> 00:12:07,976
And it's because I got a credit card that comes with $15 of Uber credit a month.

308
00:12:07,976 --> 00:12:11,296
And I was like, well, I have to use it even though I haven't been using Uber.

309
00:12:11,536 --> 00:12:13,436
So then I was like, I wonder if I could use it at Uber Eats.

310
00:12:13,436 --> 00:12:14,216
And you can.

311
00:12:14,556 --> 00:12:17,336
And then I was like looking through the restaurants and I was like Chuck E.

312
00:12:17,356 --> 00:12:18,436
Cheese. And I was like, that's weird.

313
00:12:18,556 --> 00:12:19,296
That's amazing.

314
00:12:19,296 --> 00:12:21,096
Yeah, because no one it's like Rainforest Cafe.

315
00:12:21,216 --> 00:12:22,356
You don't think, oh, the food.

316
00:12:22,376 --> 00:12:23,036
Why would you do that?

317
00:12:23,536 --> 00:12:24,496
I clicked on it.

318
00:12:24,496 --> 00:12:24,956
Terrible.

319
00:12:25,076 --> 00:12:26,596
Yeah. And I was like, OK, get a pizza.

320
00:12:26,656 --> 00:12:29,156
And then I noticed it said free item.

321
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:32,096
Choose free goodie bag or free Chuck E.

322
00:12:32,156 --> 00:12:32,576
Plush.

323
00:12:32,676 --> 00:12:36,476
So you could get a free goodie bag or Chuck E.

324
00:12:36,536 --> 00:12:37,656
Plush. Which one did you get?

325
00:12:37,816 --> 00:12:38,436
The Chuck E. Plush.

326
00:12:38,636 --> 00:12:40,136
But it's skateboard Chuck E.

327
00:12:40,136 --> 00:12:41,156
And it's not.

328
00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:42,236
I was thrilled to get it.

329
00:12:42,256 --> 00:12:43,936
I mean, it's not Helen Henney.

330
00:12:44,156 --> 00:12:45,496
Yeah. Where is it?

331
00:12:46,016 --> 00:12:46,816
Upstairs somewhere.

332
00:12:47,856 --> 00:12:49,136
It's not. I mean, later.

333
00:12:49,136 --> 00:12:50,396
Go get Chuck E.

334
00:12:50,396 --> 00:12:52,196
I have it all. I'll show it to you on Twitter too.

335
00:12:52,196 --> 00:12:53,456
It's not a visual podcast.

336
00:12:54,056 --> 00:12:54,716
It's on Twitter.

337
00:12:54,936 --> 00:12:57,296
If it was a Munch or so, I'm a big Munch fan as well.

338
00:12:57,316 --> 00:12:58,476
Me too. I loved Munch.

339
00:12:58,616 --> 00:12:59,876
I loved it. He was so.

340
00:12:59,956 --> 00:13:00,996
I mean, he was just the Grimace.

341
00:13:01,056 --> 00:13:01,996
They just stole Grimace.

342
00:13:01,996 --> 00:13:02,656
Oh, yeah. No.

343
00:13:02,676 --> 00:13:04,496
But Grimace had been my favorite McDonald's character.

344
00:13:04,496 --> 00:13:04,896
Right.

345
00:13:05,256 --> 00:13:09,316
Well, Slash, he's also the he took the position of the gorilla.

346
00:13:09,796 --> 00:13:11,516
Oh, the gorilla. The keyboard playing gorilla.

347
00:13:11,596 --> 00:13:11,936
Yes.

348
00:13:12,216 --> 00:13:16,616
Did you know Creative Engineering is selling plush characters of their classic characters?

349
00:13:16,776 --> 00:13:17,236
No.

350
00:13:17,256 --> 00:13:20,516
But they're so limited run that I think they're like two hundred dollars.

351
00:13:20,676 --> 00:13:21,076
Geez.

352
00:13:21,076 --> 00:13:22,196
Oh, you're talking about the rocket fire?

353
00:13:22,396 --> 00:13:22,716
Yeah.

354
00:13:22,996 --> 00:13:23,916
Oh, you.

355
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:27,076
Lindsay pre-ordered for me the Billy Bob bear.

356
00:13:27,076 --> 00:13:30,416
See, that's next level because, yeah, they are not cheap.

357
00:13:30,756 --> 00:13:30,856
They are.

358
00:13:30,856 --> 00:13:32,116
It's one hundred and fifty dollars.

359
00:13:32,136 --> 00:13:33,716
Yeah, because I saw they were making that.

360
00:13:33,716 --> 00:13:35,416
And I was like, I would buy those.

361
00:13:35,436 --> 00:13:38,116
And then I looked at the prices and I was like, oh, I would not buy those.

362
00:13:38,536 --> 00:13:40,476
Oh, you can get it for one hundred and twenty five.

363
00:13:40,576 --> 00:13:42,736
But the one hundred and fifty one comes with a head that comes off.

364
00:13:42,916 --> 00:13:44,696
That's the you can see inside the head.

365
00:13:44,696 --> 00:13:45,236
Right.

366
00:13:45,916 --> 00:13:47,476
So it's like skin removed.

367
00:13:48,436 --> 00:13:50,056
That's pretty, pretty next level.

368
00:13:50,056 --> 00:13:51,816
So, yeah, that was my Christmas gift.

369
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:53,016
It was the preorder for that.

370
00:13:53,016 --> 00:13:55,536
When does it ship quarter to?

371
00:13:55,536 --> 00:13:56,496
Oh, yeah.

372
00:13:56,496 --> 00:13:57,576
Is you get a wild.

373
00:13:57,996 --> 00:14:01,656
I think he's like low key kickstarting it and trying to sell as many as he can

374
00:14:01,656 --> 00:14:02,996
before he bulls orders them.

375
00:14:02,996 --> 00:14:03,836
What's this guy?

376
00:14:03,956 --> 00:14:06,096
This is this guy who used to work for Mondo.

377
00:14:06,116 --> 00:14:08,776
Really? I thought it was the guy that actually did the robots

378
00:14:08,776 --> 00:14:09,856
that was making this happen.

379
00:14:10,136 --> 00:14:14,416
Unless there's we could be talking about two separate lines of rocker.

380
00:14:14,416 --> 00:14:16,496
The face was more like a doll.

381
00:14:16,896 --> 00:14:18,776
And the one that I've seen is like a plush.

382
00:14:18,916 --> 00:14:19,416
Yeah, this was.

383
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:22,436
I think the plush are the ones that are by the guy who's still doing the robots.

384
00:14:22,436 --> 00:14:26,276
I bet that's right, because, yeah, this only he's only had the Billy Bob out

385
00:14:26,276 --> 00:14:27,896
right now as for preorder.

386
00:14:28,136 --> 00:14:29,716
He's I think he wants to do all of them.

387
00:14:29,716 --> 00:14:30,856
Yeah. Eventually.

388
00:14:30,956 --> 00:14:32,356
But that's the one I have not.

389
00:14:32,576 --> 00:14:33,936
I don't even think I've seen the plush.

390
00:14:34,096 --> 00:14:35,156
Now that you say it.

391
00:14:35,196 --> 00:14:38,116
Yeah, I don't know how recent they are, but I went to his website recently

392
00:14:38,116 --> 00:14:40,876
because I wanted to see about tours and.

393
00:14:40,996 --> 00:14:42,356
Oh, right. I want to do it.

394
00:14:42,356 --> 00:14:43,676
It's a whole thing, though.

395
00:14:43,796 --> 00:14:45,396
I think he's like I think it's.

396
00:14:45,536 --> 00:14:48,716
Yeah, it's a it's a full day endeavor and it's it doesn't seem organized.

397
00:14:48,716 --> 00:14:52,336
It seems like you go to his workshop and he improvs showing you around.

398
00:14:52,476 --> 00:14:54,436
Yeah. Oh, man, was that today?

399
00:14:54,756 --> 00:14:55,496
Yeah, exactly.

400
00:14:55,696 --> 00:14:59,116
Like you show up and he's looking unwashed t shirt and I don't know.

401
00:14:59,216 --> 00:14:59,776
Maybe it's great.

402
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:03,756
I think he was selling a lot of them as five nights at Freddie's birthday parties

403
00:15:03,756 --> 00:15:05,256
when that was still really big with kids.

404
00:15:05,256 --> 00:15:06,876
Oh, yeah. Which is a pretty cool idea.

405
00:15:06,996 --> 00:15:07,956
Appalizing. Yeah.

406
00:15:07,996 --> 00:15:08,976
That's not a bad idea.

407
00:15:09,236 --> 00:15:09,996
It's a pretty cool idea.

408
00:15:10,196 --> 00:15:12,216
But it had its moment and now I think it's over.

409
00:15:12,556 --> 00:15:13,276
My big Chuck E.

410
00:15:13,296 --> 00:15:16,556
Cheese memory is that like that was the place my brother and I were like,

411
00:15:16,556 --> 00:15:18,076
we got our report cards today.

412
00:15:18,176 --> 00:15:19,336
We did good.

413
00:15:19,536 --> 00:15:20,876
What do you say?

414
00:15:21,336 --> 00:15:22,016
I wish we did that.

415
00:15:22,116 --> 00:15:24,856
I feel like we I only went for like birthday parties and stuff.

416
00:15:24,856 --> 00:15:25,556
Yeah, me too.

417
00:15:25,676 --> 00:15:27,736
For a very limited time, the Chuck E.

418
00:15:27,796 --> 00:15:31,476
Cheese was right in the same shopping center as a comic book store.

419
00:15:31,556 --> 00:15:34,676
So I was like, let's kill two birds with one stone while we're here.

420
00:15:34,836 --> 00:15:36,216
That was as a kid.

421
00:15:36,216 --> 00:15:40,256
I was always like my mom's like, all right, I'm going to go to the mall to do some shopping.

422
00:15:40,256 --> 00:15:42,496
And I'm like, do you want some company?

423
00:15:42,576 --> 00:15:44,396
And I would just go like, just leave.

424
00:15:44,896 --> 00:15:47,596
I was like, I'm going to go to the comic store, the bookstore and stuff.

425
00:15:47,596 --> 00:15:49,976
And my mom is clearly smart to have in a mall, though,

426
00:15:50,016 --> 00:15:52,656
because you can have it as like a free childcare service.

427
00:15:52,856 --> 00:15:54,656
Yeah. Oh, oh, not the Chuck E.

428
00:15:54,676 --> 00:15:55,496
Cheese, just the comics.

429
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:56,776
You were just telling us about the mall.

430
00:15:56,776 --> 00:15:58,616
I feel like Chuck E.

431
00:15:58,616 --> 00:15:59,936
would be great to have in a mall.

432
00:16:00,016 --> 00:16:01,296
There is an Eagle Rock.

433
00:16:01,456 --> 00:16:02,776
The mall has a Chuck E.

434
00:16:02,816 --> 00:16:03,436
Cheese in it.

435
00:16:03,556 --> 00:16:05,876
I feel like I've only seen them outside.

436
00:16:05,916 --> 00:16:07,096
Yeah, it's outside, though.

437
00:16:07,116 --> 00:16:08,436
It's not inside a mall.

438
00:16:08,696 --> 00:16:09,816
I don't think I know.

439
00:16:10,016 --> 00:16:10,936
No, it is.

440
00:16:11,556 --> 00:16:13,076
Yeah, well, then I'm thinking of a different one.

441
00:16:13,436 --> 00:16:17,036
Then, but my eventually the compromise was like, all right,

442
00:16:17,036 --> 00:16:17,916
we'll go to Chuck E.

443
00:16:17,956 --> 00:16:22,756
Cheese, but let's just eat at the pizzeria down the road that we like

444
00:16:22,756 --> 00:16:25,816
instead of buying expensive bad pizza at Chuck E.

445
00:16:25,816 --> 00:16:25,996
Cheese.

446
00:16:26,156 --> 00:16:28,276
We'll awful just flour and.

447
00:16:28,276 --> 00:16:30,576
Sometimes I crave bad pizza, though.

448
00:16:30,636 --> 00:16:31,376
Sure. That's true.

449
00:16:31,396 --> 00:16:32,776
It brings you back.

450
00:16:32,876 --> 00:16:35,036
Sometimes you're like, I want a fairground pizza.

451
00:16:35,076 --> 00:16:36,916
And that's basically what Chuck E. has.

452
00:16:38,316 --> 00:16:43,596
This is very similar to Cosmic Ray's, a terrible restaurant.

453
00:16:44,136 --> 00:16:45,956
Well, yeah, you're right.

454
00:16:45,956 --> 00:16:47,916
We went on a tangent, but Chuck E.

455
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:49,196
Cheese is equally entertaining.

456
00:16:49,896 --> 00:16:50,196
Yeah.

457
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:55,736
It's like by point just being that to like the idea that Disney has its

458
00:16:55,736 --> 00:17:01,816
own version of the animatronic endlessly flapping to disinterested people.

459
00:17:01,816 --> 00:17:02,196
Right.

460
00:17:02,636 --> 00:17:08,236
To eat, get their bus, their trays and get out immediately.

461
00:17:08,636 --> 00:17:13,956
Like, what is the why do I I just I think it was a more magical world

462
00:17:14,296 --> 00:17:19,316
knowing that a rat like in many strip malls and places that you're passing by.

463
00:17:19,576 --> 00:17:21,436
There's there's robots.

464
00:17:21,876 --> 00:17:22,076
Yeah.

465
00:17:22,316 --> 00:17:23,596
Stores are so boring.

466
00:17:23,616 --> 00:17:25,716
Everywhere is like Coles or Ross.

467
00:17:25,796 --> 00:17:30,016
And not like one robot, like four to five giant robots.

468
00:17:30,196 --> 00:17:30,516
Yeah.

469
00:17:30,516 --> 00:17:33,636
So many with history and stories.

470
00:17:33,956 --> 00:17:34,236
Yeah.

471
00:17:34,516 --> 00:17:34,916
Characters.

472
00:17:34,936 --> 00:17:36,416
The one guy makes the pizza.

473
00:17:36,676 --> 00:17:37,016
Yeah.

474
00:17:37,316 --> 00:17:39,296
You're not just seeing.

475
00:17:39,596 --> 00:17:39,736
Yes.

476
00:17:39,996 --> 00:17:43,176
They're like and this training videos you can watch where he does.

477
00:17:43,336 --> 00:17:43,816
Yeah.

478
00:17:43,496 --> 00:17:44,296
Recipe.

479
00:17:44,516 --> 00:17:45,236
Those are the greatest.

480
00:17:45,336 --> 00:17:49,636
Did you guys ever go to a rocky and bowl ankles or is it just called bowl?

481
00:17:49,756 --> 00:17:50,436
One time.

482
00:17:50,596 --> 00:17:52,136
It is the faintest memory.

483
00:17:52,256 --> 00:17:52,676
I was so young.

484
00:17:52,736 --> 00:17:59,176
I only remember like one of the arcade machines was like a log that would light up and there was a spooky owl inside.

485
00:17:59,516 --> 00:18:00,736
And it scared me.

486
00:18:00,736 --> 00:18:01,756
So it stuck with me.

487
00:18:01,776 --> 00:18:02,656
That's all I remember.

488
00:18:02,836 --> 00:18:03,856
It must have been like two.

489
00:18:03,956 --> 00:18:05,476
It's pure magic.

490
00:18:05,736 --> 00:18:06,416
This stuff.

491
00:18:06,836 --> 00:18:08,356
It's so neat and weird.

492
00:18:08,356 --> 00:18:13,456
And I also I think it's also that it's experiential.

493
00:18:13,836 --> 00:18:15,856
Like you have to be there in person.

494
00:18:15,996 --> 00:18:17,696
I mean, you can watch videos of these things.

495
00:18:17,996 --> 00:18:32,116
But that like before YouTube, especially that Sonny Eclipse is doing his eight song set and the only place that you can witness this this once it in the back of a mediocre burger place in Disney World.

496
00:18:32,156 --> 00:18:35,596
Yeah, it's the only way you have to go there and see this weird thing.

497
00:18:35,596 --> 00:18:41,356
But it's a fully fleshed out mythology that you have to sit in one spot to get to learn his lore.

498
00:18:41,496 --> 00:18:42,336
Yeah, yeah.

499
00:18:42,356 --> 00:18:45,096
About his backup singers and his hometown and everything.

500
00:18:45,576 --> 00:18:49,996
It's also like kind of out of the way in a weird way in Tomorrowland, because I remember missing it.

501
00:18:49,996 --> 00:18:51,676
It's not even the first room with tables.

502
00:18:52,196 --> 00:18:52,596
Like, yeah, right.

503
00:18:52,616 --> 00:18:55,056
You have to keep walking to the tables that are around Sonny.

504
00:18:55,096 --> 00:18:56,536
And it's not on the main drag.

505
00:18:56,736 --> 00:18:57,836
It's like kind of in this weird back.

506
00:18:57,836 --> 00:18:58,716
It's as you're exiting.

507
00:18:58,716 --> 00:19:02,156
Yeah, when you're exiting toward Fantasyland by like the teacups.

508
00:19:02,576 --> 00:19:03,356
That's one of the things.

509
00:19:03,356 --> 00:19:08,636
I think the first time we went back like three or four years ago, I think we missed it in Tomorrowland.

510
00:19:08,716 --> 00:19:12,916
And then we're like next time we went back to Tomorrowland on that trip, we're like, oh, yeah, where was it?

511
00:19:12,916 --> 00:19:13,576
Where is he?

512
00:19:14,136 --> 00:19:17,136
So I bet most people don't see him.

513
00:19:17,136 --> 00:19:19,716
Yeah, I had trouble finding him and I was trying to.

514
00:19:20,036 --> 00:19:23,036
Eighty five percent of the people don't find him, which makes it cooler now.

515
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:23,576
Yeah.

516
00:19:23,576 --> 00:19:26,136
But it also makes his audiences sadder.

517
00:19:26,296 --> 00:19:26,916
It does.

518
00:19:27,036 --> 00:19:33,056
And I guess that's what's so cool about him is like there's literally no reason they had to put him in because it's not a good enough restaurant.

519
00:19:33,056 --> 00:19:34,376
The people are lingering.

520
00:19:34,716 --> 00:19:34,956
No.

521
00:19:34,956 --> 00:19:35,836
They're just going to eat it immediately.

522
00:19:36,276 --> 00:19:36,376
Leave.

523
00:19:36,456 --> 00:19:40,396
And I believe it was there before Tomorrowland 94.

524
00:19:40,396 --> 00:19:40,756
Really?

525
00:19:41,236 --> 00:19:41,816
Before it was done.

526
00:19:41,976 --> 00:19:42,756
I think the restaurant was.

527
00:19:42,756 --> 00:19:43,416
The restaurant was.

528
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:45,236
Yeah, I think that's been there for a while.

529
00:19:45,236 --> 00:19:45,656
And so was Sunny there?

530
00:19:45,716 --> 00:19:46,456
Did they have Sunny?

531
00:19:46,456 --> 00:19:50,416
No, Sunny came along with the Tomorrowland redo in the 90s.

532
00:19:51,036 --> 00:19:58,356
My family, I remember we liked Sunny for a little while because in addition to burgers, they had cheese steaks.

533
00:19:58,856 --> 00:20:02,476
And as Pratt Philadelphians, we were in Pratt.

534
00:20:02,476 --> 00:20:04,516
We were like, these aren't bad.

535
00:20:04,616 --> 00:20:08,856
Wait, but a Philadelphian would want to eat cheese steaks when not in Philadelphia?

536
00:20:09,236 --> 00:20:09,536
For every meal.

537
00:20:09,536 --> 00:20:14,036
It was at the time the food in Florida was so much pizza and burgers.

538
00:20:14,456 --> 00:20:14,496
That's true.

539
00:20:14,496 --> 00:20:17,516
Any little like, oh, a submarine sandwich.

540
00:20:17,976 --> 00:20:18,656
Oh, a cheese steak.

541
00:20:18,776 --> 00:20:19,456
Something different.

542
00:20:19,456 --> 00:20:20,116
Thank God.

543
00:20:20,116 --> 00:20:20,616
That's true.

544
00:20:20,976 --> 00:20:25,836
Well, of course, this restaurant had the three bays.

545
00:20:26,356 --> 00:20:27,496
The burger bay.

546
00:20:27,876 --> 00:20:28,736
The chicken bay.

547
00:20:28,736 --> 00:20:30,336
The chicken bay was the third bay.

548
00:20:30,336 --> 00:20:31,956
And didn't they even have a pizza bay?

549
00:20:32,076 --> 00:20:34,856
So they were hitting all the boxes of things that they have at theme parks.

550
00:20:34,996 --> 00:20:36,236
I don't think they do pizza anymore.

551
00:20:36,316 --> 00:20:37,176
All the greatest food.

552
00:20:37,176 --> 00:20:37,456
I don't think so.

553
00:20:37,656 --> 00:20:39,996
But of course, they thought it would be too on the nose to have pizza.

554
00:20:40,356 --> 00:20:43,036
An infamous Sheridan family story.

555
00:20:43,216 --> 00:20:45,376
So of course, it had the topping bar.

556
00:20:46,696 --> 00:20:48,756
Don't tell me you just went and got toppings.

557
00:20:48,756 --> 00:20:49,576
OK, hold on.

558
00:20:49,996 --> 00:20:51,036
I've heard that on the Life Hacklist.

559
00:20:51,316 --> 00:20:53,516
I've been like, now who would do that?

560
00:20:53,716 --> 00:20:54,376
Last year.

561
00:20:57,416 --> 00:21:01,436
So my God bless my very patient parents, but they would take turns

562
00:21:01,436 --> 00:21:04,716
being yanked around by me crisscrossing the park.

563
00:21:04,716 --> 00:21:06,716
And one night it was my mom's.

564
00:21:06,776 --> 00:21:10,716
I was yanking the whole family around the park and my dad and brother were starving.

565
00:21:11,296 --> 00:21:17,136
And my dad finally was just like, we're going to get something to eat.

566
00:21:17,196 --> 00:21:19,036
And my mom and I weren't really that hungry.

567
00:21:19,096 --> 00:21:22,116
So like we I dragged her off to somewhere else in the park.

568
00:21:22,496 --> 00:21:25,596
And Cosmic Rays was usually open later.

569
00:21:26,976 --> 00:21:30,976
So we went and did it one last ride or two or so.

570
00:21:30,996 --> 00:21:33,496
And then we met that we'll meet you, but we'll come back here when we're done.

571
00:21:33,516 --> 00:21:34,376
We came back.

572
00:21:34,676 --> 00:21:39,456
They were still eating their food because they were slowly to end.

573
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:41,316
My mom was like, I'm a little hungry.

574
00:21:41,816 --> 00:21:46,596
I don't want to buy anything, but realized she took a plate.

575
00:21:46,676 --> 00:21:50,176
You could make a salad just going down the toppings bar.

576
00:21:50,196 --> 00:21:51,596
You could construct a salad.

577
00:21:51,596 --> 00:21:55,496
Tomato and onions, tomato and lettuce and onion and stuff.

578
00:21:55,536 --> 00:21:59,696
And my mom still tells its story as victory and my dad.

579
00:21:59,816 --> 00:22:01,556
And I kind of got it at the time.

580
00:22:01,576 --> 00:22:05,996
And I'm sure now if I asked him, he would go like, Jesus Christ, what are we doing?

581
00:22:06,076 --> 00:22:09,776
Like, and but my mom still was she's like, that's what I figured out.

582
00:22:09,776 --> 00:22:11,636
You could make the salads at the bar.

583
00:22:11,716 --> 00:22:15,296
I've heard that literally on the status life hack lists where it's like

584
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:16,996
you can just eat the toppings.

585
00:22:17,096 --> 00:22:18,356
They won't stop you.

586
00:22:18,416 --> 00:22:20,816
It's like those life hacks where it's like in and out.

587
00:22:20,816 --> 00:22:24,316
You can put a lemon wedge and some sugar packets in a free water.

588
00:22:24,356 --> 00:22:26,416
And it's like, just buy the two dollar lemonade.

589
00:22:27,016 --> 00:22:27,316
I don't.

590
00:22:27,436 --> 00:22:27,636
Yeah.

591
00:22:27,696 --> 00:22:32,176
So they had at least bought a bunch of food because they hadn't really eaten in a while.

592
00:22:32,416 --> 00:22:34,396
So like, and we would go back there often.

593
00:22:34,396 --> 00:22:39,436
And because I was fond of study eclipse, I'm assuming they did not hate him

594
00:22:39,436 --> 00:22:41,216
as much time as we spent there.

595
00:22:41,496 --> 00:22:45,016
But yeah, I do remember my mom victoriously telling that story.

596
00:22:45,076 --> 00:22:48,276
And my dad, I'm sure being like, Jesus Christ, what's going on?

597
00:22:48,276 --> 00:22:49,696
I got a popping salad.

598
00:22:49,996 --> 00:22:55,176
If I was like life hack mom with like nine children where, you know, you visit once a year

599
00:22:55,176 --> 00:22:57,436
and you're like, we're going to spend nothing on this vacation.

600
00:22:57,476 --> 00:23:03,096
I would just bring in like those Hawaiian rolls into sunny eclipse and then like

601
00:23:03,096 --> 00:23:07,476
you either buy one thing or just buy nothing and just topping bar it up.

602
00:23:07,756 --> 00:23:07,856
Sure.

603
00:23:07,856 --> 00:23:09,096
Sounds really good, actually.

604
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:10,256
Customize your Hawaiian bar.

605
00:23:10,436 --> 00:23:11,076
The wine rolls.

606
00:23:11,256 --> 00:23:13,516
Probably better than that flavorless falafel burger.

607
00:23:13,736 --> 00:23:14,256
That sense.

608
00:23:14,516 --> 00:23:15,556
It was so dry.

609
00:23:15,796 --> 00:23:15,916
Yeah.

610
00:23:15,916 --> 00:23:16,916
Do they still have that?

611
00:23:16,916 --> 00:23:19,356
Yeah, it's the only vegetarian thing they have.

612
00:23:19,776 --> 00:23:24,076
And they also kind of just slathered it with like ketchup and mayo and onion straws

613
00:23:24,076 --> 00:23:25,196
and mushrooms and whatever.

614
00:23:25,276 --> 00:23:26,436
And nothing helped.

615
00:23:26,836 --> 00:23:31,796
They think they also were like they had a stunt burger for a while, like a pizza burger.

616
00:23:32,056 --> 00:23:32,616
Or like a pork pork.

617
00:23:32,616 --> 00:23:33,756
You call it a stunt burger?

618
00:23:33,916 --> 00:23:35,936
Like some sort of like Instagram.

619
00:23:36,536 --> 00:23:36,996
Like a gimmick burger.

620
00:23:37,096 --> 00:23:38,116
Like a gimmick.

621
00:23:38,156 --> 00:23:42,016
Yeah, a gimmick burger that was like universally panned.

622
00:23:42,236 --> 00:23:45,556
Like in the last few years, like people like, oh, Jesus, what were they thinking?

623
00:23:45,556 --> 00:23:49,916
The thing with like gimmick burgers is you're supposed to mix it up often enough that no

624
00:23:49,916 --> 00:23:52,236
one has a chance to like remark that it's bad.

625
00:23:52,256 --> 00:23:55,716
Like with the gross pizza of the day, they'll do a pizza port.

626
00:23:55,716 --> 00:23:56,316
Oh, we did that.

627
00:23:56,316 --> 00:23:57,716
It's hamburger pizza.

628
00:23:57,816 --> 00:23:58,536
Yeah, we had that.

629
00:23:58,556 --> 00:24:02,576
Which is the total reversal of the cheeseburger or the pizza cheeseburger.

630
00:24:02,876 --> 00:24:03,176
Yeah.

631
00:24:03,536 --> 00:24:05,056
Just keep flipping them back and forth.

632
00:24:06,316 --> 00:24:09,656
Yeah, my sister usually gets the weird pizzas when we go to pizza port.

633
00:24:09,736 --> 00:24:11,716
And sometimes she likes them.

634
00:24:11,816 --> 00:24:12,336
So I don't know.

635
00:24:12,336 --> 00:24:17,596
Yes, sometimes they'll do like garlic chicken pizza with barbecue sauce and ranch instead

636
00:24:17,596 --> 00:24:19,076
of tomato sauce.

637
00:24:19,076 --> 00:24:19,836
That seems okay.

638
00:24:19,836 --> 00:24:20,616
Yeah, that's okay.

639
00:24:20,676 --> 00:24:22,536
Well, I just invented the next specialty.

640
00:24:22,956 --> 00:24:23,256
That's pretty okay.

641
00:24:23,596 --> 00:24:23,816
All right.

642
00:24:23,996 --> 00:24:25,776
That's like a CPK barbecue chicken.

643
00:24:26,136 --> 00:24:26,316
Yeah, sure.

644
00:24:26,476 --> 00:24:26,836
Okay.

645
00:24:26,936 --> 00:24:33,416
So if we haven't, if you haven't been to see Sonny, if you aren't intrigued by the

646
00:24:33,416 --> 00:24:40,176
fact that it is a bad restaurant, especially for vegetarians, that's not enough to get you in the

647
00:24:40,176 --> 00:24:41,316
cheese sauce in a pump.

648
00:24:41,516 --> 00:24:46,116
Also, this isn't like regulated by any sort of system.

649
00:24:46,136 --> 00:24:47,536
You can just go in there.

650
00:24:47,536 --> 00:24:49,196
You can bring food and sit down.

651
00:24:49,416 --> 00:24:53,296
So like, don't let our trashing of the menu dissuade you.

652
00:24:53,536 --> 00:24:56,676
Sometimes my friends would just go in there for a sit and just like watch Sonny Eclipse.

653
00:24:56,676 --> 00:24:57,316
Totally fine.

654
00:24:57,376 --> 00:25:01,056
I say my friends, but like I would be doing it and I would just be bringing them with

655
00:25:01,056 --> 00:25:01,356
me.

656
00:25:01,356 --> 00:25:03,236
And usually I wouldn't tell them where we were going.

657
00:25:04,036 --> 00:25:05,776
I would just be like, oh, there's a good place to sit down.

658
00:25:05,776 --> 00:25:08,316
And they'd be like, it's that robot alien you're always talking about.

659
00:25:09,016 --> 00:25:09,556
Yay.

660
00:25:09,836 --> 00:25:14,736
I believe when it is like packed, packed, they, there was someone finding you a table.

661
00:25:14,976 --> 00:25:18,056
So they might be a little, I've never seen it like that either.

662
00:25:18,196 --> 00:25:22,836
I think as I was like in the heart of August, summer and like, yeah, it was a busy season.

663
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:23,136
Yeah.

664
00:25:23,256 --> 00:25:23,756
Peak summer.

665
00:25:24,116 --> 00:25:26,376
So they send a mater de into cosmic gray.

666
00:25:26,736 --> 00:25:26,896
Wow.

667
00:25:26,896 --> 00:25:27,416
Yeah.

668
00:25:27,416 --> 00:25:28,296
That's impressive.

669
00:25:28,476 --> 00:25:34,116
Now, well, one thing is that, you know, yeah, we're watching he's, he's this, he's this

670
00:25:36,436 --> 00:25:43,556
Lizzard and they do flesh out this mythology where the restaurant you're in cosmic rays,

671
00:25:43,556 --> 00:25:44,376
starlight cafe.

672
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:45,276
It's not arbitrary.

673
00:25:45,356 --> 00:25:50,796
They tie it all together and he talks about cosmic ray and working for cosmic ray.

674
00:25:51,056 --> 00:25:52,056
He's employed by cosmic ray.

675
00:25:52,136 --> 00:25:54,396
Don't mistake him for the owner of the restaurant.

676
00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:55,016
Yes.

677
00:25:55,076 --> 00:25:55,916
He's entertainment.

678
00:25:55,956 --> 00:25:57,936
Confusingly, it's not Sonny Eclipse's restaurant.

679
00:25:57,996 --> 00:26:00,456
He just works there and apparently for not a lot of money.

680
00:26:00,456 --> 00:26:03,856
In a real world sense, it makes more sense that he doesn't own the restaurant.

681
00:26:04,116 --> 00:26:08,376
He's entertaining that opposed to the Chuck E cheese model in like theme park vibe.

682
00:26:08,376 --> 00:26:11,216
You feel like he'd be the face of it and the owner and everything.

683
00:26:11,376 --> 00:26:16,716
But what a difficult job that you're the entertainer at all times, all hours of the day

684
00:26:16,716 --> 00:26:17,696
and the owner.

685
00:26:17,696 --> 00:26:18,056
Yeah.

686
00:26:18,516 --> 00:26:24,116
At least Chuck distributes the cooking task to Pasquale.

687
00:26:24,436 --> 00:26:26,456
And also Chuck doesn't perform all day.

688
00:26:26,816 --> 00:26:31,456
I think he performs on the hour or something for like a good 15, 20 minute show.

689
00:26:31,456 --> 00:26:32,276
It's not a loop.

690
00:26:32,276 --> 00:26:33,596
Sonny Eclipse never stops.

691
00:26:33,616 --> 00:26:33,976
Never stops.

692
00:26:34,116 --> 00:26:36,396
Imagine the wear on that animatronic.

693
00:26:36,396 --> 00:26:37,136
Yeah.

694
00:26:37,156 --> 00:26:39,876
Constant and he moves like a pretty good amount.

695
00:26:40,116 --> 00:26:40,376
Yeah.

696
00:26:40,396 --> 00:26:41,716
He rotates his whole body.

697
00:26:41,936 --> 00:26:42,056
His arms move a lot.

698
00:26:42,056 --> 00:26:43,496
He's much better than a Chuck E cheese.

699
00:26:43,516 --> 00:26:44,956
I think his toes tap too.

700
00:26:44,976 --> 00:26:46,736
It's not a cheap looking thing.

701
00:26:46,796 --> 00:26:47,696
No, he looks good.

702
00:26:47,756 --> 00:26:50,376
He looks so much better than and the room isn't bad,

703
00:26:50,376 --> 00:26:52,616
but he looks so much better than everything around him.

704
00:26:52,636 --> 00:26:52,856
He does.

705
00:26:52,856 --> 00:26:55,996
It does feel like he deserves a better space to perform in.

706
00:26:56,056 --> 00:26:59,636
Have you seen the videos of maintenance mode Sonny Eclipse?

707
00:26:59,996 --> 00:27:00,196
No.

708
00:27:00,336 --> 00:27:03,196
Sometimes they'll have like a school talent perform on that stage.

709
00:27:03,196 --> 00:27:08,356
And I believe I saw a video where they were retracting him into the ceiling.

710
00:27:08,356 --> 00:27:08,616
Yes.

711
00:27:08,616 --> 00:27:09,156
He goes up.

712
00:27:09,156 --> 00:27:10,736
He goes up into the sky.

713
00:27:10,736 --> 00:27:12,416
It's amazing.

714
00:27:12,996 --> 00:27:15,216
Everyone's like, I think there was a comment on the YouTube video,

715
00:27:15,256 --> 00:27:17,676
like the space angels are calling him home.

716
00:27:17,676 --> 00:27:19,736
It's beautiful.

717
00:27:20,136 --> 00:27:20,876
Coming for you ladies.

718
00:27:21,296 --> 00:27:23,416
Highly recommend looking up a video of that happening.

719
00:27:23,416 --> 00:27:26,356
Sonny, please don't die on your way back to your home planet like Pucci.

720
00:27:26,776 --> 00:27:26,816
Yeah.

721
00:27:27,176 --> 00:27:28,476
My people need me.

722
00:27:28,956 --> 00:27:29,296
Wow.

723
00:27:29,636 --> 00:27:30,076
You know what's funny?

724
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:35,036
The voice that I just did was sort of like a borscht belty, almost Chuck E.

725
00:27:35,036 --> 00:27:39,156
Cheesy thing, which in my, I think until I went back and rewatched, I assumed that's

726
00:27:39,156 --> 00:27:39,896
his voice.

727
00:27:40,156 --> 00:27:44,236
But if I'm doing a real Sonny Eclipse impression, it's like, hey folks, I'm Sonny Eclipse.

728
00:27:44,356 --> 00:27:44,516
Yeah.

729
00:27:44,516 --> 00:27:45,276
He's a lounge singer.

730
00:27:45,396 --> 00:27:49,516
He's like a Sinatra or if we're being a modern, a Michael Buble perhaps.

731
00:27:49,676 --> 00:27:51,016
Very true.

732
00:27:51,076 --> 00:27:55,256
A little fun fact I learned is that the man who provided the voice of Sonny Eclipse has

733
00:27:55,256 --> 00:27:57,156
never seen the animatronic perform.

734
00:27:57,376 --> 00:27:57,596
Yes.

735
00:27:58,236 --> 00:28:03,636
That's a great segue into my deep dive on the voice of Sonny Eclipse, the performer

736
00:28:03,636 --> 00:28:04,696
Cal David.

737
00:28:04,976 --> 00:28:06,216
And I'm excited for this.

738
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:08,276
So Cal David, yeah, he does the voice.

739
00:28:08,636 --> 00:28:12,516
It's sort of unclear if he truly wrote or helped at all writing the songs.

740
00:28:12,656 --> 00:28:13,476
I highly doubt it.

741
00:28:13,476 --> 00:28:14,976
He didn't write the lyrics for sure.

742
00:28:15,196 --> 00:28:17,296
I don't think he had anything to do with it because he was-

743
00:28:17,296 --> 00:28:18,436
I think he's a session singer.

744
00:28:18,596 --> 00:28:19,396
He's a session singer.

745
00:28:19,416 --> 00:28:21,496
He was recruited by George Wilkins.

746
00:28:21,896 --> 00:28:22,756
Do you know about all that?

747
00:28:22,896 --> 00:28:23,596
Yes, I do.

748
00:28:23,676 --> 00:28:25,536
I mean, you might have more information than I do.

749
00:28:25,556 --> 00:28:26,096
Maybe a little.

750
00:28:26,176 --> 00:28:28,516
He wrote, you have in front of you.

751
00:28:29,016 --> 00:28:33,856
George Wilkins, his main claim to fame is he wrote all the Teddy Ruxpin music.

752
00:28:34,136 --> 00:28:36,476
He has all the Disney stuff too.

753
00:28:36,676 --> 00:28:37,096
Oh, sure.

754
00:28:37,736 --> 00:28:39,016
Well, I mean, first things first-

755
00:28:39,016 --> 00:28:39,536
What, like Disney TV shows?

756
00:28:39,536 --> 00:28:44,856
For the tapes and for the TV show, he wrote 150 Teddy Ruxpin songs.

757
00:28:44,856 --> 00:28:49,316
At the time when they were really cranking that property, three to four a week.

758
00:28:49,316 --> 00:28:50,156
When they had Grubby-

759
00:28:50,156 --> 00:28:50,576
Constantly.

760
00:28:50,836 --> 00:28:51,416
That's wild.

761
00:28:51,496 --> 00:28:53,716
When they had Grubby, the best Teddy Ruxpin character.

762
00:28:53,716 --> 00:28:54,656
I don't know about Grubby.

763
00:28:54,716 --> 00:28:58,376
I found out recently he looks almost identical to Skippy, which is pretty rad.

764
00:28:58,516 --> 00:28:59,336
Oh, he does.

765
00:28:59,656 --> 00:28:59,896
I know.

766
00:28:59,896 --> 00:29:00,576
I was shook.

767
00:29:00,976 --> 00:29:01,916
I was shook when I found out.

768
00:29:02,156 --> 00:29:02,176
That's wild.

769
00:29:02,176 --> 00:29:02,856
I was like, I could buy this.

770
00:29:02,976 --> 00:29:05,016
It's like having Skippy, the animatronic.

771
00:29:05,256 --> 00:29:05,676
Oh, cool.

772
00:29:05,696 --> 00:29:07,056
Also, this is a side note.

773
00:29:07,056 --> 00:29:08,876
We can't get sidetracked because we're already too sidetracked.

774
00:29:08,876 --> 00:29:09,436
Oh, no.

775
00:29:09,556 --> 00:29:14,096
Hanna Barbera had a show called Hillbilly Bears a few years before Country Bears.

776
00:29:14,236 --> 00:29:14,636
What?

777
00:29:14,776 --> 00:29:15,336
Interesting.

778
00:29:15,336 --> 00:29:16,796
So that's interesting to me.

779
00:29:16,816 --> 00:29:21,616
I was trying to figure out where the first bears that were Hillbillies came from.

780
00:29:21,696 --> 00:29:22,836
I was like, oh, okay.

781
00:29:22,836 --> 00:29:28,696
So Hanna Barbera, George Wilkins, co-writer on the California Screamin' song.

782
00:29:28,956 --> 00:29:29,576
Is that right?

783
00:29:29,676 --> 00:29:31,116
And it's tough to be a bug.

784
00:29:31,596 --> 00:29:33,836
And The Great Outdoors was written by him.

785
00:29:34,276 --> 00:29:34,976
Ain't nothing but The Great Outdoors.

786
00:29:35,036 --> 00:29:37,696
All the Country Bears Christmas songs is where it's from.

787
00:29:38,536 --> 00:29:42,576
And then George Wilkins was like the protege of Buddy Baker,

788
00:29:43,076 --> 00:29:47,516
who is a co-writer on Haunted Mansion stuff and a bunch of other Disney stuff.

789
00:29:47,536 --> 00:29:48,016
That's crazy.

790
00:29:48,096 --> 00:29:51,416
And this guy George is friends with Cal David.

791
00:29:52,116 --> 00:29:53,996
That's why he's in there.

792
00:29:54,356 --> 00:29:54,656
Cal David.

793
00:29:54,656 --> 00:29:55,576
Everything's intertwined.

794
00:29:55,596 --> 00:29:56,536
Everything's intertwined.

795
00:29:56,956 --> 00:29:57,596
We've got Stippy and Grubby.

796
00:29:57,896 --> 00:29:59,156
We've got Buddy Baker.

797
00:29:59,596 --> 00:30:02,556
Actually, there's a reason I don't own a Grubby.

798
00:30:02,836 --> 00:30:06,396
And it's that it only works if you hardwire it to a working Teddy Ruxpin.

799
00:30:06,836 --> 00:30:08,716
You can't just get Grubby.

800
00:30:08,716 --> 00:30:10,676
They have a symbiotic relationship.

801
00:30:10,696 --> 00:30:11,476
It is symbiotic.

802
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:14,276
You have to wire them together.

803
00:30:14,536 --> 00:30:19,256
So Grubby is really just a display piece unless you can hack him somehow.

804
00:30:20,116 --> 00:30:22,236
There's some enterprising hacker out there.

805
00:30:22,236 --> 00:30:26,216
I need some animatronics expert to make me an Alexa hookup Grubby.

806
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:28,176
Oh man, somebody's got to be able to do that.

807
00:30:28,516 --> 00:30:30,796
Probably the guy, the Rockafire guy can do it.

808
00:30:30,816 --> 00:30:31,696
Oh, he would do it.

809
00:30:31,696 --> 00:30:33,076
He'd probably do it for a hundred bucks.

810
00:30:33,076 --> 00:30:33,276
Yeah.

811
00:30:34,136 --> 00:30:36,676
Chris Pundo and he'll do the job.

812
00:30:38,136 --> 00:30:38,616
Cal David.

813
00:30:38,796 --> 00:30:39,556
So Cal David.

814
00:30:40,156 --> 00:30:41,156
So did you read about his early?

815
00:30:41,176 --> 00:30:46,736
Scott, so excuse us now for some old man baby boomer rock stuff that we love.

816
00:30:46,896 --> 00:30:48,516
Do you know what I'm talking to say here?

817
00:30:48,536 --> 00:30:49,196
I don't know.

818
00:30:49,296 --> 00:30:54,016
So Cal David is from Chicago and his first band is,

819
00:30:54,016 --> 00:30:58,636
hold on, let me find it's Cal David and the Exceptions.

820
00:30:58,676 --> 00:31:00,456
And it was formed in 1962.

821
00:31:00,676 --> 00:31:01,316
What's their hit?

822
00:31:01,876 --> 00:31:04,296
Well, I have it here and it's good.

823
00:31:04,596 --> 00:31:08,996
I don't think it was a hit, but it's like, I think it's maybe their most famous single.

824
00:31:09,096 --> 00:31:12,816
It's the only one I think I found on YouTube of Cal David and the Exceptions.

825
00:31:14,016 --> 00:31:17,936
But he was in the band with, I'm trying to find, sorry.

826
00:31:18,036 --> 00:31:22,576
Wanted to just be the New York song when he starts playing the lyrics and all.

827
00:31:22,576 --> 00:31:24,556
He invented the New York concept.

828
00:31:24,576 --> 00:31:26,196
Very specific set of talents.

829
00:31:27,196 --> 00:31:28,676
I have this idea about an opposite city.

830
00:31:28,996 --> 00:31:29,236
This guy.

831
00:31:29,296 --> 00:31:29,916
Everything's upside down.

832
00:31:30,076 --> 00:31:30,596
It's wild, man.

833
00:31:31,036 --> 00:31:33,076
Denny Ebert, who I did not know.

834
00:31:33,936 --> 00:31:38,476
This guy, Marty Greb and Greb will later join the Buckinghams who had a hit.

835
00:31:38,516 --> 00:31:42,256
Marty Greb sounds like a fake space character you write.

836
00:31:42,496 --> 00:31:42,836
Yeah.

837
00:31:43,816 --> 00:31:45,996
Marty Greb, the mayor of Tomorrowland.

838
00:31:46,016 --> 00:31:46,836
Friends with Grebby.

839
00:31:46,996 --> 00:31:47,056
Yeah.

840
00:31:47,776 --> 00:31:51,176
Big information score is that he was in this band with Peter Satara.

841
00:31:51,176 --> 00:31:52,096
What?

842
00:31:52,636 --> 00:31:53,196
Now we're talking.

843
00:31:53,196 --> 00:31:55,556
Now we're talking from the band Chicago.

844
00:31:55,656 --> 00:31:56,236
Oh, okay.

845
00:31:56,536 --> 00:31:56,776
Okay.

846
00:31:56,836 --> 00:31:59,616
A Chicago music buddy of Peter Satara.

847
00:31:59,836 --> 00:32:04,616
He was Cal David and Peter Satara were in a band together in the 60s.

848
00:32:04,776 --> 00:32:09,556
And it is, I have too many tabs open on my computer, both Sonny Eclipse related things.

849
00:32:10,816 --> 00:32:11,476
Computers, we'd start smoking.

850
00:32:11,556 --> 00:32:13,436
I have the Cal David song.

851
00:32:13,996 --> 00:32:14,176
Hold on.

852
00:32:14,176 --> 00:32:14,916
With Satara?

853
00:32:15,156 --> 00:32:15,976
With Satara.

854
00:32:16,656 --> 00:32:18,576
It's called Chicago, my man.

855
00:32:18,676 --> 00:32:19,296
Real good.

856
00:32:19,396 --> 00:32:20,976
Questions 67, 68.

857
00:32:21,216 --> 00:32:25,956
This is a little more like kind of blue eyed soul, like Gary US Bonds type.

858
00:32:25,956 --> 00:32:26,296
Okay.

859
00:32:26,776 --> 00:32:27,616
Which I'm way into.

860
00:32:28,016 --> 00:32:28,936
Who's singing what you're going to play me?

861
00:32:28,936 --> 00:32:30,556
It's Sonny Eclipse.

862
00:32:30,776 --> 00:32:30,936
What?

863
00:32:30,936 --> 00:32:31,216
He's singing.

864
00:32:31,736 --> 00:32:32,096
What?

865
00:32:32,356 --> 00:32:32,576
Okay.

866
00:32:33,136 --> 00:32:34,356
Early Sonny.

867
00:32:34,556 --> 00:32:36,456
Or this is early Sonny Eclipse.

868
00:32:36,916 --> 00:32:37,776
I'm just realizing if I-

869
00:32:37,776 --> 00:32:40,476
We're going to find out if the voice is an affect or if it's just how he sings.

870
00:32:40,596 --> 00:32:45,716
I'm going to do it on my phone because I don't want to get like,

871
00:32:45,976 --> 00:32:47,356
IMs or anything right now.

872
00:32:48,196 --> 00:32:50,316
Sorry about this, Phil, Phil, Phil.

873
00:32:50,536 --> 00:32:50,876
I'm realizing-

874
00:32:50,876 --> 00:32:52,116
Well, here we go, here we go, here we go.

875
00:32:52,116 --> 00:32:52,456
Got it.

876
00:32:53,536 --> 00:32:53,916
All right.

877
00:32:54,196 --> 00:32:57,516
I've listened to this song, by the way, maybe 10 times in the last 24 hours.

878
00:32:58,376 --> 00:32:59,796
Are you going to sing along though?

879
00:33:09,708 --> 00:33:12,008
It sounds exactly like it.

880
00:33:16,108 --> 00:33:17,748
We'll go to the chorus.

881
00:33:18,128 --> 00:33:19,688
Does it sound like Spotify or anything?

882
00:33:19,828 --> 00:33:20,368
I don't know.

883
00:33:21,088 --> 00:33:26,828
This is so new that I'm...

884
00:33:26,828 --> 00:33:28,368
And Satara's on this too?

885
00:33:28,608 --> 00:33:32,288
That's what I...apparently there's so little information though about...

886
00:33:32,288 --> 00:33:32,908
He handled this.

887
00:33:32,908 --> 00:33:35,208
And the title is Day Dreaming of You?

888
00:33:35,588 --> 00:33:37,088
I'm gonna look this up.

889
00:33:37,088 --> 00:33:39,708
Peter Satara and Sonny Eclipse were in a band.

890
00:33:40,828 --> 00:33:42,508
Yes. Sonny Eclipse is a talented guy.

891
00:33:42,708 --> 00:33:43,388
Insane.

892
00:33:43,628 --> 00:33:43,908
Yeah.

893
00:33:43,968 --> 00:33:52,008
Well, when I Googled the guy, one of the first Google images was a photo of him arm-in-arm recently with Jimmy Vivino, leader of the Kona.

894
00:33:52,008 --> 00:33:55,008
Wonderful musician, wonderful guy. What's that?

895
00:33:55,188 --> 00:33:57,328
I wanted you to say with the Sonny Eclipse animatronic.

896
00:33:57,448 --> 00:33:58,808
No, I guess he never met him.

897
00:33:58,808 --> 00:33:59,468
He never met him.

898
00:33:59,608 --> 00:34:07,808
I listened to an interview years ago with the guy who composed the music for the Marvel Super Hero Island area music.

899
00:34:08,088 --> 00:34:08,148
Sure.

900
00:34:08,388 --> 00:34:10,888
And he was like, yeah, I've never been down there. Never seen it.

901
00:34:11,388 --> 00:34:13,828
My kids are almost teenagers. They'd probably like it.

902
00:34:14,068 --> 00:34:15,368
They'd probably like to go down there.

903
00:34:15,388 --> 00:34:15,808
I don't get that.

904
00:34:15,908 --> 00:34:16,648
Yeah, I don't either.

905
00:34:16,768 --> 00:34:22,208
And I didn't know because I had heard he'd never seen Sonny Eclipse, but I didn't know if that was dated information.

906
00:34:22,308 --> 00:34:25,648
Maybe if he said that in the early 2000s and he's been since.

907
00:34:25,708 --> 00:34:26,888
How would you resist?

908
00:34:26,888 --> 00:34:27,908
Yeah, it is.

909
00:34:28,068 --> 00:34:31,748
Okay, so you've been a voice of a robot for over 20 years.

910
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:32,188
Yeah.

911
00:34:32,408 --> 00:34:39,268
As of June 7th, 2018, Cal David had still not seen Sonny Eclipse.

912
00:34:39,388 --> 00:34:43,728
I know because I listened to his interview on the Tiara talk show.

913
00:34:43,728 --> 00:34:44,348
What?

914
00:34:44,768 --> 00:34:46,868
This is a show that I don't think exists anymore.

915
00:34:46,908 --> 00:34:47,588
How many views?

916
00:34:47,968 --> 00:34:49,268
127 views.

917
00:34:49,568 --> 00:34:49,748
No.

918
00:34:49,768 --> 00:34:54,528
There is an interview and I have not listened to it with Debbie Reynolds on this YouTube channel.

919
00:34:54,528 --> 00:34:55,008
Oh my God.

920
00:34:55,008 --> 00:34:57,008
It says Debbie Reynolds and then there's a Disney connection.

921
00:34:57,008 --> 00:34:58,408
How many views on that one?

922
00:34:58,888 --> 00:34:59,748
140 years.

923
00:35:00,028 --> 00:35:00,068
No.

924
00:35:00,068 --> 00:35:01,108
It was that low.

925
00:35:01,908 --> 00:35:02,408
So I was like, oh my God.

926
00:35:02,408 --> 00:35:05,548
Old people don't understand what online numbers to look for.

927
00:35:05,648 --> 00:35:07,128
They're like, a hundred. That's a lot.

928
00:35:07,588 --> 00:35:12,748
Well, Cal, God bless him. This interview is exclusively about Sonny Eclipse.

929
00:35:13,248 --> 00:35:17,428
This has nothing to do with any of his music. He has had a long career.

930
00:35:17,688 --> 00:35:19,568
I'm sold. I'm going to be the 128th view.

931
00:35:20,848 --> 00:35:22,808
I knew the audience could be 129.

932
00:35:22,808 --> 00:35:26,528
So Kaiser Permanente, Tiara Time, whatever it's called.

933
00:35:27,248 --> 00:35:28,468
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

934
00:35:28,468 --> 00:35:31,608
We got a lot of homework for you on this Spark Hopper day.

935
00:35:32,268 --> 00:35:36,048
So Cal is honestly, he is a great sport in this interview.

936
00:35:36,048 --> 00:35:36,348
Good.

937
00:35:36,448 --> 00:35:37,788
He's like Skyped in.

938
00:35:38,068 --> 00:35:44,348
This very nice sounding girl is asking him just exclusive Disney and Sonny Eclipse questions.

939
00:35:44,628 --> 00:35:46,688
He's had a long career of like playing.

940
00:35:46,708 --> 00:35:49,428
And I'm sure he remembers nothing of that recording session.

941
00:35:49,428 --> 00:35:55,468
You know, you he he remembers more than I would think, because he's kind of like an old blues guy.

942
00:35:55,468 --> 00:35:57,788
Basically, he plays blues. He's still playing.

943
00:35:58,048 --> 00:36:00,148
He plays out in like in the desert.

944
00:36:00,328 --> 00:36:00,588
He's in.

945
00:36:00,868 --> 00:36:03,788
I would go see him live if he played even one Sonny Eclipse song.

946
00:36:04,008 --> 00:36:05,808
We have to figure this out.

947
00:36:05,808 --> 00:36:08,788
I would do it regardless. I can have him sign my Park Stars.

948
00:36:09,128 --> 00:36:11,048
We have to figure it out.

949
00:36:11,208 --> 00:36:13,448
Could we go make this happen?

950
00:36:14,128 --> 00:36:14,908
Yeah. Well, that's so.

951
00:36:14,908 --> 00:36:17,308
So I found where he plays.

952
00:36:17,548 --> 00:36:19,128
It's it's this.

953
00:36:19,448 --> 00:36:21,448
I have too many tabs open and I'm getting mad.

954
00:36:21,488 --> 00:36:23,888
I can have a birthday party at Chuck E.

955
00:36:23,948 --> 00:36:27,768
Cheese, but book my own performer and it's Sonny Eclipse.

956
00:36:27,768 --> 00:36:32,948
So can you imagine he's performing next to a barely active robot?

957
00:36:33,368 --> 00:36:35,048
Yeah. Oh, my God.

958
00:36:35,108 --> 00:36:38,048
It's super meta, but it's really going to bring the house down.

959
00:36:38,088 --> 00:36:42,168
We could make him do all the jokes, but then write him some new jokes.

960
00:36:42,288 --> 00:36:44,548
And he would know the voice of Sonny Eclipse.

961
00:36:45,528 --> 00:36:46,428
Comedy dream.

962
00:36:46,888 --> 00:36:48,548
He plays. OK, here we go.

963
00:36:48,668 --> 00:36:52,208
It's Vickies of Santa Fe in Indian Wells.

964
00:36:52,208 --> 00:36:54,648
So he's like, yeah, it's Palm Springs.

965
00:36:54,868 --> 00:36:57,348
So he just lives in Palm Springs and he plays.

966
00:36:57,448 --> 00:37:01,088
He's been with his wife, Lori Bono.

967
00:37:01,288 --> 00:37:02,488
I think is how you pronounce it.

968
00:37:02,688 --> 00:37:04,688
He's been with her for like 40 years and they played together.

969
00:37:04,728 --> 00:37:06,088
Married to Bono.

970
00:37:06,428 --> 00:37:11,148
Oh, a Bono and and Laura and she is one of the angels.

971
00:37:11,368 --> 00:37:12,028
What?

972
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:15,528
So we could get is that how they met and fell in love?

973
00:37:16,008 --> 00:37:17,988
No, but it would be a great story.

974
00:37:18,468 --> 00:37:21,308
So she I always shipped Sonny and one of his space.

975
00:37:21,888 --> 00:37:23,408
Sure. Of course.

976
00:37:23,428 --> 00:37:24,588
How could you not? Yeah.

977
00:37:24,708 --> 00:37:29,248
He said that. So in this interview on this Tiara show, he says that his

978
00:37:29,248 --> 00:37:33,268
that his wife at the time had a group of singers with her.

979
00:37:33,388 --> 00:37:35,908
She was in them, I think, called the Brunettes.

980
00:37:36,068 --> 00:37:39,568
And it was Lori Bono, Patty Brooks and Amy Weston.

981
00:37:39,568 --> 00:37:41,668
Those are the space angels.

982
00:37:41,668 --> 00:37:43,928
So we have the names of the space.

983
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:45,368
We can keep researching deeper and deeper.

984
00:37:45,528 --> 00:37:47,488
We can look up the lives of all the space angels.

985
00:37:47,548 --> 00:37:49,548
We're going to have to go do a deeper dive.

986
00:37:49,608 --> 00:37:50,988
You need to come back in a couple of months.

987
00:37:51,308 --> 00:37:55,328
You guys need to have like a crazy, like beautiful mind thing on your wall.

988
00:37:55,628 --> 00:38:00,308
Well, Mike already has all these printouts with red yarn connecting them all.

989
00:38:00,468 --> 00:38:02,608
Newspaper clippings from like yesterday.

990
00:38:03,128 --> 00:38:06,628
Mike's going to be hauled away to an institution saying too many tabs, too many tabs.

991
00:38:07,228 --> 00:38:10,908
Mike bought that new monitor from CES.

992
00:38:11,188 --> 00:38:17,788
That is like the length of the desk that you can make a horizontal or vertical.

993
00:38:18,008 --> 00:38:20,788
All Cal David related. Did you guys come across?

994
00:38:20,888 --> 00:38:25,648
They recorded these songs like at George Wilkins House, I believe.

995
00:38:26,088 --> 00:38:32,788
I think I saw something about the space angel like they recorded him, recorded them all.

996
00:38:33,588 --> 00:38:34,028
Yeah.

997
00:38:33,868 --> 00:38:39,628
And they didn't know in that moment that they were going to record one of the most popular albums of all time.

998
00:38:39,628 --> 00:38:42,968
Yeah, we didn't know what we were doing.

999
00:38:43,128 --> 00:38:44,828
We're just kids, missing out on you know.

1000
00:38:45,468 --> 00:38:45,708
Yeah.

1001
00:38:45,708 --> 00:38:48,768
Cal in that interview did remember a lot of it.

1002
00:38:48,968 --> 00:38:49,288
What?

1003
00:38:49,368 --> 00:38:52,668
And he seemed like kind of funny, like, aha, I think he called the joke.

1004
00:38:52,988 --> 00:38:58,448
So again, if you don't know, Sonny will do a lot of bad puns in between his songs.

1005
00:38:58,628 --> 00:39:05,928
And I think Cal said he goes, you know, I'm a little more urbane than Sonny, but you know, those jokes play well in Disney.

1006
00:39:06,048 --> 00:39:08,508
Like he seemed like he was like a pretty, he was game.

1007
00:39:08,508 --> 00:39:09,808
I want to see him live.

1008
00:39:10,048 --> 00:39:16,008
He remembered the, he remembered the songs and she, because she asked him what his favorite song was.

1009
00:39:16,468 --> 00:39:17,468
And he said.

1010
00:39:17,468 --> 00:39:19,168
And he knew the name of one of the songs.

1011
00:39:19,188 --> 00:39:19,408
He did.

1012
00:39:19,628 --> 00:39:21,208
I'm impressed by that.

1013
00:39:21,348 --> 00:39:23,368
Yeah. And I'm trying to, again, too many tabs here.

1014
00:39:23,368 --> 00:39:25,288
I've got one that I'm hoping it is.

1015
00:39:25,528 --> 00:39:26,208
It's the.

1016
00:39:26,408 --> 00:39:26,828
I do too.

1017
00:39:26,828 --> 00:39:28,708
It's the second one with the angels.

1018
00:39:28,808 --> 00:39:30,408
It's the little, what is it?

1019
00:39:30,408 --> 00:39:31,288
What are the names of the songs?

1020
00:39:31,748 --> 00:39:33,428
Hello space angel.

1021
00:39:33,908 --> 00:39:35,828
That's the first space angel song, right?

1022
00:39:35,948 --> 00:39:36,188
Okay.

1023
00:39:36,188 --> 00:39:37,228
That's where he introduces them.

1024
00:39:37,228 --> 00:39:37,388
Yes.

1025
00:39:37,448 --> 00:39:39,148
It's the second name.

1026
00:39:39,328 --> 00:39:40,228
The song does somebody have the song?

1027
00:39:40,768 --> 00:39:43,088
I was going to say out in space.

1028
00:39:43,288 --> 00:39:46,408
The one where it sounds like he wants to have sex with earth.

1029
00:39:46,628 --> 00:39:48,688
Loves the center of the universe.

1030
00:39:48,948 --> 00:39:50,328
There's bright little star.

1031
00:39:50,408 --> 00:39:51,248
It's bright little star.

1032
00:39:51,468 --> 00:39:51,928
That's his favorite.

1033
00:39:51,928 --> 00:39:54,028
That's my favorite Sonny Eclipse song as well.

1034
00:39:54,028 --> 00:39:55,528
So you and Cal are on the same page.

1035
00:39:55,528 --> 00:39:56,808
Yeah.

1036
00:39:57,728 --> 00:40:02,528
And he's singing about a long distance relationship with perhaps a space angel.

1037
00:40:03,188 --> 00:40:03,608
Yeah.

1038
00:40:04,368 --> 00:40:07,168
And he's saying that like that your light is shining on me,

1039
00:40:07,328 --> 00:40:08,968
even though we're far away from each other.

1040
00:40:09,028 --> 00:40:13,008
We explicitly said that his backup singers, the space angels,

1041
00:40:13,328 --> 00:40:14,508
the fact that I learned from your video,

1042
00:40:14,508 --> 00:40:18,888
I know this fact that the space angels are disembodied backup singers

1043
00:40:18,888 --> 00:40:20,928
because they are not represented by robots.

1044
00:40:21,428 --> 00:40:21,588
They're invisible.

1045
00:40:21,588 --> 00:40:25,608
And he sings an entire song about the lore of how he met the space angels

1046
00:40:25,988 --> 00:40:27,688
and reestablishes that they are invisible.

1047
00:40:27,688 --> 00:40:29,988
And that's why there aren't any more animatronics.

1048
00:40:29,988 --> 00:40:31,808
It's not because they didn't want to build more.

1049
00:40:31,988 --> 00:40:35,168
It's because the space angels are invisible because they're from space

1050
00:40:35,168 --> 00:40:36,968
and they're angels and they sing backup.

1051
00:40:37,028 --> 00:40:37,708
Yes.

1052
00:40:37,908 --> 00:40:40,148
And one day he was at a show playing by himself

1053
00:40:40,148 --> 00:40:44,968
and he heard the voices of the space angels and they've been with him ever since.

1054
00:40:45,268 --> 00:40:46,128
What a delight.

1055
00:40:46,388 --> 00:40:47,528
One of them is his wife.

1056
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:49,668
And Hello Space Angels is my favorite.

1057
00:40:49,728 --> 00:40:50,568
I'll put that out there.

1058
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:51,608
That's a great song.

1059
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:54,168
Yeah, that's the yeah, that might be my favorite too.

1060
00:40:54,168 --> 00:40:54,868
The space angels.

1061
00:40:55,188 --> 00:40:56,348
What about his title song, though?

1062
00:40:56,468 --> 00:40:57,788
The Hello All You Earthlings.

1063
00:40:58,068 --> 00:40:59,288
My name is Sonny Eclips.

1064
00:40:59,308 --> 00:40:59,928
That's good too.

1065
00:40:59,928 --> 00:41:01,208
That one's a bop.

1066
00:41:01,448 --> 00:41:02,508
Yeah, that one's good too.

1067
00:41:02,528 --> 00:41:03,428
You can dance to it.

1068
00:41:03,448 --> 00:41:07,888
My number one is Out in Space, which I've also seen referred to as Bossa Supernova.

1069
00:41:08,168 --> 00:41:10,748
At least that's the genre that he says that the song is.

1070
00:41:10,928 --> 00:41:17,268
And I like it because it sounds to me like a sort of a world music attempt

1071
00:41:17,268 --> 00:41:20,648
that Todd Rundgren might have made in the early 90s.

1072
00:41:20,848 --> 00:41:24,908
Like he's really Sonny's playing in 90s Rundgren territory.

1073
00:41:24,908 --> 00:41:26,168
So Scott's in.

1074
00:41:26,388 --> 00:41:31,728
Yeah, I don't like you, Norik, because the lyrical like gymnastics

1075
00:41:31,728 --> 00:41:37,148
give me like secondhand nervous sweats at the idea of him having to get the lyrics right.

1076
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:42,008
It must have been that must have been the sweatiest part of the recording session.

1077
00:41:42,008 --> 00:41:42,748
Oh, I'm sure.

1078
00:41:42,848 --> 00:41:48,248
I always think about the songs in terms of how much Sonny was sweating while he was singing it.

1079
00:41:48,628 --> 00:41:52,388
If yeah, it was a bright little star, probably the least sweaty.

1080
00:41:53,128 --> 00:41:57,868
The more just like kind of bluesy barely changing keys, you're probably good.

1081
00:41:57,868 --> 00:42:00,248
But yeah, there's like there's a lot of lyrics jammed in.

1082
00:42:00,248 --> 00:42:01,528
Let's talk about that.

1083
00:42:01,528 --> 00:42:03,548
It's a lot of tongue twisters as well.

1084
00:42:03,968 --> 00:42:07,988
As we said, Sonny Eclipse is from you, Norik.

1085
00:42:08,148 --> 00:42:10,928
Can you read aloud a portion of the lyrics like a middle verse?

1086
00:42:10,928 --> 00:42:12,108
I have the lyrics in front of me.

1087
00:42:12,108 --> 00:42:12,988
A little lazy.

1088
00:42:13,468 --> 00:42:17,488
What's going on here, you know, city is like an opposite city.

1089
00:42:17,488 --> 00:42:20,368
And you think that it's just a throwaway fact about him.

1090
00:42:20,588 --> 00:42:23,988
But then you get an entire song about where he comes from.

1091
00:42:24,268 --> 00:42:29,008
And let's just say that you Norik City is a topsy turvy place.

1092
00:42:29,668 --> 00:42:30,488
It is.

1093
00:42:30,928 --> 00:42:36,008
It's a little bit of an inside out version of the New York City we know from our plan.

1094
00:42:36,048 --> 00:42:39,968
Or should you say upside down, upside down or downside up?

1095
00:42:40,248 --> 00:42:43,168
Oh, Mike, would you like to treat us?

1096
00:42:43,388 --> 00:42:45,168
Yeah, I mean, I were to begin.

1097
00:42:45,208 --> 00:42:46,408
I guess I'll just start with the first.

1098
00:42:46,408 --> 00:42:50,008
So he says you, Norik, you, Norik is my hometown.

1099
00:42:50,188 --> 00:42:56,648
You, Norik is upside down and every single part of it is underground because up above the surface, there's nothing around.

1100
00:42:57,268 --> 00:43:00,188
When then there's a backup like we're talking about all over town.

1101
00:43:00,408 --> 00:43:02,788
And then, I mean, I'll just keep going, I guess.

1102
00:43:02,888 --> 00:43:04,768
I mean, I could do the middle verses.

1103
00:43:04,788 --> 00:43:07,888
He'll just switch around the opening syllables because it gets dense.

1104
00:43:08,108 --> 00:43:09,068
Yeah, that's true.

1105
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:10,928
I should go like central grand.

1106
00:43:10,928 --> 00:43:15,788
Well, right around when I get interested, especially when he starts talking about sports,

1107
00:43:17,068 --> 00:43:22,568
the Unorc Yanks, if I got that correct, they are who are green and fat and always get beat.

1108
00:43:23,508 --> 00:43:31,548
But it really it gets it goes double speed when he starts talking about how he takes around the town.

1109
00:43:31,908 --> 00:43:32,648
Caxi tabs.

1110
00:43:33,848 --> 00:43:36,228
With a C, Caxi tabs.

1111
00:43:36,468 --> 00:43:36,688
Right.

1112
00:43:36,828 --> 00:43:38,148
It's so stressful.

1113
00:43:39,088 --> 00:43:40,548
You're like bothered by.

1114
00:43:40,828 --> 00:43:46,568
Yeah, by him having to perform this song and get all the wrong lyrics correct.

1115
00:43:47,228 --> 00:43:47,548
Yeah.

1116
00:43:47,548 --> 00:43:48,188
All these fake words.

1117
00:43:48,208 --> 00:43:49,868
Caris Andelin blues scales.

1118
00:43:49,988 --> 00:43:51,668
He's got he's got no problem.

1119
00:43:51,668 --> 00:43:52,148
You're right.

1120
00:43:52,768 --> 00:43:53,908
He's a professional.

1121
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:55,308
He's got a very active mind.

1122
00:43:55,408 --> 00:43:57,368
It was a problem of their own making.

1123
00:43:57,468 --> 00:43:59,248
They didn't have to do this.

1124
00:43:59,728 --> 00:44:03,908
No, he could have just sang about backwards and upside down concepts without jumbling the words.

1125
00:44:04,028 --> 00:44:04,928
Without jumbling the words.

1126
00:44:04,928 --> 00:44:10,668
I like the Borsch Belt jokes, but you know, work does make my skin crawl a little.

1127
00:44:10,668 --> 00:44:11,608
What do you mean?

1128
00:44:11,848 --> 00:44:12,968
From a comedy perspective.

1129
00:44:13,288 --> 00:44:13,968
Oh, my man.

1130
00:44:14,228 --> 00:44:15,428
I like the planet Zork.

1131
00:44:15,428 --> 00:44:16,488
Give us some more phrases.

1132
00:44:16,908 --> 00:44:18,068
We got Caxi tabs.

1133
00:44:18,208 --> 00:44:18,408
Yeah.

1134
00:44:18,488 --> 00:44:23,588
And if you can't hail a Caxi, then you maybe could go down to the way sub station.

1135
00:44:23,588 --> 00:44:25,028
It's all real.

1136
00:44:26,108 --> 00:44:27,848
And you can take that to a number of places.

1137
00:44:27,848 --> 00:44:29,768
You could go to Av Parkinou.

1138
00:44:29,768 --> 00:44:30,668
Oh, God.

1139
00:44:30,688 --> 00:44:31,848
You could go to Harnegy Call.

1140
00:44:31,948 --> 00:44:32,608
No.

1141
00:44:32,608 --> 00:44:36,368
Or maybe you want to check out the Doll War Historia.

1142
00:44:36,708 --> 00:44:36,888
What?

1143
00:44:36,888 --> 00:44:39,408
Wait, I missed a part of something.

1144
00:44:39,548 --> 00:44:40,348
I forget.

1145
00:44:40,588 --> 00:44:44,748
You know where we really need to go is Squaddison Merr Garden.

1146
00:44:44,908 --> 00:44:49,848
Oh, I thought you were going to say we should go to Pyre M. State, which was climbed by

1147
00:44:49,848 --> 00:44:51,308
hairy old Kong King.

1148
00:44:51,608 --> 00:44:52,788
Oh, God.

1149
00:44:53,588 --> 00:44:54,708
It might be good again.

1150
00:44:54,808 --> 00:44:55,908
I might change my mind.

1151
00:44:56,008 --> 00:45:02,108
And maybe, but you also got to go see the Big Green Lady, the Libber of Statutey.

1152
00:45:02,868 --> 00:45:10,148
Oh, I'd like to just I mean, I think from this song, you get a pretty big, you know,

1153
00:45:10,328 --> 00:45:14,108
view of Unark City and all of its culture and all the stuff to do.

1154
00:45:14,188 --> 00:45:15,388
But he did miss a lot.

1155
00:45:15,748 --> 00:45:20,548
I mean, I would like to hear him sing about Min Lanwell Miranda's musical about

1156
00:45:20,548 --> 00:45:22,188
Alexander Hamilton.

1157
00:45:22,228 --> 00:45:22,948
Yeah.

1158
00:45:22,968 --> 00:45:29,288
You know, or like some of the culture, some of the great films made about Unark City.

1159
00:45:29,288 --> 00:45:36,568
I mean, Skartan Mortese made so many great Unark films with Robert Rodero.

1160
00:45:36,608 --> 00:45:42,608
Of course, this great character, Bavis Trickle, who then his famous phrase, you

1161
00:45:42,608 --> 00:45:45,388
mock into T. Are you mocking the T.

1162
00:45:46,748 --> 00:45:54,608
You know, the female filmmaker, Ali Wooden and her movies, Han Matan and Hany

1163
00:45:55,708 --> 00:45:56,348
Hall.

1164
00:45:56,688 --> 00:46:00,168
But, you know, it's also it's been an interesting time in Unark City.

1165
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:06,348
Have you noticed how there are never protests outside of Tump Trower?

1166
00:46:06,888 --> 00:46:13,568
I mean, ever since he went up the escalator, Drondald Tump to announce his candidacy.

1167
00:46:14,208 --> 00:46:15,648
I could keep going.

1168
00:46:15,828 --> 00:46:16,088
Sure.

1169
00:46:16,388 --> 00:46:17,188
Yeah, keep going, please.

1170
00:46:17,188 --> 00:46:18,088
I mean, really.

1171
00:46:18,488 --> 00:46:25,048
But the the main thing is the Unark is in the shadow of the 11 nine that day.

1172
00:46:25,068 --> 00:46:26,568
The one tower.

1173
00:46:26,808 --> 00:46:29,308
No, I'll always forget 11.

1174
00:46:29,868 --> 00:46:35,328
No, I was wondering if he was going to go there.

1175
00:46:35,488 --> 00:46:35,828
Yeah.

1176
00:46:35,968 --> 00:46:38,848
Well, it's Patreon, you know, these are the hard core.

1177
00:46:38,928 --> 00:46:39,528
Yeah, you get a little blue.

1178
00:46:39,668 --> 00:46:41,348
It's like Sony's light show.

1179
00:46:41,368 --> 00:46:43,888
That bastard, Lynn Bodden.

1180
00:46:44,068 --> 00:46:44,788
I will say.

1181
00:46:45,628 --> 00:46:48,268
The quirky alien.

1182
00:46:52,708 --> 00:46:56,988
Since he drove those trains into the single tower.

1183
00:46:58,168 --> 00:47:06,048
I mean, the city is at least under confident leadership with the DILT Babassio.

1184
00:47:07,848 --> 00:47:12,208
I think he's a better mayor than Jude.

1185
00:47:12,208 --> 00:47:16,388
I will say that he's more of a good guy than all frulling on his supportive tump.

1186
00:47:16,788 --> 00:47:19,408
He's very much in a mess.

1187
00:47:22,208 --> 00:47:37,388
Well, and also and let's you know, we also should salute the bravery of Captain Bergen Seller who drove his boat into those dolphins and had to go in for a crash rising.

1188
00:47:38,788 --> 00:47:41,128
Did you say was this an all nighter?

1189
00:47:41,128 --> 00:47:42,968
There's a lot of coffee.

1190
00:47:43,988 --> 00:47:47,048
That's all you've got?

1191
00:47:47,048 --> 00:47:57,068
A couple days grand in and out. I think I'm tapped out. But again, we'll hit this all again in three months and we'll all have more time to remember great stuff about Unark City.

1192
00:47:57,348 --> 00:47:57,668
Of course.

1193
00:47:57,688 --> 00:47:59,868
When we have Cal on the show, obviously.

1194
00:47:59,988 --> 00:48:01,628
Oh, he'll love to hear.

1195
00:48:01,668 --> 00:48:03,708
Yeah, we'll do all of it for him.

1196
00:48:03,708 --> 00:48:04,308
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1197
00:48:04,308 --> 00:48:05,648
He'll do those lines.

1198
00:48:06,568 --> 00:48:07,248
I'll feel.

1199
00:48:07,408 --> 00:48:13,228
Well, we can if we're going to build a set for Cal to bring Sonny back in Palm Springs.

1200
00:48:13,348 --> 00:48:13,708
Right.

1201
00:48:14,008 --> 00:48:16,388
Yeah, we can like expand that.

1202
00:48:16,408 --> 00:48:18,028
I feel like a puppet would be doable.

1203
00:48:18,788 --> 00:48:18,908
Hmm.

1204
00:48:19,068 --> 00:48:19,428
Yeah.

1205
00:48:19,628 --> 00:48:22,588
A Sonny close puppet or gorilla style with a hologram.

1206
00:48:22,648 --> 00:48:22,968
Right.

1207
00:48:23,068 --> 00:48:28,828
Is there a do we have enough listeners in Palm Springs to do a live show?

1208
00:48:28,908 --> 00:48:30,328
I thought it would be just us.

1209
00:48:30,568 --> 00:48:31,008
Oh, okay.

1210
00:48:31,008 --> 00:48:31,368
Fine.

1211
00:48:31,508 --> 00:48:31,708
Sure.

1212
00:48:31,768 --> 00:48:33,568
Just an audience of like four people.

1213
00:48:33,588 --> 00:48:34,448
A private engagement.

1214
00:48:34,448 --> 00:48:38,528
But you do like rent out a venue and you don't make it clear to him that it's not going to

1215
00:48:38,528 --> 00:48:39,668
be like a full crowd.

1216
00:48:40,008 --> 00:48:41,888
But he's just like, whoo, space angel.

1217
00:48:41,968 --> 00:48:44,528
We want to give him the real Sonny Clips experience.

1218
00:48:44,688 --> 00:48:48,608
If he's married to a space angel, he can bring at least one of them and we can put her behind

1219
00:48:48,608 --> 00:48:49,508
a scrim.

1220
00:48:49,648 --> 00:48:50,188
Mm-hmm.

1221
00:48:50,328 --> 00:48:51,508
Yeah, she's still invisible.

1222
00:48:51,588 --> 00:48:52,168
Yeah, she has to be invisible.

1223
00:48:52,228 --> 00:48:54,708
She will not have her day in the sun.

1224
00:48:55,428 --> 00:48:57,248
She cannot be seen because she's a space angel.

1225
00:48:57,408 --> 00:48:59,748
All of his live shows are listed as him and his wife.

1226
00:49:00,088 --> 00:49:00,668
Oh.

1227
00:49:01,268 --> 00:49:01,368
Great.

1228
00:49:01,368 --> 00:49:02,828
So they're still performing together.

1229
00:49:02,828 --> 00:49:03,408
Where are they playing next?

1230
00:49:03,408 --> 00:49:03,948
Where and when?

1231
00:49:04,108 --> 00:49:05,128
In Indian Wells.

1232
00:49:05,268 --> 00:49:05,788
But when?

1233
00:49:06,068 --> 00:49:06,988
Like soon.

1234
00:49:07,408 --> 00:49:08,448
Like next weekend?

1235
00:49:08,908 --> 00:49:09,828
Yeah, like that.

1236
00:49:09,868 --> 00:49:10,108
Hold on.

1237
00:49:10,128 --> 00:49:10,628
Let me find that date.

1238
00:49:10,648 --> 00:49:11,608
They play often.

1239
00:49:12,148 --> 00:49:12,408
Yes.

1240
00:49:12,408 --> 00:49:13,848
Can we make requests?

1241
00:49:14,068 --> 00:49:15,488
They're playing in three days.

1242
00:49:15,708 --> 00:49:22,228
They're playing March 2nd, March 9th, March 16th, March 23rd, March 30th, April 6th.

1243
00:49:22,228 --> 00:49:23,108
They have a residency.

1244
00:49:23,108 --> 00:49:27,708
They just have a residency at Vickies of Santa Fe in Indian Wells, California.

1245
00:49:27,948 --> 00:49:28,628
Oh, my God.

1246
00:49:28,628 --> 00:49:29,408
I have to go.

1247
00:49:29,408 --> 00:49:33,888
So if you're just a Disney nerd in Palm Springs and you haven't gone to see.

1248
00:49:34,268 --> 00:49:34,408
Sure.

1249
00:49:34,408 --> 00:49:34,988
It's all.

1250
00:49:35,168 --> 00:49:36,048
And maybe do the.

1251
00:49:36,268 --> 00:49:38,828
I mean, if we don't book him, we could pick a night that we're all going to go.

1252
00:49:38,908 --> 00:49:43,768
Like all the Diz fans in the area commute over to sunny Eclipse town.

1253
00:49:43,808 --> 00:49:51,488
I honestly think to like, if you could arrange that, all you've got to do is relearn one of these songs.

1254
00:49:51,488 --> 00:49:55,568
We can get like those I Heart NY shirts, but they say I Heart YN.

1255
00:49:55,568 --> 00:49:56,648
Oh, my God.

1256
00:49:58,428 --> 00:50:00,088
But it's an upside down.

1257
00:50:00,248 --> 00:50:02,468
Yeah, I upside down heart.

1258
00:50:02,848 --> 00:50:02,868
Why?

1259
00:50:03,148 --> 00:50:05,068
And yeah, I mean, that's fantastic.

1260
00:50:05,288 --> 00:50:08,528
Reminiscent of the kind of thing that Lon Jemmell would wear.

1261
00:50:10,548 --> 00:50:16,008
And then the back is like a tour list of all the different cities he plays at.

1262
00:50:16,108 --> 00:50:16,408
Sure.

1263
00:50:16,648 --> 00:50:17,788
Oh, wow. Yeah.

1264
00:50:18,148 --> 00:50:19,488
Ass, longelus.

1265
00:50:19,588 --> 00:50:21,408
Zebulon Nebula or whatever.

1266
00:50:21,628 --> 00:50:22,228
Oh, I see.

1267
00:50:22,328 --> 00:50:22,548
OK.

1268
00:50:22,788 --> 00:50:23,588
It's not all backwards.

1269
00:50:23,808 --> 00:50:24,848
Yeah, or it could be.

1270
00:50:24,888 --> 00:50:25,668
Yeah, it could be.

1271
00:50:25,668 --> 00:50:26,288
It's a mix.

1272
00:50:26,968 --> 00:50:29,308
Some are outer space and some are.

1273
00:50:29,368 --> 00:50:31,208
Yeah, off Langelis is definitely.

1274
00:50:31,848 --> 00:50:32,708
Did anyone read?

1275
00:50:32,728 --> 00:50:38,848
Did anyone read about his son eclipse's cousin and where he's from?

1276
00:50:39,188 --> 00:50:41,028
Oh, the Japanese one.

1277
00:50:41,308 --> 00:50:41,968
Officer Six.

1278
00:50:42,248 --> 00:50:42,688
Yes.

1279
00:50:42,928 --> 00:50:44,328
The one that works TSA.

1280
00:50:44,908 --> 00:50:47,388
So yeah, in case you that's actually the first one.

1281
00:50:47,648 --> 00:50:51,068
The Star Wars episode, Star Wars episode a while back.

1282
00:50:51,168 --> 00:50:51,888
Oh, yeah.

1283
00:50:51,908 --> 00:50:53,208
He existed before Sonny.

1284
00:50:53,348 --> 00:50:53,808
So, so.

1285
00:50:53,968 --> 00:50:54,288
Wait, really?

1286
00:50:54,288 --> 00:50:54,628
Yeah.

1287
00:50:54,768 --> 00:50:55,448
So we had an interview.

1288
00:50:55,528 --> 00:50:59,608
Cal David said they showed me what Sonny would look like, but they were showing me he knew

1289
00:50:59,608 --> 00:51:00,908
he was like it's from Tokyo.

1290
00:51:00,908 --> 00:51:02,628
It's the flesh colored one.

1291
00:51:02,668 --> 00:51:02,888
Yeah.

1292
00:51:02,928 --> 00:51:05,988
So he goes and then they showed me like a mock up of what he would look like with the

1293
00:51:05,988 --> 00:51:07,368
hair and the jacket and stuff.

1294
00:51:07,668 --> 00:51:11,668
This is a drawing from the one of the imaginary coffee table books.

1295
00:51:11,868 --> 00:51:12,488
Oh, that's right.

1296
00:51:12,668 --> 00:51:13,268
Yeah.

1297
00:51:13,268 --> 00:51:14,928
You can see his full body.

1298
00:51:15,088 --> 00:51:16,908
It's a little unnerving to see all of him.

1299
00:51:16,968 --> 00:51:17,968
Pink sparkly jacket.

1300
00:51:17,968 --> 00:51:18,468
Is he wearing pants?

1301
00:51:18,848 --> 00:51:19,108
Yeah.

1302
00:51:19,168 --> 00:51:19,428
Oh, yeah.

1303
00:51:19,448 --> 00:51:22,048
He's got white sparkly pants on.

1304
00:51:22,168 --> 00:51:23,388
And Cal David knew.

1305
00:51:23,528 --> 00:51:24,428
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1306
00:51:24,648 --> 00:51:27,488
Cal David knew the name Captain Zzix.

1307
00:51:27,808 --> 00:51:28,068
What?

1308
00:51:28,488 --> 00:51:28,588
Wow.

1309
00:51:28,588 --> 00:51:29,728
He says he goes, I think it was.

1310
00:51:29,728 --> 00:51:30,908
Oh, he's so much more in than me.

1311
00:51:30,908 --> 00:51:31,128
Right.

1312
00:51:31,208 --> 00:51:33,388
He goes, I think it was, even though he's never seen it, he's like, I think it's.

1313
00:51:33,388 --> 00:51:35,288
I think he's being coy about not seeing Sonny.

1314
00:51:35,428 --> 00:51:36,628
I think he's been a lot.

1315
00:51:36,868 --> 00:51:38,188
I think he's been there a lot.

1316
00:51:38,688 --> 00:51:39,288
Officer Zzix.

1317
00:51:39,508 --> 00:51:39,588
Excuse me.

1318
00:51:39,588 --> 00:51:40,108
Oh, excuse me.

1319
00:51:40,108 --> 00:51:40,388
Yeah, yeah.

1320
00:51:40,388 --> 00:51:40,668
Sorry.

1321
00:51:40,668 --> 00:51:41,008
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1322
00:51:41,028 --> 00:51:44,608
He sounds way too invested for someone that didn't bother to go see the show.

1323
00:51:45,008 --> 00:51:46,008
Somebody wrote Cal.

1324
00:51:46,088 --> 00:51:46,808
I copied this.

1325
00:51:46,828 --> 00:51:47,748
Hey, Jenny Nicholson.

1326
00:51:47,908 --> 00:51:50,048
Thanks for putting me number one on your list.

1327
00:51:50,048 --> 00:51:51,448
Yeah, yeah.

1328
00:51:51,448 --> 00:51:53,028
He mentions it in the podcast.

1329
00:51:54,708 --> 00:52:00,728
Officer Zzix was the, if you didn't hear this in a previous episode, when you left, no longer

1330
00:52:00,728 --> 00:52:02,308
there, but when you left Star Tours.

1331
00:52:02,328 --> 00:52:03,168
I don't believe he's there anymore.

1332
00:52:03,208 --> 00:52:03,628
Is he there?

1333
00:52:03,628 --> 00:52:04,788
I don't think he is.

1334
00:52:05,328 --> 00:52:06,068
Wait, now I'm turning.

1335
00:52:06,148 --> 00:52:06,768
We were just there.

1336
00:52:06,768 --> 00:52:08,628
Yeah, you would have freaked out if he's not.

1337
00:52:08,628 --> 00:52:09,968
I guess I didn't see him.

1338
00:52:10,168 --> 00:52:10,328
No.

1339
00:52:10,328 --> 00:52:15,888
When you left Star Tours, the Tokyo version, there'd be a guy checking you out, like the

1340
00:52:15,908 --> 00:52:20,808
passport guy, and he looked exactly like our favorite alien, Sunny Eclipse.

1341
00:52:20,848 --> 00:52:21,268
It was the same mold and everything.

1342
00:52:21,268 --> 00:52:24,608
Yeah, he was either customs or like lost baggage counter or something.

1343
00:52:24,628 --> 00:52:29,408
Yeah, he's got like a bank of monitors behind him, and that seems like some of the delight

1344
00:52:29,408 --> 00:52:34,188
of Tokyo, and some of what they brought to Tomorrowland 94 was these oddball characters,

1345
00:52:34,648 --> 00:52:38,648
like the chef in the Pan Galactic pizza board.

1346
00:52:38,648 --> 00:52:40,688
Yes, they have a full show in there.

1347
00:52:41,108 --> 00:52:41,588
Oh, that's right.

1348
00:52:41,608 --> 00:52:43,228
It's a Sunny Eclipse, but on steroids.

1349
00:52:43,248 --> 00:52:44,268
It has a whole set.

1350
00:52:44,288 --> 00:52:44,848
Yeah.

1351
00:52:45,048 --> 00:52:45,928
It moves around.

1352
00:52:46,208 --> 00:52:46,828
It interacts.

1353
00:52:47,068 --> 00:52:48,068
I'm six weeks away.

1354
00:52:48,068 --> 00:52:48,588
I'm so close.

1355
00:52:48,588 --> 00:52:48,908
It has a whole pizza.

1356
00:52:49,028 --> 00:52:49,468
I'm going.

1357
00:52:49,568 --> 00:52:50,228
You're going in six weeks.

1358
00:52:50,588 --> 00:52:53,288
I don't have any immediate plans to go, but I want to go real bad.

1359
00:52:53,448 --> 00:52:55,248
I'm so, so excited.

1360
00:52:55,448 --> 00:53:00,488
And that's the kind of, that's where I do need to build the time in, because I'm going to

1361
00:53:00,488 --> 00:53:03,408
want to watch the whole loop of this pizza show.

1362
00:53:03,408 --> 00:53:04,828
Yeah, you're going to need a lot of Japanese pizza.

1363
00:53:05,068 --> 00:53:10,268
I had one pizza the one time I went to Japan, and it was like, it was not good pizza.

1364
00:53:10,348 --> 00:53:12,108
They put corn on it.

1365
00:53:12,288 --> 00:53:13,408
Corn and shrimp.

1366
00:53:13,408 --> 00:53:17,508
It was like sweet tomato sauce and corn, but it wasn't like a corn pizza.

1367
00:53:17,548 --> 00:53:20,348
It was like, it's a pizza, a normal pizza.

1368
00:53:20,388 --> 00:53:22,508
And then you got it and there was corn on it.

1369
00:53:22,528 --> 00:53:24,168
They just think that's normal.

1370
00:53:24,188 --> 00:53:27,708
I studied abroad in Germany and at one point the school ordered pizza.

1371
00:53:27,908 --> 00:53:28,728
Oh, hooray pizza.

1372
00:53:28,868 --> 00:53:29,728
The pizza came out.

1373
00:53:29,888 --> 00:53:32,688
The pizza had tuna on it.

1374
00:53:32,948 --> 00:53:35,028
Just like canned tuna on it.

1375
00:53:35,308 --> 00:53:37,188
See, corn was like, I'm for it.

1376
00:53:37,268 --> 00:53:38,348
Eating tuna pizza.

1377
00:53:38,348 --> 00:53:40,248
In New York City.

1378
00:53:40,388 --> 00:53:42,748
She made New York because it's upside down.

1379
00:53:42,748 --> 00:53:46,828
Yeah, that kind of shit might fly in New York City, but not here in Earth.

1380
00:53:46,828 --> 00:53:48,728
That's some kind of upside down world pizza.

1381
00:53:49,168 --> 00:53:51,788
It was also on Sunset Boulevard at Bossa Nova.

1382
00:53:52,348 --> 00:53:53,768
Restaurant Bossa Nova.

1383
00:53:54,428 --> 00:53:54,948
I've had that.

1384
00:53:55,548 --> 00:53:55,668
Anyway.

1385
00:53:56,628 --> 00:54:00,368
But there's a blog that calls him Captain Zizik as well.

1386
00:54:00,508 --> 00:54:07,608
But this claims, and I don't know, I haven't seen this anywhere else, that Captain Zizik's or whatever is from Juneurzy.

1387
00:54:08,608 --> 00:54:08,948
What?

1388
00:54:08,968 --> 00:54:10,188
Across the ridge.

1389
00:54:10,188 --> 00:54:10,868
Is that real?

1390
00:54:11,728 --> 00:54:13,948
What is the site that you're on though?

1391
00:54:14,148 --> 00:54:16,648
It's a Disney blog, Disney hipster blog.

1392
00:54:16,768 --> 00:54:18,628
I don't know if it's goofing on it or not.

1393
00:54:18,688 --> 00:54:22,048
It must be goofing on it because that doesn't sound like an okay phrase.

1394
00:54:22,688 --> 00:54:24,308
Like is Juneurzy, yes.

1395
00:54:24,308 --> 00:54:25,248
Yeah, a little bit.

1396
00:54:25,828 --> 00:54:34,608
I think that, because I found some Officer Zizik's info that I don't think was trustworthy because I think it was on some sort of like fan canon site.

1397
00:54:35,048 --> 00:54:38,548
So that's what I'm more, I'm skeptical of Zizik's info.

1398
00:54:38,548 --> 00:54:40,388
There is little Zizik's info.

1399
00:54:40,648 --> 00:54:43,628
So everything else I've said, I'm very confident in this podcast.

1400
00:54:43,668 --> 00:54:47,028
But yes, that one, I agree that source is maybe not the most reputable.

1401
00:54:47,148 --> 00:54:48,328
But I will look into it.

1402
00:54:48,328 --> 00:54:54,928
And when we do the next episode about Sunny Eclipse or the Officer Zizik's episode, I will have more hard facts.

1403
00:54:55,268 --> 00:55:00,148
In terms of reputable, do you have to call out one of the songs in the lineup?

1404
00:55:00,168 --> 00:55:04,408
I am of course talking about Starlight Soup and Salad.

1405
00:55:04,408 --> 00:55:10,728
It does not appear that for a long time, if ever, soup and salad have been a feature.

1406
00:55:11,108 --> 00:55:16,188
Perhaps a salad bar or a side salad, an anemic one that comes with it.

1407
00:55:16,328 --> 00:55:18,588
Definitely never soup. I don't buy that for a moment.

1408
00:55:18,728 --> 00:55:20,548
No, I don't know that they got full menu.

1409
00:55:20,568 --> 00:55:23,088
They just don't seem like a place that would have an infrastructure for soup.

1410
00:55:23,528 --> 00:55:29,168
No, this sounds more like a diner or like a sit down, like a place where you're ordering a platter.

1411
00:55:29,168 --> 00:55:33,968
It's some kind of bougie fantasy, Sunny Eclipse, where they can serve salad and soup.

1412
00:55:34,788 --> 00:55:36,528
But Janie, I do have good news for you.

1413
00:55:36,528 --> 00:55:36,888
Oh, good.

1414
00:55:37,908 --> 00:55:40,488
It appears I do not see the falafel burger.

1415
00:55:40,708 --> 00:55:44,108
I do see something called a plant based sloppy joe.

1416
00:55:44,168 --> 00:55:45,308
That sounds worse.

1417
00:55:45,728 --> 00:55:47,768
Yeah, that's potentially dicey.

1418
00:55:48,068 --> 00:55:50,328
The falafel burger is like lacking flavor.

1419
00:55:50,708 --> 00:55:55,048
A plant based sloppy joe sounds like something that goes for flavor and the result isn't good.

1420
00:55:55,548 --> 00:56:00,888
I don't I know it's real hit and miss with plant based or fake beef or a plant based beef crumbles,

1421
00:56:00,948 --> 00:56:05,828
tossed in sloppy joe sauce of diced onions, yellow mustard, ketchup, garlic and brown sugar.

1422
00:56:05,828 --> 00:56:07,468
All the things I've like yearned to eat.

1423
00:56:07,488 --> 00:56:09,188
Fuck you. That's an awful phrase.

1424
00:56:09,488 --> 00:56:14,168
Yeah, no, like every time I've thought about like meat based foods like, oh, I'd like to eat that.

1425
00:56:14,228 --> 00:56:15,988
Sloppy Joe has never made the list.

1426
00:56:16,208 --> 00:56:18,608
But what if I were to tell you it came with fries?

1427
00:56:19,308 --> 00:56:20,568
I mean, it's pretty good.

1428
00:56:20,608 --> 00:56:21,448
Pretty good.

1429
00:56:22,508 --> 00:56:29,228
They should bump it up to onion rings if I'm suffering a vegetarian sloppy joe.

1430
00:56:29,408 --> 00:56:29,808
Fair, fair.

1431
00:56:29,868 --> 00:56:30,828
Three sides minimum.

1432
00:56:30,828 --> 00:56:33,108
Just give me some flatbreads, you guys.

1433
00:56:34,608 --> 00:56:36,828
Any other we're kind of going song by song a little.

1434
00:56:37,008 --> 00:56:39,948
Any other songs that with the song you were the most fond of?

1435
00:56:40,608 --> 00:56:43,728
Great little star, a lovely little love song about the space angel.

1436
00:56:43,748 --> 00:56:45,588
That's really nice. That's wonderful.

1437
00:56:46,828 --> 00:56:48,368
I did I write it down?

1438
00:56:48,648 --> 00:56:52,608
My top or bossa nova and you know, you're not so fun.

1439
00:56:52,608 --> 00:56:58,428
There's a wait. Is this in the soup and salad one?

1440
00:56:58,428 --> 00:56:59,488
I just wrote down the lyrics.

1441
00:56:59,668 --> 00:57:06,388
The menu is from outer space, including the fries that might be the one that's just about cosmic rays.

1442
00:57:06,388 --> 00:57:10,328
Yeah, I think that's like try the burgers and stuff.

1443
00:57:10,328 --> 00:57:15,568
And there's a line about cosmic chicken meat, which is almost as unappetizing.

1444
00:57:15,628 --> 00:57:17,968
As plant based beef crumbles.

1445
00:57:18,288 --> 00:57:19,848
Actually, yeah, plant based beef crumbles.

1446
00:57:20,268 --> 00:57:24,528
I'm kind of sold on it now because it sounds like something from a future like a grim future.

1447
00:57:24,528 --> 00:57:25,108
It does.

1448
00:57:25,268 --> 00:57:28,848
Where they're like eat your protein capsules and your plant based beef crumbles.

1449
00:57:29,468 --> 00:57:30,488
The world of food pellets.

1450
00:57:30,488 --> 00:57:31,668
The future is now.

1451
00:57:32,268 --> 00:57:33,148
It's in Soylent Green.

1452
00:57:33,168 --> 00:57:34,128
That is Tomorrowland.

1453
00:57:34,288 --> 00:57:37,208
Yeah, we talked about the Beyond Burger and Impossible Burgers.

1454
00:57:37,268 --> 00:57:38,708
Both been pretty good recently.

1455
00:57:38,908 --> 00:57:40,308
So I don't know. Maybe it's one of those.

1456
00:57:40,308 --> 00:57:41,588
I'll give the beef crumbles a go.

1457
00:57:41,688 --> 00:57:42,568
Give it a try.

1458
00:57:42,568 --> 00:57:44,848
What do you think a Yorkian tastes like?

1459
00:57:45,368 --> 00:57:47,328
If you were to take a...

1460
00:57:47,328 --> 00:57:51,988
We shouldn't be killing anybody of sunny species, but...

1461
00:57:51,988 --> 00:57:55,608
If we did, do you think sunny is delicious or zizzics?

1462
00:57:55,928 --> 00:57:58,088
Probably like a really gamey sausage.

1463
00:57:59,148 --> 00:58:00,788
I think honestly rubbery.

1464
00:58:01,208 --> 00:58:03,008
That's the best answer I could come up with.

1465
00:58:03,688 --> 00:58:07,308
Best case scenario, a mediocre hot dog.

1466
00:58:08,368 --> 00:58:10,108
And even to Jason, that's not bad.

1467
00:58:13,148 --> 00:58:13,728
I don't...

1468
00:58:13,728 --> 00:58:15,048
Yeah, like that was...

1469
00:58:15,048 --> 00:58:18,628
When we did the live show, I kind of forgot to eat right beforehand.

1470
00:58:18,708 --> 00:58:21,668
I realized there was a hot dog cart right outside.

1471
00:58:21,728 --> 00:58:25,708
When we did the That's From Disneyland thing, there was a hot dog guy outside the Marshalls.

1472
00:58:25,728 --> 00:58:27,628
Oh, you did a show at That's From Disneyland? That's fun.

1473
00:58:27,748 --> 00:58:29,088
Yeah, that's what we did at the Tony Wexler show.

1474
00:58:29,088 --> 00:58:31,808
Did you frolic around first and like touch things?

1475
00:58:31,928 --> 00:58:33,608
We went through it a couple of times.

1476
00:58:34,008 --> 00:58:34,428
Yeah, yeah.

1477
00:58:34,928 --> 00:58:37,548
I only went out there once, but it was a great exhibit.

1478
00:58:37,708 --> 00:58:39,568
That was very, very well done.

1479
00:58:39,868 --> 00:58:40,828
Yeah, yeah.

1480
00:58:42,008 --> 00:58:43,928
The hot dog left a bit to be desired.

1481
00:58:44,348 --> 00:58:46,088
I'm surprised there was a hot dog cart near it.

1482
00:58:46,328 --> 00:58:49,248
It was like an abandoned mattress store or something.

1483
00:58:49,408 --> 00:58:50,328
Or sports authority.

1484
00:58:50,708 --> 00:58:51,528
Yeah, sports authority.

1485
00:58:52,128 --> 00:58:54,888
A Petco and like a Marshalls or a Ross.

1486
00:58:55,048 --> 00:58:57,488
Not a logical place to park a hot dog cart.

1487
00:58:57,488 --> 00:59:02,568
Not a logical place, but also I was not the only one getting a hot dog from that cart.

1488
00:59:02,568 --> 00:59:04,588
Okay, maybe they just went there on show nights.

1489
00:59:04,768 --> 00:59:07,408
There is a mall food court half a block away.

1490
00:59:07,408 --> 00:59:08,968
So that was the other thing.

1491
00:59:09,748 --> 00:59:12,328
Tony Baxter not in the hot dog line.

1492
00:59:12,768 --> 00:59:14,708
He went to Bob's Big Boy after the show.

1493
00:59:14,708 --> 00:59:16,428
He did go to Bob's Big Boy after the show.

1494
00:59:16,468 --> 00:59:17,868
Did you guys go with him?

1495
00:59:18,368 --> 00:59:19,268
We did not.

1496
00:59:19,488 --> 00:59:20,488
Why not?

1497
00:59:21,168 --> 00:59:23,308
We're not sure, honestly.

1498
00:59:24,328 --> 00:59:26,688
We expected that we would be best friends.

1499
00:59:27,328 --> 00:59:29,868
You just spent two hours talking to us.

1500
00:59:29,888 --> 00:59:32,008
You aren't going to immediately take us to a restaurant.

1501
00:59:32,008 --> 00:59:32,408
That's the fantasy.

1502
00:59:32,408 --> 00:59:34,648
I mean, if you already know where you're going, you'd think you'd go.

1503
00:59:34,648 --> 00:59:36,828
Anyone for Big Boy burgers?

1504
00:59:36,848 --> 00:59:38,168
Maybe he's seeing friends.

1505
00:59:38,268 --> 00:59:39,188
He was with friends.

1506
00:59:39,188 --> 00:59:39,928
He was with friends.

1507
00:59:39,928 --> 00:59:40,808
He was with a group of friends.

1508
00:59:41,148 --> 00:59:41,708
Okay, then that's weird.

1509
00:59:41,848 --> 00:59:46,208
The Van Eten Gallery heavies were trying to get us out of there so quickly.

1510
00:59:46,708 --> 00:59:46,908
Yeah.

1511
00:59:47,508 --> 00:59:49,648
So next time we'll go with them.

1512
00:59:49,848 --> 00:59:51,648
Did you guys get anything from the auction?

1513
00:59:52,328 --> 00:59:53,868
It was a little too...

1514
00:59:53,868 --> 00:59:55,728
I didn't even look at what stuff sold for.

1515
00:59:55,788 --> 00:59:56,748
I was afraid to.

1516
00:59:56,768 --> 00:59:57,468
Yeah.

1517
00:59:57,488 --> 00:59:58,908
Who got the sea monster?

1518
00:59:59,448 --> 01:00:00,828
See, that's what I understand.

1519
01:00:00,908 --> 01:00:04,288
These things go up for sale and then you don't find out who got them.

1520
01:00:04,288 --> 01:00:07,928
As if anyone would buy that and not immediately post on social media about it.

1521
01:00:07,968 --> 01:00:08,808
We've seen some.

1522
01:00:09,848 --> 01:00:11,288
Did Stamos clean up everything?

1523
01:00:11,448 --> 01:00:12,048
Yeah, probably.

1524
01:00:13,548 --> 01:00:14,708
Yes, friggin' Stamos.

1525
01:00:14,848 --> 01:00:15,548
Friggin' Stamos.

1526
01:00:16,968 --> 01:00:21,848
The D, the big D from the Disneyland Hotel went to David Copperfield.

1527
01:00:22,148 --> 01:00:23,768
That's the level of rich they had to be.

1528
01:00:23,768 --> 01:00:24,688
That's fine.

1529
01:00:24,788 --> 01:00:31,068
And then the other one, Chris Jenner bought several Small World dolls.

1530
01:00:31,288 --> 01:00:34,228
I wouldn't have suspected Chris Jenner would be interested in that.

1531
01:00:34,368 --> 01:00:35,108
Well, the daughter.

1532
01:00:35,268 --> 01:00:36,288
I forget which one.

1533
01:00:36,448 --> 01:00:37,988
They're going to put it in a nursery or something?

1534
01:00:37,988 --> 01:00:40,448
Well, she Instagrammed the two of them.

1535
01:00:41,508 --> 01:00:51,228
An early case of a Kardashian with creepy music things operating without being acknowledged in a palatial home.

1536
01:00:51,228 --> 01:00:55,008
I feel like at least the theme park stuff, you can't even be salty about it.

1537
01:00:55,028 --> 01:00:59,248
Because even if it's someone you wouldn't assume would be interested in it, you just have to be like,

1538
01:00:59,248 --> 01:01:02,948
Well, I guess they are interested in it if they bought it because I'm sure it wasn't cheap.

1539
01:01:03,408 --> 01:01:04,488
I can't imagine.

1540
01:01:04,488 --> 01:01:05,128
I guess they must love Small World, so it's kind of charming.

1541
01:01:05,128 --> 01:01:08,508
If you needed Jenner and Copperfield money.

1542
01:01:08,948 --> 01:01:09,888
I know.

1543
01:01:10,168 --> 01:01:10,888
That's rough.

1544
01:01:11,248 --> 01:01:17,788
And to imagine, when they were first sold, I think the Sea Monster sold in its prior auction by Disney for $4,000.

1545
01:01:18,468 --> 01:01:18,928
Wow.

1546
01:01:19,088 --> 01:01:25,288
I know that someone bought the shark fighting the octopus and the two lobsters for $2,000 for both of them.

1547
01:01:25,388 --> 01:01:25,908
Geez.

1548
01:01:25,908 --> 01:01:29,208
And it was literally just a D23 auction that not a lot of people attended.

1549
01:01:29,448 --> 01:01:32,528
And it wasn't really a thing yet to collect theme park memorabilia.

1550
01:01:32,608 --> 01:01:34,068
So everything sold for pretty low.

1551
01:01:34,248 --> 01:01:36,428
Well, those guys, the crafts, I think were not.

1552
01:01:36,528 --> 01:01:37,288
I'm sure it was always expensive.

1553
01:01:37,288 --> 01:01:40,128
The crafts are extremely wealthy, which is probably why he got all of it.

1554
01:01:40,168 --> 01:01:43,368
You're making me think how much I would like to own the Astro Organ.

1555
01:01:43,728 --> 01:01:45,148
Sunny Eclipse, the Astro Organ.

1556
01:01:46,088 --> 01:01:47,628
Oh, would it come with Sunny though?

1557
01:01:49,308 --> 01:01:51,668
So you're saying you hope they decommission Sunny.

1558
01:01:52,648 --> 01:01:53,668
And so you can buy the organ?

1559
01:01:53,668 --> 01:01:56,148
Well, I don't want to wish that reality.

1560
01:01:56,188 --> 01:02:01,788
If I could buy any object from Disneyland, it would be the Curly Lamp in Toontown.

1561
01:02:02,468 --> 01:02:03,228
Oh, nice.

1562
01:02:03,228 --> 01:02:03,768
I would love that.

1563
01:02:03,768 --> 01:02:04,868
Oh, yeah, that is a good one.

1564
01:02:04,968 --> 01:02:07,568
Yeah, I used to always take my picture with it every visit.

1565
01:02:07,628 --> 01:02:09,808
And now that I live locally, it seems a bit weird.

1566
01:02:09,928 --> 01:02:12,788
So I don't think I have in a while, but I should catch up.

1567
01:02:12,948 --> 01:02:13,948
Yeah, that's good.

1568
01:02:13,988 --> 01:02:15,488
I'm trying to think what have I said?

1569
01:02:15,608 --> 01:02:21,388
I wanted that country bear sign from the auction, but obviously that went for so much money.

1570
01:02:21,528 --> 01:02:29,348
It's a small thing, but I would like in the Star Tours line, the frame that you pass through that's lit up and then the slats.

1571
01:02:29,688 --> 01:02:37,668
If I could just get one of those that's in one of the doorways in my home, I feel like I'm passing through a Star Tours call.

1572
01:02:37,688 --> 01:02:38,528
Yeah, that's good.

1573
01:02:40,188 --> 01:02:41,008
Let me see here.

1574
01:02:41,188 --> 01:02:44,088
And Jason's would be a mediocre hot dog.

1575
01:02:44,208 --> 01:02:48,628
Yeah, just for the sake of clarity, I would give the hot dog cart another shot.

1576
01:02:48,628 --> 01:02:50,728
I don't want to talk about too much.

1577
01:02:50,988 --> 01:02:52,808
I'm working hard.

1578
01:02:54,208 --> 01:03:00,708
Real quick, I for more David information, not his only appearance in the theme park.

1579
01:03:00,728 --> 01:03:01,668
Oh, you're kidding.

1580
01:03:01,848 --> 01:03:07,948
He did in Epcot Center, a little thing called Goofy About Health.

1581
01:03:08,408 --> 01:03:11,448
Oh, I've heard that from the Wonders of Life pavilion.

1582
01:03:11,448 --> 01:03:12,088
Wonders of Life.

1583
01:03:12,328 --> 01:03:15,688
And he does like a blues song, which we'll post a link to.

1584
01:03:15,728 --> 01:03:16,548
I won't play it right now.

1585
01:03:16,548 --> 01:03:21,288
He does a blues song about health and he tells a very he's very amused by the story.

1586
01:03:21,288 --> 01:03:26,788
He tells it on that interview about how I think George Wilkins was working on it with him.

1587
01:03:26,988 --> 01:03:31,108
And he has to say like he has to warn you about like smoking and stuff.

1588
01:03:31,328 --> 01:03:39,828
And then George Wilkins was like, when you sing cancer, really smile, really add, making him a lot happier.

1589
01:03:39,988 --> 01:03:44,768
And he's like, he was so delighted by the weirdness by that direction.

1590
01:03:44,768 --> 01:03:45,268
Wow.

1591
01:03:45,308 --> 01:03:46,468
So that's not. Yeah.

1592
01:03:46,548 --> 01:03:50,908
So he was he doesn't realize he was really into these jobs.

1593
01:03:51,208 --> 01:03:51,648
He see. Yeah.

1594
01:03:51,648 --> 01:03:53,268
He does seem like he was like, I was a funny.

1595
01:03:53,368 --> 01:03:56,888
I think he says it. He was like, it was so fun working with George and it was a fun.

1596
01:03:56,988 --> 01:03:59,908
I wonder if everybody lies when they say that, honestly.

1597
01:03:59,928 --> 01:04:00,488
I don't know.

1598
01:04:00,728 --> 01:04:03,368
People love to just be like, oh, it was a long time ago.

1599
01:04:03,408 --> 01:04:05,508
I don't even remember what it what it was like.

1600
01:04:05,528 --> 01:04:06,448
And it's like, really?

1601
01:04:06,628 --> 01:04:11,048
Or are you just like, I feel like people say that when they think the work is like beneath them.

1602
01:04:11,168 --> 01:04:11,488
Yes.

1603
01:04:11,508 --> 01:04:12,588
And they want to like play it cool.

1604
01:04:12,588 --> 01:04:14,248
Or they're like, oh, it's just a session singer.

1605
01:04:14,688 --> 01:04:16,908
But like with him, it seems like he's just like, yeah, it was really fun.

1606
01:04:16,988 --> 01:04:21,688
I remember all of it because I spent days working on it and it was a cool opportunity.

1607
01:04:21,828 --> 01:04:26,708
Well, the fact that it's this long, that it's this half hour program and you can't just like.

1608
01:04:26,728 --> 01:04:27,588
It's a long session.

1609
01:04:27,608 --> 01:04:29,468
I don't think he could have just banged it out.

1610
01:04:29,788 --> 01:04:30,648
Yeah. Like you said, musical dexterity.

1611
01:04:30,648 --> 01:04:34,108
It's probably a day per song, even though it is a session thing or singing thing.

1612
01:04:34,188 --> 01:04:34,308
Yeah.

1613
01:04:34,308 --> 01:04:36,008
I think it probably took a little search time.

1614
01:04:36,268 --> 01:04:36,888
It is. It does.

1615
01:04:37,008 --> 01:04:42,288
I was thinking he was going to be like cranky about it, but he's obviously he agreed to do the Tiara talk show.

1616
01:04:42,368 --> 01:04:42,808
Yeah.

1617
01:04:42,948 --> 01:04:44,768
He had to have some idea that the interview.

1618
01:04:44,928 --> 01:04:45,768
He was waiting to talk about it.

1619
01:04:45,768 --> 01:04:45,948
Yeah.

1620
01:04:46,128 --> 01:04:47,088
So all right.

1621
01:04:47,108 --> 01:04:55,168
He's doing these shows all the time and I bet he's like if he's doing shows every week, he's changing that up or he's improvising.

1622
01:04:55,188 --> 01:04:56,488
He's keeping that thing interesting.

1623
01:04:56,908 --> 01:04:59,108
Are you going to speculate that at least once he performed a Sonny Eclipse?

1624
01:04:59,128 --> 01:05:00,428
Well, that I don't know.

1625
01:05:00,588 --> 01:05:01,728
But I think if we were to.

1626
01:05:01,728 --> 01:05:02,368
That's probably a legal thing.

1627
01:05:02,388 --> 01:05:06,228
If we were to make that request and get a lot of people out.

1628
01:05:06,388 --> 01:05:07,488
Specifically to see it.

1629
01:05:07,488 --> 01:05:07,668
I mean, it can't just be the four.

1630
01:05:07,748 --> 01:05:09,968
Yeah, if we've sold out the room or whatever.

1631
01:05:09,968 --> 01:05:13,108
This honestly seems like this could be a magical thing.

1632
01:05:13,108 --> 01:05:15,248
It could. And then do a Q&A at the end.

1633
01:05:15,488 --> 01:05:16,448
Yeah. Yes.

1634
01:05:17,868 --> 01:05:18,968
I like.

1635
01:05:19,408 --> 01:05:19,728
But.

1636
01:05:20,008 --> 01:05:24,428
Imagine the love of this bizarre specific thing bouncing back at it.

1637
01:05:24,428 --> 01:05:25,828
All you have to do is perform.

1638
01:05:26,388 --> 01:05:27,708
Learn one of these songs.

1639
01:05:27,788 --> 01:05:28,828
Yeah. Relearn one of them.

1640
01:05:28,848 --> 01:05:30,468
I'm sure we could commission an instrumental.

1641
01:05:30,588 --> 01:05:35,148
And then we all get, you know, like I'm never going to Coachella.

1642
01:05:35,368 --> 01:05:36,828
Dear God, I don't want to deal with that.

1643
01:05:36,828 --> 01:05:42,508
But the idea of a Palm Springs escape to hear music that I love.

1644
01:05:42,848 --> 01:05:43,908
How delightful.

1645
01:05:44,248 --> 01:05:47,168
And this would be like a mini Coachella.

1646
01:05:47,168 --> 01:05:48,948
It's only one song long.

1647
01:05:49,088 --> 01:05:49,768
It's very comfortable.

1648
01:05:49,788 --> 01:05:50,668
I can sit.

1649
01:05:50,748 --> 01:05:52,088
I'm not going to get exhausted.

1650
01:05:52,828 --> 01:05:52,848
So.

1651
01:05:53,168 --> 01:05:54,608
You can call it Chelkoa.

1652
01:05:54,708 --> 01:05:57,068
Chelkoa.

1653
01:05:57,148 --> 01:05:58,148
Featuring Sonny.

1654
01:05:58,168 --> 01:06:01,628
I would like to hear some of what he's playing now.

1655
01:06:01,748 --> 01:06:03,488
I mean, we need to pay our dues.

1656
01:06:04,408 --> 01:06:06,888
He'll incorporate one Sonny Eclipse song as his finale.

1657
01:06:07,028 --> 01:06:08,008
It's his set.

1658
01:06:08,348 --> 01:06:09,508
And then he learns a Sonny song.

1659
01:06:09,508 --> 01:06:10,268
He learns one.

1660
01:06:10,308 --> 01:06:13,248
Maybe just the intro song where he's singing, my name is Sonny Eclipse.

1661
01:06:13,428 --> 01:06:14,088
Yeah. Yeah.

1662
01:06:14,208 --> 01:06:17,148
This is the place you can get a little, this is where he plays.

1663
01:06:17,328 --> 01:06:18,268
It's like every couple of days.

1664
01:06:18,288 --> 01:06:19,528
I feel like you could fill it with what?

1665
01:06:19,668 --> 01:06:20,908
Like 150 people.

1666
01:06:21,208 --> 01:06:21,428
Yeah.

1667
01:06:21,488 --> 01:06:22,488
That's what it looks like.

1668
01:06:22,588 --> 01:06:22,788
Yeah.

1669
01:06:22,888 --> 01:06:23,748
Pretty decent size.

1670
01:06:23,768 --> 01:06:26,708
I feel like there are that many Sonny Eclipse enthusiasts in the area.

1671
01:06:26,968 --> 01:06:27,308
Yeah.

1672
01:06:27,868 --> 01:06:28,508
That feels doable.

1673
01:06:28,828 --> 01:06:30,848
And people, I think LA people are going out.

1674
01:06:31,288 --> 01:06:32,348
I think so.

1675
01:06:32,428 --> 01:06:32,868
Yeah.

1676
01:06:32,928 --> 01:06:36,088
I think a big caravan shows up.

1677
01:06:36,448 --> 01:06:40,068
People don't want to hear about caravans in the desert, but wrong word.

1678
01:06:40,428 --> 01:06:40,888
Oh no.

1679
01:06:41,248 --> 01:06:44,388
But yeah, a lot of people are going to come see this thing.

1680
01:06:44,628 --> 01:06:45,208
That's what I'm trying to say.

1681
01:06:45,348 --> 01:06:46,368
And they're going to be full of love.

1682
01:06:46,388 --> 01:06:47,388
And worse comes to worse too.

1683
01:06:47,528 --> 01:06:50,408
There's a huge annual pass holder, older scene.

1684
01:06:50,648 --> 01:06:54,168
So I think maybe try to sell it to hip young people first.

1685
01:06:54,168 --> 01:06:57,508
And then if you still have tickets you need to move, put it on a Facebook group.

1686
01:06:58,268 --> 01:06:58,828
I'm sure.

1687
01:06:59,168 --> 01:07:00,528
Because the old folks on Facebook.

1688
01:07:00,528 --> 01:07:04,908
If there were APs that go to Disney every day because they're retired, they would do that.

1689
01:07:05,108 --> 01:07:05,848
I think so.

1690
01:07:05,968 --> 01:07:06,248
Yeah.

1691
01:07:06,788 --> 01:07:10,208
He plays, to answer your question, it's mostly blues.

1692
01:07:10,388 --> 01:07:13,368
It's almost exclusively blues that he plays now.

1693
01:07:13,448 --> 01:07:16,848
I think there's a version even where he just does a blues version.

1694
01:07:17,088 --> 01:07:18,488
He can do it in whatever.

1695
01:07:18,968 --> 01:07:19,288
Whatever style.

1696
01:07:19,288 --> 01:07:19,488
Yeah.

1697
01:07:20,188 --> 01:07:21,068
It just needs to be.

1698
01:07:21,188 --> 01:07:29,248
Because I think, because he can, I'll say this, I was listening to him do a couple different covered, while my guitar gently weeps, a bunch of other stuff.

1699
01:07:29,248 --> 01:07:30,648
The guy can wail.

1700
01:07:30,948 --> 01:07:32,288
He knows what he's doing.

1701
01:07:33,848 --> 01:07:37,688
So yeah, I think let him do his set and throw us a little ball.

1702
01:07:37,708 --> 01:07:40,528
And however many he's willing to do of Sunny Eclipse.

1703
01:07:41,548 --> 01:07:45,088
I mean, Bright Little Star, there's a lot of longing there, like we said.

1704
01:07:45,088 --> 01:07:47,388
So that might be the natural choice.

1705
01:07:47,388 --> 01:07:51,708
But is that going to get the crowd swinging the way that the Sunny Eclipse song would?

1706
01:07:51,928 --> 01:07:53,308
Or Hello Space Angels.

1707
01:07:54,208 --> 01:07:57,788
It's like you want to hear, it's like hearing Sergeant Pepper's Only Heart.

1708
01:07:57,788 --> 01:08:00,468
You want to hear the theme of this musical concept.

1709
01:08:00,968 --> 01:08:00,988
Exactly.

1710
01:08:01,248 --> 01:08:04,788
That maybe one's the main, in the main set, one is the encore.

1711
01:08:05,068 --> 01:08:05,628
Ooh.

1712
01:08:06,048 --> 01:08:06,188
Sure.

1713
01:08:06,668 --> 01:08:15,568
I want to, you know, however much or however little he wants to do, I just, to go to the desert and pay homage to Sunny.

1714
01:08:15,748 --> 01:08:16,448
I would do it.

1715
01:08:16,448 --> 01:08:20,008
This is my version of a vision quest of a mescaline trip.

1716
01:08:20,028 --> 01:08:22,028
Are there any eclipses coming up?

1717
01:08:22,228 --> 01:08:22,948
Because imagine.

1718
01:08:22,948 --> 01:08:23,708
Oh my God.

1719
01:08:23,708 --> 01:08:31,708
If it was the same days in Eclipse and then you go out in the desert and watch the eclipse and it's, there's no light pollution because you're in the desert.

1720
01:08:31,888 --> 01:08:32,648
Whoa.

1721
01:08:32,888 --> 01:08:33,408
I know.

1722
01:08:34,488 --> 01:08:38,208
So the, so magical moment number one, eclipse in a beautiful place.

1723
01:08:39,108 --> 01:08:41,028
Eclipse with Sunny Eclipse.

1724
01:08:41,548 --> 01:08:42,648
This is so smart.

1725
01:08:42,748 --> 01:08:42,908
Okay.

1726
01:08:42,928 --> 01:08:44,088
We need to coordinate.

1727
01:08:45,268 --> 01:08:45,988
First step, look up eclipse.

1728
01:08:46,168 --> 01:08:52,208
Second clip, second thing, talk to this guy and see if he's willing to do it.

1729
01:08:52,208 --> 01:08:53,468
And sell t-shirts.

1730
01:08:53,828 --> 01:08:54,028
Yes.

1731
01:08:54,148 --> 01:08:55,968
And then, well, we could do t-shirts first also.

1732
01:08:55,988 --> 01:08:57,308
I heard YN.

1733
01:08:59,768 --> 01:09:03,628
Also, really the eclipse is like a unorthodox opposite.

1734
01:09:03,628 --> 01:09:04,468
Instead of the heart, it's a sunny eclipse face.

1735
01:09:04,988 --> 01:09:05,788
Yeah.

1736
01:09:06,048 --> 01:09:09,588
We could just do like a Rodcast the pie.

1737
01:09:09,948 --> 01:09:10,828
The pie.

1738
01:09:11,468 --> 01:09:12,708
Rodcast the pie.

1739
01:09:12,728 --> 01:09:13,548
Rodcast the pie.

1740
01:09:14,128 --> 01:09:16,988
Those are going to really fly off the shelves.

1741
01:09:17,448 --> 01:09:17,848
I don't know.

1742
01:09:18,088 --> 01:09:18,528
And the colon.

1743
01:09:18,888 --> 01:09:19,588
The the.

1744
01:09:20,068 --> 01:09:20,708
Yeah, yeah.

1745
01:09:21,668 --> 01:09:23,988
And the colon is flipped upside down.

1746
01:09:24,208 --> 01:09:24,848
We could honestly.

1747
01:09:25,868 --> 01:09:28,008
We could go to one of these regular shows.

1748
01:09:28,748 --> 01:09:29,708
Oh no.

1749
01:09:29,868 --> 01:09:30,628
Oh no.

1750
01:09:30,628 --> 01:09:30,668
Oh no.

1751
01:09:31,548 --> 01:09:31,808
Oh no.

1752
01:09:32,828 --> 01:09:33,348
Okay.

1753
01:09:33,468 --> 01:09:34,468
So we are back.

1754
01:09:34,488 --> 01:09:35,708
We just had a little bit of a break.

1755
01:09:35,868 --> 01:09:41,088
We got so excited about this potential live show that a glass was shattered.

1756
01:09:41,228 --> 01:09:42,728
We had a little bit of a literal break.

1757
01:09:42,848 --> 01:09:44,088
There's a literal break.

1758
01:09:44,288 --> 01:09:45,608
A figurative and literal break.

1759
01:09:45,788 --> 01:09:49,228
I think one of the space angels pushed it off.

1760
01:09:49,488 --> 01:09:49,868
Yeah.

1761
01:09:50,008 --> 01:09:51,448
It wasn't my elbow.

1762
01:09:51,748 --> 01:09:52,348
It was a space.

1763
01:09:52,348 --> 01:09:53,448
It was a space angel.

1764
01:09:53,568 --> 01:09:56,248
They got so excited at the prospect of a new gig.

1765
01:09:56,308 --> 01:09:56,688
Yeah.

1766
01:09:56,888 --> 01:09:57,248
Sure.

1767
01:09:58,448 --> 01:10:02,448
And shattered your commemorative sunny eclipse tumbler.

1768
01:10:02,708 --> 01:10:06,568
Your commemorative dime a dozen high ball glass.

1769
01:10:06,788 --> 01:10:08,428
No, you're one of a kind.

1770
01:10:08,668 --> 01:10:09,568
You shitting on the glasses.

1771
01:10:09,768 --> 01:10:11,388
Jason was really shitting on the glasses.

1772
01:10:11,828 --> 01:10:13,188
Mike's cruddy old.

1773
01:10:13,188 --> 01:10:14,128
The lenses too.

1774
01:10:14,548 --> 01:10:15,208
The old glasses.

1775
01:10:16,008 --> 01:10:16,788
That's even worse.

1776
01:10:17,228 --> 01:10:17,728
So mean, Jason.

1777
01:10:17,748 --> 01:10:19,348
The roast master private.

1778
01:10:19,748 --> 01:10:23,488
I guess that's true.

1779
01:10:23,488 --> 01:10:24,448
I never really do.

1780
01:10:24,628 --> 01:10:26,928
You always wear that big uniform like Jeffrey Ross.

1781
01:10:27,188 --> 01:10:27,468
Of course.

1782
01:10:27,588 --> 01:10:28,148
Yeah, sure.

1783
01:10:28,148 --> 01:10:28,788
We know.

1784
01:10:29,128 --> 01:10:29,808
Up on every recording.

1785
01:10:30,068 --> 01:10:33,008
I mean, there's not too much left to say really.

1786
01:10:33,008 --> 01:10:33,828
Let's make this happen.

1787
01:10:33,988 --> 01:10:39,868
I think this is a, I'm too lazy to do this, but this sounds like the culmination of a

1788
01:10:39,868 --> 01:10:40,988
great documentary.

1789
01:10:41,148 --> 01:10:41,748
Oh yeah.

1790
01:10:41,908 --> 01:10:46,868
You know, like I feel like there's some story of the guy who didn't know he was big in Japan

1791
01:10:46,868 --> 01:10:48,548
and then went and played in Japan.

1792
01:10:49,148 --> 01:10:53,528
And it would be one of those documentaries that's like about you trying to contact him

1793
01:10:53,528 --> 01:10:54,328
the whole time.

1794
01:10:54,668 --> 01:10:56,228
Just talking about it.

1795
01:10:56,228 --> 01:10:59,208
So it's like, it feels like the beginning of the documentary is unnecessary.

1796
01:10:59,208 --> 01:10:59,908
Right.

1797
01:11:00,008 --> 01:11:03,428
And then the end is you succeeding, which could have just been the documentary, but

1798
01:11:03,428 --> 01:11:03,468
yeah, you need to pad it.

1799
01:11:03,468 --> 01:11:06,188
It's a very my date with Drew situation.

1800
01:11:06,188 --> 01:11:06,768
Yes.

1801
01:11:06,768 --> 01:11:09,568
It's all chasing something and it's all about us.

1802
01:11:09,748 --> 01:11:11,448
It's you and your personal journey.

1803
01:11:12,228 --> 01:11:16,488
A movie I've seen at least twice because that guy went to my college.

1804
01:11:16,488 --> 01:11:18,708
And then came back and screened it.

1805
01:11:19,028 --> 01:11:19,528
Oh, wow.

1806
01:11:20,248 --> 01:11:21,188
Gee whiz.

1807
01:11:21,588 --> 01:11:23,248
So yeah, we'll make the movie.

1808
01:11:23,368 --> 01:11:24,128
We'll make the show.

1809
01:11:24,308 --> 01:11:25,448
It all happened for real.

1810
01:11:25,588 --> 01:11:25,888
Yep.

1811
01:11:26,188 --> 01:11:26,728
Yeah.

1812
01:11:26,848 --> 01:11:32,388
I don't want to, I, I, there's only one thing in my notes that was not said and it was something

1813
01:11:32,388 --> 01:11:36,488
that you brought up, Jason, this bizarre line about it's a small world.

1814
01:11:36,488 --> 01:11:37,148
Oh yeah.

1815
01:11:37,148 --> 01:11:38,988
He starts playing it's a small world.

1816
01:11:38,988 --> 01:11:39,688
Oh right.

1817
01:11:39,868 --> 01:11:40,008
Right at the end.

1818
01:11:40,008 --> 01:11:40,768
Instrumentally.

1819
01:11:40,948 --> 01:11:41,308
Right.

1820
01:11:41,388 --> 01:11:41,768
Yeah.

1821
01:11:41,768 --> 01:11:43,128
We were talking about this the other day.

1822
01:11:43,128 --> 01:11:48,448
At the end he starts playing it's small world and he says, why did I start playing that

1823
01:11:48,448 --> 01:11:48,648
tune?

1824
01:11:48,768 --> 01:11:52,428
We use that on my planet Zork to break the enemy.

1825
01:11:53,228 --> 01:11:53,948
Wow.

1826
01:11:54,328 --> 01:11:54,668
Which is.

1827
01:11:54,668 --> 01:11:55,928
That's a mean spirited joke.

1828
01:11:56,108 --> 01:11:57,648
It is a mean spirited joke.

1829
01:11:57,748 --> 01:12:02,728
Like it's a really dark joke because like the armed forces and the intelligence communities

1830
01:12:02,728 --> 01:12:06,248
of the world have used music to torture people.

1831
01:12:06,528 --> 01:12:07,868
Like playing songs on a loop.

1832
01:12:08,148 --> 01:12:13,368
David Lynch also funnily enough, their AV club did a series about like what song do

1833
01:12:13,368 --> 01:12:14,448
you absolutely hate?

1834
01:12:14,668 --> 01:12:17,688
And David Lynch's was it's a small world is a nightmare.

1835
01:12:18,268 --> 01:12:22,948
A man known for making movies that are waking night bears like eight small worlds.

1836
01:12:22,948 --> 01:12:24,548
People always pick it's a small world.

1837
01:12:24,648 --> 01:12:25,508
Always pick small world.

1838
01:12:25,528 --> 01:12:28,508
But they should really be picking the holiday overlay of it's a small world.

1839
01:12:28,688 --> 01:12:29,188
Yeah.

1840
01:12:29,448 --> 01:12:31,408
I told you about the people that got trapped there, right?

1841
01:12:31,668 --> 01:12:32,388
No, I don't think so.

1842
01:12:32,508 --> 01:12:37,028
It was one of my experiences when I was working in complaints and it was Christmas time and

1843
01:12:37,028 --> 01:12:42,188
a family came over and said that they had been stuck there for 40 minutes inside of

1844
01:12:42,188 --> 01:12:49,248
it's a small world and that chaos erupted and they started the story by saying and it's

1845
01:12:49,248 --> 01:12:50,108
the Christmas song.

1846
01:12:50,188 --> 01:12:52,068
So you know, it's more annoying.

1847
01:12:52,068 --> 01:12:53,568
And I was like, right?

1848
01:12:53,568 --> 01:12:53,688
Wow.

1849
01:12:53,688 --> 01:12:55,568
Like I was already on board with what they were telling me.

1850
01:12:55,568 --> 01:12:56,648
I was like, of course.

1851
01:12:57,308 --> 01:12:57,568
Of course.

1852
01:12:58,388 --> 01:13:06,788
And they said that people were like wetting themselves, falling out of the boats, climbing,

1853
01:13:07,268 --> 01:13:09,808
haphazardly over the side of the flume and panicking.

1854
01:13:10,308 --> 01:13:15,688
I guess what happened is the ride broke down and the intercom system also broke, but nobody

1855
01:13:15,688 --> 01:13:17,228
outside realized it broke.

1856
01:13:17,648 --> 01:13:20,408
So they had been saying announcements like, we'll be with you shortly.

1857
01:13:20,488 --> 01:13:21,448
Like stay calm.

1858
01:13:21,708 --> 01:13:25,948
But everyone inside just thought they'd been abandoned by God and they were trapped.

1859
01:13:25,948 --> 01:13:27,148
There was lawless in there.

1860
01:13:27,188 --> 01:13:27,988
And so yeah, there was panic.

1861
01:13:28,088 --> 01:13:33,468
People were tumbling out of their boats off the side, falling to the floor below, running

1862
01:13:34,028 --> 01:13:39,228
into props, scrambling out the exit and wandering aimlessly into the backstage area, not knowing

1863
01:13:39,228 --> 01:13:40,588
how to get back to the park.

1864
01:13:40,948 --> 01:13:45,268
And usually you hear like a wild tale and you just think someone wants like fast passes.

1865
01:13:45,488 --> 01:13:47,388
So you have to like call the attraction.

1866
01:13:47,548 --> 01:13:51,168
So like I went in the back and I called small world and I was like, I've just heard like

1867
01:13:51,168 --> 01:13:52,328
a strange story.

1868
01:13:52,328 --> 01:13:53,768
And they were like, it's all true.

1869
01:13:53,968 --> 01:13:55,428
Oh my God.

1870
01:13:55,548 --> 01:13:56,148
Horrifying.

1871
01:13:56,548 --> 01:13:57,728
So it's true.

1872
01:13:57,868 --> 01:13:58,508
It can break.

1873
01:13:58,508 --> 01:14:01,408
I just think break the enemy like that.

1874
01:14:01,608 --> 01:14:06,588
That actually gives him a lounge singer like level like Frank Sinatra's connection.

1875
01:14:06,808 --> 01:14:08,588
He did a tour of active duty.

1876
01:14:08,708 --> 01:14:10,888
Is that required on the planet Zork?

1877
01:14:11,448 --> 01:14:12,608
Possibly.

1878
01:14:12,948 --> 01:14:16,188
Well, there's no draft in America.

1879
01:14:16,548 --> 01:14:18,348
So there has to be an opposite.

1880
01:14:18,568 --> 01:14:18,828
Yeah.

1881
01:14:19,168 --> 01:14:22,048
Every every 18 year old.

1882
01:14:22,048 --> 01:14:23,128
And who is the enemy?

1883
01:14:24,108 --> 01:14:25,708
That's what I'd like to know.

1884
01:14:25,708 --> 01:14:26,408
Who is the enemy?

1885
01:14:26,488 --> 01:14:28,288
It definitely gives him a layer of darkness.

1886
01:14:28,348 --> 01:14:28,488
Like so much more.

1887
01:14:28,868 --> 01:14:33,908
Sinatra's relationship with acknowledging that it's not peace times on the planet Zork.

1888
01:14:34,008 --> 01:14:38,248
Well I guess they're probably at war with corthneria.

1889
01:14:38,268 --> 01:14:39,368
Yeah.

1890
01:14:40,448 --> 01:14:41,528
Among other.

1891
01:14:41,868 --> 01:14:44,788
He was mostly on the OSU shows.

1892
01:14:45,028 --> 01:14:46,908
You're right.

1893
01:14:48,028 --> 01:14:49,648
He wasn't seen in any action.

1894
01:14:50,808 --> 01:14:50,828
Yeah.

1895
01:14:50,828 --> 01:14:51,608
Like Cobb Boat.

1896
01:14:51,868 --> 01:14:52,228
Yes.

1897
01:14:53,188 --> 01:14:57,008
So there, I mean, what else can you say?

1898
01:14:57,008 --> 01:15:00,028
Like you think he's doing Voland Stalart?

1899
01:15:01,908 --> 01:15:03,788
Like John, like Voland Stalart?

1900
01:15:03,968 --> 01:15:04,908
Like John Wayne?

1901
01:15:05,148 --> 01:15:05,968
Like John Wayne?

1902
01:15:07,088 --> 01:15:09,308
Sorry, Juan Jane?

1903
01:15:10,208 --> 01:15:11,048
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1904
01:15:11,468 --> 01:15:20,668
And I guess their, their intelligence has not been compromised by the uviat sovian.

1905
01:15:20,788 --> 01:15:21,728
Yeah.

1906
01:15:22,228 --> 01:15:22,708
Oh my God.

1907
01:15:23,248 --> 01:15:23,508
Tough one.

1908
01:15:23,508 --> 01:15:26,888
We got one to get in the show before someone brain breaks.

1909
01:15:27,588 --> 01:15:30,308
Crazy joke to get through all the layers of Disney.

1910
01:15:30,308 --> 01:15:30,648
Platamir Booten.

1911
01:15:30,968 --> 01:15:31,768
Disney okay.

1912
01:15:32,128 --> 01:15:33,908
Platamir Booten is a great alien name.

1913
01:15:35,088 --> 01:15:36,408
That one went down smoother.

1914
01:15:37,508 --> 01:15:42,188
But hey, let's get it all back on stage.

1915
01:15:42,248 --> 01:15:43,468
Let's get the space angels.

1916
01:15:43,548 --> 01:15:44,808
Let's talk about the enemy.

1917
01:15:45,648 --> 01:15:47,868
Let's learn about Unorc City.

1918
01:15:49,148 --> 01:15:53,248
We will write Unorc material as we already have.

1919
01:15:54,628 --> 01:15:56,108
This is going to be great.

1920
01:15:56,188 --> 01:16:00,388
This is going to be a thousand times as good as the desert trip as the McCartney Stones.

1921
01:16:00,948 --> 01:16:04,008
This will be the greatest Palm Springs concert of all time.

1922
01:16:04,948 --> 01:16:06,028
And that's saying something.

1923
01:16:06,928 --> 01:16:09,128
He's putting a lot of great stuff out there.

1924
01:16:10,608 --> 01:16:11,968
So yeah.

1925
01:16:12,348 --> 01:16:13,728
Well, I guess, okay.

1926
01:16:14,708 --> 01:16:18,628
So Jenny Nicholson, you survived podcast The Ride twice in one day.

1927
01:16:18,648 --> 01:16:19,368
Whoa, I park hopped.

1928
01:16:19,368 --> 01:16:20,228
First ever.

1929
01:16:20,528 --> 01:16:22,268
The first park hopper.

1930
01:16:22,268 --> 01:16:22,648
Yes.

1931
01:16:23,028 --> 01:16:26,388
This is like being the first person in space or something.

1932
01:16:26,468 --> 01:16:29,128
Are we going to talk about plussing up Sunny Eclipse?

1933
01:16:29,508 --> 01:16:30,908
Oh, yeah, we missed that.

1934
01:16:30,928 --> 01:16:32,048
Is there a way?

1935
01:16:32,448 --> 01:16:32,608
Yes.

1936
01:16:32,608 --> 01:16:33,348
Okay.

1937
01:16:33,568 --> 01:16:34,108
Oh, yes please.

1938
01:16:34,288 --> 01:16:34,508
It's all set.

1939
01:16:35,068 --> 01:16:39,988
Bring all the animatronics from Stitch's Great Escape and put them as his band.

1940
01:16:40,328 --> 01:16:41,228
Oh yeah.

1941
01:16:41,288 --> 01:16:42,948
I'm Skippy on a keytar.

1942
01:16:42,968 --> 01:16:44,028
Oh my God.

1943
01:16:44,368 --> 01:16:46,668
Although he's also, he's maybe a good, he's sort of snouty.

1944
01:16:46,688 --> 01:16:48,848
He could play a woodwind or something.

1945
01:16:49,748 --> 01:16:50,328
That's great.

1946
01:16:50,888 --> 01:16:51,528
Absolutely.

1947
01:16:51,708 --> 01:16:51,888
Wow.

1948
01:16:52,068 --> 01:16:52,508
Yeah.

1949
01:16:52,788 --> 01:16:55,948
And then the donut eating one and the robot that was Tim Curry.

1950
01:16:56,228 --> 01:16:57,408
Oh, sir.

1951
01:16:57,568 --> 01:16:57,888
Sir.

1952
01:16:57,988 --> 01:16:58,268
Yeah.

1953
01:16:58,368 --> 01:17:01,128
I say take the restaurant out and just make it its own show.

1954
01:17:01,428 --> 01:17:02,308
Sure.

1955
01:17:02,728 --> 01:17:06,408
Or what if, you know, Stitch's Great Escape is kind of, you know, hey, let's not even

1956
01:17:06,408 --> 01:17:07,328
move all those robots.

1957
01:17:07,588 --> 01:17:11,408
Let's put them in the Stitch's Great Escape.

1958
01:17:11,448 --> 01:17:12,928
Oh, just having them perform in that venue.

1959
01:17:13,028 --> 01:17:13,208
Yep.

1960
01:17:13,908 --> 01:17:14,108
New committed venue.

1961
01:17:14,108 --> 01:17:16,008
Although I like dinner and a show.

1962
01:17:16,148 --> 01:17:17,788
What if they plus up the food?

1963
01:17:17,788 --> 01:17:18,388
There you go.

1964
01:17:18,388 --> 01:17:20,448
And then it was an actual lounge experience.

1965
01:17:20,488 --> 01:17:21,128
That'd be great.

1966
01:17:21,368 --> 01:17:22,008
And it's a whole.

1967
01:17:22,008 --> 01:17:25,068
And they have drinks and like, you know, waiting tables.

1968
01:17:25,488 --> 01:17:27,648
Like it's an actual table dining experience.

1969
01:17:27,748 --> 01:17:28,088
Geez.

1970
01:17:28,308 --> 01:17:28,468
Yeah.

1971
01:17:28,468 --> 01:17:28,668
Yeah.

1972
01:17:28,988 --> 01:17:29,728
Okay.

1973
01:17:29,828 --> 01:17:30,288
I'm into that.

1974
01:17:30,428 --> 01:17:30,708
That's good.

1975
01:17:30,708 --> 01:17:36,648
Tarminis, hand matins, all the drinks you can name.

1976
01:17:37,408 --> 01:17:44,328
Oh, Mike is preventing Edwin from getting into any microscopic broken glass.

1977
01:17:44,328 --> 01:17:46,448
He is throwing himself on the ground.

1978
01:17:47,148 --> 01:17:49,968
Rolling on the ground like he you can pick him up.

1979
01:17:49,968 --> 01:17:50,968
I can't, but he's going to.

1980
01:17:51,048 --> 01:17:51,468
He gets weird.

1981
01:17:51,628 --> 01:17:58,228
This is I mean, this is like a wild night at Cosmic Ray's making a topping bar salads.

1982
01:17:58,248 --> 01:18:00,048
I'll let you guys finish the show alone.

1983
01:18:00,208 --> 01:18:01,888
You have to stay with.

1984
01:18:02,128 --> 01:18:02,408
Oh, no.

1985
01:18:02,528 --> 01:18:04,128
Mike has to finish from afar.

1986
01:18:04,408 --> 01:18:04,668
It's fine.

1987
01:18:04,968 --> 01:18:05,528
You can chop across.

1988
01:18:05,528 --> 01:18:11,008
Well, so if you if you did this episode first, make sure to go over to the main feed to listen

1989
01:18:11,008 --> 01:18:12,468
to both of them.

1990
01:18:12,468 --> 01:18:16,748
If you did interventions and you're coming here, thank you so much for listening.

1991
01:18:16,768 --> 01:18:19,228
If you did it the opposite way, a New York way.

1992
01:18:20,428 --> 01:18:21,488
I don't want to answer.

1993
01:18:21,868 --> 01:18:23,648
They're both great in their own ways.

1994
01:18:23,968 --> 01:18:25,428
Which episode is more worth watching?

1995
01:18:26,528 --> 01:18:30,288
Both are worth revisiting over and over again.

1996
01:18:31,288 --> 01:18:33,508
Cycling like a sunny eclipse loop.

1997
01:18:34,008 --> 01:18:34,968
Or orbiting.

1998
01:18:35,328 --> 01:18:35,548
Yeah.

1999
01:18:35,628 --> 01:18:35,928
Yeah.

2000
01:18:35,928 --> 01:18:36,548
Constantly.

2001
01:18:36,588 --> 01:18:39,268
Just let these episodes orbit around your ears.

2002
01:18:40,788 --> 01:18:45,028
And as soon as this is done, check out interventions, then listen to some clips again.

2003
01:18:45,108 --> 01:18:45,408
Yeah.

2004
01:18:45,508 --> 01:18:46,148
A sandwich.

2005
01:18:46,308 --> 01:18:48,208
Spend a full day park hopping.

2006
01:18:48,668 --> 01:18:50,608
Delicious falafel sandwich of content.

2007
01:18:51,848 --> 01:18:53,668
So we like to think of it.

2008
01:18:54,028 --> 01:18:54,748
Jay, thank you so much.

2009
01:18:54,828 --> 01:18:55,308
What a blast.

2010
01:18:55,708 --> 01:18:57,748
Thank you for having me on both of them.

2011
01:18:57,928 --> 01:18:59,608
Yes, please come back any time.

2012
01:19:00,108 --> 01:19:01,748
And yeah, thanks for thanks for subscribing.

2013
01:19:01,748 --> 01:19:04,728
And I, Mike's over there, so I don't know how to stop the recording.

2014
01:19:05,048 --> 01:19:06,088
There's no way.

2015
01:19:06,488 --> 01:19:07,948
It just is what it is.

2016
01:19:07,968 --> 01:19:09,328
Oh, we're stuck.

2017
01:19:09,608 --> 01:19:09,928
We're trapped.

2018
01:19:10,408 --> 01:19:11,208
We didn't mention Jenny.

2019
01:19:11,208 --> 01:19:12,468
You are also on Patreon.

2020
01:19:12,648 --> 01:19:13,008
Are you?

2021
01:19:13,008 --> 01:19:14,088
I am also on Patreon.

2022
01:19:14,088 --> 01:19:16,248
Patreon.com slash Jenny Nicholson.

2023
01:19:16,248 --> 01:19:16,908
Do you have that?

2024
01:19:17,188 --> 01:19:17,468
Probably.

2025
01:19:17,748 --> 01:19:18,028
Okay.

2026
01:19:18,188 --> 01:19:20,208
Well, if not search comes up really easy.

2027
01:19:20,208 --> 01:19:20,788
That sounds like my URL.

2028
01:19:20,848 --> 01:19:21,688
Or search my name.

2029
01:19:21,708 --> 01:19:22,768
What does it say you're making?

2030
01:19:22,848 --> 01:19:23,788
What's your little like?

2031
01:19:23,948 --> 01:19:24,648
Jenny Nicholson is.

2032
01:19:24,668 --> 01:19:25,068
I think just videos.

2033
01:19:25,108 --> 01:19:26,388
I didn't try to clever it up.

2034
01:19:26,408 --> 01:19:27,548
You didn't do something.

2035
01:19:27,788 --> 01:19:29,308
I didn't try to be cute.

2036
01:19:30,948 --> 01:19:31,728
I think it just says videos.

2037
01:19:32,248 --> 01:19:36,168
Sunny Eclipse is making Astro Organ jams.

2038
01:19:36,288 --> 01:19:39,508
Oh, if he was, let's get Sunny Eclipse on Patreon.

2039
01:19:39,508 --> 01:19:40,128
We should.

2040
01:19:40,228 --> 01:19:42,108
He could commission space songs.

2041
01:19:42,288 --> 01:19:45,808
And we can, it pays for.

2042
01:19:47,048 --> 01:19:48,308
For a new space organ.

2043
01:19:48,448 --> 01:19:48,688
Sure.

2044
01:19:48,888 --> 01:19:49,508
Astro Organ.

2045
01:19:49,808 --> 01:19:52,668
And like quicker teleporting abilities for the.

2046
01:19:52,668 --> 01:19:53,648
For the space angels.

2047
01:19:53,768 --> 01:19:54,028
Great.

2048
01:19:54,708 --> 01:19:55,188
So donate.

2049
01:19:55,308 --> 01:19:56,048

2050
01:19:56,348 --> 01:19:57,868
Keep keep on our Patreon.

01:19:57,968 --> 01:20:01,048
Donate to Jenny Nicholson and to Sunny Eclipse.

2052
01:20:02,068 --> 01:20:02,348
Yes.

2053
01:20:02,508 --> 01:20:02,788
All right.

2054
01:20:02,928 --> 01:20:03,348
I'm going to figure out.

2055
01:20:03,348 --> 01:20:04,208
We'll see you in Palm Springs.

2056
01:20:04,368 --> 01:20:05,148
Yeah, we'll see you in Palm Springs.

2057
01:20:05,248 --> 01:20:07,288
I'm going to figure out how to stop this crazy machine.

2058
01:20:07,468 --> 01:20:07,808
Bye bye.

2059
01:20:07,908 --> 01:20:08,048
Bye.
