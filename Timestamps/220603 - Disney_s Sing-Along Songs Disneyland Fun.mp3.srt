1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,840
Club Three.

2
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:25,560
Welcome for the very first time to podcast the Ride and the Ride and the Ride.

3
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:34,360
Welcome for the very first time to podcast the Ride Club Three, the new exclusive VIP

4
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,520
club within podcast the Ride, the second gate.

5
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,480
I'm Scott Gartner, Mike Carlson made it.

6
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:39,480
You're still here.

7
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:43,920
I'm here and I'm in the lap of luxury in this new club of ours.

8
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:44,920
I'm loving it.

9
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,520
I'm loving the extra theming.

10
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,440
Jason Sheridan also in that lap.

11
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:51,440
By the skin of my teeth.

12
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,440
By the skin of your teeth, you made it.

13
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,440
I made it.

14
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:56,400
Because I fucked up the time.

15
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,000
Jason was late to our first Club Three.

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,600
I was late to Club Three.

17
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:06,920
You know, I left my house at 1 p.m. and I was like, ooh, I'm going to be early.

18
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:07,920
Nice.

19
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:08,920
I texted you.

20
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:12,520
I texted something as I was parked waiting and then you immediately texted back and I

21
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,520
didn't see your car here and I went, uh-oh.

22
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,520
Uh-oh, that's right.

23
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,360
I was like, you shouldn't be texting and driving.

24
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,360
Is everything okay?

25
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,800
Well, it was reading.

26
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:22,960
Siri read it to me.

27
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,520
Do you have Siri read your texts?

28
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,800
Sometimes you can say, hey, Siri read my messages.

29
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,960
I've done it, but I don't often do it.

30
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:31,960
Yeah.

31
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:32,960
But doesn't it?

32
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:33,960
Well, that's like a car.

33
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:37,400
That's a way to be, because otherwise it takes longer, I think.

34
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,400
Oh yeah.

35
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,400
No, it's a pain.

36
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,720
To say that and then have it slowly.

37
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,560
I could see though, Jason doing that because he gets too tired reading.

38
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,080
Said he'd rather have Siri read it to him.

39
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,080
I know.

40
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:54,240
I'll tell you, the response, the autocorrect dictation response has gotten so bad on the

41
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,240
iPhone.

42
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,240
Oh, sure.

43
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,240
Yeah.

44
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:01,560
I found out it's because it stopped learning your behaviors and now it's sourcing it from

45
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,560
everyone.

46
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,680
The algorithm is sourcing common mistakes from a pool.

47
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,680
Oh, really?

48
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,680
Yeah.

49
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,680
Oh, weird.

50
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:15,560
That's why it's like you start typing I-L-O and it's like, I logged you?

51
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,800
Did you mean I logged?

52
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,800
Wait, you're saying that most of the population are not writing love you?

53
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,280
They're saying I log you?

54
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,920
I'm not saying most of the population is.

55
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:32,480
I'm saying the algorithm is somehow assuming like you start typing L-O.

56
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,560
They think it's logged.

57
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,560
They think it's logged.

58
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,760
I've gotten like logged as a replacement a few times recently.

59
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,760
Hmm.

60
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,760
Hmm.

61
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,760
Think this would happen to us?

62
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,760
I don't know.

63
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,760
I turn my like suggestion stuff off.

64
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,320
Yeah, a lot of people have it turned off nowadays.

65
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,160
So I don't have it to fill in there.

66
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:52,080
But L-O look, I'm not getting log.

67
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,400
Everyone try it at home though.

68
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,400
You'll know.

69
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,080
Maybe it's maybe there's a lot of log with I guess not me but with that because we've

70
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,720
talked about logs a lot.

71
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:03,720
We've talked about sopping wet logs and taking your socks off in the law.

72
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,720
Of course.

73
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,720
Sure.

74
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,920
You know, the phone's picked up a lot of log talk over the years.

75
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:08,920
Yeah, that's true.

76
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,200
I guess we thank you for logging.

77
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,200
Oh, yeah.

78
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,200
Thank you for logging into.

79
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:20,040
Patreon and upping your status to be here to hear some of this log talk.

80
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:24,680
You can tell the how special this episode is already because of the log extra log talk

81
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,680
up top.

82
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,840
Yeah, that's the kind of quality you're getting from not probably not the last log talk of

83
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,840
today.

84
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,840
Of course not.

85
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,840
Yeah.

86
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,840
More log talk to be.

87
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,840
Did you like my voice one?

88
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,840
I like that.

89
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,840
Yeah, no, I like that.

90
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:43,560
Well, one of the one of the 10 this should be up right is that slow motion video of Mike

91
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,920
taking the socks off.

92
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:45,920
Yeah, log.

93
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,920
We did film.

94
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,440
We went and filmed that with like a Phantom camera.

95
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:55,280
We snuck one of the like the Top Gun IMAX cameras into a log so that we had it in really

96
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,440
perfect even low light in the low light of the low log.

97
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,440
Yeah, yeah.

98
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:04,040
The same technology used in Top Gun, the new one and escape from what tomorrow?

99
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,040
What's that?

100
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,040
The Disney gorilla?

101
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,480
Yeah, we made kind of a combo escape from tomorrow.

102
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,800
Yeah, gun, but two of the finest films ever made.

103
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:17,680
We should make our own escape from tomorrow in the park to shoot over like 10 years.

104
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,680
So it's not a crazy like undertaking.

105
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,680
Yeah, yeah.

106
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,680
We're all right.

107
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,680
Yeah, then we're not sneaking around.

108
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,160
Yeah, it's just 15 minutes at a time.

109
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,160
That's a good idea.

110
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,160
We're going to do.

111
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,160
Okay.

112
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,160
Well, that'll be here.

113
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,160
We'll release it completely here.

114
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,600
Anyway, the point is thanks for being here.

115
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:35,000
Thank you also, Aaron Gardner for the new logo and the name club three.

116
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,960
You have all made it to the deepest rung of podcasts.

117
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:40,960
The ride.

118
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,000
Look how deep we've all gotten.

119
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,120
We're all here together.

120
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,320
And what I like about this, what I think we could be doing here and what I think I, what

121
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:53,800
I hope that this feels like is like this is a party where everyone knows each other, where

122
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,600
no one has to be introduced to each other.

123
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,920
We don't have to sell it like, oh, you haven't met so and so.

124
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:58,920
No, we've all met.

125
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,000
We're very acquainted if we're all here now.

126
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,040
This is an Aaron suggestion was we don't even say our names at the top.

127
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,040
They know we just start talking.

128
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,040
That's pretty good.

129
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,040
Go straight into the show.

130
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,040
All right, let's get right into it.

131
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:13,440
We got to get that fluoride out of the water.

132
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,480
Okay.

133
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,520
If you're here, you agree that I need now.

134
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,960
I don't need that's deep.

135
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:19,960
That's too deep for me.

136
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:20,960
What's up with fluoride?

137
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,360
That's just a conspiracy thing.

138
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,920
That's not a Disney.

139
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,280
There wasn't a big fluoride spill in pirates.

140
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,280
No, no, no.

141
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:31,680
No, that's just how people think like the fluoride in the tap water.

142
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,000
They do put fluoride in tap water.

143
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Yes, they do.

144
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
That is confirmed.

145
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,320
But some people have conspiracy theories about what it's doing to us, etc.

146
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,880
So yeah, Jason was getting down a conspiracy theory rabbit hole already, which is what

147
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:44,880
he's made.

148
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:49,080
He's promising from his angle of this new tier, he's going to start giving you his unfiltered

149
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,080
opinions.

150
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,880
It's spirit or raw opinions.

151
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:53,880
Yeah.

152
00:05:54,280 --> 00:06:00,560
Yeah, back and forth between Disneyland sing alongs and Building 7, the truth.

153
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,560
Yeah.

154
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,480
You're going to find it out.

155
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:08,880
And then we'll lead a sing along at the end of an original song that's about the truth

156
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,600
about Building 7.

157
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,600
Exactly.

158
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:18,000
But so anyway, so here's, let's do a little bit of protocol here with that in mind being

159
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,520
that this is a, it's a swanky club where we all know each other.

160
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:26,560
I think, and we chose the topic for today's episode, which is Disney sing along songs,

161
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,040
the 1990 videotape.

162
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:33,040
From here on out, the topics will be selected by you, the audience.

163
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:36,800
And what we need now, this is now we're doing the top of an improv show.

164
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:42,280
What we need is a quick suggestion, but a really specific, we're going to do lots of

165
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,080
specific improv shows.

166
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,520
So what we do need everyone is a suggestion.

167
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:51,400
So in the comments below this episode, that's that this is what I'm preparing.

168
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,480
We haven't talked about the protocols here exactly.

169
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,480
Right.

170
00:06:54,480 --> 00:07:01,560
But I think go into the comments of this and leave your idea of the most deep, obscure,

171
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:07,320
insane, indulgent slice, like small sliver even, like how we, you know, we like to do.

172
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:11,880
If there's one specific robots on pirate, like we already did one robots on pirates,

173
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:15,240
but honestly, one of the robots on pirates, not obscure enough for me.

174
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,760
That's a very famous ride.

175
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:21,560
So really get into creative, interesting, as far as your choices are concerned.

176
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,560
I think so.

177
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,560
Yes.

178
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:27,160
If you've passed, if you've been in the parks and seen a tree with a root that was weird

179
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,920
or that almost tripped you.

180
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,560
We're going to do, we want to go do an episode about that root.

181
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,560
That's right.

182
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,160
Specific trash cans.

183
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,160
Yes.

184
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,160
Specific umbrellas.

185
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,160
Yes.

186
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,160
Let's talk shade.

187
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,040
How do you throw shade at shade providers?

188
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:46,200
Do you want us to taste the different waters on the different rides?

189
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,200
I'm not saying we're going to do it.

190
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,000
I'm just saying that's an interesting idea.

191
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,920
We'll see how much fluoride is in each ride.

192
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:59,160
You know, if, as we're talking about today, is there a really specific old video or special

193
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:04,120
you want to send us to watch that we can all talk about together?

194
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:08,080
You know, some weird ride that's really regional and nobody knows about.

195
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:13,320
Is it a method of, as with making us drink the water, is it a method of torturing us?

196
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,320
Yes.

197
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,800
That you could send us to do.

198
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:21,920
And I know what I'm opening myself up to here because I've provided a lot of possible ways

199
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,920
to torture me.

200
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:27,520
I don't want to start saying what they are, but if you want to, you know, send us on little

201
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:33,080
missions, whatever, whatever it is, things that would test the patience of even the regular

202
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,680
second gate subscriber.

203
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:41,040
An episode about just the sexy robot on the cover of Aerosmith's Just Push Play.

204
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,520
Something like that is what I'm saying.

205
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,520
I know what you're, yeah.

206
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,720
Jason knows what I mean.

207
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,720
Jason knows what I mean.

208
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,920
This is my guy right here.

209
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:48,920
That guy right here.

210
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:49,920
Yeah.

211
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,320
That could be in the future Revolution X episode.

212
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,320
Sure.

213
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,320
What?

214
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,320
No, it's, oh no, it's own episode.

215
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,320
Oh, that's its own episode.

216
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,320
Just the robot.

217
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,240
No, sexy Just Push Play robot, its own episode.

218
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:04,680
I feel like we have to regulate the amount of Aerosmith specific because there's a lot,

219
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,240
there's a lot that could be done.

220
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,240
Yeah.

221
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:11,120
They can't all, we're going to, I think we're going to lose people if more than one a quarter

222
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,920
is Aerosmith, unless I'm wrong.

223
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,320
Maybe we will see.

224
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,640
We'll look at the comments and it will be entirely Aerosmith.

225
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,640
Yeah, who knows?

226
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,880
If you will.

227
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:19,880
We will find out.

228
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,760
And now I'm looking at this robot even.

229
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,880
Yeah, I guess, well, oh, she's, it's like a Marilyn.

230
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,320
Yeah, the sexy robot is like Marilyn.

231
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,320
Yeah, yeah.

232
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,320
It's a robotic Marilyn.

233
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,080
So that, yeah, anyway, you know what to do.

234
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:38,280
You know the runners, you know the deep specifics, and I think it's time to get down and dirty

235
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,280
and do all of it.

236
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:43,960
I think, you know, I think we can all agree that we would like, it's a club, it's a podcast

237
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,960
club.

238
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,160
We really want this to be our Club Random.

239
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,160
Yeah.

240
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:50,760
Which if we haven't, I don't, now I don't remember if we've talked about Club Random much on

241
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,760
the show.

242
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,760
I don't think we have it all.

243
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:53,760
Maybe we have.

244
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,400
This is just, this is just a frequent topic of conversation off the show.

245
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:00,880
You're already, I assume you're all already listening to Club Random or watching at Bill

246
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:07,680
Mars podcast done in the part of the basement, the part of his basement that's decorated,

247
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,840
the part that the bodies are in.

248
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,840
Yes.

249
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,840
You don't need that.

250
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,280
You don't need to make it look super nice.

251
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,080
That's the, you're only gonna, you're only attracting bugs over there.

252
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,080
Yeah.

253
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:21,440
It's the part where he bought a neon sign that blows out the camera and fucks the lighting

254
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,440
and the rest of the room.

255
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:27,320
Which is where he poorly reads ad copy in an awkwardly staged way.

256
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,800
Hey, none of that here.

257
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:36,400
No ads here on the, that's where you can listen again to the main feed episodes without ads.

258
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:42,000
So if you want at gunpoint ad reads, you gotta go to Club Random for that.

259
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Yeah.

260
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Gotta go look up Bill Mars.

261
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Not Club Three.

262
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Not Club Three.

263
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
No, not here.

264
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,200
But yeah, we're, and I think we'll share a lot of, you know, we're working on booking

265
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,000
everyone Bill Mars had.

266
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,660
So Dr. Drew will be here.

267
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:58,660
Who else is he?

268
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:00,960
Dr. Drew will be here a couple of times at least.

269
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,840
Who else has been on?

270
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,680
The woman who seemed very uncomfortable.

271
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,320
Was it Bella Thorne?

272
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,320
Was it Bella Thorne?

273
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,440
A woman, a woman seeming uncomfortable.

274
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,280
You'll have to be more specific.

275
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,280
Yeah.

276
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,280
Yeah.

277
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,840
Most of them have not been on video.

278
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:21,200
They've not been on digital video.

279
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,440
But anyway, yeah.

280
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:25,360
So Holly Mandel will be here.

281
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,880
Who's recently talked about how scared he is to be canceled.

282
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:29,880
Disgusting as, yeah.

283
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:35,520
You know, people are attacking the comedians and the logical order is Rock, Chappelle,

284
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,520
Mandel.

285
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,160
Where else, who else is going to get?

286
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,160
Who else?

287
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,160
Yeah.

288
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,160
And people know he doesn't like to be touched.

289
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,160
So that's an equal.

290
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,160
That's a level that's true.

291
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,520
That Chappelle and Rock didn't have to deal with.

292
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,520
That's a good point.

293
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,520
So yeah, they'll be here.

294
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,520
They'll be here buying the paywall.

295
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:52,040
They'll all be here.

296
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:55,960
But anyway, so give us your, and we'll figure out exactly how we're some here, but please

297
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,200
give us your episode topics.

298
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,600
What do you want out of out of us and out of Club 3?

299
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,800
I think we'll do some sort of poll as well.

300
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:08,320
So it'll all be done within this Patreon app and log in and whatever.

301
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,320
Sorry.

302
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,320
It's just the most efficient.

303
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,320
What was that?

304
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:14,320
Sorry you had to go to the Patreon website.

305
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,320
Is it that bad?

306
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,320
What's wrong?

307
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,320
I don't know.

308
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,320
It's just never been good.

309
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,320
I mean, it works.

310
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,320
It's solid.

311
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,080
I have no beef with the Patreon website.

312
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,680
Is it confusing, the website?

313
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,160
I think it's a little confusing.

314
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,160
Okay.

315
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,120
I don't realize.

316
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,520
I want to know your whole air, all the gripes.

317
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,960
I bet there's some anecdote in there.

318
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,320
I bet there's some anecdote in there that we're not getting at.

319
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,560
There was something years ago where they were going to start charging people extra fees

320
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,920
and stuff and then they got yelled at so much they dropped it.

321
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:42,920
Yeah, that's true.

322
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:46,640
I think you go to Patreon thinking you could subscribe to Club Random and it was not there.

323
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:51,840
Is that why you wanted to give your $20 a month to Club Random, but it wasn't available.

324
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:56,760
I think the fees ended up, I think it was sales tax, which I think a lot of states imposed.

325
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,400
I think you do it to pay sales tax now.

326
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,400
Well, it is not.

327
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,400
That's the government.

328
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:04,280
If we really want to get into the reality, it is not a good business for them, the Patreon.

329
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:07,800
We can't say that here on Patreon.

330
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,800
Sorry, sorry.

331
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:09,800
Yeah.

332
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,800
Don't let them know.

333
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,800
Anyway.

334
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,800
Okay.

335
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:19,040
So we'll do some sort of poll and we'll narrow it down and figure out next month's topic

336
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,360
that way and beyond that and beyond that.

337
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,360
That's the idea.

338
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,920
But for now, let's talk about what we're here to talk about.

339
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:28,840
The one that we've in a draconian manner imposed upon you.

340
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:35,560
The Disney sing along songs, Disneyland fun video from 1990 and which I would have to

341
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:39,920
imagine at least of people of a certain age.

342
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,040
I imagine this is kind of a linchpin.

343
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:48,840
This was like a big, this was a way to experience Disneyland and the comfort of your own home.

344
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:51,360
That was the appeal of this tape to me.

345
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,360
Yeah.

346
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,360
Oh yeah.

347
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:57,440
I'm sure I'm repeating myself to some degree because we've briefly touched on this.

348
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:02,520
This was for a Disney World family, a time that you got to see the place you'd never

349
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,520
go.

350
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,520
Oh, I hadn't even thought about that.

351
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,520
Yeah.

352
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,520
Yeah.

353
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,520
Nice.

354
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,520
Yes.

355
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,960
So you would, oh, I do, like you'd see, oh, that is the different castle.

356
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:10,960
Okay.

357
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:13,840
I'm never going to see that with my own eyes, but that there, that's what it looks like.

358
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,520
That's what their haunted mansion looks like.

359
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,520
Sure.

360
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,520
Okay.

361
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,520
Interesting.

362
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:22,240
So it was a glimpse into a forbidden world in my mind.

363
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:27,560
You assumed that your life would be, at eight years old, you assumed that your life would

364
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:30,680
be too boring to ever allow you to go to Disneyland.

365
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:31,680
It just didn't make sense.

366
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,520
It didn't make sense.

367
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,880
It didn't make sense until I moved here.

368
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:40,240
It didn't make sense until I was 23 that I would go to Disneyland.

369
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,240
How would that ever happen?

370
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,720
A lot all the time.

371
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,720
Yeah.

372
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:46,520
Solo for work with a laptop.

373
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:51,400
No, I would never have dreamed I would have been there over like 200 times.

374
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,920
Maybe it's too, it's got to be 200.

375
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:54,920
I mean, 150 I think.

376
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:55,920
To try to count.

377
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:56,920
I have no idea.

378
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:00,760
The annual passes were counting up until a certain point, but then it's, the data is

379
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:06,280
in there, but God knows, go Disney.com, whatever, go.com.

380
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:10,240
It's probably like destroyed all the information at a certain point.

381
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,240
Oh, we should do a deep dive on go.com.

382
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,240
That's an interesting one.

383
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:19,200
Yeah, that's good actually.

384
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:24,160
How in the world is it still the case that you go to Disneyland.com and then like ding,

385
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,840
ding, ding, and you have to dial into go.com?

386
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:29,960
From the app too, it's like, oh, it should just be in the app where you make changes.

387
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:34,360
No, it takes you then to the website, which then you have to log into go.com.

388
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,120
Then it takes you back to the app.

389
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,360
You can't do everything in app.

390
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,920
It's still this like mishmash of technologies from 25 years ago.

391
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:42,920
Yeah.

392
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:43,920
Yeah, it sucks.

393
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:44,920
Yeah.

394
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:50,800
There are situations where you're trying to book going for the day at all or book a restaurant

395
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:51,800
or whatever.

396
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,800
Oh, I found a time.

397
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:53,800
Oh my God.

398
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:54,800
I found a time.

399
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:55,800
Please log into Disney.

400
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:56,800
No, no, no.

401
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:57,800
You get an email.

402
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,800
I saw my name at the top.

403
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,800
It said, welcome Scott.

404
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,320
I don't need to do this again.

405
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,720
And you get an email when you log in.

406
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,720
Yes.

407
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,720
Yes.

408
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,720
Someone has logged.

409
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,720
Oh, that's right.

410
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,720
We never localized that.

411
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,720
Every time you log in to Disneyland.

412
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,720
Someone has logged in.

413
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,720
Yeah, me.

414
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,720
Please.

415
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,720
Does it like every day.

416
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:16,080
I mean, it's like a real two factor authentication kind of emails.

417
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,440
Like there's not a code in that email.

418
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,440
I was just telling you.

419
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,800
It's just an email saying, hey, you logged in?

420
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,800
Yeah, of course I did.

421
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:22,800
Yeah.

422
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,440
I guess, that's a common thing with Patreon.

423
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,280
There's a lot of like, did you mean to log in?

424
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,280
Yes.

425
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,280
Yeah.

426
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,280
Get used to me.

427
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,280
I go here.

428
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:35,120
So you never could have dreamed back when you were a kid that you would have gripes

429
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,760
about technology that hadn't been invented yet.

430
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:38,760
Never.

431
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:39,760
I never knew.

432
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:40,760
About a park that you might never go to.

433
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:41,760
In my wildest dreams.

434
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,480
I would be something that I would prefer this park.

435
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,480
Yeah.

436
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,480
I am.

437
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,800
It's interesting to hear you guys talk about like watching this at home because Jane told

438
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,600
me the same thing like in her house.

439
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,480
They just ran this tape like all the time.

440
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,480
They were watching this thing.

441
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,720
That was not my experience.

442
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,680
We did not have this at home.

443
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:03,160
The music teacher at school had it.

444
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:08,880
And when there was a substitute or she just was checked out, checked out.

445
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,520
This was going on the TV.

446
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,520
Wow.

447
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,280
What a school victory.

448
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,280
What a school victory.

449
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:19,240
Although, yeah, similar to Mike, I was sitting there going like, wow, this must be the Disneyland

450
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,280
Castle.

451
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,840
It looks so small.

452
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:28,640
Like, because just growing up in the 90s, you were just bombarded with those flyover,

453
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,480
you know, stock images of the castle in Florida.

454
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,480
Yeah.

455
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,480
Yeah.

456
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,480
So it's teaching you to settle.

457
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,480
Yeah.

458
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,480
Yeah.

459
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:40,760
And then you go like, oh, the Haunted Mansion looks different too.

460
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Yeah.

461
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,840
They do a splash mountain.

462
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:44,840
This was educational.

463
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:45,840
Yes.

464
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,840
Footage for both of you.

465
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:48,840
Yes.

466
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:53,120
And it was, yeah, it was, I guess it wasn't even aspirational because it wasn't a possibility.

467
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,120
Yeah.

468
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,120
It wasn't even, oh, wow.

469
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,120
Yeah.

470
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,120
One day.

471
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,120
No, it was just like, okay, cool.

472
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:02,320
This is like looking at a document from like 300 years ago or something where I go, okay,

473
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,320
great.

474
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,320
I'm glad I have a record of this.

475
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,320
Yeah.

476
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:09,400
When they put a montage of the Indiana Jones ride in like a parade one year, you're like,

477
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,840
Oh, I bet that's nice.

478
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,840
I bet that'd be nice.

479
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:14,840
Must be nice.

480
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,840
I'll never know.

481
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:20,440
So yeah, that's, that's what it was.

482
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:24,480
I mean, in addition to this is, yeah, I didn't realize what a psychological study this is.

483
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,200
I mean, I wasn't, I don't even want to make it.

484
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,840
I was not even a thought.

485
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,120
It wasn't even like I was so upset about it.

486
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,120
I was like, great.

487
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,860
Like, so yeah, I don't even want to make it seem like I was like, oh, I'm begging mom

488
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:35,860
to go there.

489
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:38,400
I just didn't think it made sense.

490
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,040
You weren't invested in yourself.

491
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,280
You didn't believe in yourself.

492
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:45,200
We went to Disney every three or four years.

493
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:49,960
We went to Wisconsin Dells like once and we went to like Galena in Illinois for like a

494
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:52,220
night or two.

495
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:53,760
And now I think we went to Dubuque, Iowa.

496
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:58,500
We ended up in like Dubuque, Iowa for like some small trip and it was like all club three

497
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,500
possibilities.

498
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:03,000
Just wanted to register if you want to put in a vote for Mike's trip to Dubuque.

499
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
If you want.

500
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Yeah.

501
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,320
We took some sort of a boat trip and a lot of it was, I remember it being depressing.

502
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,120
I remember being sad.

503
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:14,520
So, yeah, if you want to, if you want a depressing episode, you just want it might be the episode

504
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,720
we need right now in these dark times.

505
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,720
That's a good point.

506
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:21,640
Like, so yeah, so, so it was just, yeah, it was a fun thing to see at least stuff that

507
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:28,640
looked like Disney World and to see all the favorites, the characters and then enjoy.

508
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:34,080
I would say half the songs, because some of the songs I didn't care about, but it was

509
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,720
enough stuff in there.

510
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:40,000
That was, I would definitely say it was the best of all the sing along song.

511
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Oh, for sure.

512
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,520
Cause I had a few of these.

513
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:49,280
They definitely had a good little like, you know, round up of these sing along song tapes,

514
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:53,320
which if you didn't have them or didn't grow up with them, it's a follow the bouncing

515
00:19:53,320 --> 00:20:00,520
ball situation pioneered by sing along with Mitch, I believe that was the old show that

516
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,520
invented this.

517
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,960
Am I making that up?

518
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:03,960
Sing along with Mitch.

519
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:04,960
I think that's right.

520
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,080
Yes.

521
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,080
No, that's, that's the correct name.

522
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:11,280
I think that was the first follow the bouncing ball situation on television in the fifties,

523
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,280
it seems like.

524
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:14,240
And if you don't know what we're talking about, like they would put the lyrics to a song on

525
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:18,320
the bottom of the screen and then a ball would bounce to basically indicate when you should

526
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:22,520
be singing the line or the word that's on happening at that moment.

527
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,520
I guess.

528
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:30,000
Sort of a karaoke is as popularized in America around the same time, not always a ball.

529
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,960
Sometimes it's the words are lighten up.

530
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:34,880
Sometimes the words are growing one by one.

531
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,560
Sometimes they get real creative with it.

532
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,400
Sometimes they're popping up all the frame.

533
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,120
We see a lot of creative uses of the words in this video.

534
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:46,040
Yeah, it was really exciting watching it develop.

535
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:51,520
Like it was so exciting over there, like a bowling alley footage, like strike, like if

536
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:55,280
you ever saw that, like if you bowl a strike and there's a little CG animated thing.

537
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,280
Oh baby.

538
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,560
I did a whole there's a moonbeam city, but all that shit.

539
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,560
Oh yeah.

540
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,560
Yeah.

541
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,560
Yeah.

542
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,880
And then the local news, the local news graphics develop over time.

543
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:05,880
Mm hmm.

544
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:06,880
Yeah.

545
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:07,880
Yeah.

546
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:12,880
Well, I think I glommed on to anything of that nature and valued them more than anything

547
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,880
with a lot.

548
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:18,160
It's probably warped my brain, my like it being aware I've done a lot of things that

549
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,560
are set in the eighties and nineties.

550
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:23,600
And my biggest issue is like, we've got to get that drop shadow, right?

551
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,840
That thick black drop shadow at the bottom of that yellow text.

552
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:30,920
Cause I see a lot of things meant to be in that era.

553
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:33,800
And sometimes you don't sell that realism without that drop shadow.

554
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,880
And this thing is drop shadow aplenty.

555
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:39,480
Yeah, I know exactly what you're talking about.

556
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:43,760
What's funny now watching these tapes and especially one that's not like this one, I

557
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:49,640
think is probably easily the most budget needed video because they're shooting a lot of original

558
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:53,400
footage, but we've even watching this and then watching the other ones that are just

559
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:56,560
compilations of actual movies and TV stuff.

560
00:21:56,560 --> 00:22:00,400
These are the cheapest made things in the world.

561
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:04,760
And it's so obvious to me now, cause as a kid that doesn't really register.

562
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:08,080
You can kind of tell when something has high production value as a kid, but it doesn't,

563
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:11,400
you don't, it's like not make or break for your enjoyment of something.

564
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:16,360
But to watch them now, you really feel like, Oh God, they were just, we had to get this

565
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,360
done.

566
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,880
We have to shoot this thing.

567
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:24,900
It doesn't look, I mean, it looks, I don't know, worse than like just a regular show

568
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:26,820
on ABC at the time, maybe.

569
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:28,180
Yeah, I'd say so.

570
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,820
It's really, yeah.

571
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:31,980
And it was kind of part of an effort.

572
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:37,140
I feel like to like throughout the seventies and eighties, there's stuff on TV that Disney's

573
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:40,580
doing that's recontextualizing the old movies, putting clips together.

574
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:41,580
Yes.

575
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:46,740
There are all these DTV specials that was their response to MTV.

576
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:51,740
Where can we, I remember watching one a lot that was based on romance was for Valentine's

577
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:52,740
Day.

578
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:58,980
So let's cut a bunch of the Disney movies and shorts into a little romance oriented.

579
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:05,500
Here's a music video for let's hear it for the boy, based on Mickey and Minnie's love.

580
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,500
So there was all that.

581
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:10,900
And then this seems like a next step of like, well, how do we, because we can only release

582
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:13,460
these things so much and get them out of the vault so much.

583
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:15,440
There's a lot of complication with that.

584
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:19,140
So but how do we use this library and crank a lot of shit out of it?

585
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:26,500
They came up with this and which like works like gangbusters for me because like the way

586
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:30,260
kids there's times when you're a dumb kid, you're like, I don't care about that story.

587
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:31,260
I just want the songs.

588
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:32,260
Yes.

589
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:35,380
So a video that's only songs, that's just all hits in a row.

590
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:36,380
Great.

591
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:37,380
Love it.

592
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:38,380
Yeah.

593
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:43,660
I mean, it also in the Disney war book, they go into a little, they were very confused

594
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:47,500
and scared of the VHS market.

595
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:54,540
The first Disney feature VHS's were so expensive because they were so enamored with the idea

596
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:56,620
of the Disney vault.

597
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:59,180
They're like, well, we can't just give this away.

598
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:04,180
When they didn't want it to cut into the reissue, the theatrical reissue market, which was still

599
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:05,180
big.

600
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:06,180
Yeah.

601
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:10,620
And the theatrical releases at all, just being a big moneymaker.

602
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:17,700
And then eventually they, they realized like, oh, the VHS market prints money and we can

603
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:24,060
also just cut up clips and make a new thing kind of similar to how Walt would make little

604
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:29,580
anthology movies with a little live action, a little animation, a little bit of stuff

605
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:32,580
and release that as like a theatrical release.

606
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:33,580
Yeah.

607
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:34,580
Yeah.

608
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:40,900
And boy, this is like one of the most successful, you know, uses of that methodology that I

609
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:46,300
would say the cheapness that you're describing, Mike, I feel like is very evident in the opening

610
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:52,900
song, which it did occur to me to way later that this, this sequence with the owl rushing

611
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:57,980
to the classroom of birds to go teach the, the sing along.

612
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:01,060
So all the wraparounds are with this character, professor owl.

613
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:02,060
Yes.

614
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:03,140
And I don't, I don't know.

615
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:07,140
It must've been way later that I realized that is this pre, that's a preexisting short.

616
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:10,860
That's something from the fifties that is just dubbed over.

617
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:15,380
Even though we all be so much more associated with this sequence, which we all watch so

618
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:16,700
many times on all these videos.

619
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:17,700
I remember that.

620
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:23,980
I don't remember the moment, but I do remember becoming aware of something was up with that

621
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:26,960
because his mouth doesn't quite move right.

622
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:30,080
And then I think maybe even in school and elementary school, someone actually showed

623
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:35,520
us the original fifties, like what they kind of like, they were not, they were not sing

624
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,520
alongs.

625
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:37,760
They were just like educational videos.

626
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,840
So I saw one of them and I went, oh, okay.

627
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:41,840
And then it made sense.

628
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:45,920
I mean, I even remember like watching Ninja Turtles and like, you would start to get,

629
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:51,720
you start to get like a hint that these were not just like, born out of the ground, that

630
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,040
there were errors being made.

631
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:56,880
Cause like you'd see Raphael would be talking and his headband would be purple and you'd

632
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,800
be like, ah, like, and I think you would ignore that.

633
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,920
But like when you're seven or eight or then you're starting to realize, okay, wait, there's

634
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,160
okay. That's a yeah, that's wrong.

635
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,640
Something's off with this.

636
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:14,400
A child's imagination fills in stuff like all the frames that weren't animated, where

637
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,480
they were standing still.

638
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:20,120
And the rest is filled in by like, you know, talking about being an average with graphics

639
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:25,880
and design. I would just stare at video game boxes like the front and the backs, the cards

640
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,440
that action figures came on.

641
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:31,280
Like it was an easy skip to a comic book problem.

642
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,440
It started as a collection.

643
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,520
It's now a problem.

644
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:41,600
So, yeah, the wonkiness very clear now.

645
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,320
I sure love that opening sequence.

646
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:48,600
And it seems like we've talked about this a little bit, but I feel like that the sing

647
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:52,560
along songs opening theme, big influence on your theme song.

648
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,000
Yes. Yeah.

649
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,360
The main theme of the show.

650
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,480
Like a little drum.

651
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:59,640
Yeah. Which is like that's like some Disney drum machine.

652
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,960
It is very 80s.

653
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:08,240
And yes, really like just like, yeah, rigid and digital clearly.

654
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,000
But like very, very energetic.

655
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:13,960
Yeah. Yeah. I always love that that reference point.

656
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:17,120
Really like the song in general.

657
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:18,120
I'm right.

658
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:23,920
Yes.

659
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:26,240
The dunce, the dunce cap bird.

660
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,640
Dumb. They had dubbed over the dunce cap bird.

661
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,600
Most dubbed. The most clearly dubbed.

662
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,600
Very dubbed. Yeah.

663
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,480
They could have dubbed it better, too.

664
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:37,080
Like when you watch it, you go, they could have like really matched it.

665
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:37,640
I feel like.

666
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:41,680
But again, we might be to describe they might have had a day on all this.

667
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:45,240
I'm sure they did get it out with the deal memos they were working with.

668
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,480
They could not have done it better.

669
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,360
That's a good point.

670
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,280
It was a miracle. It got done at all.

671
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,160
Yeah, that's true. Yeah.

672
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,120
That's probably correct.

673
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:57,320
I had never I looked through the credits of this specific sing along songs video.

674
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:01,440
I had never wondered or looked up who did this song.

675
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:06,920
The Disney sing along songs, main theme song, the composer, somebody named

676
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,160
it could be Patrick Derrimer.

677
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,880
It could be Patrick DeRamer.

678
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,360
I don't know if that's a D or a so I'm probably saying it wrong either way.

679
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:18,680
But either regardless, that composer who wrote this song

680
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:23,520
together with a guy named Roy Freeland wrote a little song called I to I

681
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,160
in a goofy movie.

682
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:25,760
Oh, wow.

683
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,040
Same guy to major.

684
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:32,760
Like where Disney got it right, where they're doing 80s drum machine.

685
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,640
Yeah, that's super catchy.

686
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,280
And then 90s New Jack.

687
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,280
Wow. Prince adjacent.

688
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,160
That's so good.

689
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,360
Yeah. Yeah. Never knew that was the same guy.

690
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:46,440
Yeah. Between those two songs, major Disney composer and musician.

691
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:47,840
Yeah, that's great.

692
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,400
I to I, you know, the best.

693
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,480
What do we say?

694
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:54,960
I've tried to unofficially rank Disney songs in general, but it's hard.

695
00:28:54,960 --> 00:29:00,280
You have to put them in little little categories because it's like movie songs,

696
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,040
ride songs.

697
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:08,480
And I think I said what a certain point I declared like I to I and part of their

698
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,760
world are the top two.

699
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,640
Is it part of your world?

700
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,480
I always forget your part of your world.

701
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,320
So yeah.

702
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,360
So those are my top two.

703
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:18,320
And then as far as rides, it's Sinbad.

704
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:22,320
Sinbad song and and and that song.

705
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,240
Yeah, just Sinbad. OK, sure.

706
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,880
No, there's no other.

707
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:30,160
They also the same pair wrote the song Stand Out in Goofy Goofy.

708
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,440
Yeah. Yeah.

709
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:35,600
And also and this guy also wrote all the songs on the totally mini album,

710
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:39,880
which I was not really familiar with.

711
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:42,800
There's a song called Video Active that's pretty.

712
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:43,640
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

713
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,200
All a different video active.

714
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,480
Yeah. Yeah. And I'm trying to think if they play that,

715
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:52,000
because Lindsay, right before the pandemic, we went to a retro night at Disneyland

716
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,360
and it was totally many was there.

717
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:57,920
And it was just we were dancing with many over by the Tomorrowland stage.

718
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,120
To memory to hold to get you through the pandemic.

719
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:04,400
And so and I don't think they played that one.

720
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,760
They definitely played the totally mini theme over and over again.

721
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,480
Yeah. Which is also good.

722
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,600
She might have done. I'm not sure.

723
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,840
Probably worth doing a deep dive into that.

724
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:17,080
That's true. I have one more personnel thing on this video,

725
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:19,120
which I think is interesting.

726
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:23,200
The director of it, Michael Dimich, is his name.

727
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,560
Longtime director for prices, right.

728
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:27,920
And Ellen, don't hold that one against him.

729
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:33,080
But I but the most interesting thing in this guy's body of work,

730
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:37,960
he directed six specials from the master of magic, David Copperfield,

731
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:42,680
including the one where he escapes from a building that implodes,

732
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:45,360
which came up in our implosion.

733
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:50,320
We have previously discussed the directorial work of Michael Dimich.

734
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:54,600
He's he is walking out David Copperfield's one shot escape

735
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:58,520
and then also directing these kids on Splash Mountain

736
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:01,680
and Roger looking scared before he's even on a ride.

737
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,960
Tellable moments in the body of work of this man.

738
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:08,480
So Michael Dimich, the director of everything.

739
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:11,080
There's like a hundred like the more we do this podcast, the more I'm like,

740
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:13,160
oh, there's like a hundred people that we talk about.

741
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:15,400
Yes, like a finite amount of people.

742
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,640
And it's all them all.

743
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,560
But there's like a hundred people.

744
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:21,040
Michael Jackson's involved in everything, too, somehow.

745
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:24,920
And it's a real like I was saying at one point, a real like

746
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:29,040
real building kind of like, yeah, these people were all in the same spot

747
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,760
and just writing these songs.

748
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:31,800
And that was their job.

749
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:34,640
And they probably clocked in and clocked out and then went home.

750
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:35,960
You know, of course. Yeah.

751
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:40,360
Mm hmm. Not knowing that people would be gripping on to these things

752
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,040
for the rest of their lives.

753
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,800
Discussing them in too much detail, as we will do now with the

754
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,080
sing along songs video.

755
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:53,400
I mean, we can sort of step through the through it in order if you want,

756
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:57,440
but also just throw out, you know, if there's just like, I want to get to this.

757
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,440
This is the highlight. Well, yeah, yeah.

758
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,720
Well, I'll say the first thing and I'm repeating myself to some degree

759
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:07,640
is that what I liked about this is that it gave the impression,

760
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:11,080
which I always liked, that the characters worked at Disneyland.

761
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:12,680
Sure. A kid I liked.

762
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,360
I didn't want any humans working there.

763
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:19,080
I wanted my favorite characters to be putting in a nine to five long shift.

764
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,440
Work in the rise, work in the register.

765
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,440
I like I like the idea was completely populated by cartoon characters.

766
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:28,080
And that's sort of what they're indicating in this opening thing

767
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:31,640
when all the characters are basically like cleaning up and preparing

768
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,480
Disneyland for the day.

769
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:36,360
Yeah. To whistle while you work. Right.

770
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,600
And they're literally sweeping,

771
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:41,280
windexing things like shining things.

772
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:44,240
Yeah. Mickey's got like kind of a lab coat on, which.

773
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:47,560
That's an interesting. Yeah. It's not standard Mickey look for sure.

774
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:48,720
Yeah. And I'm not sure.

775
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,600
Yeah. I guess that's like his janitorial.

776
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:53,240
He's not but he's not wearing like a one onesie or anything.

777
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:56,600
Well, he's you know, he's spiffing is what he's doing.

778
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,120
Spick and spanning.

779
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:01,960
He's not I feel like he's not doing the hard clean like the hard rhyme.

780
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:05,600
It's just like let me get a little less bit of polish on that.

781
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,040
So, yeah. So Mickey is not yeah.

782
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:09,760
Mickey is not cleaning up puke from the night before.

783
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:12,840
Mickey is just making sure there's a little like polish on the railings

784
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:15,360
or something. He's he's trying to make

785
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,680
these little touches.

786
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:19,680
He's trying to get that little special touch before people come in.

787
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:23,040
But yeah, all the friends are out. They're all working.

788
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,880
Yeah. And as a kid, it was like this is correct.

789
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:28,160
This is what I want.

790
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:31,960
I don't want humans involved in Disney, Disney World or Disneyland.

791
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,080
Yeah. You don't want them.

792
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:35,360
You don't want Disneyland to be a job provider.

793
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:40,280
No. You want to make you want the grandfathered in characters to be.

794
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:45,240
Yes. To be doing the partners as you if you were total immersion.

795
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:48,760
I mean, I'm sure I said it during when Star Wars and Galaxy's Edge opened

796
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:52,080
and they were saying everything was in universe and people would speak in the

797
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:56,360
in the Batuu local language and say, like, that's what I wanted.

798
00:33:56,360 --> 00:34:00,320
I wanted it to be like everybody worked like they wouldn't acknowledge the real world.

799
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:05,000
So, yeah. So how would that even enter your head that you it was because

800
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:09,360
did this video create the fantasy or before this video, were you thinking,

801
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:15,240
boy, I really hope Donald did all the scrubbing of this Dumbo ride?

802
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:19,160
I don't think I was thinking janitorial work was what I wanted the characters to do.

803
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:23,000
I don't think that was part of it where I was like, I want I want to make sure

804
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,280
that Donald clean these toilets before I use them.

805
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:30,480
I think it was more along the lines of I want complete and total immersion

806
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,840
in Toonland. I want to live in tune.

807
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:36,480
Because when Toon Town was presented as a concept, that was the most

808
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:38,560
I was obsessed with any idea.

809
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:41,600
So I think it was literally just like I would like to live where Darkwing Duck

810
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:44,600
lives, get me out of this real world. Sure.

811
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:48,880
And you kind of get it at the end of the video, too, when they all like turn around

812
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:51,560
and walk towards the castle at the end of the night.

813
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:55,200
Yeah. The carousel, if you pay, if you look closely

814
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:58,320
in at least some of the shots, the carousel is moving.

815
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,320
So, right. Like as if they're like, well, time to hang it up for the night.

816
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,320
Let's go back to where we live. Right.

817
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,680
And I say, right.

818
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:09,360
Gepetto and Pinocchio sleep on the carousel.

819
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:12,400
Yeah. Turn the lights off and

820
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,680
pick a horse to lean against. Sounds good to me.

821
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:18,040
I'd love to be lulled to sleep by a carousel every night.

822
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:21,200
Set it on low. Yeah. Just a slow role.

823
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:24,080
Replace one of the benches with a bed.

824
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:27,960
Oh, I mean, I could price I could probably sleep on that bench.

825
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:30,480
Yeah, I could probably share fetal position on a bench.

826
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:37,760
But yeah, you got Chip and Dale goofing around with the popcorn machine.

827
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,600
Roger. Lotta Roger.

828
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,640
Well, that's when he was one of the core.

829
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:44,040
Yeah. When he was one of the main characters.

830
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:47,160
It's really weird. It's like the how, you know, I might have said this before,

831
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:51,880
but it's like when there was, you know, due to contractual negotiations,

832
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:54,320
that there was like an extra there was a save by the bell person

833
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:57,800
for like six episodes. Yeah. Kind of never showed up again.

834
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:01,360
It is interesting. It's weird when you just forget about a friend.

835
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,480
No longer around. Yeah.

836
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:07,960
And yeah, he's he is treated with just as much respect as the other main.

837
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,880
What? Five, six.

838
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,200
Yeah. The fab.

839
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,000
What do they call them? Six.

840
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,600
Is it the spectacular six?

841
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,400
Is it the spectacular six?

842
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,240
I've never heard that.

843
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:21,200
Like there is there is a Disney wiki entry.

844
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:25,840
I have read about this because it's Mickey, Minnie, Donald, Pluto,

845
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:28,760
since the general sensation and Daisy.

846
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:31,080
But then Chip and Dale are also in the mix.

847
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:34,800
Yeah, I guess they're not in a Pluto's and we might be missing.

848
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,040
Yeah. Pluto's not in the mail, not in the sensational six.

849
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:42,400
So it's Mickey, Minnie, Goofy, Donald, Daisy.

850
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,080
And then who's the last one? Pluto.

851
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:47,160
Oh, Pluto is OK. He's on the six. OK.

852
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:51,920
And this would priorities would kind of change as the company's fortunes would

853
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:54,440
like we're pushing these right now.

854
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:56,520
Or like we bought a greeting card company.

855
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:59,080
Oh, they might buy us like, you know, like

856
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:02,680
the shifting fortunes of the 80s into the 90s.

857
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:07,240
Yeah, that's when they let that Hallmark lady into the cranky old

858
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:09,320
seven cranky old hallmark.

859
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:11,240
I mean, I believe that's right. Yeah.

860
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:15,920
Maxine was briefly in the if you did she have a show Maxine?

861
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,640
I think she did. I believe she did.

862
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:21,760
Or they are pilot might have been a pilot for UPN or something like that.

863
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:27,120
A lot of very interesting and like like all things forgotten or lost.

864
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:30,120
I don't mean good, but interesting.

865
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,560
Maxine, I think, would fall into that.

866
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:35,280
Mm hmm. Did you find three?

867
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,120
There was a special, it seems. OK.

868
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:39,440
Yeah. Seen's Christmas Carol. OK.

869
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:43,160
I've never seen it. She is the Scrooge in this situation.

870
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:45,960
It's like the two prime time far side specials,

871
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:49,520
which at the back of the page a day calendar, they were like,

872
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:54,480
you can buy VHS of these forty dollars, like forty dollars each.

873
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,720
Weird. Yeah.

874
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:58,680
I think maybe I think Tress McNeil may have been.

875
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,200
Oh, wow. Great.

876
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:02,320
Of course. The best of the best, you know.

877
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,560
It's on YouTube. We'll figure it out.

878
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,480
We'll check that out. Could be a club three.

879
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,080
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

880
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:11,440
So so, yeah, I like this.

881
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:14,320
Oh, this is one of my favorite parts as a kid.

882
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:17,520
This opening here, I would say.

883
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,800
And ready. They do a great job.

884
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,480
They do a great job.

885
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:25,280
They're goofing around to they're having some fun doing doing what they're doing.

886
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,680
Well, many setting out a lot of Mickey dolls.

887
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:30,440
Yes. Donald comes in and pushes them all out of the way.

888
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:32,000
It puts a lot of Donald dolls in there.

889
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,880
Yeah. I mean, if we're really going to follow the logic,

890
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:36,520
is this something Donald is doing every day because that is exhausting?

891
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:39,760
It would be exhausting if he's constantly every single day,

892
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,440
every single day, and he's like, oh, damn it.

893
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,800
Yeah. Come on, man. We have the numbers.

894
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:44,880
We have the quarterly numbers.

895
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:48,800
So this guy's so well, but you don't sell. OK.

896
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:54,040
You know what else is nice to see and especially here a little bit,

897
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:57,760
but throughout the special is the 35th anniversary logo.

898
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:00,440
Yeah. Some wonderful neon, some wonderful colors.

899
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:03,120
You can feel the 35th anniversary spirit. Oh, yeah.

900
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:05,280
In the air. Just nice to see.

901
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:08,080
You like to see it after this.

902
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:13,000
You go to the song walking right down the middle of Main Street, USA.

903
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:16,440
Now, even as a kid, minus the profanity,

904
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:18,920
I think my thought was, what the fuck is this song?

905
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,360
I also agree with you. Yeah.

906
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,520
I was like, huh?

907
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:22,680
I don't know this one.

908
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,160
I know whistle while you work.

909
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,880
And then later I know this was written in ghosts.

910
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:27,880
But what is this?

911
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,800
This was maybe fast forward for me.

912
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:32,160
It's always going to hear something from Jason here.

913
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:36,480
Oh, this was a song I totally memory hold until a few years ago.

914
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:41,360
And I was going through some boxes and I found

915
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:47,320
from like 2004, 2005, a two CD set of the soundtrack of Walt Disney World.

916
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:49,880
And that song is on there.

917
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:52,800
And I was like, I was,

918
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:57,680
you know, putting putting the CD, the files on my computer.

919
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,800
I was like listening through them.

920
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:02,040
And I was like, what the fuck is this song?

921
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:04,440
And we're all but everyone's mad at this.

922
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:08,200
So then I had no recollection of this song.

923
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:12,560
Jane was like, yeah, she's like, I have friends who they used to do that.

924
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:15,760
Like they would do that and show or they would do that on Main Street.

925
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:19,000
There'd be singers on Main Street or so or the dapper dance do it.

926
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,760
But this is this is one of the songs and I made a note of this

927
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,760
when I was watching it earlier.

928
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:26,280
This is a perfect song to tap to.

929
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:30,240
And they're like there's tapping going on in the sort of like tap dancing.

930
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,760
I'm talking about. Yeah.

931
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:35,200
And sort of they got the penguins from Mary Poppins involved in this.

932
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,560
And I thought if you had seen this as a kid, Jason,

933
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:40,560
this would have been your favorite because of the tap potential.

934
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:44,840
Mary Poppins was a movie I knew almost entirely

935
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:49,640
from specials and videos like this and stuff.

936
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,600
OK, so you were not Mary Poppins.

937
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,480
I was not a Mary Poppins kid.

938
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,880
I didn't really know what Burt's deal was.

939
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:59,240
I knew the penguins, the penguins were clipped.

940
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:00,560
You know, they were in a lot of stuff.

941
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:01,840
They'd be in. Did you care for that?

942
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:03,800
I mean, what Burt's deal was?

943
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,680
I didn't know who I didn't know his name.

944
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:09,120
I didn't know what his significance was to the movie. Wow.

945
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:12,560
I know. I I guess I knew a little.

946
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:15,360
I knew he was a chimney sweep from the great movie ride.

947
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,800
And I probably knew more that it was Dick Van Dyke

948
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:24,880
because I watched a lot of Dick Van Dyke show on Nick at Night growing up.

949
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:28,280
That's interesting that you didn't manage to remain hidden with all this.

950
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:29,560
You're interested from every angle.

951
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:32,360
And he has like he's got the stuff you like the straw hat.

952
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:35,720
They like suit. Yeah. Like you with any taps and stuff.

953
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,560
Yeah, that's interesting.

954
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:40,600
I know. I think I was also confused as a kid of like,

955
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:43,440
why does Mary Poppins in the park?

956
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,880
She's always like in this all white ensemble.

957
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:50,120
But like in clips, sometimes she's in the more like utilitarian garb.

958
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,200
You didn't. But you didn't.

959
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:54,680
She's wearing that when she's in the side when they're in the sidewalk.

960
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:58,800
Yeah, because he's got the full like kind of colorful outfit.

961
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,960
But I just kind of knew the broad strokes.

962
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:04,600
I didn't really know why. How she knows the penguins.

963
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:06,520
I didn't know what the kids deal was.

964
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:09,360
You were like, if only there was a way to learn any of the way.

965
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,200
But I wasn't interested enough.

966
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:13,320
I didn't care. No, I didn't.

967
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:16,760
I think because I would in the early days of the Disney Channel,

968
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:19,600
which we caught a lot, eventually my family paid for it.

969
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:23,080
But we would watch a lot of it when it's like free Disney Channel weekend.

970
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:25,720
Like the cable provider would give it to you for a few days.

971
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:29,520
And I would watch some of the live action Disney movies and go like,

972
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:31,880
Oh, what is this? I don't like this.

973
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:34,440
Now, now you say this, I do remember because I remember you said

974
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:38,480
I didn't get Mary Poppins until I saw the top scene from Mary Poppins.

975
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,240
I do remember this now. Yes.

976
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:41,920
You said that.

977
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:44,640
Now I now I get Mary Poppins, I believe is what you said.

978
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:48,480
Now we're not I'm not in the business of taking topics away

979
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:51,880
from the Club 3 possibility, but well, I'm not.

980
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:55,600
I'm also not going to encourage any further content about tops

981
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,240
or turning turtle the song Topsy sings.

982
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:04,160
I would put that in the umbrella of what I'm not going to advocate for.

983
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:06,840
But I think it's you know, while we are leaving this to the audience,

984
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:09,440
I think there is I think we should be able to sort of like

985
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:12,000
campaign for. Yeah, yeah.

986
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,800
Things that were, you know, we were like, we can.

987
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:16,760
We can endorse, right?

988
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:19,280
Now we can put out our our voting guide.

989
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:21,000
Oh, right. Right. Right.

990
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,800
Interesting. A lot of righted votes for Pinocchio 2022.

991
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:28,480
Oh, no, no.

992
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,560
So so, Jason, if you're assessing it now

993
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:36,000
with your current love of old timey song and dance,

994
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:37,400
do you like this song?

995
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:40,000
Did you like the number that happens?

996
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,080
Yeah, yeah, I did like it. OK.

997
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:45,840
I mean, I watched Mary Poppins in its completion as an adult,

998
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:48,440
like in its full runtime.

999
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:49,360
And I liked it.

1000
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:53,040
You didn't you didn't bail with three minutes to know I didn't bail.

1001
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:57,440
I didn't split it up like the value was still like bracing myself

1002
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,960
for the two or three sittings to watch the Batman.

1003
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:01,680
Oh, yeah. It's long. Yeah.

1004
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:02,960
Oh, yeah. Very long.

1005
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:05,440
I think I might have tried one and then falling asleep.

1006
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:10,280
Well, I also someone I forget maybe it was Paul of Tonkin's posted a photo

1007
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:13,440
trying to watch it at like noon, like with daylight.

1008
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:15,720
And it's just you can't.

1009
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:18,160
Oh, yes. Any reflection in your. Yeah.

1010
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:22,200
Too hard. Unless you live in a cave. Yeah. Like Batman.

1011
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:27,960
So so, yeah, yeah, there's there's tapping penguins.

1012
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:31,120
And I I appreciate it more now as an adult.

1013
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:34,960
But for me as a kid, I was like, if I was getting the like a bridged version

1014
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:36,680
of this tape, I would kind of go, oh, right.

1015
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:38,400
Fast forward. Yeah. Yeah.

1016
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:41,480
Because I want to see some rides, first of all, which you don't get to see.

1017
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:45,720
I know. OK. To answer the question, what the fuck is this song?

1018
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:46,840
I looked it up. Oh, yeah.

1019
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:48,400
This is according to the credits.

1020
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:52,600
It's written by somebody named Stu Nunnery, one of the great names.

1021
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:57,760
And it was written for initially for, I guess, a 30th anniversary

1022
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:02,120
special in 1985 and originally performed by Marie Osmond.

1023
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:06,520
So you could sort of feel the Osmond ishness.

1024
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:11,320
Yeah. In it, I would say she's kind of a sort of a real life

1025
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:14,640
Mary Poppins in Vibe and Ash.

1026
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:17,960
In the three seconds that I watched of the

1027
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:22,440
of the Marie Osmond version before realizing no one has asked me to do this.

1028
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:24,400
Yeah, you don't need to stop watching whenever I want.

1029
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,120
I am free will. That's a good point.

1030
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,720
Goofy is a cop in this sequence.

1031
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:33,000
Goofy has changed into a bobby.

1032
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,760
I don't know why he's a bobby, like an English.

1033
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,400
Well, the British, because they're on main.

1034
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:41,200
They're on Main Street USA.

1035
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:44,400
Yeah. But Mary and Bert are British, I guess.

1036
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:46,760
Bert's not well British.

1037
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:48,440
Well, no, I guess they're both British.

1038
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:50,480
So you're saying that that's the logic.

1039
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:53,200
I think because of them.

1040
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:56,920
So that's why Goofy, they they're forcing Goofy to dress as a policeman

1041
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:59,280
from their land. I don't really know.

1042
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:00,880
I don't know. Yeah, I know.

1043
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:02,680
They're dressing up.

1044
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:03,560
They're all having fun.

1045
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:05,520
Yeah, they're all forced to do anything.

1046
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:09,680
They threaten Goofy into dressing up like a policeman from their time.

1047
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:11,960
But I think Mary Poppins Bert did.

1048
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:14,680
I don't know. I mean, that's what Jason's that's Jason's

1049
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:17,600
theory. I'm saying me.

1050
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:19,040
Goofy might just be playing on now.

1051
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:20,280
The penguins might be forced.

1052
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:24,240
I don't think the penguins are not indigenous to the British Isles, I think.

1053
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:26,280
So God knows what they're on the sidewalk.

1054
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:28,240
Yeah, they're kind of made up.

1055
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:32,680
Yeah, they're forced to exist like Forky by being drawn.

1056
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:36,360
Right. So I guess there's, you know, free will is in question.

1057
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:37,640
Yeah. In general.

1058
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:38,640
So they would prefer.

1059
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:42,600
So Goofy is just having fun in their universe, I guess.

1060
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:45,760
I think so. Goofy, if you're in trouble,

1061
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:49,240
you're being made to put on clothes you don't want to wear.

1062
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:53,560
And if you're listening, if one of the inaugural subscribers

1063
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:57,400
to Club Three is Goofy, let us know if you're OK.

1064
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:59,600
Send us a DM. Yeah, who knows?

1065
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:02,440
But yeah, that struck me is a little odd.

1066
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:06,600
Also, Pluto is wearing a mustache, wearing a big curly mustache.

1067
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:11,360
Yeah. He looks like a like a barber or something, like an old timey barber.

1068
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:12,920
Yeah. In that sequence.

1069
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,720
Mm hmm. So I hope he wasn't for, you know, it's tough to get a

1070
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:20,160
I have to get a dog to wear anything.

1071
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:23,680
Yeah. Really a lot of some dogs are perfectly willing.

1072
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:27,120
But right. Putting a mustache on your dog, I imagine is tough.

1073
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:31,240
I'd like every to wear fake mustaches as often as possible.

1074
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:33,160
But I think they're going to shake those things off.

1075
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:34,360
Yeah, no, for sure.

1076
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:36,720
So Pluto seems to be enjoying himself.

1077
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:38,560
Mm hmm. Yeah, as far as I can tell.

1078
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:42,440
I stopped enjoying myself after this because it went into a song

1079
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:48,080
called Follow the Leader, which is from not my favorite of the movies.

1080
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:52,080
There's there's there's a little bit of face character pan in this tape.

1081
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:55,960
Yeah. And I forget exactly sparingly, thankfully.

1082
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:57,480
But he looks very old.

1083
00:47:57,560 --> 00:48:01,680
Mm hmm. The pan actor they have here in this looks like he's

1084
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:05,800
he's probably not 40, but he looks 40 because usually they find somebody

1085
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:08,800
who is a very boyish young look for pan.

1086
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:12,720
But whoever the pan actor in this was definitely like pushing for it.

1087
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:17,360
I think maybe, you know, maybe I prefer that in a way because.

1088
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:21,160
All right. So a lot of people sent me the pan,

1089
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:26,520
the villain in Chip and Dale movie and like, wonder what Scott thinks is.

1090
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:30,680
My reaction is blotless scared of him than the than the regular pan.

1091
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:33,640
I'm creeped out by the forever boy.

1092
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:35,560
I'm glad he grew up.

1093
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:38,200
I'm rooting for this pan.

1094
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:40,640
Not maybe not against Chip and Dale, but I like it.

1095
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:42,640
So, all right, he's finally age appropriate.

1096
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:45,640
I don't know. I as long as he's not a forever boy.

1097
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:49,360
Again, I've said I think I've said hook.

1098
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:53,400
I like because I like hook before he went on the adventure.

1099
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:55,800
I say stay on that big cell phone.

1100
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:59,040
Peter Banning, you have a good job.

1101
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:01,640
So yeah, yeah.

1102
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:04,960
So you like the 40 year old pan and now somebody's going to.

1103
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:09,880
It's not it's not go with like, but I yeah, but may prefer.

1104
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:14,360
Prefer to the there's nothing he says to Chip and Dale that is worse than like,

1105
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:17,920
you're just a damn girl.

1106
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:20,280
And that real pan, yeah.

1107
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:22,600
Frightening, cloying stuff.

1108
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:25,880
Yeah. Did you, Scott, let me ask, did you see hook in theaters?

1109
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:30,560
I did. Remember funny story, but this might actually be this might unlock

1110
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:36,360
a little something genetically about my my predisposal to to not liking pan.

1111
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:41,240
But it might run in the family because we were sitting in the movie theater

1112
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:44,680
watching it and then my dad got violently ill.

1113
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:47,040
Oh, my. And like, we got to go. I got to go.

1114
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:49,720
And I think it was blamed that he really he stopped drinking soda

1115
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:52,600
at some point in time, realized it gave him a horrible migraines.

1116
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:53,920
And he pinned it on that.

1117
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:56,280
But for a long time and to this day, I have the theory

1118
00:49:56,480 --> 00:50:00,120
that he faked this in order to not have to watch hook anymore.

1119
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:03,400
Wow. He may have snapped at some point.

1120
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:06,160
Because I remember the intermission.

1121
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:11,520
I remember mission of hook hook was long enough that at least at the AMC

1122
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:15,200
by the mall that my family went to, there was a timid intermission.

1123
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:19,960
Well, halfway through, so everyone could get more snacks or use the bathroom.

1124
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:24,720
I also remember being very excited, going through toy stores

1125
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:26,480
and seeing a lot of hook toys.

1126
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:29,040
So that was a real hook Christmas.

1127
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:32,680
I had a raft. I had pan and hook. Wow.

1128
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:35,200
My brother had Rufio.

1129
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:37,480
Is that his name? Yes.

1130
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:40,200
Yeah, we were we were all in on the pan.

1131
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:42,200
Wow. A very hook Christmas.

1132
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:43,920
I never saw it in the theater.

1133
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:45,160
I didn't see it a couple of years ago.

1134
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:48,960
I think I may have completed a viewing ultimately with a different parent

1135
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:50,480
or someone else's parent.

1136
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:52,800
But I really do think my dad is like, I can't.

1137
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,800
Wow. I cannot do this anymore.

1138
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:57,160
Honey, I wonder.

1139
00:50:57,160 --> 00:50:58,800
I feel like I've asked and he's denied it.

1140
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:00,760
He's not that bad.

1141
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:02,000
No. It's OK.

1142
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:06,080
Yes. Great actors like a great great actors for sure. Yes.

1143
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:10,920
Hey, there is a there are people out there who find hook unpleasant.

1144
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:13,920
Yeah, I would still I would call myself one of those.

1145
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:18,480
Yeah, I really like that might be my first memory of like, you know,

1146
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:22,280
a movie where like at the very end, the character gets the suit

1147
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:25,680
and the powers and the sword like gets all the stuff. Yeah.

1148
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:30,560
And I remember seeing like movies marketed at like the whole family

1149
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:33,400
or more adult audience where I'm like, let's get to the

1150
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:36,040
let's get Spider-Man in the suit.

1151
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:38,840
You know, let's get to business. You know? Yeah.

1152
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:42,240
So, yeah, when I saw it, I didn't have any nostalgia for it

1153
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:43,880
other than just seeing commercials.

1154
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:48,440
And I remember being unnerved by the idea of the food, the colored food fight,

1155
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:52,920
like the brightly colored whatever group goop they throw at each other.

1156
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:55,960
I love the all the big food and then it's nothing.

1157
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:58,000
And then, you know, it's all in their mind. Sure.

1158
00:51:58,080 --> 00:51:59,920
I mean, I guess I appreciate that now.

1159
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:01,800
But yeah, watching it as adults and do it.

1160
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:04,760
I like I like going back and watching some of this stuff that as a kid.

1161
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:07,640
And I've said this about horror movies and stuff where you go back

1162
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:09,520
and you remember like, I'm not going to see that.

1163
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:11,320
I'll never see it. And then I go back and watch it.

1164
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:13,400
And I wanted to like it.

1165
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:16,040
I just watched Bram Stoker's Dracula for the first time ever.

1166
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:18,320
Oh, really, really good. That's awesome.

1167
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:19,680
So much good stuff.

1168
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:21,760
That's a that's an awesome.

1169
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:24,040
Yeah, you really it's like, oh, it's a movie.

1170
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:25,360
It's like sets.

1171
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:27,760
Is it a thing meant to terrify me?

1172
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:30,200
This is there's like a ridiculous ridiculous.

1173
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:33,680
And it's like it may as well just be like a bad Tim Burton

1174
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:36,960
Batman movie or something like it's just every actor is chewing the scenery.

1175
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:38,800
I really like it.

1176
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:39,680
That does that count?

1177
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:41,240
Do we talk about follow the leader?

1178
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:42,360
I think so. Hey, great. Yes.

1179
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:44,960
He really did.

1180
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:45,840
He really do.

1181
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:49,680
He like I didn't know I couldn't figure out what it was at first

1182
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:53,440
because they sing so much of the like just nonsense.

1183
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:54,600
Then he says following the lead.

1184
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:56,560
I was like, oh, right. This song. Yeah. Yeah.

1185
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:58,840
I was a pan kid, a Peter Pan kid.

1186
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:01,040
So I was a little pan boy.

1187
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:02,640
But now you're a pan man.

1188
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:04,400
Oh, no, no.

1189
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:07,760
I wouldn't say I'm a pan man, but I certainly was a little pan boy.

1190
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:11,320
I loved Peter Pan and it was right.

1191
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:15,960
Look, I'm not I can't start censoring here, but a few times

1192
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:18,840
we could say little blank boy

1193
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:22,240
love this phrase to be eliminated across all the gates.

1194
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:23,000
Really? All right.

1195
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:26,400
I remember being a little unnerved by the Tinkerbell stuff.

1196
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:30,000
Like there's a Tinkerbell like I'm dying or like, why did you leave me behind?

1197
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,160
Like the Julia Roberts stuff? Yes.

1198
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:35,840
I think she's watching it as an adult.

1199
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:37,440
I'm like, this is really upset.

1200
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:38,200
Yes. Yeah.

1201
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:40,520
That's the core of my dislike.

1202
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:44,640
And when he's looking at his his reflection of like, well, that's the.

1203
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:47,920
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I don't disagree with a lot of the things you're saying

1204
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:51,560
about pan, but as a kid, I didn't notice any of that.

1205
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:53,360
And I like the idea of flying

1206
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:56,160
and I like the idea of sword fighting Captain Hook. Mm hmm.

1207
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:57,280
So, yeah.

1208
00:53:58,560 --> 00:53:59,120
So that's that.

1209
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:00,560
I guess that we can.

1210
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:02,640
So that summarizes the fatherly.

1211
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:05,600
The thing we all like to the great outdoors.

1212
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:08,920
Right. The country bears from vacation.

1213
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:10,000
Hoedown, right.

1214
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,880
Which, yeah, great afterwards, I didn't know this song.

1215
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:15,120
Yeah, we talked about how we thought this.

1216
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:19,680
I was like, this is the primary hit of the country bears, as far as I knew,

1217
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:23,240
from this tape, didn't realize it was just in the seasonal one. Right.

1218
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:25,400
Yeah, I didn't know. I couldn't have explained any of that.

1219
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:27,760
Now, as a kid, I've said this before, I was not.

1220
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:28,960
I like the country bears.

1221
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:31,000
I was not way, way into them as a kid.

1222
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:36,960
But this part actually unnerved me a little bit because of the bizarre costumes

1223
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:40,880
where there appears to be holes in the country bears necks.

1224
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:43,440
Yes. And I do remember to.

1225
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:48,120
I remember that being weird, like they had like a trach ring or whatever.

1226
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:49,200
Like they smoked too much.

1227
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:51,400
Yeah. The woman in the scary smoking commercial.

1228
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:53,400
Yeah. And it just it's odd.

1229
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:58,840
And I remember it sticking out to me as a kid and not like I like the sequence.

1230
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:00,360
I like the running around.

1231
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:04,320
But the bears were a little scary to me as a kid.

1232
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:08,480
Yeah. And they're like they're already kind of crazy eyed and have

1233
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:11,600
sharp teeth. And yeah.

1234
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:12,840
And I don't think those.

1235
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:15,720
So yeah, to describe what we're talking about, if you haven't seen this, is that

1236
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:20,960
the bears are the two bears, I guess there's three of them, two of them are tall.

1237
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:25,920
So there's like kind of a, I guess, a spot for the performative see out of.

1238
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:29,640
This is a very this is definitely a format of costume that I feel like they've gotten

1239
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:34,000
better at doing is like they need to be taller than a person is probably going to be.

1240
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,560
We can get in this suit. Yeah.

1241
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:37,800
We hide where the eyes are.

1242
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:40,200
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, sort of like Big Bird.

1243
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:43,760
Yes. In a way, Big Bird much taller than Carol Spinney.

1244
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:48,000
Yes. So so yeah, there's like this weird hole in the bears necks.

1245
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:50,120
Like a scrim. Right.

1246
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:52,080
And it looks weird. Yeah.

1247
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:54,840
It's it's very unnerving.

1248
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:58,240
So whenever there's a close up on them, that's that's.

1249
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:01,120
I was like having the memory of like, oh, yeah, oh, yeah.

1250
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:04,440
What is that? Like as a kid being really preoccupied,

1251
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:07,720
because that's that's the funny thing about being kid, as you know,

1252
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:11,080
a certain age, obviously, you know, it's not real.

1253
00:56:11,560 --> 00:56:14,360
But then you start to notice the like the logistics of it.

1254
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:18,320
You would notice like if somebody was getting to see you through

1255
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:22,320
like the snout of the character and not the eyes, you could start to pick up on that.

1256
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:27,360
But this is a glaring example of seeing the reality of what's going on.

1257
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:28,920
And I didn't want to deal with that.

1258
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:30,200
I don't want to deal with that reality.

1259
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:33,440
Scary. They should just framed it out if they could have or blurred it.

1260
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:35,120
Give them the neckerchief necker.

1261
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:36,960
Like they were already wearing like bandanas.

1262
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:39,120
That's the issue. So they can see.

1263
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:43,240
Well, what's the they got to fix CGI or some early CGI?

1264
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:45,240
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1265
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:46,960
Well, they didn't. They're there and they're there.

1266
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:47,800
And they look scary.

1267
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:52,000
They they run around and kind of bump into real guests, it seems like.

1268
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:53,160
Because they get their go.

1269
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:57,920
They're running around Tom Sawyer Island and they go run around the fort

1270
00:56:58,160 --> 00:56:59,720
and go up the stairs and down the stairs.

1271
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:03,320
And they bump into people who genuinely look like the hell is that?

1272
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:08,800
I don't. It seems like they like certainly they brought in a group of here's the kids

1273
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:12,400
and here's the older couple that we follow throughout the tape.

1274
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:16,040
But they definitely film just regular folks in the park.

1275
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:17,160
Yeah. Throughout this video.

1276
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:20,240
I think what happened is the newer like Shaker outfit.

1277
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:23,280
I think it's you can see out of his mouth

1278
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:26,000
because he doesn't have the hole anymore.

1279
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,320
I see there's no hole in the neck.

1280
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:32,440
So I think they figured that figured that that was unnerving, too.

1281
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:35,680
So it looks like the performer inside the costume now

1282
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:39,240
can probably just see maybe out of his mouth.

1283
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:41,240
Hmm. Well, good.

1284
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:43,840
So they fixed that issue.

1285
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:45,560
Here's something I will admit.

1286
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:49,800
We did all those country bear episodes now that it's it's been about six months.

1287
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:54,720
Almost since we did it, I was like, could I name these bears?

1288
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:58,360
Not one don't know that information is out of my really.

1289
00:57:58,360 --> 00:58:00,880
Yep. I don't. Who are the three? Who are these bears?

1290
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:04,920
The one Wendell one is when the shorter one is Wendell Shaker.

1291
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:07,560
Oh, because the kids all say, ah, Shaker.

1292
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:10,160
Yeah. And then liver lips is the other one.

1293
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:12,120
So there's those there are the three.

1294
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:14,200
OK, gotcha. But you didn't know any of them.

1295
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:17,760
Nope. Interesting that it I equate it to like

1296
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:19,720
I'm traveling to Italy.

1297
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:22,160
Maybe I should learn a little bit of Italian a couple of months later.

1298
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:23,800
Gone. All out of there.

1299
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:26,920
No, I cannot retain information as an adult.

1300
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,600
The five bear rugs, I would understand you maybe not knowing,

1301
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:32,000
but these are three of the most iconic bears.

1302
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:32,960
Don't know. Didn't know.

1303
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:36,080
How many can you name other than these three?

1304
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:37,880
I mean, you walked into this.

1305
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:39,520
I'm just curious what you retained.

1306
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:41,880
I forgot most of the stuff we talked about on the show.

1307
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:43,320
I'm just curious. Yeah.

1308
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:46,000
Can Zeb. That's in the song. Yeah.

1309
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:48,760
And do I know the kids name?

1310
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:52,160
The little one, the Daniel Tiger.

1311
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:55,960
That's good. That's the tiger.

1312
00:58:55,960 --> 00:58:58,160
OK. All right. Just bear bear one of them.

1313
00:58:58,360 --> 00:59:02,560
No, no, no. There's a bear from the edge.

1314
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:04,680
The bear. There's one. The bear bear.

1315
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:06,800
Anthony Hopkins with the part, the bear.

1316
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:08,080
All right. It's out of your head.

1317
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:09,800
I mean, I got believe me, we're 100 percent.

1318
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:14,200
We could all be quizzed on a lot of stuff from this podcast and fail miserably.

1319
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:16,840
Yeah. Forgotten more than I ever knew.

1320
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:21,720
But I even later, you know, at the start of adolescence,

1321
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:25,680
when most of me and my friends spent most of our time quoting The Simpsons,

1322
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:28,040
I could never get the lines were perfect.

1323
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:32,320
I could never like some kids could nail like Simpsons references.

1324
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:35,040
And I always just got like just enough.

1325
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:37,360
Or just the gist.

1326
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:39,360
Like, I just can't like there's stuff in my.

1327
00:59:39,360 --> 00:59:43,440
And really, when they got they started to lean harder on like the way

1328
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:46,480
the episode starts is not the meat of the episode.

1329
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:49,880
You know, it's not the main event of the episode.

1330
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:53,680
Uh huh. So that I could never remember.

1331
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:58,720
I could never remember like stuff unless it was like Homer was going to get a free

1332
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:02,680
boat, like unless it was funny in itself that Homer had to go get a free one,

1333
01:00:02,680 --> 01:00:05,120
a free boat. He has to report to the police station.

1334
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:10,320
So you're you have like a distinctive memory of not being able to be able to like

1335
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:12,040
explain Simpson plots.

1336
01:00:12,680 --> 01:00:15,520
Um, yeah, I can't on the plots.

1337
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:17,480
I have a pretty visual memory.

1338
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:20,600
Like sometimes when I have to memorize scripts and stuff,

1339
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:24,760
like as I'm doing the scenes, I can picture the script almost like a teleprompter

1340
01:00:24,760 --> 01:00:25,440
in my head.

1341
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:27,320
What color are the Simpsons?

1342
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:28,800
Huh? What color are the Simpsons?

1343
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:29,920
Yellow like my highlighters.

1344
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:30,520
You got it.

1345
01:00:30,520 --> 01:00:31,600
Nice. My highlighters.

1346
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:32,960
See, that's super visual.

1347
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:33,360
Yeah.

1348
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:35,880
Marge's hair quick.

1349
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:38,560
Uh, shit.

1350
01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:40,120
Now you blow it to clock 10.

1351
01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:42,280
Depends on if it was licensed or unlicensed.

1352
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:46,640
Marge blue was specifically owned.

1353
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:47,560
Yeah.

1354
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:52,960
Um, but yeah, look, this is a delightful sequence though.

1355
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:54,040
And it's nice to hear.

1356
01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:57,120
I wanted to, cause I wanted to hear those park specifics later.

1357
01:00:57,120 --> 01:01:01,240
You get grip in and goes, there's not a lot of park specific songs or ones that

1358
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:05,360
like, you know, will work for a mass audience, uh, on this tape for kids.

1359
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:08,120
So nice to hear a country bear original in here.

1360
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:12,880
And a place I remember, like I could run around that fort for like hours.

1361
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:13,440
Yeah.

1362
01:01:13,720 --> 01:01:14,960
Which I'm sure drove my parents.

1363
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:17,280
That was a moment of like, we've paid a lot of money.

1364
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:18,480
We got to go on some rides.

1365
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:22,280
So, you know, and also it was a pain in the ass to ride a raft over here.

1366
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:24,040
Yeah, that's the biggest stop.

1367
01:01:24,040 --> 01:01:27,280
So I know I want to get the kiddo over there, but like that, yeah, that raft is

1368
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:30,080
going to be the bit like, he's not going to wait for the raft and then

1369
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:31,240
you're going on the raft.

1370
01:01:31,240 --> 01:01:34,200
And you know, what's funny is I'm watching, I was watching the sequence and then I

1371
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:39,960
was like, I had just been on the grizzly challenge trail a few days prior and, uh,

1372
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:45,080
with a friend and his child, uh, his young child and, uh, the employee

1373
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:47,080
encouraged all of us to go down the slide and we did.

1374
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:48,080
Oh yeah.

1375
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:49,280
And I was like, hell yeah.

1376
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:50,720
An excuse to go down the slide.

1377
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:55,360
I may have said, I don't know if I said on the show, maybe one of the top

1378
01:01:55,360 --> 01:01:58,160
five happiest I've ever seen my son.

1379
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:00,040
He just exploded.

1380
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:02,160
True, true magic.

1381
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:03,400
It was really nice to see.

1382
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:07,600
Yes, that's what happened with a friend's kid as well.

1383
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:11,440
So it happened with, and it happened with a older kid.

1384
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:17,640
That's what it's, that's Walt's dream in action.

1385
01:02:17,640 --> 01:02:18,400
That's right.

1386
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:25,680
Um, well then we go to the, uh, now look, we don't like the, what this song is

1387
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:28,360
from, but it's sure fun though.

1388
01:02:28,360 --> 01:02:30,200
And this isn't it with the rap.

1389
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:31,720
We can retain the rap.

1390
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:32,400
Can't we?

1391
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:34,640
The rap rap is the rap only.

1392
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:35,200
Yes.

1393
01:02:35,240 --> 01:02:35,880
All right.

1394
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:41,600
Just, just get rid of Zippity doo da, but the rap portion, I think you can reclaim.

1395
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:42,080
Yeah.

1396
01:02:42,080 --> 01:02:44,480
Well, you know, in a different era.

1397
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:45,080
Yeah.

1398
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:45,760
Yeah.

1399
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:48,120
So it is a thrill when you go downhill.

1400
01:02:48,280 --> 01:02:51,320
So yeah, if you don't want to talk about, yeah, Zippity doo da, uh, on the

1401
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:53,840
on splash mountain from the song of the South.

1402
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:58,000
Uh, yes, this ride opened in the eighties with Roger Abbott.

1403
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,080
They got their, their new leading man.

1404
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:05,160
They got the song from their brand spanking new ride.

1405
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:07,680
They're super immediately popular ride.

1406
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:08,320
Yes.

1407
01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:11,400
And then, and then it's just a like blitz through the park.

1408
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:13,840
Honestly, you see a lot of rides very quickly.

1409
01:03:13,840 --> 01:03:17,920
It's kind of the thrill rides section is the, is the idea here.

1410
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:23,840
And I liked this as a kid because it was my assumption that I would not ever

1411
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:26,320
go on any of these rides.

1412
01:03:26,360 --> 01:03:30,400
And quite frankly, I felt brave just for watching this sequence.

1413
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:31,360
Oh, sure.

1414
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:36,040
I had to get the grid up to even look at a simulation of going on.

1415
01:03:36,040 --> 01:03:36,440
Yes.

1416
01:03:36,520 --> 01:03:36,760
Yeah.

1417
01:03:36,760 --> 01:03:38,880
I took, it took me, I would be interested.

1418
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:39,320
I don't know.

1419
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:40,600
I don't know the answer to this.

1420
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:43,840
I don't know when I went on this for the first time, cause it certainly wasn't

1421
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:45,280
when it was first opened.

1422
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:48,480
It took me a long time in my mind to go on this.

1423
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:52,200
I don't, it might've been when I was like, whatever, 13 or might've been like

1424
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:54,320
96, maybe it was 12 or 13 splash.

1425
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:54,760
My excuse me.

1426
01:03:55,120 --> 01:03:55,520
Yeah.

1427
01:03:55,600 --> 01:03:59,360
So, so, but I didn't, we were definitely there when it had opened and I was like,

1428
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:02,040
no way, not a chance.

1429
01:04:02,560 --> 01:04:03,640
Why would I do this?

1430
01:04:04,760 --> 01:04:09,200
So yeah, seeing, seeing this, yeah, I think I had a similar feeling of like,

1431
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:13,440
okay, but this like maybe didn't even enjoy it because it stressed me out.

1432
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:17,000
The idea of going down it, because when you're a kid, you're just like, Oh, that

1433
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:18,600
log is going to tip over.

1434
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:22,480
Like you were believing the reality of it where you're like, I'm the logs and

1435
01:04:22,520 --> 01:04:26,440
tip over into those like thorns that was the thorn bush.

1436
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:28,200
You thought it was just going to roll.

1437
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:28,640
Yeah.

1438
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:30,000
Of course I did.

1439
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:34,520
Like I bought the reality that you were going over a waterfall and that you were

1440
01:04:34,520 --> 01:04:36,880
going to wrap it, that you go splish splash.

1441
01:04:36,920 --> 01:04:37,600
Exactly.

1442
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:42,960
So, so the, even though cool rap version didn't sway me into thinking, ease you

1443
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:43,920
into this idea.

1444
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:44,160
Yeah.

1445
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:48,120
This was something I was going to do until when I was older.

1446
01:04:48,520 --> 01:04:52,320
Roger only ramps up the fear because this is, this is an indelible part of it.

1447
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:52,800
Yeah.

1448
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:57,840
It's a tight on Roger going, no, slow down, slow down.

1449
01:04:57,920 --> 01:04:59,000
I remember that too.

1450
01:04:59,040 --> 01:05:00,680
He's not even on the ride yet.

1451
01:05:00,840 --> 01:05:01,240
Yeah.

1452
01:05:01,240 --> 01:05:01,360
Yeah.

1453
01:05:01,360 --> 01:05:03,680
He's and he has a stressful voice.

1454
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:08,760
So he's only adding to the anxiety as he watching this as a kid going, Oh, yeah.

1455
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:13,040
Cause just, I'm sure it was my first time seeing what would be a, a very

1456
01:05:13,040 --> 01:05:14,760
steep drop on a ride.

1457
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:17,840
And as you, when you're a kid, you're imagining that's a night, like that's

1458
01:05:17,840 --> 01:05:19,040
completely straight down.

1459
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:19,800
It's not.

1460
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:21,120
It's how it was portrayed.

1461
01:05:21,120 --> 01:05:22,120
But that's how it's portrayed.

1462
01:05:22,320 --> 01:05:22,680
Sure.

1463
01:05:22,680 --> 01:05:22,960
Yeah.

1464
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:28,240
So yeah, this, I'm sure this video did more harm as far as keeping me off of

1465
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:29,800
thrill rides than good.

1466
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:30,600
Yeah.

1467
01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:34,040
I mean, I think this is one where the marketing just worked on me.

1468
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:36,680
Like I saw so much about splash mountain.

1469
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:40,200
Well, you're like, I can't wait till I'm big enough and brave enough to see what

1470
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:43,960
this is all about, but you were the bravest of the three, according to stories.

1471
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,000
I was terrified.

1472
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,800
I was unreasonably terrified of going upside down.

1473
01:05:48,440 --> 01:05:53,200
I finally did it on some like smaller coaster, the Jersey shore.

1474
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:55,320
And then I was like, okay, well, I didn't die.

1475
01:05:55,560 --> 01:05:56,480
I didn't fall out.

1476
01:05:56,840 --> 01:05:58,360
We get stuck upside down.

1477
01:05:58,360 --> 01:06:01,880
Maybe that was one of the fears that I would see local news stories every

1478
01:06:01,880 --> 01:06:05,040
time then of like roller coaster stuck upside down for two hours.

1479
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:11,560
But yeah, I mean, I'm a lot like even with scary movies and stuff, it was like

1480
01:06:11,560 --> 01:06:16,240
the marketing that, that was like, Oh, come and do this cool, scary thing.

1481
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:17,560
No way.

1482
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:17,960
Yeah.

1483
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:21,000
You need to make this thing seem so nice and pleasant.

1484
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:23,280
You need to trick me and he's to go the other way.

1485
01:06:23,640 --> 01:06:26,960
So it was like, now as an adult, I understand that like, Oh, you get to

1486
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:30,320
watch a scary movie and you like wince and you cover your eyes for part.

1487
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:30,840
I get that.

1488
01:06:30,840 --> 01:06:31,800
That makes sense to me.

1489
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:32,440
Horror nights.

1490
01:06:32,440 --> 01:06:33,520
Now it makes sense to me.

1491
01:06:33,640 --> 01:06:38,400
But as a kid that didn't, that didn't even occur to me that that was the fun part.

1492
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:41,200
Don't don't be scared.

1493
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:41,680
Why?

1494
01:06:41,680 --> 01:06:43,680
Why would you ever put yourself in that position?

1495
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:47,320
Do you think if they had made like a little short where the professor.

1496
01:06:47,560 --> 01:06:52,200
Bird explains all the numerous safety features at the Disney parks,

1497
01:06:52,680 --> 01:06:53,920
I would have been normal.

1498
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:56,880
I think it would have been just like actually like accountants.

1499
01:06:57,280 --> 01:06:58,680
I think he's right now or something.

1500
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:01,360
I think if he truly broke down and he goes, all right, look, here's the deal.

1501
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:02,600
You think this thing's going straight down.

1502
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:04,120
It ain't it's an angle.

1503
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:04,800
Look at the angle.

1504
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:06,320
I'll show you exactly what the angle is.

1505
01:07:06,440 --> 01:07:07,280
And they go, okay.

1506
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:09,440
Now you like, you're going to feel like you're falling.

1507
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:10,440
You're not really falling.

1508
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:13,880
First of all, those thorns that bush that you think you're going to look

1509
01:07:13,880 --> 01:07:16,000
how far it is from the log and I go, okay.

1510
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,080
Like they need would need to do like explain.

1511
01:07:18,080 --> 01:07:19,520
It's feels like you're going 150 miles.

1512
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:21,000
You're going 15 miles an hour.

1513
01:07:21,040 --> 01:07:21,240
Yeah.

1514
01:07:21,240 --> 01:07:22,320
It's not a big deal.

1515
01:07:22,360 --> 01:07:22,760
Okay.

1516
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:25,840
We know a lot of your children's entertainment starts with the parents dying.

1517
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:28,520
Look, here's the likelihood of that happening.

1518
01:07:29,040 --> 01:07:33,040
This is what three act structure is in a movie where we need something big to

1519
01:07:33,040 --> 01:07:36,280
happen at the top, you know, et cetera, et cetera.

1520
01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:38,440
So very weirdo.

1521
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:41,640
Unlikely that your uncle is going to murder your father.

1522
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:43,440
What happens?

1523
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:47,200
It seems like it happens a lot.

1524
01:07:47,240 --> 01:07:50,840
Mark in the movie, in the four movies you watch the most, they should have had a

1525
01:07:50,840 --> 01:07:54,960
two prong marketing approach to rides and scary movies for certain kids like me.

1526
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:55,240
Yeah.

1527
01:07:55,400 --> 01:07:57,640
Where it was like demystifying it.

1528
01:07:57,640 --> 01:07:57,840
Yeah.

1529
01:07:57,880 --> 01:07:59,040
Hey kid, here's okay.

1530
01:07:59,040 --> 01:08:00,040
This is Hamlet.

1531
01:08:00,320 --> 01:08:04,520
Most of the thing, most entertainment pulls something from this.

1532
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:05,400
Okay.

1533
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:07,160
Well, that's for you.

1534
01:08:07,160 --> 01:08:08,480
That was for you as a kid.

1535
01:08:09,080 --> 01:08:11,680
Hey little kid, you know, Hamlet, I do know Hamlet.

1536
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:12,680
I have Jason.

1537
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:16,440
Put everything in the context of Hamlet.

1538
01:08:17,360 --> 01:08:19,440
How does this ride relate to Hamlet?

1539
01:08:20,280 --> 01:08:21,200
I'm Jason.

1540
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:24,040
Now, Mary Poppins I've never looked into, but I'm right.

1541
01:08:24,360 --> 01:08:24,840
Fraggled.

1542
01:08:24,840 --> 01:08:27,040
How does Mary Poppins relate to Hamlet?

1543
01:08:27,120 --> 01:08:27,640
Oh man.

1544
01:08:27,640 --> 01:08:31,160
I really could have driven up my, my, uh, uh, my family up a wall.

1545
01:08:31,160 --> 01:08:35,800
If I've been like, mom, let's read from Joseph Campbell's hero with a thousand

1546
01:08:35,800 --> 01:08:36,760
faces again.

1547
01:08:39,320 --> 01:08:39,680
Yeah.

1548
01:08:39,680 --> 01:08:40,560
So, so.

1549
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:42,520
So the, I mean, yeah.

1550
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:45,200
So it's this kind of blitz through the thrill rides, especially.

1551
01:08:45,480 --> 01:08:51,800
Um, I knew that this to me was the use of this, this zippity doo da middle rap.

1552
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:52,200
Yes.

1553
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:58,560
Um, because rap has, uh, just been popularized, uh, in a suburban sense.

1554
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:00,520
Disney has decided to take the trend and.

1555
01:09:00,520 --> 01:09:00,800
Right.

1556
01:09:00,840 --> 01:09:04,000
I guess we will, it seems like this will be around for a couple more years.

1557
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:05,480
We might as well acknowledge it.

1558
01:09:05,760 --> 01:09:06,960
Use it to trick children.

1559
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:08,800
Make it as uncool as we can.

1560
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:11,000
And, uh, you know, it is a thrill.

1561
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:14,040
Let's say we're going to stiffen this up.

1562
01:09:14,040 --> 01:09:14,280
Yeah.

1563
01:09:14,280 --> 01:09:14,560
Yeah.

1564
01:09:14,720 --> 01:09:18,680
Uh, but I did love that rap zip very much.

1565
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:22,600
And I didn't know that there was this other use of, I guess this, this video

1566
01:09:22,720 --> 01:09:27,160
is a second use of a lot of these weird stray songs because it got really popular.

1567
01:09:27,160 --> 01:09:31,080
That weird, what was kind of regarded as a horny version of it from that one

1568
01:09:31,080 --> 01:09:35,720
special, all the girls are rapping it to the guys with folded arms.

1569
01:09:35,720 --> 01:09:36,200
Yes.

1570
01:09:36,240 --> 01:09:37,360
But I didn't know about that.

1571
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:38,920
I didn't know about all that horniness.

1572
01:09:38,920 --> 01:09:40,800
I just, I knew it from this nice video.

1573
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:41,520
Thanks.

1574
01:09:41,560 --> 01:09:42,080
Mm hmm.

1575
01:09:42,440 --> 01:09:47,360
Um, so yeah, I, I like that, but I definitely watching it again.

1576
01:09:47,360 --> 01:09:50,120
I feel like I have a little bit of that when you said you described the earnest

1577
01:09:50,120 --> 01:09:53,360
special with just the seeing splash mountain and seeing a drop.

1578
01:09:53,640 --> 01:09:54,040
Yeah.

1579
01:09:54,240 --> 01:09:54,760
Yeah.

1580
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:59,080
Um, just assumed you never would, or you would assume that never would forced if

1581
01:09:59,080 --> 01:10:03,200
you did, uh, another fun little flash memory of this is this is the sequence

1582
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:07,320
where you get a little bit of star tours and why is it a, a flash

1583
01:10:07,320 --> 01:10:10,920
back to see the sign that says star tours presented by Eminem.

1584
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:11,400
Eminem.

1585
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:12,000
Eminem.

1586
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:12,280
Yeah.

1587
01:10:12,280 --> 01:10:13,680
Really big too.

1588
01:10:13,680 --> 01:10:15,440
I feel like really big Eminem.

1589
01:10:15,640 --> 01:10:16,240
Uh huh.

1590
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:17,040
Yeah.

1591
01:10:17,080 --> 01:10:19,200
Just very, very of its era.

1592
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:19,640
Yeah.

1593
01:10:19,640 --> 01:10:24,040
I mean, was there, there was no tie in inside as far as we know, right?

1594
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:25,800
Who couldn't have been, I don't think.

1595
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:29,960
There were a picture of the characters hadn't been, um, you know, red and

1596
01:10:30,360 --> 01:10:32,200
yellow had yet been invented.

1597
01:10:32,200 --> 01:10:35,640
So there weren't like droids that were stand ins for red and yellow.

1598
01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:37,840
C3PO did not have a red arm yet.

1599
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:40,960
So it didn't, this was years before it.

1600
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:41,840
Similar.

1601
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:42,280
Yes.

1602
01:10:43,160 --> 01:10:44,000
Similar though.

1603
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,840
And that there's the tall one is yellow.

1604
01:10:46,160 --> 01:10:46,800
That's true.

1605
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:50,680
But then I guess from there it's because he's also though, yellow is the dumb one.

1606
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:52,200
And he's the right.

1607
01:10:52,200 --> 01:10:53,360
He's the JK Simmons.

1608
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:57,400
Although maybe, although is, is our 2d2 smarter than C3PO, I guess.

1609
01:10:57,400 --> 01:10:57,800
Oh yeah.

1610
01:10:57,800 --> 01:10:58,400
I think so.

1611
01:10:58,440 --> 01:10:58,680
I think so.

1612
01:10:58,680 --> 01:10:59,840
That's maybe what's implied.

1613
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:03,880
He's that he's like course correcting and C3PO was not dumb, but he is a

1614
01:11:03,880 --> 01:11:05,480
little oblivious, I would say.

1615
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:07,280
I wouldn't say either of them are dumb.

1616
01:11:07,320 --> 01:11:07,840
Yeah.

1617
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:08,040
Yeah.

1618
01:11:08,040 --> 01:11:08,120
Yeah.

1619
01:11:08,120 --> 01:11:08,760
Too worried.

1620
01:11:08,760 --> 01:11:11,760
But he's, yeah, he's too stressed out and he's a little bit, he has like

1621
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:15,360
blind spots and our two kind of sees everything I think even killed.

1622
01:11:15,640 --> 01:11:16,080
Yeah.

1623
01:11:16,160 --> 01:11:20,320
And more are too obviously way more resourceful and can take care of

1624
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:21,960
problems easier than C3PO can.

1625
01:11:22,040 --> 01:11:22,640
Yeah, for sure.

1626
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:25,160
Uh, rumbly in my tumbling.

1627
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:26,160
Let's go.

1628
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:29,000
Let's go.

1629
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:31,600
The one that I popped for the heart.

1630
01:11:31,680 --> 01:11:35,440
As soon as I saw what this was going to be, I was like, no way.

1631
01:11:36,160 --> 01:11:38,360
And it is a treat song.

1632
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:39,760
It's a treat song.

1633
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:42,920
It's a song about poo looking for treats.

1634
01:11:42,920 --> 01:11:46,600
Pooh kind of being a little creep, like creeping out all the kids, creeping

1635
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:51,320
on the kids eating because he wants to eat their food and it's made better.

1636
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:56,280
I made creepier, I guess, by the fact that it is five o'clock shadow poo.

1637
01:11:56,560 --> 01:11:57,240
Oh yeah.

1638
01:11:57,240 --> 01:12:01,800
He's got the sort of like light brown snout and the light brown snoot, if you

1639
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:02,120
will.

1640
01:12:02,520 --> 01:12:07,160
Uh, and it makes them look a little bit more, uh, lessive, not lascivious, but

1641
01:12:07,160 --> 01:12:10,560
like a little bit more like shady, I guess it's the same thing creeping

1642
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:11,880
outside of windows.

1643
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:15,000
I don't know why it's not, it's less.

1644
01:12:15,160 --> 01:12:17,360
I don't know why it's not easy for him to attain food.

1645
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:19,240
Yeah, no, it shouldn't be no money.

1646
01:12:19,720 --> 01:12:20,880
Maybe, but he works.

1647
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:23,320
He, he, uh, works at the parks.

1648
01:12:23,360 --> 01:12:24,360
Who should be comped?

1649
01:12:24,360 --> 01:12:24,760
Come on.

1650
01:12:24,760 --> 01:12:26,160
He should get a crew meal.

1651
01:12:26,480 --> 01:12:26,800
Yeah.

1652
01:12:27,080 --> 01:12:27,920
Very least.

1653
01:12:27,960 --> 01:12:28,440
Sure.

1654
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:34,160
So, uh, it's yeah, there's some like gross looking food that kids are eating.

1655
01:12:34,160 --> 01:12:34,760
I'll say this.

1656
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:38,280
And I don't know if it's just the photography, if it's just the way that the

1657
01:12:38,280 --> 01:12:42,560
VHS has captured it, but like kids eating pan Mickey pancakes and the pancakes

1658
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:46,080
look as pale as unappealing as possible.

1659
01:12:46,120 --> 01:12:50,600
There's like a stop motion shot of the plate of the worst tortillas you've ever

1660
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:51,000
seen.

1661
01:12:51,640 --> 01:12:51,960
Yeah.

1662
01:12:52,240 --> 01:12:55,600
If they retired this, is there anywhere where you can get Mickey shaped tortilla

1663
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:56,280
chips?

1664
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:57,160
That's a good question.

1665
01:12:57,160 --> 01:13:02,320
I haven't seen those because I like I've been, I like that idea, but then boy, are

1666
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:03,880
they the driest?

1667
01:13:03,920 --> 01:13:04,360
Yeah.

1668
01:13:04,360 --> 01:13:06,560
Looking just sand.

1669
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:07,400
Yeah.

1670
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:08,120
And this is back.

1671
01:13:08,120 --> 01:13:13,880
I mean, when, like, I think it's fairly, uh, settled that Disneyland's food has

1672
01:13:13,880 --> 01:13:18,160
been a little bit ahead of Disney worlds still to this day, as far as like a

1673
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:24,320
variety and quality, it's still not gourmet, but back then I think they were

1674
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:29,120
still both probably in the same, in the same boat where it was like, we're going

1675
01:13:29,120 --> 01:13:30,760
to give you slop and you're going to like it.

1676
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:32,680
We're going to give you some trash and enjoy it.

1677
01:13:32,680 --> 01:13:33,560
It's Mickey's face.

1678
01:13:33,720 --> 01:13:34,160
Eat it.

1679
01:13:34,520 --> 01:13:35,520
Except for treats.

1680
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:36,880
I feel like treats looking good.

1681
01:13:36,920 --> 01:13:37,840
I think like that's true.

1682
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:40,240
They never were wrong in that neck of the woods.

1683
01:13:40,240 --> 01:13:45,400
I don't think it kind of takes the same amount to phone in confectionary as it.

1684
01:13:45,480 --> 01:13:47,520
I feel like it does to do it correctly.

1685
01:13:48,120 --> 01:13:48,600
You know?

1686
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:49,320
Yeah.

1687
01:13:49,320 --> 01:13:54,720
Like we like it's like bad pizza is almost tough to achieve in a way.

1688
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:55,480
Yeah.

1689
01:13:55,480 --> 01:13:59,040
Cause then everyone has like, well, I had cafeteria pizza in school.

1690
01:13:59,040 --> 01:14:01,280
I kind of like a frozen pizza now and then.

1691
01:14:01,320 --> 01:14:01,680
Yeah.

1692
01:14:01,680 --> 01:14:05,960
We all had pizza in a bad place that was kind of satisfying.

1693
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:06,720
Yeah, sure.

1694
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:09,040
But harder with these other items.

1695
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:09,280
Right.

1696
01:14:09,280 --> 01:14:12,680
I mean, yeah, the sweets look, a mini at the start of the special puts a big lolly

1697
01:14:12,760 --> 01:14:15,440
in the like, what are the stand?

1698
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:17,760
And that looked good.

1699
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:22,400
That was a, I always wanted the big lolly and then I had it once and it's too much.

1700
01:14:23,080 --> 01:14:24,040
It's way too much.

1701
01:14:24,040 --> 01:14:26,480
And then you try to save it and it's a disaster.

1702
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:31,080
Zip lock bag gets residue and you can't put it on a napkin because it gets

1703
01:14:31,080 --> 01:14:32,200
stuck and it's weird.

1704
01:14:32,480 --> 01:14:35,880
We should though do an episode where it almost doesn't matter what it's about,

1705
01:14:35,880 --> 01:14:38,320
but where Jason has to eat a big lolly.

1706
01:14:39,400 --> 01:14:43,000
At the start of the episode and see how much I get done by the end.

1707
01:14:43,040 --> 01:14:44,560
I mean, we might have to film that one.

1708
01:14:45,200 --> 01:14:48,720
Pick an arbitrary, if we keep doing video ones.

1709
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:49,480
Oh yeah.

1710
01:14:49,480 --> 01:14:51,720
Just make you have a lolly.

1711
01:14:52,720 --> 01:14:55,600
If I could have, can I have a bottle of water?

1712
01:14:55,800 --> 01:14:56,240
Oh, sure.

1713
01:14:56,240 --> 01:14:56,480
Yeah.

1714
01:14:56,480 --> 01:14:56,760
Okay.

1715
01:14:56,760 --> 01:14:57,840
Yeah, that's fine.

1716
01:14:57,840 --> 01:15:01,440
No, it's, it's like a hot dog eating contest rules.

1717
01:15:01,720 --> 01:15:02,120
Sure.

1718
01:15:02,120 --> 01:15:04,640
And we can all have big lot like different lollies.

1719
01:15:05,040 --> 01:15:07,520
We could, there's like the kind of skinny, like long skinny ones.

1720
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:08,640
There's a big round ones.

1721
01:15:09,400 --> 01:15:11,760
And I'm sure there's new innovative lollies.

1722
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:15,320
I mean, is it, well, I was going to say, is that an episode about lollies,

1723
01:15:15,320 --> 01:15:16,400
but I think maybe not.

1724
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:18,160
It's just an episode about something else.

1725
01:15:18,160 --> 01:15:20,160
And then coincidentally we're eating big lolly.

1726
01:15:20,160 --> 01:15:21,680
I can see the argument for both sides.

1727
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:22,120
Yeah.

1728
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:27,280
Uh, we'll, we'll figure out the logic of it, but I'm in for it.

1729
01:15:27,480 --> 01:15:29,080
You might need to go to the hospital.

1730
01:15:29,160 --> 01:15:31,600
That might be one where it's like, you might have to go to the hospital.

1731
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:31,760
Oh yeah.

1732
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:32,600
I'm going to have some trouble.

1733
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:32,880
Yeah.

1734
01:15:33,160 --> 01:15:36,600
I know I'm, I'm as we've established, I'm not up to your, your guys standards.

1735
01:15:36,760 --> 01:15:37,280
That's true.

1736
01:15:37,560 --> 01:15:38,880
Um, what else?

1737
01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:41,080
Oh, uh, just the lyrics.

1738
01:15:41,160 --> 01:15:43,800
I just got to read hum dee dum dum.

1739
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:49,440
I'm so rumbly in my tumbley time to munch on early lunch and time for something

1740
01:15:49,440 --> 01:15:49,840
sweet.

1741
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:53,320
Uncle Jason's going to teach us to your child.

1742
01:15:53,320 --> 01:15:54,280
You know that, right?

1743
01:15:54,280 --> 01:15:55,040
That's coming.

1744
01:15:56,560 --> 01:15:58,040
Um, he's already big.

1745
01:15:58,240 --> 01:16:01,920
He's big into poo and he does the, the up down, touch the ground.

1746
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:02,320
That's good.

1747
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:03,360
I, what a dream.

1748
01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:03,880
Oh my God.

1749
01:16:03,880 --> 01:16:06,440
I have always loved way pre child.

1750
01:16:06,440 --> 01:16:08,360
I love up down, touch the ground.

1751
01:16:08,360 --> 01:16:08,800
Oh yeah.

1752
01:16:08,840 --> 01:16:13,920
Does it in like, I took photos of it and everyone, he was exactly on the right.

1753
01:16:14,360 --> 01:16:17,960
Like if I was like analyzing video of an athlete, that's great.

1754
01:16:18,200 --> 01:16:19,920
Exactly aligned with Winnie the Pooh.

1755
01:16:19,960 --> 01:16:21,280
That's the reason to have a child.

1756
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:21,920
Yeah.

1757
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:25,160
Just to see them do this, do the thing.

1758
01:16:25,160 --> 01:16:25,560
Go.

1759
01:16:25,560 --> 01:16:26,720
I have a couple beers.

1760
01:16:27,400 --> 01:16:28,560
Do the song.

1761
01:16:28,840 --> 01:16:29,920
Do it for daddy.

1762
01:16:31,960 --> 01:16:33,320
Pooh bear now.

1763
01:16:33,320 --> 01:16:34,920
Stout and round.

1764
01:16:36,720 --> 01:16:37,960
Uh, uh, yeah.

1765
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:38,400
Pooh.

1766
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:38,720
Yeah.

1767
01:16:38,720 --> 01:16:41,200
Pooh really is still great.

1768
01:16:41,480 --> 01:16:45,560
And I've said this before we watched Pooh not long ago and he's lazy and he falls

1769
01:16:45,560 --> 01:16:48,720
asleep when rabbits trying to tell him stuff and it's just like Homer.

1770
01:16:49,440 --> 01:16:49,800
Yeah.

1771
01:16:49,880 --> 01:16:50,320
The same.

1772
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:50,560
Yeah.

1773
01:16:50,560 --> 01:16:54,320
And you catch certain frames where that belly's so big and the look is so

1774
01:16:54,320 --> 01:16:55,920
vacant or he's falling asleep.

1775
01:16:55,920 --> 01:16:56,880
I it's real good.

1776
01:16:56,920 --> 01:16:59,000
Uh, recently public domain.

1777
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:00,080
Oh yes.

1778
01:17:00,080 --> 01:17:01,360
Because they're making that weird horror movie.

1779
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:03,520
There's a weird Pooh bear horror movie happening now.

1780
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:07,200
So we can make a legally make a Pooh bear anything.

1781
01:17:07,480 --> 01:17:08,000
Yeah.

1782
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:08,320
Yeah.

1783
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:11,000
So I don't know something to think about too.

1784
01:17:11,480 --> 01:17:13,680
Um, porn snuff.

1785
01:17:16,320 --> 01:17:19,280
The horror movie looks like it's not, I mean, they've done a great job at making

1786
01:17:19,280 --> 01:17:21,160
all the characters look horrific for that.

1787
01:17:21,160 --> 01:17:21,600
That's true.

1788
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:21,840
Yeah.

1789
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:22,120
Wait.

1790
01:17:22,360 --> 01:17:27,640
I mean, what you could, maybe the thing to do is kind of like a 10th tier sort

1791
01:17:27,640 --> 01:17:31,040
of boondocks saints type prime movie.

1792
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:31,960
It's real boring.

1793
01:17:31,960 --> 01:17:36,480
They would end up in red box and Eric Roberts is in it, but just the it's, you

1794
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:42,040
know, jazz, pulmonary, Winnie the Pooh and Frank Grillo.

1795
01:17:43,080 --> 01:17:43,520
Yeah.

1796
01:17:45,160 --> 01:17:46,200
Vinnie Jones.

1797
01:17:46,520 --> 01:17:50,480
I saw a movie pop up on one of the streaming services and the billing was

1798
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:54,280
like Bruce Willis, Kevin Dillon, Frank Grillo.

1799
01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:59,320
And I was like together for the first time, like perfect, perfect

1800
01:17:59,320 --> 01:18:01,480
director streaming produced by Doug.

1801
01:18:01,480 --> 01:18:01,920
Ellen.

1802
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:04,440
Perfume.

1803
01:18:04,440 --> 01:18:05,280
Dream cast.

1804
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:05,600
True.

1805
01:18:05,680 --> 01:18:08,160
Um, I mean, there's an, it's a small world.

1806
01:18:08,160 --> 01:18:09,480
I don't have much to say about that.

1807
01:18:09,480 --> 01:18:13,080
Yeah, that's just, you know, that's, you know, the sky buckets,

1808
01:18:13,080 --> 01:18:14,240
Pinocchio on the carousel.

1809
01:18:14,240 --> 01:18:14,320
Yeah.

1810
01:18:14,320 --> 01:18:15,440
You get a little sky bucket.

1811
01:18:15,520 --> 01:18:16,040
Yeah.

1812
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:16,360
Yeah.

1813
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:18,200
Which, yeah, that's fun to see.

1814
01:18:18,200 --> 01:18:18,680
Miss him.

1815
01:18:18,680 --> 01:18:19,440
Absolutely.

1816
01:18:20,040 --> 01:18:23,040
Um, there's this weird song called making memories.

1817
01:18:23,080 --> 01:18:23,400
Yeah.

1818
01:18:23,400 --> 01:18:25,320
This is another one of the, what is this?

1819
01:18:25,320 --> 01:18:27,120
This is another fast forward for young Michael.

1820
01:18:27,160 --> 01:18:27,640
Yeah.

1821
01:18:27,720 --> 01:18:32,560
Uh, I looked this up this and rumbly in my tumbling, both Sherman brother songs.

1822
01:18:32,600 --> 01:18:34,200
Did they do rumbly in my, really?

1823
01:18:34,200 --> 01:18:34,480
Yeah.

1824
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:41,640
Uh, this song was for the pre-show of magic journeys, which we haven't talked

1825
01:18:41,640 --> 01:18:44,000
about yet precursor to captain EO.

1826
01:18:44,040 --> 01:18:44,440
Yeah.

1827
01:18:44,520 --> 01:18:47,800
Um, sponsored by Kodak.

1828
01:18:48,320 --> 01:18:50,680
So the song is about taking pictures.

1829
01:18:50,680 --> 01:18:53,280
That is why the song is about taking pictures.

1830
01:18:53,280 --> 01:18:53,560
Yeah.

1831
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:54,000
Yeah.

1832
01:18:54,040 --> 01:18:55,680
Cause it's very, yeah.

1833
01:18:55,680 --> 01:18:57,960
Pushing cameras and snapping.

1834
01:18:57,960 --> 01:18:59,720
You can feel the agenda in the song.

1835
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:00,400
Yeah.

1836
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:00,720
Yeah.

1837
01:19:00,720 --> 01:19:00,760
Yeah.

1838
01:19:00,760 --> 01:19:04,440
I was wondering what was, what was taking pictures is making

1839
01:19:04,440 --> 01:19:07,200
memories and you're like, Oh yeah, taking pictures is making memories.

1840
01:19:07,200 --> 01:19:07,400
Okay.

1841
01:19:07,400 --> 01:19:08,360
That's what I should do.

1842
01:19:08,680 --> 01:19:13,120
There's this way that these, especially like the male singers, you might be one

1843
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:17,080
singer doubled up, but they just, it's, I relate to it cause it's just the, uh,

1844
01:19:17,440 --> 01:19:19,160
very stiff, clear voice.

1845
01:19:19,160 --> 01:19:25,400
And in this song, it's that they, when they sing candid shots and then in the

1846
01:19:25,400 --> 01:19:29,840
end, I forgot in, uh, it's been in my head for ever since I saw this when I was a

1847
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:35,040
kid in the main street song, when they sing down the middle, down the middle.

1848
01:19:35,840 --> 01:19:41,080
Like I could be one of these singers as long as that, cause I can't be like cool

1849
01:19:41,080 --> 01:19:43,960
and chill, but I can enunciate that.

1850
01:19:43,960 --> 01:19:46,720
It feels like shots an Osmond delivery.

1851
01:19:47,160 --> 01:19:47,680
Right.

1852
01:19:48,440 --> 01:19:48,800
Yeah.

1853
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:48,960
Yeah.

1854
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:49,280
Yeah.

1855
01:19:49,680 --> 01:19:52,760
The, well, the, the whitest of white is, is what it is.

1856
01:19:53,080 --> 01:19:57,960
Um, the original lyrics to that song, I think I snapped some

1857
01:19:58,440 --> 01:19:59,800
screenshots on my phone.

1858
01:19:59,960 --> 01:20:00,200
Okay.

1859
01:20:00,200 --> 01:20:04,440
The real lyrics to it are all about like old timey.

1860
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:09,880
The real is are long before the old model T round about the turn of the century.

1861
01:20:09,960 --> 01:20:14,760
Folks discovered a barrel of fun taking pictures behind the light of the sun.

1862
01:20:15,920 --> 01:20:19,200
So it was about the new invention of cameras.

1863
01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:26,200
And then this other one, then, then the, then the flappers appeared on the scene.

1864
01:20:26,360 --> 01:20:29,520
Rumble seats and 20 cent gasoline.

1865
01:20:30,520 --> 01:20:30,920
Let's go.

1866
01:20:30,920 --> 01:20:34,600
Brandon radios and radios.

1867
01:20:34,600 --> 01:20:39,640
So here's, here's, here's, here's a lyric radios and diesel and jazz.

1868
01:20:40,120 --> 01:20:41,280
Disl Jason.

1869
01:20:41,280 --> 01:20:42,480
Is that diesel?

1870
01:20:43,200 --> 01:20:44,600
Disl maybe.

1871
01:20:44,600 --> 01:20:48,800
I mean, what I'm reading is that is not a Snoop Dogg thing where he like says

1872
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:52,880
isle on the end of that was invented the, the fushizzle.

1873
01:20:52,880 --> 01:20:53,920
It's like, would it be great?

1874
01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:54,960
As a little diesel.

1875
01:20:55,000 --> 01:21:00,400
The, the next line is round your cameras and Raza Mataz, but diesel.

1876
01:21:01,240 --> 01:21:02,000
It's diesel.

1877
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:02,480
It's diesel.

1878
01:21:02,480 --> 01:21:02,920
Looking that up.

1879
01:21:02,920 --> 01:21:03,360
It's known.

1880
01:21:05,080 --> 01:21:08,560
If you look it up at some startup, diesel connects qualified home service providers

1881
01:21:08,560 --> 01:21:09,600
with real estate professional.

1882
01:21:09,720 --> 01:21:10,280
Oh my God.

1883
01:21:10,280 --> 01:21:11,360
This is not what it is.

1884
01:21:11,960 --> 01:21:13,000
Oh, the urban dictionary.

1885
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:13,120
Yeah.

1886
01:21:13,120 --> 01:21:13,640
Did you see that?

1887
01:21:14,680 --> 01:21:15,400
It's third gate.

1888
01:21:15,440 --> 01:21:16,840
Say it in a brief.

1889
01:21:16,840 --> 01:21:20,240
Well, this one is an abbreviation of the drug MDMA.

1890
01:21:20,560 --> 01:21:20,960
Okay.

1891
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:21,400
Yeah.

1892
01:21:21,400 --> 01:21:21,840
Yeah.

1893
01:21:21,880 --> 01:21:24,880
And then the example they get is I was fucked last night.

1894
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:27,720
I ended up taking two grams of diesel out with me.

1895
01:21:28,760 --> 01:21:29,240
Yeah.

1896
01:21:29,400 --> 01:21:30,320
Hey, just a reminder.

1897
01:21:30,360 --> 01:21:34,000
Uh, I know this is club three, so there are no ads, but we do have a diesel.

1898
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:35,160
Wait, there's another one.

1899
01:21:35,160 --> 01:21:37,040
There's another, there's another, sorry, Jason.

1900
01:21:37,040 --> 01:21:37,600
I know.

1901
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:38,280
That's okay.

1902
01:21:39,200 --> 01:21:40,840
Oh, I know what you want to say to this one.

1903
01:21:41,200 --> 01:21:42,680
Is it the, the, in the car?

1904
01:21:42,840 --> 01:21:43,320
Yeah.

1905
01:21:43,560 --> 01:21:44,000
How's that?

1906
01:21:44,120 --> 01:21:45,800
A diesel is a skip ahead.

1907
01:21:45,960 --> 01:21:50,280
A diesel is an actor in where the person in the passenger seat in a car orders

1908
01:21:50,280 --> 01:21:55,240
the driver to slow down, winds down his window, wanks, and yet skillfully comes

1909
01:21:55,240 --> 01:21:57,440
into the face of an innocent pedestrian.

1910
01:21:57,440 --> 01:21:58,640
Oh my God.

1911
01:21:58,640 --> 01:21:59,880
That's just assault.

1912
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:03,160
No, that's awful.

1913
01:22:03,440 --> 01:22:04,480
That's a diesel.

1914
01:22:04,520 --> 01:22:06,320
That's not what the Sherman brothers.

1915
01:22:06,320 --> 01:22:07,920
That's it was big in the twenties.

1916
01:22:09,920 --> 01:22:10,480
Walt can.

1917
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:11,520
What was big?

1918
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:12,440
That's all right.

1919
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:14,480
Robert, what was big in the twenties?

1920
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:15,560
Let's see.

1921
01:22:15,560 --> 01:22:17,400
Radios jazz.

1922
01:22:17,440 --> 01:22:18,400
Well, what about resume?

1923
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:18,920
Taz?

1924
01:22:18,960 --> 01:22:19,360
Oh yes.

1925
01:22:19,360 --> 01:22:19,800
Good one.

1926
01:22:19,800 --> 01:22:20,680
Thanks for adding it.

1927
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:22,720
And, uh, oh, you know what we do?

1928
01:22:22,720 --> 01:22:27,080
Remember what we used to do is brothers all the time in our model T go out for a

1929
01:22:27,080 --> 01:22:31,800
diesel, a rash of diesel incidents solely led to prohibition.

1930
01:22:33,920 --> 01:22:37,160
They got young people running around driving and disaling.

1931
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:39,520
We know more disland and driving.

1932
01:22:39,560 --> 01:22:42,200
Henry Ford is too powerful at that point.

1933
01:22:42,200 --> 01:22:43,800
So they can't be on the cars.

1934
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:48,200
And I can't ban the body parts.

1935
01:22:48,320 --> 01:22:51,520
Walt would, and now we remember Walt would come into the office and he'd say,

1936
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:53,880
boys play that song with Dizzle.

1937
01:22:55,480 --> 01:22:56,960
I want to remember the good old days.

1938
01:22:57,400 --> 01:22:57,800
Yeah.

1939
01:22:57,920 --> 01:22:58,400
And he would live.

1940
01:22:58,400 --> 01:23:00,320
Then he would literally come into the office.

1941
01:23:00,360 --> 01:23:00,880
That's right.

1942
01:23:04,440 --> 01:23:05,440
So that's that.

1943
01:23:05,800 --> 01:23:10,720
Um, Hey, why don't let's go from that into the, uh, the song with the, the

1944
01:23:10,760 --> 01:23:12,720
stopping wet Maleficent.

1945
01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:13,720
Oh, yeah.

1946
01:23:13,720 --> 01:23:14,480
It is now.

1947
01:23:14,480 --> 01:23:18,360
The highlight we talked about before in the Haunted Mansion highlight in the

1948
01:23:18,360 --> 01:23:21,720
weirdest thing, but this is the thing everybody who saw this remembers.

1949
01:23:22,040 --> 01:23:25,400
This is the unifying memory we all have.

1950
01:23:25,880 --> 01:23:30,760
So there's a routine with all the villains outside of the haunted mansion and

1951
01:23:30,760 --> 01:23:34,600
the, the, the queen baddie is Maleficent.

1952
01:23:34,640 --> 01:23:34,920
Yeah.

1953
01:23:35,200 --> 01:23:36,320
She's painted green.

1954
01:23:36,400 --> 01:23:39,360
It is the wettest, the wettest face you've ever seen.

1955
01:23:39,360 --> 01:23:41,200
It is so, yeah, it's so memorable.

1956
01:23:41,200 --> 01:23:41,600
Anybody?

1957
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:41,920
Yeah.

1958
01:23:41,920 --> 01:23:44,320
Uh, uh, this I think was the highlight of the

1959
01:23:44,320 --> 01:23:48,480
video too, which also like adds to the memory of it.

1960
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:49,040
Yeah.

1961
01:23:49,040 --> 01:23:52,920
Well, some of us were delighted by the great shot of the keel boats in

1962
01:23:52,920 --> 01:23:54,760
action in the previous number.

1963
01:23:54,880 --> 01:23:57,080
That's fair, but you weren't watching as a kid.

1964
01:23:57,560 --> 01:24:00,320
So this is more of a recent thing where you love the keel boats.

1965
01:24:00,680 --> 01:24:01,080
Huh?

1966
01:24:01,560 --> 01:24:04,880
I loved all, even as a kid, I was like boats, trains, car.

1967
01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:06,600
I buy, I buy that.

1968
01:24:06,600 --> 01:24:06,840
Sure.

1969
01:24:06,840 --> 01:24:07,440
No, you're right.

1970
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:07,720
You're right.

1971
01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:09,280
Mommy, I'm Mike Fink.

1972
01:24:10,200 --> 01:24:14,360
But anyway, yeah, wet Maleficent.

1973
01:24:14,400 --> 01:24:15,640
It's so strange.

1974
01:24:15,640 --> 01:24:16,480
What happened?

1975
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:17,720
Why is it this way?

1976
01:24:17,840 --> 01:24:21,640
Did they not have really trying to rationalize it?

1977
01:24:21,640 --> 01:24:24,680
Did they not have a way to dry Maleficent down?

1978
01:24:25,080 --> 01:24:27,800
Uh, did they decide to do, to keep it on purpose?

1979
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:33,360
Did they, like, if, if we try to dampen it, is the makeup just going to come off?

1980
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,760
Well, there was still, obviously there were still things that they were

1981
01:24:36,760 --> 01:24:39,120
perfecting, even like the country bears necks.

1982
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:44,920
So perhaps this is just the way it kind of looked in the park and it just didn't

1983
01:24:44,920 --> 01:24:47,840
look like they had never put it on video before.

1984
01:24:48,160 --> 01:24:49,240
So they didn't know.

1985
01:24:49,680 --> 01:24:52,920
And again, we've talked about this is made very fast and cheap.

1986
01:24:53,320 --> 01:24:55,360
So there was like, I guess we got to shoot it.

1987
01:24:55,560 --> 01:24:59,120
Well, they're also pumping fog around the man.

1988
01:24:59,120 --> 01:25:02,520
So you think maybe the fog is making the fog and the fact that they were probably

1989
01:25:02,520 --> 01:25:05,760
shooting this at four or five in the morning, I don't think it's sweat.

1990
01:25:05,760 --> 01:25:06,960
I don't think she's sweating.

1991
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:08,200
No, I don't think it's just a makeup.

1992
01:25:08,200 --> 01:25:09,160
It's like shiny.

1993
01:25:09,160 --> 01:25:14,440
But between the fog and like the morning do of like, we got to be out of here by

1994
01:25:14,440 --> 01:25:17,760
six 30, the park opens at seven or eight.

1995
01:25:17,800 --> 01:25:18,080
Yeah.

1996
01:25:18,200 --> 01:25:18,440
Yeah.

1997
01:25:18,440 --> 01:25:20,000
And that much do is it really?

1998
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:23,320
How much do you could you accumulate on your face?

1999
01:25:24,240 --> 01:25:26,480
Well, yeah, I just got to move around a lot.

2000
01:25:26,480 --> 01:25:28,600
It seems like there's a number of setups, you know?

2001
01:25:28,640 --> 01:25:29,000
Yeah.

2002
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:32,800
I don't think it's doing, I think it's literally just the makeup and I think they

2003
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:37,640
didn't know how it was going to look on camera, but it's possible it's fog.

2004
01:25:37,640 --> 01:25:41,080
It's possible it's do it's possible.

2005
01:25:42,840 --> 01:25:44,360
Somebody to spray her with water.

2006
01:25:44,360 --> 01:25:44,920
I don't know.

2007
01:25:44,920 --> 01:25:46,280
It's anything possible.

2008
01:25:46,280 --> 01:25:46,960
Scarier.

2009
01:25:46,960 --> 01:25:48,560
If what if it is scarier?

2010
01:25:48,600 --> 01:25:49,000
Yes.

2011
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:49,400
Scary.

2012
01:25:49,400 --> 01:25:55,200
Yeah, frankly, it is scary with combine that with the scary tree costumes and all

2013
01:25:55,200 --> 01:25:59,000
the other one I find that I found the movements very abrasive.

2014
01:25:59,400 --> 01:26:03,120
I think I might've said when we talked about this within a haunted mansion that I

2015
01:26:03,120 --> 01:26:07,800
was so scared of that big bad wolf costume and then I imagined my bedroom was

2016
01:26:07,800 --> 01:26:10,560
at the end of a long hallway and I would the little thing that they do where they

2017
01:26:10,560 --> 01:26:16,160
kind of double turn, I would imagine them like the characters doing that one by

2018
01:26:16,160 --> 01:26:18,640
one down the hall in my bedroom.

2019
01:26:18,640 --> 01:26:23,480
And like, what if the big bad wolf's long tongue reached all the way down the

2020
01:26:23,480 --> 01:26:28,720
hallway and like, I don't know what lapped me up, pulled me into his mouth.

2021
01:26:28,960 --> 01:26:31,120
I hated that big bad wolf so much.

2022
01:26:31,440 --> 01:26:35,800
Well, and the editing trick where they all like, yeah, they're all dancing before

2023
01:26:35,800 --> 01:26:39,680
they do the double take, they're going from pillar to pillar, but disappear,

2024
01:26:39,680 --> 01:26:40,800
but then disappear.

2025
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:41,880
And it looks pretty good.

2026
01:26:41,880 --> 01:26:45,200
Night style where they ever, how are they all going into the one tree?

2027
01:26:45,320 --> 01:26:48,320
This is the most sophisticated shot in the whole thing.

2028
01:26:48,400 --> 01:26:50,520
It is the best done portion.

2029
01:26:50,560 --> 01:26:50,960
Yeah.

2030
01:26:50,960 --> 01:26:51,800
For sure.

2031
01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:52,840
It has an effect.

2032
01:26:52,840 --> 01:26:53,720
It is eerie.

2033
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:54,600
It's scary.

2034
01:26:54,640 --> 01:27:00,160
The sound effects are what that specific Creek at the end is the gate closes for

2035
01:27:00,200 --> 01:27:05,120
me at the actress is good looking at the little girl thinking like, I wonder what

2036
01:27:05,120 --> 01:27:08,920
goes on in there is genuinely poltergeist.

2037
01:27:08,920 --> 01:27:09,760
Oh yeah.

2038
01:27:09,800 --> 01:27:11,640
This is a great sequence.

2039
01:27:11,640 --> 01:27:12,920
This is a highlight of the whole thing.

2040
01:27:12,920 --> 01:27:14,760
This one, they knew they knew it.

2041
01:27:14,760 --> 01:27:16,120
It's a toward the end of the tape.

2042
01:27:16,200 --> 01:27:20,640
This was my favorite thing in the tape, even though yes, scared by some of it,

2043
01:27:21,200 --> 01:27:25,440
um, which I guess contradicts, I still didn't put it together that I like to be

2044
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:29,280
scared even though I was saying earlier, but it was my favorite thing on the tape.

2045
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:34,080
I'm looking through some just pictures of Maleficent walk around characters in

2046
01:27:34,080 --> 01:27:38,040
the, the shininess of the face varies, but there are some that look pretty shiny.

2047
01:27:38,920 --> 01:27:42,240
So I think maybe it was just whatever makeup they were using at the time.

2048
01:27:42,400 --> 01:27:43,040
Oh yeah.

2049
01:27:43,040 --> 01:27:46,600
It might just be, um, what did they spray to make you fake?

2050
01:27:46,600 --> 01:27:47,240
Look sweaty.

2051
01:27:47,240 --> 01:27:49,040
It's like a mixture of water and glycerin.

2052
01:27:50,400 --> 01:27:53,080
Maybe they just went too heavy on the glycerin.

2053
01:27:54,560 --> 01:27:55,560
They didn't have time to adjust.

2054
01:27:55,800 --> 01:27:56,000
Yeah.

2055
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:57,600
There's some, some people.

2056
01:27:57,920 --> 01:27:58,120
Yeah.

2057
01:27:58,120 --> 01:28:02,920
It looks like the recent Maleficent's have a much more subtle green going.

2058
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:09,360
And some of the older pictures I see like a real thick green with a sheen on it.

2059
01:28:09,640 --> 01:28:11,040
What was their policy?

2060
01:28:11,040 --> 01:28:11,800
So I don't know.

2061
01:28:11,800 --> 01:28:12,520
They chatted.

2062
01:28:12,520 --> 01:28:18,280
They ebb and flow the, uh, it was like, you know, uh, like being in Los Angeles

2063
01:28:18,280 --> 01:28:20,480
with monitoring of water levels, right?

2064
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:25,680
They, they shifted their policy of how much water to unleash on the Maleficent's

2065
01:28:26,280 --> 01:28:31,520
and then by the time we get to the Angelina Jolie Maleficent, they perfected it.

2066
01:28:32,120 --> 01:28:33,200
They didn't have, she didn't have.

2067
01:28:33,200 --> 01:28:38,000
Says you, I, um, you know, I think that I don't think nearly as scary, nearly as

2068
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:42,840
affecting as this actress whose name I don't know in this Grim Grin and Ghost

2069
01:28:42,840 --> 01:28:43,320
Sequence.

2070
01:28:43,320 --> 01:28:47,320
Did that movie come out three years ago or 15 years ago?

2071
01:28:47,320 --> 01:28:47,840
Which one?

2072
01:28:47,880 --> 01:28:48,400
Both of them.

2073
01:28:48,400 --> 01:28:48,920
Maleficent.

2074
01:28:48,920 --> 01:28:49,640
Are there two of them?

2075
01:28:49,640 --> 01:28:50,400
Was there two?

2076
01:28:50,400 --> 01:28:51,120
There were two.

2077
01:28:51,120 --> 01:28:52,200
There were two Maleficent's.

2078
01:28:52,200 --> 01:28:52,440
Yeah.

2079
01:28:52,440 --> 01:28:53,640
The sequel did come out.

2080
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:55,360
I think that came out three years ago.

2081
01:28:55,440 --> 01:28:55,960
Okay.

2082
01:28:56,040 --> 01:28:56,520
Yeah.

2083
01:28:56,520 --> 01:29:01,520
And did they make a, like a third one over zoom, like father of the bride?

2084
01:29:01,720 --> 01:29:02,600
We'd never know.

2085
01:29:02,640 --> 01:29:04,240
There might've been a zoom Maleficent.

2086
01:29:04,320 --> 01:29:05,240
That's possible.

2087
01:29:05,320 --> 01:29:07,440
Maleficent two came out three years ago.

2088
01:29:08,720 --> 01:29:09,640
2019.

2089
01:29:09,800 --> 01:29:11,680
The hardest time to remember.

2090
01:29:11,800 --> 01:29:14,640
I would say Maleficent two mistress of evil.

2091
01:29:15,440 --> 01:29:16,200
2019.

2092
01:29:16,200 --> 01:29:21,400
We're recording this three years ago was opening day of galaxy's edge.

2093
01:29:21,760 --> 01:29:22,360
Today?

2094
01:29:22,360 --> 01:29:22,960
Today.

2095
01:29:22,960 --> 01:29:24,080
Whoa.

2096
01:29:24,080 --> 01:29:24,360
Yeah.

2097
01:29:24,360 --> 01:29:25,040
Really?

2098
01:29:25,120 --> 01:29:25,400
Yeah.

2099
01:29:25,400 --> 01:29:26,200
Wow.

2100
01:29:26,320 --> 01:29:29,960
Three years ago, we saw the brushing of the teeth of of monstros teeth.

2101
01:29:30,080 --> 01:29:30,440
Yeah.

2102
01:29:30,440 --> 01:29:31,600
Oh, the best.

2103
01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:32,280
That was the greatest.

2104
01:29:32,280 --> 01:29:32,600
Yeah.

2105
01:29:32,680 --> 01:29:33,200
Wow.

2106
01:29:33,360 --> 01:29:34,920
Um, well, yep.

2107
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:36,080
It feels like 30.

2108
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,240
This tape feels more recent somehow.

2109
01:29:41,440 --> 01:29:42,560
That's so insane.

2110
01:29:42,600 --> 01:29:43,200
Ooh boy.

2111
01:29:43,360 --> 01:29:44,040
Well, I'll try.

2112
01:29:44,040 --> 01:29:48,560
I'm going to try to grapple with that and also keep talking as difficult as that will be.

2113
01:29:48,680 --> 01:29:52,960
And now they've ruined galaxy's edge by putting characters people know and like in

2114
01:29:53,440 --> 01:29:54,600
this is the end.

2115
01:29:57,280 --> 01:29:59,640
Burn it to the ground as far as I'm concerned.

2116
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,120
Four walk around characters.

2117
01:30:02,680 --> 01:30:08,720
How dare you when when I go and I see phoenix shand, I'm going to cover my eyes.

2118
01:30:09,040 --> 01:30:10,480
Stop the shand.

2119
01:30:10,640 --> 01:30:12,280
Stop the shand.

2120
01:30:12,560 --> 01:30:13,120
Yeah.

2121
01:30:13,760 --> 01:30:15,000
Till we're taken back.

2122
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:16,960
We're it's time to start.

2123
01:30:18,040 --> 01:30:19,840
There's steps anywhere in galaxy's.

2124
01:30:20,040 --> 01:30:20,760
Yeah, we'll go.

2125
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:21,360
No, no, no.

2126
01:30:21,520 --> 01:30:25,640
We'll get up on the next to that start of the Trevor designed starship.

2127
01:30:25,680 --> 01:30:26,200
That's right.

2128
01:30:26,200 --> 01:30:29,760
We'll take it back and we'll say we aren't leaving until you promise not to put this

2129
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:31,560
cute baby alien in here.

2130
01:30:31,720 --> 01:30:34,080
No, it ruins the history.

2131
01:30:35,120 --> 01:30:36,720
Ruins the integrity of the land.

2132
01:30:38,160 --> 01:30:40,160
There's a character parade song.

2133
01:30:40,240 --> 01:30:41,680
Again, like what the hell is this?

2134
01:30:41,720 --> 01:30:42,600
I don't care about it.

2135
01:30:42,640 --> 01:30:44,960
Really party ground inflatables in there.

2136
01:30:45,080 --> 01:30:46,240
That's fun.

2137
01:30:46,280 --> 01:30:49,200
Is that like those?

2138
01:30:49,920 --> 01:30:54,120
But when you wish upon a star, unless I'm missing one, but when you wish upon a star

2139
01:30:54,120 --> 01:30:56,720
is is a kind of a it's a fun way to go out.

2140
01:30:56,760 --> 01:31:01,440
Again, I see what you're saying, Jason, where there's the vibe of like they're

2141
01:31:01,440 --> 01:31:04,640
there, you know, it's saying good night to everybody before you feel like your

2142
01:31:04,640 --> 01:31:06,960
pedos hit in the hay real quick.

2143
01:31:07,360 --> 01:31:11,280
But one last let's everybody hug with the strangest one is that it's all done in

2144
01:31:11,280 --> 01:31:15,640
slow motion, kind of these nice end of day moments for the last kids, the

2145
01:31:15,680 --> 01:31:21,640
stragglers, including one where Pluto gives a big lick to a child's face in slow

2146
01:31:21,640 --> 01:31:22,280
motion.

2147
01:31:22,760 --> 01:31:25,200
And I have been licked by Pluto.

2148
01:31:25,320 --> 01:31:26,680
I think we've talked about this before.

2149
01:31:27,160 --> 01:31:31,480
I think we have a photo somewhere of me getting that weird tongue and it was weird

2150
01:31:31,480 --> 01:31:34,680
as a kid because I know it's like the end concept.

2151
01:31:34,680 --> 01:31:35,280
It's fun.

2152
01:31:35,360 --> 01:31:36,360
It's just rubbery.

2153
01:31:36,360 --> 01:31:37,760
It's not wet, right?

2154
01:31:37,840 --> 01:31:39,040
It's just kind of slick.

2155
01:31:39,080 --> 01:31:41,440
I have a limp piece of vinyl.

2156
01:31:41,520 --> 01:31:44,760
Yeah, it's hitting me in the head as a kid and like maybe the performer in the same

2157
01:31:44,760 --> 01:31:50,120
way that Minnie sometimes makes a smooch sound effect, the Pluto performer will go

2158
01:31:50,120 --> 01:31:54,920
like, make a noise while you get hit with this limp piece of vinyl.

2159
01:31:55,720 --> 01:32:02,360
Very funny moment in this ending sequence where Mickey and Minnie push their snoots

2160
01:32:02,360 --> 01:32:07,200
together to kiss like their snoots kind of bend upwards and then Mickey steps

2161
01:32:07,200 --> 01:32:13,320
forward and it's very clearly supposed to be a match cut so they can like put the

2162
01:32:13,360 --> 01:32:18,400
Mickey in the same outfit but with the gloves that shoot fireworks.

2163
01:32:18,880 --> 01:32:23,480
Probably a different performer, like probably the guy who's cleared for the fireworks.

2164
01:32:23,560 --> 01:32:24,760
Oh yeah, that's a special skill.

2165
01:32:24,760 --> 01:32:25,520
He's got a little more.

2166
01:32:25,520 --> 01:32:28,200
Yeah, he gets an extra 50 cents on the hour.

2167
01:32:28,240 --> 01:32:28,680
Yeah.

2168
01:32:28,840 --> 01:32:30,680
Because he's got stunts, basically a stunt.

2169
01:32:30,840 --> 01:32:32,000
And it does look fun.

2170
01:32:32,120 --> 01:32:32,800
It does look fun.

2171
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:33,880
They shoot off the fireworks.

2172
01:32:34,120 --> 01:32:38,080
It is, I don't know, I'm still a sucker for when Mickey just has like finger guns and

2173
01:32:38,080 --> 01:32:39,440
shoots fireworks out of them.

2174
01:32:39,440 --> 01:32:40,960
Well, yeah, yeah, that's great.

2175
01:32:41,400 --> 01:32:42,080
I mean, I like that.

2176
01:32:42,080 --> 01:32:44,480
I still am more of a fan and I actually forgot to mention this.

2177
01:32:44,680 --> 01:32:50,200
I'm still a fan of when Mickey is doing something like more of a human thing.

2178
01:32:50,200 --> 01:32:54,680
Like he's playing piano in the in the second street walking down the main street,

2179
01:32:55,680 --> 01:32:59,560
which I don't think he's actually playing, which kind of bums me out because I, you

2180
01:32:59,560 --> 01:33:00,880
know, I love Mickey playing.

2181
01:33:00,880 --> 01:33:01,280
I don't.

2182
01:33:01,880 --> 01:33:03,040
Yeah, probably not.

2183
01:33:03,040 --> 01:33:04,320
But maybe with the gloves.

2184
01:33:04,440 --> 01:33:07,720
But Mickey plays drums in parades and I love it.

2185
01:33:07,720 --> 01:33:08,960
I love seeing the guy.

2186
01:33:09,040 --> 01:33:10,720
Mickey, I love when he dances with the band.

2187
01:33:10,720 --> 01:33:11,680
I can never remember.

2188
01:33:11,840 --> 01:33:12,160
Yeah.

2189
01:33:12,240 --> 01:33:15,560
As you know, I like when Mickey shows up and does something, obviously at the end of

2190
01:33:15,560 --> 01:33:17,280
the hyperspace hoopla.

2191
01:33:17,840 --> 01:33:19,720
That's a big surprise though.

2192
01:33:19,800 --> 01:33:25,360
Uh, not necessarily rattling the insane twist drama history.

2193
01:33:25,360 --> 01:33:27,160
So, so I, I agree.

2194
01:33:27,160 --> 01:33:30,520
I like him shooting fireworks, but I, I would rather like have Mickey just like

2195
01:33:30,600 --> 01:33:32,400
making a turkey sandwich also.

2196
01:33:32,520 --> 01:33:35,200
I love Mickey doing kind of huge normal human things too.

2197
01:33:35,200 --> 01:33:38,440
You want the special to end with they say good night to everybody.

2198
01:33:38,440 --> 01:33:42,480
And then Mickey walks over to a little station and puts a sandwich together.

2199
01:33:42,480 --> 01:33:43,720
He puts a sandwich together.

2200
01:33:43,720 --> 01:33:43,960
Yeah.

2201
01:33:43,960 --> 01:33:44,240
Yeah.

2202
01:33:44,240 --> 01:33:46,040
And he cuts everything very precisely.

2203
01:33:46,080 --> 01:33:48,800
His end of day sandwich before he goes to bed.

2204
01:33:48,840 --> 01:33:50,280
Oh, who's on Carson tonight?

2205
01:33:52,760 --> 01:33:53,120
Yeah.

2206
01:33:53,120 --> 01:33:53,480
Yeah.

2207
01:33:53,720 --> 01:33:54,600
Oh, it's Monday.

2208
01:33:54,680 --> 01:33:55,720
Oh, Jay's hosting.

2209
01:33:55,760 --> 01:33:56,480
It's Monday.

2210
01:33:58,240 --> 01:33:59,880
Get the hippie bands on.

2211
01:34:00,200 --> 01:34:00,760
Yeah.

2212
01:34:05,080 --> 01:34:05,760
Oh, Divo.

2213
01:34:06,120 --> 01:34:10,600
If he like does some knitting or something, something where his hands have to be very

2214
01:34:10,600 --> 01:34:13,080
human-like while he's watching.

2215
01:34:13,360 --> 01:34:16,160
That's all better to you than the fireworks.

2216
01:34:17,440 --> 01:34:18,240
Delights me more.

2217
01:34:18,240 --> 01:34:18,840
That's better.

2218
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:19,160
Yeah.

2219
01:34:19,240 --> 01:34:23,160
Mickey's sweeping up while like Burt Lancaster tells an old story.

2220
01:34:23,200 --> 01:34:23,760
That's good.

2221
01:34:23,760 --> 01:34:24,120
Yeah.

2222
01:34:24,360 --> 01:34:25,600
I just like him moving fast.

2223
01:34:25,600 --> 01:34:28,200
Like a human, like maybe a sandwich is too slow.

2224
01:34:28,200 --> 01:34:30,760
And now that I think about it, I see it's been knitting.

2225
01:34:30,840 --> 01:34:36,640
It has to be like he's playing like roulette or something.

2226
01:34:36,880 --> 01:34:37,520
He's playing.

2227
01:34:37,640 --> 01:34:38,440
No, no, he's playing.

2228
01:34:38,440 --> 01:34:39,320
Roll that boat.

2229
01:34:39,480 --> 01:34:39,720
Yeah.

2230
01:34:39,720 --> 01:34:40,040
Yeah.

2231
01:34:40,040 --> 01:34:41,320
He's shaking dice.

2232
01:34:41,440 --> 01:34:44,520
Like something where Mickey has to be human in his motions.

2233
01:34:44,560 --> 01:34:46,200
Putting together a model train.

2234
01:34:46,440 --> 01:34:48,680
No, that's got to be slow, though, because that's so precise.

2235
01:34:48,680 --> 01:34:50,320
Like a ship in a bottle.

2236
01:34:50,800 --> 01:34:52,080
I mean, I still would like to see that.

2237
01:34:52,080 --> 01:34:52,400
You need it to be.

2238
01:34:52,400 --> 01:34:52,800
Sorry.

2239
01:34:52,800 --> 01:34:54,640
What speed do you need your Mickey close up shots to be?

2240
01:34:54,640 --> 01:34:58,880
I'm working this out as I say it, but I realize now when he's playing piano and he's

2241
01:34:58,920 --> 01:35:03,280
playing drums, he's being he's he's moving like a human and he's moving pretty fast.

2242
01:35:03,280 --> 01:35:05,240
I think that's what I like about it.

2243
01:35:05,280 --> 01:35:09,000
So he has to make the sandwich fast to fit your qualifications.

2244
01:35:09,200 --> 01:35:13,000
Yeah, I think he has to make the sandwich fast for me to like watching what Mickey.

2245
01:35:13,040 --> 01:35:16,400
So, yeah, when he's dancing, when he's break dancing, when he's playing drums,

2246
01:35:16,640 --> 01:35:21,960
when he's doing a fast sandwich, when he's might not get that mustard mayo on

2247
01:35:21,960 --> 01:35:23,000
evenly, but fine.

2248
01:35:23,040 --> 01:35:23,320
Right.

2249
01:35:24,360 --> 01:35:28,800
So you don't want to see him like, oh, I walked in here for the day for the life

2250
01:35:28,800 --> 01:35:30,880
of me, I can't figure out why I came in this room.

2251
01:35:30,920 --> 01:35:32,120
Isn't that the damnedest thing?

2252
01:35:32,120 --> 01:35:33,840
Yeah, no, I don't want to know none of that.

2253
01:35:33,840 --> 01:35:34,640
I want to see him.

2254
01:35:34,880 --> 01:35:38,560
Yeah, I want to see him like knitting a Christmas tree scarf, but very fast or skirt.

2255
01:35:38,560 --> 01:35:38,920
Excuse me.

2256
01:35:38,920 --> 01:35:40,640
Not scarf or scarf skirt.

2257
01:35:40,640 --> 01:35:41,240
What do you mean?

2258
01:35:41,240 --> 01:35:42,360
A Christmas tree skirt.

2259
01:35:42,360 --> 01:35:44,920
Like, oh, like what goes on the tree?

2260
01:35:44,920 --> 01:35:47,760
Knitting on these really fast knitting.

2261
01:35:47,760 --> 01:35:48,960
It's fast.

2262
01:35:49,160 --> 01:35:50,760
Well, I think some people knit fast.

2263
01:35:51,200 --> 01:35:52,280
Jason, what do you how do you best?

2264
01:35:52,280 --> 01:35:52,880
You would.

2265
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:55,600
I think people are get pretty good at it.

2266
01:35:55,600 --> 01:35:57,240
Can knit pretty fast.

2267
01:35:57,880 --> 01:36:01,440
I think most people buy their Christmas tree skirts if they use them at all, though.

2268
01:36:02,640 --> 01:36:04,720
My mom knitted one when we were younger.

2269
01:36:04,720 --> 01:36:05,000
Yeah.

2270
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:06,400
Oh, it took forever, though.

2271
01:36:06,480 --> 01:36:06,920
Yeah.

2272
01:36:07,800 --> 01:36:09,520
All the things to be done quickly.

2273
01:36:09,520 --> 01:36:11,480
And you want to quickly or you want it done right?

2274
01:36:11,760 --> 01:36:13,040
Yeah, that's not rush.

2275
01:36:13,040 --> 01:36:16,640
Mickey Mickey very busy and I'm sure really tired at the end of the day.

2276
01:36:16,640 --> 01:36:17,400
It's probably true.

2277
01:36:17,800 --> 01:36:20,480
Anything that he does fast, I like fast and human.

2278
01:36:20,560 --> 01:36:21,320
That's what I want.

2279
01:36:21,320 --> 01:36:24,160
My criteria is hand with his hands, with his hands properly.

2280
01:36:24,160 --> 01:36:29,840
But if he dances like I miss that era in this country where a mouse would work with his hands.

2281
01:36:29,880 --> 01:36:30,520
Yeah, that's true.

2282
01:36:30,520 --> 01:36:31,360
Down and dirty.

2283
01:36:31,360 --> 01:36:35,600
And that's from make something that's and fast, not slow.

2284
01:36:35,720 --> 01:36:36,720
That's like that.

2285
01:36:36,760 --> 01:36:38,320
That's from a Bill Maher stand up.

2286
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:43,200
That's right. We're just repeating club random stuff.

2287
01:36:43,560 --> 01:36:43,920
Yeah.

2288
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:44,320
Yeah.

2289
01:36:44,320 --> 01:36:46,840
Big NAFTA episode of Club Random.

2290
01:36:47,680 --> 01:36:51,040
Well, closing thoughts on Disney sing along.

2291
01:36:51,040 --> 01:36:52,560
So, I mean, it's a delightful watch.

2292
01:36:52,560 --> 01:36:57,200
If we didn't say the user Disney Dan will post a link, but he posted a pretty clean video of this.

2293
01:36:57,480 --> 01:37:01,400
I think there's a few of them, but an easy like twenty nine minutes, right?

2294
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:01,880
Oh, yeah.

2295
01:37:01,880 --> 01:37:03,120
And it's 30 seconds.

2296
01:37:03,120 --> 01:37:04,960
Oh, that goes down so smooth.

2297
01:37:04,960 --> 01:37:08,000
I didn't sing along myself, but you know what?

2298
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:08,600
You should.

2299
01:37:08,600 --> 01:37:15,760
If you know, it's difficult maybe to sing some of these songs that again, were only released in, you know, you don't know the lyrics.

2300
01:37:15,760 --> 01:37:15,960
Yeah.

2301
01:37:15,960 --> 01:37:17,920
Right down the middle of the U.S.A.

2302
01:37:17,920 --> 01:37:19,600
But, you know, learn them.

2303
01:37:20,120 --> 01:37:20,640
Watch it.

2304
01:37:20,640 --> 01:37:21,440
Listen to this episode.

2305
01:37:21,440 --> 01:37:23,240
Go back, then sing along.

2306
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:25,480
And if you want us, that's a suggestion.

2307
01:37:25,480 --> 01:37:30,200
If you want to hear us just to sing along track with, if you want to hear us sing along.

2308
01:37:30,280 --> 01:37:30,640
Yeah.

2309
01:37:30,640 --> 01:37:30,960
Yeah.

2310
01:37:30,960 --> 01:37:32,120
We're willing to do so.

2311
01:37:33,040 --> 01:37:44,720
If you want us to provide a sing along track or like a talk along track to all of our episodes where there's a screen and you say the riffs and like, I didn't watch Mary Poppins until I was.

2312
01:37:45,200 --> 01:37:45,360
Yeah.

2313
01:37:45,360 --> 01:37:47,280
Until I was an adult and then I did the full run link.

2314
01:37:47,280 --> 01:37:49,240
Sexy just push play robot.

2315
01:37:49,240 --> 01:37:49,920
If you want.

2316
01:37:49,920 --> 01:37:50,200
Yeah.

2317
01:37:50,200 --> 01:37:50,760
You repeat.

2318
01:37:50,760 --> 01:37:52,440
It's fun to say it with us.

2319
01:37:53,280 --> 01:37:56,720
Talk along with classic episodes like Six Flags Sucks and I love it.

2320
01:37:57,280 --> 01:37:57,480
Yeah.

2321
01:37:57,480 --> 01:37:59,560
To see famous, famous quotes.

2322
01:37:59,560 --> 01:38:06,440
And what we were thinking, like, are these crows that have descended upon our recording location going to kill us?

2323
01:38:06,520 --> 01:38:07,040
Mm hmm.

2324
01:38:07,200 --> 01:38:07,480
Yeah.

2325
01:38:07,480 --> 01:38:10,120
If you like the crows, we'll try to keep them around.

2326
01:38:10,120 --> 01:38:19,040
If you heard the crows again, this the club three is your club here in lives, fond memories of the past.

2327
01:38:19,360 --> 01:38:23,200
And here in lies where you can make us do bullshit in the future.

2328
01:38:23,200 --> 01:38:26,920
You survived the very first podcast, the ride club three.

2329
01:38:26,920 --> 01:38:27,640
And guess what, guys?

2330
01:38:27,640 --> 01:38:30,640
I have an idea of an extra sign off.

2331
01:38:30,760 --> 01:38:31,320
Oh, wow.

2332
01:38:31,320 --> 01:38:36,840
This because the people who have made it here are the super hard cores, right?

2333
01:38:36,840 --> 01:38:39,880
These are the people really making the show happen.

2334
01:38:40,760 --> 01:38:42,480
You know, the truest of the true fans.

2335
01:38:42,480 --> 01:38:46,320
And I feel like we owe a big thank you to the people who made it this far.

2336
01:38:46,480 --> 01:38:54,480
And, you know, beyond that, what we owe is like a nice moment at the end, a nice, intimate moment.

2337
01:38:54,480 --> 01:38:54,880
I agree.

2338
01:38:54,880 --> 01:38:56,240
I have just texted something.

2339
01:38:56,240 --> 01:38:57,360
See if you got that, Mike.

2340
01:38:57,360 --> 01:39:03,920
I want to give this to you to say, because this is based on your favorite ride.

2341
01:39:03,920 --> 01:39:05,080
The best ride moment.

2342
01:39:05,080 --> 01:39:10,880
And so this is something I want to say just to the only the club three members get at the end of the end of the episodes.

2343
01:39:10,880 --> 01:39:11,920
And I'm going to leave it to you to.

2344
01:39:11,920 --> 01:39:13,440
I'm going to be able to say this alone.

2345
01:39:14,360 --> 01:39:15,280
Yeah, you know, it's up to you.

2346
01:39:15,280 --> 01:39:17,760
We can we can certainly trade it, but I want to give you the inaugural.

2347
01:39:17,760 --> 01:39:18,360
OK, thank you.

2348
01:39:18,360 --> 01:39:19,240
Yeah, I appreciate this.

2349
01:39:20,640 --> 01:39:21,000
All right.

2350
01:39:21,600 --> 01:39:23,360
I really want to make sure first take here.

2351
01:39:23,360 --> 01:39:23,880
I'm going to do this.

2352
01:39:26,880 --> 01:39:29,840
Your bravery saved the podcast.

2353
01:39:30,880 --> 01:39:33,360
Well done, freedom fighters.

2354
01:39:34,520 --> 01:39:36,680
Wow, it's really photo voce.

2355
01:39:37,200 --> 01:39:39,680
Really? I mean, you made that intimate is what you did.

2356
01:39:39,720 --> 01:39:40,200
Thank you.

2357
01:39:40,560 --> 01:39:41,920
I could actually let me try it again.

2358
01:39:41,960 --> 01:39:42,960
OK, I'm more.

2359
01:39:42,960 --> 01:39:44,960
Yeah. Hey, you know, they made it here.

2360
01:39:45,400 --> 01:39:46,200
So they deserve it.

2361
01:39:46,200 --> 01:39:46,840
One more moment.

2362
01:39:46,840 --> 01:39:47,960
ASMR a little more.

2363
01:39:48,960 --> 01:39:51,680
Your bravery saved the podcast.

2364
01:39:52,600 --> 01:39:54,720
Well done, freedom fighters.

2365
01:39:55,560 --> 01:39:57,120
You're making an ASMR.

2366
01:39:57,160 --> 01:39:58,160
Wow. Yeah.

2367
01:39:58,720 --> 01:40:01,520
Optimus Prime doesn't whisper that in your ear.

2368
01:40:01,520 --> 01:40:04,040
Boot up the noise canceling headphones for that one, folks.

2369
01:40:04,040 --> 01:40:06,240
Well, I think he look in my dreams.

2370
01:40:06,240 --> 01:40:07,920
He does it right in my little ear.

2371
01:40:08,960 --> 01:40:11,360
In my not my dreams, but my memory.

2372
01:40:11,360 --> 01:40:15,240
I've turned that I had to look up what the line was because I've turned it into.

2373
01:40:15,520 --> 01:40:17,400
I'm proud of you. I'm so proud of you.

2374
01:40:17,800 --> 01:40:19,400
I am so proud of you.

2375
01:40:20,480 --> 01:40:22,840
I was kind of shocked to learn that it's well done freedom.

2376
01:40:23,080 --> 01:40:24,600
Yeah, he doesn't say anything about being proud.

2377
01:40:24,600 --> 01:40:26,680
Yeah. But hey, we are.

2378
01:40:26,680 --> 01:40:29,240
We're proud of you for making it to Club 3.

2379
01:40:29,520 --> 01:40:31,760
Your bravery saved the podcast.

2380
01:40:31,760 --> 01:40:33,640
You are the freedom fighters.

2381
01:40:33,640 --> 01:40:35,080
Make Club 3 possible.

2382
01:40:35,080 --> 01:40:37,520
Please give us what you want us to do next month.

2383
01:40:37,520 --> 01:40:40,000
We'll throw up a poll and we will figure it out.

2384
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:43,080
And we're excited to go on this journey together.
