1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:01,140
Forever.

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:03,540
Dog.

3
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:10,760
When your town has made you frown.

4
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:14,500
When your swear has made you swear.

5
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:19,060
When life gives you one more punch.

6
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:24,140
You need a doughnut soaked in Captain Grunge.

7
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:27,780
You need a place, a place to stroll.

8
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:33,780
With alcohol, a place that features part of the Berlin Wall.

9
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:37,780
Where steampunk robots sell chocolate snacks.

10
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:41,760
A place where you can tattoo your lower back.

11
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,760
So let's go take a walk.

12
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:48,960
Let's all go to City Walk Orlando.

13
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:51,940
Tonight, tonight.

14
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:02,520
A daily, extremely necessary series.

15
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,280
Exploring the shops, restaurants, and cosmic wonder.

16
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:09,420
That make up Universal City Walk Orlando.

17
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:13,280
Hey folks, welcome to podcast the Ride presents

18
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,580
the City Walk Orlando Saga Multiverse of Madness.

19
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,860
For the first time in Saga history presented before a live audience in Orlando, Florida.

20
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:32,380
Now at this point we need to try to conjure some ghostly spirits, some ghostly sounds.

21
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:35,000
I hear a little something.

22
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:36,500
No, that's the band next door.

23
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:38,800
Apologies listeners.

24
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:45,020
Here's what we, honestly I don't know that we can fully summon the Sector Keeper.

25
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:47,620
But if we all hear, let's put our hands together.

26
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,840
Let's pray in prayer and see if we can summon the Sector Keeper.

27
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:03,940
Boys, boys.

28
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:16,040
Today you face, face to sector one.

29
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:18,540
What?

30
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:24,620
Cinemark movie theater, fat Tuesday, Universal's great movie escape, good luck boys.

31
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,720
Okay, okay.

32
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:29,940
What is he clanging back there?

33
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:32,820
Oh, this haunted mansion-y, that's kind of exciting.

34
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,700
He sounds a little weird too.

35
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,320
I sound normal.

36
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:43,180
This is all strange because the Sector Keeper doesn't make bat sounds.

37
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,180
That's a different thing.

38
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:45,000
He really doesn't.

39
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,040
That's nothing he's ever done.

40
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,620
He doesn't really clang either.

41
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:51,140
He must have stolen that cowbell from Blake Shelton's old bread.

42
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:55,660
Yeah, they have a cowbell on every table.

43
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,640
That's the fun of going there.

44
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:58,280
That's why you go.

45
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,380
Well, let's be honest.

46
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,240
The Sector Keeper is not here.

47
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:07,280
We're trying to pull a fast one on you and we're not trying to rip you off, okay.

48
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:16,920
The Sector Keeper is not here, but he did send somebody instead, somebody who he fully approved of.

49
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:17,760
It's licensed.

50
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,420
It's franchised.

51
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,400
He is okay with this.

52
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,440
This counts as part of the Keeper verse.

53
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:24,480
I'm canon.

54
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:28,800
He absolutely is.

55
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,040
Yeah, it's him.

56
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,320
And he's itching to get out here, so let's get him out.

57
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:34,920
Please welcome the Sector Keeper's cousin, the Level Keeper.

58
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,080
The Level Keeper.

59
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,500
This is my thing.

60
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:51,200
I'm not sure how that sounded on that mic.

61
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:52,920
That might have been horrible.

62
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:55,460
Yeah, that's really rough.

63
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,780
Do it without the mic, I think.

64
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:01,000
Oh my God, the Level Keeper, folks.

65
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:01,680
Whoa.

66
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:02,820
I'm canon.

67
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:05,340
I'm canon.

68
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:07,360
Wow, geez.

69
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,900
It's pre-established.

70
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:11,780
Do you folks remember the Level Keeper?

71
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,460
We all do.

72
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:13,700
Obviously.

73
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:14,820
Obviously.

74
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:24,460
You all know the, except for anyone who anyone brought who does not listen to the show, who is beyond lost, they're going to go into the other room and watch the other band, for sure.

75
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:33,500
I think the impact of the Level Keeper was great enough that perhaps people have never listened to the show and know about him through osmosis.

76
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,240
Cultural omnipresence.

77
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:39,300
It just sounds exciting, whatever it is, I guess.

78
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:44,620
No, the Level Keeper, of course, was who we met at the end of the Downtown Disney ordeal.

79
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:49,900
And I'm sure we've all been wondering when we were going to close the loop and actually spend some time with the Level Keeper.

80
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,200
And it's happening here in Orlando.

81
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:52,580
What's up, Level Keeper?

82
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:54,860
It's been three years of wind up.

83
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,700
Four, four maybe.

84
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:01,240
Everyone, the Reddit threads have been going crazy.

85
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,840
PTR spoilers and leaks.

86
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:06,580
R slash PTR spoilers and leaks.

87
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,300
We don't want that.

88
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:07,820
Theorizing.

89
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,300
Post those Cali rotor pics.

90
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,000
That's where we.

91
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,800
Theorizing when I'd come back and whether or not my voice would sound exactly the same.

92
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:19,020
Because we all remember what the voice was.

93
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:23,340
And every bit of the story, everybody remembers everything.

94
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,100
Deep lore.

95
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:27,020
I died of a surge soda overdose.

96
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:31,480
After seeing jungle to jungle at City Walk.

97
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,100
We all remember my tragic backstory.

98
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:37,460
Absolutely established.

99
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:38,900
Everybody knows it.

100
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:48,140
Well, you know, I feel like it'd be nice if people kind of got to know like who you are as opposed to the Sector Keeper.

101
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:54,820
I mean, do you feel like he's in a pod or like, I mean, are you mainly here's what I want to know.

102
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:55,620
Are you going to be as.

103
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:56,500
We're cousins, of course.

104
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:58,060
We're cousins.

105
00:05:58,220 --> 00:05:59,820
I think that was established lore.

106
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,200
But I'm very much my own thing.

107
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:03,600
Good to know.

108
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:07,640
Do you care as much as him about like staying on track?

109
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:09,160
Yes, boys, boys.

110
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,160
OK.

111
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:12,440
OK.

112
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,280
I mean, in that case, maybe we need to get to it.

113
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:22,560
I hope there's someone in the crowd.

114
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:28,640
I draw it got dragged along to this and it's like, man, that guy on stage really looks like that one actor from Draft Tag.

115
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,420
I can't place him.

116
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:32,380
I forget his name.

117
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,040
We'll have to have him drop a coffee.

118
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,480
It'd be the only way to know.

119
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,560
Yeah, I heard that didn't make the final cut.

120
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:38,800
Only the trailer.

121
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,860
Well, Draft Tag complete.

122
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,420
It's no, they know the track.

123
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:45,400
That's canon.

124
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:47,120
OK.

125
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:52,080
So, you know, in the interest of keeping on track, here's the cool thing.

126
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,840
We didn't just meet backstage for the first time.

127
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:56,120
We've been buddies for a little bit.

128
00:06:56,180 --> 00:07:03,360
We've actually been hanging out at CityWalk Orlando together so we can actually speak to experiences that we've had.

129
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,000
We're buddies.

130
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,140
Shared experiences.

131
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,040
The four amigos.

132
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,700
We've been cutting it up all week.

133
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:12,720
Best of friends.

134
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,520
Best of friends.

135
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:19,620
And we have not gotten tired of you exclaiming everything in that tone.

136
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:21,340
12 hours a day.

137
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:23,220
It's been a pleasure.

138
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:31,800
I can't tell if this is getting dangerously far away from SectorKeeper and dangerously close to Justin Roiland.

139
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:33,100
Oh, no.

140
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:35,580
I'm getting worried in real time.

141
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,660
I cannot recommend that direction.

142
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,020
No one wants to be dangerously close to Justin Roiland.

143
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:42,160
This similarity is purely coincidental.

144
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:44,220
It is.

145
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,820
It's just Morty is with us now.

146
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,320
I'm not.

147
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,240
I'm my own thing.

148
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,540
Morty doesn't do this.

149
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:53,720
Morty has never done that.

150
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,840
It's totally different.

151
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:55,700
It's very different.

152
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,120
Let's talk a little about the first thing that we got to do together.

153
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,500
And this was you and me.

154
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,740
This was right when you rolled into town, right when you flew into town.

155
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:08,500
I took a lift straight to the first location.

156
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:11,440
Even ghosts have to take lifts.

157
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:13,420
I'm assuming that you are a ghost.

158
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,180
You're not like something else.

159
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,480
I'm a phantasm.

160
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,080
Let's be very clear.

161
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:22,920
A phantasm is not a ghost.

162
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,160
SectorKeeper is not a level keeper.

163
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:27,340
Level Keeper is a phantasm.

164
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:27,900
Got it?

165
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:28,820
Yes.

166
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:29,140
Great.

167
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:29,820
We're straight.

168
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,000
Ogden's not Augustine.

169
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:34,180
Okay.

170
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:40,300
So the first thing that we got to do is the first thing in the sector, and that is the

171
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:42,040
Cinemark movie theater.

172
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:45,300
A round of applause, I guess.

173
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:49,000
Are people big fans of the Cinemark brand?

174
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:51,700
It seems like they…

175
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:52,580
Yeah.

176
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,680
Rewards members?

177
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,380
Any rewards members?

178
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:56,940
Okay.

179
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:57,940
AMC for life.

180
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,980
I don't know.

181
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:03,960
Was it ever?

182
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:04,720
Yes.

183
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,200
It was.

184
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:05,700
Okay.

185
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,080
Well, you can see that our research is a little poor at this point.

186
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:15,360
We maybe will not be detailing every single ownership of that multiplex.

187
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,240
Some of this will get updated in post, I'm sure.

188
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:20,520
We'll cut it.

189
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,060
We'll blend it exactly right.

190
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,860
Get this echo just how it was here.

191
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:26,600
But you know what?

192
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:27,760
I love that we…

193
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:31,720
This is one of those moments where I'm like, I really like that we spent a bunch of time

194
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:34,180
in CityWalk because you're on a…

195
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,220
We're visitors.

196
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:35,940
Some of you guys might…

197
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,400
That might be your movie theater you go to.

198
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:48,740
For us, we're so busy doing rides and having fun that we neglect to take a little time

199
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:55,800
to just watch an entire feature film near rides about Minions and ET and stuff.

200
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:59,600
Look, I don't want to get into controversial territory.

201
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:06,160
But of course, we all live in the fallout of Martin Scorsese's statement that modern

202
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,840
blockbusters have become more like amusement park rides than art.

203
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:11,300
Yes.

204
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:11,960
That's true, right.

205
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:17,940
And we took that to heart and we said, perhaps it is time to walk into the Cinemark, plunk

206
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:23,740
down our American dollars and engage in a little bit of high art to take a break from

207
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:25,020
all the thrill rides.

208
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:25,800
Very good.

209
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:29,400
We put them next to each other and see how they compare.

210
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:30,900
A balanced breakfast.

211
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:36,480
I mean, I felt great about it.

212
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:36,760
We should talk…

213
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:37,360
Did anybody…

214
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,360
Let's go down the line.

215
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:46,340
Any experience here previously seeing a movie at that CityWalk movie theater?

216
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:48,160
Okay.

217
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:49,180
The audience says yes.

218
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,480
You know, my apologies.

219
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,720
I meant the hosts, but I'm glad we know…

220
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:54,160
You know what?

221
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:57,220
Everyone just shout out a movie you've seen there.

222
00:10:58,900 --> 00:10:59,360
Sixth Sense.

223
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:01,160
Sixth Sense is what I heard.

224
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,400
And it just opened?

225
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:03,140
Yeah.

226
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:04,260
Original or is it a re…

227
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:08,880
Originally, and we went after a show at Hard Rock and I had my webcast.

228
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:09,600
Wow.

229
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:11,200
One time was the show at Hard Rock.

230
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,680
It was like 8 o'clock.

231
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:13,940
It was my guitar teacher's band.

232
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,500
Your guitar teacher's band at Hard Rock.

233
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:16,840
Wow.

234
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:17,800
That's cool.

235
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,280
Wow.

236
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:25,380
So, of us, Mike, have you ever seen a movie at this movie theater?

237
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:26,680
At that specific movie theater?

238
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:26,980
No.

239
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,400
Have I seen a movie on vacation?

240
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:29,840
Also, no.

241
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:34,900
And the rationale being it's a waste of time?

242
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:35,980
Right.

243
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,540
We had plenty of movie theaters where I grew up.

244
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:40,040
That was not a problem.

245
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:43,100
So, we figured why not enjoy the local sights and sounds?

246
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:43,980
Yes.

247
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:45,960
A much more sensible thing to do.

248
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:46,320
Yeah.

249
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,600
I did have a good experience on a vacation a while back.

250
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,440
I was feeling a little theme-parked out.

251
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:56,680
I think one of the studios, maybe Universal Studios closed, and they happened to be doing

252
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:57,700
Back to the Future.

253
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,260
They happened to be doing a little revival and it was fun to see Back to the Future.

254
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:04,000
I think the ride must have been open back then.

255
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,160
At least the time train was there.

256
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:08,020
I saw the time train today too.

257
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:08,840
Oh my God.

258
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:11,060
You were with me, Level Keeper.

259
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:15,100
We were saying that's right where Jules or Vern pointed at their penis.

260
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,480
That weird little point.

261
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:22,220
We stood in front, looked at each other, pointed at our own penises and smiled.

262
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:26,140
Cinematic.

263
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,080
For ten straight minutes.

264
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:32,480
If people take photos of that though, they're going to know we're doing City Walk Orlando.

265
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:33,220
I am.

266
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,300
So, they just don't post those.

267
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:40,960
Level Keeper.

268
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:44,780
Well, you said, okay, Jungle the Jungle is where you were trapped.

269
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:45,760
Yes.

270
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:50,260
I was trapped in a perpetual screening of Jungle the Jungle.

271
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,120
Thank God I died in the middle of the funniest movie ever made.

272
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,120
It does loop.

273
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:59,040
You do get to see.

274
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:02,080
It's not just the first 45 minutes over and over.

275
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:04,160
No, I died in the end credits.

276
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:05,940
So, I get to see the full arc.

277
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:10,760
I make it to Mimi Siku climbing up the Statue of Liberty.

278
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,640
A scene both funny and poignant.

279
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:18,360
Incredible specific poll.

280
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,180
Okay, so you know, some people have just been there once.

281
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:25,940
Other people and ghosts are there forever.

282
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:26,880
Forever.

283
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,760
Glad we could get you out for a break tonight.

284
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:30,700
You free me.

285
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,800
Jason, any experience seeing films there?

286
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:34,480
Yes.

287
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:37,140
One time I had a lovely experience.

288
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:43,760
My family were regulars at Universal Resort down here a lot in the early 2000s.

289
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,860
Where we would come for like a long weekend, three or four days.

290
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:54,020
Stay at Hard Rock, you get the express and you just leisurely, you get on everything quick.

291
00:13:54,860 --> 00:14:00,520
And one night we were like, alright, I think we've had our fill of the parks.

292
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,060
We had dinner at Emeril's, rest in peace, Fallen Brother.

293
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:05,940
Fallen to the Fruit.

294
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:07,300
Fallen Brother at Emeril's, yeah.

295
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:11,780
And then we're like, hey, let's go see a big summer movie.

296
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:12,800
Let's go see a movie.

297
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,500
Never been to a movie theater here.

298
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:27,180
So we went and saw the new release, Superman Returns, starring Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor.

299
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:30,460
The Kevin Spacey vehicle, Superman Returns.

300
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:31,240
Wow.

301
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:33,220
Yes.

302
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,100
A great film.

303
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:41,020
A film where I remember when the third act kicking in thinking, oh, I can't wait to be trapped on this

304
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:48,140
Kryptonite Island with Kevin Spacey for 35 minutes.

305
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:53,620
Boys, out of sensitivity, maybe let's not focus on the Kevin Spacey of the movie.

306
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:57,310
And instead call it what it is, a Brian Singer picture.

307
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,480
No, no, no.

308
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,640
Yeah, Brian Singer, Kevin Spacey vehicle.

309
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:04,500
Oh, wait a minute.

310
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,900
You're locked in the 90s.

311
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:08,740
So you just remember what usual suspects, right?

312
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:11,680
With riding high, unproblematic kings.

313
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,140
Oh, that's right.

314
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:18,880
And you know Justin Roiland as being a cool nine-year-old.

315
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:23,480
A kid I hang out with who's well-adjusted.

316
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:30,860
You were one of those kids sneaking R-rated movies from Bawfuster.

317
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,640
You were getting usual suspects.

318
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,280
You were getting apt pupil.

319
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:34,720
Yes.

320
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,540
I like high art.

321
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:40,680
That's going to pay off big time when we tell you what movie we saw.

322
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:43,340
Oh, yes, absolutely.

323
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:49,160
Well, I mean, let's get to that because at first I was like, are we going to have time to do that?

324
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:55,320
Maybe, okay, what if I just buy a ticket to the movie theater and check the list off that way and don't even go and see anything?

325
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,720
Well, movies are expensive.

326
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,400
That seems like kind of a waste of money.

327
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:01,840
Then I realized the day we had slotted for this was Tuesday.

328
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:04,540
Cinemark does $5 Tuesdays.

329
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:06,620
Cheers for that.

330
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:07,680
You got to give them that.

331
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:10,560
I mean, I guess so does AMC, I think.

332
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,760
They probably stole the idea.

333
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,360
However, they do it.

334
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:17,020
So, okay, it's not going to cost a lot of money.

335
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:23,060
And at that point, I'm warming up to like, maybe I do see like a little bit of a movie or trailers and then some of a movie.

336
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:26,300
Then I'll go back and do everything else City Walk has to offer.

337
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:27,640
And what is it going to be?

338
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:33,360
Do I do, you know, to date when we're recording this, do I do just five minutes of Killers of the Flower Moon?

339
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,700
The tiniest or what?

340
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:39,000
Do I do one one hundred and tenth of that movie?

341
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:50,740
And I'm looking for like, well, I mean, it's not like I'm going to find some remarkable, odd, funny movie that only exists in this specific place.

342
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:51,780
Wrong.

343
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:58,100
A movie that has a connection to a neighbor of this building.

344
00:16:58,260 --> 00:16:59,440
That is correct.

345
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,650
Any guesses so far?

346
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:07,890
Folks, are you familiar with a feature film called Glisten and the Merry Mission?

347
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:16,290
I felt like people, maybe a few people were, but they weren't excited to say that they were.

348
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:20,910
But Glisten and the Merry Mission.

349
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:24,330
At first, I'm baffled by this poster.

350
00:17:24,330 --> 00:17:30,750
I'm looking at a poster that's like one of those like straight to video Snow White ripoffs from 1994.

351
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:32,370
Like, wait, are you sure?

352
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:33,970
You're sure you're playing this now?

353
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:35,770
This isn't like a glitch in the system.

354
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:38,870
Read the cast, read the cast above the title.

355
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:39,410
Yes.

356
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:44,510
Well, OK, first of all, another bit of text on the poster.

357
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:46,750
OK, what is Glisten and the Merry Mission?

358
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:48,930
Then I read, it's about believing.

359
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:50,230
Nice.

360
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:51,550
Nice.

361
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:52,310
Nice.

362
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:52,690
Yeah.

363
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:54,570
The theme of a movie.

364
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:56,190
Most posters don't tell you that.

365
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:57,370
Take that Scorsese.

366
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:01,690
Then I start reading the cast of this film.

367
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:03,470
Freddie Prinze Jr.

368
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:06,510
Michael Rapaport.

369
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:09,130
Billy Ray Cyrus.

370
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:14,870
Trinity Bliss, who is what?

371
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:15,470
Tuk.

372
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:15,990
Tuk.

373
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:17,890
In Avatar Way of Water.

374
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:19,510
The little Navi.

375
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:22,970
Tuk has grown up and she's doing a different voice.

376
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:27,890
Leona Lewis, who sings I See You from Avatar, not Way of Water.

377
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:29,790
So this is an Avatar reunion.

378
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:33,410
Dionne Warwick is in this movie.

379
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:34,630
Yeah.

380
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:40,090
And then and I'm like, hmm, well, is the deal sealed?

381
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:42,790
Let me scan all the way to the right on this poster.

382
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:43,690
Who is the and?

383
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:46,090
Oh, and Chevy Chase.

384
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:48,150
In.

385
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:50,030
Beyond in.

386
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:53,010
Then I look up a little spoiler for myself.

387
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:54,990
What is Chevy Chase doing in this movie?

388
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:57,430
Chevy Chase is playing Santa Claus.

389
00:18:58,830 --> 00:18:59,190
Yes.

390
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:01,570
And only five dollars.

391
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:08,430
But Scott, Scott, the cast you just read would cost tens of thousands of dollars.

392
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:16,970
To align what deep pocketed movie studio could finance such an expensive production?

393
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:17,670
Oh, I don't know.

394
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:19,130
I'm racing through options.

395
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:24,270
Well, you know, was it age 24 or was this a big is it Blumhouse?

396
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:25,470
Who put this thing together?

397
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:28,250
And then I turned to Jason because Jason knew.

398
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:33,010
Oh, yeah, I knew surprisingly a lot about Glisten.

399
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:37,350
And I went, oh, I know what that is.

400
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:41,310
That's the movie produced by Build a Bear Workshop.

401
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:46,550
Fully financed.

402
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:49,910
No outside partners.

403
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:54,510
A Cinemark exclusive release.

404
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:56,250
Exclusively Cinemark.

405
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:58,990
Build a Bear Christmas movie.

406
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:08,370
Every time you've been to Build a Bear and you bought little pants for your bear, you've been funding this movie for years.

407
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:10,450
That's what it's been building toward.

408
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:14,470
You've been you've been building your bear, but they've been building this movie.

409
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:19,630
They've been building a mythology and let the record show.

410
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:22,070
I just wanted to clear the air with them.

411
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:23,430
I made sure to let them know.

412
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:26,830
Oh, I was just poking around on the Build a Bear Workshop.

413
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:28,350
See what was there with the company.

414
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:30,730
Like you do.

415
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:32,690
That's actually true.

416
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:36,130
You were just discovering what's Build a Bear up to these days.

417
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:40,130
It happened where Scott was like texting and he's like, oh, I'm going to go see this movie Glisten.

418
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:42,030
And Jason goes, oh, the Build a Bear movie.

419
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:44,330
We were like, what?

420
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:48,390
Jason, do you have Google Alert set for Build a Bear?

421
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:49,630
Oh, I got them all.

422
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:51,010
Yeah, they're all blowing up.

423
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:52,710
Have you ever built a bear?

424
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:55,390
No, I've been in that store once.

425
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:56,770
I've never built a bear.

426
00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:58,810
Would you like to one day build a bear?

427
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:02,050
I was just seeing what was going on with the organization.

428
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:07,010
You're a fan of the corporate structure, not the bears themselves.

429
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:17,050
If I'm remembering correctly to another element was that Eva Anderson texted me this and said, have you heard about this with no other context?

430
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:19,050
Seems like an Eva thing.

431
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:20,690
That might have sent me down the rabbit hole.

432
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:29,550
Well, yes, one fact about Build a Bear Workshop is that this venue that we're in right now shares a wall with Build a Bear Workshop.

433
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:38,510
So if you go after our show, one of our shows, you can go meet some of the characters.

434
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:47,450
The title character Glisten, Marzipan, Lula, Donner, and Grizz.

435
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:53,930
Grizz is the one that I want to underline and jump in whenever because you saw this film too, Level Keeper.

436
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:54,750
Breakout character.

437
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:57,650
Okay, I took a…

438
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:58,510
let me see.

439
00:21:59,010 --> 00:21:59,810
I have it written down.

440
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:01,710
Okay, this is Grizz's description.

441
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:03,990
Voiced by Michael Rapoport.

442
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:09,050
And the character is the village grizzly with a tough reputation.

443
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:10,910
That just sounds…

444
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:11,830
there's like no twist there.

445
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:15,130
That's just like he's a bear who is mean.

446
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:24,730
And when they say village grizzly, I should under score that he sounds like he's from Greenwich Village.

447
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:28,430
In New York City, not at all the North Pole.

448
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:34,630
He sounds like a bear calling into a sports radio show.

449
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:37,050
What the fuck are the meds doing?

450
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:38,970
What is this organization all about?

451
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:40,410
I'm a bear.

452
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:43,630
I did many takes of all these lines.

453
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:46,130
These weren't notes app cold reads.

454
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:51,910
You gotta believe in the spirit of Christmas, but nothing's gonna help the Jets' season.

455
00:22:57,030 --> 00:23:02,110
So, and I believe they are open till 11, so you really can hear in our earlier show…

456
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:04,430
They're not going anywhere near it.

457
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:07,170
They're gonna send their Pinkerton's after us to break.

458
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:10,470
So we're getting the hell out of here as soon as these shows are done.

459
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:14,850
If you show up at Build-A-Bear at 1059, do they have to let you build a bear?

460
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:16,830
Yeah, if you're in…

461
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:17,750
stay in line.

462
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:19,310
If you're in line, stay in line.

463
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:24,350
They must let you build a bear if you're in line at 1059.

464
00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:31,010
You just might not have time in the minute to grab bear skin.

465
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:32,750
You might just have to save…

466
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:36,810
just put your mouth on the little thing and suck up as much as you can.

467
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:39,230
Save it for home.

468
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:42,150
Take your own shirt and build a bear out of that.

469
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:47,590
You're just holding the bear's skin and a big thing of stuffing and you're pushing him out the door.

470
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:48,010
It's to go…

471
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:49,390
I'll do it at home.

472
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:50,350
I'll do it later.

473
00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:54,830
By the way, the wonders of doing a show here at Tin…

474
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:58,870
Usually we're always happy to see smiling faces in our audience,

475
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:04,050
but something we don't usually get when doing a live show is a little train going by.

476
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:05,510
Yeah.

477
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:06,250
Off the window.

478
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:08,030
This rules.

479
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:11,250
And we're just looking…

480
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:15,490
my view…

481
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:14,350
maybe, Jason, you can see the full name from where you are.

482
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:19,670
I just see the neon word Ramsey, as in Gordon Ramsay.

483
00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:23,410
Oh yeah, that's Gordon Ramsay fishing chips across the way.

484
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:27,090
Does Gordon Ramsay's restaurant produce any movies?

485
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:30,870
Well, they should, let me tell you.

486
00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:36,630
Because I think that this racket has been going great for build-a-bear filmed entertainment.

487
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:43,490
I walked up to get a ticket at 1025 on a Tuesday afternoon.

488
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:46,070
I'm running a little bit late.

489
00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:50,530
All right, I'm going to miss some trailers.

490
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:52,910
I hope I don't bother anybody while I'm walking in.

491
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:57,310
I very proudly say, one for Glisten and the Merry Mission, please.

492
00:24:58,910 --> 00:25:02,310
Person at the window turns the screen around and says, you can pick any of the green.

493
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:04,170
It is 100% green.

494
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:09,970
This is an absolutely empty film.

495
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:12,610
Maybe like 70 seats, I want to say.

496
00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:16,390
And at this point, I've been texting the level keeper…

497
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:17,430
Level keeper!

498
00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:22,990
The level keeper, who was on the fence about do I want to see Glisten or not?

499
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:24,510
How much do you care about your $5?

500
00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:31,550
And once I said, it is an empty movie theater, please come hang out with me in an empty movie theater, the deal was sealed.

501
00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:32,330
I'm in!

502
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:37,690
Now, I've done a little research since seeing the film.

503
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:42,910
I've tried to really think on it, knowing I'd have to throw some takes out tonight.

504
00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:51,130
And I was very surprised because you mentioned anyone could go to the Build-A-Buyer next door now and buy…

505
00:25:52,290 --> 00:26:01,230
What we presumed were the exciting new characters introduced in this film who happen to synergistically now be plush toys for the first time.

506
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:02,030
Wrong!

507
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:13,410
You never would have guessed it from the airtight plotting, but this film is in fact loosely adapted from 15 years of seasonal plush characters.

508
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:16,610
Retrofitted into a story!

509
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:17,250
Whoa!

510
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:18,710
Oh my God!

511
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:20,910
Incredible info drop here.

512
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:21,490
Wow!

513
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:21,870
So you…

514
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:23,570
like, why am I explaining?

515
00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:27,310
I'm explaining Grizz and everyone in this room already knows all about Grizz.

516
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:29,770
As popular as the level keeper!

517
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:37,330
The series Bible for Glisten is just the biggest plush pile you've ever seen.

518
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:38,170
Yeah!

519
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:39,450
Wait, so Grizz…

520
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:40,590
hold on.

521
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:42,610
When you're going…

522
00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:44,670
I don't know why I just want to talk about Build-A-Buyer.

523
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:52,070
When you're going to Build-A-Buyer, I thought you would get a bear and you name it, but they have their own original characters that you're not allowed to name?

524
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:57,510
I don't know if you're really hard not allowed.

525
00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:02,910
Well, if they have a name, you shouldn't rename the character from Build-A-Buyer.

526
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:04,630
It is disrespectful, you're right.

527
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:05,390
Rude!

528
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:08,350
I pick gumdrop handcuffs.

529
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:08,930
Clink.

530
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:12,070
We're going to bury you in stuffing.

531
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:21,890
Because I would think that building your own bear, the idea is that you can create life in any way that you as the god imagines.

532
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:27,070
But what character could a child create more poignant than Grizz?

533
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:33,350
The bear who sounds like all of his dialogue was recorded before his first cup of coffee.

534
00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:39,950
Were there any jokes about Grizz having Riz?

535
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:44,090
Like having charisma, you know, style?

536
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:48,030
This is a young person word I've learned recently.

537
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:49,610
Jason and his young person.

538
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:51,630
That's why we need him.

539
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:53,790
He keeps us young.

540
00:27:53,810 --> 00:27:55,570
It seems like a given, right?

541
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:56,810
It seems like a given.

542
00:27:56,810 --> 00:28:06,890
Jason, I mean, I like your idea here, but do you think that a Build-A-Bear film in 2023 is going to have a new young person phrase?

543
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:15,230
Or do you think that they will have something like somebody telling an elf that they have been elf-splaining?

544
00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:17,810
Oh boy.

545
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:23,130
That is to answer your question about the slang tenor of the film.

546
00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:24,530
I'm a little behind.

547
00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:27,290
The character is still using fidget spinners.

548
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:28,710
It's like, oh, this thing.

549
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:38,130
So for a while I'm just like, wow, I'm in a movie theater and I can talk at full volume.

550
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:39,430
I can run laps.

551
00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:41,230
I can go up and down the stairs.

552
00:28:41,530 --> 00:28:44,690
I can respond to the Wonka trailer and say, sounds great.

553
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:46,090
See you soon, Timothy.

554
00:28:49,490 --> 00:28:51,570
This is for you, mama.

555
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:56,910
But I'm really excited for the level keeper.

556
00:28:57,150 --> 00:28:59,490
Having not seen the level keeper in so long.

557
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:03,450
Oh, the moment the level keeper walks in and sure enough, 20 minutes in.

558
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:07,930
What a blast that we get to just like hang out and chat.

559
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:10,130
Well, we had that decision to make.

560
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:13,850
Do we sit and watch the film or do we hang out and chat?

561
00:29:13,850 --> 00:29:20,830
And after about 10 minutes, I think it became clear that loudly talking about anything else was the best option.

562
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:22,310
Why not do both?

563
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:32,310
Also, unlike buying a ticket to Killers of the Flower Moon and leaving after 20 minutes, thus barely having a crumb of the film,

564
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:38,890
20 minutes of glisten in the Merry Mission was approximately 40% of the total running time.

565
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:53,750
Your other option was to take the elevator upstairs where Mike and Jane and I were like finishing the crumbling remains from the BK Whopper bar.

566
00:29:55,630 --> 00:30:03,550
We got a text while in the movie because we kept our phones on while speaking at full volume in a theater with no one else.

567
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:11,330
We got a text from Jason with a picture of Mike that just said, Mike is now explaining Jamiroquai to us.

568
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:17,170
Yeah, he was refreshing us on Jamiroquai.

569
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:24,530
He was telling us about the new action figure release, the 99 action figure.

570
00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:28,770
The new action figure is making a $100 toy of Jamiroquai.

571
00:30:29,290 --> 00:30:33,450
And it's the classic look, it's the hat, it's the blue shirt, it's from the video.

572
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:34,650
Of JK.

573
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:37,090
Of JK from, yes, Jamiroquai.

574
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:38,590
The hat guy.

575
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:43,310
And I was in that photo very casually leaning back and explaining.

576
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:48,350
Well, and you were explaining it because Jamiroquai, it's not from your telling, from your telling.

577
00:30:48,850 --> 00:31:00,390
You were, Jamiroquai was softly playing and Jane, here with Jason, did not know what the song was and you answered, it's very superstitious.

578
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:02,770
I thought it was very superstitious at first.

579
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:04,470
It was low, it was playing low.

580
00:31:04,610 --> 00:31:05,710
It was playing really low.

581
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:10,590
But I definitely pointed up and I said, there it is.

582
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:11,830
I did my famous point.

583
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:19,470
Let's also be clear, it doesn't sound like you were explaining Jamiroquai, it sounds like you were elf-splaining Jamiroquai.

584
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:24,090
The new phrase the kids use.

585
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:26,850
It's catching on.

586
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:29,890
Yeah, that's your hashtag when you leave the show.

587
00:31:29,910 --> 00:31:40,230
Mike, not to put you on blast in front of this kind audience, but I'm surprised you haven't made reference to my hat as someone who likes things that the kids like.

588
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:42,570
Oh, let's, yeah, did you get a good look at it?

589
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:47,150
Surely you recognize the statement on my hat and it means something to you.

590
00:31:47,190 --> 00:31:48,410
Can you read it out loud, Mike?

591
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:50,490
It says, uh, is that perfect?

592
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:51,090
Is that what it says?

593
00:31:51,330 --> 00:31:53,410
Perfect all-American bitch?

594
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:59,110
Does that ring no bells for you, Mike?

595
00:31:59,570 --> 00:32:00,990
Is that Olivia Rodrigo?

596
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:02,870
It's a track from Guts.

597
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:03,690
Yeah.

598
00:32:04,410 --> 00:32:05,250
Which half?

599
00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:06,970
Let's see.

600
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:08,810
Oh, I listened to the second half.

601
00:32:08,810 --> 00:32:09,550
Yay!

602
00:32:11,010 --> 00:32:12,250
I did, yeah.

603
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:15,650
Hold up, but I gotta figure out what song I really like because I can't remember the name of it.

604
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:18,630
Because let me be clear, this was meant as a bit of a test.

605
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:20,410
It is track one.

606
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:25,190
The one track we knew for the record that I listened to.

607
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:27,550
I know that song now that you say track one.

608
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:33,470
I know and love Olivia Rodrigo.

609
00:32:33,530 --> 00:32:35,110
I like her song, track one.

610
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:37,870
I am very young and cool.

611
00:32:37,870 --> 00:32:39,990
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

612
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:43,050
Pretty Isn't Pretty is a great song.

613
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:51,450
Okay, but is it as good as the song that I'm about to sing from Clisson and the Merry Mission?

614
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:58,010
We make our toys with hearts from the very start.

615
00:32:58,210 --> 00:33:02,070
With every part we make our toys with heart.

616
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:03,490
That's the song.

617
00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:04,330
That's in the movie.

618
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:12,590
I was obviously just learning it and the level keeper wasn't there yet, but I at least got a sense of the rhyme scheme.

619
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:15,210
So I started just yelling, heart, start.

620
00:33:15,930 --> 00:33:18,790
If you ever, yelling in an empty movie theater rules.

621
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:20,010
It's so much fun.

622
00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:21,430
Boy, I recommend it.

623
00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:30,990
This is a movie where at three different points, three different characters start a monologue explaining what Christmas is really about.

624
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:37,130
And each of them picks a different object that they say Christmas is all about.

625
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:38,610
And would you believe it?

626
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:44,150
All three objects exist as add-ons at Build a Bear Workshop.

627
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:45,670
What?

628
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:47,410
Hearts.

629
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:48,890
You put hearts in the bear.

630
00:33:49,230 --> 00:34:00,750
Sometimes Christmas is about heart, but also Christmas is about Glisten, the Sparkle, a Sparkle in the sky who used to be a deer, not a reindeer, a deer.

631
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:02,470
But is now a Sparkle.

632
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:09,010
And then of course Santa Claus tells us that Christmas is about one thing, a tiny pickle.

633
00:34:09,890 --> 00:34:10,610
What?

634
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:11,690
Yes.

635
00:34:12,610 --> 00:34:21,050
Even though the poster clearly says it's about believing, then it's about many, many other things.

636
00:34:21,390 --> 00:34:22,670
This is something that happened.

637
00:34:22,890 --> 00:34:29,170
The level keeper and I were discussing how we didn't, we genuinely did not.

638
00:34:29,170 --> 00:34:34,510
And maybe I'll speak for myself, do not understand who or what Glisten is.

639
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:37,710
Granted, I wasn't paying close attention, but is it a star?

640
00:34:37,990 --> 00:34:38,830
Is it a deer?

641
00:34:38,950 --> 00:34:40,110
Bit of a moving target.

642
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:44,070
She does not speak until the last 45 seconds of the film.

643
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:44,750
What?

644
00:34:45,010 --> 00:34:50,710
Every 10 minutes, one of us would nudge the other and go, I think that's Glisten and we were always wrong.

645
00:34:51,870 --> 00:34:53,990
I guess so many times.

646
00:34:53,990 --> 00:34:59,030
So Glisten is a waiting for Guffman kind of character?

647
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:07,030
She does show up and she's visible for a lot of the time, but in a form different than her real form?

648
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:11,670
Yeah, you know, it just becomes a nice statement, mainly about how bears are good gifts.

649
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:16,370
And you see a lot of bears parachute down into different houses.

650
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:20,170
There is a plush pile depicted on screen.

651
00:35:20,610 --> 00:35:21,150
Really?

652
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:25,910
At several points in the film, a tower of bears is constructed.

653
00:35:27,370 --> 00:35:31,110
So that's, do they ever at one point in the movie give like prices?

654
00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:38,010
You know, here's what they don't do this, but I wish they did.

655
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:46,290
What would be great is snowflakes are falling, but the snowflakes are QR codes and you could scan those in the theater.

656
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:47,090
Is that true?

657
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:48,670
No, I wish, I wish.

658
00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:50,390
But that's not unbelievable.

659
00:35:50,390 --> 00:36:00,850
There is a way to like interact with the film, which is if you're seeing it with only a ghost, you can get bored by the end,

660
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:06,550
get tired of guessing who Glisten is, go to the back of the room and start making shadow puppets on the film.

661
00:36:09,490 --> 00:36:14,150
I tried to make like, how can I turn my head into Crow from Mystery Science Theater?

662
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:15,990
How close can we get?

663
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:20,410
Wow, and people said the Errors tour movie was rowdy.

664
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:27,350
Anyway, was it nice to see another film?

665
00:36:27,370 --> 00:36:28,790
This must have been cool to like.

666
00:36:28,850 --> 00:36:29,450
Incredible.

667
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:33,310
The second best movie I've seen in the last 25 years.

668
00:36:33,910 --> 00:36:36,230
I want to call out two quick things.

669
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:50,190
One of them I said to you, I'm happy we found a movie to go see because otherwise it was going to ruin my letterbox stats of logging jungle to jungle every day.

670
00:36:50,650 --> 00:36:58,090
If I was leaving my cycle of hell, I needed to be replaced with another film to keep my letterbox stats up.

671
00:36:58,210 --> 00:37:00,150
You still have letterbox in hell, great.

672
00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:04,650
And you said you might be the first person to log this film on letterbox.

673
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:05,430
Wrong.

674
00:37:05,830 --> 00:37:07,890
I was surprised to see 21 reviews.

675
00:37:09,610 --> 00:37:15,530
For a movie I should say is no longer playing in a single theater in America.

676
00:37:15,970 --> 00:37:18,050
Wait, it's gone already?

677
00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:19,130
This was what?

678
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:20,730
This was three days ago.

679
00:37:20,830 --> 00:37:22,990
Was released November 3rd.

680
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:24,470
We saw it three days ago.

681
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:25,830
It's playing nowhere.

682
00:37:27,330 --> 00:37:27,970
Wow.

683
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:30,750
Sorry everyone.

684
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:35,430
But it has been logged 51 times and reviewed 23 times.

685
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:40,110
I will not read all the reviews but see if you can start to sense a pattern.

686
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:47,010
Silver owl 87 gives it two stars and says, I will get fired if it's lower.

687
00:37:49,290 --> 00:37:49,590
What?

688
00:37:50,450 --> 00:37:55,070
Dayquane gives it three stars and says, corporate nonsense by build-a-bear.

689
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:58,230
Me and two coworkers were the only ones in the screening.

690
00:38:05,790 --> 00:38:08,630
I hope there's only two people per screening.

691
00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:20,230
Keckas Exorcist gives it no stars and says, I was forced to see this movie as a build-a-bear employee.

692
00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:25,810
Oh my god.

693
00:38:25,890 --> 00:38:29,610
So only people that work at build-a-bear see all this except for you two.

694
00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:30,590
Correct.

695
00:38:31,830 --> 00:38:38,270
Mika Mikaela gives it half a star and says, I watched this in a theater with my build-a-bear coworkers.

696
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:45,410
And Cinemag is so obviously a personification of build-a-bear CEO Sharon Price John.

697
00:38:47,610 --> 00:38:48,290
Wow.

698
00:38:48,690 --> 00:38:50,790
The CEO is in the movie.

699
00:38:50,950 --> 00:38:57,090
There is no reported box office for this film's one week of release in only Cinemark theaters.

700
00:38:57,090 --> 00:39:04,510
But it is possible we are the only two people who are not employees of build-a-bear who saw this film.

701
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:07,030
Wow.

702
00:39:08,490 --> 00:39:14,450
It appears that it was strongly encouraged to all employees and they were told that tickets would be reimbursed.

703
00:39:16,010 --> 00:39:22,730
And several of the reviews say things to the effect of, I didn't want to see this, but since my boss was paying for it, why not?

704
00:39:25,370 --> 00:39:30,030
So possibly total box office of GLSEN and the Merry Mission, $10.

705
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:32,630
Give it up for GLSEN.

706
00:39:34,990 --> 00:39:35,790
Incredible info.

707
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:43,710
I feel like with that, to get some other stuff in, because it is a busy sector and this is kind of a smaller stop by.

708
00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:49,850
But I think we have to talk about somewhere that once you were in town, once we got in the movie out of the way,

709
00:39:49,850 --> 00:39:54,490
we all got to get drinks from the best place to get drinks there is, Fat Tuesday.

710
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:57,750
Fat Tuesday is in this sector.

711
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:03,070
Established in New Orleans in 1984, almost 90 locations.

712
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:07,950
There are multiple Fat Tuesday booths at CityWalk Orlando.

713
00:40:08,050 --> 00:40:10,950
We will cover a different one in a different sector.

714
00:40:11,690 --> 00:40:14,770
Sorry folks, I know you paid to be here, but we can't give you both.

715
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:16,590
It's a sector keeper thing.

716
00:40:17,030 --> 00:40:18,350
It's too important, yeah.

717
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:25,650
But why don't you guys, why don't you take the lead, because I looked at the drinks and said, fuck no.

718
00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:30,190
Scott doesn't like to drink neon.

719
00:40:31,810 --> 00:40:34,530
Which is something, you know, we talk about on the show.

720
00:40:34,610 --> 00:40:38,470
Now I am very comfortable putting neon liquid in my mouth.

721
00:40:40,550 --> 00:40:42,210
Almost excited, I would say.

722
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:44,130
Like thrilled to engage.

723
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:46,890
I would say generally I am excited to put neon liquid in my mouth.

724
00:40:46,890 --> 00:40:50,430
Is anyone drinking something neon-ish right now in this audience?

725
00:40:51,090 --> 00:40:51,830
Oh, I see a couple.

726
00:40:51,970 --> 00:40:52,610
I see some more.

727
00:40:52,930 --> 00:40:54,710
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

728
00:40:56,310 --> 00:41:00,120
I know a bright blue, obviously a Curacao would be the ultimate.

729
00:41:01,170 --> 00:41:02,250
What color did you go with?

730
00:41:02,370 --> 00:41:09,590
So I went up and I asked what the recommendation was, and one of the recommendations was electric lemonade.

731
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:12,190
Which was a very bright blue.

732
00:41:12,450 --> 00:41:13,930
The best color to drink.

733
00:41:15,430 --> 00:41:17,690
Let's hear it up for blue, I guess.

734
00:41:22,410 --> 00:41:30,030
And yeah, I mean, it tastes, as advertised, it was lemonade and it was sugar.

735
00:41:30,570 --> 00:41:32,830
And I drank it.

736
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:36,630
And I would say my stomach hurt.

737
00:41:37,090 --> 00:41:41,670
But I did enjoy, I did enjoy while I was drinking it, the first part of that.

738
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:45,110
But now when it was going through the tubes in my body.

739
00:41:46,290 --> 00:41:50,810
So your tongue enjoyed it, but your intestines and the names I won't say.

740
00:41:50,830 --> 00:41:52,670
They said tsk tsk, they were upset.

741
00:41:53,710 --> 00:41:55,790
Down the line, Jason, you had some of one.

742
00:41:56,270 --> 00:42:01,570
Jane and I split a pina colada and I don't have a lot to contribute.

743
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:04,530
We were like, oh, this is really good, this is delicious.

744
00:42:04,910 --> 00:42:06,850
And we enjoyed it and we felt fine.

745
00:42:08,750 --> 00:42:10,230
Well, isn't that nice?

746
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:12,470
We have the best case scenario.

747
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:18,190
This feels strange, knowing what happened to Mike and knowing what happened to the level keeper.

748
00:42:21,350 --> 00:42:27,930
Well, I was looking for a drink with this brief break from my purgatory cycle.

749
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:33,410
I was looking for a drink to take the edge off from my usual diet of surge soda.

750
00:42:34,450 --> 00:42:37,970
Overwhelmed by the options, I said, what's your most popular drink?

751
00:42:37,970 --> 00:42:45,710
I ordered the Octane 190, which is advertised as grain alcohol and orange juice.

752
00:42:47,610 --> 00:42:51,070
And it tasted like grains.

753
00:42:53,490 --> 00:42:56,570
Gasoline and orange juice.

754
00:42:58,170 --> 00:43:04,670
Yeah, I borrowed a sip from that and you took a photo.

755
00:43:07,070 --> 00:43:11,950
And the face of disgust, I will post this, I wish we could flash it through the room.

756
00:43:12,230 --> 00:43:13,910
It's not loaded up and ready to go.

757
00:43:14,990 --> 00:43:20,070
But yeah, I thought it was like I was drinking gas with a squeeze of orange.

758
00:43:20,290 --> 00:43:22,530
Was it caffeinated?

759
00:43:23,310 --> 00:43:25,870
It was not, and I wished it was.

760
00:43:26,110 --> 00:43:26,630
Really?

761
00:43:27,010 --> 00:43:29,670
For something to kick some life back into me.

762
00:43:29,670 --> 00:43:33,870
You wanted it to be, what do they call that, when it's uppers and downers at once?

763
00:43:34,470 --> 00:43:36,690
Yeah, I call that surge soda.

764
00:43:39,210 --> 00:43:46,090
I did some Googling, and of course the most popular grain alcohol brand in America is Everclear,

765
00:43:46,870 --> 00:43:54,050
which at various times has been banned for sale in Florida, including possibly currently.

766
00:43:55,370 --> 00:44:03,330
And Everclear has an alcohol proof of 190, and so the work around is in certain territories like Florida,

767
00:44:03,590 --> 00:44:08,410
they will often sell a varietal that is 189.

768
00:44:10,370 --> 00:44:15,390
So I believe I was drinking a 189 Octane 190.

769
00:44:15,790 --> 00:44:16,990
Oh my god.

770
00:44:17,350 --> 00:44:18,570
See, you got ripped off.

771
00:44:20,170 --> 00:44:22,530
That was the whole percentage point you didn't get.

772
00:44:22,530 --> 00:44:23,630
Give me the extra proof.

773
00:44:24,890 --> 00:44:28,210
You just got to get a second one and take a little teeny spoonful.

774
00:44:28,830 --> 00:44:29,230
A little spoonful.

775
00:44:30,690 --> 00:44:37,770
Well, try the bar at 10 Roofs, see if they'll cook you up an Everclear 189.

776
00:44:37,950 --> 00:44:41,170
Yeah, and please tip your bartender and wait staff.

777
00:44:42,070 --> 00:44:43,250
We tried to be very polite.

778
00:44:47,650 --> 00:44:51,410
Tip them by buying them an Everclear 189, obviously.

779
00:44:52,790 --> 00:44:59,050
Anyway, it was one of those moments that because you bring up your issues, drinking stuff like this now,

780
00:44:59,070 --> 00:45:03,330
and it's just, you know, we've been doing this podcast a long time,

781
00:45:03,730 --> 00:45:08,950
and there's always these things where like the both of you, Mike and Jason I'm referring to,

782
00:45:09,310 --> 00:45:17,750
it's like, I love to, I'm just a little boy eating my little boy treats, then like half an hour later,

783
00:45:18,110 --> 00:45:21,370
oh my tummy, my tummy.

784
00:45:22,270 --> 00:45:27,730
Jason and I are like the sugar buddies on the show, and we both like sugar a lot,

785
00:45:28,670 --> 00:45:32,110
but yes, sometimes the tummy, especially in the, I will say this,

786
00:45:32,330 --> 00:45:37,350
I do think I had too much sugar earlier in the day, and that is part of what did it.

787
00:45:37,410 --> 00:45:42,010
Like if you're challenging me about if I'm a man or not, or I can't handle electrical limited, I can.

788
00:45:42,270 --> 00:45:47,070
I can go right out to City Walk now and I can drink it, and I won't have weird poop or anything,

789
00:45:48,110 --> 00:45:53,630
but in that moment, I couldn't digest it, you know, because like I'm young, okay?

790
00:45:53,770 --> 00:45:57,010
I heard the album, I heard the second half of the Olivia Rodrigo album.

791
00:45:57,710 --> 00:45:59,950
I can still go, I can still do it.

792
00:46:00,150 --> 00:46:05,590
And I have started off every day at the hotel with a Danish, and I feel fine.

793
00:46:07,350 --> 00:46:10,250
This is the cockiest I've ever seen you.

794
00:46:12,610 --> 00:46:13,810
You got big D.

795
00:46:13,810 --> 00:46:13,970
E.

796
00:46:13,970 --> 00:46:15,010
right now, Jason.

797
00:46:16,590 --> 00:46:19,190
Big Danish energy, yeah.

798
00:46:24,650 --> 00:46:28,010
Oh boy, okay, I mean, I think that's the food portion.

799
00:46:28,130 --> 00:46:31,370
I think now we've got to get to the big ticket item.

800
00:46:31,730 --> 00:46:36,250
We did do a real themed experience, a real cool experience,

801
00:46:36,670 --> 00:46:42,230
which I believe some of you were doing not just today, but mere hours ago.

802
00:46:42,230 --> 00:46:43,230
Wow.

803
00:46:43,590 --> 00:46:44,130
Oh, in the back.

804
00:46:44,130 --> 00:46:48,650
There is a groove in the back that came from what we are talking about, incredible,

805
00:46:48,810 --> 00:46:54,590
which is Universal's great movie Escape, the new Escape Room.

806
00:46:55,910 --> 00:46:58,550
If you don't know about this, this is relatively recent.

807
00:46:58,610 --> 00:47:05,230
It opened less than a year ago, replaced The Groove, Fallen Brother, The Groove.

808
00:47:05,310 --> 00:47:06,870
Any experiences at The Groove?

809
00:47:07,030 --> 00:47:08,350
Make some noise for The Groove.

810
00:47:09,450 --> 00:47:11,730
Make some noise if you didn't like The Groove.

811
00:47:12,510 --> 00:47:13,030
Wow.

812
00:47:14,710 --> 00:47:16,150
Forceful claps on that one.

813
00:47:16,190 --> 00:47:16,990
We'll investigate.

814
00:47:17,230 --> 00:47:19,390
We'll do a Fallen Brothers thing.

815
00:47:20,150 --> 00:47:23,750
But anyway, this was a nightclub that got converted into an Escape Room

816
00:47:23,750 --> 00:47:28,630
and kind of a higher end Escape Room because they have these great cinematic properties to play with.

817
00:47:28,730 --> 00:47:33,010
There is one that is Back to the Future and there is one that is Jurassic Park.

818
00:47:34,370 --> 00:47:37,390
And we decided to do this.

819
00:47:37,650 --> 00:47:40,490
And we, of course, we let the level keeper decide.

820
00:47:41,190 --> 00:47:44,290
Because you made it in under the wire on both of those movies.

821
00:47:44,330 --> 00:47:47,470
You saw those before being trapped in Jungle to Jungle.

822
00:47:48,010 --> 00:47:52,370
Favourites, watched on VHS, the best home media format I ever knew.

823
00:47:53,430 --> 00:47:54,070
Makes sense.

824
00:47:54,530 --> 00:48:02,670
No, as a living child back in the day, I loved to run around Universal Studios Florida and ride the movies.

825
00:48:03,030 --> 00:48:08,170
And now finally an opportunity to slowly walk from room to room of the movies.

826
00:48:09,990 --> 00:48:11,570
Exit the movies.

827
00:48:12,850 --> 00:48:14,990
Be confused by the movies.

828
00:48:16,490 --> 00:48:18,150
Who has done this in general?

829
00:48:18,510 --> 00:48:18,710
Is there?

830
00:48:19,130 --> 00:48:19,750
Okay, okay.

831
00:48:19,870 --> 00:48:20,190
Very good.

832
00:48:20,730 --> 00:48:21,850
And the folks know that that's crazy.

833
00:48:21,910 --> 00:48:23,870
Now it's like you're still in the room.

834
00:48:25,510 --> 00:48:26,850
The final room.

835
00:48:26,990 --> 00:48:28,150
It was just a drive away.

836
00:48:29,370 --> 00:48:33,670
But so, I mean, I've been excited to check this thing out because that's a unique…

837
00:48:34,410 --> 00:48:40,070
And for us, my God, something to do in City Walk that isn't slushies that hurt you.

838
00:48:41,770 --> 00:48:46,070
So, yeah, we chose Back to the Future out of time.

839
00:48:46,190 --> 00:48:47,810
That's the one we went with.

840
00:48:49,030 --> 00:48:53,090
And I was excited and highly anticipating getting to like…

841
00:48:53,570 --> 00:48:59,790
I mean, all I knew was that there were bits and pieces that are kind of like the dearly departed Back to the Future ride.

842
00:49:00,110 --> 00:49:02,750
Not the part where you are on a ride.

843
00:49:03,310 --> 00:49:05,930
But the part where you're in a little room before the ride.

844
00:49:06,030 --> 00:49:09,270
But let's be honest, the little room before the ride was one of the best parts.

845
00:49:09,690 --> 00:49:11,870
I would really like to see that little room again.

846
00:49:12,250 --> 00:49:14,210
And sure enough, there was that little room again.

847
00:49:15,130 --> 00:49:16,510
But do you guys have any observations about…

848
00:49:17,150 --> 00:49:18,610
We can go beat by beat a little.

849
00:49:18,650 --> 00:49:21,210
Any thoughts about getting in there?

850
00:49:21,450 --> 00:49:24,210
Pre-show, the green curtain they pull?

851
00:49:24,490 --> 00:49:25,410
So they've done, yeah.

852
00:49:25,550 --> 00:49:27,910
So in the lobby, if you haven't been in there, it's like…

853
00:49:28,130 --> 00:49:31,350
It's made to look like a fancy old time movie theater.

854
00:49:31,350 --> 00:49:39,290
I assume because they want to be able to sub in and out universal properties, perhaps cycling them out if this is popular.

855
00:49:40,190 --> 00:49:43,370
So yeah, it's making you feel like you're back in time and in the old days.

856
00:49:43,410 --> 00:49:47,070
Not like you're in a Cinemark, but you're in like a fancy theater.

857
00:49:48,370 --> 00:49:48,370
What?

858
00:49:48,550 --> 00:49:49,810
Fancier than Cinemark?

859
00:49:50,610 --> 00:49:52,790
Fancier than a Cinemark, which by the way still has…

860
00:49:53,770 --> 00:49:57,070
Wait a minute, multiple posters of the Pelican brief?

861
00:49:58,450 --> 00:49:59,890
We forgot to mention.

862
00:49:59,890 --> 00:50:04,810
There are posters for the Pelican brief on both floors of the theater.

863
00:50:05,490 --> 00:50:05,950
Really?

864
00:50:06,210 --> 00:50:08,830
One significantly more sun-bleached than the other.

865
00:50:11,430 --> 00:50:13,130
Yeah, great trip through the past.

866
00:50:13,470 --> 00:50:15,330
Great trip through Kevin Costner films.

867
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:19,790
But yeah, yeah, very like art deco, you know…

868
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:21,490
Movie palace vibe.

869
00:50:21,890 --> 00:50:25,390
And there's a nice little lounge with couches and chairs.

870
00:50:25,390 --> 00:50:30,510
There's a bar with a drink menu, like cocktails and everything.

871
00:50:30,590 --> 00:50:32,530
The hoverboard punch.

872
00:50:34,930 --> 00:50:37,750
The gigawatt glow, the raptor bite.

873
00:50:38,250 --> 00:50:44,850
It would have been nice to try one of these, but again, we knew that we were cursed to go to Fat Tuesday.

874
00:50:45,070 --> 00:50:49,230
Fat Tuesday was happening after, yeah, and I didn't want to spoil my appetite.

875
00:50:50,270 --> 00:50:58,950
Not to mention, I don't know, the drunken escape room sounds tremendously frustrating, right?

876
00:51:00,690 --> 00:51:03,790
The senses are dulled and you're falling over.

877
00:51:04,250 --> 00:51:08,970
Yeah, spoiler alert for me, I'm not particularly good at puzzles.

878
00:51:09,090 --> 00:51:15,370
So even Stone Cold Silver, I was not the most helpful escape participant.

879
00:51:16,150 --> 00:51:19,570
Yeah, no, you go ahead, sorry.

880
00:51:20,570 --> 00:51:23,270
I mean, yeah, I don't think any of us do a lot of this stuff.

881
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:25,830
This was my first escape room of any kind.

882
00:51:25,830 --> 00:51:28,970
Well, we know what happened last time I tried to do an escape room.

883
00:51:31,670 --> 00:51:33,810
I had an anxiety attack.

884
00:51:35,110 --> 00:51:39,370
And it definitely entered my mind as we were starting.

885
00:51:40,330 --> 00:51:45,050
Which I think we picked the right one in that regard because has anyone done the Jurassic Park one?

886
00:51:45,590 --> 00:51:45,990
Okay.

887
00:51:46,170 --> 00:51:47,830
We heard that scary.

888
00:51:50,030 --> 00:51:55,610
Okay, okay, so maybe we're in the creature zone, we're in the Minotaur zone.

889
00:51:55,930 --> 00:51:59,150
It's something like a Minotaur, I can't guess what that would be.

890
00:51:59,170 --> 00:52:04,590
I don't know if you guys heard, I did go up to the front desk and I go, what's the signal in case I got to get out of here?

891
00:52:05,530 --> 00:52:09,210
And they were like, it's like this, and I'm like, oh, it's over your head more, yeah.

892
00:52:09,310 --> 00:52:10,510
And I go, got it.

893
00:52:10,790 --> 00:52:12,610
It's the same as WWE.

894
00:52:13,650 --> 00:52:15,590
Yeah, if somebody gets hurt in wrestling, yeah.

895
00:52:16,270 --> 00:52:19,970
Well, what's funny too about it is I think I pretended it wasn't for me.

896
00:52:20,070 --> 00:52:27,850
I think I said, if somebody in our group, and I kind of gestured to everybody as if like, oh, one of these people are going to be scared.

897
00:52:27,890 --> 00:52:28,950
And I was like, what is it again?

898
00:52:29,330 --> 00:52:32,550
And then I was like, can you look and see if I'm doing it right?

899
00:52:33,410 --> 00:52:39,830
Let's say in case one of Doc Brown's crazy experiments somehow, I don't know, results in a Minotaur being created.

900
00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:42,170
What do I do with my arms?

901
00:52:43,630 --> 00:52:44,110
Dr.

902
00:52:44,470 --> 00:52:46,010
Minotaur Brown, his son?

903
00:52:47,170 --> 00:52:50,530
I gave a list of possible scenarios and what I should do in case.

904
00:52:51,070 --> 00:52:53,890
And they were very nice, but I don't think they suspected.

905
00:52:54,550 --> 00:52:56,090
I don't think they knew what I was getting at.

906
00:52:56,130 --> 00:53:02,370
Because you were like, now if somebody in our group, like somebody, like a guy over there in glasses and a hat,

907
00:53:02,650 --> 00:53:07,310
like if somebody like that was scared, got really scared all of a sudden.

908
00:53:08,130 --> 00:53:12,590
That short little coward over there starts peeing his pants.

909
00:53:12,650 --> 00:53:13,310
What do I do?

910
00:53:13,410 --> 00:53:13,990
What do I do?

911
00:53:14,410 --> 00:53:18,590
We should also mention you were decked head to toe in no fear clothing.

912
00:53:21,970 --> 00:53:24,270
So no one could question your bravery.

913
00:53:26,250 --> 00:53:28,110
It was, I was bulletproof.

914
00:53:28,310 --> 00:53:30,990
I was, there was no way people would know.

915
00:53:31,330 --> 00:53:31,670
Wow.

916
00:53:31,890 --> 00:53:32,250
Wow.

917
00:53:32,870 --> 00:53:35,750
But did you, how cool was I being though?

918
00:53:35,850 --> 00:53:36,710
Did anybody notice?

919
00:53:37,310 --> 00:53:39,890
You were being very cool, Michael.

920
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:41,450
You were being very cool.

921
00:53:41,730 --> 00:53:46,610
You looked like a guy who had heard at least half of Olivia Rodrigo's guts.

922
00:53:47,190 --> 00:53:47,490
Thank you.

923
00:53:47,530 --> 00:53:52,590
You definitely came up to me and said, Hey, I'm just going to walk over there and ask a question quickly.

924
00:53:53,510 --> 00:53:54,670
Oh, I told you that?

925
00:53:55,450 --> 00:53:56,650
Oh, I don't remember that.

926
00:53:57,190 --> 00:53:58,230
I was like a little.

927
00:53:59,090 --> 00:54:00,770
But with kind of this gesture.

928
00:54:02,250 --> 00:54:05,210
He's probably asking if you can buy cigarettes here.

929
00:54:06,330 --> 00:54:08,850
You could smoke in the rooms, right?

930
00:54:09,570 --> 00:54:11,490
I'm going to smoke one cigarette per room.

931
00:54:12,270 --> 00:54:14,570
Every time I solve a puzzle, I'm going to light up.

932
00:54:15,930 --> 00:54:22,410
It's funny you said that there was a surprisingly large amount of fog in most of the rooms at various points.

933
00:54:23,130 --> 00:54:23,390
Oh, true.

934
00:54:23,530 --> 00:54:24,110
Yes, indeed.

935
00:54:24,150 --> 00:54:25,650
If you want to be trapped with fog.

936
00:54:26,710 --> 00:54:28,170
You are escaping the fog.

937
00:54:28,470 --> 00:54:29,370
It's mainly a fog.

938
00:54:29,710 --> 00:54:29,970
Yes.

939
00:54:31,710 --> 00:54:42,370
So first room you get into, you quickly meet an associate of Doc Brown, someone named Nico, which is a Tesla.

940
00:54:43,030 --> 00:54:44,210
It's a Nico Tesla.

941
00:54:44,530 --> 00:54:45,970
Nikodermis Tesla.

942
00:54:46,890 --> 00:54:47,770
Elon Musk.

943
00:54:47,990 --> 00:54:50,070
Her name was like six different science people.

944
00:54:50,350 --> 00:54:55,890
We should also mention the first thing we saw when the door open was the Institute of Future Technology logo.

945
00:54:56,210 --> 00:54:57,230
And you cheered.

946
00:54:57,230 --> 00:54:59,770
We all cheered when we saw that.

947
00:55:00,110 --> 00:55:00,770
Yeah, for sure.

948
00:55:01,110 --> 00:55:02,450
I mean, yes.

949
00:55:03,110 --> 00:55:12,710
Honestly, whatever else I say about this thing, the primary thing is they put up signs that are the logo from one of my favorite rides ever.

950
00:55:13,150 --> 00:55:14,590
So 10 out of 10.

951
00:55:14,910 --> 00:55:18,390
My biggest complaint is that it wasn't just wall to wall signs.

952
00:55:19,530 --> 00:55:19,670
Yeah.

953
00:55:19,990 --> 00:55:24,650
I was like, I would actually just like to sit in this room and not do any of the puzzles.

954
00:55:25,650 --> 00:55:26,690
Honestly, yes.

955
00:55:27,250 --> 00:55:27,250
Yes.

956
00:55:27,390 --> 00:55:28,230
But many of them.

957
00:55:28,230 --> 00:55:28,510
Yes.

958
00:55:28,510 --> 00:55:30,750
Just can I just can I sit here and sip a cocktail?

959
00:55:30,830 --> 00:55:31,990
That's all I want to do.

960
00:55:33,030 --> 00:55:36,130
But you're like, okay, well, Nico, but who's that to me?

961
00:55:36,210 --> 00:55:38,590
I mean, nice to meet her, but this isn't somebody I know.

962
00:55:38,610 --> 00:55:40,370
And then you hear the voice.

963
00:55:40,850 --> 00:55:41,590
Great Scott.

964
00:55:42,050 --> 00:55:45,650
It's Doc Brown himself in shadow.

965
00:55:46,730 --> 00:55:53,530
And it is clearly Christopher Lloyd sounding horser than I do increasingly.

966
00:55:53,530 --> 00:55:54,950
What are you talking about?

967
00:55:55,130 --> 00:55:57,370
I'm in the prime of my life.

968
00:56:00,650 --> 00:56:02,650
I could shout from the rooftops.

969
00:56:03,950 --> 00:56:05,230
It also correct me if I'm wrong.

970
00:56:05,290 --> 00:56:08,990
Did it not sound like maybe he did it into like his voice memos on his phone?

971
00:56:09,590 --> 00:56:12,110
Like it was not the highest audio quality either.

972
00:56:12,250 --> 00:56:12,870
Oh, yeah.

973
00:56:13,090 --> 00:56:16,590
On breaks, on breaks filming nobody.

974
00:56:16,750 --> 00:56:20,790
He was doing it in this trailer and we transferring it.

975
00:56:20,790 --> 00:56:21,690
He was just doing what?

976
00:56:21,750 --> 00:56:23,230
He's uploading it himself.

977
00:56:23,490 --> 00:56:23,890
Huh?

978
00:56:24,150 --> 00:56:27,550
You think an 85 year old Christopher Lloyd is uploading to WeTransfer?

979
00:56:28,750 --> 00:56:30,630
Well, it's so simple folks.

980
00:56:31,410 --> 00:56:31,970
WeTransfer.

981
00:56:32,710 --> 00:56:34,590
Even Christopher Lloyd could do it.

982
00:56:34,790 --> 00:56:36,090
Promo code check.

983
00:56:36,910 --> 00:56:44,270
At some point he says that there's been an experiment gone wrong and he's trapped in a box where you can only see his shadow.

984
00:56:44,570 --> 00:56:49,210
But they keep promising you that at some point he will definitely leave that box.

985
00:56:49,870 --> 00:56:55,710
They tell you, yes, we see you can't see his face, but he's going to get out of this.

986
00:56:55,750 --> 00:56:56,390
Don't worry.

987
00:56:56,490 --> 00:56:57,850
And then you'll get to see him.

988
00:56:58,570 --> 00:57:00,350
And then that doesn't happen.

989
00:57:00,390 --> 00:57:01,570
Yeah, spoiler folks.

990
00:57:01,730 --> 00:57:02,430
Doesn't happen.

991
00:57:02,650 --> 00:57:04,570
Unless, I don't know, did your group do better?

992
00:57:04,690 --> 00:57:05,970
Did it happen for you?

993
00:57:06,170 --> 00:57:08,530
Do you have to get a 15 out of 15?

994
00:57:08,790 --> 00:57:08,990
All right.

995
00:57:09,230 --> 00:57:09,910
No, it didn't happen.

996
00:57:11,090 --> 00:57:16,010
Anyways, but you get some instructions that are jargon.

997
00:57:16,090 --> 00:57:16,790
Here's what I've learned.

998
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:18,350
I'm terrible at listening.

999
00:57:18,350 --> 00:57:22,630
I didn't understand one thing that was said for this entire experience.

1000
00:57:22,990 --> 00:57:25,570
I knew that I had to pay attention to every detail.

1001
00:57:25,670 --> 00:57:28,510
So I'm there thinking, okay, remember, pay attention to every detail.

1002
00:57:28,750 --> 00:57:31,090
Wait, you're saying remember every detail to yourself.

1003
00:57:31,250 --> 00:57:33,910
Thus you're not listening to what you're supposed to be listening to.

1004
00:57:34,110 --> 00:57:34,950
Thus I failed.

1005
00:57:35,870 --> 00:57:40,690
I imagine what was happening was anytime I go into a long explanation of mobile ordering,

1006
00:57:42,290 --> 00:57:46,410
is you're like, do your best for 15 seconds and then your brain is just like, never mind.

1007
00:57:48,350 --> 00:57:57,730
Well, they set up in the first room that there's a portable flux capacitor that Doc has built like a handheld speak and spell form

1008
00:57:58,330 --> 00:58:02,810
flux capacitor that you're going to bring from time period to time period.

1009
00:58:02,850 --> 00:58:06,590
That requires not 88 miles per hour, but, you know, 0.

1010
00:58:06,590 --> 00:58:07,410
2.

1011
00:58:07,430 --> 00:58:07,890
Yes.

1012
00:58:08,050 --> 00:58:09,530
We're strolling with it.

1013
00:58:10,050 --> 00:58:17,510
And the first puzzle, I think, was we had to remember a series of letters in the right order, which took maybe 12 tries.

1014
00:58:18,350 --> 00:58:27,870
Well, there was the thing in the first room that kind of like it leans on your awareness of back to the future stuff and Doc Brown stuff.

1015
00:58:28,330 --> 00:58:33,850
And the first one, I don't remember what they were, but it was something like, you know, how do you invent the flux capacitor?

1016
00:58:34,070 --> 00:58:36,630
He hit his head and Mike goes, yeah, we know that.

1017
00:58:36,730 --> 00:58:37,110
He hit his head.

1018
00:58:37,130 --> 00:58:37,730
We know that.

1019
00:58:38,030 --> 00:58:39,170
Then there was another one like that.

1020
00:58:39,170 --> 00:58:39,830
Yeah, we know that.

1021
00:58:39,870 --> 00:58:40,670
Yeah, we know that.

1022
00:58:40,670 --> 00:58:51,730
And then and you were saying that loudly over everything else being said, hitting the button so fast, so indignant that they underestimate your awareness of back to the future.

1023
00:58:51,810 --> 00:58:54,670
And soon enough, you are getting them wrong.

1024
00:58:55,730 --> 00:59:01,570
It's possible that I was still a bit anxious and I am only realizing it now.

1025
00:59:01,950 --> 00:59:04,210
Honestly, that might have been what it was.

1026
00:59:04,310 --> 00:59:05,030
Yeah, we know that already.

1027
00:59:05,070 --> 00:59:05,790
Get us out of the room.

1028
00:59:05,830 --> 00:59:06,890
We know that already.

1029
00:59:07,010 --> 00:59:07,930
We can clear this one.

1030
00:59:07,930 --> 00:59:12,290
Scott did point it out and I do remember why do I keep hitting the button so hard?

1031
00:59:13,050 --> 00:59:14,350
So that's probably what it was.

1032
00:59:14,530 --> 00:59:14,650
Yes.

1033
00:59:14,690 --> 00:59:15,270
No, I was doing.

1034
00:59:15,430 --> 00:59:16,650
I started it off badly.

1035
00:59:16,750 --> 00:59:18,130
I admit it.

1036
00:59:18,170 --> 00:59:22,630
Show everyone your finger bruise, dark purple from button hitting.

1037
00:59:22,790 --> 00:59:23,950
That's not where I bled.

1038
00:59:25,030 --> 00:59:26,750
I bled from some other part of my body.

1039
00:59:26,910 --> 00:59:27,730
We'll tell you later.

1040
00:59:27,730 --> 00:59:32,470
But we do eventually conclusively solve this room.

1041
00:59:33,130 --> 00:59:38,390
There was a sense of completion and victory in this room.

1042
00:59:38,470 --> 00:59:38,770
Yes.

1043
00:59:39,450 --> 00:59:53,190
And we hear Doc Brown tell us that he's going to send us back to the 50s because that dastardly Biff has stolen the almanac again and is once again trying to ruin the prom, the enchantment under the sea dance.

1044
00:59:53,190 --> 00:59:55,030
And the next door opens.

1045
00:59:55,330 --> 00:59:56,910
There was a technical malfunction.

1046
00:59:57,410 --> 00:59:58,950
Oh no, Doc Brown messed up.

1047
00:59:59,010 --> 01:00:03,690
We're in 1885 and this room we fucking ate shit in.

1048
01:00:04,790 --> 01:00:07,590
God, God, it was really bad.

1049
01:00:07,810 --> 01:00:10,710
Something about pulling ropes and then making like a little.

1050
01:00:11,150 --> 01:00:11,790
And wheels.

1051
01:00:12,230 --> 01:00:13,550
Making a little dial dough.

1052
01:00:13,630 --> 01:00:17,650
We were spinning wheels for 10 minutes before we even identified that the rope was part of it.

1053
01:00:18,310 --> 01:00:21,890
This is where whoever, however they have their control room set up.

1054
01:00:21,990 --> 01:00:25,790
This is where we just we are getting dunked on by the people running this.

1055
01:00:25,890 --> 01:00:27,510
There's no way it wasn't happening.

1056
01:00:28,030 --> 01:00:29,710
We didn't know how to do anything.

1057
01:00:29,850 --> 01:00:32,050
We were like spinning things and it.

1058
01:00:32,390 --> 01:00:36,430
Because the first room was like like Simon like the old game Simon.

1059
01:00:36,470 --> 01:00:38,830
You just had to do it in the correct sequence.

1060
01:00:38,890 --> 01:00:40,030
They would tell you.

1061
01:00:40,030 --> 01:00:48,990
And then the second room was closer to an escape room where you kind of had to think outside the box and we were just like, oh shit.

1062
01:00:49,830 --> 01:00:50,730
Oh no.

1063
01:00:52,050 --> 01:00:58,810
Maybe I am not the most sharp from having recently watched the film Glisten and the Merry Mission in its entirety.

1064
01:00:59,090 --> 01:01:05,630
It took us at least eight minutes before we were doing anything that affected elements in the room in any way.

1065
01:01:05,630 --> 01:01:11,570
We were starting to see some tangible progress, but it didn't feel like we had cracked it.

1066
01:01:11,810 --> 01:01:15,350
And then Doc Brown came over the loudspeaker and said, great news.

1067
01:01:15,690 --> 01:01:19,490
I figured out an alternative way to get you to the next time period.

1068
01:01:21,370 --> 01:01:24,570
Which we found out is how they tell you, never mind.

1069
01:01:24,590 --> 01:01:26,050
Don't stress out about it.

1070
01:01:26,350 --> 01:01:28,310
Just open the door for you.

1071
01:01:28,310 --> 01:01:32,670
I feel like there's like three things that like three three lines of dialogue.

1072
01:01:32,670 --> 01:01:35,230
The first one is like, oh, here's what you have to do.

1073
01:01:35,270 --> 01:01:38,310
You have to pull the barn rope and do the blah blah blah.

1074
01:01:38,570 --> 01:01:39,910
And you go, OK, that's the instruction.

1075
01:01:40,110 --> 01:01:42,750
Then there's a thing in the middle that's sort of like a gentle hint.

1076
01:01:42,930 --> 01:01:44,450
Yeah, just a reminder.

1077
01:01:44,650 --> 01:01:45,430
Oh, just a reminder.

1078
01:01:45,630 --> 01:01:48,550
I told you the rope is a very important thing to pull.

1079
01:01:48,590 --> 01:01:50,630
And we're like, what is he fucking talking about?

1080
01:01:51,670 --> 01:01:54,810
And then another amount of time goes by and he goes, fuck you.

1081
01:01:54,850 --> 01:01:55,950
I'll do it myself.

1082
01:01:56,550 --> 01:01:59,710
That's the stage it goes from if you're in an escape room.

1083
01:02:00,190 --> 01:02:07,470
There was a sound cue in that room of like a mean cowboy threatening to murder us.

1084
01:02:07,470 --> 01:02:09,170
Oh yeah, clanging on the door.

1085
01:02:09,430 --> 01:02:14,790
But that also when you go in the room and it's like, he's banging on the door and you're like, oh shit.

1086
01:02:14,890 --> 01:02:18,930
And then like he's banging on the door for what feels like 10 minutes and you're like, he ain't getting in here.

1087
01:02:19,750 --> 01:02:20,970
This guy can't do shit.

1088
01:02:21,190 --> 01:02:23,450
Like it really, the danger goes away very quickly.

1089
01:02:23,450 --> 01:02:28,610
I did some digging into escape room subreddit reviews of this experience.

1090
01:02:29,150 --> 01:02:29,190
Yes.

1091
01:02:29,290 --> 01:02:36,030
And they said that unlike most escape rooms, which like your group rents it and it's yours until you solve it.

1092
01:02:36,430 --> 01:02:42,510
This every time you solve a room and go to the next room, they push a group into the room you were just in.

1093
01:02:42,870 --> 01:02:43,150
Really?

1094
01:02:43,330 --> 01:02:43,790
It's that fast?

1095
01:02:43,790 --> 01:02:50,610
And if that group solves things faster than they should, Doc Brown goes, well, I guess I figured out how to help you out.

1096
01:02:51,330 --> 01:02:58,630
Oh, so depending on how the people before you do, then Doc will chime in earlier and solve the problem for you.

1097
01:02:58,790 --> 01:02:59,170
Correct.

1098
01:02:59,490 --> 01:03:03,790
Those people who went in right after us were much better than us.

1099
01:03:04,750 --> 01:03:05,310
Wow.

1100
01:03:06,250 --> 01:03:06,850
That's crazy.

1101
01:03:06,930 --> 01:03:12,070
So they would let, they would let us like languish for 30 minutes if there was no group behind us.

1102
01:03:12,910 --> 01:03:13,470
Possibly.

1103
01:03:14,590 --> 01:03:15,030
That's it.

1104
01:03:15,090 --> 01:03:15,110
Yeah.

1105
01:03:15,110 --> 01:03:20,870
Oh, what a pity we didn't get to languish more in a room full of ropes and levers.

1106
01:03:22,070 --> 01:03:25,810
I like the fail safe of like, okay, keep moving, keep moving on.

1107
01:03:25,990 --> 01:03:36,290
Because when I have done escape rooms in the past and it's just one room you're set in, like there's a worker and they'll give you little hints.

1108
01:03:36,290 --> 01:03:39,030
But there's a lot more suffering.

1109
01:03:39,330 --> 01:03:45,500
There's a lot more torture of like, oh God, we can't get out of this room for another 35 minutes.

1110
01:03:45,990 --> 01:03:50,670
I like the idea of it, but in practice it did feel a little condescending.

1111
01:03:52,430 --> 01:03:57,290
One of your favorite movie characters of all time tells you you're a slowpoke.

1112
01:03:57,430 --> 01:04:01,210
You know, maybe just take a break, a breather, don't get worked up.

1113
01:04:01,530 --> 01:04:04,650
It is the opposite of the Optimus Prime thing, really.

1114
01:04:04,650 --> 01:04:05,130
Yeah.

1115
01:04:07,090 --> 01:04:09,050
I'm not disappointed in you.

1116
01:04:09,250 --> 01:04:11,550
Everyone has a tough time sometimes.

1117
01:04:12,950 --> 01:04:19,890
It also, it kind of kills the narrative stakes of the experience where they set up, we have a limited amount of energy.

1118
01:04:20,190 --> 01:04:23,810
You need to keep finding it and locating it to pushing us forward in the time.

1119
01:04:24,130 --> 01:04:28,490
And then once every 10 minutes, Doc Brown goes, I might have figured out another way.

1120
01:04:30,310 --> 01:04:31,770
I'm smart, remember?

1121
01:04:32,150 --> 01:04:33,590
That's the point of me.

1122
01:04:33,590 --> 01:04:36,050
Let's take the pressure off you guys.

1123
01:04:37,910 --> 01:04:46,330
But at least, you know, at least in success or not success, no matter what, you get to keep going through back to the future oriented rooms.

1124
01:04:46,750 --> 01:04:50,730
And one of the coolest things ever was, not ever, I don't know, coolest things that day.

1125
01:04:51,270 --> 01:04:52,390
In a day of a bunch of City Walk crap.

1126
01:04:52,390 --> 01:04:54,390
Oh, City Walk, the coolest things.

1127
01:04:54,670 --> 01:04:59,590
Maybe the coolest thing in City Walk now is getting to go into a little Cafe 80s.

1128
01:05:00,550 --> 01:05:01,670
Great to see it.

1129
01:05:01,670 --> 01:05:05,610
And why did they not do that in the park then or now?

1130
01:05:05,710 --> 01:05:06,690
Oh my God.

1131
01:05:06,690 --> 01:05:07,510
So cool.

1132
01:05:07,830 --> 01:05:12,230
We really should have just not solved and sat in the booths and just soaked it up.

1133
01:05:12,410 --> 01:05:14,350
The next group is banging on the door.

1134
01:05:14,950 --> 01:05:15,510
Yeah.

1135
01:05:15,990 --> 01:05:18,470
Probably the best room.

1136
01:05:19,090 --> 01:05:22,070
And I would say the most fun puzzles.

1137
01:05:22,070 --> 01:05:31,990
Which at a certain point Scott lying flat on his back on the floor to figure out codes.

1138
01:05:32,390 --> 01:05:34,230
Seems like you guys got it back there.

1139
01:05:34,350 --> 01:05:35,450
You figured it out.

1140
01:05:36,430 --> 01:05:40,930
Yes, you have to like look at stains and gum on the underside of a table.

1141
01:05:41,250 --> 01:05:43,370
That's a hint, I guess, if you haven't done the thing yet.

1142
01:05:43,470 --> 01:05:45,010
We all had to hold hands.

1143
01:05:45,090 --> 01:05:46,610
The power of friend trip.

1144
01:05:47,010 --> 01:05:48,350
Yeah, we did all hold hands.

1145
01:05:48,490 --> 01:05:49,970
And that was required.

1146
01:05:50,050 --> 01:05:51,250
It was mandatory.

1147
01:05:52,070 --> 01:05:52,650
Yeah.

1148
01:05:53,230 --> 01:05:58,510
I want you to hold hands with each other and confess how much you love each other.

1149
01:05:58,850 --> 01:06:03,150
Why doesn't the Back to the Future poster say it's about friendship?

1150
01:06:04,130 --> 01:06:06,230
Take a cue from Glisten.

1151
01:06:06,690 --> 01:06:11,390
Men of your age often have a hard time expressing intimacy with friends.

1152
01:06:12,810 --> 01:06:14,170
Touch them.

1153
01:06:15,830 --> 01:06:18,310
Acknowledge each other as sexual beings.

1154
01:06:20,170 --> 01:06:21,770
Everyone hold hands.

1155
01:06:22,070 --> 01:06:27,450
If there are two people in here in a confusing situationship, figure it out later.

1156
01:06:31,810 --> 01:06:40,470
You get to see, well, once again, like all of Time Paradox's hinge on this one school dance.

1157
01:06:41,250 --> 01:06:47,430
The universe is entirely predicated on a little Chuck Berry performance.

1158
01:06:49,370 --> 01:06:53,250
So you do, you have to plug some instruments in.

1159
01:06:53,410 --> 01:06:54,590
Did we get that right?

1160
01:06:54,770 --> 01:06:56,390
I don't remember what we did or didn't.

1161
01:06:56,390 --> 01:07:00,190
It seemed like we may have, but also they may have just switched it off.

1162
01:07:00,310 --> 01:07:01,050
I don't know.

1163
01:07:01,330 --> 01:07:02,390
Or switched it on.

1164
01:07:02,430 --> 01:07:05,790
Because yeah, you're supposed to plug in the different chords into the different mics and…

1165
01:07:06,430 --> 01:07:08,630
That room I think we did okay on.

1166
01:07:08,810 --> 01:07:10,770
That and Cafe 80's were the two.

1167
01:07:10,770 --> 01:07:11,390
Yeah.

1168
01:07:11,930 --> 01:07:13,730
And there's a phone on the wall.

1169
01:07:14,270 --> 01:07:16,170
Let's not say what song you have.

1170
01:07:16,270 --> 01:07:18,850
You have to sing a song altogether at one point.

1171
01:07:19,350 --> 01:07:19,830
We had to harmonize.

1172
01:07:19,830 --> 01:07:20,950
I'm not going to give it away.

1173
01:07:21,630 --> 01:07:22,110
Yeah.

1174
01:07:23,110 --> 01:07:28,750
That room is really like, that's an interesting idea is that like, oh, remember like a famous movie scene.

1175
01:07:29,050 --> 01:07:36,210
Now you're going to go like behind it and like help fix something before the scene plays out, which is a kind of a funny way to…

1176
01:07:36,290 --> 01:07:43,150
It's like that Tom and Jerry movie where they're just watching the Wizard of Oz, which we've talked about before on the show.

1177
01:07:43,350 --> 01:07:49,310
There's a cartoon, like a movie that's like the Wizard of Oz, but Tom and Jerry are just like hanging out in the background watching it go down.

1178
01:07:49,810 --> 01:07:51,350
And that's sort of like what we did.

1179
01:07:51,490 --> 01:07:53,370
We were the Tom and Jerry of Back to the Future.

1180
01:07:53,530 --> 01:07:53,670
Right.

1181
01:07:53,670 --> 01:08:02,130
It's a big recurring thread in this escape room is they keep on telling you, we swear to God the characters you know and love are right over there.

1182
01:08:03,010 --> 01:08:04,690
Take our word for it.

1183
01:08:04,690 --> 01:08:05,670
Yeah.

1184
01:08:06,190 --> 01:08:07,290
Yeah, they're fun.

1185
01:08:07,450 --> 01:08:09,170
But by the way, you can't see them.

1186
01:08:10,210 --> 01:08:11,710
You're not allowed to see them.

1187
01:08:11,990 --> 01:08:14,590
It will destroy the space time continuum if you see them.

1188
01:08:15,630 --> 01:08:16,070
I don't know.

1189
01:08:16,270 --> 01:08:16,490
That's funny.

1190
01:08:16,570 --> 01:08:22,150
You know what's very cool is seeing the Bif Tannen Museum as a big Back to the Future 2 head.

1191
01:08:22,450 --> 01:08:33,090
Pretty neat to end up seeing, you know, you go into an alternate 1985 type environment and Nico, the host who was nice to you before is now mean to you.

1192
01:08:33,090 --> 01:08:33,730
She's gone.

1193
01:08:34,270 --> 01:08:41,830
She got Biffed, which makes you feel mildly worse for how bad you've been doing the whole time.

1194
01:08:41,850 --> 01:08:44,770
But especially there, that room was awful.

1195
01:08:44,910 --> 01:08:45,990
We did terrible.

1196
01:08:46,210 --> 01:08:48,190
We made zero progress.

1197
01:08:49,130 --> 01:08:50,310
It looked great.

1198
01:08:51,150 --> 01:08:53,530
Like the props and the decoration.

1199
01:08:53,730 --> 01:08:55,050
It looked awesome.

1200
01:08:56,410 --> 01:08:58,130
We couldn't figure it out.

1201
01:08:58,130 --> 01:09:00,030
Yeah, no, it was very confusing.

1202
01:09:00,350 --> 01:09:07,330
Obviously, I liked being in the like gross like 80s velvet room, but it was like too, it was too confusing.

1203
01:09:07,610 --> 01:09:07,950
I don't know.

1204
01:09:07,970 --> 01:09:10,750
Did you see anything on the Reddit about what we were supposed to do?

1205
01:09:12,070 --> 01:09:15,430
I know answers for that room, but remind me when we're done.

1206
01:09:15,450 --> 01:09:19,070
I'll tell you the big realization I got from the Reddit.

1207
01:09:19,110 --> 01:09:22,050
Why not read a big Reddit thread to the audience?

1208
01:09:22,330 --> 01:09:22,710
Yeah.

1209
01:09:22,750 --> 01:09:23,450
Seems like fun.

1210
01:09:23,450 --> 01:09:28,770
I searched for spoilers and answers and it did not seem like anyone online figured that room out.

1211
01:09:28,990 --> 01:09:33,270
Without spoiling it, the group in the back, did you do anything successfully in that room?

1212
01:09:33,850 --> 01:09:34,470
I even did.

1213
01:09:35,210 --> 01:09:35,490
Whoa.

1214
01:09:36,170 --> 01:09:36,550
Wow.

1215
01:09:37,530 --> 01:09:39,050
That's a hard thing to yell.

1216
01:09:39,210 --> 01:09:43,230
I'm not going to make you yell the solve from the back of the bar.

1217
01:09:43,790 --> 01:09:48,570
Maybe we can talk after, but here's something that you can yell.

1218
01:09:48,570 --> 01:09:55,250
There is a scale of one to 15, ultimately, of how you did on this thing.

1219
01:09:56,570 --> 01:10:02,310
And I forget all of the rankings, but what did you guys get out of 15?

1220
01:10:03,670 --> 01:10:04,310
Eleven.

1221
01:10:04,770 --> 01:10:05,910
That's pretty good.

1222
01:10:06,030 --> 01:10:07,050
That's pretty good.

1223
01:10:07,170 --> 01:10:09,430
That is second notch, correct?

1224
01:10:09,950 --> 01:10:10,370
Wow.

1225
01:10:10,950 --> 01:10:13,270
Do you remember the ranking offhand?

1226
01:10:13,890 --> 01:10:15,470
Even though you just did it.

1227
01:10:15,850 --> 01:10:16,690
Memorable experience.

1228
01:10:16,690 --> 01:10:20,970
There were three titles that you could get to.

1229
01:10:21,250 --> 01:10:21,550
Four?

1230
01:10:23,070 --> 01:10:23,670
Yeah.

1231
01:10:23,670 --> 01:10:27,930
We were at the highest end of the lowest tier.

1232
01:10:28,170 --> 01:10:28,430
Yes.

1233
01:10:28,430 --> 01:10:29,990
Let's say our score, ten.

1234
01:10:30,130 --> 01:10:31,690
You guys in the back beat us.

1235
01:10:32,010 --> 01:10:32,630
Great job.

1236
01:10:33,230 --> 01:10:34,710
Your bravery saved the planet.

1237
01:10:34,830 --> 01:10:35,950
Well done, Freedom Fighters.

1238
01:10:35,950 --> 01:10:49,050
When we walked out, the cast member working there said, so how do you guys think you did?

1239
01:10:50,210 --> 01:10:50,410
I really…

1240
01:10:51,110 --> 01:10:51,690
Very nice.

1241
01:10:51,870 --> 01:10:59,450
The team member was very nice, but it really seemed like they were winding up to go like, you idiots.

1242
01:10:59,450 --> 01:11:06,870
I was hoping it was one of those college things where a teacher would be like, I'm going to give you the grade you think you earned.

1243
01:11:07,790 --> 01:11:09,730
And we could have said perfect.

1244
01:11:09,950 --> 01:11:12,010
We thought we did perfect or whatever.

1245
01:11:12,150 --> 01:11:16,190
I think she very quickly sensed that we were not feeling great about ourselves.

1246
01:11:16,330 --> 01:11:21,430
And she said, I'll have you know, you actually scored above average.

1247
01:11:22,250 --> 01:11:22,650
Yeah.

1248
01:11:23,670 --> 01:11:28,670
You got ten out of fifteen things, which is above average.

1249
01:11:29,450 --> 01:11:34,030
And I turned to Scott and I said, I think she's trying to make us feel better.

1250
01:11:34,470 --> 01:11:38,650
And they make up a score based on the mood of the people walking out.

1251
01:11:39,350 --> 01:11:44,650
When I went to the Reddit, and this was not a universal subreddit, it was an escape room subreddit.

1252
01:11:45,710 --> 01:11:51,290
The consensus seemed to be that most people got three or four things right in total.

1253
01:11:52,050 --> 01:11:52,510
Okay.

1254
01:11:52,510 --> 01:11:58,510
They also said that previously the score would be part of the screen in the final room.

1255
01:11:58,550 --> 01:12:02,950
They give you the number, which felt like a thing that was set up in the early stages.

1256
01:12:03,350 --> 01:12:15,810
And they removed it and had it changed to a cast member gauging your mood before because people were getting so pumped out hearing Doc Brown tell them they failed.

1257
01:12:17,810 --> 01:12:20,810
She said the average was seven or eight.

1258
01:12:21,450 --> 01:12:23,850
And then told us ten.

1259
01:12:25,050 --> 01:12:27,270
That makes so much sense.

1260
01:12:27,990 --> 01:12:30,770
Because ten is like, we wouldn't believe her if she said fourteen or fifteen.

1261
01:12:31,570 --> 01:12:35,830
We would have thought she was being nice, but ten makes you feel like you've got a B minus or a B.

1262
01:12:36,910 --> 01:12:37,270
Okay.

1263
01:12:37,370 --> 01:12:42,450
Well, if we talk to any of you after the show or after both shows, we're doing two tonight.

1264
01:12:42,450 --> 01:12:50,150
If you feel like saying a good show or whatever, gauge our mood first.

1265
01:12:51,090 --> 01:12:54,950
Or tell us ten, but don't tell us out of how many.

1266
01:12:55,510 --> 01:12:58,410
If it's out of one hundred, we'll never know.

1267
01:12:58,490 --> 01:13:00,970
Never tell us a lower number than ten.

1268
01:13:01,850 --> 01:13:02,650
Ten only.

1269
01:13:02,970 --> 01:13:10,720
And if you buy us a stuffed glisten doll, hand it to us and walk away without saying anything, we won't know what the hell that means.

1270
01:13:12,080 --> 01:13:16,980
One more observation, just as we're winding it down about this thing.

1271
01:13:18,320 --> 01:13:22,160
The final room, you're behind the clock tower.

1272
01:13:22,420 --> 01:13:25,840
So you would get, in a different form, you see Doc Brown's shadow.

1273
01:13:26,700 --> 01:13:36,560
Which is a cool perspective to be behind the clock tower, but it also means that as time is ramping up and of the essence and as the storm is brewing,

1274
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:40,060
that if you don't get it right, you're going to hurt Doc Brown.

1275
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:44,100
And you're going to have to watch it happen.

1276
01:13:45,180 --> 01:13:46,260
And hear it.

1277
01:13:46,780 --> 01:13:47,520
And hear it.

1278
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:53,440
And again, it is Doc Brown sounding a little older than when he made the films originally.

1279
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:55,380
What are you talking about?

1280
01:13:57,100 --> 01:13:59,180
You did this to me.

1281
01:14:00,820 --> 01:14:02,720
You want me.

1282
01:14:03,400 --> 01:14:03,980
Scott.

1283
01:14:03,980 --> 01:14:06,240
It's like the, it's the ET technology.

1284
01:14:06,940 --> 01:14:10,660
Scott, Jason, level ghost boy.

1285
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:11,640
Friend.

1286
01:14:13,180 --> 01:14:15,900
Your cowardice doomed me.

1287
01:14:16,900 --> 01:14:19,980
You killed me and Marty too.

1288
01:14:20,600 --> 01:14:24,100
He heard about what happened and took his own life.

1289
01:14:25,480 --> 01:14:28,980
Somehow our deaths made Biff stronger than ever.

1290
01:14:29,940 --> 01:14:31,860
He's become a mega Biff.

1291
01:14:33,060 --> 01:14:35,860
He's as tall as the clock tower now.

1292
01:14:37,060 --> 01:14:39,380
We'll leave you to clean up that mess.

1293
01:14:42,360 --> 01:14:47,220
Well, I think that's our experience with the Back to the Future escape room.

1294
01:14:48,460 --> 01:14:52,980
And that's, we're sort of heading to the end of our first show here tonight.

1295
01:14:54,140 --> 01:14:57,740
But I don't, okay, you know, I know you're filling in here.

1296
01:14:58,100 --> 01:14:58,780
Yes, of course.

1297
01:14:58,780 --> 01:15:05,560
You're not, and we haven't done one of these in a while, but just to remind you what the sector keeper does.

1298
01:15:05,860 --> 01:15:11,900
Usually his thing has been once we've completed a sector, then we get a sector stone.

1299
01:15:13,060 --> 01:15:13,540
Huh.

1300
01:15:13,540 --> 01:15:14,020
Yeah.

1301
01:15:15,660 --> 01:15:18,440
I think we all need to close our eyes.

1302
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:21,000
Maybe the people on stage, but not in the audience.

1303
01:15:21,260 --> 01:15:21,720
Okay.

1304
01:15:21,940 --> 01:15:22,280
Okay.

1305
01:15:22,300 --> 01:15:22,460
Yeah.

1306
01:15:22,460 --> 01:15:23,660
I don't see why they would have to know.

1307
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:24,980
And listen.

1308
01:15:25,340 --> 01:15:25,820
Okay.

1309
01:15:25,820 --> 01:15:33,040
Try to see if we can hear where the stone would be because we're on stage and this is a show and I'm trying to make it visual.

1310
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:34,560
Huh.

1311
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:36,940
Where would there be a stone?

1312
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:38,520
I don't know.

1313
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:40,140
I don't know.

1314
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:43,080
Hmm.

1315
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:44,120
Hmm.

1316
01:15:44,440 --> 01:15:47,760
They're putting out new cotton candy at Sugar Factory.

1317
01:15:49,900 --> 01:15:50,940
What are you guys doing after?

1318
01:15:51,020 --> 01:15:51,860
Doing the Ferris wheel?

1319
01:15:51,940 --> 01:15:52,700
What's the plan?

1320
01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:55,340
Sorry we couldn't do the show in the Ferris wheel.

1321
01:15:55,820 --> 01:15:56,640
That would have been fun.

1322
01:15:57,520 --> 01:16:01,080
Do I have time between shows to get up in the Orlando Eye?

1323
01:16:02,140 --> 01:16:03,760
Let's all cram into one little box.

1324
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:05,040
I'm running late.

1325
01:16:05,380 --> 01:16:08,040
I'm stuck at the top of the Orlando Eye.

1326
01:16:09,080 --> 01:16:12,920
Can you walk around and drink on iDrive like it's Vegas?

1327
01:16:14,240 --> 01:16:14,740
Yes.

1328
01:16:15,980 --> 01:16:16,180
Wow.

1329
01:16:16,340 --> 01:16:17,220
Is there a Fat Tuesday?

1330
01:16:19,440 --> 01:16:21,860
Is there like an equivalent to Fat Tuesday on iDrive?

1331
01:16:23,160 --> 01:16:26,500
There's a full Pizza Hut and a Chuck E.

1332
01:16:26,520 --> 01:16:27,980
Cheese right up the block.

1333
01:16:28,700 --> 01:16:28,700
Okay.

1334
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:32,880
I'm going to Doc Brown style admit defeat.

1335
01:16:33,100 --> 01:16:33,560
Yes.

1336
01:16:34,220 --> 01:16:35,840
My plan was not working.

1337
01:16:36,060 --> 01:16:36,360
Oh.

1338
01:16:36,360 --> 01:16:37,000
What was the plan?

1339
01:16:37,140 --> 01:16:37,440
What happened?

1340
01:16:37,720 --> 01:16:41,980
Well of course, a Build-A-Bear Grizz.

1341
01:16:44,040 --> 01:16:45,760
The Sector Stone.

1342
01:16:46,520 --> 01:16:48,020
It's Grizz.

1343
01:16:48,020 --> 01:16:56,260
With the real voice of Michael Rapoport, unfortunately is saddled with the quietest speaker I have ever heard in a toy.

1344
01:16:56,400 --> 01:16:58,660
Can everyone be pin drop quiet?

1345
01:16:58,860 --> 01:16:59,020
Okay.

1346
01:16:59,040 --> 01:16:59,720
Let's try it.

1347
01:16:59,720 --> 01:17:00,120
Let's try it.

1348
01:17:00,120 --> 01:17:01,400
This is going to be tough.

1349
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:06,340
No.

1350
01:17:06,840 --> 01:17:07,180
No.

1351
01:17:07,420 --> 01:17:11,800
I'm holding the mic directly up to where the sound is coming from.

1352
01:17:13,140 --> 01:17:22,860
I may have just made sure that they had a certain kind of Sector Stone at a Build-A-Bear workshop near this venue.

1353
01:17:23,300 --> 01:17:28,920
And when I picked this out and heard the speaker, I may have said, that's extremely quiet.

1354
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:31,840
And the employee might have said, huh, yeah.

1355
01:17:34,140 --> 01:17:35,500
Can you hear it?

1356
01:17:35,720 --> 01:17:36,280
No.

1357
01:17:36,620 --> 01:17:38,320
Not even right next to you.

1358
01:17:38,360 --> 01:17:39,940
Can you hear Michael Rapoport's sweet voice?

1359
01:17:39,940 --> 01:17:45,940
Just imagine him and his dulcet tone of voice going like, yo, yo, yo, I got to hibernate.

1360
01:17:46,180 --> 01:17:50,000
And it's like, he does that 24 hours a day.

1361
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:52,660
I heard it.

1362
01:17:52,860 --> 01:17:53,140
Wow.

1363
01:17:53,340 --> 01:17:56,280
If you really, you have to jam it inside your ear.

1364
01:17:56,460 --> 01:17:58,240
It has to be in your ear.

1365
01:17:58,500 --> 01:18:00,120
It's like the bell from Polar Express.

1366
01:18:00,220 --> 01:18:02,780
You can only hear it if you believe really hard.

1367
01:18:06,200 --> 01:18:08,100
And that's what the movie was about.

1368
01:18:08,100 --> 01:18:08,920
That's the movie.

1369
01:18:09,100 --> 01:18:10,340
That's what the movie is about.

1370
01:18:12,520 --> 01:18:13,020
Grizz.

1371
01:18:14,240 --> 01:18:16,260
Well, let me say something.

1372
01:18:16,360 --> 01:18:17,320
Let me say a couple things.

1373
01:18:17,400 --> 01:18:21,120
This is a stuffed Grizz that technically talks if you jam it inside your own ear.

1374
01:18:21,980 --> 01:18:26,100
And it has a shirt that is not something from the movie.

1375
01:18:26,300 --> 01:18:29,420
It says, I'm the reason Santa has a naughty list.

1376
01:18:31,280 --> 01:18:32,940
Oh, I got that shirt.

1377
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,360
But, you know, I'm level keeper.

1378
01:18:38,740 --> 01:18:42,120
First of all, I'm so happy you could do this in the Sector Keepers absence.

1379
01:18:42,620 --> 01:18:44,020
Thank you for being here.

1380
01:18:44,140 --> 01:18:45,840
Thank you for freeing me briefly.

1381
01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:47,180
Yeah, I think.

1382
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:48,220
Yeah, I guess.

1383
01:18:48,580 --> 01:18:50,740
Wait, you're free after one, right?

1384
01:18:50,940 --> 01:18:52,700
Or I don't know the rules of this.

1385
01:18:53,260 --> 01:18:54,540
I hope you're free.

1386
01:18:54,720 --> 01:18:58,300
I hope you at least get to like advance to a different Tim Allen movie.

1387
01:18:58,580 --> 01:18:59,240
Thank you.

1388
01:18:59,280 --> 01:19:01,640
I've heard good things about Joe somebody.

1389
01:19:04,160 --> 01:19:11,140
But, you know, our journey, our journey through city walk Orlando is a long and harrowing one.

1390
01:19:11,200 --> 01:19:13,820
And I know we're going to need every one of these sector stones.

1391
01:19:13,880 --> 01:19:15,380
But there's something else I know.

1392
01:19:15,740 --> 01:19:25,340
I saw a movie recently that was about believing and that was about, you know, how you got to buy bears and about a pickle, you said.

1393
01:19:25,500 --> 01:19:26,560
It's about the pickle.

1394
01:19:26,560 --> 01:19:27,860
And it's about the pickle.

1395
01:19:28,040 --> 01:19:35,020
But I think among the many things the movie was about was sharing.

1396
01:19:35,500 --> 01:19:36,500
Let's say sharing.

1397
01:19:36,840 --> 01:19:41,140
And I think that it's important to share with friends.

1398
01:19:41,420 --> 01:19:48,660
So I think that the Sector Keeper is going to be OK if we don't keep this special sector stone.

1399
01:19:49,660 --> 01:19:54,760
And I am curious, is Malia here?

1400
01:19:54,760 --> 01:19:56,120
Is Malia here?

1401
01:19:59,880 --> 01:20:00,920
And can you?

1402
01:20:01,480 --> 01:20:02,500
The stairs are over.

1403
01:20:02,660 --> 01:20:03,740
Malia, hi!

1404
01:20:04,860 --> 01:20:05,440
Wow!

1405
01:20:05,880 --> 01:20:07,160
Give it up for Malia.

1406
01:20:07,280 --> 01:20:07,980
Oh my God.

1407
01:20:08,060 --> 01:20:08,480
Hello.

1408
01:20:08,780 --> 01:20:10,100
It's great to see you.

1409
01:20:11,160 --> 01:20:14,780
People in the audience are chanting, let's fucking go.

1410
01:20:17,840 --> 01:20:23,680
They made friendship bracelets and I'm assuming they don't want to lug them home.

1411
01:20:24,120 --> 01:20:25,440
So make sure you get one.

1412
01:20:25,880 --> 01:20:31,620
Malia gave, we have friendship bracelets and a lot of the audience does as well.

1413
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:34,100
We've been seeing them as they've been coming in.

1414
01:20:34,740 --> 01:20:37,280
So it seems only fair that we do a trade.

1415
01:20:38,100 --> 01:20:38,100
Hello.

1416
01:20:38,360 --> 01:20:39,280
Give it up for Malia.

1417
01:20:39,580 --> 01:20:40,860
I'm so excited to see you.

1418
01:20:41,160 --> 01:20:42,060
Thank you.

1419
01:20:42,060 --> 01:20:43,860
It seems fair.

1420
01:20:44,100 --> 01:20:51,360
I think that the Sector Keeper, well let me have the Level Keeper say, can you just officially announce this is yours?

1421
01:20:51,740 --> 01:20:52,180
Hold on.

1422
01:20:52,620 --> 01:20:56,460
Let me see if I can support this in text.

1423
01:20:59,140 --> 01:21:05,380
Because I believe it already says that this Build-A-Bear was made with heart for Malia.

1424
01:21:05,420 --> 01:21:06,820
Oh my God!

1425
01:21:07,700 --> 01:21:08,760
Thank you.

1426
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:09,580
Absolutely.

1427
01:21:10,880 --> 01:21:11,280
Wow.

1428
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:11,680
Wow.

1429
01:21:12,360 --> 01:21:13,860
There you are.

1430
01:21:15,140 --> 01:21:16,300
Cherish it forever.

1431
01:21:17,740 --> 01:21:18,540
Any thoughts?

1432
01:21:19,160 --> 01:21:20,220
Any, in this suspicious moment?

1433
01:21:20,680 --> 01:21:21,180
Oh my gosh.

1434
01:21:21,260 --> 01:21:22,280
This is a dream come true.

1435
01:21:22,380 --> 01:21:23,340
Thank you so much.

1436
01:21:23,440 --> 01:21:23,920
Oh my gosh.

1437
01:21:23,940 --> 01:21:24,580
Thank you.

1438
01:21:24,920 --> 01:21:25,200
Yeah.

1439
01:21:25,220 --> 01:21:26,200
Give it up for Malia.

1440
01:21:26,900 --> 01:21:27,300
Wow.

1441
01:21:29,340 --> 01:21:32,400
Malia even cooler than a grizzly bear with attitude.

1442
01:21:33,760 --> 01:21:34,100
Wait a minute.

1443
01:21:34,180 --> 01:21:34,540
Wait a minute.

1444
01:21:34,660 --> 01:21:35,080
Wait, wait, wait.

1445
01:21:35,200 --> 01:21:35,520
Come back.

1446
01:21:35,540 --> 01:21:35,860
Come back.

1447
01:21:35,860 --> 01:21:36,720
You know what we should do?

1448
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:42,960
Let's make like the Back to the Future escape room and all join hands in the power of friendship.

1449
01:21:43,640 --> 01:21:43,840
Great.

1450
01:21:43,960 --> 01:21:44,260
Great.

1451
01:21:44,520 --> 01:21:44,900
Okay.

1452
01:21:45,300 --> 01:21:46,060
Mike, you got it.

1453
01:21:46,180 --> 01:21:47,060
For voltage.

1454
01:21:47,680 --> 01:21:48,820
We can take pictures of it.

1455
01:21:48,820 --> 01:21:49,580
This is a good theater.

1456
01:21:49,760 --> 01:21:49,980
Okay.

1457
01:21:49,980 --> 01:21:50,180
Okay.

1458
01:21:50,180 --> 01:21:50,820
Here we go.

1459
01:21:51,440 --> 01:21:52,980
And, and.

1460
01:21:53,440 --> 01:21:53,920
Hooray!

1461
01:21:54,380 --> 01:21:54,860
Yeah!

1462
01:21:58,700 --> 01:21:59,660
You survived.

1464
01:22:03,280 --> 01:22:04,300

Multiverse of Madness Sector.

1468
01:22:11,320 --> 01:22:13,020
Phase something, Sector something.

1469
01:22:13,420 --> 01:22:14,440
We'll remember it later.

1470
01:22:15,320 --> 01:22:17,800
Our thanks to everybody at Tin Roof.

1471
01:22:17,860 --> 01:22:19,160
This has been so much fun.

1472
01:22:20,080 --> 01:22:22,940
Our thanks to Connor and Eric for helping us out tonight.

1473
01:22:23,640 --> 01:22:25,100
Our thanks to the Sector Keeper.

1474
01:22:25,200 --> 01:22:25,680
We'll see you soon.

1475
01:22:25,760 --> 01:22:27,940
But especially thanks to the Level Keeper.

1476
01:22:28,120 --> 01:22:29,200
Thanks for being here.

1477
01:22:30,480 --> 01:22:32,220
Coming all the way from heaven.

1478
01:22:33,300 --> 01:22:36,180
And especially thanks to all of you for coming out.

1479
01:22:36,220 --> 01:22:37,520
We've missed you in Orlando.

1480
01:22:37,620 --> 01:22:39,700
We've missed everybody who traveled so much.

1481
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:41,300
It's so great to see you again.

1482
01:22:41,700 --> 01:22:46,240
Thanks for being here and remember the future is what you make of it.

1483
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:47,300
Yeah!
