1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:10,160

00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:11,160
old restaurant.

00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:19,360
It may veer dangerously into discussion of wet meat, hash houses, and nude witches.

00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:24,880
The Sloppy Boys Tim Cow Packets joins us to talk Walt Disney's beloved LA Haunt, The Tam

7
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:48,280
O'Shanter on Podcast the Ride.

8
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:54,280
Welcome to Podcast the Ride, a podcast about theme parks where we say step aside red table

9
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,280
talk.

10
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,120
Today's all about Walt table talk.

11
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,440
I'm Scott Gardner, hey Mike Carlson.

12
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,440
Hey, I'm here.

13
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:05,840
I was going to really dish with you guys and get into some of the like heavy stuff about

14
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,480
our relationships, but I'm not going to do that now.

15
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,480
No, no.

16
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,800
We're going to talk about Walt.

17
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:14,440
What they miss is we're talking about the actual table more often.

18
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:17,840
We're going to, yes, people want literal table talk.

19
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:18,840
That's right.

20
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:19,840
You know, there isn't, we aren't in front of one.

21
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,840
There's no table to, no table now.

22
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:24,800
No, no, we're talking about a table that's like a couple miles away.

23
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,280
Jason, Sheridan, hi.

24
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,280
Hi.

25
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,280
Yeah.

26
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:32,320
Um, I, you had me going for a second cause I was like, first I had to take a beat to

27
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:37,920
remember what red table talk was, which is the Facebook, Facebook watch dominant.

28
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,920
Yeah.

29
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,920
Jada Pinkett Smith show.

30
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:41,920
Okay.

31
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,560
Uh, yeah, but no, and then it became crystal clear when, when I remembered what we were

32
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,560
talking about today.

33
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,280
Great.

34
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,280
Great.

35
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,280
Great.

36
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,280
Great.

37
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,280
Uh, and I'm glad you reminded people what it is, but also keep his, uh, wife's name

38
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,280
at your,

39
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,280
Well, yeah, you know, I'm promoting your show.

40
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,280
I've done more.

41
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:01,320
I've done more promotion for the show than Facebook has in quite some time.

42
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,560
That's a good point.

43
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,040
So, and I don't know that are that red table.

44
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,680
I don't know if it has a tiny little plaque on it that you can't put like a plate or

45
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,680
drink on.

46
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:15,160
Someday if they ever sell the house and start a restaurant where the red table is, uh, today

47
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:19,000
we're talking about a Los Angeles restaurant called the Tam O'shanter, a restaurant that

48
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,760
was very important to Walt Disney and very important to us, I think.

49
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,520
And this topic comes courtesy of a great guest who's joining us, uh, partially because Reddit

50
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:32,040
user greedy cauliflower said, why isn't he been on yet?

51
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,800
I said, I don't have an answer for that.

52
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,800
He should be.

53
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,800
That's great.

54
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:40,280
Glad he got greedy for our awesome guests from the sloppy boys podcast from birthday

55
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,520
boys from comedy, bang, bang, sting, cow, pack, it's high.

56
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,520
Yo, how's it going?

57
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,520
Thank you.

58
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,520
I'm a cauliflower.

59
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,400
You did.

60
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,960
You got him here.

61
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,960
You're on one person.

62
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,960
I had no choice.

63
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,960
I had no choice.

64
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:55,160
I had to, um, question about red table talk.

65
00:02:55,160 --> 00:03:01,880
Is that where the gift or, or like the meme of, of sad will comes from like crying, sad

66
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:02,880
will.

67
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:03,880
I think it is.

68
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:04,880
Yeah.

69
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:05,880
I could be, don't quote me on that.

70
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:09,240
When she talked about her polyamory, maybe they were talking.

71
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,760
I know I'm not a big watcher.

72
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:14,280
I don't watch it as much as I watch something like, I don't know, club random, bill Mars.

73
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:19,880
But I do know that, yeah, I think she discussed the polyamory and the things like that.

74
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:26,520
Uh, that's where I came to a head and she referred to it in strange oblique terms.

75
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,520
Yes.

76
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:31,200
Uh, I think it's a very angry, clearly a very honest show.

77
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:37,680
I'll say that's a lot raw, honest, uh, it's club random is a different vibe than that.

78
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,200
So I'm much a little more into the frivolity and the fun of them.

79
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,200
Yeah.

80
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,200
This is our show.

81
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,120
We get pretty raw and honest.

82
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:54,120
We're going to say some, uh, some real gritty opinions about the roast beef today.

83
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,280
How much fat should be in a steak?

84
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,240
Jason is going to get it.

85
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,240
We're all crying about it.

86
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:05,840
Bone chilling when you realize what restaurant overcooks the hamburger every time I would.

87
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,840
Oh boy.

88
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,840
That's sad.

89
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,840
That's sad.

90
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:13,960
Um, before we get into that, Tim, just to touch on some of the other stuff we talked

91
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:18,280
about when I asked you to come on and also just to, uh, to bring up something you have

92
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:21,600
in common with Jason, you're both Jersey shore people.

93
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,600
There we go.

94
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,600
Yes.

95
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,600
You mentioned, well, okay.

96
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:28,040
Maurice peers in Maurice peers in wild wet.

97
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,040
Wait, I don't, I don't know.

98
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,840
I don't understand the naming structure of the Jersey shore places.

99
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:37,320
The town that I went to is wildwood, like way down at the tippy bottom of the Jersey

100
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,320
shore.

101
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:43,520
And there's just like the wildwood boardwalk is like this two or three mile stretch of

102
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,200
just like pizza places and cheese steak places.

103
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:51,120
And then every once in a while you get to appear where there's roller coasters and the

104
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:56,880
peers like in the nineties and early two thousands when I was going there, the, like the part,

105
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,800
the brand or whatever that owned it was Maurice.

106
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,400
So it was like, so I was telling you, like I was being very technical and saying it's

107
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:07,480
Maurice peers, but you would really just say like, yeah, wildwood, New Jersey, Jason, where

108
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,520
did you go?

109
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,760
I, my family has always gone to ocean city a lot.

110
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,760
Love it.

111
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:15,800
And my dad went to Atlantic city growing up and we still go.

112
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,200
Is ocean city the one from the MTV show?

113
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:22,560
No, I think seaside heights, further up north.

114
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,560
Yeah, no ocean city notable.

115
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:29,440
They called this once and they've used it in marketing for like 20 years.

116
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:34,880
I think travel, the travel channel called it America's favorite, like family resort

117
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:38,480
for being a dry town.

118
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:42,400
So you can bring alcohol in, but you can't buy it on the island.

119
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:47,720
So you have to take any bridge where you will then find a warehouse sized liquor store at

120
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,080
the foot of every bridge immediately.

121
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,080
Yeah.

122
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,080
How could this be anyone's favorite?

123
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,400
Anything that doesn't make sense.

124
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,400
Who called it that?

125
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,400
What's that?

126
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,400
Who called it that?

127
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,280
So they, and they hung onto it for dear life.

128
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:03,360
Like a travel channel, like ranking, like popular vacation spots.

129
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,680
Sanity.

130
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,680
We're stripping that title right now.

131
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,680
Yeah, that's gone.

132
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,680
I don't like the sound of any of this.

133
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,680
Yeah, that's gone.

134
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,680
What's the vibe of this place?

135
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,920
Is this, was this like a, was it like a rinky dink?

136
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:14,920
Was it falling apart?

137
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,280
Was it surprisingly impressive?

138
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:21,080
It was pretty good when I was there, but like it wasn't rinky dink and it wasn't, it wasn't

139
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:25,240
dingy, but it was kind of frozen in time.

140
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:29,920
Like my experience there was, I don't know about you, but it's like, I was surprised

141
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:36,240
to then see the Jersey Shore TV show because like the clubby, maybe what like the older

142
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,560
kids were up to or people in their twenties were up to.

143
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:44,800
Um, actually, do you remember there was like an episode of MTV true life that was about

144
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,800
the Jersey Shore?

145
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:50,080
Where is it about like a Philadelphia guy going and he would like try to find love with

146
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,560
the Jersey Shore every summer.

147
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:56,360
And then the end with him like back in Philadelphia at his construction job, like with a sledgehammer

148
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:59,640
hitting cinder blocks, like, well, I'll try again next year.

149
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:07,360
But I, so I didn't see Jersey Shore, the sort of like boozy partying, uh, Jim tan laundry

150
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,360
vibe.

151
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,360
I didn't see any of that.

152
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,440
This was more like, it was more like boardwalk empire or something.

153
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:16,880
It was like real old school ski ball, Bruce Springsteen type of Bruce Springsteen.

154
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,880
Sad.

155
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,880
So it was sad.

156
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:24,840
Everything that happened in boardwalk empire happened to me in my, wow.

157
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,120
For me, it was just a lot of water.

158
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:29,680
It was a, I was like a very slick, chubby little kid.

159
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,000
So I was really good at, um, uh, water slides.

160
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,920
Do you mean slick?

161
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,640
Like you were, you were naturally wet.

162
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,880
Like you were, you were hairless.

163
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:43,480
I was sweaty, just kind of Greek American sweat already on my body, but there was a

164
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:46,360
timer on one of the slides at the water park there.

165
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:49,480
And I just like went down at normal and then a lifeguard pulled me aside and was like,

166
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:52,200
Hey, you qualified for the, for the championships.

167
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:57,120
And I was like, mom, dad, can we come back in two weeks for the championships?

168
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,760
I'm like, no, no, but like a speed run.

169
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,760
Yeah.

170
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:05,200
That like, that like, I was like nine years old and that really stoked my ego that I was

171
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,640
really good at water slides.

172
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:10,680
Who knew that you wouldn't just go the speed of the water that's carrying you down.

173
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:14,280
But I think I just like shot ahead real fast.

174
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,060
So I was really into the water slides.

175
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:19,200
And then like, as the roller coasters got big and bigger, I was into that.

176
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,920
There's like famous pizza places and famous cheese steak places that I was obsessed with.

177
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:28,160
And it was just really, and it was like maybe my first little sense of independence.

178
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:32,320
Like I could bring a friend on our family vacation and then we'd like walk up and down

179
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,600
the boardwalk.

180
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,440
One of the stores had like playing cards with naked ladies on them.

181
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,760
And we saw stuff like that.

182
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,600
Very formative experiences on that boardwalk.

183
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,040
That wasn't like behind a beaded curtain or something.

184
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,040
It was just out.

185
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:48,220
It kind of was behind, it was not the beaded curtain, but it was behind the counter.

186
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:51,020
You did have to ask the guy to buy them and we chickened out.

187
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:54,740
Wait, was it shown to you then?

188
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:56,500
It was brought down, but not purchased?

189
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:01,380
No, it was like on a shelf with like, you know, kind of what would it be?

190
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:04,100
The other pervy stuff or even just like cigarettes or whatever.

191
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:11,100
It was just like, or maybe like tequila in a gun shaped bottle or things that need to

192
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,140
be behind the guy's head.

193
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:13,180
It was back there.

194
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:17,140
But yeah, the wildwood is always.

195
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,380
I mean, it is wild.

196
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:23,260
It's coincidentally it is a little wild and appear as wood on it.

197
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:24,260
So yeah.

198
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:31,300
So the Jersey Shore kind of splits like North Jersey Shore points like Seaside Heights,

199
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:34,620
which is a lot of people from New York, South Jersey.

200
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:39,820
It's a lot more people from Philadelphia just by sheer like closeness and like length

201
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,060
of drive time.

202
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:46,300
So that's what I because I remember Jersey Shore coming on TV and going like, I kind

203
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:49,540
of recognize this, but some of this is also unrecognizable.

204
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,700
Like, this is not my experience.

205
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:54,540
Yeah, right. There's more of a wildwood being way down there.

206
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:55,500
It's like almost Delaware.

207
00:09:55,500 --> 00:10:00,180
It's like a mid-Atlantic vibe and it's more like families eating crabs and stuff like

208
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:03,540
that. It's not like, hey, we're yeah, we're it's not like city kids coming down to go

209
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:06,260
nuts. There's a bunch of like, yeah, famous pizza.

210
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:08,620
Like in Wildwood, there's pizza called Max.

211
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:11,740
Yeah, I love there's a bunch of them in Ocean City.

212
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,500
It was Mac and Mancos.

213
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:17,860
And then the Mancos side of the family like split from the Mac side.

214
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:20,140
So then it became Manco and Mancos.

215
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:23,500
And regardless of that, someone still went to jail for tax fraud.

216
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:27,940
There's a lot of Pennsylvania Jersey establishments.

217
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:31,700
It's like Tony Luke said, I mentioned it in Pasa.

218
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:35,940
It's like cheese, eggs and Italian pork sandwiches.

219
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:38,900
And I mentioned in passing that like, oh, yeah, they were talking about opening more

220
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:41,460
franchises across country and they were going to open one in L.A.

221
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:46,980
My dad's like, yeah, I think Tony Luke and Tony, Tony Luke Jr.

222
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,540
and senior might be serving.

223
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:50,940
I think they got the electric chair.

224
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:55,620
I remember when I remember of Max Pizza, I loved it so much when I was a kid.

225
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:58,700
It's like super thin crust, tasting a cracker, almost crunchy.

226
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:02,780
But when you watch them make it, there's no illusion that it's like, oh, these are

227
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:06,140
the best ingredients to the point where the tomato sauce is coming out of a hose.

228
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:06,860
Yeah, they got the hose.

229
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:08,820
Why? Right on the pizza.

230
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:10,660
Yeah, I love it.

231
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:12,780
It's a sauce hose. I've never ever seen it.

232
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:13,740
Pressurized.

233
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:15,620
I think it's pressurized.

234
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:18,460
I think they fill up a tub and that's how they get it.

235
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:20,780
Like the pizza's made in and out so fast.

236
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,620
It's a real thin crust.

237
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,100
And then they don't use pizza cutters.

238
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,820
They just use like these.

239
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:26,700
I don't know what they are.

240
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:29,100
Gardening, gardening shears.

241
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,180
They slice it so quick.

242
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:33,700
Wow. I got to see a video of this.

243
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:36,340
It's great. Is this ever like an unwrapped with Mark Summers or anything?

244
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:37,500
I'm sure it is.

245
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,180
It must. It's beloved there.

246
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:40,660
It's like a type of pizza that never spread.

247
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:43,420
It looks like New York pizza, but yeah, it kind of tastes like a saltine.

248
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:45,180
It's almost like every read St.

249
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:46,700
Louis style pizza.

250
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:47,580
I don't think so.

251
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:48,820
I know it's St.

252
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:52,740
Louis is super thin and then like chopped up into squares.

253
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:55,140
Oh, I don't think it's very square.

254
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:56,900
But you know what's good in St.

255
00:11:56,900 --> 00:12:01,820
Louis is like at a pizza place, the appetizer will be deep fried ravioli.

256
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:03,540
Oh, wow. Breaded and fried.

257
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:04,860
It's great. Oh, geez.

258
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:08,180
I'm a Chicago guy, so I like the thickest crust.

259
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:12,380
Now, I feel like a lot of Chicago guys say not the deep dish.

260
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:14,180
I like tavern style, but I've never had.

261
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:15,820
I don't know what I don't even know what that is.

262
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:17,460
It's like the thin crust.

263
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:19,220
Yeah. Of Chicago.

264
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:22,540
You don't know what it is. Maybe my also not that smarter, like worldly.

265
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:25,140
Yeah, you got to be intellectual to know.

266
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:26,100
Yeah.

267
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:29,260
You're still mainly going to McDonald's and the.

268
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:30,300
Yeah, yeah.

269
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,420
So I'm eating Pizza Hut in Chicago.

270
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:35,300
That's what I'm talking about.

271
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:40,060
Then this begs the question, did either of you guys ever fantasize

272
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:42,260
about getting under that sauce hose?

273
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:45,060
I did. Man, I still fantasize about that.

274
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:47,620
I wish my backyard I could water it down with that sauce hose.

275
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:50,980
I had mangoes.

276
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:53,300
I had it in December. I had a slice in December.

277
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,260
No, we did.

278
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:56,420
Yeah. Sauce hose still going strong.

279
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:59,420
And can you ask just like for like one squirt in your mouth?

280
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:03,620
I think the other thing, I think there's a foot pedal involved.

281
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:05,060
I think that's how you activate this.

282
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:06,460
Oh, you're right.

283
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:10,100
Yes. He stepped on like a like a metal pedal.

284
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,500
Yeah. Wow.

285
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,900
Like a rock guitarist. Yeah.

286
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:16,380
Oh, he's working that thing like Steve Vi.

287
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:19,700
It's very fun to be there off season, like in the winter.

288
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:22,500
My first Wildwood trip, everything was closed.

289
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,580
It was like March.

290
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:27,140
And there was a Greek restaurant called Quality Restaurant

291
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,220
that we went to for every meal.

292
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:29,740
And we loved it.

293
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:33,420
But it's really fun to be in like a summer town when it's like snowy.

294
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:34,980
Yeah, they do a lot.

295
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:38,260
A lot of the towns like really kind of go all out for Christmas

296
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:40,580
or like do a big block party in November.

297
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:43,340
Like that's cool. All sorts of innovative.

298
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:46,620
All sorts of tricks to drum up business in the off season. Yeah.

299
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:50,500
Tim, can I ask a question as a child or even an adult?

300
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:53,180
Did you like the food scrapple?

301
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:54,540
I just had my first scrap.

302
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:57,140
Oh, first really? Oh, this is huge.

303
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:57,860
Oh, this is good time.

304
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:00,300
This is an East Coast food that Jason had growing up.

305
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,860
We were sort of I was not aware of it at all.

306
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:05,860
Jason brought it up when you growing up in Pennsylvania.

307
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:09,340
Is it just like as common as, oh, would you like

308
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:11,940
bacon or sausage or scrap?

309
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:14,180
Yeah, I mean, I think that's the big difference.

310
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:17,060
One of the big differences is like the diners in Pennsylvania

311
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:18,980
and even more so in South Jersey.

312
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:22,700
It's like your breakfast meat options are like there's like seven of them.

313
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:27,500
We're like bacon, sausage, scrapple, pork roll,

314
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,980
which they call Taylor Ham in North Jersey. Right.

315
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:32,900
Hot Italian sausage, sweet Italian sausage.

316
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:35,340
It's a lot of options.

317
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:38,300
Anytime anyone's from the same area that Jason is, I ask two questions.

318
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:42,020
Scrapple and something about South Side Johnny and the Asbury Joops.

319
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:44,460
I know South Side Johnny and the Asbury Joops for sure.

320
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,020
I'm a huge fan. OK, good. Good.

321
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:50,700
I just want to make sure I heard him guest DJ on E Street Radio on Sirius XM.

322
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:52,540
I love it. I love it. He's still playing.

323
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:54,460
He doesn't come out and play shows here a lot.

324
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:56,500
No, I wanted to see South Side

325
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:00,060
Johnny played in Asbury Park on the 4th of July last year,

326
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:01,300
and I missed him by like two days.

327
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,260
I was very bummed.

328
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:04,180
What's the appeal of him not knowing the full word?

329
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:07,220
Is it like is it like a way to is it like the Morris Day

330
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:10,020
and the time to Prince like you get a little extra?

331
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:11,860
Yes. Of the vibe that you like.

332
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:14,060
Exactly what it is. All right.

333
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:15,660
Yeah, that makes me get it.

334
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:20,260
Because it's like I Bruce Springsteen is my mega all time favorite artist

335
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:21,060
by a mile.

336
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:23,980
So it's fun to watch to get more of that style of music,

337
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:26,180
but like take away the star quality.

338
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:28,500
Take away the superstar power.

339
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:31,100
And it's just like, yeah, a guy with a good soul voice

340
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:33,860
and like a tight band playing R&B music.

341
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:36,780
It's fun. And a couple of songs written by Bruce Little Stephen.

342
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:37,380
Yeah, just fun.

343
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:42,020
So you get the like the river, the river vibe of like old rock

344
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:46,260
and roll song that they like or did on that album, I should say.

345
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:50,620
I bet if you're at a South Side Johnny show,

346
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:54,980
like at the Stone Pony or something and it's encore time and Bruce doesn't join.

347
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:57,300
I bet everyone's like looking around the room like where are you?

348
00:15:58,420 --> 00:15:59,500
Here this happens every time.

349
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,180
He's really been popping up in like a lot of people's shows recently.

350
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:03,380
Yeah. McCartney last night.

351
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:04,980
Yeah, that's right.

352
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:06,260
And Coldplay in New Jersey.

353
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:07,900
And Coldplay, yes.

354
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:08,900
A couple of weeks ago.

355
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:11,580
You can't get through New Jersey without Bruce coming on stage.

356
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:15,420
He waited longer than the other old acts with COVID, I feel like.

357
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:17,780
He's going out next year, but he waited longer.

358
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:19,180
So I feel he's itching.

359
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:19,980
Yeah.

360
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:22,020
Give me them cameos.

361
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:22,540
Next year.

362
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:23,820
Hey, Lauren, can I play?

363
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:26,860
Many politicians I could play on the show this year.

364
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:33,220
I went to an SNL taping when Springsteen was the musical guest.

365
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:34,300
And I went out.

366
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:37,140
I like was like just hanging out in the writers room,

367
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:39,980
but then like snuck out right onto the floor to get real close when he's playing.

368
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:43,220
I was like, oh, man, it was during the River tour.

369
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:45,780
So he's playing like Meet Me in the City.

370
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:49,580
And I was up real close and I was like so starstruck.

371
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:51,260
And I turned to my left.

372
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:56,220
Lauren is standing with Paul McCartney, just both of the artists watching.

373
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:59,180
And McCartney wasn't even involved with the show that night.

374
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:00,020
He just hangs out.

375
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:00,940
She's just there.

376
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:01,700
Jeez.

377
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:05,740
Under the bleachers in Lauren's little like rosé area,

378
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:09,580
they'll be like John McEnroe or Alec Baldwin just like hanging out.

379
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:15,260
John Mecker, the omnipresence of John McEnroe in cool comedy.

380
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:17,020
And that is very strange to me.

381
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:18,140
I'm not sure why.

382
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:20,060
I feel like if you're just if you have enough money

383
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:23,060
and you're in midtown Manhattan on a Saturday night, you just get like.

384
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:26,300
And if you have enough white hair, you're not bored.

385
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:26,780
Don't go.

386
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:29,060
If you're close enough to the building, you get ushered in.

387
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:31,380
Yeah, like right this way.

388
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:34,700
Scrapple, got to say, a little disappointed me a little bit.

389
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:35,980
I built it up in my head.

390
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:38,660
I liked it. But I was going.

391
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:40,500
I had always heard about Danick's

392
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:45,140
roast pork sandwich with like the broccoli raw on it.

393
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:49,140
Yeah. So I went to a food hall to eat that sandwich.

394
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:50,820
And I loved it.

395
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:54,300
And then I saw that the little diner at this food

396
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:57,380
market was like a Pennsylvania Dutch diner.

397
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,140
So I popped in for some scrap.

398
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:01,540
And it was like the sizzled edges were really good.

399
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:04,180
But once you carve into it, it was I wasn't expecting.

400
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:05,540
I didn't know it was processed.

401
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:07,540
It's like, yeah, like mush.

402
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:11,260
Inside is kind of almost like a paté or like a smooth.

403
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:15,180
What I'm looking at and listeners, if you Google scratch something that I haven't

404
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:17,860
done, I don't think in all the time we've been talking about Scrapple,

405
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:20,900
the second image that I'm seeing, which is from something called Forager Chef.

406
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:22,860
This is like this is gray.

407
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:24,100
We are looking at it.

408
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,340
Very low. Yeah.

409
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:27,540
Is that is this like an outlier?

410
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:28,660
This is not a standard.

411
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:29,980
No, no, it's very great.

412
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:31,380
Well, usually the whole thing is gray.

413
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:35,780
And then when you cook it in a pan, it gets kind of brown and crispy.

414
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:38,820
OK, so it is a lot like paté,

415
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:42,580
but you take away the kind of fancy

416
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:45,340
livery taste that makes paté and delicacy.

417
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:47,900
And you're just kind of it's just sort of like a little salty and fatty.

418
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:51,020
Yeah, like a sausage filling or

419
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:56,980
just reading that it's a treat made with liver and buckwheat.

420
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:01,500
You sure you sure treat is in that sense of those words.

421
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:05,820
Well, kids in that area like love running through the buckwheat fields

422
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:08,740
and sucking on the buckwheat.

423
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:10,660
It's a treat. I put them dry.

424
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:13,740
Yeah, if I was from there, I would understand.

425
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:16,260
But I guess I guess I got some Chicago buckwheat.

426
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:17,700
Don't you worry. OK.

427
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,620
Chicago buckwheat's real thick.

428
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,580
Are you are you big into the Italian beef?

429
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:25,780
I like Italian beef. I don't know.

430
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:28,020
Big I mean, what am I big into food wise?

431
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:29,220
That's not a question.

432
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:30,780
I like food. I like food a lot.

433
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:31,300
I like it.

434
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,300
I eat it three times a day.

435
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:34,260
I eat it all of it.

436
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:35,020
The whole genre.

437
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:38,620
I like a poor like Portillo's is down in Boyana Park, which is from the Midwest,

438
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:40,540
which is a big like Italian beef place.

439
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:42,260
And there's one in Orange County.

440
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:43,980
There's one.

441
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:45,820
Yeah, there's one in a park.

442
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:46,740
Yeah.

443
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:48,140
And there's one in Moreno Valley.

444
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:50,420
I know I know where they are here,

445
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:53,180
but they're very they're everywhere in the Midwest where I'm from.

446
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:54,900
So, yeah, I get a beef.

447
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,860
I get a beef and cheddar like croissant.

448
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:59,020
Like it's just almost like a liquid.

449
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:00,940
It's so wet.

450
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:02,460
And it's really you could just drink it.

451
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:04,820
It's not even it's so good, though.

452
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:07,860
It's like the whole thing is soaked in beef is like wet.

453
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:11,180
The beef is like, well, you get wetness level.

454
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:12,460
This is not a joke.

455
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:13,860
You think you're wetness level.

456
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:17,060
How wet your beef is, how much gravy you want on it.

457
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:17,860
And I see.

458
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:20,060
Grab the tongs and dip it.

459
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:22,620
OK, there's a sitting in a steam table.

460
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:25,500
The standard amount of wetness is very wet.

461
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,580
You don't have to say anything and they'll just make it extremely wet.

462
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:31,660
But you could say I want it drier or if you don't want the thing I'm having,

463
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:35,620
you just have a regular beef on a roll and it won't be wet at all.

464
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:38,420
You can you can choose your wetness comfort level.

465
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:39,540
Why is wetness?

466
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:41,860
Why is wet meat the desire?

467
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:43,620
I think I don't understand that.

468
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:44,620
I got to go try it.

469
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:45,940
Dry meat. Come on.

470
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:47,220
I mean, that doesn't sound good either.

471
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:49,300
Yeah. It's going to hurt your mouth when you're eating.

472
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:53,700
I I was at the Portillo's one in Chicago recently.

473
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:56,300
It was delicious. I had like a hot dog with all the stuff.

474
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:58,820
Yeah. Sport peppers and pickle spirits and stuff.

475
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:01,020
And like a Polish sausage was great.

476
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:04,100
And then afterwards, Mike Mitchell told me like,

477
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:06,300
oh, you got to get the chocolate cake shake.

478
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:08,540
Oh, that's my man's favorite over here.

479
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:09,300
I was down there.

480
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:13,700
I went to the one in Wynna Park a few weeks ago because I was I was in Anaheim

481
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:16,340
and I was trying to wait out traffic

482
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:18,580
because I was saying like 90 minutes back to L.A.

483
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:22,740
And I got if you need the excuse, just get the cake.

484
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:25,900
The excuse. So I got a Chicago hot dog and I got a cake shake.

485
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:29,980
And I was sitting in my car eating it and I watched the suns.

486
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:34,100
The parking lot of a beautiful view of the sunset.

487
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:36,460
Could your last day on Earth in the Walmart,

488
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:42,020
in the Walmart parking lot, by the trampoline park in the Walmart.

489
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:44,940
So beautiful sunset.

490
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:46,620
And so I finished eating.

491
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:47,700
I checked my phone.

492
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:51,100
Drive back city. 40 minutes. So worked. Nice. Beautiful.

493
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:53,140
So did you have it, Tim?

494
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:56,140
I've never had the cake shake. OK. I've never gotten to it.

495
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:58,500
It is good. We all chunks in it.

496
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:00,500
They blend it all.

497
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,900
They blend a slice of cake into amazing.

498
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:05,540
Whole piece of cake in there. Yeah.

499
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:06,820
How wet is it?

500
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:08,540
It's very wet.

501
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:11,020
I mean, it's obviously there's some like hard particles in there,

502
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:12,060
some dry particles.

503
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:15,020
So it's less wet than a normal milkshake, but it's still pretty wet.

504
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:17,420
This is an episode, right?

505
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:21,140
Just going to me trying some of this wet beef and trying to kick.

506
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:22,980
Well, you already talked about two episodes ago.

507
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:24,980
We're going to make you eat things we like.

508
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:27,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Make Scott eat like us,

509
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:31,380
which is a lot of pretty pebbles, like too much food, like too much cooked food.

510
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:34,060
We need to get you some science food.

511
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:37,780
We need to get you some post World War two quality.

512
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:41,260
Yeah. Well, all the scientists who were working on weapons

513
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:44,580
and then switched to working on children's cereals and snack cakes.

514
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:46,260
What's the kind of 48 hours?

515
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:47,380
What have you eaten?

516
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:48,300
What's 48 hours?

517
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:52,260
Well, look, last night it's it's thrown because last night

518
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:53,780
I went to today's topic.

519
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:55,260
OK, all right.

520
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:59,780
I pushed the I pushed my eating comfort, I'd say a little further.

521
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:00,980
OK. And I usually would.

522
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:03,900
So funny because that place I call that would think of that

523
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:06,780
as such a safe comfort food type of a place.

524
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:08,860
It is. I mean, yeah, it totally is.

525
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:11,020
And it is very literally like Walt Disney.

526
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:14,060
Disney seems like he would be very scared of food.

527
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:15,700
Yes. Exactly.

528
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,260
Every day, I believe.

529
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:19,500
I can think of a male.

530
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,980
No. Oh, yeah.

531
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:22,860
Yeah. It was a different can of get parts.

532
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,820
Chill with a can of Dennis.

533
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:27,740
It's one of his favorite.

534
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,620
You can afford anything in the world.

535
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:31,340
You want to mix together two cans.

536
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:32,980
That fact, by the way, is not in his notes.

537
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:34,900
That's on his lock screen.

538
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:36,740
That's the wallpaper.

539
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:39,900
Just what he has ready to go in any moment.

540
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:42,740
I want to hear what you had, but just to contextualize,

541
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:46,700
Walt Disney's daughter was describing his kind of, you know,

542
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:48,820
middle of the road taste in food.

543
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:52,380
This is quoted in a KCET article.

544
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:55,380
Before he married mother, father.

545
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:57,140
Oh, my God.

546
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:59,180
Is this not me?

547
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:02,940
Before he married mother, father had eaten in hash houses

548
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:06,300
and lunch wagons for so many years in order to save money

549
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:09,060
that he developed a hash house lunch wagon appetite.

550
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:13,020
He liked fried potatoes, hamburgers, Western sandwiches,

551
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:17,420
hotcakes, can peas, hash stew and roast beef sandwiches.

552
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:21,140
Hash. I think like corned beef hash.

553
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:22,260
Yeah. Like, you know.

554
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:25,940
So this is these are the culinary makings of the most

555
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:29,900
significant creative person of the century.

556
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:30,860
American popular culture.

557
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:34,220
We're all being held back by not eating more hash.

558
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:35,460
Or hash. Yeah.

559
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:39,220
You do. I mean, I get the thing of like, oh, I grew up on simple food.

560
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:39,940
So that's what I like.

561
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:42,660
And almost every fancy chef always has that thing of like,

562
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:47,580
I went I went to culinary school and did some fine dining.

563
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:50,900
But then when I returned to my mother's cooking, that's when I could really

564
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:53,300
or whatever. But it is still funny that.

565
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:56,540
I feel like if I were Walt and I had all that money,

566
00:24:56,540 --> 00:25:00,340
how do you not want to just like at least I would just travel

567
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:03,020
the whole world eating until I found other stuff I liked, you know?

568
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:08,060
Well, and your ability to go like experience other cultures

569
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:13,380
like as he's traveling the world faster than most people are traveling the world.

570
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:17,940
Right. And yet he's just eaten big bricks of meat, essentially.

571
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:19,780
But it's what he likes. I don't know.

572
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:22,420
So are you in general your picky eater?

573
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:24,300
No, I don't think so. No, no, no.

574
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:28,300
I'm saying I just went like heavier, I would say, than usual.

575
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:31,340
I'll get into it. But just to fully dive in.

576
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:34,940
I mean, the big context here for people who are not in Los Angeles,

577
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:39,260
this is a restaurant in in Atwater Village called the Tamos Shantor.

578
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:40,900
And why are we talking about it?

579
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:44,500
Mainly because it was Walt Disney's favorite restaurant.

580
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:48,620
And I might go so far as to say maybe my favorite restaurant.

581
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:50,180
Oh, wow.

582
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:52,980
Right. Is it up there for OK for all of you?

583
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:56,300
Well, Tim, especially since you I I love it so much.

584
00:25:56,300 --> 00:26:00,060
I'm like a big steakhouse person in general. Yeah.

585
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:04,300
So I'm like geared towards the genre.

586
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:06,740
And there's like so many good ones in Southern California.

587
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:10,780
And but Tamos Shantor specifically is like, yeah, it's

588
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:15,460
it's a jolly place like the Mary, especially in L.A.

589
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:17,260
There's not you don't really know what to do around the holiday.

590
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:18,340
I'm from New York.

591
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:20,940
And then I moved to L.A. I was like, where should I go?

592
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:22,540
If I want to like feel like it's Christmas?

593
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:26,340
And it's like the answer is the Tamos Shantor between Thanksgiving and Christmas.

594
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:31,140
There's carolers and it's it's packed with people and it's fun as fuck.

595
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:35,940
Decorated in such a lovely fashion, like such warm,

596
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:45,260
glowy, Dickensian style holiday flair on top of the base of if you've never been here.

597
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,540
It is like it's fantasy land.

598
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:50,900
It is completely a big cottage. Yeah. Yeah.

599
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:54,260
Yeah. It's it's extremely snow white in the seven drawers,

600
00:26:54,460 --> 00:27:00,300
especially feels like that newer that the since 1983 fantasy land of Disneyland.

601
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:03,940
Yeah. Just so like gentle storybook.

602
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:08,620
But then also it is Scottish themed.

603
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:12,020
It's almost more Scottish themed than fully Scottish food.

604
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:14,180
Right. There is Scottish food for sure.

605
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:17,820
They kind of change the appetizer menu a lot, but they used to have a

606
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:21,060
more palatable version of haggis

607
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:25,420
that was maybe like made with beef and it was kind of cooked as a little pastry.

608
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:27,740
And and there's there's some touches.

609
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:31,020
There's there's like Scotch rarebit and a few Scottish things there.

610
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:32,700
Yeah. Yeah.

611
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:36,100
I mean, it's thematic architecturally.

612
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:38,420
It's like a quaint little cottage. Yeah.

613
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:41,340
The that's very like other world.

614
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:45,140
It feels like centuries ago, old Europe.

615
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:49,500
It really like stands out still, even though like the

616
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:51,580
well, there's a me me's across the street.

617
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:54,500
So you get some of that storybook vibe over there.

618
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:58,500
We like we've been a bit of a more corporate version of Pam O'Shanter

619
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:02,140
in me me's in rapid succession more than one night.

620
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,140
Wow. Is that right?

621
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:04,620
More than once. Yeah, probably.

622
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:06,140
Mike doesn't remember he blacked out.

623
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:09,260
Who was that water nights back when Toys R Us was over there.

624
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:10,460
Are you kidding me?

625
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:15,380
We make it a three part for a short period of time would go to

626
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,860
Tamao Shantar every week.

627
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:21,020
There was like a couple months there where I was like, we're doing a thing.

628
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:23,220
We're going to have a thing. This is what we do every week.

629
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:25,260
And then the best feeling to have a thing.

630
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:28,020
It gets so much. It gets increasingly hard to have a thing.

631
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:29,380
So hard to have a thing.

632
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:31,380
I used to have a lot of things I don't.

633
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:33,260
I know. Where are things?

634
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:34,940
Oh, I would love a thing.

635
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:39,500
Yeah. Me me's is funny to me because it's it's got to be a chain.

636
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,060
I won't need to be in that one, but it's a chain.

637
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:42,860
It's a chain. Yeah. It's a dwindling chain.

638
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:44,260
They're disappearing slowly.

639
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:46,460
It's French, right? Yeah.

640
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:52,220
If you were to call it something like there's a crepes on the menu and stuff.

641
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:53,820
Right. It's a big menu, though.

642
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:55,020
So, yeah, it is.

643
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:56,860
Or is it more of a New Orleans eat?

644
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,900
And that's why it's kind of just a regular.

645
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:02,460
I'm trying to think of what a good French when I.

646
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:04,660
Yeah. When I first went there, I thought it would just be like, yeah, Marie

647
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:06,180
Callender's or something like that.

648
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:08,540
And then there's just there was more international flair.

649
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:09,860
Has a little cut to it.

650
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:12,180
It's a little it's like Epcot Marie calendar.

651
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:13,700
That's a good description. Yeah.

652
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:15,220
And those are all gone, too, right.

653
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:16,980
Or at least here they are mostly.

654
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:19,940
Yeah. There was that beautiful Marie Callender down on Wilshire.

655
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:25,180
The campuses were always very nice, very like, yeah, homey and and

656
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:28,500
lighting, like fixtures in there.

657
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:30,300
Yeah. That's all we want.

658
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:34,220
Really is just like lamps, nice chairs.

659
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:36,460
Yeah. It doesn't take much this like

660
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:40,260
this very traditional kind of restaurant.

661
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:41,100
You go to this.

662
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:42,500
You know, I don't know.

663
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:46,620
It's not the way now everything's sort of like, like flipped houses.

664
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:49,540
It's all everything looks like a property brother's house.

665
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:50,380
Yeah. Yeah.

666
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:51,780
It's boring.

667
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:56,620
The taffarization of these places, I will say, despite loving

668
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:59,020
John Taffer, love the man.

669
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:04,420
I know everything anybody he has on board, even the ones he won't share publicly.

670
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:09,260
But yeah, the idea that is like weird lighting, the booze bottles from underneath

671
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:14,020
and it all looks like standard, like less than a Taco Bell inside.

672
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,900
Yeah. Like, I don't think so.

673
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:16,900
You know what's happening now?

674
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:21,100
We've been talking about on the sloppy boys podcast is I'm always trying to figure out like,

675
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:22,820
what's the drink of the summer?

676
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:24,020
What are drink trends or whatever?

677
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:27,060
And I read a bunch of articles about restaurant wise.

678
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:28,900
There's a thing in New York

679
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:32,100
speaking of the the Meme's and the Marie Callender's and stuff.

680
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:35,220
Have you had a dirty, dirty Shirley?

681
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:38,380
It's like a Shirley. Oh, oh, this is right up my alley.

682
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:40,020
Oh, yeah, you into it.

683
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:43,660
Because I'm a big I like a good drink that has like a lot of colors in it.

684
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:45,620
And as a child, I was obsessed with the Shirley Temple.

685
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:47,940
So a couple of years ago when I realized you could do that.

686
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:49,100
Yeah, it was amazing.

687
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:51,580
You're allowed. I didn't know.

688
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:54,180
You can defile this little girl's name.

689
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:56,620
I turned that's not I wasn't exciting to me.

690
00:30:57,100 --> 00:31:01,340
The drink itself with a little bit of a buzz is, you know, I turned 33 and realized,

691
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:03,180
wow, we could have a party here.

692
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:05,660
But you still kept it a little bit of a buzz.

693
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:07,740
Yeah. Well, you don't want to have too much.

694
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,380
You don't have too much.

695
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:11,460
It's a lot of grenadine in there.

696
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:14,620
Well, you know, it's having a huge moment right now in New York.

697
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:16,660
And like the New York Times wrote an article that was like,

698
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:18,660
is this the drink of the summer? OK.

699
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:23,740
And somebody's theory about it was that post-COVID, like a lot of people,

700
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:26,500
people in their 20s left the cities during COVID.

701
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:29,420
And now they're back with some of the suburban

702
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:35,020
it's almost like an ironic love of the suburbs has come back to cities with them.

703
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:38,020
So there's this new trend in restaurants being like,

704
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:42,660
you're in Brooklyn at a hip hip restaurant, but there's a Bloomin' Onion on the menu.

705
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:49,020
And there's kind of like the lamps like Tiffany, Tiffany, Tiffany, Tiffany.

706
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:51,980
Yeah. And kind of like the uncle most family feed bag,

707
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:55,300
like a bunch of crap on the walls and baskets of mozzarella sticks.

708
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:59,460
Coming is coming back with a little ironic wink to it.

709
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:02,660
OK, OK. A high price tag.

710
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:04,620
Yeah, yeah, that's great.

711
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:06,860
I mean, if you could, the only thing you want to change, really,

712
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:09,380
is like to get that food a little better, better.

713
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:11,260
Because we love the vibe of these places.

714
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:14,740
But if you actually go back, maybe food's not so quality.

715
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:19,860
I think something that I love about this restaurant is that it is a very

716
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:24,460
you can take your parents there and they love it,

717
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:29,180
but you can love it, too, because places like that can be a swing and a miss.

718
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:30,580
Yeah, it's a safe bet.

719
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:32,940
Oh, I bring I've always brought my parents there.

720
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:35,820
And then Lowry's primary in Beverly Hills is the same owners.

721
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:37,940
So they have the same primary.

722
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:40,020
I bring my parents to both of those places.

723
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:43,620
My father-in-law is Scottish.

724
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:46,340
He's from Glasgow and we brought him to Tamishanter.

725
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:49,180
And at first, he was sort of like, is this making fun of me?

726
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:50,820
I don't know about this.

727
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:51,900
And then he warmed up to it.

728
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:53,780
And now it's like every Father's Day.

729
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:58,820
It's a go to, in fact, one Father's Day in the booth, the next table,

730
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:01,220
Cameron Crowe.

731
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:02,220
Whoa. Wow.

732
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:03,780
With his two sons.

733
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:06,420
I think he's divorced and it was kind of having a sweet like

734
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:09,220
Father's Day thing with just the two boys.

735
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:11,460
And it was like two boys lost in their phones.

736
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:12,820
And he was like, what are you guys going to get?

737
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:14,380
I think I'm going to get prime rib.

738
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:16,460
It was a very cute dad moment.

739
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:19,340
How Jesus.

740
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:21,940
Yeah, it's a it's a very safe bet.

741
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:24,420
And then with the parents, it always works because you just go,

742
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:28,180
you know, Walt Disney here and they go, well, well, how about that?

743
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:30,220
You got something to talk about.

744
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:32,300
There's the legend strum through it.

745
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:36,700
I mean, OK, so like vibe wise, just to keep saying,

746
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:39,580
because like wonderful on the outside, really distinct architecture,

747
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:41,940
which, by the way, here's where's another thing about it.

748
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:45,900
Hundred years, hundred years this year, the oldest month

749
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:47,260
is really this one.

750
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:49,140
26, 1922.

751
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:50,180
What? Wow.

752
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:53,740
Shortly after this episode around the release of this episode.

753
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:58,940
Congratulations and continuously run the entire time.

754
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:03,020
Like it's it obviously changes because it's been a hundred years.

755
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:04,580
Look, people die. It's what happened.

756
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:06,380
But it hasn't like and it's shifted now.

757
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:07,540
It's under the ownership of Lowry's.

758
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:10,220
But Lowry's like completely like that.

759
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:15,220
I believe the current CEO of Lowry's is the great grandson of the founder.

760
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:17,020
Yeah. Of one of the founders of it.

761
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:19,140
So there's a real through line in ownership,

762
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:20,860
which I think is extremely rare.

763
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:25,140
Yeah, well, it's even more like there's so many connections

764
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:29,060
founded by Lawrence Frank, the Lowry in question.

765
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:30,140
I guess that was his name.

766
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:31,620
He's Lowry. I didn't feel that.

767
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:35,460
And then the other founder, Walter van de Kamp, the bread guy.

768
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:38,460
Yeah, they they they two of them together also founded

769
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:43,820
the end of camps, Holland Dutch Bakeries, which went bankrupt in 1990.

770
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:48,780
Then the brand was purchased by a group called Pinnacle Foods.

771
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:51,260
That owns Duncan Hines, Mrs.

772
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:54,940
Butterworths, Bird's Eye Hungry Man, Log Cabin Maple Syrup.

773
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:58,940
And Ralph's uses the van de Kamp name on their bread.

774
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:02,100
So the Pinnacle Foods factory, the only place you'd rather be

775
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:05,020
than sitting in a car drinking a cake shake. Sure.

776
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:09,300
I mean, look, I bought some van van de Kamp.

777
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:12,980
Half the price of or a wheat bread also tastes like garbage.

778
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:16,700
The most plain food you've ever had.

779
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:18,780
That's a puffy pillow.

780
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:20,820
Yeah, it has a little windmill on it, right?

781
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:25,300
As a little windmill and the bakery, I think, is still around this area.

782
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:28,820
And there was a they also owned coffee shops.

783
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:30,660
And I think it's in Arcadia.

784
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:33,220
There was it's it became a Denny's,

785
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:37,620
but it was very like 60s mod roof with a big windmill on top.

786
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:40,740
I don't know if it's gone now, but they were trying to save the windmill.

787
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:43,260
But I remember that jumping out at me before, like one of those

788
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:45,740
clearly old style architecture.

789
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:48,740
But what I was saying about the little like

790
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:53,940
little like old world village nature of it, this was just this was just

791
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:55,900
dirt roads at the time.

792
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:59,420
Now, of course, fully populated and a me meets across the street.

793
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:04,140
But it was essentially in not the middle of nowhere, but like not fully.

794
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:07,940
I don't know. It's its own odd little hut there.

795
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:11,220
Right. It must have been more of like a destination restaurant back then

796
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:13,100
when it wasn't really a neighborhood.

797
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:14,660
People are coming up from downtown or something.

798
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:18,020
I think so. There's letters on the wall you can look at of them

799
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:20,740
trying to drum up business with people working downtown.

800
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:22,420
And it's just a hop, skip and a jump.

801
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:25,380
If you take Glendale Boulevard, like predates the freeways.

802
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:27,740
Yeah. Yeah. So super old school.

803
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:30,700
I think the closest thing previously was Griffith Park,

804
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:33,700
because they used to sell box lunches for people

805
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:37,140
would then go picnic at Griffith Park. Yeah. Yeah.

806
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:40,900
And it's well and it ties into all that like old.

807
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:45,580
I feel like it's it's it's catering to studios around there

808
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:47,020
that used to be there.

809
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:49,740
So like, wait, I there's a list of like

810
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:54,900
silent movie stars who you would find around those parts.

811
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:56,500
Oh, yeah. Oh, there you go.

812
00:36:56,500 --> 00:37:00,380
Not uncommon to spot Mary Pickford, the Keystone Cops.

813
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:02,340
You'll be having lunch with the Keystone.

814
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:04,940
Wow. Oh, imagine the hijinks.

815
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:07,340
They get just to each other.

816
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:10,820
Tom Mix in his leather chaps.

817
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:14,260
Or fatty Arbuckle in his suit and tie.

818
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:15,460
Oh, my. You're dying.

819
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:16,500
You're dying in with fat.

820
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:19,780
And like so. So now when it's all of us,

821
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:22,940
when it's all the we're the new generation casters.

822
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:24,620
Yeah. The fatty Arbuckle.

823
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:26,860
We're the new fatties, the new Keystone.

824
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:31,460
That's what the birthday boys felt like.

825
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:33,660
I don't know how many Keystone cops there were.

826
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:36,460
Yeah. I wish they had.

827
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:38,820
Only six.

828
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:40,580
I've seen it.

829
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:44,300
The on Glendale Boulevard in Echo Park, the

830
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:48,980
public storage by Jack in the Box has a little plaque

831
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:52,980
that says Keystone Cops shorts were shot here because it was owned by.

832
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:54,380
It was Max Senate Studios.

833
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:58,180
There's still like a Max Senate Studio in in Los Feliz,

834
00:37:58,180 --> 00:38:00,860
but the public storage was like a whole big studio.

835
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:02,300
I think I think so. Yeah.

836
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:04,700
There's kind of weird shaped building.

837
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:06,860
Yeah. Behind some bars.

838
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:10,660
And it like down the street from middle school in that area.

839
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:13,500
And that's the Max Senate Studios building. And

840
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:16,580
the yeah.

841
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:22,740
So I mean, Walt, what is now Gelson's on on Hyperion was Disney.

842
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:26,860
The studios, studios, studios where they made Snow White,

843
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:29,020
where they made Snow White to Burbank after that.

844
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:31,820
So up and did they only make Snow White or was it a few more?

845
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:36,020
I think maybe of the maybe they were maybe some of Pinocchio or Fantasia.

846
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:37,820
Yeah, they made like a long nose.

847
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:38,700
Sure.

848
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:40,620
And they were like, yeah, animated the nose.

849
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:42,340
And then they said, we got to move.

850
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:43,580
That's all we got.

851
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:46,140
I think they would.

852
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:49,780
I even after the move to Burbank, which was like 1940,

853
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:51,860
he was still a regular at the Tamo Shantor.

854
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:55,780
And what was then with is now Walt Disney

855
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:59,020
Imagineering is also kind of a straight shot to the Tamo Shantor.

856
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:02,180
Oh, cool. Because I knew.

857
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:05,140
Yeah, I think the Tamo Shantor, like the architecture is just based on being

858
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:07,140
like a Scottish farmhouse or something.

859
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:11,260
But there's rumors that it's like, oh, the early sketches for Snow White's

860
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:13,340
cottage were like based on this.

861
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:18,420
And then nearby, there's those like Snow White cottages.

862
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:21,140
Yeah. Right around the corner from the old studio.

863
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:23,060
You still live in East LA.

864
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:26,060
Yeah, at least I don't know if it was one of them because the actual

865
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:29,780
there's like eight of it, but it was it was there in that style.

866
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:32,180
Like it was definitely right there. Yeah.

867
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:35,260
I looked it up and it was like

868
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:38,660
those weren't built by Disney, but those were a lot of the people

869
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:40,660
that worked like animators that

870
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:46,260
worked at at the studio that's now Gelson's did live in those cottages

871
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:50,740
as like worker apartments and stuff like the idea that he wanted his little

872
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:54,340
his little minions to live in little cottages like George.

873
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:57,580
Yes. It's such a funny little heavy little man.

874
00:39:57,780 --> 00:40:01,540
Oh, Eva Anderson was telling me, you know,

875
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:03,700
Walt had like the nine old men.

876
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:09,100
Yes. The main treasure, the great animators who made made the Golden Age happen.

877
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:12,020
Eva goes to a lot of estate sales.

878
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:18,300
And she went to one of like the house of the state of the one of the nine old men

879
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:20,020
after he passed away. Really? Wow.

880
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:24,660
And he had a whole Playboy room, every Playboy magazine ever, ever.

881
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:31,500
Like in in order, like all around the room in the date that they. Wow.

882
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:33,900
Came out. Geez.

883
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:36,180
Did he have like like other memorabilia?

884
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:37,420
I guess he probably did.

885
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:40,540
He had just only the Playboys and no other belongings.

886
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:45,300
He didn't know furniture had no need for the no food.

887
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:47,500
I mean, he kept on this sperm.

888
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:52,740
You know, he was like Steve Jobs cutting his wardrobe down to just a black turtleneck.

889
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:56,540
This guy cut all his entertainment down to just Playboys.

890
00:40:56,540 --> 00:41:01,180
Yeah. He just wanted to read like Gourvedal stories and look at naked ladies.

891
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:04,700
I do love like an old guy with a white mustache and a cardigan.

892
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:08,860
Like, and you know, Playboy is kind of wholesome, so it makes sense for like

893
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:12,180
an animator to be looking at a soft core magazine

894
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:15,300
well into the like eighties or whatever, nineties.

895
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:17,460
It's just to study the human form.

896
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:20,940
It's my job. That's what I have to do to keep up on the trends.

897
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:26,740
Speaking of the speaking of of the nine old men, this is so among the Disney

898
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:31,060
touches that you will find when you go in there, the big ones are in the lobby.

899
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:36,780
And there is a very loving drawing of Lawrence Frank, the owner

900
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:39,180
or the founder.

901
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:42,620
And this is done by John Hensch, who's one of the one of the nine old men

902
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:46,020
and one of the great like Disney Imagineering figures as well.

903
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:50,780
This is from 58 and it is Lawrence Frank,

904
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:55,300
this guy we don't know otherwise dressed in traditional Scottish garb.

905
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:59,340
And the characters, I don't think the characters look at Walt this way.

906
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:01,220
They are in love with this man.

907
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:06,740
It's Mickey, Minnie, Donald Goofy, all just with the most admiration

908
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:07,740
you could ever have.

909
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:12,700
And then Tinkerbell is blessing him, giving him a little touch of magic.

910
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:17,700
I mean, this is like, has there ever been a more loving piece of art?

911
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:20,460
Thank you for the Lowry's family of restaurants.

912
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:23,780
Thank you for the seasoned assault.

913
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:28,220
The the other picture next to it, also very loving.

914
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:31,580
And this was from Walt Disney Studios

915
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:35,660
a few decades later,

916
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:38,020
I think for 75th birthday.

917
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:39,940
I got this too. Yes.

918
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:42,700
These are the so these are the owners at the time further down

919
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:44,660
the Frank family line.

920
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:50,060
And it's so it's the the owners at the time also in traditional Scottish garb.

921
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:53,380
And they are handing a big platter of beef

922
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:57,500
to an awaiting table of six very hungry Mickey's.

923
00:42:57,500 --> 00:43:01,980
Yes. A full multiverse of Mickey's from every era.

924
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:05,500
So there's some I mean, it's nice to see the harmony here

925
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:08,540
where the ones with the ones that have pupils

926
00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:11,060
are sitting with the ones that are just pupils,

927
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:14,620
which are sitting with the ones with like wedges taken out of their eyes.

928
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:17,860
They can all the Mickey's find a way to get they all agree on

929
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:20,540
big plates of very rare beef.

930
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:23,100
It's funny those looking at those Mickey's for years.

931
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:25,500
I always think about how weird is that Mickey?

932
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:28,860
It's not like just the drawing updated, but they changed the character

933
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:31,740
where he was like a little stinker originally.

934
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:33,740
Yeah, the Bugs Bunny and he was getting into.

935
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:37,420
Yeah. And then they kind of decided like then he was just like,

936
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:38,780
I'm a sweet guy.

937
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:41,740
You know, like it was like if he's the flagship character,

938
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:44,460
he has to just be perfect kind of.

939
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:47,100
Yeah. Lost his Bart Simpson edge.

940
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:48,460
They gave it like to Donald.

941
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:49,940
They gave some of that to Donald.

942
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:53,300
So they like separated Mickey's personality out and left him with nothing.

943
00:43:53,820 --> 00:43:54,740
Because what does he really?

944
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:57,260
It's like then even like Pluto's having the fun and Mickey's like,

945
00:43:57,260 --> 00:43:57,980
what's going on?

946
00:43:57,980 --> 00:44:00,540
He's they've they've made him in the new cartoons.

947
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:03,620
They've given him like now he's like insanely neurotic,

948
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:07,020
like he's really stressed out all the time.

949
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:09,700
And it is funny. The new the new shorts are really funny.

950
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:10,340
Yeah, he's back.

951
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:12,540
Is this like a Disney XD or where am I?

952
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:14,660
It's not Disney Plus, probably on Disney Channel.

953
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:16,580
Yeah, but they're really funny.

954
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:18,940
And he's like he's really out of his mind.

955
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:21,700
But in a different way, he's not he's not as much a stinker

956
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:22,980
and he's much more stressed.

957
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:26,100
He's just the little triangles out of the eyes almost indicate.

958
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:30,860
Does it is he like a high or super medicated or medicated?

959
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:33,060
Indicate like like, yeah, something might have been up with him.

960
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:35,020
It's like a Judy Garland situation.

961
00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:37,020
Yeah, back then, even like

962
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:38,740
he kept him pulled up for money.

963
00:44:38,740 --> 00:44:41,620
They kept made him work all in such a daze.

964
00:44:42,020 --> 00:44:45,460
All over the counter medicine back then just had a little bit of speed in it,

965
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:47,460
no matter what you were taking.

966
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:48,900
Yeah, they didn't tune down.

967
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:52,900
Yeah, even in Toontown, they should update that with our favorite Polo shirt.

968
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:57,620
Like early 90s, late 80s Mickey, they should add characters to that drawing.

969
00:44:57,660 --> 00:45:00,140
Yeah, this gentle subverting draw over the work.

970
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:01,660
Yeah, the famous drawing.

971
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:03,140
What's your favorite polo shirt?

972
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:06,340
The Mickey when he's wearing like kind of just like a yellow polo

973
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:08,660
and kind of like blue slacks like that.

974
00:45:08,660 --> 00:45:09,940
That's a rolled up sleeve.

975
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:13,700
Yeah, yeah, that's like 80s, 90s lewd, like lewd, quite lewd.

976
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:17,700
Mickey, yeah, he like stumbling to his car.

977
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:19,900
Wolf of Wall Street is

978
00:45:20,140 --> 00:45:22,580
losing his limbs.

979
00:45:24,740 --> 00:45:27,500
Well, I mean, mainly I look at this and go, OK, so they gave him some.

980
00:45:27,620 --> 00:45:30,980
Disney gave him something in the 50s and they did something for the 75th.

981
00:45:30,980 --> 00:45:34,060
Where where's Disney at? They forgot Tam.

982
00:45:34,220 --> 00:45:36,420
They aren't giving him any presence these days.

983
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:39,300
Yeah, well, Chaypek probably it's out.

984
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:41,460
He cut it. Yeah, they were working on it.

985
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:42,820
He doesn't want to go there.

986
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:44,860
He's trying to put it out. I heard a dollar piece of art.

987
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:45,980
I heard he's trying to put it.

988
00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:48,340
He's trying to put him on a business, I heard.

989
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:53,820
To build a new building, a mini park on top of or a luxury hotel.

990
00:45:53,860 --> 00:45:55,900
Yeah, yeah. Hotel with four rooms.

991
00:45:55,900 --> 00:45:58,420
Yeah, yeah. So long, Tam.

992
00:45:58,420 --> 00:46:00,900
A number of years ago, they were they did run

993
00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:03,860
for the fan club for D23.

994
00:46:04,180 --> 00:46:07,660
You could schedule like a day long tour

995
00:46:07,660 --> 00:46:10,180
where you would tour the lot and some of the archives.

996
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:13,980
And then the day would end with a three course meal at the Tam O'Shanter.

997
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:16,820
Wow. Wow. Very nice.

998
00:46:16,820 --> 00:46:20,460
Which, by the way, let's maybe we should get into this aspect of it, too.

999
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:25,140
The very famous thing about it, which is that not only a place

1000
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:29,220
that Walt Disney liked to go, but where he had his special table

1001
00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:34,580
as referred to in the top of the show, Table 31, that's Walt's table.

1002
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:37,460
There is a plaque on the table

1003
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:40,500
commemorating that he and the Imagineers it was.

1004
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:42,780
I don't know if it elaborates.

1005
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:44,580
This is a place they went to. Right.

1006
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:48,220
The earliest language in parentheses. They've been here

1007
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:52,740
more more than once, can't promise more than three times.

1008
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:56,500
It's sort of it is the table that you it's not like the best table in the house,

1009
00:46:56,500 --> 00:47:00,060
but it is the table of a regular where it's sort of nestled in a corner

1010
00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:02,540
by the fireplace. You're kind of facing out.

1011
00:47:02,540 --> 00:47:04,900
I feel like it's maybe a booth on one side and chairs on the other

1012
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:07,220
or something like that, where I think that's right against the wall.

1013
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:11,420
It's a good place to like eat by yourself almost or have a meeting.

1014
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:15,900
And yeah, I always feel like when you're there, you see people.

1015
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:17,980
There's always someone sitting at that table

1016
00:47:17,980 --> 00:47:20,540
and the people walking past whisper is like, that's Walt's table.

1017
00:47:21,020 --> 00:47:23,060
Yes. And I always do it.

1018
00:47:23,060 --> 00:47:24,980
Yeah, of course you have to.

1019
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:28,460
When I went there yesterday, I was poking around.

1020
00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:29,420
I was taking pictures.

1021
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:31,340
I was seeing if there was anything scratched in the table

1022
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:33,540
that would read as a photograph.

1023
00:47:33,540 --> 00:47:36,740
And as I was being that guy, there was nobody there at them.

1024
00:47:36,740 --> 00:47:39,460
I wasn't like pushing people's plates out of the way.

1025
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:41,380
I shoved them off the table.

1026
00:47:41,380 --> 00:47:45,460
But somebody at a table right next to it, then like,

1027
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:49,580
like it was a family dinner and there was a mom who like.

1028
00:47:49,940 --> 00:47:52,180
So are you an Imagineer or do you?

1029
00:47:52,460 --> 00:47:54,300
I know I just like this stuff. I do a podcast.

1030
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:56,220
Oh, OK, great. What's your favorite part?

1031
00:47:56,220 --> 00:47:59,340
So I got I suddenly started this conversation about theme parks

1032
00:47:59,540 --> 00:48:01,740
just by poking around there.

1033
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:04,860
And somebody at the table was an Imagineer.

1034
00:48:04,940 --> 00:48:09,020
Well, I don't want to say any more that I or at least like

1035
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:11,340
contractors working there at the time.

1036
00:48:11,340 --> 00:48:14,540
But yeah, I hey, I got a little bit of that Tinkerbell.

1037
00:48:15,940 --> 00:48:20,260
Somebody who was shook off pixie dust from the dream factory that day.

1038
00:48:20,860 --> 00:48:24,100
Wow. OK, did they draw you like a sketch of you in the tam or?

1039
00:48:24,740 --> 00:48:26,580
He took a picture of me. That's plenty.

1040
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:28,780
OK, I guess. Yeah, God, I missed out.

1041
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:32,060
I should have. I should do more work for free. Yeah. Yeah.

1042
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:36,900
I only saw this on one blog, but I kind of believe it.

1043
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:40,740
Somewhat they mentioned while that is referred to,

1044
00:48:40,860 --> 00:48:43,700
you know, it's got the plaque on it and they say, oh, Disney's table

1045
00:48:44,780 --> 00:48:47,220
that he preferred to sit at the bar.

1046
00:48:47,580 --> 00:48:51,140
He would sit at the bar with Lawrence like he would, you know,

1047
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:53,980
she was a fat with the owner. Yeah.

1048
00:48:53,980 --> 00:48:57,340
So and I believe that I also prefer the bar.

1049
00:48:57,900 --> 00:49:02,580
I mean, you know, the bar is great because you can just walk in and sit down.

1050
00:49:02,580 --> 00:49:05,460
And a lot of times it's not terribly busy.

1051
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:07,500
And you can order the full menu.

1052
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:10,860
And even if you are getting like the prime rib can come out real fast

1053
00:49:10,860 --> 00:49:13,300
because it's already cooked and they're just like scooping potatoes.

1054
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:15,820
And yeah, so it's like I've like popped in there.

1055
00:49:16,220 --> 00:49:20,020
In fact, I was there like for like a bar night where like friend Mike Hanford

1056
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:22,020
was in town and he was like, hey, come meet up at the bar.

1057
00:49:22,020 --> 00:49:23,660
And it was like friends hanging around a bar.

1058
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:25,340
And I got a little hungry.

1059
00:49:25,340 --> 00:49:27,420
And it was like late later on in the night.

1060
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:30,460
And I just like sat there and was like, oh, I have a fucking tamarish

1061
00:49:30,460 --> 00:49:34,940
answer cut. And I just sat there and ate like a sixty dollar dinner.

1062
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:38,060
Well, like my friends were behind me talking and it was like amazing

1063
00:49:38,060 --> 00:49:39,540
to just how fast it came out.

1064
00:49:39,540 --> 00:49:42,220
And it was treated like it's bar food. And it's like amazing.

1065
00:49:42,220 --> 00:49:43,980
You can recall that. Yeah. You like hunched over.

1066
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:45,780
You have to turn your back to everybody.

1067
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:48,540
I did. But what better food to do it for?

1068
00:49:48,620 --> 00:49:50,620
But hey, we got to talk about next.

1069
00:49:50,620 --> 00:49:52,020
Worst fucking thing in the world.

1070
00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:54,660
Next morning. Test positive for COVID.

1071
00:49:55,420 --> 00:49:56,740
Text all my friends.

1072
00:49:56,740 --> 00:49:58,260
Was waiting for you to bring it up.

1073
00:49:58,260 --> 00:49:59,660
I didn't want to be the one to bring it up.

1074
00:49:59,660 --> 00:50:03,820
It was it was so shitty because it was like this was like last summer

1075
00:50:03,820 --> 00:50:08,540
when it was still, you know, like I felt so fucking scared

1076
00:50:08,540 --> 00:50:10,580
that I maybe had passed it along to other people.

1077
00:50:10,580 --> 00:50:12,220
That's so much worse than getting it.

1078
00:50:12,220 --> 00:50:15,220
It's like knowing that people with children maybe had got it from me.

1079
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:17,380
And then I thought you made it.

1080
00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:18,900
You did very quick rounds of it.

1081
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:21,020
You seem to get the get the news out quickly.

1082
00:50:21,020 --> 00:50:24,060
I had to get that. I mean, I tweeted like some people are like embarrassed,

1083
00:50:24,060 --> 00:50:27,380
but I tweeted I have covid just so that I could sleep soundly

1084
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:31,260
because I felt so bad because I took my mask off to eat my prime rib

1085
00:50:31,420 --> 00:50:33,740
and then was talking to people.

1086
00:50:34,140 --> 00:50:36,540
But it did make me feel better, though, because I was like, wait, OK,

1087
00:50:36,540 --> 00:50:38,220
now where was I in relation to him that whole?

1088
00:50:38,220 --> 00:50:42,140
Well, he was he did have his back turned eating that prime rib for a lot of it.

1089
00:50:42,140 --> 00:50:44,060
So at the bartender.

1090
00:50:44,060 --> 00:50:46,940
Yeah. So they got the rib like absorbed.

1091
00:50:47,260 --> 00:50:48,860
That is all the yeah.

1092
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:50,660
Just me and the rib went down that night.

1093
00:50:50,660 --> 00:50:52,620
Yeah. It can get a little noisy.

1094
00:50:52,620 --> 00:50:56,460
So when they said for your side, do you want cream, spinach, cream, corn

1095
00:50:56,460 --> 00:50:57,740
or covid 19?

1096
00:50:57,740 --> 00:50:59,980
I was like, yeah, the last one.

1097
00:50:59,980 --> 00:51:00,940
Whatever it is.

1098
00:51:00,940 --> 00:51:02,940
I love my please.

1099
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:06,620
I also recall I think I had the thought because I was it was

1100
00:51:06,620 --> 00:51:09,100
there weren't a lot of indoor things going on at the time.

1101
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:12,580
And I remember having the thought like, just calm down.

1102
00:51:12,580 --> 00:51:13,900
Look, maybe somebody in there will have it.

1103
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:16,700
But it's not going to be like the you walk in and the first person

1104
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:18,180
that you talk to has it.

1105
00:51:18,180 --> 00:51:20,180
And then the next morning when you say I was like that,

1106
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:22,260
he was the very first person.

1107
00:51:22,260 --> 00:51:25,740
And I also and I fucking felt like shit because I deserved it

1108
00:51:25,740 --> 00:51:29,860
because it was this was August of last year.

1109
00:51:29,860 --> 00:51:33,020
So it was like we had just got I had just got my shots

1110
00:51:33,020 --> 00:51:34,420
and then the shots kicked in.

1111
00:51:34,420 --> 00:51:36,940
So I was kind of like, oh, I think I'm immune.

1112
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:40,380
So and it was like do it during the two weeks in L.A.

1113
00:51:40,380 --> 00:51:43,340
when things were sort of opening back up before Delta really hit.

1114
00:51:43,740 --> 00:51:46,180
And so I had had a weekend.

1115
00:51:46,180 --> 00:51:48,220
It was like, oh, Hanford's in town from New York.

1116
00:51:48,220 --> 00:51:51,220
So I had I rode the mechanical bull at the

1117
00:51:52,180 --> 00:51:55,060
South Ranch, the West Hollywood.

1118
00:51:55,060 --> 00:51:58,260
So I was out on the ranch and I went to a Dodger game

1119
00:51:58,260 --> 00:51:59,620
and then I came to the time.

1120
00:51:59,620 --> 00:52:01,300
I'm a shatter.

1121
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:04,020
So it was like it was like, yeah, I'm going to get.

1122
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:05,340
Oh, you got it from Saddle Ranch.

1123
00:52:05,340 --> 00:52:09,420
I got it. Yeah, I was wearing a mask there, but they saw.

1124
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:11,660
Yeah, it's sad. It's it's strong.

1125
00:52:11,660 --> 00:52:13,340
Yeah. They have good.

1126
00:52:13,340 --> 00:52:15,900
There's you got it from the vibe of Saddle Ranch. Yeah.

1127
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:18,380
Yeah. They handed out of the door.

1128
00:52:18,380 --> 00:52:19,900
But I had to ride, though.

1129
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:20,860
That's something we can.

1130
00:52:20,860 --> 00:52:24,140
Oh, that is a ride. I'm dying to do the saddle ranch.

1131
00:52:24,260 --> 00:52:25,700
You got well, you got to ride.

1132
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:26,900
The sloppy boys all wrote it.

1133
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:30,340
And you remember once it starts, you're like, oh, the whole point of this

1134
00:52:30,340 --> 00:52:32,460
thing is for there to be girls on it.

1135
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:34,700
And it's like, hey, it looks like she's having sex.

1136
00:52:34,940 --> 00:52:39,260
So the guy who's doing it is like making you kind of like hump slowly back and

1137
00:52:39,260 --> 00:52:41,780
forth. Controlling it. There's a dude controlling it.

1138
00:52:41,820 --> 00:52:43,380
Yeah, that's weird. It's very weird.

1139
00:52:43,380 --> 00:52:47,020
You get like you like look, you can lock eyes with him and he's like, hey, hey, hey.

1140
00:52:47,820 --> 00:52:49,300
Oh, I got to get off on it.

1141
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:50,580
So it's good.

1142
00:52:50,580 --> 00:52:52,580
So you guys went in public? Yeah.

1143
00:52:52,740 --> 00:52:54,540
You get voyeurism.

1144
00:52:54,580 --> 00:52:56,180
Yeah, it was fantastic.

1145
00:52:56,180 --> 00:52:59,420
We did it as a little competition and and Jeff one Hanford

1146
00:52:59,420 --> 00:53:01,420
kept getting tossed off that real fast.

1147
00:53:01,580 --> 00:53:02,740
OK, but it was fun.

1148
00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:04,100
Well, we have to do it then, I guess.

1149
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:04,980
Yeah, that's a ride.

1150
00:53:04,980 --> 00:53:07,020
They had the ball. They got rid of it at City Walk.

1151
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:09,100
They got rid of all saddle ranch, which is up at City Walk.

1152
00:53:09,100 --> 00:53:10,540
So what's there now?

1153
00:53:10,540 --> 00:53:12,780
Nothing. A lot of dirt lot.

1154
00:53:12,780 --> 00:53:14,700
I think they replaced it with nothing.

1155
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:16,540
It's just a it's just a field.

1156
00:53:16,540 --> 00:53:18,460
You needed some dirt up there.

1157
00:53:18,460 --> 00:53:19,420
And it used to be what?

1158
00:53:19,420 --> 00:53:20,780
What's the name of the guy?

1159
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:22,980
You know, the character wheel, the wagon.

1160
00:53:22,980 --> 00:53:25,500
Yeah, it's like a wagon.

1161
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:29,900
HP wagon wheels, something like I mean, that seemed like the best.

1162
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:30,660
Yeah, I can't remember.

1163
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:32,220
It was we love it at some point, too.

1164
00:53:32,220 --> 00:53:34,020
Whatever we love is one of our top 10 restaurants.

1165
00:53:34,020 --> 00:53:34,860
We can't think of what it is.

1166
00:53:34,860 --> 00:53:35,660
Well, let me see.

1167
00:53:35,660 --> 00:53:37,460
Here's what I remember about that space.

1168
00:53:37,460 --> 00:53:41,340
And then the saddle ranch still had it is that it was one of those

1169
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:46,460
restaurants that is like a I said the word campus about recounters.

1170
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:49,780
And I think I mean it that I love the restaurant where you keep bumping

1171
00:53:49,820 --> 00:53:53,660
into room after room after room and the rooms are all a little different

1172
00:53:53,660 --> 00:53:56,500
than each other and you go like and this is here, too.

1173
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:59,340
And there's a big like there's a wedding reception in one.

1174
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:01,580
But then just a bunch of people eating in one.

1175
00:54:01,580 --> 00:54:05,020
And it's all it feels like a little adventure as you bump around.

1176
00:54:05,020 --> 00:54:08,300
And I think that's something that Tamar Chancher has that restaurants

1177
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:12,020
have increasingly led just as like like new restaurant

1178
00:54:12,020 --> 00:54:16,460
physical footprints are never going to be as big as that place that opened in the 20s.

1179
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:18,020
Yes. If John Taffer was walking through,

1180
00:54:18,180 --> 00:54:20,740
why is this room different than the other room?

1181
00:54:21,140 --> 00:54:23,100
Like it's like it's people like that.

1182
00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:25,700
And there's totally different vibes. Yeah. Room to room.

1183
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:28,100
That's like quiet, like old couples having dinner.

1184
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:31,620
And my first time ever there, which is probably why it charmed me so much,

1185
00:54:31,780 --> 00:54:35,380
just happened to be I sat in the bar and it was a Burns night,

1186
00:54:35,380 --> 00:54:38,340
like a Burns dinner, which is like an annual thing.

1187
00:54:38,380 --> 00:54:40,500
That's the poet who it's named.

1188
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:44,740
Yeah, the poet that wrote the the the Tamo Chantre poem.

1189
00:54:44,740 --> 00:54:47,780
But he also wrote like the lyrics for old Lang's and all kinds of stuff.

1190
00:54:48,180 --> 00:54:51,260
And he's like the poet laureate of Scotland.

1191
00:54:51,780 --> 00:54:55,140
There's a night every year in January in pubs where people like

1192
00:54:55,940 --> 00:54:58,980
get together and recite his poetry and get really drunk.

1193
00:54:59,260 --> 00:55:01,540
And there's a lot of like interactive stuff you do.

1194
00:55:01,540 --> 00:55:06,660
So I was in the bar and it was just like all these like drunk old people get.

1195
00:55:06,660 --> 00:55:09,420
It was so charming because it was like it was the actual people.

1196
00:55:09,420 --> 00:55:11,020
It was their real culture.

1197
00:55:11,020 --> 00:55:13,540
It wasn't a bunch of me's kind of like horning in on it.

1198
00:55:13,780 --> 00:55:17,580
But they would like stand like like hit like a beer

1199
00:55:17,580 --> 00:55:19,980
stein on a table to get people's attention and stand up and like say

1200
00:55:19,980 --> 00:55:21,700
a line of a poem and then everyone would drink to it.

1201
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:25,820
And there was like interactive sort of like call and response stuff going on.

1202
00:55:26,180 --> 00:55:28,020
And I was like, is it like this every night?

1203
00:55:28,020 --> 00:55:29,500
This is fucking cool.

1204
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:31,900
And it was one night a year.

1205
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:38,780
I I ended up there once where like an Irish, like folk rock band was like,

1206
00:55:38,780 --> 00:55:40,300
all right, thank you for coming.

1207
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:43,260
We're going to record our EP right now.

1208
00:55:43,780 --> 00:55:44,980
Whoa, OK.

1209
00:55:44,980 --> 00:55:46,380
A lot of pressure for you.

1210
00:55:46,380 --> 00:55:48,380
We're on and I am there eating.

1211
00:55:49,100 --> 00:55:54,220
I think I was doing a bar crawl throughout what a lot of dive bars.

1212
00:55:54,220 --> 00:55:56,700
There's a lot of quaint bars in that area.

1213
00:55:56,700 --> 00:56:02,980
And I think I ordered an Irish coffee and then the table side hot fudge

1214
00:56:02,980 --> 00:56:05,260
Sunday and a TMO.

1215
00:56:05,260 --> 00:56:06,260
Another classic.

1216
00:56:06,260 --> 00:56:10,900
If you listen closely to that EP, you can hear the CC McGill.

1217
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:11,700
What is it?

1218
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:13,260
Then you can keep hearing more.

1219
00:56:13,780 --> 00:56:14,460
More.

1220
00:56:14,460 --> 00:56:14,980
More.

1221
00:56:14,980 --> 00:56:17,220
I'm going to tell you when I tell you.

1222
00:56:17,220 --> 00:56:21,020
Oh, you don't need that many nuts or fudge.

1223
00:56:21,540 --> 00:56:23,540
You're not getting a tip.

1224
00:56:24,420 --> 00:56:25,140
You know, it's a fun thing.

1225
00:56:25,140 --> 00:56:28,820
They might not do anymore is in the bars that the sandwich counter is that

1226
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:30,020
did that go that way?

1227
00:56:30,020 --> 00:56:31,620
A COVID victim sandwich.

1228
00:56:31,620 --> 00:56:34,140
And a sandwich and a bar.

1229
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:35,340
Was that what's going on?

1230
00:56:35,340 --> 00:56:38,420
I started going all the good meats like carved onto a sandwich.

1231
00:56:38,420 --> 00:56:42,100
And then you walk over to a funny little counter that had like

1232
00:56:42,580 --> 00:56:46,660
this like peanut coleslaw and took a really kind of gross usually.

1233
00:56:47,460 --> 00:56:48,140
I like that.

1234
00:56:48,140 --> 00:56:50,940
Peter Coleslaw, I guess I don't mind if it's gone bad.

1235
00:56:50,980 --> 00:56:53,460
You can get all the same stuff now, but it's back in the kitchen.

1236
00:56:53,460 --> 00:56:53,740
Right.

1237
00:56:53,740 --> 00:56:55,980
Maybe better, maybe more sanitary back there.

1238
00:56:56,100 --> 00:56:59,540
But you get dollops of that horseradish, which is crazy.

1239
00:56:59,660 --> 00:57:00,820
That packs a punch.

1240
00:57:00,820 --> 00:57:02,420
Yeah, that's like made.

1241
00:57:02,420 --> 00:57:02,860
Wow.

1242
00:57:02,860 --> 00:57:04,380
Well, it's made horseradish.

1243
00:57:04,380 --> 00:57:04,940
Damn.

1244
00:57:05,060 --> 00:57:06,500
Really, real spicy.

1245
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:10,860
Like you feel like you snorted it, even if you just took a tiny bite.

1246
00:57:10,860 --> 00:57:13,340
They give you the spicy stuff and then they give you the creamy stuff and they

1247
00:57:13,340 --> 00:57:16,620
say, hey, you can customize by mixing them together to your appropriate level.

1248
00:57:16,660 --> 00:57:17,460
Wow.

1249
00:57:17,460 --> 00:57:19,820
Like Walt's chili cans.

1250
00:57:19,820 --> 00:57:20,140
Right.

1251
00:57:20,140 --> 00:57:21,020
Which companies?

1252
00:57:21,260 --> 00:57:21,660
What's that?

1253
00:57:21,740 --> 00:57:22,620
What were the chili companies?

1254
00:57:22,620 --> 00:57:24,140
Geb Hards and Denison's.

1255
00:57:24,180 --> 00:57:24,620
Got it.

1256
00:57:25,260 --> 00:57:26,660
I don't know if Geb Hards is still in business.

1257
00:57:26,660 --> 00:57:29,700
I think I had Denison's like in the Boy Scouts.

1258
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:31,180
I feel like I have a page of Denison's.

1259
00:57:31,460 --> 00:57:35,100
Do you know, do we know what Walt ordered here?

1260
00:57:35,100 --> 00:57:38,060
Because they don't have chili on the menu.

1261
00:57:38,100 --> 00:57:43,700
They have like old timey stuff like stew and or some, I mean, French onion soup and

1262
00:57:43,700 --> 00:57:43,980
stuff.

1263
00:57:44,180 --> 00:57:44,420
Yeah.

1264
00:57:44,420 --> 00:57:52,820
But like the cocktail, I've had the table 31 cocktail and it's like rye elderflower

1265
00:57:52,820 --> 00:57:55,780
liqueur and maybe like apple brandy or something like that.

1266
00:57:55,780 --> 00:57:56,900
It's got a strong apple.

1267
00:57:56,900 --> 00:57:59,100
I love that drink for whatever reason.

1268
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:00,020
Yeah.

1269
00:58:00,020 --> 00:58:06,180
It's in any like, I think that's all my favorite stuff is reddish whiskey drinks.

1270
00:58:06,180 --> 00:58:08,500
And that's a nice, that's a, that's a beautiful orange.

1271
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:11,300
That's a well balanced, like real crisp, nice drink.

1272
00:58:11,620 --> 00:58:17,020
I had it once and I loved it and I was like, wait, I feel like Walt, I was wondering if

1273
00:58:17,020 --> 00:58:21,140
he really drank and I was like, he seems like he would be like a tea totaler to me.

1274
00:58:21,140 --> 00:58:23,580
Like, and I was like, does Walt Disney drink?

1275
00:58:23,580 --> 00:58:31,540
And I looked it up and it's, and he did drink and his go-to drink was a, like a Scotch

1276
00:58:31,540 --> 00:58:32,260
Breeze.

1277
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:33,260
Scotch Mist.

1278
00:58:33,340 --> 00:58:34,060
Scotch Mist.

1279
00:58:34,140 --> 00:58:38,020
It's black and white Scotch, crushed ice and a little twist of lemon.

1280
00:58:38,100 --> 00:58:40,780
So, so really just a Scotch on the rocks.

1281
00:58:40,780 --> 00:58:42,100
Yeah, just Scotch on the rocks.

1282
00:58:42,100 --> 00:58:42,420
Yeah.

1283
00:58:42,460 --> 00:58:45,580
Do you know, like, did he get tanked on those?

1284
00:58:45,580 --> 00:58:47,540
Is there any stories of him getting kind of loose?

1285
00:58:47,940 --> 00:58:53,420
I think he got, well, we've read the big thing is that he would go, he, uh, he got an

1286
00:58:53,420 --> 00:58:54,900
injury playing polo.

1287
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:59,220
We did a whole episode on our Patreon called Walt's Polo Injury in which we discovered

1288
00:58:59,220 --> 00:59:03,340
that he was in two polo games with people who died in the game.

1289
00:59:03,420 --> 00:59:03,780
Jesus.

1290
00:59:03,820 --> 00:59:07,700
Two men were murdered by horses in front of Walt Disney.

1291
00:59:07,700 --> 00:59:10,140
His brother was like, stop playing this game.

1292
00:59:10,580 --> 00:59:13,260
No, is that a part of polo?

1293
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:18,060
I mean, it seemed, I guess it's generally dangerous, but I don't, you have to, that

1294
00:59:18,060 --> 00:59:20,180
percentage, cause how many could he possibly have played?

1295
00:59:20,180 --> 00:59:21,860
Did he play more than a hundred games?

1296
00:59:21,860 --> 00:59:22,820
Cause it was just one game.

1297
00:59:22,860 --> 00:59:25,340
Two percent involved death.

1298
00:59:25,340 --> 00:59:26,500
He called him the angel of death.

1299
00:59:27,460 --> 00:59:32,340
So after his polo games, he still kept playing, but then he would, but then he had a

1300
00:59:32,340 --> 00:59:36,500
horrible injury and fell off a horse, didn't die, but a horrible injury.

1301
00:59:36,660 --> 00:59:41,900
So then for years he had a nurse who would give him a massage while he got super

1302
00:59:41,900 --> 00:59:43,900
drunk in a little side room.

1303
00:59:44,100 --> 00:59:48,660
At the end of the day, called his laughing place, like in splash mountain.

1304
00:59:48,900 --> 00:59:51,700
I'm going to go to my laughing place and get a massage and a scotch.

1305
00:59:51,700 --> 00:59:53,500
Yes, that makes sense.

1306
00:59:53,580 --> 00:59:56,300
I'm so curious about the guy cause he's so weird.

1307
00:59:56,300 --> 01:00:02,180
It's like, I, when I moved to Los Felas, I read that the bio, like the big, thick

1308
01:00:02,180 --> 01:00:06,780
biography on him, because I wanted to like walk around Kingswell and Vermont and

1309
01:00:06,780 --> 01:00:08,100
like see all of the spots.

1310
01:00:08,100 --> 01:00:08,580
Oh yeah.

1311
01:00:08,580 --> 01:00:08,860
Yeah.

1312
01:00:08,900 --> 01:00:12,380
That I was trying to remember it all today that Kingswell is where there was a

1313
01:00:12,380 --> 01:00:14,220
house where he first lived.

1314
01:00:14,220 --> 01:00:17,300
It was his uncle's house and he lived with his brother and it's where he made the

1315
01:00:17,300 --> 01:00:19,700
first shorts, the Alice shorts.

1316
01:00:19,780 --> 01:00:20,180
Yeah.

1317
01:00:20,220 --> 01:00:20,980
So that's there.

1318
01:00:20,980 --> 01:00:25,020
But then like the fancier place that he leveled up to was in that neck of the woods.

1319
01:00:25,020 --> 01:00:25,220
Yeah.

1320
01:00:25,220 --> 01:00:29,620
And then like up, like, uh, in, in like the Hills of Los Felas is like his, like

1321
01:00:29,860 --> 01:00:33,540
manch, first mansion he mentioned before he went to like home, B Hills, when he had

1322
01:00:33,540 --> 01:00:38,940
like a giant estate, but like there's a key shop or like a copy shop, uh, shop off

1323
01:00:38,940 --> 01:00:44,460
of Vermont that has a big mural because it was his first, first, yeah, that studio.

1324
01:00:44,580 --> 01:00:45,140
It was first off.

1325
01:00:45,140 --> 01:00:48,020
And so the first like non house where he made, right.

1326
01:00:48,020 --> 01:00:51,540
So cause he moved like right across the street from his uncle and then rented a

1327
01:00:51,540 --> 01:00:56,420
little house and he could like walk to work, but he's a fascinating dude because

1328
01:00:56,420 --> 01:01:04,180
he's, uh, there's a certain creepiness like, you know, his, uh, it's like his

1329
01:01:04,180 --> 01:01:08,780
staff went on on the strike at one point and he just like never got over it.

1330
01:01:08,780 --> 01:01:09,380
And oh yeah.

1331
01:01:09,380 --> 01:01:09,660
Yeah.

1332
01:01:09,660 --> 01:01:11,780
He hates, he hated unions.

1333
01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:12,460
Yeah.

1334
01:01:12,700 --> 01:01:16,180
I mean the undercurrent of his early life seems like there was a lot of hard

1335
01:01:16,180 --> 01:01:18,220
times and a lot of sadness.

1336
01:01:18,260 --> 01:01:18,620
Yeah.

1337
01:01:18,820 --> 01:01:22,940
And then he gets older and he starts to get successful, but then he's haunted by

1338
01:01:22,980 --> 01:01:27,540
chronic injury from a polo, uh, uh, insane polo.

1339
01:01:27,700 --> 01:01:31,260
He, yeah, that's the mention of it that he was in horrible pain for what?

1340
01:01:31,260 --> 01:01:31,540
Yeah.

1341
01:01:31,540 --> 01:01:36,580
30 more years and then died pretty like quickly and violently.

1342
01:01:36,580 --> 01:01:38,620
It seems like that cancer shot through him.

1343
01:01:38,620 --> 01:01:40,460
Smoked like a chimney probably.

1344
01:01:40,460 --> 01:01:43,100
And it seems like he kept long hours.

1345
01:01:43,220 --> 01:01:43,580
Yeah.

1346
01:01:43,620 --> 01:01:46,340
And the smoking probably helped to keep him alert, you know,

1347
01:01:46,340 --> 01:01:51,620
Walt had all the same bad opinions that like a John Taffer might have, you know,

1348
01:01:52,580 --> 01:01:55,820
but his life is interesting and it's full of crazy shit.

1349
01:01:55,860 --> 01:01:56,180
Yeah.

1350
01:01:56,180 --> 01:01:56,420
Yeah.

1351
01:01:56,420 --> 01:01:56,820
Yeah.

1352
01:01:56,820 --> 01:02:01,020
Um, no, it's a weird, we, yeah, I, we like to think we're one of the only

1353
01:02:01,180 --> 01:02:05,380
podcasts about this stuff that isn't just like, and then an angel named

1354
01:02:05,380 --> 01:02:06,820
Walt Disney came to earth.

1355
01:02:06,820 --> 01:02:10,340
I mean, that's why I like thinking both things at the same time is it's like,

1356
01:02:10,980 --> 01:02:15,940
it's, uh, you know, there's like Disney people that are just like, wow, Mickey.

1357
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:18,820
And then there's, uh, and then there's, and then there's people that are like,

1358
01:02:19,140 --> 01:02:20,780
Oh, fucking corporate bullshit, man.

1359
01:02:20,780 --> 01:02:25,580
Fuck all the Disney is like, I think both can be true at once.

1360
01:02:25,580 --> 01:02:30,540
And I like thinking about Walt as like, I do think those movies are, has,

1361
01:02:30,540 --> 01:02:34,820
have a magic to them in the Disney world charms me in a way that's magical.

1362
01:02:34,820 --> 01:02:39,060
And then at the same time, I can walk around Disneyland and kind of see the

1363
01:02:39,060 --> 01:02:42,180
dark side of it and be kind of grossed out by some of the people watching and

1364
01:02:42,180 --> 01:02:42,500
stuff.

1365
01:02:42,780 --> 01:02:44,220
And I like thinking about both at once.

1366
01:02:44,220 --> 01:02:48,620
So I like thinking of Walt, like making an amazing fairy tale movie, but then

1367
01:02:48,620 --> 01:02:51,740
getting drunk during his massage in his laughing room or whatever.

1368
01:02:52,380 --> 01:02:54,340
Like what makes that weird guy tick?

1369
01:02:54,340 --> 01:02:59,260
Because he's like, you could tell by the way some of those nine old men and

1370
01:02:59,260 --> 01:03:02,860
stuff, you would think that they'd be really close with them, but they weren't

1371
01:03:02,860 --> 01:03:05,100
like, they'll tell stories of their best memories of Walt.

1372
01:03:05,100 --> 01:03:09,060
And it's like, you know, after I made Sleeping Beauty, he patted me on the

1373
01:03:09,060 --> 01:03:10,260
back and said, good job.

1374
01:03:10,340 --> 01:03:12,180
And I think of that all the time.

1375
01:03:13,180 --> 01:03:15,980
Oh, I don't know that he was like, I don't think he was very warm.

1376
01:03:16,300 --> 01:03:17,420
Most rampage.

1377
01:03:17,420 --> 01:03:18,620
I think the hugger.

1378
01:03:18,660 --> 01:03:19,140
Yeah.

1379
01:03:19,140 --> 01:03:23,540
He was because I think his persona on TV was like, I'm a big cuddly teddy bear.

1380
01:03:23,540 --> 01:03:23,980
Hello.

1381
01:03:23,980 --> 01:03:24,620
Welcome to me.

1382
01:03:24,620 --> 01:03:26,940
It gives me some money for my movies and theme park.

1383
01:03:27,260 --> 01:03:30,540
But then I, yeah, like the Sherman brothers, I think the last time they saw

1384
01:03:30,540 --> 01:03:34,660
him before he died, they were just like, he actually gave them a solid compliment

1385
01:03:34,700 --> 01:03:36,060
and they were like, something's wrong.

1386
01:03:39,180 --> 01:03:40,100
They like knew something.

1387
01:03:40,980 --> 01:03:42,620
We got to find a new gig.

1388
01:03:42,620 --> 01:03:43,740
Great job fellas.

1389
01:03:43,740 --> 01:03:45,940
And then he closed the door and they were like, he's going to die.

1390
01:03:46,700 --> 01:03:47,900
Man, have you something like that?

1391
01:03:47,900 --> 01:03:49,500
Have you seen that Sherman brothers movie?

1392
01:03:49,780 --> 01:03:50,500
The documentary?

1393
01:03:50,500 --> 01:03:50,660
Yeah.

1394
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:51,020
Yeah.

1395
01:03:51,260 --> 01:03:54,220
And then like when they're, they've been estranged for so long and they see each

1396
01:03:54,220 --> 01:03:57,540
other in the red carpet and one is still kind of like, yeah, no, it never, they

1397
01:03:57,540 --> 01:04:00,140
never got it because they, one of them has passed away.

1398
01:04:00,140 --> 01:04:00,380
Yeah.

1399
01:04:00,420 --> 01:04:03,900
Uh, but no, I don't think they ever, they never got along really well.

1400
01:04:03,940 --> 01:04:08,540
I think at least one of them seemed to elude and it's not a dissimilar

1401
01:04:08,540 --> 01:04:11,820
array from dizzy of like having seen some things in the war.

1402
01:04:11,860 --> 01:04:12,180
Yeah.

1403
01:04:12,300 --> 01:04:12,740
Yes.

1404
01:04:12,740 --> 01:04:14,100
That was, that's the one.

1405
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:17,460
There's one who's a goofball and one who's a war vet who was in the shit

1406
01:04:17,460 --> 01:04:18,620
and is fucked up forever.

1407
01:04:18,660 --> 01:04:19,060
Yeah.

1408
01:04:19,100 --> 01:04:19,460
Yeah.

1409
01:04:19,460 --> 01:04:22,060
And that's, I think, I mean, he would drink with the Sherman bro.

1410
01:04:22,100 --> 01:04:26,460
Like there's the anecdote about like him inviting the Sherman brothers to his

1411
01:04:26,460 --> 01:04:30,980
office and there was a piano and they go, he's played the song and they know to

1412
01:04:30,980 --> 01:04:33,100
play feed the birds for Mary Poppins.

1413
01:04:35,180 --> 01:04:40,140
Him, him wanting, him wanting to hear feed the birds, the saddest song from

1414
01:04:40,140 --> 01:04:40,780
Mary Poppins.

1415
01:04:40,820 --> 01:04:44,180
And I think that is a very interesting anecdote.

1416
01:04:44,220 --> 01:04:47,500
It is also one of the most heartbreaking things I've ever heard.

1417
01:04:47,500 --> 01:04:48,020
Yeah.

1418
01:04:48,860 --> 01:04:51,180
Walt wanted to wallow in his sadness.

1419
01:04:51,220 --> 01:04:51,420
Yeah.

1420
01:04:51,420 --> 01:04:54,380
So he wanted us to play live one of the saddest songs.

1421
01:04:54,380 --> 01:04:55,540
But if he, oh, go ahead.

1422
01:04:55,540 --> 01:05:00,620
Oh, I was going to say that, uh, one of the, uh, I briefly lived about a half

1423
01:05:00,620 --> 01:05:05,980
mile from the Tambo Shantar and the most, I think the place that I, the closest

1424
01:05:05,980 --> 01:05:07,540
I ever came to having a haunt.

1425
01:05:08,140 --> 01:05:08,420
Yeah.

1426
01:05:08,420 --> 01:05:13,620
I certainly did drink there a lot because I was very depressed at the time.

1427
01:05:14,140 --> 01:05:16,940
So happy time, you know, there's even happy moments.

1428
01:05:16,940 --> 01:05:18,260
Did you make any brilliant feature films?

1429
01:05:19,580 --> 01:05:20,380
I know.

1430
01:05:20,380 --> 01:05:21,060
Indelible characters.

1431
01:05:21,460 --> 01:05:23,340
And I just got drunk and did improv.

1432
01:05:24,700 --> 01:05:27,380
Many, like 30 characters a show.

1433
01:05:29,380 --> 01:05:34,420
Any number of little bits in streaming things that are now lost to the ages.

1434
01:05:34,740 --> 01:05:35,860
They're off of the internet.

1435
01:05:35,940 --> 01:05:39,460
That are onto beat up decaying Lucy hard drives.

1436
01:05:41,020 --> 01:05:44,660
Did you become or any of you, uh, VIP members Lowry's?

1437
01:05:44,660 --> 01:05:45,300
Oh yeah.

1438
01:05:45,380 --> 01:05:46,020
Oh, there you go.

1439
01:05:46,020 --> 01:05:46,340
Yeah.

1440
01:05:47,540 --> 01:05:52,380
I looked at my history before recording today because your whole history is

1441
01:05:52,380 --> 01:05:52,940
recorded.

1442
01:05:52,940 --> 01:05:55,700
If you go online, it'll tell you when, what days you ate there.

1443
01:05:55,740 --> 01:05:55,940
Wow.

1444
01:05:55,940 --> 01:05:59,180
The greatest story of how many points you accrued that day.

1445
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:00,580
I love pulling out that card.

1446
01:06:00,580 --> 01:06:02,340
I feel like a big shot and it does.

1447
01:06:02,580 --> 01:06:05,260
Sometimes it's like a pretty, you know, like it's a crap shoot.

1448
01:06:05,260 --> 01:06:07,620
Sometimes like, Oh, dessert was free or it's 10% off.

1449
01:06:07,740 --> 01:06:10,340
I've been there with people where it's like this whole fucking meal was free.

1450
01:06:10,380 --> 01:06:13,060
Like, yeah, major point.

1451
01:06:13,060 --> 01:06:13,220
Yeah.

1452
01:06:13,220 --> 01:06:16,780
This is a, I think the doughboys maybe turned me onto this fact that if you,

1453
01:06:16,900 --> 01:06:21,860
that it's a very reasonable, will pay itself back VIP program.

1454
01:06:22,140 --> 01:06:23,300
So glad I did it.

1455
01:06:23,340 --> 01:06:26,740
Cause yeah, if you go just for, you know, for big celebrations or whatever, but

1456
01:06:26,740 --> 01:06:28,460
you want a little further, correct?

1457
01:06:28,580 --> 01:06:28,980
Oh yes.

1458
01:06:28,980 --> 01:06:34,620
I've bragged to you about how I, my wedding was that, have you ever been to

1459
01:06:34,620 --> 01:06:35,860
the LA river center?

1460
01:06:36,180 --> 01:06:36,780
No, no.

1461
01:06:36,780 --> 01:06:42,500
Cypress park kind of near the, um, home Depot, like on the other side of Dodger

1462
01:06:42,500 --> 01:06:44,940
stadium, um, on the other side of the river from Dodger stadium.

1463
01:06:44,940 --> 01:06:48,420
And it's now like, it's this weird place that you can have weddings at, but it's

1464
01:06:48,420 --> 01:06:53,340
sort of just, um, it feels like it's owned by the city government or something.

1465
01:06:53,340 --> 01:06:58,580
And it's just like this kind of old event space, charming outdoor kind of

1466
01:06:58,580 --> 01:07:03,540
Spanish, uh, courtyard, but then a little, a little bit dingy and a little bit

1467
01:07:03,540 --> 01:07:07,900
dated. And when me and Jessica were touring wedding venues, we were like

1468
01:07:07,900 --> 01:07:08,740
charmed by the place.

1469
01:07:08,740 --> 01:07:15,580
And then we found out the history of it is, um, it was Lowry's, uh, like the

1470
01:07:15,580 --> 01:07:19,420
same Lowry's, uh, and you know, like they got real big after the seasoned salt.

1471
01:07:19,780 --> 01:07:20,580
Uh, and,

1472
01:07:20,740 --> 01:07:24,180
Oh yes, this might be the, if her listeners not in Los Angeles, this might

1473
01:07:24,180 --> 01:07:27,380
be where you've heard the name Lowry, cause that's a product nationwide, correct?

1474
01:07:27,460 --> 01:07:28,980
A lot of people put it on eggs.

1475
01:07:28,980 --> 01:07:32,860
I saw, I was watching the Kardashians and Chris Kardashian was like, you can't

1476
01:07:32,860 --> 01:07:35,580
have eggs without Lowry's seasoned salt.

1477
01:07:35,580 --> 01:07:38,700
And then Dutton was saying like, Oh, growing up, I always had this on my eggs.

1478
01:07:38,900 --> 01:07:39,300
Wow.

1479
01:07:39,300 --> 01:07:39,700
Wow.

1480
01:07:39,740 --> 01:07:40,860
I think of it as a prime rib.

1481
01:07:40,980 --> 01:07:43,340
We always had seasoned pepper in the house.

1482
01:07:43,420 --> 01:07:43,620
Yeah.

1483
01:07:43,620 --> 01:07:46,460
It's a couple brands of it, but Lowry's being one of them.

1484
01:07:46,820 --> 01:07:48,660
I'm sure I love their logo.

1485
01:07:48,660 --> 01:07:53,700
Just that, like that, that becalming big, thick swirly L it feels so like

1486
01:07:54,660 --> 01:07:55,180
designer.

1487
01:07:55,180 --> 01:07:56,540
It's like one of those guys.

1488
01:07:56,900 --> 01:07:57,340
Oh really?

1489
01:07:57,460 --> 01:07:57,980
Yeah.

1490
01:07:58,420 --> 01:08:00,220
Like Saul Bass.

1491
01:08:00,220 --> 01:08:00,940
Is that a designer?

1492
01:08:00,940 --> 01:08:01,380
What?

1493
01:08:01,420 --> 01:08:02,060
Oh, yeah.

1494
01:08:02,060 --> 01:08:02,500
Yeah.

1495
01:08:02,820 --> 01:08:03,300
I, yeah.

1496
01:08:03,300 --> 01:08:06,380
Now I don't remember what the, what the Saul Bass stuff is, but yeah, for sure.

1497
01:08:06,380 --> 01:08:06,580
Yeah.

1498
01:08:06,580 --> 01:08:10,660
So Lowry's prime rib restaurant is similarly like in the way that Tamar

1499
01:08:10,660 --> 01:08:15,020
Shanter is themey, their hook is that they have, they roll around these big

1500
01:08:15,020 --> 01:08:18,820
brass carts to cut your prime rib from.

1501
01:08:18,860 --> 01:08:20,420
And so they cut it right in front of you.

1502
01:08:20,780 --> 01:08:23,820
And then when they came out with this season salt, that was huge.

1503
01:08:23,820 --> 01:08:25,460
And then the corporation got really big.

1504
01:08:25,500 --> 01:08:30,380
So in like the early seventies, right after like, when did Walt die?

1505
01:08:30,460 --> 01:08:32,300
Late 66, 66.

1506
01:08:32,340 --> 01:08:36,060
And he was like midway through planning Epcot, right?

1507
01:08:36,060 --> 01:08:38,260
He thought it was going to be its actual city or something.

1508
01:08:38,260 --> 01:08:39,900
That's what it was at the TIA.

1509
01:08:39,900 --> 01:08:42,860
And then they, they bought that Florida property right before he died.

1510
01:08:42,900 --> 01:08:46,660
I think in the sort of same way that he would have been inspired by the

1511
01:08:46,660 --> 01:08:51,980
world's fair and stuff, the Lowry's people tried to open up like an

1512
01:08:51,980 --> 01:08:56,220
amusement park type vibe, not with, not with rides, but a cultural center.

1513
01:08:56,540 --> 01:08:58,620
That is now the LA river center where I got married.

1514
01:08:58,620 --> 01:09:02,220
It was, it was the Lowry's California center.

1515
01:09:03,340 --> 01:09:05,580
It was their corporate offices for the salt.

1516
01:09:05,980 --> 01:09:09,820
And then also there was, um, it was like, you would buy a day pass and walk

1517
01:09:09,820 --> 01:09:13,820
around and there was a Mexican restaurant and a Chinese restaurant and Lowry's

1518
01:09:13,820 --> 01:09:16,740
prime rib, and it just went out of business right away.

1519
01:09:17,860 --> 01:09:20,740
They thought it was going to be like the Epcot of food.

1520
01:09:20,740 --> 01:09:21,580
Whoa.

1521
01:09:21,580 --> 01:09:22,380
And it didn't work.

1522
01:09:22,380 --> 01:09:23,820
Oh, I'd love to find photos of that.

1523
01:09:23,820 --> 01:09:24,660
That must've been.

1524
01:09:25,020 --> 01:09:25,380
It's cool.

1525
01:09:25,380 --> 01:09:29,220
I, I, I, I, there, there are some online cause I was looking at it when I was

1526
01:09:29,220 --> 01:09:32,860
like planning my wedding and it's like their original promotional postcards and

1527
01:09:32,860 --> 01:09:37,420
stuff are like people sit very much like the way that California was sold to the

1528
01:09:37,420 --> 01:09:41,380
Midwest is like come out to the Rose bowl and eat an orange and all this shit.

1529
01:09:41,380 --> 01:09:45,540
It was like a part of the like, look at dining, alfresco in LA.

1530
01:09:46,220 --> 01:09:50,100
Anyway, Lowry's has a deal, still has a deal with the LA river center.

1531
01:09:50,100 --> 01:09:52,140
And so that they cater weddings.

1532
01:09:52,460 --> 01:09:56,020
So the food at my reception was Lowry's prime rib.

1533
01:09:56,300 --> 01:09:57,660
The cards that you push.

1534
01:09:57,700 --> 01:09:59,100
Oh, that's happening.

1535
01:09:59,100 --> 01:09:59,660
All that shit.

1536
01:09:59,660 --> 01:10:02,260
They did the grand spinning salad bowl.

1537
01:10:02,300 --> 01:10:02,660
Yeah.

1538
01:10:02,660 --> 01:10:03,580
It had all the shit.

1539
01:10:03,620 --> 01:10:08,740
It was, it was so fun and it was great wedding food, but that way I signed up

1540
01:10:08,740 --> 01:10:11,580
for a Lowry's card right before my wedding.

1541
01:10:11,580 --> 01:10:13,620
So you would normally like have to accrue points.

1542
01:10:14,060 --> 01:10:18,740
I entered as a platinum guy cause I spent like thousands of dollars and one night.

1543
01:10:19,660 --> 01:10:22,900
So I was eating free at the Tamo Shantor for like years after that.

1544
01:10:22,900 --> 01:10:23,220
Yeah.

1545
01:10:23,220 --> 01:10:24,020
It was amazing.

1546
01:10:24,020 --> 01:10:24,620
Wow.

1547
01:10:24,620 --> 01:10:25,420
What a good deal.

1548
01:10:25,420 --> 01:10:29,220
What a way to like actually get value out of a wedding, which is for sure.

1549
01:10:29,220 --> 01:10:31,140
Nothing but like a waste of money.

1550
01:10:31,140 --> 01:10:31,660
I also.

1551
01:10:31,660 --> 01:10:32,380
It's a waste of money.

1552
01:10:32,380 --> 01:10:32,820
It's wonderful.

1553
01:10:33,020 --> 01:10:33,540
But you know what I mean?

1554
01:10:33,540 --> 01:10:34,060
Yeah.

1555
01:10:34,340 --> 01:10:35,060
My wedding was on the go.

1556
01:10:35,060 --> 01:10:35,260
Yeah.

1557
01:10:35,260 --> 01:10:36,060
It's a sham.

1558
01:10:36,100 --> 01:10:36,820
Love isn't real.

1559
01:10:36,820 --> 01:10:37,620
We get it, Scott.

1560
01:10:38,900 --> 01:10:40,420
Hi, you're so cynical, Scott.

1561
01:10:40,820 --> 01:10:43,860
I did the same thing with like, I had a lot of family staying at the Westin.

1562
01:10:43,860 --> 01:10:46,780
So I started up, signed up for like Starwood points or what?

1563
01:10:46,780 --> 01:10:50,020
I was never a points guy and I got a bunch of free hotels off that too.

1564
01:10:50,020 --> 01:10:52,220
So you, a wedding could be a money-making venture.

1565
01:10:54,220 --> 01:10:55,220
I encourage everyone to have an up-tual.

1566
01:10:55,220 --> 01:11:00,540
The care is just turning in Mike's head cause he's great at gaming these kind of systems.

1567
01:11:01,460 --> 01:11:07,500
I know one of the parts of being a Lowry's member, I think for your birthday and for

1568
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:10,860
your anniversary, I think now.

1569
01:11:10,860 --> 01:11:12,780
Your anniversary of joining.

1570
01:11:12,820 --> 01:11:13,180
Yeah.

1571
01:11:13,180 --> 01:11:16,020
Not your shit marriage anniversary.

1572
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:17,740
Fraud money scheme.

1573
01:11:17,740 --> 01:11:17,980
Yeah.

1574
01:11:17,980 --> 01:11:23,500
I think it's changed where now when you go, if that's is on your card, they'll just give

1575
01:11:23,500 --> 01:11:28,500
you a bottle that says Tamoshant or a seasoning salt for a while.

1576
01:11:28,660 --> 01:11:33,340
They would mail you a personalized seasoned pepper or seasoned salt.

1577
01:11:33,660 --> 01:11:36,260
And so I have a bunch just on my desk.

1578
01:11:36,260 --> 01:11:38,900
It's hard to get through them all.

1579
01:11:38,940 --> 01:11:39,460
Yeah.

1580
01:11:39,900 --> 01:11:41,620
I mean, I used one or two of them, but.

1581
01:11:41,940 --> 01:11:47,820
It's sort of like hilariously not like you picture like it's inscribed in gold, but

1582
01:11:47,820 --> 01:11:50,300
that's just kind of like a piece of paper printed out.

1583
01:11:50,300 --> 01:11:51,860
You see the print marks on it.

1584
01:11:52,020 --> 01:11:53,060
It's got Gardner.

1585
01:11:53,420 --> 01:11:55,820
It's like a name tag for like a hotel seminar.

1586
01:11:55,820 --> 01:11:57,780
Have you got the Christmas ornaments?

1587
01:11:58,140 --> 01:11:58,740
No.

1588
01:11:59,140 --> 01:12:01,780
Maybe this is, this might be for the platinum.

1589
01:12:02,420 --> 01:12:02,580
Yeah.

1590
01:12:02,580 --> 01:12:06,220
I get the salt on my birthday and then for Christmas they send you an ornament and one

1591
01:12:06,220 --> 01:12:10,620
time it was like a little gold medal with like a ribbon that would go around your neck.

1592
01:12:10,620 --> 01:12:18,540
And it said Lowry's and then the couple of years ago it was a like a silver thing that

1593
01:12:18,540 --> 01:12:20,380
was just shaped like a season salt.

1594
01:12:20,780 --> 01:12:21,500
Like a fancy.

1595
01:12:21,500 --> 01:12:22,140
Wow.

1596
01:12:22,140 --> 01:12:23,220
Fake seasoned salt.

1597
01:12:23,220 --> 01:12:24,740
A treasured ornament.

1598
01:12:24,780 --> 01:12:26,540
There's not a higher level than you are.

1599
01:12:27,020 --> 01:12:27,540
Probably.

1600
01:12:27,540 --> 01:12:27,780
I don't know.

1601
01:12:27,780 --> 01:12:28,420
I just.

1602
01:12:28,420 --> 01:12:29,020
CEO.

1603
01:12:29,020 --> 01:12:32,980
I've seen the gold card and I know mine says platinum, but I mean, maybe there's like a

1604
01:12:32,980 --> 01:12:34,460
black card that's really thick.

1605
01:12:34,500 --> 01:12:34,980
Yeah.

1606
01:12:35,140 --> 01:12:36,020
That it's just free.

1607
01:12:36,100 --> 01:12:36,420
Yeah.

1608
01:12:36,460 --> 01:12:37,220
Everything's free.

1609
01:12:37,220 --> 01:12:40,540
You can just snap and like a big rare cut of meat shows up.

1610
01:12:40,540 --> 01:12:41,860
You can get Nick 30 seconds.

1611
01:12:41,860 --> 01:12:43,220
You can get carolers to show up.

1612
01:12:43,220 --> 01:12:44,220
Not Christmas time.

1613
01:12:44,260 --> 01:12:44,980
Not at Christmas time.

1614
01:12:45,300 --> 01:12:45,940
I want to do.

1615
01:12:45,940 --> 01:12:47,020
Sing South Side Johnny.

1616
01:12:47,020 --> 01:12:47,300
Go.

1617
01:12:47,460 --> 01:12:47,860
Sing.

1618
01:12:48,020 --> 01:12:48,740
Feed the birds.

1619
01:12:48,740 --> 01:12:50,940
It's in the summer and they come see you.

1620
01:12:52,260 --> 01:12:53,660
Love on the wrong side.

1621
01:12:53,660 --> 01:12:54,500
Have you ever had.

1622
01:12:54,860 --> 01:12:59,140
You know, the biggest cut of primer about the Tamar Shantor is the Prince Charlie cut

1623
01:12:59,140 --> 01:13:00,820
and it's like a big fat steak.

1624
01:13:01,180 --> 01:13:06,580
And then, but over at the Beverly Hills Lowry's they have the diamond Jim Brady cut that

1625
01:13:06,580 --> 01:13:07,620
I've been afraid to order.

1626
01:13:08,260 --> 01:13:10,780
Diamond Jim Brady is a famous eater from New York.

1627
01:13:10,980 --> 01:13:13,700
A hundred years ago, referenced on the Simpsons.

1628
01:13:13,700 --> 01:13:17,060
I think it's like sometimes they call Mayor Quimby like diamond joke.

1629
01:13:17,100 --> 01:13:17,900
Yes, yes.

1630
01:13:19,100 --> 01:13:23,380
I looked him up when on the on the sloppy boys podcast, we're talking about some

1631
01:13:23,380 --> 01:13:28,500
cocktail that diamond Jim Brady ate, but he was just a guy that would like, he was

1632
01:13:28,500 --> 01:13:32,820
just, you know, probably like a steel baron or something, but he would go out to dinner

1633
01:13:32,820 --> 01:13:36,260
in Times Square every night before seeing a Broadway show and would just eat so much

1634
01:13:36,260 --> 01:13:37,580
food that he got famous.

1635
01:13:38,100 --> 01:13:40,940
And so the Lowry's like named their double cut.

1636
01:13:40,940 --> 01:13:42,940
It's two Tamar Shantor cuts.

1637
01:13:42,940 --> 01:13:45,100
So I think you, I think you get two bones.

1638
01:13:45,580 --> 01:13:45,940
Wow.

1639
01:13:45,940 --> 01:13:46,940
That's how fucking thick.

1640
01:13:46,940 --> 01:13:47,700
My goodness.

1641
01:13:48,620 --> 01:13:49,540
That's wild.

1642
01:13:49,580 --> 01:13:49,860
Wow.

1643
01:13:49,860 --> 01:13:51,100
What's your favorite?

1644
01:13:51,100 --> 01:13:52,060
Did you say your favorite steak?

1645
01:13:52,060 --> 01:13:52,460
Oh yeah.

1646
01:13:52,460 --> 01:13:54,140
What's your food option when you, when you do.

1647
01:13:54,140 --> 01:13:58,460
I find it hard to not, I always get primary, but I always just get the Tamar Shantor cut

1648
01:13:58,580 --> 01:14:00,900
and I get spinach once in a while.

1649
01:14:00,900 --> 01:14:03,740
If they have a ribeye special where they're actually grilling a steak.

1650
01:14:04,060 --> 01:14:05,380
I like it like a char grilled steak.

1651
01:14:05,380 --> 01:14:06,540
So I do that as a special.

1652
01:14:07,180 --> 01:14:09,580
I love the devil's on horseback.

1653
01:14:09,620 --> 01:14:13,260
They don't always have them, but there's an appetizer that's like dates wrapped in bacon.

1654
01:14:13,620 --> 01:14:14,100
Oh yeah.

1655
01:14:14,100 --> 01:14:14,580
Oh cool.

1656
01:14:14,580 --> 01:14:15,300
They're really good.

1657
01:14:15,300 --> 01:14:15,620
Yeah.

1658
01:14:15,620 --> 01:14:16,020
Yeah.

1659
01:14:16,540 --> 01:14:19,700
If, you know, if I could go back, you, you, something you asked a little while ago is

1660
01:14:19,700 --> 01:14:20,860
what did Walt eat?

1661
01:14:20,860 --> 01:14:26,580
I found one article that seemed to assert that he ate one of the stranger, more specific

1662
01:14:26,580 --> 01:14:30,140
Scottish things on the menu, which is the toad in the hole.

1663
01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:30,860
Yes.

1664
01:14:30,940 --> 01:14:33,860
And the toad in the hole is it's a, all right, let me read their description.

1665
01:14:33,860 --> 01:14:38,500
A Scottish mix of filet mignon, mushrooms, onions, and Guinness gravy, all served in

1666
01:14:38,500 --> 01:14:39,700
a Yorkshire pudding.

1667
01:14:40,220 --> 01:14:43,060
So that's like a little, it is like a pastry.

1668
01:14:43,220 --> 01:14:44,820
It's a, it's a meat pie.

1669
01:14:44,820 --> 01:14:46,580
It's very medieval.

1670
01:14:46,980 --> 01:14:47,700
It is.

1671
01:14:47,700 --> 01:14:48,700
I've had it and it's great.

1672
01:14:48,700 --> 01:14:52,180
And I would recommend to anyone that's like intimidated by just like having a giant piece

1673
01:14:52,180 --> 01:14:53,140
of a cow on your plate.

1674
01:14:53,460 --> 01:14:58,100
It's, it's a nicer meal because it's just like little pieces of, of filet, but yeah,

1675
01:14:58,140 --> 01:15:01,580
it's like the, like a pastry that you're cutting into, but it has gravy in it.

1676
01:15:01,620 --> 01:15:02,180
It's pretty good.

1677
01:15:02,580 --> 01:15:05,700
I couldn't tell if it would like wipe me out if that was going to be like the heaviest

1678
01:15:05,700 --> 01:15:07,060
thing ever, but it's small.

1679
01:15:07,060 --> 01:15:11,060
It's still heavy, but it's not as heavy as you're, you're at least getting less like

1680
01:15:11,060 --> 01:15:11,820
protein.

1681
01:15:12,460 --> 01:15:12,980
Yeah.

1682
01:15:13,060 --> 01:15:13,380
Right.

1683
01:15:13,380 --> 01:15:16,140
There's vegetables and usually a sides out with it too.

1684
01:15:16,580 --> 01:15:19,460
They serve a toad in the hole at Universal.

1685
01:15:20,740 --> 01:15:21,380
The Wizarding World.

1686
01:15:21,380 --> 01:15:21,620
Yeah.

1687
01:15:21,620 --> 01:15:27,220
One of the Wizarding Worlds, but it's a Yorkshire pudding with sausage, I think is

1688
01:15:27,220 --> 01:15:28,500
how I've seen it done before.

1689
01:15:28,500 --> 01:15:28,820
Okay.

1690
01:15:28,820 --> 01:15:29,060
Yeah.

1691
01:15:29,060 --> 01:15:29,380
Yeah.

1692
01:15:29,380 --> 01:15:29,620
Yeah.

1693
01:15:29,620 --> 01:15:31,740
And they make it more steak oriented here.

1694
01:15:31,740 --> 01:15:32,060
Probably.

1695
01:15:32,340 --> 01:15:36,980
I was wondering, uh, cause I had heard that they had like a secret menu and somebody

1696
01:15:36,980 --> 01:15:40,260
said that there was a, there's an off menu burger there.

1697
01:15:40,580 --> 01:15:43,580
That's like this open face and it has the Scotch rare bit.

1698
01:15:43,580 --> 01:15:46,940
And it's like an old timey burger that they would have been serving when Walt was

1699
01:15:46,940 --> 01:15:47,260
around.

1700
01:15:47,780 --> 01:15:50,580
And, um, I did the thing where I ordered it and they were like, what?

1701
01:15:52,140 --> 01:15:53,740
Humiliated and they didn't have it.

1702
01:15:53,740 --> 01:15:56,380
Oh, that's why you never want to shutter.

1703
01:15:56,700 --> 01:16:01,260
You can just order the burger and add on Scotch rare bit to it.

1704
01:16:01,340 --> 01:16:03,500
Well, here is what I did.

1705
01:16:03,500 --> 01:16:05,980
I went because I wanted to do something I hadn't done and there was a little

1706
01:16:05,980 --> 01:16:06,460
heavier.

1707
01:16:06,460 --> 01:16:10,420
So my meal last night, by the way, took the family, took my son for the first

1708
01:16:10,420 --> 01:16:10,740
time.

1709
01:16:11,060 --> 01:16:11,860
That was very exciting.

1710
01:16:11,860 --> 01:16:14,020
Worked for a kid, Mac and cheese out.

1711
01:16:14,020 --> 01:16:14,740
Lickety split.

1712
01:16:14,740 --> 01:16:17,260
That's the most important thing to a parent dining out.

1713
01:16:17,580 --> 01:16:23,460
Uh, so, so that was special to be there, uh, with him, but then, uh, like, okay,

1714
01:16:23,460 --> 01:16:24,340
I gotta go a little heavier here.

1715
01:16:24,420 --> 01:16:29,500
So I did a prime rib sandwich with that side of Scotch rare bit, which is like,

1716
01:16:29,500 --> 01:16:33,780
if you've ever had that, that's sort of a, it's a beer cheese.

1717
01:16:35,380 --> 01:16:35,980
Yeah.

1718
01:16:36,020 --> 01:16:36,380
Yeah.

1719
01:16:36,380 --> 01:16:39,100
With a little bit of kick, like a cayenne pepper kick.

1720
01:16:39,620 --> 01:16:40,580
They do that there.

1721
01:16:40,780 --> 01:16:47,100
So pouring that on top of just like simple meat sandwich with that coleslaw

1722
01:16:47,100 --> 01:16:50,900
and the pickles on the, this might've been the best thing I've eaten in months

1723
01:16:50,900 --> 01:16:54,060
and months, the feeling of dripping that cheese.

1724
01:16:54,220 --> 01:16:55,940
All over like the extra.

1725
01:16:55,980 --> 01:16:57,340
What was the thing you were talking about a while ago?

1726
01:16:57,340 --> 01:17:00,860
Oscar, when you Oscar the, that felt like an Oscar.

1727
01:17:01,020 --> 01:17:01,500
Yeah.

1728
01:17:01,540 --> 01:17:05,820
Uh, and crab and, uh, asparagus.

1729
01:17:05,900 --> 01:17:06,180
Yeah.

1730
01:17:06,260 --> 01:17:07,700
So I would fit that little extra cake.

1731
01:17:08,980 --> 01:17:10,500
I read a really good article.

1732
01:17:10,860 --> 01:17:16,460
Um, I'm, uh, I forget what website it was on, but recently just explaining

1733
01:17:16,460 --> 01:17:20,540
like the thrill of a steak house is like, and it, cause I love steak houses so

1734
01:17:20,540 --> 01:17:23,340
much and I know there's like better food I could have, especially in LA.

1735
01:17:23,340 --> 01:17:24,860
There's like so many good restaurants.

1736
01:17:24,860 --> 01:17:29,140
I feel kind of dumb for going back to Musso and Frank so much, but I,

1737
01:17:29,820 --> 01:17:33,740
it, I read an article that encapsulated the thing of like the indulgence,

1738
01:17:34,140 --> 01:17:37,380
like the way that everything is served, like, like a la carte and just the idea

1739
01:17:37,380 --> 01:17:41,340
of like when you're eating a steak and you have a martini and you have it like

1740
01:17:41,380 --> 01:17:45,260
au gratin potatoes or cream spinach, it's like, you're not supposed to eat this

1741
01:17:45,260 --> 01:17:49,060
stuff, you know, you're not supposed to eat this beef in this amount.

1742
01:17:49,060 --> 01:17:52,500
Like doctors are like, yeah, have a steak, the size of a deck of cards.

1743
01:17:52,500 --> 01:17:56,420
You can absolutely have a steak, but it's like when you, like if you're martini,

1744
01:17:56,420 --> 01:17:59,860
you're just like, that's like gin, you know, it's like straight to the dome

1745
01:17:59,900 --> 01:18:04,220
and steak and stuff and that there's like, you know, that you're like the

1746
01:18:04,260 --> 01:18:08,420
self destructive nature of eating a meal like that does make you feel good.

1747
01:18:08,660 --> 01:18:10,340
So it has to be a special occasion.

1748
01:18:10,580 --> 01:18:13,220
And if you go there on a Friday or on a birthday or something, you're like,

1749
01:18:13,540 --> 01:18:14,580
yeah, take this body.

1750
01:18:14,780 --> 01:18:19,380
I'm going to dip my roast beef sandwich into the, into the rare bit and eat it.

1751
01:18:19,780 --> 01:18:23,940
And that is like, yeah, it's like not meant to be part of your, uh, of your

1752
01:18:23,940 --> 01:18:28,300
normal diet, but it makes you feel like you're like cutting loose and indulging

1753
01:18:28,300 --> 01:18:31,500
in a weird way and how much physical space.

1754
01:18:31,660 --> 01:18:34,940
And if you're a table, if you're at a little table like Walt's table and like,

1755
01:18:34,940 --> 01:18:39,300
it's all overtaken by here's lots of little side dishes, giant cuts of meat.

1756
01:18:39,300 --> 01:18:42,580
Like it is so, uh, yeah, I don't know.

1757
01:18:42,580 --> 01:18:47,100
And the next level, uh, uh, kingly and Walt would have it every night.

1758
01:18:47,100 --> 01:18:47,620
Yeah.

1759
01:18:49,020 --> 01:18:50,260
Chilly all day.

1760
01:18:50,820 --> 01:18:51,060
Yeah.

1761
01:18:51,060 --> 01:18:52,060
Steaks all night.

1762
01:18:52,140 --> 01:18:52,460
Yeah.

1763
01:18:52,620 --> 01:18:54,180
Uh, I do like the burger.

1764
01:18:54,220 --> 01:18:56,540
I usually get the burger when I, I go there.

1765
01:18:56,540 --> 01:19:01,500
If I'm eating at the bar, um, uh, uh, uh, they have a chicken sandwich now too.

1766
01:19:01,500 --> 01:19:04,780
They have like a fried chicken sandwich with like coleslaw on top.

1767
01:19:04,780 --> 01:19:06,820
And I think they added a bunch of stuff.

1768
01:19:06,820 --> 01:19:07,740
It's very solid.

1769
01:19:07,780 --> 01:19:08,700
It's very solid.

1770
01:19:08,700 --> 01:19:09,420
That's what I had.

1771
01:19:09,420 --> 01:19:11,820
The listeners know this, but you haven't heard this.

1772
01:19:11,820 --> 01:19:15,340
I don't think so that I, uh, very early pandemic.

1773
01:19:15,420 --> 01:19:19,980
I were super craving like the places that we miss going like this.

1774
01:19:20,220 --> 01:19:25,460
Uh, so we did take out with a takeout cocktail, a maple old fashioned from

1775
01:19:25,460 --> 01:19:29,580
Tamoshanter I did that crispy chicken sandwich, just driving over there, felt

1776
01:19:29,580 --> 01:19:34,340
nice and seeing that exterior in that all in the, in the thick of it, uh, the

1777
01:19:34,340 --> 01:19:38,580
little shot of that story book, uh, village, uh, but then also sad that it's

1778
01:19:38,580 --> 01:19:41,580
boarded up and no, don't come anywhere close, but it was very nice, like

1779
01:19:41,940 --> 01:19:45,740
comfort food to have felt great and like chilling out a little bit because before

1780
01:19:45,740 --> 01:19:48,100
the big crazy month I had ahead of me, cause I was going to have a baby

1781
01:19:48,100 --> 01:19:51,620
probably in a month and instead of Aaron's water broke right then and there.

1782
01:19:51,740 --> 01:19:55,100
And I had half of that old fashioned and thank God I was drinking slow

1783
01:19:55,340 --> 01:19:59,220
because then I had to go do the most difficult thing ever and drive her, you

1784
01:19:59,220 --> 01:20:02,220
know, so it'd be responsible for my family.

1785
01:20:02,540 --> 01:20:06,260
Uh, so, but now I'm like, oh, now we, we kept that bottle.

1786
01:20:06,260 --> 01:20:06,740
Yes.

1787
01:20:06,860 --> 01:20:10,220
And my parents got engaged at the Beverly Hills Lowry.

1788
01:20:10,380 --> 01:20:10,860
Really?

1789
01:20:10,860 --> 01:20:12,820
So it's so hard of the family.

1790
01:20:12,820 --> 01:20:13,220
Yes.

1791
01:20:13,380 --> 01:20:14,900
It's why I'm around.

1792
01:20:14,900 --> 01:20:17,420
It's why my, not why my son's around.

1793
01:20:19,340 --> 01:20:21,700
I'm sure you had a couple of old fashions that night.

1794
01:20:22,180 --> 01:20:25,620
The fact that I made it, the fact that I didn't get too drunk off the old

1795
01:20:25,620 --> 01:20:27,900
fashion and crashed the car is why he's around.

1796
01:20:28,260 --> 01:20:30,140
Um, I forget that you're from LA, right?

1797
01:20:30,140 --> 01:20:30,620
The Valley.

1798
01:20:30,620 --> 01:20:30,900
Yeah.

1799
01:20:30,940 --> 01:20:31,260
Yeah.

1800
01:20:31,260 --> 01:20:33,340
Where, uh, Woodland Hills.

1801
01:20:33,500 --> 01:20:33,940
I love it.

1802
01:20:33,980 --> 01:20:38,940
Um, was Lowry's like a part, and if, if your parents got engaged there, like,

1803
01:20:39,180 --> 01:20:42,580
was that a, is that, was that a part of your childhood or is that a thing?

1804
01:20:42,580 --> 01:20:43,860
No, actually no.

1805
01:20:43,860 --> 01:20:45,220
And nor was Tamar's change.

1806
01:20:45,220 --> 01:20:46,860
I feel like a real latecomer.

1807
01:20:47,020 --> 01:20:51,100
I guess it's kind of far from Woodland Hills, but I, um, did you ever go to

1808
01:20:51,100 --> 01:20:54,420
Chasen's was that around when you were, cause that's another name, but I, I,

1809
01:20:54,420 --> 01:20:58,180
it's like a place that a lot of like another old school, old school.

1810
01:20:58,300 --> 01:20:59,540
It's gone now and I never got to go.

1811
01:20:59,540 --> 01:21:03,660
But, um, I just wonder with Lowry's, they have a funny hook that you go there.

1812
01:21:03,860 --> 01:21:08,500
And while you're waiting for this delicious prime rib, they have free

1813
01:21:08,500 --> 01:21:11,940
meatballs in the lobby and terrible.

1814
01:21:11,980 --> 01:21:17,100
They're like Costco, Costco meatballs and, and potato chips that are pretty good.

1815
01:21:17,100 --> 01:21:20,300
They're like natural cut potato chips, but all these people are about to have

1816
01:21:20,300 --> 01:21:24,020
like an amazing dinner or just like these toothpick meatballs in the lobby.

1817
01:21:24,020 --> 01:21:27,940
And so it's like, you know, a neighborhood bar that just has a crock pot

1818
01:21:27,940 --> 01:21:28,900
with something to go in it.

1819
01:21:28,940 --> 01:21:29,220
Yeah.

1820
01:21:30,180 --> 01:21:32,380
If it were a dive bar, you would appreciate it, but you're like, why

1821
01:21:32,380 --> 01:21:34,100
would I waste any stomach space?

1822
01:21:34,540 --> 01:21:36,940
I need as much as I can possibly get.

1823
01:21:37,180 --> 01:21:37,460
Yeah.

1824
01:21:37,460 --> 01:21:40,380
Um, uh, I have another Walt story.

1825
01:21:40,380 --> 01:21:40,740
Oh yeah.

1826
01:21:40,740 --> 01:21:40,820
Yeah.

1827
01:21:40,820 --> 01:21:41,140
Great.

1828
01:21:41,380 --> 01:21:47,300
Um, uh, this was on, uh, the same KCET article.

1829
01:21:47,820 --> 01:21:51,740
And then there was Biff's one of the early coffee shop chains, along with

1830
01:21:51,740 --> 01:21:56,140
the still extant Denny's that sprung up across California after the World War

1831
01:21:56,140 --> 01:22:00,700
two boom, according to his daughter, Walt believed that cooks at Biff's, which

1832
01:22:00,700 --> 01:22:05,540
featured the then novel exit exhibition cooking in which the chef and grill were

1833
01:22:05,540 --> 01:22:09,900
fully visible to the diners quote, did potatoes, right?

1834
01:22:10,500 --> 01:22:16,740
Uh, and then there's an anecdote that Thelma, the, um, uh, uh, Disney's

1835
01:22:16,740 --> 01:22:22,700
maid went to the coffee shop to see how they cooked potatoes so she could then

1836
01:22:23,060 --> 01:22:26,980
prepare fried potatoes, home fried potatoes in the same fashion.

1837
01:22:26,980 --> 01:22:28,180
Go learn.

1838
01:22:28,220 --> 01:22:30,660
She had to have potato tutelage.

1839
01:22:30,780 --> 01:22:31,380
It's on.

1840
01:22:31,780 --> 01:22:36,780
It is unclear whether they told her to, or whether she had that idea herself.

1841
01:22:36,780 --> 01:22:41,940
I think it was like, watch, learn, but come to potatoes.

1842
01:22:41,940 --> 01:22:44,860
What my animators are to human motion.

1843
01:22:45,260 --> 01:22:49,260
Um, let's talk drinks a little bit as you, you're a cocktail person.

1844
01:22:49,260 --> 01:22:52,220
You, we talked about at table 31, but what's your, what's the go to, what

1845
01:22:52,220 --> 01:22:52,900
do you drink when you go there?

1846
01:22:53,060 --> 01:22:56,300
Um, I will get totally sloshed on martinis.

1847
01:22:56,300 --> 01:22:59,460
It's kind of a, I think if I'm having like a lot of a, like an old school

1848
01:22:59,460 --> 01:23:01,980
beefy meal, I'll do martinis.

1849
01:23:01,980 --> 01:23:05,180
I usually always just get a martini.

1850
01:23:05,700 --> 01:23:07,220
I asked if they have blue cheese olives.

1851
01:23:07,220 --> 01:23:08,980
They don't a Tamo Shantar, which is sad.

1852
01:23:09,500 --> 01:23:11,060
Um, tragic.

1853
01:23:12,820 --> 01:23:13,980
Pick yourself up from that.

1854
01:23:14,220 --> 01:23:18,860
My go to stay guys drink would be like, uh, a martini with, with gin and I'm

1855
01:23:18,860 --> 01:23:21,700
not picky about gin, so I'll just have like well gin cause it's usually like

1856
01:23:21,700 --> 01:23:25,300
Gordon's and I like that, but Tamo Shantar sometimes I'm like, it's kind of fancy.

1857
01:23:25,300 --> 01:23:28,980
I'll have a Hendrix martini, a couple of extra bucks for a good gin.

1858
01:23:29,700 --> 01:23:31,500
And then drink them till I'm cross-eyed.

1859
01:23:33,900 --> 01:23:34,580
Yeah.

1860
01:23:34,620 --> 01:23:35,180
Hell yeah.

1861
01:23:35,340 --> 01:23:36,140
That's what you were saying.

1862
01:23:36,140 --> 01:23:37,860
This was like a hunt for you for a little bit.

1863
01:23:37,860 --> 01:23:41,380
I think if I was walkable to Tamo Shantar, I'd be in trouble.

1864
01:23:41,380 --> 01:23:43,260
I think I'd be there drinking a lot.

1865
01:23:43,260 --> 01:23:46,660
I think I would be, uh, 15 pounds heavier.

1866
01:23:47,180 --> 01:23:51,340
Like I kind of want this world a little bit, but it's probably better that I'm.

1867
01:23:51,780 --> 01:23:53,340
The bartenders are chatty and fun.

1868
01:23:53,340 --> 01:23:57,300
There's one guy who has a thick Scottish accent that I swear is fake.

1869
01:23:57,980 --> 01:24:01,420
And it's, it's easy to like, I, if I sit at the bar, like having a Guinness and

1870
01:24:01,420 --> 01:24:05,020
you kind of like, Hey, I'm a kind of a pub guy who tells you a story.

1871
01:24:05,020 --> 01:24:09,500
You get stories and jokes that everybody's like, uh, everybody's fun.

1872
01:24:09,500 --> 01:24:10,340
Oh, there's a lot of shtick.

1873
01:24:10,340 --> 01:24:15,540
Like if you, yeah, if I order a martini there, they'll say like, like when they're

1874
01:24:15,540 --> 01:24:20,100
asking like dry or dirty or whatever they've got, it's like Hemingway or

1875
01:24:20,460 --> 01:24:23,540
Churchill or whatever, like they've got a little isms there that I like.

1876
01:24:23,940 --> 01:24:24,140
Mm.

1877
01:24:25,140 --> 01:24:28,820
They usually they'll do the like, um, beer, uh, combos.

1878
01:24:28,820 --> 01:24:32,660
They'll do like a snake bite, which is usually like harp or some sort of other

1879
01:24:32,660 --> 01:24:35,620
lager and cider is a snake bite.

1880
01:24:36,180 --> 01:24:39,540
And then I don't know what, whatever they used to call black and tans,

1881
01:24:39,540 --> 01:24:40,940
which is Stout and lager.

1882
01:24:41,220 --> 01:24:41,740
Okay.

1883
01:24:42,780 --> 01:24:45,540
I feel like having a Guinness said the tam is really great.

1884
01:24:45,660 --> 01:24:45,980
Yeah.

1885
01:24:46,060 --> 01:24:46,460
Yeah.

1886
01:24:46,500 --> 01:24:48,220
I guess just location wise.

1887
01:24:48,340 --> 01:24:49,420
That again is the trouble.

1888
01:24:49,420 --> 01:24:52,620
Like truly if we were there all the time, it's not even just that you're drinking.

1889
01:24:52,620 --> 01:24:54,180
Is that you're drinking the thickest?

1890
01:24:54,180 --> 01:24:55,460
The thickest beer.

1891
01:24:55,980 --> 01:24:56,300
Yeah.

1892
01:24:56,300 --> 01:24:59,780
I mean, there's thicker it's those people probably there like Guinness

1893
01:24:59,780 --> 01:25:01,420
this bullshit corporate now.

1894
01:25:01,420 --> 01:25:05,900
Like it's not sick, but yeah, it is for people that don't drink that much beer.

1895
01:25:06,060 --> 01:25:06,420
Yeah.

1896
01:25:06,460 --> 01:25:06,740
Yeah.

1897
01:25:06,740 --> 01:25:09,180
We did go the one year for St.

1898
01:25:09,180 --> 01:25:10,140
Patty's day.

1899
01:25:10,180 --> 01:25:10,620
Oh my God.

1900
01:25:10,620 --> 01:25:14,460
It was like two o'clock in the afternoon and it was already pretty sloppy.

1901
01:25:14,460 --> 01:25:15,780
That was like the Jersey shore.

1902
01:25:15,780 --> 01:25:17,140
That was that was a Jersey show.

1903
01:25:17,220 --> 01:25:18,180
That was madness.

1904
01:25:18,220 --> 01:25:21,660
A massive tent outside parking lot.

1905
01:25:22,620 --> 01:25:26,660
It was like drink ticket buying tickets.

1906
01:25:26,980 --> 01:25:31,340
And then we, I think we had a few drinks and then eat it.

1907
01:25:31,340 --> 01:25:31,820
Meme's.

1908
01:25:31,820 --> 01:25:36,540
I remember that day I had a few drinks and I was, I think it was you and Geo were

1909
01:25:36,540 --> 01:25:39,460
there and I was like, help me set up my Tinder profile.

1910
01:25:39,460 --> 01:25:39,780
Like,

1911
01:25:41,780 --> 01:25:42,740
by the way, this is not,

1912
01:25:43,060 --> 01:25:47,220
I just spoke with Anthony Geo about your Tinder profile a few days ago.

1913
01:25:48,300 --> 01:25:50,140
How much say did you have was do it?

1914
01:25:50,140 --> 01:25:51,620
Was there a lot of punch up going on?

1915
01:25:51,620 --> 01:25:51,820
I don't know.

1916
01:25:51,820 --> 01:25:53,580
Well, I was just like, is this picture nice?

1917
01:25:53,580 --> 01:25:54,580
Do I look nice in that?

1918
01:25:54,580 --> 01:25:54,900
I don't know.

1919
01:25:54,900 --> 01:25:58,580
Just remind, because I'm in my memory, there was a night when we were setting up

1920
01:25:58,580 --> 01:26:02,020
your Tinder profile and it was the day I got the switch with the first with the

1921
01:26:02,020 --> 01:26:06,020
Zelda switch game, which is maybe the funniest, the funniest thing I've ever

1922
01:26:06,020 --> 01:26:08,500
seen is that we were doing your Tinder profile.

1923
01:26:08,500 --> 01:26:10,660
Then we started playing switch and you were like, let me try.

1924
01:26:10,860 --> 01:26:11,780
You took the game.

1925
01:26:11,820 --> 01:26:15,660
You immediately stripped all of links, clothes off his body and set his horse on

1926
01:26:15,660 --> 01:26:18,700
fire and sent the horse running.

1927
01:26:19,940 --> 01:26:21,740
We didn't know any of that was possible.

1928
01:26:22,740 --> 01:26:23,940
No, any of that was possible.

1929
01:26:24,540 --> 01:26:25,700
I have to correct you.

1930
01:26:25,740 --> 01:26:27,420
I think this was a different day.

1931
01:26:27,420 --> 01:26:28,700
It was probably two days.

1932
01:26:28,700 --> 01:26:29,660
We drove.

1933
01:26:30,140 --> 01:26:30,940
I rode with you.

1934
01:26:30,940 --> 01:26:34,140
You said, I need to go to Culver city to pick up my switch.

1935
01:26:34,180 --> 01:26:36,060
And you went to a Best Buy.

1936
01:26:36,100 --> 01:26:36,740
That's a different day.

1937
01:26:36,740 --> 01:26:40,100
And they said it's at the other Best Buy in Culver city.

1938
01:26:40,100 --> 01:26:43,180
So then we had to find a second unknown Best Buy.

1939
01:26:43,220 --> 01:26:44,180
Yes, that was confusing.

1940
01:26:44,180 --> 01:26:44,500
Yeah.

1941
01:26:45,180 --> 01:26:45,580
You're right.

1942
01:26:45,580 --> 01:26:48,620
Those are two different days, but it was just discussing your Tinder

1943
01:26:48,620 --> 01:26:50,100
profile in regards to this day.

1944
01:26:50,140 --> 01:26:53,220
I yeah, 2017 didn't have a ton going on.

1945
01:26:54,980 --> 01:26:59,900
Drinking in the day, drinking the day at Tambo Shantar, driving to multiple Best

1946
01:26:59,900 --> 01:27:00,420
Buys.

1947
01:27:00,860 --> 01:27:02,420
I have a picture of you guys.

1948
01:27:02,420 --> 01:27:05,300
Cause I think an early place we all hung out was at the bar.

1949
01:27:05,460 --> 01:27:07,900
And I have a picture of you guys at the Tam Bar.

1950
01:27:08,140 --> 01:27:11,780
And is it like a posed like, Hey, we're no, I just, I don't know why I took a

1951
01:27:11,780 --> 01:27:17,100
photo of you guys like, like going over the receipt, like figuring out the bill.

1952
01:27:17,220 --> 01:27:19,340
It's a very, like, it's a dark photo.

1953
01:27:19,340 --> 01:27:21,860
It's not a good photo, but it's the two of you.

1954
01:27:21,900 --> 01:27:23,860
Maybe it's maybe having fun at a bar.

1955
01:27:26,220 --> 01:27:28,420
I think we were both, we're trying to get points.

1956
01:27:28,420 --> 01:27:29,180
Well, that's the issue.

1957
01:27:29,180 --> 01:27:29,420
Yeah.

1958
01:27:29,420 --> 01:27:31,740
We were both arguing over who would get the bill.

1959
01:27:31,740 --> 01:27:35,580
And then when I was taking a picture of sorting out the, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1960
01:27:35,620 --> 01:27:37,060
This is pre podcast or right?

1961
01:27:37,060 --> 01:27:37,900
It's pre podcast.

1962
01:27:37,900 --> 01:27:40,820
And then I really specifically remember we talked about this when you were gone,

1963
01:27:40,820 --> 01:27:45,980
Mike, that when we did an episode without you, that Jason left early and then you,

1964
01:27:45,980 --> 01:27:49,060
we stood by the door and you were talking for a while about, I'm telling you,

1965
01:27:49,060 --> 01:27:51,420
we got to figure out a project with this guy, Jason.

1966
01:27:51,660 --> 01:27:55,340
Jason is incredibly did this and he did that and he did this and that.

1967
01:27:55,460 --> 01:27:57,580
And you told Jason's story after Jason's story.

1968
01:27:57,580 --> 01:28:02,140
Kind of was like the Pixar lunch where the kind of the podcast grew out of that

1969
01:28:02,140 --> 01:28:02,980
experience.

1970
01:28:03,340 --> 01:28:04,180
That's like a wall.

1971
01:28:04,180 --> 01:28:05,180
I'm kind of like Walt.

1972
01:28:05,180 --> 01:28:05,580
Walt.

1973
01:28:05,580 --> 01:28:06,460
Yeah, sure.

1974
01:28:07,500 --> 01:28:09,780
Dreaming up characters like Jason.

1975
01:28:09,860 --> 01:28:10,860
Jason's my Mickey.

1976
01:28:13,300 --> 01:28:15,060
Jason, the lucky man.

1977
01:28:18,620 --> 01:28:20,300
He's more of the stinker version of Mickey's.

1978
01:28:20,300 --> 01:28:21,660
Yeah, I'd say so.

1979
01:28:21,660 --> 01:28:23,420
Well, I don't know the anxious too, though.

1980
01:28:23,420 --> 01:28:23,700
Yeah.

1981
01:28:26,100 --> 01:28:26,900
Rest in anxious.

1982
01:28:26,900 --> 01:28:27,660
And current Mickey.

1983
01:28:27,660 --> 01:28:33,900
Weird that people work in the animation industry might project some neurotic qualities onto a character.

1984
01:28:33,900 --> 01:28:34,300
Sure.

1985
01:28:34,300 --> 01:28:36,220
It's surprising.

1986
01:28:36,940 --> 01:28:40,220
And with that, with dreaming up these little ideas, that's another thing.

1987
01:28:40,220 --> 01:28:44,140
If you sit at the table 31, you can see if you look closely, you can see little etchings.

1988
01:28:44,140 --> 01:28:47,980
Like people drew dinosaurs on the table.

1989
01:28:48,340 --> 01:28:57,380
Was that them dreaming up the world's fair dinosaurs or were these dinosaurs drawn six years ago by somebody we know?

1990
01:28:57,380 --> 01:28:58,660
By Mookie or something.

1991
01:28:58,660 --> 01:28:58,860
Yeah.

1992
01:28:59,420 --> 01:29:00,220
I don't know that.

1993
01:29:00,900 --> 01:29:02,820
But did you say Mookie?

1994
01:29:02,820 --> 01:29:03,100
Yeah.

1995
01:29:03,380 --> 01:29:07,220
I went to the Tamar Shedder for Mookie's dad's 70th birthday.

1996
01:29:07,220 --> 01:29:07,980
Wow.

1997
01:29:07,980 --> 01:29:09,340
That must have been why that was in my head.

1998
01:29:09,340 --> 01:29:10,220
Yeah, you didn't say.

1999
01:29:10,220 --> 01:29:11,180
Yeah, you were saying it's a good.

2000
01:29:11,180 --> 01:29:11,580
He loves it.

2001
01:29:11,580 --> 01:29:14,740
But it was a perfect talk about perfect parent dinner.

2002
01:29:14,740 --> 01:29:16,060
They hadn't been there before.

2003
01:29:16,060 --> 01:29:19,300
He was in town to see Steely Dan at the Bowl for his 70th birthday.

2004
01:29:19,300 --> 01:29:19,500
Yeah.

2005
01:29:19,500 --> 01:29:20,900
What a tam and then Steely Dan.

2006
01:29:20,900 --> 01:29:21,780
Tam and the Bowl.

2007
01:29:21,780 --> 01:29:22,980
Talk about the LA night.

2008
01:29:22,980 --> 01:29:23,100
What was I?

2009
01:29:23,100 --> 01:29:23,780
What was I there?

2010
01:29:23,780 --> 01:29:24,860
For a boomer dad.

2011
01:29:24,860 --> 01:29:25,500
What a night.

2012
01:29:25,500 --> 01:29:27,700
Or for a non-boomer.

2013
01:29:27,700 --> 01:29:28,060
Yeah.

2014
01:29:28,060 --> 01:29:30,260
Or a millennial bad boy friend.

2015
01:29:31,260 --> 01:29:34,260
That's a nice thing about the Tamar Shedder.

2016
01:29:34,260 --> 01:29:37,820
Lots of very, very solid flavorful food items.

2017
01:29:37,820 --> 01:29:40,980
But if you are bringing a parent who doesn't have an exciting,

2018
01:29:40,980 --> 01:29:43,220
like a advanced palette or anything,

2019
01:29:43,220 --> 01:29:47,220
plenty of very plain unseasoned items at your disposal as well.

2020
01:29:47,220 --> 01:29:49,940
Dad is going to be fine as he eats a tam.

2021
01:29:49,940 --> 01:29:53,220
This was seasoned with butter and salt and nothing else.

2022
01:29:53,220 --> 01:29:53,700
I feel that.

2023
01:29:53,700 --> 01:29:56,300
But the mac and cheese is sort of like these days,

2024
01:29:56,300 --> 01:29:59,300
there's a lot of hip mac and cheese that are got the Gruyere going on.

2025
01:29:59,300 --> 01:30:00,540
Not that mac and cheese.

2026
01:30:00,540 --> 01:30:01,060
No.

2027
01:30:01,060 --> 01:30:02,060
No.

2028
01:30:02,060 --> 01:30:03,220
So, so basic.

2029
01:30:03,220 --> 01:30:03,980
He loved it.

2030
01:30:03,980 --> 01:30:06,980
It was very special to be there with him.

2031
01:30:06,980 --> 01:30:08,780
And a lot of pebbles for him to play with.

2032
01:30:08,780 --> 01:30:09,980
So that's important.

2033
01:30:09,980 --> 01:30:10,540
Well, that's good.

2034
01:30:10,540 --> 01:30:12,020
Pebbles.

2035
01:30:12,020 --> 01:30:13,460
They have the best pebbles around there.

2036
01:30:13,460 --> 01:30:15,820
Truly the finest pebbles in town.

2037
01:30:15,820 --> 01:30:18,860
They're not fruity pebbles, but they're pretty good.

2038
01:30:18,860 --> 01:30:19,740
Close.

2039
01:30:19,740 --> 01:30:20,260
Yeah.

2040
01:30:20,260 --> 01:30:20,780
Yeah.

2041
01:30:20,780 --> 01:30:23,340
Inedible pebbles, yes.

2042
01:30:23,340 --> 01:30:25,420
I was just going to say, this place, there's

2043
01:30:25,420 --> 01:30:28,020
a lot of places when you get to LA, you get very excited

2044
01:30:28,020 --> 01:30:29,980
because they've been around for a while.

2045
01:30:29,980 --> 01:30:33,500
There's a place called the Smokehouse, not too far from here,

2046
01:30:33,500 --> 01:30:35,420
that I feel like is great.

2047
01:30:35,420 --> 01:30:39,500
But Tam, I feel like, is one of the better places that has held up

2048
01:30:39,500 --> 01:30:41,860
over the years as far as food wise.

2049
01:30:41,860 --> 01:30:43,940
You can go pretty wrong with food at Smokehouse.

2050
01:30:43,940 --> 01:30:45,580
You can get that incorrect, for sure.

2051
01:30:45,580 --> 01:30:48,300
I love Smokehouse and I love so many restaurants like that where

2052
01:30:48,300 --> 01:30:50,020
you have to be on board for the kitch.

2053
01:30:50,020 --> 01:30:51,940
So I know me and Jesse are going to like it,

2054
01:30:51,940 --> 01:30:57,660
but I'd be afraid to bring friends that don't want to laugh at their food.

2055
01:30:57,660 --> 01:31:04,340
Tam O'Shanter is historic and the food is still high quality food.

2056
01:31:04,340 --> 01:31:05,700
It's still around for a reason.

2057
01:31:05,700 --> 01:31:07,940
It's not like it's just waiting to close down.

2058
01:31:07,940 --> 01:31:08,620
Yeah.

2059
01:31:08,620 --> 01:31:09,140
Yeah.

2060
01:31:09,140 --> 01:31:11,060
It's not like we're keeping up the tradition

2061
01:31:11,060 --> 01:31:12,460
because we feel like we have to.

2062
01:31:12,460 --> 01:31:13,940
We feel bad.

2063
01:31:13,940 --> 01:31:14,780
People want it.

2064
01:31:14,780 --> 01:31:15,540
We love it.

2065
01:31:15,540 --> 01:31:21,340
That family owned thing, I think it is the oldest restaurant in LA

2066
01:31:21,340 --> 01:31:24,020
is Musso and Frank's, but they've changed ownership.

2067
01:31:24,020 --> 01:31:29,580
So Tam might be the second or no El Cholo, the Mexican place is old,

2068
01:31:29,580 --> 01:31:31,620
but it's moved locations.

2069
01:31:31,620 --> 01:31:33,700
OK, this is the spot.

2070
01:31:33,700 --> 01:31:39,060
I think that Tam O'Shanter is the 100 years of still that original family

2071
01:31:39,060 --> 01:31:41,900
is still involved in ownership and it's the only place like that.

2072
01:31:41,900 --> 01:31:44,420
They survived Prohibition.

2073
01:31:44,420 --> 01:31:45,460
They had to get that long.

2074
01:31:45,460 --> 01:31:46,220
It's been around.

2075
01:31:46,220 --> 01:31:51,860
There's photos on the wall of like celebrating that Prohibition is over.

2076
01:31:51,860 --> 01:31:52,940
Right.

2077
01:31:52,940 --> 01:31:53,820
They survived.

2078
01:31:53,820 --> 01:31:56,260
I did take out once, too, during quarantine.

2079
01:31:59,580 --> 01:32:01,980
The funny story.

2080
01:32:01,980 --> 01:32:04,580
Well, I learned some other facts about the Tam O'Shanter

2081
01:32:04,580 --> 01:32:08,620
because Jane used to briefly work there as a waiter.

2082
01:32:08,620 --> 01:32:11,260
And will this ruin it?

2083
01:32:11,260 --> 01:32:14,900
Are we going to find out what's really in everything?

2084
01:32:14,900 --> 01:32:19,220
There is, I think, unofficially a John Wayne table as well.

2085
01:32:19,220 --> 01:32:20,100
I've heard this. Yes.

2086
01:32:20,100 --> 01:32:20,620
Yeah.

2087
01:32:20,860 --> 01:32:23,540
Table 15 in the tartan room.

2088
01:32:23,540 --> 01:32:23,940
Yes.

2089
01:32:23,940 --> 01:32:29,180
They only let people with the best opinions have tables at Tam.

2090
01:32:29,180 --> 01:32:33,180
The other thing she was like, you know, that on the top floor,

2091
01:32:33,180 --> 01:32:36,340
there's men's and women's locker rooms so they can get changed

2092
01:32:36,340 --> 01:32:39,900
into those goofy tartan clothes.

2093
01:32:39,900 --> 01:32:40,700
Wow.

2094
01:32:40,700 --> 01:32:43,940
Oh, and this is a big thing we've missed in terms of the Disney connection

2095
01:32:43,940 --> 01:32:48,940
is it is it's all tartans and plaid, Scottish inspired uniforms.

2096
01:32:48,940 --> 01:32:53,380
And that is the uniforms still of the tour guides at Disneyland.

2097
01:32:53,380 --> 01:32:55,780
So it might have pretty directly come from that.

2098
01:32:55,780 --> 01:33:01,420
He wanted Walt wanted to humiliate people and put fuzzy fuzzy puffs

2099
01:33:01,420 --> 01:33:02,580
on their hats. He loved.

2100
01:33:02,580 --> 01:33:06,140
They should just do they should have a primary restaurant there.

2101
01:33:06,380 --> 01:33:09,460
Wouldn't it fit well with like Blue Bayou and stuff?

2102
01:33:09,460 --> 01:33:12,260
If there was also just like a Scottish primary,

2103
01:33:12,580 --> 01:33:14,660
there should be more good restaurants at the park.

2104
01:33:14,660 --> 01:33:17,820
If you could, they made the Fantasyland restaurant

2105
01:33:17,820 --> 01:33:21,220
a little better than it was as this guest on restaurant.

2106
01:33:21,980 --> 01:33:24,460
But I was I was sitting there last night thinking like,

2107
01:33:24,820 --> 01:33:29,740
boy, what we accept as theme park food and say, actually, that was pretty good

2108
01:33:29,740 --> 01:33:34,100
as opposed to the quality here where you're in a storybook environment.

2109
01:33:34,100 --> 01:33:35,340
It is themed.

2110
01:33:35,340 --> 01:33:37,620
And the food's excellent and the drinks are excellent.

2111
01:33:37,620 --> 01:33:41,900
Like, boy, if only you could plop Tamoshanter or something of its quality

2112
01:33:41,900 --> 01:33:43,020
right into Fantasyland.

2113
01:33:43,020 --> 01:33:45,740
You guys have favorite Disneyland foods that I'm missing.

2114
01:33:45,940 --> 01:33:49,700
I always eat a turkey leg and I think it's bad, but I always look around.

2115
01:33:49,700 --> 01:33:51,220
It's just been all day looking for it.

2116
01:33:51,220 --> 01:33:54,500
And then I eat it and I'm like, yeah, I forget every time.

2117
01:33:54,540 --> 01:33:57,900
I always recommend the Plaza Inn.

2118
01:33:58,340 --> 01:34:01,580
I think it's a Plaza Inn now at the end of Main Street.

2119
01:34:01,580 --> 01:34:05,260
There's like a cafeteria style restaurant that does really good fried chicken.

2120
01:34:05,260 --> 01:34:07,060
And you can kind of smell it outside.

2121
01:34:07,060 --> 01:34:10,940
OK, that that did at one point in time was like a local

2122
01:34:11,900 --> 01:34:15,260
kind of steakhouse family restaurant, not too dissimilar.

2123
01:34:15,260 --> 01:34:19,300
But I think that changed within the first six or seven years of Disneyland.

2124
01:34:19,340 --> 01:34:21,140
Oh, like somebody else owned it. Yeah.

2125
01:34:21,140 --> 01:34:23,300
Yeah. What else is the Star Wars hot dog?

2126
01:34:23,300 --> 01:34:26,020
The Ronto wrap like the Ronto is really good.

2127
01:34:26,100 --> 01:34:28,980
Oh, is it is a wrap all the way around the hot dog?

2128
01:34:29,300 --> 01:34:32,260
Pretty close. There's a slaw.

2129
01:34:32,260 --> 01:34:34,220
Well, does it have something Star Warsy about it?

2130
01:34:34,220 --> 01:34:36,940
Yeah. Well, it's just got a sauce that's a little spicy.

2131
01:34:36,940 --> 01:34:38,860
It's on a pita. It's on a pita.

2132
01:34:38,860 --> 01:34:41,260
Something in like Cars Land that was in a cone.

2133
01:34:41,460 --> 01:34:42,580
Oh, yeah. Chili.

2134
01:34:42,620 --> 01:34:43,860
Many options in a cone.

2135
01:34:43,860 --> 01:34:46,700
Chili. There's a whole mac and cheese in the cones.

2136
01:34:46,940 --> 01:34:47,500
Yeah.

2137
01:34:47,500 --> 01:34:47,900
Mm hmm.

2138
01:34:47,900 --> 01:34:48,740
All right.

2139
01:34:48,740 --> 01:34:52,100
Trader Sam's food stepping it up to like they have riskier.

2140
01:34:52,100 --> 01:34:54,140
They have poke and you've got it.

2141
01:34:54,140 --> 01:34:54,940
I'm in there. Right.

2142
01:34:54,940 --> 01:34:56,260
And I had I never have.

2143
01:34:56,260 --> 01:34:57,580
Oh, way. This is crazy.

2144
01:34:57,580 --> 01:34:59,100
I'm a Tiki head. I love it.

2145
01:34:59,100 --> 01:35:00,180
But I'm not.

2146
01:35:00,180 --> 01:35:01,140
And that's the thing you say.

2147
01:35:01,140 --> 01:35:03,740
I think it is a pretty legit Tiki bar.

2148
01:35:03,780 --> 01:35:05,100
We talked about a while back.

2149
01:35:05,100 --> 01:35:07,820
And yeah, it's not just a theme park impression of one.

2150
01:35:08,140 --> 01:35:10,140
Like it feels lived in a drink.

2151
01:35:10,140 --> 01:35:12,020
They're solid. That's what you're like.

2152
01:35:12,020 --> 01:35:14,980
They have some or it's not that it's and it's not like water.

2153
01:35:15,140 --> 01:35:19,100
I feel like I had a Tiki esque drink at the Grand California in one time,

2154
01:35:19,100 --> 01:35:22,580
but I had like a light up ice cube in it and it was like the drink was just very

2155
01:35:22,580 --> 01:35:24,420
sweet and not too boozy.

2156
01:35:24,660 --> 01:35:27,420
Yeah. What is your theme park drinking luck bin?

2157
01:35:27,420 --> 01:35:31,020
Are you judging it harder if you had stuff for you struck out?

2158
01:35:31,060 --> 01:35:33,580
I mean, I I feel like I've gotten.

2159
01:35:34,580 --> 01:35:39,700
Shit has drunk at the the Carl Strauss beer cart in California Adventure.

2160
01:35:39,740 --> 01:35:41,420
Yes. Yeah. Oh, boy.

2161
01:35:41,420 --> 01:35:42,620
I remember I like walking around.

2162
01:35:42,620 --> 01:35:46,260
I feel like this Disneyland doesn't have too much booze or.

2163
01:35:46,260 --> 01:35:51,380
They've only barely started to in Star Wars and the Blue Bayou now, but that's it.

2164
01:35:51,740 --> 01:35:55,100
I feel like, yeah, I haven't been there in a long time.

2165
01:35:55,100 --> 01:35:56,380
And when I was there, I couldn't find any booze.

2166
01:35:56,380 --> 01:35:59,780
So then I went to like the little wine tasting place in California Adventure.

2167
01:36:00,460 --> 01:36:02,500
And that was a little bit fun.

2168
01:36:02,500 --> 01:36:05,060
But then just pounded beers at that little cart.

2169
01:36:05,180 --> 01:36:09,300
They sell Walt's scotch mist at the Carthy Circle restaurant.

2170
01:36:09,500 --> 01:36:10,500
This I have to do.

2171
01:36:10,500 --> 01:36:13,860
I've piqued my head in Carthy Circle, but didn't have time to like settle in

2172
01:36:13,860 --> 01:36:15,060
for a cocktail night.

2173
01:36:15,060 --> 01:36:16,980
Yeah, you can do because you can just do the bar.

2174
01:36:16,980 --> 01:36:18,020
What's that's our favorite.

2175
01:36:18,020 --> 01:36:20,380
Well, we like the restaurant, too, but the bar and then we like the

2176
01:36:20,380 --> 01:36:22,100
Manhattans as well.

2177
01:36:22,100 --> 01:36:24,100
Yeah, we'll build those for you.

2178
01:36:24,100 --> 01:36:25,540
Maybe too much. Yeah.

2179
01:36:25,540 --> 01:36:27,540
Give those a shot. That might be our favorite.

2180
01:36:27,540 --> 01:36:28,460
Yeah, out there.

2181
01:36:28,460 --> 01:36:31,020
I think the scotch mist at the Carthy Circle.

2182
01:36:31,020 --> 01:36:34,580
I think they have like I think it just says scotch now.

2183
01:36:35,100 --> 01:36:37,700
I don't know how easy it is to get black and white scotch.

2184
01:36:37,700 --> 01:36:38,820
It's a brand of scotch.

2185
01:36:38,820 --> 01:36:40,020
Did they take Walt's name off of it?

2186
01:36:40,020 --> 01:36:41,300
It just tastes like Johnny Walker black.

2187
01:36:41,300 --> 01:36:43,540
Is Walt's name still on it?

2188
01:36:43,540 --> 01:36:44,780
I don't know.

2189
01:36:44,780 --> 01:36:47,860
Because for a while we were like, really, they're admitting that Walt drank.

2190
01:36:48,100 --> 01:36:49,140
Yeah. Yeah.

2191
01:36:49,140 --> 01:36:51,100
So I forget if maybe they still there.

2192
01:36:51,100 --> 01:36:54,700
I just say scotch mist and it may be in the, you know, like a way.

2193
01:36:54,700 --> 01:36:55,420
There's like a car.

2194
01:36:55,420 --> 01:36:57,820
There's like a character winking at you, like, you know, who's

2195
01:36:58,660 --> 01:37:00,860
you know, a certain guy.

2196
01:37:00,860 --> 01:37:04,340
It does. If you go there, look at some of the pictures on the walls

2197
01:37:04,580 --> 01:37:08,500
and see Walt just doing like his hand, like the two fingers.

2198
01:37:08,500 --> 01:37:11,620
And at first I thought that was the two finger point.

2199
01:37:11,620 --> 01:37:14,940
And then people online were like, no, those are pictures

2200
01:37:14,940 --> 01:37:18,220
where he was holding a cigarette and they Photoshopped the cigarette out

2201
01:37:18,220 --> 01:37:20,420
and then printed the picture to hang up.

2202
01:37:20,420 --> 01:37:21,980
Damn. Yeah. Unbelievable.

2203
01:37:21,980 --> 01:37:24,500
That means I just complain about them getting rid of a Krusty

2204
01:37:24,500 --> 01:37:26,620
the clown toy that had a cigarette.

2205
01:37:26,620 --> 01:37:27,580
It drives me nuts.

2206
01:37:27,580 --> 01:37:30,940
I love that the idea of a toy having a cigarette is so funny.

2207
01:37:30,940 --> 01:37:33,980
Mr. Teeny had the cigarette, too, and I was going to buy this toy.

2208
01:37:33,980 --> 01:37:34,860
And I was so excited.

2209
01:37:34,860 --> 01:37:37,580
And then they're like, oh, by the way, everyone, there's an update on the toy.

2210
01:37:37,580 --> 01:37:39,260
And then the cigarettes were gone.

2211
01:37:39,260 --> 01:37:40,820
That's the whole point. Yeah.

2212
01:37:40,820 --> 01:37:43,500
Tisk, tisk, tisk, tisk.

2213
01:37:43,500 --> 01:37:46,100
That's what's the story episode about cigarettes sometimes.

2214
01:37:46,100 --> 01:37:48,100
All right. Yeah.

2215
01:37:48,100 --> 01:37:49,620
Bluffing on it.

2216
01:37:49,620 --> 01:37:51,140
Uh, we've been going for a while.

2217
01:37:51,140 --> 01:37:52,340
We should wind it down.

2218
01:37:52,340 --> 01:37:55,460
But like, you know, one thing we haven't brought up yet, the ghosts.

2219
01:37:55,820 --> 01:37:56,660
I don't know about the ghost.

2220
01:37:56,660 --> 01:38:00,300
Oh, this place is like haunted or like rumored to be haunted.

2221
01:38:01,340 --> 01:38:02,580
There's a few nervous.

2222
01:38:02,580 --> 01:38:05,740
Oh, we were having a nice time.

2223
01:38:05,740 --> 01:38:07,180
There's a few on counts online.

2224
01:38:07,180 --> 01:38:12,100
I found an old blog from a group called the Ghost Hunters of Urban Los Angeles.

2225
01:38:14,260 --> 01:38:18,300
The one is that there's a little boy who has, you know, achieved the nickname

2226
01:38:18,300 --> 01:38:23,820
Charlie because he looks just like the painting of the Bonnie Prince

2227
01:38:23,820 --> 01:38:25,980
Charlie that hangs in the one dining room.

2228
01:38:25,980 --> 01:38:31,140
OK. Another thing I do to me, is he going to grab my butter knife

2229
01:38:31,140 --> 01:38:32,820
and try to scratch me up?

2230
01:38:32,820 --> 01:38:35,100
I don't know. It doesn't say what Charlie does.

2231
01:38:35,820 --> 01:38:38,380
I don't. I think it's just like they list their power.

2232
01:38:38,540 --> 01:38:41,900
Ghost hunters list those powers so I know how to fight.

2233
01:38:42,020 --> 01:38:43,020
Can he walk through the walls?

2234
01:38:43,020 --> 01:38:45,180
I guess he has to be able to do that.

2235
01:38:45,180 --> 01:38:49,540
A waiter told us confidentially that many elderly patrons have died in the restaurant.

2236
01:38:49,540 --> 01:38:51,420
Well, wait a minute.

2237
01:38:51,420 --> 01:38:53,700
Many, many.

2238
01:38:53,700 --> 01:38:59,900
I mean, if you're older and you're housing a bone in prime rib, like I would say.

2239
01:38:59,900 --> 01:39:03,220
We get an old person that kicks once a week in this place.

2240
01:39:03,780 --> 01:39:06,420
Walt played polo with people in there.

2241
01:39:06,420 --> 01:39:08,780
Can I take the tartan room, bring a couple of horses in?

2242
01:39:09,380 --> 01:39:12,740
A busboy claims to have seen a man in a mask

2243
01:39:13,140 --> 01:39:17,220
walking in the upstairs hall outside the restaurant's office.

2244
01:39:17,220 --> 01:39:20,100
The prevailing theory is that he might have been a burglar

2245
01:39:20,100 --> 01:39:25,420
and perhaps is connected to the fire that may have claimed other lives.

2246
01:39:26,460 --> 01:39:28,140
I think maybe whatever was here before.

2247
01:39:28,140 --> 01:39:32,380
I mean, I'd say, yeah, if I see a guy in a mask, maybe I mean, now it's just anybody.

2248
01:39:32,380 --> 01:39:35,660
But at that time, probably I'd say burglar before I'd say ghost.

2249
01:39:35,980 --> 01:39:38,060
Yeah, I was a ghost of a man.

2250
01:39:38,060 --> 01:39:40,060
It was a ghost of a burglar, a ghost of a girl.

2251
01:39:40,060 --> 01:39:41,020
Well, that's scary.

2252
01:39:41,020 --> 01:39:42,860
So he had like a ski mask or something.

2253
01:39:42,860 --> 01:39:44,260
He wasn't always a burglar.

2254
01:39:44,260 --> 01:39:45,260
He lived his whole life.

2255
01:39:45,260 --> 01:39:46,420
And then sometimes he burned.

2256
01:39:46,420 --> 01:39:49,780
No, no, no. If you burgle, you get stuck in the limbo.

2257
01:39:49,780 --> 01:39:52,660
Damn. Where is Scarlet Mask forever?

2258
01:39:52,660 --> 01:39:55,420
John Wayne shot him when he saw he was robbing the place.

2259
01:39:57,500 --> 01:39:58,900
And then I read a really long

2260
01:39:58,900 --> 01:40:01,420
reddit post where someone's like, I worked at the TAMO, Shanter.

2261
01:40:01,420 --> 01:40:05,580
And a couple of times I've like felt like I was getting very dizzy.

2262
01:40:05,580 --> 01:40:09,660
And then one time the worker felt that these are a little weak.

2263
01:40:09,660 --> 01:40:10,780
I'm going to be honest.

2264
01:40:10,780 --> 01:40:13,980
Yeah. A lot of these stories are those sound like, well,

2265
01:40:13,980 --> 01:40:17,140
was the person hammered and they just saw the picture blur?

2266
01:40:18,500 --> 01:40:20,860
So I was hanging out with him and I felt kind of woozy.

2267
01:40:21,860 --> 01:40:23,340
I felt a warm feeling.

2268
01:40:23,340 --> 01:40:25,420
Must be a ghost. Give me a hug from behind.

2269
01:40:25,700 --> 01:40:29,980
A bunch of people from the past were floating around singing Christmas carols.

2270
01:40:30,220 --> 01:40:33,020
Only one explanation.

2271
01:40:33,020 --> 01:40:34,460
So I don't know, take what you will.

2272
01:40:34,460 --> 01:40:36,500
A hundred year old place in Los Angeles.

2273
01:40:36,500 --> 01:40:39,260
I'm willing to give it the better doubt that may be a little spooky.

2274
01:40:39,540 --> 01:40:41,340
There's some ghosts. I don't doubt there's ghosts.

2275
01:40:41,340 --> 01:40:43,860
I just don't know these stories specifically.

2276
01:40:43,860 --> 01:40:49,060
Yeah. The whole like Los Feliz was owned by and like Griffith Park

2277
01:40:49,060 --> 01:40:50,660
was owned by Griffith J.

2278
01:40:50,660 --> 01:40:53,620
Griffith. And then like after shooting his wife in the face

2279
01:40:53,620 --> 01:40:58,380
and having some bad PR when he was trying to like re make people like him again.

2280
01:40:58,860 --> 01:41:04,420
You know that? Well, he was at like the Casa del Mar in Santa Monica, I think.

2281
01:41:04,420 --> 01:41:06,460
And he shot his wife in the face.

2282
01:41:06,460 --> 01:41:10,940
She jumped out the window, bounced on the awning and lived and divorced him.

2283
01:41:10,980 --> 01:41:15,460
Jesus. And like and like got a divorce in the days where that was like, wow.

2284
01:41:15,460 --> 01:41:18,540
Things would have been stacked against the lady, but she had a facial gunshot.

2285
01:41:18,540 --> 01:41:20,380
She didn't get him put in jail.

2286
01:41:20,380 --> 01:41:23,620
Yeah. No, she was like, got him. He got a slap on the wrist.

2287
01:41:24,660 --> 01:41:27,060
He was insanely wealthy, I believe,

2288
01:41:27,060 --> 01:41:29,460
is part of part of the reason he got a slap on the wrist.

2289
01:41:29,460 --> 01:41:34,260
But yeah, I mean, I have to thank her lawyers like, well, OK, that's exhibit A.

2290
01:41:34,980 --> 01:41:36,500
We don't need any other exhibits.

2291
01:41:36,500 --> 01:41:41,460
I mean, you know, but during I guess like apology tour of like

2292
01:41:42,140 --> 01:41:46,460
doing things for the city, I think because he just gave Griffith Park

2293
01:41:46,460 --> 01:41:50,340
to the city and it's like it's like the largest park in a city.

2294
01:41:50,340 --> 01:41:51,540
It's bigger than Central Park.

2295
01:41:51,540 --> 01:41:55,020
It's like the biggest park that is like in within a city,

2296
01:41:55,300 --> 01:41:58,700
like as opposed to like a, you know, national park that you go to.

2297
01:41:58,700 --> 01:41:59,940
But it's like in a city.

2298
01:41:59,940 --> 01:42:02,340
And he just gave it and he gave a lot of stuff.

2299
01:42:02,340 --> 01:42:06,980
And he later said, like, I that land was haunted.

2300
01:42:07,020 --> 01:42:08,740
I didn't I didn't like that.

2301
01:42:08,740 --> 01:42:09,940
I was like trying to get rid of it.

2302
01:42:09,940 --> 01:42:13,900
So all of like Los Feliz like and going down to like Tamashita,

2303
01:42:13,900 --> 01:42:16,700
that is like the part of town that I've heard that he was like,

2304
01:42:17,020 --> 01:42:18,180
I didn't want that land.

2305
01:42:18,180 --> 01:42:23,500
Geez. Wow. I've tried to pawn it on to us, onto the general population forever.

2306
01:42:23,540 --> 01:42:26,340
There's a mayor like I think it's a Mark Maron episode with Paul Thomas

2307
01:42:26,340 --> 01:42:28,620
Anderson where they're talking about Los Feliz being haunted.

2308
01:42:28,660 --> 01:42:30,060
Yeah. Yeah. So there is.

2309
01:42:30,060 --> 01:42:31,420
He was like, I would never live there.

2310
01:42:31,420 --> 01:42:33,100
I love L.A., but I would never live in Los Feliz.

2311
01:42:33,100 --> 01:42:37,460
Oh, yeah. I mean, the Hollywood sign, the most like, yeah.

2312
01:42:37,460 --> 01:42:42,140
Right. Is that who the Jaws house, this the Soudan house on Franklin,

2313
01:42:42,140 --> 01:42:44,220
I think they were recently like sniffing.

2314
01:42:44,540 --> 01:42:48,380
They had like FBI dogs sniffing for black Dahlia's bones, like in the last.

2315
01:42:49,060 --> 01:42:50,340
Thank God.

2316
01:42:50,340 --> 01:42:52,380
I mean, the other old restaurants in L.A.

2317
01:42:52,380 --> 01:42:56,540
like El Coyote heading west in the city,

2318
01:42:57,060 --> 01:43:02,100
famously the last meal of Sharon Tate before the gruesome Manson murder.

2319
01:43:02,220 --> 01:43:04,540
Yeah. Yeah. There's weird, weird stuff.

2320
01:43:04,540 --> 01:43:08,300
And the last meal on the others at Casa Vega, the last meal

2321
01:43:08,300 --> 01:43:11,460
those two guys had before they had to kill all those people.

2322
01:43:11,780 --> 01:43:13,460
The two real guys.

2323
01:43:13,460 --> 01:43:15,140
I love that place. Casa Vega.

2324
01:43:15,140 --> 01:43:16,420
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

2325
01:43:16,420 --> 01:43:19,020
It's Casa Vega where I saw Brent Spiner right before the pandemic.

2326
01:43:19,180 --> 01:43:21,460
I can't remember. Is that a way to is that the one of Ventura?

2327
01:43:21,460 --> 01:43:22,380
It's an adventure. Yeah.

2328
01:43:22,380 --> 01:43:23,900
Yeah. So I saw Brent Spiner there

2329
01:43:23,900 --> 01:43:27,380
the weeks before Covid and I was thrilled he's leaving.

2330
01:43:27,380 --> 01:43:28,620
And I was like, he looks great.

2331
01:43:28,620 --> 01:43:31,660
It's going to be it's going to be a great year.

2332
01:43:31,660 --> 01:43:33,580
And it's only going up here.

2333
01:43:35,020 --> 01:43:36,300
Any other details about this place?

2334
01:43:36,300 --> 01:43:37,340
You want you want to get out?

2335
01:43:37,340 --> 01:43:40,860
It's it's it's it's so nice to I got I got what I'm dying to say.

2336
01:43:40,860 --> 01:43:41,540
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

2337
01:43:41,540 --> 01:43:46,100
Name Tamo Shantar is both a poem by Robert Burns, but we don't care about that.

2338
01:43:46,140 --> 01:43:49,100
It's also the name of the traditional Scottish cap from the 19th century,

2339
01:43:49,300 --> 01:43:52,740
the very same one that Mary Tyler Moore throws up in the opening of her show.

2340
01:43:52,740 --> 01:43:54,380
Oh, my God.

2341
01:43:54,380 --> 01:43:56,620
Oh, that's a Tamo Shantar.

2342
01:43:56,620 --> 01:43:59,340
Mary Tyler Moore was wearing a Tamo Shantar. Wow.

2343
01:43:59,340 --> 01:44:01,900
And threw it triumphantly in the start of her show. Wow.

2344
01:44:02,380 --> 01:44:04,900
Does it is like Shantar, a Scottish version,

2345
01:44:04,900 --> 01:44:07,740
and like Tam is like the hat of Shantar or something like that.

2346
01:44:08,140 --> 01:44:09,540
I don't know the direct translation.

2347
01:44:09,540 --> 01:44:11,260
Shantar is the guy here.

2348
01:44:11,260 --> 01:44:13,500
Let me let me really quickly let me Cliff notes this.

2349
01:44:13,500 --> 01:44:17,940
I if you can imagine, I couldn't read a long poem that is in dense Scottish

2350
01:44:17,940 --> 01:44:20,980
where every other word I've never seen before in my life.

2351
01:44:21,180 --> 01:44:22,140
But I was trying to figure it out.

2352
01:44:22,140 --> 01:44:23,980
And Tamo Shantar is the main character of it.

2353
01:44:23,980 --> 01:44:27,860
He is a guy who gets drunk at a bar a lot while his wife sits at home mad.

2354
01:44:28,780 --> 01:44:35,500
So he leaves a bar drunk and he's he's he's heading home

2355
01:44:35,500 --> 01:44:40,660
and then he sees a church and some witches are having a party with the devil

2356
01:44:40,980 --> 01:44:45,620
in the church and he is checking it out and he sees that one of the witches

2357
01:44:45,620 --> 01:44:49,420
is taking off their clothes and he's trying to sneak a peek at a naked witch.

2358
01:44:49,660 --> 01:44:51,860
And then he gets caught doing so.

2359
01:44:51,860 --> 01:44:55,460
So they start chasing him and he gets on his horse and runs away.

2360
01:44:56,260 --> 01:45:01,820
And but luckily, remember, witches and the devil can't cross over water

2361
01:45:02,140 --> 01:45:04,460
like hoverboards and Becks the Future 2.

2362
01:45:04,460 --> 01:45:07,540
Right. So the chase didn't where he made it over the river barely.

2363
01:45:07,540 --> 01:45:12,860
But just barely because a witch pulled his horse's tail off.

2364
01:45:13,260 --> 01:45:14,580
And that's the story.

2365
01:45:14,580 --> 01:45:17,420
Much like Jason in playing Zelda.

2366
01:45:17,940 --> 01:45:21,220
Do it to a horse, a scurrying horse.

2367
01:45:21,420 --> 01:45:24,460
Same thing. Basically, there'll be an epic poem about that one day.

2368
01:45:25,940 --> 01:45:28,620
So just picture all that when you're there next.

2369
01:45:28,660 --> 01:45:34,060
It's Mary Tyler Moore and it's a drunken man being chased by the devil.

2370
01:45:34,060 --> 01:45:36,540
There was a witch involved that was he wanted to see the naked witch.

2371
01:45:36,540 --> 01:45:37,220
Is that right? Yeah.

2372
01:45:37,260 --> 01:45:41,260
Witch took off most of her clothes and he's like, oh, not so bad.

2373
01:45:41,260 --> 01:45:43,300
And then they saw him and chased him.

2374
01:45:43,340 --> 01:45:46,580
There was a guy, the guy who the architect who made this place.

2375
01:45:46,580 --> 01:45:48,780
What is his name? You have his name, Harry Oliver.

2376
01:45:48,780 --> 01:45:50,980
Oh, yeah. He was an art director for movies.

2377
01:45:50,980 --> 01:45:52,340
Yes, he did a bunch of movies.

2378
01:45:52,340 --> 01:45:54,140
But there's a place in Beverly Hills that's still there.

2379
01:45:54,140 --> 01:45:55,260
It's called the Witch House.

2380
01:45:55,260 --> 01:45:56,260
Witch House. Yeah.

2381
01:45:56,260 --> 01:45:57,660
Carly Wiseau was tweeting about that today.

2382
01:45:57,660 --> 01:45:58,940
Yes, I guess.

2383
01:45:58,940 --> 01:46:01,140
I was looking this up and I went, is that what she just tweeted?

2384
01:46:01,140 --> 01:46:01,700
Yeah, it is.

2385
01:46:01,700 --> 01:46:04,340
But there was a thing called the Witch House, which looks just like Tam.

2386
01:46:04,340 --> 01:46:05,500
That's still there.

2387
01:46:05,540 --> 01:46:08,660
That's both of the Tam O'Shander when it was built, the early photos of it.

2388
01:46:08,660 --> 01:46:11,540
It looks so like it got crazy and melty.

2389
01:46:11,740 --> 01:46:16,860
Oh, yeah, because it was originally called Montgomery's Country Inn, I think.

2390
01:46:16,860 --> 01:46:21,900
And then for a few years, they changed the name to the Great Scott.

2391
01:46:22,460 --> 01:46:26,820
And then in 1982, they changed it back to the Tam O'Shander.

2392
01:46:26,820 --> 01:46:29,100
Wow. It's on Walden in Beverly Hills.

2393
01:46:29,380 --> 01:46:34,860
Huh? Because there's a house kind of like that up in like underneath the observatory.

2394
01:46:35,020 --> 01:46:38,980
I love it. Like, L.A. did just seem like a place where people were just like,

2395
01:46:38,980 --> 01:46:43,820
I'm just going to build a weird goof house, you know, like there wasn't like local architecture.

2396
01:46:43,980 --> 01:46:45,940
I guess it would have been like Spanish architecture.

2397
01:46:45,940 --> 01:46:48,020
But like a lot of people were just showing up here and being like,

2398
01:46:48,140 --> 01:46:51,700
I'll do a Tudor mansion and then I'm going to do a castle and we'll just do whatever the fuck.

2399
01:46:51,700 --> 01:46:54,860
There's like I was just driving up in the hills of Burbank and there's like somebody has like

2400
01:46:54,860 --> 01:46:59,420
a like a main like blue house that looks like it's on the coast.

2401
01:46:59,420 --> 01:47:01,460
It's like totally stands out from everything else.

2402
01:47:01,460 --> 01:47:02,700
Yeah, I love that. It's crazy.

2403
01:47:02,700 --> 01:47:08,180
They just think I want L.A. is it's a melting pot and a bunch of shit thrown together.

2404
01:47:08,180 --> 01:47:10,060
In the land where dreams are made, huh?

2405
01:47:10,060 --> 01:47:11,060
That's right.

2406
01:47:11,060 --> 01:47:15,620
I texted Mike right before we started recording, because the other day I was driving all the way up

2407
01:47:15,620 --> 01:47:18,500
this one road in Burbank on Hollywood Way.

2408
01:47:18,940 --> 01:47:21,020
And I'd never noticed this before.

2409
01:47:21,020 --> 01:47:26,380
But there is a little squat little bar building that is practically on the highway.

2410
01:47:26,540 --> 01:47:28,140
And it is called the ramp.

2411
01:47:28,780 --> 01:47:33,220
And I started reading about it and it has been there for 30 plus years.

2412
01:47:33,220 --> 01:47:41,020
It's at different owners and it appears they serve tropical drinks, steaks, Italian food

2413
01:47:41,340 --> 01:47:43,660
and also like all kinds of bar food.

2414
01:47:44,140 --> 01:47:45,540
Like it is fascinating.

2415
01:47:45,540 --> 01:47:50,420
It looks like a nice restaurant, a quote unquote nice restaurant from like 30 years ago.

2416
01:47:50,980 --> 01:47:52,700
And it just seems frozen in time.

2417
01:47:52,700 --> 01:47:56,860
And now I'm so curious about the freeway on ramp bar and restaurant.

2418
01:47:57,500 --> 01:48:02,260
And today I texted you the information that if you go to Gideon's Bake Shop in Orlando,

2419
01:48:02,260 --> 01:48:04,740
that they'll give you a little tub of frosting.

2420
01:48:05,980 --> 01:48:07,540
Yeah, 25 bucks.

2421
01:48:07,540 --> 01:48:10,420
That's the type of correspondence we have to this day.

2422
01:48:11,180 --> 01:48:13,860
It's important magic all around us clearly.

2423
01:48:15,060 --> 01:48:17,460
Well, hey, so fun talking about this.

2424
01:48:17,460 --> 01:48:18,060
But you know what?

2425
01:48:18,060 --> 01:48:21,460
It's just one one little plus up I have about the Tamishantar.

2426
01:48:21,740 --> 01:48:23,940
They got those dressing rooms up there, the locker rooms.

2427
01:48:23,940 --> 01:48:26,620
What I want is a little room where I can fall asleep.

2428
01:48:27,020 --> 01:48:28,460
I want to finish that meal.

2429
01:48:28,460 --> 01:48:31,220
I would rent that for any amount of money on some night.

2430
01:48:31,220 --> 01:48:37,460
Just let me walk up there and put on like a Scrooge sleeping cap and just cozy into it.

2431
01:48:37,460 --> 01:48:38,300
Yeah.

2432
01:48:38,300 --> 01:48:40,780
And they should tuck you in like the Knott's Hotel.

2433
01:48:41,300 --> 01:48:42,300
I want the carolers.

2434
01:48:42,300 --> 01:48:43,460
Sing me a lullaby.

2435
01:48:43,460 --> 01:48:43,980
Yeah.

2436
01:48:43,980 --> 01:48:44,980
How nice is that sound?

2437
01:48:44,980 --> 01:48:47,340
Or the ghosts will tuck you in with the ski mask.

2438
01:48:47,580 --> 01:48:50,460
I might allow it there after I'm fuzzy enough.

2439
01:48:50,460 --> 01:48:52,140
I'll lay where everything's cool.

2440
01:48:52,140 --> 01:48:56,100
Ghosty like John Wayne and Walt Ghost, like force ghosts in the

2441
01:48:56,100 --> 01:48:58,620
in like the doorway looking at you like, oh, look at this.

2442
01:49:00,220 --> 01:49:04,620
There is some very comfy high back chairs next to the one fireplace, which I

2443
01:49:05,940 --> 01:49:11,180
I had Thanksgiving here one year and the steakhouse, the net or the smokehouse.

2444
01:49:11,180 --> 01:49:12,940
The next the other old L.A.

2445
01:49:12,940 --> 01:49:16,660
restaurant, kind of both places, the driest Thanksgiving.

2446
01:49:19,100 --> 01:49:21,020
But the ambience could not be beat.

2447
01:49:21,020 --> 01:49:22,860
Not not wet.

2448
01:49:22,860 --> 01:49:24,260
You know, wet that meat.

2449
01:49:24,260 --> 01:49:27,820
Well, it's easy to dry out white meat.

2450
01:49:28,140 --> 01:49:31,700
Yeah, I've had the Christmas goose at the Tamar Chandra because I was like,

2451
01:49:31,700 --> 01:49:32,940
oh, Christmas goose.

2452
01:49:32,940 --> 01:49:33,820
That's it.

2453
01:49:33,820 --> 01:49:34,940
And it was pretty bad.

2454
01:49:34,940 --> 01:49:36,460
But I was like, oh, whatever.

2455
01:49:36,460 --> 01:49:40,420
I mean, I guess no one has a lot of practice cooking Christmas goose.

2456
01:49:40,860 --> 01:49:41,940
Yeah, not Jason.

2457
01:49:41,940 --> 01:49:45,420
Well, I feel like I ate a big Christmas goose just talking about this play.

2458
01:49:45,420 --> 01:49:46,860
How cozy is it?

2459
01:49:46,860 --> 01:49:49,700
And look, I know it's all local and you might be listening to this episode.

2460
01:49:49,700 --> 01:49:50,820
Like I've never been to this restaurant.

2461
01:49:50,820 --> 01:49:51,860
This doesn't make sense to me.

2462
01:49:51,860 --> 01:49:53,620
If you're doing the L.A.

2463
01:49:53,620 --> 01:49:56,820
theme park trip, if you're coming out for Disneyland or Universal,

2464
01:49:57,140 --> 01:49:58,820
I truly recommend.

2465
01:49:58,820 --> 01:50:02,980
Yeah, because it's a little slice of theme park that is very legit

2466
01:50:02,980 --> 01:50:06,460
and a super satisfying, cozy, fun experience.

2467
01:50:06,460 --> 01:50:08,260
So that's a great if you're far from L.A.

2468
01:50:08,260 --> 01:50:12,300
in your hometown, go to the old kind of prime ribby old school, dusty old place.

2469
01:50:12,300 --> 01:50:15,380
It's it's fun to you can spend a lot of money and feel like, you know,

2470
01:50:15,380 --> 01:50:17,580
what, I'm keeping the traditional live.

2471
01:50:17,620 --> 01:50:19,700
I'm contributing to history here.

2472
01:50:19,980 --> 01:50:21,460
Amen. Absolutely.

2473
01:50:21,460 --> 01:50:24,100
Thanks for contributing to to our history.

2474
01:50:25,700 --> 01:50:26,220
That's right.

2475
01:50:26,220 --> 01:50:28,140
Typical package, you survive podcast, the ride.

2476
01:50:28,140 --> 01:50:29,580
Thank you so much.

2477
01:50:29,580 --> 01:50:31,980
Such a blast to have you finally.

2478
01:50:31,980 --> 01:50:33,180
Let's exit through the gift shop.

2479
01:50:33,180 --> 01:50:34,700
Is there anything you'd like to plug?

2480
01:50:34,700 --> 01:50:38,660
Oh, check out the sloppy boys podcast or it's a cocktail podcast

2481
01:50:38,660 --> 01:50:42,060
with Jefferson Dutton and Mike Hanford, where we drink a different

2482
01:50:42,860 --> 01:50:44,220
cocktail every week there.

2483
01:50:44,220 --> 01:50:47,620
And then we're a party rock band with three albums on Spotify.

2484
01:50:47,620 --> 01:50:49,860
Put them it's a it's pool party music, folks.

2485
01:50:50,260 --> 01:50:52,300
Rock out to it at your next barbecue.

2486
01:50:53,660 --> 01:50:55,820
Fantastic. No Christmas carols.

2487
01:50:55,820 --> 01:50:57,260
Yeah, yeah.

2488
01:50:57,260 --> 01:50:58,300
You got to do a Christmas.

2489
01:50:58,300 --> 01:50:59,620
Christmas is. Oh, yeah.

2490
01:50:59,620 --> 01:51:01,820
I have actually written that we didn't have enough for an album,

2491
01:51:01,820 --> 01:51:03,980
but I have a couple of songs.

2492
01:51:03,980 --> 01:51:05,660
Wow. Oh, great. Great. All right.

2493
01:51:05,660 --> 01:51:06,380
That's exciting.

2494
01:51:07,380 --> 01:51:11,780
And as for us know, well, now that we do have an album,

2495
01:51:11,780 --> 01:51:13,820
they said the McGruff album, there is that.

2496
01:51:14,180 --> 01:51:15,020
Well, there's multiple.

2497
01:51:15,020 --> 01:51:17,900
There's enough songs we've made to to do an album.

2498
01:51:17,900 --> 01:51:19,220
There's a couple of McGruff.

2499
01:51:19,220 --> 01:51:20,580
There's Brian Cornell.

2500
01:51:20,580 --> 01:51:22,580
There's Boyna Park song.

2501
01:51:22,580 --> 01:51:25,660
There's enough for like a nine track album.

2502
01:51:25,660 --> 01:51:28,300
I feel like they're doing a vinyl release, a compilation.

2503
01:51:28,300 --> 01:51:33,100
People are the final release of my song about the CEO of Target.

2504
01:51:33,140 --> 01:51:34,340
Yeah, right.

2505
01:51:34,700 --> 01:51:36,060
That would be a proud day.

2506
01:51:36,060 --> 01:51:37,700
I would be very happy about that.

2507
01:51:37,700 --> 01:51:40,620
But as for now, the things are that you could find us on the socials

2508
01:51:40,620 --> 01:51:43,500
at podcast, the right merch is available on our T public store

2509

for three bonus episodes every month.

2510
01:51:44,940 --> 01:51:48,740
Check out podcast, the ride, the second gate or get one more bonus episode

2511
01:51:48,740 --> 01:51:50,060

You'll find all that at Patreon dot com slash podcast.

2513
01:51:53,260 --> 01:51:55,340
The ride such a blast.

2514
01:51:55,340 --> 01:51:57,540
Let's all go there now. Let's go there now.

2515
01:51:57,540 --> 01:52:00,300
I wanted to say I did figure out what that name of the place was,

2516
01:52:00,300 --> 01:52:03,460
and it's just as great the place that Saddle Ranch replaced.

2517
01:52:03,500 --> 01:52:05,420
Oh, yeah. That actually was two replacements.

2518
01:52:05,420 --> 01:52:09,460
Whomp Hoppers Whomp Hoppers Wagonworks.

2519
01:52:09,460 --> 01:52:13,340
Yes. And a guy would walk around and he's the character of Whomp

2520
01:52:13,340 --> 01:52:16,580
Hopper like in a fake beer. Hello, I'm Whomp Hopper.

2521
01:52:16,980 --> 01:52:19,420
Oh, that's the I'm looking at the pictures and I was like,

2522
01:52:19,420 --> 01:52:21,980
I know we talked about this, but can we do an episode again

2523
01:52:21,980 --> 01:52:24,660
and just say the same facts?

2524
01:52:26,300 --> 01:52:28,140
I don't see why not.

2525
01:52:28,140 --> 01:52:31,100
And if you all right, we'll go and go to your local steakhouse and locals.

2526
01:52:31,100 --> 01:52:34,820
If anyone runs a local steakhouse and you're not proud of your owner,

2527
01:52:34,820 --> 01:52:38,220
like they did something bad like Griffith, then make up a character

2528
01:52:38,220 --> 01:52:42,300
like Whomp Hopper, a jolly guy and have him walk around in your business.

2529
01:52:42,300 --> 01:52:44,420
So boom. Guaranteed.

2530
01:52:44,500 --> 01:52:47,140
Guaranteed. Good day.

2531
01:52:51,420 --> 01:52:54,500
