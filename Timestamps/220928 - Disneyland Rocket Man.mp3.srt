1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:23,720
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, The Second Gate.

3
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,980
I'm Scott Gardner joined by Mike Carlson.

4
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:28,540
I'm here, I'm ready to soar.

5
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:33,380
Yeah, and you are, Jason Sheridan is not.

6
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:36,180
This is another no Jason.

7
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:37,100
No Jason, yeah.

8
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:42,100
And I'll tell you why it is due to his deep

9
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:46,300
and longstanding hatred of astronauts.

10
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:48,980
He's been very vocal about this ever since we met.

11
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:53,460
There is one area that he just has a lot of ire for.

12
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:54,300
Yeah.

13
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,360
And it's, as he's put it, and Frank,

14
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,800
I'm glad he's not here to go on the tear himself,

15
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,900
but as he's put it, filthy astronauts.

16
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:03,420
He is no fan of them.

17
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:06,000
Well, he likes mission space more than we do

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,300
because he felt like you shouldn't need to be an astronaut

19
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:10,140
to go into space.

20
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:11,580
He felt like it was elitist.

21
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:14,780
Oh yeah, and it kind of democratizes the experience.

22
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:18,460
Well, that's because he's always been kind of anti the elite

23
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:20,940
in the top 0.1%.

24
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:24,380
And I think he puts astronauts in that category,

25
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:26,300
which I don't know if they are monetarily,

26
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,320
but in terms of experience and just what they get,

27
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,640
the access they have, which is to the moon

28
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,240
and space stations and such.

29
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,640
Well, he sees that suit they wear

30
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,720
as a very fancy sort of status symbol.

31
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,880
And he said, why can't you just wear cargo shorts

32
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,280
on your way up to the moon?

33
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,960
Yeah, and we try to tell him it's more of a technical thing.

34
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,520
I'm sure some of them would love to wear sweats,

35
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,440
but he's just not having, I think he was raised with this,

36
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,440
maybe it might be from his parents.

37
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:56,040
It's hard to say, but he just,

38
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,020
we told him this topic and he said, never.

39
00:01:59,020 --> 00:01:59,860
He got upset.

40
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:01,100
Fuck no.

41
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:03,420
The other ones were due to,

42
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:06,080
we lied about the other one over the COVID was part of it,

43
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,740
but this one, he just did not.

44
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:09,420
Yeah, we woke him up.

45
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:11,500
We woke him up, we said Disneyland Rocket Man.

46
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,540
He said, no, he went right back to bed.

47
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:16,940
We live in a monkey style apartment altogether.

48
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:19,580
Mm-hmm, yeah, we didn't talk about that enough.

49
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:23,500
The monkeys from the 60s, not some.

50
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,600
Not monkeys.

51
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,420
We are not in a tree house.

52
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:29,180
We're not in a zoo, we're not in Animal Kingdom.

53
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:31,780
Not fictional band, but put together band.

54
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:32,620
The same way One Direction was.

55
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:36,580
The fabricated band, you might say.

56
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:38,420
That's too much judgment to put on the-

57
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:39,240
Too much judgment, they belong

58
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,080
in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

59
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,700
I said it five years ago on this podcast

60
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:42,860
and I'll say it again.

61
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:44,460
You remember saying it.

62
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:46,060
I remember saying it, yeah.

63
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:47,860
Because John Daly told me no.

64
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:49,380
Oh, wow. That's what I remember.

65
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:50,500
Oh, that's fascinating.

66
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,540
I don't remember this at all.

67
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:54,020
Yeah, I said monkeys should be in the Hall of Fame

68
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:55,700
and he goes, no, TV show.

69
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,800
Is he just saying that they belong in the TV Hall of Fame?

70
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,560
I don't know, maybe that's what he meant.

71
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,400
I'm not sure.

72
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,060
It gets dicey because so many other people

73
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,480
wrote some of it and you know.

74
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,200
It's almost like the Hall of Fame

75
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,840
is confusing in a lot of ways.

76
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,600
There are a lot of people who are in the Rock and Roll

77
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,760
Hall of Fame who have like three songs.

78
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,240
And the monkeys have a lot of songs.

79
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,680
A lot of good songs.

80
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,600
A lot of songs they wrote.

81
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,020
Singers, there's a lot of great singers

82
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:24,640
in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

83
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,780
So I feel like that alone.

84
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:28,920
You think you need to be able to play an instrument?

85
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,580
No, no, I'm saying if singers are in the Rock and Roll

86
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:33,900
Hall of Fame that don't write their songs.

87
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:34,740
Oh.

88
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:36,860
Then the monkeys are more than qualified

89
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:37,980
to be in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

90
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:40,780
Yeah, that's kind of an unfair judgment.

91
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,180
Yeah, that's all.

92
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,860
They aren't even on the ballad, I don't feel like.

93
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:44,740
Never.

94
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:46,420
It's so far out of.

95
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:47,260
Yeah.

96
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,080
Yeah, yeah.

97
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,360
Well look, you know how I've never seen Toto in contention

98
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,560
and that makes me angry.

99
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,840
That's a little elitist thing.

100
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,680
Every year.

101
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:57,360
That's a, there's a lot of elitism in there.

102
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,160
Todd Rundgren, of all the people I like to talk about,

103
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:03,720
Todd Rundgren got it and didn't go.

104
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,560
Right.

105
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,840
And they played a clip saying,

106
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,240
they played a clip of him saying,

107
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,400
if elected I will not serve.

108
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,760
And then that is what happens.

109
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,740
A man of his word.

110
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:13,040
A lot of people don't like it.

111
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,040
Steve Miller did it but doesn't like it.

112
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:19,500
And the Black Keys regret inducting him, they said.

113
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,080
Because he was a jerk about it?

114
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,200
Fuck the Black Keys, I don't care.

115
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,320
Yeah, that's annoying.

116
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,320
We regret the Hallow dolls.

117
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,920
Yeah, yeah, shut up.

118
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,760
That's a lot going on with that one guy.

119
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:34,440
Bernie, make some more music

120
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,520
for barbecue restaurant commercials, why don't you?

121
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,400
Very rich.

122
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,240
Okay, that's not what we're here.

123
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:44,200
We are here and we better save the topic sooner than later

124
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,840
because it's a little bit of a confusing one.

125
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:50,040
It's the Disneyland Rocket Man.

126
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,640
And I want to say this.

127
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:56,640
You might be looking at this episode title and tweet

128
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,720
and maybe there's some photos from black and white

129
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:02,920
or the 60s and you're going, this is boring.

130
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,080
I will sit through this.

131
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,360
But I'm not excited about this one.

132
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,360
Well, if that's your attitude,

133
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,320
let me quote another famous rocket man owned by Disney

134
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:17,120
named Luke Skywalker and say this.

135
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,920
This is not going to go the way you think.

136
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:24,240
That's a little tease because there is some stuff

137
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,400
happening in this episode.

138
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,600
There are some rabbit holes, there's some weird wild stuff.

139
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,720
Yeah, of course, rich little.

140
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,240
That might be a Dana Carvey invention, I think.

141
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,560
Weird wild stuff, Johnny Carson maybe never said it.

142
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:42,440
Like the Regis I'm Out of Control.

143
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,280
Yeah, that's right.

144
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

145
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,320
Dana invention.

146
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,440
And Arnold didn't say, I want to pump you up.

147
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,120
These are stories we hear every week

148
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:53,920
when we both listen to that podcast of Dana and David Spade.

149
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,160
Yeah, yeah.

150
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,000
Here, let's do a quick,

151
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,520
I'm gonna do a quick impression of that.

152
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,520
You start, be either one of them that you want.

153
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,360
Okay, oh yeah, so.

154
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,160
Yeah, yeah, also I was,

155
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,920
I've never heard more talking over.

156
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,800
No awareness of who has the floor.

157
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,320
And then Lauren wouldn't let me do a commercial.

158
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:18,000
I want to do, I think talks about the commercial so much.

159
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,520
So different there now, you know,

160
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,560
because Lauren said I couldn't do the commercial.

161
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,680
I lit up so much of that I scared a dog.

162
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,520
Yeah, yeah, I swear every episode Spade talks about

163
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,800
not being able to do that commercial,

164
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,400
as if he didn't have every opportunity

165
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,960
to do every commercial ever since then.

166
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,520
Yeah, but it's haunted him and it's one of like

167
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,880
the only safe stories he can tell about the time there.

168
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:38,720
Oh, that's true.

169
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,800
They're both very on, they both don't want to like

170
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,200
give any good stuff.

171
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,600
Yeah, yeah, sure, yeah, they're hedging bets.

172
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,720
It's a safe batch of stories.

173
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,720
So it's easy to go wrong.

174
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:53,480
They aren't honest like us and are revealing Jason's.

175
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,920
No, no, no, no.

176
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,880
Hardcore astronaut hatred.

177
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:57,720
Yeah, no way.

178
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,520
Where were we?

179
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,120
Oh, Disneyland Rocket Man.

180
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:05,320
Yeah, look, there's twists and turns here

181
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,960
and I'm excited to talk about it.

182
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,080
Did you know what I was talking about

183
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,400
when I proposed this?

184
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,600
Yeah, my vision, when you said it,

185
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:18,120
the first thing I thought of was the opening of Disneyland

186
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,480
or the first few years or whatever it is

187
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:23,440
with the guy in the suit flying around.

188
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,280
Yes, yes.

189
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,920
That's the first thing I thought of when you said it.

190
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,000
And that is it.

191
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,480
That is what we're talking about.

192
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:33,480
It's very like early Walt era footage

193
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:39,120
of it's kind of pre a lot of the redo

194
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,560
and maturity of Tomorrowland.

195
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,520
Yes.

196
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,960
When there wasn't a lot there,

197
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,680
there's great old footage of a guy shooting up

198
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:50,480
on a real jet pack flying past the castle

199
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,960
and coming back down to the ground.

200
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,720
Yes, and I will admit, I think for many years

201
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,000
I thought this was fake.

202
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,320
I don't believe I thought this was an actual jet.

203
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,760
I thought they were doing this somehow with tricks.

204
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:06,040
I think they used this footage and recontextualized it a lot

205
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:10,760
and probably juxtaposed it with Mary Poppins.

206
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:13,680
Like it's a montage of the magic of Disney

207
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,160
and there's Mary Poppins flying,

208
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,920
which I'm sorry to say was fake.

209
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,800
I did know that.

210
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,040
Yes.

211
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,360
I was aware of that.

212
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,800
They did not build a rocket powered umbrella.

213
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,080
Yeah, too bad.

214
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,120
But this was real.

215
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,360
This guy really did this.

216
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,840
But I'm gonna come back to that.

217
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,200
I'm gonna put the pause button.

218
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,040
You're going the other way.

219
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,240
So now that we've established what that is,

220
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:38,000
I wanna say kind of how we got here,

221
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,320
why this suddenly seemed relevant to me.

222
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:45,520
It's because of a joke that I saw on Twitter

223
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:49,400
that I liked because recently there was this weird thing

224
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:53,560
where Disney was promoting the now beloved American

225
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,720
canon classic Lightyear.

226
00:08:55,720 --> 00:09:00,160
And part of the promotion of this was that Lightyear

227
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,160
is in the park.

228
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,760
And I say Lightyear, not Buzz Lightyear,

229
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,440
even though that's the character's name.

230
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,400
But I mean current Lightyear because this wasn't like

231
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:13,680
a plastic molded, the toy that we've loved for many years.

232
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,160
This was just a guy, a regular guy.

233
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:21,520
And he had a wig to standardize the kind of regular guy

234
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,600
he was.

235
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,560
And it was inexplicable.

236
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,680
Like it's in your timeline and I'm staring at it

237
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,200
and like, it doesn't look like Lightyear in the movie.

238
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,320
It's just a, it's a man.

239
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,920
It's so, this is nothing.

240
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:35,920
What is this?

241
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,840
That's like, just like pick like somebody

242
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:41,160
you went to high school with and now they're in Disneyland

243
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,000
waving.

244
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,840
It's still a cartoon.

245
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:45,120
Lightyear is still a cartoon.

246
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:45,960
Yes.

247
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,540
And he still has kind of a big

248
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:48,800
bulbas. Exaggerated features.

249
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,720
Chin and neck.

250
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,560
Yeah.

251
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:54,960
So I would say that plastic would still be in the cards.

252
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,880
I think, I think representing him as just a guy

253
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,160
is really confusing.

254
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,000
I agree.

255
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,280
But they tried to make it seem like that was a live action

256
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,120
movie, right?

257
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,760
In Andy's universe.

258
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:05,600
Well, yeah.

259
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,440
And this is the question.

260
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,840
I think, I think you've answered it,

261
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:11,400
but I've been asking people just to get full clarity

262
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:15,080
is the idea that Andy's, when Andy,

263
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,800
a human being in the Toy Story world,

264
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:21,900
he goes to a theater and sees other human beings playing

265
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:25,680
Lightyear and Commander Hawthorne or whatever

266
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,280
the other characters are.

267
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,120
Have you seen it?

268
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:28,940
Did you see it?

269
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:31,700
I've seen some of it on Disney Plus now.

270
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:32,540
Oh, it's on Disney.

271
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:34,160
I didn't realize it's on Disney Plus.

272
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,000
Yeah. Yeah.

273
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I've seen a little, I watched a little of it

274
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,920
and tried to see if the boy was into it

275
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:42,040
and he handed me the remote so fast.

276
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:44,080
Really? No, no.

277
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,400
I mean, he does that every day.

278
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,240
Okay, all right.

279
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,240
I was gonna say this is the first time he's ever done it.

280
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,080
Very patient otherwise.

281
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:56,000
No, it's, yeah, I got through some of it,

282
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
but do you know what I'm saying?

283
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,160
Like what, so it's not, like it's not a cartoon to Andy.

284
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,480
That's what I thought.

285
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,540
Yeah.

286
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:07,380
But then what that opens up is that there is this guy.

287
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:10,380
There is a, like, it's not Chris Evans.

288
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:13,900
There is a man out there in Andy's world

289
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:17,060
who went and played a character.

290
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:18,540
Yeah, there's an actor that, yes.

291
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:19,380
Yeah.

292
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:20,200
He would be a fan of that actor.

293
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,420
And who's that and why don't they say his name?

294
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:27,420
And is he still around in Andy's world?

295
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:31,340
Is he had a right wing turn like Tim Allen?

296
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:33,060
Right, well, turn, you know.

297
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:34,780
I don't know if there was ever really a.

298
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:38,100
Started to be more vocal about his right winginess.

299
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,940
His laziness, yeah.

300
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:40,760
It's a good question.

301
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:43,180
I think that's, that is what ended up happening.

302
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:44,420
I think that, honestly,

303
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:45,740
I don't think they were thinking that hard.

304
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:47,140
They were just like, let's do a new version

305
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:48,220
of Buzz Lightyear.

306
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:50,020
And then it was like all this like,

307
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:51,060
and I could totally be wrong,

308
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:53,180
but then they have to retroactively go,

309
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:54,020
well, okay, what is it?

310
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:57,100
Like, what is it in relation versus like,

311
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:00,300
like there's plenty of, there's a new Spider-Man cartoon now

312
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,660
and it's like, well, it's not in the canons, whatever.

313
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:03,860
Don't worry about it.

314
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:04,700
Yes.

315
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:05,540
This is just a light year.

316
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:06,380
They just made him,

317
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:09,060
the Evans tweet set off a firestorm.

318
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,460
I think I've said this before.

319
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:13,220
That set off a firestorm of logic policing.

320
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:14,060
Yes.

321
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:14,900
Because there was no reason for it.

322
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:15,720
It's like, oh, it's light year

323
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,900
and it's a new version of a different voice.

324
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,340
We all understand that.

325
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:21,180
It's an action adventure inspired by,

326
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:23,220
we know that there was a property.

327
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,060
What was it?

328
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:24,880
Let's look.

329
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,340
And even that I got where it lost me was,

330
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:30,220
it is 1995.

331
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:32,300
They say this at the beginning of the movie.

332
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:35,860
In 1995, a boy bought a toy.

333
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:40,540
It was from his favorite movie.

334
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:42,060
This is that movie.

335
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:43,340
And then it begins.

336
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:44,820
That's too specific.

337
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,860
It can be inspired by,

338
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:51,860
but when you tell me that that is a movie from 1995,

339
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:54,260
I have a thousand questions now.

340
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:58,140
This is like when I saw the Beatles cover band a week,

341
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:00,900
like last weekend and fake John was telling a speech

342
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,420
about real John.

343
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:04,180
That is so funny.

344
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:05,340
The lie he was like, he sat down.

345
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:06,780
He's like, you know what?

346
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:09,780
There was a man who lived a while ago

347
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:11,060
and you're like, is he talking about,

348
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:13,060
is fake John talking about real John?

349
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:16,460
And he believed in love and peace

350
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:17,940
and wouldn't it be nice if we all,

351
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:19,620
and I'm like, fake John is doing that.

352
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:20,460
What's the logic of this?

353
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:23,740
John can't talk about John being your character.

354
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:27,700
Why do you need to say like, I believe in peace and love.

355
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:28,540
Why not?

356
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:29,580
Yeah, it's you.

357
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:30,420
What do you mean?

358
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:31,820
Right.

359
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:32,660
And then he was, he even said something like,

360
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:33,500
you know what he was,

361
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,940
and he was senselessly murdered.

362
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,060
And you're like, what?

363
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:40,420
I mean, I guess it's weirder if he says it.

364
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,260
And then I was killed.

365
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:43,540
I was senselessly murdered.

366
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:47,360
Have you ever wondered what if my music wasn't popular,

367
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,900
but a guy in the 2010s did it instead?

368
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:54,500
And then he came and found me and I was an old man

369
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:58,180
who was wise, but not a hit musician.

370
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:59,020
That would have,

371
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:01,220
there were more questions with that as well.

372
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:03,300
But this is just the way he was presenting it.

373
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,020
I go, why don't you just play Imagine?

374
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:05,860
Because he was going to play Imagine,

375
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:07,380
which by the way also doesn't make sense

376
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:10,060
because not a Beatles song, then it's a Beatles cover band.

377
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:11,300
Did the other Beatles play?

378
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:12,700
Yes, the other Beatles played on it.

379
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:15,700
I mean, Ringo was playing,

380
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:16,660
what were they wearing?

381
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:18,060
Because they were doing Sergeant Pepper outfits

382
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:20,020
right before that, but I think they switched.

383
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:22,140
But Ringo plays drums on Imagine.

384
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:22,960
Oh really?

385
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:23,800
I didn't know that actually.

386
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,860
So, Ringo is the only one,

387
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:27,820
fake Ringo is the only one who should have been there.

388
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:29,540
The rest should have left.

389
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:31,340
It should have been like something that I heard

390
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:34,700
that they did in a Spice Girls reunion tour

391
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,100
where they're up on platforms

392
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,980
and then they're about to do one of the songs

393
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:41,460
from when Ginger was gone and then she's lowered

394
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:44,980
into the ground and then came back later.

395
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:46,860
I actually really like that.

396
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:47,820
That's really funny.

397
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:50,300
I mean, there's a lot of bands with that problem

398
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:52,340
with a member that was gone for many years.

399
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:53,180
Yeah.

400
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:54,020
And what do you do?

401
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:56,620
I think mostly just throw them in.

402
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:57,780
I don't think it has to be addressed

403
00:14:57,780 --> 00:15:00,580
other than when there's death involved.

404
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:04,220
Well, if Ed Robertson would get over whatever it is

405
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:06,620
and it lets Stephen Page back in the Barenake of Ladies,

406
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:08,260
there's gonna have this issue as well.

407
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:10,620
You somehow, in referencing the Barenake of Ladies

408
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:13,580
in every other episode, have never said Ed Robinson.

409
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:14,420
Robertson.

410
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:15,240
Robertson.

411
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,080
Yeah.

412
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:16,920
Okay, so that's new in the-

413
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:17,740
I'm mad at him.

414
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:21,140
Well, for Jason, it's astronauts.

415
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:21,980
For you, it's Ed Robertson.

416
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:23,380
I don't know who these men,

417
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,900
but I believe that he's the reason

418
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,900
Stephen can't come back.

419
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,300
I think Stephen hurt him too much,

420
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,700
and I understand that on some level,

421
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,660
but the band needs to be together, Ed.

422
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:36,700
I have a good backstage Barenake of Ladies story

423
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:37,620
that I'll tell you after this.

424
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:38,580
All right, fair.

425
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:40,380
My catch then, Sader.

426
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:44,820
Anyway, so point is, there was a light year in the park,

427
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:49,540
and he was just a guy, and I saw a tweet that was like,

428
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:51,580
this is just a guy in a space suit.

429
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:54,900
This is like they brought back the Disneyland Rocket Man.

430
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:58,140
I was like, oh, that's funny, and that, oh, that's right.

431
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:00,660
There was just a guy in a space suit, and that was it,

432
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,540
and he would fly around in a jet pack.

433
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:05,860
Then I realized, wait a minute, these are different things,

434
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:08,700
and we have to give a little bit of mention

435
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:11,380
to the other thing, which is not,

436
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:16,380
the Disneyland Rocket Man is not the Tomorrowland Space Man.

437
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:18,620
That's different.

438
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:22,220
That was an opening day thing.

439
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:25,420
Actually, they did that, I think, for 10 years.

440
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:27,580
This jet pack guy was only there for three weeks.

441
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:28,420
You heard me, I got confused earlier.

442
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:31,060
I said opening day, it was not the jet pack guy.

443
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:32,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

444
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:36,140
No, that's a separate, that was just like a limited time run,

445
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:38,420
a jet pack guy is gonna fly around.

446
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:41,580
What they originally had was just a guy

447
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:44,300
in a big heavy space suit walking around,

448
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:46,980
which was apparently exceedingly popular.

449
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:49,900
People lined up, it got people away from attractions

450
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:53,100
that were malfunctioning, like, oh, get the space man out,

451
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,300
that'll distract him.

452
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:59,300
It's a really funny, like, sci-fi, 50, 60 sci-fi outfit.

453
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:01,980
Yeah, do you got a picture in front of you?

454
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,260
Yeah, it's the biggest though.

455
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:05,620
Oh, great, that's the hugest helmet ever.

456
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:06,940
It's so funny.

457
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:10,340
He's got a round, giant, clear helmet,

458
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:14,340
but then he's also got, or no, I guess it's not a hat.

459
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:16,980
I'm confused by the geography of it.

460
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:20,340
He's got like, it's almost like it's like a globe,

461
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:23,300
and then there's like sort of an exoskeleton around the globe.

462
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:26,580
And then it's hard to tell if he's wearing kind of like a nun's habit

463
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:30,540
or if it's just like something that's part of the actual helmet.

464
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:32,740
I don't know, I can't tell.

465
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:36,140
And then he's kind of got, I would say like,

466
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:41,420
like Goldar or the Green Ranger, like kind of a,

467
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:42,420
I don't know how would you call it.

468
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:44,220
You mean like the bubble collar?

469
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:46,860
Yeah, like a metallic shawl or something.

470
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:51,700
And there's like four, there's four like kind of like poofy tubes,

471
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:52,700
like poofy tubes.

472
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,140
Yeah, so he has a bunch of pool noodles attached.

473
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:57,860
Yeah, and they don't look, yeah, the idea I'm sure is that it's like

474
00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:00,340
providing oxygen or something, but they look,

475
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:01,980
they don't look like they have any use.

476
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,500
They don't have any practical use.

477
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,260
Nah, it's just for comfort, I think.

478
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:07,020
And then yeah, he's got, it's all silver.

479
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:11,220
And then he's got kind of a belt with what's, I don't know,

480
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:15,620
like a piece of metal stuck there with some bolts attached to it,

481
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:17,340
which I guess it looks like a transmitter,

482
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:19,660
like there's two antenna coming out of it.

483
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:21,500
Oh yeah, some like little doodad bog.

484
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:25,620
There was just a probably Bob Gurr tossed that together in 45 seconds.

485
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:28,740
Guy, he's like, oh, gotcha, what do you want?

486
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:31,500
Some Buffett voice for Bob Gurr.

487
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,140
Oh yeah, he's also got, excuse me, on the helmet,

488
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:36,340
he's got kind of like an antenna too, like a fun alien,

489
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:39,780
kind of like antenna with two little satellite things.

490
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:42,620
It's a fun, silly 50s outfit.

491
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:44,500
Just a great classic.

492
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:49,900
Yeah, from this very sci-fi era, they were starting to dream of space,

493
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:53,700
but man had not been to space yet.

494
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:59,860
Down to where, apparently, the word astronaut had not been invented yet.

495
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:00,460
Oh wow.

496
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:02,740
Jason's wish.

497
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:06,580
They, like, that's how new all this was, that they just, well, what do we call it?

498
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:07,780
I don't know, spaceman.

499
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:08,780
I guess it's a spaceman.

500
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:10,580
Yeah.

501
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:14,260
So this guy would walk around.

502
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:19,180
Actually, why he showed up originally is that there was a weird tomorrow,

503
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:22,940
we got to do a weird Tomorrowland episode at some point, like early Tomorrowland.

504
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:25,660
There was a thing there, I think we've never talked about this in the show,

505
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:29,460
it was called the Kaiser Hall of Aluminum Fame.

506
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,660
No, we've never talked about that.

507
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:32,340
And I did not get that order wrong.

508
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:35,180
The name of it was, it wasn't the Aluminum Hall of Fame,

509
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:37,700
it was the Hall of Aluminum Fame.

510
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:38,380
Wow.

511
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:42,420
It was devoted to fame within the arena of aluminum.

512
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:43,940
Man.

513
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:48,340
So that was this aluminum company called Kaiser,

514
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:52,620
and they wanted a presence in the opening day festivities and television shows,

515
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:57,980
so they got this spacesuit together and they called him K7, the K for Kaiser.

516
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:01,700
And he was around, and there's even pictures of Eddie Fisher and Debbie

517
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,260
Reynolds, like shoving a Coke down this guy's-

518
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:05,380
Oh, I've seen that.

519
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,780
We might have talked about that in the opening day.

520
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:07,660
Yeah, we've talked about that.

521
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:09,300
Yeah, well, that's who that was.

522
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:14,020
That was this, this was the spaceman, also sometimes known as K7,

523
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:18,340
until Kaiser ended the sponsorship.

524
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:20,260
I liked this story.

525
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:23,780
I've referred before this book from David Koenig about like all the people

526
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:26,460
who worked at Disneyland in the first year.

527
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:28,140
This is from that book.

528
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:31,340
So opening day went great, and then Kaiser called and said,

529
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:32,660
hey, can you keep using that guy?

530
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:36,260
Have him like walk around and tell people to go to the Hall of Aluminum Fame.

531
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:37,300
And they're like, yeah, I guess so.

532
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,340
We don't have anybody to do it.

533
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:40,220
And some employee like, hey, we need you.

534
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:43,860
And they strapped the suit on him, which weighed 66 pounds.

535
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:45,460
Oh my god, it doesn't look like that.

536
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:46,020
Not at all.

537
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:46,700
It looks crappy.

538
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:49,020
Yeah, it looks really, it looks like Halloween store flimsy.

539
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:51,100
Yeah, the helmet must be heavy.

540
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:53,860
Might all be in the helmet, because the helmet is huge.

541
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:54,900
Yeah.

542
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:58,300
So here's how this story is told, which is great.

543
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,940
They got the guy in the suit.

544
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:01,100
OK, we just need approval.

545
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:03,180
So you need to follow us backstage.

546
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:05,340
And this guy walks in this heavy suit.

547
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:06,540
It's so hot.

548
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:07,980
It's middle of July.

549
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:10,580
And like, OK, go in that house.

550
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:11,860
And then they walk into this house.

551
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:16,860
And the spaceman, the guy in the suit, walks up and sees a guy sitting at a desk.

552
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:18,260
And his eyes are bloodshot.

553
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:20,420
It looked like he hadn't slept in a month.

554
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:24,460
And then his handler says, hey, Walt, what do you think?

555
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:26,740
And Walt says, fine, put him in our land.

556
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:29,940
And puts his head back down.

557
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:31,340
Wow.

558
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:33,420
So Walt approved this.

559
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:37,180
And by approved, I mean two seconds of delirious.

560
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:37,700
What?

561
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:38,580
Yeah, whatever.

562
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:40,460
I don't care.

563
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:42,900
Grunted at him.

564
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:43,940
That's so funny.

565
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:44,980
Blah means good.

566
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:46,260
We've learned this.

567
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:48,780
That's the scenario I described with Jason earlier.

568
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:50,900
We woke him up and we went, argh.

569
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:54,060
We're back to sleep.

570
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:56,340
Well, that was Walt, apparently.

571
00:21:56,340 --> 00:22:00,540
And so off of that, there was this guy walking around for years.

572
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:03,460
The spaceman had to be six feet tall.

573
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:04,980
They had to be very imposing.

574
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:09,580
And then that also became true when they added a new character, the character

575
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:10,980
Space Girl.

576
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:11,700
Space Girl.

577
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:14,100
You ran across Space Girl as well.

578
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:17,580
Space Girl is not protected from the elements.

579
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:20,780
Space Girl has some magic ability.

580
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:24,780
Yeah, she's like a character from a Godzilla movie or something.

581
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:28,300
Like those magic, there's like magic twins that show up.

582
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:29,820
Yeah, right, right.

583
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:32,900
It's that kind of like she looks like she could fly.

584
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,300
There's a cape.

585
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:35,860
Yeah, she has a cape.

586
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:36,420
There's a cape.

587
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:40,380
We're out of the realm of practical, like, futurism here.

588
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:41,380
Space.

589
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:45,740
Like, I don't think any division of the government is working on capes

590
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:50,060
and turning turning ladies into superheroes so they can fly into space.

591
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:50,860
They should be.

592
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:51,500
I agree.

593
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,340
I'm just saying.

594
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:55,060
Actually, you know, kind of what actually the episode is about

595
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:56,700
kind of harkens to that in a way.

596
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,100
It was like a sillier time.

597
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:58,540
Yeah.

598
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:00,500
For the government.

599
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,900
And then but then, like, you know, you could be realistic

600
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:06,020
or you could have a pretty gal show off for games.

601
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:09,340
And while the her games are on display, I don't want to be vulgar,

602
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:10,460
but it is the second case.

603
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:12,900
So we said gal and games.

604
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:15,660
Yeah, this is look, it's something for dad, I guess.

605
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:18,140
Disneyland.

606
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:21,180
You know, we should go check out Space Girl, see what she's up to.

607
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:23,220
Don't you think, kids?

608
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:24,460
Dad.

609
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:26,700
Yeah, so I guess that is probably what the thinking was.

610
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,500
Well, we can't put a lady in a space suit.

611
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:31,300
Also, there's probably the sexism of the time.

612
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:33,580
Lady can't be an astronaut.

613
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:34,420
Yeah, probably. Yeah.

614
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:36,220
You can you can't be a spaceman.

615
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:38,460
That's a job. You can be a space girl.

616
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:41,100
That's kind of like a cheerleader for spacemen.

617
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:42,100
Yeah, exactly.

618
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:45,460
So she is a cave like she's a cheerleader.

619
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:46,340
Yeah.

620
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:50,220
There was also a weird calculation that like, well, the space

621
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,420
people need to be six feet tall.

622
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:55,300
And that applies to the women as well.

623
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,020
And thus there was a woman who worked.

624
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:01,220
She was a greeter in the Carnation ice cream shop.

625
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:04,300
And this I think was in that same book or was it?

626
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:06,820
No, it's on a website. It's on Dave Land.

627
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:10,020
This woman worked in the Carnation ice cream parlor on Main Street as a greeter.

628
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:14,620
Quote, it was quite imposing to see this six foot two tall blonde

629
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:17,020
asking people how many in your party.

630
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:19,420
So they said, why don't you be the space girl?

631
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:20,500
Interesting story.

632
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:23,700
The only problem being that it makes no goddamn sense.

633
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:26,020
What do you mean? What's the problem?

634
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:28,540
You can't have a tall ice cream greeter.

635
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:32,620
This only an outer space with this being true.

636
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:33,900
People are just confused.

637
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:37,900
Like, I don't see any people used to be shorter, I guess.

638
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:40,460
Were they my 50s?

639
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:42,300
That's I guess that's not that long ago.

640
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:45,220
Mickey Rooney recently, if I'm going by that logic.

641
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:47,140
But I think he was particularly sure.

642
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:48,660
I thought people used to be shorter.

643
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:50,420
Did people used to be shorter?

644
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:52,020
Well, this woman existed.

645
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:52,860
Well, yeah, that's true.

646
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:54,700
But like, she was an anomaly, I guess.

647
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:56,740
Huh? The average.

648
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:59,100
Why if humans have humans have evolved to be taller?

649
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:01,820
But since the 50s for the last 300 years.

650
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:03,780
OK, well, that's not that far off.

651
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:05,540
Yeah, that's 70.

652
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:07,620
So maybe they just weren't used to it.

653
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:08,940
Yes. So let's see.

654
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:12,700
You're defending the notion that you as I love that notion.

655
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:16,220
Off up your ice cream when you saw that woman.

656
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:21,660
Why isn't and she's not a space girl and she should be probably be a space girl.

657
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:26,180
Anyway, so there were tall space people walking around

658
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:28,540
and that went for a decade or so.

659
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:33,380
But then I don't know how it came to pass that they wanted to up the game

660
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:38,380
and they wanted to showcase some real jet age technology in the park,

661
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:40,260
especially with the cameras around.

662
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:44,460
And that's where we end up with not the spaceman, but the rocket man.

663
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:46,180
Rocket man.

664
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:48,900
A rocket man. The rocket man.

665
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:52,820
What this thing actually was, where we know this footage from.

666
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:55,260
This is a special from 1966.

667
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:57,220
It's called Disneyland around the seasons.

668
00:25:57,220 --> 00:26:01,180
It is on Disney Plus, so you can watch it in very solid quality.

669
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:04,220
It is the last special that Walt appeared in.

670
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:08,260
It aired three days after his death, which I imagine must have been very

671
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:10,180
strange and disarming.

672
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:14,340
Immediately after the cold open, the very beginning of it

673
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:17,460
is this jetpack guy flying around the castle.

674
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:21,460
And then they use it again, kind of show it to you longer.

675
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:25,380
And then I feel like, you know, you just see this.

676
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:28,100
It's like it really represents like a certain era.

677
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:30,220
Yes. Old Disney.

678
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,180
We're shooting in color now.

679
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:35,740
It's kind of a kooky Jetsons past.

680
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:39,260
It's just it is cool.

681
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:41,540
Iconic Disney footage, I feel.

682
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:46,140
Yeah, no, it's it's it does feel like I've seen this more than some of the other

683
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:49,620
like one of the one of the top clips I've seen of Disneyland opening

684
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:52,020
or opening like 10 years, I guess.

685
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:56,340
Yeah, yeah. The top only number one, I think, is Walt and the big map.

686
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:58,260
The Epcot big map.

687
00:26:58,260 --> 00:26:59,460
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

688
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:02,260
Maybe not number one, but that's the one that I forget if I said in the

689
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:04,820
when we talked about the founding of Disney.

690
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:07,340
What Aaron is like, she's had it with the big map.

691
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:09,180
Big map. I have seen this big map.

692
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:11,980
We saw any funny that big map episode, though.

693
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:13,860
Oh, yeah. Just going through.

694
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:16,420
Oh, is that that must be where the conversation went. Yes. Yeah.

695
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:18,340
Let's talk about what was.

696
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:19,700
Oh, well, Aaron's not going to be happy.

697
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:21,660
We go full big map for a while.

698
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:26,460
That map is so big, it's like three space girls.

699
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:29,860
Too scary.

700
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:31,340
But yeah, famous footage.

701
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:33,300
Yeah. Reused a lot.

702
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:37,020
There was a thing in Tomorrowland at the time called the Flight Circle.

703
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:41,260
I didn't know this, that it was like it's like a big compass on the ground.

704
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:45,260
And it was surrounded by a chain link fence.

705
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:48,660
This is kind of like now where it's sort of outside of

706
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:51,700
a Star Tour store.

707
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:55,540
And, you know, it's where it's where the big marble ball is, where the fountain is.

708
00:27:55,540 --> 00:28:00,260
Right. This was all a fenced off circle

709
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:06,260
where apparently children would test model airplanes just every day.

710
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:09,100
And they were very loud and annoying.

711
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:11,620
That's what Disneyland was like.

712
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:14,140
They would test them in the sense that they would like

713
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:18,140
people there wanted like a play test for these things.

714
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:19,820
And they just like kids like mess with them.

715
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:22,940
I think if you were a kid who was interested in model planes,

716
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:27,100
you were more than welcome to bring your model plane to the Disneyland Flight Circle.

717
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:29,140
It was a bringer kind of a thing.

718
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:30,620
I think I really know.

719
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:33,380
Could you fly a kite on Holiday Hill in the old days?

720
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:36,140
I don't know.

721
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:37,700
I guess there's not that much room up there.

722
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:40,540
Kites, there's like a is there an issue with because they don't want it

723
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:43,340
like if what's it made of and if it hits a power line?

724
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:44,340
I guess that's true.

725
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:46,860
I don't know if kites have ever been in the plane is going to hit.

726
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:48,340
A model plane is going to hit stuff.

727
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:51,140
Well, if I think we're talking like it putts around, you know,

728
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:53,060
a couple of feet off the ground. OK.

729
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:56,820
They hadn't experimented truly with height until the Rocket Man. Right.

730
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:59,820
Came into the picture Tinkerbell.

731
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:01,860
Oh, you Tinkerbell, I guess.

732
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:04,700
I don't know why this happened.

733
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:09,060
I don't know why they did it, but I guess it was a neat thing to do.

734
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:12,300
A cool bit of publicity.

735
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:14,700
So they pulled this thing together.

736
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:17,860
And the guy who

737
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:22,020
did the flood, the Rocket Man, the Rocket Man's name is Bill Suter.

738
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:23,140
Bill Suter.

739
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:25,140
That's who was in William Suter.

740
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:26,900
William Suter.

741
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:30,700
And he was the top

742
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:34,900
rocket man for decades.

743
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:37,180
Yes. This is what's interesting. Yeah.

744
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:42,780
OK. You look into the like if you've ever seen footage of maybe not jetpacks

745
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:48,500
in general, but a lot of if you just scan through, where have I seen jetpacks before?

746
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:52,060
If it very well may have been this specific thing,

747
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:54,780
which is actually called a rocket belt,

748
00:29:54,780 --> 00:30:00,380
and it's got like two tanks on the back and then two little joysticks.

749
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:03,260
And you sort of blast straight up.

750
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:05,420
It runs off hydrogen peroxide.

751
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:07,700
Whoa. That's what I read.

752
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:10,460
Wait, isn't that like what you clean your mouth with?

753
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:12,980
Yeah, wait, yes.

754
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:16,700
It's a common household item, is it not?

755
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:19,500
Yeah. That you filled up the rocket belt with?

756
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:22,740
I'll double check it, but I'm almost 99 percent sure that's right.

757
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:25,820
That's the magic. As I said, it does sound fake.

758
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:28,100
It's weird. Well, double check.

759
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,140
But I'm pretty sure it is.

760
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:32,540
I don't know. I don't think that would have stuck with you if it wasn't true.

761
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:34,940
Yeah. Hydrogen peroxide powered rocket packs.

762
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:35,780
What?

763
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:40,100
Hydrogen peroxide power engine is based on the decomposition

764
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:42,100
reaction of hydrogen peroxide.

765
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:44,820
Nearly pure hydrogen peroxide is used.

766
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:48,380
Pure hydrogen peroxide is relatively stable, but in contact with a catalyst,

767
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:52,260
for example, silver, it decomposes into a mixture of superheated steam

768
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:56,180
and oxygen in less than one tenth of a millisecond, increasing in volume

769
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:58,020
five thousand times.

770
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:02,780
So I read now I'm remembering now what I read is that it's hard to get.

771
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:06,380
This method of jetpack is not used anymore because it's hard to get pure

772
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:10,700
hydrogen peroxide because like the stuff you rinse your mouth out with is not pure.

773
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:13,900
It's going to say they can't sell like explosive jet.

774
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:15,900
It's a little or yes.

775
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:17,020
Yes. In your mouth.

776
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:20,580
Yeah. Yeah. So his his what I believe was hydrogen peroxide based.

777
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:22,020
The ones he would use.

778
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:23,740
Wow. Weird.

779
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:27,420
That that really amps the insanity of saying so.

780
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:30,780
He's going to come and I thought this was fake footage for years.

781
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:34,340
I don't think it was said I didn't learn it today that it wasn't fake.

782
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:38,980
But recently, I think I learned that that wasn't some sort of visual trick. Wow.

783
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:42,660
That that there was jetpack is like people would say like jetpacks aren't real.

784
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:45,180
But then you look back and jetpacks have been around for 100 years.

785
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:47,140
Really? 100 years.

786
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:48,260
Like it looks like it.

787
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:50,580
Wow. The first jetpack or the other jetpack.

788
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:52,780
Yeah. I'm not sure if there's anybody as famous as Mr.

789
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:57,540
Suter. The first pack was designed in 1919 by the Russian inventor Alexander

790
00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:02,060
Andreev. The project was well regarded by Nikolai Rinin and Arinin

791
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:03,820
and technology historians.

792
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:06,620
You V. Beer. You Cove.

793
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:08,740
Huh? Another Russian guy.

794
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:10,260
What was that like in 1919?

795
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:12,620
That seems so oxygen and methane powered.

796
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:14,540
Oh, my God. With wings roughly.

797
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:17,060
Yeah. So seems dangerous and surely.

798
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:21,940
So so yeah, like I it was kind of crazy when I learned that this was not fake

799
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:26,140
footage and that you like a jetpack exists because this is another one of those

800
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:28,660
things where you're in a kid, you expect this is the future because you watch the

801
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:31,540
Jetsons and you expect this to be the case.

802
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:34,140
Like, you know, in 10 years time, everybody will have one.

803
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:38,420
Yeah. And there's a common maybe overused joke of I want my jetpack.

804
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:40,180
You know, where are my jetpacks?

805
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:41,220
Oh, like they are.

806
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:43,180
The future is very boring.

807
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:44,900
My flying cars or whatever.

808
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,020
Sure. Yeah. Yeah.

809
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:50,100
Well, there was an attempt made to the reason we've ever seen this

810
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:52,820
footage is because the U.S.

811
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:57,820
government, the army, yeah, legitimately was trying to figure out jetpacks.

812
00:32:57,820 --> 00:33:03,380
Yes. To use in combat, which is so crazy to just imagine a war.

813
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:04,860
I don't know with who.

814
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:08,220
Well, at that point in time, the first one up would have been Vietnam.

815
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:15,420
So at that time, jetpacks or well, landing in a more recent jetpack thing.

816
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:17,900
There's a I'll show it to you after this if you haven't seen it.

817
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:21,420
But there's a new new version of a jetpack or newish version.

818
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:25,940
And the video online that's showing off what it can do is a person

819
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:30,380
basically leaving a small boat and landing on an aircraft carrier.

820
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:32,380
Whoa. In this thing.

821
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:34,660
Oh, my God. Which is pretty insane.

822
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:36,780
And I've seen some of these videos recently.

823
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:39,620
I've seen like water versions of the jetpack where you have like

824
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:43,020
kind of like Iron Man Gauntlet type things that shoot water out.

825
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:44,620
But there are still oh, yeah.

826
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:48,860
Newer versions that have just of jetpack was not water based.

827
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:52,620
Well, that's the I must at some point in the five years of the show reference

828
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:55,140
from my favorite videos, the starts right now.

829
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:56,300
Do you know what I'm talking about?

830
00:33:56,300 --> 00:34:01,100
How there's a guy on a water jetpack who's going to open up the local news.

831
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:04,340
And he goes, all right, and it's live at five and it starts.

832
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:07,300
And then they hand it to the guy and he goes, it starts right now.

833
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:08,380
And then he gone on.

834
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:12,740
Now he just collapses into the dock and they zoom away.

835
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:14,340
They crash zoom out.

836
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:17,540
Yeah. To be ready for his incredible flight.

837
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:20,060
But instead, he just falls into the water.

838
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:23,820
But then they do the like action news and then come back.

839
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:27,100
And now it's working and he's flying with the most demented smile

840
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:28,380
you've ever seen.

841
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:30,060
So it worked out and they applaud.

842
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:30,900
I haven't seen that.

843
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:32,420
Oh, it's one of my favorite. Oh, God.

844
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:35,980
The one every any time I've ever seen a water jetpack out in the world,

845
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:37,860
I've said, oh, it's a starts right now.

846
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:39,060
Wow. I got to see that.

847
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:40,020
I don't think I've seen this.

848
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:41,900
Oh, wow.

849
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:43,220
So all right.

850
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:44,900
So there are versions of this.

851
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:46,580
This particular thing was the rocket belt.

852
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:51,540
This was the army went so far with this that they did a demonstration to JFK.

853
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:53,380
He watched.

854
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:55,580
Here's what a rocket belt could be like.

855
00:34:56,860 --> 00:35:02,460
Issue was they could only fly for 20 seconds.

856
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:04,140
Yeah, yes.

857
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:10,100
Uh, and that's just not that's maybe not worth like the millions of dollars

858
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:12,740
to give all the soldiers shipwrecks.

859
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:14,300
Like, what does it really do?

860
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:19,100
Unless it's such a like a kid's idea of a war where like we have to.

861
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:21,820
There's a wall. We have to scale the wall.

862
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:22,980
How can we do it?

863
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:26,660
Yeah, I mean, I think unless you have like full Iron Man,

864
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:29,180
like you can go that fast, you can go that high.

865
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,260
You're that flexible.

866
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:33,500
I don't know that it makes a lot of sense.

867
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:37,260
If I'm putting my generals cap on here to strategize.

868
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:38,780
But I played video games.

869
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:39,900
I played video games.

870
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:42,420
Yeah, you've sent a fake man to die.

871
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:45,060
That's correct. Red Alert Command and Conquer.

872
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:47,140
Oh, sure. OK, OK. Yeah.

873
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:51,380
Anyways, so it just didn't.

874
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:54,740
Also, the way anyway, the way this guy Bill Suter got involved

875
00:35:54,740 --> 00:36:01,380
is that they needed a just a guy to do it with no experience.

876
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:04,780
That was the requirement is that you have no rocket experience.

877
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:08,420
Not what Buzz Aldrin wants you to have.

878
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:11,700
All you need is no rocket experience.

879
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:14,620
He lived next door to the guy.

880
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:16,740
Oh, that was. Yeah, he lived next door.

881
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:19,620
The guy might think he mowed his lawn.

882
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:21,180
That's what I read. I went in an interview with him

883
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:23,100
and he was like, I just live next door to this guy.

884
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:28,580
Was that the interview promoting his one man performance piece?

885
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:30,580
One hell of a ride. Oh, my God.

886
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:31,500
I don't know.

887
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:34,020
I was like doing a speech called One Hell of a Ride.

888
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:35,340
Oh, I got to find this.

889
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:37,580
I got to find the article again.

890
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:40,500
So he just yeah, it had to because that's what it was going to be in the army.

891
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:43,620
It was just we need to give these jet packs to, you know, to dummies

892
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:45,180
fresh off the truck.

893
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:47,540
We got to like, all right, there's a rocket.

894
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:48,780
Can you do it? Go.

895
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:52,820
So he fit the requirement and in the process became the most skilled

896
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:55,260
jet packer around.

897
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:58,460
And then with this type of the rocket bill, like nobody's been.

898
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:01,460
There was one other guy maybe in the two of them were friends.

899
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:05,260
So any other thing, we would always be these two guys.

900
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:07,900
And basically, because the army retired the program,

901
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:12,540
it just became only for entertainment for this Walt Disney thing.

902
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:15,580
The maybe the most famous use of it.

903
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:19,740
Thunderball James Bond movie.

904
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:23,420
Sean, it's a Sean Connery era bond.

905
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:29,300
And he there's it's mixed with, you know, bad close ups of Connery pretending to do it.

906
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:34,500
But then there is practical jet pack footage and it's the same guy, Bill Suter.

907
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:37,300
And he's wearing the helmet and they tried to talk him out of the helmet,

908
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:39,380
apparently in the movie.

909
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:44,220
Wait, I believe that if I have the story right, is that they he's wearing

910
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:47,700
like a helmet in the movie and they were like, can you please take the helmet off?

911
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:50,540
And he was like, no, I want to wear the helmet.

912
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:56,420
Oh, you mean for like, oh, for like safe for his own safety.

913
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:57,220
Yeah, please.

914
00:37:57,220 --> 00:37:58,180
Oh, no, no, no, no.

915
00:37:58,180 --> 00:38:00,820
Doesn't match the shot.

916
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:01,820
Or it's like he needs to.

917
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:02,540
Yeah. So wait.

918
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:04,620
So then they made Connery.

919
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:06,820
They felt like James Bond would not wear.

920
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:07,860
I got to go back and look at the clip.

921
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:09,940
But that's what he's saying is that they were arguing with him.

922
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:14,860
I found the quote about the he more more recruited his lawn boy

923
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:16,580
as a guinea pig joked suitor.

924
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:20,300
Oh, my God.

925
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:22,700
I don't know some dumbass.

926
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:26,140
I had some some kid, some neighbor, a bowl here.

927
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:27,740
His neighbor was Wendell Moore.

928
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:30,260
Yeah. So he was a 19 year old kid mowing this guy's lawn.

929
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:32,140
And they were like, hey, you want to get in the rocket?

930
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:34,100
You want to get in the jet pack?

931
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:36,740
So the world's going to lose another grass cutter.

932
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:38,300
Yeah. Yeah.

933
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:43,700
Would put hydrogen peroxide and put pure hydrogen peroxide in his kid's backpack.

934
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:45,860
Let's see what happens.

935
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:47,620
Pretty crazy.

936
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:51,620
And then what an incredible gift, because he became the only guy

937
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:54,540
who does this or, you know, it's two. Right.

938
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:58,340
So there's other and these these are not immediately familiar to me,

939
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:01,940
but incredibly prominent uses out in the world.

940
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:05,060
The very first Super Bowl halftime show

941
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:09,380
was this guy and his buddy flying around and again for only 20 seconds.

942
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:12,060
So that's not too much of a show.

943
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:14,100
But they were still figuring it out back then.

944
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:18,940
Hey, they were still doing Elvis Presto, the Elvis magician in 1987.

945
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:21,300
They were not quite at that.

946
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:22,780
Just a good band plays.

947
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:24,060
Yeah. Here, let me hear.

948
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:26,420
This is what he's in his own words on the James Bond thing.

949
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:28,580
His mission escape a Chateau's third.

950
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:30,580
This is James Bond. Third floor balcony.

951
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:34,060
Scoot over the castle wall and land near the waiting Aston Martin.

952
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:36,900
The director begged the flyboys not to wear their helmets.

953
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:40,260
It didn't match the shot of Connery, but they refused.

954
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:43,900
The March Day was chilly, which caused ignition problems on a second flight.

955
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:47,460
I hit cobblestones like a ton of bricks and bounced in the air.

956
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:50,460
So it told me it wasn't a pretty landing.

957
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:53,060
Is it in the movie?

958
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:54,900
I don't know. I don't know the sequence well enough.

959
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:56,100
I'm not really a Bond guy.

960
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:58,100
Yeah, I like Bond, but I'm not a Bond guy either.

961
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:00,500
Yeah, I don't know.

962
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:02,140
It cobbles.

963
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:04,860
Oh, I don't think they would put that wipe out in the movie,

964
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:06,380
but maybe it is in there.

965
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:07,420
They had no choice.

966
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:08,460
That's just what it was.

967
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:11,140
But yeah, it doesn't feel like Bond, like Bond would do it perfectly.

968
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:13,780
That's that gets smart.

969
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:16,740
Oh, yeah, yeah, right, right.

970
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:21,420
So anyways, these just use like an entertainer.

971
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:22,620
Yeah, Rocket Man.

972
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:25,460
He opened the 1984 Olympics.

973
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:26,820
Yes, which is awesome.

974
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:28,260
Yes, yeah, it was awesome.

975
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:30,180
L.A. Coliseum.

976
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:31,620
Yeah, it's so exciting.

977
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:34,060
That stage, which is the most like,

978
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:38,900
you know, Disney, the 80s, Goddy,

979
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:41,540
like, boy, the color uses at that thing already.

980
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:43,740
I love the 84 Olympics so much.

981
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:46,580
I didn't even know there was Rocket Belt at it.

982
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:48,380
Yeah, it's crazy.

983
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:49,660
For the Coliseum is huge.

984
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:50,780
There's so many people there.

985
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:52,100
It looks so cool.

986
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:55,740
And again, it's like now watching and I still have since it looks

987
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:57,380
just like that Disneyland footage.

988
00:40:57,380 --> 00:41:00,420
I still kind of I'm like, that's it looks fake to me.

989
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:03,020
Yeah, because I was so used to thinking that was fake.

990
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:05,420
There's something about it.

991
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:07,620
I think it is such a like,

992
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:11,020
it does feel like some weird Lost in Space contraption or something

993
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:14,500
to where I think like the odd and the janky way it's built,

994
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:17,380
because it's not like beautiful, it's functional.

995
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:21,780
So it feels like a silly sci fi prop, which I think maybe makes you think

996
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:23,380
it's just for tricks.

997
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:27,140
I think it's that mixed with the fact that it's a pretty imprecise

998
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:30,700
feeling of flying, even though it is good.

999
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:32,740
And he's not like zooming up and down or whatever.

1000
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:38,220
But it's not like it doesn't feel like it's on some like perfect flight path.

1001
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:42,780
It feels like it feels like it would if you were just hauling a guy on a wire.

1002
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:46,380
Yeah, it feels like this kind of weird thing, like it's being pulled by a wire.

1003
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:49,700
Like there's something about the movement that also makes me feel it.

1004
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:51,300
Make it makes it feel fake.

1005
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:55,500
I think maybe I thought that this was some that they paired this up

1006
00:41:55,500 --> 00:42:00,140
with the Tinkerbell on the wire and that they also did a space man.

1007
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:02,820
I thought maybe this was when they opened

1008
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:07,420
people move a rocket jets, all that that well, then let's put an astronaut on.

1009
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:10,740
Because it is so yeah, it does feel like smooth wire flying.

1010
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:12,420
Right, right, right, right.

1011
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:16,140
It's great. It's wonderful that it's real and that James Bond had a real

1012
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:17,820
rocket belt in it.

1013
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:21,900
It's all very magical and so silly that this thing existed.

1014
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:24,540
But then, like, listen to what we're describing.

1015
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:29,380
He does the 67 Super Bowl and the 84 halftime show.

1016
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:32,300
I'm sorry, the Olympics.

1017
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:34,580
That's not a lot right.

1018
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:36,060
And the army's not using it.

1019
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:39,940
I don't know what Bill Souter is up to day to day exactly.

1020
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:43,500
But rocket belts are not exactly taking over the culture

1021
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:48,580
until the early 90s, when some gentleman in Texas

1022
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:51,060
made a go at bringing the thing back.

1023
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:53,580
Do you have any idea any of what I'm about to say?

1024
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:56,820
I was reading about the history of jetpacks, but I don't know.

1025
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:59,700
I don't know at first blush, so I don't think I do.

1026
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:01,540
I'm excited about it.

1027
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:04,340
But I have more about what's his name, too, though, about Souter.

1028
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:06,180
We'll get to the end. OK. OK.

1029
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:08,460
Yeah. Well, he's look, I'm not done with Souter.

1030
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:12,300
So you might have crossed over some of this, but I have boy.

1031
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:14,500
Am I excited about what's coming?

1032
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:18,540
So it's it's Houston, Texas.

1033
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:19,900
It's the early 90s.

1034
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:25,540
There is an entrepreneur who loved that thunderball sequence.

1035
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:29,900
I described so much and dreamt of the day that he could make

1036
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:33,260
bring back the rocket belt and do it better for real.

1037
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:38,140
He paired up with an inventor, a scientific mind, whatever you want to call it.

1038
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:40,860
And they and then and then a third partner,

1039
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:44,020
they ran the operation out of this guy's failing stereo store.

1040
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:49,140
And they figured out successfully

1041
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:55,260
how to make a rocket belt that goes way past that 20 second limit.

1042
00:43:55,580 --> 00:43:57,780
This one goes 30 seconds.

1043
00:43:57,780 --> 00:43:59,780
Yeah, I did see that. I did see that. Yeah.

1044
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:01,980
They made it.

1045
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:04,860
And this one, this is the rocket belt of the future.

1046
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:07,740
It is called the R.B. 2000.

1047
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:09,580
I am. Yeah.

1048
00:44:10,620 --> 00:44:14,940
So the future is bright, right?

1049
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:17,580
We figured out it's 30.

1050
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:19,300
It's 30 seconds now.

1051
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:20,460
We have everything we need.

1052
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:23,660
The stereo store, we're bringing back the rocket belt better than ever.

1053
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:28,220
And the only thing that brought down this operation is that every single person

1054
00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:30,780
involved was fucking insane.

1055
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:33,820
This was did you find out?

1056
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:35,340
You know what I'm doing? I don't know what you're doing.

1057
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:38,060
I am. Yeah, you're telling me this stuff for the first time.

1058
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:41,020
But I know that the other stuff. Yeah. So.

1059
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:43,660
Yeah, I'm going to. All right.

1060
00:44:43,660 --> 00:44:45,620
I'm going to describe three guys and I don't.

1061
00:44:45,620 --> 00:44:47,820
The names are not going to stick with you.

1062
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:49,740
I was going to get confused by the names.

1063
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:52,580
So I'm going to tell you, yeah, kind of what they looked like.

1064
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:54,780
One. OK, I'm going to call Silver Fox.

1065
00:44:55,340 --> 00:44:57,460
One is schlubby guy.

1066
00:44:57,780 --> 00:45:00,300
And then third guy, it doesn't matter what he looks like.

1067
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:01,420
He factors in a little bit.

1068
00:45:01,420 --> 00:45:04,500
But just picture kind of like Svelte Silver Fox and then sort of

1069
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:07,060
angry schlubby guy.

1070
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:09,460
They fought all the time.

1071
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:10,900
They fought over money.

1072
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:12,980
They accused each other of stealing.

1073
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:15,460
This operation was coming apart at the seams.

1074
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:20,140
The third guy on the stereo store was addicted to crystal meth.

1075
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:26,380
Schlubby guy accused Silver Fox of stealing money from the company.

1076
00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:28,340
And things got really heated.

1077
00:45:28,340 --> 00:45:33,420
So Silver Fox got a hammer and hit schlubby guy in the back of the head.

1078
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:36,580
I do not see any of this.

1079
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:40,340
They've got a belt of the in-fighting amongst the top

1080
00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:42,580
rocket belt mines of the early 90s.

1081
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:45,860
God knocks him on the back of the head.

1082
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:49,500
I don't know if it literally went straight from bang bang to this.

1083
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:54,860
But Silver Fox flees with the rocket belt to not be seen again.

1084
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:56,580
They don't know what happened to it.

1085
00:45:56,580 --> 00:45:57,500
Where's the belt?

1086
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:58,700
The belt is gone.

1087
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:02,780
And schlubby guy, this is like he's built all of his dreams on this.

1088
00:46:03,580 --> 00:46:06,780
He sunk his own money into it without the rocket belt.

1089
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:08,860
I am sunk. I have to get it back.

1090
00:46:08,860 --> 00:46:11,500
How can I find out what happened to it?

1091
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:15,300
Then it's 1995.

1092
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:19,300
The Houston Rockets have won the NBA Championship

1093
00:46:19,660 --> 00:46:24,540
and schlubby guy turns on TV, watches the victory celebration

1094
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:28,940
in which a rocket belt is propelling a man

1095
00:46:29,260 --> 00:46:33,420
from across a harbor or something in Houston,

1096
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:36,020
where he lands at the victory celebration.

1097
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:38,660
A 30 second flight. He did it.

1098
00:46:38,780 --> 00:46:40,260
The man's name, you ask.

1099
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:43,460
Bill Suter, the Disneyland Rocket Man.

1100
00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:45,540
They got Suter. They got him.

1101
00:46:45,540 --> 00:46:47,020
They got the rocket belt.

1102
00:46:47,020 --> 00:46:48,620
I'm getting schlubby guy out of here.

1103
00:46:48,620 --> 00:46:51,060
I'm getting a hold of Suter and we're going to do the best.

1104
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:53,500
We're going to celebrate the Houston Rockets.

1105
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:55,740
Akima Lajuan, this is for you.

1106
00:46:55,860 --> 00:46:59,420
This is so funny because whatever I was reading left out the hammer stuff

1107
00:46:59,980 --> 00:47:02,260
because I know that Suter in the game there.

1108
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:03,740
It's like I missed the interesting.

1109
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:05,260
You did get to that part. OK.

1110
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:07,620
Yeah, no, no, no. This was his final.

1111
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:10,660
Right. But I was reading that it was because there was this

1112
00:47:11,020 --> 00:47:12,220
because there was a fight.

1113
00:47:12,220 --> 00:47:13,900
The Maxwell hammer.

1114
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:15,180
A guy who was wrong.

1115
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:16,860
He I don't know if he was stealing money or not,

1116
00:47:16,860 --> 00:47:19,420
but you shouldn't hit somebody in the back of the head with a hammer

1117
00:47:19,660 --> 00:47:21,500
and then steal your co-invention.

1118
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:23,500
The rock. I agree. I completely agree.

1119
00:47:24,140 --> 00:47:27,700
Wow. So this tells schlubby guy,

1120
00:47:28,540 --> 00:47:30,580
oh, my God, it's out there.

1121
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:33,540
I so all right. I have proof it's in Houston.

1122
00:47:33,540 --> 00:47:34,460
Maybe I can do this.

1123
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:35,780
I can get this thing back.

1124
00:47:35,780 --> 00:47:39,780
But Bill Suter hands Silver Fox the rocket belt.

1125
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:41,020
All right. That was fun.

1126
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:43,460
Silver Fox leaves never to be seen again.

1127
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:44,700
Not never. He's seen again.

1128
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:45,820
Yeah. Rocket belt.

1129
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:48,540
Bill Suter, the rocket man, never sees the rocket right again.

1130
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:52,140
So schlubby guy is angry.

1131
00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:57,820
He takes Silver Fox to court and sues him for ten million dollars

1132
00:47:57,820 --> 00:48:00,300
and custody of the rocket belt.

1133
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:02,060
And he will win.

1134
00:48:02,060 --> 00:48:03,580
I think maybe. Yeah.

1135
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:04,740
After what he's been through,

1136
00:48:04,740 --> 00:48:06,460
John joined in the head with a hammer.

1137
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:08,740
Yeah, they don't have to share.

1138
00:48:08,740 --> 00:48:10,260
I get it on weekends.

1139
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:11,420
I fly on weekends.

1140
00:48:11,420 --> 00:48:15,820
No, you're just the rocket belt will be told what Silver Fox was like.

1141
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:18,740
You don't know. You don't get to hear about your other daddy.

1142
00:48:18,740 --> 00:48:20,620
He's a bad man.

1143
00:48:21,220 --> 00:48:23,780
So he won. He won custody.

1144
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:28,660
Silver Fox, you need to give schlubby guy the rocket belt and ten million dollars.

1145
00:48:29,060 --> 00:48:35,780
Instead, he stays away and gone and nobody can find him.

1146
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:37,500
And he doesn't give ten million dollars.

1147
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:39,700
And he certainly doesn't give the rocket belt.

1148
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:45,140
So until one day, Silver Fox gets a call about a potential Hollywood

1149
00:48:45,140 --> 00:48:48,460
use of his rocket belt and he thinks, oh, yes, a job.

1150
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:50,980
Showcase, the rocket belt can do.

1151
00:48:50,980 --> 00:48:56,620
He walks into some mansion and the four guys there are really edgy

1152
00:48:56,700 --> 00:49:00,140
and they grab him and put like a hood over him.

1153
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:05,180
And the next thing you know, it this got Silver Fox is in a box.

1154
00:49:05,740 --> 00:49:08,460
Silver Fox is stuck in a box in a box.

1155
00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:10,340
The Fox is in a box.

1156
00:49:10,340 --> 00:49:13,180
My God. Kill Bill.

1157
00:49:13,780 --> 00:49:18,340
Yes. Yeah, it's really it's really close to being buried alive.

1158
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:19,780
Jesus. It's terrifying.

1159
00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:21,980
This is by the way, I'm skimming a Wikipedia.

1160
00:49:21,980 --> 00:49:23,340
I'm seeing some stuff.

1161
00:49:23,340 --> 00:49:28,740
And then I saw the phrase trapped in a box and I went, wow, hang on back up.

1162
00:49:28,820 --> 00:49:31,860
And this is happening concurrently with member a few episodes ago

1163
00:49:32,020 --> 00:49:34,980
when I said I was listening to those women who were saying that Disney's

1164
00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:38,460
putting woke agenda into the movie and their friend forced to the right.

1165
00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:43,860
As that is happening, I'm reading the phrase Jetpack Man trapped in a box.

1166
00:49:44,740 --> 00:49:47,820
This is I am I getting covid right now?

1167
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:49,980
Am I delirious? This is too much stuff.

1168
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:56,820
So anyway, this guy is kept in a box for eight days.

1169
00:49:56,900 --> 00:49:59,900
He is not fed. He thinks he is going to die.

1170
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:02,980
Yeah. And the only thing that can get him out of the box

1171
00:50:02,980 --> 00:50:05,980
is revealing the location of the rocket belt.

1172
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:11,100
Eventually, it's revealed that if you can guess who was behind it, Schlubby guy.

1173
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:15,020
He shows up with like a notary and like, you're going to sign this

1174
00:50:15,020 --> 00:50:17,100
and you're going to give me the rocket belt.

1175
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:19,980
But they aren't looking at a certain point and he escapes.

1176
00:50:20,060 --> 00:50:21,620
He runs out.

1177
00:50:21,620 --> 00:50:23,740
He gets a hold of the FBI.

1178
00:50:23,740 --> 00:50:24,500
Oh, my God.

1179
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:28,700
They get Schlubby guy and all his accomplices and they go to jail

1180
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:32,020
for making Jetpack Silver Fox be in a box.

1181
00:50:32,220 --> 00:50:34,580
Whoa. Oh, my God.

1182
00:50:34,580 --> 00:50:37,260
All the craziest bullshit ever.

1183
00:50:37,460 --> 00:50:39,820
And I skipped one detail.

1184
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:42,980
The third guy I talked about with the meth addiction,

1185
00:50:42,980 --> 00:50:47,060
who was also involved in all this at some point in all of these events.

1186
00:50:47,340 --> 00:50:49,140
He was bludgeoned to death.

1187
00:50:49,140 --> 00:50:52,260
Oh, my God. Probably by Schlubby guy.

1188
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:53,340
I don't know.

1189
00:50:53,340 --> 00:50:55,820
You would assume, but it's not actually allegedly.

1190
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:57,260
I'm not even saying that.

1191
00:50:57,260 --> 00:50:59,540
I'm going to second gate for this one.

1192
00:50:59,540 --> 00:51:00,780
It's you know, this is out.

1193
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:03,260
This has been well, look, this story is out there.

1194
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:07,700
Yeah. You can track all of this in an Atlas Obscura article called

1195
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:10,540
Where Eagles Dare, the Jetpack Murder.

1196
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:12,100
Oh, my God.

1197
00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:16,940
You can also look up an ABC news story from the year that this all happened.

1198
00:51:17,180 --> 00:51:22,540
They a news story that is narrated by ABC reporter Chris Cuomo.

1199
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:24,220
Whoa.

1200
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:26,740
Wow. He's like young and fresh, I bet.

1201
00:51:26,740 --> 00:51:28,420
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Real eager.

1202
00:51:28,420 --> 00:51:30,340
And yeah, I'm going to do a good job.

1203
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:31,140
Not weird.

1204
00:51:31,140 --> 00:51:34,020
And I just want to talk about the jetpack box.

1205
00:51:34,060 --> 00:51:35,020
That's wild.

1206
00:51:35,020 --> 00:51:39,140
Anyway, the jetpack has never known to this day.

1207
00:51:39,140 --> 00:51:41,780
Nobody has ever seen the rocket belt again.

1208
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:46,140
The name of the episode Disneyland Rocket Man Bill Suter.

1209
00:51:46,140 --> 00:51:48,300
He said, I don't want any part of it.

1210
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:50,660
I don't ever want to touch a rocket belt again.

1211
00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:53,060
I want no further involvement in the project.

1212
00:51:53,060 --> 00:51:55,020
It's not worth my life.

1213
00:51:55,020 --> 00:52:00,060
The so the quote I have from Bill, I don't know if it's in reference to that.

1214
00:52:01,060 --> 00:52:04,420
He said, this is so this made me so sad.

1215
00:52:04,420 --> 00:52:07,500
He goes, I'd like to keep the idea of jetpacks alive.

1216
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:10,740
Suter said when we spoke, but I've become a nonbeliever.

1217
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:18,060
So it feels like the death of the of the optimism of the 60s age of the space age.

1218
00:52:18,060 --> 00:52:20,540
Yeah, this is and this is really this is from this year.

1219
00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:24,100
This article is January 24th, 2022.

1220
00:52:24,540 --> 00:52:26,740
And I believe he's 77 years old.

1221
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:31,420
This guy's going this guy doesn't have a lot of years left and he's going to go.

1222
00:52:31,420 --> 00:52:36,820
He's he he might pass with disbelief, even though we all saw it.

1223
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:38,300
We've all we all saw it.

1224
00:52:38,580 --> 00:52:42,860
Even though we all saw it, we've all we all watched him at Disneyland.

1225
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:44,460
Walt talked about it.

1226
00:52:44,460 --> 00:52:45,660
He did do it.

1227
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:49,020
Do we think we could get him up in the air for like a live show of ours?

1228
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:53,620
Whoa. Like, why are they doing this outdoor show?

1229
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:55,900
Why did they think they could fill the Greek?

1230
00:52:55,900 --> 00:52:58,420
They must be losing a lot of money.

1231
00:52:58,420 --> 00:52:59,620
For sure, we will.

1232
00:52:59,620 --> 00:53:01,780
Oh, look, I'm popping away.

1233
00:53:01,780 --> 00:53:04,540
It's a 77 year old man in the sky.

1234
00:53:04,540 --> 00:53:07,700
Oh, my God. If we could say ladies and gentlemen, Bill,

1235
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:10,500
so this guy's a fucking legend.

1236
00:53:11,020 --> 00:53:13,220
I apologize for cursing, but he is.

1237
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:14,620
I think he let you.

1238
00:53:14,620 --> 00:53:16,340
He deserves that.

1239
00:53:16,340 --> 00:53:18,740
He rules. I love Bill Suter.

1240
00:53:18,740 --> 00:53:21,300
I love that he is just a cool guy in all this.

1241
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:24,260
He's not in these fucking criminals.

1242
00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:25,740
Every one of them.

1243
00:53:25,740 --> 00:53:27,340
Well, I guess that no, well, you should.

1244
00:53:27,340 --> 00:53:28,940
You can't do crystal meth.

1245
00:53:28,940 --> 00:53:29,980
Yeah, that guy is a criminal.

1246
00:53:29,980 --> 00:53:31,100
Nobody deserved to die.

1247
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:31,660
Nobody is.

1248
00:53:31,660 --> 00:53:34,100
Jog should be maybe decriminalized.

1249
00:53:34,100 --> 00:53:36,660
What's a drug should be maybe to be decriminalized.

1250
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:37,500
OK, yeah.

1251
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:41,740
But for his own sake, you probably shouldn't have crystal meth.

1252
00:53:41,740 --> 00:53:42,340
But you're right.

1253
00:53:42,340 --> 00:53:43,060
And I'm just saying.

1254
00:53:43,060 --> 00:53:44,260
Certainly shouldn't have been blood.

1255
00:53:44,260 --> 00:53:45,660
None of this should have had. This is all bad.

1256
00:53:45,660 --> 00:53:48,340
These three guys were just not meant for each other.

1257
00:53:48,780 --> 00:53:50,340
But that's not Bill Suter's fault.

1258
00:53:50,340 --> 00:53:52,020
He just got to fly around.

1259
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:56,060
And by the way, if you're thinking that that story that I just described,

1260
00:53:56,100 --> 00:53:59,380
that sounds so crazy, I wouldn't believe it if it was in a movie.

1261
00:53:59,620 --> 00:54:02,340
That sounds like it could be a pretty interesting movie.

1262
00:54:02,620 --> 00:54:05,340
It was a movie in 2008.

1263
00:54:05,540 --> 00:54:07,620
The movie is called Pretty Bird.

1264
00:54:07,940 --> 00:54:09,300
You have not heard of it.

1265
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:11,660
I have not heard of it

1266
00:54:11,660 --> 00:54:15,420
in the role of a guy, Paul G.

1267
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:17,940
Amati. Wow, really? Yes.

1268
00:54:17,940 --> 00:54:19,340
We got to watch this fucking movie.

1269
00:54:19,340 --> 00:54:21,020
The ultimate schlubby guy.

1270
00:54:21,020 --> 00:54:24,340
I thought about the entire time saying, imagine like, I don't know,

1271
00:54:24,820 --> 00:54:26,700
a Paul G. Amati.

1272
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:28,940
I thought that might be too confusing to track.

1273
00:54:28,940 --> 00:54:30,820
Apologies to the guy for calling him schlubby guy.

1274
00:54:30,820 --> 00:54:32,940
But also he did a lot of bad. He put a guy in a box.

1275
00:54:33,380 --> 00:54:34,580
Sure. Sure.

1276
00:54:34,580 --> 00:54:39,700
So that schlubby guy and in the role of Silver Fox, Billy Crudup.

1277
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:41,500
Wow. Really?

1278
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:45,420
This is a meeting of the minds that I am very excited about because I love G.

1279
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:48,660
Amati. Yeah. Nilo Nimalato himself. Yeah.

1280
00:54:49,340 --> 00:54:50,420
Billy Crudup.

1281
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:53,420
I had no particular feeling about until the last few years.

1282
00:54:53,740 --> 00:54:54,820
And I just want to say this.

1283
00:54:54,820 --> 00:54:57,220
I think Eva Anderson will join me in this.

1284
00:54:57,500 --> 00:54:59,980
If you are not watching

1285
00:55:00,940 --> 00:55:04,020
Billy Crudup's Emmy winning performance

1286
00:55:04,580 --> 00:55:07,740
as thousand toothed agent of chaos,

1287
00:55:07,740 --> 00:55:12,620
Corey Ellison, major executive at UBA on the morning show,

1288
00:55:12,620 --> 00:55:14,300
then I don't know what you're doing.

1289
00:55:14,300 --> 00:55:16,060
I don't know. Everybody's binging.

1290
00:55:16,060 --> 00:55:17,820
Look, I know Saul is around there.

1291
00:55:17,820 --> 00:55:20,220
Well, weeks ago when this comes out.

1292
00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:21,740
Look, there's been there's been a lot of shows.

1293
00:55:21,740 --> 00:55:22,620
I know there's a lot of shows.

1294
00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:23,500
Everybody's talking about seven.

1295
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:26,820
But but just flip one over from Severance

1296
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:31,860
and see a man with the most teeth you've ever seen in his mouth

1297
00:55:32,260 --> 00:55:37,220
and the biggest dream jetpack size dreams of starting up a streamer called UBA.

1298
00:55:38,220 --> 00:55:39,780
Check out truly.

1299
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:41,940
I'm fascinated by Billy Crudup.

1300
00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:44,260
And now you're really high on this movie because of this.

1301
00:55:44,260 --> 00:55:46,460
I am unfortunately. I see it.

1302
00:55:46,460 --> 00:55:48,540
I watched the movie. I did rent the movie.

1303
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:49,860
OK, it's pretty sleep.

1304
00:55:49,860 --> 00:55:54,060
I can see why nobody it's also got Kristen Wigg in it and just a thankless

1305
00:55:54,060 --> 00:55:56,260
kind of like and then you're the girl.

1306
00:55:56,260 --> 00:55:57,580
Like she doesn't know it.

1307
00:55:57,580 --> 00:56:00,540
She doesn't none of what we know Kristen Wigg for. Right.

1308
00:56:01,140 --> 00:56:03,780
This movie is written and directed by Paul Schneider,

1309
00:56:04,340 --> 00:56:08,500
early Parks and Rec cast member like that guy from the first couple years.

1310
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:09,660
Couple years. Yeah.

1311
00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:13,980
He wrote and directed a movie about the jetpack murders.

1312
00:56:13,980 --> 00:56:15,660
Yes. Oh, my God.

1313
00:56:15,660 --> 00:56:18,140
So this exists out there. It's rentable.

1314
00:56:18,140 --> 00:56:19,820
If you want to watch that, do it.

1315
00:56:19,820 --> 00:56:22,740
If you want to watch Chris Cuomo tell the story

1316
00:56:23,460 --> 00:56:26,980
or if you just want to, you know, hear it the way we told it

1317
00:56:26,980 --> 00:56:30,580
with these disparaging names, not Silver Fox.

1318
00:56:30,580 --> 00:56:34,100
That's a guy I want to dress him up because I like Billy Crudup so much.

1319
00:56:34,100 --> 00:56:38,340
Yeah, I wanted to honor him with a cool name, even though he hit a guy with a hammer.

1320
00:56:38,340 --> 00:56:41,420
And there's the hammer, but you can forgive it because he's handsome.

1321
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:44,780
He's a handsome guy. It's OK.

1322
00:56:44,780 --> 00:56:49,820
It's wow. The movie, the only it's so not interesting

1323
00:56:49,820 --> 00:56:53,420
unless they're saying the word rocket belt, which thankfully is a lot.

1324
00:56:53,420 --> 00:56:56,940
Yeah, yeah. Like that's it's G.M.O.T.Y.

1325
00:56:56,940 --> 00:56:58,660
like hugging crude up and like,

1326
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:02,180
we could have been friends, we could have been friends.

1327
00:57:02,180 --> 00:57:04,940
You and I. Where's the rocket belt?

1328
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:08,020
Where's the fucking rocket belt?

1329
00:57:08,980 --> 00:57:10,220
Like, that's all pretty good.

1330
00:57:10,220 --> 00:57:11,780
Yeah, that sounds good.

1331
00:57:11,780 --> 00:57:14,060
You say it's sleazy, but that sounds good.

1332
00:57:14,060 --> 00:57:16,620
So you're saying the rocket belt has not been found.

1333
00:57:16,860 --> 00:57:18,140
No, that right. Yes.

1334
00:57:18,140 --> 00:57:21,540
The guy answers the question by saying, you never know.

1335
00:57:21,620 --> 00:57:23,540
So we got to get suitor up in the jet pack.

1336
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:25,020
We have to find the jet pack.

1337
00:57:25,020 --> 00:57:26,700
We have to find this jet pack first.

1338
00:57:26,700 --> 00:57:29,220
The rocket belt. Yeah, yeah.

1339
00:57:29,220 --> 00:57:29,980
And what's that?

1340
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:32,340
Maybe can we would he come on with?

1341
00:57:32,340 --> 00:57:34,380
Should I say his real name?

1342
00:57:36,220 --> 00:57:38,140
I want to get everyone involved on this.

1343
00:57:38,140 --> 00:57:40,580
I mean, sooner we could probably get I think sooner we could get.

1344
00:57:40,620 --> 00:57:42,940
Yeah, he might want to avoid a lot of this unpleasant.

1345
00:57:44,460 --> 00:57:47,100
Brad Barker is the name of Billy.

1346
00:57:47,100 --> 00:57:48,700
All right. OK.

1347
00:57:50,140 --> 00:57:51,860
I don't know. He's not going to answer any.

1348
00:57:51,860 --> 00:57:54,020
He's not going to tell us where the rocket will talk about this.

1349
00:57:54,020 --> 00:57:55,860
Well, he might.

1350
00:57:55,860 --> 00:57:57,460
He might talk.

1351
00:57:57,460 --> 00:57:59,460
What if I don't know, just spit balling here.

1352
00:57:59,460 --> 00:58:03,140
What if you and I could get kind of like an enclosed space, like something small

1353
00:58:03,140 --> 00:58:07,580
and put that put Brad in it and like, I don't know.

1354
00:58:07,580 --> 00:58:08,580
It's not coming to me.

1355
00:58:08,580 --> 00:58:10,700
Like, can we put him in

1356
00:58:12,380 --> 00:58:13,900
maybe a box?

1357
00:58:14,540 --> 00:58:15,260
What did you just say?

1358
00:58:15,260 --> 00:58:17,340
We'd see that again. Maybe a box.

1359
00:58:17,340 --> 00:58:19,060
A box. My God.

1360
00:58:19,060 --> 00:58:21,500
That's the most brilliant idea since the invention of the rocket.

1361
00:58:22,740 --> 00:58:24,980
Hey, it just came to me.

1362
00:58:24,980 --> 00:58:27,580
There is now and now I'm regret.

1363
00:58:27,580 --> 00:58:30,540
I regret not looking into more of the different rocket

1364
00:58:30,780 --> 00:58:34,300
because I was going through Wikipedia and like there are some great names.

1365
00:58:34,300 --> 00:58:39,180
In 2013, Fritz Unger in Germany is developing a jetpack called Skyflash.

1366
00:58:40,180 --> 00:58:43,060
Fritz Unger from the odd couple.

1367
00:58:43,060 --> 00:58:44,060
Yes, Fritz.

1368
00:58:45,300 --> 00:58:47,300
So

1369
00:58:48,300 --> 00:58:49,940
Oh, Felix Unger.

1370
00:58:49,940 --> 00:58:50,660
It's almost there.

1371
00:58:50,660 --> 00:58:51,500
Almost there.

1372
00:58:52,340 --> 00:58:55,540
Flyboard Air invented by Frankie Zapata.

1373
00:58:57,420 --> 00:58:59,540
Like everyone's got a fun name that's involved.

1374
00:58:59,540 --> 00:59:01,500
Everyone's always got a good name.

1375
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:02,700
Yeah.

1376
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:05,100
There's Suter, the All Stars.

1377
00:59:05,340 --> 00:59:07,540
That's what we should. We should wait till we have.

1378
00:59:07,540 --> 00:59:10,100
Then we just weirdly, you know, you know, in Soarin,

1379
00:59:10,660 --> 00:59:14,860
that kind of humorless part of the line that's just kind of like a tribute to.

1380
00:59:14,860 --> 00:59:15,940
Yeah. Aviators.

1381
00:59:15,940 --> 00:59:19,620
Right. Right. That's we do an outdoor live show that just weirdly is like

1382
00:59:19,620 --> 00:59:24,820
they gave their lives for science and for man's dream to fly.

1383
00:59:25,420 --> 00:59:27,860
The audience is like, why?

1384
00:59:27,860 --> 00:59:30,780
What is with this oddly solemn?

1385
00:59:31,260 --> 00:59:34,460
And then a bunch of men come out and then we all give them pins.

1386
00:59:34,460 --> 00:59:36,060
They're meaningless.

1387
00:59:36,060 --> 00:59:38,620
OK, I've got a new idea to now for this show.

1388
00:59:39,620 --> 00:59:43,020
What we have to do is Jason has to start mowing Suter's lawn.

1389
00:59:43,460 --> 00:59:49,140
Oh, so he can pass on the tradition of jetpacking to Jason.

1390
00:59:49,140 --> 00:59:51,700
You there, boy. Yeah.

1391
00:59:51,700 --> 00:59:55,100
Now, is Jason significantly older than Suter was when he started mowing lawn?

1392
00:59:55,100 --> 00:59:57,020
Yes. Oh, yes. Yeah.

1393
00:59:57,020 --> 00:59:59,260
And is Jason be willing to mow a lawn?

1394
00:59:59,260 --> 01:00:01,420
No, not that I would.

1395
01:00:01,420 --> 01:00:04,420
One of these is not just maybe one of these newfangled electric ones

1396
01:00:04,420 --> 01:00:06,700
where it doesn't have the gas and it moves a lot easier.

1397
01:00:06,700 --> 01:00:08,820
But I used to mow a lawn once in a while.

1398
01:00:08,820 --> 01:00:12,780
OK, I pulled the thing and it was gas and give him a hydrogen peroxide

1399
01:00:12,780 --> 01:00:15,380
powered one, get him interested, because Jason would find that interesting.

1400
01:00:15,380 --> 01:00:17,820
Like, oh, and actually hydrogen peroxide powers this.

1401
01:00:18,180 --> 01:00:21,300
Yeah, it's like this rocket mower.

1402
01:00:21,740 --> 01:00:24,220
Well, if you're interested in that, why don't you?

1403
01:00:24,580 --> 01:00:26,140
I got something to show you.

1404
01:00:26,140 --> 01:00:31,340
And then Jason thinks that he's like a he's a crazy old guy, like Doc Brown.

1405
01:00:31,340 --> 01:00:34,500
Right. Oh, is this guy going to pull out a gun and shoot me?

1406
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:37,540
And then, no, he instead he unfurls a sheet.

1407
01:00:37,860 --> 01:00:42,140
And there it is, the original rocket belt in all its glory.

1408
01:00:42,140 --> 01:00:44,220
Jason would love it because he's a hype miser.

1409
01:00:44,220 --> 01:00:46,100
That's right. Yeah. He would like it.

1410
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:47,260
This would scare me, honestly.

1411
01:00:47,260 --> 01:00:49,420
Maybe I would do the water one, but probably not.

1412
01:00:49,660 --> 01:00:50,460
Could we get him in?

1413
01:00:50,460 --> 01:00:53,220
Could we do a live tandem

1414
01:00:53,820 --> 01:00:57,500
Jason and 76 year old jet belt legend

1415
01:00:58,260 --> 01:01:02,580
rocket belt legend Bill Suter in conversation

1416
01:01:05,180 --> 01:01:07,540
down at like the Disney concert hall or something?

1417
01:01:07,820 --> 01:01:10,340
Just to sit two seats on the stage.

1418
01:01:10,340 --> 01:01:13,260
Now, when you took the ultimate leap

1419
01:01:13,980 --> 01:01:17,340
of starting a theme park podcast with your friends, right?

1420
01:01:17,380 --> 01:01:20,500
How was it invigorating suitor interviewing mostly Jason?

1421
01:01:20,540 --> 01:01:20,820
Yes.

1422
01:01:20,820 --> 01:01:22,700
And questions.

1423
01:01:22,700 --> 01:01:25,980
Tell me about Scrapple.

1424
01:01:25,980 --> 01:01:27,940
Tell me the different flavors of Pedialyte.

1425
01:01:30,700 --> 01:01:32,020
Tell me about what they like.

1426
01:01:32,020 --> 01:01:36,380
How did you feel much better after the blue or the blue better?

1427
01:01:36,380 --> 01:01:38,580
Or was the darker blue better?

1428
01:01:38,660 --> 01:01:41,820
Yeah, all these are good ideas.

1429
01:01:41,820 --> 01:01:44,500
Hopefully Jason won't listen, but we'll we'll fill him in.

1430
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:48,900
Well, it'll be his ears will be red when he hears us praising these dirty astro.

1431
01:01:49,340 --> 01:01:50,980
It's true. Yeah, that's a good point.

1432
01:01:50,980 --> 01:01:53,820
But there's man, there's so much more jet.

1433
01:01:53,940 --> 01:01:57,820
I feel like now I'm now I'm we need to look into more about jet.

1434
01:01:58,180 --> 01:02:01,380
I would. Well, this I think, look, we did it right.

1435
01:02:01,380 --> 01:02:05,620
We this was about rocket belts and the RB 2000.

1436
01:02:05,700 --> 01:02:10,140
We've closed out that unless we want to do a full commentary on the film

1437
01:02:10,140 --> 01:02:12,540
Pretty Bird, which we do, but certainly.

1438
01:02:12,580 --> 01:02:15,340
But that's the end of the rocket belt content.

1439
01:02:15,340 --> 01:02:20,500
But other jet packs, just jet packs, exclamation point, its own episode.

1440
01:02:20,540 --> 01:02:21,980
Absolutely. It's on. I want to show you this.

1441
01:02:21,980 --> 01:02:23,660
This is the newest thing on the Wikipedia.

1442
01:02:23,660 --> 01:02:25,100
And I have seen this video before.

1443
01:02:25,100 --> 01:02:30,260
The Daulis flight pack, which is the newest in like jet pack technology.

1444
01:02:30,620 --> 01:02:33,220
And I want to show you this video because it's insane.

1445
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:36,700
And it's like definitely something Tom Cruise is going to be doing in a movie.

1446
01:02:36,700 --> 01:02:37,780
Right. Yes.

1447
01:02:37,780 --> 01:02:42,220
You have a McAfee support warning on your well, that's a Carlson's endless pop ups.

1448
01:02:42,900 --> 01:02:46,500
Whoa. That's so precise.

1449
01:02:46,540 --> 01:02:50,420
It's crazy. So you have like bullets on your arms or your hands.

1450
01:02:50,660 --> 01:02:52,940
And then it's like you also have them on your feet.

1451
01:02:53,260 --> 01:02:56,540
And this is a person going pro footage of landing on an aircraft carrier.

1452
01:02:56,540 --> 01:02:57,700
That's insane.

1453
01:02:57,700 --> 01:03:00,340
So it is like that's Iron Man shit.

1454
01:03:00,340 --> 01:03:02,700
That's like Iron Man. It's wild.

1455
01:03:03,140 --> 01:03:06,060
Whoa. Real life Iron Man like Elon Musk.

1456
01:03:06,500 --> 01:03:10,780
Exactly. A guy who's never flown around and won't.

1457
01:03:11,100 --> 01:03:13,380
Yeah, but he will say he's doing it.

1458
01:03:13,380 --> 01:03:17,060
And then there'll be a bunch of reasons he can't over the next year and a half.

1459
01:03:17,060 --> 01:03:19,940
And we already talked about this real life Iron Man thing with him.

1460
01:03:19,980 --> 01:03:26,180
But it's funny that like people focus on that he, you know, because he's rich and not.

1461
01:03:26,900 --> 01:03:28,940
So you don't think of the main

1462
01:03:28,940 --> 01:03:31,780
facet of Iron Man being that he flies around.

1463
01:03:31,860 --> 01:03:34,900
No, no, no, no. It's more about his holdings.

1464
01:03:35,500 --> 01:03:39,820
That's why just if purely if you compare numbers, like look at the books.

1465
01:03:40,020 --> 01:03:42,020
Elon Musk is a real life Tony Stark.

1466
01:03:43,860 --> 01:03:45,340
It's based on a joke.

1467
01:03:45,340 --> 01:03:46,940
Maybe it's no, it's not.

1468
01:03:46,940 --> 01:03:47,780
This was before that.

1469
01:03:47,780 --> 01:03:52,060
But there's a joke in Justice League where somebody asked Batman, what a superpower.

1470
01:03:52,060 --> 01:03:55,180
And he goes, I'm rich, which is a funny joke.

1471
01:03:56,220 --> 01:03:57,620
But people do. Yeah. Oh, yeah.

1472
01:03:57,620 --> 01:04:01,540
Well, if you have enough money, you are you can build rocket shoes.

1473
01:04:02,540 --> 01:04:05,860
It's like just pure purely financially.

1474
01:04:05,860 --> 01:04:10,020
And I only mean I don't mean the car and the fighting clown men.

1475
01:04:10,020 --> 01:04:11,540
I just purely financially.

1476
01:04:11,540 --> 01:04:14,340
Jeffrey Katzenberg is the real life Batman.

1477
01:04:15,060 --> 01:04:17,060
Yeah, it makes sense.

1478
01:04:17,060 --> 01:04:19,700
He must think it's so funny because I think also he loves the idea

1479
01:04:19,700 --> 01:04:21,500
because he was in Iron Man two.

1480
01:04:21,500 --> 01:04:24,780
Yeah. And then I think there were a few years here was like really cosplaying

1481
01:04:24,780 --> 01:04:28,260
is that where like the kid like those people was the kids are stuck in the mine

1482
01:04:28,260 --> 01:04:30,100
or something or the miners were stuck, excuse me.

1483
01:04:30,100 --> 01:04:30,540
Oh, yeah.

1484
01:04:30,540 --> 01:04:31,180
They're minor stuck.

1485
01:04:31,180 --> 01:04:33,740
And he's like, I'll send them tiny subs over.

1486
01:04:33,740 --> 01:04:36,780
I'll send some tiny subs and send anything.

1487
01:04:36,780 --> 01:04:39,020
And then like the sandwich, the one guy made fun of him.

1488
01:04:39,020 --> 01:04:40,540
He called him a pedophile.

1489
01:04:40,540 --> 01:04:43,180
And then it's like just like tunnels will tunnel everywhere.

1490
01:04:43,180 --> 01:04:45,340
And everyone's like, oh, my God, this guy's are such a genius.

1491
01:04:45,620 --> 01:04:49,460
Meanwhile, the article just came out that he's never built like hyper loops.

1492
01:04:49,460 --> 01:04:50,620
All this is bullshit.

1493
01:04:50,620 --> 01:04:53,260
He's never going to build this stupid tunnel.

1494
01:04:53,260 --> 01:04:55,500
We talk about Twitter, Vegas tunnel.

1495
01:04:55,500 --> 01:04:56,580
Oh, my God.

1496
01:04:56,580 --> 01:04:58,420
This is the Elon Musk.

1497
01:04:58,420 --> 01:05:00,420
You are the death of Rocket Man Bill

1498
01:05:00,420 --> 01:05:05,260
Suitors dream, your reason if you put all of these resources

1499
01:05:05,420 --> 01:05:09,340
into a jetpack that can fly for 31 seconds.

1500
01:05:09,660 --> 01:05:13,260
That's right. And now then maybe wouldn't have to criticize you so much.

1501
01:05:13,300 --> 01:05:17,300
But until that day, I think the future.

1502
01:05:17,940 --> 01:05:21,700
I don't know. It's not as bright as it was that day in Tomorrowland

1503
01:05:21,700 --> 01:05:27,340
where Bill Suitor took off into the sky without a cloud, without even the cloud

1504
01:05:27,340 --> 01:05:32,740
of that a bunch of people will all murder each other about the rocket belts

1505
01:05:32,740 --> 01:05:37,300
eventually. And the pretty bird would not be released in 2008.

1506
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:41,740
Despite a good showing at Sundance and due to the financial crisis,

1507
01:05:41,740 --> 01:05:43,740
there just wasn't really a market for it. Right.

1508
01:05:43,820 --> 01:05:46,300
So many bad the curse of the rocket belt.

1509
01:05:46,300 --> 01:05:48,140
And I hope it doesn't affect this episode.

1510
01:05:48,140 --> 01:05:49,300
I really hope so, too.

1511
01:05:49,300 --> 01:05:50,980
We can get out before it.

1512
01:05:50,980 --> 01:05:53,420
Oh, no, it'll be the one that is hot in this garage.

1513
01:05:53,420 --> 01:05:54,980
OK, well, then let's let's wrap it up.

1514
01:05:55,020 --> 01:05:57,420

1519
01:06:10,740 --> 01:06:14,860
I think this is the last with no probably Jason, I think.

1520
01:06:15,060 --> 01:06:19,340
Probably less. He's so furious about anything that happened in any of these.

1521
01:06:19,340 --> 01:06:20,540
I just you know what?

1522
01:06:20,540 --> 01:06:22,140
That's a those jetpack guys.

1523
01:06:22,140 --> 01:06:24,340
That's a group of three that all started hitting each other

1524
01:06:24,340 --> 01:06:26,140
with hammers and trapping each other in boxes.

1525
01:06:26,140 --> 01:06:30,220
We have to make a pact to the three of us to not trap each other in boxes.

1526
01:06:30,260 --> 01:06:34,420
He's done it so far without hammers for five years, but I don't know.

1527
01:06:35,020 --> 01:06:36,220
I don't know when the breaking point is here.

1528
01:06:36,220 --> 01:06:40,100
Six portend when we run out of classic Disneyland rides,

1529
01:06:40,100 --> 01:06:42,060
that may be all hell will break loose.

1530
01:06:42,060 --> 01:06:44,500
Today's episode is about get him.

1531
01:06:44,860 --> 01:06:48,100
Yeah, that's right after we do the Space Mountain episode.

1532
01:06:49,020 --> 01:06:52,420
And then it's like all the chaos is pure chaos and violence.

1533
01:06:52,820 --> 01:06:54,700
Tell me the password to the Patreon.

1534
