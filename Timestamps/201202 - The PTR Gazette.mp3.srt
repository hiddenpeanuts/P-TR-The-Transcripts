1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Extra, extra, read all about it.

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,320
Late edition of the PTR Gazette.

4
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,840
Rhodey retires, Walt Disney Imagineering now down to just

5
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,640
President Bob Weiss and a sinister mechanic

6
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,880
known only as the Gear Man.

7
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,680
I'm Cub reporter and Chief Newsboy Jason Sheridan.

8
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:41,280
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, The Second Gate.

9
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,160
Let's start over to our news big boy, Mike Carlson.

10
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:48,040
Yes, I'm here too.

11
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:51,720
I'm also from the 1920s and I have a job too

12
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,440
that's like a scrappy kind of a job.

13
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:57,760
Let's say that I will go fetch you a sandwich for a nickel.

14
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,240
And you reach the ink pots that are on the top shelf

15
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,320
that I can't get to.

16
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,600
Yeah, because I'm so tall.

17
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,440
I'm super tall.

18
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,840
They call me Tali.

19
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,280
And of course, our ooey gooey columnist,

20
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,120
Scott Gardner also here.

21
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,440
Yeah, that's right.

22
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:18,200
Ooey and gooey, you know me.

23
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,560
That's the kind of phrase that makes me smile

24
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,200
and not uncomfortable.

25
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:26,160
You got me pegged, Cub reporter.

26
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,400
We call you blue.

27
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,480
I say, what do you mean?

28
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:34,200
This is a totally original voice.

29
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,440
Ain't nothing that's been used on the show before.

30
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,680
It's a perfect 20s voice.

31
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:41,800
We call you blue because of your blue baseball cap.

32
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:47,480
And because my favorite kind of ooey and gooey is blue.

33
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,320
That's right.

34
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,120
Wow. Wow.

35
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:54,760
Well, I feel, boy, I feel like we're all a bunch of newsies.

36
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,600
Look at us.

37
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,520
We're the kings of New York.

38
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,360
That's right.

39
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,800
We're Christian Bale before his voice changed,

40
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:07,480
screaming at crew members at a higher register

41
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:10,200
than he would go on to later in life.

42
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,720
He was the same.

43
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,360
They had the same vibe then.

44
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,480
Yeah, same vibe.

45
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,360
That's where it started.

46
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,600
That's where that lighting guy crossed paths

47
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,640
or DP or whatever it was.

48
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,680
Oh, it was a rematch.

49
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,000
You're in my fucking lens, mate.

50
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,560
This better not happen again in 20 years.

51
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,160
Anyway, so folks, we're here.

52
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,880
We're talking news.

53
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,560
There hadn't been a lot of news lately,

54
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,200
so we hadn't really done an episode like this in a while,

55
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,600
but it's built up.

56
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,720
Stuff has happened now.

57
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,680
There's been some news.

58
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,560
Yeah, our desks are full.

59
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,040
Our little cub desks, they fill up quick

60
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,360
because they're tiny, because that's all we get.

61
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,640
But it's a stack as high as the ceiling now.

62
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,240
Yeah.

63
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,320
And I can reach the stack.

64
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,920
You can reach the stack, which is good

65
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:59,760
because the desk is attached to the chairs

66
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,240
and it keeps turning them over with the weight.

67
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,240
So.

68
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:03,960
Mm hmm.

69
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,840
That's true.

70
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,520
What do we start with?

71
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,720
Do we start with, do you want to talk about Joe Rodie?

72
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,400
Sure. Might as well.

73
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,640
Now you've said it.

74
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,760
Yeah. Yeah.

75
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,720
Oh, man.

76
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,320
Joe Rodie's retiring, everybody.

77
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,560
Legendary, Imagineer,

78
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:24,480
Imagineer of 40 years plus the man who brought us

79
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:29,200
Animal Kingdom and Avatar and Expedition Everest.

80
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,920
I know I keep listing other things in Animal Kingdom,

81
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,880
but that's the, he stayed on it.

82
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,720
He didn't just set up that park and then never touch it again.

83
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,960
He brought all the best stuff to it later.

84
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:43,960
This is like one of the great auteur Imagineers

85
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,280
and he's finally stepping down.

86
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,120
Yeah.

87
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,000
Guardians of the Galaxy Mission Breakout is Joe Rodie.

88
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,560
The man has a, is a versatile guy as well.

89
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,320
You'd think, well, this is a man who should only be doing

90
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:58,600
things that involve animals and land and culture.

91
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,480
Beads and stuff.

92
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,480
Silly sci-fi, but no, the man can do it all.

93
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,680
But he is involved in, I guess it correlates

94
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,880
with the rest of his body of work

95
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:11,560
because he's done multiple new iterations

96
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:15,200
of the Tower of Terror that involve big collections.

97
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,920
That is true.

98
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:22,600
Yeah, the Guardians and the Japan Tower of Terror,

99
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,560
which he of course factors into.

100
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:29,640
He essentially is the character, the villain of that ride.

101
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,840
I mean, that's another.

102
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,680
Harrison Hightower.

103
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,120
Harrison Hightower.

104
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,200
And I mean, when you talk about the legacy,

105
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,680
I think there's not only the amazing body of work,

106
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,360
but he's so put himself out there.

107
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:47,560
He's so visible and not just being interviewed

108
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,160
in all these specials and everything,

109
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:52,040
but he appears in attractions,

110
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,520
which I think that's the main way.

111
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:58,320
He feels in the Stan Lee zone a little bit.

112
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:03,320
Would we know him were he not to be so upfront and present?

113
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,880
Right, he's a very engaging personality.

114
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,680
I mean, in a similar way to a Tony Baxter,

115
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,760
but obviously he's a different type of person.

116
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:15,840
It seems like from what I've read about him and his life,

117
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,480
he was not a Disney super fan as a kid.

118
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:22,080
He was just sort of a creative guy who was able to

119
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,560
make cool stuff and conceptualize things

120
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,760
and have an interesting philosophy.

121
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,600
Yeah.

122
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,320
And he ended up at Disney and thriving.

123
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,840
Yeah, and kind of admit it,

124
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,280
like in one of his Instagram is very good,

125
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:37,840
if you all haven't taken a look, check it out.

126
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,560
But I forget whether it was there or just an interview

127
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,480
where he was like, yeah, I started at Disney

128
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:47,320
and I did not know anything about that.

129
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,280
I did not know what was going on

130
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,200
because he was like, was he a scenic painter, right?

131
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,320
I think.

132
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,160
That seems right.

133
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,000
Something like that.

134
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,840
Something like that.

135
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:59,320
Well, he did sets and stuff at my high school.

136
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,480
Yes.

137
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,600
Not intersecting with me, obviously,

138
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,920
but yeah, he was in the drama student

139
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:09,920
and then in the drama department at Chaminade in West Hills,

140
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:15,240
which is a cool, yeah, now if I'd known then,

141
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,000
I would have been so much more popular in high school

142
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,760
if I'd just constantly said, wow, you guys,

143
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,760
we're walking in roadies footsteps.

144
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,960
Oh, that would have made you cool.

145
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,080
That would have been the factor, yeah.

146
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:31,320
2003, man, you would have been the coolest kid in school.

147
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:35,320
Oh yeah, man, that's hot on the tail of Expedition Everest.

148
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:39,080
Then maybe I would have, what's that?

149
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,320
Right when Everest came out,

150
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:43,440
all the kids were buzzing about it at high school.

151
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,360
I remember, yeah, of course I remember it.

152
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,040
You would have been able to drop that on them.

153
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

154
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:52,720
No, everybody was starting to get tattoos quietly

155
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,200
without their parents finding out.

156
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,880
I just remember a lot of discreet lifting up

157
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:01,880
of little mini Everest's on the shoulder or the buttocks.

158
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,360
I remember my freshman year

159
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,920
in rock and roller coaster came out, all the kids,

160
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,760
all the kids were saying,

161
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,320
was that an Aerosmith ride?

162
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,160
I was like, what?

163
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,160
Get the fuck out of here.

164
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:16,040
Take your headphones out that are playing jaded.

165
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,800
If you look around the cafeteria,

166
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,680
surely it's jaded on all of them.

167
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,600
Stop listening to jaded for one second

168
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,120
so we can talk about something else about Aerosmith.

169
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,560
Yeah, I remember like it was yesterday.

170
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,680
I used to think this a little bit though.

171
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,400
I remember when I remember being at school

172
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,800
the day that the Indiana Jones Adventure opened

173
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,160
and looking around like,

174
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,480
are all the other kids thinking about

175
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,320
that that ride's opening right now?

176
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,160
They probably saw the LA Times.

177
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,240
At least you were closer in proximity.

178
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,080
I feel like I-

179
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,520
I was gonna say maybe that's not so crazy

180
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,120
if you were close to it,

181
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,440
but also they probably weren't and you were the only one.

182
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,880
No, I think so.

183
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,280
And yet they go on it and enjoy it.

184
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,120
Almost everyone I was looking at, I'm sure,

185
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,640
has been on the ride,

186
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,840
but they weren't ahead of it like me.

187
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,680
Yes.

188
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,520
Yeah, for sure.

189
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,520
So yeah, but yeah,

190
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:09,400
you would have been the king of high school

191
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,720
had you drawn that connection to Joe Rody,

192
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:15,400
who maybe had been on that special

193
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,320
about the building of Expedition Everest

194
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:21,120
with the Yeti footage when it was originally working.

195
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,400
He appeared on that.

196
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,280
So maybe that was one of the most,

197
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:28,600
other than like Disney videos in the hotel rooms

198
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,680
or promotional videos

199
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,920
where he was talking about Animal Kingdom,

200
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,800
that was maybe his most high profile interview yet.

201
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:35,640
Yeah.

202
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,520
Well, the celebrity really ramped up.

203
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:40,520
Like, you know, we all got to be friends

204
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,640
being theme partners and stuff,

205
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,440
but I don't know that we were right off the bat.

206
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,760
Like, so Joe Rody, I'm sure it eased in

207
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,040
in this way of like, you know,

208
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,920
there's that guy and all these things.

209
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,920
What's his name?

210
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:54,240
The guy with the earrings and he talks a lot.

211
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,160
He really, very opinionated.

212
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,120
It's funny how quickly it's turned from like,

213
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,240
oh, now of course we know who Joe Rody is

214
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,080
and he is an icon and how can they go on without him?

215
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,720
Yeah. Yes.

216
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,440
I'll be honest, I don't remember when I learned his name.

217
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,000
I don't know.

218
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,840
Yeah.

219
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:16,120
But it definitely, I didn't know it before.

220
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,680
I would say the earliest they may have known his name

221
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:21,080
was maybe like eight years ago.

222
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:21,920
Maybe. Yeah.

223
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,120
That sounds about right.

224
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,800
So yeah, that's when, and then I'm still,

225
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,320
look, we're still learning about legendary Imagineers.

226
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,400
They just, they haven't self promoted maybe

227
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,960
as much as some of these other people.

228
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,120
Yeah. Yeah, that's the thing.

229
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,800
There's great people throughout maybe

230
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,640
who just haven't had the camera in front of them.

231
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,320
Joe, look, Joe Rody's a star.

232
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,160
He is a star.

233
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,000
I'm just gonna say it.

234
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,400
He's a star in front of the camera.

235
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,240
Yeah.

236
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,280
And like pretty gracious, like, yeah,

237
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,160
very thoughtful on Instagram.

238
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:53,280
Posted a very gracious thing about his retirement and all.

239
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,520
And I think that's great practice

240
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:58,400
for his new full-time occupation,

241
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,680
getting messages that start with the phrase,

242
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,760
Hi Joe, hope you're doing well.

243
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,880
So I host a podcast, dot, dot, dot.

244
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:10,880
I feel like he's about to get slammed with messages

245
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:11,760
like that.

246
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,600
From us, you mean.

247
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,440
From any number of randos on the internet,

248
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,960
us included, yeah.

249
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,240
Yeah.

250
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:22,320
Well, we'll see whatever he signed with Disney,

251
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,520
what they, how they restrict his post.

252
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,360
Yes.

253
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,120
Working situation.

254
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,720
And at least right now, it seems like it's pretty cordial.

255
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,040
Like most people, I poked around online.

256
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:37,400
I went to the message boards to see what people were saying.

257
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:40,880
And it didn't seem as gossipy as some other stories.

258
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,920
I also poked around.

259
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:43,760
And.

260
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,520
Yes, I think it's pretty clear what happened.

261
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,840
Disney is hurting for money right now.

262
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:52,240
Everything is being put on the back burner,

263
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,560
pushed years away.

264
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,080
Cause he had a range of projects.

265
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:00,480
Some rumored, some confirmed that he was gonna do as of,

266
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,360
he was gonna make an island last year.

267
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,200
Yeah.

268
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,200
And that's not a quick project.

269
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,720
So I would think it would be like,

270
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:12,000
okay, he's in his mid sixties,

271
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,560
a combination of Disney being like, look,

272
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,400
here's how long it's gonna take everything.

273
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,520
You're also very well paid.

274
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,640
Yes.

275
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,600
Let's come to an agreement, maybe together like.

276
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,800
Over 40 years at any company,

277
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:27,720
you just rack up seniority and stock options

278
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,120
and salary increases.

279
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,440
So, you know.

280
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,320
But we don't know anything.

281
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,960
I mean, this is something we're gonna have to grill him

282
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,960
about when he comes on podcast, The Ride,

283
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:38,200
now that he's free and clear.

284
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,040
For sure.

285
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,280
And I wonder if he was reading the same message board I was,

286
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,560
which quickly devolved into arguments

287
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:47,360
about whether the hub at the Magic Kingdom was better

288
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,000
when it had the real big trees

289
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,120
and whether Buena Vista Street tells a coherent story.

290
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,560
And then everyone just being real skeptical

291
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,080
of some guy named Zach.

292
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:04,760
I believe Zach is the young Imagineer

293
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:07,560
overseeing like a lot of the Epcot redo stuff,

294
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,520
which I mean, that seems like kind of a thankless job,

295
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,360
right?

296
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,320
People are gonna be mad at you no matter what you do.

297
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,880
You know?

298
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,440
Yeah, for sure.

299
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,280
That's, yeah.

300
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,360
Look, I hope Zach doesn't read the message boards

301
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,200
for his sake.

302
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,280
Yeah, hard enough to do creative work,

303
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,560
not hearing criticism.

304
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,240
The great cottage industry of judging

305
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:32,240
what non-celebrity executives and producers

306
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,680
are doing kind of based on their photo

307
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:39,280
and the general vibe you get from them

308
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,960
and no concrete information.

309
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:45,840
That's not that I, clearly there's a lot to not like

310
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,760
about Shapek thus far,

311
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,960
but I feel like he gets in and there's a lot of like,

312
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:51,920
oh, I don't know.

313
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,880
And it's like, what are we going off of?

314
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,320
Do we just not like that he's pure bald?

315
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,840
Do we not like the hair?

316
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,280
Like what really is,

317
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:03,360
we almost know nothing concrete about this guy.

318
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:08,160
Yeah, it's, you know, he slats into the enemy position

319
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,440
and I think people just find any weakness,

320
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,600
any physical weakness they can find.

321
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,920
This jaw doesn't look strong enough.

322
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,760
This means he's not going to do a good job

323
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,720
on the Ratatouille ride.

324
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,600
I saw a video of him shaking a hand

325
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:25,000
back when handshakes were okay to do

326
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,880
and it did not seem very firm.

327
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,600
And that's not how we judge people anymore,

328
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:32,280
but it was in February and I didn't like the shake.

329
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,520
Mm-hmm, well, that's all you can find all this

330
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,040
on a message board, on many messages.

331
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,520
Yes, somebody's said it somewhere.

332
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,440
DM Jason for the specific board.

333
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,280
Sure.

334
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:47,200
On the thing of Rody's like visible legacy in the park,

335
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,040
I saw an article I hadn't seen before

336
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,920
from a cycle of parchaeology called

337
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,720
Five Times Imagineer Joe Rody

338
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,560
snuck himself into your favorite attractions.

339
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:02,040
And there are a few things that I did not know about.

340
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,440
One of them, I mean, you know,

341
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:08,000
his involvement in Avatar is obviously known.

342
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,720
And then this section of the article started

343
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,000
and I was like, is he in it somewhere?

344
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:16,840
There's one of these Navi, a mo-capped Rody,

345
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,040
but I guess not.

346
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:20,360
It's just that I didn't catch this detail.

347
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,680
Maybe you guys have, but the handprints

348
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,680
at the end of the ride somewhere.

349
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,000
I've never seen this.

350
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,800
This big red handprints on a stone wall

351
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:33,520
and it's all J's, everyone involved this.

352
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:36,720
The Avatar creative team is a triple J,

353
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,560
but that's gotta be James Cameron,

354
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,640
John Landau and Joe Rody.

355
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,080
They all marked the wall.

356
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,680
That's nice.

357
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,920
Which what a cool, I think that's pretty neat how like,

358
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:49,240
well, it seems like what I meant to be,

359
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:52,560
like of course Cameron and Rody worked together

360
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,240
and that's such a cool blend of titans

361
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,280
from their respective industries.

362
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,840
And there, yeah, there's fun footage of that

363
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:02,040
in the Imagineering story on Disney Plus.

364
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:02,880
Yeah, yeah.

365
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:03,720
Them working together.

366
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,840
There's also the other thing from the article,

367
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,760
I truly didn't know this one.

368
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,400
I'll just do this as trivia to you guys.

369
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,480
Do you know the Disney attraction

370
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,920
that Joe Rody does a voice in?

371
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,640
No. Not off the top of my head.

372
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,160
We've talked about it on the show.

373
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,560
It is something that we've covered.

374
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,400
I don't know that you'd get there.

375
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,480
It's probably a thing I've said,

376
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,880
I probably like said it or something

377
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,040
and I've completely forgot.

378
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:30,400
It's not like a memorable line really,

379
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:34,800
but you would, he voices a robot though.

380
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,240
Can I narrow it down further and say that he has a voice

381
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:42,600
in the American Adventure, which is forever ago.

382
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,200
That's such an old attraction and he's a voice in it.

383
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,320
Do you have any idea?

384
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,200
Tell me.

385
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,800
He's Alexander Graham Bell.

386
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:53,640
Wow.

387
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,080
Who's Scottish.

388
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,280
Like I guess he was a guy who was around

389
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,960
who was both Scottish and very eloquent.

390
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:03,560
That's what's said is that he was able to pronounce

391
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,640
and do this very particular dialect.

392
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,040
So there he is.

393
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,360
Yes, that should illustrate to you

394
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:11,360
how long he's been with the company since that is.

395
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,680
How old is that right at this point?

396
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,680
82, right?

397
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,120
Yeah, right.

398
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,920
And there's weird early Epcot footage

399
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,160
where he's playing Dreamfinder.

400
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,000
Yes.

401
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,360
Yes, yes.

402
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,200
He is one of them.

403
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:26,680
Yes, it's like a Dreamfinder was like Hamlet or the Joker,

404
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,320
these iconic roles that would be played

405
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,960
by many people over the years.

406
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,400
Jared Leto coming up, I think.

407
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,240
Yeah.

408
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,680
Look, you said it now.

409
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:39,000
There's no way it doesn't happen in 18 months or so.

410
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:43,000
Jared Leto, he's got a different take on it.

411
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,800
He's not gonna have the hat or the beard

412
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:49,960
or the jacket or the dragon.

413
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:52,240
He's just gonna be kind of like a way fish guy

414
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,520
with his shirt off, but otherwise it's the Dreamfinder.

415
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,360
He's Dreamfinder.

416
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:59,000
And they don't call him Dreamfinder though.

417
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,200
They call him DF.

418
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,320
And that's written across his chest

419
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:07,760
and kind of like splatted out sloppy paint.

420
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,320
And if you're on the production with him,

421
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,680
he will send you a dead rat.

422
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:15,160
Only to get into the character of DF.

423
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,600
Of DF, yeah.

424
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:20,640
DF coming on Disney Plus pretty soon.

425
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:26,520
What else about this guy though or this moment?

426
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:31,520
I think Rodie, I wanna say like Rodie gives the Parks

427
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:35,600
another like dimension with his vibe, which I think.

428
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,840
Cause I think in general, the type of like,

429
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:43,840
I love the earth and a lot of various,

430
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,800
I'm very knowledgeable at different cultures

431
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,720
and I travel the world.

432
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,080
It is sort of different probably

433
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,400
than your regular Disney nerd super fan

434
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,320
that might get into Imagineering these days.

435
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:57,280
So it brings an interesting perspective

436
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,240
and it has brought an interesting perspective

437
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,400
to all this stuff.

438
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:04,560
And like Animal Kingdom is so different

439
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,520
than every other Disney park.

440
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,520
Yeah.

441
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,160
So like it's a totally different vibe.

442
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:15,160
And I think he deserves like a lot of credit for,

443
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,200
I don't know, just for that.

444
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,920
Just because it's like, what else would you have done?

445
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,960
I guess I'm trying to think of like a Disney ride.

446
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:24,080
It would be like, if you took Jungle Cruise

447
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,000
and like built it out, but like really tried to blow it up

448
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,840
and make it crazy cool and much more like,

449
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,280
I guess realistic, I don't know.

450
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,640
Specific to really hyper specific places

451
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,560
and not just like, I don't know, the jungle in general.

452
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,840
Right.

453
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:39,680
Yeah, he's like, yeah,

454
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:42,280
Rodie travels to countries

455
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,560
that I've literally never heard of.

456
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,400
Right.

457
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,520
He is so hyper specific.

458
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,720
I mean, yeah, he's,

459
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,280
you gotta think all the best Imagineers

460
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,160
are the ones that you know

461
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:54,040
or people who've really brought themselves to it.

462
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,360
And I, you know,

463
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:59,480
that is probably not a better example of that than him.

464
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,920
Yeah, it's almost like his more like,

465
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:05,560
Tony Baxter probably you would say maybe took already

466
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,280
the ideas sort of that were there in Disney

467
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,200
and just kind of like made them really great and cool

468
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,200
and left his mark on it.

469
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,400
But like Rodie, it's almost like feels more

470
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,880
even specific to Rodie

471
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,040
when you look at some of the stuff he did.

472
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,520
Because you will, that's of course that guy

473
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:21,240
who has been to every country on the map,

474
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,560
every single place.

475
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,400
Yeah.

476
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,680
Like this feels authentic to him as a person.

477
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,000
Feels authentic to the way he like,

478
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,520
he literally looks if you look at him

479
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,680
and look at his omnipresent earring.

480
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,520
Yes.

481
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,320
Like he's made like many attractions

482
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,200
that feel like the earring.

483
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,320
Yeah.

484
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,160
It's very-

485
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,080
Yes, in case you don't know,

486
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,560
he has a very large hanging earring on one ear.

487
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,960
Yeah, tactile, very tactile.

488
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,680
And like in the Imagineering story,

489
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:52,520
he's constantly just like sketching and drawing,

490
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:56,120
which like there's anecdotes about like older Imagineers

491
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:58,280
being frustrated with the younger generation of like,

492
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,840
don't you, anyone carry a notebook?

493
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,360
Which I'm sure there's plenty of people carry,

494
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,080
like pen and scrap paper.

495
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:09,080
But yeah, there's a sincerity, there's an authenticity.

496
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:14,120
And I feel like a desire to like represent these places

497
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:17,400
and cultures and stories accurately too.

498
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,240
Yes.

499
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,680
I would think you, yes, you would say he is

500
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:24,520
working in a very corporate environment

501
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:28,960
and has done his best to like try to, yes,

502
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,160
represent cultures the best he can

503
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:37,160
and make like real art out of all of this stuff.

504
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,000
Yeah.

505
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:38,840
I mean, everyone does that to a degree.

506
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:41,560
Yeah, and use this, like what's ultimately

507
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:44,120
like super corporate money at the end of the day

508
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:47,600
to pay tribute to things that are not super corporate

509
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:51,800
and to have themes that are more challenging

510
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:56,280
than theme park attractions should ever have.

511
00:20:56,280 --> 00:21:00,560
I mean, like how many theme park attractions had themes,

512
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:05,560
like not theming, but like emotional, moral themes

513
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:09,680
until this guy, that's really the bigger dimension

514
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,560
I think he's added to stuff.

515
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:14,120
Right, and I would think, yeah, and it's like,

516
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:16,800
I have not traveled as much as I'd like to,

517
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,240
but you do go to like Animal Kingdom,

518
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,000
you go, I should go to these places.

519
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,840
Yeah.

520
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,200
I should go to these places.

521
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,040
Right, right.

522
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:25,320
And I feel like that's what he is going to do.

523
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,120
He's just going to keep doing what he was doing

524
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:31,200
in his off time or like his like travel time,

525
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,600
is keep doing that as opposed to just immediately jump.

526
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:37,320
I can't imagine him immediately,

527
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,680
like just jumping to Universal.

528
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:42,000
I feel like they would keep him on like a consulting

529
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,280
contract or-

530
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,920
Yeah, there's gotta be something like that.

531
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:48,040
At most he would start his own company.

532
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,320
That's like the biggest leap I could say,

533
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,880
but, well.

534
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,640
I bet he'll be around in some sort of advisory capacity,

535
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,000
but I don't know, that's speculative.

536
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,120
Yeah.

537
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:02,320
The thing that I would like to see is a 10 part

538
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:07,320
mini series showing his final season as an Imagineer.

539
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,360
Oh yeah.

540
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:13,600
Yeah, yeah, just like, shit talking to everybody,

541
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,520
calling people bitches or whatever,

542
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,920
gambling with people in the hallways.

543
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:25,040
And leading up to finally retiring the earring

544
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:27,920
at the top of the Imagineering rafters.

545
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,520
Yeah, I think that's a good idea.

546
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,080
You know, you could also think of it as,

547
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:33,200
what happens sometimes is when professional wrestlers

548
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,160
leave WWE or another company,

549
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,560
they do what's called a shoot interview,

550
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:40,520
where they just spend an hour shitting on everyone

551
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,840
because they just left.

552
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,240
So I would like to see more Imagineer shoot interviews

553
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,240
in general.

554
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,080
Agreed.

555
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:50,200
Where they shoot quote unquote on people and things

556
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,680
that they had to do.

557
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,120
Yeah, that would be nice.

558
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:56,920
We got the place to do it, but his will be some like,

559
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:59,800
one time he met some guy in Nepal

560
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:02,200
who he didn't get along with.

561
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,680
And they show him the iPad.

562
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:09,960
Oh yeah, a lot of footage of him watching people on iPads

563
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,800
that he doesn't approve of.

564
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:14,640
Laughing, maniacal laughs at them.

565
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,600
And he's like kind of retconning the Yeti story

566
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,840
of like why it doesn't work.

567
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:21,640
And you're like, that's not my recollection of this incident.

568
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,040
Why is he changing this yet again?

569
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:25,560
Look, I've seen the tapes, it just stopped working.

570
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,240
I guess we should talk a little Yeti.

571
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,840
Some people are a little upset.

572
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,160
Because I feel like this is the death of the Yeti.

573
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:37,400
This will be, yeah, this might be the final, yeah,

574
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,320
chance for the Yeti to have worked.

575
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,960
If you don't know, we're talking about the Yeti

576
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,120
and Expedition Everest had an A mode

577
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,520
that was awesome and terrifying.

578
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,800
And you can see it in that special.

579
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:50,160
I think it was a travel channel special.

580
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,000
It was travel channel.

581
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,920
In the early 2000s, Disney outsourced a lot of their

582
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:56,560
parks specials to travel channel.

583
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,560
Yeah.

584
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:01,520
And yeah, this A mode, which is like,

585
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:05,840
it kind of functioning at full power is insane.

586
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,720
The Yeti is like giant.

587
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:11,560
It feels like it's 50 feet tall.

588
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:12,760
I don't know if it's that.

589
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:15,520
And it swipes, so something that big.

590
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,440
Like moving, you know, like we know,

591
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,080
we've seen smaller characters do that action,

592
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,760
but not like it's, it's a literal,

593
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:27,520
like Godzilla, King Kong level creature.

594
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,360
Yeah.

595
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,320
And it's so big.

596
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:32,160
And now basically it functions in like B mode

597
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,960
or no mode at all at this point on the ride

598
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,040
where there's kind of a strobe light on it

599
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,160
and you hear a noise.

600
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,240
And it looks scary, but it's still,

601
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:42,600
you're not getting the full effect of it,

602
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,560
like swiping at you.

603
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,200
And I also think now with the strobe,

604
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,400
you don't kind of see how tall it, how big it is.

605
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,800
Cause on that travel channel special,

606
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:52,480
and I'm sure it's still on YouTube, you see it and you go,

607
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,560
oh my God, this is like one of the biggest robots

608
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,760
I've ever seen.

609
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,200
And it's terrifying.

610
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,760
And it hasn't worked for years

611
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:03,000
because it's a very advanced animatronic.

612
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,360
And apparently they built it into the rocks.

613
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,400
I'm sure I said this on the expedition ever,

614
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,600
or somebody did.

615
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,120
They built it like into the fake rocks

616
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,560
and they're not able to pull it out and fix it,

617
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:17,760
which they've now changed the way they do things

618
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,360
like they do on the river, Navi River journey

619
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:24,360
with the very advanced audio animatronic Shaman of Song.

620
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:27,240
They can pull that out and fix it and put it back.

621
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,920
They cannot do that with this.

622
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:29,760
It's stuck.

623
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:33,840
I think they were saying that the force of what it was doing

624
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,520
was kind of like clawing its way out of the mountain

625
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:39,760
because of the vibrations, essentially.

626
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,840
Like it's like the thrust of it is,

627
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:44,560
it's so big and the energy it's putting out,

628
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:48,760
it's like digging itself out of the actual structure,

629
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:49,600
which is not good.

630
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,480
You don't want that thing to fall.

631
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,320
Yeah, it's like trying to get free.

632
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:55,040
It's gonna burst through the, oh my God.

633
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:59,640
So what I, and this is a very message board understanding

634
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:02,160
of what is happening or what could happen.

635
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,320
The only real way to fix the whole thing

636
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:08,040
would be to like dismantle part of the ride for a while.

637
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,960
Crack the building like open,

638
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,720
crack the, make a hole in the building

639
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,160
and carve it out.

640
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,280
Yeah, so to fix all of that,

641
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,400
you'd have to have the ride down for a long time.

642
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,520
It would be very expensive.

643
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:23,800
I know they've talked before about just trying to figure out

644
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:27,080
a solution just for the arm to try to figure out a way

645
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,760
if they could sort of just keep it stationary

646
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:31,000
and maybe have the arm maybe on a different mechanism

647
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,560
to at least make it look like you were getting swiped at.

648
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,400
Oh, interesting.

649
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:38,600
And at a D23, Joe Rody, I think four or five years ago,

650
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:41,360
he promised he was gonna fix it.

651
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:44,680
So people are upset now that he's leaving

652
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:47,200
because they feel like, well, that's it.

653
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:51,400
Well, I don't know, don't we, maybe Biden will fix it.

654
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,880
He knows that's the key to recovering

655
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,440
not just Disney World and all the Disney parks,

656
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:01,400
but the travel economy and the entire economy.

657
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:05,160
It really all hinges on the yeti.

658
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:08,320
But you can't have a shutdown.

659
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,360
You can't have a full shutdown.

660
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:14,400
The cure can't be worse than the disease.

661
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,800
We are not gonna shut down Everest.

662
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:21,120
So yeah, Everest will not be shut down.

663
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:24,240
You'll be able to go on it while it's being worked on.

664
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,720
Yeah, you just have to keep it running.

665
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:28,120
Yeah, and people might get sawdust in their eyes.

666
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:30,560
Mix the messages, honestly, it's still confusing.

667
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,920
Big parts might fall on people and crush them,

668
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:36,880
but you can't, I keep saying it, you can't have a shutdown.

669
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,240
You can't have a total shutdown.

670
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,160
Right.

671
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,720
I mean, look, Rhodey could get a cabinet position now.

672
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,440
I guess he's free for that.

673
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,000
That's true, yeah.

674
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,160
Ambassadorship, maybe?

675
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:53,160
Oh yeah, he can be the ambassador to like 20 countries.

676
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,400
Or he could imagine you're the White House.

677
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,680
The White House, and I'm not trying to agree with Trump,

678
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,560
I don't agree with Trump about almost anything,

679
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:01,160
except the White House does sometimes

680
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:03,800
when Trump talks about how it's a dump.

681
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:06,000
It does, you do see some pictures, you go,

682
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:09,560
that does look kind of like, that could use a spruce up.

683
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,800
Remember how when there was the general idea

684
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:14,000
of what if Donald Trump ever became president

685
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,960
like many years before it happened?

686
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:18,960
It was like kind of a stock obvious joke, I guess,

687
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,840
to say like, here, what'll happen to the White House

688
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:25,200
and then it's all gold and insane?

689
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,040
That would have been awesome.

690
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:30,760
Like that's the, I wish he'd done the shitty joke

691
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:35,000
and just redone the White House with like tiger stripe marble.

692
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,280
If that's what the presidency had been like,

693
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,800
it would have been a blast.

694
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,640
Yeah.

695
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,880
Yeah, if he had just not done any of that ghoulish,

696
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,800
awful shit and then yeah, just spent it

697
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:47,520
like putting satin everywhere.

698
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,520
Oh yeah, no complaints.

699
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,880
Toilets.

700
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,840
Instead, what do we get?

701
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:56,000
Melania yanked a rose garden and just keeps making

702
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,640
like years of like Baba Duke Christmas trees

703
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,920
in one hallway.

704
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,480
Yeah.

705
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,560
So maybe, maybe Rhodey could reimagine the White House

706
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:07,400
for a new generation.

707
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,240
Now is the time.

708
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,000
Let's take back that idea.

709
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,040
Let's, I want the stupidest, gaudiest White House,

710
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:16,400
maybe inspired by Guardian's Mission Breakout,

711
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:20,120
just like tons of weird frames and doodads all over it.

712
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:20,960
Yeah.

713
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:21,840
Yeah, that's good.

714
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:22,680
Yeah.

715
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:25,800
A really gaudy Jack Kirby style White House

716
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:26,920
is really up our alley.

717
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:27,760
That would be amazing.

718
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,600
Yeah, that's the sign.

719
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,520
Things are different.

720
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,560
Oh my gosh.

721
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,920
Hey, I mean, feel free to back me up,

722
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:36,960
but if we're talking about exciting designs

723
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:41,360
and jaw-dropping imagery in the theme park world lately,

724
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:44,720
oh my God, this Mario stuff.

725
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,560
Holy shit.

726
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,400
Oh sure.

727
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,220
Yeah, that was.

728
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:48,060
This has been.

729
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:49,760
Next on my list, so.

730
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:50,760
Yeah.

731
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,800
It's unbelievable.

732
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:57,720
I, if you don't know what we're talking about,

733
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,920
there's images now out of Super Nintendo World,

734
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:05,560
which is coming first to Universal in Osaka, Japan.

735
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:07,660
I mean, we've seen little bits and pieces

736
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:10,520
and things in progress as it's being constructed,

737
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:14,080
but now there is photos and video,

738
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,460
and you almost need to see it as video

739
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:19,500
and see it in motion to prove that you are not looking

740
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:24,500
at an extremely polished Photoshop or still from a game.

741
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:28,540
I mean, it just looks like computer graphics

742
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:29,800
put into the real world.

743
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,420
It's bonkers.

744
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:33,180
Yeah, there's the one picture I think

745
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:35,460
that has been circulating of the land itself

746
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:37,980
that I'm sure they used a good camera.

747
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:40,540
I'm sure it was perfectly sunny lighting,

748
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:44,340
but you can't, your brain almost doesn't acknowledge it.

749
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:45,620
It looks like the thing you've seen,

750
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:47,740
and it looks like the leaked photos we've seen,

751
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:50,100
like the aerial shots, but the way it's lit

752
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:52,860
and the way it looks, you just keep looking at it

753
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:55,060
and going, I know what you're telling me.

754
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:58,380
I know you're telling me this is real, but it's so crazy.

755
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:00,860
I'm trying to think of there's anything

756
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:05,860
that renders a fantasy world that we're familiar with,

757
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:09,220
because it's not exactly like any of the video games.

758
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:11,200
Obviously all the elements we know,

759
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,220
but it is a combination of things.

760
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:16,180
But I can't think of anything else that you go,

761
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:17,660
oh, there it is.

762
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:19,620
That is exactly it.

763
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:22,100
There doesn't, I'm not gonna go,

764
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:23,440
oh, I wish this was a little better.

765
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,340
No, it's perfect.

766
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:26,500
I mean, to go back the road,

767
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:29,720
he's sort of Avatar and floating mountains,

768
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:32,060
but even that's like, no, most,

769
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:33,820
well, I was gonna say nobody.

770
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:38,820
Most people besides Mike Carlson are not so enraptured

771
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:41,620
by the world of Pandora.

772
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:43,580
Yes, yeah, yeah.

773
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:47,180
As much as we, I think you forget that we've all,

774
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:50,900
I guess I forget that we've been around this Mario imagery

775
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:54,300
our whole lives and now it's rendered in real place

776
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:55,400
in some fashion.

777
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:58,340
And Pandora is great

778
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:01,420
and the floating mountains effects are very cool,

779
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,580
but you go in there and you go, oh, this is awesome.

780
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:07,060
This really is nice, it's a nice vibe in there.

781
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:08,440
That's very cool.

782
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:11,100
And it certainly suggests Pandora.

783
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:13,060
But Pandora, when you see it on an IMAT,

784
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:16,100
you go, well, that's fully Pandora.

785
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:19,100
The mountains are, the hallelujah mountains are so far up

786
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:21,060
and it's, you know, you get it, it's cool.

787
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:23,020
And this is obviously an insane feat

788
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:24,740
that they've accomplished here, but with Nintendo,

789
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:27,140
you go, that's it, they've done it.

790
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:28,820
That's it, that's perfect.

791
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:29,660
Yeah.

792
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:32,820
I can't think of a better one.

793
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:35,380
And even, you know, it is interesting that,

794
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:38,420
I mean, obviously Galaxy's Edge is so jaw dropping

795
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:39,680
once you started seeing footage

796
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,300
and then being there in real life.

797
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:43,500
But I, what I was, I think like,

798
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:48,380
it might be safe to say the most jaw dropping places

799
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:49,660
in theme parks in the last couple of years

800
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:53,780
have been Pandora and Galaxy's Edge.

801
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:58,780
So, which are both very earthy and purposefully grimy

802
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:03,300
or not necessarily dirty, but you know, like,

803
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:07,100
realistic a little bit.

804
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:11,780
So to see just like, here is a giant shiny cartoon,

805
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:14,220
primary color place.

806
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:16,260
It felt like seeing a new Disneyland.

807
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:21,260
It felt like Mickey's, if Mickey's Toontown was brand new,

808
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:27,100
the best, like the shiniest paint and 13 stories tall.

809
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:30,060
It was crazy.

810
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:32,980
Yeah, it's, yeah, I always thought that my first thought was,

811
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:35,380
oh, they're gonna have to repaint this a lot.

812
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:36,780
Yeah.

813
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:39,220
Oh, Jason, you're flipping through stills.

814
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:44,220
The lineup of cups, you can be a gog at the exterior

815
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:48,660
and you should be, but man, I would like,

816
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:51,620
Aaron and I were both just like, oh, these cups,

817
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:55,300
the trophies of all of the Star Cup and the Flower Cup

818
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:57,940
and the Mario Kart, within the Mario Kart attraction,

819
00:33:57,940 --> 00:34:00,100
which is the primary attraction and the thing.

820
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:02,980
Just these are beautiful.

821
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:03,880
Yeah.

822
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,000
They're so shiny.

823
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,940
I have no more deep observation than that.

824
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:08,220
I will even give them credit.

825
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:12,060
I think the trophy with the Universal logo on it,

826
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:14,700
I think it's cute and I think like,

827
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:17,820
God knows how many hours on phones someone had to like,

828
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:20,740
look, just give them this, just give Universal that,

829
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:22,580
just let them have this, okay?

830
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:24,740
Yeah, they earned it.

831
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:27,540
It's really stupid, but it's really great.

832
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:29,020
And I'm like, yeah, good for you.

833
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:30,780
You made this happen.

834
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:32,140
You get a trophy.

835
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:35,260
I mean, we were texting about like the Bowser statue,

836
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:38,980
the massive Bowser statue, which,

837
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:41,380
there's a giant stairway that goes up to it.

838
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:42,900
I mean, this is moody lighting.

839
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:44,980
I saw it when reporters were there

840
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:47,180
and it kind of looked like you were going up the stairs

841
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:49,940
to a second level of a mall, which is also great.

842
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:52,060
I'm happy about that.

843
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:52,900
We love that.

844
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:53,740
Yeah, big stupid Mario mall.

845
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:54,580
Yeah.

846
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:58,460
But in the stylized photos you're showing

847
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:00,660
with the staircase, I mean, it looks like,

848
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:03,660
it's completely a frame out of Mario Kart.

849
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:05,740
Like you would drive a cart up the stairs

850
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:07,380
and bump all the way up them

851
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:10,820
and then encounter this massive Bowser statue.

852
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:13,300
If for some reason a listener is not seeing this already

853
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:16,700
on Theme Park Twitter, I think we all maybe agreed

854
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:19,380
that the most exciting element

855
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:21,660
might've been this Bowser room.

856
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:25,140
And I had a little lingering thought

857
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:29,220
and then Carly Weisel super confirmed

858
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:31,460
what I had vaguely thought of,

859
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:35,380
which she noted something in a press release

860
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:39,260
that we got sent with a lot of details about this place.

861
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:44,980
Let me just pull her observation or the specific language.

862
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:46,820
This is from what Universal sent out.

863
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:49,980
The powerful scale of the statue makes one feel

864
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:52,660
as if Bowser will suddenly start to move.

865
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:55,180
And then as Carly says, this makes me think

866
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:57,420
there may be more to the stone-gazza walls

867
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:58,980
than meets the eye.

868
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:00,340
Right, like why would they say

869
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:03,620
if you feel like Bowser will start to move,

870
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:04,820
why would you put that in there

871
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:06,180
if there wasn't something up with that?

872
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:11,180
It moved just a little, like a vase in a horror movie,

873
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:15,020
like in The Shining, where they cut away from a shot

874
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:18,420
and they cut back and a chair is suddenly there

875
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:20,100
and no one addresses it.

876
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:21,500
That would be wild.

877
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:22,340
Hehehehehe.

878
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:26,500
I mean, I don't wanna hype this up too much.

879
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:27,980
Yes, that sounds incredible.

880
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:31,020
This feels like, and I guess this is gonna sound like

881
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:32,340
I'm taking a shot at Galaxy's Edge

882
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:33,940
and I don't wanna take a shot at Galaxy's Edge,

883
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:37,100
but this feels like it's the Millennium Falcon area

884
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:39,100
of Galaxy's Edge, but everywhere.

885
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:41,780
It's all Millennium Falcon.

886
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:45,780
You know, we end up reiterating sides of this argument

887
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:49,700
and the Mike Mitchell side of things is like,

888
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:52,060
it should just be all the things you like

889
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:53,860
on top of each other.

890
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:58,420
Just like, here's a vomit of all the major Star Wars things

891
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:00,260
and of course I see the argument of like,

892
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:02,660
no, it's gotta be more subtle and then, you know,

893
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:04,460
living your own story and making up a place

894
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:07,740
that's only in the park and I'm sold on that being

895
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:09,340
the correct way to do things

896
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:10,820
or at least a cool way to do things.

897
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:12,300
And then you look at this and you're like,

898
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:15,620
uh oh, it's all the things right on top of each other.

899
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:17,460
It's pretty satisfying.

900
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:18,780
That's the problem.

901
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:20,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

902
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:21,220
I'll tell you.

903
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:22,180
And there's, yeah, go ahead.

904
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:25,260
I was gonna say, I hadn't really paid much attention

905
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:27,740
to the stuff about the power bands.

906
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:30,700
Now I feel like I've read everything they've put out

907
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:32,980
about it, but like, it's an upcharge.

908
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:36,700
It is an upcharge, but it's like a Magic Band style thing

909
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:38,020
you can wear on your wrist.

910
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:39,980
And then you sync it with an app,

911
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:44,300
which the app looks like you want it.

912
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:46,340
It looks like a Mario game.

913
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:51,220
Oh, and you're the, it's like a map of Super Mario World

914
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:54,860
and the little icon is like Mario is you.

915
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:56,260
And then you're in where you're seeing

916
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:57,380
what Mario would see.

917
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:58,460
And it's so good.

918
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:00,340
It unlocks a different attraction.

919
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:03,540
It unlocks like where you have to fight Bowser Jr.

920
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:05,620
of course, to get the golden mushroom.

921
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:07,540
We all know that.

922
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:11,140
Yeah, wait, what are you talking about fighting Bowser Jr.?

923
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:14,100
I don't really have a sense of what this is going to be.

924
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:15,020
Where is he?

925
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:16,860
Where is he on this map?

926
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:18,900
He's in the press kit.

927
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:21,140
Yeah, he looks very cute.

928
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:23,580
I think we can agree he is cute, right?

929
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:24,980
Bowser Jr.

930
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:26,860
Bowser Jr. is cute, yes.

931
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:27,700
And everyone.

932
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:29,300
Scary in his own way, but.

933
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:31,620
I mean, I was going nuts.

934
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:34,700
Just the yellow question mark box,

935
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:37,900
just all the people like at events jumping up

936
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:39,140
and hitting the boxes.

937
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:42,500
I'm like, well, it looks like they might've done it.

938
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:45,580
These people look like,

939
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:47,260
so we're looking at a picture of Bowser Jr.

940
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:50,580
throwing the bomb at children.

941
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:53,260
And there was a child jumping

942
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:55,540
and hitting one of the question blocks that has wings on it.

943
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:57,300
This appears, and I don't know if,

944
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:59,060
they're not in Mario Kart.

945
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:01,620
Because what we know right now is that there are two rides.

946
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:03,140
I don't know we're getting both of them here.

947
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:05,260
We're for sure getting Mario Kart in Hollywood,

948
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:08,700
but they have the Yoshi Omnimover ride and Mario Kart.

949
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:10,300
And the Yoshi looks cute.

950
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:12,460
The Yoshi Omnimover is very cute.

951
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:13,660
I haven't seen this picture.

952
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:14,500
Jeez.

953
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:15,340
That's really cute.

954
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:16,820
It looks so cute.

955
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:20,100
But that picture you were showing me of Bowser Jr.

956
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:21,180
the kids are standing.

957
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:22,980
I wonder if there's just like a little area

958
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:26,940
to walk in in the land where like you put AR goggles on

959
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:27,860
and you fight him or something.

960
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:28,700
I don't know.

961
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:29,660
They don't have goggles on,

962
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:31,540
which is what you do get on Mario Kart.

963
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:32,380
But I don't know.

964
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:33,220
What does this mean?

965
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:35,140
We're looking at a photo where, yeah,

966
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:38,860
Bowser Jr. is throwing a bomb and he's in that whatever.

967
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:42,500
If you know the name of the floating, the clown orb.

968
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:43,620
I did at one point.

969
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:44,460
I love that.

970
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:48,020
That first came in Mario, Super Mario World on Super Nintendo.

971
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:50,940
I mean, that's cool.

972
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:52,700
But then there's bullets flying around.

973
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:53,940
There's bombs on parachutes.

974
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:54,780
There's question mark boxes.

975
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:55,620
Like, what is that?

976
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:56,660
What are we looking at?

977
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:58,660
What is this going to be in reality?

978
00:39:58,660 --> 00:39:59,500
Yeah.

979
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:01,780
It's a good question.

980
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:04,860
It's insanely exciting.

981
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:05,700
Yeah.

982
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:08,420
Did you see how the bands have the little eyes

983
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:10,260
like all the hills do,

984
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:12,980
and all the inanimate objects do in Mario?

985
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:13,820
Yeah.

986
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:16,260
Little simple like lion eyes.

987
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:17,100
Go back to the Jason,

988
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:19,300
go back to that like promo picture with Mario Kart.

989
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:20,140
This one?

990
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:20,980
Yeah.

991
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:21,820
Yeah, this one.

992
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:24,260
Yeah.

993
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:26,140
So talking about Mario Kart,

994
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:26,980
it's a two,

995
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:30,940
it's basically there's going to be two cars full of humans.

996
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:32,380
And I think we've maybe talked to like,

997
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:33,540
we think this is what it was,

998
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:36,260
but this is now confirmed because you can see in the videos

999
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:39,380
now that they're inside that loading area.

1000
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:41,220
They don't have any footage from on the ride yet,

1001
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:43,460
but they know exactly that it's going to be two cars

1002
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:44,300
full of humans,

1003
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:46,380
four people in each car,

1004
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:48,500
and you'll be racing the other humans.

1005
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:52,020
But you will, I think from rumors,

1006
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:53,620
and this picture might confirm it,

1007
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:58,620
you will run into robots like Mario and Bowser on carts

1008
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:01,780
while you're like racing.

1009
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:04,900
And you think those are practical and not CG images.

1010
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:06,300
I don't know for sure,

1011
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:09,020
but I'm fingers crossed they are.

1012
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:10,860
Let's keep picking this photo apart

1013
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:13,300
because I haven't seen this.

1014
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:16,220
There's clearly an underwater level.

1015
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:19,980
There's a bunch of piranha fish, like bonefish.

1016
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:23,820
There's a big scary lava Bowser.

1017
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:26,340
You got a rainbow road way back there.

1018
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:27,740
I mean, that's not news to any,

1019
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:29,540
of course there's going to be some rainbow road,

1020
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:32,100
but seeing it practically is so exciting.

1021
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:33,620
You got a swamp and like a,

1022
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:34,940
it looks like a library,

1023
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:39,940
and it's a ghost house or a Luigi's Mansion kind of spot.

1024
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:41,620
Yeah. And that's all,

1025
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:42,940
I've heard rumors about that

1026
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:45,860
and then there's goggles on the ride.

1027
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:48,260
So that this makes, this kind of confirms,

1028
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:50,460
I think the rumors of, yeah,

1029
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:52,140
like maybe there's like even eight,

1030
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:54,580
eight different little worlds in the ride itself.

1031
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:56,580
Wow. Oh my God.

1032
00:41:56,580 --> 00:42:00,220
And then, and then they also confirmed in that video

1033
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:03,940
that I saw that you do have AR goggles.

1034
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:05,420
Do you have a picture of those Jason here?

1035
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:07,740
No, this is- I had no idea

1036
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:11,900
what the goggles were going to be and what a reveal.

1037
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:14,020
And it's like a little cap,

1038
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:17,220
it's like a little Mario cap with the goggles attached,

1039
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:19,820
which I saw somebody say online like,

1040
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:22,940
man, the cast members are really going to have to

1041
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:25,140
beg people to give these back.

1042
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:26,500
Oh yeah. Yes.

1043
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:27,340
Well, they're going to have to-

1044
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:29,540
Not to mention the post COVID, like,

1045
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:32,220
where like, this is, we haven't talked about this in general.

1046
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:35,500
Like what is going to happen to the idea of 3D glasses

1047
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:36,980
on rides for a while?

1048
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:39,060
Like, all right, we'll go back into the parks,

1049
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:40,860
but am I going to wear something

1050
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:44,380
that you put in front of me that someone else wore?

1051
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:47,020
As we've seen though, even before COVID,

1052
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:50,900
there is a very extensive cleaning process.

1053
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:52,820
Oh yes, we got a backstage view.

1054
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:55,340
We were very lucky at Despicable Me, Minion Mayhem

1055
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:57,740
and got a very confusing tour

1056
00:42:57,740 --> 00:43:00,100
that we still don't know why we got.

1057
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:02,940
I couldn't know, the cast members could not explain it to us,

1058
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:05,580
but they took us back and we saw how they cleaned the glasses.

1059
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:08,540
Yeah, look, the glasses start dry in a pile

1060
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:10,420
and then they end up in a nice line

1061
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:13,660
and they're really wet and, you know,

1062
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:15,740
put two and two together, okay?

1063
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:20,900
Great, I don't know, these droplets I trust.

1064
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:23,260
You see droplets, you know you're safe.

1065
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:25,660
I guess so, I mean, I'm glad,

1066
00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:30,260
I'm glad a lot of all of this is coming to Japan first

1067
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:32,180
because I just feel like those parks are,

1068
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:34,980
you know, the attention to detail is so much greater

1069
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:38,140
in a lot of ways, but like, especially that,

1070
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:42,980
because this land is opening February 4th, 2021.

1071
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:46,700
So, I mean, even just for like the psychological effect,

1072
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:50,980
they're really gonna need to clean those AR headsets

1073
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:51,820
at the beginning.

1074
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:54,180
Oh, of course, yeah.

1075
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:55,860
Yeah, really.

1076
00:43:55,860 --> 00:43:58,820
I can't believe it's this soon.

1077
00:43:58,820 --> 00:44:02,220
And, you know, we're gonna get various iterations of it.

1078
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:04,420
Maybe Florida will end up with all of it.

1079
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:07,900
We in Hollywood are going to get at least some portion of it.

1080
00:44:08,740 --> 00:44:10,980
Maybe the Marriott Cart Ride, maybe something else.

1081
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:14,700
But for a while, this will be, you know,

1082
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:18,060
Osaka will be the only place with the full version of it.

1083
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:21,380
And my wrong, or does this make Universal Japan

1084
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:24,460
now a must visit place?

1085
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:27,620
Like, you know, Mike and I both went to Japan

1086
00:44:27,620 --> 00:44:29,900
and we did not go to Universal Japan.

1087
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:31,620
I was certainly thinking about it,

1088
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:34,100
but like, you know, it was a little far from where I was,

1089
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:35,820
you'd really have to make a special trip.

1090
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:37,460
Now I'm making the special trip.

1091
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:38,700
Of course I'm going to this thing.

1092
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:39,540
Yeah.

1093
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:42,260
Well, yeah, I mean, this was supposed to open this year.

1094
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:45,300
I had, I said, I'm sure I've said this many times

1095
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:46,140
on the show.

1096
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:47,140
I kind of secretly was like,

1097
00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:49,380
maybe we could sneak a quick Universal trip

1098
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:51,140
to see this before the Olympics.

1099
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:55,780
But yeah, depending, especially obviously depending on

1100
00:44:55,780 --> 00:44:57,340
exactly what ours looks like.

1101
00:44:57,340 --> 00:44:59,780
And the construction, by the way, in Hollywood is crazy.

1102
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:02,300
Like it's very vertical.

1103
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:05,260
The whole Mario Kart building is enclosed.

1104
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:07,980
They seem like they're pretty far along.

1105
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:10,540
I wouldn't be surprised if like the end of next year

1106
00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:11,900
it opens here.

1107
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:12,740
Wow.

1108
00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:13,580
Yeah.

1109
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:15,900
But I mean, maybe it's that, maybe it's the summer after,

1110
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:18,460
maybe it's, I don't know.

1111
00:45:18,460 --> 00:45:21,660
I wonder if we get Yoshi's Adventure

1112
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:23,940
because it, like, I'm not, nobody said that

1113
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:25,420
and I suspect that we don't,

1114
00:45:25,420 --> 00:45:29,140
but being that it is like a seemingly a smaller ride

1115
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:31,940
that could be part of the same campus,

1116
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:33,260
maybe we do get it.

1117
00:45:33,260 --> 00:45:36,780
But I also don't, I'm kind of pulling that out of my ass.

1118
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:39,420
I just like see little Yoshi's on the same building

1119
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:42,180
as other stuff, but maybe it is a whole big mechanism

1120
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:44,100
that we won't be getting.

1121
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:44,940
I don't know.

1122
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:46,860
That's the, the rumor is we're not.

1123
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:48,340
And I think, I don't know.

1124
00:45:48,340 --> 00:45:49,180
I'm not sure.

1125
00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:50,820
I wouldn't be able to say for sure,

1126
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:52,580
but I think the rumor is we're not.

1127
00:45:52,580 --> 00:45:54,900
And I don't, I haven't seen anyone say like,

1128
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:56,300
oh, look at the construction.

1129
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:57,660
It does look like we're getting it yet.

1130
00:45:57,660 --> 00:46:01,460
So it takes more shape maybe.

1131
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:03,100
Maybe there'll be like a version of it where like,

1132
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:04,780
Yoshi's will pop out in that area,

1133
00:46:04,780 --> 00:46:06,300
but it's actually not a ride.

1134
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:07,140
Yeah.

1135
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:07,980
Who knows?

1136
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:08,820
But you get some 3D Yoshi's.

1137
00:46:08,820 --> 00:46:11,060
Can I read from that same press release,

1138
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:13,020
some details about Yoshi's Adventure,

1139
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:16,020
which it's easy to lose sight of Yoshi's Adventure

1140
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:18,060
being that Mario Kart is so exciting.

1141
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:20,820
But I mean, this sounds delightful.

1142
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:23,860
This is the story.

1143
00:46:23,860 --> 00:46:27,180
Captain Toad has forgotten his treasure map.

1144
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:29,820
Guests need to find the three colored eggs

1145
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:31,980
that lead the way to the golden egg

1146
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:34,540
that Captain Toad was seeking.

1147
00:46:34,540 --> 00:46:35,860
Guests will encounter a spectacular view

1148
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:38,900
of the Mushroom Kingdom from Mount Beanpole

1149
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:40,940
on this ride that's fun for the whole family.

1150
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:43,340
But why is Toad a captain?

1151
00:46:43,340 --> 00:46:45,100
Well, Scott, you're- I can't wait to find out.

1152
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:47,220
Scott, you did not obviously play the Nintendo game

1153
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:50,740
Captain Toad's Treasure Tracker.

1154
00:46:50,740 --> 00:46:51,820
I did not. Really?

1155
00:46:51,820 --> 00:46:53,260
I haven't heard of it even.

1156
00:46:53,260 --> 00:46:54,100
Yes.

1157
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:55,660
This is a couple, I believe a couple of years ago.

1158
00:46:55,660 --> 00:46:56,860
I'll double check.

1159
00:46:56,860 --> 00:46:58,820
Yes, where they made Toad a captain.

1160
00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:02,340
Captain Toad's Treasure Tracker.

1161
00:47:02,340 --> 00:47:04,860
He had been stuck in private for too long,

1162
00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:06,580
so he earned it.

1163
00:47:06,580 --> 00:47:07,420
Yeah.

1164
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:10,260
Yeah, it came out in 2014.

1165
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:14,140
And it was like a kind of a Mario, a little bit.

1166
00:47:14,140 --> 00:47:15,980
I don't, I play, did I play it?

1167
00:47:15,980 --> 00:47:16,980
I played a little of it.

1168
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:18,700
It was kind of a 3D platformer

1169
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:21,540
where yeah, you would find treasure as Toad.

1170
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:25,460
And Toad has like a big light on his giant Toad hat.

1171
00:47:26,340 --> 00:47:28,540
Like, hold on, let me share this with you

1172
00:47:28,540 --> 00:47:31,140
just so you can get a glimpse of what Toad looks like

1173
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:32,140
when he's a captain.

1174
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:33,340
Please, yes.

1175
00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:35,660
Show me this hat at once.

1176
00:47:35,660 --> 00:47:36,620
There you go.

1177
00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:39,700
Oh, like a, like a miner hat.

1178
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:41,660
And he's okay.

1179
00:47:41,660 --> 00:47:45,260
So he, and he's searching for stuff and I see,

1180
00:47:45,260 --> 00:47:47,780
but he's searching for the three eggs

1181
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:48,740
and you have to find them

1182
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:50,460
because then you can get the golden egg.

1183
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:51,780
Right, exactly.

1184
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:53,580
So yes, Captain Toad.

1185
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:55,980
But yes, I love that they're using

1186
00:47:55,980 --> 00:47:57,860
the Captain Toad mythology.

1187
00:47:58,620 --> 00:48:03,500
There's so much here and there's so much,

1188
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:07,340
there's so much, also when you see this, you go,

1189
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:10,620
your mind goes crazy with what else they can do

1190
00:48:10,620 --> 00:48:14,740
because if they're gonna do it this level right off the bat,

1191
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:15,900
what else are we getting?

1192
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:17,420
Now we know in Japan,

1193
00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:20,340
they've started on the expansion already.

1194
00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:21,580
Oh, okay.

1195
00:48:21,580 --> 00:48:24,460
There's like pictures of the, of them like even laying

1196
00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:27,020
like roller coaster track for the Donkey Kong area.

1197
00:48:27,020 --> 00:48:28,420
Oh my God.

1198
00:48:29,260 --> 00:48:32,100
There's a full Donkey Kong country, like jungle area

1199
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:35,820
with a mine cart coaster coming to Japan for sure.

1200
00:48:35,820 --> 00:48:38,700
Again, not to Galaxy's Edge compare,

1201
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:42,180
but like now here's a phase two that you save

1202
00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:43,460
that nobody's complaining about.

1203
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:45,980
Like, because they've, you're getting everything you want

1204
00:48:45,980 --> 00:48:47,420
in this phase one.

1205
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:50,180
And phase two sounds unbelievable,

1206
00:48:50,180 --> 00:48:53,380
but this rollout I don't think will be a problem

1207
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:54,220
for anybody.

1208
00:48:55,220 --> 00:48:56,940
Yeah, and it's like,

1209
00:48:56,940 --> 00:48:59,820
I don't think you're gonna go on the Donkey Kong jungle ride

1210
00:48:59,820 --> 00:49:02,500
and it's gonna be like, you're gonna be looking for Coaxium.

1211
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:05,540
I think you're gonna go, you're gonna find bananas,

1212
00:49:05,540 --> 00:49:06,700
you're gonna see Cranky Kong,

1213
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:09,100
you're gonna see Funky Kong and you're gonna go,

1214
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:11,140
that's all I want.

1215
00:49:11,140 --> 00:49:12,500
Yeah, thank you.

1216
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:15,460
Yeah, I don't wanna be a statistic

1217
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:18,460
who's moaning about Star Wars, but what I mean,

1218
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:23,460
come on Coaxium sucks, golden eggs, now we're talking.

1219
00:49:24,460 --> 00:49:25,420
This is great.

1220
00:49:25,620 --> 00:49:27,060
What should that ride be that?

1221
00:49:27,060 --> 00:49:29,140
I don't know, R2-D2 got lost.

1222
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:32,140
And then he had to get him with a magnet.

1223
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:32,980
We forgot him.

1224
00:49:32,980 --> 00:49:35,660
And he's stuck to the front of the Falcon.

1225
00:49:35,660 --> 00:49:37,860
You're just looking for, you see other droids,

1226
00:49:37,860 --> 00:49:40,700
see all the ones you like, you see them.

1227
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:43,220
You wave at them, they wave at you, they say you're great.

1228
00:49:43,220 --> 00:49:45,820
And Ewok got lost, you gotta go

1229
00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:48,140
deliver an Ewok to his friends.

1230
00:49:49,060 --> 00:49:51,660
Jar Jar Binks, it'd be nice to see Jar Jar Binks.

1231
00:49:51,660 --> 00:49:55,220
There should be so much more Jar Jar Binks in it, obviously.

1232
00:49:56,100 --> 00:49:58,420
I'm not being facetious, but when you look at this

1233
00:49:58,420 --> 00:50:01,100
and then there's like, you go, what is the,

1234
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:04,620
said F, what is Zelda gonna look like?

1235
00:50:04,620 --> 00:50:07,860
Like when they do Zelda, like holy shit.

1236
00:50:07,860 --> 00:50:09,540
And the sky is the limit here.

1237
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:11,580
Why'd you say shit?

1238
00:50:11,580 --> 00:50:13,100
I don't know.

1239
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:14,620
The rules are all over the map.

1240
00:50:14,620 --> 00:50:15,660
I'm very tired.

1241
00:50:17,020 --> 00:50:18,660
I don't know what rules I'm even.

1242
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:21,860
Yeah, we say the F word a lot.

1243
00:50:21,860 --> 00:50:23,100
It's the Patreon.

1244
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:23,940
Who cares?

1245
00:50:26,060 --> 00:50:30,060
Yeah, so, I mean, I'm a big fan

1246
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:31,900
and they haven't really done a great game in a while,

1247
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:34,180
but I am a big Star Fox fan.

1248
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:38,620
So when we're talking about Millennium Falcon,

1249
00:50:38,620 --> 00:50:40,580
my mind races with a, wouldn't it be great

1250
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:42,220
to get a full Star Fox ride?

1251
00:50:42,220 --> 00:50:45,220
Well, have they done a Donkey Kong Country game in a while?

1252
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:48,980
They have, but it hasn't been like,

1253
00:50:48,980 --> 00:50:51,220
they did a Donkey Kong Tropical Freeze

1254
00:50:51,220 --> 00:50:53,460
where the jungle freezes a couple years ago, I believe.

1255
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:54,300
Oh, that's fun.

1256
00:50:55,100 --> 00:50:55,940
Yeah, so.

1257
00:50:55,940 --> 00:50:57,740
What else is like primary mythology?

1258
00:50:57,740 --> 00:50:58,580
What would be like,

1259
00:50:58,580 --> 00:51:00,060
what would be the next thing to incorporate?

1260
00:51:00,060 --> 00:51:03,260
Is it just, is it another angle of Mario

1261
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:06,340
or does something else, it is Super Nintendo World,

1262
00:51:06,340 --> 00:51:07,700
not Super Mario World.

1263
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:09,420
Right, the sky is the limit here

1264
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:11,820
because there's so many different versions now

1265
00:51:11,820 --> 00:51:14,700
at this point, like, you know, there's Mario Galaxy,

1266
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:16,020
which is Mario in space.

1267
00:51:16,020 --> 00:51:17,180
There's Mario Odyssey.

1268
00:51:17,180 --> 00:51:19,180
There's Luigi's Mansion, which is, you know,

1269
00:51:19,180 --> 00:51:21,900
Luigi is a Ghostbuster, essentially.

1270
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:24,260
Like that's, I've seen people say like a haunted mansion

1271
00:51:24,260 --> 00:51:25,900
style Luigi ride.

1272
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:28,740
There's.

1273
00:51:28,740 --> 00:51:29,580
Metroid.

1274
00:51:29,580 --> 00:51:33,140
Wario, oh, like a scary aliens.

1275
00:51:33,140 --> 00:51:33,980
Like a scary shooter.

1276
00:51:33,980 --> 00:51:35,220
Style Metroid game.

1277
00:51:35,220 --> 00:51:36,060
Yeah.

1278
00:51:36,060 --> 00:51:37,100
Sure.

1279
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:37,940
I mean, Metroid's very cool.

1280
00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:40,180
What was that other one that was like kind of a paintball

1281
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:42,780
game that was like a big hit a few years ago?

1282
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:44,100
Do you wanna talk about the kids that like.

1283
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:46,060
Are you talking about Splatoon?

1284
00:51:46,060 --> 00:51:49,220
That was a Nintendo creation, wasn't it?

1285
00:51:49,220 --> 00:51:50,060
Is that right?

1286
00:51:50,060 --> 00:51:51,500
I can't, I don't know that.

1287
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:52,340
I'm not sure.

1288
00:51:53,220 --> 00:51:55,180
There's Pikmin, which I've heard of rumors

1289
00:51:55,180 --> 00:51:56,860
that Pikmin are gonna be a little hanging around.

1290
00:51:56,860 --> 00:51:58,060
Oh, that's cute.

1291
00:51:58,060 --> 00:51:59,620
Game and Watch Gallery?

1292
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:02,020
All of the old guys?

1293
00:52:02,020 --> 00:52:05,220
I want some weird Wario ride.

1294
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:06,780
I'm a big Wario fan.

1295
00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:07,740
Sure.

1296
00:52:07,740 --> 00:52:08,580
Yeah.

1297
00:52:08,580 --> 00:52:10,220
Talk about dump truck asses.

1298
00:52:10,220 --> 00:52:11,220
That's right.

1299
00:52:14,580 --> 00:52:17,060
I wanna see Wario's dump truck ass.

1300
00:52:18,740 --> 00:52:20,380
I'm sure, I mean, they'll probably get a glimpse

1301
00:52:20,380 --> 00:52:23,140
of him on Mario Kart, but he deserves his own ride.

1302
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:23,980
Yeah.

1303
00:52:25,020 --> 00:52:26,460
I mean, this whole thing, like this is,

1304
00:52:26,460 --> 00:52:30,500
this absolutely is its own theme park.

1305
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:31,420
If they want it to be.

1306
00:52:31,420 --> 00:52:33,860
It's almost bizarre that it's a land and not,

1307
00:52:33,860 --> 00:52:36,780
and I just think the excitement for this is gonna be

1308
00:52:36,780 --> 00:52:37,620
through the roof.

1309
00:52:37,620 --> 00:52:39,420
This is gonna be bonkers.

1310
00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:43,700
This is, yeah, I cannot imagine that this is not going to be

1311
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:49,700
just crazy packed for five years, if not longer.

1312
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:50,540
Oh, yeah.

1313
00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:51,380
Yeah.

1314
00:52:51,380 --> 00:52:52,980
I think, yeah, this is gonna be,

1315
00:52:54,340 --> 00:52:57,660
I think it's going to blow expectations out of the water,

1316
00:52:57,660 --> 00:53:00,620
whereas Galaxy's Edge might not have,

1317
00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:02,700
it was still very popular, but not like

1318
00:53:02,700 --> 00:53:04,660
maybe they thought it was going to be.

1319
00:53:06,260 --> 00:53:08,420
So yeah, very exciting.

1320
00:53:08,420 --> 00:53:09,260
Yeah, geez.

1321
00:53:10,300 --> 00:53:11,700
I mean, where do we go from there?

1322
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:14,020
Cause there's more news, but it's not,

1323
00:53:14,020 --> 00:53:16,660
now with the pity, the poor thing that has to follow

1324
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:17,780
the Super Nintendo World.

1325
00:53:17,780 --> 00:53:18,620
Oh, yeah, I know.

1326
00:53:18,780 --> 00:53:20,420
I think I can wrap it all.

1327
00:53:20,420 --> 00:53:21,740
I can tie it all together.

1328
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:23,580
I mean, this is less exciting.

1329
00:53:23,580 --> 00:53:24,820
It kind of covers the world.

1330
00:53:24,820 --> 00:53:26,420
Oh, Mike, did you have something?

1331
00:53:27,340 --> 00:53:28,180
Well, I do.

1332
00:53:28,180 --> 00:53:29,460
I have a little something here.

1333
00:53:30,460 --> 00:53:32,620
I have something, I just, there was a piece of news

1334
00:53:32,620 --> 00:53:35,420
that came out and it really isn't a piece of news

1335
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:38,380
that is surprising to us,

1336
00:53:40,060 --> 00:53:42,940
but it is, I saw a lot of people tweeting and sharing it.

1337
00:53:42,940 --> 00:53:45,260
So I just wanted to acknowledge it real quick.

1338
00:53:45,260 --> 00:53:46,660
There was a CNN article

1339
00:53:46,820 --> 00:53:49,780
a couple of weeks ago.

1340
00:53:49,780 --> 00:53:51,620
The title is of the article is George Clooney

1341
00:53:51,620 --> 00:53:56,220
once gave 14 friends $1 million each in cash.

1342
00:53:56,220 --> 00:53:57,060
All right.

1343
00:53:57,060 --> 00:53:57,900
So we just got a lot of-

1344
00:53:57,900 --> 00:53:59,260
I made my thoughts.

1345
00:54:00,540 --> 00:54:02,700
Yeah, yeah, no, this is real quick.

1346
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:03,540
This is real quick.

1347
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:06,100
This is one of the people, people were talking about it.

1348
00:54:06,100 --> 00:54:08,100
So I just wanted to acknowledge it that yes,

1349
00:54:08,100 --> 00:54:10,260
obviously this is catching on.

1350
00:54:10,260 --> 00:54:13,020
CNN felt like they needed to do another piece about it.

1351
00:54:14,300 --> 00:54:16,220
And this, I'm just going to take this opportunity too,

1352
00:54:16,780 --> 00:54:17,980
and I've already forgotten the name.

1353
00:54:17,980 --> 00:54:21,900
Jason and I, of course, we're starting our own-

1354
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:23,260
Buenos Ninos. Tequila line.

1355
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:25,700
That's right, yeah. Buenos Ninos Tequila.

1356
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:28,420
And we had offered to Scottie politely declined

1357
00:54:28,420 --> 00:54:29,240
and that's fine.

1358
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:30,080
That's totally cool.

1359
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:32,180
We don't always have to be in sync with each other.

1360
00:54:32,180 --> 00:54:33,020
No, we can have side endeavors.

1361
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:34,940
But I do want to say that I will say,

1362
00:54:34,940 --> 00:54:37,940
we wanted a third person and I offered it to someone

1363
00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:42,820
and he has sent me a response.

1364
00:54:42,860 --> 00:54:47,060
And I asked, I said, will you go in on this with us?

1365
00:54:47,060 --> 00:54:49,000
And it is a friend of the show.

1366
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:51,460
Interesting.

1367
00:54:51,460 --> 00:54:53,140
I have a feeling.

1368
00:54:53,140 --> 00:54:55,140
I have a tingling feeling.

1369
00:54:55,140 --> 00:54:57,660
And I say, look, I actually don't know

1370
00:54:57,660 --> 00:55:00,660
what is in this audio message.

1371
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:02,540
I've been sitting on this and I want to respond.

1372
00:55:02,540 --> 00:55:05,340
I want to hear this live with you guys.

1373
00:55:05,340 --> 00:55:08,100
Okay, an offer was put out and-

1374
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:11,060
Yeah, so here, I'll say this.

1375
00:55:11,060 --> 00:55:16,060
I offered it to Nick Mundy to be the third member

1376
00:55:16,300 --> 00:55:19,260
of the Buenos Ninos Tequila crew.

1377
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:24,000
The, well, hardly a Bueno Nino though.

1378
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,180
Right, of course.

1379
00:55:25,180 --> 00:55:27,020
But maybe we need a-

1380
00:55:27,020 --> 00:55:28,460
Molo hombre.

1381
00:55:28,460 --> 00:55:30,380
Of course.

1382
00:55:30,380 --> 00:55:31,900
So let me just play this and we'll see this

1383
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:33,980
and react to this now to see what he had said

1384
00:55:33,980 --> 00:55:37,020
after I made a very generous offer to him.

1385
00:55:37,820 --> 00:55:42,820
Hey, Carlson and Sheridan, right?

1386
00:55:43,780 --> 00:55:44,860
Sheridan?

1387
00:55:44,860 --> 00:55:45,700
Yeah, Sheridan.

1388
00:55:45,700 --> 00:55:46,540
Hey, it's my name.

1389
00:55:46,540 --> 00:55:47,380
Hey, what's up?

1390
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:50,980
Yeah, sorry, if it's hard to hear me, I'm in my pool.

1391
00:55:52,180 --> 00:55:55,180
Look, I'll take the 20% for the beer.

1392
00:55:59,260 --> 00:56:03,100
But I want to be paid in crypto.

1393
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:06,540
Chainlink Fence and OMG Coin, all right?

1394
00:56:06,580 --> 00:56:08,260
I'm now the crypto dandy.

1395
00:56:09,060 --> 00:56:13,340
And I will not take a picture next to you on a bike

1396
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:16,100
unless you up it to 30%.

1397
00:56:17,260 --> 00:56:20,980
The dandy needs his coins.

1398
00:56:22,580 --> 00:56:23,780
All right, so just send me the beer

1399
00:56:23,780 --> 00:56:26,980
and I'll do a taste test and then, yeah,

1400
00:56:26,980 --> 00:56:29,020
let's sign up the paperwork.

1401
00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:32,540
All right, yeah, all right, bye.

1402
00:56:34,340 --> 00:56:36,040
It's Mundy, by the way.

1403
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:37,040
No.

1404
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:38,360
Okay.

1405
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:40,320
Okay, all right.

1406
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:43,320
It's your offer, I guess inconclusive.

1407
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:45,440
I guess it's not a no, it's not a no.

1408
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:46,520
It's not a no.

1409
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:50,760
I offered him 20% and Jason and I splitting 40

1410
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:51,880
like we offered Scott.

1411
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:55,440
So it sounds like he would be in if we up it to 30

1412
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:57,040
and it also sounds like he wants his money

1413
00:56:57,040 --> 00:57:00,240
in cryptocurrency, which it's possible, look,

1414
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:01,920
as far as crypto, which I haven't talked about,

1415
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:03,880
it looks like we might be in a bull market, fellas,

1416
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:05,160
as far as crypto is concerned.

1417
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:09,160
Yeah, indeed, it's a good time to be the crypto dandy.

1418
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:10,800
Is that, was it the Bitcoin dandy?

1419
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:13,000
What was he, which kind of dandy?

1420
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,120
Or did he say coin?

1421
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:15,200
Did he say coin dandy?

1422
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:16,720
He's the coin dandy?

1423
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:20,680
I will say this, I text with Mundy sometimes about crypto

1424
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:22,820
and there's a lot of different crypto characters

1425
00:57:22,820 --> 00:57:24,880
on Twitter that I am entertained by

1426
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:27,120
and one of them is named the Coin Dad.

1427
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:33,200
And Mundy can't be Coin Dad, so I think that's,

1428
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:34,040
should I go back? No.

1429
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:36,080
And other people, there's a whole thing with crypto

1430
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:37,880
where people like to buy Lambos.

1431
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:41,480
Crypto people like Lambos, Lamborghinis,

1432
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:43,920
so presumably there's, you know,

1433
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:47,400
there's a rap song I'm very fond of that goes like,

1434
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:49,960
crypto fam, we're going to Lambo land.

1435
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:53,400
So he can't be a land, probably a Lambo guy.

1436
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:57,600
Maybe he could be, maybe Lambo lad isn't taken, but.

1437
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:58,440
That's pretty good.

1438
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:01,400
Yeah, but it's his choice and Coin Dandy

1439
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:03,280
sounds fine to me.

1440
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:06,280
I respect him, I respect his sticking to his guns

1441
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:10,280
on certain photography and motorcycle based issues.

1442
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:11,880
He's a man of character.

1443
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:14,360
I think it's going to be, I mean, if, okay,

1444
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:18,120
I think we can probably meet him at 30%, but let's see.

1445
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:21,720
Maybe when COVID is over, Jason, you, me and Mundy

1446
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:23,920
will take a picture on bicycles together

1447
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:25,160
and sort of get this thing back going.

1448
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:28,320
Well, it sounds like you and I are going to be on bicycles

1449
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:30,840
and it seems like the best we can hope for

1450
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:34,160
is him begrudgingly standing next to us.

1451
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:35,160
Yeah, I guess you're right.

1452
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:36,000
I don't know, maybe this isn't going to,

1453
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,840
we're going to have to do a lot of this off podcast,

1454
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:42,440
but it sounds like there'll be more negotiations

1455
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:46,240
to get our tequila brand, Buenos Dinos, off the ground.

1456
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:48,800
Cause yeah, we got to get it rolling here.

1457
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:50,360
We got to get on this gravy train.

1458
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:54,960
I mean, celebrity alcohol coming out every day practically.

1459
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:57,160
No, look, I'm regretting it a bit.

1460
00:58:57,160 --> 00:58:58,640
I guess I'm a little jealous.

1461
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:00,840
I mean, of the three of you getting to hang out,

1462
00:59:00,840 --> 00:59:04,360
even if it is two of you on motorcycles

1463
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:07,040
and the other one just glaring at them.

1464
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:09,200
I don't know, maybe I need to get it, find a way in.

1465
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:11,720
Can I be the guy who makes the caps or something?

1466
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:14,720
The, oh, the caps of the tequila?

1467
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:16,560
Yeah, yeah, can I be your cap guy?

1468
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:17,920
It's not like Mundy didn't know what the alcohol was,

1469
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:20,480
but that's, I mean, maybe, yeah, you can be the cap guy.

1470
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:22,200
I can be the cap dandy.

1471
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:23,040
The cap dandy, sure.

1472
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:23,880
Oh, okay.

1473
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:27,280
Yeah, we can talk about that.

1474
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:28,640
Yeah, we'll talk about.

1475
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:31,040
All right, then I think I'm not betraying anything.

1476
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:32,480
I'm not involved in the tequila.

1477
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:34,720
I'm just involved in, really involved in keeping

1478
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:38,040
the tequila inside, maybe, in some cases,

1479
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:39,880
preventing people from having it.

1480
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:43,560
So maybe this is my way to get involved.

1481
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:45,320
You'll be like the third silent partner

1482
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:47,880
of Casamigos a little bit more.

1483
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:48,720
Yes, yeah.

1484
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:53,120
You're a party boy, but you're not sort of out in front

1485
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:53,960
in the marketing.

1486
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:56,640
Man, I've been an ooey gooey guy at the beginning of this

1487
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:58,000
and a party boy, and now I'm like,

1488
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,520
the one that I wanna be is the cap dandy.

1489
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:02,160
What's going on?

1490
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:04,240
Well, this is all, again, this is all off podcast

1491
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:05,880
negotiation, I think.

1492
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:06,720
Yeah.

1493
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:09,280
Okay, well, now what?

1494
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:10,600
Well, I'll wrap it.

1495
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:12,960
I mean, I just had some rapid fire stuff.

1496
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:16,400
So bringing it back to domestic,

1497
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:19,360
and I guess some international of the Disney parks.

1498
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:24,080
Josh Demaro addressed the International Association

1499
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:25,960
of Amusement Parks and Attractions.

1500
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:27,720
It's a trade group, the IAAPA,

1501
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:32,440
just kind of giving the Disney parks

1502
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:35,000
like an update about where projects are,

1503
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,800
and the Disney parks blog kind of ran down on them too.

1504
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:44,200
I was interested to discover the IAAPA was founded in 1918

1505
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:46,600
compared to the TIA,

1506
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:50,520
the themed entertainment association was founded in 1991

1507
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:52,600
and is headquartered right in Burbank.

1508
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:55,160
So we could go down there, you know?

1509
01:00:56,160 --> 01:01:00,000
Yeah, it's by the wildcard.

1510
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,520
We've eaten below them.

1511
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:05,320
So we could petition, or we could pitch ourselves in person.

1512
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:06,200
So.

1513
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:07,040
Yeah.

1514
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:09,240
Maybe if they're pliable and willing to,

1515
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:12,920
if they'll accept some tequila-based bribery,

1516
01:01:14,320 --> 01:01:17,560
and if not that, then an angry third partner

1517
01:01:17,560 --> 01:01:19,640
who now goes by coin dandy,

1518
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:23,360
waving a bottle around threateningly

1519
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:24,880
in front of their faces,

1520
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:26,760
then we'll for sure get to host this thing.

1521
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:28,400
Well, he's gonna have to have a cane.

1522
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:30,240
If he's a true dandy, he's gonna have to have

1523
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:34,200
like some sort of ornate cane to waggle at them, you know?

1524
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:36,000
Yeah, I think he'd look great with that.

1525
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,520
That's a great accessory for the coin dandy.

1526
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:39,480
Oh, I agree.

1527
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:42,600
So yeah, post-COVID, that's gonna be,

1528
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:43,600
we're gonna go right over there.

1529
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:44,440
Yeah.

1530
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:46,000
I'm gonna get the vaccine and I'm gonna drive right over.

1531
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:46,840
Yeah.

1532
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:48,040
To the stop.

1533
01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:48,880
The headquarters.

1534
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:49,720
The headquarters.

1535
01:01:49,720 --> 01:01:51,720
For some meats, for some freshly carved meats.

1536
01:01:51,720 --> 01:01:52,560
Yeah.

1537
01:01:52,560 --> 01:01:54,280
Get all full of meat rage.

1538
01:01:54,280 --> 01:01:55,320
Yeah.

1539
01:01:55,320 --> 01:01:56,160
So.

1540
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:57,720
What else you got, Jason?

1541
01:01:57,720 --> 01:02:00,560
Basically, like the gist of all of this

1542
01:02:00,560 --> 01:02:03,120
was like not really any revelations.

1543
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:07,520
A lot of like flogging about like,

1544
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:09,800
it was so hard to lay off.

1545
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:12,480
I think they're up to 20% of the TheeBart employees.

1546
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:13,320
You're gonna end with a layoff?

1547
01:02:13,320 --> 01:02:15,280
No, I'm just saying.

1548
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:16,120
I mean.

1549
01:02:16,120 --> 01:02:18,040
Yeah, they keep laying people off.

1550
01:02:18,040 --> 01:02:19,080
They keep laying people off.

1551
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:19,920
It sucks ass.

1552
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:20,760
It's awful.

1553
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:22,600
The bye-bye biker went without a paycheck

1554
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:23,920
for about a month. For a month.

1555
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:27,440
And then was back to collecting $20 million a month

1556
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:30,200
while they laid off like a hundred thousand people.

1557
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:31,040
It sucks ass.

1558
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:32,920
Of course we'd talk about it all the time

1559
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:34,480
if we weren't a comedy puck.

1560
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:35,360
It's so awful.

1561
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:36,840
Yeah, just just just wretched.

1562
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:38,480
And if anybody listening has been affected,

1563
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:39,640
we're terribly sorry.

1564
01:02:39,640 --> 01:02:40,480
Yeah.

1565
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:41,320
I'm sure they have.

1566
01:02:41,320 --> 01:02:43,240
It's so many people at this point

1567
01:02:43,240 --> 01:02:46,400
while the Eiger and Chapek get their millions.

1568
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:47,240
Yeah.

1569
01:02:47,240 --> 01:02:49,400
And I just, I mean, these trade presentations,

1570
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:50,360
I watch a lot of them.

1571
01:02:50,360 --> 01:02:52,360
They're very dry and boring.

1572
01:02:52,360 --> 01:02:55,480
I just had to laugh though at the one where he's like,

1573
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:56,880
you know, let's ask ourselves,

1574
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:58,880
why not take our guests to the moon

1575
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:01,680
or bring the moon to our guests?

1576
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:04,440
Well, the reason you can't, Josh,

1577
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:06,720
the reason you cannot dare to dream big

1578
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:10,320
is because you unfortunately laid off the moon crew.

1579
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:11,160
That is why.

1580
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:13,640
So moon stuff's gonna have to wait.

1581
01:03:13,640 --> 01:03:16,360
The gist of all this like project updates they put out

1582
01:03:16,360 --> 01:03:18,800
is like if it's broken ground, it's still happening.

1583
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:19,880
Tron's still going.

1584
01:03:19,880 --> 01:03:22,160
Guardians of the Galaxy Cosmic Rewind.

1585
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:24,800
The Omni Coaster is still going.

1586
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:28,880
Remy's Ratatouille Adventure, Avengers Campus, you know.

1587
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:31,080
The video of the Omni Coaster, by the way,

1588
01:03:31,080 --> 01:03:32,000
does look cool.

1589
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:32,840
Oh, that's great.

1590
01:03:32,840 --> 01:03:33,660
It does look cool.

1591
01:03:33,660 --> 01:03:34,680
Yeah, for Guardians of the Galaxy.

1592
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:36,560
Then back, okay, back to the.

1593
01:03:36,560 --> 01:03:38,160
Back to the rapid fire.

1594
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:40,720
The Galactic Star Cruisers, they showed the rooms

1595
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:43,920
where as I've said in the past, people will make love.

1596
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:45,480
They're very tiny.

1597
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:48,920
There's bunk bed holes carved out of the wall.

1598
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:51,960
How many people are gonna lose their minds

1599
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:54,040
in those Star Wars hotel rooms?

1600
01:03:54,040 --> 01:03:55,560
Those tiny little boxes.

1601
01:03:57,320 --> 01:03:58,280
No window.

1602
01:03:58,280 --> 01:03:59,120
Yeah.

1603
01:03:59,120 --> 01:04:01,240
You know, I'm just, I've just been after months and months

1604
01:04:01,240 --> 01:04:04,120
of being trapped in my own home.

1605
01:04:04,120 --> 01:04:06,720
Now I wanna be trapped somewhere without a window.

1606
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:07,760
To the metal box.

1607
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:10,040
You pay a lot of money to do it.

1608
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:12,280
Couldn't they be like themed like Anakin's room

1609
01:04:12,280 --> 01:04:14,920
in the prequel, like Padme's room in the prequels?

1610
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:16,640
Yeah, Padme's room.

1611
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:17,480
Yeah.

1612
01:04:17,480 --> 01:04:18,320
You know what I'm talking about.

1613
01:04:18,320 --> 01:04:19,560
Of course. Yes.

1614
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:20,400
Yeah.

1615
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:22,080
When she's sitting on the couch.

1616
01:04:22,080 --> 01:04:24,240
Remember when Obi-Wan jumps through,

1617
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:26,280
there's like a droid that's like surveilling,

1618
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:27,960
like doing surveillance on them.

1619
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:30,880
And he jumps out the window and he flies through Coruscant.

1620
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:31,720
Yeah.

1621
01:04:31,720 --> 01:04:32,920
That's.

1622
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:33,880
Sure.

1623
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:35,240
You know what I'm talking about, prequels.

1624
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:38,240
And hey, since you bring up the prequels,

1625
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:40,840
I had a note written down because they, you know,

1626
01:04:40,840 --> 01:04:43,280
Avengers campus clearly not opening for a while

1627
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:44,560
at California Adventure,

1628
01:04:44,560 --> 01:04:46,800
but they started selling the spider bots

1629
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:49,080
or they're about to at downtown Disney.

1630
01:04:49,080 --> 01:04:50,960
And that's kind of like episode one,

1631
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:53,960
cause you could get sent away from Mace Windu action figure

1632
01:04:53,960 --> 01:04:56,720
months and months before episode one came out.

1633
01:04:56,720 --> 01:04:57,560
So.

1634
01:04:59,080 --> 01:05:01,480
So you're getting the hype real for the spider bots,

1635
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:05,080
which I believe you have to like beat in that ride

1636
01:05:05,080 --> 01:05:07,080
and the Spider-Man ride coming to California Adventure.

1637
01:05:07,080 --> 01:05:08,280
Yeah, wait, yeah, they're bad.

1638
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:09,680
The webs, what's that Scott?

1639
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:11,880
The spider bots are bad.

1640
01:05:11,880 --> 01:05:14,600
I think they're like out of control for some reason,

1641
01:05:14,600 --> 01:05:16,160
but they're not necessarily bad.

1642
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:17,320
I think they go like some,

1643
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:19,080
maybe like some villain breaks in

1644
01:05:19,080 --> 01:05:21,200
and like programs them to do something.

1645
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:22,040
That's my understanding.

1646
01:05:22,040 --> 01:05:22,880
They're like flubbers.

1647
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:23,720
Yeah.

1648
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:24,760
Like the flubbers not bad,

1649
01:05:24,760 --> 01:05:27,560
but then they have a party that's way out of control.

1650
01:05:27,560 --> 01:05:28,400
Right.

1651
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:30,440
It's just too many bits, just a zoning issue.

1652
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:35,440
And then of course, and then you use your wrist

1653
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:40,160
and you do spider, the thwip, the Spider-Man thwip thing,

1654
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:44,240
motion with your fingers to shoot them with webs on that.

1655
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:45,680
Yeah.

1656
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:46,680
On that ride.

1657
01:05:46,680 --> 01:05:50,920
So I assume they ordered a certain amount of spider bots

1658
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:54,240
and we're like, oh shit, we have to move some of these.

1659
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:55,080
Yeah.

1660
01:05:55,080 --> 01:05:56,760
We got to move some of these out before next summer.

1661
01:05:56,760 --> 01:05:59,200
Mike, I think they ordered a lot of skews

1662
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:01,600
and they have shirts and all sorts of things

1663
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:03,440
because I believe it's expanded now.

1664
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:06,160
Like, hey, we got Avengers campus,

1665
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:09,240
we got shirts and jackets, we got a lot for sale.

1666
01:06:09,240 --> 01:06:10,080
Christmas is coming.

1667
01:06:10,080 --> 01:06:14,080
A lot of Galaxy's edge merges in Target as well.

1668
01:06:14,080 --> 01:06:16,200
They just pushed out a lot of that stuff into Target

1669
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:18,640
because yeah, that started.

1670
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:19,920
They have nowhere to sell it.

1671
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:20,760
So it's gotta go somewhere.

1672
01:06:20,760 --> 01:06:22,840
Yeah, and they're selling Aronto wraps

1673
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:24,560
at the Starbucks in Target.

1674
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:27,240
I mean, that sounds great.

1675
01:06:27,240 --> 01:06:29,400
I'd be psyched, it's like a mobile order.

1676
01:06:30,440 --> 01:06:32,640
Each Starbucks has a big podracer engine

1677
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:34,200
in the middle of it now.

1678
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:35,640
They're actually cooking, yeah,

1679
01:06:35,640 --> 01:06:38,880
they're heating up every drink, every single drink

1680
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:41,160
with a giant podracer engine.

1681
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:43,600
That's the only way to prepare one of those.

1682
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:47,920
It takes more power, like 40 times the power

1683
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:51,160
of the entire Target just to make your coffee hot.

1684
01:06:51,160 --> 01:06:52,480
Yeah. Yeah.

1685
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:53,680
So that's fun, that's good.

1686
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:54,520
Targets have been great.

1687
01:06:54,520 --> 01:06:55,400
Yeah, if you haven't been,

1688
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:56,680
maybe people haven't been going out,

1689
01:06:56,680 --> 01:07:00,440
but the Galaxy's edgified Targets are great.

1690
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:02,080
Great job, Brian Cornell.

1691
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:05,920
They moved a lot of, yeah, statues,

1692
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:07,840
ancient Jedi statues into Target.

1693
01:07:07,880 --> 01:07:12,880
So yeah, so you're seeing things pop up

1694
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:15,720
that would have been in the parks.

1695
01:07:15,720 --> 01:07:17,920
You're seeing Butterbeer pop up in City Walk

1696
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:20,360
because Universal Hollywood is not open as well.

1697
01:07:20,360 --> 01:07:24,560
There's a little, where the Ludo Bird chicken was,

1698
01:07:24,560 --> 01:07:25,720
you can now get a Butterbeer

1699
01:07:25,720 --> 01:07:28,560
and some other Harry Potter treats, I guess.

1700
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:30,440
But now you have to take it to go

1701
01:07:30,440 --> 01:07:32,280
because everything's closed in the city.

1702
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:34,840
But also we're on stay at home orders again,

1703
01:07:34,840 --> 01:07:36,520
so we're not supposed to be outside.

1704
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:40,120
Yes, we are, I'm supposed to right now,

1705
01:07:40,120 --> 01:07:45,120
essentially go to a certain drive-through

1706
01:07:45,560 --> 01:07:50,000
theme park experience that I'm questioning.

1707
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:53,120
Well, if everything, if I can't do anything in this city,

1708
01:07:53,120 --> 01:07:54,840
why can I do that?

1709
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:57,800
But I guess I can and I'm going to.

1710
01:07:57,800 --> 01:08:00,360
I wouldn't put it past this certain entity

1711
01:08:00,360 --> 01:08:04,880
to just cancel it and not tell anybody.

1712
01:08:05,040 --> 01:08:08,880
I'll get there and the park will be dark.

1713
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:11,000
There's just no lights on

1714
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,680
and there was no email or refund.

1715
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:15,800
The rules are confusing

1716
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:19,320
because you can still go into stores, but you can't.

1717
01:08:19,320 --> 01:08:20,160
What?

1718
01:08:20,160 --> 01:08:24,800
Oh boy, well, this might be coming up for us soon.

1719
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:25,680
Yeah. Yeah.

1720
01:08:25,680 --> 01:08:27,600
So anyway, yes.

1721
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:29,040
We'll save it.

1722
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:32,080
Oh, and one last funny detail.

1723
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:34,360
I don't believe this was announced in the presentation,

1724
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:36,160
but people have started to notice,

1725
01:08:37,160 --> 01:08:39,800
it mentioned in some literature,

1726
01:08:39,800 --> 01:08:41,520
people are like, what's going to get canceled?

1727
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:44,560
What's not going to happen now from like announced stuff?

1728
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:47,800
And other than the spaceship Earth redo

1729
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:50,680
is pretty much confirmed to be canceled.

1730
01:08:50,680 --> 01:08:54,080
It appears that the festival center at Epcot,

1731
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:59,080
that cool three-story sort of like plant-filled area

1732
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:02,800
that was going to be a big part of a world celebration,

1733
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:05,360
as we all know the different worlds.

1734
01:09:05,360 --> 01:09:07,120
Festival center has been downgraded

1735
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:10,280
to the Epcot festival area.

1736
01:09:10,280 --> 01:09:12,880
So make of that what you will,

1737
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:15,480
but I think that's pretty funny.

1738
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:20,080
The Epcot festival bench.

1739
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:20,920
Yeah.

1740
01:09:21,960 --> 01:09:25,520
It's a nice bench, a new bench or refurbished bench.

1741
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:26,600
All right, it's not a new bench,

1742
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:28,800
but it's got a fresh coat of paint.

1743
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:33,640
And yeah, it says like the world,

1744
01:09:33,640 --> 01:09:36,520
they painted the words of the world on the back.

1745
01:09:36,520 --> 01:09:38,200
It says harmony on it.

1746
01:09:38,200 --> 01:09:39,040
Really big.

1747
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:39,880
Yeah, you know.

1748
01:09:39,880 --> 01:09:41,200
It's gonna be great.

1749
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:43,520
It's a great, big, beautiful tomorrow.

1750
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:45,120
What a bizarre world,

1751
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:47,720
yeah, where it's this odd compromised list,

1752
01:09:47,720 --> 01:09:51,360
and then, you know, and this Titan of Imagineering

1753
01:09:51,360 --> 01:09:53,920
is stepping down, maybe partially fueled by

1754
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:56,360
that none of his dreams can come true

1755
01:09:56,360 --> 01:09:58,000
for the next decade or so.

1756
01:09:58,400 --> 01:09:59,920
Well, I guess that's just what it is.

1757
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:02,080
That's what we live in, but meanwhile in Japan,

1758
01:10:02,080 --> 01:10:05,360
holy shit, the greatest thing you've ever seen.

1759
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:06,400
It's unbelievable.

1760
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:09,480
I think Universal's winning the war again.

1761
01:10:09,480 --> 01:10:10,640
Yeah, and I especially,

1762
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:12,520
and then of course the cool Nintendo thing

1763
01:10:12,520 --> 01:10:15,520
is built out here is like maybe halfway done.

1764
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:17,400
I don't know how, yeah, we're like,

1765
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:21,040
Universal is going to end up with a little bit of an edge

1766
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:24,720
because it'll have like the biggest, newest, coolest thing

1767
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:25,760
just kind of by luck.

1768
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:27,920
I mean, Avengers campus will open next year,

1769
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:31,840
but I cannot imagine that's going to be anywhere near

1770
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:34,440
as well received as Nintendo land.

1771
01:10:34,440 --> 01:10:36,120
Yeah, probably not.

1772
01:10:37,080 --> 01:10:39,800
But yeah, I mean, as long as there's cool things

1773
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:44,800
happening somewhere, and if we get some Nintendo stuff

1774
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:50,000
and if we get Coin Daddy's, Coin Dandy's firm,

1775
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:55,840
firm, his wise grip on this business enterprise,

1776
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:02,120
then I think maybe 2021 is going to be great.

1777
01:11:02,120 --> 01:11:05,600
Yeah, so I think, yeah, as long as I look,

1778
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:08,760
there's, I saw tweets, vaccines are in the air,

1779
01:11:08,760 --> 01:11:10,920
they've landed places.

1780
01:11:10,920 --> 01:11:13,280
Well, you know, they're already in the water.

1781
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:17,320
All right, Jason, that's another podcast.

1782
01:11:17,320 --> 01:11:21,400
All right, you survived podcast, The Ride,

1783
01:11:22,360 --> 01:11:25,720
news and stories and odds and ends edition.

1784
01:11:26,720 --> 01:11:30,240
More fun coming as always to podcast

1785
01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:31,240
The Ride of the Second Gate.

1786
01:11:31,240 --> 01:11:33,440
Stay subscribed as you are now.

1787
01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:36,160
Tell your friends to subscribe.

1788
01:11:36,160 --> 01:11:38,600
I don't know what to do as the call to action at the end.

1789
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:40,680
Just like, you don't have to tell your friends,

1790
01:11:40,680 --> 01:11:43,760
but do, I don't know, we're doing fun stuff here.

1791
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:48,640
And some fun sequels coming out soon.

1792
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:49,640
That's the tease.

1793
01:11:49,640 --> 01:11:53,880
That's some fun sequels, perhaps this month,

1794
01:11:53,880 --> 01:11:56,760
holiday treats, so stay tuned.

1795
01:11:56,760 --> 01:11:59,560
I'm gonna go drive my car through a theme park.

1796
01:12:02,160 --> 01:12:03,000
Goodbye.

1797
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:03,840
Bye.

1798
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:04,353
Goodbye.
