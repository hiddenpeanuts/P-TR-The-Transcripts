1
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:09,680
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:23,360
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, the second gate,

3
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:28,680
the PTR post office, and Mike could not hold in laughter

4
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,340
for very long because something has happened.

5
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,080
Look, this is gonna start with an energy

6
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:35,700
and you're gonna understand why.

7
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:40,400
Basically, I took this innocuous post office situation

8
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:45,000
as an excuse to drop a bombshell on Mike and Jason.

9
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:48,360
And the whole idea here was for the surprise

10
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:51,900
of the bombshell being dropped to be what was compelling

11
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:53,660
about what has just occurred.

12
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:55,200
And Mike, then what happened?

13
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,240
So what happened was there was this big revelation

14
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,940
that happened and Jason and I were like,

15
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:02,560
we were called into the principal's office for this.

16
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,300
This was a big major thing that involves

17
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:05,780
a big piece of PTR lore.

18
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:07,700
We were dissecting it already,

19
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,440
we were trying to like defend ourselves.

20
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:12,480
And I looked down and the Zoom recorder

21
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:15,340
that we used to record the podcast was not recording,

22
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,500
which felt like I maybe did it on purpose or I willed it.

23
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,560
I didn't wanna hear our embarrassment live.

24
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:24,100
So like I, using like telekinesis,

25
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:26,060
turned the Zoom recorder off.

26
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:29,020
And then I'm already getting, you know,

27
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,760
I'm already being told that something I've done is wrong.

28
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,900
And I looked down and I have to say,

29
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:38,500
teacher, excuse me, apparently I wasn't recording the podcast.

30
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:39,780
And I go, oh God.

31
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:40,740
Very interesting.

32
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,380
In one year, you're being called a task.

33
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,840
Exactly, but how would I have done it?

34
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,520
I didn't just like put my toe on it.

35
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:50,940
So this basically by sheer serendipity,

36
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:52,520
that part wasn't recorded.

37
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,900
So we don't hear Jason and I learning for the first time

38
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,640
that a thing we did was wrong.

39
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:58,740
Wow, wow.

40
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:01,440
So we're just gonna have to recreate the moment.

41
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:03,600
And the only thing that maybe improves it

42
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,220
is that now I'm coming in with even more mage than before.

43
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,400
Where I drop all of this and then there's this,

44
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,640
you aren't recording.

45
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,260
And then there was this fumbling with the mic stand

46
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,220
that was like a silent film routine.

47
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:20,500
There was a part, it was tipping over.

48
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,540
It wasn't balanced.

49
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:24,460
And then a part where your mic went limp.

50
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,700
It flopped over and made a sound like, pew.

51
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,340
It was like a visual metaphor for a limp dick occurred.

52
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,280
It is, yes.

53
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,500
It's been an insane last couple minutes.

54
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,960
Yeah, well, but I am gonna say,

55
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:43,240
I am gonna have my guard up from now on

56
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,700
if we ever do an episode where it's like,

57
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,060
maybe it's not the most exciting E-ticket.

58
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,240
Cause Scott has got me like twice now.

59
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:52,460
You mean because of the Minotaur.

60
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,420
We gotta do the Today Show Cafe.

61
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,040
We gotta do the PTR Pro.

62
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:56,980
I was like, you know what I think is supposed to happen?

63
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,040
You know what I think is Today Show would be good.

64
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,660
And then I've got these little secrets.

65
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,900
And I'm just like, hey, sounds good, my man.

66
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:06,160
Other stuff I'm dealing with right now.

67
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,320
So that sounds easy breezy for me.

68
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:09,900
We call that.

69
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,260
We did, yeah, that was good.

70
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,440
That was one of the things that I wish we had earlier

71
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,880
when you were like, oh no, I'm sick.

72
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,180
I can't hear this, Scott.

73
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:19,160
And you started pretending to cough.

74
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,500
So that's gone.

75
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:21,460
We missed that.

76
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,400
Ironic, cause I just came from an ophthalmologist appointment.

77
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,340
They're like, hey, Vizent's, yeah,

78
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,120
your heart is totally healthy, perfectly fine.

79
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:28,560
Scott's got great eyes.

80
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,320
Three and six months.

81
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,140
Well, there you go.

82
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,060
Well, then everything's fine then, isn't it?

83
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:34,560
So this is a perfect scenario in which to now,

84
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:37,320
for the second time, drop a bomb

85
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,960
and the surprise will be gone,

86
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:42,160
but it'll still be a surprise to the listener.

87
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:45,940
Leave a gap for them to gasp as I'm sure that they will.

88
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,700
What I said the first time around

89
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:53,420
is that we've been culling from the Patreon comments,

90
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:55,540
but we also have an email address.

91
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:56,680
MikeHastthewrightatgmail.

92
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,200
com.

93
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:59,320
And we haven't mentioned this maybe in a while,

94
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,420
but people know it exists.

95
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,760
And now I'm thinking this is a great place

96
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:06,460
for long form content corrections,

97
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,700
being dragged through the coals or whatever that phrase is.

98
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:11,660
Dragged over the coals, I believe.

99
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:12,680
Dragged over the coals.

100
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,180
Raked, yes.

101
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:18,760
Get ready for an auditory rake.

102
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,760
That is what's coming.

103
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:22,520
And this probably is not the tone

104
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:25,320
that was intended by the person who sent it,

105
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,440
Graham Southwood.

106
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:32,500
However, he did give his email a headline,

107
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:34,740
a subject line that could not be ignored.

108
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:35,940
This was some click bait

109
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:38,640
because I could not help but dive in on this

110
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,620
because this was the subject line.

111
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,560
Major error in Clooney briefcase story.

112
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,420
Major error in Clooney briefcase story.

113
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:50,160
And I dive in, I wonder,

114
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,500
is this guy grasping for straws?

115
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,500
What is this gonna be?

116
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,600
But I have to say,

117
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,060
I believe every word of what I'm about to read.

118
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,720
Quote to Graham.

119
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:03,920
Hello, my wife and I are huge fans of the show

120
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,240
and love listening every week.

121
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,500
I am also one of the likely few people

122
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,500
who knew the infamous briefcase story

123
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,140
before hearing it on the podcast.

124
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,580
I had read the initial article,

125
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,560
so thought it was quite funny

126
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,940
it was being brought up on PTR.

127
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:17,960
However, you have one major error

128
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,460
when telling the story on the podcast.

129
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,500
The actual Clooney briefcase story

130
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:27,360
is not that he gave the $1 million briefcases

131
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,100
with the proceeds from selling Casamigos,

132
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,460
but rather with the payday from Gravity,

133
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,380
the 2013 feature film Gravity.

134
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:38,420
This does track, says Graham,

135
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:41,920
because why would he give Randy Gerber $1 million

136
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,040
when he also made the insane bank

137
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,200
on the Casamigos sale?

138
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:48,560
Good point, Graham.

139
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:51,500
He also says, thanks for all the entertainment.

140
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,220
Another good point, Graham.

141
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,680
Signed Graham.

142
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:57,800
Well, it's a good sign that Graham was still listening

143
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,840
after this error had been made.

144
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:00,580
I'll say that.

145
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,480
That he's not resigning as a listener,

146
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:04,860
which I would not blame anyone for doing.

147
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:08,100
No, if they wanna just throw their phones

148
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,680
out their car windows in disgust, I would understand.

149
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:12,560
But he hasn't, that's good.

150
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,400
That's a good sign, at least.

151
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,760
That makes me feel okay.

152
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:15,560
Yes, yes.

153
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:20,060
And at first I wondered, like, who is this Graham?

154
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:23,040
Who is this Graham to come at the world's foremost

155
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,640
Randy Gerber experts, Mike and Jason?

156
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,320
You hired a private investigator

157
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,200
who followed Graham around for a few weeks

158
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,120
to make sure he was somebody who could,

159
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:32,760
who was on the level, who would actually check.

160
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,960
The story checks out, seems like a good guy.

161
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:37,300
We have a guy on retainer, like most podcasts.

162
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,260
Oh, you have to.

163
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:40,660
He is a total dirtbag.

164
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:43,540
He is, his life is constantly falling apart.

165
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,820
So we're like, okay, that's a good private eye.

166
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,240
Yes, yeah, yeah, no, we ran,

167
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:50,100
we had a different private eye run a check on him

168
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,840
to make sure that he was a mess,

169
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:53,360
because that would be the best guy,

170
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:55,020
would be our private eye.

171
00:06:56,020 --> 00:07:00,480
Anyway, I did do my due diligence on what Graham has dropped,

172
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:03,740
and I have to say, I think that this is completely accurate.

173
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,400
And at this point, I repeat some of what I said

174
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,260
the last time we recorded it.

175
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,080
And it's still recording, I'm looking at it.

176
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:10,840
I'm looking at it.

177
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:11,560
It better be.

178
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,960
We're four years deep into the presence

179
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,120
of this story on our podcast.

180
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:20,780
We have been haunted by this tale for four years now

181
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:23,320
for a full presidential administration.

182
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:23,620
That's right.

183
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:26,760
And this entire time, there has been a glaring error.

184
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,460
Now, Mike, in the previous recording,

185
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,380
you tried to shift blame from yourself

186
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:33,000
and put it squarely on Jason.

187
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:36,040
However, I have a feeling Graham sent this email

188
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,900
because we just told the story again,

189
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:42,480
thanks to Griffin in the Orlando live show

190
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,920
that came out not long ago.

191
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:48,700
And in that one, Mike, you are the person who repeats

192
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,440
what we have now found to be a falsehood.

193
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,740
That's true, and I've certainly been spreading the lie,

194
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:55,280
but there's no doubt in my mind

195
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,060
that I learned a lie from Jason.

196
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:00,920
Jason is the one who lied first accidentally.

197
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:04,220
Because as we've talked about on the show before,

198
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:07,820
I was just very interested in Randy Gerber the man,

199
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,200
not the story necessarily.

200
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:11,600
Jason is the one who brought the story element

201
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:15,360
into the podcast, and then I adopted the story

202
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,720
as my own story as well after that.

203
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,700
Loved it like a son.

204
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,880
To bond with Jason also too,

205
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,240
just because we're good friends

206
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,000
and we were sort of bonding over the story.

207
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,760
We both met sort of in the middle,

208
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,500
like a friendship necklace or the heart necklace

209
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,520
that bonds together.

210
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,640
I knew this about Randy and Kaia Gerber.

211
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,040
So your little hearts that came together,

212
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,060
that's how this feels.

213
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:34,680
That's right, yeah.

214
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,240
And then Jason had the briefcase story

215
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,220
because it's the biggest fantasy of his life

216
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:40,740
that a friend of his just gives him a million dollars for free.

217
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,100
This is what he's been hoping.

218
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:43,140
Taxes paid, baby.

219
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:44,500
This is what he's been.

220
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,380
I do think if this happened to Jason,

221
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:49,040
if you were one of the 14, you would be excited

222
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,960
and then you'd say like, taxes no.

223
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:55,560
I'm assuming someone was like, oh fuck,

224
00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:00,060
like 100,000 gone, 200,000 gone.

225
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:03,100
So I certainly retold the wrong story

226
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,580
a couple of weeks ago in Orlando,

227
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:07,280
but the origin of the wrong story

228
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,300
is this man sitting next to me on the left.

229
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:12,340
I chalk it up to being a apocryphal

230
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:14,960
or conventional wisdom, whatever you call it.

231
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,140
Like most stories recapped on podcasts.

232
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:19,920
What does that mean?

233
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,620
What do you mean it's apocryphal?

234
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:24,240
I was kind of like, oh, I heard it somewhere

235
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,560
and it was kind of an anecdote

236
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,780
and then I kind of like, I remembered it.

237
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:28,760
That's a good point.

238
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,640
I read the People Magazine article about it

239
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,700
where they talk about walking up the driveway

240
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:34,420
or something.

241
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,180
This is a very good point.

242
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:39,080
I'll come back to you, Mike, but that's a good point

243
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,660
because the first you brought it up,

244
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,980
it is not as if this was some researched situation.

245
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:47,480
You were just dying to tell the story to Nick Mundy

246
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:51,080
who then unplugged our microphones and left the apartment.

247
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,120
That was the first way this played out.

248
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,720
And then it was told again,

249
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:56,780
because it had to come out of your brain.

250
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:00,880
However, where I begin to take umbrage with both of you

251
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,580
is, okay, that's all 2019, cut to 2020,

252
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,720
the one time I'm not here for an episode.

253
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:10,760
And you guys spring a surprise one called

254
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,740
Casamigos Tequila in which there is preparation,

255
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,880
in which articles have been read and studied.

256
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:20,760
I've already had to provide one rebuttal for this episode

257
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:23,200
and now I find myself doing a second.

258
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:26,420
This was the chance that the facts could have been caught

259
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:27,420
and corrected.

260
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:32,100
Well, a lot of that episode was focused on making sure

261
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:38,380
the local city bike installation did have two available

262
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:41,960
that we could sit on and get a picture at.

263
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:47,600
You can pat your belly and rub your head at the same time.

264
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:48,220
Can you not?

265
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:48,860
That's true, yeah, that's true.

266
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:50,800
You can do all of these things at once.

267
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,360
That's true, you know, and it makes,

268
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:53,880
here's what's interesting about that.

269
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:57,020
Now it would make sense that in all of the Casamigos

270
00:10:57,020 --> 00:11:00,140
articles I read, that story doesn't come up

271
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:01,960
because it has to do with gravity.

272
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,580
It has nothing to do with Casamigos.

273
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:07,040
Let me do a little bit of, now let me go into

274
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,920
what I have learned.

275
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:13,840
Okay, because I went back, I had to go back.

276
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,960
It's crazy how many times I've now had to consult

277
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,200
the episode Casamigos Tequila.

278
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:24,800
There is a part in which Jason says the date,

279
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,400
the date in which the briefcases were exchanged.

280
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,680
Oh, so he is, okay.

281
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:34,640
September 20th, Jason says September 20th, 2013.

282
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,740
Then you both go on to say this is a date

283
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:38,220
that will live in infamy.

284
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:41,500
So I go to look this up and I find that Jason

285
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:45,120
got the date wrong, but only by a week.

286
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:46,940
Only by a week, so not so bad.

287
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:47,500
That's not bad.

288
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:50,060
Not so bad, just saying while we're bringing things up.

289
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,020
That's just kind of the level of facts

290
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:53,540
that we're dealing with here.

291
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,580
September 27th, 2013.

292
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:01,340
And the dates, this is really where the smoking gun lies

293
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:06,660
because the timeline here, 2013 was when Casamigos

294
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,640
was founded, there was no money.

295
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:12,980
The two of them were in the fields rolling up their sleeves

296
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:15,780
planting the agave, harvesting the agave.

297
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:17,420
I don't know what they were doing with the agave.

298
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:18,520
At least hanging out with the guys who were doing it.

299
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,480
Yeah, pouring, getting bottles of the first batch,

300
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:25,560
pouring it into copper cups like in the commercial.

301
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:26,780
The authentic commercial.

302
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:29,440
They were busy with copper cups.

303
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:32,520
They had to pay for those cups themselves at that time.

304
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:36,140
There was no money for people to get million dollar cases.

305
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:41,540
It was not until June 2017 that liquor conglomerate

306
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:47,020
Diageo purchased Casamigos to this insane degree

307
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:48,860
of 700 million dollars.

308
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,260
So it's all been right there.

309
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:56,340
The dates, further details about this story came out

310
00:12:56,340 --> 00:13:00,340
not until 2020, until after that episode occurred,

311
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:04,460
the Your Guys episode, but all of these facts were out there.

312
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:08,180
The date of the sale and the date of the case exchange.

313
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,260
And I don't know, it was all there in front of you.

314
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:14,160
I'm wondering, that's really fascinating now

315
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,960
that you knew the date of the briefcase story,

316
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:21,000
but the details weren't, that's interesting to me, isn't it?

317
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:25,100
Well, that means whatever source I pulled that date from.

318
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,200
Well, that's what I'm wondering.

319
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,260
Did you go to a source that was wrong?

320
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:29,760
Because if you-

321
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,040
Let me say this, but I saw so many articles

322
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,460
that said September 27th, 2013.

323
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,420
That date is out there a ton.

324
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:40,520
I don't doubt that you could have pulled it

325
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:43,100
from the wrong one, but this date gets underlined

326
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,420
because it's the exact same date

327
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:46,820
that one year later he marries Amal.

328
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,580
So there is some real significance to the date.

329
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,760
So if you pulled it from an article,

330
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,640
this article was wrong on two counts.

331
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:54,260
Wow.

332
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,480
Maybe I was just amazed that they're glamour

333
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,380
and beauty together as a globetrotting couple.

334
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:00,960
Did we even say the word Amal?

335
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:02,300
Did we say the name Amal on the show?

336
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:02,980
You sure did.

337
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:03,840
It does come up.

338
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:06,420
Yes, this fact is said that one year later on that day-

339
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:07,520
We do say that.

340
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,360
Does Jason say it or do I say it?

341
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,420
Jason says it.

342
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:13,380
Okay, so you were in an article about this.

343
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,080
This is interesting to me.

344
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:17,100
I'm in Amal?

345
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:18,900
No, I'm just saying you were in an article.

346
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,240
You were reading an article.

347
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:23,480
You were reading one of the articles Scott said.

348
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:28,560
You would have to think.

349
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,000
Now the Amal timeline is important here

350
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,940
because he is not married at this point.

351
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:38,660
And when you come into a big financial windfall

352
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:41,340
and then want to start giving briefcases of money to people,

353
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:44,000
the first on your list might be your wife, right?

354
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,620
But he doesn't have a wife at this time.

355
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,600
This is why I think it's an important part of the story

356
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,900
because where he is in his life,

357
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,120
where he's still technically single,

358
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:53,140
he's not in too deep with Amal.

359
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:55,400
This puts him at a place where he's like,

360
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,120
well, I'm getting all of this gravity money,

361
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:00,940
which is, by the way, percentages of the movie,

362
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,580
because they thought, quote George,

363
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:04,040
they thought it was gonna be a flop.

364
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:06,000
And that ended up being a very good deal.

365
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:06,640
Was it like 60 million?

366
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,720
This is why he thought of his buds, his boys,

367
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:09,940
instead of his own wife.

368
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,840
Right, was it like 60 million?

369
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,660
Did it say in an article what it was?

370
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:15,380
We don't know the full extent of the gravity money.

371
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:17,220
It was like that big of a number, I think,

372
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,940
in the zone or higher or whatever.

373
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:20,560
I guess I should have looked that up

374
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,560
because I'm now dealing with money and details here.

375
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:26,500
When did he stop dating WWE diva, Stacey Keebler?

376
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,500
That's my question.

377
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:30,160
Was he out of that Keebler relationship

378
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,200
before he gave the money?

379
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:34,100
When Keebler might've been eligible for a million dollars.

380
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,460
That's what I'm wondering now too,

381
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,220
because if it's earlier than that,

382
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,480
then she probably, they probably stopped dating, I'm guessing.

383
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:44,620
But I would like to know now, just to know timeline wise.

384
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:47,220
We should just, we need to know more, I think,

385
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:48,560
at this point, just to make sure

386
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,620
we don't ever back into a wrong fact again.

387
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:53,160
Right, okay, so Clooney and Stacey Keebler

388
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:56,780
split in July 8th, 2013.

389
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:57,960
Whoa.

390
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:58,520
So.

391
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,340
This is important information then.

392
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:00,360
It is.

393
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:04,700
This shows you the dramatic nature of his life.

394
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:05,320
Yeah.

395
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:08,020
That he really is thinking about friends.

396
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,620
Friends are what are most important to him at this time.

397
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:11,340
I don't wanna say the-

398
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:13,060
In the crazy summer of 2013.

399
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:16,300
I don't wanna say the phrase, bros before.

400
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,960
Jason could say it, but I can't.

401
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,760
But that's what he's thinking.

402
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,020
That's an appropriate way to talk about people.

403
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,160
Oh, okay, excuse me.

404
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:27,860
Bros before casamigos is what you were heading for, right?

405
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:28,620
I'll say it.

406
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:29,060
Why not?

407
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:32,580
So yeah, wow, Clooney Keebler split.

408
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:33,640
That's fascinating.

409
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,700
E-news Anatomy of a Split.

410
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:36,160
Wow.

411
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:37,600
Clooney Stacey Keebler.

412
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,380
Wow, well we're doing Anatomy of a Story right now,

413
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:42,660
and Anatomy of a Split is now an important part of it.

414
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:46,100
I think what this has all shed a light on

415
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:50,220
is that other than the presence of both Clooney and Gerber,

416
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:54,280
the briefcase's story is unrelated to casamigos.

417
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:58,080
I mean, it's not, I mean, it's part of the fabric of the,

418
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:00,340
if you made a movie about it,

419
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,960
it would be in the background.

420
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:05,320
But I think that you could not willingly call this

421
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,320
the casamigos briefcase story.

422
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:07,740
No.

423
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:08,860
That's something that's out at this point.

424
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:10,120
If all this is accurate, no,

425
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:13,040
there's no casamigos relation at all,

426
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,800
other than Randy being there.

427
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:17,540
Did we say on any of these podcasts specifically

428
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:19,440
that Randy got a million dollars?

429
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:24,020
Yes, because I've heard it so many times,

430
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:27,020
an important part of it is that he had to take

431
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:29,540
the million dollars or nobody got the million dollars.

432
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:30,600
So he took it.

433
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:32,640
I thought it was everyone took it for us.

434
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,440
Everyone that had to take it, yeah.

435
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:36,300
Okay, yeah, but including him, right?

436
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:38,540
He said, I don't want the million dollars.

437
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,780
I am very wealthy from my wife

438
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:42,880
and whatever awful family I'm in.

439
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,680
He has two brothers and they all do restaurant stuff.

440
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,020
but George insists.

441
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:53,620
And then he, actually this comes up in Graham's email

442
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:56,480
that he says, that he, all right,

443
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,580
if Randy doesn't take it, nobody gets it.

444
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,940
Randy made a point to say he donated it all to charity.

445
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:03,600
And who am I to question the legendary Randy Gerber?

446
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,680
My wife says he came off pretty well

447
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,980
in the super dot model documentary with Cindy Crawford,

448
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,680
but I would be interested to see

449
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,300
that tax return for the year.

450
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,980
We'll get working on that, Graham.

451
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,140
We'll dive into Gerber's taxes.

452
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,440
I have pictures of casamigos being served

453
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,700
at Kate Bosworth's birthday, Paris Hilton's birthday,

454
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:23,700
with Vin Diesel in the Bloodshot premiere.

455
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:25,700
Does that have anything to do with the article

456
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:26,380
that you were looking for?

457
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:27,640
My notes from 2020.

458
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,380
You pulled up your notes from the episode.

459
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:30,120
Wait a minute.

460
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:32,220
So in the notes, do you have the date?

461
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,080
What does it say?

462
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,780
There's actually no dates in these notes.

463
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,460
Where would you have found the date then?

464
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:40,800
Oh no, the only date specifically mentioned

465
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:45,320
is that casamigos was bought by Diageo

466
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:48,180
for $700 million in 2017.

467
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,580
2017, it was right there.

468
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:51,860
It was in your notes.

469
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:54,600
This has been in front of us at all times.

470
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,800
Is it an important part of the story?

471
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:59,900
I don't know, but I think it's important to bring up

472
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:02,420
because this story is clearly gonna be a presence

473
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:04,680
on this podcast and in our lives

474
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,840
until the podcast or we die.

475
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,760
I think this is great because you're right.

476
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:12,760
This podcast story will be told again.

477
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,480
Again and again and again.

478
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:18,040
Whoa, I forgot Omega Watches collaborated

479
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:20,400
with Casamigos for an exclusive

480
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,620
Seamaster Planet Ocean Watch.

481
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:27,540
Because it will be good to tell the story now.

482
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:30,780
It'll feel good to tell it, I think, going forward.

483
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:32,360
You can tell it guilt free.

484
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,300
It won't be resting on a lie.

485
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:38,220
Because now we know where the character of George was at,

486
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,720
thinking about his friends, his heart,

487
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,100
and tatters on the ground.

488
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,740
I think it improves the story.

489
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,320
It ups the stakes in the drama.

490
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,180
Yes, it does.

491
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:50,680
I think that, okay, now it's the gravity story, I suppose.

492
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,480
It is unrelated to Casamigos.

493
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,700
Well, I think you could still call it, you know,

494
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,100
you could just put Clooney first and foremost in it.

495
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,800
I'll say this though.

496
00:19:58,960 --> 00:19:59,720
Here's William H.

497
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:01,280
Macy and Felicity Huffman

498
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,540
toasting Casamigos.

499
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,780
I was like, aha, we got her into college.

500
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,440
Here's what I'll say though.

501
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,180
I love it, but my anxiousness to do this,

502
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:12,400
to rake you guys over the coals has now led to,

503
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:15,440
now I'm the nightmare of getting bonus content

504
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,780
from an episode I had to be, from four years ago,

505
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:19,340
I had to do a rebuttal for already.

506
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:23,020
September 2020, mentally healthy, all of us at that point.

507
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:24,700
Here's what I'll say about this though.

508
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,360
The way the story has been told,

509
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:30,500
yes, some of the facts may be inaccurate,

510
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:33,900
but the spirit of the story remains the same.

511
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,900
A generous man wanting to reward his buds

512
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:40,700
with some free cash, a generous spirit of George Clooney,

513
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,240
and sort of the terms of the deal.

514
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:47,960
All of that is still intact, which is why I'm happy about that

515
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:50,320
because if you were like, actually what happened was,

516
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,780
it was the money from Gravity,

517
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,420
and also he didn't give them money,

518
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:54,980
everybody opened up the briefcase

519
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:57,220
and they got shot in the face like the slime,

520
00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:01,400
the Katy Perry gif of Katy Perry at the Nick Awards,

521
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:03,580
and she gets hit in the face with slime really hard.

522
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,740
If that was the story, then I would really feel bad.

523
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,760
He wouldn't be a very good friend then at all,

524
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:09,140
would he be?

525
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:09,500
Right.

526
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:12,000
Well, but just Richard Kine got the slime.

527
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,400
He got the million dollars for his free case.

528
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,620
That was in the cut part.

529
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:17,880
We talked about Richard Kine being one of the guys.

530
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,080
Can I ask a quick question?

531
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,180
This is a little bit of a side note, Jason.

532
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:22,660
Of all the people you met when we met in 2009

533
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:25,100
or whatever at UCB, was there anyone you pegged

534
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:28,640
for your million dollar sugar daddy of all the friends?

535
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:30,700
I mean, clearly you.

536
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:34,640
We've been banging the Trump for so long, old boy.

537
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:35,840
We're trying still.

538
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,060
You're still hoping maybe.

539
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:38,260
Still hoping, yeah.

540
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:42,660
That one day that Mike scores a big payday

541
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:44,380
and that like- A Gravity size.

542
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:46,140
Hopefully it's gravity sized.

543
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:51,420
It's big enough that it can initially go to

544
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:55,700
Mike's wife and child if he's like not wanting

545
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:56,940
to look out for his buds.

546
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:59,220
Maybe his parents or sister get something.

547
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,320
But if Mike's got his priorities right,

548
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,280
then a million goes straight into Jason's coffers.

549
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,920
Yeah, so I think what, yeah, in that scenario,

550
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:09,640
it's just I have a big kitchen table

551
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:13,220
and it's only you at the table and you're at the other end.

552
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:15,420
And then you open up the briefcase and I go,

553
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:16,680
here it is, million dollars.

554
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,800
And you go, taxes?

555
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:18,680
Taxes?

556
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:20,940
And then I go, yep, taxes too.

557
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:25,860
Of course, I did it for you only, not for my daughter.

558
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,440
Yeah, you had to pay the taxes.

559
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:30,920
I'm still above her in the will, right?

560
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,240
You forgot to revise that?

561
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:37,320
to the Patreon just for Jason.

562
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:41,300
If anyone is ultra wealthy and they want to give Jason

563
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:44,460
a million dollars tax free, you can subscribe.

564
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:45,740
We could add it.

565
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:48,540
It's five, it's eight, and it's one million.

566
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:48,760
Yeah.

567
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:50,400
And also the taxes.

568
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,960
It has to be the taxes.

569
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:53,480
Yeah, it's gotta be.

570
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:55,140
Cause that's gonna haunt ya.

571
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,200
Cause yeah, there's a lot of taxes.

572
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,580
A lot of taxes for a million bucks.

573
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,160
Mike, you're right.

574
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,560
That the story, the spirit of the story

575
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,900
has always been told.

576
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:07,280
However, there's a slippery slope here, right?

577
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:09,580
Because what we've found, there's all of these stories

578
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:11,920
that have attached themselves like barnacles

579
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,920
to the whole of this podcast.

580
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:16,820
One of them being, I think we've questioned

581
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:18,840
some inaccuracies maybe in the famous

582
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,580
hemisphere dancer story.

583
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:22,440
We're gonna get into that at some point.

584
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,840
And then of course, the real predecessor

585
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,960
to what we're doing right now, Frank Marshall Gate,

586
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:29,420
where you made a very similar argument,

587
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:32,740
which is well, the spirit, because Frank's spirit was there.

588
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,640
Even though he did not speak,

589
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:37,100
and the main thing was you yelling at us

590
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:38,460
cause we didn't remember the speech.

591
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:43,600
So that, this spirit thing, I think it does apply

592
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,760
with Clooney, but if we start hiding

593
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:48,120
in that spirit argument, we're never gonna get out of there.

594
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,460
Then anyway, so it is allowed.

595
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,620
Sort of joie de vivre, you can only get through

596
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:54,320
the magic of podcasting.

597
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:56,840
How much mass media do you get this?

598
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,460
Podcasting, if what you're saying,

599
00:23:58,580 --> 00:23:59,840
and I don't know what you're saying,

600
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:00,740
but if what you're saying.

601
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:01,360
Me neither, brother.

602
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,740
Now you might understand it now.

603
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
If what you're saying.

604
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,460
That's sort of, I don't know what, you know?

605
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:08,220
But I'm gonna guess, I'm gonna take a guess here.

606
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:09,800
If what you're saying is that podcasts

607
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:12,840
are more about vibes than facts, then I'm with you.

608
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,980
I hear what you're saying, and I agree.

609
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:15,980
You know, it doesn't necessarily,

610
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:19,260
it's just the feeling, the spirit of Frank being there

611
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:20,980
at the opening of Jurassic World

612
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:22,920
is what I was riding high on,

613
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:24,600
and I was excitedly trying to say,

614
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:26,340
don't you remember, Frank was there.

615
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:26,920
Yeah.

616
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,020
Words he said, okay, yes, I got that part wrong,

617
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,960
but we were in his presence, we were breathing his air.

618
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:35,560
I just think, and now we're arguing this again,

619
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,900
it would certainly help me to have remembered

620
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,260
him being there at all.

621
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,860
One thing that might stand out in my memory

622
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:44,480
is if he said two words on a microphone.

623
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:47,100
He didn't, but his aura was strong.

624
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:48,900
That's the thing that I'm saying here.

625
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:49,420
I've already been through that

626
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:50,840
we didn't even have eyes on it.

627
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,680
We were blocked, we couldn't even see this.

628
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:55,080
I had eyes on it, but maybe it's because I'm six-three.

629
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,200
Yeah, I know, but you're tall, I'm a six-three guy.

630
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:59,780
I can't find one way that you being tall

631
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:01,700
gets you out of this situation right now.

632
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,820
It doesn't, and I have to apologize to the audience,

633
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:06,300
and I'll apologize to the audience for one other thing too,

634
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:10,300
because I am a man who does things like this, apologize.

635
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,480
That is, I believe I called Michael Meldman

636
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,700
the silent partner in costume.

637
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:17,340
He goes, Michael Melman on the live show in Florida.

638
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:19,200
So I apologize for that.

639
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:21,560
His name is Michael Meldman, there's a D in there,

640
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:24,940
and I said Melman, and I remember listening back to him

641
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:27,620
going, I think that's wrong, and yes, it is wrong,

642
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:29,060
so I apologize to the listeners.

643
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:31,800
People who've been hanging on that for that as well.

644
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,760
I need to do, you know, we all need to hold ourselves

645
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:35,820
to a higher standard.

646
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:39,780
I tried to get ahead of this, I've addressed this online,

647
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:41,060
but I haven't done it on the show.

648
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:45,200
I have thrown out what I've realized is false,

649
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,920
that the revolving restaurant at the Lampadillion

650
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,840
stopped revolving at some point.

651
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:52,920
I don't know where that entered my head.

652
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,900
That is a fair thing for listeners to say.

653
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,060
I think I've said it to somebody,

654
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:57,860
and it's because of you in the same way

655
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:59,380
that Jason poisoned my brain,

656
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,360
you poisoned my brain about the revolving restaurant.

657
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,140
You're right, I'm also a man.

658
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,780
I will withstand the points that you're doing right now,

659
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:07,360
and you're right.

660
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:09,420
That was saying a falsehood.

661
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,700
I don't know if I can pin it on that maybe I was there

662
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:14,620
once when it was not revolving

663
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:15,700
for an extended period of time,

664
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:19,300
but I've definitely, unfairly, put that into a pile

665
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:21,700
of things that are cruddy about that pavilion,

666
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:26,720
and I've caused that to reflect poorly on this ride,

667
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:28,400
and I have to take that out of the argument.

668
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:29,480
That's not fair.

669
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:32,360
I'm not being fair to the ride, and I'll admit it.

670
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:33,440
That, thank you.

671
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:35,140
That does make it, thank you for the audience.

672
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:35,860
I don't need the thing.

673
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:36,860
I don't need the apology.

674
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,660
It's not for me, it's for the audience.

675
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,420
I'm too, I don't need it.

676
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:44,180
And I thank the audience for not being that mean about it.

677
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,900
There's a way to do these things.

678
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:46,740
That's not what I'm doing.

679
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:49,780
I'm being quite mean to you, but.

680
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:50,580
That's okay.

681
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:52,000
I'm comfortable with it.

682
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:52,600
I'm a man.

683
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,800
And I just want the audience to know

684
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,940
that the Wall Street Journal once described

685
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:58,700
Michael Melman as real.

686
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:02,340
Yeah, Jason, Melman, he just said it.

687
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:03,400
Melman.

688
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:06,720
They called him real estate's party boy.

689
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:08,140
Yeah, yeah, I remember that.

690
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:08,720
Take that as you will.

691
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:10,160
You said that in the episode.

692
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,420
You said that in the episode, yeah.

693
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:12,380
We're just repeating ourselves.

694
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,320
I know, but it was so long ago, it's a good refresher.

695
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,580
But Michael only said Melman,

696
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:21,000
and did a whole thing about it less than five minutes ago.

697
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,020
He was busy reading his poem.

698
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:22,740
He had his head in his notes.

699
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:25,220
I was just thinking about partying with Melman.

700
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:27,160
I got too excited, I don't know.

701
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:29,580
I've told the Melman story that a friend of ours

702
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:30,680
on the show, but we don't have time for it.

703
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,900
That was told on the other one.

704
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,000
It was told on the other one.

705
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,840
We don't need to tell that one again.

706
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,640
We don't need to tell that one again.

707
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,860
Okay, you know why we don't need to tell it?

708
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:41,440
Because I'm not done.

709
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:42,900
I'm not done here at all.

710
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:45,360
And if you guys still think this is a mailbag episode,

711
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:46,980
you've got another thing coming.

712
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:47,620
Okay, okay.

713
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:49,380
Because here's what I started thinking.

714
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:50,640
Are we gonna use those questions eventually?

715
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:51,660
Oh yeah, so we will.

716
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,200
We will.

717
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:52,540
Great.

718
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:54,480
I'm sorry you were part of a ruse,

719
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:55,820
but we will get to the questions.

720
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:56,720
That's fine, I can handle it.

721
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:59,660
Okay, I started thinking.

722
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:03,600
If the source of the money in the story was false,

723
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:06,500
what else about this tale might be false?

724
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:08,820
Now how would we describe the story?

725
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:11,320
What is like the, if you had to sum up the story

726
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:13,600
with a title, what's the title of the story?

727
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:17,660
When you, the other day, when we finished recording,

728
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:20,640
we're like, oh, I don't wanna be a little greedy.

729
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:22,100
Can we get one more recording?

730
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,520
And did you already have this in mind?

731
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,460
Of course he did.

732
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:25,660
That was a little show.

733
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:27,160
What do you think?

734
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:27,980
I guess.

735
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:28,960
What do you think, Jason?

736
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:31,700
I mean, I do wanna talk about that parade.

737
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:32,920
It seems fun.

738
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,020
We're gonna get to that.

739
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,220
We cannot move forward on anything.

740
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:37,680
Some great questions too.

741
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,800
Any future plans.

742
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,440
I guess I was gonna do the questions.

743
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,620
We'll be doing the questions.

744
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,320
I guess you would say like, is the briefcase story,

745
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:45,440
were there no briefcases?

746
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,340
Is that what you're about to reveal here?

747
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:50,080
Well, for the answer to that one,

748
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:53,400
we turn to something that in all of the discussion of this

749
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,420
has never actually been consulted.

750
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:59,920
That is the video clip in which this story was first told

751
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:05,060
on a MSNBC show from 2017 called Headliners.

752
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,920
This presumably was an episode about George Clooney.

753
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,200
They get into the generosity of George Clooney

754
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,380
and they talk to Randy Gerber.

755
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:15,460
And I believe for the first time now ever on the show,

756
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:18,940
we're gonna actually hear the voice of Randy Gerber.

757
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:19,780
Oh my God.

758
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:21,180
It's like hearing God speak.

759
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,700
I'm hearing it too emotional for me.

760
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:25,700
Sitting in front of each of us on the table

761
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:27,880
is a black like to me bag.

762
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:28,940
It's a to me bag.

763
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:29,540
You know, luggage.

764
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:32,560
You know, luggage.

765
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:33,800
Luggage.

766
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:37,100
Guys, this has never, shut up.

767
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:41,660
This has never been a briefcase story this entire time.

768
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,580
It is a suitcase story.

769
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:49,160
Even the title of the story has always been wrong.

770
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:49,660
Wow.

771
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:52,520
It's a suitcase full of money.

772
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:53,720
It is a suitcase.

773
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:56,960
Now I did some double checking on this as well.

774
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,940
And okay, to me does make briefcases.

775
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:01,160
This is a high end bag.

776
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:01,580
And you know what?

777
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:04,500
This actually adds to the generosity of Clooney

778
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,840
that in addition, people are getting these nice bags.

779
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:08,720
So I was like, let me give some benefit of the doubt.

780
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:10,440
They do make briefcases.

781
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:11,480
That is true.

782
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:15,460
However, several times, Gerber keeps talking

783
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:17,680
and he quotes George in that moment and he says,

784
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:21,160
so I want you all to open your suitcases.

785
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,980
And also an important part of the story

786
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:25,420
that hasn't been discussed yet either.

787
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:27,460
The denominations.

788
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:31,300
The million dollars was given out in 20s.

789
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:33,020
This is from Gerber himself.

790
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:36,280
20 dollar bills, not 100 dollar bills.

791
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:37,420
Did we say hundreds?

792
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,120
I don't think this has ever come up.

793
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:41,100
I don't think this is, this is not a correction.

794
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:43,640
I mean, that's the most considerate denomination

795
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:44,660
I feel like.

796
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:45,680
20s or 100s?

797
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:46,800
20s, they're convenient.

798
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,240
You can use them kind of anywhere.

799
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,320
Well, they're convenient.

800
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:51,660
You're right in one way that like then you've,

801
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:54,080
yeah, they don't have to get checked like a hundred.

802
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,940
But then it's, it is odd that now people have to carry out

803
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:01,020
of this affair what I've now determined

804
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:03,140
are quite sizable bags.

805
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,520
Well, you gotta fill the bag.

806
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:05,600
If you use hundreds bags,

807
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:06,820
it's not gonna be filled all the way.

808
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,740
It's not gonna make a good presentation.

809
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:11,300
This makes a lot of sense because it reminds me now

810
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:13,560
of the bags they carry out in Ocean's Eleven

811
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:15,500
when they're looting the vault.

812
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:18,340
So there's the big like black sort of like duffel bag

813
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:19,040
kind of things.

814
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:21,540
So maybe he got the idea from his own film.

815
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:23,840
So it's possible he got the same bag.

816
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:26,180
I don't know if they're Loomy bags in Ocean's Eleven.

817
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:26,980
To me.

818
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:27,460
To me.

819
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:27,600
To me.

820
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:28,340
Loomy.

821
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,220
Let's fix those future corrections.

822
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:31,560
Meldman, to me.

823
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:32,820
Meldman and to me.

824
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:34,320
You don't even have to, you're like me.

825
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,080
You're more of a travel pro man.

826
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,920
You're not paying the extra for it.

827
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:38,840
What's travel pro?

828
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:41,200
Oh, travel pro is a great luggage company

829
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,200
that a lot of flight attendants use,

830
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,900
but they're very good warranties.

831
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:46,380
And they hold up.

832
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:46,860
They take a real…

833
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:47,760
Do you have some?

834
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:48,820
I got a few, yeah.

835
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:49,700
Wow, okay.

836
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,700
That's who makes the actual luggage you're saying?

837
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:53,860
Yeah, it's a very simple flight attendant

838
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:57,280
pulling a roller bag or a duffel bag.

839
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:58,960
It's got a little Eiffel Tower on it.

840
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,100
That's a travel pro.

841
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:00,740
Okay.

842
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:01,460
Wow.

843
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,040
When you give the money to Jason in the future,

844
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:07,240
put it in a travel pro.

845
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:10,560
Put it on travel pro and make sure to register the warranty

846
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,560
or I'll do it.

847
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:13,500
I think you can register the warranty, can't you?

848
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:14,280
Oh, I just forget.

849
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:15,960
Taxes?

850
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:16,600
Did you?

851
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,620
And one more thing, did you register the warranty?

852
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,960
You do the taxes, I'll do the warranty.

853
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:23,180
Here's what I…

854
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:26,300
In order to make sure that I knew for sure

855
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:27,960
that these were not to me, briefcases,

856
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:30,080
which they did make, I did some math.

857
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:31,760
The money came in 20s.

858
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,200
Now we know that, which does add

859
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,720
to the impressiveness of the display.

860
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:35,380
That's a lot.

861
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,780
A $20 bill weighs one gram.

862
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:42,120
A $1 million divided by 20 is 50,000.

863
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:44,160
So that's how many bills we're dealing with here.

864
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:47,800
Each at one gram, so that's 50,000 grams.

865
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:49,240
You convert that to pounds,

866
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:52,360
we're dealing with 110 pounds worth of cash.

867
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:53,300
Wow, yeah.

868
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:54,720
So this is massive.

869
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,540
No briefcase in the world is gonna be able to hold

870
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:59,180
110 pounds worth of cash.

871
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,720
Thus, this is a suitcase story.

872
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:03,280
It's a giant suitcase,

873
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:05,280
or is it a regular suitcase, do we think?

874
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:08,120
Well, I mean, I don't think there's anything regular

875
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:08,960
about Toomey.

876
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:11,740
I think that's a pretty sturdy suitcase.

877
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:14,180
High quality, the highest you're gonna find on the market.

878
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:15,320
I live in travel pro.

879
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,740
where it's like, well, now you gotta carry it out of here,

880
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:24,660
my guys.

881
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:25,580
Because of 100 pounds?

882
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:26,680
100 pounds, yeah.

883
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:27,180
Yeah, now they've got some-

884
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:28,280
That's got wheels, doesn't it?

885
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,360
This is what I'm thinking.

886
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:30,960
I don't know the type of bag.

887
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:32,860
This is against something else that we can look into.

888
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:35,340
I can only imagine that these are rolling suitcases,

889
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:38,420
and they had to be in order to make it comfortable

890
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:38,760
for everyone involved.

891
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,080
Even getting them off the table would be hard.

892
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,840
I mean, like, Randy can carry this.

893
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:44,340
He can carry it, obviously he's a good shape guy.

894
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:44,980
Yeah, he's jay.

895
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:46,040
You seen him on that bike?

896
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:46,480
Yeah.

897
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:49,100
He's jacked, and he can, he's, you know.

898
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,280
But everybody else-

899
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:52,340
We don't know what Waldo Sanchez looks like.

900
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,400
We don't know what he can bench.

901
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,940
Did Richard Kind have trouble?

902
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:56,280
Did he struggle with the 100?

903
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:57,960
I don't know, because it seemed to be awkward,

904
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,880
like size and weight, I don't know.

905
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:00,280
Yeah, possibly.

906
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:02,420
I don't wanna put it down, maybe he was fine.

907
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:02,980
I don't know.

908
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:03,520
Maybe he did it okay.

909
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,140
You've brought up another thing,

910
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:07,320
and I'm sorry I've downplayed it,

911
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,920
because I had an order in my head

912
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:09,740
for how to do these things.

913
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:12,380
Another thing, in all this time,

914
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:14,940
and I don't know if this came up in the 2020 episode,

915
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:18,900
the whole time Richard Kind was one of them?

916
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:22,480
This has been a, I certainly did not know this one.

917
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,220
Did you, Mike?

918
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:25,640
I assumed, I was assuming it,

919
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:27,300
because I know about all the good times

920
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:28,880
they had back in the old days,

921
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,180
when they were struggling actors.

922
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:31,980
And Richard Kind was with Clooney,

923
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:34,100
I believe, at the Sphere, recently.

924
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,120
So like, they're still buddies.

925
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:36,820
Okay.

926
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:38,780
So I think I was just assuming it,

927
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:40,800
but I don't know that we've ever said it out loud.

928
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:43,120
It doesn't feel familiar to me.

929
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:43,440
Yeah.

930
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:45,500
And this is another thing that I'm hung up on,

931
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:48,440
because in the effort to make this story interesting,

932
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:50,460
that's been the main premise.

933
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:51,020
You're saying that would have been a big thing.

934
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:54,960
George Clooney gave a million dollars in a suitcase

935
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:58,240
to Richard Kind, and 13 other people?

936
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:00,240
Oh, I'm interested.

937
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:02,400
Richard Kind is a beloved character actor, you're right.

938
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,760
I don't know, it would be interesting to see

939
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:07,420
if we had ever brought that part of it up.

940
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:09,280
But maybe, yeah, maybe, I don't think,

941
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:12,140
how many times have I told the story on this?

942
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,040
Do we know how many times I've told it,

943
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,300
versus how many times Jason's told it?

944
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:17,360
I don't know, I think it's, I mean, in the live show,

945
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:19,780
it was kind of like a, it was a double up.

946
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,200
You kind of tag teamed it.

947
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:21,600
Right, right.

948
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:23,300
That's sort of always how it's been, I'd say.

949
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:26,020
I would love to hear if the story changed at all

950
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:28,540
from story one to Orlando.

951
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,860
Did we add anything fake to it

952
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:33,120
in the same way that a game of Telephone?

953
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:37,480
You think this could be like a Mighty Akron sort of thing?

954
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:40,080
Well, Mighty Akron is just a way to describe

955
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:42,740
a beautiful creature that I came up with, I created.

956
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:44,020
That's true, but now it's in the lexicon.

957
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:46,220
This is more of just what you were talking about,

958
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:48,900
Joie de Vivre or something of a podcast

959
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:51,380
where something changes over the course.

960
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:55,640
The je ne sais quoi, maybe that's the term, je ne sais quoi.

961
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,880
Something special, I believe, is the je ne sais quoi.

962
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,680
Joy of living, you know.

963
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:02,840
I still, I think what you're trying to say

964
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:08,980
is that the podcast has a certain Moulin Rouge, if you will.

965
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:14,080
And stuff gets fanciful when you're talking on microphones.

966
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,180
You say things, you go on flights of fancy

967
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:19,080
and you maybe exaggerate or you misremember

968
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:23,060
and then all of a sudden a big black suitcase

969
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:25,880
made by Toomey is no longer that.

970
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:32,060
It's morphed now into a briefcase full of $100 bills.

971
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:34,060
And Richard Kind is nowhere to be found.

972
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,400
This I think has been the biggest thing neglected

973
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:39,920
the entire, I now, I think I care less about the inaccuracies

974
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:42,260
and more about the absence of Richard Kind

975
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:43,640
Right, which was entire time.

976
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:45,920
What a funny person for it to be.

977
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:48,400
I don't, now I'm not like you, I'm not looking at

978
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,280
who's in the sphere crowd every night.

979
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:50,620
Yeah.

980
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:52,480
I don't know that they're friends.

981
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:53,760
I don't think I knew that at all.

982
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:54,420
You didn't know they were friends at all.

983
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:55,400
I did not know they were friends at all.

984
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:56,740
Oh, yeah, they were like apartment,

985
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,060
like they lived together, I believe.

986
00:36:58,060 --> 00:36:58,760
They lived together as well.

987
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:00,060
Yeah, I'm gonna have to double check that now

988
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:02,300
They made a TV pilot together.

989
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:03,860
But yeah, when he talks about the whole thing

990
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:06,800
with the story is like the people who let me crash

991
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,440
on their floor, that's Richard Kind

992
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,760
is absolutely one of them.

993
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:10,100
Right.

994
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:12,300
And I think it's also weird because this is a guy

995
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:15,800
with so many connection points to us, to the podcast.

996
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:17,240
He's Bing Bong.

997
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:17,940
Yeah.

998
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:19,660
He's Bing Bong who's in hell now,

999
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,440
something that's been said many times.

1000
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:24,740
He's the host of the California Adventure Opening Special

1001
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:25,860
with Barry Bostwick.

1002
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:27,680
Are you gonna tell us that Bing Bong isn't in hell?

1003
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,080
Is that what something you've learned?

1004
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,120
Point number four.

1005
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,960
No, he's in heaven.

1006
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:34,940
I've got, here is surveillance footage from heaven.

1007
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:35,720
No.

1008
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:39,120
And also you kind of forget this one.

1009
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,180
This is Clifford's dad.

1010
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:41,980
Yeah.

1011
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,700
Clifford's dad is one of the,

1012
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:45,960
this is like a tie together of things from the show

1013
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:46,840
that's crazy to me.

1014
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:50,480
Clifford's dad got one of the suitcases of a million dollars.

1015
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:53,180
I've heard, okay, I'm looking at some Clooney Kind stuff

1016
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:54,460
and I do remember this story.

1017
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:57,000
Clooney reveals that he once pranked close friend,

1018
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,080
Richard Kind by defecating in his pet cat's litter tray.

1019
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,060
Jesus.

1020
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:03,780
So Clooney took a big shit in Richard Kind's

1021
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:04,860
cat's litter box.

1022
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:07,320
I feel like I regard that less as a prank

1023
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:09,580
and more as just a aggressive act.

1024
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,260
Very foul thing to do.

1025
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:14,060
Aggressive act of meanness, I don't know.

1026
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:18,180
Look, don't do that at my litter box

1027
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:19,920
just because I did all this today

1028
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,360
and I promise I won't shit anywhere you don't want either.

1029
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:23,700
I just texted Jason.

1030
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,440
I said warm up, Jason.

1031
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,940
We have payback on our minds.

1032
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:34,680
Then we start some episode that's about like,

1033
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:36,480
here's the ride, it's the world according

1034
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,040
to goofy parade episode.

1035
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:41,520
Scott, actually maybe go check your litter box.

1036
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:45,100
Oh God, it's clearly your shit and not a cat's.

1037
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:45,700
I think it's different.

1038
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:47,040
Jason, Mike.

1039
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:49,220
Here's what I'm thinking off the top of my head.

1040
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,860
We fool you into thinking we're doing

1041
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:52,100
Pirates of the Caribbean week.

1042
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:55,700
And each episode starts with one of us taking a big shit

1043
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:58,760
in one of your cat's like areas, litter boxes.

1044
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:00,540
And you get fooled each time.

1045
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:02,380
You think, all right, well, we're really doing,

1046
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:04,040
we're starting Pirates week now.

1047
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:06,600
And then, oh, no, Jason shit in the box again.

1048
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:07,900
I sit in the box.

1049
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:10,800
But we're gonna continue our exploration

1050
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,160
of Richard Kine's career.

1051
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:18,180
Is that a, yeah, yeah, that seems like a likely thing

1052
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:19,880
that we do with this, especially now.

1053
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:21,780
Yeah, it's the surprise shit.

1054
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,780
And then it's like, well, while you're here,

1055
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,480
can I tell you about the errors of Kine?

1056
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,580
It's kind week.

1057
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:28,720
We are still recording, right?

1058
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,920
I fucking have to check on that too.

1059
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,380
I think we are, no, we are recording, yes.

1060
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:32,760
Oh, I don't know what to think now.

1061
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:35,820
Now that you've got Clooney's prankster brain going.

1062
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:36,120
I know.

1063
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,360
I feel the spirit of Clooney.

1064
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:41,380
But here's another thing I'm gonna bring up.

1065
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:42,400
I'm still not done.

1066
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:45,960
I could not believe how far this rabbit hole went for me.

1067
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,560
Because still the spirit, I will say this,

1068
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:50,240
the spirit of the story remains, thus far.

1069
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:53,060
Thus far, we're still in the zone.

1070
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:54,660
I think I can't argue with you on the spirit thing.

1071
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:58,160
And also we're getting clearly further and further away

1072
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,640
from my initial premise that the story

1073
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:01,920
is not interesting enough.

1074
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:03,520
Let me go back to this though.

1075
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:06,400
I think some of my confusion the first time it was told

1076
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:10,000
was that it was tangled up with Casamigos.

1077
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:12,760
Because I first thought that what it was

1078
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:16,120
was they sold the company and then all the investors

1079
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:18,200
in the company got a million dollars.

1080
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:20,140
And I was like, I don't care about that.

1081
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:21,180
That sucks.

1082
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:22,240
We didn't say that.

1083
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,760
Jason didn't say that, I don't think.

1084
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:26,380
That might be my own thing I was applying to it,

1085
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:28,300
much so than another game of telephone type thing.

1086
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:29,980
You have to know the reason he knows this story

1087
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:31,360
is because of the fantasy.

1088
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:34,020
That's what he was holding on to.

1089
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,460
The friend aspect was important.

1090
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:38,240
So I do not believe this man would say

1091
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:40,120
investors versus friend.

1092
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,520
I don't believe it.

1093
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:44,560
Yeah, investors get paid through the proper channels.

1094
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:45,720
That would have gone in one ear off the other

1095
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:46,440
if it was investors.

1096
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:48,420
That's why he might have been mad at it.

1097
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:50,540
These fat cats, fuck them, they have enough money.

1098
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:52,920
Oh, a friend got a million dollars, eh?

1099
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:57,940
Guy you met in improv 2009, that would be sticking.

1100
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:01,620
Anyway, that's my own thing that I was adding to.

1101
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:03,760
But I haven't tangled up in that the whole time.

1102
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:06,340
And then Randy Gerber got a million dollars.

1103
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:07,540
Yeah, they sold the company.

1104
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,600
This has been, I get it.

1105
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:12,240
I do understand what's interesting about friends

1106
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,860
getting a million dollars out of nowhere.

1107
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,360
And obviously I wouldn't talk about any of this

1108
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:16,920
if it wasn't.

1109
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:18,580
That part was in there, but you're right.

1110
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:21,560
You have made it, really highlighting,

1111
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:24,040
underlining Richard Kind makes the story better.

1112
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:25,640
You're right about that for sure.

1113
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:27,680
It's like a massive detail has been gone.

1114
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:30,540
It is interesting that it's not a briefcase

1115
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:34,020
because the briefcase seems like movie style.

1116
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:36,960
It does seem a little bit impractical

1117
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:39,280
because obviously it wouldn't fit the bills.

1118
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:41,540
I have an image, you understand that.

1119
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:43,780
We've all seen something where a briefcase opens

1120
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:44,880
and there's a ton of money.

1121
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:46,740
It's pretty unfamiliar imagery

1122
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:49,440
to think of a high-end rolling suitcase.

1123
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:52,100
You're right, being put onto a table.

1124
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:53,820
Everybody had to go lift them.

1125
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:56,300
There was a heist involved in this, by the way,

1126
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:58,440
also in further details that came out

1127
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:00,860
in a GQ interview with Clooney in 2020.

1128
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:05,320
To do this, he still had to keep it secret from his friends,

1129
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:06,940
so it was a heist situation.

1130
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:10,080
So he rented a van that said florist on it.

1131
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,580
Like the way FBI guys would hide

1132
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:14,160
if they were monitoring somebody.

1133
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:16,460
Yeah, again, I have to admit,

1134
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,280
we're getting the interesting here.

1135
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:20,660
And he had to go find a weird,

1136
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:24,300
he had the question, where do I get $14 million

1137
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:25,840
in $20 bills?

1138
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:28,220
And he just said, I found a place.

1139
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:30,600
And he had to go there with security guards

1140
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:32,160
who he says were shitting themselves

1141
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:35,460
and they all had to handle this covert operation.

1142
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:38,060
It was supposed to look like they were stealing money.

1143
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:41,040
Were they shitting themselves in Richard Kynes litter box?

1144
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:46,660
for a good reason, for a good prank.

1145
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:50,000
Hollywood liberals are pushing for litter boxes

1146
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,740
in classrooms with Richard Kynes on the box?

1147
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:56,200
It sounds like a Grand Theft Auto mission

1148
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:57,200
with George Clooney.

1149
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:01,020
I mean, that is a part that makes, yeah.

1150
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:03,420
I mean, obviously, like even in the briefcase scenario,

1151
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:05,220
there had to be some sort of weird,

1152
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:07,880
like Brinks truck style situation,

1153
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:11,020
even if the bills were higher, higher denomination.

1154
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:13,980
Maybe less, it is like that switch from 20,

1155
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:18,000
from hundreds to 20s grows the proportion of the money

1156
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,400
by five times.

1157
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:21,800
How much bigger of an operation it becomes.

1158
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:23,500
That is so impractical too.

1159
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:26,460
That feels to me like he really wanted to make a statement

1160
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:30,720
about the bills, like he wanted to make a big show of it

1161
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:32,300
more so than what hundreds would have been.

1162
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:33,340
Well, he's a showman.

1163
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:35,220
He has that je ne sais quoi.

1164
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:36,080
He has that.

1165
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:37,020
He has that je ne sais quoi

1166
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:39,200
that we talk about on this show a lot.

1167
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:43,220
I wanna know now, yeah, what the gravity payday was.

1168
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:44,540
Because I think both him and Sandra Bullock

1169
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:46,320
both made like some insane amount of money

1170
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:47,780
because Gravity was a massive hit.

1171
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:49,500
I didn't know it was such a big hit.

1172
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:52,000
Yeah, that's a pretty huge movie.

1173
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:55,160
And the kind of movie you had to see before,

1174
00:43:55,660 --> 00:43:58,520
well, it was after one Avatar, but before another,

1175
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:00,340
but like that's, you wanted to see that

1176
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:01,740
in the highest quality.

1177
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:03,740
So you're paying a lot of money to see it maybe.

1178
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:06,880
See, I didn't, I never hunted it down on DVD

1179
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:07,680
or whatever it was to be.

1180
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:10,320
We're like, oh, you can't see it in theaters, don't bother.

1181
00:44:10,660 --> 00:44:11,660
Oh, so you never saw it.

1182
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:12,540
I never saw it.

1183
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:15,300
Oh, so that's what the, that's the problem.

1184
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:18,300
Jace never saw Gravity, so he wasn't even thinking about it.

1185
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:20,340
Oh, I would have come in and out of that thing going,

1186
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:22,240
what a moving picture.

1187
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:24,520
And imagine the payday.

1188
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:25,880
That's what I'm saying.

1189
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,580
You would have said, this is a dynamite picture.

1190
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:29,440
And you would have, then you would have been reading

1191
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:31,100
the trades and you would have been tracking it

1192
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:32,240
and you would have remembered, oh,

1193
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:33,520
look how much money they made.

1194
00:44:33,620 --> 00:44:35,820
Cause they made, they had like a better deal

1195
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:38,580
than like Nicholson had on Batman, which was a very like.

1196
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:39,680
It was better than that?

1197
00:44:39,740 --> 00:44:42,140
Which is like the, that was like a Guinness Book of World

1198
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:43,220
records situation.

1199
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:44,480
Yeah, don't quote me that that was better.

1200
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:46,580
But Nicholson made a lot of money on Batman

1201
00:44:46,580 --> 00:44:47,560
cause he took points.

1202
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:48,240
Right, right.

1203
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:50,340
He may be like, I don't know if he invented it,

1204
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:52,840
but he was a very early person to do that.

1205
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:56,020
They were giving, or Brando, Brando turned down points

1206
00:44:56,020 --> 00:44:57,220
on something, I feel like.

1207
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:59,140
They offered him points on either Godfather

1208
00:44:59,140 --> 00:45:00,120
or Superman or something.

1209
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:00,860
Hmm, hmm.

1210
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:03,080
And then he, he, he, he took the money

1211
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:04,140
cause he was broke, I believe.

1212
00:45:04,180 --> 00:45:07,080
And then he didn't get any of the big payday.

1213
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:08,320
Oh, Brando, oh bummer.

1214
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:11,300
But yeah, Jason would have come out of Gravity like, wow,

1215
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:12,160
what a film.

1216
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:14,380
I hope this thing does bang up,

1217
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:16,740
bap off of a box office.

1218
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:17,220
Bap off of a box office.

1219
00:45:17,620 --> 00:45:19,400
Boy, I'll tell you, if this guy doesn't end up

1220
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:21,900
with 14 million dollars that he can give to his friends

1221
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:25,080
for no reason, then this industry is broken.

1222
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:26,160
Wow, yeah.

1223
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:29,760
Okay, so now that we've started to identify

1224
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:30,980
who these people, one is the guy,

1225
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:33,180
I think the name is Grant Heslov, his producing partner.

1226
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:34,180
One is Richard Kind.

1227
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:37,240
There's, there's quite, one is Randy Gerber, obviously.

1228
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:40,800
There's a question as to who the rest of the 14 are.

1229
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,880
And there's articles that are confident about this,

1230
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,340
but I don't know if I really trust them.

1231
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:47,840
And part of it is because I'm so freaked out by

1232
00:45:48,340 --> 00:45:50,740
one of the people that I'm looking at in this photo.

1233
00:45:50,780 --> 00:45:51,960
I'm gonna hand this to you, Mike.

1234
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:55,280
Do you see anybody who is familiar to you?

1235
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:57,200
And keeping, now we're in the territory,

1236
00:45:57,700 --> 00:45:59,380
again, in getting me into this story,

1237
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:01,500
now we're in the territory of people I like.

1238
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:02,220
So, so.

1239
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:04,360
My God, it's the Boston Strangler.

1240
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:06,320
Well, the first.

1241
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:07,080
Yeah, my hero.

1242
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:09,220
The BTK killer behind him.

1243
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:12,020
First of all, one of the guys looks like Jeffrey Epstein.

1244
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:13,400
Possibly.

1245
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:16,280
Yeah, that's again, my hero, all the guys I like.

1246
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:17,760
I'm not saying that was one of the guys you like.

1247
00:46:17,860 --> 00:46:20,400
I'm just saying the first guy I look at looks exactly like

1248
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:22,660
maybe like a 10 years older Jeffrey Epstein.

1249
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:24,840
He needs that money for plain fuel.

1250
00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:27,460
Yeah, so it's not, I don't believe it's him,

1251
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:28,960
but he really looks like him.

1252
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:30,740
Okay, but I know what you're,

1253
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:32,880
I know exactly my eyes go right to the man.

1254
00:46:33,140 --> 00:46:35,540
He doesn't have as big a hair as I'm normally used to.

1255
00:46:35,540 --> 00:46:36,960
Well, you had to tone it down for a wedding.

1256
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:38,480
This is a photo from Clooney's wedding,

1257
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:39,760
but you know who I'm talking about?

1258
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:41,020
You're talking about Steve Lukather.

1259
00:46:41,420 --> 00:46:42,540
Steve Lukather.

1260
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:44,480
Steve Lukather from.

1261
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,160
Also, this whole time, potentially,

1262
00:46:47,660 --> 00:46:50,020
one of the brief suitcase owners.

1263
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:50,740
I gotta get my mic up for Stanford.

1264
00:46:50,740 --> 00:46:53,960
Is one of the musicians I love the most.

1265
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:54,240
Yeah.

1266
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:55,220
Talk about the most.

1267
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:56,820
I've weirdly named him for no reason

1268
00:46:56,820 --> 00:46:58,580
other than that it makes me happy to talk about him.

1269
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:01,080
Steve Lukather, founding member of Toto.

1270
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:05,860
He played every, he's a member of Ringo's All-Star Band.

1271
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:07,440
Which we saw together.

1272
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:07,940
Yeah.

1273
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:10,860
He is, among many things,

1274
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:13,400
the guitar solo on Olivia Newton-John's physical.

1275
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:16,420
He plays every lick of guitar on Beat It

1276
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:18,940
besides the Eddie Van Halen solo.

1277
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:21,780
This is a legend, played on a hundred things,

1278
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:22,680
everybody knows.

1279
00:47:23,820 --> 00:47:25,940
I'm specifically a big fan of this guy,

1280
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:28,620
and I'm looking at this photo like, he's one of those.

1281
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:30,880
So that's for, you think that's for sure the 14?

1282
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:32,200
I don't know.

1283
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:36,960
I think it is speculation on the part of several media outlets

1284
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:39,760
that this photo is the 14.

1285
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:41,480
It contains some of the 14.

1286
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Interesting.

1287
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,400
But I don't- Ocean's 14.

1288
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:46,240
That's what they're talking about doing too

1289
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:46,900
is another sequel.

1290
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:48,180
Well it should be one of these people

1291
00:47:48,180 --> 00:47:49,360
because you've got-

1292
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:49,720
It's Lukather.

1293
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:51,320
You've already, okay, you got Lukather,

1294
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:53,040
he can bust some guitar solos in it.

1295
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:55,720
You've got Richard Kind, who of course is gonna deliver.

1296
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:58,960
You've got the most charismatic man on the planet,

1297
00:47:59,040 --> 00:47:59,800
Randy Gerber.

1298
00:48:00,020 --> 00:48:00,420
Yeah.

1299
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:03,100
Just the sex personified guy.

1300
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:03,720
Yeah.

1301
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:04,000
A guy.

1302
00:48:04,220 --> 00:48:06,300
Take a seat George, you're not gonna do

1303
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:08,260
I don't wanna be in the frame with him.

1304
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:09,480
I'm never, he's my best friend,

1305
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:11,060
but I don't ever wanna be in the frame with him.

1306
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:15,140
It's George's day, I'm gonna step away, you know?

1307
00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:18,140
I'll just break the cameras with my shine.

1308
00:48:19,620 --> 00:48:22,120
Here's what I, it then occurred to me that like,

1309
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:25,660
I did know some connection between Lukather and Clooney

1310
00:48:25,660 --> 00:48:28,260
because I've read this man's book,

1311
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:30,060
The Gospel According to Luke,

1312
00:48:31,740 --> 00:48:33,640
my Bible, the Bible to me.

1313
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:36,600
And he tells a story in that book,

1314
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:38,940
this is where I question like, is this one of his boys

1315
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:41,060
or did they just know each other and he was at the wedding?

1316
00:48:41,220 --> 00:48:42,940
Because this isn't gonna make you think

1317
00:48:42,940 --> 00:48:44,180
this is one of his boys.

1318
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:47,260
A story that he tells is that they were at some other

1319
00:48:47,260 --> 00:48:51,320
wedding together in the 80s and Lukather is pretty drunk,

1320
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:52,340
he's pretty fucked up.

1321
00:48:52,340 --> 00:48:52,640
Sure.

1322
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:55,400
And he has hit it off with a model at the wedding,

1323
00:48:55,620 --> 00:48:59,060
somebody who is, he says is one of the models or dancers

1324
00:48:59,060 --> 00:49:01,280
in the Van Halen Hot for Teacher video.

1325
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:03,700
And they wanna get, they're like,

1326
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:07,380
let's get home and get down to business, let's go do stuff.

1327
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:11,420
And they're like, but we can't, we're too drunk to drive.

1328
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:13,200
George, would you mind?

1329
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:17,020
And a sober Clooney drove them home from this wedding,

1330
00:49:17,340 --> 00:49:19,940
but they were so like aggressively horny

1331
00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:21,940
that they just started having sex in the back

1332
00:49:21,940 --> 00:49:24,760
of Clooney's car and he had to drown it out

1333
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:27,920
by blasting the one tape or CD he had,

1334
00:49:27,940 --> 00:49:30,800
which was his own aunt, Rosemary Clooney.

1335
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:35,800
So he's blasting his aunt's crooning.

1336
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:37,760
This story happened to Jason, I too.

1337
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:38,880
Wonderful performers.

1338
00:49:39,580 --> 00:49:42,440
Yeah, Jason was talking, it was 2009,

1339
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:46,040
somebody was in like the Killers,

1340
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:47,100
It was the Killers music video.

1341
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:49,280
Are We Human or Are We Dancer video.

1342
00:49:49,340 --> 00:49:51,060
Jason was talking to this model from the video

1343
00:49:51,660 --> 00:49:53,340
and they were so drunk, we were at a wedding

1344
00:49:53,340 --> 00:49:55,300
and then I drove the two of them home

1345
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:56,720
and they started doing it.

1346
00:49:56,980 --> 00:49:59,940
And you played the CD that your aunt made.

1347
00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:01,980
Yeah, my aunt, Rosemary Carlson.

1348
00:50:03,020 --> 00:50:03,300
Yeah.

1349
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:08,320
Oh Michael, you're my favorite nephew.

1350
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:11,960
Jason's boning in this back seat again.

1351
00:50:12,820 --> 00:50:15,040
Tell me what Brandon Flowers was like, baby.

1352
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,720
Jason, oh, I turn it up more.

1353
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:21,240
Oh God, Jason.

1354
00:50:21,620 --> 00:50:25,260
Mike, you know that's my king, Brandon Flowers' anecdotes.

1355
00:50:25,380 --> 00:50:28,260
Okay, so you're gonna have to deal.

1356
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:32,720
Wow, Luke, so that obviously suggests

1357
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:34,480
that's where they met, right?

1358
00:50:34,540 --> 00:50:36,160
Or maybe familiar with each other before

1359
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:38,340
and that's where they bonded, is that what that's saying?

1360
00:50:38,460 --> 00:50:41,840
Another thing that really gave was a eureka moment for me

1361
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:43,340
because also having read this book,

1362
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:46,260
I realized that I do know someone else in the picture

1363
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:48,700
and it makes sense why Lukather is tied to all this.

1364
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:50,440
Jeffrey Epps because he was a frequent,

1365
00:50:50,860 --> 00:50:54,240
no, never, my awesome guitar virtuoso.

1366
00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:55,960
Hopefully the names aren't coming out

1367
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:57,760
in the next few weeks when we release this.

1368
00:50:58,060 --> 00:50:58,840
Oh yeah.

1369
00:50:59,380 --> 00:51:00,340
Oh yeah, God.

1370
00:51:00,540 --> 00:51:00,540
Oh no.

1371
00:51:00,620 --> 00:51:01,900
How many of the men are named?

1372
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:02,720
All 14.

1373
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:04,380
All 14.

1374
00:51:05,180 --> 00:51:05,180
Yeah.

1375
00:51:05,660 --> 00:51:08,560
No, Lukather was really tight friends

1376
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:11,680
with somebody else in this photo, the actor Miguel Ferrer.

1377
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:12,740
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, I know him.

1378
00:51:12,740 --> 00:51:14,460
That's the guy all the way on the right

1379
00:51:14,460 --> 00:51:16,540
and it's a big part of the book.

1380
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:20,580
He's emotionally destroyed when Miguel Ferrer passes away.

1381
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:24,200
So, and I think that was the connection point.

1382
00:51:24,340 --> 00:51:25,760
So I remembered that, oh, that makes sense.

1383
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:28,920
And then I was like, okay, so now we have one more

1384
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:30,360
of the 14, the people really do think

1385
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:32,800
that Miguel is one of the 14

1386
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:35,800
and I'm gonna bring it all the way full circle here.

1387
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:38,500
I was trying to think, what do we know Miguel Ferrer?

1388
00:51:38,580 --> 00:51:40,760
Do you offhand know, what is he in?

1389
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:42,200
Because of course you've seen him in things.

1390
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:43,140
Yeah, I know him, but I don't.

1391
00:51:43,140 --> 00:51:44,700
I can't think off the top of my head.

1392
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:45,880
I was like, what is he in?

1393
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:46,860
I had to think of something.

1394
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:49,860
He is in the movie Blank Check.

1395
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:52,840
Again, now we've expanded this story

1396
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:55,920
to where it involves Blank Check and Clifford.

1397
00:51:56,380 --> 00:51:58,040
It's really all coming together.

1398
00:51:59,340 --> 00:52:01,160
But then I was like, oh yeah, so wait,

1399
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:02,320
what was he in Blank Check?

1400
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:04,880
And I looked it up and in this movie,

1401
00:52:05,180 --> 00:52:07,980
Miguel Ferrer is a criminal who is trying

1402
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:10,200
to pull a money laundering scheme.

1403
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,220
This is when he gets into a bike accident with a boy

1404
00:52:13,220 --> 00:52:14,480
who ends up with a blank check.

1405
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:17,920
But what's initially occurring is that Miguel

1406
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:20,400
is trying to pull something with a bank.

1407
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:21,880
He's threatening a bank guy

1408
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:25,660
and what he's trying to do basically is cleanly launder

1409
00:52:25,660 --> 00:52:27,540
something that he is in possession of.

1410
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:28,240
A million dollars.

1411
00:52:28,540 --> 00:52:30,840
A briefcase with a million dollars.

1412
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:35,460
Well, well, well, history doesn't repeat itself

1413
00:52:35,460 --> 00:52:37,240
at some times and rhymes.

1414
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:39,340
When you discovered this, was it like 3 a.

1415
00:52:39,340 --> 00:52:39,400
m.

1416
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:39,600
Scott

1417
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:40,880
and you were just like put it all together

1418
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:41,500
with the big board?

1419
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:42,260
It was 3 a.

1420
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:42,540
m.

1421
00:52:42,540 --> 00:52:43,460
five days ago.

1422
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:44,500
I haven't slept since.

1423
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:46,880
Look, this episode is your masterpiece.

1424
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:48,680
I'm not being facetious about that either.

1425
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:52,080
Hey, well, thank you for saying something so kind

1426
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:54,180
after I've come in with the sprays and attack.

1427
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,220
I felt like it didn't quite have an ending.

1428
00:52:58,340 --> 00:52:59,860
I was like, maybe we're gonna end up having to answer

1429
00:52:59,860 --> 00:53:00,860
one of these questions.

1430
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:03,380
I almost told you guys like,

1431
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:05,320
hey, I got a couple of appointments today.

1432
00:53:05,540 --> 00:53:06,340
I'll set it out.

1433
00:53:06,340 --> 00:53:08,420
You guys just do post office without me.

1434
00:53:08,420 --> 00:53:09,140
We just would have.

1435
00:53:09,140 --> 00:53:10,000
That would have been good at all.

1436
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:11,500
And I imagine you would have just answered

1437
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:12,480
some of the questions.

1438
00:53:12,780 --> 00:53:13,820
Maybe we wouldn't have recorded.

1439
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:14,980
Or just not recorded.

1440
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,960
I refuse to do this without Jason present.

1441
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:18,140
You must be here.

1442
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:20,820
And for the full, for the usual suspects

1443
00:53:20,820 --> 00:53:22,940
tying it all together, wait a minute.

1444
00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:27,440
And Miguel Ferrer had a briefcase with a million dollars.

1445
00:53:27,580 --> 00:53:29,500
And then that made me think, wait a minute,

1446
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:32,000
how did the money fit in the briefcase?

1447
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:33,160
I checked the movie.

1448
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:34,700
It's in the first five minutes.

1449
00:53:34,860 --> 00:53:35,780
It's in hundreds.

1450
00:53:38,100 --> 00:53:40,080
I mean, they wouldn't do something inaccurate.

1451
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:43,080
There's no, like they, I'm sure they thought about hundreds

1452
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:44,340
being able to fit in the briefcase.

1453
00:53:44,460 --> 00:53:45,460
The movie wouldn't be inaccurate.

1454
00:53:45,460 --> 00:53:48,200
The movie took so much longer to make back then too.

1455
00:53:48,380 --> 00:53:49,220
So they had that Dr.

1456
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:50,520
T's dress.

1457
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:52,080
Well, you shoot on film,

1458
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:53,780
just automatically getting it developed.

1459
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:54,980
That's gonna be longer than it took.

1460
00:53:55,700 --> 00:53:56,500
More laborious.

1461
00:53:56,940 --> 00:53:57,040
Yeah, yeah.

1462
00:53:57,620 --> 00:53:59,580
Social media, gotta have that marketing campaign.

1463
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:01,700
As you know, Kevin Smith was like kind of editing

1464
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:04,160
Clerks 2 sort of like on the avid as they shot.

1465
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:05,400
I remember reading about it.

1466
00:54:05,420 --> 00:54:07,660
So yeah, that probably, that didn't happen till later.

1467
00:54:08,580 --> 00:54:09,040
2000s, yeah.

1468
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:09,860
Yeah, 2000s, yeah.

1469
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:10,740
Huh, huh.

1470
00:54:10,820 --> 00:54:13,760
So that really, which is what really like cracked it all

1471
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:17,680
open, why Clerks 2 was able to achieve the quality that.

1472
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:19,260
People didn't believe in editing as you go

1473
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:20,900
until Clerks 2 came out.

1474
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:23,280
And then it broke it wide open.

1475
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:27,060
So, Shoenmaker was like, how did you do it?

1476
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:29,920
Hey, George, you wanna have a seat?

1477
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:31,220
Let me show you what I'm, oh yeah, sure.

1478
00:54:31,580 --> 00:54:35,660
Oh God, oh, I didn't know the possibilities of digital

1479
00:54:35,660 --> 00:54:36,440
until this moment.

1480
00:54:38,380 --> 00:54:39,940
So there you go.

1481
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:41,580
We've come full circle on this.

1482
00:54:41,580 --> 00:54:45,900
I had a feeling that there would be a full hour in all of this.

1483
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:49,040
But again, I come back to the, you know, we can hem and haw

1484
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:53,220
about these details, but I go back to the first, the fateful day

1485
00:54:53,220 --> 00:54:56,080
that the story was first attempted to be told.

1486
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:59,960
And what was in Jason's mind other than here's something interesting.

1487
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:04,120
And after all this, I have to admit that there is plenty interesting

1488
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:08,720
surrounding the George Clooney suitcase story.

1489
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:15,940
So what you have now done, now you've delivered a very entertaining

1490
00:55:15,940 --> 00:55:16,980
podcast episode.

1491
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:17,820
Again, I'll say that.

1492
00:55:18,020 --> 00:55:20,440
Well, not for anyone who wants to hear about theme parks.

1493
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:24,540
Well, that, but the people who are paying us, there's something wrong with them.

1494
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:26,440
And I mean that in the best way.

1495
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:35,460
But what you've done now is you've turned now what's a fun bit once in a while

1496
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:38,240
that could maybe be done in three minutes into like seven minutes.

1497
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:40,360
As far as when the story has to be repeated.

1498
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:44,460
So the next time that Griffin pimps us out in front of an audience

1499
00:55:44,460 --> 00:55:45,100
Yeah.

1500
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:47,660
And a theme park luminary.

1501
00:55:47,820 --> 00:55:49,880
Now that's going to eat up seven minutes of the show.

1502
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:50,600
Yes, exactly.

1503
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:54,040
And then I'm in there and then Steve, look at there was one of that.

1504
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:59,120
And then just like he's like we lost him minute one.

1505
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:01,500
You're going to have like you're going to have like 90 seconds

1506
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:06,680
on just the guitar pedals that he used when he was doing Beat It or Africa

1507
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:07,180
or something.

1508
00:56:07,180 --> 00:56:08,180
He just sat down.

1509
00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:08,420
They did.

1510
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:10,600
They didn't transcribe a part for him when he had to do.

1511
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:11,300
I keep forgetting.

1512
00:56:11,300 --> 00:56:12,180
He thought of that part.

1513
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:14,040
That's that was all in.

1514
00:56:14,220 --> 00:56:15,040
It was all Luke.

1515
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:16,940
There'll be a couple of shots at Weezer in that story.

1516
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:18,400
Now that's built in.

1517
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:24,340
There's so much added to the story now because of this episode,

1518
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:28,000
which only builds out the Joua de Vivre of podcast, the riot

1519
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,760
and the mythology we've created here.

1520
00:56:29,980 --> 00:56:30,620
I think so.

1521
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:31,440
And you know what?

1522
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:35,820
And and and look, I mean, I've played the part of somebody who's mad about the story,

1523
00:56:35,820 --> 00:56:39,060
but I've ended up getting a lot of joy out of the things that I've

1524
00:56:39,060 --> 00:56:41,760
discovered from the story is hell being in there.

1525
00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:46,340
That's so fun that you don't think about a rock, a real rock and roll.

1526
00:56:46,740 --> 00:56:47,640
He's one of the listeners.

1527
00:56:47,820 --> 00:56:51,500
If you've never seen him, he's like up until he doesn't dye his hair anymore,

1528
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:55,040
but he was like jet black way too late and like big old hair,

1529
00:56:55,380 --> 00:56:57,420
a kind that no one his age should be doing.

1530
00:56:57,700 --> 00:57:00,880
If you think he means well, you know, he's trying to keep the spirit alive.

1531
00:57:01,060 --> 00:57:03,820
You know, caught him briefly, you would say is that Adam Durwitz,

1532
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:07,260
from counting crows, definitely because they both have similar

1533
00:57:07,260 --> 00:57:09,600
they both have similar looks and they both have the big hair.

1534
00:57:09,940 --> 00:57:14,040
And Adam, I know, cut the big dreads for a while, but I think he's grown them back.

1535
00:57:14,380 --> 00:57:17,340
From what I know, one recognizes me if I don't have been doing.

1536
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:19,860
I don't know if I said this before, he's been doing a Taylor Swift song

1537
00:57:19,860 --> 00:57:24,000
and concert that keeps popping up on YouTube and I'll click it and watch it every time.

1538
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:24,280
Wow.

1539
00:57:24,420 --> 00:57:25,880
And I can't remember the name of it.

1540
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:28,880
I'm scared, though, now that now that you're getting like

1541
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:32,140
Adam Durwitz seems like a perfect candidate to have some story

1542
00:57:32,140 --> 00:57:33,660
that's told a million times.

1543
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:37,560
And then I'm then four years later, I'm saying, but the story wasn't right.

1544
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:39,920
Mike's saying, but the spirit of the Durwitz story.

1545
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:44,240
I've read a fact recently that he dated two of the Friends cast members.

1546
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:45,720
Jay, of course he did.

1547
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:48,640
This man was it was Aniston and Cox, I believe.

1548
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:50,740
No, no Kudrow, though.

1549
00:57:51,060 --> 00:57:51,820
We are guys.

1550
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:52,920
Are you sure about that?

1551
00:57:53,180 --> 00:57:55,420
I would bet a million fucking dollars

1552
00:57:55,420 --> 00:57:58,440
that Adam Durwitz did it.

1553
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:00,480
What are you putting that million in, my brother?

1554
00:58:01,900 --> 00:58:03,280
You're going to go with the two me.

1555
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:03,720
They're going to.

1556
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:04,380
Well, they're going to be.

1557
00:58:04,460 --> 00:58:06,800
I mean, you know, I'm going to put them in a little like shoebox

1558
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:08,200
and it's going to be a thousand dollar bills.

1559
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:13,040
Oh, I also looked up that I don't think a thousand dollar bills exist anymore.

1560
00:58:13,100 --> 00:58:14,300
That was in my head, too.

1561
00:58:14,380 --> 00:58:14,740
Yeah.

1562
00:58:14,820 --> 00:58:16,460
Oh, is that what it's going to end up?

1563
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:18,060
Five hundred dollars bills, though, exist probably.

1564
00:58:18,180 --> 00:58:18,700
I don't know.

1565
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:21,320
Well, if you go to one of those secret currency places

1566
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:24,120
that Clooney went to, they might still have some older current.

1567
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:26,000
The only secret place.

1568
00:58:26,340 --> 00:58:26,340
Yeah.

1569
00:58:26,460 --> 00:58:29,680
Or it would be funny to give everyone like 20s or hundreds,

1570
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:31,540
but kind gets two dollar bills.

1571
00:58:32,340 --> 00:58:33,140
Sorry, Richard.

1572
00:58:34,060 --> 00:58:39,060
There's a there's a Hyundai Elantra parked outside for you to drive the money.

1573
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:41,520
Another classic Clooney prank.

1574
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:42,020
Yeah.

1575
00:58:42,020 --> 00:58:42,280
Perfect.

1576
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:45,860
Well, there you have it.

1577
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:50,300
Graham Southwood, I have to really thank you for inspiring

1578
00:58:50,850 --> 00:58:55,820
an entire episode here and for I mean, look, Graham ended up like really

1579
00:58:55,820 --> 00:58:57,180
not by any attempt.

1580
00:58:57,320 --> 00:59:00,820
It is he really cut the line in front of all of the listeners who asked

1581
00:59:00,820 --> 00:59:03,000
other questions, but we will.

1582
00:59:03,340 --> 00:59:04,340
But I think he earned it.

1583
00:59:04,460 --> 00:59:08,820
I feel like incredible sleuthing, you know.

1584
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:09,960
But again, I do.

1585
00:59:10,060 --> 00:59:14,040
I also say to Graham, even your subject line major error in Clooney briefcase story.

1586
00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:17,460
Yeah, was an error in that, too, which is that it's a Clooney suitcase story.

1587
00:59:17,580 --> 00:59:23,040
So even he, the correct order, even the correct even the great Graham Southwood.

1588
00:59:23,260 --> 00:59:24,880
Graham, you were wrong, too, brother.

1589
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:25,940
Watch your back.

1590
00:59:26,300 --> 00:59:27,200
Watch your back.

1591
00:59:27,260 --> 00:59:28,140
Watch your back.

1592
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:29,360
Do you have a cat?

1593
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:31,900
Do you have a litter box in your apartment or house?

1594
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:34,000
Because I'm sending a guy over there.

1595
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:39,060
OK, you better protect that litter box or else this human man is going to take a big old shit.

1596
00:59:39,380 --> 00:59:40,520
You're getting pranked.

1597
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:42,620
The ultimate prank, a human shit somewhere.

1598
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:47,400
It should never know whether the guy is going to be me or beloved actor Richard.

1599
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:51,200
Richard, you probably want to get revenge on

1600
00:59:52,260 --> 00:59:54,720
somebody with whose name starts with G.

1601
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:55,460
Right.

1602
00:59:55,700 --> 00:59:57,340
Well, we've got an opportunity for you.

1603
00:59:57,380 --> 00:59:59,080
Clooney should have shit in the suitcase.

1604
01:00:00,020 --> 01:00:02,220
And Richard opened it and it was a big shit in there.

1605
01:00:02,540 --> 01:00:03,700
Richard, you open yours last.

1606
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:05,920
OK, can do whatever you need.

1607
01:00:06,220 --> 01:00:07,400
George, I'm just excited to be.

1608
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:08,360
This is an exciting.

1609
01:00:08,660 --> 01:00:08,840
Wow.

1610
01:00:08,980 --> 01:00:11,140
September, September 27th, 2013.

1611
01:00:11,340 --> 01:00:12,900
I think I'll never forget this night.

1612
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:14,840
All right.

1613
01:00:14,940 --> 01:00:18,900

01:00:32,060 --> 01:00:32,740
Screen grabs somewhere.

01:00:33,060 --> 01:00:35,900
You should thank thank the listeners for being part of the con.

1621
01:00:36,820 --> 01:00:37,140
Uh huh.

1622
01:00:37,360 --> 01:00:38,220
You know, you're right.

1623
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:38,660
Yes.

Yeah.
