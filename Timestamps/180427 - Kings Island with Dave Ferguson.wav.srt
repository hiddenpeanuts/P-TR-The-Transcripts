00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Warning, today's podcast contains an averted Brady Bunch disaster, a brief yet thrilling discussion of Kathy Ireland's business ventures,

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:16,000
a revelation that's as shocking as a bird in the face, and a less than comprehensive exploration of Kings Island with Dave Ferguson.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:40,000
It's amazing in here, it's Podcast the Ride.

4
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Welcome to Podcast the Ride, the theme park podcast so thorough we will eventually do an episode about every King Arthur carousel horse.

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:56,000
It'll be a 68 part series, look forward to that. Next year's of time, I'm Scott Gardner, joined by Mike Carlson.

6
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Every horse has a backstory.

7
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I would imagine. And war will make one up. And Jason Sheridan.

8
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Can't wait to get to those horses.

9
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I mean the red saddled one is different than the blue saddled one is different than the blue with the gold trim.

10
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Yeah, absolutely.

11
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Is different than the silver with the purple trim.

12
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
And if you don't know that, you're trash.

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
You shouldn't be able to turn around right now, not the podcast for you.

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
But you know who is invited and who's hanging out with us today?

15
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:32,000
One of my favorite folks, I'm so glad he's here, from the birthday boys from Comedy Bang Bang, from Sarah Silverman's I Love You America, it's Dave Ferguson.

16
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Hey, hey guys, how's it going?

17
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Oh, it's good. Good to have you. Hello, hello.

18
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
You know that carousel is not all horses, right?

19
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I think, yeah.

20
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
There are probably chairs and other things.

21
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
There's a bench or two.

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
So you're gonna do a bench episode.

23
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Oh, I'm a big fan of the bench on a carousel.

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
That'll be nice to break up the flow, actually. It's maybe the most unique episode.

25
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Everybody does the kid that ran for the bench.

26
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Yeah, because I have tall legs, so sometimes they bang into the ground if you're on a horse. Not bang, but you have to hold them up.

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
But like if I'm trying to have fun and not put them in the stirrups, put my feet in the stirrups, I can't.

28
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Well, not to mention your big balls.

29
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Yeah, I got giant balls.

30
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Trying to straddle those horses.

31
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Yeah, that's impossible. There's no, like there should be a groove in it in case you have giant balls.

32
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
The Carlson groove.

33
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. So the bench is perfect for a large, bald, tall-legged man like me.

34
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
You gotta go carve out the ball space in advance if you want to take that ride.

35
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Most places aren't letting you do that.

36
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
That sucks.

37
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Dave, you're here to talk about probably your childhood theme park or what you grew up with.

38
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Yeah, other than the local YMCA.

39
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Which we will also do an episode of.

40
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Kings Island.

41
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Kings Island. And when we were talking about topics, you also mentioned Cedar Point you spent a lot of time at.

42
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,000
But I feel like partially selfishly, I wanted to talk about Kings Island, and I'm glad you wanted to do so.

43
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I've been to Kings Island, I was lucky enough to go, and I have very fond feelings towards it.

44
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Yeah, it's a great park, I can't wait to talk about it. How old were you when you went?

45
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I went in 2005. I was in college, my college girlfriend is in the Cincinnati, Columbus area.

46
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
So yeah, she set up a special Kings Island day.

47
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Oh man.

48
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
We also went to the Ohio State Fair where we saw the zombies perform.

49
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Wow.

50
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Which is legitimate, I'd seen the zombies before. That's a great band to see at a state fair.

51
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
And also, Denny Lane, who is the lesser wing.

52
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Of course.

53
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Who performed a very slow.

54
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I know who Denny Lane is.

55
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
But you may be the only person listening who does.

56
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
My mom does.

57
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Uh huh.

58
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
My mom and dad.

59
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Shout out to Mike's mom, shout out to Denny Lane.

60
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:50,000
That concert was weird because he, it felt a little tepid.

61
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Which wasn't like, and he was playing a lot of songs that he didn't write, and then at the end he's kind of guilting you with like,

62
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Put your hands in the air for George, put your hands in the air for John, for Linda.

63
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:11,000
He's like associating, he's like dredging up the guilt you might have, like forcing your hands into the air to pay homage to those who passed.

64
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Okay.

65
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Rather than propelling them into the air via his rock skills.

66
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
It sounds like, it doesn't sound like the normal Denny Lane show I've always heard about.

67
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I'll tell you that.

68
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
It sounds like real weird, real unusual.

69
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Not the ones you read about in Spin magazine.

70
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Yeah, yeah.

71
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
That's very true.

72
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Still packing them in 30 years later.

73
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
That Denny Heat.

74
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
In 2005, where were you at with your like, going on rides?

75
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Oh, that's a good question.

76
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Are you at the heat, like are you at the peak power of like, I will go on a roller coaster to impress a girl?

77
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Yes. Jenna, my girlfriend, made me do things more than Erin has, my now wife has made me do.

78
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
So I was kind of stretched beyond my typical roller coaster limits.

79
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Wow, because you said in the past you've ridden the Beast, right?

80
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I did ride the Beast.

81
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Which is sort of one of the signature rides of Kings Island.

82
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,000
And on the more intense end of rides that I've been on, I did the Racer.

83
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,000
And I like both of them, neither of those were like upsetting experiences.

84
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
The only one that was upsetting to me was Tomb Raider.

85
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Have you done Tomb Raider?

86
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Well, it's changed names many times, but yeah, I think the ride now known as Tomb Raider, I think I've done it.

87
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Are you talking about the Universal?

88
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
No, Tomb Raider being that there was a, they did like an indoor, yeah, yeah, yeah.

89
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I had to look this up in my memory lane trip, but it was not called Tomb Raider when I last went.

90
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Oh, okay.

91
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Was it called the Crypt?

92
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Yeah.

93
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I believe was the public domain version of it.

94
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Yeah.

95
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:52,000
And it seemed like it sporadically operated after, like the effects wouldn't have been at 100%.

96
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Right. Well, it's funny because it's so exciting to talk about this through your lens, because to me, it was the local park.

97
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I didn't know that the Beast had national appeal.

98
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Okay.

99
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I know the Beast.

100
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
It's critical. Yeah.

101
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Because there was a very popular YA like thriller horror book called The Beast that takes place in Kings Island.

102
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Oh, does someone get hit by a bird in the face in the Beast?

103
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:25,000
No, they travel back in time, probably to the original park that inspired Coney Island, which used to be down the road from this.

104
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
And then there was a sequel to the book called Son of Beast.

105
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Wow.

106
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Like that came out in conjunction with that ride.

107
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Yeah, that ride opening or the announcement of that ride opening.

108
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,000
But this was like a Goosebumps, you know, Fear Street style like horror book.

109
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:51,000
And it's about Kings Island and it's about the Beast and about kids who get stuck in the past and then they have to get back to the future via the...

110
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I guess the Beast sent them back in time. I forget now. I really should have looked up more about the plot of this.

111
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
But we'll post it on the Twitter.

112
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:08,000
That is amazing because I mean, I was into those books and I may have just not made the connection or the overlap or didn't assume it.

113
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
But that is that's some exciting stuff right there.

114
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
This was like a weird one off book.

115
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,000
This is up there with the Wright brothers being from Dayton, Ohio. That's like my only other claim to fame for my hometown.

116
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Yeah, you finally have some points of pride in your...

117
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:29,000
You know what? Also, well, I don't know where he's from, but it's got to be around where you grew up in the area.

118
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
But Neil Armstrong, I believe.

119
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
We're not strong country. Yeah.

120
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Sure, sure. Do you feel that growing? Is there some museum? Is there some way to pay?

121
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Aeronautics is a huge deal in Dayton, Ohio. So the Wright brothers are from Dayton.

122
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
There's a bunch of famous astronauts.

123
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:49,000
So they have the they do. This is the old debate with North Carolina first in flight, whether it be where they were.

124
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
The Wright brothers had their first flight or where that whether they were born in Dayton.

125
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
What's more important for your little license plate debate?

126
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,000
But like so like that was like flight. There's a flight of fear ride at Kings Island.

127
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,000
They always tie in aeronautics into Ohio theme park.

128
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:13,000
There is a bunch of stuff because there was the Top Gun Coaster that then became the flight deck coaster.

129
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
This park. Yeah, it's fast.

130
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,000
They've had four different owners starting with Taft Broadcasting who opened it in 72.

131
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Then Paramount owned it from 1992 to 2006.

132
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
And then Cedar Fair owns it now. Right. Three different.

133
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Yeah. So three different owners. And is there one? Did you miss?

134
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
There might be some else in there. Taft, Paramount and Cedar Fair.

135
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
There was another like many one that I was there was too dry of a fact.

136
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Yeah. I think in that. Well, and also so it was owned by Paramount in the years that I enjoyed it most.

137
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
So from the 90s, early 2000s, and they would brand it up.

138
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:57,000
And then there was this weird, awkward year before they sold it to the Cedar Company where like it was still owned by Viacom.

139
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
But they were taking all the branding off. Very slowly. Caught in between.

140
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:08,000
OK, like the rights had all run out. So they were just they were taking down like I was just looking at video, just like walking around the park.

141
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:14,000
You can catch like there's a poster for the Untouchables or something like that or Days of Thunder.

142
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
They had the Wayne's World car on there for a long time.

143
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,000
And I was so excited to double check if it was real. It was not. It was not real. Yeah.

144
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Yeah. They had the Mirthmobile there.

145
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:33,000
And then, yeah, they paramounted it up during the Paramount years. And now all those like the they just restored a bunch of old names.

146
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Like one ride is now called The Bat, which is an old Coney Island ride.

147
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Oh, yeah. They just like kind of went back, which is probably great for nostalgic value.

148
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I just haven't been back to enjoy the branding. I see.

149
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Which is our primary concern. Like brands are stripped and unstripped that we got to be there.

150
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:59,000
But yeah, I was there, I guess, in the height of of Paramount in which a ride was one of my favorite rides.

151
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
There was the Italian Job. Yeah. Yeah.

152
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:15,000
The fact that there was a I was thinking like the Italian Job has to be one of the greatest disparities of popular like most like how like everlasting.

153
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:22,000
The film is versus there was a ride of it for a long time, which doesn't really reflect the movie.

154
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I mean, you could call this the same ride could also be like Fast and Furious, the roller coaster.

155
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:38,000
This is probably a great topic for this podcast because it applies to all theme parks or movie theme parks, which is like a good movie doesn't necessarily equal a good ride.

156
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:44,000
No, that's bad movies sometimes make like great like the Waterworld stunt show is great.

157
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
But I don't know that I ever need to watch all three hours of water.

158
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Totally, totally like that sequence where Tarzan and the animated Disney Tarzan where he's like surfing on the vines.

159
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
That'd be a good ride. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

160
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
It's possible somebody might not like Avatar. Yes, it's possible.

161
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
But the land is great. I mean, I like both the movie and the land.

162
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I'm saying it, but it's possible. So like you could enjoy Pandora.

163
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Some psychopath out there. Yeah. Enjoy the breadth of the Akron's wings.

164
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:22,000
And so you obviously like Sivako rise to the challenge is the motto everyone has that goes into Pandora.

165
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Some of these movies were probably conceived as rides. Yes.

166
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
And then they're like, we got to make the damn movie before we can make the ride.

167
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,000
That's why I want to make movie and TV shows so I can make a ride.

168
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I believe this. Yeah, it is entirely about I did my show with with Dayton native Rob Lowe.

169
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:48,000
And there was a moment in promoting it at Comic Con. We got to do a laser tag experience for the show, which was only open for two days.

170
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:55,000
But it was they like made an immersive environment based on the show that was like still a year away from premiering.

171
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,000
And I it almost I remember people saying like we might never see Scott again. He might like bail here.

172
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
We already. Yeah, it is the most fun thing.

173
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I think it brings together probably what people who would start such a podcast love the most of all these elements of creativity.

174
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Like we did a dumb thing for birthday boys where Tim Kopp Haggis had this character that was Glandon Fugner, which is like a crappy Walt Disney.

175
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Oh, yes. And he had a Fugnerland, which is kind of this inferior Disney and pitching on what the attractions at Fugnerland are remains the most joy I've gotten out of a writing process.

176
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I wish I could summon them off and I remember loving the sketch. Do you do you remember Fugnerland? Not one.

177
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I know a lot of them were just based on like removing what's fun about like a roller coaster that's just flat.

178
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:48,000
But it's it's it's still like the specifics of amusement park go very well with our dumb brains.

179
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I think that's like, yeah, that's why roller coaster tycoon is a best selling game.

180
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I also like revisiting this stuff because I have I have never been to Kings Island.

181
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:10,000
OK, but I a number of times my family went to Kings Dominion growing up in Virginia, which was like owned by the same Kings Entertainment Company as Kings Island and Carowinds and Great America.

182
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
One of the parks called Great America and then Canadian.

183
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:21,000
There was a Canadian park to Canada's Wonderland Canada's Wonderland, which like they didn't officially own, but they operate in some weird way.

184
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:29,000
They own paramount ended up owning 80 percent of it. And there is an episode of Partridge Family or we all know that's Kings Island.

185
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:34,000
But there is a Canada's Wonderland has an episode of this crazy Canadian show called The Littlest Hobo.

186
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:40,000
It's about a dog who wanders from town to town to help people with their problems and then keeps moving on.

187
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I had this run of like watching. They're all on YouTube.

188
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I watched every little list hobo for a little while and then being at this dull brown Canadian theme park. Oh, boy.

189
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,000
That's that's your sweet spot. Yeah, yeah, that's that's the wheelhouse.

190
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:03,000
It's really interesting because like the first time I ever went to Disney World, having only ever experienced Kings Island and Cedar Point,

191
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,000
it was a pretty huge mind melter because I had never experienced a story park.

192
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,000
You know, I mean, Kings Island and Cedar Point are amazing amusement parks.

193
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I now realize in hindsight, even on like a world scale, they're like world class, but they don't mess around with them frills, baby.

194
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
No, I think I put these parks at least during the paramount.

195
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I also I think I would have gone once or twice like pre paramount, but like they always had the Hanna Barbera characters.

196
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Yes. Until like 2012. A cheaper licensing deal.

197
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Yeah. And so like I remember that when I was very young and then I remember all this paramount stuff showed up

198
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
and I didn't really ride coasters a lot as a kid.

199
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:48,000
But like I remember the Nickelodeon stuff came like mid 90s.

200
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:56,000
And then I was telling Mike, I don't think this was in Kings Island, but at Kings Dominion, there was a busy world of Richard's scary restaurants.

201
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Wow. We did not have that. I think I ate like every meal there that I could.

202
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I thought it was great. I think like this might have been like right around the time that the cartoon series was starting.

203
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I mean, I definitely had the books as a kid, but I just thought that was great.

204
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:17,000
And then there was the Flight of Fear in Virginia was called the Outer Limits colon Flight of Fear.

205
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Even though like none of us had seen the flight of the Outer Limits in year.

206
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Like that wasn't like and this is a launch coaster for people.

207
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I'm right. Right. That's the one that takes off from zero to whatever.

208
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Oh, and it's got like an Asian 51 vibe to it.

209
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
But I remember like, yeah, all the paramount stuff coming up.

210
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I think there was also a Star Trek on ice. I seem to remember.

211
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
We have to figure that out.

212
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
We talked about somebody brought that up on another show, Star Trek on ice.

213
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
So we're going to have to do. We'll cover that.

214
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
But there's a lot less stuff about them.

215
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,000
There was a lot more things of like the Mason Dixon theater and there was a coaster called the Rebel Yell.

216
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
There's a lot more stuff that that name has been changed since now.

217
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
There was some regional appeal to. Yeah, there was some regional appeal.

218
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
But I also like looking back on this, realizing between this and Disney and Universal,

219
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
like I learned so much about movie studios as a kid.

220
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I was like the stuff I liked was like MGM and Universal and Paramount.

221
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:23,000
And I would like know who made like I was like, well, clearly these people made this movie and these people made this movie.

222
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
You knew about brand alliances and.

223
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,000
And yeah, and synergy and yeah, you were indoctrinated.

224
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Yeah, yeah. And you still are very fond of the Paramount brand specifically to this day.

225
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
And as a kid that the summers we would go to Kings Dominion.

226
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Like, I mean, I knew Disney and Universal were like the next level, but this I was also plenty happy with.

227
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Sure. This level of beaming and stuff.

228
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
And it's a thrill park. First and foremost.

229
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:54,000
It is about like giving getting up your your gumption to get on a crazy coaster.

230
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I mean, that is like the main draw.

231
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:04,000
So a little goes a long way with the story, because at least for me, this is like the park of my teen years.

232
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:11,000
When you don't care about the kiddie stuff, storybook land or nostalgia, you're living life on the very edge.

233
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Yeah, you also don't care about death because you live forever.

234
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Yes. And it was a perfect park for that time.

235
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Like I have so many all of my memories are tied to like walking around with groups of preteens,

236
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:32,000
which is a very different way to experience a park than going with your kids or even in your 30s and reliving what you think was great about your youth.

237
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Well, this is something I feel like every time we talk about one of these parks, inevitably the word horny shows up.

238
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Oh, because you're there when you're preteens because it's a local park.

239
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:50,000
So like when you're 15 years old, there's boys, there's girls, there's a whole element of like who are you going to see who?

240
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Our eighth grade graduation trip.

241
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:59,000
So the big reward of the combination of your K through eight experience was a coed trip to King's Island.

242
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
And that's the whole thing, because you're out, you're not in school, you're not in your parents house.

243
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Was coed not the note where you had a boys school and like it merged with the girls school?

244
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I guess by default, every experience was coed.

245
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:19,000
It wasn't a special, but notably. It seemed notable for the same things that Carlson's point out, which is just like, yeah, this was you were allowed,

246
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:24,000
you were still under total supervision, but you were allowed to kind of walk around the park somewhat freely.

247
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
And that was very different than the school norm. Sure.

248
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
It was akin to a dance with a thousand feet high roller coaster.

249
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Yeah, yeah. But you've been with your wife since you were both nine years old, correct?

250
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Yes, that's true. You didn't have time to.

251
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Honestly, that is true. What's the actual timeline?

252
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Most of my memories of those kind of pre-teeny teen trips were more about like just being mischievous.

253
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Like I remember an entire day of walking around the park because we had gotten on one of the log rides or not one of the log rides,

254
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:00,000
one of the rides that had a water element in the seat was wet, you know, and we thought that was annoying or whatever.

255
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
We started asking people how their butt water was.

256
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Just, you know, like walking up to people in a very prepubescent way just to get a rise out of people saying, how is your butt water?

257
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:15,000
And that's not funny now. I doubt it was that funny then. I disagree with that. I think that's funny.

258
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:23,000
It's a funny phrase. It was like the culmination of like a great teen mischievous experience.

259
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Harmless, stupid, confusing, confusing.

260
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Probably your most common response was, huh? Yeah, yeah, I think that was. And that was enough to get a pretty good laugh.

261
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:36,000
But what's the ideal reaction? Is it like a rumpthy lady like, my word.

262
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Right. I think you want an indignant response, if anything. I don't remember.

263
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Or to have somebody go to like a security guard and say, you know what these guys said about butt water,

264
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:53,000
can you have them removed from the park? And they're like, nah, man, anything goes here. And then he gives you beer.

265
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Yeah, that would be the supreme. Not in our wildest dreams did we think we could achieve it.

266
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:04,000
But yeah, I mean, Kings Island, the other thing that's notable about Kings Island is it does have an attached water park.

267
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:12,000
But what's what's unique here is that they're in direct competition with a giant water park across the road called the beach.

268
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:18,000
And the beach was an attraction like big enough unto itself to be worth the one hour drive for my family.

269
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:23,000
So like we never like equated the Kings Island trip with a water park trip.

270
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I mean, having to pack your wet swimsuit. That was a lot of my I remember my parents having to do the like, all right, we got to have a bag because they're going to have to put their bathing suits on and the dry clothes.

271
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:41,000
And then there's towels, right? Like, so so we always did one or the other.

272
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:46,000
But they had a great the theme song for Kings Island. This is really weird branding.

273
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:56,000
It was like a song, a jingle that was like in the 90s. It was like, come to the beach. Oh, it's easy to reach right across from the island.

274
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:01,000
The island was marketing while referencing the competitive.

275
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:07,000
That was the beaches pitch basically is we're right across from the other thing you really want to go to.

276
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:13,000
So just come here. Yeah. And now there's also now I don't know if this has replaced the beach or not, but it's replaced.

277
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Like there used to be a Kings Island Hotel, like a Kings Island in close by that they closed a few years ago.

278
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:24,000
And now they say like, maybe you should stay at the Great Wolf Lodge down the road, which is a combined.

279
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:31,000
We have one of those in. Yeah. In Orange County. It's a it is a indoor water park with a hotel built into it.

280
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Wow. It's kind of it is really crazy. Like, Ohio must be a natural magnet for this type of attraction.

281
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:48,000
It's landlocked. It's well, other than the Great Lakes, which are legit. But, you know, it just has that kind of easy to reach appeal for the region.

282
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Because Cedar Point is huge. Kings Island's huge. There's a lot of little parks like that.

283
00:21:52,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Yeah. Like kind of highway attraction level things that have just like survived the test of time because they don't have to compete probably the same way.

284
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Is there anything around there that gives you like an actual an actual beach like where would you go? Was it to a lake or two?

285
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Yeah, you could go to the Great Lakes in the summer, which is great.

286
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:17,000
It's like a very much a boating culture or a lot of people would hit like Virginia Beach, go, you know, go east down the Atlantic seaboard.

287
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:25,000
I mean, like for us, it was like we were either going down to Disney World and making a huge trip of it or like a lot of like Dollywood is not far.

288
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,000
That's that's Tennessee. So you had gone. I've been to Dollywood.

289
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Yeah, a lot of people have been to Dollywood.

290
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
What are your Dollywood feelings? It's great.

291
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:38,000
It's it's got a real smoky mountains theme, which like it sits in the Smoky Mountains.

292
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:43,000
So as you drive in, you're driving through like a natural preserve on a Tulane like cool road.

293
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:48,000
And there's like Black Bear themed things all over the place.

294
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
There's like an Alpine slide you can ride.

295
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:56,000
It's a it's a park in an actual cool part of the country that people wouldn't think to visit.

296
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
You know, it's it's like got a big natural appeal.

297
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
OK, actual natural. We'll be going.

298
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
We'll we have to take it. It's worth the trip.

299
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Yeah, but you can see that seem like I don't want to like say too much, but doesn't it seem like our best like shot in terms of like maybe like outreach?

300
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,000
We have got to put out a little bit of PR.

301
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Let's say this. A number of different people have offered us free things in regards to Dollywood.

302
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:26,000
That's all I'll say. Yeah, that's been our most progress so far.

303
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,000
We've tried to reach out to we've reached out to certain places of that have been more receptive than others.

304
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,000
I know I know some mutual friends have gone recently. You got to put this out into the world.

305
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Yeah. So people, if you're listening right now, call your friends, call Dolly herself.

306
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:44,000
If David Phillips is listening, let's just let's make this happen.

307
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,000
We talk about that on the air or make a whole episode.

308
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Yeah, we know somebody who got a birthday phone call from make this happen. Dolly Parton.

309
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Yeah, yeah. And her as a guest someday.

310
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,000
It just has to be one of our birthdays. I like a theme park and presario.

311
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,000
I mean, I like the idea that we would have her on and talk about just the theme park.

312
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Yeah, the movies. Just be like, well, what about the roller coaster?

313
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Were you in the design phase of the were you the one who was helping plan out what the layout of the park would be?

314
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,000
She was in like a 3D movie or something. I'd want you would have to devote 40 minutes to that.

315
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Yeah. Beats the crap out of Mr. King or whoever the hell that was.

316
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Yeah. Oh, yeah. I don't know. I don't know.

317
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:33,000
The Dolly Parton bringing this up reminded me of part of part of the founding of Kings Island was for one thing, Coney Island.

318
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:40,000
The this this older park used to be about 10 miles down the road from where Kings Island is now constantly flooded.

319
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Yeah. So they're like, well, we got to move.

320
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,000
We you know, people some of the board was like, oh, we should move this.

321
00:24:47,000 --> 00:25:02,000
And we were resistant to it. And then it was rumored that the actor Fess Parker, famous for playing Davy Crockett in the Disney miniseries slash movie and later on playing Daniel Boone, was going to open a park in Kentucky.

322
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,000
So they scrambled. So they scrambled. And they're like, oh, we got to all right. We got to move it.

323
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:15,000
And then, of course, the Fess Parker project fell apart. The money didn't materialize. But like there was almost another celebrity founded theme park in the region.

324
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:27,000
They probably played it right. I mean, they probably played it right because Newport and the area that that that the old park Coney Island was in on the river does flood a lot.

325
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Like in the history of the Ohio River, there's a lot of flooding.

326
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:41,000
And so they had like endless expansion room. And that's one of the things that's very well known about this park and why a lot of people think it has a higher ceiling than Cedar Point is they have room to grow.

327
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:46,000
So they like kind of constantly improve and expand in a way that some other parks can't.

328
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Oh, do they not? Yeah, because it really butts up to just wilderness. Yeah, it's pretty open.

329
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Do they own like all that? Or is there a hard boundary?

330
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:02,000
I don't know if there was a Walt Disney swamp buy up story, but I do know that like the beast.

331
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:08,000
So it's famous for being. Is it still the longest? Or no? I think so.

332
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Or maybe in the US, but not in the world. It's so hard. Like stuff loses it and then it's still noted at. But the longest in this region.

333
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:28,000
One of the longest wooden roller coasters in the world and one of the reasons it's great is because, you know, if you ride Thunder Mountain at Disney, it's a great ride, but you don't have many straightaways.

334
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Yeah, you know, to kind of build suspense and kind of just like enjoy your atmosphere.

335
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:51,000
But on the beast, you're going through a pretty woodsy area and have a lot of like wooden tunnels with like open planks. So it kind of creates this like really rustic, natural vibe that like is unique for no other reason than you can go into a wooded area.

336
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Yeah, you really feel like you're in the middle of nowhere. This is an idea.

337
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:59,000
This video I did at Funny or Die that was called Roller Coaster Safety with Patrick Warburg.

338
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:10,000
I don't think I've talked about on the show that was a real or it was a fake. It was like the pre-ride video for a fake ride that we got Patrick Warburton to be in of actual video Soren.

339
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:15,000
The level of nerd out to have our guy in one of the real video.

340
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:21,000
And he said like, you know, I'm in one of the real things. Like, fuck yeah. You think Patrick.

341
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,000
And then he walked away for half an hour and threatened to leave because of my attitude.

342
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
He's also on Star Tours.

343
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Oh, that's right. Yeah. Yeah. Which he revealed to me it hadn't opened yet and he whispered on the set like I did something for the new thing.

344
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
True Hollywood rumors.

345
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
That wasn't even out online. I got inside info for those couple months.

346
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
I felt pretty special I gotta say.

347
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
They pitched his voice up too. I don't think most people know it's him.

348
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:50,000
I don't think you. Yeah, there's not really a tell. He's the guy who's like looking through like he's like letting the security guy.

349
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Right. On Soren. Yeah. No, no, no. On Star Tours.

350
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Well, that's what he's doing in Soren basically.

351
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:00,000
They're different characters. Warburton in Soren.

352
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:07,000
He's more of like a military. He's a little calmer. He's a hero. He saved lives. The Soren guy.

353
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,000
And on Star Tours, he's kind of like, all right, move along. Move along there.

354
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:16,000
He's like a robot TSA. They pitched it up. So it's even more like move along. Move along.

355
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:22,000
It's his voice. A little bit of attitude. Keep going there. Keep going. Like that kind of.

356
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:30,000
I mean, what a what a cool claim to fame for Warburton. I mean, like what a it's it has more staying power than any other form of cameo.

357
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:38,000
I mean, more people see that per year than. Yeah, that's kind of he kind of is a nerd for that stuff from what I could tell.

358
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Like he does because sometimes you'll catch that actors I've probably watched every interview or like any any glimpse I can get of.

359
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Now you were in this ride and it really breaks my heart when an actor is like, yeah, I don't know.

360
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
That was a quick shoot and I don't remember and I heard I never went and visited it.

361
00:28:53,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Warburton, I think, cares. Here's a here's a fun tip for you. Ken Marino is you guys know what the hell might be trying.

362
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:06,000
I was like, did I even like the second I started to say it, of course they know they probably digested that whole episode.

363
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:11,000
We did an entire episode that hasn't come out yet. I'm not sure if it will have when maybe we'll have.

364
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,000
We have yet to decide. Yeah, I was I was on the ride last week.

365
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:20,000
This is the this is the rock and roller coaster roller coaster there, Smith.

366
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Oh, but I was starting to say the thing that inspired that I was like a like a scary, particularly odd, scary video for a ride that doesn't exist.

367
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:33,000
That like seems to go forever and be insanely dangerous.

368
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,000
And there's a joke in it about like part of it takes place across the US Canada border.

369
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:41,000
So you have like a mountie stops you and checks your passport.

370
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:51,000
And that was completely based on the Kings Island experience because there was a moment in the beast where I was like, I've been on this for half an hour, I feel.

371
00:29:51,000 --> 00:30:00,000
And we are so deep in the woods. If we like if you if you fell off the ride at that point, could you get back to civilization easily?

372
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:07,000
It is one of the few rides that you don't leave saying like, I like it's over before it started.

373
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:17,000
And one time I was there when it was pouring rain and we we just got in as many rides as we could and doubled up on the beast, which like they were letting people stay on.

374
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Yeah, which is just like that's a train ride.

375
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Yeah, a trip from here to San Francisco.

376
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,000
But it was like it is such a great it rattles you.

377
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:35,000
So like if if you're ever at the park and you are the type of person that gets doesn't like getting tossed around.

378
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,000
It's not the best ride, but it is like a classic.

379
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:44,000
My personal favorite ride, at least at the time, I think if I went back, the beast is probably what I try to get on first.

380
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:54,000
But is actually the Vortex, which is a looping like when it first opened, it was one of the most loops for for its type.

381
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
And it just feels fast.

382
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:01,000
It's like one of those rides where you're going the same speed you are on any other roller coaster.

383
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,000
But because you're feeling a little more geez and like twisting, it's so contained.

384
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
It feels like a speed coaster. Sure, sure.

385
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:16,000
And you know, that brings someone had asked us on Twitter recently, like why, why don't why do we think like smaller parks like this?

386
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Like we had done an episode on Hershey Park and why don't they have more like Disney style dark?

387
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Why don't they have more dark rides? Why do they have so many coasters?

388
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Because I don't really they didn't really like coasters.

389
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
They prefer more dark rides sort of thing.

390
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:34,000
And I think one of the reasons is that it's I mean, one, it's easier to build a roller coaster.

391
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:42,000
You can essentially buy it, quote unquote, off the shelf because companies that make these just have different models and you can build them just like it is.

392
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:50,000
But then you can also brag about like the most number of loops in New Jersey or like the fastest in the Northeast region.

393
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Like that helps the marketing and that appeals to like, you know, the team, the thrill seeking teams.

394
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:06,000
And that brings like, yeah, like Scott, you know, to the you appeal to the ultimate badasses like old Scott.

395
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:11,000
If they just had something called the super high horn ball, they'd have things covered.

396
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:17,000
And it would just be like, you know, like a horny ride that goes really high and really low.

397
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
More butt water per car.

398
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
And he really likes to work jokes.

399
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Everything on it slightly looks like a like as you go up the lift till it's like a lot of bananas with the apricots next to the base or the phallic phantom.

400
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:37,000
There's like a Cathy Ireland animatronic at the top waving to you.

401
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,000
That is for an audience of you.

402
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Oh, Cathy, people like everyone.

403
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Yeah, it's for the Pepsi generation.

404
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Yeah. Yeah.

405
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Yeah. That's that's good.

406
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:52,000
I remember her name getting said a lot when people were making a big show out of the fact that they like girls now.

407
00:32:52,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Like you would you'd see you wouldn't hear my memory was people on the playground not saying like, I got Cindy Crawford's really attractive to be like, oh, Cindy Crawford.

408
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Right. Like people had to put on these gigantic shows.

409
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:09,000
I think nobody knew what was going on for themselves either.

410
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
So there's a lot of projecting. Yeah.

411
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Yeah. So if I start shouting about this now, I'll be I'll defend myself from it.

412
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
I'll defend myself from the challenges of my peers.

413
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,000
I like that Cathy Ireland was like the hipster choice.

414
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Cindy Crawford, that's old man.

415
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
That's that's your dad's your dad's model.

416
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Cathy Ireland's our generation's model.

417
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
What is what was Cathy Ireland?

418
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Was she just known for being in magazines?

419
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Did she have a couple TV appearances, I recall.

420
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,000
But I think she I think she has like a whole line of clothing.

421
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Mary has a ceiling fan.

422
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
She really got in on like.

423
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
What?

424
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
She's a powerhouse.

425
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Yeah, she owns a lot of stuff.

426
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Ceiling fan.

427
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Worth more than you, Garen or back up.

428
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
She could be a Shark Tank shark.

429
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Absolutely.

430
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,000
The way they all own like six or seven different businesses and have shares in a million things.

431
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
I'll find a way to perfect the ceiling fan.

432
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
I'm coming for you, Cathy.

433
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Dave, did you ever ride The Son of Beast when it was briefly open?

434
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Yes, it did catch the very end of my years around Ohio and being able to have time and to do these kinds of things.

435
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:23,000
I didn't like it, so I was part of the popular opinion.

436
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,000
But it was like something to behold visually.

437
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Yeah, because to build that internal inverted loop that the scaffolding around it was like it just looked like a honeycomb of like wood planks.

438
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Like, yeah, it really is a unique architectural achievement, even if it was a failure as a ride.

439
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Yeah. So this was a wooden coaster sort of built like they made a big deal out of it.

440
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,000
It's like the sequel to the Beast, The Son of the Beast.

441
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
And it had a loop.

442
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
It was a wooden coaster with a loop in it.

443
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
First ever.

444
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
I think second ever.

445
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,000
But the previous one was so long ago.

446
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
This was like in modern memory.

447
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Too many people died for it to count.

448
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
You're probably not far off.

449
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,000
They never completed a full loop, so it didn't count because it didn't work.

450
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
They just fall.

451
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
It doesn't connect.

452
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,000
But yeah, but plagued with problems.

453
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Like not pleasant to ride.

454
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
It seemed like they changed the cars eventually.

455
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Later on, they found out there were some weird engineering problems where it was a miracle.

456
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,000
There was only a few accidents and no fatal accidents.

457
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Yeah, it really plays into the lore of the park, probably in the sense of it makes you wonder, is anybody watching what's going on here?

458
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Yeah.

459
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Oh, I was going to say that to bring back to Neil Armstrong that I found a quote from Neil Armstrong about the park, which is that he did not go on the Beast.

460
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:52,000
And when asked why, he said, when I went to the moon, I was in control.

461
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,000
You've got some 20 year old kid running that thing.

462
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
And I got to say, I agree.

463
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
That is very true.

464
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Although in this case, I did go on the Beast.

465
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,000
So you can call me braver than Neil Armstrong.

466
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Yes, but clearly I'm braver than Neil Armstrong.

467
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Would you have overlap with Son of Beast, Scott, on your visit?

468
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
It was there. I certainly did not go on that.

469
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Well, the funny thing, Jason Craig made me wrong, but it kept standing long after they shut it down.

470
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Yeah, it was still up for a while.

471
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
And they're like, oh, but next season.

472
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
How embarrassing.

473
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Yeah.

474
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:29,000
I think there was also like I watched, I think I watched there's a series called the Funkland that we like a lot.

475
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:40,000
And I think they talked about it like the people in Ohio in charge of like monitoring coasters or like it's either the parks and recreation people or like the fish and guava.

476
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,000
It's people who are not qualified to look at.

477
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,000
So like people would be like, yeah, I mean, the math works.

478
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Yeah, I guess it's OK.

479
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Like people just didn't know. And like as they were tearing it down, they're like, oh, yeah, some of this wood is not right.

480
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Or like things aren't.

481
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:11,000
I mean, building building the scaffolding out of wood in a in a region, the country gets a lot of water, a lot of rain, a lot of wind, you know, tornadoes does seem like you're daring God to kill a preteen already.

482
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Yes.

483
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
I died as he wished with a boner.

484
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:22,000
It's not the longest roller coaster anymore. That's that belongs to the Steel Dragon 2000.

485
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:28,000
OK, longest wooden, though, the longest was the longest wooden until they took the loop out when they reopened it.

486
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,000
And now I think California Screamin might be technically the longest one.

487
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
See, that's the thing, though, about like the roller coaster.

488
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
People are so mad right now that we don't know this.

489
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Well, it's the same thing with height of buildings, you know, if you had the antenna all of a sudden.

490
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Yeah.

491
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Sears towers and doesn't count.

492
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,000
These building fights, speaking of I'm sorry, I didn't mean to say what I was going to say.

493
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
It is very hard to keep straight at this.

494
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,000
I feel like there used to be a clear what it was in Paris State Building now.

495
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
It's and then it became Sears Tower.

496
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
I don't know. It's some Dubai thing now.

497
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
I don't know what it is.

498
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
And they keep adding to dads.

499
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,000
They got to get the tallest building thing that was great.

500
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
One thing's for sure.

501
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,000
It is not the Eiffel Tower at Kings Island, which is an attraction.

502
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Yes.

503
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:14,000
When you walk in a replica, quote unquote replica, you see the picture, it's not really a replica.

504
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
It's a third size is what I saw.

505
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,000
My wife didn't know much about this park and that that part really confused her.

506
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Why is there an Eiffel Tower?

507
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
There's one in Virginia, too.

508
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,000
I think there's one at Carowinds, maybe.

509
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Probably that European eclectic vibe of like you can't have a castle, you know, this is fun.

510
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Yeah, there's International Street.

511
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,000
There's a bunch of fountains, you know, international style fountains.

512
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Is it the same theory, like the same thinking that Michael Eisner had when he wanted to open Disney's MGM studios?

513
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:47,000
We're like, if we just build a studio here, no one's going to go to Universal Studios.

514
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:51,000
So they were like, well, no one needs to go to Paris now that we have our own.

515
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
We have our own just as good one.

516
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
It's the New York, New York theory in Vegas.

517
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Yeah, yeah.

518
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
We got it all right here.

519
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Basically, how's their Eiffel Tower stack up?

520
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
That's got to be bigger.

521
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,000
That's got to be bigger and closer because the late.

522
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:07,000
The one the Kings Island one kind of looks like it's made of Legos or something.

523
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Yeah, but it is a good view of the park.

524
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
All of these things have their charm.

525
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Like I know they I was just reading that they redid like the turnstile entrance just to have a better signage.

526
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
And I was like, oh, my gosh, is it going to be really nice?

527
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,000
And it was like, no, it was just a sensible update.

528
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:26,000
You know, like they don't waste money where it doesn't have entertainment value.

529
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
And I kind of love that.

530
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:33,000
I mean, Disney has a luxury to fail, you know, and like invest a lot of money in certain details.

531
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:40,000
These parks to survive and to keep them at like a non cost prohibitive level for the average family.

532
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Like they make the right move.

533
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:45,000
They buy like these prefabbed awesome rides.

534
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
So it's admirable.

535
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
The thriftiness of it.

536
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Yeah, that's why I like in a park.

537
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
A good thrifty appeal.

538
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:57,000
The other thing is a lot of these parks in colder parts of the country don't operate year round.

539
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:02,000
They're usually like, you know, end of April, middle of April to October, maybe.

540
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,000
And maybe they looks like Kings Island sometimes has done.

541
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Yeah. Winterfest like open around Christmas.

542
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Hershey Park did this.

543
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Some of the Six Flags maybe do it.

544
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Yeah, I went to Winterfest once, at least I remember.

545
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:21,000
And they would basically just put up some temporary tents around the park, like kind of heated tents.

546
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
I can't remember.

547
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,000
There's probably like a lighting display and stuff in some of the area.

548
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:29,000
But the most memorable thing, again, I was probably 10.

549
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:34,000
But there was a guy singing in one of the tents, like a novelty act.

550
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:39,000
And he put on a Rasta hat and sang Jingle Bells.

551
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:43,000
And the only difference was that he added mon at the end of everything.

552
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
It was the most culturally appropriated junk of all time.

553
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,000
It was just Jingle Bells mon, Jingle Bells mon, Jingle all the way mon.

554
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:55,000
And me and my 10 year old white bread friend thought that was the funniest performance of all time.

555
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:59,000
And when I think about it now, I probably like went home and sang it to friends at school.

556
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Yeah, you absolutely did. Sure.

557
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
What a friggin loser.

558
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:10,000
A young Adrian Brody saw it and gave him an idea for his SNL musical guest intro.

559
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
That's a very obscure reference.

560
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
I know what you're talking about.

561
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,000
If anybody hasn't seen, look up Adrian Brody.

562
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Who's he introducing? Sean Paul. Perfect.

563
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:23,000
He's introducing a reggae band. So he decided to do this lengthy...

564
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
They told him not to do it.

565
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:30,000
And just like all this nonsense. And then he... Oh, did they tell him not to do it?

566
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Yeah, they told him not to. He said, I want to do my reggae band character.

567
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:37,000
I want to do like a reggae guy character. They're like, no, please don't. And then he went and did it anyway.

568
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Brody's like a hard band. Yeah, he's a hard band from doing that. Yeah.

569
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Did he like hide the hat and the wig somewhere and then...

570
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,000
He must have. That's a good point. He had to secure it somehow.

571
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:57,000
So unless the wardrobe department got clearance to do so, he like drove over to a 99 cent store in Manhattan.

572
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Oh, yeah. Maybe they never had the wig at all. And that was the quality of it from what I recall.

573
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,000
It was like what you'd buy from a costume store. So he kept that in the room.

574
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Like when Sacha Baron Cohen snuck Ollie G into the Oscars.

575
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:16,000
It's the same thing. Yeah. A beloved, two beloved characters making a surprise appearance on TV.

576
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Did he put it all in a backpack? He had him in his pocket.

577
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Like I think his wife had like it in a purse or something and then she had to like sneak it to him before he went up there.

578
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Oh, man. Were you working for the movie awards when one that was not fated that Bruno crash landed on...

579
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:37,000
I actually did not work on that year. Oh, I thought you did. I worked the year right after.

580
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,000
OK, so we were there for the fallout. It was being discussed.

581
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:44,000
It was like the Jimmy Kimmel. There were the Warren Beatty envelopes.

582
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Like never again. We security on high alert for comical Europeans.

583
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Was Bruno falling on Eminem? Yeah. Wasn't that scripted though? Wasn't that planned?

584
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Jason, how could you dare make such a claim?

585
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:02,000
There's only one person here who would truly know the inside.

586
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Although you were there at the time. I was only there for the fallout.

587
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:10,000
At that point, the rumor mill was in full effect. The cover up was on.

588
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Mr. MTV himself had shut it down.

589
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:20,000
No, I don't know the full details. I know the people who would. But they're not here. We're dead to us.

590
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:26,000
They're in protective custody. They can't share this information.

591
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:33,000
I'm not sure if the timeline overlapped in this, but that was all owned by Viacom, who owned these parks at the time.

592
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:37,000
They could have made a ride based on Bruno dangling down.

593
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Actually, they would have owned the rides. It could have been a stunt show.

594
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Oh, yeah. A great stunt show. Like a Bruno Mars.

595
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Actually, that would be a much more popular stunt show.

596
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:55,000
But really, a Sacha Baron Cohen character themed stunt show. I'm on board.

597
00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:02,000
If you could get every character from the Cohen versus Bruno, you get the general, you get Borat.

598
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:09,000
I mean, of course, because the crowd work would be amazing because you get like a local higher version of Sacha Baron Cohen.

599
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:16,000
If you held auditions at an Ohio theme park for who would play Borat, there would be a line of twenty thousand.

600
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Everyone in the state would audition for it. Young, funny, old, female females open to that.

601
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Absolutely. Why not? It's totally blind casting.

602
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Fanning down the lot that endless line, longer than the beast itself.

603
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Yeah. Murmuring, my wife, my wife, my wife.

604
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Three people for each character too. Wouldn't be the same person playing all the roles.

605
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Absolutely. You're going to see a lot of those baby blue Borat suits in that line, though.

606
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Right. But you'll see some Bruno. You'll see some Molly G's.

607
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Bruno's Borat suit isn't baby blue. It's kind of blue, right?

608
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Oh, here comes a fight. Oh, I don't know. I don't know.

609
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:59,000
My role is the riff of the pod. That local casting, I know it's a thing you guys have covered occasionally,

610
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:03,000
but Scott was nice enough in my little walk down memory lane.

611
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:08,000
He sent me a 25th anniversary special that P. Island financed. Oh, my God.

612
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:12,000
So, Jason Priestley is the talent. Yeah.

613
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:18,000
And what the segue here for me was that he runs into a number of actors from the park.

614
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,000
And one of them is an approximation of Doc Brown,

615
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:25,000
but it's completely unlicensed and played by like a 14 year old.

616
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Well, he also was like talking about a lot of Ghostbusters stuff.

617
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:34,000
It was like a Doc Brown outfit and just mixing in Ghostbusters like Phantasmagoric, like slime.

618
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:39,000
But it didn't make any... Was he walking around the park or was that just for the special?

619
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:44,000
I'll have you know, I watched the entire thing and I never made heads or tails

620
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:48,000
of whether these were actual pre-existing Kings Island characters that he was running to

621
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,000
or if they were written for the narrative of the special.

622
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:55,000
But basically, the theme that they went with is it's a 25th celebration.

623
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Jason is interacting with real kids throughout the park that have snuck in with him on a day that it's closed.

624
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:08,000
And he is kind of infiltrated.

625
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:13,000
His mission is infiltrated by these secret agents that look like the Blues Brothers.

626
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Yeah, but there's more than two of them. There's four Blues Brothers.

627
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:22,000
And they're with the Park Aficionado Committee or something.

628
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:26,000
Well, this is what's weird to me. They were with ACE, the American Coaster Enthusiasts.

629
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,000
Which is real.

630
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Which is a real organization, but they don't... They're just people who like coasters and wear normal clothes.

631
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:37,000
I'm not quite sure why they made them look like sinister men in black.

632
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:42,000
I think the answer to your question of why is that this was likely written by a park employee.

633
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
That's the feeling it had to me.

634
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:49,000
They were like, we have maybe 20 grand to spend on this big blowout.

635
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,000
We're going to get Priestley and the rest is on us.

636
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,000
Yes.

637
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Now, why Priestley? Was he a...

638
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Biggest name who would say yes, maybe. Teen Heartthrob.

639
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Who the teens were the most horny for.

640
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Was he from the area though?

641
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
No, I looked that up too. He's a Canadian.

642
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Oh, yeah, yeah.

643
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:12,000
That's what I thought. But maybe he had a trip to Kings Island.

644
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Or was he a random hire?

645
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
I think he was legitimately hot at the time.

646
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,000
So he probably was an attention getter.

647
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:24,000
And I don't know if that... It's a YouTube video now, but I don't know if it was a regional broadcast on paid television or...

648
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,000
Must have been like a local TV thing.

649
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Look, I'll correct you. I'll say it was the 20th anniversary.

650
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:34,000
If you look it up on YouTube, although we'll post it and probably post clips from it.

651
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:39,000
But yeah, the Kings Island 20th anniversary special from 1992, which to me...

652
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:46,000
I think this whole thing elevates Kings Island for me that they had an idiotic 90s TV special.

653
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
It's been, again, my favorite...

654
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
You like that better than the park sometimes.

655
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Oh, yeah, yeah. I put a lot more time into watching these things and archiving moments from them than going to places.

656
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:02,000
So yeah, is this the only non-Disney Universal park to have a special of this nature with little skits?

657
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
No, there's no way.

658
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:07,000
It was great. I really did enjoy it. I thought I was going to watch 30 seconds and I kept going.

659
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:12,000
I'm so glad. Well, I want to highlight another moment from that, which is that...

660
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,000
So if there is a loose...

661
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Well, you described one of the loose plots, which is the Blues Brothers men magically appearing on the coasters,

662
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:25,000
but also the Doc Brown ripoff guy who you mentioned with a big hat full of doodads on it.

663
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:30,000
He's talking about particle disturbances that are happening in the park.

664
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
And I don't know why that day in particular...

665
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:37,000
The little digital tornadoes that have just been loosely animated across the screen.

666
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Yeah, yeah. Looks like a lot of gifts.

667
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
That happens a number of times.

668
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Yes, which culminating in a very strange section where Jason Priestley is talking to kids about what animals they like.

669
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:56,000
And then he just casually says, I've always wanted to be a giraffe. Next line, oh no, Jason, look out.

670
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:04,000
The kid points behind him. He looks, bizarre close up of just his eyes as the swirl that we saw in one scene prior.

671
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,000
The digital tornado.

672
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:15,000
The digital tornado heads towards him. It engulfs him, then drops him off in a different area where he is human, but quickly morphs into a giraffe.

673
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
Into a giraffe in the safari park.

674
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:21,000
And I promise you on our Twitter a GIF that I've made already, or a GIF.

675
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
Oh, great. It's an achievement, CGI.

676
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Go to our Twitter if you want to see Jason Priestley anamorphing into a giraffe.

677
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:37,000
I wrote down some of those kids' lines. Some of those kids' lines were pretty... One of the kid goes, there goes his career.

678
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,000
Yes.

679
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,000
And then the other kid goes, oh, he was going to be in movies.

680
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Yes, which is like a very savvy Hollywood joke.

681
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Yeah, both are pretty good. So I'm like, wait, were the writers there feeding kids lines?

682
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Definitely.

683
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Maybe.

684
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:57,000
No, I was wondering if Jason Priestley's feeding them lines.

685
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:02,000
I want to say Jason was more checked out than you're giving him credit for.

686
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Yeah, I have to think there were some writers... Because then there's some weird mugging later on where he's like, get out here, wise guy.

687
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Why is he doing that? That's like a comedy writer go to his old timey afferism.

688
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:24,000
It reminds me a lot of John Stamos on Full House would do a lot of like, it's some weird like several steps from Stooges.

689
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:35,000
I will say he seemed to be a good sport. There's one memorable moment in the video where he's riding the racer with a young volunteer and they didn't pre-screen the young volunteer and the kid is terrified.

690
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:45,000
He looks like he's like trying to hide from the ride and Jason kind of puts his arm around him and like cheers him up like while still like playing the scene the way it was planned.

691
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:59,000
So, you know, he won some points. And at the end, the end of the video says promotional considerations or travel considerations and lodgings provided by and the hotel they show as his lodgings is the most adorable like budget in.

692
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:05,000
They show the room like the interior of the room and it's like he made a sacrifice to make a couple bucks.

693
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Yeah, he they also gave a shout out to the local RV company that rented his dressing for his dressing room trailer.

694
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Oh yeah, Jason Prucey's trailer provided by. They used to do that I feel like they would say like trailer provided by. I've seen that before.

695
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:33,000
It's very charming. Yeah, you could tell they made a special effort to elevate their production situation to this Hollywood person. The charm that is imbued in every part of this park is evident there.

696
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:50,000
But you know, it's funny because like as much as people dig on Midwest stuff, it always does bug me because like that's kind of a unique experience in the Midwest is like priestly legitimizing your park. There's nothing crappy about that.

697
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:57,000
That's that's great. That's a coup for the park. There's a coup for the RV company and that local hotel establishment. And the Midwest in general.

698
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:03,000
Yeah, the Midwest in general. It's a win-win. It's a coup for me to watch 26 years later.

699
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:10,000
There's some there's to you reference some a little bit. I accidentally did in the 70s when it was still owned by who was the original owner?

700
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:18,000
Taft Broadcasting. That's how they had the the Hanna-Barbera license and I believe the Smurf license because the Smurfs were present in the park very early on.

701
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:27,000
Right. They also got crossovers. There's a Brady Bunch episode and a Partridge Family episode, both very similarly premised.

702
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:35,000
Yes. What is the Partridge Family one? Because I know Brady Bunch. Oh, sorry. Go ahead. Oh, no, you if you don't make it up wrong.

703
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:43,000
I have the thing here. They're traveling performers, so they're performing at the park is the basics. It's less torture to get them there.

704
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:52,000
The Brady Bunch is he got the engineering job to do a design at the park. So he's flying the whole family to Cincinnati and they have this whole moment of like, we're going to Cincinnati.

705
00:52:52,000 --> 00:53:02,000
Oh, yeah, it's a real shit on Cincinnati. And then when he explains what's up because we get to go to a big theme park, then the reaction is like, oh, cool.

706
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:13,000
It's still like a B plus enthusiasm from the family and both. Coincidentally, there's a B story where the young male member of the family falls for a local.

707
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Keith meets the public relations host. Keith has a crush on her, says the IMDb.

708
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:30,000
Yep. Oh, wait, I flipped through it and I think Keith is pretending he is older than he is. And there's a part where he demands wine and Shirley Jones gives him the stink eye because he's not old enough to drink wine.

709
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:35,000
There you go. This is the stuff of amusement. The Partridge family episode was called I Left My Heart in Cincinnati.

710
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:41,000
The Brady Bunch episode was called the Cincinnati Kids on the notable events part of the Wikipedia.

711
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:47,000
It seems like the Brady Bunch kids would come back a few times just to entertain.

712
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:53,000
They did a show. A few of them did a show a few years ago there.

713
00:53:53,000 --> 00:54:01,000
Yes, 2008 and 2013. Barry Williams and Susan Olson and then Christopher Knight was with them in 2013.

714
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:05,000
But then Mike Lookin, Lookinland was with them in 2008.

715
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:11,000
And do we know why? Singing some songs, telling some stories. Do you know why? Because Ohio loved them.

716
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Of course. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And treated them really.

717
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:25,000
Although so I for this I stopped on the way here. I stopped at the library and looked at a copy of one of the great literature texts available at the library.

718
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Growing up Brady, Barry Williams book, which is a very good book.

719
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:35,000
But the he goes in depth into their the Brady's experience at Kings Island.

720
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:42,000
And at the time, similar to what you were saying about Priestley having modest lodging options,

721
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:49,000
there was only one hotel remotely near Kings Island at the time and it was called like Kings Island Lodge or something.

722
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:55,000
And it didn't take much for the Ohio natives to put two and two together and go, well, that's where the Brady's must be.

723
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
So all of the kids. Yeah.

724
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:03,000
The like everybody had to deal with like the bathroom window, like people pressing up against the glass.

725
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Everybody the Brady's were all trapped. Essentially, there were just people with their kids or not with their kids.

726
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Something happened to the munchkins when they were shooting Wizard of Oz and Culver City.

727
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:18,000
All the creepy Culverians kept bugging them. Yeah.

728
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:24,000
So like people are just not like knocking on the door and then like there was a lot of tension between the Brady's and the people in the park

729
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:30,000
because they did not pay to have extras fleshing out the the background of the scene.

730
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:38,000
So it's just regular people in the parks who have to deal with the shooting, who have to be told, do not stare at the camera, do not stare at the Brady's.

731
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:45,000
And the kids got like the kids got to cut in line and go on everything.

732
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:51,000
They just got to walk straight on everything. But like people started screaming at like you Hollywood assholes.

733
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:56,000
Like people would like, wow, my brain. So there was actually so maybe the Ohio did not love the Brady.

734
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,000
They do now. Well, they went back to the day. Yeah.

735
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:04,000
They like it was fun enough. They wanted they wanted to make sure they knew where they you know, they want to put them in their place.

736
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:09,000
Really? We're from this is not where you're from. We're from here. We're all people.

737
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:14,000
There's no lines in the eyes of the Lord. Yeah. No cutting in line.

738
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:27,000
The other big part of the Brady Bunch lore, the blower of the Cincinnati kids is that they all went on the racer and as in Robert Reid refused to go on the ride.

739
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:34,000
Again, I'm in a great lineup of great Robert Reid and first man on the moon, Neil Armstrong. Yeah.

740
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:38,000
Well, this is a ride that goes to the they didn't die because they were for 80 cats.

741
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:43,000
They just it's a pretty tame ride all in all. It does go forwards and backwards.

742
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:47,000
So it was unique in that way. And it is a Coney Island holdover.

743
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:50,000
It's one of the original. OK. And it's kind of. Yeah.

744
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:54,000
And it's it's two tracks parallel tracks. You're racing each other. Yeah.

745
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:59,000
At the time, a very unique cool idea in the equivalent ride in King's Dominion.

746
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:03,000
The name has since changed, but for a long time was called the Rebel Yell.

747
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Oh, no. Yeah. Is it the racer now? I don't know if it's the racer now.

748
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:14,000
It is something more generic. I get I read that it's credited with reviving interest in roller coasters in the 70s.

749
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:19,000
Probably bullshit, too. I came across that fact. Oh, I know.

750
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:24,000
I actually it was more of a divergent. I want to hear. Uh huh.

751
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:28,000
Do you think that this theme park podcast could cover the Branson show?

752
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:31,000
70s music celebration starring Barry Williams.

753
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:35,000
Do you think we go in percent? Right. We should as one of the makers of the rules.

754
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
You guys disagree. No, I of course.

755
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:40,000
I that was a question I knew the answer to. I just have a question.

756
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:44,000
Do guests have veto power? Do you host?

757
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:47,000
If not, no one's forcing you to listen, Dave.

758
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:52,000
If enough guests, let's say 30 guests veto all veto.

759
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:55,000
So strongly about that. We'll think about not doing it.

760
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:59,000
You know how my eyes glaze over sometimes when we go down classic rock rabbit holes.

761
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:03,000
Could you imagine if that happens for 90 minutes? Yeah.

762
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
Well, you're against it. You are.

763
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:12,000
You're first of all, it's weird that you're against it. Second of all, when you're saying classic rock, this Barry Williams show,

764
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:15,000
I don't even know if we're getting into the territory of classic rock.

765
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:20,000
Jackson extrapolate if he's bored. If we talk about the Rolling Stones, he would be probably even more bored.

766
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:24,000
Everyone, this looks good. There's a whole there's so many different trailers.

767
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:29,000
He does all the Brady Bunch hits. He does some like newer songs.

768
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:36,000
Does he do the real Greg Brady parody of the real Slim Shady, our second Eminem reference of the episode?

769
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
Let me look up the set list. Do you remember when he did that?

770
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:44,000
Have you ever seen he performed at a Vegas award show and like he did a parody of what Eminem had done at the VMAs

771
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:49,000
where a tub ton of Greg Brady's are all walking into the MGM Grand together?

772
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:54,000
I have. Yes, that's it's very stupid. That is such a leap.

773
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:58,000
They've heard a very specific Eminem performance.

774
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:02,000
Yeah. Why am I talking about all the Eminem MTV?

775
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:06,000
Yeah, he had a lot of great moment triumph when he hit triumph in the in the aisle.

776
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:09,000
Yes, I have a while Mike is finding this.

777
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
There is a moment of the Jason Priestley special.

778
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:17,000
I wanted to bring up at one point that the animated tornado turns Jason Priestley into a kid.

779
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:21,000
Yes. And he goes to a local bar. Yeah. Played by a little boy.

780
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:26,000
And he says, I want a cherry slushy and a brownie on whole wheat. Hold the mustard.

781
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:30,000
So I replay that like three times because I was trying to figure out the McKendrick.

782
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:34,000
That seems that guy. That's like a old comedy writer.

783
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:37,000
Joe is like a kid. The kid orders a deli sandwich.

784
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:41,000
Wouldn't that be funny? But it's like, wait, a brownie on bread.

785
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:44,000
Like children know what sandwiches are. Children don't.

786
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:48,000
It's a layer joke. But here's my theory on the whole thing.

787
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:54,000
It was written by the same person that writes their comedy shows at the park

788
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:59,000
because it had a lot of those like kind of like witty punny jokes

789
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:04,000
where you're like, you just tried just too much just for that one joke.

790
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:07,000
It's funny because I do wonder.

791
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:12,000
I was looking up if any famous people got their start on a job at Kings Island.

792
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:17,000
And it's pretty good. It's Carmen Electra was a dancer. Yep. Nick, if you're listening.

793
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:23,000
Sure. Nick Lachey was a singer. Woody Harrelson was a wood carver.

794
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:27,000
And Dan Patrick worked at the golf course. So Dan Patrick.

795
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:30,000
Wow. That's pretty good. Well, Dan Patrick's from Dayton.

796
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:37,000
But still, most of these are from Cincinnati. That is a pretty good ratio for a park in the middle of the country.

797
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:43,000
I wonder if any writers. So if you're listening out there and you know some other comedy writers,

798
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:52,000
has anyone made the jump from writing for the equivalent of Bill and Ted's stage show or, you know, the Golden Horseshoe show?

799
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:55,000
Have they ever made the jump to screenwriting?

800
01:00:55,000 --> 01:01:02,000
I found out recently my friend John Flynn used to be long time UCB main stage.

801
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:07,000
John Flynn was in the rock and roll. I think it was the rock and roll show at Hershey Park one summer.

802
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:14,000
There you go. Like a bunch of like a bunch of other like theater theater kids,

803
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:20,000
theater college students he was with all lived together and did the rock show at Hershey Park.

804
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:26,000
I will shout out within the tour guide program of which I was one. Paul Feig also a universal tour guide.

805
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:34,000
Whoa. Yeah, that's pretty big. That's going to be one of the biggest like like legit writer director forces from from that weird job.

806
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:45,000
Yeah, that's huge. Uh huh. I have a follow up question to yours, Dave, which is, is it possible for somebody who has written for television to make the leap to write for theme park shows?

807
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:50,000
That's a much better way to frame it. Can anyone give me a specific email address of someone to ask for a job?

808
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:55,000
Because you'd like to mimic their career. I would like to I would like to go the opposite way if possible. Yeah, I hear you.

809
01:01:55,000 --> 01:02:06,000
I cannot find a set list, but I did find a picture on Facebook of Barry Williams loving the Wright Cycle Company complex at the Carillon Historical Park in Dayton, Ohio.

810
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:14,000
Another great example of a local park. This one's a heritage museum. Carillon Park is like the Dayton History Park.

811
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:21,000
I know it sounds lame, guys, but they got a right B flyer and the cash register was invented there. So what more do you want?

812
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:31,000
Wow. You just pulled up a Facebook photo and this is a good I'm glad you have not deleted Facebook as many people have done because then you're missing out on stuff like that.

813
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:39,000
Yeah, that's true. The troops of the elite. Yeah, look, don't don't say all my kind.

814
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:44,000
The proud the rebels in this. Thank you for your service. You're very welcome.

815
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:53,000
Follow your tangent just for the moment. So did you delete it because of the data breach concern? Because if that's the case, you're dumb.

816
01:02:53,000 --> 01:03:03,000
If you delete it because you now had a reason that people wouldn't question, then I get it. Well, to be totally fair, I was probably not using it a ton.

817
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:15,000
Yes, the truth will say if it truly was part if it was if Facebook was still important to me and a part of my daily activity, I probably would not have been able to make the sacrifice.

818
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:22,000
But the fact that it had been whittled down to a lot of riff raff and stuff, I didn't want to see anyway. I think that's the moment we're at.

819
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:28,000
People aren't ready to defend Facebook anymore because they don't care. Yes. Hey, here's a good. It's a very easy cut to make.

820
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:36,000
And I'm one of them, but I just think that is the reason. Did you do it? Did you quietly? No, I haven't. I will happily. I'll do it right now. Join me.

821
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:44,000
I would like to do it right now. Carlson's ready. What are you going to podcast first? How are you going to top seeing Barry Williams in an old plane?

822
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:51,000
Well, you might be the first to do this picture of Barry Williams in a tie dyed shirt with Jimmy JJ Walker. Maybe what a way to go out.

823
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:58,000
If that's the last thing you see on Facebook, your final like is to like that, like it and then delete your account. And then we watch you do it right here and now.

824
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:01,000
I'll do it. Here we go. Are you really doing it? This is great. Heroes. I'll hit like.

825
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:08,000
We can be heroes. How do you delete Facebook right here? Do we go to settings? Mike could be king.

826
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:16,000
This is only a manager. You might need to get a Virg article or a Wired article to do this. Scott did it. Tell me how to do it. It's in your settings.

827
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:23,000
Oh, well, yeah, it's a little confusing because there's one thing to deactivate, but delete is a different thing and they make the delete link harder to find.

828
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:30,000
Just get this because this will be a podcast first. I don't any other podcasters have deleted their Facebook on the air yet.

829
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:42,000
Yeah, John Favreau. So can you get a Matt Carlson commitment that by the end of today, by the time this posts, will you no longer have a Facebook account?

830
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:47,000
By the time this post? Yeah, sure. I think that's like, I'll delete it. We got a lot of episodes.

831
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:51,000
So I'd be like two months. Yeah. Yeah. This is all to this may not come out.

832
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:57,000
So we made we just may say, hey, this wasn't as good. Let me because we were talking about heritage.

833
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:00,000
Nice place is heritage.

834
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:05,000
Thanks. The only theme park that I know of that has a cemetery in the parking lot.

835
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:12,000
The Dog Street Cemetery. What? Yeah. Dates back to 1803.

836
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:18,000
The Warren County Genealogical Society documented nearly 70 grave sites in the cemetery.

837
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:30,000
It was like a ghost hunters episode. Yeah. And there is a ghost hunters episode called Roller Ghoster where they investigate haunted occurrences in and around the park and cemetery.

838
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:38,000
Most notably a ghost they call Missouri Jane. Oh, that's where they know Jade.

839
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:49,000
It's funny because I have not visited the cemetery site. I did ride the Kings Island equivalent of haunted mansion, which rips off a lot of kind of like elements.

840
01:05:49,000 --> 01:06:01,000
Boo Blasters. Yeah. What a haunted theater briefly called Haunted Theater. Before that was Smurfs Enchanted Voyage. Before that was a just a weird copyright free Enchanted Voyage.

841
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:08,000
Yeah. It's like HR. I want to get this name right now. Now it's called Boo Blasters on Boo Hill.

842
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:15,000
I wonder if they have any winks in there like the way Disney has nods to past animators and stuff.

843
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:27,000
Some little like nods. There's a dead Smurf body somewhere. I think the ghosty guy that played the organ in Phantom Theater shows up in Boo Blaster.

844
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:35,000
Hey, all right. That's good. But is that just saving on robot? Probably saving on robot. I think this was also a Scooby Doo themed.

845
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:46,000
And then that was one of the last things he yanked out. Wow. And now it's Boo Blasters on Boo Hill made by the Sally Corporation, who also made Knights and White Satin the trip.

846
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:59,000
No kidding. Hey. Well, that'll probably avert. Yeah. A ride based on Knights and White Satin at the foreclosed Hard Rock theme park, which we get into a little bit.

847
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:07,000
You know, one advantage that a place like Kings Island maybe has on Disney. You know, I've heard you guys talk before about like refilling the park. How do you keep the energy alive?

848
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:14,000
Yeah. Kings Island is going to go through enough owners in its history and enough entertainment franchises that they have no choice but to rebrand.

849
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:21,000
Yeah. It's kind of interesting. I remember they had a Nickelodeon themed kids area when I was last there and that's gone.

850
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:31,000
Yep. Yeah. Now they have a show that I sent to you guys. I don't think I passed this to you. I need to check my notes because it's a complicated name. I don't want to get it wrong.

851
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:45,000
The show is called Nickelodeon's Mega Messamania, which I think was a show that was on tour throughout this nation of ours that eventually settled and had a in one place theatrical run at Kings Island.

852
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:57,000
And a residency like Barry Williams. And the there's just there's a clip of this that I'd like to play rather than describing the plot.

853
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:08,000
I think the only thing I have to do to set this up is that I'm looking at a lady in a very like the Nickelodeon mom, like the bizarre grotesque Buffon wig.

854
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:18,000
Kind of like Edie McClurg a little bit. Yes, like a super like an exaggerated caricature of actress Edie McClurg, who helped the principal and Ferris Bueller.

855
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:27,000
So she kind of and she's wearing regular size glasses and not a fat suit. For those of you who haven't pulled up.

856
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:38,000
I'm accurate. So she kind of explains the plot with the help of the character who she introduces.

857
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:03,000
I have everything under control. Problem could be slimed astrophys.

858
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:13,000
This is again, anyone who has the means for me to convert from being an attempted comedy writer to being a slime ologist at a slime related theme park show.

859
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:22,000
Please give me the context if you can. We should say that that character, the mom character's name is Gackmeister Darla Boog Air.

860
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:28,000
So just so you know, it actually took me a few seconds.

861
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:32,000
And now what's that? What nationality is that? What region is that from?

862
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:45,000
Amazing. Yeah, this this special this this show was really something sent us this video and never have I seen a video, a special sell you so hard on you can buy this.

863
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:55,000
Oh, wow. This is actually being filmed and you can buy a broadcast of what you were watching. You'll notice this shot in a multi cam way and you could be in the show.

864
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:59,000
You might end up on the stage so that you could watch it at home like a Nickelodeon show.

865
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:06,000
But you're the star because there's about five minutes opening credits where they cut to audience members with like funny text underneath.

866
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:09,000
The people are laughing when they realize they're on screen.

867
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:16,000
And you could listen out of the thought of being a part of your favorite. And I guess, you know, people buy their own karaoke videos.

868
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
Yeah. Yeah. This is in a hard stretch.

869
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:25,000
This too made a point of telling you that it's like we have 50 VHS machines recording this backstage.

870
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:36,000
So rather than just record it on one and make copies as needed, they just record it 50 at a time because they could just there would be like losing no money if they just threw all 50 away.

871
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:40,000
Yeah, it would not be over them. Yeah, that's true. Good point.

872
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:46,000
That's probably the son of beast was built out of discarded VHS tapes.

873
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:53,000
That is that's a fun nostalgic romp. What a good show. I recommend the entire 45 minute show.

874
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
It's a little harder to get through maybe than that.

875
01:10:55,000 --> 01:11:02,000
Also, I just I cranked the volume. I went into Adobe Premiere and cranked the volume on what I just played and it was still very quiet.

876
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:08,000
Yeah, but I'm sure in the moment seeing the show, it was an in your face, slime testicle event. Sure.

877
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:12,000
If you have a VHS of this, let us know. Send us the people.

878
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:18,000
Oh, yeah. Somebody was probably on. Yeah, I that's something I might be able to help if I pull Cincinnati kids.

879
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:23,000
Yeah, not the ones from the show, but the ones from my life in terms of licensing turnover.

880
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:32,000
One of my favorite details is so in the Nickelodeon area, there was a wild Thornberry themed log flume.

881
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:39,000
And when Cedar Fair took over Cedar Fair, of course, in their parks like Knott's Berry Farm or Dorney Park have the peanuts characters.

882
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:44,000
This ride got changed. The name got changed to Race for Your Life, Charlie Brown.

883
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:50,000
Yeah, it sounds like such a threat. We're going to kill Charlie Brown by the end of this ride.

884
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:54,000
You're fucking dead, Brown. Stop it.

885
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:57,000
You just have to have enough fun to where they want to kill him.

886
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:00,000
You don't smile enough. They took him out with Linus's blanket.

887
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:03,000
Is it Linus with the blanket? Yes, that's correct.

888
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
We're going to pump pig pen dust down his throat.

889
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:09,000
You should have paid back the DeMarino family.

890
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:12,000
Charlie Brown. This is a movie.

891
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:16,000
That's the name of one of the movies, though. You should have paid back the DeMarino.

892
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:20,000
Race for Your Life is one of the movies. I know, I know. I got it from 77.

893
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:26,000
Do you have memories of the peanuts area? I'm looking through the peanuts area and I am astounded.

894
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:32,000
I've never been here. I'm astounded by the amount of different peanuts rides and experiences they have.

895
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:43,000
They have the kids area, whatever the current incarnation is, branding wise, I know is like very well reviewed for a kids park, which makes sense.

896
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:49,000
It's a very family park. Like I think it probably skews super young. Right.

897
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:54,000
So I do remember it being huge, but I don't. Most of my Kings Island visits were in my preteens and teens.

898
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:58,000
Right. So that was stupid to go to Charlie. You didn't care about that kid shit.

899
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:01,000
They have Charlie Brown's wind up that where they've had some of these are gone.

900
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:10,000
Flying Ace, Ariel Chase, Joe Cool's Dodgem School, Kite Eating Tree, Linus's Beetle Bugs, Linus's Launcher,

901
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:29,000
Peanuts 500, Peanuts Off-Road Rally, Peanuts Playhouse, Race for Your Life, Charlie Brown, Sally Seaplane, Snoopy versus Red Baron, Snoopy's Junction, Snoopy's Space Buddies, Surf Dog, The Great Pumpkin Coaster, Woodstock Express, Woodstock Gliders, and Woodstock Whirlybirds.

902
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:32,000
That'd be enough for a whole world. I applaud you, Mike.

903
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:44,000
I have questions on Snoopy versus the Red Baron. Is that meant to mimic like a mental disconnect where like the Red Baron part of Snoopy and the regular part of Snoopy are warring for control of his.

904
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:51,000
He splits brains. I don't know the details. I will say that it used to be Dick Daster leads by plane.

905
01:13:51,000 --> 01:14:00,000
Perfect. You know, that probably is a parental play, right? I mean, kids born since 2000 do not care about the peanuts, I wouldn't think.

906
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:03,000
Unless they did the film that came out.

907
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
Oh, that's right. They did.

908
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:09,000
By Paul Feek by former University of Florida.

909
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
Not a coincidence.

910
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:18,000
Adults, I mean adults, I think, force kids to like peanuts now still. So you still show them all the specials.

911
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:21,000
Kids want to listen to a slow talking character.

912
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:22,000
Yeah, peanuts.

913
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:23,000
A depressed little boy.

914
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:26,000
Peanuts, Calvin and Hobbes, maybe Farsai.

915
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:27,000
They're timeless.

916
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:30,000
Kids are still in books and stuff and people get them.

917
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:36,000
That makes it more appealing to me. So it's not a fail by any means. It's just it is curious of like all the things they could license.

918
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:39,000
I kind of respect that they went timeless. Again, it's probably a money saver.

919
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:45,000
Where are the theme park rights to the Paw Patrol?

920
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:52,000
Because Paw Patrol clearly is a just juggernaut of current three to five year old culture.

921
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:57,000
And I like Paw Patrol, too. I would love to go to a Paw Patrol place.

922
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:06,000
One of these places, I think Disney could Disney could safely like buy the Paw Patrol theme park rights for like five hundred billion dollars and make it back.

923
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:09,000
But if you had the thought, you're already too late.

924
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:14,000
Yeah. Well, no, I'm not looking to cash in myself. I just want to make sure they're spoken.

925
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:19,000
I'm saying that the youth will they will change faster than you can say.

926
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
I don't know any Paw Patrol characters.

927
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:24,000
Yeah, you're right. By the time there's like a child in my life.

928
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:27,000
So I'll say so. Like, so you know, Paw Patrol.

929
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:32,000
Well, you're going I'm reporting you to the police. You're a predator.

930
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:38,000
I think there is truth to that because I think a lot about like why aren't there more rides based on TV shows?

931
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:43,000
And I think it's like once TV shows stop airing, I mean, they live forever on streaming services now.

932
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:50,000
But like they're kind of out of like I I don't think about you know, I like Breaking Bad on the Wire, but I don't think about them.

933
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:53,000
That much. You're not going to get on the air anymore.

934
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:56,000
No, I'm not going to get on the Mertra coaster.

935
01:15:56,000 --> 01:16:01,000
But like a few years ago at Disney, there was Phineas and Ferb stuff everywhere in the park.

936
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:05,000
Exactly. Like in all the stores. And now when you go back again, there's like a shelf.

937
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:09,000
Maybe there's a shelf. That's a costly update.

938
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:18,000
Can I say I think one of the I don't know which but I would venture to guess one of these peanuts rides of which you speak is a rename of my favorite

939
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:21,000
ride title from when it was still Hanna Barbera.

940
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
Boo Boo's baggage claim.

941
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000
Adorable.

942
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:31,000
Such a wonderfully dull like Dick Dastardly's accountant.

943
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:37,000
That you know that that would have been right up my alley because in King's Dominion, one of my favorite places in the world.

944
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:43,000
And I found video walkthrough of it looking this up was Yogi's Cave, which I don't know if there was a Yogi's Cave here.

945
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
It was literally just an indoor walkthrough.

946
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:54,000
You were walking through a cave like a dark cave with music playing and there's like a creaky boo boo and a creaky Yogi animatronic at the end.

947
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
But I just I loved it.

948
01:16:56,000 --> 01:17:05,000
I would just come out the exit and just grab my family, my parents hand and go right back to the entrance and take a picnic basket.

949
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:06,000
Yeah. Yeah.

950
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:09,000
Cedar Point is very Yogi themed.

951
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:17,000
I'm not sure about now, but I have vivid memories because when last time I was at Cedar Point, I got hit by a tornado.

952
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:18,000
Wow.

953
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:25,000
So my memories are all blurred together with seeing the front awning of our hotel ripped off and then seeing the Yogi's Cave.

954
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:28,000
You know, it's like, oh my God, you were like escaping the tornado.

955
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:37,000
Yeah, we had to we had to like go underground or, you know, like kind of the equivalent of when you go into the halls of Disney, the the shortcuts that go under the park.

956
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:49,000
We went into like the restaurant holding until it like passed through and then walked through pouring rain to get my caricature from the front of the park and like carried it in a trash bag.

957
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:50,000
Got all the way home.

958
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:54,000
And then, yeah, the front awning of our Holiday Inn was had been ripped by a tornado.

959
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:57,000
It was like it was like a traumatizing kid memory.

960
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:58,000
Yeah.

961
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:01,000
As a proponent of Holiday Inn and having fun at Holiday Inn.

962
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:02,000
It was a holodome too.

963
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:03,000
A holodome?

964
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:04,000
Wow.

965
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:09,000
A holodome is a holiday inn.

966
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
Probably most of them are in the middle of the country.

967
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
I know there's we stayed at more than one.

968
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:31,000
It was like my brother and I's favorite thing where they have in a dome structure, kind of like the Arclight for people in L.A., a dome structure that has a basketball court, a swimming pool, a spa, a sauna, a play area, a games arcade and like a workout facility.

969
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:34,000
Wow. So it was like an attraction in of itself.

970
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
Like a rec center type.

971
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:39,000
Here's a postcard from one that used to be in Denver.

972
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:42,000
Holodome indoor fun center.

973
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:45,000
We would make a whole vacation out of that.

974
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:46,000
That is beautiful.

975
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:49,000
This was like this was like a Midwestern vacation in and of itself.

976
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:50,000
Wow.

977
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:53,000
I have never heard the phrase holodome.

978
01:18:53,000 --> 01:19:00,000
I consider myself a fan of Holiday Inn's and domes and I am really distressed that I didn't know that they had combined.

979
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:01,000
Oh, man.

980
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:04,000
So anyone on Twitter, send us any info you got about holodomes.

981
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
Welcome to the great indoors.

982
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:07,000
Yeah.

983
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:08,000
Putt golf sometimes.

984
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:11,000
Oh, you know, it smells real chloriney.

985
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:12,000
I have great memories.

986
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:22,000
My brother ran into, you know, they had glass separating the workout area from the fun area and he ran headlong into it and broke the glass and broke his finger.

987
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:25,000
I mean, all those great memories.

988
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:26,000
Yeah.

989
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:30,000
You kind of buried the leader in terms of you've had like terror at some of these places.

990
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:33,000
Hey, you know, that's the joy of the thrill seeker.

991
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,000
You're going to have high highs and low lows.

992
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:36,000
You're going to find love.

993
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
You're going to find failure.

994
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
It's it's it's the stuff of life.

995
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:46,000
These are the probably famously we didn't even get to it, but Fabio famously on the beast was on the beast.

996
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
And I believe double check me.

997
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:49,000
This is the bird.

998
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:53,000
He was on the beast and was struck by a bird in the nose.

999
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:57,000
Bloodied his nose. I believe he had some kind of cosmetic work.

1000
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:05,000
This was the tabloid stuff of Cincinnati, Ohio, for not just national news, but it was like fever pitch in my hometown.

1001
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:09,000
This image is ingrained in me, but I hate to do this.

1002
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:10,000
Oh, Bush Gardens.

1003
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:14,000
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, this kills me.

1004
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
What's what city?

1005
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
At least in Dave's home.

1006
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:19,000
Bush Gardens.

1007
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:20,000
We don't have that St.

1008
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:21,000
Louis or is that St.

1009
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:22,000
Louis?

1010
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:25,000
It was Apollo's Chariot, which is hold on.

1011
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:31,000
This is on the level of finding out that Marilyn Manson's drummer couldn't suck his own dick away.

1012
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:35,000
Like this is like the stuff that like Williams Brown high school.

1013
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
Oh, that's the Bush Gardens I used to go to.

1014
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
Yeah. Oh, that hurts so bad.

1015
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

1016
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
Jason is beating you now.

1017
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,000
Jason has more credit all of a sudden.

1018
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,000
He's pumping his fist in the air.

1019
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:52,000
This is this really was like the story of like it was told to me.

1020
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:55,000
So this is secondhand that this was this happened.

1021
01:20:55,000 --> 01:21:01,000
It shows how the Internet has changed my life because I just took it at face value.

1022
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:06,000
But I've thought since the age of whenever that happened that that happened in my basically my hometown.

1023
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:15,000
Dave, if it makes you feel any better, this when we did the Hershey Park episode, I found that I had been singing the Hershey Chocolate World song wrong for years.

1024
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:18,000
I feel no better. I'll have your pain.

1025
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
But it's not a competition.

1026
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:23,000
We can help each other deal with these things and grow like a fraud.

1027
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,000
But I throw it. You throw into this.

1028
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:28,000
Also, the revelation that Neil Armstrong is not as brave as me.

1029
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:31,000
Scott, your state is losing cred left.

1030
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:32,000
What are you going to tell me next?

1031
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:35,000
But water was made up.

1032
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:36,000
I was other kids.

1033
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
You weren't doing you weren't asking the question.

1034
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:43,000
I wanted to make sure that there wasn't another incident where he got hit in the face with a bird and there's not.

1035
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,000
Has Fabio ever been to Cincinnati?

1036
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
OK, I'll look up Fabio.

1037
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:48,000
I feel bad I didn't cross.

1038
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:51,000
Like everything else I've talked about, I kind of had to double check myself.

1039
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
That one I like took for truth.

1040
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:54,000
Wow.

1041
01:21:54,000 --> 01:22:01,000
Well, Fabio has been to Port Washington, the city where step by step is set, or at least fictionally he has.

1042
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:04,000
He went to visit his friend Bronson Pinchot, the hairdresser.

1043
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:05,000
Now that makes me feel better.

1044
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:06,000
Yeah, doesn't it?

1045
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
I mean, that's your general region.

1046
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:14,000
And I wasn't filmed there and I'm referring to is fake, but I yeah, I hope you feel good about it.

1047
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
Oh boy.

1048
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:17,000
How can we rescue you?

1049
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:18,000
Yeah, yeah.

1050
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:28,000
One thing I guess I'd want to get out to the to the ride community is like right now, unless I'm also mistaken, Kings Island does not have what they call a giga coaster.

1051
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:33,000
Right. Isn't this like a is that a new I think it was something good.

1052
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:38,000
I mean, it's probably good.

1053
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:42,000
I think one of them is called like a hyper coaster, which are like the super tall ones now.

1054
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:43,000
But I don't know.

1055
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,000
I haven't heard a giga coaster.

1056
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:48,000
And all my little browsing yesterday, I read this.

1057
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:49,000
You're right.

1058
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:54,000
A giga coaster is a roller coaster that's between 300 and 399 feet tall and completes a full circuit.

1059
01:22:54,000 --> 01:23:05,000
So this was like the one critique of a couple of ride heads that had visited Kings Island of like this park is perfect. It's this away from being like world class.

1060
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:13,000
So I just wanted to begin in a heartfelt appeal to the ride community that we that we stir up the interest to get that for Kings Island.

1061
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:14,000
Yeah, yeah.

1062
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:15,000
You need it more than ever.

1063
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:16,000
It looks terrifying.

1064
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
What is there one in the United States?

1065
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:21,000
Do we have an example of what a giga coaster is?

1066
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:33,000
Again, listeners potentially screaming to so established that I think we're not the way we're not a major coaster related podcast partially because we are too scared to go on many of them.

1067
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:41,000
But also here's what this is what I want to say about Kings Island is that like I think they're like we covered Kennywood and we covered Hershey Park.

1068
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:44,000
And I'm sure a lot of those coasters are really good, but they don't give you a lot to talk about.

1069
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:48,000
And I think there's lore to these Kings Island coasters.

1070
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
There's premises that are pretty neat.

1071
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:57,000
We actually didn't talk about face off, which is like a ride that goes for like it goes one way and then goes back the other way.

1072
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,000
And you're facing other people.

1073
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:00,000
You go back to back.

1074
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:01,000
Good ride, bad movie again.

1075
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,000
Yeah, yeah.

1076
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
There was also a Congo themed water ride.

1077
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:09,000
There was just like a bigger one of the shoot the shoot water rides.

1078
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:15,000
The bigger styles log film like Jurassic Park was like briefly themed to Congo.

1079
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:19,000
I think that was easier to take out.

1080
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:27,000
Yeah, I it's it's very interesting that you guys are afraid of these things because I remember getting over this fear at age 13.

1081
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:33,000
But I like Jason is less afraid than the two of us.

1082
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:36,000
I am I can be convinced now to do it.

1083
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
I do, but I don't love it necessarily.

1084
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:42,000
But I like I like I went on stuff and then I go I did like it.

1085
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
So you know, it'd be a great pitch.

1086
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:47,000
Yes, this this all I'll try to part with is how fail again.

1087
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:48,000
Go for it.

1088
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:51,000
You know, they have you must be this tall to ride this ride.

1089
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:52,000
I used to be terrified of that.

1090
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:52,000
Yeah.

1091
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:53,000
Walking up to that.

1092
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:56,000
The thought of falling short is so emasculating embarrassing.

1093
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:59,000
But they could have a thing.

1094
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,000
Are you afraid of this?

1095
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:05,000
And like an analogous thing like if it's a kid's ride, it's a picture of a spider.

1096
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:06,000
And if you're like, that's fine.

1097
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:07,000
I'll be OK.

1098
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:14,000
And if it's some of these big ones, they'll like really get into your brain and like test your emotional and mental fortitude.

1099
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:22,000
It's like it's a picture of like one of your evil uncles, like very specific or like a sword will come kind of close to your ear.

1100
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:25,000
OK. And then it's like if you can handle that, you can get on the beast.

1101
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:26,000
You're going to be all right.

1102
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:30,000
I just think they could pre-screen just a similar thematic or like a film or something.

1103
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
Because I think you guys can handle all of these things.

1104
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
I look especially now.

1105
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:40,000
I feel a responsibility to the theme park community to try these experiences out.

1106
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:51,000
So even though it's not something that maybe I would have done, say, we if we didn't have this podcast, I do feel like it is my my duty as a journalist.

1107
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:52,000
Yeah, yeah.

1108
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
I feel like we're journalists now.

1109
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:58,000
We're covering this place where I went on the racer and I went on the beast.

1110
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
So I feel set. I feel no obligation to anything.

1111
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
It's 13 years in the past.

1112
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
I did it. I don't got to go on anything else.

1113
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:11,000
I also want to say really fast because we got we got to rail just to finish the the Brady Bunch tail.

1114
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:20,000
Robert Reed refused to go on the racer and they were so instead he was just like watching the crew set up the camera on the front of the roller coaster.

1115
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:23,000
And he was like, this rig is too high.

1116
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,000
It's not going to clear.

1117
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,000
He was like a notorious complainer on the show in general.

1118
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:30,000
So I guess shut up, Robert. Let us let us do our job.

1119
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:37,000
He walks the back and forth like next to the track and is like measuring and eyeballing in his mind.

1120
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:42,000
And he's like it is never going to like that camera is going to break off.

1121
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
It's going to hit all of these get like they're dead.

1122
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:45,000
They're toast if you don't.

1123
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:54,000
So they so after they finally relented and they did a test of the of the ride with the camera attached and the car returned with no camera.

1124
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:55,000
It did break off.

1125
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:56,000
Robert Reed was right.

1126
01:26:56,000 --> 01:27:08,000
Robert Reed saved the lives of his of his sitcom family, much like in the later Brady Bunch Christmas special when he runs into that burning building and saves a whole bunch of workers.

1127
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
I mean, we've all seen this movie.

1128
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:11,000
Yeah.

1129
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:14,000
There's in the Christmas movie later, there's a very dramatic.

1130
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:21,000
It's not like any other Brady Bunch episode, but he runs into a burning building and saves a couple of workers.

1131
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:22,000
Wow.

1132
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:23,000
Well, American era.

1133
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:24,000
He wasn't.

1134
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:25,000
Yeah.

1135
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:26,000
He was a big hero.

1136
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:27,000
He put his money where his mouth is.

1137
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:28,000
Yeah.

1138
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:29,000
That guy would have quit Facebook.

1139
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:30,000
Damn right.

1140
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:31,000
Yeah.

1141
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:36,000
The equivalent the online equivalent of running into a burning building.

1142
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:39,000
So we salute you, Robert Reed.

1143
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:44,000
Dave, any any any final thoughts about the Kings Island?

1144
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:45,000
Anything?

1145
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:49,000
Pleasure to have this walk down memory lane, albeit some true memories, some false memories.

1146
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:52,000
I think it was a real joy.

1147
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:55,000
And set up that giga coaster so everybody gets new.

1148
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,000
I do have the answer to the giga coaster.

1149
01:27:57,000 --> 01:28:02,000
Fury 325 is the world's biggest giga coaster.

1150
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
It is where is it?

1151
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:08,000
It's in the Carowinds Amusement Park in Charlotte, North Carolina.

1152
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:09,000
We got to get one of those.

1153
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:10,000
Former Kings Entertainment.

1154
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:11,000
It's in the family.

1155
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:12,000
It was in the family.

1156
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
And it looks like that and it's got a giant.

1157
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:15,000
It's coming.

1158
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:16,000
It's coming.

1159
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:17,000
Now it's in the Cedar Fair family.

1160
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:18,000
Yeah.

1161
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:23,000
Just copy that one, cart it over and give it some name that seems like it used to be

1162
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:26,000
a Paramount movie name.

1163
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:27,000
That's and then it'll go right.

1164
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:28,000
60 seconds.

1165
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:29,000
Yeah, sure.

1166
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:30,000
Is that Paramount?

1167
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:33,000
But but you have to reverse engineer it.

1168
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:34,000
At one point it was gone in 60 seconds.

1169
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:35,000
Now you have to make it.

1170
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:36,000
Oh, right, right, right, right.

1171
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:37,000
Left in 59 seconds.

1172
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:42,000
You know what I learned recently?

1173
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:43,000
Gone in 60.

1174
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:46,000
Timmy Timothy Oliphant isn't gone in 60 seconds.

1175
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
I think in a supporting role.

1176
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:49,000
Go ahead.

1177
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:53,400
They liked the studio, liked him so much they wanted him to star in a little script they

1178
01:28:53,400 --> 01:29:04,000
had a little movie they were making or another studio called The Fast and the Furious.

1179
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
Oh, like a character named Dominic Toretto.

1180
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:07,000
Wow.

1181
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:08,000
So there could be a fast.

1182
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:15,920
There's another universe, parallel universe where Timothy Oliphant was not the justified

1183
01:29:15,920 --> 01:29:16,920
character.

1184
01:29:16,920 --> 01:29:19,440
I don't want Rayleigh.

1185
01:29:19,440 --> 01:29:20,440
He got shivered.

1186
01:29:20,440 --> 01:29:23,080
Dominic Toretto.

1187
01:29:23,080 --> 01:29:25,320
This for me is like he is not getting on the vortex.

1188
01:29:25,320 --> 01:29:27,280
Yeah, that's how scared I am.

1189
01:29:27,280 --> 01:29:28,720
That means you're scared.

1190
01:29:28,720 --> 01:29:32,480
Justified free world in the Santa Clarita.

1191
01:29:32,480 --> 01:29:33,480
Die.

1192
01:29:33,480 --> 01:29:35,320
The first time you sat up the whole podcast.

1193
01:29:35,320 --> 01:29:36,760
Yes, that's true.

1194
01:29:36,760 --> 01:29:42,000
I was also sued by memories of the former Paramount Parks and all the wonderful, you

1195
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:43,280
know, trip down memory lane.

1196
01:29:43,280 --> 01:29:44,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1197
01:29:44,280 --> 01:29:47,600
We'll talk about more Paramount things at some point when we cover King's Dominion.

1198
01:29:47,600 --> 01:29:49,360
I'm sure we will.

1199
01:29:49,360 --> 01:29:52,320
If we missed anything, you know, I feel like we missed a lot of stars.

1200
01:29:52,320 --> 01:29:53,320
There's a lot.

1201
01:29:53,320 --> 01:29:54,320
At these parks.

1202
01:29:54,320 --> 01:29:55,640
Tweeted us if there's anything we missed.

1203
01:29:55,640 --> 01:30:00,760
And there's no reason why we can't pick up and do little like many segments about Kings

1204
01:30:00,760 --> 01:30:01,760
Island.

1205
01:30:01,760 --> 01:30:05,840
Yeah, we love when people tweet at us stuff we missed and all that stuff because there's

1206
01:30:05,840 --> 01:30:06,840
so much.

1207
01:30:06,840 --> 01:30:07,840
What's that?

1208
01:30:07,840 --> 01:30:08,840
King Cobra, the stand up coaster.

1209
01:30:08,840 --> 01:30:09,840
You're going to get a litany.

1210
01:30:09,840 --> 01:30:10,840
Oh, yeah.

1211
01:30:10,840 --> 01:30:11,840
There's.

1212
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:12,840
You'll get it.

1213
01:30:12,840 --> 01:30:13,840
Don't worry.

1214
01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:14,840
It's a stand up coaster.

1215
01:30:14,840 --> 01:30:17,160
Other coasters had been converted to stand up.

1216
01:30:17,160 --> 01:30:20,400
This one was the first actual.

1217
01:30:20,400 --> 01:30:23,040
It would have needed a Carlson cut out from what I remember.

1218
01:30:23,040 --> 01:30:25,520
Yeah, they're not pleasant coasters.

1219
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:26,520
That's my thing.

1220
01:30:26,520 --> 01:30:32,520
I like riding coasters, but as a man who is five one, sometimes those shoulder harnesses

1221
01:30:32,520 --> 01:30:35,440
don't hit my head bounces around in them.

1222
01:30:35,440 --> 01:30:37,800
Yeah, it is incredibly unpleasant.

1223
01:30:37,800 --> 01:30:41,360
And we also didn't really get into Tomb Raider, which is the scariest ride I've ever been

1224
01:30:41,360 --> 01:30:42,360
on.

1225
01:30:42,360 --> 01:30:43,440
It's just really quick.

1226
01:30:43,440 --> 01:30:47,640
It's like you sit in theater seats, but there's like a harness over you and you really don't

1227
01:30:47,640 --> 01:30:52,040
understand what the ride mechanism is when you get on, because I certainly would have

1228
01:30:52,040 --> 01:30:54,520
run screaming if I knew what it was going to be.

1229
01:30:54,520 --> 01:30:58,840
But it's then the entire theater moves forward and you're on a pendulum and a big arm and

1230
01:30:58,840 --> 01:31:02,640
you don't even realize it and you're swung up at big stalactites and then you're looking

1231
01:31:02,640 --> 01:31:03,640
down.

1232
01:31:03,640 --> 01:31:04,640
There's like geysers.

1233
01:31:04,640 --> 01:31:07,360
You didn't go on this one, or you went on the crypt when it was more.

1234
01:31:07,360 --> 01:31:09,760
Yeah, it's been a while.

1235
01:31:09,760 --> 01:31:12,560
The general tenor of the screams on this thing.

1236
01:31:12,560 --> 01:31:16,320
I could tell I was not the only one who didn't understand what it was.

1237
01:31:16,320 --> 01:31:18,800
They didn't convey because it was not fun screams.

1238
01:31:18,800 --> 01:31:21,240
It was like genuine pure horror.

1239
01:31:21,240 --> 01:31:23,680
If they had the Ferguson test at the beginning, you would have been fine.

1240
01:31:23,680 --> 01:31:25,920
I don't know what to tell you.

1241
01:31:25,920 --> 01:31:27,720
What is like Tomb Raider?

1242
01:31:27,720 --> 01:31:31,200
Essentially, the mechanics are just like a carnival ride.

1243
01:31:31,200 --> 01:31:37,320
It's a popular kind of carnival ride, but it's just like in the dark and heavily themed.

1244
01:31:37,320 --> 01:31:43,960
A lot of effects, but once combined with the general idea of raiding a tomb, it's ten times

1245
01:31:43,960 --> 01:31:46,440
more so that's what you like.

1246
01:31:46,440 --> 01:31:56,520
The sign should have said, like, could you handle like, could you handle a spider web

1247
01:31:56,520 --> 01:31:59,080
with two spiders in it?

1248
01:31:59,080 --> 01:32:01,560
If not, they want to leave.

1249
01:32:01,560 --> 01:32:03,640
Well, they first and you've survived podcasts, right?

1250
01:32:03,640 --> 01:32:04,640
All right.

1251
01:32:04,640 --> 01:32:07,680
So, anything in here, anything you'd like to plug?

1252
01:32:07,680 --> 01:32:09,560
No, I don't got anything, man.

1253
01:32:09,560 --> 01:32:12,360
I look forward to that feeling you get when you get off every ride where you feel like

1254
01:32:12,360 --> 01:32:15,160
shaken and you want to go to bed.

1255
01:32:15,160 --> 01:32:16,160
Yeah.

1256
01:32:16,160 --> 01:32:20,000
Getting back to your holodome that's being torn apart by a tornado.

1257
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:21,000
Yeah, exactly.

1258
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:22,000
Terrifying.

1259
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:23,000
I'll see you at the holodome.

1260
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:24,000
That sounds great.

1261
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:27,040
That's a good, hey, that's a good, well, we've done these things.

1262
01:32:27,040 --> 01:32:29,280
We hang out at hotel bars once in a while.

1263
01:32:29,280 --> 01:32:34,160
Maybe the next one's got to be at the Denver holodome.

1264
01:32:34,160 --> 01:32:37,840
And listen, anyway, listeners who haven't been there, let us know.

1265
01:32:37,840 --> 01:32:43,440
And if you're listening, check out ancillary content on our Twitter at podcast, the ride,

1266
01:32:43,440 --> 01:32:45,240
not on our Facebook group.

1267
01:32:45,240 --> 01:32:46,240
Damn it.

1268
01:32:46,240 --> 01:32:49,240
The heroes are marching on.

1269
01:32:49,240 --> 01:32:50,520
Do we have one though, actually?

1270
01:32:50,520 --> 01:32:53,040
I, yeah, do I read one?

1271
01:32:53,040 --> 01:32:57,520
I registered one right when we first started and then really haven't we haven't done anything

1272
01:32:57,520 --> 01:32:58,520
with it.

1273
01:32:58,520 --> 01:32:59,520
Yeah, good heroes.

1274
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:02,320
I had to figure I didn't figure out the mechanics of that.

1275
01:33:02,320 --> 01:33:04,440
I might look into it.

1276
01:33:04,440 --> 01:33:06,320
People, some people are staying on Facebook.

1277
01:33:06,320 --> 01:33:07,320
Okay.

1278
01:33:07,320 --> 01:33:08,320
Yes.

1279
01:33:08,320 --> 01:33:11,320
We're going to have to fight about this off air.

1280
01:33:11,320 --> 01:33:12,320
Traders.

1281
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:13,320
Yeah.

1282
01:33:13,320 --> 01:33:16,440
Email us, rate and review us on iTunes.

1283
01:33:16,440 --> 01:33:17,840
Yeah, it's a great help.

1284
01:33:17,840 --> 01:33:18,840
That helps us out.

1285
01:33:18,840 --> 01:33:19,840
Those five stars on iTunes, yeah.

1286
01:33:19,840 --> 01:33:22,120
And force your parents to listen to the podcast.

1287
01:33:22,120 --> 01:33:25,040
Because a lot of people say their parents listen and that's nice.

1288
01:33:25,040 --> 01:33:26,040
Yeah, that is nice.

1289
01:33:26,040 --> 01:33:28,640
Yeah, I think parents have been enjoying it and I think our swears have been mild lately.

1290
01:33:28,640 --> 01:33:31,680
Yeah, we're like a lot more wholesome than we think we are, I think.

1291
01:33:31,680 --> 01:33:33,280
I think a lot more.

1292
01:33:33,280 --> 01:33:34,280
Yes.

1293
01:33:34,280 --> 01:33:36,360
The preteen in me is just hating this.

1294
01:33:36,360 --> 01:33:37,360
Yeah, that's fair.

1295
01:33:37,360 --> 01:33:39,400
I just want to, I want to be so ring bunched.

1296
01:33:39,400 --> 01:33:44,120
Dave has made a fist and is punching it into his other hand, which is open, but kind of

1297
01:33:44,120 --> 01:33:45,120
a little closed.

1298
01:33:45,120 --> 01:33:46,760
You know that classic bully move.

1299
01:33:46,760 --> 01:33:48,120
I'm fired up.

1300
01:33:48,120 --> 01:33:51,560
They haven't talked about any bases this entire pod.

1301
01:33:51,560 --> 01:33:52,560
All right.

1302
01:33:52,560 --> 01:33:53,560
Thanks for listening, everybody.

1303
01:33:53,560 --> 01:33:54,560
We'll catch you next time.

1304
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:55,560
Bye.

1305
01:33:55,560 --> 01:33:59,837
Bye.
