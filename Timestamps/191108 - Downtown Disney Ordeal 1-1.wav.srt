1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Forever...

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
...Dark!

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Darkness falls out on the street, Evil is its head.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Get your crazy shake to go, And your fried doughnut bread.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Beignets.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
The villains threaten this sacred place, This downtown shopping mall.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
We must defend the Lego store, And the Splitsville bowling balls.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The Downtown Disney or to you, We must protect our AP discount meals.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The Downtown Disney or to you, With secrets does the Earl of Sandwich conceal.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Boys, boys, my cousin has been taken by evil forces that have inhabited Downtown Disney.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
In order to find them, he will need to thoroughly discuss every aspect of them all.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Stores, restaurants, both of the Starbucks.

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:01:00,000
We have 15 daily very necessary episodes and much to do so. I will be there to guide you and keep your conversations from getting too off topic for...

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
...boring.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
The Downtown Disney ordeal. Why do we do this to ourselves?

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:15,000
And so it is, and here we are. Podcast the Ride, the Downtown Disney ordeal.

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:23,000
You've waited for it. You've pleaded for it. And now the day has arrived. I'm Scott Gardner. I'm joined by Mike Carlson.

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Hello.

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:32,000
It's even, it's hard to even muster the energy to even say the initial words, knowing that we have to pace ourselves and how much is ahead of us.

20
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I also just feel the importance of what we're doing today too. That's sort of weighing on me.

21
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Extremely. When you're renewing a franchise and taking it to the next level.

22
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Yeah.

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
And trying to top it, but the mall that you're covering is inherently more boring.

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Yes.

25
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I could be wrong. Let me, before anyone disagrees, Jason Sheridan. Thank God is here on this journey as well.

26
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Yes. I have poked in product, begged and badgered not to do this. And yes, we, the call has been answered.

27
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
We are rising to the challenge.

28
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Sivako.

29
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Sivako.

30
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Sivako, you would say.

31
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:20,000
To yes, examine a more sterile, less, slightly less chaotic and more inconvenient to visit.

32
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Yes.

33
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Outdoor pedestrian mall.

34
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:38,000
So yes, what Jason is referring to is that if you're newer to the podcast, last year we did a 19 part series on universal Hollywood city walk, which is their outdoor shopping mall, which has things like the Hard Rock Cafe,

35
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
indoor skydiving, massage water coffins.

36
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Massage. It's like a massage parlor, but they're, it's a robot doing it essentially.

37
00:02:48,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And all crepe place and all sock place. All of these inherently odd things. And we entered into it thinking this is a big waste of time. People won't be into this. We discovered so much exciting info.

38
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Yeah.

39
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:08,000
There's so much to talk about. And now we are covering something that is just literally Bezier.

40
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
It's a lot of Bezier.

41
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
It's Blander.

42
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It's downtown Disney.

43
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:20,000
It's downtown Disney in Anaheim. And let's qualify that because there is of course a downtown Disney in Orlando as well.

44
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Which is where the name initially came from.

45
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
What's that?

46
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
There is no longer.

47
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
It's not downtown Disney anymore?

48
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
It's Disney Springs.

49
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
All of it is Disney Springs?

50
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
All of it is Disney Springs.

51
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
There's not even that section is not even downtown Disney.

52
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Right. They don't say that anymore. It's downtown Disney Springs. Not downtown Disney Springs. It's just Disney Springs.

53
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Then wrong am I? I didn't know that. I thought the districts were still in play.

54
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
There are districts.

55
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
There's no West Side. There's no.

56
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Honestly, I didn't do a lot of research on that part of the world.

57
00:03:52,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Yeah, there are demarcations, but the distracting thing about Disney Springs is it's good.

58
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
It's good.

59
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Yes, and there's a house style.

60
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
They did actually update to the way that shopping centers should be.

61
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,000
These sort of open air farmers markets, artisans bringing their craft to life.

62
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Downtown Disney Anaheim is still stuck in this odd plastic. It is parts of it feel like original California adventure.

63
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Yes, parts of it are like rustic and like the Grand California hotel, but only some there's hideous fonts left and right.

64
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Yeah, some very on trend stuff. Some very like now stuff.

65
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Sure. Some next to just a Wetzel's pretzels and an uva bar.

66
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Sure. Well, I have no issue with the uva bar. I'll say that right now.

67
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
This has always been the centerpiece, the heart.

68
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,000
But the rest of it, I think what we're saying is we're battling a much different enemy this time.

69
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Yes.

70
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:03,000
And the strategies that got us through the last battle may not apply this time.

71
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
We have to change our skills, develop new skills.

72
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:17,000
And luckily, there is one component of this that is consistent from the City Walk saga to the downtown Disney ordeal.

73
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:26,000
And the most crucial element of all that we have the support of our dear friend and our guide through this area.

74
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Ladies and gentlemen, he's here again. The Sector Keeper.

75
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Boys, boys.

76
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:39,000
He is back. I haven't seen him for a little bit.

77
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:45,000
He materialized at our 100th episode live show to save us from the clutches of Bugsy.

78
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Thank you once again. Bad man. Bad man.

79
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
He's Hugsy now who is confusing. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

80
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I would have to agree.

81
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:02,000
So, yeah, again, this is for if you're newer to the podcast, the City Walk saga brought us the Sector Keeper.

82
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,000
He's basically the ghost of a little boy who passed away in the fountain of a staph infection.

83
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
And he was sort of in charge of keeping the sectors in order at City Walk.

84
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:24,000
So he would make sure that when we were discussing and reviewing the different stores, he would make sure that we were only reviewing the Hard Rock in Sector.

85
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Let's say it was 14 and the Hard Rock gift shop in, let's say, Sector.

86
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Separate. Yes.

87
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
So he would keep all of that separate.

88
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
We met him there and he helped guide us along the way.

89
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
And now he is back to help us on this journey.

90
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Not just Guardian. Friend.

91
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Yes. Well, that's how we feel too.

92
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
We went through a lot together.

93
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
On the stage included.

94
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:53,000
And yeah, I feel like we've ascended to a different level of the relationship.

95
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
That being said, we've all been busy.

96
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I just haven't gotten a chance to see you lately.

97
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Things going good?

98
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Things have been better.

99
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Oh, no.

100
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
When we last saw you, you were working at a Cricket Wireless for low pay in a really bad parking.

101
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Yeah.

102
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
They cut my hours.

103
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that.

104
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
The writing was on the wall.

105
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Yeah. You know what?

106
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Sometimes like when you get fired, it's sort of a blessing.

107
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I mean, I'm not saying you're fired.

108
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I'm so sorry.

109
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
That might not happen.

110
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
No, no, no.

111
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Well, they use the term laid off.

112
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Yeah. Laid off.

113
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
When you're laid off, sometimes it's like no severance.

114
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Yeah. Yeah.

115
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Was it I think like that sort of type of place maybe doesn't give you like a nice severance package when you leave or they don't dress it up either.

116
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
It's like this is this is not gone your way.

117
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
No. Huh. Huh.

118
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Also, since we freed you like six things have closed its city walk that we touched on in the saga.

119
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Yes. Yes.

120
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
And how the moon is just announced that it was closing.

121
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Oh, boy.

122
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Yeah.

123
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
What is that?

124
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
So sorry.

125
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Sorry to tell you like this.

126
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
We don't want to make you sicker.

127
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I know you love all of these places so much.

128
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
But yeah, forget what else.

129
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Santa.

130
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
He does didn't know.

131
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Yeah, now it is open and it's a fun party.

132
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I was I ate there right before.

133
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:26,000
They remodeled the fountain that plunged you into your your, you know, purgatorial state.

134
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
So it might be safer.

135
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
It might have been cleaned, might be more disease free.

136
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,000
And maybe there aren't future children who will end up bearing your burden.

137
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Some say it's not up to the children, but up to the negligent parents.

138
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Would you would you say that in your state have you now?

139
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:56,000
But now that you're free and you've had I don't know if you've been to therapy, if you've used any of the real world coping skills now at your disposal.

140
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I lost my insurance when I was fired.

141
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
OK.

142
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Yes.

143
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Not spending that on.

144
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
So you're you're dealing with all this all on your lonesome.

145
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Yes.

146
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Yes.

147
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Do you do you blame your parents?

148
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Some days, yes.

149
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Some days, no.

150
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Yeah, that's healthy, I think.

151
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Yeah.

152
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Yeah, it's OK.

153
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
You know, some days you get that anger, some days you don't.

154
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Right. Right.

155
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Yeah.

156
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
That's what sort of a therapist would say, I think.

157
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Yes.

158
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Are you therapist?

159
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,000
No, I don't think I just sort of I'm a podcaster with like kind of an open heart.

160
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I feel like that's sort of my thing.

161
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
It's close.

162
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I mean, getting together, getting in a room and having a conversation, it's you know, podcasting like a therapy session.

163
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Yeah.

164
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:50,000
So if you're ever bummed out about anything or need to process anything about your admittedly complicated past, we're here for you.

165
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Yeah.

166
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Thank you.

167
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Jason's gotten a lot better since doing podcasting.

168
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Just mentally.

169
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Yeah.

170
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Also in therapy.

171
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
The Joker laugh comes out of his mouth.

172
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Please do not even bring up the dreaded clown prince of crime, Michael.

173
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
All right.

174
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I won't.

175
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:19,000
So, sector keeper, since you talk about your health, I would suggest if you could stop jewel, you have been jeweling pretty much since you came in here.

176
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
And we have a lot of work to do.

177
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
It's really muggy in here now.

178
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
If you could go easy on the jewel.

179
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Mango mint.

180
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Mango.

181
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Oh.

182
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Waivers don't go together.

183
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
That's disgusting.

184
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
You got stockpiled.

185
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
They're taking the mango off the market.

186
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Mango mint.

187
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Yes, I stockpiled them.

188
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I would trade.

189
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I would work extra shifts at cricket and Toby would hook me up.

190
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Toby.

191
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Toby sounds like a bad influence.

192
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Yeah, you may want to stay away from him.

193
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I hope the job will keep you away from Toby necessarily.

194
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Like, don't keep hanging out with the guy.

195
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Toby wasn't arrested.

196
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Oh, shit.

197
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I mean, sounds good.

198
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
You're still like you're under 18.

199
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
You've aged since we saw you, but you're still under 18.

200
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
So you shouldn't be giving you jewel.

201
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:12,000
That is not a twitch that a child is supposed to have.

202
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
An adolescent is supposed to have.

203
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Are you getting sick again?

204
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Oh, okay.

205
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Please don't blast plumes.

206
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
We have a lot to do today.

207
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I think a lot of people are going to ask me,

208
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:30,000
do I have to listen to all 19 episodes of the City Walk Saga before listening to the Downtown Disney ordeal?

209
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
And my answer would be yes.

210
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Of course.

211
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I would say that right now it's going to make it a lot more rich for you of listening experience

212
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
if you've listened to all 19 City Walk episodes.

213
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
For sure.

214
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:47,000
And I would say if you use a different lens to look at it, you get to listen to all 19.

215
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
What?

216
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Therapy language.

217
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Therapy language.

218
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Yeah, it's a gift.

219
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
It's a blessing.

220
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
He's better.

221
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Jason is better.

222
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:00,000
That's the biggest jump that you'll notice from City Walk Saga to Downtown Disney ordeal is Jason's improved attitude.

223
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
How much better Jason is since Downtown Disney?

224
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
The listener is going, this is better?

225
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Better still includes doing a many days in a row podcast series about a mall that is not that themed next to a theme park.

226
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Yes.

227
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,000
In eight years when we're doing the restaurants outside of Dollywood, Jason's going to be so much better.

228
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Yeah.

229
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
He's going to be almost perfect at that point.

230
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I will be involved beyond my corporeal form.

231
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I will just be a floating gaseous state, a consciousness in a cloud of gas.

232
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
So we'll have two supernatural beings as part of the...

233
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Yeah.

234
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
And maybe all hopefully start to...

235
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
One of us will be tied for...

236
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
We'll be vying to leave our human forms.

237
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
But by the time, yeah, when we're doing...

238
00:12:52,000 --> 00:13:02,000
When we're doing like if there is like a Wendy's outside of Silver Dollar City and we have to do four episodes with a single Wendy's, will we still be humans?

239
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Yeah, spicy nugs are back.

240
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Now that being said, we're talking about episode count.

241
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,000
And okay, the last series was 19 parts.

242
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:22,000
And it seems like we all together have found a verdict on how many parts we're going to cover downtown Disney in.

243
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
And the number is 15.

244
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Levels.

245
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Oh, yes.

246
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Well, hey, well, there's that too.

247
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
That's the technical way to describe it.

248
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I'm just really happy that we're dealing with it in 15 parts as opposed...

249
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I think we're getting off easier this time.

250
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
This is great news to me.

251
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I was so scared that the thing would be to notch it up and like more is going to be crazy.

252
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
But there's a little less here, I have to say.

253
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
It seems like there's less here.

254
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,000
It seems like there's just no way we could possibly kill a ton of time talking about any of this.

255
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
No, no, absolutely not.

256
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
No, got to reduce this.

257
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Got to have some life left.

258
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Jason doesn't have 90 minutes on salt and straw.

259
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
No.

260
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
90 minutes of iron.

261
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
180 minutes.

262
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Just on the name.

263
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
But, Sector Keeper, you're right.

264
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I'm glad you're anxious to talk about it.

265
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
We are formatting this in a little bit of a different fact.

266
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:28,000
By now you've heard our theme song that outlined a little bit of the way this is going to go.

267
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Right.

268
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
And so it's not...

269
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:36,000
You know, it's interesting you're here and you're the Sector Keeper because we aren't dealing with this in sectors anymore.

270
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
No, levels.

271
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Levels. The new thing is levels.

272
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Levels and stages.

273
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Okay, yes. Levels and stages. And now it's...

274
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Very understandable.

275
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Yes, yeah, got it.

276
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:56,000
And we'll post something on the Twitter that lays out how this is going to work.

277
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
So it's 15 episodes, all told, and they are broken into levels and stages.

278
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I'm a little confused about which is level and which is stage.

279
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Well, here's the... You know, you think of your Mario 1, the first Mario game.

280
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,000
It would be world like 1-1, 1-2.

281
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Levels and stages, it's a little bit unclear what you call that second part of the world.

282
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
You know, what is that? Dash 2. Is that a stage?

283
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I think that's the level. I think it's world 1, level 1.

284
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Right? World 1, level 1.

285
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
So you're saying maybe we've screwed up already and we should have not.

286
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
You know what? We can't go back.

287
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
When the sector keeper sets rules, then that's what we're doing.

288
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,000
So you're right. It should have probably been when we were organizing this world 1, level 1.

289
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
But instead it's level 1, stage 1.

290
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
So the levels now are the worlds.

291
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
The stages are the worlds.

292
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Stages are levels.

293
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
That's right.

294
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Wait, no, no, no. I got that order wrong.

295
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Levels are... Worlds are levels.

296
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Worlds are levels to us.

297
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Levels are stages to us.

298
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Correct.

299
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
No, no, no. I know.

300
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
He's getting bored.

301
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
It's convoluted. We'll keep moving.

302
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Sorry. I choked on my jewel.

303
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
That's what's going to happen to you. I'm worried about you.

304
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,000
By the way, okay, so we're going to do all of these stages and levels.

305
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,000
What is the point? Are we rescuing you again? Did you fall into a fountain again?

306
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
And if so, why? Come on. Keep yourself in line.

307
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,000
You know what happened last time. You're older now. You should be more responsible.

308
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
It's much more dire, boys.

309
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Oh, shit.

310
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
There are evil spirits.

311
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Oh, no. Evil spirits?

312
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Downtown Disney has been infiltrated, boys.

313
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
No, not our precious... What?

314
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I thought we were just going to talk about like a sandal store.

315
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
There's evil spirits around?

316
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
And it's captured...

317
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
The level keeper.

318
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Oh, no. The level keeper.

319
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
The level keeper.

320
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
My cousin, the level keeper.

321
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Oh, no.

322
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Your cousin? He was my best friend.

323
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
That's nice. I mean, it's nice when cousins can have relationships.

324
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
And I'm sure you were very fond of the level keeper, but like...

325
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Well, it was easier geographically because we lived near each other.

326
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Oh, yeah, yeah, sure. If you're across the country cousins, that connection's maybe not going to happen.

327
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Oh, that's nice. Okay.

328
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Yes, he's been captured.

329
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Oh, no. And he or she, I don't even want to suppose, like a good person.

330
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:41,000
It's hard for us to be invested not knowing. We know you. We wanted to save you.

331
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Good cousin.

332
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Good cousin.

333
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Good cousin.

334
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:53,000
And an actual cousin, not like in mob movies where they say the cousins are coming over from Italy to help us out.

335
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Actual cousin.

336
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Actual cousin, okay. All right. Not a hitman, not an international hitman scenario. Got it.

337
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Yes, yes. And so you all need to clear each level, beat each stage, dominate each world.

338
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Wait, where is the level keeper? Why aren't they telling us this stuff?

339
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,000
They're captured. They're captured. They're captured.

340
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Jason, are you using a jewel over there? Are you distracted by your own jewel?

341
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Just a little.

342
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:34,000
This one's glasses fogged up when we mentioned salt and straw.

343
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:41,000
His ears started slowly venting steam, not fast like a cartoon, and it filled him up. That's why he didn't hear.

344
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:47,000
All right, look, I got a real rare. I got one of the last ones of those black market ones that's killing all those people.

345
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
The jewel?

346
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Yeah, I spent a lot of money on this thing.

347
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
You want it? You want to prove you can survive?

348
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
It's rare.

349
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Yeah, but if it's rare.

350
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I don't know how I have to explain this.

351
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Well, you're in collect-em-all mentality already, which I guess we have to be to do this thing.

352
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I mean, it'll come in handy with some of these stores.

353
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Oh, sure. Yeah.

354
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
My jewel looks like Pokemon.

355
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
That's nice. That's good.

356
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
You've attained your child interests.

357
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,000
You're sort of like, I feel like you're, because we left it at kind of like you've entered a teenage state.

358
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:30,000
It seems like you're sort of like, I want to say it's a puberty situation because sometimes I talk to you and you seem like real young,

359
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:37,000
and sometimes you seem like you're like your full-on raging angst-addled teen.

360
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Is that, do you feel like, is it kind of that feeling where you wake up feeling a little different every day?

361
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Sure. Yeah. Ghost hormones are more intense than regular hormones.

362
00:19:48,000 --> 00:20:00,000
So I feel everything at a, if you feel it at a 10 as a teenager, I feel it at a 10 to the 10th power.

363
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Oh my God. Literally exponential.

364
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Yes, my hormones are exponential.

365
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Geez. So you having feelings like the good boys of the movie Good Boy, like going through,

366
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:19,000
like having to thinking about like your first makeout session or whatever is 10 times more stressful than it would be for the good boys.

367
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Oh, good boys. Yeah.

368
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
You related to good boys.

369
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Yeah. I want to see it, but I can't go get in. Will you take me to good boys?

370
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Oh, are we allowed to do that? I guess we are.

371
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I guess so.

372
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
You're with an older person. We're older.

373
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Yeah. I mean, you're already 30 year olds hanging out with a little boy.

374
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
He's got a good point. Yeah, that's true.

375
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Yeah. If we're on a list already, we're, I mean, then we're on the list.

376
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Yeah, that's true. We're never getting off the list. So, I mean, I guess so.

377
00:20:52,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Let's promise each other that once we rescue my cousin, the level keeper will go see good boys or rent it if it's not still in theaters.

378
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:11,000
So that's the reward. That's what we get at the end of all this is a trip to we get to take get to I guess I need to need one of those lenses, Jason.

379
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:23,000
We get to take you to see this movie that we don't really care about either way. Yeah.

380
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:30,000
That's a yes. I guess that's a yes. Well, boy, the stakes could not be higher. A cousin who is the level keeper.

381
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,000
I mean, I guess I'd like to meet. I'm fond of you as a keeper, so I'd like to meet the level keeper too.

382
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:41,000
So please clear each level master, master each stage. OK.

383
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:49,000
And once you discuss and review each of those, you will get closer to rescuing my cousin, the level keeper.

384
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:55,000
OK. And you will earn a great reward.

385
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:05,000
All right. OK. This sounds doable. But what is it? OK. So stages each episode is a stage and then three.

386
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:10,000
If I'm getting it right, three episodes, three stages together comprise a level.

387
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:15,000
But when the level is done, so then just that's the level we're done on level.

388
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Like, yeah, is it like is it like a video game or is there we're not like a risk?

389
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I guess we're sort of rescuing a princess at the end of the whole thing, but it's possible that at the end of a level that the level keeper is in that has been in that level.

390
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Yes, you will clear each stage. Yeah.

391
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:44,000
And then at the end of each level, there is a boss. Oh, my goodness.

392
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I here I went thinking it was going to be simple. This is walking in a Raider store and touching a rich Ganon jersey.

393
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:02,000
There is now a boss. Oh, my. Interesting enough, Ganon is a boss in the Zelda.

394
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Zelda. Yeah. Yeah. So it's all a little Zelda.

395
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Yeah. This is a much more dangerous ordeal. Oh, my God. Right.

396
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:21,000
And it I mean, it really ups the stakes every three episodes.

397
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:26,000
We have to face some greater some greater villain or demon. Right.

398
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,000
I'm so curious what those are going to be. We'll have to find out, I guess.

399
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:35,000
I guess the only way I mean, it must be things that are happening within these within these stores.

400
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Boys, boys, you will help. Yes. Yeah. Yeah.

401
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:45,000
We're in. We're in. I mean, the more I hear, the more I just feel like it's going to be a pain in the ass.

402
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,000
So just forgive me for, you know, I'm just trying to process like, oh, God, now it's bosses.

403
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:54,000
I don't I'm sure your cousin's very nice. But no, no, I mean, I mean, we're in.

404
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
We're in. We're in. We're in. We're in. We're in. We're in this ordeal together. Yes.

405
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
OK. OK. Thank you, boys. Thank you. Absolutely.

406
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:05,000
So we just have to rate. We have to talk about review things.

407
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:10,000
All the different levels and stages. Yes. And then beat the bosses and beat the bosses.

408
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Is that also by just adequately reviewing and discussing?

409
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Yeah, that'll do it. OK. OK.

410
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:24,000
But just like extra good, like in the way that a boss at the end of a video game is just like you have to do all the stuff you did.

411
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,000
But like, right. More. We really got to dig in. Yes. OK. OK.

412
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Well, your mediocre enthusiasm gives me strength.

413
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Hey, that's enough. OK. I mean, I get it.

414
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,000
You're less invested on this one. It's not your hometown.

415
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,000
It's not a hometown game. Is that it for today? Are we good? Are we are you letting us go now?

416
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,000
No, boys. Are we getting started? It begins today.

417
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Oh, man. This is not just an intro.

418
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:55,000
This is the first level, the first stage.

419
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Boys, boys, stage one level one.

420
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Where are we going? What is it?

421
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Which which things do we have to talk about?

422
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Before you say it all. So can I just ask, like, OK, I know what's in downtown Disney, right?

423
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:19,000
And I'm picturing it and there's like the sandal thing and then a bar and then like, you know, like, well, like, like the pin place.

424
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:26,000
OK, so that's all we can cover all that. That's fine. But do we at least get to go to like because you know what I love is like the Grand California

425
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Hotel and the big, you know, the hearthstone bar and you get to sit over.

426
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
No out of bounds out of OK.

427
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Oh, so we don't tell us no amusement parks, not eat, not the hotels.

428
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,000
That's good. No hotels. That's good. Because I didn't want to do that.

429
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,000
I thought the hotels are too interesting here. So actually, I'm very excited.

430
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
We're saving it. You know, Jason likes the rule.

431
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:56,000
I like this rule. No Trader Sam. No Trader Sam. No Trader Sam.

432
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Yeah, OK. I guess it's not technically in downtown Disney.

433
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:06,000
So that's true. But like, couldn't we have like I mean, the whole also the Universal hotels were not part of a city walk.

434
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Yeah, that's true. But the boundaries are clear.

435
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:19,000
All right. Yeah. Metal detectors you walk through in the Honda minivan that has a Star Wars Galaxy Edge decal on it.

436
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Oh, OK. That's fair. Wait, they're in. That is the those are the boundaries.

437
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:30,000
OK, OK. Oh, gosh. And parked by the La Brea like outdoor seating it like right next to.

438
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Oh, so does that mean we do or don't talk about you're talking about the Star Wars Galaxy's Edge Honda?

439
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Oh, no. I don't see any research on the Honda. I didn't do research either.

440
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:44,000
I just saw the name. It's the gal. It's the Star Wars Galaxy's Edge Honda Odyssey Elite is.

441
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Are we talking about that or not? That is the furthest bound that way.

442
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
And the other bound, I guess we have to.

443
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:55,000
But a bound is that we talk about it or is a bound that that's where we don't.

444
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:00,000
It's like the Continental Divide. It's a line on a map. Yes. What he said.

445
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Yes. Yes. That actually didn't answer the question. Well, from West.

446
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Are we talking about the car or not? West of the car.

447
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:16,000
OK, water flows one way and that is where downtown Disney flows east of the car becomes the Esplanade.

448
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Hmm. I'm also I'll turn around because, OK, north south north south is Disneyland.

449
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
OK, so we're starting east. No, no talking about this.

450
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:30,000
OK, no, no, no, no, I wouldn't. I'm just just to like directionally put me there.

451
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:35,000
I just know that's a north south park. OK, other that's the last we'll ever talk about Disneyland.

452
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Yeah, sure. I swear. No rides, no rides there. And there is not one ride anywhere in the city.

453
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
What kind of as a ride? Oh, OK.

454
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Why don't you tell us what's in where we age one that's level one and stage one level one.

455
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:59,000
The other way level one stage one level one stage one level one stage one.

456
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:09,000
One Labreah Bakery Express, the Brea Bakery Cafe and World of Disney.

457
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:16,000
OK, OK, so we're starting from that side as if we were leaving a fun day at the places we're not going to mention.

458
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Yes, we're leaving our journey behind a minivan. OK, so we covered that.

459
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Good. Yeah, it says it says like hashtag Honda Disneyland.

460
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
I believe that's all I got to say about that.

461
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Leaving the borders behind. Yeah. And Esplanade isn't in there.

462
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Esplanade doesn't count. No, no, we're not talking about that.

463
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
This is not we'll do a separate Esplanade. Yeah.

464
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:43,000
The Esplanade encounter. OK, so we're heading into we're heading into downtown.

465
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:52,000
I guess we should talk a little too about downtown Disney in general, which opened a little prior of California Adventure January 2001.

466
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:58,000
The name taken from what I now know is no longer used in Orlando, but they were using that name there first.

467
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Yep. And it is open in January, I believe.

468
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Can I just read a little? There's something I'm going to pull out every once in a while.

469
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
My old I like to consult my old magazines.

470
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:15,000
They got to be good for something. And I have a spring 2001 special collectors issue of Disney magazine.

471
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:21,000
The you know, the the four four times a year magazine that I a teenager,

472
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:28,000
a 15 year old had a bunch of Disney ads delivered to my home that I couldn't read when it was lent.

473
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
I had to be sad about Jesus.

474
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:37,000
So this is this is an issue that gives a big preview of California Adventure and what it's going to be.

475
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:44,000
But I'm going to skip all of those pages and go to the two page spread about downtown Disney just so I can like

476
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:49,000
because if we're doing a little overview, let me let's let me go to how they were presenting it.

477
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:54,000
This this whole place in 2001. Tell me, agree or disagree.

478
00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Downtown Disney, an entertainment district between the new park and Disneyland is a descendant of European leisure parks like the charming Tivoli Gardens in Denmark.

479
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Huh? Sure. Downtown's designers were especially impressed with the way

480
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:15,000
landscapers filled these parks with flowers to provide urbanites with romantic escapes in the center of dense cities.

481
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Imagineers wedded old world ambiance with contemporary American energy.

482
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Does that feel like an accurate description of what we were going to talk about for?

483
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,000
No, no, no. There are some Tivoli Gardens.

484
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,000
It's pretty elevated. Yes.

485
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
There's flowers in there. There's a tree or two.

486
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:41,000
They've kind of gotten more a little more the last few years with flower sculpture.

487
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:45,000
To be fair, though, I wasn't there until 2007.

488
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:49,000
So perhaps when it opened, it really was like Tivoli Gardens.

489
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:53,000
I can I was there probably in 2002 and I can attest that it was not.

490
00:30:53,000 --> 00:31:00,000
OK, I think anywhere with an ESPN zone therefore cannot be that much like Tivoli Gardens.

491
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
And I was dead. And you were dead.

492
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Yeah, that was established. That was during your limbo.

493
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:09,000
So you missed all the great ESPN anchors. You missed the Obermann.

494
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Tivoli Garden is a known thing.

495
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
It's a park. It's in Copenhagen.

496
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Yeah. And you're up and it started as like a park decades ago and stuff and slowly built out the attraction.

497
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:32,000
It helps inspire Disneyland. I hate to talk about it, but I do hate talking about it.

498
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Waltz went to Tivoli Gardens and it was this kind of lush storybook place.

499
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Yeah. And so Disneyland was supposed to be a little bit like that.

500
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:45,000
A lot more greenery, landscape architecture, garden follies.

501
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Garden, garden, little little like a mishaps.

502
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:58,000
No. Well, that's what see that's what people thought was funny back that like little statues or fake building castle like buildings and stuff.

503
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,000
And they were whimsical. They were whimsical.

504
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:05,000
They don't serve a purpose. They're purely for decoration. It's called a folly.

505
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Oh, you pointed a little castle and laugh.

506
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Yeah, basically, I think that's what they were implying because it wasn't really a castle.

507
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
So glad I didn't live in the past.

508
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:22,000
I saw it went to like you've never pointed a castle and laughed.

509
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
What a folly.

510
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:30,000
I went to a DuPont estate last year in Delaware, like around Christmas time.

511
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
And the guy kept talking about the follies.

512
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:39,000
There's these little these little things, these little like pagoda like shed sort of things.

513
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:44,000
And they called them follies. And this still exists in like parks and their little novelties.

514
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:52,000
They're a little like, oh, isn't that the definition of the second definition of folly is a costly ornamental building with no practical purpose.

515
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Yeah, especially a tower or mock gothic ruin built in a large garden or park.

516
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Yeah. The big emphasis is it serves no purpose.

517
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
It's so really decorated.

518
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:10,000
It's a silly building. Yeah, the building was upside down, say that would be a folly.

519
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
That would be a folly folly.

520
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Is this is every is all of Disneyland follies because the castle is for fun.

521
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Yeah. But if it's a yeah, does walking through Sleeping Beauty's castle mean that there's no practical purpose for it because it's just a frivolous experience or is that a deep meaningful thing?

522
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
So thus, it's not a folly.

523
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Well, that brings us back to the simulation and simulacrum. You know, this is a whole other thing.

524
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Anyway, back to the Tivoli Gardens of Anaheim.

525
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Is a miniature golf course is all are all of those things.

526
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
I think you could describe as well.

527
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:51,000
But if you need to get the ball through the bottom of the castle, then it does serve a purpose.

528
00:33:51,000 --> 00:34:04,000
But if it's if it's a hole that's purely decorative, sometimes there's just a castle for show or like Humpty Dumpty for show as opposed to a simple machine like some sort of doodad.

529
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:14,000
So if it was like you had to get the ball in a hippo's mouth and then it were to shit the ball out that his butt that I think that would be practical and he's not folly function.

530
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:24,000
But if it's just a function hippo watching you hippo statue watching you golf from the side that I think you would call could call a folly frivolous.

531
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Our most fun invention yet.

532
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
The game folly or not folly.

533
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Everyone's playing it.

534
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:42,000
If we had to go to the other side of the day, let's let's go over to the west side and just past the boundaries is that big sorcerer's hat that marks the beginning of the Disneyland Hotel.

535
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Folly folly, right?

536
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:50,000
I based on that definition that it doesn't serve a practical purpose besides decoration.

537
00:34:50,000 --> 00:35:00,000
But if you say it's raining and you're standing under it and it's protecting you from the rain, that is a practical purpose full of holes, though, like big open line.

538
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Good point.

539
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Okay.

540
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
What are you?

541
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
What do you mean?

542
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,000
This is a good conversation.

543
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Boys.

544
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Yeah.

545
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
What do we have?

546
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
We're level with this.

547
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
You shouldn't.

548
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
You should know that my coughs are not because I am weak.

549
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:33,000
My coughs are because I'm taking drags of my mango mint jewel and I'm taking those because I'm stressed because I've just received a text message from the level keeper.

550
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Oh my God.

551
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:41,000
I thought this is a more otherworldly.

552
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:48,000
This is used to a cricket wireless phone that I slipped him being kidnapped.

553
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Oh my God.

554
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Okay.

555
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Oh, good.

556
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Well, this will help us get to know him or her.

557
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Yes.

558
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Yeah.

559
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Yes.

560
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:05,000
They said, keep moving.

561
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Moving along.

562
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
So they're weak.

563
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
They're getting weak.

564
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
They're getting weak.

565
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Yes.

566
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:17,000
So they also through that burner phone or hearing us right now.

567
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Basically, yes, I'm in contact with them.

568
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
You're just like, keep texting them.

569
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Just like, yeah, they're talking about follies.

570
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:28,000
They have only have so many, they have a limited text message plan.

571
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Oh, sure.

572
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Yeah.

573
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
You still make it 90 a month.

574
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
It's prepaid, baby.

575
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Okay.

576
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Okay.

577
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
So we have to keep these communications really concise.

578
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
I guess let's just keep moving west.

579
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Let's start with Libraea Bakery Express.

580
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Oh, man.

581
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
To kick it off.

582
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Yeah.

583
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:50,000
I used to go here for breakfast a lot when I went to the parks.

584
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:56,000
I feel like I have sank a lot of money before I bought Cliff Bars, before I learned about

585
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Cliff Bars.

586
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:01,000
The distinction between the cafe and the express is that there is a sit down area toward the

587
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
right of the building.

588
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Am I wrong?

589
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,000
There's sit down areas outside of both parts.

590
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Right.

591
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
But the left one is for express.

592
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Am I wrong?

593
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Yes.

594
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
That's correct.

595
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
It's an outdoor seating patio.

596
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
But remember, we're confused about West and East.

597
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
It's a good point.

598
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,000
The East on the East is the seating for the Libraea Bakery Express.

599
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:23,000
You're looking at the Libraea Bakery complex.

600
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,500
You're facing the door.

601
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:25,680
When you're facing the door.

602
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,000
To the left is the express.

603
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
A quick service.

604
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
You go through, you pick out some baked goods.

605
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:34,200
If you want a breakfast burrito or croissant sandwich and you pay, you get coffee and then

606
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,200
you sit outside.

607
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,200
It's very pleasant.

608
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,200
Yes.

609
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,200
I like it.

610
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:41,000
Libraea Bakery has been here since the beginning, right?

611
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Yes.

612
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Is that correct?

613
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
That's an original member.

614
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
It's not changed.

615
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,520
I think I would call it like a rock solid.

616
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:50,400
I would call it a solid place.

617
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,720
And an LA institution.

618
00:37:52,720 --> 00:38:01,840
The original one opened on Libraea in Los Angeles in 1989 by Nancy Silverton.

619
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:04,400
Profiled in a chef's table.

620
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,840
There's a chef's table.

621
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:06,840
Yes.

622
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:09,000
Because she went on to do Mozza.

623
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Yes.

624
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:18,560
And Libraea Bakery originally opened two supply bread for a restaurant called Campanile, which

625
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:19,560
closed in 2012.

626
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:25,520
A Jane's Beard Award winner that Nancy Silverton and her husband also opened.

627
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:31,040
But Libraea Bakery beat it by six months and then became this kind of Southern California

628
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,320
institution.

629
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:38,680
They were just bread slaves for Campanile and then they busted out and replaced and

630
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:39,680
crushed Campanile.

631
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:40,680
Yeah.

632
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:44,400
And now you can find Libraea Bakery stuff like everywhere.

633
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,600
Grocery stores and airports.

634
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:47,600
Is it worldwide?

635
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:50,720
I don't know how far it goes.

636
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,720
But you find a lot of places here.

637
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:58,400
As I was reading about it, I was like, man, they should have had more of this in the California

638
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:05,160
Adventure Park, but it may have been competing with Boodwin Bakery from San Francisco.

639
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,160
The San Bernardino.

640
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,160
Yeah.

641
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:08,160
I think maybe.

642
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,160
Yeah.

643
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:10,680
They had a massive Papa Steve's joint.

644
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:11,680
Right.

645
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,520
So Papa Steve probably wanted to keep Libraea out.

646
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,120
That was part of the deal.

647
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,120
Probably.

648
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,120
Yeah.

649
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,120
Oh yeah.

650
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:20,000
Do you think there was a turf war between Nancy Silverton and Papa Steve?

651
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Yeah, they hate each other.

652
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
There's no doubt about it.

653
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
They gotta hate each other.

654
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,360
It's a shame they both make good bread.

655
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:28,400
Papa Steve's last words.

656
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:32,800
Fuck Nancy Silverton.

657
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:38,280
There was a whole mob bread war going on between the two companies, maybe?

658
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:40,800
Because I would assume it's a competitive field.

659
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:44,320
Everything's competitive when you're talking about retail bread.

660
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,320
I would think so.

661
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,320
Yeah.

662
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:49,920
Do you think they built bread bombs and tried to infiltrate each other's buildings?

663
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:53,720
I think a bread bowl contains a bomb very easily.

664
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:56,960
Let alone a bread box if you really want to cause some damage.

665
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:04,320
That's the sneaking the prison escape tools scene in the movie of the future is, and it's

666
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:08,200
not a cake anymore because now prison guards are looking out for knives and cakes.

667
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,880
They put a bomb in a bread bowl.

668
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,920
Put a bomb in a bread bowl.

669
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:16,120
It's what really they should have Ma Beagle do on the new DuckTales when she's trying

670
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:18,320
to break her Beagle boys out of prison.

671
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,320
DuckTales, yeah.

672
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,320
Yeah.

673
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:23,520
Do you know the new one or the old one, Sector Keeper?

674
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,520
New one?

675
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:25,520
There's a new one.

676
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:26,800
Yeah, there's a new one in the last couple of years.

677
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:30,320
Although maybe you don't know about the old one or maybe no, you do know about the old

678
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,320
one.

679
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:33,480
Yeah, I love the old one.

680
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:39,360
One thing you should know is that when you were frozen in time, everything now is a new

681
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:43,280
version of something from when you were frozen in time.

682
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,280
Why?

683
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,280
I don't know.

684
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:49,720
Everyone decided that those things do better even though that's not accurate and has been

685
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:52,720
proven inaccurate many, many, many times.

686
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:56,960
But yeah, if you like something, chances are there has been a new version that's been canceled

687
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:57,960
already.

688
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:02,840
There's going to be a new version or there's currently a new version on the air or in theaters.

689
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:03,840
Why?

690
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:10,880
Well, I think at the end of history, you don't need to make a new history.

691
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:14,080
You're just running out the clock waiting for it to wrap up, right?

692
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:16,480
That's sort of a philosophical answer, I think.

693
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:24,440
The answer I would give is that it's a conservative way for corporations to feel safe in making

694
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,600
decisions about new shows and movies.

695
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,480
Do you know about private equity?

696
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,480
You know what?

697
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:30,480
It's too much to get into now.

698
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:34,440
A lot of fear based stuff going on nowadays.

699
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:42,360
I ate at 8 a.m. a scrambled eggs, bacon, potato and sourdough platter from La Brea Express.

700
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:43,840
At 8 a.m. today?

701
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:46,440
No, that would be really good if I-

702
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:49,600
It went down there, but yeah, what a surprise.

703
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:53,960
And it was right before the park opened and it was fine.

704
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:58,400
I'll say it was fine.

705
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:04,400
I feel like it wasn't anything special, maybe.

706
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:09,760
I think we should establish the drinking game with this series that when we say fine, you

707
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:10,760
take a shot.

708
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:11,760
Yeah.

709
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:12,760
Reliable though.

710
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:14,760
Like starting your day off.

711
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:15,760
You mean you won't see-

712
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:16,760
It was filling.

713
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:17,760
There won't be a bug in your meal.

714
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:18,760
I don't know.

715
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:19,760
I didn't think he'd do that.

716
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:20,760
The bread's good.

717
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:23,400
The baked goods are good.

718
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:25,280
I will say the bread is fine.

719
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:27,920
I've never found the bread like special or anything.

720
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,240
Anytime I've ever had the bread.

721
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:35,160
I bet if you went in 2001, the bread is special, but as all brands decay-

722
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:37,440
Yes, that's probably right.

723
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:40,360
And I think you can buy sourdough bread everywhere.

724
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:46,240
I guess not like it was invented in 2001 by any means, but I like sourdough bread a lot.

725
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:51,760
I guess also maybe my problem is that sourdough bread isn't maybe my number one go-to bread.

726
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,200
Sometimes you get a good piece at a restaurant.

727
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,600
If you're at maybe a slightly better restaurant.

728
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:56,600
I had two slices.

729
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:57,600
At a steakhouse, perhaps.

730
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:59,640
I had two slices for breakfast.

731
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:00,640
Of sourdough bread?

732
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:03,120
I had scrambled eggs and sourdough toast.

733
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:04,120
Yeah.

734
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:05,120
Interesting.

735
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:07,000
How big is a piece of sourdough toast?

736
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,040
It depends on how the loaf is cut.

737
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:10,040
Some sourdough loaves are really big.

738
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:11,040
Are you cutting your own loaf?

739
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:15,640
No, it's just Ralph, whatever Kroger brand at Ralph's.

740
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:17,120
It's a smaller.

741
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:18,520
They were smaller.

742
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:20,440
That's a pretty decent size piece that you're doing there.

743
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:23,840
You're doing like the lens on the film director when he's imagining the scene.

744
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:25,680
One was the end.

745
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:27,240
The one piece was the end.

746
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:28,240
Okay.

747
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:29,400
Then the other piece I put some eggs on.

748
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:30,400
Do you toast it?

749
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:31,400
Sourdough toast.

750
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:32,400
Yeah, that's why I said I toast it.

751
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,160
Oh yeah, you did say that.

752
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:35,160
It tends to keep longer.

753
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:38,160
I usually freeze bread anyway after a few days.

754
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:39,160
I find it so hard.

755
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:41,920
I like a little softer bread.

756
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:43,480
I'll eat a hard piece of bread.

757
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:45,680
I like the California pizza kitchen.

758
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:46,680
Is that sourdough?

759
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:47,680
Those little pieces?

760
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:48,680
Those are ciabatta.

761
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:49,680
Good little dipping.

762
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:53,480
Great dipping oil in the little surf.

763
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:54,480
That's great.

764
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:55,480
That's ciabatta.

765
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:56,480
It's ciabatta.

766
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:57,480
I find that better, I think, than sourdough.

767
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:59,640
I find that cuts up the roof of my mouth.

768
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:00,640
Really?

769
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:03,520
I'm more of a focaccia man.

770
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:04,520
What's the difference between focaccia?

771
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:05,520
Focaccia is like the real thick.

772
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:06,520
Focaccia man.

773
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:11,920
Thick, kind of, sometimes the top's salty or oily.

774
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:15,400
I guess when it comes down to it, I'm just a soft bread kind of guy.

775
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:16,400
Okay.

776
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:20,960
Sector keeper, do you have a preference with harder soft bread?

777
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:25,440
Okay, I guess not.

778
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:26,440
Scott, what do you think?

779
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:28,480
I don't think I can picture.

780
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:32,000
I guess soft.

781
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Soft with no crust.

782
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,520
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

783
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:37,200
You're still a wonder bread guy.

784
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:38,200
You're a wonder bread guy.

785
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:39,200
PB&J.

786
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:40,200
Oh, fun.

787
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:41,200
That is fun, yeah.

788
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:42,200
Heavy on the J.

789
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:48,360
Have you ever had a PB&J jewel?

790
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:49,360
Those have got to be out there, right?

791
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:50,360
Whoa, that sounds good.

792
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:52,560
That's what you need to look for.

793
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:53,560
Yeah.

794
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:57,200
I've got mango mint, Reese's cup.

795
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:00,200
God, ugh, God damn it.

796
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:01,200
Ew.

797
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:03,400
Let's see what else I've got in my backpack.

798
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:04,840
Do you guys want some?

799
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:05,840
No.

800
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:07,200
No, I think I'm fine.

801
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:08,760
I've got a Fun Dip.

802
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:11,120
Oh, is that Big League Chew?

803
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:12,600
Big League Chew Grape.

804
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:13,600
Yeah.

805
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:14,600
You want some?

806
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:15,600
Well, maybe, honestly.

807
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:16,600
I'll leave you up to the show.

808
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:19,920
I just want the actual product, not the...

809
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:23,760
I'd eat some cotton candy before I'd have cotton candy jewel.

810
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:26,160
I've got cotton candy.

811
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:27,160
Nice.

812
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:28,160
Mint.

813
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:29,880
Cotton candy and another mint?

814
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:30,880
So it's all...

815
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:31,880
Yeah.

816
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:32,880
And then Reese's mint?

817
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:33,880
Yeah, they're all mint.

818
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:34,880
You have a mint.

819
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:40,040
You have a regular version of everything and then a mint version of it as well.

820
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:41,040
Do you need...

821
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:42,680
I feel like I...

822
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:45,040
Maybe between this one and the next one, I'll buy you...

823
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:47,680
I will buy you a peanut butter and jelly jewel.

824
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:48,680
Oh, yeah.

825
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:50,560
So before the next step is nice.

826
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:51,560
Oh, yeah.

827
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:53,120
Yeah, I'll hook you up.

828
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:54,280
We can't take you to the movie yet.

829
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:58,080
We don't have time, but yeah, I'll hook you up.

830
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:00,600
So I'm looking at La Brea Bakery's website.

831
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:03,760
Did you find all of their bragging on their website?

832
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:04,760
No.

833
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:05,760
Do you know what I'm talking about?

834
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:11,840
I know Silverton and her husband, what is his name, Peele, who opened the restaurant

835
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:12,840
with her.

836
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:14,800
I know they both worked with Wolfgang Puck.

837
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:16,960
Is that a brag?

838
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:17,960
I think it's kind of a brag.

839
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:18,960
Yeah, certainly in the 80s.

840
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:23,560
They just sort of list their accolades and the awards they've won and then it lists it

841
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:24,560
by year.

842
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:29,240
So then it'll just be like one thing a year and then they'll just miss a couple of years.

843
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:34,520
So it's like on the website, it'd be like, La Brea Bakery's Par Baked Sourdough Baguette

844
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:40,840
wins the competition against local sourdough breads to the surprise of San Francisco residents,

845
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:44,300
consumers known for their community allegiances.

846
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:45,300
This is in 1997.

847
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:46,300
LA, baby.

848
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:48,320
It's in the San Francisco Chronicle.

849
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:52,920
So they're like bragging that they beat some local San Francisco, like local bread maker.

850
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:55,280
San Francisco is such a sourdough town.

851
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:56,600
Yeah, it is a big town.

852
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:58,960
And yet the better version came from LA.

853
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:03,720
And this is of course, these are consumers known for their community allegiances, as

854
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:06,560
says on the bakery website.

855
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:07,640
They've confused these.

856
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:09,920
They're no longer an allegiant to their community.

857
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:14,680
Washington Post awards La Brea Bakery Sourdough Baguette with first place in their Artisan

858
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:15,680
Bread Roundup.

859
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:21,880
I mean, that's a big deal to win a roundup, a bread roundup, which of course, Jason's

860
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:25,680
judged a few bread roundups in his day.

861
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:29,200
Which is that that has to be some sort of country music type situation, right?

862
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:30,200
A roundup?

863
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:31,200
A roundup?

864
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,240
It sounds fun is what I'm getting at.

865
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:37,680
You have to, before you can eat it, you have to lasso it and get it over to you.

866
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:38,680
That's great.

867
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:39,680
That's very fun.

868
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:43,240
Jason really expertly lasso a bread and pull it hogtie it.

869
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:45,600
Harder ones are easier to catch.

870
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:47,360
You can stick some more.

871
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:52,600
2003, Oprah Winfrey features La Brea Bakery's granola on her talk show as one of Oprah's

872
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:54,600
favorite things for spring.

873
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:56,640
Wow, pretty good.

874
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:57,640
2004.

875
00:47:57,640 --> 00:47:59,960
Are they supposed to not talk about this on their website?

876
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:02,000
If Oprah gave me an award, I'd talk about it.

877
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:05,840
The Oprah one I get, the one where they like shit on the local bread makers.

878
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:07,200
Crushing local businesses.

879
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:12,440
2004, the Los Angeles Times declares La Brea Bakery its bread winner in the best of everything

880
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:13,440
issue.

881
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:17,920
It was making all the money for the paper.

882
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:21,680
And then the word sort of like dissipated a little bit.

883
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:23,120
And then it's just 2011.

884
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:27,680
It's like soft flour tortillas are introduced into our retail segment.

885
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:28,680
Wow.

886
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:31,240
Well, that's industry speak.

887
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:37,960
But I think at a certain point, a place becomes, like I would call La Brea Bakery in Southern

888
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:38,960
California ubiquitous.

889
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:39,960
Yeah.

890
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:41,880
It becomes less special because it's just everywhere.

891
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:48,400
Well, last thing, 2017 released Fortuna Demi Baguettes.

892
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:49,400
That's all it is.

893
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:50,400
I mean, I remember.

894
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:51,400
2017.

895
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:52,720
It's marked in my account.

896
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:54,080
I honor it every year.

897
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:55,640
Demi Baguettes have been released.

898
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:56,640
So I just.

899
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:57,640
Wow.

900
00:48:57,640 --> 00:49:00,560
I missed so much.

901
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:07,360
Most of what you've missed is La Brea Bakery tent pole news moments.

902
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:09,840
I want to make sure we aren't upsetting the apple cart here.

903
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:14,320
But I feel like by talking about all that stuff, we invisibly transitioned from La Brea Bakery

904
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:17,760
Express to La Brea Bakery Cafe or the company as a whole.

905
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:21,960
Do you have any, are there any poor rulings for what we just did?

906
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:23,680
Did you need to give us permission to move on?

907
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:24,680
No.

908
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:25,680
Felt seamless to me.

909
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:26,680
OK, good.

910
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:28,560
Because I got a lot of parent company stuff.

911
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:29,560
OK, good.

912
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:32,440
Not for this, but just in general for our journey.

913
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:33,440
Oh, OK.

914
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:34,440
Yes.

915
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:35,440
Yeah.

916
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:36,440
Yeah.

917
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:38,160
A lot of my stuff is parent company as well.

918
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:43,000
When we're talking about the sit down restaurant, we were there the other night and I passed

919
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:48,320
by a sign that they have hard kombucha and it is called June Shine.

920
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:49,760
Yes, I saw that.

921
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:51,200
I have not tried that yet.

922
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:52,880
What is it called again?

923
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:53,880
June Shine.

924
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:54,880
June Shine.

925
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:55,880
June Shine.

926
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:58,880
Seems up your alley, SK.

927
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:01,640
Yeah, it sounds like juice.

928
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:02,640
Maybe.

929
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:03,640
What is it?

930
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:05,360
I'm not a kombucha person.

931
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:07,600
Well, kombucha is.

932
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:08,600
There we go.

933
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:09,600
Ferment.

934
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:11,880
I am, but I like the one that tastes a little more candy ish.

935
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:13,000
A lot of some people hate it.

936
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:17,440
I think it's like it's almost like a tumeric or cilantro.

937
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:18,440
That's what I'm saying.

938
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:22,120
On a list of any item, Mike, you like the one that tastes a little more candy ish.

939
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:23,860
Yes, I do.

940
00:50:23,860 --> 00:50:29,320
But there's I think true kombucha is a lot more vinegary than because there's some that

941
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:33,840
are more like raw and natural that can be a little unpleasant.

942
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:40,080
But there's a version that's like tart cherry that Kavita I think may I forget which brand

943
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:42,440
it is that's very sugary.

944
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:46,960
So I imagine this liquor is a sugar, the sugary version of kombucha.

945
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:49,520
I don't think I like hard of things.

946
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:52,760
I think I like hard hard.

947
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:56,640
I like liquor that is liquor and not liquor put into lemonade.

948
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:57,640
Like hard seltzer?

949
00:50:57,640 --> 00:50:58,640
You don't like be a white claw boy?

950
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:00,640
Have you tried any white claw?

951
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:01,640
No.

952
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:02,640
Oh.

953
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:06,880
I mean, when you're old enough, buddy, Sector Keeper, you're going to.

954
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:07,880
It's a yeah.

955
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:10,040
We can't say all this liquor talk is going to be a problem.

956
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:11,040
It's low-cal.

957
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:12,040
It's going to be bad influences.

958
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:13,760
It's like low calorie hard water.

959
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:14,760
I like it.

960
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:19,960
It just tastes like, you know, LaCroix but with some alcohol in it.

961
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:20,960
Oh, LaCroix.

962
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:21,960
Gross.

963
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:22,960
LaCroix?

964
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:26,560
I want juice, man.

965
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:27,560
Give me the real stuff.

966
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:30,840
I want high C Capri Sun.

967
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:31,840
Sunny D?

968
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:34,120
Oh, yeah.

969
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:35,120
Cool commercials, too.

970
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:38,280
I'll say all those commercials have gotten a lot more boring.

971
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:42,680
And since you were a kid, there's less fake stuff in all of it.

972
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:47,520
I think like the fake stuff used to be now everything has to tout the natural nature.

973
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:52,920
But as a kid, you just drank all this fake shit, which is probably which probably made

974
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:55,680
you like fun and full of energy.

975
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:57,160
I gave you strength.

976
00:51:57,160 --> 00:51:58,160
Yes.

977
00:51:58,160 --> 00:51:59,160
Yeah, juice gives me strength.

978
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:00,720
Well, juice is a lot more boring now.

979
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:03,880
I'm sorry to tell you, there's been a shit which we'll encounter in the future.

980
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:06,560
Jamba Juice episode.

981
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:08,480
There's been a big turn away from juice.

982
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:10,120
I'm the sector keeper.

983
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:12,040
I'm sorry to say.

984
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:15,400
Who knew when you rescue me, I'd be living in hell.

985
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:16,400
What did better?

986
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:20,080
We're all in hell now.

987
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:24,240
I think the hard kombucha thing, though, is an interesting like the places that have stuck

988
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:27,920
around downtown Disney the most have had to keep up with the times.

989
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:32,160
And that's not something hard kombucha is something even five years ago.

990
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:34,600
I think people would be like, what are you talking like?

991
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:35,600
What?

992
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:36,600
For sure.

993
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:37,600
Yeah.

994
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:38,600
That's me now.

995
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:42,320
And I'm sure Labrea had to like deal with like the low carb craze.

996
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:46,320
I'm sure they had some sort of probably shitty tasting to accommodate.

997
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:48,520
Cut a big hole in the bread for a while.

998
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:49,520
Yeah.

999
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:50,520
Yeah.

1000
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:52,120
I've tried to even have soft bread.

1001
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:54,520
I have very little bread in the house in the apartment.

1002
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:55,520
Really?

1003
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:56,520
Very little.

1004
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:58,480
I don't eat even bread when I'm not unless I'm out.

1005
00:52:58,480 --> 00:52:59,480
Oh, yeah.

1006
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:00,480
Everybody hates bread now.

1007
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:01,480
Sector keeper.

1008
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:02,480
That's what?

1009
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:03,480
Yeah.

1010
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:04,480
Yeah.

1011
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:05,480
Bread is so out from the.

1012
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:06,480
Not me.

1013
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:07,480
I always buy bread.

1014
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:08,480
I'm a toast guy in the.

1015
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:09,480
Yeah, I got to.

1016
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:10,480
You buy and freeze.

1017
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:11,480
I do.

1018
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:12,480
Yeah.

1019
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:13,480
Freeze it.

1020
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:14,480
I do, too.

1021
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:15,480
Yeah.

1022
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:16,480
Do you freeze it to you?

1023
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:18,120
So you make toast from the frozen bread?

1024
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:19,120
Yeah.

1025
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:20,120
Yeah.

1026
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:21,120
OK.

1027
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:22,120
Very simple.

1028
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:23,120
Yeah.

1029
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:24,120
Easy.

1030
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:25,120
Makes it last longer.

1031
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:27,960
I don't buy it anymore.

1032
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:29,240
But it's everybody hates it.

1033
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:33,000
Everybody's like bread is so the food enemy at this.

1034
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,440
Or like it's like a like it's a little cheat.

1035
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:37,200
It's a little treat.

1036
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:38,200
It's a treat.

1037
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:39,200
Yeah.

1038
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:40,200
Right.

1039
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:41,200
I don't get it.

1040
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:42,200
You.

1041
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:43,200
You me both, brother.

1042
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:44,200
Yeah.

1043
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:45,200
Yeah.

1044
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:46,200
Just breathe it out.

1045
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:53,200
It is getting humid in here from all these plumes.

1046
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:54,200
It's thick.

1047
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:59,200
It's boredom coughs or just joy.

1048
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:02,080
My throat hurts.

1049
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:03,080
It could be both.

1050
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:04,080
Have we missed anything about both?

1051
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:05,080
Yeah.

1052
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:06,080
I see.

1053
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:07,080
Yeah.

1054
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:08,080
Yeah.

1055
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:09,080
I'm good on the Braille.

1056
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:10,080
You know, it's a fine sit down.

1057
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:11,680
If you want your sort of like eight dollar arugula salad.

1058
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:12,680
Yeah.

1059
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:18,120
If you're trying to fulfill that parking that, you know, validation obligation.

1060
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:19,120
Yes.

1061
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:20,120
Fine.

1062
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:21,600
And it's open before the park is open.

1063
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:22,600
Yes.

1064
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:24,840
So maybe that's a down to I don't know about the cafe.

1065
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:25,840
We're talking cafe.

1066
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:26,840
We moved on so.

1067
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:27,840
Yeah.

1068
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:32,240
I think any of the places that have breakfast usually open a little before the park.

1069
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:33,240
So yeah.

1070
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:35,520
So check it out if you want something that's fine.

1071
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:36,520
Yeah.

1072
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:37,520
Yeah.

1073
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:38,520
The fine drinking game.

1074
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:42,360
I think we're going to almost every establishment that is the highest price we will give.

1075
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:44,200
It's fine.

1076
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:47,120
So that being said, oh, you know, you know, it's around here.

1077
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:52,840
This we haven't actually and not unrelated to the to the the jewel that's in the air.

1078
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:57,480
I feel like this is a zone where you get a pretty big maple smell.

1079
00:54:57,480 --> 00:54:59,040
That fake Disney maple.

1080
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:00,760
Am I correct about that?

1081
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:03,320
Do you notice that around here specifically?

1082
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:06,160
You mean like it's like a breakfasty type smell?

1083
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:07,160
Yeah, I think so.

1084
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:12,000
Maybe coming from where trying to draw you where I think I think into La Brea Bakery.

1085
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,000
Oh, OK.

1086
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:16,600
Even though that's not the most maple a spot food wise.

1087
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:17,600
Yeah.

1088
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:19,800
I associate this zone with fake maple smell.

1089
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:22,400
I think maybe it's just trying to make you think about food in general.

1090
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:25,960
Yeah, it's like how and then I remember we have we had an argument about this and it

1091
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:27,400
was never fully resolved.

1092
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:33,320
But there's fried chicken smell when we came off of Space Mountain and you were telling

1093
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:35,440
me it was real and I was like, there's no way it's real.

1094
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:38,080
The restaurant's not even right by here.

1095
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:42,240
Well I was saying but I was saying down the strip, the plaza is like frying chicken all

1096
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:43,240
day.

1097
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:44,240
Right.

1098
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:47,680
All of those smells you smell are fake or like the majority of them because they're

1099
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:49,040
just trying to make your mouth water.

1100
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:51,200
It's like how you waited in line for a little while.

1101
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:52,480
Maybe you should get a bite to eat now.

1102
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:53,480
Yeah, yeah.

1103
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:54,840
Yeah, they're trying to trick you.

1104
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:55,840
Social engineering.

1105
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:56,840
I guess.

1106
00:55:56,840 --> 00:55:57,840
Psychological warfare.

1107
00:55:57,840 --> 00:55:58,840
I guess.

1108
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:06,440
That is how we that would be the way to break you is to pump a bunch of fried chicken smell

1109
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:09,640
into somewhere and then you can then there is no fried chicken.

1110
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:10,640
Yeah.

1111
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:14,160
Yeah, I think you got me begged.

1112
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:20,000
You were driving like Jesse Pinkman El Camino style with like a car full of those smells

1113
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,720
that you stole from backstage at Disneyland.

1114
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:26,760
Getting in a timely El Camino reference.

1115
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:27,760
Yeah, of course.

1116
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:28,760
It's out by now, honestly.

1117
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:29,760
So we all know.

1118
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:31,760
We all love it and we've all got to take some of it.

1119
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:33,880
But we don't have time for that today.

1120
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:36,200
No, but of course we know Gus Fring is alive.

1121
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:37,200
We know that.

1122
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:38,200
Sure.

1123
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:39,200
They're all alive.

1124
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:40,200
They're all resurrected.

1125
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:41,920
Everybody's watched it by now.

1126
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:43,880
Yes, everyone is alive.

1127
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:47,120
He's walking around in a zombie state with a half face.

1128
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:48,120
Gale is alive.

1129
00:56:48,120 --> 00:56:50,280
Or he picked up maybe what we didn't see.

1130
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:54,960
He fell to the ground after the bomb and then picked up also remarkably the same amount

1131
00:56:54,960 --> 00:57:00,720
of face was left from Hector and he just attached that, sewed it to himself with nursing home

1132
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:02,680
materials, patched it up.

1133
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:05,200
So as we all we all saw the movie, right?

1134
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:06,200
We all saw it.

1135
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:07,200
We saw it.

1136
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:08,200
Yeah.

1137
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:10,400
I thought it was cool how Gus Fring had a quarter of a Hector face.

1138
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:11,400
I think that was great.

1139
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:12,400
I loved the movie.

1140
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:13,400
I loved it too.

1141
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:14,400
I hope it's good.

1142
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:15,400
It was.

1143
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:18,400
I mean, I saw it and I loved it.

1144
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:21,160
Well, the Irishman was good for sure.

1145
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:22,160
We can all agree on that.

1146
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:24,640
The Irishman is three and a half hours long, I heard.

1147
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:26,120
Oh my God.

1148
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:27,120
210 minutes.

1149
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:31,320
Man, you put Jimmy Hoffa as a character in a movie.

1150
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:32,320
That movie gets long.

1151
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:33,320
All right.

1152
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:34,320
Maple smell.

1153
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:35,320
Great.

1154
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:36,320
Yeah.

1155
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:37,320
I'm all for those fake smells, by the way.

1156
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:38,320
Sure.

1157
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:39,320
Fountain.

1158
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:40,320
There's a big fountain, right?

1159
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:41,320
Oh yeah, we didn't talk about that.

1160
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:42,320
I'm sorry.

1161
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:43,320
I'm sorry.

1162
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:44,320
I'm sorry.

1163
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:45,320
I'm sorry.

1164
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:46,320
I'm sorry.

1165
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:47,320
We tried the landscaping and the architecture.

1166
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:48,320
I understand.

1167
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:49,320
Here's the thing, Sector Keeper.

1168
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:50,320
It is not a fountain that you can walk into.

1169
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:53,120
You would have to make a point of jumping in there.

1170
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:56,720
Some people would argue you shouldn't walk into any of the fountains.

1171
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:59,320
I imagine you more than anyone would argue that.

1172
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:00,320
Yeah, you number one.

1173
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:01,320
Yeah.

1174
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:02,320
Yes.

1175
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:03,320
But it is blocked off.

1176
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:04,320
You can't walk around in there.

1177
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:05,320
Do you guys know the name of the fountain?

1178
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:06,320
It has a name.

1179
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:07,320
Oh, I missed that.

1180
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:09,320
It's the Poppy Fountain.

1181
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:10,320
Really?

1182
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:11,320
Oh, it looks like a poppy.

1183
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:12,320
It looks like a poppy.

1184
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:13,320
Oh yeah.

1185
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:18,480
You know, one of those things that doesn't occur to you for 18 years of a place being

1186
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:23,040
open and passing by it dozens and dozens of times.

1187
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:24,320
Hundreds for me.

1188
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:29,600
Because they want you to, as I've said before, respect those who passed in the fields of

1189
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:30,600
Flanders.

1190
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:32,880
Oh, it's a tribute to that.

1191
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:33,880
It's a tribute to that.

1192
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:34,880
Yes, of course.

1193
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:37,560
Like from so many episodes ago.

1194
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:43,240
So you would pass by what's obviously a poppy and then you would go see what was obviously

1195
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:49,160
a picture postcard tiled mosaic entry to California Adventure.

1196
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:50,160
Right.

1197
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:51,520
I feel like it's a remnant of that.

1198
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:52,520
Like what it is?

1199
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:54,160
What's this supposed to be?

1200
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:55,520
Yes, yeah, yeah.

1201
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:57,360
So you're looking at it right now.

1202
00:58:57,360 --> 00:58:58,640
Yeah, it's orange.

1203
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:02,440
It's kind of like, there's a lot of things like this in downtown Disney.

1204
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:03,440
This was very much when it opened.

1205
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:08,600
It was full of petals and even the monorail station is supposed to be like Palm, they're

1206
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:09,600
banana Lee.

1207
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:10,600
I don't know.

1208
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:11,600
I don't know.

1209
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:18,320
That is like, yes, that is inspired by Tivoli Gardens.

1210
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:25,520
If you're takeaway from Tivoli Gardens is like the dictionary defines gardens as places

1211
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:27,000
where flowers live.

1212
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:32,000
It's like these big moody to it's kind of like, yes, gardens, flower.

1213
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,680
Big flower.

1214
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:37,240
Also strong smell emanating from that.

1215
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:38,240
That's very chloriney.

1216
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:39,240
Yes, yes, yes.

1217
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:40,240
Over there.

1218
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:43,720
We were discussing, didn't there used to be a sign over there that said downtown Disney

1219
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:45,200
and now there is not?

1220
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:52,520
Well they had moved the security checkpoints, which used to be sort of right there and now

1221
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:55,340
there before you even get on the tram.

1222
00:59:55,340 --> 00:59:59,160
So that caused a removal of the sign.

1223
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:03,720
So I think it was part of the, I could be totally misremembering this, but it was kind

1224
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:08,240
of part of the whole setup there and they opened it up now and now it's just sort of.

1225
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:11,040
I think it kind of got pushed further into the Esplanade.

1226
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:15,320
Man, that was a real bad choke point when bag check was there.

1227
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:17,320
Yeah, man, that was a very good move.

1228
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:18,320
Yeah, that did for sure.

1229
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:19,320
They did open it up.

1230
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:22,040
But we all went down there together.

1231
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:26,280
We all took a trip with our teenage ghostly friend.

1232
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:28,520
Ward, I think that's right.

1233
01:00:28,520 --> 01:00:32,960
Ward, our young Ward, the sector keeper.

1234
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:37,560
And you were saying, you were like, is this it?

1235
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:39,360
When does downtown Disney start?

1236
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:40,800
There's no clear entry point.

1237
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:48,400
There's no sign, really no thought put into it.

1238
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:51,120
There's a sign by the abandoned ESPN zone.

1239
01:00:51,120 --> 01:00:52,960
Oh yeah, I guess.

1240
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:55,440
If you're coming from that way.

1241
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:56,560
Which we were that time.

1242
01:00:56,560 --> 01:00:59,600
But then the other way, there's no sign, which is why we had to make that.

1243
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:02,160
We have that discussion of is the Honda the beginning?

1244
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:06,920
But when Honda is gone, which I imagine it's not a permanent fixture.

1245
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:09,000
A galaxy is promoting Honda.

1246
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:10,320
Then how do we know where it starts?

1247
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:14,400
I think it's the the end of the outdoor seating area.

1248
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:15,400
I think the Honda.

1249
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:22,760
What a shitty entry point is that table and two chairs is the beginning of downtown Disney.

1250
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:23,760
Hmm.

1251
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:25,560
They got to fix this.

1252
01:01:25,560 --> 01:01:26,840
They have to fix it somehow.

1253
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:27,840
I don't know how they're going to do it.

1254
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:29,600
Honestly, I don't even have a good plus up for it.

1255
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:30,600
A sign.

1256
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:33,920
This is what keeps you boys up at night.

1257
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:36,920
You're not wrong.

1258
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:38,720
This is how we spend our lives.

1259
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:39,720
That's a good point.

1260
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:42,280
But what about a place that just recently got a plus up?

1261
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:44,520
The massive world of Disney store.

1262
01:01:44,520 --> 01:01:45,520
Yeah.

1263
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:46,520
Yeah.

1264
01:01:46,520 --> 01:01:48,160
Sexy Keeper like this a lot.

1265
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:49,160
Yeah, this is fun.

1266
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:50,160
Full of toys.

1267
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:51,160
Full of toys.

1268
01:01:51,160 --> 01:01:58,520
It now looks something like a pure one imports ram head first into an Apple store.

1269
01:01:58,520 --> 01:02:01,280
There's a lot of popcorn bowl.

1270
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:02,280
Brick now.

1271
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:03,280
A lot of brick.

1272
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:04,280
A lot of brick in this.

1273
01:02:04,280 --> 01:02:08,680
A lot of spots of like, hey, maybe you buy that and then you hold it against under this

1274
01:02:08,680 --> 01:02:15,440
big sign that says like, um, I don't know what the signs a lot of Instagram shit.

1275
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:16,440
Oh, I see.

1276
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:17,440
That's a very Instagram.

1277
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:18,440
I think it's got to come up a lot.

1278
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:19,440
There's some cool people in engineering.

1279
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:25,560
Light up letter like the that's that thing that everything has where it's a big letters

1280
01:02:25,560 --> 01:02:27,320
with light bulbs in the middle.

1281
01:02:27,320 --> 01:02:28,320
Yeah.

1282
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:33,560
They put that in that and like knew who the sign of hip from starting in what?

1283
01:02:33,560 --> 01:02:38,760
2013 a bunch of stuffed bolts under a popcorn light bulbs that say squad.

1284
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:39,760
Yeah.

1285
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:40,760
Yes.

1286
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:41,760
Hold up your bowl.

1287
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:42,760
Hold up your stuffed bowl.

1288
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:43,760
Oh yeah.

1289
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:48,960
You, you and yeah, I will post a picture of you in bowl.

1290
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:50,720
You were very delighted by bowl.

1291
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:51,720
Yeah.

1292
01:02:51,720 --> 01:02:55,440
Good to see Disney's bowl voiced by who was the voice?

1293
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:57,440
A very normal John Travolta.

1294
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:58,480
Oh yes.

1295
01:02:58,480 --> 01:02:59,480
Our normal friend.

1296
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:01,520
You should get him on the pod.

1297
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:02,520
Yeah, we should.

1298
01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:07,000
I don't think it'll be that hard and just only ask him about that music video with his

1299
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:08,000
daughter.

1300
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,040
She's not every little step.

1301
01:03:10,040 --> 01:03:11,040
Yeah.

1302
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:12,040
Yeah.

1303
01:03:12,040 --> 01:03:13,040
Brown cover.

1304
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:14,040
Yeah.

1305
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:15,040
Oh yeah.

1306
01:03:15,040 --> 01:03:16,040
Disney.

1307
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:17,040
Yeah.

1308
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:19,080
Disney has some basic.

1309
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:20,080
Okay.

1310
01:03:20,080 --> 01:03:21,080
There's maybe a couple of episodes.

1311
01:03:21,080 --> 01:03:23,240
So yeah, maybe a couple of episodes worth of things.

1312
01:03:23,240 --> 01:03:27,640
Sager Kiefer, what happened since you were frozen is that John Travolta, the dad from

1313
01:03:27,640 --> 01:03:28,640
Look Who's Talking.

1314
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:29,640
Oh yeah.

1315
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:30,640
Came back in a big way.

1316
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:32,720
It was the coolest actor on the planet.

1317
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:36,720
And then since then it all ended and he's not anymore.

1318
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:37,720
Huh?

1319
01:03:37,720 --> 01:03:38,720
Yeah.

1320
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:41,320
Kind of went on a strange Odyssey.

1321
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:43,160
But broken arrow rules.

1322
01:03:43,160 --> 01:03:45,680
Oh, you do like you did get broken arrow.

1323
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:48,120
Broken arrow has got some fun parts in it, I will say.

1324
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:49,120
Yeah.

1325
01:03:49,120 --> 01:03:53,000
As you're sort of like reacclimating to the world and forming belief systems, just stay

1326
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
away from battlefield earth.

1327
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:56,000
Don't watch them.

1328
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:57,000
I know it looks cool and he looks cool.

1329
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,000
Sounds cool.

1330
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1331
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:02,840
But I'd say stick with like Star Wars if you want sci-fi and not, you just might get some

1332
01:04:02,840 --> 01:04:04,840
weird lessons out of battlefield earth.

1333
01:04:04,840 --> 01:04:05,840
Okay.

1334
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:06,840
Yeah.

1335
01:04:06,840 --> 01:04:11,080
Just advice from me to you, my young ward.

1336
01:04:11,080 --> 01:04:15,280
I think another thing you see in the world of Disney that you see a lot of Disney merchandise

1337
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:22,100
outlets now is like the stuff catered to our generation, the older millennials starting

1338
01:04:22,100 --> 01:04:30,320
to have more disposable income who will never buy a house, but have a little money to buy

1339
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:32,440
a shirt of Chippendale Dabbing.

1340
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:33,440
Here's the thing.

1341
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:34,440
I will say.

1342
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:39,120
I want that shirt with Chippendale Dabbing.

1343
01:04:39,120 --> 01:04:40,480
I shouldn't buy it, right?

1344
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:41,480
I don't have a job.

1345
01:04:41,480 --> 01:04:44,240
If I have a job though, the first thing I'm going to do is head down there and get that

1346
01:04:44,240 --> 01:04:45,400
Chippendale Dabbing shirt.

1347
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:47,920
Your job is called the Downtown Disney or Deal.

1348
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:49,520
That's a good point.

1349
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:50,720
That's a good point.

1350
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:53,760
Maybe right after this I'll go down and get the Dabbing shirt.

1351
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:55,120
Very rewarding job.

1352
01:04:55,120 --> 01:05:00,640
I don't think there, we'll talk about this, I assume somehow.

1353
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:05,140
There used to be a place called D Street in Downtown Disney, which would cater a little

1354
01:05:05,140 --> 01:05:07,800
bit more to this type of consumer.

1355
01:05:07,800 --> 01:05:10,760
Now they folded it into world of Disney.

1356
01:05:10,760 --> 01:05:15,440
I still don't feel that I am being catered to enough in world of Disney.

1357
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:19,680
But don't you think arts case are very specific?

1358
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:24,680
There is an upswing of Disney afternoon stuff, but it is a little generic.

1359
01:05:24,680 --> 01:05:25,680
Yes.

1360
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:29,880
I think it's slowly getting there, but I still like those cool, they have shirts now, there's

1361
01:05:29,880 --> 01:05:34,320
those cool like a Disneyland, it's yellow and it's got the kind of multicolored logo.

1362
01:05:34,320 --> 01:05:38,080
That's getting a little bit closer to our aesthetic, I think.

1363
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:41,440
The designs are getting nicer.

1364
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:45,000
The material of the shirts is still a total crap shoot.

1365
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:46,000
Yes, it depends.

1366
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:49,880
Of what country they were made of, what factory they were made of, what color the shirt is.

1367
01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:52,760
It's still a lot of Hanes beefy tees.

1368
01:05:52,760 --> 01:05:53,760
Yeah.

1369
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:56,360
It is still a majority Hanes beefy tees.

1370
01:05:56,360 --> 01:05:58,720
They were doing, is that your favorite shirt?

1371
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:00,200
Yeah, that's all I have.

1372
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:01,680
Yeah, it's pretty baggy.

1373
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:03,680
I mean, I guess the styles were.

1374
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:04,680
Thick, thick too.

1375
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:08,520
The thick cotton that goes down to my knees.

1376
01:06:08,520 --> 01:06:11,360
Kind of coming back in style, the baggy.

1377
01:06:11,360 --> 01:06:12,360
It is.

1378
01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:13,360
It is.

1379
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:15,400
The beefier the better.

1380
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:23,460
Yeah, well that's, you can go world Disney and 90% of the shirts are Hanes beefy tees.

1381
01:06:23,460 --> 01:06:29,200
They had this series of shirts called Yester Ears that we all have a couple of, which really

1382
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:30,880
cool retro-y designs.

1383
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:32,800
They've stopped doing them apparently.

1384
01:06:32,800 --> 01:06:37,400
Is that the one where before we were doing the podcast, we all group did an order.

1385
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:40,040
Yes, to get a Disney World Village shirts.

1386
01:06:40,040 --> 01:06:41,040
To get a discount.

1387
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:45,960
We all bought shirts that had the Walt Disney World Village logo on it.

1388
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:48,440
We should all bring them to Florida according to where I go.

1389
01:06:48,440 --> 01:06:49,440
Yeah, that's not a bad idea.

1390
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:50,440
That's kind of cute.

1391
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:51,440
When we go there.

1392
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:52,440
But we've already done it.

1393
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:53,440
That's in the past.

1394
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:54,440
Oh yes.

1395
01:06:54,440 --> 01:06:55,440
We've been to Florida and we're back.

1396
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:56,440
That's right.

1397
01:06:56,440 --> 01:06:57,720
I bought a Country Bears shirt from there.

1398
01:06:57,720 --> 01:06:59,400
I have maybe one or two other ones.

1399
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:03,520
Why did it take Nick Mundy saying, hey do a theme park podcast to make us realize we

1400
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:07,120
all, the three of us without, we didn't know this was in the cards and we all bought the

1401
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:09,120
same shirt together.

1402
01:07:09,120 --> 01:07:12,680
There's a lot of things that we've done that you would think, oh well they knew they were

1403
01:07:12,680 --> 01:07:15,800
eventually going to like, they just did that to talk about it eventually.

1404
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:17,440
And it's like, no, that's not a.

1405
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:19,040
We would have done that for free.

1406
01:07:19,040 --> 01:07:21,920
We would have done it for free.

1407
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:24,120
So I just, they're not getting there yet.

1408
01:07:24,120 --> 01:07:25,440
They're not hitting that sweet spot.

1409
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:30,840
I guess they assume that maybe the audience isn't there for stuff like that, I guess.

1410
01:07:30,840 --> 01:07:37,680
But that's still, I would love a little like nook in world of Disney just for maniacs like

1411
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:38,680
us.

1412
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:42,240
Well they do have a shirt that says I'm so fly I never land.

1413
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:44,240
And who's on that?

1414
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:46,480
I don't know, Tinkerbell apparently.

1415
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:47,480
Okay.

1416
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:48,480
Or Peter Pan.

1417
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:52,280
It's like a, like hashtag Bay and the Beast.

1418
01:07:52,280 --> 01:07:55,160
Like that's the type of shirt that'll be.

1419
01:07:55,160 --> 01:07:58,680
Market they're cornering is current slang mixed with old characters.

1420
01:07:58,680 --> 01:07:59,680
Yes.

1421
01:07:59,680 --> 01:08:01,560
Which is good for Jason, but maybe not for Scott and I.

1422
01:08:01,560 --> 01:08:02,560
Yeah.

1423
01:08:02,560 --> 01:08:03,560
Sure.

1424
01:08:03,560 --> 01:08:04,560
Yeah.

1425
01:08:04,560 --> 01:08:05,560
Jason loves it.

1426
01:08:05,560 --> 01:08:06,560
But the dabbing I like.

1427
01:08:06,560 --> 01:08:10,440
We aren't saying we're here for things as much as Jason is.

1428
01:08:10,440 --> 01:08:11,440
Right.

1429
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:16,080
There's like, I'm trying to think, it's like a picture, a stitch on a shirt that says hashtag

1430
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:17,080
sicko mode.

1431
01:08:17,080 --> 01:08:18,080
Oh sure.

1432
01:08:18,080 --> 01:08:19,080
And that's Jason.

1433
01:08:19,080 --> 01:08:20,080
That's Jason.

1434
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:23,320
Flounder like swimming along and it says this slaps.

1435
01:08:23,320 --> 01:08:30,000
This is pots and chip and it says that's the tea.

1436
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:31,000
They don't have that one.

1437
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:32,000
Yeah.

1438
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:33,000
That's usual.

1439
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:34,840
We're giving the gold away for free.

1440
01:08:34,840 --> 01:08:35,840
Yeah.

1441
01:08:35,840 --> 01:08:38,720
It's a lot of that, which again, I don't, I don't dislike all of it.

1442
01:08:38,720 --> 01:08:45,320
I just wish like, I was trying to think of truly like what some of our like ultimate

1443
01:08:45,320 --> 01:08:46,880
merch items would be.

1444
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:49,720
And let me ask you this, Jason, because I really only, the best thing I could think

1445
01:08:49,720 --> 01:08:52,600
of was what this was for you.

1446
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:59,600
Would you buy the authentic John from carousel of progress is rocking chair if they made

1447
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:04,840
a recreation of it and maybe they, it came with his like fanning his like little fan

1448
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:07,280
that he fans himself with when it's a hot summer day.

1449
01:09:07,280 --> 01:09:08,280
Yeah.

1450
01:09:08,280 --> 01:09:09,280
A hundred percent.

1451
01:09:09,280 --> 01:09:10,280
It's going to be that rocking chair.

1452
01:09:10,280 --> 01:09:11,280
Yeah.

1453
01:09:11,280 --> 01:09:13,800
I'm just trying to think of the ultimate piece of niche.

1454
01:09:13,800 --> 01:09:15,920
I guess he's in the kitchen.

1455
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:19,520
My grandparents did have a kitchen that looked a lot like his kitchen.

1456
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:20,520
Yeah.

1457
01:09:20,520 --> 01:09:21,520
So like the John.

1458
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:22,520
Okay.

1459
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:26,200
So you would also buy like the John collection of all his outfits over the years.

1460
01:09:26,200 --> 01:09:27,200
Yeah.

1461
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:29,000
I just want any John merchandise.

1462
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,520
Like there was one, the John line.

1463
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:36,600
There was one.

1464
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:39,360
I think there was hashtag live your John.

1465
01:09:39,360 --> 01:09:40,360
Hashtag live your John.

1466
01:09:40,360 --> 01:09:41,360
Which John are you?

1467
01:09:41,360 --> 01:09:46,080
Which decade John are you?

1468
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:47,080
Or uncle Orville.

1469
01:09:47,080 --> 01:09:48,080
Uncle Orville.

1470
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:51,480
Like no privacy at all in here.

1471
01:09:51,480 --> 01:09:52,480
Sure.

1472
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:53,480
Yeah.

1473
01:09:53,480 --> 01:09:56,280
But I'm talking about like a high end clothing line.

1474
01:09:56,280 --> 01:10:00,080
That's all of John's outfits from the, I'm not just like, not just a picture of John.

1475
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:01,080
Yeah.

1476
01:10:01,080 --> 01:10:02,080
I want you to dress.

1477
01:10:02,080 --> 01:10:03,080
Like the Lord of the Rings sword replica.

1478
01:10:03,080 --> 01:10:04,080
Yes.

1479
01:10:04,080 --> 01:10:06,360
This is high end as it comes.

1480
01:10:06,360 --> 01:10:11,000
This is, I guess that's maybe sort of what I guess maybe there's not a huge market for

1481
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:12,000
that, but like what would be the.

1482
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:13,000
I would consider it.

1483
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:18,380
Or like the alien encounter alien, like the tube with like the aliens sticking in.

1484
01:10:18,380 --> 01:10:24,000
If they sold obviously like a life life size Rex Scott, I think you're in for that.

1485
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:29,720
Well my answer would have been a full photo reel captain EO suit.

1486
01:10:29,720 --> 01:10:33,440
If I could get like the exact full, but now I'm arrested.

1487
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:35,480
I was going to say maybe that's not a good idea.

1488
01:10:35,480 --> 01:10:36,480
Yeah.

1489
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:39,040
That would have been the answer at one point in time.

1490
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:41,280
What about just like a life size Hooter?

1491
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:42,280
Oh yeah.

1492
01:10:42,280 --> 01:10:44,440
Hooters in my, yeah.

1493
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:45,440
They aren't all canceled.

1494
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:46,440
Are they?

1495
01:10:46,440 --> 01:10:47,440
No, no, they're fine.

1496
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:49,480
I have a little plush fuzz ball in my home.

1497
01:10:49,480 --> 01:10:51,880
You have a plush fuzz ball, but what if it was the real one?

1498
01:10:51,880 --> 01:10:52,880
Oh yeah.

1499
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:53,880
And it flew.

1500
01:10:53,880 --> 01:10:54,880
It flew.

1501
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:55,880
A drone fuzz ball.

1502
01:10:55,880 --> 01:10:56,880
Yes.

1503
01:10:56,880 --> 01:10:57,880
Make this happen.

1504
01:10:57,880 --> 01:10:58,880
Oh, abs.

1505
01:10:58,880 --> 01:10:59,880
There you go.

1506
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:00,880
Absolutely.

1507
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:04,400
I was going to say, say shirt wise, if I could get a shirt that lit up with the neon tumbling

1508
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:06,040
Mickey's from tomorrow land.

1509
01:11:06,040 --> 01:11:07,040
Oh, that's a great idea.

1510
01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:08,040
That's a great idea.

1511
01:11:08,040 --> 01:11:09,040
In that pattern.

1512
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:10,040
Yeah.

1513
01:11:10,040 --> 01:11:11,040
Yeah.

1514
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:12,040
That's my dream shirt.

1515
01:11:12,040 --> 01:11:13,040
That's great.

1516
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:14,040
What about you, Mike?

1517
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:15,040
Honestly, I.

1518
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:16,040
Like I would call it out big Al you could crawl inside of.

1519
01:11:16,040 --> 01:11:23,840
I think a country bear instruments maybe like big Al's guitar or something that was a playable

1520
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:30,160
and Mike or like a little piano or a mouth harp harmonica.

1521
01:11:30,160 --> 01:11:31,520
Something like that.

1522
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:36,880
I think I just wish there was a niche, a little corner that you would like every couple of

1523
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:41,320
months they would just put out the most insane thing for maniacs like us.

1524
01:11:41,320 --> 01:11:42,320
Sure.

1525
01:11:42,320 --> 01:11:43,320
Oh my God.

1526
01:11:43,320 --> 01:11:44,320
They did this.

1527
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:45,320
Who's going to buy this?

1528
01:11:45,320 --> 01:11:47,160
And then I would buy it.

1529
01:11:47,160 --> 01:11:48,960
So as long as one person.

1530
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:50,240
Yeah, it's fun.

1531
01:11:50,240 --> 01:11:53,480
It's fun to get like a corner of that market a little more.

1532
01:11:53,480 --> 01:11:55,200
That's so much fabrication though.

1533
01:11:55,200 --> 01:12:01,040
I feel like they just kind of default to like, hey, what about this Hawaiian shirt version?

1534
01:12:01,040 --> 01:12:02,040
This.

1535
01:12:02,040 --> 01:12:08,200
Yes, I get, I get there trying to turn wallpaper by doing, putting all of the, like putting,

1536
01:12:08,200 --> 01:12:14,920
you know, Mulan on a shirt and then it says, nevertheless, she persisted.

1537
01:12:14,920 --> 01:12:17,160
That's what they, that's where the market is right now.

1538
01:12:17,160 --> 01:12:22,280
That is that they look, they know what they're doing.

1539
01:12:22,280 --> 01:12:26,760
They know exactly what is going to sell.

1540
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:31,080
So the most 2019 shirt.

1541
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:34,400
You know what they did actually in this area that is good.

1542
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:41,520
We do remember we, we encountered those notebooks that look like the old clam shell, the VHS.

1543
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:42,520
It's a, yeah.

1544
01:12:42,520 --> 01:12:43,520
Yeah.

1545
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:47,160
It looks like an old beauty and the beast, the thick VHS case.

1546
01:12:47,160 --> 01:12:50,920
That's a great, that's, that's getting into our, that's getting there for sure.

1547
01:12:50,920 --> 01:12:53,600
VHS has gone, such a keeper.

1548
01:12:53,600 --> 01:13:00,200
It's all these things, streamers and like they, they like organized it to where now

1549
01:13:00,200 --> 01:13:04,040
it's just a couple of streamers and to afford all of them, it's more expensive than all

1550
01:13:04,040 --> 01:13:07,700
of your VHSs and cable channels put together.

1551
01:13:07,700 --> 01:13:12,480
You can still find DVDs, which are like if movies were on CDs, they look like CDs.

1552
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:13,480
Yes.

1553
01:13:13,480 --> 01:13:14,480
I know.

1554
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:15,480
Yes.

1555
01:13:15,480 --> 01:13:16,480
I know.

1556
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:17,480
Yes.

1557
01:13:17,480 --> 01:13:18,480
Yeah.

1558
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:19,480
But VHS gone.

1559
01:13:19,480 --> 01:13:20,480
VHS is gone.

1560
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:21,480
I'm sorry to say.

1561
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:24,080
Now you stream.

1562
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:28,400
Now you stream and all the, so don't try to go to a blockbuster.

1563
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:31,680
Don't try to get a job at a blockbuster because they're, they're a good put.

1564
01:13:31,680 --> 01:13:32,680
I was wondering.

1565
01:13:32,680 --> 01:13:34,440
Is that was your first thought?

1566
01:13:34,440 --> 01:13:35,440
Probably was.

1567
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:36,440
Yeah.

1568
01:13:36,440 --> 01:13:39,240
You wrote like jobs at blockbuster.com.

1569
01:13:39,240 --> 01:13:40,520
Yeah.

1570
01:13:40,520 --> 01:13:41,520
You knowing about email.

1571
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:42,520
Yes.

1572
01:13:42,520 --> 01:13:44,200
And then nobody responded.

1573
01:13:44,200 --> 01:13:45,200
No one.

1574
01:13:45,200 --> 01:13:47,800
Oh, this is a lot.

1575
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:49,320
Every day is a lot for me.

1576
01:13:49,320 --> 01:13:52,760
Every day you're discovering new terrible facts.

1577
01:13:52,760 --> 01:13:54,320
Nevertheless you persisted.

1578
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:55,320
Never.

1579
01:13:55,320 --> 01:13:56,320
Nevertheless.

1580
01:13:56,320 --> 01:13:57,320
Okay.

1581
01:13:57,320 --> 01:13:58,320
You that shirt.

1582
01:13:58,320 --> 01:14:05,200
I'd want, I'd want like a hockey stick from mighty ducks.

1583
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:09,680
Oh, which, which player was your favorite in the mighty ducks?

1584
01:14:09,680 --> 01:14:10,680
Fulton.

1585
01:14:10,680 --> 01:14:11,680
Oh yeah.

1586
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:14,320
He hit the puck hard.

1587
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:20,080
You know, uh, Keenan from mighty ducks too, essentially since you died has been on Saturday

1588
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:23,640
night live the whole, the entire time.

1589
01:14:23,640 --> 01:14:29,760
But I died over 30 years ago.

1590
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:32,520
The vast majority of it.

1591
01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:38,560
Your buddy, the hockey, the cool hockey player has been America's leading sketch man.

1592
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:41,600
You can be on SNL for decades.

1593
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:43,000
You can now the laws changed.

1594
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:49,000
It used to be like a two term rule, uh, like, like the presidency, but they, they destroyed

1595
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,800
that as they imagined that they will with the, with the presidency.

1596
01:14:51,800 --> 01:14:56,520
SNL went away then came back like others shows.

1597
01:14:56,520 --> 01:14:59,000
No still still going.

1598
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:00,560
Um, yeah.

1599
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:01,960
Um, yeah.

1600
01:15:01,960 --> 01:15:02,960
What's happened?

1601
01:15:02,960 --> 01:15:05,560
Uh, I mean, I mean a lot.

1602
01:15:05,560 --> 01:15:06,560
Yeah.

1603
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:11,000
It's uh, Alec Baldwin's basically a cast member now.

1604
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:12,000
What?

1605
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:13,000
From the shadow.

1606
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:16,000
It's in the beatlejuice, you know?

1607
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:17,000
Yeah.

1608
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:18,000
Yeah.

1609
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
Uh, sounds good.

1610
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:25,400
I, uh, does this sound, does this make it sound any more appealing that he's, uh, extremely

1611
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:26,400
angry?

1612
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:31,080
Uh, Rudy, Rudy Giuliani was mayor.

1613
01:15:31,080 --> 01:15:32,080
Remember the mayor?

1614
01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:33,080
I don't know.

1615
01:15:33,080 --> 01:15:34,880
That might be after his time, right?

1616
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:38,200
No, I think he, you might've cleaned up New York.

1617
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:41,000
Oh, of course.

1618
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:46,600
He was very briefly America's hero and now he is a great villain.

1619
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:49,600
In his later years, he's losing his mind.

1620
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:53,880
All right.

1621
01:15:53,880 --> 01:15:56,680
Anything else from world of Disney?

1622
01:15:56,680 --> 01:15:57,680
I forget.

1623
01:15:57,680 --> 01:16:01,160
Are we allowed to talk about the way it used to look in this?

1624
01:16:01,160 --> 01:16:02,960
This is what a lot of words.

1625
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:03,960
Encouraged.

1626
01:16:03,960 --> 01:16:04,960
Okay.

1627
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:05,960
Encouraged.

1628
01:16:05,960 --> 01:16:08,000
So basically, uh, like a couple of years ago, it's all, it's pretty new.

1629
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:13,120
They changed this around and the outside, first of all, the font, I will say, and the

1630
01:16:13,120 --> 01:16:18,280
logo and the store logo are basically looked like this.

1631
01:16:18,280 --> 01:16:19,520
And that is a little out.

1632
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:21,520
That looks like 2001 California adventure.

1633
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:22,800
It looks a little misty.

1634
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:23,800
Oh yes.

1635
01:16:23,800 --> 01:16:24,800
Yeah.

1636
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:25,800
Yeah.

1637
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:26,800
Steampunky.

1638
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:27,800
Steampunky.

1639
01:16:27,800 --> 01:16:28,800
And I think the new logo looks better.

1640
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:35,800
I think it looks more modern, but I will, I do lament the loss of this insane like Huey

1641
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:42,080
Dewey and Louie looking out of a giant, like, I don't know, telescope or something.

1642
01:16:42,080 --> 01:16:44,800
It's really big at the end and it's a giant eyeball.

1643
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:47,920
You can see their big, I never, I knew it was them.

1644
01:16:47,920 --> 01:16:48,920
I never made the connection.

1645
01:16:48,920 --> 01:16:49,920
It would be one of their eyes.

1646
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:53,240
I thought it was a contraption that had a giant eye.

1647
01:16:53,240 --> 01:16:54,240
It's Louie's eye.

1648
01:16:54,240 --> 01:16:55,240
Yeah.

1649
01:16:55,240 --> 01:16:56,240
Okay.

1650
01:16:56,240 --> 01:16:57,240
Cool.

1651
01:16:57,240 --> 01:16:58,240
Yeah.

1652
01:16:58,240 --> 01:17:02,640
So I do feel like I'm a little bit bummed that this ridiculous looking like stead, it's

1653
01:17:02,640 --> 01:17:07,320
almost like something from Batman forever where, or Batman and Robin, where the architecture

1654
01:17:07,320 --> 01:17:09,120
is so like perverse.

1655
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:10,920
It's from Wild Wild West.

1656
01:17:10,920 --> 01:17:11,920
Wild Wild West.

1657
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:12,920
That's good.

1658
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:13,920
That's probably better.

1659
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:16,220
I do think like that's a bummer that they're gone.

1660
01:17:16,220 --> 01:17:18,480
They all look like Christmas ornaments a little bit too.

1661
01:17:18,480 --> 01:17:19,480
Yeah.

1662
01:17:19,480 --> 01:17:20,480
In their look.

1663
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:21,880
I get it that it doesn't maybe work with it.

1664
01:17:21,880 --> 01:17:26,120
The other side was Tweedledee and Tweedledum on like a little contraption.

1665
01:17:26,120 --> 01:17:30,120
Operating a, like a big seesaw that is also a flying machine.

1666
01:17:30,120 --> 01:17:31,120
Yeah.

1667
01:17:31,120 --> 01:17:33,040
I'm less interested in that.

1668
01:17:33,040 --> 01:17:34,040
So okay.

1669
01:17:34,040 --> 01:17:36,120
Less, less fondness, but you like the big telescope.

1670
01:17:36,120 --> 01:17:39,600
I like the big telescope and I like the nephews.

1671
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:42,280
So it's a bummer they didn't put the nephews back in some capacity.

1672
01:17:42,280 --> 01:17:44,920
So the theme used to be your favorite Disney.

1673
01:17:44,920 --> 01:17:51,520
This is a lab where your favorite Disney characters operate retro future machine, like.

1674
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:52,520
Yes.

1675
01:17:52,520 --> 01:17:53,520
Machinery thingamajigs.

1676
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:54,520
Right.

1677
01:17:54,520 --> 01:17:59,240
And now the theme, have you guys read like the backstory and everything?

1678
01:17:59,240 --> 01:18:00,440
A little bit.

1679
01:18:00,440 --> 01:18:01,960
You probably know it better now.

1680
01:18:01,960 --> 01:18:09,840
The what the world of Disney now is that the world of Disney now is supposed to be a former.

1681
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:12,640
The new theme is that it used to be a bus depot.

1682
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:13,640
Okay.

1683
01:18:13,640 --> 01:18:14,640
I don't know.

1684
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:18,280
And now it's an animation studio for Disney artists and they.

1685
01:18:18,280 --> 01:18:19,280
Okay.

1686
01:18:19,280 --> 01:18:20,280
Wait a minute.

1687
01:18:20,280 --> 01:18:21,280
No, wait.

1688
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:26,560
Or it became, I think it was an animation studio once and then became a bus depot and

1689
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:32,760
now it's a store and they took all of the like the walls that they went down to the

1690
01:18:32,760 --> 01:18:37,160
bones of the walls and found all this like magic stuff inside.

1691
01:18:37,160 --> 01:18:38,160
I think.

1692
01:18:38,160 --> 01:18:42,040
I saw some of that because they have like the moving sort of pictures and there's like

1693
01:18:42,040 --> 01:18:46,520
a tribute to the nine old man and there's a bulletin board in there as if like it's

1694
01:18:46,520 --> 01:18:48,000
the animation studio.

1695
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:49,000
Yeah.

1696
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:52,040
Something as clear as levels and stages.

1697
01:18:52,040 --> 01:18:53,960
Really tidy.

1698
01:18:53,960 --> 01:18:57,440
The fact that I'm confused about it shows it really communicates.

1699
01:18:57,440 --> 01:18:59,920
But then there's this whole history where.

1700
01:18:59,920 --> 01:19:00,920
Okay.

1701
01:19:00,920 --> 01:19:04,680
Walt Disney has the animation studio in Burbank and then it's going so well that he expands

1702
01:19:04,680 --> 01:19:09,880
to locations in downtown Disney and Disney Springs which were there then.

1703
01:19:09,880 --> 01:19:10,880
What?

1704
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:11,880
Yes.

1705
01:19:11,880 --> 01:19:12,880
Okay.

1706
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:16,320
So that's going to be a thing I keep coming across where like places in Disney Springs

1707
01:19:16,320 --> 01:19:22,040
place as an appropriate other in downtown Disney.

1708
01:19:22,040 --> 01:19:23,040
Okay.

1709
01:19:23,040 --> 01:19:29,760
It feels like they're slowly starting to fill out Disney Springs with not quite with the

1710
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:35,840
unifying architectural style that took a while to build in Disney Springs.

1711
01:19:35,840 --> 01:19:38,120
A lot of things are in both.

1712
01:19:38,120 --> 01:19:39,120
Yeah.

1713
01:19:39,120 --> 01:19:42,160
There's a lot of stores that are that were the including world of Disney that is that

1714
01:19:42,160 --> 01:19:47,520
that's in Anaheim and Orlando which means we don't have to do a Disney Springs saga.

1715
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:48,520
No.

1716
01:19:48,520 --> 01:19:49,520
Nice try.

1717
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:50,520
No way.

1718
01:19:50,520 --> 01:19:51,520
Thought I'd try.

1719
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:52,520
So did you keep her back me up?

1720
01:19:52,520 --> 01:19:54,200
Two against two tie.

1721
01:19:54,200 --> 01:19:56,200
I can't say much now.

1722
01:19:56,200 --> 01:19:57,200
Fuck.

1723
01:19:57,200 --> 01:20:01,960
But the fate of the world depends on it.

1724
01:20:01,960 --> 01:20:02,960
Oh no.

1725
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:04,480
Man the stakes keep getting greater.

1726
01:20:04,480 --> 01:20:05,480
All right.

1727
01:20:05,480 --> 01:20:08,920
So we'll have to do Earl of Sandwich 2.

1728
01:20:08,920 --> 01:20:09,920
Yeah have to.

1729
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:10,920
Yeah.

1730
01:20:10,920 --> 01:20:11,920
Get to.

1731
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:14,440
Second Starbucks 2.

1732
01:20:14,440 --> 01:20:20,480
Anyway so it's a bus depot slash animation studio that comes to life and there's enchanted

1733
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:21,480
paint jars.

1734
01:20:21,480 --> 01:20:25,600
It's going to be so great to talk about this all the second time.

1735
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:28,560
Yeah the enchanted paint jars I kind of like honestly.

1736
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:29,560
Yeah I like that too.

1737
01:20:29,560 --> 01:20:30,920
Colors there I like that.

1738
01:20:30,920 --> 01:20:34,720
Well anywhere that they add little flourishes and we're watching like a painting of the

1739
01:20:34,720 --> 01:20:36,360
castle come to life and.

1740
01:20:36,360 --> 01:20:37,360
That's fun.

1741
01:20:37,360 --> 01:20:41,640
Yeah the sketches turn a lot the posters change it'll be like that cool 40s poster

1742
01:20:41,640 --> 01:20:46,600
of Phantasmac and then it'll shift over to aristocrats or whatever and the characters

1743
01:20:46,600 --> 01:20:47,960
move that stuff's all cool.

1744
01:20:47,960 --> 01:20:48,960
They did a good job.

1745
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:49,960
Yeah.

1746
01:20:49,960 --> 01:20:54,080
So about 10 years ago when Steve Jobs sat on the Disney board and Eiger sat on the Apple

1747
01:20:54,080 --> 01:21:02,320
board there he consulted with Disney to kind of plus up the Disney retail locations and

1748
01:21:02,320 --> 01:21:08,280
gave them access to Apple store like data like like stuff they have found works well

1749
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:14,040
design elements that work well and the Apple retail people like helped out Disney sort

1750
01:21:14,040 --> 01:21:16,600
of redo the stores.

1751
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:22,200
That's why it's a less you see it a little more minimal now than like the 90s kind of

1752
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:26,400
like design stuff everywhere which is sort of a trend in downtown Disney.

1753
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:31,200
Yeah in general when this place opened in City Walk both too many aesthetics too much

1754
01:21:31,200 --> 01:21:35,680
shit going on packing too much stuff into a tiny space and Steve Jobs led the way for

1755
01:21:35,680 --> 01:21:40,440
minimal is OK and perhaps preferred more relaxing shopping experience.

1756
01:21:40,440 --> 01:21:42,600
Right interesting.

1757
01:21:42,600 --> 01:21:48,720
I will quickly lament the loss of the Park stars the tiny vinyl figures that I have

1758
01:21:48,720 --> 01:21:55,920
over 50 of and that they also they didn't get to stuff that we needed like John from

1759
01:21:55,920 --> 01:21:56,920
Carousel.

1760
01:21:56,920 --> 01:22:01,520
They were little figures they were Park specific characters toys and they never got to John

1761
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:02,520
Carousel progress.

1762
01:22:02,520 --> 01:22:03,800
There's a bunch of other ones.

1763
01:22:03,800 --> 01:22:04,800
Yeah.

1764
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:10,000
And now they have different versions of them but I'm just not not in love like I was.

1765
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:17,080
It was very much a time the early 2010s of like well kid robot is popular.

1766
01:22:17,080 --> 01:22:19,840
Let's try to do vinyl things like that.

1767
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:24,200
And they had the vinyl nation for a long time and then that kind of tapered off and then

1768
01:22:24,200 --> 01:22:30,480
everyone went wild for Funko pops and they're kind of the fun go pop less there is a monopoly

1769
01:22:30,480 --> 01:22:32,980
and yeah there's a me.

1770
01:22:32,980 --> 01:22:40,040
This is also come out already there was a 1500 run exclusive Mickey Matterhorn pop that

1771
01:22:40,040 --> 01:22:46,640
I hopefully now have somehow or they've released in the parks but it is adorable.

1772
01:22:46,640 --> 01:22:50,360
There's also a Mickey Skyliner pop that I think has come out in the time we've talked

1773
01:22:50,360 --> 01:22:51,720
about this both very good.

1774
01:22:51,720 --> 01:22:56,360
I don't love all the pops sometimes a little generic but I have a couple of them the ones

1775
01:22:56,360 --> 01:22:57,360
that are good.

1776
01:22:57,360 --> 01:23:01,600
Yeah I think that was like Disney was like OK we can stop building our own and just like

1777
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:03,320
start a relationship with this company.

1778
01:23:03,320 --> 01:23:05,960
Anyways bring back yesteryears bring back Parkstars still.

1779
01:23:05,960 --> 01:23:06,960
Yes please.

1780
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:09,800
Is there do we do it?

1781
01:23:09,800 --> 01:23:10,800
Are we done?

1782
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:12,800
I think that's it I think we beat the first.

1783
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:13,800
Boys!

1784
01:23:13,800 --> 01:23:14,800
Hey!

1785
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:15,800
Whoa!

1786
01:23:15,800 --> 01:23:16,800
Hey!

1787
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:17,800
Yes yes congratulations.

1788
01:23:17,800 --> 01:23:18,800
Oh thanks.

1789
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:22,280
I just received a text message from the level keeper.

1790
01:23:22,280 --> 01:23:27,480
He says he can't say much now but you give him and I great strength.

1791
01:23:27,480 --> 01:23:29,080
Hey wonderful.

1792
01:23:29,080 --> 01:23:30,440
I'm so glad to hear it.

1793
01:23:30,440 --> 01:23:34,000
And I have something to give you boys.

1794
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:38,280
Unlike the city walk saga where you received the sector stones.

1795
01:23:38,280 --> 01:23:39,840
Oh yeah yeah yeah okay it's not stones.

1796
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:43,040
It will be giving you something that you will place in an inventory.

1797
01:23:43,040 --> 01:23:46,760
Okay so stones are now items.

1798
01:23:46,760 --> 01:23:48,680
Stones are now items boys.

1799
01:23:48,680 --> 01:23:49,720
Like Zelda.

1800
01:23:49,720 --> 01:23:50,720
Like Zelda!

1801
01:23:50,720 --> 01:23:51,720
Yeah!

1802
01:23:51,720 --> 01:23:58,880
What I'm giving you now will come into use at some point in your journey.

1803
01:23:58,880 --> 01:24:04,480
I'm giving you a loaf of sourdough bread from La Brea bakery.

1804
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:10,320
Signed by Nancy Silverton and Mark Peel.

1805
01:24:10,320 --> 01:24:14,880
An autographed sourdough bread.

1806
01:24:14,880 --> 01:24:15,880
Wow.

1807
01:24:15,880 --> 01:24:18,680
People who are no longer affiliated with the company.

1808
01:24:18,680 --> 01:24:20,160
So it's very rare.

1809
01:24:20,160 --> 01:24:21,160
It's original.

1810
01:24:21,160 --> 01:24:22,160
Wow.

1811
01:24:22,160 --> 01:24:24,000
Oh so it's old then.

1812
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:25,000
Yes but.

1813
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,280
It's very stale bread.

1814
01:24:27,280 --> 01:24:29,080
It's been frozen so it's still.

1815
01:24:29,080 --> 01:24:30,080
Hey!

1816
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:31,080
Jason and I's method.

1817
01:24:31,080 --> 01:24:32,080
Bread around the house.

1818
01:24:32,080 --> 01:24:37,080
Now I'll give it to you because you are licking your lip.

1819
01:24:37,080 --> 01:24:38,080
Don't trust me.

1820
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:39,080
Don't trust me with that look.

1821
01:24:39,080 --> 01:24:40,080
I'm hiding this away.

1822
01:24:40,080 --> 01:24:42,640
I'll crack a tooth on that frozen bread.

1823
01:24:42,640 --> 01:24:45,600
So I'll put that in Mike's fridge.

1824
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:48,600
That's a guarantee.

1825
01:24:48,600 --> 01:24:50,240
Alright.

1826
01:24:50,240 --> 01:24:52,080
Boys boys you give me great strength.

1827
01:24:52,080 --> 01:24:53,080
Yeah.

1828
01:24:53,080 --> 01:24:55,840
And my cousin the level keepers.

1829
01:24:55,840 --> 01:25:00,000
He's excited you're taking this journey and he hopes you can rescue him.

1830
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:01,000
Err herr.

1831
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:02,000
Err herr.

1832
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:03,000
Depending.

1833
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:07,280
Depending on what happens or who we can get.

1834
01:25:07,280 --> 01:25:10,360
The spirit world is unclear.

1835
01:25:10,360 --> 01:25:11,360
We can't see.

1836
01:25:11,360 --> 01:25:13,360
Even their communications are coming through.

1837
01:25:13,360 --> 01:25:14,880
We can't quite see them.

1838
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:15,880
Yes.

1839
01:25:15,880 --> 01:25:19,840
And the sector keeper is doing so much jewel he doesn't remember the gender of his cousin.

1840
01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:24,320
Yes we mostly can't see because of all the water vapor in the air.

1841
01:25:24,320 --> 01:25:26,080
We can barely see you sector keeper.

1842
01:25:26,080 --> 01:25:27,440
It's so thick in here.

1843
01:25:27,440 --> 01:25:30,840
What if you have any Visine?

1844
01:25:30,840 --> 01:25:34,920
Jason you have a bag you carry around with everything in it.

1845
01:25:34,920 --> 01:25:36,920
You're having eye troubles right now aren't you?

1846
01:25:36,920 --> 01:25:37,920
Yes I do.

1847
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:41,720
I've been having a slowly been having an allergy attack in my eyes for about two days now.

1848
01:25:41,720 --> 01:25:44,360
So I do have drops with anti histamines in them.

1849
01:25:44,360 --> 01:25:45,360
So we'll have them when we're off Mike.

1850
01:25:45,360 --> 01:25:47,320
So yeah we'll give you some of those.

1851
01:25:47,320 --> 01:25:48,320
Alright.

1852
01:25:48,320 --> 01:25:49,600
And a promise is a promise.

1853
01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:51,800
Let's go get a peanut butter and J jewel.

1854
01:25:51,800 --> 01:25:52,800
Yes.

1855
01:25:52,800 --> 01:25:53,800
Alright.

1856
01:25:53,800 --> 01:25:56,400
I'll hook you up.

1857
01:25:56,400 --> 01:25:59,120
Okay well so we're off to the races.

1858
01:25:59,120 --> 01:26:00,120
Yeah.

1859
01:26:00,120 --> 01:26:01,120
Here we go.

1860
01:26:01,120 --> 01:26:02,120
That wasn't so bad.

1861
01:26:02,120 --> 01:26:03,120
No fine.

1862
01:26:03,120 --> 01:26:04,120
We cleared that stage pretty easily.

1863
01:26:04,120 --> 01:26:05,120
Level.

1864
01:26:05,120 --> 01:26:06,120
Well level.

1865
01:26:06,120 --> 01:26:07,120
Oh yes.

1866
01:26:07,120 --> 01:26:08,120
Stage.

1867
01:26:08,120 --> 01:26:09,120
You know what you're right.

1868
01:26:09,120 --> 01:26:10,120
Stage.

1869
01:26:10,120 --> 01:26:11,120
Confusion me.

1870
01:26:11,120 --> 01:26:12,120
I know what it is.

1871
01:26:12,120 --> 01:26:13,120
I know it's their fault not mine.

1872
01:26:13,120 --> 01:26:15,680
We cleared the stage but keep in mind this wasn't a boss one.

1873
01:26:15,680 --> 01:26:19,280
So be every third day be aware the stakes will be higher.

1874
01:26:19,280 --> 01:26:20,280
Right.

1875
01:26:20,280 --> 01:26:22,040
The chance of death will be higher.

1876
01:26:22,040 --> 01:26:23,040
Yes.

1877
01:26:23,040 --> 01:26:24,480
And we'll see what we can do.

1878
01:26:24,480 --> 01:26:25,480
