1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Alright, you asked for it!

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
He's fucking out, he's fucking gone!

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
He's on the fucking street!

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
My voice cracked, I'm so fucking angry about this!

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Donald's fucking pissed too!

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Like, you can't understand him, he's...

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
He's very offensive right now!

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
What do you think, Goofy?

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Well, gosh, shapeck, you stupid asshole!

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
The only person at the Walt Disney Company who's fumbled the bag worse in the last years is Gina Corona!

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Goofy doesn't hate anybody, hear me?

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
You never get that out of him!

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
The kind dog!

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
This is welcome to an emergency topical podcast, The Ride, The Second Gate.

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
A phrase I almost muted on my account.

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
How dare you three listeners say that word to our stuff?

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Let me live! Let me have my day, audio!

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Tagging every theme park outlet!

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Like, emergency is doing some heavy lifting, and he's request.

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I think it's fun! Reew, reew!

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Emergency is fun, yeah.

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Let's put a siren at the beginning.

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
You hear the reew, reew, that means it's a podcast, The Ride, emergency!

25
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,000
We got, we shot out of bed, we were all sound asleep and realized we needed to get this going.

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Down the fire pole.

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Yeah, and the ambulance is bouncing up and down, and it's got eyes and feet like those old cartoons.

28
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
That's right. It's a very fun, funny ambulance.

29
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
It's a funny, it's not a car's ambulance, it's an old, it's like a depression animation.

30
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Depression era animation.

31
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
The ambulance is happy.

32
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:08,000
This is important for you to know as we gear up for this to talk about the recent, and look, we've been tempted to, there's been things that we have not addressed.

33
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
We laid low on Jay Leno's car disaster.

34
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Well, that's gonna, I have thoughts on that too.

35
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Okay, good. Well, luckily, I think it's easier to talk about now because we know he's generally okay.

36
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Yes, yes.

37
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
For the most part.

38
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
He just, he came out of the hospital yesterday, right?

39
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Mm-hmm.

40
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:33,000
And I would say, if you're gonna, if your head is going to catch on fire, I think that the most important parts of the head seem to be intact.

41
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Right, the eyes.

42
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
The face, the eyes.

43
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Yeah.

44
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,000
If humanity is in the eyes, Jay's eyes are as calming and handsome as ever.

45
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
As Tim Allen said, Tim Allen made a point of saying, I've seen him, he's handsome.

46
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
What did he say?

47
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
He's like, he's happy and handsome.

48
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
He's happy and handsome, I think is what he said.

49
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
He said he took them car magazines and treats.

50
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Really?

51
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Yeah.

52
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I didn't hear that.

53
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Yeah.

54
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
So Jason commented on the treat.

55
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
He goes, I want to know what treats you want.

56
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Maybe I should burn my face up.

57
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Maybe someone will bring me some free treats.

58
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Oh, someone's gonna bring me some caramelos and mallocups.

59
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
You've been looking into cars steam pipes like the little rascals.

60
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Not because there's a treat in there, but because there's a treat if you get your face burned.

61
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Not because he lost one of his marbles in there.

62
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Yeah.

63
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
He only plays with his marbles away from the street.

64
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I show up to recordings with a big black circle around one eye and they're just like, Jason,

65
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
God damn it, have you been tail piping again?

66
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Lucky this one's not on video because you look a fool.

67
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:44,000
No, that one doesn't need to be a dread, but this is crazy and huge because Bob is in the

68
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Bob is in and Bob is out.

69
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Shaypeck, the rain is over.

70
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
The reign of terror is over and Eiger returns to CEO.

71
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
It feels like not actually it's kind of a perfect pandemic buttoning because I remember

72
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
the day that Shaypeck got announced.

73
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
We were all spread out.

74
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Jason was in Vegas.

75
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I was in Ontario Mills.

76
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
We all made videos wherever we were.

77
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
And it was a long time ago, but not that long ago.

78
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
This all began and now we got to hop to it and address the end of the Shaypeck run and

79
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
what a run.

80
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Yeah.

81
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Well, and I guess we should address because the way since that came up, did we all encounter

82
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:35,000
the conspiracy theory that this was the plan all along that Shaypeck was the fall guy.

83
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Yes.

84
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
This is what I've said.

85
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Have I said it on mic or have I said it off mic?

86
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I think so.

87
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Yeah, because this is what I was saying early is that rich people get all the information

88
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
first.

89
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Yeah.

90
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
But also Shanghai Disney had closed.

91
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Shanghai Disney had been closed for a month.

92
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
So it's yes.

93
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
We all knew.

94
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
We everyone knew about COVID being out there.

95
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
It was just a matter of.

96
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Yeah.

97
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
It was for so long we all felt like, but it couldn't happen here.

98
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
How could it?

99
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I mean, to imagine one scenario where it would take like somebody fly.

100
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I don't think anyone flies from China to the US.

101
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I think we'll be fine.

102
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
No.

103
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
But rich people do get a dossier.

104
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Yeah.

105
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
That's true.

106
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:18,400
But the Walt Disney Company also in addition to Shanghai is a big enough corporate monstrosity

107
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:24,000
that like a couple of years ago they're like, we're hiring a new lead intelligence director.

108
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
And it was like, whoa, what?

109
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
What's up?

110
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
The Disney company has their own CIA.

111
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Yeah.

112
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
The Disney company has like intelligence basically.

113
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Yeah.

114
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Yeah.

115
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I mean, there's a lot of.

116
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Yeah.

117
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
So yeah.

118
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
So why was this is a theory I had.

119
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Now it did not play out like I thought it would, but it is similar.

120
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
But the theory was that the shit's going to hit the fan.

121
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
There's a virus that's going to shut down our theme parks, which is a big part of our

122
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
money making.

123
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
It's going to sink the company for a while.

124
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I'm Bob Iger.

125
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I don't want to take the heat for this.

126
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
This is going to be rough.

127
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
But he also has not wanted to leave for a long time.

128
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Like he was being pressured into his succession plan that was not terribly coming together.

129
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Right.

130
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
And he's pushed his retirement four times previous to this.

131
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Yes.

132
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Now perfect.

133
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Like, but it's maybe I would like to leave now, but it's perfect because yes, he doesn't

134
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
have to weather the storm of badness.

135
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,300
Now he said he was going to stick around, but it felt like well, Chaypec is going to

136
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:24,000
take the heat and I'm going to look like the conquering hero once we get out of this pandemic.

137
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
But he did leave, leave officially quote unquote.

138
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
But I guess not last year.

139
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Still not.

140
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
He wasn't really gone.

141
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
He has not been really gone for very long.

142
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Right.

143
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
There's articles that say he's been really gone, but obviously he was not really gone.

144
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
He was still like living inside the house.

145
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
That's kind of well, he had his little interim.

146
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
He had his Jay Leno show.

147
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Well, that's the bringing in Jay.

148
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
We have to talk about for this too.

149
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I saw what he was up to when he was gone was I think he's on the board of like a investment

150
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
firm.

151
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
He was sailing his yacht along the nose.

152
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
He invested in Funko.

153
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I want to remind everyone.

154
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
He gave Brian Mariati some money.

155
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:11,000
And then he had been taking meetings with Brian Glazer about adapting a book about.

156
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Grazer?

157
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Grazer?

158
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Grazer.

159
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Grazer.

160
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Yeah.

161
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
About adapting a book on the war in the Pacific.

162
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I saw that as well.

163
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I saw that he has maybe not been as satisfied by his retirement because he has not gotten

164
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:35,000
to spend ample time with his wife who I always forget is NBA Inside Stuff host Willow Bay.

165
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
What?

166
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Yeah.

167
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Do you know that?

168
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I didn't know that.

169
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Yeah.

170
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I remember like Saturday morning sports show growing up and like a pleasant, pleasant woman.

171
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
He loves the NBA.

172
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I remember somewhere it said that when Obama met the two of them that he was sort of shook

173
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
hands with Iger but then was like Willow Bay.

174
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
NBA Inside Stuff.

175
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
That was mainly where he wanted to.

176
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Wow.

177
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
We got to do a podcast about their relationship.

178
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
We got to learn all about it.

179
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
About Willow Bay?

180
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Yeah.

181
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Sure.

182
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Bob and Willow.

183
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Well, you know, and I learned another fact about Willow Bay.

184
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Like wait, why aren't they spending time together?

185
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Is there trouble in paradise?

186
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
No, no, no.

187
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:21,000
She in March signed a new five-year contract because she is the dean of USC's Annenberg

188
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
School of Communication and Journal.

189
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Good Lord.

190
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Yeah.

191
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
She's a mega couple.

192
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
That's a word.

193
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Yeah.

194
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Major USC journalism dean.

195
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Wow.

196
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
So she is busy.

197
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:39,000
And he also maybe has not been, if you can imagine that he has not been satisfied by

198
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
his work on the board of Genies Inc.

199
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Genies Inc.

200
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I'll explain it.

201
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I don't know.

202
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I don't have to.

203
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,000
But Genies Inc. of course is a crypto startup that allows people to create digital avatars.

204
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Has everybody?

205
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I remember this.

206
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Have you got boners yet?

207
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
That sounds awesome.

208
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
All you need to tell me, digital avatars?

209
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I can't imagine.

210
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Imagine a forum where you could do that.

211
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
That's got to be worth billions of dollars.

212
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Two bubble.

213
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Wow.

214
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
He gets to witness two bubbles burst.

215
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
The metaverse and crypto.

216
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I've been on the website of Genies Inc.

217
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
It's like here.

218
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Look at them, by the way.

219
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I know the listener can't see what you guys are seeing, but this is, these are some fucking

220
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
brats ass.

221
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Like, we use renders.

222
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
This is like digital art from 2004.

223
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
There'd be an unpleasant straight to DVD movie starring these characters.

224
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
He posted one of these when he started investing in this or got involved.

225
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Of himself.

226
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I forgot this till this morning.

227
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Yes.

228
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
There's digital me.

229
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Genies Inc.

230
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
This sucks.

231
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Well, hold on.

232
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Are legs coming?

233
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
They got legs coming?

234
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
That's where they got the leg up.

235
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
They got the leg up, literally.

236
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
They're on meta.

237
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
The legs have always been there.

238
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:01,000
And they also, what Genies Inc. has that others don't is that in August, 2022, the company

239
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
released its NFT storefront, the warehouse.

240
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,000
The storefront will be open on Dappers flow blockchain and allows users to download the

241
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Genie studio app to create their own avatars and buy digital fashion items to dress them.

242
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
So Iger wasn't happy doing this.

243
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
This is it.

244
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
It ruled.

245
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
You don't want to be doing something with your life that rules digital.

246
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
How can not only have an avatar, but I can dress.

247
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I have digital clothes to put my avatar in.

248
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
How do you get in the how?

249
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Where do you like access?

250
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Does it say like, I think, well, the answer was in there.

251
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
It's on Dappers flow blockchain.

252
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,000
So I don't have the answer of how you find Dappers flow blockchain or what flow is or

253
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
what Dapper is.

254
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I have a limited understanding in this.

255
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I don't think that's like a server where you can like experience.

256
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
It's not like I don't think that's the place you go to like hang out.

257
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I don't know.

258
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
It's okay.

259
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Let's analyze this.

260
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
It's a block.

261
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
There's Dapper and they own it.

262
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I know what that flow blockchain where you can download an app and a storefront is on

263
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
it.

264
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:12,000
So there's something if you know how to get there, if you can find it, there's something

265
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
to download from there.

266
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:21,000
This is very much seems like the thing that like defector got covered with the 76ers signing

267
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:28,000
up for like we've got a we're a metaverse partner called Color World and it's the players

268
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
are going to be in there.

269
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:35,000
And then when they looked in when they looked into it, it was like very shady, like they

270
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,000
couldn't find the CEO didn't wasn't clear if they existed.

271
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
And like one of them played the game.

272
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
One of the reporters played the game on Twitch once and it was just them walking around like

273
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I poorly rendered cityscape.

274
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:56,000
And then eventually like the 76ers, it was like embarrassing for them because like this

275
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
company used to be a concrete company and it's like, what do you know about them?

276
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
How did you how did you partner with sports team?

277
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
And we should.

278
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
That's what I I want to know what it looks like walking around in this because I believe

279
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I can figure out how to buy the pants, but I don't know how to go to the world and wear

280
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
them.

281
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
That's what I'm saying.

282
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I mean, I believe I can figure out how to wear to buy the pants and the aesthetics.

283
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
It's like Subjet set radio.

284
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Like it's sub dream work at Dreamcast games.

285
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Right.

286
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,000
The Grand Theft Auto online has 10 times the graphical power and customization probably

287
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
of outfits.

288
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I was sorry for something that is supposed to be the future.

289
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Wouldn't it would make sense if one person in the world could convey to me one thing

290
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
that's cool about it?

291
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Like at some point, if something if an industry is worth billions of dollars, doesn't have

292
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
to be one evident.

293
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Well, yeah, there is.

294
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
And it's called Second Life.

295
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:01,000
And it's coming up on almost 20 years that people are building things and making a living

296
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
making there.

297
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
There's precedent for all of it with video games with Grand Theft Auto.

298
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I have a closet full of clothes that I've like earned because I've gone on missions

299
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
in the game.

300
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
That makes sense to me.

301
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
But it's a game.

302
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Something's happening.

303
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:20,000
What is no one has ever conveyed to me what meta is like when I go there.

304
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
What am I going to like to be doing in there?

305
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I think it all I think there would the idea would be there would be all sorts of things

306
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
to do and like an easy way to like chat with people.

307
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Oh, cool, because I can't do that in regular reality.

308
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Here's the thing.

309
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Shadding.

310
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Here's the thing.

311
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Some people can't.

312
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
That's that's so that's who I get to meet.

313
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
If I go there, there's people who can't meet anyone.

314
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Or Chan message board posters.

315
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Well, the sinister perspective I had heard on the metaverse is like, oh, your boss and

316
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,000
the companies, these massive companies want you in the metaverse so they can watch.

317
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
They can clock your hours like they can.

318
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Well, that's going to work from home.

319
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
You want to be doing a meeting in a poorly rendered world.

320
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:08,000
When the water wars start and we're all inside permanently, you need to go somewhere and

321
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
it better be a meta.

322
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
There'll be a different metaverse to go to.

323
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I don't know that the Bob Iger metaverse is going to be the one that survives.

324
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Well, not with his torn attention now.

325
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Yeah.

326
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:24,000
What's going to happen in all the Disney fanboys geeking out that Iger's back?

327
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Have you thought about how this will affect Genie's Inc.

328
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Give it one second and then maybe you won't be won't be celebrating.

329
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Point Jean Jean.

330
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
It being called Genie's is funny.

331
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
It is very funny.

332
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:42,000
His successor fucked up with Genie Plus while he was off doing Genie's Inc.

333
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
The Bob should not be anywhere near Jean Jean.

334
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
That is the lesson of this.

335
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
No, but let's.

336
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
OK.

337
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Well, there's a couple of issues here.

338
00:14:52,000 --> 00:15:02,000
And I don't know if you want to stay in Iger or if we go into like because I think there's a question of why Iger and then there's a question of what happened to Chay Peck.

339
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Like what is this?

340
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Well, the why is that he was good at acquiring companies and running the company.

341
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:16,000
And the big hole in his resume is he's not good at finding a successor.

342
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Yes.

343
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:22,000
He has like destroyed the the the bench.

344
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
He's like the Democratic Party.

345
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
There's no bench.

346
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
There's no one to succeed.

347
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Yeah.

348
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
He will buy.

349
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
He almost got on the bench, though, for that.

350
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
He was flirting with getting on that bench.

351
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
He could still.

352
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
That's true.

353
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
He's he's first of all, guy's in great shape.

354
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
He's 71 years old.

355
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
He looks good.

356
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
He looks great.

357
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:50,000
And really fundamentally, fundamentally at the end of the day, for the problem with Chay Peck, he couldn't get it.

358
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Let's be here.

359
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Everybody is.

360
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
No, I think now now that he's not you're going to think about this.

361
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
We're a couple of days into him not being CEO.

362
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
You don't owe that beard anything.

363
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
You don't have to pretend.

364
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I don't think you can admit to yourself that it's not good.

365
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
And he can't get it.

366
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I think he looked cool.

367
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I'm not maybe saying like he like was got sexier.

368
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I'm just saying the beard I think looked good.

369
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
It was a cool look for him.

370
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I think maybe it was a little harsh for Disney.

371
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Disney so clean cut.

372
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
So maybe you're right.

373
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
If that's what you're saying, it's too.

374
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Yeah, this is a company founded on making people get rid of their facial hair.

375
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
So maybe that was the last straw.

376
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I think that was the last straw for a lot of Disney is about there's one kind of facial hair and it's just a good solid mustache.

377
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
That's what that it all.

378
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
You know, it all started with a mouse, but it also started with a mustache.

379
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Walt's mustache measuring stick that he used to make sure people's mustaches were in the zone of comfortability for him.

380
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:50,000
There are a million year old like theme park fans who are like, the park has not been the same since we haven't had a CEO with a good mustache.

381
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Oh, yeah.

382
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
That's what you do.

383
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Those are the type of people you might want.

384
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
They're old, so they won't be in the metaverse.

385
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
But people with interesting opinions, you'll meet in the metaverse.

386
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
No, they're paradise.

387
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Oh, yeah.

388
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
No, they're in much more horrifying sections of the Internet.

389
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
That's true.

390
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
One of those people.

391
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
It's like, I don't do seed oil.

392
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
And it's like, what the fuck are you?

393
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:18,000
You're mad about seed oils and you're mad about like french fries cooked in sunflower seed oil.

394
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Somebody told me that Bill Maher only eats seeds.

395
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Stop watching.

396
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Okay, yes.

397
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Go ahead.

398
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I'll be done.

399
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I understand.

400
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
But apparently he only eats seeds.

401
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
He only eats types like types of seeds for every meal.

402
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I could be wrong, but I got to look into it.

403
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
And yet he does not pass them along.

404
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
He himself is not a seed bearer.

405
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
No, he's not.

406
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
And he seems so happy for a happy seed based diet.

407
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Satisfied with his life.

408
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I heard that.

409
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
He loves his seeds and he loves his seedy room.

410
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Okay.

411
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Well, all right.

412
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Let's talk about this.

413
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Let's talk about it.

414
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Let's talk about how, unless you have something to say.

415
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
No, no.

416
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I, I.

417
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
The way that this.

418
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Sorry, I'm correct.

419
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Bill Maher lives off an assortment of ground up seeds.

420
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I believed you.

421
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
You didn't.

422
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I was right.

423
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I just wanted to make sure.

424
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
I think that thread was tied in a knot.

425
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Ever since it was put in a box, a chain was put on the box.

426
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
It was sank like Houdini.

427
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
But then he managed to escape and resurface.

428
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
He's a genius magician.

429
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I just, ever since Marshall gate, I'm doubting myself.

430
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Now you need to, we go back and we check these things.

431
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Yeah.

432
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Okay.

433
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:37,000
So how this has played out incredibly quickly, because this is, we're recording this just the day before you're hearing it.

434
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Yeah.

435
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
And basically.

436
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
So what's yes.

437
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Sunday.

438
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Sunday afternoon.

439
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
This happens.

440
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:55,000
What seems to have been discovered is that the first call made to Eiger officially on this issue was Friday at 3 p.m.

441
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Yes.

442
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Yeah.

443
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Susan Arnold, who is the chairwoman, I believe.

444
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,000
So, so in charge of the board.

445
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
So from just the way this broke.

446
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
It, cause it, cause it was so sudden and so out of nowhere.

447
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I mean, we all knew something was up, but all I ever saw was like shady petitions kind of.

448
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:20,000
We have to get rid of shape back and maybe some of those are because of the splash mountain changing.

449
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
And they thought that never really took it seriously.

450
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
And they voted to keep him months ago.

451
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Yes.

452
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Very recently, the contract.

453
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Yeah.

454
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Yeah.

455
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
So you thought that was a positive sign.

456
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:38,000
But no, all of a sudden out of nowhere, like only a slightly above 48 hours later, we are all hearing about it.

457
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
And when we heard about it, you know, who else heard about it?

458
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Chaypeck himself.

459
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
He got no heads up on this.

460
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
We've had the podcast, the Ride Boys found out when he did.

461
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Well, it's kind of turn about his fair play, I think, because there were a few instances during his reign.

462
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:11,000
The most recent one is right around the time of that contractor renewal when he kind of fired, basically fired in kind of an insulting way that I believe it's Peter Rice, the former head of.

463
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Television.

464
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Yeah.

465
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:18,000
And entertainment and and, you know, anonymous sources go like, look, everyone liked him.

466
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
He's really respected.

467
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Usually, if you want someone like that step down, you give them a production deal or you give them a vanity credit or something.

468
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
You don't just kick them out the door.

469
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Huh?

470
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Yeah.

471
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Because that's like a valuable commodity.

472
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,000
So he can kind of write his own check and go in anywhere.

473
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
You know, it's a cutthroat game.

474
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Cutthroat game.

475
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
These high level executives play maniacs.

476
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Especially lately.

477
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
There's something like it is.

478
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
But I always do this way.

479
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:56,000
But the last couple of years have just been like, I think it's as love and like, I mean, it's a well, no, you long as Elon comes in and just lays in a room.

480
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I think it's always happened.

481
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:06,000
I think it's just we've heard more stuff because like Iger has Iger has sort of like kneecapped people from becoming viable CEO candidates.

482
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Like your Tom stags.

483
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Not that he I love whatever.

484
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
But he there's like he's kind of like, you know what?

485
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
By the way, we shouldn't let this guy be CEO.

486
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Yeah.

487
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
So he's done this a couple.

488
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
So this is a weird game that all these people play.

489
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:26,000
And this woman who was responsible for talking to Iger, Chaypek was supposedly about to blame all the earning stuff on her.

490
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Oh, my God.

491
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
That's what I read.

492
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,000
It seems like he had a tendency to blame stuff on people.

493
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
So it was like kill or be killed.

494
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
So she was like, I ain't dealing with this.

495
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
So she took him out before he took her out.

496
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Whoa.

497
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Yeah.

498
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
This is like Breaking Bad.

499
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
This is like Donald.

500
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:47,000
There's only a few players and they're all everybody just jumps into action.

501
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Yeah.

502
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Knocks each other off like chess pieces.

503
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
It's pretty it's pretty exciting.

504
00:21:51,000 --> 00:22:00,000
But the the the reason they he got the contractor know that I read is that OK, he fired this guy and I was like, what the fuck is he doing?

505
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:07,000
And the boards like that caused a drop in shares and the boards like we have to show we have confidence in this guy.

506
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Should we give him a one year deal?

507
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Well, that doesn't look great.

508
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,000
And they compromise on a three year deal and backdated it.

509
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
So it was a little over two years, really.

510
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
The deal.

511
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
So a big deal.

512
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
And everyone who watches this stuff is like that.

513
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,000
That is kind of like a pocket vote of no confidence.

514
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Like, so there were members of the board, I guess, who like wanted him gone back in the early summer spring.

515
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Like, yeah, there's been rumblings of this for a while.

516
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
It came up in June.

517
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:44,000
And so some of the someone I'm saying is from The Hollywood Reporter, by the way, and others from The New York Times, just to give forever credit.

518
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:53,000
But the in June, there was talk of putting in one of the board members who's the chairman of Nike, Mark Parker, as an interim CEO.

519
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
So Mark Parker was almost a name we had to know about.

520
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
We got a lot of names in the mix.

521
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
There's a lot of names.

522
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
So that so that got flirted with.

523
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
And then, yes, the contract I ran it.

524
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Let's just kind of like, I don't know, kick the ball for a little bit.

525
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:13,000
But then and the biggest question I had when this all of a sudden came to a head like what he's just out.

526
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
But my biggest question was, what was the final straw?

527
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
What did it?

528
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,000
And now I think that's become clear, which is the Q4 earnings call.

529
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Yes.

530
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
This was a disaster.

531
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
All of it was contained in there.

532
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Not just because they missed analyst expectations for revenue by more than a billion dollars.

533
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
And that sounds bad.

534
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
But on top of that, this almost never happens.

535
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,000
The categories are revenue and earnings per share.

536
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,000
And it's unheard of for Disney to miss expectations on both of those things.

537
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Yeah.

538
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
So that's bad.

539
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:54,000
So having to couch that and explain that to the board and to the shareholders, how do you do that?

540
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:02,000
And he does it with a jolly call about how Disney, quote, makes magical memories that last a lifetime.

541
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,000
He said just a bunch of the words he tried to hide in the Disney words.

542
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Make a wish.

543
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Instead of we're very excited about some of our upcoming dreams.

544
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
And so he so he did that.

545
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
He did it right before Thanksgiving and Christmas.

546
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
He said there's going to be hiring freezes and layoffs.

547
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
But important note, he didn't say that on the call.

548
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
The call was all jolly bullshit.

549
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
And then, all right, so bye, everybody.

550
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Then in subsequent days.

551
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Oh, by the way, did I not mention hiring freeze and we're going to fire a lot of people?

552
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
See you.

553
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
And people were blindsided.

554
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:40,000
People were like, well, how do I spend how do I make television shows if I can't spend money?

555
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,000
You know, another note that I saw.

556
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:50,000
And this is just to keep to keep it parks oriented because I don't think parks fueled this.

557
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:56,000
I don't think it's in there, but I don't think it's the primary reason for streaming is the big fuck up.

558
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
But this is from The New York Times.

559
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:03,000
And I love that this dumb theme park thing that ends up in this story.

560
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
People were shocked by the happy go lucky tone that Mr.

561
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Chapek struck while discussing the earnings report.

562
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:13,000
His demeanor struck many as tone deaf, in particular when he started to implausibly talk about how great the response had been.

563
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:21,000
To Mickey's not so scary Halloween party, a relatively inconsequential event at Disney World.

564
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,000
I mean, look, those things do print money in the short term.

565
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,000
They're all they make a lot of money, but they always have.

566
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,000
That's not if you're supposed to be talking about what you're doing this quarter.

567
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
It's weird to say we had a party.

568
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
It was very fun.

569
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
I almost feel bad for this guy now.

570
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
I know.

571
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
I do.

572
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
No.

573
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Well, I some of the reports were like the board members did have empathy for him being like a pandemic CEO and the company is in a difficult spot, which to which I say, spare me, please.

574
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:03,000
This company is worth like over a hundred billion dollars like and I'm a could be closer to 200 billion.

575
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
I don't understand how stocks work.

576
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:27,000
So but they're saying all this and then they're saying like, well, you know, JPEG kind of put streaming ahead of everything, which seems confusing to me because I have always thought with streaming services like I feel like I'm I'm insane because these companies are like, oh, we didn't get enough new subscribers last quarter.

577
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
And it's like, yeah, there's a there's a cap.

578
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
There's only so many human beings.

579
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
It's what they're all discovering at once.

580
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Yeah.

581
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Netflix ruined the whole industry.

582
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:45,000
They hold all of these companies into putting all their chips in on this streaming and it's sinking every company.

583
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Every company, every one.

584
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
They got tricked.

585
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
They make any money.

586
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Netflix still doesn't make any money.

587
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Yeah.

588
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
And I I don't.

589
00:26:52,000 --> 00:27:01,000
And especially when you're starting a brand new streaming service from scratch, even with the full Disney library, it's going to be a loss leader for a while.

590
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
You're going to lose money on it.

591
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:16,000
When you think about how the way they used to be able to value these individual that like here, just Bambi is going to cost you twenty five dollars to own a we're a bad form, a cropped on the sides.

592
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
I have a VHS version of it.

593
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Yes.

594
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
And that's just Bambi.

595
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Now, would you like to own more than Bambi?

596
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Would you like to own dozens of them?

597
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,000
And now we get all of them all the time for eight bucks.

598
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
It's great.

599
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,000
It's great for consumers currently, but you can understand why.

600
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Currently.

601
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Yeah, boy, it's going to these places are going to get wild.

602
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
I'm starting to buy Blu-rays again.

603
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:44,000
I'm starting to buy movies again because like Star Trek movies just disappeared off of Paramount.

604
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
What?

605
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
The home of Star Trek.

606
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,000
And now they've been like licensed to a different like to Netflix or something.

607
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
I'm like, wait a minute.

608
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Star Trek can go away from Paramount streaming service.

609
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Yeah, the looking up is just bonkers like and how much big stuff falls into the cracks.

610
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Post-Fableman's, I have been going like I should see every Spielberg I haven't seen.

611
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
And I'm looking up this major one.

612
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Almost every one I look up isn't on a streamer.

613
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Like, what do you mean?

614
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:15,000
The career of Spielberg has not been fully scooped up by one of these.

615
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
There's like 12 of them and they don't cover all the Spielbergs.

616
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,000
I mean, somebody purely speculate that like Eiger's just going to shuffle back and forth.

617
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:30,000
And shuffle back to like their old like put the movies in theaters and then like Disney Plus will have some content and we'll see.

618
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
That might be right.

619
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Well, Tom Cruise proved movies still viable.

620
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Tom, I was saying this this morning to some people.

621
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:43,000
I think Tom is like the I think he did change every I think that Maverick release working.

622
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Yeah, because I like stopped the insanity and reminded people how lucrative and exciting a movie could be in theaters.

623
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Yeah.

624
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
So he's the runner on third.

625
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
And then who's coming to bat?

626
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Why, James Cameron?

627
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Yeah, I hope so.

628
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
I'm rooting for it.

629
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,000
You saw though it has to be the fourth highest grossing movie of all time to make a profit.

630
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
He can do it.

631
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
If anybody can do it.

632
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
It's James.

633
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Two billion dollars it has to make.

634
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Watch that new trailer.

635
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
The trailer's fucking bonkers.

636
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
We're going to meet the water people.

637
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
I'll go.

638
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
I forgot.

639
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,000
I was in the middle of calming baby who was very rambunctious last night.

640
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Very, very ramy.

641
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Well, it's going to be emotional for you because you see Sully holding holding his child.

642
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,000
You see a lot of the family emotion and kind of what's what's some of this.

643
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
I'm excited.

644
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Oh, my God.

645
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Quaritch is an avatar.

646
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:42,000
These these like people with no hearts and souls who are laughing at Avatar Quaritch as an avatar.

647
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Well, Quaritch is a Navi is going to be the best.

648
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
That's great.

649
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Well, and Sully like their their son or their.

650
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Yeah, I think it's a son is like learning how to ride the water version of an Ecrans.

651
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
And I was like, no way.

652
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Yes.

653
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
No way.

654
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
I got my movie is it's it's Ecrans.

655
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
But now they're underwater.

656
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
We have to learn a whole new system.

657
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Creatures.

658
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,000
I can't wait for hours and glorious 3D.

659
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
I'm going to think of a new word to qualify.

660
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Oh, my God.

661
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
The pressure's on.

662
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
So we yeah.

663
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
We don't know the name of the of the beast yet.

664
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
No.

665
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
But oh, I don't know.

666
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,000
I don't think you can do that till you see that you need to see the whole three hours

667
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
and 50 minutes of them in action.

668
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Yeah.

669
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
But to to.

670
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Oh, that's I feel bad for you.

671
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
That's that's a lot of.

672
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
I had a lot of.

673
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Well, Mighty has gone for you.

674
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Mighty has been one of the biggest successes of my life.

675
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
So I have to think of the pieces of proof that you were here.

676
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
That's right.

677
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
That's why people see you.

678
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
It's my legacy.

679
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Leaving it to my daughter since hashtag.

680
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Yes.

681
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Wow.

682
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,000
That is very funny that like, well, I'm the CEO again.

683
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
What do we have coming up?

684
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Ah, Avatar 2.

685
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Excellent.

686
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Yes.

687
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
I waited long enough for him.

688
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
It got delayed just enough that it gets to come.

689
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
It's Iger's first big movie.

690
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:06,000
And you know, honestly, they should just just buy up a bunch of ads for the next three days

691
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:11,000
and just like push strange world, like make it remind people like, yeah, remember, you

692
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
got to see a Disney cartoon at Thanksgiving time.

693
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Go see it instead of their current strategy of a buzz ad.

694
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:23,000
We're like one out of every 300 intersections you pass by.

695
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Yeah, it's pretty anemic.

696
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:29,000
This it's like they're they kind of did forget how to push stuff.

697
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:34,000
And isn't that the I feel like we got to go back to the I found it so bizarre.

698
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,000
You're disenchanted is just streaming Hocus Pocus twos just streaming maybe some of these

699
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
movies.

700
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Maybe they've crunched numbers and they're meant to be streaming and maybe Hocus Pocus

701
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
twos cultier or something.

702
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,000
But like then you're capped on your nobody.

703
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,000
You're not getting new subscribers for any of these movies, but maybe you get new profit

704
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,000
from a theater if you put them in a theater.

705
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Right.

706
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,000
That's what well, I mean, that's what I don't want to praise as love as love or whatever.

707
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,000
But that's some of his philosophy where he's like, we're not getting any new subscribers

708
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
with some of this stuff.

709
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Yeah.

710
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
And it's like, yeah, that's true.

711
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
I don't know who's going to.

712
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Yeah, I don't know what like I guess Hocus Pocus.

713
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Like probably a lot of the hardcore Disney people have Disney Plus already that won't

714
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
focus focus too.

715
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Yeah.

716
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Yeah.

717
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
So it's like why?

718
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Yeah, it doesn't make sense.

719
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Did their other hardcore bet heads who mid middler heads who signed up just to watch

720
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
for that?

721
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Maybe that.

722
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Yeah, that's they were waiting for that for.

723
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Yeah, it's possible.

724
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:41,000
But I don't know what this Jimmy Axe Jimmy Army came out.

725
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
That's yeah.

726
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,000
I mean, I think there's something to be said of like like I saw this morning.

727
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,000
I saw a tweet that was like, oh, hey, bullet trains coming to Netflix.

728
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
It started December.

729
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,000
And I still remember that movie coming out and being promoted.

730
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
And so I hadn't forgotten about it.

731
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
I was like, oh, cool.

732
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
I'll watch it when it's on Netflix.

733
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:06,000
So I think there's something to be said of like, oh, yeah, maybe a smaller window between

734
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
theatrical release and streaming.

735
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
I don't mind that.

736
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
I don't think that's crazy.

737
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
I don't think that's like an industry vendor.

738
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
They've all pumped out so much stuff.

739
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
There's there's things where I was like, oh, my God, I forgot about that.

740
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Yeah, sometimes you're not like you didn't like turn on the I do.

741
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
I will never see Barbarian.

742
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
No, I just forgot to see.

743
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
I watched it on HBO.

744
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
It's very good.

745
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:36,000
I watched Confess Fletch last night because it's on Showtime on demand.

746
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,000
And I was like, oh, oh, that's on streaming already.

747
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Oh, I'll watch that because otherwise I will never watch it.

748
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
I will forget that it was on.

749
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:49,000
That one may be an example of some things not meant to be theatrical.

750
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
It was a nice struggle.

751
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Light mystery.

752
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Ninety eight minutes long.

753
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Pretty, pretty pleasant.

754
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Pretty good time.

755
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Not bad.

756
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Huh? Huh?

757
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Well, this is some of what it is.

758
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:05,000
And Jason, you said something about people not knowing how to budget.

759
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:09,000
And I look, I'm not going to be able to give the expert analysis of this.

760
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:22,000
But I think, OK, something that Chaypek did that Iger is going to immediately undo is that he gave all this preference to Disney Plus over the other arms over regular movies and regular television.

761
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:32,000
And the big thing is that it was everything was restructured so that the budgets are not handed out by the head of film, the head of television.

762
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Like it all reports to one guy, the guy's name, Kareem Daniel.

763
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Kareem Daniel was fired yesterday.

764
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Gone.

765
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Yes.

766
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Part of, yeah.

767
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,000
So which it doesn't, I don't know about him.

768
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:56,000
I don't know if he deserves to just be out, but that structure does sound weird where the head of Disney features cannot like, all right, we are giving a green light to this movie.

769
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,000
It has to get run up to one other guy.

770
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Centralized with the power streaming, which is getting crazy where they're like to make it work.

771
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Like we got to pump so much money into Mandalorian and or whatever this.

772
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,000
That doesn't seem correct.

773
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:15,000
So if only if that's the only thing that changed, maybe that makes sense.

774
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
It's called like profit and loss.

775
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Like power was taken away, I think from each department.

776
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,000
I forget P and L or something is the way they refer to it.

777
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Yeah.

778
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:29,000
So I think that yeah, that's like that's the first thing he's vocally said is gone.

779
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:40,000
And he's probably critical because this is the other thing that Iger's been like high, like popping up like a popping up like the little Caddyshack gopher.

780
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Yeah, like I wouldn't have done that.

781
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
We shouldn't do that.

782
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
You really fucked up on.

783
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Don't say he's been.

784
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Yeah, he's been like real shitty to shape the press.

785
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:55,000
It like last December when it was on his way out, he's like, this has the potential.

786
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Like he said something of like, this is potential to like ruin the culture and destroy the company, which also fueled the feeling of like he set this fucker up to fail.

787
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Like he was constantly being like that guy.

788
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
I don't know.

789
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Let me say this theory.

790
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Is there something going on where the the guy?

791
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Okay.

792
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:28,000
He knew that this would be as Mike, your conspiracy that he he set up like a patsy because COVID is coming.

793
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,000
So I'll let somebody else deal with this.

794
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:44,000
But then it backfires because now it looks like after a career of good decisions and good acquisitions and all that, that his final move is installing a boob.

795
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:53,000
So it's tainted Iger's legacy because the thing he did on the way out the door was choose a successor who stinks.

796
00:36:54,000 --> 00:37:02,000
So now he has to go back to erase it so that he has a new ending to his Disney story that is not putting an idiot in the chair.

797
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Yeah, he wrote the book.

798
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
He wrote a book.

799
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,000
He wrote the hardcover like, well, my work is done here.

800
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Book.

801
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
What's that?

802
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
He wrote a book called The Ride of a Lifetime.

803
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Oh, you're saying.

804
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Okay.

805
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Oh, so that like ties that up.

806
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
That was years ago.

807
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
That book came out.

808
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,000
And, you know, of course, people, you know, you make the joke.

809
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Well, shouldn't be called the attraction of a lifetime.

810
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Do you know what company you work at?

811
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,000
This is it's a terrible title.

812
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,000
But, you know, there's going to be 5000 people very upset.

813
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Yeah.

814
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
No, the term is different.

815
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
They call it in.

816
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
You don't understand the culture.

817
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Yeah, it's it's interesting.

818
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,000
I don't think I think that the truth is in somewhere in the middle.

819
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:52,000
I think he was I think he was like he liked the thought of coming back.

820
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,000
And there was like a podcast or some interview we did a couple of months ago.

821
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
We're like, no, I'm done.

822
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
You can't go home again.

823
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
He said, I think he was probably ready to be done.

824
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,000
But I do think Chaypex was Chaypex was so bad.

825
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:09,000
And like the optics of all of it were so bad that, yes, his legacy was in in trouble.

826
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Plus, he was also bored.

827
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Yeah.

828
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
So I think all of that combined cocktail.

829
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Yeah.

830
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Bored them.

831
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,000
And they were going to be like, well, but your choice here sunk the company.

832
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Wow.

833
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Yeah.

834
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Plus, that commissary is pretty good.

835
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,000
So maybe miss the Maltz Chili.

836
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Oh, yeah.

837
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Right.

838
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Maltz Chili.

839
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Like the Parks, the Dizzy Commissary does stamp Waltz Blank on a lot of menu items.

840
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
There's an article.

841
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:42,000
I forget which paper it was in about Iger's going away party.

842
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Did you ever read this?

843
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Maybe we talked about this on the show.

844
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:50,000
It was like 50 people in his Brentwood home and Chaypex attended, but they did not talk to each other at the.

845
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Wow.

846
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Wow.

847
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Wow.

848
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Well, he's been at the party.

849
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Oh, really?

850
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
L. Michael Spielberg.

851
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Wow.

852
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Wow.

853
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:06,000
There's yeah, it's been icy because Iger keeps popping up and making these statements.

854
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:10,000
And Chaypex has viewed it as firing shots.

855
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
It is.

856
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
He's right.

857
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
So he stopped.

858
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,000
There was a world where he would have consulted with him on things a little more.

859
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,000
But then he decided to like, I don't need him.

860
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
I'm going to go my own way.

861
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Cut to don't say gay DeSantis controversy.

862
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,000
He got no guidance from Iger on this whatsoever.

863
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
And we know how that went.

864
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Blunder in both directions.

865
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Blunder because he wasn't critical enough of it.

866
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,000
And then he decided, OK, actually, we are against it.

867
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
And then DeSantis.

868
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Like a perfect opening to bad faith Republican.

869
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
It's Reedy Creek.

870
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Governor shit.

871
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Yeah.

872
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Yeah.

873
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:51,000
So they got like both ends of how badly that could have gone while Iger with nothing on

874
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
the line tweets.

875
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Well, now I would say this bill is very bad.

876
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Was I kind of love it.

877
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
I kind of love Iger.

878
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Just like Iger sliding around.

879
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Iger was hiding in closets at Disney, I think, during this point.

880
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Over here, what was going on?

881
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
So he would know.

882
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Well, how much does this metaphor?

883
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:13,000
It does. OK, so it doesn't hold up completely, of course.

884
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
But there are similarities.

885
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:20,000
I think there's more similarities on the Iger as Jay side.

886
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Not in that it's done the opposite of blow up in his face.

887
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
It's worked out completely in his favor.

888
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:35,000
But where it falls apart is if this makes shape back Conan, that sucks because Conan's a genius with a superior product.

889
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
That's where it falls apart.

890
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
It just got screwed.

891
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
But so that part not as much.

892
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:44,000
And certainly, Jay did not pick Conan as successor.

893
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Jay, what Jay probably did was I said we probably don't even know the ice out of successors.

894
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:53,000
He probably was the guy weird like, hey, Paul Rodriguez ain't coming on anymore.

895
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Well, Joan Rivers.

896
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Jay is.

897
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Well, that was Carson.

898
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
But Jay is.

899
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Oh, OK.

900
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Jay is a Machiavellian genius, honestly.

901
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,000
The more like little things he talks about, he would hide.

902
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
He hid in closets twice.

903
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Have you heard this?

904
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Both executives, both NBC executives.

905
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,000
He also like learned like Warren Littlefield was like staying.

906
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,000
This is all revealed on one of the many Jay interviews I watched in the last year.

907
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:32,000
He learned like Warren Littlefield was staying at a hotel or something and learned he was like using the bathroom in the lobby somehow and then like used it to tell Warren Littlefield to pretend he was like spying on him intensely to freak him out.

908
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
This is in the late shift.

909
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
We all know this.

910
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
OK, good.

911
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
This is dramaticized with Bob Balaban.

912
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
OK, you're right.

913
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
You're right.

914
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
There's a different story than I'm going to miss.

915
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:45,000
That is a new story that I'm there's a different hiding in the closet that's not in late shift.

916
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Really?

917
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
I can't remember what it was.

918
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
I don't have to watch Club Random to hear it.

919
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:53,000
It was either that or the Holly Mandel podcast.

920
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Good Lord.

921
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
These people relitigating the same.

922
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Leave that to us.

923
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
We want to talk about the late night wars.

924
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Has your daughter heard Jay Leno's voice more than her grandparents voices?

925
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Good question.

926
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Yes.

927
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,000
My son got to meet Jay pre-accident.

928
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
You know, it's crazy.

929
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:23,000
I have this great I sometimes I think that it's just a photo when I took a bike ride and ended up just right next to Jay and a classic car.

930
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:30,000
And I sometimes I think it's just a photo because I isolated just the last frame of it where it kind of looks like Jay's looking at my son.

931
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:41,000
And but I sometimes I go I remember oh there was a video in that and in the video there's like a big steam burst and it startles everyone around including my boy.

932
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,000
And now I'm like if these things were all ticking time bombs.

933
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Thank God that pipe wasn't aimed right at baby's face.

934
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Jesus.

935
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Yeah.

936
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
You know what?

937
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,000
It's it's it's been it's been recklessness for a long time.

938
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Here finding.

939
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Yeah really.

940
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Wouldn't you have all those cars made before 1940.

941
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:02,000
I do want to reiterate only you fixing it.

942
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Folks if you have not seen the photo of Jay in his classic denim attire with doctors and nurses at the hospital and you read about what the event what happened to him.

943
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,000
He looks shockingly in good shape.

944
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
Yes.

945
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
For what occurred.

946
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
The guy is so durable.

947
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:23,000
He's just he is the worst diet according to him.

948
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Like it doesn't matter.

949
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
He just he does whatever he wants.

950
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,000
He does stand up 300 days a year.

951
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
He cannot be stopped.

952
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,000
The man is unstoppable.

953
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:36,000
So the engine is solid but he can thank the burn center for doing the detailing.

954
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Which makes him which is letting him ride out I think right right out of the hospital and shiny new.

955
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
You get a chuckle out of him with that.

956
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
I think I think so.

957
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:59,000
My question is so this is this is what I would say the comparison is to both of these situations is that I bet Jay in some ways had a thought of like you know if this felon character doesn't go well.

958
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Yeah there were some machinations on Jay's part but Jimmy did so well in the ratings.

959
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
It was just impossible then for Jay to come back.

960
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Yeah.

961
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Oh so you think it still could have gone back.

962
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
That's what I'm saying with Jay back in Eiger.

963
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:18,000
It's like there's a scenario where Jay back did really well against what people would thought.

964
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:22,000
I mean people were like I don't know if this guy's gonna do well and he did way worse I feel like.

965
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
Yeah.

966
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
And then I gear snuck back in.

967
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:31,000
But I think in the back of Jay's mind it was like well Jimmy doesn't work out you know maybe this and like and she was doing something that just didn't go anywhere.

968
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:39,000
And we just don't know about it now because Jay Jay the thing with Jay of course is he always kind of twists the narrative to be like well and I just you know okay they asked me if I would do that.

969
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
They asked me if I would do this.

970
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:48,000
Meanwhile Jay's like studying the ratings understanding the affiliates and the lead ins and like he's so he is like numbers on the wall.

971
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
He's like set up a system.

972
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Yes Jay knows everything and the way he presents this is where he gets in trouble.

973
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
It's just the way Jay presents it.

974
00:44:55,000 --> 00:45:05,000
It's like well you know they said you want to do a show here and okay and like the real situation is them telling Jay like we're worried about Conan we want you to go on a 10 and Jay's like yes if Conan does poorly.

975
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Jay is a very smart guy who knows everything and presents if he's a I'm just a big little guy and I don't know anything.

976
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:15,000
And Fallon luckily Fallon got to start the Tonight Show without his lead in being.

977
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Well right.

978
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
It was a hell of a.

979
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Watchable 10pm talk show.

980
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
But still I want to know what Jay was doing.

981
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
Jay was like well you know maybe.

982
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Yeah well those first six months yeah and you know he's watching every episode.

983
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
Every episode.

984
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Like they're lingering on quest level a little too long.

985
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:34,000
You don't want to show the band leader for more than you got to do 2.5 seconds tops.

986
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:40,000
That 100 percent Jay Jay was that clinical or that like methodical about his Tonight Show.

987
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,000
Did he run out.

988
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:45,000
You see the unstoppable force who ran up against the immovable object Lauren Michaels.

989
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
You know maybe.

990
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Who was not present the previous time this yeah yeah yeah right.

991
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000
That's right.

992
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
So that's a good point as well.

993
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,000
So yeah this is this is a scenario where you're at.

994
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:06,000
I think the thing that struck me was that it played out like the like fantasy casting.

995
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:10,000
It played out with people going like they got a fire cheap and they got to bring Iger back.

996
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,000
And it was like well when does that happen.

997
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Like I guess it seems too stupid.

998
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,000
It's too obvious.

999
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:21,000
The only thing that I think that struck me was that it was like.

1000
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:25,000
I don't think it's a perfect one to one is Steve Jobs leaves Apple.

1001
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
He does stuff on his own.

1002
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:30,000
He starts next computers and then eventually comes back to Apple.

1003
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Yeah.

1004
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
And just then they just have iPad.

1005
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:40,000
I I pod iPhone iPad like yeah yeah yeah that's the only like grand return of the iPad.

1006
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Yeah.

1007
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
And then they just have the iPad.

1008
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Yeah.

1009
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
And then they just have the iPad.

1010
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Yeah yeah yeah that's the only like grand return of like the yeah the guy publicly associated with the company.

1011
00:46:55,000 --> 00:47:07,000
And even that it's like well yeah but then there was the other there was a guy who did the operating system for the next computer which was sort of the backbone that OSX is built on really.

1012
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
There's there's plenty of people behind the scenes.

1013
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:17,000
Isn't it weird that it's also they're also equivalent in that Steve Jobs is one of the only like we know this CEO.

1014
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:25,000
This is like a this is an executive who we know very well and with most company like all of this was happening at.

1015
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,000
I don't know.

1016
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:30,000
I mean well I guess we kind of know with Paramount Sumner.

1017
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
We don't really know Sumner.

1018
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:38,000
What I'm saying is like is it weird that regular people know and are invested in the Disney CEOs.

1019
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,000
Yeah.

1020
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,000
We are more than most people.

1021
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Right.

1022
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:48,000
But I think due to the president set by Eisner where the CEO of Disney is coming on and saying hello to you every week.

1023
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Yeah.

1024
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
Left to live where right now we all like.

1025
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
Well you want to have a feeling about that.

1026
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Yeah.

1027
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Yeah.

1028
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Eisner brought that back.

1029
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
That's true.

1030
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Made it so public.

1031
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Very solid move.

1032
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:04,000
It makes you kind of trust the guy and Iger good on camera.

1033
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Charming when you see him talking.

1034
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Chapec weird like blinky doughy.

1035
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
It's interesting.

1036
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:18,000
I mean we all have like these fascinations with like figureheads in general I think because Lauren is there.

1037
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Frank Marshall.

1038
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Frank Marshall.

1039
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Michael Meldman.

1040
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Brian Mariani.

1041
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
Yeah.

1042
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Stan Lee of course who made himself a character.

1043
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,000
That's a fun thing.

1044
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:36,000
So I think people like thinking that like a company is a character or a person.

1045
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Like there's something fun about it.

1046
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:46,000
And then and like it's a perception of a lot of things are optics and perception.

1047
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:51,000
So just like Bob Iger if he's a seemingly nice man.

1048
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Oh that makes you feel good about the company regardless of what's going on.

1049
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:59,000
Like you want to feel like oh he's nice and the company is nice.

1050
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Yes. Yeah.

1051
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:09,000
And then we all broadcast as Griffin referred to this when he was here the thing of like we are all making up things that Kathy Kennedy is doing.

1052
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Oh there's a whole industry about it.

1053
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:14,000
We're all imagining little scenes in our heads and we don't know even if there is truth to it.

1054
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
We don't know about any of this.

1055
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:24,000
And I do find it odd on the other side that there there was even there was a headline about like Disney adults celebrating Iger's return.

1056
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,000
That was bizarre.

1057
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:32,000
That was like a writer had to hit a quota because they were like just quoting random Twitter users that were like YouTubers.

1058
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
And it was so condescending.

1059
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
It was such a short article.

1060
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
Oh then there was like no no real proof.

1061
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
There was no like.

1062
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,000
But that's a weird thing.

1063
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:44,000
That shouldn't be to the extent anyone's doing that.

1064
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,000
It's still it's billionaires versus billionaires.

1065
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,000
We know Iger.

1066
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,000
Yeah.

1067
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:54,000
He's a friendlier semen guy but you know he's probably done a lot of shitty things.

1068
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
We shouldn't be celebrating him either.

1069
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:59,000
But it's American life you know.

1070
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,000
You write narratives.

1071
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,000
You tell storytellers about the conquering heroes.

1072
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
It's a story.

1073
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,000
It's a story.

1074
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,000
Disney story.

1075
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:12,000
It would be funny if first things like Iris like we're pulling out of story living.

1076
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
I don't know what this what is this.

1077
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Well let's talk about that.

1078
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:19,000
That's some of the like let's do a little fan casting here.

1079
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:25,000
What do we want to happen versus what you think actually will because I think it might be kind of mundane what actually happens.

1080
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,000
But yeah that'd be incredible.

1081
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Done.

1082
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Sell that property.

1083
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,000
It's all the sense in the world.

1084
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
They're already reorganizing.

1085
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:35,000
He's already got his people reorganizing the structure of the company.

1086
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:41,000
And I was like I found that you texted us the news and I was on the phone.

1087
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:45,000
With my dad and he had the news on and he had just seen it too.

1088
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:50,000
And we were talking and trying to figure out like what are they going to do to the parks.

1089
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
Like what changes.

1090
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Well because this and I think I said to you too like okay Vince McMahon kicked out of WWE.

1091
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:03,000
His son-in-law takes over immediately hires back like two dozen people in front of the camera and behind the scenes.

1092
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:10,000
Yes that's another very recent precedent of a lot of people unhappy with Vince McMahon for many years.

1093
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:16,000
Not just for his personal life and other things but choices creative choices.

1094
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:22,000
And then yeah sweeping changes that are very popular with like the hardcore audience.

1095
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:31,000
So yeah this I mean I would assume he's actually coming back mainly to figure out how not to leak money from a streaming service.

1096
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,000
Yeah.

1097
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
Because the parks are still making a lot of money.

1098
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,000
I think they miss their like they miss what they wanted to earn.

1099
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Yeah.

1100
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:45,000
So maybe it's not completely like Rosie but by and large all the stuff we don't like is helping them make a lot of money.

1101
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,000
It is.

1102
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,000
And there is.

1103
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:55,000
What I was curious in this news coming out is like in these sort of like industry art that these writers who are outside of us and our nerdy bubble.

1104
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:58,000
Is it going to register that the feeling has been really bad with theme parks lately.

1105
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
Like does it matter.

1106
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:06,000
And in fact this is in New York Times.

1107
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,000
This summer.

1108
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,000
OK.

1109
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:15,000
All the while some of Disney's most dedicated theme park customers have been growing indignant over price increases they see as nickel and diming.

1110
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:24,000
This summer Disney told investors that theme park profits would have been even higher if not for a quote unfavorable attendance mix at Disney World which annual pass holders took as an affront.

1111
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,000
And people started embracing the word unfavorable.

1112
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:32,000
So it is something the fact that it is profitable but they're pissing people off.

1113
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:35,000
And I think Iger gets that's going to matter in the long run.

1114
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,000
The Iger thing.

1115
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,000
OK. So Iger I certainly think is not OK.

1116
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:50,000
So because there's two sides of the argument there's people are like daddy's home which I think I saw maybe was attributed to an employee and actually someone said daddy's home daddy's home which is really funny.

1117
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,000
And then there's people who are like nothing's going to change.

1118
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,000
He's not different.

1119
00:52:54,000 --> 00:53:03,000
And it's like the truth is a little bit more in the middle because I do think at the I do think Iger understands a little more of like the customer.

1120
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:08,000
He seems to have a little more as they say because this has been a common insult against JPEG.

1121
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:11,000
He has more emotional intelligence.

1122
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:19,000
This is a big slam against JPEG is that he doesn't have the emotional intelligence to understand some of the issues and how he's coming off.

1123
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:25,000
So Iger's been to therapy is what we're so Iger maybe has been psychotherapy.

1124
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:35,000
So I do think yes he understands a little more of like some of this can be like long term damaging if it's like you really start making people mad.

1125
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:43,000
Now does that just mean that Iger knows you just don't turn the heat up on the stove when the lobster is in the pot is hot as quickly.

1126
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,000
Maybe.

1127
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:50,000
Right. Maybe he understands you like and just turn the degrees of a couple like two degrees a year.

1128
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:53,000
So the lobster slowly boils.

1129
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:57,000
Don't turn it off all the way immediately because then people get upset.

1130
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
Yeah. If you understand what I'm saying.

1131
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,000
I do.

1132
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Because they've done too much into like JPEG's shown his greed hands.

1133
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,000
Right.

1134
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:12,000
There is no era of Disney we've ever talked about on this show that isn't fueled by rampant greed.

1135
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,000
Right. And how much can we up ticket prices and charge people for it.

1136
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:25,000
But it's gotten so crazy and the fact that in something like that earnings call everything he's touting is all of this mundane Jeannie plus blah and what we aren't doing is big blockbuster rides.

1137
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
The thing that Universal is doing left and right.

1138
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Entire new theme park.

1139
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:42,000
My biggest hope is that Iger realizes the biggest the best thing to do is rides like like we get something big or get Avengers moving again or whatever it is.

1140
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Change it back to the old one.

1141
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,000
Yes.

1142
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,000
Yeah. Yeah.

1143
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,000
That would be the OK.

1144
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:50,000
The dream scenario is that reservations go away tomorrow.

1145
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,000
Mm hmm.

1146
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
Yeah.

1147
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,000
That that stops.

1148
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
I think Jeannie plus is not going anywhere.

1149
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
I think that's probably here to stay.

1150
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Maybe there'll be a different way to do it.

1151
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:04,000
Like as far as on vacation where you have to buy it at midnight and wake up at six or seven or something.

1152
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:11,000
I think the infrastructure changing massive software infrastructure like that is hell.

1153
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
That takes so much and so long.

1154
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Disney's website.

1155
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:17,000
Go Disney's is held together by tape.

1156
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Well and that and and I think I sent you guys like looking up the streaming stuff like what how did how did Disney build their streaming network.

1157
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:37,000
And the answer was they built they bought an offshoot of the major league baseball's digital media wing.

1158
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:42,000
And that is the backbone that ESPN plus and Disney plus were built on.

1159
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,000
Oh yeah.

1160
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
By the infrastructure.

1161
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,000
OK.

1162
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,000
Yeah.

1163
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:55,000
So it's like I could see maybe something with like lightning lane and Jeannie plus I don't know like try to make it easier like a little bit less annoying.

1164
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,000
There's got to be a way.

1165
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,000
There's got to be something there like they could do.

1166
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:05,000
But I think in general the idea of like paying for fast passes has been on their radar for years.

1167
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,000
Yes.

1168
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,000
Sure.

1169
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,000
And it's yeah.

1170
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
It's happening in in Paris and other places.

1171
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,000
Yeah.

1172
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
And then dynamic pricing is everywhere.

1173
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:22,000
Obviously Ticketmaster right now with the Taylor Swift situation people are becoming more aware of how awful Ticketmaster is and that merger should not have happened.

1174
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:32,000
And this on top all of this that that and this Disney stuff and Elon Twitter disaster all of what like everything the wheels are coming off.

1175
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:36,000
It's all a little exciting because it's like showing the limits of just unbridled.

1176
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:39,000
Well and it's showing your incompetence.

1177
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:45,000
It's really Trump started the whole like hey maybe these guys aren't so smart.

1178
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Maybe.

1179
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,000
Yeah.

1180
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,000
Maybe a lot of the stuff is bad.

1181
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,000
Pretty funny.

1182
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:54,000
This is all happening right around the time there has been reported there's an adderall shortage.

1183
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:57,000
It sounds keeping all these companies running.

1184
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,000
That's a good point.

1185
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,000
Hmm.

1186
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,000
Hmm.

1187
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:05,000
And it's all been adderall supply chain problems everywhere.

1188
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:08,000
So yeah so I want reservations gone tomorrow.

1189
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
That's the easiest one.

1190
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,000
The better.

1191
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,000
I think so.

1192
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:15,000
I mean I also like I have not I don't have an annual pass.

1193
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,000
You don't have an annual pass.

1194
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,000
Yeah.

1195
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Jason still does.

1196
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:25,000
I almost got one because my sister wants to go in a few months but then the fucking thing sold out again.

1197
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:30,000
The same as though as Taylor Swift stuff is going you're telling me how you can't get it.

1198
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:34,000
I want I'm trying to give you hundreds of dollars.

1199
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,000
Yeah.

1200
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,000
Let me.

1201
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:40,000
And like I'm like there's no way they used to let everybody buy as many as they wanted.

1202
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:45,000
There's just no way that that's like they're offering as many.

1203
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
Sold out said and it can't be.

1204
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Yeah.

1205
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,000
No.

1206
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:55,000
And the whole thing that thing was a nightmare too because people were in the queues the online virtual queues for like 12 hours waiting to get it.

1207
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,000
Jesus.

1208
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:07,000
And I the morning the day like a few hours after they went on sale I got in the queue and it took me seven or eight hours to eventually just say it was sold out.

1209
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
Seven or eight hours to get it.

1210
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:16,000
Yes it was on my phone and it was just that slow little crawl like that like it's like a loading like you're downloading something.

1211
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:25,000
It was like you're waiting a few more hours here and I'm like this isn't your and we've yeah like it's it's just they're trying to figure out the right man.

1212
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:29,000
To figure out the right mix of annual pass holders and people that are paying more money.

1213
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,000
Yeah.

1214
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:33,000
Isn't it awful being on the other side of the unfavorables.

1215
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:42,000
I'm not going to start embracing that and wearing a shirt of it but like it's so similar to people embracing deplorables after Hillary.

1216
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,000
Yes.

1217
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,000
I don't want to be a deplorable.

1218
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,000
No.

1219
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
The person owning but I am an unfavorable.

1220
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,000
So we all are.

1221
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,000
We are all.

1222
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:56,000
It doesn't mean we have to grossly embrace that phrase but like I don't like being a being on the other side of one of these terms.

1223
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,000
Yeah sure.

1224
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
I mean it's doesn't it's not fun.

1225
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
There's nothing that word even unfavorable.

1226
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:04,000
There's nothing even fun to say in it like just purely from a.

1227
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Who are you getting back at when you get you show up at a Disney park in an unfavorable shirt.

1228
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,000
Yeah.

1229
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,000
They're still with.

1230
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
They're still getting your money.

1231
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,000
Yeah.

1232
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:16,000
You're wearing his catchphrase.

1233
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:21,000
I've still given you thirty dollars or fifteen for parking.

1234
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,000
Yeah.

1235
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:33,000
So so like that if they could just like be like yeah annual passes you can buy them if you want to like make on the web site and buy them and reservations are gone.

1236
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,000
Even reservation.

1237
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:38,000
Honestly I would take just the annual passes you can buy and reservations are still there.

1238
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:42,000
I don't hate reservations but the fun of going.

1239
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:45,000
It worked when I had the flex pass in 2019.

1240
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,000
It was great.

1241
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,000
Sure.

1242
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,000
Not that many people had it.

1243
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
And I never had trouble getting reservations.

1244
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,000
So I don't know.

1245
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,000
I don't know that.

1246
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:58,000
Like I said when I was talking to my dad and I'd be like look it'd be great if they brought back magical express.

1247
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
A lot of people really like that.

1248
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,000
It'd be great if they.

1249
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:02,000
Yes these are easy.

1250
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:10,000
If they give you two fast pass a day and then you got to pay for more people I think would be a little more satisfied that you got something.

1251
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:13,000
That's going to be too confusing though with Genie Plus and then you get two in the app.

1252
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,000
Like there's no way that's happening.

1253
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,000
That's true.

1254
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:20,000
But they've they've taken away a lot of the value of the perks of like well you're staying in a Disney hotel.

1255
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
It's a little pricey but you got this stuff with it.

1256
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:28,000
I think Chay Pack just got too excited because remember we've talked about this before when he was talking about the annual passes coming back.

1257
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:31,000
He was saying it was going to be some sort of a loyalty program.

1258
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
So he had he was excited.

1259
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
I think this is my speculation.

1260
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:42,000
He was excited that he was going to get rid of the way annual passes were and like it was going to be like you buy two days get one free like they're like I think he was he was excited.

1261
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Like I think he was he was looking to do something even more aggressive to keep people out and then they crunched the numbers and we're like we need these annual pass holders.

1262
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:57,000
We need some to make them like they've sustained the park in a lot of different years when maybe attendance wasn't up.

1263
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:01,000
So that didn't he had a grand plan I think to completely ice us out.

1264
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:02,000
God.

1265
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:06,000
But yeah again I think it's turning the turning the heat up too fast.

1266
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,000
Just got too greedy.

1267
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:08,000
Yeah.

1268
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:18,000
That's what marries a lot of this is just yeah like yeah we've we've all been taking advantage of fight corporations our lives but they're not they're not hiding it well enough.

1269
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:33,000
Right. Maybe we're a little smarter and they're a little greedier and it's the Revers finally made the road a little because yeah ultimately in 10 15 years if they have like expanded like doubled the size of Disneyland and California Adventure and there's like seven new hotels and another shopping area.

1270
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:36,000
They're going to draw more tourists who will spend more.

1271
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:44,000
So that makes sense like OK then like they're going to ice us out more and more as more tourists come to that because there's so much to do here.

1272
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,000
OK.

1273
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:52,000
Then that makes sense. But right now it doesn't make like the model has always been annual pass holders are a huge part of these parks.

1274
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,000
Yeah. Yeah.

1275
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:59,000
And annual I'm sorry this is should be a basic thing but I'm not in Florida so I don't know no annual passes in Florida still.

1276
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:04,000
Well they they haven't put them back on sale but they're going they announced like a new tier or something.

1277
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,000
They announced some changes to it.

1278
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:06,000
Or am I wrong?

1279
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:11,000
OK it's that they're wait I'm thinking of park hopping. You can't park hop.

1280
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:18,000
Well you can park hop. You can but on one coast it's after 1 p.m. and on the other coast it's after 2 p.m.

1281
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:25,000
It's still it's that that that is another thing. That's an easy thing to get rid of that would just be make people go.

1282
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:30,000
Make people go. Ah thank you. Yeah. Why. Yeah. Pick your park and all that is annoying as hell.

1283
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:44,000
Because the other thing is for years it worked that people just self selected people evened out the parks like when my family we go to a park is to grab they're like let's just take a bus to a different park.

1284
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
Sure. Yeah.

1285
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:55,000
Because we've talked about the the the reservation system and everything is literally is actually they say it's to put their resources in the right spot to know how many staff.

1286
01:02:55,000 --> 01:03:04,000
But it's actually to put as few staff members in the places because you'll know you have a little more organization you know where everybody's going to be.

1287
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:12,000
So you can like understaff everything more because you have more like awareness of where everybody is is at a certain time.

1288
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:16,000
That kind of ties back to like at the at the top level.

1289
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:21,000
I think you can if you can get away with turning up the lobster boil. Yeah.

1290
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:32,000
If you're doing it with a smile. Yes. If you're doing if you're doing it subtly and you're being nice and you're shaking and I this is I think they've clearly the chip back era has been very bad to employees been bad to loyal fans.

1291
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:40,000
And it's also an aspect of this I never thought of was that he comes from parks and then he's put in this situation where he's a big deal.

1292
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:47,000
It's one of the biggest deals in Hollywood and Hollywood people do not know this guy and he's shitty to them.

1293
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:53,000
And he fires this Peter Rice guy brutally in this awful PR thing with Scarlett Johansson.

1294
01:03:54,000 --> 01:04:02,000
None of this needed to happen. So I think if he has any credibility of like all the parks were doing okay under his smart and parks.

1295
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:07,000
None of that applies in the Hollywood realm. He's entered where everybody's just always hated him.

1296
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:13,000
Yeah. I want him to be fired. Let's be clear parks and consumer products.

1297
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:20,000
So all items vacations toys toys all items. Yeah. Gotcha.

1298
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:34,000
It will be like Iger it's going to be interesting to see if Iger does some sort of like flashy like the King move which like something like that would be like we're journeyed into imagination.

1299
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:43,000
Like we're making figment new ride plus in it up like if he did something that like aggressively pandery to our types.

1300
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:48,000
It'll be interesting to see if he does anything like that. I don't know. Yeah. Does he does he need to.

1301
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:56,000
I mean they did not get away with that awful d23. No. Where does this leave daddy tomorrow.

1302
01:04:56,000 --> 01:05:01,000
Well that is a good question is it not because there's I've seen a lot of talk about this guy.

1303
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:12,000
I've been asking this this question lately and I've certainly look I've been a tomorrow skeptic for a little while and I find it interesting that this era of parks that we're all complaining about.

1304
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:17,000
Yes. Jay Peck's the CEO but who is running parks this guy daddy tomorrow.

1305
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:23,000
Daddy tomorrow. Are we just not being critical of him because he's handsome. Is that what it boils down to.

1306
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:30,000
Look he's got the bomber jacket. He's got the formal sneakers. He's got some tight dark jeans.

1307
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:34,000
Okay. That's how you know he's a cool executive.

1308
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:45,000
I have seen the discourse around Josh tomorrow is wildly different. People have wildly different opinions.

1309
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:49,000
Some people saying he's too much of a chapec guy he needs to go.

1310
01:05:49,000 --> 01:06:01,000
Some people saying well he just threw in with chapec because he wanted to curry favor with the CEO and he's doing chapecs bidding but he's more of a he knows what should happen.

1311
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:11,000
Okay. So maybe parks do get corrected a little bit. Right. Well and I've seen it all the way up to because there's already the discussion because I don't think we've said Iger's run here is supposed to be short.

1312
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:19,000
He's supposed to do two years. It's another question I have. We should all bet right now. How long does this guy actually last. Good question.

1313
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:27,000
Because I think it's longer than two years. Yeah. I think he renews that for another two. I agree. And then he adds another year I think five years minimum.

1314
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:41,000
Yeah I have six in my head. I'm going to say what did Jay do when Jay did four when he came back I believe. Right. Yeah. We at least have to do a I think four at least. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1315
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:58,000
We at least got to get Iger in a car on the PCH with get back playing get back to where he once was. We got to do it the same way Leno came back. I think that's right. And the car has a sticker that says retired and it blows off reveals Disney CEO.

1316
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:16,000
Well they have would get back on Disney plus. Oh yes. Yeah. Yeah. The rights to this song. Yeah. So so. Oh wait I was gonna say in one of the I think an Hollywood Reporter something that it's been speculated OK well if he's only doing a short run then who is next.

1317
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:36,000
We don't we don't know Mr. Tomorrow's name is in there. His name is in there. Yep. Potential see any other Dana Walden is the other one. Yes. So I think I think we'll know at least what side the mark because I do. Iger greenlit a lot of stuff for California Adventure that he probably didn't technically have to.

1318
01:07:36,000 --> 01:08:06,000
Yep. A giant expansion which is what cars land in the whole car they circle and making it. Yeah. Pleasant again. The good good front of his show. So he does understand that. So I think like again the truth lies a little more in the middle where like I think he understands that like it feels like Disney's not making like big movies that people that people are that excited about he understands like there needs to be some creativity going on in addition to we need to figure out how to take the most money. He of course not like guys. I's there. I always

1319
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:36,000
think of like Eisner was a guy who was like fostering creativity from within. Iger a lot of times is like buying things to keep the creativity going. Yeah. Which is still I guess in some in some instances better. I don't know about this Fox thing. I think the Fox thing also got avatar which could backfire. Maybe right. That's true. I'm rooting for it. But Fox. But that also the buying Fox and put Disney on the debt which I think is also partly like dragging shape back down a

1320
01:08:36,000 --> 01:09:06,000
soon as he starts. Sure. But yeah I forgot where I'm taught what I was talking about. But it's yeah we'll see. I don't know. Well if we're if we're winding down a little bit just in terms of a final thought the final things to say about all of this. First of all this is from Scott Gustin on Twitter like Disney reporter theme park reporter. He pointed out the oddity of you're like how long was a shape back in for. And the

1321
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:36,000
number the answer is 999 days. So funny. That's so crazy. That's so short of a thousand. And the the number of ghouls. That's like a funny coincidence. There's a couple. There's another I sent Jason this tweet yesterday and I'm trying to find it and I got a. Where's your text. You find that. I got to mention. So one of the people that was like an Iger person. Christine. Yeah.

1322
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:57,000
Christine M. McCarthy. She's the CFO. She is also a senior executive vice president and she seemed to be one of the people she started in like 2015 has stuck around for a while. So she she seemed to be more in the Iger camp and I think was one of the people who would talk to him. You know.

1323
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
We talked about earlier who called him. There was no.

1324
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:25,000
Person also has a lot of both sides on the Internet and I was trying to figure out why and I quickly did because she got a lot of flack in the summer because she came out and said yes we are cutting portion sizes at our restaurants but our guests you know be good for their waistline.

1325
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:32,000
Some of them could probably do to lose some weight and everyone was just like what is the matter with you. Like he was that quote. Yeah.

1326
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:43,000
I found that. So this is a Twitter user CBC Travels who tweeted this January 25th 2020 Shanghai Disneyland closes February 25th 2020.

1327
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:53,000
Iger steps down November 14th 2022 Disney Cruise Line drops all covid testing November 20th 2020 Iger even stated. Wow.

1328
01:10:54,000 --> 01:11:05,000
Like he stops worrying about covid completely at this point and then I wrote it out. He just waited for the whole thing to die down. Well rosy news I guess about that by valent booster. Yeah.

1329
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:13,000
Yes. They saw the efficacy data. Yeah. And he was so excited about it. The one thing I'll say and I haven't told you guys this yet.

1330
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:24,000
That is maybe the funniest and saddest is that JPEG on Sunday was ready to do a big introduction.

1331
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:35,000
Oh yeah you know we know you guys know this but you don't know. Oh my parents and I were there. Whoa. At the Elton John concert at Dodger Stadium.

1332
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:48,000
I learned all this by Elton John's final concert in North America. I did not know you were there. No. We last second decided to go because I'm like all right well it's outside and say well my parents were like you know busy doing stuff so the little stripes like you know let's all go.

1333
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:57,000
Three of us will go. So we're on that we're driving into the just the nightmare of parking at Dodger Stadium if you ever done it. Don't do it. I try not to but that's what we chose to do.

1334
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:16,000
So we're driving in and that's when I started getting all the texts. Whoa. Oh I love that secret. Yes. And then we're sitting there. We were sitting there and that's when I started seeing the tweets that Bob JPEG was supposed to introduce Elton John that night because the concert was streaming on Disney Plus.

1335
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:33,000
And I started laughing. I showed my parents because I had been telling them and they were laughing at this. We were laughing at a man's misfortune. Yeah. But you know so I'm trying to figure out was he there because it was so last second. It felt like he might have been backstage.

1336
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:44,000
Rehearsing the speech pacing back and forth. Excited known as music's favorite rocket man. No that's not. Which one should I. It was a little candle in the window to say that.

1337
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:50,000
He did start the fire. Pop no no wrong guy. Wrong guy. No no.

1338
01:12:51,000 --> 01:13:02,000
Under a road is Bob. No no way. I love American popular music and one of our great always an American. Well OK.

1339
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:13,000
The another detail about that was that there were Disney executives in the audience. Yeah. Who found out right.

1340
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:28,000
Do you worry. The email that's like hello Robert Eiger here. I'm happy and surprised to tell you that I. Yeah. A lot of people thought the email got hacked with Twitter. There's been a lot of impersonation of corporate entities.

1341
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:36,000
So I think people flashed through. Is this some weird. Oh no. Eiger is back. And not only at that but also at the American Music Awards the same night.

1342
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:49,000
So at all of these events large blocks of Disney executives are all like gotta go gotta go. The red wedding. The red wedding happened at the Elton John concert. Elton John's final North American concert.

1343
01:13:50,000 --> 01:14:06,000
By the way let's break that apart. That like yes the one of the one of the most important musicians of all time. And this is this major night for him and that how that's going to start is a disliked executive is going to.

1344
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:13,000
Yeah that's a good point. I don't know. Terrible. I guess it could maybe have not aired but no I think it was going to probably he was going to.

1345
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:23,000
I don't know if he was going to do like a warm up and then they were going to start the stream but I'm not sure. They did a whole pre show which I have not watched back. So it's crazy.

1346
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:34,000
Did the it all it ultimately just started with like lights on dramatically Elton's playing his song already. Yes. There was no need for a boring man to introduce.

1347
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:45,000
No people were excited to sing Benny in the Jets and they weren't like well what are we watching here. Why isn't anyone explaining. Who's this guy. I don't get it. What's the song. Is his name Benny.

1348
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:51,000
And he improvised to he changed it to Eiger and the board. Eiger and the board.

1349
01:14:53,000 --> 01:15:02,000
Yeah so he I wonder like I don't think Elton was planning on thanking Bob Chapek at the end because he Bernie Toppin was there he brought Bernie out at the end.

1350
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:12,000
And he brought his husband and the kids out. But I don't think it was like was Chapek who's going to be like thank you Bob Chapek and they had to be like oh he's been fired.

1351
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:21,000
Cross that out. I don't know. And the biggest thanks of all my entire the biggest thanks of my entire career. I never could have done it without.

1352
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:23,000
Always been fired.

1353
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:24,000
Always been fired.

1354
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:36,000
Well very strange. Very strange. Mr. Chapek your candle burned out long before your legend ever will.

1355
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:38,000
I guess.

1356
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:51,000
Insane. Well fun thing to talk about for a while. I guess you survived podcasts throughout the second gate and none of us have elected to fire the other before the end of the episode.

1357
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:52,000
That's true.

1358
01:15:52,000 --> 01:16:05,000
I did check Twitter to see if there were any developments and I went to Trending Topics Entertainment and it was just the oddest mix of like movie stars names and then like right wing grifters names and I'm like oh what is this.

1359
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:07,000
Why is this happening?

1360
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
On to the next adventure I suppose.

1361
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:18,000
And as for our next event this emergency topical episode has bumped the club three which now will be next week finally Kingdom Hearts.

1362
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:23,000
You'll hear our journey into the world of Kingdom Hearts.

1363
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:38,000
But for now I got other I got adventures to get on. I still I still have the tab open for genies dot com and it says here I can I can make whatever species I want ranging from a Zen teacup to a psychotic bunny.

1364
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:42,000
Wow is that like the bunny man Johnny Depp's son's NFT creation?

1365
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:48,000
He should keep an eye on it because another company, Eiger's getting into big bunny.

1366
01:16:49,000 --> 01:17:05,000
Will they reinstall you made a joke about this is will Eiger we were all wondering will Elon reinstate Trump and he didn't Trump didn't come at least as we're recording this will Eiger reinstate captain Jack Sparrow.

1367
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:12,000
I said Chay Peck on his way out a green lit a trilogy of Johnny Depp pirates movies.

1368
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
He cursed an unbreakable contract.

1369
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:25,000
They owe it yes it's a it's a pay and play they owe Johnny Depp one billion dollars per movie they don't let him do.

1370
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:26,000


1371
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:32,000
Quickly in his lame duck hour of being a CEO he got that passed he got that through.

1372
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:36,000
And it's in the contract that Chay Peck takes the pirate cameo spot.

1373
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:41,000
It was Keith Richards and it was Paul McCartney now Chay Peck showing up on set.

1374
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:47,000
Big dreadlocks and dirt smears on his face.

1375
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:53,000
Boys, Captain A it's your great uncle Captain Bob.

1376
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:55,000
Maybe that's why he was growing the beard.

1377
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:57,000
Maybe. Yeah.

1378
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:06,000
I know one thing is for certain Disney has not paused advertising on Twitter because I get so many promoted Disney tweets and such.

1379
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:10,000
Unless it's unless it's fake unless it's a verified.

1380
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:12,000
Oh yeah.

1381
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:16,000
Mary Prinkster's Hey this is Disney Plus it's free now.

1382
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:22,000
Stock plummets everything erased.

1383
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:23,000
It'd be funny if they had an ad support.

1384
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:28,000
I mean they are I believe introducing a cheaper ad support a tier like everyone else's now.

1385
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:30,000
Sounds awful to me.

1386
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:36,000
But if they just had a free version that's just all the tooth early 2000 stuff.

1387
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:40,000
It's like well it's free but you can only watch a bolt home on the range.

1388
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:42,000
The Haunted Mansion.

1389
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:44,000
College road trip.

1390
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:46,000
You wanted more than college road trip.

1391
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:48,000
Well add on.

1392
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:49,000
Yeah I got to pay.

1393
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:51,000
Go to 2B if you want more.

1394
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:53,000
We'll see.

1395
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:55,000
Hey good luck.

1396
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:57,000
We love you.

1397
01:18:58,000 --> 01:18:59,000
He's a superhero.

1398
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:01,000
The newest Disney hero.

1399
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
One of our friends called said he looks like James Bond like eight years ago.

1400
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:06,000
And that's how I like to think of him.

1401
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:08,000
Yeah.

1402
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:12,000
The real Elon's the real life Iron Man and Iger's the real life James Bond.
