1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Club Three.

2
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,560
Okay, it's Club Three, you know who we are,

3
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,740
let's fucking go.

4
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:30,420
We have time, no introductions here,

5
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:32,020
although I should let Mike and Jason,

6
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:33,020
you should say something.

7
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:34,380
No, I don't give a shit.

8
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:35,220
All right, yeah, yeah, yeah.

9
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:36,420
No time to go.

10
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:37,380
Club Three.

11
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:38,540
We gotta dive in.

12
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:41,640
There is one introduction to give, however,

13
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,620
and that is just to lift up and celebrate the winner

14
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:47,880
of our first, we didn't know that people could be chosen

15
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:51,000
as winners of this, but we threw it out to the audience.

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,580
What do you want as a Club Three topic

17
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:55,900
and the first thing chosen,

18
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:01,020
very clearly landslide was suggested by Ben Hicks.

19
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,940
Just let Eva come on and talk about whatever obscure,

20
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:06,020
insane pop culture things she wants.

21
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:08,460
So here to do exactly that, Eva Anderson, hi.

22
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:10,820
Oh, thank you, I wanna congratulate Ben Hicks

23
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:14,460
and the Club Three listeners for their intelligence,

24
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:17,500
emotional intelligence and foresight

25
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:20,380
in knowing that obviously I should win this.

26
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:23,700
There was only one way to go on this

27
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:28,500
and before we dig in and give the floor to you,

28
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,420
there was a runner up that I thought was pretty worthy.

29
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:35,040
The runner up, this is from JF Co.

30
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,380
They're suggesting, quote,

31
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:38,900
the original crypto Disney dollars.

32
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:39,740
Ooh.

33
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:42,420
Great idea, was a very solid number two,

34
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:43,540
got way ahead of the pack,

35
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:45,900
but obviously Eva was the winner.

36
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:49,480
Here's how this is going to work in future months

37
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,320
because we'll ask you for your suggestions

38
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,520
for Club Three topics below.

39
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,660
If you're on Patreon, just list them below this episode.

40
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:59,080
The runner up's always gonna get another go.

41
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:02,740
So number two always advances to the next round.

42
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:04,120
That is their consolation prize.

43
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,200
So Disney dollars will get another chance,

44
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:09,240
but will there be a more exciting topic?

45
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,080
We will see.

46
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,080
There will be four more chosen.

47
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,120
Give us your ideas and also,

48
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,480
if you're looking at other people's ideas,

49
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,780
click like on those things.

50
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:18,720
Put hearts on it so we know that's what

51
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,280
you're excited about.

52
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,280
So get in those comments and let us know

53
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,800
what you wanna hear in August.

54
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,880
But for right now, Eva's here.

55
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,120
You presented a number of ideas.

56
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,120
This was no draconian.

57
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,640
You made a demand of us.

58
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:41,280
You gave us agency in this discussion and we appreciate it.

59
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,720
But are you happy with where things land?

60
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,160
Are you secretly pining for one of the other topics

61
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,880
or would you like to throw anything out there

62
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,080
as, well, I would like to do this at some point?

63
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,240
No, I mean, I feel like we had

64
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,840
a really interesting discussion.

65
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,560
I threw a lot of stuff at you guys.

66
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,800
There was some weird celebrity auctions coming up.

67
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:04,800
There was a very bad sounding immersive play

68
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:08,120
that I was gonna maybe force you to go to.

69
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,720
There was talk about you kidnapping us,

70
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,480
which I'm assuming would be like,

71
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,880
you pick us up from a location in your car

72
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:17,640
and you take us somewhere without telling us.

73
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,400
I think it might've been this immersive play

74
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,240
that I was reading about.

75
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,080
Probably the immersive play.

76
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,040
Any details about the immersive play?

77
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,760
I don't remember that one, no.

78
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,760
It was called Club Babaloo.

79
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,600
Oh, that was good.

80
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,120
Wait a minute, I thought Club Babaloo

81
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,240
was more of a themed bar rest.

82
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,560
I keep getting hands for Club Babaloo.

83
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,400
I know, I mean, I was getting ads for it.

84
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,360
I was like, maybe we should all,

85
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,400
I mean, we could still go to Club Babaloo, you guys.

86
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,440
Is Club Babaloo the haunted tiki bar?

87
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,280
No. The horror tiki bar?

88
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,880
Think about the name.

89
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,720
What else could the name be, Jason?

90
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,800
I don't know.

91
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:51,120
I've gotten so many, like, it's a tiki bar, but it's haunted.

92
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,760
It's a tiki bar, but it's sci-fi.

93
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,760
I just keep getting fed these.

94
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,640
This is like a show.

95
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,600
It's like a burlesque show, I think,

96
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:04,480
but you're backstage at a 50s sitcom or something.

97
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,520
And it seems like there's a lot of actors who are like,

98
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,440
well, I don't know.

99
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,640
And I don't know.

100
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,880
It's like, there's like,

101
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:14,360
you could get a special table with like a sandwich.

102
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,560
They bring you like a sandwich,

103
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,440
but the sandwiches all look like pre-wrapped,

104
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,120
kind of like 7-Eleven sandwiches.

105
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,560
I have not been to this, but I was like,

106
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,320
man, this could be real rough.

107
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,160
Yeah.

108
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,600
Because Club Babaloo is the name of Ricky Ricardo's club

109
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,760
that he starts on, I Love Lucy,

110
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,640
after he leaves the Tropicana.

111
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:32,800
This seems like it had some I Love Lucy crossovers.

112
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,640
Yeah.

113
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,400
The other thing I suggested was possibly,

114
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,720
and I don't want to like blow too many ideas out,

115
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,280
but like some of the Buena Park entertainment district.

116
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,120
Yeah.

117
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:44,960
Sure.

118
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:45,800
Places that you guys have never touched.

119
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,440
There's the potential for a mini saga

120
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:51,960
just in going down Beach Boulevard and hitting all of the,

121
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:52,800
cause there's a lot.

122
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,640
Right.

123
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:56,400
We've never done Medieval Times.

124
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,480
We did Pirates of the Intervention,

125
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,800
but we haven't done the burlesque body.

126
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,640
Teatite version.

127
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,480
Oh, I'm sorry.

128
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,300
Teatro Martini.

129
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,140
I'm so sorry.

130
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:03,980
Yeah, Teatro Martini.

131
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:04,820
You did Teatro Martini?

132
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:06,800
I did not do Teatro Martini,

133
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,360
but I'm sad to say I believe Teatro Martini has closed.

134
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,200
What?

135
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,040
Oh, man.

136
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,840
I think maybe there's another show

137
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,280
or maybe it never came back.

138
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,480
I will look into it.

139
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,280
I'm not a hundred percent on this,

140
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,480
but I feel like there has been some developments.

141
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,880
Will you please announce the right way

142
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,120
that Teatro Martini has been closed,

143
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,000
that it's been compromised to a permanent end.

144
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Teatro Martini has been compromised to a permanent end.

145
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
And the rings, the long sheet

146
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,520
that someone was spinning off of on the roof

147
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,760
just ripped and the whole cast fell down.

148
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,600
Yeah.

149
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,880
Fell ten stories onto a hardwood floor.

150
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,480
They can't all hang on it at once.

151
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,800
They were asking for trouble.

152
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,360
Well, that, you know.

153
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,880
This was never an option,

154
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,640
but I was texting Eva separately

155
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:58,880
about this weird thing called Elro a couple weeks ago,

156
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,920
which are like themed raves.

157
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,080
Oh, yeah.

158
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,800
Oh, those look really cool.

159
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,920
There's like a Navi themed rave.

160
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,000
It's in Vegas, right?

161
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,360
Monkey pox super spreader event.

162
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,600
Navi avatar themed rave.

163
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,920
It's really funny how any text I get from any of you guys,

164
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:20,640
like really quickly devolved to like, I would do this.

165
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,720
I think I would do this.

166
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,720
I think we would, well, I would do this, yeah.

167
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,600
There's a lot of daring going on,

168
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,560
which comes up in this episode, I would say.

169
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,560
I mean, that's really the whole endeavor here,

170
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,680
but you gave, I guess,

171
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:38,680
what you landed on the official dare for today's topic.

172
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,800
So would you like to give in the prompts,

173
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,080
let Eva do whatever she wants?

174
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,880
What are we talking about today?

175
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,960
We are talking about a thing that's very specific

176
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:53,080
to the West Coast, it turns out, themed car washes.

177
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,520
Yeah.

178
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,920
Themed car washes.

179
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,960
It's a thing I discovered during COVID by accident

180
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,960
when I was driving around the South Bay.

181
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,320
And I just thought about it every day for years.

182
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:09,600
And so I decided, what I presented to you

183
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,280
is that we all go to a different themed car wash

184
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,520
and report back on our experience.

185
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,360
Yay.

186
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,280
And you guys, we did it, right?

187
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,840
We did it, yes.

188
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:22,760
And we legitimately don't know anyone's results.

189
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,600
Yeah.

190
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,320
So there'll be a lot of surprise for each other

191
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,400
and for the listeners.

192
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,240
What a blat.

193
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:31,240
This is a great assignment and a great discovery.

194
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:34,000
I truly did not know this area whatsoever.

195
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,440
Did anybody, have you guys ever stumbled upon

196
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,840
themed car washes out in the wild?

197
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:42,640
I mean, not seen, there's one in Burbank

198
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:47,640
that has a crazy, I don't know if it's googie architecture.

199
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,560
It just has a lot of ornate metalwork.

200
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,760
It looks very much like it's been there since the 50s.

201
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:58,760
There's one on Ventura Boulevard that's just hand car wash

202
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,720
and it just has a giant grotesque hand statue outside.

203
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,560
Yes.

204
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,400
With these horrible hands.

205
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,220
Which that's great.

206
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:08,880
That's like a Valley perennial item.

207
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,440
And that's what I love about this area in general

208
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,440
is that it feels very, cars are new.

209
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,320
How do we get people to our thing?

210
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,400
Well, we have to put like a big dumb item

211
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,920
or we have to shape our building

212
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,880
like a basketball or whatever.

213
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:26,960
It feels like such a 60s or even like a route 66

214
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,440
kind of thing.

215
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,480
But a lot of these are new.

216
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,720
I think the one that you ran into

217
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,760
that I think other people did,

218
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,640
that it's an entire chain of them.

219
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,960
And I think they're pretty new.

220
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,840
This isn't like some 50s thing.

221
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,520
This is in the last decade or so.

222
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:46,520
Yeah, they're a new but rapidly decaying company.

223
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,960
The same way Joe roadie made Animal Kingdom

224
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,040
to look like it was falling apart.

225
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,800
It feels like the same type of imagineering was going on.

226
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,520
That sort of care to detail has been put in these.

227
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,760
I mean, it is fun to add a little bit of

228
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,320
not Disney level theming,

229
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,600
but like miniature golf course level theming

230
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,120
into a daily errand.

231
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,600
Yes, yeah.

232
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,560
I want those everywhere.

233
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,540
I mean, this certainly relates to my love

234
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:13,640
of Fry's Electronics.

235
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:18,120
So people have really talked up these regional grocery chains

236
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:21,560
that have animatronics or weird little shows or what.

237
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:24,440
I mean, this is what I want out of any business.

238
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:27,560
I want it out of banks,

239
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:30,080
just any like borough out of like loan place.

240
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,560
I want it out of anywhere that you have to go.

241
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,560
You want a pre-show video before you go into any business.

242
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,440
Yes, yeah.

243
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,280
I agree.

244
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,360
Give me a little show.

245
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,200
Give me something to laugh at.

246
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,240
Educate me.

247
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,280
My wallet will open up wide

248
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,200
if you give me a little bit of entertainment.

249
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,440
Like that's more fun.

250
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,840
That's more fun than some of the banks

251
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:54,440
have like coffee bars in them now.

252
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,200
I remember there was one.

253
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,400
The Capital One Cafe.

254
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,800
Well, the Capital One Cafe is one,

255
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,640
but there was another one, I think it was a Chase

256
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,240
that Jane went into once

257
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,160
and they had gotten rid of all the tellers.

258
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,480
But there was coffee available and she went,

259
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,960
can I get a roll of quarters?

260
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,800
And they said, we don't do that here.

261
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:17,520
No quarters, no tellers set up,

262
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:20,800
but there is some probably awful coffee.

263
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,040
That's weird.

264
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,440
So you only go into like take out a loan or something?

265
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,960
Like what is this bank for?

266
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:31,360
I guess there's an ATM and you can get a macchiato.

267
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,880
I mean, I know the Capital One Cafe.

268
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:33,720
I haven't tried it yet.

269
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,960
There's one by the Americano where the coffee is discounted

270
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,120
if I pay with my Capital One credit card.

271
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,960
Haven't you not been there?

272
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:41,840
I know.

273
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:45,040
Is this automatically added to the Club Three

274
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,640
Votable Topics for next week?

275
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,480
Oh, maybe.

276
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,360
For Capital One Cafe, I've been to Capital One Cafe.

277
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,440
Julia Prescott and I went there at a nice time.

278
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,360
Yeah, absolutely.

279
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,080
But I like, I mean, I do like Bank Mask.

280
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,960
There was a chain, Commerce Bank,

281
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,640
which I think eventually got absorbed

282
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,520
into the Wells Fargo system.

283
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:06,600
And they just had a very specific C logo.

284
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,240
And I think there was a walk around C?

285
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,080
A big C?

286
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:13,160
Like it's a big ornate C?

287
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,320
Okay, that's in there too.

288
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,480
I gotta find it.

289
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,520
They were definitely Bank C.

290
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:19,640
They got a lot of mileage out of that big C.

291
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:23,600
And I'm like, I'm pretty sure there was a walk around C.

292
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,240
That feels like a punishment

293
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:28,280
for the opposite of employee of the month.

294
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,400
You would have to slide into that C.

295
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,880
It would be really uncomfortable.

296
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:35,920
Yeah, your body's at like a weird scoliosis position.

297
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,640
Create an impossible yoga pose.

298
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,640
You have to walk around in for an hour.

299
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:41,840
It's a torture.

300
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:45,320
I would love if all of next month's suggestions

301
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,800
came from this episode.

302
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,360
If we can manage to produce enough.

303
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,200
Oh wow.

304
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,040
That's two right there.

305
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,880
But we also, we gotta leave it up to listeners.

306
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,840
Yeah, I mean, even one of your suggestions

307
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:58,520
was just like an interesting looking swap meet, I think.

308
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,360
Oh yeah.

309
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,360
A swap meet with a bakery

310
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,800
or some sort of like Pennsylvania touch.

311
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,080
Is it the one that's like east of, let me.

312
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:11,080
And then there was a motel with constructed teepees.

313
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,520
The Wigwon Motel.

314
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,960
The Wigwon Motel where it's like,

315
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,800
we might get murdered if we could have.

316
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,040
Oh, in San Bernardino.

317
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,200
Yeah, there's like a whole, there's a whole Route 66,

318
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:23,800
like just weird, bunch of weirdness

319
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,080
that you could experience

320
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,240
if you guys really wanted to take a road trip.

321
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:32,240
I mean, it's a road for, it's a car, it's for cars.

322
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,960
It's just supposed to delight and enchant you.

323
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,840
Yeah, yeah.

324
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,840
That's what I love about what we're doing here.

325
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,680
It's kind of like car entertainment.

326
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,640
Why leave it in the past?

327
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:49,800
I also, okay, so just thing one about any car

328
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,040
or even a non-themed car wash,

329
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,400
I don't wanna speak for everybody,

330
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:57,680
but I really enjoy and have always really enjoyed

331
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,080
driving into the car wash

332
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,920
and the little show happening around you

333
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,760
of your car being cleaned.

334
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,040
Sitting in the drive-through, that is great.

335
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:08,120
That is like a little ride, I think.

336
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,720
When I was a kid, when I learned

337
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,280
that was a thing you could do the first time I died,

338
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,280
oh my God, I lit it.

339
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:16,880
That's like a, that's a little like 45 second Disneyland

340
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,000
in your neighborhood, right there.

341
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:18,840
Oh man, yeah.

342
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,800
Early days of the pandemic, I was like,

343
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,600
I think this is a safe activity I can do.

344
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,120
Go to the drive-through Shell car wash.

345
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:26,960
Yeah.

346
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:29,400
But you weren't sure, exactly.

347
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:32,600
No one was sure, but there was a lot of people there.

348
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,600
I was not the only one who had that idea, so.

349
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,600
Oh man, I just watched, I just went to the,

350
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,960
the American Cinematheque is doing a

351
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,640
like depressing movies series they just wrapped up

352
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,840
called Bleak Week.

353
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:50,200
And they showed Adam McGuynes, the sweet hereafter.

354
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,280
Anyway, the opening of that movie,

355
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,040
which is about a school bus going through the ice

356
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,200
and everyone drowning,

357
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,640
is Ian Holm getting stuck in a drive-through car wash.

358
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00,480
Oh wow.

359
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,320
And having to get out of his car and walk through it

360
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,560
cause nobody is like manning the car wash.

361
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:08,560
And it's really, it's really triggering and crazy.

362
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,960
It's like a thing you never think about.

363
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:12,080
What if the car washes stop going?

364
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:12,920
I think about it.

365
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,120
Oh you do?

366
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:17,960
Well you can see Bill Bo Baggins himself have to,

367
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:21,840
looks like get shot in the face with the hoses and stuff.

368
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:24,280
That also, that happens in other very moving,

369
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:27,400
affecting scene in an affecting film, The Country Bears.

370
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,240
Yes it does.

371
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,920
Country Bears is one of the most extended people.

372
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,800
Diedrich Bader is running around,

373
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,640
and he's stuck in a car wash.

374
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,800
Their hair gets crazy.

375
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,280
Their hair gets so crazy.

376
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,120
Wait.

377
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,040
Did that stress you out?

378
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,760
So Mike, hold on.

379
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,680
I just want to confirm.

380
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,120
You have worried about being in the middle of it

381
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,560
and getting stuck and you have to walk out.

382
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,520
Or just like, or like,

383
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,240
I think that happens in A Final Destination.

384
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,840
I have worried like, oh what if like this thing

385
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:53,520
kind of like breaks or something and like smashes the window?

386
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,840
Oh, it comes through the window and the,

387
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,680
like something.

388
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,520
The big rolly brush like takes your head off.

389
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,360
Cause it is impressive.

390
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,680
Like it is like a big machine.

391
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:04,120
You're in a big like machine and machines break sometimes.

392
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,560
See I have had the opposite.

393
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,680
I've had a fan, like not a.

394
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,840
A fantasy of like,

395
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,920
what if I could walk through a car wash

396
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:12,960
and then I get it all.

397
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:13,800
Like cause that.

398
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:14,800
That's a different.

399
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,640
Okay.

400
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,280
I hear, I think I've thought that before.

401
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:19,920
I don't know if I ever described it as a fantasy.

402
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,760
I didn't say an erotic fantasy.

403
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,120
I just said a fantasy.

404
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,120
You did now.

405
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:29,520
I think, well I think there was a lot of water parks grow.

406
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:32,120
There would be like a play area where it's like,

407
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,840
oh, it's like you're walking through a car wash.

408
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,680
Isn't that funny?

409
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:37,080
And I was like, oh yeah, that would be fun.

410
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,600
Okay. Yeah.

411
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,240
So it's not like a foam fetish or something.

412
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,560
No, no.

413
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,400
Getting nice and sexy.

414
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:45,000
I would like to get brushed with a big brush though.

415
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,920
I just like put my arms up and turn in a circle.

416
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:47,760
It's like.

417
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,720
It'd be like a double dare.

418
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,120
Yeah. That feels better to me.

419
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,800
Being in the car is the thing that's scary.

420
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,120
Cause you're trapped in the car.

421
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,080
Oh, and it can be like a,

422
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,080
what if we came like a car compactor

423
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,760
and the car got smaller and smaller.

424
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,760
Yes. Yeah. Yeah.

425
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:01,920
Secret car compactor.

426
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:02,760
Yeah.

427
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:03,600
And then you're in the cube.

428
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,560
Right.

429
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,040
Like a top secret.

430
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,520
Is that happening top secret or,

431
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:11,040
or is there a naked gun where that happens to somebody?

432
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:11,880
Possibly.

433
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:14,320
I feel like there's one eighties movie where a guy gets like

434
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,240
packed into a car and then he's walking around

435
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,680
and the car's on him.

436
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,440
That's funny. Yeah.

437
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,360
A little cube walking around with arms.

438
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,440
Yeah. Yeah.

439
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,960
That's not, that's not how I pictured it going wrong.

440
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,280
I didn't think.

441
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,880
Well now you can add that to your list of things.

442
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,920
Maybe I will think about that.

443
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:34,520
And just, this might bear mentioning that,

444
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,400
you guys are, I think this might be in the Imagineering

445
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:40,920
story, that Tony Baxter mentions the drive through car

446
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:44,800
washes as an influence on the finale of the Indiana Jones

447
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,640
adventure.

448
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,480
Whoa.

449
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,280
That's what gave him the idea because you get that odd

450
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,960
little feeling when it's like the mood,

451
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:52,440
the room is moving around you and you can,

452
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,840
I do it every time I go like,

453
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,120
oh wait, did the car start moving?

454
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:55,960
Oh God. Yeah.

455
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:58,760
No, it's just that you're surrounded by walls and the walls

456
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:01,480
are moving, which is what happens.

457
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,360
I didn't, honestly, I,

458
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,120
I've been underselling how I don't think I realized what was

459
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:08,640
really happening in the boulder scene of Indiana Jones

460
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,040
adventure, where it's massive wall, all the cave walls.

461
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:12,880
Oh yeah.

462
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,640
And the boulder does not move.

463
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,720
It like, I stare at the diagram for a while to even get it.

464
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,960
That's one of those things where I've heard that explanation

465
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,600
and I still, when I'm on it, I don't get it.

466
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:23,440
I don't understand.

467
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,560
Like it doesn't, I still am like,

468
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,200
the boulder is coming at me though.

469
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,040
Well it's so dark.

470
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:27,880
I heard what he said.

471
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,640
It's so pitch black around you.

472
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,480
Right.

473
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,320
I love that part of-

474
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:34,680
The boulder that you can watch night vision POVs

475
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:37,080
of the ride that kind of show you.

476
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:40,760
Like that's a way to see through the mystery a little bit.

477
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,640
But hey, if this, if it's good enough for Tony Baxter,

478
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,080
then it's good enough for us.

479
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:45,920
Yeah.

480
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:50,000
And we all went and had various thrills in the world of

481
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,840
themed car washes.

482
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:55,160
I, where do we, where do we start?

483
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,120
Anybody want to dive in?

484
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,880
Well, I believe Mike, you did the OG

485
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:00,320
and I feel like maybe you should start.

486
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,160
Sure.

487
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,600
Mine is of course the green forest car wash.

488
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,440
Is that the first one?

489
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:08,000
And is that, is that the entire brand is green forest?

490
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:08,840
Yes.

491
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,960
But they have the, which theme of green forest did you?

492
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,240
The jungle.

493
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,200
You did jungle.

494
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,040
Yeah.

495
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,600
Which is in Hawthorne.

496
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,440
It's in Hawthorne, California.

497
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,640
All of these are in the South Bay.

498
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,520
So none of them are near where we live, except for Eva.

499
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:25,080
So it was, it was a little expedition for everybody.

500
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:25,920
Definitely.

501
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:26,760
Right.

502
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:27,960
So I just, to give you a little, the listener,

503
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:30,960
a little understanding of what a day was like.

504
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,080
Scott and I went to see a concert for babies,

505
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:33,920
Chuck E. Cheese live.

506
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:34,760
Same day.

507
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:35,600
She's on the pier.

508
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:39,360
And then I ate a tuna melt and then I drove to Hawthorne

509
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,120
to get my car washed.

510
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:45,000
So I missed the turn to get there

511
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,680
and I ended up in a target and.

512
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,640
You sighed, you crashed in.

513
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:52,760
Yeah, I blew, I crashed my car into a target.

514
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:56,120
And then I went to this jungle themed car wash.

515
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:58,280
The line was long.

516
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,120
Ooh.

517
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,520
People were.

518
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,360
It's a Saturday.

519
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,480
It was a Saturday.

520
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,160
I tried to turn left in there,

521
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,240
but there were so many cars backing up the street,

522
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,680
turning in right that I went around.

523
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:12,440
Cause I was like, it just, like not a good situation

524
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,760
to be putting my car in.

525
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,280
So I turned around, I turned,

526
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,880
I made like a U-turn at a certain point safely.

527
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:21,360
And I got in line for the cars and it took like 10 minutes

528
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,400
to get in there, to like pay before I started

529
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,840
getting the wash.

530
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:31,400
So you're immediately like there's the graphics everywhere

531
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:36,400
are like graphics you would see in some sort of like auto

532
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,680
store.

533
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,960
If that makes like here, let me show you what I'm,

534
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,160
I don't know that I even I'm describing them correctly.

535
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,400
Like this is enter.

536
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,840
They look like decals, like big,

537
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:49,120
like sticker decals that you could put.

538
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,720
The jungle theme is not evident in what you're showing us.

539
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,640
Well, right.

540
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:56,200
But it is evident in the different tiers

541
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,600
of car wash you can buy.

542
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:03,600
So the, I would say the graphic design is a little tacky.

543
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,720
Would that be fair to say, I mean,

544
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,000
I don't know what your experience is,

545
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
but it's a little bit tacky.

546
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,680
It looks, I don't know.

547
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,560
I guess I'm being a little snooty.

548
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:15,040
They gotta attract you to the different deals

549
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:17,040
and price ups.

550
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:17,880
Right.

551
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:20,000
So there are three options at this point.

552
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:20,840
Okay.

553
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:24,120
So there are two like drive through lanes essentially.

554
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26,000
And that's where you pay for the car wash.

555
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,640
And again, they were both packed

556
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,440
and it took me a little bit to get in there.

557
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,760
So there are three tiers.

558
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,760
Lowest is jungle.

559
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,520
Second, the middle one is bubble Kano

560
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,600
and the highest is volcano.

561
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,520
Vol is better than volcano.

562
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,680
I'm not sure.

563
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,520
Yes.

564
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,120
Does volcano at your location come

565
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,720
with a free towel or air freshener?

566
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:54,560
Whoa.

567
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,240
No.

568
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,840
So this is only some of them.

569
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,320
Because you also went to a green forest.

570
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,840
You went to one within the family.

571
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:03,680
Yes.

572
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,520
Okay. Okay.

573
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,360
Yeah.

574
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,680
So no, I did not get anything for free, but so, so yeah.

575
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,920
Do you want me, I'll read what it comes with.

576
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,080
Yes, sure.

577
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,720
Okay. Well, we need to do a thorough investigation of this.

578
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,680
What level did you go for?

579
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,520
Volcano.

580
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,360
I did too.

581
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,520
Yeah. I think at that point, yeah, just go all out.

582
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,800
Turbo day, turbo day.

583
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:24,640
I don't know.

584
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,800
So you get turbo day with it.

585
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:30,800
Wheels cleaned, foam bath, clear coat polish,

586
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:35,520
the shine rain shields.

587
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,200
And they're all like kind of sort of icon graphics

588
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,560
to describe what these things are,

589
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:40,960
but I still don't really know.

590
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:45,320
And then it just says premium car wash.

591
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,720
So, okay.

592
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,560
So what I thought was interesting here is that

593
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,920
there are single prices

594
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,480
and there are monthly unlimited prices.

595
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,440
So you can get like a monthly pass.

596
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,920
There's a magic key program.

597
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:01,960
There's a magic key program for the car washes.

598
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:04,960
And it's only like double the price of a single car wash.

599
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:05,800
Yeah.

600
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,640
So did you do it?

601
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,400
If you lived in Hawthorne, you'd be home by now.

602
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,280
You'd be washing your car every night.

603
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,120
Yeah.

604
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,000
If I lived in Hawthorne, I would have gotten it, yes.

605
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:17,080
Although it was only $24 versus $13 for the volcano.

606
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,080
So I guess I should have.

607
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,680
Unlimited, if you were near one of these

608
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,960
and you could time it where you weren't,

609
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,440
there wasn't a big line of cars.

610
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,880
Getting your car washed every day would be pretty sweet.

611
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,400
If you guys had a little kid

612
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,440
and they liked going through the car wash,

613
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,720
I mean, you'd be wasting so much water,

614
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:33,760
but it was pandemic and there's nothing else to do.

615
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,440
You just drive the kid through the car wash

616
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,760
like every two days.

617
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,160
You could even, yeah.

618
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,040
And you could tell like the people,

619
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:41,040
hey, turn the water off.

620
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,840
We just want to go in and see the big wheels

621
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,520
and the machines.

622
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,360
The rollers.

623
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,200
If there's lights, make the lights go.

624
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,160
Yeah.

625
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,800
So I got that.

626
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,760
I will say this, the consoles that you buy,

627
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,320
the car wash were kind of cool.

628
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,400
Like I like it, it's a big blue console.

629
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:00,800
I believe they have Apple Pay available.

630
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:03,080
This isn't some like rinky dink operation.

631
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,320
This is like a real.

632
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,600
Was yours in a gas station?

633
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,440
No.

634
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,260
Behind a gas station?

635
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:09,100
No.

636
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:09,920
Okay, that's interesting

637
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:12,920
because I went through the Bell Gardens one

638
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:16,200
and it was attached to a 76.

639
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,440
And it seemed like they were separate businesses,

640
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:22,360
but they weren't like, you kind of had to work.

641
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:27,360
You had to go in 76 to get your free air freshener towel.

642
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,520
Okay, so there was some sort of cooperation

643
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,480
between the two businesses.

644
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,320
What you're saying.

645
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,160
Yeah, because you're like,

646
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,200
after you went through the car wash,

647
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,760
you were in like a gated parking lot

648
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:40,160
for the, all the vacuum stations.

649
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,480
Well, maybe a deal has been worked.

650
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,320
I guess so.

651
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,860
Or reached between the two parties, you know,

652
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:45,840
cause there's nothing like that going on here.

653
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:49,520
This is just a pure jungle themed car wash.

654
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,840
So yeah, there's big like, everything is green.

655
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,640
So like a big green fence outside.

656
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,480
Where like the, you park your car after

657
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,800
if you're going to get it blow dry

658
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:00,800
or you're going to get it vacuumed.

659
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:05,800
So I went through and immediately you see a big fake place

660
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:11,160
plastic lion looking at you through some, you know,

661
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,860
like trees or shrubs or whatever.

662
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:14,360
If you can see this guy here.

663
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,200
Oh boy.

664
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,040
Yeah.

665
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:16,860
Yeah.

666
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:17,700
Looking sharp.

667
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:21,640
And there's a big, there's a big picture of a lion

668
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,880
on the side of the building that says,

669
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,680
and there's a big thing above it that says,

670
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,760
get ready for an adventure.

671
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,840
And the lion is like, or excuse me,

672
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:34,160
the tiger is staring at you with his like eyes,

673
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:36,120
his evil tiger eyes.

674
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,720
I mean tigers aren't evil, but they scare me.

675
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,480
So I'm saying they're evil tiger eyes.

676
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,560
And then you basically like, it's again,

677
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,400
everything is slow.

678
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,840
This is busy, it's a busy day.

679
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,120
So I got a lot of time to look

680
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,640
at the different static figures.

681
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,720
There's something of like a, I don't know,

682
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,760
like a snow leopard, not a leopard,

683
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,280
but like a, some sort of a cat,

684
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,760
some sort of a big white cat.

685
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,400
Sure. Sure.

686
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,640
Which one scared you?

687
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,120
Does, did that one scare you?

688
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,960
No, that one didn't scare me.

689
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,840
There's a giraffe here.

690
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,680
Great.

691
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:11,960
There are some fake rocks sitting here.

692
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,160
Yeah.

693
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:15,720
And then there's like a toucan as well.

694
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,560
Let me tell you something.

695
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:21,920
I'm reacting as if I don't know a little of this.

696
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,920
I did go to this car wash as well.

697
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:29,280
I also, I went, this is not my main one

698
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,400
that I'm reporting on.

699
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,400
However, this episode was in the air.

700
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,480
For a different episode,

701
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:37,320
I went down to Redondo beach and then ended up in Hawthorne

702
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:39,000
with the friend of the show, Buzz Buzz.

703
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,720
And we of course had to go pay homage to the spot

704
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:44,120
where the beach boys house was

705
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:46,240
before it was demolished to build a freeway.

706
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,680
There's a monument there.

707
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,160
So we went and paid our respects.

708
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,400
And then I'm like, well, I'm 10 minutes away

709
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,280
from the jungle car wash.

710
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,760
So I got to do it too.

711
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,560
So I've experienced the things that you're just going to.

712
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,520
Yeah.

713
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,960
I've been to the jungle.

714
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:02,000
I also, I mean, this is how I discovered the idea.

715
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,200
That you went to the jungle first.

716
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,760
I just found the jungle and I laughed like a maniac

717
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:09,160
for like the entire, there was no line when I went.

718
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:11,760
And I just was like, what the, what the fuck is this?

719
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,120
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

720
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:17,080
So three, three Colonel Kurtz's who have gone up river

721
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,280
and are in the jungle.

722
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,640
The horror.

723
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,240
When you're alone, you're like looking over,

724
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,760
you're like, you can't explain this to anybody.

725
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,640
It was that feeling to be like, what?

726
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,480
Yeah. And you wonder.

727
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,320
I feel bad about your weekend visit now too,

728
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:33,800
because mine was like Wednesday at 4 p.m.

729
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,440
It definitely, I'm sure took a lot of time than mine.

730
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,640
Cause I definitely felt like I was in this line forever.

731
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,840
I was waiting for this forever.

732
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:43,040
And there's just, yeah, there's a bunch of like old,

733
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:45,240
again, old looking stuff.

734
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,040
I don't know that it's that old,

735
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:50,000
but it looks like it's been decaying rapidly.

736
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:50,840
Great. Yes.

737
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,040
Rody level.

738
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:52,880
Yes.

739
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:56,680
I mean, moisture must not be good for statues

740
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,600
not meant to be in moisture, right?

741
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,560
Yeah, no.

742
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,560
These aren't, they are not like car wash brand

743
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:05,440
of animal statue, like meant to withstand

744
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,280
the insane elements.

745
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,120
Right.

746
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:11,040
Like whatever the tire polishing material,

747
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,520
they can't absorb it.

748
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:13,680
The plastic can't deal with it.

749
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:16,720
The humidity of an actual rainforest, basically.

750
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:17,560
Right.

751
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,320
So just constant moisture

752
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:22,920
and then unrelenting sunlight, Southern California.

753
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,920
The light that they talk of drawing people here

754
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:32,760
but also playing on people's mind and driving them insane.

755
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:35,560
Curing their tuberculosis, but also...

756
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,520
Yeah.

757
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,800
Also, maybe I should start a cult.

758
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,520
We should get a cult going out here.

759
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,880
So the building itself is painted.

760
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,000
And it's interesting because the painting on the building

761
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,040
that is supposed to represent a forest,

762
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:53,480
if you look at it, it looks kind of cool.

763
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,080
But when you're driving by it,

764
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:57,360
it looks dirty and looks like shit

765
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,520
at the same time.

766
00:27:58,520 --> 00:27:59,760
Do you know what I mean?

767
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:03,160
This is kind of cool, not Mary Blair-ish,

768
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,840
but maybe a little bit adjacent.

769
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:05,680
They did a mural.

770
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,520
It's a mural.

771
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:10,320
It's a big mural on the side of this car wash building.

772
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,120
And you can appreciate it for what it is,

773
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,400
but also, yeah, it just is coated in a cover,

774
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:18,640
like a thin, thick layer of dirt.

775
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,760
That's what it feels like.

776
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:20,600
It is, yeah.

777
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:23,280
It's exposed to dirt and chemicals all day.

778
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,800
I mean, that would be the problem, I think,

779
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:27,560
with Jason's fantasy of running through,

780
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:29,880
I think the chemical exposure is gonna be bad news.

781
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:32,240
Yeah, I think the chemical exposure, the turtle,

782
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,920
yeah, you're probably not supposed to get blasted

783
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,720
by turtle wax.

784
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,920
Blasted by a turtle wax cannon.

785
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,280
Only one way to find out.

786
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,240
Yeah.

787
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,080
What would be the worst?

788
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:42,360
Would it be the clear coat polish?

789
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,320
Would it be the foam bath?

790
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,560
I'm worried about the shine.

791
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:47,720
I don't think we have enough information about the shine.

792
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:48,640
Yeah.

793
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,960
Yeah, it's like the logo of the shine

794
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,320
looks like a sitcom logo.

795
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,320
The shine.

796
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,280
Featuring the shine.

797
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:02,920
So, yeah, so I'm getting very excited in line.

798
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,400
It's taking a while, but I am excited.

799
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,800
I'm like, oh, wow, okay, here we go.

800
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:09,440
So there's like, yeah, there's like a monkey figure

801
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,640
hanging from a fake, dirty palm tree.

802
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:16,920
And then there is a, I guess, is it a llama?

803
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,120
Like this is like a llama,

804
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:20,040
and then there's just a rusty old chain

805
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:23,320
hanging in front of it, and it is not on purpose.

806
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:26,200
I thought it was a screaming deer.

807
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,320
No, you're probably, yeah, you're right.

808
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:29,000
It is a screaming deer.

809
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:33,800
Its eyes look like it's been cut out.

810
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,920
Like the front of its eyes have been sliced

811
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,880
and it's screaming in pain.

812
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:43,400
So it's not even slaughtered,

813
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,440
because you're not slaughtering it

814
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,480
like you're going to eat its meat.

815
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,320
You're maiming it.

816
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,160
This is torture.

817
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,440
You're maiming a deer, yeah.

818
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:50,400
And then there's just a big rusty chain

819
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,400
hanging in front of its head

820
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,480
as if it's about to be like wrapped in it.

821
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,440
Could be part of the torture.

822
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:56,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that might be the next step.

823
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,040
Some unfortunate deer.

824
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:00,640
Yeah, and then at that point,

825
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,840
you're about to go into the main event,

826
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:07,360
and you get like a fun little portal thing

827
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,640
that again explains to you the different levels,

828
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,360
even though you've already paid.

829
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:14,080
So I'm not exactly sure what the point of that is.

830
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,840
And then there is music, right?

831
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,440
Hold on, like I have a video here.

832
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,880
Oh.

833
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:22,120
I forget if there was music or not before that.

834
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,680
Maybe there wasn't.

835
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,000
I didn't get any.

836
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:25,840
Maybe I'm wrong.

837
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,840
Maybe I was trying to soundtrack it myself.

838
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,040
So you had steel drums in the car.

839
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:30,880
Well, yeah.

840
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:31,840
They were piping it in.

841
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,280
I have a boombox in the back with the.

842
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:35,840
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

843
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,840
Jungle car wash.

844
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,120
Nothing more fun than that.

845
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:43,360
That's as long as it takes him to write a song.

846
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,040
So yeah, so you go in there.

847
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:48,120
Now, I don't know why I was thinking

848
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:50,520
that there would be some sort of plastic figures

849
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,840
in the actual car wash.

850
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:53,880
I was thinking that.

851
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,920
This is maybe, this is a tough area

852
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,640
for a lot of what we're talking about today

853
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:00,760
is that it is tough to theme the wash part itself.

854
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,760
And I think we should all give bonus points

855
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:07,240
to any of these where the wash components are also themed.

856
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,080
Yes.

857
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:08,920
It's tough to do.

858
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:11,640
I give them credit, anybody credit for,

859
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,920
you trying or not trying and failing?

860
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:16,960
Right, but I will give them credit for lights.

861
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,880
There are lights going on here that are very fun.

862
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:25,880
And when, so there's red, orange and green lights.

863
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,120
Did you guys have both of those?

864
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:28,960
Yes.

865
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,880
And I felt like the orange lights

866
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,680
are supposed to represent lava.

867
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:35,640
Oh, volcano.

868
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,840
Wait, maybe I didn't get the lights

869
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,080
because I didn't do volcano.

870
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,600
Oh, you get better, like a better light show.

871
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,280
I think you maybe get a better light show.

872
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:43,040
I should have turned around and tried it again.

873
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,200
The line was very long.

874
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,520
Yeah.

875
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:46,360
And I was very,

876
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:48,800
I ate a lot of Chuck E. Cheese already that day.

877
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,360
The concert, not the restaurant.

878
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:52,440
I wasn't eating cheese pizza.

879
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,200
They weren't serving Chuck E. Cheese food

880
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,720
at the Chuck E. Cheese concert.

881
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:59,560
So you get red, orange and then green.

882
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,840
And I think that, yeah, I think,

883
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,080
I don't know what the red is.

884
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,560
The red is maybe, I don't know, hell.

885
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,240
Like I'm not sure exactly what the red is,

886
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,080
but the orange felt.

887
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,960
It's been a deforestation in the jungle.

888
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,800
I guess lava's a red light.

889
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:10,960
It's eerie red light.

890
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,440
Bolsonaro's burning down the forest.

891
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,280
Yes.

892
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:15,800
Yeah, yeah.

893
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:18,480
He's got COVID again and he's enraged.

894
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:22,040
Given his sad little thumbs up from a hospital bed.

895
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,760
They just have a hospital bed in the presidential office

896
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,320
in Brazil at this point.

897
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,160
Yeah, yeah.

898
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:31,000
I thought the Bolsonaro statue in the,

899
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,480
in the floor wash was kind of important.

900
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,760
Yeah, yeah, it was odd.

901
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,160
But at least some theming.

902
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:41,080
So yeah, maybe the red and the orange are both lava.

903
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:42,560
And I thought the orange is,

904
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,080
I've mentioned this recently that my,

905
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,400
one of my favorite things is,

906
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,200
I think it was Disney's America that I like

907
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,600
when they do like steam and orange light

908
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,000
to make it look like fire.

909
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Like they added a big thunder.

910
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:53,920
And what they would have had

911
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:57,640
in the industrial revolution ride at Disney's America

912
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,000
when you were escaping.

913
00:32:59,000 --> 00:32:59,840
Smelting.

914
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:00,680
Smelting, yeah.

915
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,520
Molten steel.

916
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,040
The idea of smelting.

917
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:06,400
So I was like, okay, this is, I'm a big fan of this.

918
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,560
Yeah, did you guys?

919
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:09,040
Whoa, that's cool.

920
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,240
No, I did not get this.

921
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,280
Okay, well volcano is the way to go.

922
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:13,840
No question about that.

923
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:14,680
Yeah, and then at that point,

924
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,360
do you remember the colors you got?

925
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:18,440
I may have not gotten a lot of colors.

926
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:19,280
Really?

927
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,640
I didn't say a lot of colors, I did the easiest one.

928
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,480
Really?

929
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,040
So then yeah, so then it goes to green.

930
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,360
I wanna show you guys this.

931
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:25,200
Let me see.

932
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,640
This is a whole world of colors.

933
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:30,000
So yeah, so like red is flashing here.

934
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,200
This is cool.

935
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,080
Which I, yeah, it was very cool.

936
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:34,320
And then at a certain point,

937
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:37,120
so like my windshield is getting scraped now.

938
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:43,120
And then it turns into the orange here.

939
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,480
Oh, great.

940
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:47,000
You're in the gates of hell.

941
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
That's right.

942
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,800
And I'm now dueling with Satan.

943
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,320
Those are his teeth.

944
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,160
Those are his teeth.

945
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,400
They're rubbing against your windshield.

946
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:58,440
And then of course, he's realizing that I'm a pure soul

947
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:01,480
and he releases me back into the kingdom.

948
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,320
He doesn't belong here.

949
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,800
Into the kingdom of heaven.

950
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:06,000
And it's green now.

951
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:06,840
Green means go.

952
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,520
Lush forest.

953
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:09,360
Green means go to heaven.

954
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:10,200
Wow.

955
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:11,600
And then there's story.

956
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:14,080
So yeah, so I was excited about the colors.

957
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,240
And then I was like, okay,

958
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:19,680
there's gotta be like a triumphant animal.

959
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:23,520
But the first thing you see is a dirty barrel.

960
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:28,520
Not a barrel of monkeys.

961
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,280
Not a barrel of monkeys.

962
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:32,640
And then you got, so the,

963
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:34,760
what do you call the big floppy things

964
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,920
that get on your windshield to try to get the water off?

965
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:37,760
You know what I'm talking about?

966
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,200
Like the big rags kind of.

967
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,200
Yeah.

968
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:45,000
Like big rubber rags that are like getting the stuff.

969
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:45,920
Oh yeah, so there's a blue,

970
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:48,800
there's a big flashing blue one too at the end here.

971
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,320
So I think that that's what you're paying for.

972
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,160
I think you're paying for the light show.

973
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:53,000
Yeah.

974
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:53,840
That happens.

975
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,840
Should have taken some LSD, my man.

976
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,000
You gotta really time that.

977
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,160
That's a tough time though.

978
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:03,960
From what I understand about LSD.

979
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,880
LSD lasts 12 hours.

980
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:08,880
That's why the line was so long.

981
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:13,520
People are like, I'm waiting for it to kick in.

982
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,520
Go around me.

983
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,000
And the trippers.

984
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,760
And then you come out and then yeah,

985
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:21,600
you see a whole menagerie of animals.

986
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,440
Lion.

987
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,760
Yeah, oh, they're all waiting for you.

988
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,720
I got out and went back and revisited.

989
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:28,200
I spent a lot of time with my friends.

990
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,400
A couple of parrots, a really big one,

991
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,840
a really big bird, like an eight year old kid

992
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:35,520
sized bird.

993
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:38,440
Cool, like you'd find a Jumanji walking in the jungle.

994
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,520
Yeah, exactly.

995
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:44,520
And then there's two anthropomorphic flower characters.

996
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:45,760
Oh.

997
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:46,600
Cute.

998
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,440
Oh, cute.

999
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,280
Love them.

1000
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:51,200
And one of them has on the leaves or the petals,

1001
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:55,280
wait, wait, and then the other one says go, go, go.

1002
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,520
So I believe they light up when you're supposed to wait

1003
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,080
and when you're supposed to go.

1004
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,040
I believe that's what happens.

1005
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:04,120
So you take a hard left into a regular parking lot

1006
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:07,400
and you can get your car vacuumed.

1007
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:10,960
But all of the vacuum stations all have

1008
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,960
an individual dirty palm tree with the top

1009
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,120
of the dirty coconut.

1010
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:15,960
Right.

1011
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,640
Those are my favorite parts, I think.

1012
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:20,280
Did you see it, wait, about the elephant.

1013
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,120
Did you not see an elephant?

1014
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,280
Oh, did I mention, I saw an elephant.

1015
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,840
Did I, I guess I forgot to mention him.

1016
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,520
Did he have a little Hulk statue

1017
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,640
standing on his head when he was on?

1018
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:28,920
What?

1019
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,720
Wait, I don't think you did for me either.

1020
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,160
I remember you sent me this picture.

1021
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,240
I have it, hold on.

1022
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:36,080
Hold on.

1023
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,400
You keep talking, I'll pull it up.

1024
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,120
Okay, okay, well what else?

1025
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,360
I'm gonna, let me find that.

1026
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,200
I have a photo of the elephant.

1027
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,120
Did you go to the bathroom?

1028
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:44,160
Because the bathroom had tropical plants inside.

1029
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,440
Oh, I didn't go to the bathroom.

1030
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,200
Yeah, you had to walk through the office

1031
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,840
of the people who work there and they look at you weird.

1032
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:50,680
But then.

1033
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:52,360
You guys didn't see this?

1034
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:54,760
That was not on my elephant's head.

1035
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:57,200
There was a tiny triumphant Hulk standing

1036
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,600
on top of the elephant's head.

1037
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,760
I think he got rid of it.

1038
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:01,600
Yeah, I would have.

1039
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:02,440
Wow.

1040
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:03,280
You got a minus point.

1041
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,360
Hulk is proud of you.

1042
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:06,600
This photo is, yeah.

1043
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:09,200
Car wash flash green, color of Hulk.

1044
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,320
2021.

1045
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:13,400
Clean windshields are good.

1046
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:16,320
Wait, so you went over a year ago.

1047
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,160
So this is a.

1048
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,000
Wow, that's an old one.

1049
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,720
I went in like, yeah, mid 2021.

1050
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:21,560
Wow, wow.

1051
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:23,160
Oh, that Hulk's long gone.

1052
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,520
Some nasty little kid hopped out of the car

1053
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,160
and was like, mine now.

1054
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:29,600
It's next to, it was next to the parrots.

1055
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,320
That's well, I hate to say.

1056
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,840
I remember you sent that photo and I'm like,

1057
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,840
oh, we gotta do the car wash episode now.

1058
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:38,320
But minus points for getting rid of Hulk.

1059
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,520
Well, we'll make sure everyone gets to see the Hulk.

1060
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:43,200
Yeah, yeah, he lives in photographic memory.

1061
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,960
They could have gotten sued by Disney for that.

1062
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:46,800
Yeah.

1063
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,360
They just had to get rid of it for legal reasons.

1064
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:53,040
So what do you think, just judged as a themed experience,

1065
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,240
how did this compare against some of the other things

1066
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,160
we talk about like the haunted mansion?

1067
00:37:57,160 --> 00:38:00,720
Well, if we're comparing this to haunted mansion.

1068
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:07,000
If I had to rank this against the Disney rides or okay,

1069
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:11,000
I would say it's, or all the rides, Transformers,

1070
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,640
this car wash, Rise of the Resistance third.

1071
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:14,480
Yes, of course.

1072
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,320
Yeah, good answer.

1073
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:16,160
That's very fair.

1074
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:18,640
That's what I would say.

1075
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,640
Wow, geez, wonderful.

1076
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,440
Okay, where are we moving next?

1077
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:24,440
Are we going, are we sticking with the chain

1078
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:25,680
and going to Jason?

1079
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:29,200
Yeah, I will go.

1080
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:32,280
My experience was a little more different

1081
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,800
because the setup was different.

1082
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:37,000
So they did have big clear signs of like,

1083
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:41,600
cheap car wash here so you could see it from the road.

1084
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,200
Does it say cheap car wash?

1085
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,880
It says $5 express Monday through Sunday.

1086
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:50,200
But there was also a themed sign.

1087
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,720
If you can see this,

1088
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:55,000
dinosaurs are the theme of the Belle Garden.

1089
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,800
Dinosaurs, hell yeah.

1090
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:59,600
And there's, so as soon as I saw the list,

1091
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:02,760
I was like, since I was a little kid, I loved dinosaurs.

1092
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,080
I still like dinosaurs a lot.

1093
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:06,360
So I was like, well, I'm gonna go to the dinosaur one.

1094
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:08,360
Great, you picked, you're based on your interest.

1095
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:10,360
Yeah, and if you can see,

1096
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:12,360
like this one was kind of hard to get a shot of,

1097
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,520
but there is a dinosaur statue pretty quickly

1098
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,040
when you go in.

1099
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:18,720
And there's one you can see when you go out

1100
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:21,200
and the rest is kind of just painting.

1101
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,680
Oh, there's another guy.

1102
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:25,080
There's a like spitter kind of dinosaur.

1103
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,680
Oh, cool.

1104
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:29,160
So a similar setup, as Mike said,

1105
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:31,280
you pull into the credit card thing.

1106
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:34,720
And I went last Sunday morning

1107
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:37,600
and I was like, okay, it's a beautiful day outside.

1108
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,080
It's Sunday morning.

1109
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:41,840
I was preparing myself for a line.

1110
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:42,680
And so I go down.

1111
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,360
What does that look like

1112
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:45,680
when you're preparing yourself for a line?

1113
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,440
I was like, oh, I bet.

1114
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,680
Do you like get a drink?

1115
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,880
It's, I make sure you go to the bathroom

1116
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:52,720
before you leave the house

1117
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,480
but you also have a cold bottle of water

1118
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,240
cause it could be waiting a while.

1119
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,080
So-

1120
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:57,920
No milkshakes though.

1121
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,240
No milkshakes.

1122
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:03,520
I got a little treat, but so this-

1123
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,360
For the line?

1124
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,920
No, after where everything was done.

1125
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:09,760
So this is in Belle Gardens, California,

1126
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:13,840
which I hadn't really been through before.

1127
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:16,680
And there is like residential neighborhoods

1128
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,360
around this gas station,

1129
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:19,880
but leading up to the gas station,

1130
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:22,800
it was mostly empty office parks.

1131
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,080
And when I was getting back on the freeway to leave,

1132
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:27,800
I saw the bicycle casino hotel.

1133
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,640
Have you ever seen?

1134
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:29,480
I've never been there.

1135
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:31,160
Really not.

1136
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:32,760
I walked in there once

1137
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:35,120
and took a picture right before I came in

1138
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,680
and immediately like, what are you doing?

1139
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:37,680
Why did you do that?

1140
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:40,200
And then I walk in and it's just nothing but joyless game.

1141
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,840
Like, and everyone looking at you,

1142
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:44,040
like get out of this place.

1143
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:46,280
It is not a place you're supposed to go.

1144
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,120
Yeah.

1145
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,840
Sorry to take away from this real quick.

1146
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:53,440
The gambling in there is like, is it just table stuff?

1147
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,280
Is it slots?

1148
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,720
I forget.

1149
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,600
Some things miss say it is one of those,

1150
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:01,040
where like a type of gambling is not there.

1151
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:04,040
There's that hotel that's on the way down to Disneyland

1152
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:06,360
and I forget that has like gambling in it.

1153
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:07,200
And we stopped in there

1154
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,400
because it says something about casino.

1155
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,240
And we're like, oh, this might be-

1156
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:10,080
Commerce?

1157
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:10,920
Is it commerce?

1158
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:11,760
It's on the five.

1159
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:12,600
I think that's-

1160
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:13,420
And you go in-

1161
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:14,400
It's just look like you could like jump out the window

1162
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:17,040
and land on the five if you wanted to kill yourself.

1163
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:19,880
Yes, it's perfect for that.

1164
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,320
But yeah, you go inside and you're like,

1165
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:24,200
the gambling looks like it's just a temporary,

1166
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,960
it looks like just a bunch of people set up tables

1167
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:28,360
and people like it's packed in there.

1168
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:30,360
And it doesn't even like, you wouldn't recognize it

1169
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,520
as gambling.

1170
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,600
You would think that everybody's like having a meal

1171
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:34,640
if you weren't looking.

1172
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:35,600
Oh.

1173
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:37,880
Really it's an odd vibe in there is what I'm saying.

1174
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:38,720
Yeah.

1175
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:39,540
And it's not like-

1176
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:41,840
These straight California casinos are weird.

1177
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:44,640
You can't have slot machines in certain places.

1178
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:45,640
Right.

1179
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:49,800
No, I worked on this reality show like a long time ago

1180
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:54,120
called Driving Force, which was about a drag racer

1181
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:57,240
named John Force and his three sexy daughters

1182
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:58,520
who also were drag racers.

1183
00:41:58,520 --> 00:41:59,360
And he's like-

1184
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,200
Driving Force?

1185
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:01,040
John Force?

1186
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:01,860
John Force.

1187
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:02,700
Yes.

1188
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:03,540
Wow.

1189
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:04,640
He's a famous drag racer.

1190
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:05,480
He is, wow.

1191
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:06,560
It's like he drives nitro cars

1192
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,720
that have like the parachute and stuff.

1193
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:12,760
But they lived in like Yorba Linda

1194
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:17,080
and his daughters, like he was a terrible father

1195
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:19,680
and he would scream at the daughters all the time

1196
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:20,680
in the footage.

1197
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:22,360
And the main thing he would scream at them about

1198
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:24,480
is that he grew up in a trailer in Belle Gardens

1199
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:25,540
and they're so spoiled.

1200
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:26,440
And he would just say, it was like,

1201
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:28,120
so the only association I have with Belle Gardens

1202
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:31,600
is like John Force's traumatic backstory.

1203
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:33,560
And I think we made him take the daughters

1204
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:34,960
to the trailer at some point.

1205
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,080
And the daughters just cried

1206
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:38,440
because like Belle Gardens was so bad.

1207
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:39,480
Oh my God.

1208
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:44,600
That show ended because one of the cast members exploded.

1209
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:45,440
Whoa.

1210
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,760
Did you explain?

1211
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:50,600
No, you like-

1212
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:51,440
In a car.

1213
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,560
He crashed to the nitro car and exploded.

1214
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:54,400
And-

1215
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,220
Not John Force though.

1216
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:56,140
No, one of the other teammates.

1217
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:56,980
It was very sad.

1218
00:42:56,980 --> 00:42:58,400
It was like the first one of those accidents

1219
00:42:58,400 --> 00:42:59,240
that happened a long time.

1220
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:00,080
Oh my God.

1221
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:02,440
And my boss, the show runner,

1222
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:05,940
who went on to run Intervention,

1223
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:06,920
went to the network and was like,

1224
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:07,840
hey, we can still do the show

1225
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:08,900
even though the guy exploded.

1226
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:11,060
We'll just make the show about how the guy exploded.

1227
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:13,380
And the network was like, no.

1228
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:15,380
You canceled immediately.

1229
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:18,900
Did a season come out or?

1230
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:20,500
Yeah, there's like two seasons.

1231
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:23,580
They made us do like really, really elaborate

1232
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:27,860
Kentucky fried chicken integrations into scenes

1233
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:30,460
where John Force would come home with a bucket of chicken

1234
00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:31,340
and be like, hey kids,

1235
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:32,780
I just got this great new product

1236
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:34,060
from Kentucky Fried Chicken

1237
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:37,340
and treat it like it was like a reality TV scene.

1238
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:39,380
Bell Gardens, I couldn't eat this good.

1239
00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:40,700
Really? Seriously?

1240
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:42,260
Yes.

1241
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:43,220
Anyway, Bell Gardens.

1242
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:44,420
That's John Force.

1243
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:45,260
I'm hanging up John Force.

1244
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:46,740
Wow, the footsteps of Force.

1245
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:47,580
Yeah.

1246
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:49,780
Wow, his real name was John Force.

1247
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:50,620
Yeah.

1248
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:51,860
Wow, John Force.

1249
00:43:51,860 --> 00:43:53,460
John Harold Force.

1250
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:54,580
Yeah.

1251
00:43:54,580 --> 00:43:56,540
That's like not as, well it is.

1252
00:43:56,540 --> 00:44:01,020
It's Schwarzenegger's name in Commando is John Matrix.

1253
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:01,860
Yeah.

1254
00:44:01,860 --> 00:44:02,700
Yeah.

1255
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:03,520
Cool.

1256
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:04,880
Cool.

1257
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,880
Okay, so you're in the footsteps of Force.

1258
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:11,400
Yeah, so I'm walking in the footsteps

1259
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:15,800
of fucking legends, of giants, okay?

1260
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:18,200
Not just the dinosaurs, not the footprints.

1261
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:19,520
I mean the Force footprint.

1262
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:22,800
And here was my impression of Bell Gardens

1263
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:26,040
as I'm a few blocks away from this car wash.

1264
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:30,880
It was on a Sunday morning, mostly deserted office parks

1265
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,360
and those giant, you know, giant like five story

1266
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:39,040
office buildings that say like Chase or Bank of America.

1267
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:42,440
And you think, if you think long enough, you're like,

1268
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:46,360
why does this bank chain need, why do they have so many

1269
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:50,720
of these weird little office parks in the middle of nowhere?

1270
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:52,080
Can't be the whole building, right?

1271
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:52,920
Good question.

1272
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:53,760
Yeah.

1273
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:54,600
What's the rest of it?

1274
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:57,000
I guess you just pay, you pay a little extra in your rent

1275
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,240
to have your name on the side.

1276
00:44:58,240 --> 00:44:59,880
Sign, you see it on the freeway.

1277
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:04,880
So until I came up on the area, which was a lot of gas

1278
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:09,960
stations and some strip malls and fast food and stuff,

1279
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:13,480
I was like, what is this neighborhood?

1280
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:17,160
And so then it opens up and it's gas stations and all.

1281
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:20,760
And I looked up the, on the website, it says,

1282
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:25,000
located behind the 76, turn in off this street.

1283
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:29,440
So I follow the instructions, I see the car wash

1284
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:32,520
and there's the big signs, he can't miss it.

1285
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:33,880
And there's no line.

1286
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:35,400
I pull right up to the gate.

1287
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:36,600
I don't wait at all.

1288
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:39,240
And another car pulls into the other pull in spot,

1289
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:40,160
starts to go in.

1290
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:43,440
And so I'm looking, okay, there's a couple dinosaur statues.

1291
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:47,240
And then there is a guy with a mop, just mopping.

1292
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:50,240
And he like just points, like pull up there,

1293
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:51,520
this way more, this way more.

1294
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:55,160
And I see all these instructions, like,

1295
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:58,760
take your, turn your antenna off, take your antenna down,

1296
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:02,400
put your car in neutral, take your hands off the wheel.

1297
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:04,200
And I'm like, what?

1298
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:05,440
It's okay.

1299
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:08,560
And I'm glad he was there because you have to,

1300
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:10,880
and I was talking to my mom about,

1301
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:13,840
I went to this car wash and I hadn't done one

1302
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:15,600
where you had to like put your car in neutral

1303
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:16,840
and it pulls you through in a while.

1304
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:20,320
And she's like, yeah, I think I like hit something

1305
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:21,200
on one of those.

1306
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:23,080
She's like, I don't like those anymore.

1307
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:26,280
Cause like, I, usually they don't direct you how to do it

1308
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:27,720
and you can fuck up your car.

1309
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:28,880
And so I was.

1310
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:30,680
I'm stressed out by that section

1311
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:31,920
where they tell you that stuff.

1312
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:34,480
But all the, all the car washes around,

1313
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:36,040
or a lot of the car washes are in,

1314
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:37,720
that are in the gas stations are the ones

1315
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:40,400
where you just pull in and sit.

1316
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,280
I think it was a kid, we did do the ones

1317
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:43,240
where it would pull you along.

1318
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:46,280
So I haven't done that in two decades or more.

1319
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:49,160
And I loved those as a kid too.

1320
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:51,920
So I was very excited to be one,

1321
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:55,000
cause there's a bunch in the Valley where it's like,

1322
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,880
you pull up and it does go through one of those car washes,

1323
00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:00,400
but you get out and the guy takes it through

1324
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:03,200
and then they, you know, wipe it down afterwards.

1325
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:06,080
I want to be a little boring.

1326
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:07,120
Give me a ride.

1327
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:11,240
And also one of those ones on a nice day at LA,

1328
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:14,240
I was like, oh, I have an hour before we have to record.

1329
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:15,880
I'll go get a car wash.

1330
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:18,280
And I am just sitting there waiting,

1331
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:19,960
just watching the clock.

1332
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:21,920
And I text you guys like 15 minutes

1333
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:23,560
before we're supposed to record.

1334
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:27,320
Hey, can we push half an hour?

1335
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:28,680
I'm still at a car.

1336
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:31,040
I've been at this car wash for 50 minutes

1337
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:32,720
and my car hasn't gone through.

1338
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:36,240
So in the end that ended up being a 90 minute ordeal.

1339
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:37,360
Oh no.

1340
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:42,360
And so I was very happy that this was very fast.

1341
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:44,520
Too fast almost.

1342
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:47,800
Cause I was like, the car got hooked in.

1343
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:51,080
I started going through, I got the $10 volcano wash

1344
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:53,640
and I was like, here comes the light show.

1345
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:58,640
And immediately my car is coated in so much bubbles.

1346
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,640
I can't see anything.

1347
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:01,480
Oh no.

1348
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:02,320
It is like a,

1349
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:05,080
have you ever been in a whiteout snowstorm?

1350
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:06,240
No, yes.

1351
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:10,000
I have driven in a whiteout a handful of times in my life

1352
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,360
in Ithaca.

1353
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:12,600
It's terrifying.

1354
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:13,760
Yeah, very scary.

1355
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:15,960
And that is what this car wash was like.

1356
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:18,680
I think there was a flash of colored light at the beginning

1357
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:20,840
and then it was just soap bubbles.

1358
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:22,480
Multiple times.

1359
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:23,320
Cause the volcano wash,

1360
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:26,160
you get three different levels of polish and soap.

1361
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:29,920
Could you tell like hints of light coming through?

1362
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:31,400
No, I couldn't really see.

1363
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:33,160
So I don't think there really was.

1364
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:34,000
That's what I was getting.

1365
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:34,840
Yeah.

1366
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:35,920
Cause like, it was a thick,

1367
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:37,480
I had a thick layer of bubbles as well,

1368
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:39,160
but you could tell there was lights there.

1369
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:40,000
Yeah.

1370
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,360
You had intro dinosaurs?

1371
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:44,200
Yeah, I had intro dinosaurs.

1372
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:45,960
And then when I'm, you know,

1373
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:48,200
you're coming out of the car wash and it blasts you

1374
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:49,120
with just water.

1375
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:51,680
And then it like hair dryer blasts.

1376
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:54,720
And then there is at the end,

1377
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:59,040
you get, there was a light saying like, stop, don't go,

1378
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:00,640
don't go, it's green.

1379
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:02,280
Now you can put the car in drive.

1380
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:06,720
And then there was a 25 foot mural of dinosaurs.

1381
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:07,560
Oh yeah.

1382
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:08,840
That's a great mural.

1383
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:09,680
That was great.

1384
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:10,520
That's so long.

1385
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:11,360
That was so exciting.

1386
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:14,120
I was so excited to come out of the whiteout conditions

1387
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:14,960
and see dinosaurs.

1388
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:18,120
It's like seeing the brontosaurus for the first time.

1389
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:20,720
Yeah, like Jurassic Park.

1390
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:21,560
Yeah.

1391
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:22,600
And then there was,

1392
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:25,240
there is a brontosaurus on top of the building.

1393
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:28,680
This is what it looks like from after.

1394
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:31,440
And there is just so many,

1395
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:35,280
there was like 10 vacuum spots.

1396
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:38,840
And I was happy cause I had a bunch of fucking shit

1397
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:41,320
in my car, you know, crunched leaves or whatever

1398
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:42,400
to vacuum up.

1399
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:43,360
Leaves?

1400
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:44,920
Like, yeah, leaves.

1401
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:45,840
Like from hiking?

1402
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:47,440
I park under trees.

1403
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:49,240
There's trees next to where I park.

1404
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:51,080
So sometimes stuff gets in there.

1405
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:51,920
Yeah, you're tracking it.

1406
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:52,760
Yeah, you're tracking it.

1407
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:53,600
I guess that's.

1408
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:56,400
And so I was also like pulling into this parking spot

1409
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:59,200
and I was like, all right, let's see how this,

1410
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:00,160
did this work?

1411
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:03,600
Like how, how did, like, I was like, is my car look,

1412
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:06,040
cause I just got blasted with so much soap bubbles.

1413
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:07,560
I was like, did this do any, and I get out

1414
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:10,320
and I was like, Jesus Christ, the car looks brand new.

1415
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:13,040
This is like maybe the best car crash I've ever gotten.

1416
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:15,200
Good job, Bell Gardens.

1417
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:16,760
I guess I didn't talk about mine.

1418
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,360
Mine looked fine.

1419
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:19,200
It looks good.

1420
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:20,840
Yeah, I know complaints here.

1421
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:21,760
It looked great.

1422
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:25,600
I, it looked better than like the $20 wash.

1423
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:29,640
Like I've gone in Burbank where people, you know,

1424
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:30,560
wipe it down.

1425
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:33,440
And so then I have to take the receipt inside

1426
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:35,080
because at this location,

1427
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:38,120
you get either a free air freshener or a free chamois towel.

1428
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:38,960
Wow.

1429
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:39,800
I guess.

1430
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:41,800
So I go inside and I'm like,

1431
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:43,840
hi, I just got the volcano wash.

1432
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:45,640
And they're like, okay, do you want the towel

1433
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:47,160
or do you want the air fresheners?

1434
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:48,800
And I was like, oh, do I pick one off this rack?

1435
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:53,400
And they're like, no, you can have vanilla or,

1436
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:55,560
I think it was vanilla, new car smell.

1437
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:58,000
I forget the other ones, berries.

1438
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,800
Like there was like five and they had

1439
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:02,960
shootier, shootier air fresheners.

1440
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:05,000
But they were still the official little trees,

1441
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,160
air fresheners.

1442
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:08,880
My favorite discovery about a year ago,

1443
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:11,200
the air fresheners you see at every car wash

1444
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:12,560
made in the USA.

1445
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:16,120
And the brand name is Little Trees.

1446
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:16,960
Oh, trees.

1447
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:18,280
And I think that's cute.

1448
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:19,200
Oh, that's great.

1449
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:21,440
I got the vanilla one.

1450
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:24,400
And they must've thought I was crazy

1451
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:27,360
because I went back into the car wash a couple of times

1452
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:29,280
because I went in to get the thing.

1453
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:31,640
And then I was like, oh, you know what?

1454
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:33,200
It's a long drive back.

1455
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:34,720
I should use the bathroom.

1456
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:37,720
And I go in to, I saw the bathroom door.

1457
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:40,640
I go up and it's a door with no handle.

1458
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:45,120
And it just says, cashier will open the bathroom for you.

1459
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:48,040
And they like buzz the bathroom door.

1460
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:49,760
And then inside there was a button

1461
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:51,600
to get out of the bathroom.

1462
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:54,840
And I was like, okay, so this is how they keep crazy people

1463
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:57,120
out of this bathroom trap for too long.

1464
00:51:57,120 --> 00:51:59,320
Yeah, John Force ain't getting in that bathroom.

1465
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:04,320
And John Force, no, he cannot camp out there.

1466
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:10,200
Scott, I mean, this was a pretty big,

1467
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:14,960
this was the 76 and pretty big convenience store in it.

1468
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:18,400
Scott, I thought you'd appreciate the wine section

1469
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:21,560
partially hidden by the planters, peanut mixes,

1470
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:26,560
and also the most industrial looking closet next to it.

1471
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:28,080
Wow.

1472
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:30,520
And a fun little wine sign up top.

1473
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:31,800
That's a great swirly dubbing.

1474
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:33,400
Yeah, this belongs in your garage.

1475
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:35,440
Yeah, you should get the wine sign.

1476
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:37,000
Soon as this place is out of business.

1477
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,360
But you just puffed them up with your good review.

1478
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:42,400
Yeah, the only thing about the bathroom

1479
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:46,320
I was a little put off by was this handwritten sign

1480
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:51,320
that said, please don't flush toilet paper down the toilet.

1481
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:54,600
And I was like, oh, I don't.

1482
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:56,120
Let me take a look at that.

1483
00:52:56,120 --> 00:52:57,240
You're in Greece.

1484
00:52:57,240 --> 00:52:58,080
Please don't.

1485
00:52:58,080 --> 00:52:58,920
You're in a foreign country.

1486
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:00,920
I looked at it a number of times just to make sure

1487
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:03,680
I wasn't misreading paper towels, but it for sure says,

1488
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:05,840
please don't flush toilet paper down the toilet

1489
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:07,640
with a smiley face.

1490
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:09,320
And it is like, yeah, so I was just trying to,

1491
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:13,080
yeah, it is a piece of paper that's posted.

1492
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:16,360
Could it be a prank from a car wash user?

1493
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:20,120
No, it sounds like their pipes can't handle anything.

1494
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:23,760
Yeah, can't handle half ply, Scott toilet paper.

1495
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:27,280
Was there a garbage can in the stall next to the toilet

1496
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:29,840
full of shitty paper?

1497
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:32,880
I did not, there was a massive garbage can in there.

1498
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:36,200
So I guess, I guess they found a working ground.

1499
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:38,160
I kind of feel like you dropped the ball here.

1500
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:40,240
You could wash your butt in the car wash.

1501
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:41,080
Yeah.

1502
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:43,200
You stick your butt out the window.

1503
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:47,600
Bend over and shine please.

1504
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:48,960
Moon the dinosaurs.

1505
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:51,880
Yeah, pick your level of whole wash.

1506
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:56,720
Volcano.

1507
00:53:58,080 --> 00:53:59,640
Bubble, bubble cano.

1508
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:00,880
V-Wax, yeah.

1509
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:04,440
So got the Manila air freshener.

1510
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:05,320
I was like, you know what?

1511
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:07,880
I haven't gotten a big fountain soda in a while.

1512
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:09,960
And they say like 99 cents outside

1513
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:13,080
for a massive jug of soda.

1514
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:15,760
I got Coke Zero, so that's zero calories anyway.

1515
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:17,080
But there was definitely.

1516
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:17,920
It's good for you.

1517
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:18,760
It's good for you.

1518
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:19,600
It's healthy.

1519
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:20,420
Yeah, yeah, full fat.

1520
00:54:20,420 --> 00:54:22,040
And then I saw something where I was like,

1521
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:26,960
oh, an interactive element for the show.

1522
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:29,480
A little treat that I can share with everyone.

1523
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:31,040
Something that's come up multiple times,

1524
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:33,200
but I rarely see in California.

1525
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:35,640
I got this big bag of IndyCaps.

1526
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:36,640
Hot Fries.

1527
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:39,320
IndyCaps Hot Fries.

1528
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:40,160
Oh man.

1529
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:41,480
From my childhood.

1530
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:43,800
So in the interest of, I bought them.

1531
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:47,880
And in the interest of making Scott,

1532
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:50,160
turning Scott into a little junk food freak,

1533
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:51,320
like me and Mike.

1534
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:52,320
I see.

1535
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:53,620
We can all enjoy it.

1536
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:57,080
Well, we learned while eating Mariah's cookies

1537
00:54:57,080 --> 00:54:59,960
that people love when we eat next to Mike.

1538
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:00,800
Yeah, they want that Mike sound.

1539
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:01,640
Yeah, so.

1540
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:02,480
Nom, nom, nom.

1541
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:04,240
You go that way, go the right way.

1542
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:08,080
Why don't you stop the recording as we all sample it.

1543
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:08,920
Oh, that's a good idea.

1544
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:09,740
And then you can start it again.

1545
00:55:09,740 --> 00:55:10,580
Okay, sure, yeah.

1546
00:55:10,580 --> 00:55:11,420
Let's try it.

1547
00:55:11,420 --> 00:55:12,240
All right.

1548
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:16,200
So we've all had a few of IndyCaps delicious hot fries.

1549
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:17,440
Thank you, IndyCap.

1550
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:18,280
Thank you.

1551
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:19,360
You know what?

1552
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:20,360
I liked them.

1553
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:21,200
That's pretty good.

1554
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:24,200
Maybe I shouldn't be so afraid of eating like Jason.

1555
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:25,040
Yeah.

1556
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:26,600
Or any of you.

1557
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:27,840
I think. That's solid.

1558
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:31,360
Three or four are probably what you're supposed to eat.

1559
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:34,480
This bag was like a $1.25.

1560
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:35,320
Oh no.

1561
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:36,600
It was unseasonably cheap.

1562
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:39,480
It has three servings.

1563
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:41,440
This whole bag is 400 calories.

1564
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:44,280
Oh, they have barbecue fries now.

1565
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:46,520
I was gonna say, what are the other options for IndyCap?

1566
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:48,960
Cheddar fries and barbecue fries.

1567
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:51,680
And so like they would sell little mini bags of this

1568
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:54,280
at like all the schools I went to growing up.

1569
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:55,120
They did not.

1570
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:56,400
I did not have that growing up.

1571
00:55:56,400 --> 00:56:00,100
I don't think they cared any of IndyCap's food

1572
00:56:00,100 --> 00:56:00,940
or where I'm from.

1573
00:56:01,820 --> 00:56:02,660
Sorry, go ahead.

1574
00:56:02,660 --> 00:56:05,940
I was just gonna ask if you felt like it embodies

1575
00:56:05,940 --> 00:56:08,700
the spirit of IndyCap particularly.

1576
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:09,540
I think so.

1577
00:56:09,540 --> 00:56:12,580
I mean, IndyCap's whole thing is he's a lush,

1578
00:56:12,580 --> 00:56:15,900
he's a bum and his wife is always mad at him.

1579
00:56:17,860 --> 00:56:20,980
So I think, yeah, he likes these snacks.

1580
00:56:20,980 --> 00:56:22,940
They probably go good with a pint.

1581
00:56:24,020 --> 00:56:26,020
Cause I feel like he's always at the pub.

1582
00:56:26,020 --> 00:56:27,180
The bitter drinking.

1583
00:56:27,180 --> 00:56:28,020
Yeah.

1584
00:56:28,020 --> 00:56:28,840
What were you saying, Eva?

1585
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:31,920
I'm reading an interview with John Force's chef

1586
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:33,160
of what he likes to eat.

1587
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:36,960
So there's a recipe here

1588
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:39,960
for speedy Southwestern potato salad.

1589
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:40,800
Whoa.

1590
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:41,640
And so a drink-

1591
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:43,880
We've been talking a lot lately about eating like Walt,

1592
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:46,680
but now we can eat like John Force.

1593
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:48,520
He has a drink called a whole shot win,

1594
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:49,400
which I don't know what that means,

1595
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:52,120
but it's like frozen raspberries, lemonade,

1596
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:54,620
raspberry vodka and cranberry juice.

1597
00:56:55,560 --> 00:56:57,360
I guess Mr. Force drinks that.

1598
00:56:57,360 --> 00:57:00,160
Although he only, when I was working on the show,

1599
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:02,720
his favorite thing to say was coffee up, beer down.

1600
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:06,000
Anyway.

1601
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:06,820
Coffee up, beer down.

1602
00:57:06,820 --> 00:57:09,400
All right, now take a shot of raspberry vodka

1603
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:10,520
and get in that car.

1604
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:12,400
It ain't my fault if it explodes.

1605
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:14,080
Turbocharged tenderloin.

1606
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:18,800
All the food has to be speed and force.

1607
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:20,280
What does John Force look like?

1608
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:21,120
Oh boy.

1609
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:22,960
Oh yeah, take a look.

1610
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:24,480
Oh yeah, you're gonna love it.

1611
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:25,320
Does anyone feel like describing him?

1612
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:26,560
I mean, I'm gonna look it up, but do you have a-

1613
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:30,560
He looks like, he kind of looks like the Kennedy

1614
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:31,960
that Cheryl Hines is married to.

1615
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:33,120
Yeah, Google him.

1616
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:34,760
Yes, yeah, totally.

1617
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:37,160
But like more like a racer version.

1618
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:39,120
Oh yes, very, yeah.

1619
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:43,320
Like the way when Biden was still keeping the fake teeth up.

1620
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:44,160
Yeah.

1621
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:46,840
He looks like, yeah, he's like 2012 Biden.

1622
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:49,160
He's like he's got George Washington's dentures

1623
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:50,440
in his mouth.

1624
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:51,280
Wow, yeah.

1625
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:54,280
Okay, well, which makes him look kind of Busey-esque.

1626
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:55,280
He looks like a Busey.

1627
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:56,120
Right, right.

1628
00:57:56,680 --> 00:57:57,880
He's extremely Busey-esque in the way he talks

1629
00:57:57,880 --> 00:57:59,440
and his mannerisms and stuff.

1630
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:02,800
He looks like, I've seen people mention,

1631
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:07,480
use this phrase that like, he looks like he put his face

1632
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:09,800
through the face app to put the smile on it,

1633
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:11,720
but that's just his regular face.

1634
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:12,560
Yes.

1635
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:15,800
Well, we have another option if anyone wants to hear

1636
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:17,760
a full John Force episode.

1637
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:18,600
We might- Oh wow.

1638
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:19,440
It's very possible that even-

1639
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:20,260
It's very possible that even-

1640
00:58:20,260 --> 00:58:21,100
It's a foregone conclusion at this point.

1641
00:58:21,100 --> 00:58:21,940
Yeah, yeah, I think so.

1642
00:58:21,940 --> 00:58:23,320
Even you're gonna get called into service

1643
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:25,360
on every Club 3 if we're not carrying,

1644
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:26,640
you're gonna get a permanent spot.

1645
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:28,800
I could talk about funny car racing all day.

1646
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:29,640
Sure.

1647
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:32,480
Jason, do you know, is Andy Cap owned

1648
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:34,040
by King Feature Syndicate?

1649
00:58:34,040 --> 00:58:35,480
He might be a King Feature Syndicate.

1650
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:36,320
I don't know, he's not on one of the-

1651
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:38,160
I'm trying to find the answer to that.

1652
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:40,440
He's not on Toon Lagoon anyway.

1653
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:41,840
He might not be.

1654
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:44,640
That's, I'm kind of feeling he's not

1655
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:46,280
in the King Feature Syndicate family.

1656
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:48,280
I feel like Andy Cap would sometimes,

1657
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:52,120
in certain newspapers, I mentioned this recently,

1658
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:56,360
there were weird extra comics under the word puzzles

1659
00:58:56,360 --> 00:59:01,360
and the chess puzzle, the chess game.

1660
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:05,920
But yeah, so yeah, I got myself a big Coke Zero too

1661
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:08,080
because all the signs everywhere were like,

1662
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:10,840
our cups stay colder for longer.

1663
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:12,160
And I'm like, well, good, hey,

1664
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:14,760
there's some accidents on the freeway, long drive back.

1665
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:17,800
I'll be able to enjoy a cold beverage the whole time.

1666
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:19,660
And I'm like, I wonder what makes them colder longer.

1667
00:59:19,660 --> 00:59:21,240
And the revelation was just,

1668
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:24,800
oh, these cups are just massive styrofoam jugs.

1669
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:25,880
These are just, I-

1670
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:28,480
Oh, just bring the styrofoam back?

1671
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:31,760
Yeah, it's just styrofoam, that's the trick.

1672
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:32,800
Only in Foley Gardens.

1673
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:33,640
Yeah.

1674
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:34,720
Well, let's boil it down.

1675
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:37,960
How do you rate this purely in the theming department,

1676
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:38,960
as a themed experience?

1677
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:42,200
Sure, as a themed experience, I mean, I had a walk-on,

1678
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:44,640
so that always makes it a little better.

1679
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:46,160
No queue.

1680
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:47,000
No queue.

1681
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,360
Well, no, he got through the queue fast.

1682
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:49,680
I got through the queue fast.

1683
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:50,520
Okay, that's cute.

1684
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:51,360
Yeah, that's fast.

1685
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:53,120
And there were dinosaur statues in the queue.

1686
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:55,640
Like I said, if there was a light show,

1687
00:59:55,640 --> 00:59:57,960
it was so much soap, I could not tell.

1688
00:59:57,960 --> 01:00:01,040
Like I think, yeah, the impression of lights,

1689
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:04,520
like as Mike was mentioning, would have shown up a little.

1690
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:05,820
Yeah.

1691
01:00:05,820 --> 01:00:07,000
Yeah, the service was good.

1692
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,920
The people at the gas station were very nice.

1693
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:10,160
It was a busy day.

1694
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:14,400
Gas in Bell Gardens is much cheaper than the Valley.

1695
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:15,240
Okay.

1696
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:16,060
That was my worst experience.

1697
01:00:16,060 --> 01:00:18,800
I tried to go to the ARCO across, like down the block.

1698
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:21,000
It was so cheap there.

1699
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,320
And everyone was just coming from every door.

1700
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:25,300
There were cars pointing every which way.

1701
01:00:25,300 --> 01:00:28,560
And I was like, I am going back to the gas station

1702
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:30,800
with the car wash to get there.

1703
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:32,080
Oh, you left in return.

1704
01:00:32,080 --> 01:00:33,240
I left in return.

1705
01:00:33,240 --> 01:00:36,400
So those people must've thought I was insane

1706
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:38,720
coming in and out of the,

1707
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:43,160
making that many transactions at the gas station.

1708
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:44,880
But you wanna put it next to a ride.

1709
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:48,780
Is there a ride that you think is not as good as?

1710
01:00:49,420 --> 01:00:54,420
Well, I think like in terms of like not a huge weight,

1711
01:00:54,460 --> 01:00:57,860
but still a reasonably good experience,

1712
01:00:57,860 --> 01:01:00,060
the vacuums kind of worked.

1713
01:01:01,380 --> 01:01:03,860
But overall pretty pleasant.

1714
01:01:03,860 --> 01:01:06,780
I'll put it, I would maybe like Mike and Sully

1715
01:01:06,780 --> 01:01:09,540
to the rescue, the Monsters Inc ride.

1716
01:01:09,540 --> 01:01:10,380
Wow.

1717
01:01:10,380 --> 01:01:13,180
So solid, but like, could use a little more,

1718
01:01:13,180 --> 01:01:15,420
oomph, he could plus it up a little more, you know?

1719
01:01:15,420 --> 01:01:16,260
It doesn't seem like,

1720
01:01:16,540 --> 01:01:18,980
you're talking like 10 dinosaurs ultimately.

1721
01:01:18,980 --> 01:01:21,620
Like it's not fully immersive,

1722
01:01:21,620 --> 01:01:22,820
but that mural looks solid.

1723
01:01:22,820 --> 01:01:24,420
Yeah, the mural was cool.

1724
01:01:24,420 --> 01:01:27,700
And I had a pleasant experience.

1725
01:01:27,700 --> 01:01:28,660
Great, great.

1726
01:01:28,660 --> 01:01:29,500
Wow.

1727
01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:30,320
Amazing.

1728
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:31,160
Eva?

1729
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:33,020
All right, so just jump right to it.

1730
01:01:33,020 --> 01:01:34,740
I went on the Green Forest website

1731
01:01:34,740 --> 01:01:39,100
and I picked the farthest one away, San Pedro,

1732
01:01:39,100 --> 01:01:43,300
which has a big squid and appears to be ocean themed.

1733
01:01:43,300 --> 01:01:44,620
Ocean, okay.

1734
01:01:44,620 --> 01:01:47,300
Big squid, there's a little octopus is hanging from it.

1735
01:01:47,300 --> 01:01:49,300
There's a dolphin, you see like,

1736
01:01:50,220 --> 01:01:51,540
and I had to get to,

1737
01:01:51,540 --> 01:01:55,820
I had to go to a comedy show in Irvine.

1738
01:01:55,820 --> 01:01:57,860
So I was like, I'll go to San Pedro,

1739
01:01:57,860 --> 01:01:59,020
wash my car and then I'll go to Irvine.

1740
01:01:59,020 --> 01:02:01,620
Not actually in the same direction at all.

1741
01:02:01,620 --> 01:02:03,300
Okay, yeah, you feel like it is.

1742
01:02:03,300 --> 01:02:05,380
Yeah, but then I had to go way back north again

1743
01:02:05,380 --> 01:02:09,060
to go south again, to go to the Spectrum Center,

1744
01:02:09,060 --> 01:02:10,220
which is, I don't know if you guys have been

1745
01:02:10,220 --> 01:02:11,500
to the Irvine Spectrum Center.

1746
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:12,340
I have, yeah.

1747
01:02:12,340 --> 01:02:14,300
It's a, hell.

1748
01:02:15,140 --> 01:02:18,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah, really confusing and super packed.

1749
01:02:18,500 --> 01:02:19,340
Yeah.

1750
01:02:19,340 --> 01:02:20,700
Yeah, but I would go to the ends of the earth

1751
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:23,100
to see Sebastian Maniscalco like you did.

1752
01:02:23,100 --> 01:02:28,100
I mean, I did go to the comedy laugh factory

1753
01:02:29,860 --> 01:02:31,260
in the Irvines.

1754
01:02:31,260 --> 01:02:32,100
In the mall.

1755
01:02:32,100 --> 01:02:32,940
Yeah.

1756
01:02:32,940 --> 01:02:34,500
Oh, Maniscalco's playing the pond.

1757
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:37,340
He's playing the pond for seven nights probably.

1758
01:02:37,340 --> 01:02:40,260
Oh, I think he was like coming to Vegas

1759
01:02:40,260 --> 01:02:41,220
right after I had been there,

1760
01:02:41,220 --> 01:02:43,500
was playing the T-Mobile Arena or something.

1761
01:02:44,340 --> 01:02:46,660
I think he's all arenas all the time.

1762
01:02:46,660 --> 01:02:47,660
I did see a good show.

1763
01:02:47,660 --> 01:02:48,900
I'll tell you guys who it was off air

1764
01:02:48,900 --> 01:02:50,220
because it's a secret.

1765
01:02:51,980 --> 01:02:53,660
Just casting secret.

1766
01:02:53,660 --> 01:02:56,220
Anyway, okay, squid, squid, squid.

1767
01:02:56,220 --> 01:02:58,100
Very excited to see the squid.

1768
01:02:58,100 --> 01:03:00,580
Drive for like an hour plus.

1769
01:03:00,580 --> 01:03:01,940
Get there.

1770
01:03:01,940 --> 01:03:04,340
It's not, it's no longer.

1771
01:03:04,340 --> 01:03:05,180
What?

1772
01:03:05,180 --> 01:03:06,020
No.

1773
01:03:06,020 --> 01:03:08,460
No, it looks regular.

1774
01:03:08,460 --> 01:03:09,940
No.

1775
01:03:09,940 --> 01:03:13,140
The squid has been painted red, but keeps its squid.

1776
01:03:13,820 --> 01:03:14,660
Wow.

1777
01:03:14,660 --> 01:03:17,060
Oh, the sign is like a squid,

1778
01:03:17,060 --> 01:03:19,380
but now it just looks like bulbous.

1779
01:03:19,380 --> 01:03:20,220
Oh my God.

1780
01:03:20,220 --> 01:03:21,060
Bulbous sign.

1781
01:03:21,060 --> 01:03:22,060
But I'm like, I still got to wash my car.

1782
01:03:22,060 --> 01:03:25,500
So I put it up and there is a slight theme.

1783
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:26,340
Volcano.

1784
01:03:26,340 --> 01:03:28,060
Still volcano.

1785
01:03:28,060 --> 01:03:28,900
Yeah.

1786
01:03:28,900 --> 01:03:30,660
So you can get a lava luster wash.

1787
01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:34,100
That's it.

1788
01:03:34,100 --> 01:03:34,940
What's the price?

1789
01:03:34,940 --> 01:03:37,620
What's the price looking like there for the volcano wash?

1790
01:03:37,620 --> 01:03:40,300
20 for the top one's 20.

1791
01:03:40,300 --> 01:03:41,140
Oh, it's a much higher.

1792
01:03:41,140 --> 01:03:41,980
32.95.

1793
01:03:41,980 --> 01:03:43,060
That's a good price in Bogart.

1794
01:03:43,060 --> 01:03:43,900
Yeah.

1795
01:03:43,900 --> 01:03:45,500
Touch up, light clean only seven.

1796
01:03:46,500 --> 01:03:50,100
You can get monthly wheel blasters though for 1995.

1797
01:03:50,100 --> 01:03:53,460
That sounds good to me, John Force.

1798
01:03:53,460 --> 01:03:54,860
I love my wheel blasters.

1799
01:03:54,860 --> 01:03:57,540
This fucking crazy volcano that's like shooting

1800
01:03:57,540 --> 01:04:00,100
lightning down onto the car washes.

1801
01:04:00,100 --> 01:04:01,940
Yeah, that's pretty fun.

1802
01:04:01,940 --> 01:04:03,540
That's like an L Ron Hubbard book cover.

1803
01:04:03,540 --> 01:04:04,420
And when you drive in,

1804
01:04:04,420 --> 01:04:06,180
you see the volcano kind of above it.

1805
01:04:06,180 --> 01:04:08,140
And then there's red lights.

1806
01:04:08,140 --> 01:04:09,740
There are red lights flashing.

1807
01:04:09,740 --> 01:04:11,620
So they got rid of the squid

1808
01:04:12,260 --> 01:04:14,580
and it looked like there was like cute dolphins and stuff.

1809
01:04:14,580 --> 01:04:15,580
No explanation.

1810
01:04:15,580 --> 01:04:16,420
It's just gone.

1811
01:04:16,420 --> 01:04:19,260
So, but anyway, I got my car wash.

1812
01:04:19,260 --> 01:04:20,260
It was totally fine.

1813
01:04:20,260 --> 01:04:21,740
I think I did get a free little towel

1814
01:04:21,740 --> 01:04:24,020
they threw into my car, whatever.

1815
01:04:24,020 --> 01:04:26,220
And I was like, that's not good enough.

1816
01:04:26,220 --> 01:04:27,140
Yeah, no theme.

1817
01:04:27,140 --> 01:04:28,020
You got screwed.

1818
01:04:28,020 --> 01:04:30,980
So this week after work, I drove to Hermosa beach

1819
01:04:30,980 --> 01:04:32,820
and I went to the rock and roll car wash.

1820
01:04:32,820 --> 01:04:33,660
Oh yeah.

1821
01:04:33,660 --> 01:04:36,140
I was like, we need to do this again.

1822
01:04:36,140 --> 01:04:38,340
And there's only, it was one of the only remaining

1823
01:04:38,340 --> 01:04:40,260
themed car washes that nobody had done.

1824
01:04:40,300 --> 01:04:41,900
So the rock and roll car wash

1825
01:04:41,900 --> 01:04:45,740
is in like the heart of Hermosa beach, right off the one.

1826
01:04:46,820 --> 01:04:50,460
It has this big guitar on the sign.

1827
01:04:50,460 --> 01:04:51,740
And when you get up there,

1828
01:04:51,740 --> 01:04:54,500
these are the package menus you can have.

1829
01:04:54,500 --> 01:04:55,820
Wash package menu.

1830
01:04:56,700 --> 01:05:00,380
It starts in vocals for $22.99.

1831
01:05:00,380 --> 01:05:02,260
Then it goes to vocals and guitar.

1832
01:05:02,260 --> 01:05:04,260
That's cause you see, when you're recording a song,

1833
01:05:04,260 --> 01:05:05,540
you always start with vocals.

1834
01:05:05,540 --> 01:05:06,580
You start with vocals.

1835
01:05:06,580 --> 01:05:08,100
Number two is vocals and guitar.

1836
01:05:08,100 --> 01:05:09,820
Three is vocals, guitar and bass.

1837
01:05:10,420 --> 01:05:13,140
Number four is vocals, guitar, bass and drums,

1838
01:05:13,140 --> 01:05:14,820
the quote whole band.

1839
01:05:14,820 --> 01:05:16,620
And that's $34.99.

1840
01:05:18,220 --> 01:05:19,740
Wow, $34.99 is expensive.

1841
01:05:19,740 --> 01:05:20,580
And so there's a sign

1842
01:05:20,580 --> 01:05:22,380
about all the things they're not responsible for.

1843
01:05:22,380 --> 01:05:24,340
And then there's musical notes on it.

1844
01:05:24,340 --> 01:05:25,580
Stamps.

1845
01:05:25,580 --> 01:05:26,420
And fire.

1846
01:05:26,420 --> 01:05:27,260
And fire.

1847
01:05:27,260 --> 01:05:28,300
Yeah.

1848
01:05:28,300 --> 01:05:29,140
So you get inside.

1849
01:05:29,140 --> 01:05:32,180
So this is one of those where they wash your car for you,

1850
01:05:32,180 --> 01:05:36,780
but the entire interior is full of signs for bands.

1851
01:05:36,780 --> 01:05:38,220
Yes.

1852
01:05:38,220 --> 01:05:40,380
So it's like, it'll both be like a big, you know,

1853
01:05:40,380 --> 01:05:42,700
like just a picture of the Rolling Stones.

1854
01:05:42,700 --> 01:05:44,380
But then I liked the like,

1855
01:05:44,380 --> 01:05:47,660
the specific signed poster for the birthday massacre

1856
01:05:47,660 --> 01:05:50,300
or the band infected rain.

1857
01:05:50,300 --> 01:05:51,780
What's the birthday massacre?

1858
01:05:51,780 --> 01:05:53,220
I don't know any of these bands.

1859
01:05:53,220 --> 01:05:55,060
And they might be South Bay specific.

1860
01:05:55,060 --> 01:05:57,620
Wait, and I'm sorry, who signed infected rain?

1861
01:05:57,620 --> 01:05:59,660
Infected rain signed their poster.

1862
01:05:59,660 --> 01:06:01,700
Infected, the rain is infected.

1863
01:06:01,700 --> 01:06:03,260
Infected with what?

1864
01:06:03,260 --> 01:06:06,740
Infected with bees wax to give your car that shine.

1865
01:06:06,820 --> 01:06:08,940
Oh, it's just like the Beatles walking across Abbey Road,

1866
01:06:08,940 --> 01:06:11,020
but then it's also just like,

1867
01:06:11,020 --> 01:06:12,380
oh, they had just,

1868
01:06:12,380 --> 01:06:15,460
they had t-shirts for sale of the Beatles and ACDC

1869
01:06:15,460 --> 01:06:17,820
in the little shop where you could buy like a drink

1870
01:06:17,820 --> 01:06:18,660
or an air fryer.

1871
01:06:18,660 --> 01:06:19,980
Whoa.

1872
01:06:19,980 --> 01:06:22,540
Infected rain is from Moldova.

1873
01:06:22,540 --> 01:06:23,940
Oh yeah.

1874
01:06:23,940 --> 01:06:25,100
Wow.

1875
01:06:25,100 --> 01:06:25,940
Wow.

1876
01:06:25,940 --> 01:06:28,580
So they're probably like a crazy metal math.

1877
01:06:28,580 --> 01:06:29,420
Yes.

1878
01:06:30,460 --> 01:06:31,300
Infected, yeah, they're on.

1879
01:06:31,300 --> 01:06:34,340
That's like the manager's cousin sent them their poster

1880
01:06:34,340 --> 01:06:35,180
and they hung it up.

1881
01:06:35,180 --> 01:06:36,500
I think the owner is into rock and roll.

1882
01:06:36,500 --> 01:06:39,220
There's this weird picture of him with this band

1883
01:06:39,220 --> 01:06:42,060
and the main guy is like a skeleton face with a Pope hat.

1884
01:06:42,060 --> 01:06:44,140
And I think this is the guy that owns the car wash.

1885
01:06:44,140 --> 01:06:44,980
Because-

1886
01:06:44,980 --> 01:06:46,380
This is like a satanic church or something.

1887
01:06:46,380 --> 01:06:47,700
That's really crazy looking.

1888
01:06:47,700 --> 01:06:49,220
The thing that was interesting, oh yeah.

1889
01:06:49,220 --> 01:06:52,340
So two more things that are very important is

1890
01:06:52,340 --> 01:06:55,900
there's this huge fat Elvis statue in the corner.

1891
01:06:55,900 --> 01:06:56,740
Okay.

1892
01:06:56,740 --> 01:06:58,060
The suffering Elvis.

1893
01:06:58,060 --> 01:07:00,620
Yeah, and there's also like the sign on it that says,

1894
01:07:00,620 --> 01:07:02,340
please respect the king for your own safety.

1895
01:07:02,340 --> 01:07:04,660
Do not climb on Elvis, thank you.

1896
01:07:05,580 --> 01:07:08,060
And then there's like one of these you could sit in.

1897
01:07:08,060 --> 01:07:09,380
Like one of those-

1898
01:07:09,380 --> 01:07:10,220
Oh wow.

1899
01:07:10,220 --> 01:07:11,060
A car seat.

1900
01:07:11,060 --> 01:07:14,140
Like the back of a car, like the back of a T-bird.

1901
01:07:14,140 --> 01:07:15,460
Yeah.

1902
01:07:15,460 --> 01:07:16,660
But it's a bench.

1903
01:07:16,660 --> 01:07:18,860
So that's what you sit, this is where you're at

1904
01:07:18,860 --> 01:07:20,620
while you wait for your car to get washed.

1905
01:07:20,620 --> 01:07:25,140
Neck with your special lady while you're waiting for us

1906
01:07:25,140 --> 01:07:27,700
to do four coats of turtle wax.

1907
01:07:28,980 --> 01:07:31,420
And it was like, everyone seemed very nice there.

1908
01:07:31,420 --> 01:07:33,740
It was like, I appreciated the Elvis statue.

1909
01:07:33,740 --> 01:07:34,900
Here's something that's really interesting though.

1910
01:07:34,900 --> 01:07:37,100
There was a framed article on the wall where I was like,

1911
01:07:37,100 --> 01:07:39,340
oh, this explains a lot.

1912
01:07:39,340 --> 01:07:41,620
It's from Car Wash Magazine.

1913
01:07:41,620 --> 01:07:44,140
And it was an article in 2014.

1914
01:07:44,140 --> 01:07:46,740
And it's called, it's California's themed car washes.

1915
01:07:46,740 --> 01:07:50,420
And it was breaking down the new trend of themed car washes

1916
01:07:50,420 --> 01:07:53,700
starting with Green Forest, which had just opened

1917
01:07:53,700 --> 01:07:55,180
and won a bunch of awards.

1918
01:07:55,180 --> 01:07:56,020
Wow.

1919
01:07:56,020 --> 01:07:59,460
So most of what's interesting about this is it's the guy

1920
01:07:59,460 --> 01:08:02,740
explaining why he opened the rock and roll car wash.

1921
01:08:02,740 --> 01:08:05,100
But sidebar, it's like, he keeps getting compared

1922
01:08:05,100 --> 01:08:07,500
to Green Forest, which is winning all the awards.

1923
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:10,140
And then at one point in the article, he's like,

1924
01:08:10,140 --> 01:08:14,420
I'm opening another one and it's gonna be, he says, wait.

1925
01:08:16,300 --> 01:08:17,820
He's like, I'm opening a future project

1926
01:08:17,820 --> 01:08:20,700
in the Rondobo beach area, like after the rock

1927
01:08:20,700 --> 01:08:22,020
and roll car wash.

1928
01:08:22,020 --> 01:08:24,460
And we will also have a popular theme there,

1929
01:08:24,460 --> 01:08:26,060
but you'll have to wait and see what the theme is

1930
01:08:26,060 --> 01:08:27,180
for that location.

1931
01:08:27,180 --> 01:08:29,700
It'll be something right out of the movies.

1932
01:08:29,700 --> 01:08:32,540
And it will also coincide with the beach and the pier vibe

1933
01:08:32,540 --> 01:08:35,060
in anticipation of a new waterfront project.

1934
01:08:35,060 --> 01:08:37,300
Even if the waterfront project is held up,

1935
01:08:37,300 --> 01:08:38,900
our theme will still work well.

1936
01:08:38,900 --> 01:08:39,980
This never was built.

1937
01:08:39,980 --> 01:08:42,060
Like this stuff never happened.

1938
01:08:42,060 --> 01:08:42,900
What does it mean?

1939
01:08:42,900 --> 01:08:43,740
What do you think that is?

1940
01:08:43,740 --> 01:08:44,580
I don't know.

1941
01:08:44,580 --> 01:08:47,940
Is it like a net beach blanket bingo type?

1942
01:08:47,940 --> 01:08:48,980
That could be cool.

1943
01:08:48,980 --> 01:08:50,300
Straight out of the movies.

1944
01:08:50,300 --> 01:08:51,140
Yeah.

1945
01:08:51,140 --> 01:08:52,980
I think it's an avatar.

1946
01:08:52,980 --> 01:08:54,020
It's probably avatar.

1947
01:08:54,020 --> 01:08:54,860
The way of water.

1948
01:08:54,860 --> 01:08:56,460
He knew way of water was coming.

1949
01:08:57,620 --> 01:08:59,060
My buddies with James Cameron,

1950
01:08:59,100 --> 01:09:03,300
my buddies with the infected rain and also with James Cameron.

1951
01:09:03,300 --> 01:09:05,100
One thing they do say is that,

1952
01:09:07,340 --> 01:09:10,180
like this is about car crazy Angelenos

1953
01:09:10,180 --> 01:09:11,780
who demand entertainment.

1954
01:09:11,780 --> 01:09:15,060
And also they also say that,

1955
01:09:15,060 --> 01:09:15,900
That's Jay Leno.

1956
01:09:15,900 --> 01:09:19,580
That the Green Forest washes won a lot of awards

1957
01:09:19,580 --> 01:09:21,700
for conserving water.

1958
01:09:21,700 --> 01:09:22,540
Oh, interesting.

1959
01:09:22,540 --> 01:09:23,380
They're a bit more environmentally friendly

1960
01:09:23,380 --> 01:09:24,300
than other washes.

1961
01:09:24,300 --> 01:09:25,140
Okay.

1962
01:09:25,140 --> 01:09:25,980
Which is kind of nice.

1963
01:09:25,980 --> 01:09:26,820
It's a nice thing about the brand.

1964
01:09:26,820 --> 01:09:27,820
I have heard of that.

1965
01:09:27,820 --> 01:09:32,820
Like, oh, if the options are like wash your car yourself

1966
01:09:32,940 --> 01:09:36,060
in your driveway with a hose or go to car wash,

1967
01:09:36,060 --> 01:09:38,260
the car wash is more water efficient

1968
01:09:38,260 --> 01:09:41,100
than you just running a hose for 30 minutes.

1969
01:09:41,100 --> 01:09:42,260
Good to know.

1970
01:09:42,260 --> 01:09:46,420
Also Paul's boutique was playing on screens in the room.

1971
01:09:46,420 --> 01:09:47,260
Okay.

1972
01:09:47,260 --> 01:09:49,060
But also watch music videos while you wait for your car

1973
01:09:49,060 --> 01:09:49,980
while you stop by the Elvis,

1974
01:09:49,980 --> 01:09:51,140
but you don't climb on him.

1975
01:09:51,140 --> 01:09:52,820
Did you go up to the cashier and go like,

1976
01:09:52,820 --> 01:09:54,380
Hey, I saw you had a couple of T-shirts.

1977
01:09:54,380 --> 01:09:56,780
Do you have any T-shirts for this place?

1978
01:09:57,260 --> 01:09:58,100
Oh, I should have.

1979
01:09:58,100 --> 01:10:01,780
Do you have any infected rain shirts?

1980
01:10:01,780 --> 01:10:02,660
Or infected rain.

1981
01:10:02,660 --> 01:10:04,140
I'll take either.

1982
01:10:04,140 --> 01:10:05,820
I just went, another thing that was just interesting

1983
01:10:05,820 --> 01:10:08,820
was there are posters all over for this movie called Butter.

1984
01:10:08,820 --> 01:10:12,180
So I went on the website and started reading about Butter.

1985
01:10:12,180 --> 01:10:17,020
It's a independent film came out in 2020.

1986
01:10:17,020 --> 01:10:18,740
And this is the plot summary.

1987
01:10:18,740 --> 01:10:20,900
A lonely obese boy, everyone calls Butter,

1988
01:10:20,900 --> 01:10:21,860
is about to make history.

1989
01:10:21,860 --> 01:10:23,900
He's going to eat himself to death, live on the internet.

1990
01:10:23,900 --> 01:10:25,540
And everyone is invited to watch.

1991
01:10:26,380 --> 01:10:27,220
Oh my God.

1992
01:10:27,220 --> 01:10:28,060
What?

1993
01:10:28,060 --> 01:10:29,340
Christ.

1994
01:10:29,340 --> 01:10:30,180
Butter, no.

1995
01:10:31,540 --> 01:10:33,380
So much more to live for.

1996
01:10:33,380 --> 01:10:35,980
You can eat a lot, but not to death, Butter.

1997
01:10:35,980 --> 01:10:38,660
I almost went as far as to like watch all of Butter,

1998
01:10:38,660 --> 01:10:40,060
but I just watched the trailer.

1999
01:10:40,060 --> 01:10:44,140
This is unrelated to the 2011 movie Butter.

2000
01:10:44,140 --> 01:10:44,980
With a carving Butter.

2001
01:10:44,980 --> 01:10:45,820
Yeah, with a carving Butter.

2002
01:10:45,820 --> 01:10:47,580
No, this is about a boy named Butter.

2003
01:10:47,580 --> 01:10:49,340
When he first makes the announcement online

2004
01:10:49,340 --> 01:10:51,220
to his classmates, Butter expects pity, insults,

2005
01:10:51,220 --> 01:10:52,700
and possibly sheer indifference.

2006
01:10:52,700 --> 01:10:54,660
When he gets our morbid cheerleaders

2007
01:10:54,660 --> 01:10:57,060
rallying around his deadly plan,

2008
01:10:57,060 --> 01:10:58,500
yet as their dark encouragement grows,

2009
01:10:58,500 --> 01:11:01,380
it begins to feel a lot like popularity and that feels good.

2010
01:11:01,380 --> 01:11:03,660
But what happens when Butter reaches his suicide deadline?

2011
01:11:03,660 --> 01:11:04,620
Can he live with the fallout

2012
01:11:04,620 --> 01:11:05,940
if he doesn't go through with his plans?

2013
01:11:05,940 --> 01:11:07,380
And there's one thing that's important to know

2014
01:11:07,380 --> 01:11:10,620
from the trailer is that Butter plays jazz saxophone

2015
01:11:10,620 --> 01:11:11,740
very well.

2016
01:11:11,740 --> 01:11:14,820
And that's something he gets a lot of attention for.

2017
01:11:14,820 --> 01:11:16,380
Also his mom is. Maybe it's a salvation.

2018
01:11:16,380 --> 01:11:17,220
Mirosirvino.

2019
01:11:17,220 --> 01:11:19,940
Mirosirvino, wow.

2020
01:11:19,940 --> 01:11:21,700
Geez, wait, Oscar winner, right?

2021
01:11:21,700 --> 01:11:23,660
Oscar winner, Mirosirvino.

2022
01:11:23,660 --> 01:11:28,660
This movie, it sounds like a male insensitive precious.

2023
01:11:28,700 --> 01:11:29,700
Yes.

2024
01:11:29,700 --> 01:11:30,540
Also.

2025
01:11:30,540 --> 01:11:31,500
Weird name of a character,

2026
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:35,260
except it's really odd and abrasive and mean.

2027
01:11:35,260 --> 01:11:38,180
I read a, sorry guys, skip ahead

2028
01:11:38,180 --> 01:11:39,820
if you don't want to know what happens at the end of Butter.

2029
01:11:39,820 --> 01:11:42,060
Cause I was reading all the user reviews on IMDB

2030
01:11:42,060 --> 01:11:43,940
and somebody spoiled the end of Butter,

2031
01:11:43,940 --> 01:11:45,300
which is that he kills himself.

2032
01:11:45,300 --> 01:11:46,140
Oh my God.

2033
01:11:46,140 --> 01:11:47,580
Jesus Christ.

2034
01:11:47,580 --> 01:11:49,180
No.

2035
01:11:49,180 --> 01:11:50,700
Butter, no.

2036
01:11:50,700 --> 01:11:52,620
Butter.

2037
01:11:52,620 --> 01:11:54,260
Oh my God.

2038
01:11:54,260 --> 01:11:56,660
So anyway, that was my experience.

2039
01:11:56,660 --> 01:11:59,140
Because he listened to too much infected rain.

2040
01:11:59,140 --> 01:12:01,980
I have a, I'm guessing the audience,

2041
01:12:01,980 --> 01:12:04,260
I'm guessing the audience will not vote for Butter

2042
01:12:04,260 --> 01:12:07,020
in the next club three.

2043
01:12:07,020 --> 01:12:10,300
No, but we look at the results and say, no, Butter.

2044
01:12:10,300 --> 01:12:11,940
They voted for Butter.

2045
01:12:13,100 --> 01:12:14,180
No audience.

2046
01:12:14,180 --> 01:12:15,780
No audience.

2047
01:12:15,780 --> 01:12:19,220
Yeah, usually like if you find a movie poster

2048
01:12:19,220 --> 01:12:20,380
or information about a movie,

2049
01:12:20,380 --> 01:12:22,340
it's sometimes good to just like get as much

2050
01:12:23,180 --> 01:12:24,020
as you know, Scott.

2051
01:12:24,020 --> 01:12:24,860
There's something, something,

2052
01:12:24,860 --> 01:12:27,220
there's sometimes something at the end of the clue trail.

2053
01:12:27,220 --> 01:12:28,900
You have to at least try.

2054
01:12:28,900 --> 01:12:31,420
The one that's been driving me crazy for a long time

2055
01:12:31,420 --> 01:12:34,860
is that I assume we've all at some point

2056
01:12:34,860 --> 01:12:37,500
been to the nearby Burbank restaurant

2057
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:39,260
across from the Warner Brothers lot, the Smokehouse.

2058
01:12:39,260 --> 01:12:40,100
Oh yeah.

2059
01:12:40,100 --> 01:12:42,460
Old school restaurant, fun vibes in there.

2060
01:12:42,460 --> 01:12:43,300
Great vibes.

2061
01:12:43,300 --> 01:12:44,140
In the lobby.

2062
01:12:44,140 --> 01:12:46,100
I once saw Tony Baxter in that restaurant

2063
01:12:46,100 --> 01:12:47,940
actually before we got to meet him.

2064
01:12:48,860 --> 01:12:52,860
And it's, yeah, old school, you know, wood paneling.

2065
01:12:52,860 --> 01:12:56,500
And then there's been a poster there for so long now

2066
01:12:56,500 --> 01:12:59,460
for what seems to be a short film filmed at the Smokehouse

2067
01:12:59,460 --> 01:13:01,740
called Martinis at the Smokehouse.

2068
01:13:01,740 --> 01:13:04,020
And I cannot figure out how to,

2069
01:13:04,020 --> 01:13:06,140
it's one of those like, it was in festivals

2070
01:13:06,140 --> 01:13:08,740
and I'm like, what do you mean it's only in festivals

2071
01:13:08,740 --> 01:13:10,340
and you don't just put it on a Vimeo later.

2072
01:13:10,340 --> 01:13:13,100
I'm dying to see Martinis at the Smokehouse.

2073
01:13:13,100 --> 01:13:16,580
From what I can tell, it's like two lonely guys

2074
01:13:16,580 --> 01:13:18,820
that are like closing down the Smokehouse

2075
01:13:18,820 --> 01:13:21,540
and then there's through some magic,

2076
01:13:21,540 --> 01:13:24,140
they go back in time and they're there in the 50s.

2077
01:13:24,140 --> 01:13:27,140
Oh, when it's like cool and like, yeah.

2078
01:13:27,140 --> 01:13:28,500
When men was men.

2079
01:13:28,500 --> 01:13:29,340
Men was men.

2080
01:13:29,340 --> 01:13:30,180
Sinatra.

2081
01:13:31,900 --> 01:13:33,900
Listeners, if you have any connection

2082
01:13:33,900 --> 01:13:36,180
to Martinis at the Smokehouse, please.

2083
01:13:36,180 --> 01:13:38,940
It's like Burbank, midnight in Burbank.

2084
01:13:38,940 --> 01:13:39,780
What's midnight in Burbank?

2085
01:13:39,780 --> 01:13:41,380
Like midnight in Paris.

2086
01:13:41,380 --> 01:13:43,940
Oh yeah, I guess so, yeah.

2087
01:13:43,940 --> 01:13:45,700
We thought of it before, Woody.

2088
01:13:47,180 --> 01:13:49,500
You know, it's okay though, he's a good guy.

2089
01:13:49,500 --> 01:13:51,780
I'll let it slide, he's Woody.

2090
01:13:51,780 --> 01:13:53,740
Sorry, the trailer's available.

2091
01:13:53,740 --> 01:13:55,820
I think you saw the trailer, yeah.

2092
01:13:55,820 --> 01:13:58,380
But I look, if you watch it, you will only be,

2093
01:13:58,380 --> 01:14:00,780
you'll be just thirsting for more,

2094
01:14:00,780 --> 01:14:02,140
like a delicious martini.

2095
01:14:02,140 --> 01:14:06,540
Can I, so the butter carving movie with Ty Burrell.

2096
01:14:06,540 --> 01:14:07,980
Feel free to suggest, listeners,

2097
01:14:07,980 --> 01:14:09,460
if you're gonna give us the votes,

2098
01:14:09,460 --> 01:14:11,100
either to specify the year,

2099
01:14:11,100 --> 01:14:13,700
because if you want us to watch the butter carving movie

2100
01:14:13,700 --> 01:14:14,540
with Ty Burrell, we will.

2101
01:14:14,540 --> 01:14:16,060
It won the blacklist, I mean, it was like,

2102
01:14:16,060 --> 01:14:17,660
the government liked that script.

2103
01:14:17,660 --> 01:14:18,500
Yeah, yeah, people liked it,

2104
01:14:18,500 --> 01:14:20,580
there's a bunch of people in it.

2105
01:14:21,700 --> 01:14:24,060
The budget was 10.8 million.

2106
01:14:24,060 --> 01:14:27,020
Does anyone wanna guess what the box office was?

2107
01:14:27,940 --> 01:14:29,460
500,000.

2108
01:14:30,540 --> 01:14:31,740
Mike, any guess?

2109
01:14:31,740 --> 01:14:33,380
70,000.

2110
01:14:33,380 --> 01:14:36,260
175,706 dollars.

2111
01:14:36,260 --> 01:14:37,780
Whoa.

2112
01:14:37,780 --> 01:14:38,620
Yikes.

2113
01:14:38,620 --> 01:14:39,460
Mike cleans that up.

2114
01:14:39,460 --> 01:14:41,660
Oh no, what happened to butter?

2115
01:14:41,660 --> 01:14:46,420
So kind of a hard hit for the producing company,

2116
01:14:46,420 --> 01:14:48,540
the Weinstein company.

2117
01:14:48,540 --> 01:14:49,380
Okay.

2118
01:14:49,380 --> 01:14:50,460
Oh.

2119
01:14:50,460 --> 01:14:52,940
We tried to get the Weinstein's to produce martinis

2120
01:14:52,940 --> 01:14:54,380
in the smokehouse, they didn't do it,

2121
01:14:54,380 --> 01:14:55,220
but they're good guys,

2122
01:14:55,220 --> 01:14:57,420
it was nice to grab a drink with them.

2123
01:14:57,420 --> 01:15:00,340
We went back in time and got Robert Evans to produce it.

2124
01:15:00,340 --> 01:15:01,180
Oh.

2125
01:15:01,180 --> 01:15:02,020
Oh.

2126
01:15:03,420 --> 01:15:06,540
Kid Robert Evans, teen Robert Evans.

2127
01:15:08,780 --> 01:15:10,700
Okay, so that's the end of my journey.

2128
01:15:10,700 --> 01:15:13,900
Geez, I mean, so you got exposed to a lot

2129
01:15:13,900 --> 01:15:16,420
of the great pop culture the last 70 years.

2130
01:15:16,420 --> 01:15:18,140
Yes.

2131
01:15:18,140 --> 01:15:19,980
How do you rank it as a themed experience?

2132
01:15:19,980 --> 01:15:22,140
I mean, it'd have to be like a walkthrough experience,

2133
01:15:24,540 --> 01:15:26,700
or something like the mystery house,

2134
01:15:26,700 --> 01:15:28,220
I would put it with the mystery house

2135
01:15:28,220 --> 01:15:29,980
maybe at Knott's or something,

2136
01:15:29,980 --> 01:15:31,620
something you walk through.

2137
01:15:31,620 --> 01:15:32,620
I guess you had to show,

2138
01:15:32,620 --> 01:15:35,220
but it's like, what's something you walk through?

2139
01:15:35,220 --> 01:15:36,060
Yeah, yeah, because it wasn't a ride.

2140
01:15:36,060 --> 01:15:39,140
Like a walkthrough fun house at a county fair, maybe.

2141
01:15:39,140 --> 01:15:39,980
Yeah.

2142
01:15:39,980 --> 01:15:40,820
Sure, sure.

2143
01:15:40,820 --> 01:15:42,620
And then for Butter, I would compare Butter

2144
01:15:42,620 --> 01:15:45,260
to the, what is that, Martin Short movie

2145
01:15:45,260 --> 01:15:46,740
where his parents have sex.

2146
01:15:47,620 --> 01:15:48,460
Oh, Making of Me?

2147
01:15:48,460 --> 01:15:50,100
Making of Me, yeah.

2148
01:15:50,100 --> 01:15:52,060
Put those up next to each other probably.

2149
01:15:52,060 --> 01:15:52,900
Equally horrible.

2150
01:15:52,900 --> 01:15:56,180
The Butter trailer and the Making of Me are the same.

2151
01:15:56,180 --> 01:15:57,020
But I had a great time.

2152
01:15:57,020 --> 01:15:59,620
I spaced out my car, watched this guy's by a few weeks,

2153
01:15:59,620 --> 01:16:01,820
my car got dirty again, I'm not a monster.

2154
01:16:01,820 --> 01:16:05,340
Okay, was that, did either one do a better job?

2155
01:16:05,340 --> 01:16:07,380
I mean, they were both fine.

2156
01:16:07,380 --> 01:16:10,860
I think I'm with y'all, drive through car wash all the way.

2157
01:16:10,860 --> 01:16:15,420
I'm sick of having, like the manual labor

2158
01:16:15,420 --> 01:16:18,020
of making somebody wipe down my car is not necessary

2159
01:16:18,020 --> 01:16:20,340
and I like to be in control of my own schedule.

2160
01:16:20,340 --> 01:16:22,220
And I like to see the jets.

2161
01:16:22,220 --> 01:16:24,660
I like to see, I'm like, Brian, you know,

2162
01:16:24,660 --> 01:16:26,700
like here come the warm jets.

2163
01:16:26,700 --> 01:16:27,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2164
01:16:27,700 --> 01:16:29,020
I'm like that too, yeah.

2165
01:16:29,020 --> 01:16:31,060
Right when you get in there, oh cool.

2166
01:16:31,060 --> 01:16:31,900
Yeah, yeah.

2167
01:16:31,900 --> 01:16:35,900
I do, again, if you need to put the car in neutral,

2168
01:16:35,900 --> 01:16:39,500
I want a guy there to say like pull forward, pull forward.

2169
01:16:39,500 --> 01:16:40,340
Yeah.

2170
01:16:40,340 --> 01:16:41,180
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

2171
01:16:41,180 --> 01:16:43,460
I will say if you go on an off hour

2172
01:16:43,460 --> 01:16:45,380
and you close the loop and you do jungle,

2173
01:16:45,380 --> 01:16:46,620
if you're ever in that part of town,

2174
01:16:46,620 --> 01:16:49,740
they are very, there's a lot of guys in charge of jungle.

2175
01:16:49,740 --> 01:16:50,580
Oh, that's good.

2176
01:16:50,580 --> 01:16:51,400
You got some help.

2177
01:16:51,400 --> 01:16:52,240
It's well-manned.

2178
01:16:52,240 --> 01:16:56,500
A lot of the green forest ones had good,

2179
01:16:56,500 --> 01:16:59,180
of like very helpful, attentive work, you know.

2180
01:16:59,180 --> 01:17:00,740
I think it's a good brand.

2181
01:17:00,740 --> 01:17:01,580
Yeah, I think so.

2182
01:17:01,580 --> 01:17:02,620
I recommend it besides the-

2183
01:17:02,620 --> 01:17:06,180
I'm sad they dumped San Pedro to make it a fake volcano.

2184
01:17:06,180 --> 01:17:07,020
That's a real bummer.

2185
01:17:07,020 --> 01:17:09,100
Don't go, don't, listeners don't drive all the way

2186
01:17:09,100 --> 01:17:11,940
to San Pedro from like another state you live in.

2187
01:17:11,940 --> 01:17:14,180
But you drive to Hawthorne.

2188
01:17:14,180 --> 01:17:16,060
People are already on the way when they heard.

2189
01:17:16,060 --> 01:17:18,860
The last one is there might be one,

2190
01:17:18,860 --> 01:17:21,020
there's one on Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard,

2191
01:17:21,020 --> 01:17:23,260
which also looks to be a dinos.

2192
01:17:23,260 --> 01:17:25,700
And I think there's a dinos in Vegas.

2193
01:17:25,700 --> 01:17:26,540
Oh, wow.

2194
01:17:26,540 --> 01:17:29,900
So next Vegas trip, Nick and Chris does a third show.

2195
01:17:30,740 --> 01:17:31,580
Yeah.

2196
01:17:31,580 --> 01:17:34,100
You'll get your rental car washed.

2197
01:17:34,100 --> 01:17:34,940
Yeah.

2198
01:17:34,940 --> 01:17:35,900
Hopefully it's on the way to Kaplip.

2199
01:17:35,900 --> 01:17:37,460
All right, Scott.

2200
01:17:37,460 --> 01:17:39,300
Well, yeah, before I get to mine,

2201
01:17:39,300 --> 01:17:42,140
because I was trying to, we were discussing these

2202
01:17:42,140 --> 01:17:43,940
in general throughout the country,

2203
01:17:43,940 --> 01:17:47,020
other interesting ones that exist.

2204
01:17:47,020 --> 01:17:50,540
And there's also, I noticed another dinosaur one

2205
01:17:50,540 --> 01:17:54,100
that's in Austin, Texas, the Jurassic car wash.

2206
01:17:54,100 --> 01:17:57,260
And that one has spitting dinosaurs apparently.

2207
01:17:57,260 --> 01:17:58,100
Whoa.

2208
01:17:58,100 --> 01:17:59,540
I don't know if that's like for kids to play with.

2209
01:18:00,060 --> 01:18:02,860
Or if it's in the actual, in the car wash.

2210
01:18:02,860 --> 01:18:04,820
Cause that's what I'm looking for is like,

2211
01:18:04,820 --> 01:18:07,180
can somebody make the car wash itself?

2212
01:18:07,180 --> 01:18:08,020
Integrate.

2213
01:18:08,020 --> 01:18:09,780
I think that's hard though.

2214
01:18:09,780 --> 01:18:10,620
It's tough.

2215
01:18:10,620 --> 01:18:13,620
Yeah, I only, I had one idea of how you could do it,

2216
01:18:13,620 --> 01:18:17,060
which is that if the whole thing is like a Godzilla

2217
01:18:17,060 --> 01:18:20,140
Gamera type monster and you drive in through his mouth,

2218
01:18:20,140 --> 01:18:22,300
and then it's like you're being digested

2219
01:18:22,300 --> 01:18:25,380
and maybe you paint everything kind of red and fleshy.

2220
01:18:25,380 --> 01:18:29,420
So like everything you're going through are like his organs

2221
01:18:29,420 --> 01:18:31,860
and you're being swallowed.

2222
01:18:31,860 --> 01:18:35,260
Ooh, what about like a monstro?

2223
01:18:35,260 --> 01:18:36,340
Oh, that would work.

2224
01:18:36,340 --> 01:18:38,420
Well, and it's, yeah, it's water oriented.

2225
01:18:38,420 --> 01:18:40,380
And if they can make you feel like the end is you getting

2226
01:18:40,380 --> 01:18:43,540
spit up into the air out of the blowhole.

2227
01:18:43,540 --> 01:18:44,820
You could make it biblical too.

2228
01:18:44,820 --> 01:18:46,780
It could be, you could do it in like, you know,

2229
01:18:46,780 --> 01:18:48,700
the Heartland and have it be Jonah.

2230
01:18:48,700 --> 01:18:50,740
And you get swallowed by a whale.

2231
01:18:50,740 --> 01:18:53,820
Or Moby Dick, make it like, you know, East coast

2232
01:18:54,740 --> 01:18:56,700
and do Moby Dick.

2233
01:18:56,700 --> 01:18:57,980
Just anything whale related.

2234
01:18:57,980 --> 01:19:00,340
I just really missed having that squid.

2235
01:19:00,340 --> 01:19:01,420
Yeah, yeah.

2236
01:19:01,420 --> 01:19:03,140
That is a bummer.

2237
01:19:03,140 --> 01:19:05,780
What is the point possibly in replacing that?

2238
01:19:05,780 --> 01:19:06,620
Why did they have to do it?

2239
01:19:06,620 --> 01:19:07,440
Just paint it red.

2240
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:08,280
What the fuck are you doing?

2241
01:19:08,280 --> 01:19:09,460
It's still a squid.

2242
01:19:09,460 --> 01:19:11,300
Yeah, now he has a half a squid.

2243
01:19:13,540 --> 01:19:18,060
I also discovered the phenomenon of haunted car washes,

2244
01:19:18,060 --> 01:19:22,740
of car wash haunts, which I imagine that Mike would love.

2245
01:19:22,740 --> 01:19:23,580
I hope so.

2246
01:19:23,580 --> 01:19:24,420
And these might happen around here.

2247
01:19:24,420 --> 01:19:27,300
I found one in Anaheim.

2248
01:19:27,300 --> 01:19:28,700
So be on the lookout.

2249
01:19:28,700 --> 01:19:31,180
This could, because maybe we could maybe return to this

2250
01:19:31,180 --> 01:19:32,900
in Haunt Cast the Fright season.

2251
01:19:32,900 --> 01:19:35,300
Is that a year round haunt?

2252
01:19:35,300 --> 01:19:38,100
No, I think there's a lot of,

2253
01:19:38,100 --> 01:19:41,460
these might be anywhere near the listener

2254
01:19:41,460 --> 01:19:42,540
throughout the country.

2255
01:19:42,540 --> 01:19:46,260
And it's not necessarily otherwise in theme,

2256
01:19:46,260 --> 01:19:47,740
in otherwise themed car washes.

2257
01:19:47,740 --> 01:19:50,340
Like a regular car wash might turn haunted.

2258
01:19:50,340 --> 01:19:53,140
And the video I watched of the Anaheim one

2259
01:19:53,140 --> 01:19:53,980
looks pretty good.

2260
01:19:53,980 --> 01:19:55,660
Like they get it's characters.

2261
01:19:55,660 --> 01:19:58,580
And the characters are in the wash.

2262
01:19:58,580 --> 01:19:59,420
Are they?

2263
01:19:59,420 --> 01:20:03,180
So you might pass by like kind of a scary exorcist girl

2264
01:20:03,180 --> 01:20:06,740
whose hair in the video was blowing,

2265
01:20:06,740 --> 01:20:09,420
like she was near enough to the dryers

2266
01:20:09,420 --> 01:20:12,580
that her hair is blowing creepily in the wind.

2267
01:20:12,580 --> 01:20:13,580
So this is a real,

2268
01:20:13,580 --> 01:20:15,900
this isn't just like when a miniature golf course goes,

2269
01:20:15,900 --> 01:20:17,240
this is haunted golf course.

2270
01:20:17,240 --> 01:20:19,940
And it's like, there's one skeleton hole,

2271
01:20:19,940 --> 01:20:22,300
one tiny psycho household,

2272
01:20:22,300 --> 01:20:25,340
one creature from the Black Lagoon hole, you know?

2273
01:20:25,900 --> 01:20:28,100
No, there's like fully like scary clowns

2274
01:20:28,100 --> 01:20:32,500
walk up to your car and like try to get in.

2275
01:20:32,500 --> 01:20:34,300
I saw a video of like shaking the handle,

2276
01:20:34,300 --> 01:20:35,380
like let me in.

2277
01:20:36,540 --> 01:20:37,700
You saw a video of one of those, right?

2278
01:20:37,700 --> 01:20:39,300
Yeah, yeah, we were sending them.

2279
01:20:39,300 --> 01:20:42,380
I, and like, you know, the fake chainsaws

2280
01:20:42,380 --> 01:20:44,580
that give you the jump scare.

2281
01:20:44,580 --> 01:20:45,740
I want this. So that's the whole area.

2282
01:20:45,740 --> 01:20:47,660
Yeah, I think for sure we can find

2283
01:20:47,660 --> 01:20:49,180
and listeners can find one of those.

2284
01:20:49,180 --> 01:20:52,340
But you're saying they're in the actual washing portion?

2285
01:20:52,340 --> 01:20:55,100
Like I watched videos where there were like a lot of people

2286
01:20:55,940 --> 01:20:57,780
like in every possible area.

2287
01:20:57,780 --> 01:21:00,380
They're just like adjusting the polishing chemicals?

2288
01:21:00,380 --> 01:21:02,580
I hope it's dangerous.

2289
01:21:02,580 --> 01:21:05,820
See, that was the thing with some of the drive-through haunts

2290
01:21:05,820 --> 01:21:09,300
where it's like, I would hope this one would be one

2291
01:21:09,300 --> 01:21:10,780
where you put your car in neutral.

2292
01:21:10,780 --> 01:21:11,860
Cause I was concerned,

2293
01:21:11,860 --> 01:21:14,820
I saw some of these drive-through haunts and I'm like,

2294
01:21:14,820 --> 01:21:18,620
I don't know that you want to be having the like gas

2295
01:21:18,620 --> 01:21:21,140
at your disposal, the gas pedal at your disposal

2296
01:21:21,140 --> 01:21:22,420
when you're going through these things

2297
01:21:22,420 --> 01:21:24,860
and someone starts banging on your car window.

2298
01:21:25,700 --> 01:21:26,540
You get crushed somebody,

2299
01:21:26,540 --> 01:21:28,260
you get crushed a scary clown against the side of the wall.

2300
01:21:28,260 --> 01:21:30,340
Yeah, yeah. Oh no, I crushed Jeeks.

2301
01:21:30,340 --> 01:21:32,300
I crushed Jeeks from Saul.

2302
01:21:33,340 --> 01:21:36,060
He was on his little tricycle. I didn't see him.

2303
01:21:36,060 --> 01:21:37,540
Oh man.

2304
01:21:37,540 --> 01:21:39,580
So haunted car washes for sure.

2305
01:21:39,580 --> 01:21:42,340
We got to figure out. I think that's so exciting.

2306
01:21:42,340 --> 01:21:45,660
But then my favorite one that I found out about,

2307
01:21:45,660 --> 01:21:49,100
maybe the weirdest themed car wash in the country

2308
01:21:49,100 --> 01:21:52,060
is that there is a car wash that is themed

2309
01:21:52,060 --> 01:21:55,940
after an old 19th century river boats.

2310
01:21:55,940 --> 01:21:57,780
This is a car wash. Wow.

2311
01:21:57,780 --> 01:21:59,580
Yeah. Jason, take a look at that.

2312
01:21:59,580 --> 01:22:03,380
This is, it is the Mark Twain, but you can drive.

2313
01:22:03,380 --> 01:22:06,740
The bottom floor is the car wash part.

2314
01:22:06,740 --> 01:22:07,860
Yeah.

2315
01:22:07,860 --> 01:22:11,020
And then otherwise it like it, there's a dock next to it,

2316
01:22:11,020 --> 01:22:12,860
kind of like a boardwalk.

2317
01:22:12,860 --> 01:22:16,140
And it says there's like a little like lagoon

2318
01:22:16,140 --> 01:22:19,300
and like with a, you know, with a fountain shooting up

2319
01:22:19,300 --> 01:22:20,500
and coy and all this stuff.

2320
01:22:20,500 --> 01:22:24,220
So you get to like, I like, you get to just like

2321
01:22:24,220 --> 01:22:28,500
have a little like Mississippi experience essentially.

2322
01:22:28,500 --> 01:22:30,180
Yeah. This looks fantastic.

2323
01:22:30,180 --> 01:22:31,020
That looks very fun.

2324
01:22:31,020 --> 01:22:34,780
And that, that is a different way to draw people than

2325
01:22:34,780 --> 01:22:37,820
I'm thinking there, there's a gas station in Sherman Oaks

2326
01:22:37,820 --> 01:22:40,180
and a lot of gas station I went to growing up

2327
01:22:40,180 --> 01:22:43,900
have like the biggest goddamn convenience store

2328
01:22:43,900 --> 01:22:44,740
you've ever seen.

2329
01:22:44,740 --> 01:22:47,900
Cause they just build a store, the length of the car wash.

2330
01:22:47,900 --> 01:22:50,220
And sometimes there's new windows where you can watch.

2331
01:22:50,220 --> 01:22:51,060
I was like that.

2332
01:22:51,060 --> 01:22:53,140
You watched your car go through

2333
01:22:53,140 --> 01:22:55,980
and then they need to fill those shelves.

2334
01:22:55,980 --> 01:22:59,380
So then you get the strangest assortment of like, you know,

2335
01:22:59,380 --> 01:23:01,900
mats for your car, air fresheners.

2336
01:23:01,900 --> 01:23:04,500
There's for some reason, a rack of candles.

2337
01:23:04,500 --> 01:23:06,300
There's weird like, you know,

2338
01:23:06,300 --> 01:23:07,140
Oh yeah. What other bullshit?

2339
01:23:07,140 --> 01:23:08,980
Doodads or gadgets or

2340
01:23:08,980 --> 01:23:10,180
CDs and DVDs and all that.

2341
01:23:10,180 --> 01:23:12,260
Yeah. Like fidget spinners.

2342
01:23:12,260 --> 01:23:14,180
And then just a wall of stuff to animal

2343
01:23:14,180 --> 01:23:18,940
just cause they just need stock to keep people entertained.

2344
01:23:18,940 --> 01:23:20,020
Yeah. While they sit around for

2345
01:23:20,860 --> 01:23:21,700
a while.

2346
01:23:21,700 --> 01:23:23,180
And you have to justify the length you're right.

2347
01:23:23,180 --> 01:23:24,020
Yeah.

2348
01:23:24,020 --> 01:23:26,220
This I think is like a great use of,

2349
01:23:26,220 --> 01:23:28,380
cause a river boat is long and like,

2350
01:23:28,380 --> 01:23:30,980
what a great like place to put that kind of thing.

2351
01:23:30,980 --> 01:23:33,860
So I started thinking like, okay, I was like, where is this?

2352
01:23:33,860 --> 01:23:36,420
I would be awesome to go to this.

2353
01:23:36,420 --> 01:23:38,380
And it is in California I saw,

2354
01:23:38,380 --> 01:23:40,580
but it was a town name that I didn't recognize,

2355
01:23:40,580 --> 01:23:41,900
which is Campbell.

2356
01:23:41,900 --> 01:23:43,100
Like where is Campbell?

2357
01:23:43,100 --> 01:23:44,580
Let me look up Campbell.

2358
01:23:44,580 --> 01:23:45,940
Campbell is in NorCal.

2359
01:23:45,940 --> 01:23:48,580
It's 333 miles away.

2360
01:23:48,580 --> 01:23:49,420
Okay.

2361
01:23:49,420 --> 01:23:50,340
Probably not.

2362
01:23:50,340 --> 01:23:51,780
Probably doesn't make sense to do it.

2363
01:23:51,780 --> 01:23:52,780
Probably a big asshole to do it.

2364
01:23:52,780 --> 01:23:54,500
And anyway, I went.

2365
01:23:54,500 --> 01:23:55,340
Wow.

2366
01:23:55,340 --> 01:23:56,180
Eva knew.

2367
01:23:56,180 --> 01:23:57,180
How far is it?

2368
01:23:57,180 --> 01:23:58,020
Whoa.

2369
01:23:58,020 --> 01:23:58,860
How far is it?

2370
01:23:58,860 --> 01:24:00,180
How far is it?

2371
01:24:00,180 --> 01:24:01,500
333.

2372
01:24:01,500 --> 01:24:02,340
Okay.

2373
01:24:02,340 --> 01:24:03,180
Miles away.

2374
01:24:03,180 --> 01:24:04,540
Wow.

2375
01:24:04,540 --> 01:24:06,220
So that's a long drive, right?

2376
01:24:06,220 --> 01:24:07,860
That's a crazy drive.

2377
01:24:07,860 --> 01:24:09,620
I didn't do a crazy drive.

2378
01:24:09,620 --> 01:24:11,260
Here's what I did.

2379
01:24:11,260 --> 01:24:13,620
So I mean, I was feeling you out about it all Eva.

2380
01:24:13,620 --> 01:24:15,100
Like, does this make sense?

2381
01:24:15,100 --> 01:24:16,820
But you were traveling, you're working.

2382
01:24:16,820 --> 01:24:20,700
And I brought it up to Erin.

2383
01:24:20,700 --> 01:24:24,940
Like, this is a little in my head and she got like possessed.

2384
01:24:24,940 --> 01:24:27,540
Like, I want to do this so badly.

2385
01:24:27,540 --> 01:24:32,180
For whatever reason, this just like called to her so hard.

2386
01:24:32,180 --> 01:24:36,180
And we figured out a plan and here was the plan.

2387
01:24:37,500 --> 01:24:41,140
We went from where we are right now

2388
01:24:41,140 --> 01:24:44,220
to the Burbank airport, which is 10 minutes away.

2389
01:24:44,220 --> 01:24:45,060
Yes.

2390
01:24:45,060 --> 01:24:50,060
A very cheap Southwest flight to the San Jose airport,

2391
01:24:50,100 --> 01:24:52,780
which is 10 minutes away from this.

2392
01:24:52,780 --> 01:24:55,700
The Campbell is right next to San Jose.

2393
01:24:55,700 --> 01:24:58,180
So that's pretty fast.

2394
01:24:58,180 --> 01:25:01,900
Rent a car specifically to get it washed.

2395
01:25:01,900 --> 01:25:06,900
For the only reason you're renting it.

2396
01:25:07,140 --> 01:25:07,980
Wow.

2397
01:25:09,820 --> 01:25:12,580
Return the car, fly back to Burbank,

2398
01:25:12,580 --> 01:25:16,460
and then still get home in time to put our boy down for bed.

2399
01:25:16,460 --> 01:25:17,620
This was the plan.

2400
01:25:17,620 --> 01:25:18,460
Wow.

2401
01:25:18,460 --> 01:25:19,300
This is what we hatched.

2402
01:25:19,300 --> 01:25:22,180
And this is exactly what we did last Wednesday.

2403
01:25:22,180 --> 01:25:23,220
Last Wednesday.

2404
01:25:23,220 --> 01:25:24,220
Wow.

2405
01:25:24,220 --> 01:25:26,540
Just about a week and a half ago,

2406
01:25:26,540 --> 01:25:30,900
we took a day trip to San Jose just to go to a car wash.

2407
01:25:30,900 --> 01:25:33,260
Wow. How long round trip?

2408
01:25:34,140 --> 01:25:39,140
Okay. We were, we left the house at a little after 9 a.m.

2409
01:25:39,780 --> 01:25:44,780
We had landed back in Burbank at 6.15, I believe.

2410
01:25:46,460 --> 01:25:47,820
Wow.

2411
01:25:47,820 --> 01:25:49,260
But we took our time a little bit,

2412
01:25:49,260 --> 01:25:51,820
but yeah, all like just within the window of the day.

2413
01:25:51,820 --> 01:25:53,060
Wow.

2414
01:25:53,060 --> 01:25:56,180
Tempted to stay overnight, but like, oh my God, if we don't,

2415
01:25:56,180 --> 01:25:57,820
then it's just a day trip.

2416
01:25:57,820 --> 01:25:59,420
We don't have any luggage.

2417
01:25:59,420 --> 01:26:04,340
So we breezed through security on both easy airports anyway,

2418
01:26:04,340 --> 01:26:08,300
deployed both grandmas to take care of the kiddo.

2419
01:26:08,300 --> 01:26:09,180
Thanks, grandma.

2420
01:26:09,180 --> 01:26:11,820
My next question is, what did grandmas say?

2421
01:26:11,820 --> 01:26:12,980
Yeah.

2422
01:26:12,980 --> 01:26:17,940
Cause I, I talked to, I talked to my parents like the day of

2423
01:26:17,940 --> 01:26:20,940
and the day after I went to the car wash and I was just like,

2424
01:26:20,940 --> 01:26:22,540
I was just like, you know what?

2425
01:26:22,540 --> 01:26:23,860
I don't want to open a can of words.

2426
01:26:23,860 --> 01:26:27,300
So I just went, yeah, I got a car wash yesterday.

2427
01:26:28,860 --> 01:26:30,980
Sat at the grocery store just for a couple of things,

2428
01:26:30,980 --> 01:26:31,820
you know?

2429
01:26:31,820 --> 01:26:33,900
Right. I had no way to, I mean, look,

2430
01:26:33,900 --> 01:26:37,740
they're used to at this point to just kind of a grinning

2431
01:26:37,740 --> 01:26:40,220
and bearing it on what are they up to?

2432
01:26:40,220 --> 01:26:41,220
I don't, okay.

2433
01:26:41,220 --> 01:26:43,740
Hey, if it gets this time with the kiddo,

2434
01:26:43,740 --> 01:26:44,780
then we're happy.

2435
01:26:46,020 --> 01:26:47,500
So Erin's mom might be listening.

2436
01:26:47,500 --> 01:26:48,660
Thanks so much for helping us.

2437
01:26:48,660 --> 01:26:50,940
Right. Erin's mom will listen so she knows.

2438
01:26:50,940 --> 01:26:51,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2439
01:26:51,780 --> 01:26:52,620
That we're out of our minds.

2440
01:26:52,620 --> 01:26:53,620
Made our dreams come true.

2441
01:26:53,620 --> 01:26:54,700
Made Erin's dream come true.

2442
01:26:54,700 --> 01:26:55,540
Yeah.

2443
01:26:56,940 --> 01:26:59,460
Looks like a charming town, Campbell, California.

2444
01:26:59,460 --> 01:27:03,700
Well, let me tell you, I, my report is glowing.

2445
01:27:03,700 --> 01:27:04,780
I don't want to spoil it,

2446
01:27:04,780 --> 01:27:07,780
but there is no turn where this becomes bad news.

2447
01:27:07,780 --> 01:27:09,260
Oh wow. We made a mistake.

2448
01:27:09,260 --> 01:27:10,660
That was in our heads is like,

2449
01:27:10,660 --> 01:27:13,980
oh, but if we tempt fate here and then we don't return,

2450
01:27:13,980 --> 01:27:16,620
would that not be the worst thing that could happen?

2451
01:27:16,620 --> 01:27:19,460
That was my, my mom's reaction was just like,

2452
01:27:19,460 --> 01:27:22,020
okay, well tell me where the first aid kit is

2453
01:27:22,020 --> 01:27:25,300
in case you're, in case you get delayed for a while.

2454
01:27:25,300 --> 01:27:26,380
Yeah. Uh huh.

2455
01:27:26,380 --> 01:27:28,900
Oh, they have a water tower.

2456
01:27:28,900 --> 01:27:29,740
In Campbell?

2457
01:27:29,740 --> 01:27:31,060
Yeah, they have like a Warner Brothers lot.

2458
01:27:31,060 --> 01:27:32,700
They passed by the Campbell water tower.

2459
01:27:32,700 --> 01:27:33,980
I mean, I loved Campbell.

2460
01:27:33,980 --> 01:27:38,980
Okay. So, uh, lightest security lines and flights ever.

2461
01:27:39,300 --> 01:27:41,540
We were, went from inside our house

2462
01:27:41,540 --> 01:27:45,420
to inside a San Jose rental car in two, two hours,

2463
01:27:45,420 --> 01:27:46,260
10 minutes.

2464
01:27:46,260 --> 01:27:47,080
Wow.

2465
01:27:47,080 --> 01:27:48,300
So efficient.

2466
01:27:48,300 --> 01:27:50,380
When you're not even worried, when you got no luggage

2467
01:27:50,380 --> 01:27:52,060
and you're not, there's nothing to do on the other end

2468
01:27:52,060 --> 01:27:53,060
that you're stressed about.

2469
01:27:53,060 --> 01:27:54,860
It was, this is maybe the first time ever in my life.

2470
01:27:54,860 --> 01:27:56,940
I felt like I'm taking a flight.

2471
01:27:56,940 --> 01:27:59,340
Like when do you ever enjoy being on a plane?

2472
01:27:59,340 --> 01:28:03,380
But this felt like, wow, we're in the sky.

2473
01:28:03,460 --> 01:28:05,820
It's only a short, like Burbank, if you could do it

2474
01:28:05,820 --> 01:28:07,220
like to Vegas or something,

2475
01:28:07,220 --> 01:28:09,500
and if you're only there for a day or two,

2476
01:28:09,500 --> 01:28:13,340
that breezy feeling, which is rare at an airport of like.

2477
01:28:13,340 --> 01:28:15,620
Similar length to Las Vegas, where you have that,

2478
01:28:15,620 --> 01:28:18,020
where they have to get the beverage service out.

2479
01:28:18,020 --> 01:28:18,860
It's so fast.

2480
01:28:18,860 --> 01:28:20,060
But then it happens when you're like,

2481
01:28:20,060 --> 01:28:21,180
wait any time, if you're on a plane

2482
01:28:21,180 --> 01:28:23,180
and they say we're beginning our descent

2483
01:28:23,180 --> 01:28:25,780
and you laugh at how early you're starting the descent.

2484
01:28:25,780 --> 01:28:28,300
Yeah, you have not finished an episode

2485
01:28:28,300 --> 01:28:30,220
of the West Wing or whatever.

2486
01:28:30,220 --> 01:28:31,540
Whatever's on demand.

2487
01:28:31,540 --> 01:28:36,180
The Vegas experience is really fun to go fly to Vegas.

2488
01:28:37,220 --> 01:28:38,980
You get into the Vegas airport

2489
01:28:38,980 --> 01:28:41,100
and if you stay like South Strip,

2490
01:28:41,100 --> 01:28:43,460
you're like, I was in my house 90 minutes ago

2491
01:28:43,460 --> 01:28:46,900
and now I'm 10 stories up in a hotel room in Vegas.

2492
01:28:46,900 --> 01:28:47,740
Oh yeah.

2493
01:28:47,740 --> 01:28:48,580
It's wild.

2494
01:28:48,580 --> 01:28:50,660
I took my Italy leftovers last time.

2495
01:28:50,660 --> 01:28:51,500
Yes.

2496
01:28:51,500 --> 01:28:52,340
Less than two hours.

2497
01:28:52,340 --> 01:28:53,940
Walked them back home, put them in the fridge.

2498
01:28:53,940 --> 01:28:55,220
Yeah.

2499
01:28:55,220 --> 01:28:59,500
Okay, so we get to the rental car.

2500
01:28:59,500 --> 01:29:02,980
When we find the rental car, it is sopping wet.

2501
01:29:02,980 --> 01:29:07,020
It has just been washed five minutes prior

2502
01:29:07,020 --> 01:29:10,900
and now we are just taking it straight into another car wash.

2503
01:29:10,900 --> 01:29:13,620
Was there a discussion of dirtying it up?

2504
01:29:13,620 --> 01:29:14,620
Throw mud at it?

2505
01:29:14,620 --> 01:29:16,700
We don't know the area well enough to know where,

2506
01:29:16,700 --> 01:29:18,380
we don't know where to like, you know,

2507
01:29:18,380 --> 01:29:19,460
we don't know where to go drag this.

2508
01:29:19,460 --> 01:29:20,300
Where the?

2509
01:29:20,300 --> 01:29:22,540
This isn't like John Ford's car.

2510
01:29:22,540 --> 01:29:23,660
We don't know the lay of the land.

2511
01:29:23,660 --> 01:29:26,820
Excuse me, sir, where are our big piles of soot?

2512
01:29:26,820 --> 01:29:28,460
We need to dirty this car up.

2513
01:29:28,460 --> 01:29:30,540
Big farm around these parts.

2514
01:29:30,540 --> 01:29:32,980
You each constructed a Chipotle burrito ball,

2515
01:29:32,980 --> 01:29:36,300
walked in the parking lot, just nailed the car.

2516
01:29:36,300 --> 01:29:37,740
Take that.

2517
01:29:37,740 --> 01:29:40,140
We have to, to justify the cleaning.

2518
01:29:41,460 --> 01:29:43,300
It's a great breezy drive.

2519
01:29:43,300 --> 01:29:44,500
It's only 10 minutes away.

2520
01:29:44,500 --> 01:29:45,980
We get off at the exit.

2521
01:29:45,980 --> 01:29:48,500
What is the exit facing?

2522
01:29:48,500 --> 01:29:53,500
But it's like direct line of sight into the parking lot

2523
01:29:53,660 --> 01:29:55,380
of a former Fry's electronics.

2524
01:29:55,380 --> 01:29:56,220
Oh wow.

2525
01:29:56,220 --> 01:29:58,060
Right there, same exit as the car wash.

2526
01:29:58,900 --> 01:30:00,700
Do you know what was the theme of that one?

2527
01:30:00,700 --> 01:30:02,740
It was Egyptian, I believe.

2528
01:30:02,740 --> 01:30:07,380
So it was kind of tan, not a pyramid, but very, you know,

2529
01:30:07,380 --> 01:30:10,500
tan and tall, big austere ramps.

2530
01:30:10,500 --> 01:30:14,140
So now much like a hundred years ago or so,

2531
01:30:14,140 --> 01:30:16,380
it is just like the pyramids.

2532
01:30:16,380 --> 01:30:18,060
It's just an unopened tomb.

2533
01:30:18,060 --> 01:30:19,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2534
01:30:19,740 --> 01:30:21,260
Except I care about them.

2535
01:30:21,260 --> 01:30:23,500
But Chip is blessed your journey.

2536
01:30:23,500 --> 01:30:24,580
Yes, yeah, yeah.

2537
01:30:24,580 --> 01:30:28,140
Knowing that Chip was, I was in the footsteps of Chip.

2538
01:30:28,140 --> 01:30:29,140
Yeah.

2539
01:30:29,140 --> 01:30:33,300
Or Charlie. Charlie, you went from Charlie to Charlie.

2540
01:30:33,300 --> 01:30:34,540
Like airport to airport.

2541
01:30:34,540 --> 01:30:36,180
Cause you- Oh yeah, cause we're right, yes.

2542
01:30:36,180 --> 01:30:38,420
The Burbank airport right next to the former FIAS

2543
01:30:38,420 --> 01:30:42,140
where I've been, where I got Charlie to bring home.

2544
01:30:43,180 --> 01:30:44,980
So anyway, I didn't say the name.

2545
01:30:44,980 --> 01:30:47,260
This is the Delta Queen car wash.

2546
01:30:47,260 --> 01:30:48,100
That's the name of the ship.

2547
01:30:48,100 --> 01:30:50,980
But I think now it just goes by classic car wash.

2548
01:30:50,980 --> 01:30:53,100
Jaw dropped as we pulled up to it.

2549
01:30:53,100 --> 01:30:55,340
It is legit great looking.

2550
01:30:55,340 --> 01:30:57,300
It is not run down.

2551
01:30:57,300 --> 01:30:58,660
The place is packed.

2552
01:30:58,660 --> 01:31:01,540
There's so many people doing just the exterior wash

2553
01:31:01,540 --> 01:31:02,700
where you just drive through,

2554
01:31:02,700 --> 01:31:05,820
but so many people waiting for the full deal as well.

2555
01:31:05,820 --> 01:31:08,700
It is hopping, but not a lot of line

2556
01:31:08,700 --> 01:31:09,820
for just the exterior wash.

2557
01:31:09,820 --> 01:31:11,860
So we drove right in and you drive past

2558
01:31:11,860 --> 01:31:14,820
like a little ship wreck and all of the-

2559
01:31:14,820 --> 01:31:19,180
Wow. It's like very main street style lanterns

2560
01:31:19,180 --> 01:31:21,900
and American flags everywhere.

2561
01:31:21,900 --> 01:31:25,380
And you pass by like a cutout of a sea captain

2562
01:31:25,380 --> 01:31:28,300
in a yellow slicker who just like caught a big one.

2563
01:31:28,300 --> 01:31:30,580
And he's also holding the sign that says,

2564
01:31:30,580 --> 01:31:31,980
put your antenna down.

2565
01:31:31,980 --> 01:31:33,020
Oh wow.

2566
01:31:33,020 --> 01:31:36,500
It's very, the whole campus kind of is like,

2567
01:31:36,500 --> 01:31:38,060
it's so Knott's Berry farm.

2568
01:31:38,060 --> 01:31:43,060
It's really charming wooden hand carved signs

2569
01:31:43,460 --> 01:31:48,020
and like 1900s Americana by way of 1960s.

2570
01:31:48,020 --> 01:31:49,620
I think that's when it was built.

2571
01:31:49,620 --> 01:31:54,220
So just aesthetically love it, love the place.

2572
01:31:54,220 --> 01:31:56,380
The wash itself, look, you just drive through.

2573
01:31:56,380 --> 01:32:00,700
There is no, you're not, there's no like bells

2574
01:32:00,700 --> 01:32:03,100
and there's no like ragtime music.

2575
01:32:03,100 --> 01:32:07,580
I wouldn't note that if there is a way to jazz up that,

2576
01:32:07,580 --> 01:32:11,780
literally jazz up that part of the experience, I'd be happy.

2577
01:32:11,780 --> 01:32:12,620
But who cares?

2578
01:32:12,620 --> 01:32:13,460
You're in an old state,

2579
01:32:13,460 --> 01:32:16,540
the moment where you're driving onto the riverboat

2580
01:32:16,540 --> 01:32:17,940
is so exciting.

2581
01:32:17,940 --> 01:32:19,140
Wow. Is it in the interior?

2582
01:32:19,660 --> 01:32:20,900
I mean, does the interior seem like,

2583
01:32:20,900 --> 01:32:22,980
I know it's hard to see because of the suds,

2584
01:32:22,980 --> 01:32:26,740
but is the interior at all different than just the normal?

2585
01:32:26,740 --> 01:32:27,940
Like, could you see the walls?

2586
01:32:27,940 --> 01:32:30,780
Does it look a little bit more like a riverboat or anything?

2587
01:32:30,780 --> 01:32:32,020
Or does it just, when you were in there,

2588
01:32:32,020 --> 01:32:34,740
would you mistake it for a different car wash?

2589
01:32:34,740 --> 01:32:36,700
No, it was completely average.

2590
01:32:36,700 --> 01:32:39,900
So I guess I have to give it minus points for that.

2591
01:32:39,900 --> 01:32:43,460
But I still, I don't have it in me to give any minus point

2592
01:32:43,460 --> 01:32:44,900
to this delightful experience

2593
01:32:44,900 --> 01:32:47,140
because everything on the outside was so great.

2594
01:32:47,140 --> 01:32:48,660
So we went and did the car wash

2595
01:32:48,660 --> 01:32:50,340
and that was nothing to speak of,

2596
01:32:50,340 --> 01:32:52,460
but felt fun to wash the rental car.

2597
01:32:52,460 --> 01:32:54,780
And then we parked it down the street,

2598
01:32:54,780 --> 01:32:56,940
walked past what used to be a Hooters.

2599
01:32:56,940 --> 01:32:58,580
That was one of the things that really pulled me in too,

2600
01:32:58,580 --> 01:33:01,060
was like, and there's a Hooters next door,

2601
01:33:01,060 --> 01:33:02,980
but not anymore, unfortunately.

2602
01:33:02,980 --> 01:33:04,380
But not a riverboat Hooters?

2603
01:33:04,380 --> 01:33:06,100
No, no, no, no, just regular Hooters.

2604
01:33:06,100 --> 01:33:07,380
Okay.

2605
01:33:07,380 --> 01:33:09,580
With the bright orange of Hooters,

2606
01:33:09,580 --> 01:33:13,540
like in the same periphery as the brown of the riverboat,

2607
01:33:13,540 --> 01:33:15,260
would have been great to see, but no.

2608
01:33:15,260 --> 01:33:16,100
That's too bad.

2609
01:33:16,100 --> 01:33:16,940
But there's so much stuff.

2610
01:33:16,940 --> 01:33:19,740
There's a little mini-mart that sells coffee and hot dogs,

2611
01:33:19,740 --> 01:33:22,140
like on the little spinners.

2612
01:33:22,140 --> 01:33:25,900
In general, Jason, this is just, this is so up your alley.

2613
01:33:25,900 --> 01:33:28,220
Time to uproot your whole life and move.

2614
01:33:28,220 --> 01:33:29,180
To Campbell.

2615
01:33:29,180 --> 01:33:31,060
On to the ship to get a little room

2616
01:33:31,060 --> 01:33:31,900
at the top of the ship.

2617
01:33:31,900 --> 01:33:32,860
Oh, you could captain it.

2618
01:33:32,860 --> 01:33:34,700
Do you get a certificate for driving the ship,

2619
01:33:34,700 --> 01:33:36,580
like the Mark Twain?

2620
01:33:36,580 --> 01:33:37,420
I don't know that.

2621
01:33:37,420 --> 01:33:40,940
And if visitors cannot go up onto the top levels,

2622
01:33:40,940 --> 01:33:41,980
which is also disappointing,

2623
01:33:41,980 --> 01:33:44,820
but I really liked seeing that the manager's office

2624
01:33:44,820 --> 01:33:46,180
is where the captain would be.

2625
01:33:46,220 --> 01:33:47,060
Oh, it is.

2626
01:33:47,060 --> 01:33:47,900
Oh, wow.

2627
01:33:47,900 --> 01:33:49,220
The manager.

2628
01:33:49,220 --> 01:33:51,780
And I think that, like, I don't think it's all the employees,

2629
01:33:51,780 --> 01:33:53,940
but I think the top tier people wear, like,

2630
01:33:53,940 --> 01:33:55,860
kind of a naval uniform.

2631
01:33:55,860 --> 01:33:58,700
Oh, like Captain Stubing type, like loveboat outfits?

2632
01:33:58,700 --> 01:34:00,420
I think so, yes, yeah.

2633
01:34:00,420 --> 01:34:01,620
Oh.

2634
01:34:01,620 --> 01:34:03,260
So it's so great.

2635
01:34:03,260 --> 01:34:04,860
And then there's like, even in the little mini-mart,

2636
01:34:04,860 --> 01:34:06,980
there's nautical gear everywhere,

2637
01:34:06,980 --> 01:34:09,860
like navigational panels and old stoves

2638
01:34:09,860 --> 01:34:11,700
and that kind of thing, and there's flags waving

2639
01:34:11,700 --> 01:34:13,220
on a big mast.

2640
01:34:13,220 --> 01:34:15,380
And then you go into a gift shop.

2641
01:34:15,380 --> 01:34:16,660
So if you are getting the full wash,

2642
01:34:16,660 --> 01:34:18,140
there is so much to do,

2643
01:34:18,140 --> 01:34:20,380
because then you can go into the Queen's Chest,

2644
01:34:20,380 --> 01:34:23,860
which is a very Knott's Berry Farm-style,

2645
01:34:23,860 --> 01:34:26,900
old knickknacks kind of store,

2646
01:34:26,900 --> 01:34:29,220
where they're selling postcards and cards

2647
01:34:29,220 --> 01:34:34,220
and like big brim picnic hats and a huge wine selection.

2648
01:34:34,980 --> 01:34:36,300
And it's like good wines,

2649
01:34:36,300 --> 01:34:41,300
because you're up closer to Napa or S.R.O.L.S. or whatever.

2650
01:34:41,820 --> 01:34:46,820
There is a huge fish tank full of like beautiful carp.

2651
01:34:47,380 --> 01:34:50,020
And there's like a plaque telling you about the carp

2652
01:34:50,020 --> 01:34:51,540
and the history of carp.

2653
01:34:51,540 --> 01:34:52,380
Wow.

2654
01:34:52,380 --> 01:34:55,300
There's spectacular fish in this really nice,

2655
01:34:55,300 --> 01:34:57,180
like a lot of wood surrounding it.

2656
01:34:57,180 --> 01:35:01,340
And then for some reason, up on top of the fish tank,

2657
01:35:01,340 --> 01:35:03,460
off to the right, not centered,

2658
01:35:03,460 --> 01:35:08,460
is a framed sepia-toned photo of Jessica Chastain.

2659
01:35:08,780 --> 01:35:10,620
And there's not anything else like that.

2660
01:35:10,620 --> 01:35:12,700
There's no other celebrity presence.

2661
01:35:12,700 --> 01:35:13,740
She didn't sign it.

2662
01:35:13,740 --> 01:35:15,200
I don't think she's been there.

2663
01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:18,220
They just want to pay tribute to a great lady.

2664
01:35:18,220 --> 01:35:19,060
What?

2665
01:35:19,060 --> 01:35:21,380
That's like when people would frame the picture

2666
01:35:21,380 --> 01:35:24,380
of the president and hang it in their home.

2667
01:35:24,380 --> 01:35:26,980
Or like government offices still have that,

2668
01:35:26,980 --> 01:35:28,820
where it's like they rotate the-

2669
01:35:28,820 --> 01:35:31,820
Or like Elvis in a Thai restaurant.

2670
01:35:32,860 --> 01:35:34,460
This is our favorite celebrity in Campbell.

2671
01:35:34,460 --> 01:35:36,260
Is she from Campbell?

2672
01:35:36,260 --> 01:35:37,100
Oh, maybe.

2673
01:35:37,100 --> 01:35:37,940
I don't know.

2674
01:35:37,940 --> 01:35:40,060
She is from, she was born in Sacramento.

2675
01:35:40,620 --> 01:35:42,100
How close to Campbell is that?

2676
01:35:42,100 --> 01:35:44,260
What if she works there or something?

2677
01:35:44,260 --> 01:35:45,380
It's on the way.

2678
01:35:45,380 --> 01:35:48,860
There was a mini sock market, like a novelty.

2679
01:35:48,860 --> 01:35:49,700
Wow, really?

2680
01:35:49,700 --> 01:35:50,520
Oh yeah.

2681
01:35:50,520 --> 01:35:53,500
Area, so much stuff to look at.

2682
01:35:53,500 --> 01:35:57,820
But then the best part of it was that this felt like,

2683
01:35:57,820 --> 01:36:00,140
because we did this with a little bit of,

2684
01:36:00,140 --> 01:36:01,740
this wasn't like go do the car wash

2685
01:36:01,740 --> 01:36:03,080
and turn around immediately.

2686
01:36:03,080 --> 01:36:06,300
We left ourselves a free afternoon in San Jose

2687
01:36:06,300 --> 01:36:08,220
with absolutely no plans.

2688
01:36:08,220 --> 01:36:12,340
So we found, this basically felt like a scavenger hunt

2689
01:36:12,340 --> 01:36:14,700
where you go to location number one

2690
01:36:14,700 --> 01:36:16,500
and then you get a clue that takes you

2691
01:36:16,500 --> 01:36:17,980
to location number two.

2692
01:36:17,980 --> 01:36:22,260
Because we picked up a book about San Jose oddities.

2693
01:36:22,260 --> 01:36:23,740
And I'm flipping through the book

2694
01:36:23,740 --> 01:36:28,060
and I'm stopped cold by the dead eyes of Chuck E. Cheese.

2695
01:36:28,060 --> 01:36:29,940
There's a big Chuck E. Cheese picture

2696
01:36:29,940 --> 01:36:33,260
and it's pointing out how, I've totally forgot about this,

2697
01:36:33,260 --> 01:36:35,940
Chuck E. Cheese started in San Jose.

2698
01:36:35,940 --> 01:36:39,020
That's where no one started the whole thing.

2699
01:36:39,020 --> 01:36:42,340
So I'm like, oh, could we go to the first Chuck E. Cheese?

2700
01:36:42,340 --> 01:36:45,240
The answer is no, but there is this other one

2701
01:36:45,240 --> 01:36:48,540
that was considered the flagship Chuck E. Cheese.

2702
01:36:48,540 --> 01:36:50,780
And this, like everything else in the day

2703
01:36:50,780 --> 01:36:52,740
is only 10 minutes away.

2704
01:36:52,740 --> 01:36:53,580
Wow.

2705
01:36:53,580 --> 01:36:57,580
And the book also says that this particular

2706
01:36:57,580 --> 01:37:00,500
Chuck E. Cheese location is haunted

2707
01:37:00,500 --> 01:37:03,940
by the ghosts of two children who fell to their deaths

2708
01:37:03,940 --> 01:37:05,500
on the site. Oh my God.

2709
01:37:05,500 --> 01:37:06,500
Oh no.

2710
01:37:06,500 --> 01:37:07,340
Jesus.

2711
01:37:07,340 --> 01:37:08,180
What are you talking about?

2712
01:37:08,180 --> 01:37:09,300
The book says this?

2713
01:37:09,300 --> 01:37:12,100
The book says, yes, this is verified in writing.

2714
01:37:12,100 --> 01:37:14,540
Did they fall from the ball pit tunnel?

2715
01:37:14,540 --> 01:37:15,940
Like the top ball pit tunnel?

2716
01:37:15,940 --> 01:37:16,760
Oh yeah.

2717
01:37:16,760 --> 01:37:18,500
That's why they don't have these things anymore.

2718
01:37:18,500 --> 01:37:19,900
Right. Yeah.

2719
01:37:19,900 --> 01:37:22,060
I don't know.

2720
01:37:22,060 --> 01:37:25,060
Well, I mean, what I found out is that,

2721
01:37:25,060 --> 01:37:29,500
so then we went to it, there was no sign of the haunting.

2722
01:37:29,500 --> 01:37:31,940
I didn't discover really anything there.

2723
01:37:31,940 --> 01:37:33,900
You didn't see the bones of the children?

2724
01:37:33,900 --> 01:37:36,060
They didn't just leave them untouched

2725
01:37:36,060 --> 01:37:38,340
so as to not anger the spirits.

2726
01:37:39,380 --> 01:37:42,220
This is, I could see why there'd be rumors

2727
01:37:42,220 --> 01:37:46,300
of a falling situation because it is a three story

2728
01:37:46,300 --> 01:37:47,140
Chuck E. Cheese.

2729
01:37:47,140 --> 01:37:47,960
Wow.

2730
01:37:47,960 --> 01:37:49,180
This is massive.

2731
01:37:49,180 --> 01:37:53,300
I believe that the story of the kids who died

2732
01:37:53,300 --> 01:37:55,660
is leftover from the previous tenants

2733
01:37:55,660 --> 01:37:58,740
because this was a 70s toy store,

2734
01:37:58,740 --> 01:38:03,740
a massive 70s toy store that had like big kind of cages

2735
01:38:03,860 --> 01:38:07,140
on the outside and there was a different wooden soldier,

2736
01:38:07,140 --> 01:38:10,100
like a giant wooden soldier in every one of them.

2737
01:38:10,100 --> 01:38:11,140
I've seen pictures of it now.

2738
01:38:11,140 --> 01:38:13,420
This place looked incredible.

2739
01:38:13,420 --> 01:38:15,820
But now it's the Chuck E. Cheese,

2740
01:38:15,820 --> 01:38:17,500
the flagship location for a long time.

2741
01:38:17,500 --> 01:38:20,060
The children, the accident happened at the toy store

2742
01:38:20,060 --> 01:38:20,900
or the Chuck E. Cheese?

2743
01:38:20,900 --> 01:38:22,140
I think it's unclear.

2744
01:38:22,140 --> 01:38:23,140
You can Google this.

2745
01:38:23,140 --> 01:38:25,540
There's discussion of these rumors, but no concrete proof.

2746
01:38:25,540 --> 01:38:27,580
We got no names on these kids.

2747
01:38:27,580 --> 01:38:28,940
So I don't know.

2748
01:38:28,940 --> 01:38:31,700
And did you find the San Jose Audities book

2749
01:38:31,700 --> 01:38:34,340
at the car wash or you bought it in advance of your trip?

2750
01:38:34,340 --> 01:38:35,700
No, no, that was at the car wash.

2751
01:38:35,700 --> 01:38:36,660
So we had no idea.

2752
01:38:36,660 --> 01:38:40,340
We'd never heard of this gigantic Chuck E. Cheese.

2753
01:38:40,340 --> 01:38:41,180
Yes.

2754
01:38:41,180 --> 01:38:44,180
So like a movie you pick up, oh, this is interesting.

2755
01:38:44,180 --> 01:38:46,740
Take it right to the cash register.

2756
01:38:46,740 --> 01:38:47,740
Well, look, I didn't buy it.

2757
01:38:47,740 --> 01:38:48,740
I just got what I needed.

2758
01:38:48,740 --> 01:38:49,580
Oh, okay.

2759
01:38:49,580 --> 01:38:50,660
Sorry, I ripped off the-

2760
01:38:50,660 --> 01:38:51,780
Jason can appreciate that.

2761
01:38:51,780 --> 01:38:52,780
Yeah, you gotta appreciate that.

2762
01:38:52,780 --> 01:38:54,320
And you got a few minutes while that's going

2763
01:38:54,320 --> 01:38:55,160
through that car wash.

2764
01:38:55,160 --> 01:38:56,140
We paid for the car wash.

2765
01:38:56,140 --> 01:38:58,100
So what do you want?

2766
01:38:58,100 --> 01:39:03,100
So anyway, it's a, it is a three story Chuck E. Cheese.

2767
01:39:03,500 --> 01:39:07,420
The visitors can only access the bottom two floors.

2768
01:39:07,420 --> 01:39:09,620
And it is extremely impressive.

2769
01:39:09,620 --> 01:39:12,420
It is the biggest Chuck E. Cheese I've ever seen by far.

2770
01:39:12,420 --> 01:39:16,100
I think it was, I think the biggest in the country at least.

2771
01:39:16,100 --> 01:39:21,100
The top story used to be Chuck E. Cheese University.

2772
01:39:21,180 --> 01:39:24,180
This is where they would train general managers.

2773
01:39:24,180 --> 01:39:26,580
So if you were running a Chuck E. Cheese

2774
01:39:26,580 --> 01:39:28,940
anywhere in the country, at some point you had to make

2775
01:39:28,940 --> 01:39:32,020
the sojourn to San Jose to get your training

2776
01:39:32,020 --> 01:39:34,820
and probably watch all those great videos

2777
01:39:34,820 --> 01:39:35,980
that are all up on YouTube.

2778
01:39:35,980 --> 01:39:38,020
Cause we, there's hours of these Chuck E. Cheese training.

2779
01:39:38,020 --> 01:39:39,860
And it's not there anymore.

2780
01:39:39,860 --> 01:39:42,500
I don't, I know, I believe it is now storage.

2781
01:39:42,500 --> 01:39:44,140
So we can get up there somehow.

2782
01:39:44,140 --> 01:39:47,100
I think there are like old Chucks and Munches

2783
01:39:47,100 --> 01:39:47,940
all rusting away.

2784
01:39:47,940 --> 01:39:48,820
Oh, there have to be.

2785
01:39:48,820 --> 01:39:52,060
I will go back to do my masters at Chuck E. Cheese University.

2786
01:39:52,060 --> 01:39:53,100
I-

2787
01:39:53,100 --> 01:39:53,940
PhD.

2788
01:39:53,940 --> 01:39:56,500
I will fly up to Campbell to do that.

2789
01:39:57,460 --> 01:39:59,540
There's a McDonald's University in Pasadena

2790
01:39:59,540 --> 01:40:01,540
that I've, there's an art gallery next to it.

2791
01:40:01,540 --> 01:40:02,860
I've heard of McDonald's University.

2792
01:40:02,860 --> 01:40:04,780
It smells like french fries in the art gallery.

2793
01:40:04,780 --> 01:40:07,420
Cause it's next door to the McDonald's University.

2794
01:40:07,420 --> 01:40:09,580
Jason will get his doctorate.

2795
01:40:09,580 --> 01:40:10,660
Jason will get his doctorate.

2796
01:40:10,660 --> 01:40:11,500
Sure, yeah.

2797
01:40:11,500 --> 01:40:14,420
A lot of people go back to school in their late 20s, 30s,

2798
01:40:14,420 --> 01:40:17,500
you know, and we're going to McDonald's University,

2799
01:40:17,500 --> 01:40:19,700
Chuck E. Cheese University.

2800
01:40:19,700 --> 01:40:20,540
Yeah.

2801
01:40:20,540 --> 01:40:21,380
Yeah, yeah.

2802
01:40:21,940 --> 01:40:24,100
You know, adult education should be celebrated.

2803
01:40:24,100 --> 01:40:24,940
Sure.

2804
01:40:24,940 --> 01:40:25,780
I agree.

2805
01:40:25,780 --> 01:40:27,260
Lifelong learning.

2806
01:40:27,260 --> 01:40:30,820
So the Chuck E. Cheese itself,

2807
01:40:30,820 --> 01:40:33,380
fantastic, huge sprawling, no robots, no full-

2808
01:40:33,380 --> 01:40:34,580
I was going to say no full-munch.

2809
01:40:34,580 --> 01:40:35,420
That sucks.

2810
01:40:35,420 --> 01:40:36,820
No full-munch unfortunately.

2811
01:40:36,820 --> 01:40:40,260
But, and no sign of the, the haunt.

2812
01:40:40,260 --> 01:40:42,180
I couldn't find evidence of that,

2813
01:40:42,180 --> 01:40:47,180
but I was haunted by what I found on the outside,

2814
01:40:47,460 --> 01:40:50,260
which is what I just said about how there's the three cages

2815
01:40:50,260 --> 01:40:51,780
with the soldiers.

2816
01:40:52,900 --> 01:40:55,140
There's now, there's still those three big cages,

2817
01:40:55,140 --> 01:40:56,700
but only one of them is filled.

2818
01:40:56,700 --> 01:41:01,700
And it is filled by a 20 foot tall plaster Chuck E. Cheese

2819
01:41:01,780 --> 01:41:03,380
that you can see from the freeway.

2820
01:41:03,380 --> 01:41:04,220
Whoa.

2821
01:41:04,220 --> 01:41:05,100
It is huge.

2822
01:41:05,100 --> 01:41:08,380
We took pictures of us next to it, just for proportion,

2823
01:41:08,380 --> 01:41:11,340
gigantic Chuck E. Cheese.

2824
01:41:11,340 --> 01:41:16,340
And he is, he's sitting and he is crossing his legs

2825
01:41:17,980 --> 01:41:20,020
and he is pantsless.

2826
01:41:20,860 --> 01:41:25,860
So you can just stare into the giant unspecified crotch

2827
01:41:27,460 --> 01:41:30,900
of a huge like dying in the sun Chuck E. Cheese.

2828
01:41:30,900 --> 01:41:32,220
It's like a basic instinct Chuck E. Cheese.

2829
01:41:32,220 --> 01:41:35,060
Yeah, I was going to say,

2830
01:41:35,060 --> 01:41:39,180
can someone edit like the Chuck E. Cheese photo

2831
01:41:39,180 --> 01:41:41,580
and then a shot of the sweaty, wavy night?

2832
01:41:41,580 --> 01:41:42,420
Like, ah.

2833
01:41:43,780 --> 01:41:44,900
What are you gonna do?

2834
01:41:44,900 --> 01:41:45,740
Is it?

2835
01:41:45,740 --> 01:41:46,580
Is it?

2836
01:41:46,580 --> 01:41:48,420
You're smoking?

2837
01:41:48,420 --> 01:41:50,460
You had sex, Helen and I had sex.

2838
01:41:50,460 --> 01:41:51,300
Yeah.

2839
01:41:51,300 --> 01:41:52,780
And she gave me pleasure.

2840
01:41:53,780 --> 01:41:55,300
You ever fucked on cocaine?

2841
01:41:56,820 --> 01:41:57,660
It's nice.

2842
01:42:00,060 --> 01:42:01,980
It's very entertaining.

2843
01:42:04,340 --> 01:42:06,100
Is it old Chuck or is it new Chuck?

2844
01:42:06,100 --> 01:42:06,940
It's old Chuck.

2845
01:42:06,940 --> 01:42:07,780
Yeah.

2846
01:42:07,780 --> 01:42:08,620
Good, good.

2847
01:42:08,620 --> 01:42:10,820
Yes, they went, we can't change that one.

2848
01:42:10,820 --> 01:42:11,660
No.

2849
01:42:11,660 --> 01:42:14,620
And he's just chipping away, like flecks of the paint,

2850
01:42:14,620 --> 01:42:15,460
falling off.

2851
01:42:15,460 --> 01:42:16,300
Wow.

2852
01:42:16,300 --> 01:42:18,140
I saw a Reddit comment from somebody who said,

2853
01:42:18,860 --> 01:42:20,260
like their friend's dad built that.

2854
01:42:20,260 --> 01:42:21,260
Wow.

2855
01:42:21,260 --> 01:42:22,220
In the early 80s.

2856
01:42:22,220 --> 01:42:25,140
So it's such classic early 80s Chuck E. Cheese.

2857
01:42:25,140 --> 01:42:27,180
And we would have never, I never knew about this.

2858
01:42:27,180 --> 01:42:28,580
This is perfect podcast.

2859
01:42:28,580 --> 01:42:29,620
My God.

2860
01:42:29,620 --> 01:42:32,580
That we stumbled into just thanks to heading up

2861
01:42:32,580 --> 01:42:35,340
to check out the old riverboat, the Delta Queen.

2862
01:42:35,340 --> 01:42:37,220
Still, because this all happened so quickly,

2863
01:42:37,220 --> 01:42:38,740
still hours to kill.

2864
01:42:38,740 --> 01:42:42,740
So we went to a bizarre mall, the Eastridge Mall.

2865
01:42:42,740 --> 01:42:46,620
We went to, we had a drink at a airport hotel lobby

2866
01:42:46,620 --> 01:42:49,700
right nearby that happened to be one that I had watched

2867
01:42:49,700 --> 01:42:53,020
a video of from the early 90s on YouTube.

2868
01:42:53,020 --> 01:42:54,780
Like I have like, oh boy, I'd really like to go

2869
01:42:54,780 --> 01:42:57,380
to that San Jose hotel someday.

2870
01:42:57,380 --> 01:42:59,500
Like it was a bar called Maxi's.

2871
01:42:59,500 --> 01:43:00,340
Whoa.

2872
01:43:00,340 --> 01:43:03,260
If I could ever be in Maxi's, and it's not Maxi's anymore,

2873
01:43:03,260 --> 01:43:05,380
but it's the space where Maxi's used to be.

2874
01:43:05,380 --> 01:43:06,660
We had a great drink there.

2875
01:43:06,660 --> 01:43:08,100
What's it called?

2876
01:43:08,100 --> 01:43:11,940
Ooh, it was, it's some just like, what I want to say

2877
01:43:11,940 --> 01:43:15,220
is it's like 360 olives or something.

2878
01:43:15,220 --> 01:43:16,060
Perfect.

2879
01:43:16,220 --> 01:43:17,060
Okay, all right.

2880
01:43:17,060 --> 01:43:19,620
I don't recall, but some bizarre hotel bar name.

2881
01:43:19,620 --> 01:43:22,060
I feel like you're about to say you like renewed your vows.

2882
01:43:22,060 --> 01:43:23,900
Like this is like such a great day.

2883
01:43:23,900 --> 01:43:26,260
I know it felt pretty much, I think it did.

2884
01:43:26,260 --> 01:43:30,580
I mean like, if I could just cut to the chase and say,

2885
01:43:30,580 --> 01:43:35,580
this was absolutely the best date that Aaron and I have had

2886
01:43:35,620 --> 01:43:38,700
since becoming parents, since COVID.

2887
01:43:38,700 --> 01:43:43,260
It was like, we were just so juiced the whole day.

2888
01:43:43,260 --> 01:43:45,580
It was spectacular.

2889
01:43:45,580 --> 01:43:47,740
We have the Delta Queen to thank for.

2890
01:43:47,740 --> 01:43:48,580
Oh my gosh.

2891
01:43:48,580 --> 01:43:49,420
Oh my God.

2892
01:43:49,420 --> 01:43:50,860
Thank you, themed car washes.

2893
01:43:50,860 --> 01:43:51,700
Yay.

2894
01:43:51,700 --> 01:43:53,500
Wow, yeah.

2895
01:43:53,500 --> 01:43:55,340
Not only, which is one more thing also.

2896
01:43:55,340 --> 01:43:57,100
Then we like, okay, so then we're back,

2897
01:43:57,100 --> 01:44:01,500
we return the car, like we only had it for five hours total.

2898
01:44:01,500 --> 01:44:03,140
Get back to the airport early

2899
01:44:03,140 --> 01:44:06,380
so that we can spend ample time, just have a relaxing drink

2900
01:44:06,380 --> 01:44:10,940
at Trader Vic's in the San Jose airport.

2901
01:44:10,940 --> 01:44:14,500
One of only three Trader Vic's in America.

2902
01:44:14,500 --> 01:44:15,340
Oh my God.

2903
01:44:16,180 --> 01:44:18,020
And it happens to be there.

2904
01:44:18,020 --> 01:44:19,940
So we took our sweet time,

2905
01:44:19,940 --> 01:44:23,700
and this wasn't even like an imitation of a tiki bar.

2906
01:44:23,700 --> 01:44:28,180
This was like just a legit great, really good Mai Tai,

2907
01:44:28,180 --> 01:44:33,180
really good drink made specifically for the San Jose airport.

2908
01:44:33,580 --> 01:44:35,700
And we relaxed so much in fact,

2909
01:44:35,700 --> 01:44:38,100
that we had a first in our lives,

2910
01:44:38,100 --> 01:44:43,100
which is the PA calling us to the plane.

2911
01:44:43,140 --> 01:44:43,980
Oh wow.

2912
01:44:43,980 --> 01:44:46,060
The airport is like not a big security line,

2913
01:44:46,060 --> 01:44:49,820
but we had to sprint across it essentially

2914
01:44:49,820 --> 01:44:51,660
after downing Mai Tai's.

2915
01:44:53,180 --> 01:44:56,260
Because look, the planes up there are just like,

2916
01:44:56,260 --> 01:44:59,460
like a Wednesday 520 flight from San Jose

2917
01:44:59,460 --> 01:45:01,060
is like a bus essentially.

2918
01:45:01,060 --> 01:45:01,900
Yeah, yeah.

2919
01:45:01,900 --> 01:45:02,940
Everybody, let's get the fuck out of here.

2920
01:45:02,940 --> 01:45:03,760
Yeah, yeah.

2921
01:45:03,760 --> 01:45:04,860
Yeah, they'll wait.

2922
01:45:04,860 --> 01:45:06,020
They'll wait for you.

2923
01:45:08,020 --> 01:45:10,220
Go check the Trader Vic's.

2924
01:45:10,220 --> 01:45:13,460
We got another, we got another couple of dirt bags.

2925
01:45:14,260 --> 01:45:16,340
Trying to finish their juice drinks.

2926
01:45:16,340 --> 01:45:17,820
We know where the dirt bags land.

2927
01:45:17,820 --> 01:45:20,300
Wow, you know, you always hear couples counselors

2928
01:45:20,300 --> 01:45:21,420
or marriage counselors go like,

2929
01:45:21,420 --> 01:45:23,060
you gotta keep it interesting, you know,

2930
01:45:23,060 --> 01:45:24,900
especially when you've been together for a long time.

2931
01:45:24,900 --> 01:45:27,620
This is what they talking about.

2932
01:45:27,620 --> 01:45:29,700
You guys took the ball around with the,

2933
01:45:29,700 --> 01:45:31,460
you understood the assignment.

2934
01:45:33,220 --> 01:45:34,140
Absolutely.

2935
01:45:34,140 --> 01:45:37,540
I mean, look, this entire, it was such a thrill.

2936
01:45:37,540 --> 01:45:39,500
Like it, and it felt like a day, you know,

2937
01:45:39,500 --> 01:45:41,180
Eva, you set the bar so high.

2938
01:45:41,180 --> 01:45:45,580
I mean, this day was like undeniably a spiritual sequel

2939
01:45:45,580 --> 01:45:48,900
to what you did with the Doughboys going to Chili's 2

2940
01:45:48,900 --> 01:45:50,900
and returning immediately.

2941
01:45:50,900 --> 01:45:52,980
So you opened us up to the possibility

2942
01:45:52,980 --> 01:45:56,620
that there could be a great day from going to an airport

2943
01:45:56,620 --> 01:46:00,180
for an inconveniently, an odd short amount of time.

2944
01:46:00,180 --> 01:46:01,020
Oh yeah.

2945
01:46:01,020 --> 01:46:03,660
I mean, I mentioned this in the Doughboys podcast

2946
01:46:03,660 --> 01:46:05,900
for Chili's 2, but the fact that Nick Weigert

2947
01:46:05,900 --> 01:46:08,940
walked on the plane with only his little suitcase

2948
01:46:08,940 --> 01:46:10,700
that held his Nintendo Switch.

2949
01:46:11,220 --> 01:46:12,460
His tiny Switch it is.

2950
01:46:12,460 --> 01:46:14,020
I was like, this is so cool.

2951
01:46:14,020 --> 01:46:16,740
And he just like, that's all he carried the whole day.

2952
01:46:16,740 --> 01:46:17,580
Yeah.

2953
01:46:17,580 --> 01:46:18,420
It's so fun.

2954
01:46:18,420 --> 01:46:20,180
It feels so great to just walk on and off of it.

2955
01:46:20,180 --> 01:46:21,780
And then like just walk out.

2956
01:46:21,780 --> 01:46:25,740
We just walked out of Burbank, parked really close,

2957
01:46:25,740 --> 01:46:27,140
got back early in fact.

2958
01:46:27,140 --> 01:46:29,060
So we were like, let's just keep this train rolling.

2959
01:46:29,060 --> 01:46:33,380
So we went to the Burbank airport Marriott.

2960
01:46:33,380 --> 01:46:34,220
Oh yeah.

2961
01:46:34,220 --> 01:46:35,780
Home of BugCon, get your tickets.

2962
01:46:35,780 --> 01:46:36,740
If you haven't already.

2963
01:46:36,740 --> 01:46:37,580
It's the final BugCon.

2964
01:46:37,580 --> 01:46:39,300
The last BugCon, you gotta go.

2965
01:46:39,500 --> 01:46:41,100
If you haven't, if you've been thinking about it,

2966
01:46:41,100 --> 01:46:42,180
clock's ticking.

2967
01:46:42,180 --> 01:46:45,020
Another drink there at the weird bar with all the bees.

2968
01:46:46,020 --> 01:46:47,500
It's only the aware of the bees.

2969
01:46:47,500 --> 01:46:49,180
Buzz, there are bees at this.

2970
01:46:50,180 --> 01:46:52,700
But anyway, this was like, this was the greatest day.

2971
01:46:52,700 --> 01:46:53,540
Oh my gosh.

2972
01:46:53,540 --> 01:46:55,020
Thank you Eva for inspiring it.

2973
01:46:55,020 --> 01:46:58,820
Thank you for, thank you to everyone at Delta Car Wash,

2974
01:46:58,820 --> 01:47:00,780
Delta Queen Car Wash for all you do.

2975
01:47:01,740 --> 01:47:02,580
Boy, incredible.

2976
01:47:02,580 --> 01:47:04,580
There's still magic in the world.

2977
01:47:04,580 --> 01:47:06,380
I think so, yes.

2978
01:47:06,380 --> 01:47:07,420
And you know what?

2979
01:47:07,420 --> 01:47:09,900
You know you're gonna find it at a theme park or something.

2980
01:47:09,900 --> 01:47:11,300
That's what you expect.

2981
01:47:11,300 --> 01:47:14,780
But little touches of it just in Hawthorne

2982
01:47:14,780 --> 01:47:16,900
or in Campbell, California,

2983
01:47:16,900 --> 01:47:19,780
that's surprises around the corner.

2984
01:47:19,780 --> 01:47:20,620
That is how it feels.

2985
01:47:20,620 --> 01:47:22,380
It was like the most magical thing since COVID.

2986
01:47:22,380 --> 01:47:23,220
It was great.

2987
01:47:23,220 --> 01:47:24,660
Oh man, I'm so happy.

2988
01:47:24,660 --> 01:47:25,980
There you go.

2989
01:47:25,980 --> 01:47:27,380
So, yes.

2990
01:47:27,380 --> 01:47:29,380
I have a little surprise for you guys.

2991
01:47:29,380 --> 01:47:30,780
Speaking of surprises.

2992
01:47:30,780 --> 01:47:32,780
Wow, wow, still bombs getting thrown.

2993
01:47:32,780 --> 01:47:34,100
But if you wanna rank.

2994
01:47:34,100 --> 01:47:36,140
Pulls out a gun and just kills us.

2995
01:47:36,180 --> 01:47:37,020
Oh my God.

2996
01:47:39,020 --> 01:47:40,620
Pam, pam, pam.

2997
01:47:40,620 --> 01:47:41,740
Doesn't get better than this.

2998
01:47:41,740 --> 01:47:43,020
Yeah.

2999
01:47:43,020 --> 01:47:43,860
Just Scott.

3000
01:47:43,860 --> 01:47:44,700
We'll never top that.

3001
01:47:44,700 --> 01:47:46,660
Someone, someone get the SD.

3002
01:47:46,660 --> 01:47:48,140
I'm going out high.

3003
01:47:48,140 --> 01:47:50,220
Someone get the SD card.

3004
01:47:50,220 --> 01:47:51,820
Someone preserve a legacy.

3005
01:47:52,740 --> 01:47:55,900
Get this to the Club 3 subscribers.

3006
01:47:55,900 --> 01:47:58,140
Oh, rank, I mean, look, I enjoy,

3007
01:47:58,140 --> 01:47:59,860
this day was better.

3008
01:47:59,860 --> 01:48:02,820
This absolute, the whole day was so much better than like,

3009
01:48:02,820 --> 01:48:04,900
if you get to Disneyland and it's so crowded

3010
01:48:04,900 --> 01:48:06,780
that you know you're not really gonna get on anything

3011
01:48:06,780 --> 01:48:07,780
and it's hot as hell.

3012
01:48:07,780 --> 01:48:10,820
We've had worse days at Disneyland than this day

3013
01:48:10,820 --> 01:48:13,020
to San Jose, to the car wash and back.

3014
01:48:13,020 --> 01:48:14,140
Absolutely.

3015
01:48:14,140 --> 01:48:16,020
So this is an A plus plus.

3016
01:48:16,020 --> 01:48:20,900
This is the ultimate volcano erupting all over our minds

3017
01:48:20,900 --> 01:48:22,300
as highly as I could rank it.

3018
01:48:22,300 --> 01:48:24,820
I was, I looked at the map and I was like,

3019
01:48:24,820 --> 01:48:26,100
oh man, I wish I had known.

3020
01:48:26,100 --> 01:48:31,100
I did drive by this area when we went up to Napa Valley.

3021
01:48:31,220 --> 01:48:34,260
And then I realized there's this long stretch

3022
01:48:34,260 --> 01:48:36,340
of California where the five and the 101

3023
01:48:36,340 --> 01:48:38,380
are miles and miles apart,

3024
01:48:38,380 --> 01:48:40,340
but they run parallel to each other.

3025
01:48:40,340 --> 01:48:41,180
Yeah.

3026
01:48:41,180 --> 01:48:44,620
And a bunch of, we took the five

3027
01:48:44,620 --> 01:48:48,980
and a bunch of interesting stuff was like either direction.

3028
01:48:48,980 --> 01:48:51,700
And I had a weird moment where I was like,

3029
01:48:51,700 --> 01:48:53,220
oh my God, we've been driving forever

3030
01:48:53,220 --> 01:48:55,820
and we've only passed P. Soup Anderson's.

3031
01:48:55,820 --> 01:49:00,260
And then I discovered, I think there's two P. Soup Anderson's.

3032
01:49:00,260 --> 01:49:01,100
There are, yeah, yeah.

3033
01:49:01,100 --> 01:49:04,140
Yeah, so I, in lieu of this,

3034
01:49:04,980 --> 01:49:06,660
for most of the drive, I listened,

3035
01:49:06,660 --> 01:49:09,180
I listened to half of Jamie Loftus's Ghost Town,

3036
01:49:09,180 --> 01:49:10,020
which is very good.

3037
01:49:10,020 --> 01:49:13,260
And then I listened to the cycle of Doughboy's live episodes

3038
01:49:13,260 --> 01:49:16,500
with Gabris and Carl Tart,

3039
01:49:16,500 --> 01:49:19,220
but I went backwards so they get less fucked up

3040
01:49:19,220 --> 01:49:22,460
as it goes along, which was an experience.

3041
01:49:22,460 --> 01:49:24,140
That's so fun.

3042
01:49:24,140 --> 01:49:24,980
What's going on?

3043
01:49:24,980 --> 01:49:26,700
What do you have store for us?

3044
01:49:26,700 --> 01:49:29,140
Well, you just gotta, do you compare it to a ride?

3045
01:49:29,140 --> 01:49:31,620
Oh, well, it's, I mean, it's easy to say

3046
01:49:31,620 --> 01:49:34,060
it's like the Mark Twain, but better.

3047
01:49:34,980 --> 01:49:35,820
They finally improved on it

3048
01:49:35,820 --> 01:49:37,740
because I can drive my car onto it.

3049
01:49:39,020 --> 01:49:41,900
Okay, so this is a surprise for you guys

3050
01:49:41,900 --> 01:49:45,060
via my brother Dash, who you guys have met.

3051
01:49:45,060 --> 01:49:48,460
Also the person who located the missing Dick Tracy book

3052
01:49:48,460 --> 01:49:50,860
and brought one copy of it to Griffin Newman.

3053
01:49:50,860 --> 01:49:52,300
Oh my God, wonderful.

3054
01:49:52,300 --> 01:49:54,660
Solid dude, listen to the show.

3055
01:49:55,620 --> 01:49:57,140
Call my brother Solid Dude, he is.

3056
01:49:57,140 --> 01:49:58,380
That's nice, not everybody feels that way

3057
01:49:58,380 --> 01:49:59,500
about their brother.

3058
01:49:59,500 --> 01:50:00,540
The best.

3059
01:50:00,540 --> 01:50:02,980
He, so he was in town last week.

3060
01:50:02,980 --> 01:50:07,940
My mom and aunt grew up in a house in,

3061
01:50:07,940 --> 01:50:10,860
off Coldwater Canyon that my grandparents bought,

3062
01:50:10,860 --> 01:50:12,420
like way, way, way back when.

3063
01:50:13,500 --> 01:50:17,180
And they, it's being sold.

3064
01:50:17,180 --> 01:50:20,820
And so the fam, we're having to like go through

3065
01:50:20,820 --> 01:50:23,020
and clear out all these rooms of things

3066
01:50:23,020 --> 01:50:25,260
that have been there forever.

3067
01:50:25,260 --> 01:50:28,700
So Dash moved a file cabinet in a back bedroom

3068
01:50:28,700 --> 01:50:30,380
and opened a closet that hasn't been opened

3069
01:50:30,380 --> 01:50:31,940
for several decades.

3070
01:50:31,940 --> 01:50:32,780
Wow.

3071
01:50:32,780 --> 01:50:33,620
Oh wow.

3072
01:50:33,620 --> 01:50:36,100
And inside he brought, he found this bag,

3073
01:50:36,100 --> 01:50:38,900
which is full of gifts for you guys.

3074
01:50:38,900 --> 01:50:39,900
What?

3075
01:50:39,900 --> 01:50:41,540
Whoa.

3076
01:50:41,540 --> 01:50:43,060
The bag itself.

3077
01:50:43,060 --> 01:50:45,180
The bag itself is a Living Seas bag.

3078
01:50:45,180 --> 01:50:49,260
With the big, with the logo, with the icon of it,

3079
01:50:49,260 --> 01:50:51,700
presented by, what is it presented by?

3080
01:50:51,700 --> 01:50:53,220
Presented by United Technologies.

3081
01:50:53,220 --> 01:50:55,620
United Technologies, cause guys,

3082
01:50:55,620 --> 01:50:59,740
this bag is untouched from 1989.

3083
01:50:59,740 --> 01:51:00,980
Oh wow.

3084
01:51:00,980 --> 01:51:03,100
Do you guys know what happened in 1989?

3085
01:51:03,100 --> 01:51:04,580
Yes.

3086
01:51:04,580 --> 01:51:05,820
Well, I don't know.

3087
01:51:05,820 --> 01:51:07,940
I know some things that happened in 89.

3088
01:51:07,940 --> 01:51:09,260
Is that what?

3089
01:51:09,260 --> 01:51:11,580
MGM Studios grand opening.

3090
01:51:11,580 --> 01:51:13,140
Whoa, cool.

3091
01:51:13,140 --> 01:51:16,620
This is stuff from the grand opening of MGM Studios.

3092
01:51:16,620 --> 01:51:17,860
Oh my God.

3093
01:51:17,860 --> 01:51:19,820
That has been in a closet this whole time.

3094
01:51:19,820 --> 01:51:20,660
Oh my God.

3095
01:51:20,660 --> 01:51:21,500
Sorry.

3096
01:51:21,500 --> 01:51:22,340
This.

3097
01:51:22,340 --> 01:51:24,460
From the grand opening, wow.

3098
01:51:24,460 --> 01:51:28,780
So first of all, you guys all get Mickey toiletry kit.

3099
01:51:28,780 --> 01:51:29,620
Whoa.

3100
01:51:30,980 --> 01:51:35,380
They all have, they have a, you could.

3101
01:51:35,380 --> 01:51:37,340
A comb, a very visible comb.

3102
01:51:37,340 --> 01:51:38,180
Yes.

3103
01:51:38,180 --> 01:51:41,580
The old, the craziest like chipping plastic.

3104
01:51:41,580 --> 01:51:43,900
A comb, wait, this is like a.

3105
01:51:43,900 --> 01:51:44,780
Oh my gosh.

3106
01:51:44,780 --> 01:51:47,580
Oh, it's a travel toothbrush that says Mickey Mouse

3107
01:51:47,580 --> 01:51:48,660
on the side.

3108
01:51:48,660 --> 01:51:50,500
And he's in a little sailor suit.

3109
01:51:50,500 --> 01:51:52,980
And there's an actual tube of crest as well.

3110
01:51:52,980 --> 01:51:55,660
And then there's like a little weird,

3111
01:51:55,660 --> 01:51:57,580
it's like a little pill container.

3112
01:51:57,580 --> 01:51:59,060
It looks like it's for drugs.

3113
01:51:59,060 --> 01:51:59,900
Wow.

3114
01:51:59,900 --> 01:52:00,740
There's a face on it.

3115
01:52:00,740 --> 01:52:01,580
Wow.

3116
01:52:01,580 --> 01:52:02,420
Oh my gosh.

3117
01:52:02,420 --> 01:52:03,260
We're just talking about pill bottles

3118
01:52:03,260 --> 01:52:04,620
in that Main Street episode.

3119
01:52:04,620 --> 01:52:06,420
Disney pill bottles.

3120
01:52:06,420 --> 01:52:08,980
We gotta line up all this to take a picture at the end.

3121
01:52:08,980 --> 01:52:10,620
You were there in 89, right?

3122
01:52:10,620 --> 01:52:13,140
Yeah, my dad was part of the opening ceremony.

3123
01:52:13,140 --> 01:52:13,980
Geez, wow.

3124
01:52:13,980 --> 01:52:15,700
Which is, it's all on the video on YouTube.

3125
01:52:15,700 --> 01:52:17,860
Like there's a YouTube video of the opening

3126
01:52:17,860 --> 01:52:19,420
that I was looking at that has like,

3127
01:52:19,420 --> 01:52:20,540
Kevin Costner's here.

3128
01:52:20,540 --> 01:52:21,900
Like they just introduce all the people.

3129
01:52:21,900 --> 01:52:24,900
Oh, he's in the roll call of like the limos going up.

3130
01:52:24,900 --> 01:52:26,260
Were you in the limo?

3131
01:52:26,260 --> 01:52:27,300
I must've been, yeah.

3132
01:52:27,300 --> 01:52:28,140
I was little.

3133
01:52:28,140 --> 01:52:29,540
Wow.

3134
01:52:30,380 --> 01:52:32,180
My brother and I were both there.

3135
01:52:32,180 --> 01:52:33,900
And yeah.

3136
01:52:34,780 --> 01:52:35,780
Oh my God.

3137
01:52:35,780 --> 01:52:37,580
Untouched Disney pens.

3138
01:52:37,580 --> 01:52:38,820
Oh my God.

3139
01:52:38,820 --> 01:52:40,340
With every, wow.

3140
01:52:40,340 --> 01:52:42,980
These were, I do remember these.

3141
01:52:42,980 --> 01:52:46,780
With the variety of Mickey's and that 1986 Mickey.

3142
01:52:46,780 --> 01:52:47,620
Oh my God.

3143
01:52:47,620 --> 01:52:48,460
That's our guy, yeah.

3144
01:52:48,460 --> 01:52:49,620
What a winner, that's our Mickey.

3145
01:52:49,620 --> 01:52:50,900
There's three of everything, it's so great.

3146
01:52:50,900 --> 01:52:51,900
Three buttons.

3147
01:52:51,900 --> 01:52:52,900
How is there the NJM thing?

3148
01:52:52,900 --> 01:52:54,580
Wow.

3149
01:52:54,580 --> 01:52:56,300
Three of everything.

3150
01:52:56,300 --> 01:52:57,140
Jason Hamme.

3151
01:52:57,140 --> 01:52:59,660
Geez, this is all, I've never seen a picture

3152
01:52:59,660 --> 01:53:00,860
of one of these items.

3153
01:53:00,860 --> 01:53:02,380
This is all so legit.

3154
01:53:02,380 --> 01:53:03,340
Wow. Wow.

3155
01:53:03,340 --> 01:53:04,460
Some crazy postcards.

3156
01:53:04,460 --> 01:53:05,300
I remember these pens.

3157
01:53:05,300 --> 01:53:06,780
Including a really cool postcard

3158
01:53:06,780 --> 01:53:09,500
of the contemporary from the era.

3159
01:53:09,500 --> 01:53:10,340
Yeah, wow.

3160
01:53:10,340 --> 01:53:12,100
There's just like a bunch of cool postcards.

3161
01:53:12,100 --> 01:53:15,580
There's also just like a flower and a Mickey.

3162
01:53:15,580 --> 01:53:16,420
Ceramics?

3163
01:53:16,420 --> 01:53:17,260
Ceramics. Ceramics.

3164
01:53:17,260 --> 01:53:18,380
Ceramics for us.

3165
01:53:18,380 --> 01:53:19,220
Yes.

3166
01:53:19,220 --> 01:53:20,060
Jeez.

3167
01:53:20,060 --> 01:53:20,900
I don't watch these.

3168
01:53:20,900 --> 01:53:22,380
But then this is, oh yeah.

3169
01:53:22,380 --> 01:53:23,980
And then there's a letter from,

3170
01:53:23,980 --> 01:53:26,900
to my three year old brother from Mickey saying,

3171
01:53:27,660 --> 01:53:30,300
hi Dash, I'll have a safe trip home, your pal Mickey.

3172
01:53:30,300 --> 01:53:31,660
Wow.

3173
01:53:31,660 --> 01:53:33,220
But then here's the absolute.

3174
01:53:33,220 --> 01:53:34,060
We get this.

3175
01:53:34,060 --> 01:53:36,420
He should keep that one from Mickey.

3176
01:53:36,420 --> 01:53:37,660
There's a third ceramic.

3177
01:53:37,660 --> 01:53:39,580
It's a sleepy.

3178
01:53:39,580 --> 01:53:41,820
All right, get it here.

3179
01:53:41,820 --> 01:53:44,420
Jason has claimed the sleepy ceramic,

3180
01:53:44,420 --> 01:53:46,500
which I think we're not gonna argue with.

3181
01:53:46,500 --> 01:53:47,420
No, it's next to me.

3182
01:53:47,420 --> 01:53:49,380
And then this is like the craziest thing.

3183
01:53:49,380 --> 01:53:50,980
Wait, there's a, before I do the crazy thing,

3184
01:53:50,980 --> 01:53:53,340
this is not from that era, but,

3185
01:53:53,340 --> 01:53:54,220
I'll do this last.

3186
01:53:54,220 --> 01:53:58,300
So this is, whoever's spouse can handle this,

3187
01:53:58,300 --> 01:54:01,180
gets to have the Mickey Mouse Club musical mug.

3188
01:54:02,060 --> 01:54:04,700
Scott, will you open this package and take the mug out?

3189
01:54:04,700 --> 01:54:05,540
Whoa.

3190
01:54:05,540 --> 01:54:06,460
But while seated.

3191
01:54:06,460 --> 01:54:08,380
So yeah, it's an old school little box

3192
01:54:08,380 --> 01:54:10,540
that says Mickey Mouse on the magical,

3193
01:54:10,540 --> 01:54:11,380
or musical mug.

3194
01:54:11,380 --> 01:54:12,220
With some name on finger on the name.

3195
01:54:12,220 --> 01:54:13,040
Yeah, okay.

3196
01:54:13,040 --> 01:54:13,880
Mickey Mouse's Club.

3197
01:54:13,880 --> 01:54:14,720
Open the box and lift the mug out.

3198
01:54:14,720 --> 01:54:16,980
Is he gonna get blasted in the face with something?

3199
01:54:16,980 --> 01:54:18,060
Snakes.

3200
01:54:18,060 --> 01:54:18,900
Music, I guess.

3201
01:54:18,900 --> 01:54:19,900
Real snakes.

3202
01:54:20,820 --> 01:54:21,660
Okay.

3203
01:54:25,140 --> 01:54:25,980
It still works.

3204
01:54:25,980 --> 01:54:27,620
Christ, it still works.

3205
01:54:27,620 --> 01:54:30,340
When you lift it up, it plays automatically?

3206
01:54:30,340 --> 01:54:31,180
Yeah.

3207
01:54:31,180 --> 01:54:32,380
And when you put it down, it stops.

3208
01:54:32,380 --> 01:54:34,220
So if you're drinking coffee, it's playing.

3209
01:54:34,220 --> 01:54:36,180
And when you set the coffee down, it stops.

3210
01:54:36,180 --> 01:54:38,100
The merch was so much stronger

3211
01:54:38,100 --> 01:54:39,260
when Michael Eisner was around.

3212
01:54:39,260 --> 01:54:41,860
I know, it's like such Eisner stuff.

3213
01:54:41,860 --> 01:54:43,260
Jeez.

3214
01:54:43,260 --> 01:54:44,740
Oh my God, Eva.

3215
01:54:44,740 --> 01:54:45,580
Wow.

3216
01:54:45,580 --> 01:54:47,500
I, thank you so much.

3217
01:54:47,500 --> 01:54:49,260
This is like a time capsule was.

3218
01:54:49,260 --> 01:54:50,100
It really felt like a time,

3219
01:54:50,100 --> 01:54:52,060
it was like a 1989 time capsule, it's crazy.

3220
01:54:52,060 --> 01:54:52,900
Oh my God.

3221
01:54:52,900 --> 01:54:53,740
And Dashill, thank you so much.

3222
01:54:53,740 --> 01:54:54,580
Yeah, thank you sir.

3223
01:54:54,580 --> 01:54:56,420
I was like, you have to take this to the pub.

3224
01:54:56,420 --> 01:54:57,820
Solid dude, that Dashill is.

3225
01:54:57,820 --> 01:54:58,660
He's a solid dude.

3226
01:54:58,660 --> 01:54:59,500
Solid dude.

3227
01:54:59,500 --> 01:55:01,060
And then I just felt like Jason has to have this

3228
01:55:01,060 --> 01:55:01,900
even though it's not for a 1989.

3229
01:55:01,900 --> 01:55:03,420
What do we got, what do we got?

3230
01:55:04,380 --> 01:55:07,140
Here, it's a 50th.

3231
01:55:07,140 --> 01:55:12,140
It's an Annie mug from Oval Teen's golden Annieversary.

3232
01:55:12,220 --> 01:55:15,260
Oh my God, Oval Teen is celebrating the anniversary of Annie?

3233
01:55:15,260 --> 01:55:16,580
Yeah.

3234
01:55:16,580 --> 01:55:17,660
You mean Orphan Annie?

3235
01:55:17,660 --> 01:55:18,500
Yeah.

3236
01:55:18,500 --> 01:55:19,820
Yeah, the comic strip doodle.

3237
01:55:19,820 --> 01:55:22,540
Oval Teen, the like milk, the chocolate milk.

3238
01:55:22,540 --> 01:55:23,380
I think that's older.

3239
01:55:24,220 --> 01:55:26,580
Oval Teen is, you mix it into chocolate,

3240
01:55:26,580 --> 01:55:27,580
we look to make chocolate milk.

3241
01:55:27,580 --> 01:55:28,980
Yes, no, no, no, I know Oval Teen,

3242
01:55:28,980 --> 01:55:31,500
but this is why are they celebrating an Annieversary?

3243
01:55:31,500 --> 01:55:32,860
Oh yeah, it's in the bag too.

3244
01:55:32,860 --> 01:55:35,220
Yeah, was Oval Teen an original sponsor of Annie

3245
01:55:35,220 --> 01:55:36,060
or something, do we know?

3246
01:55:36,060 --> 01:55:37,740
I mean, Oval Teen is like the sponsor,

3247
01:55:37,740 --> 01:55:42,580
isn't it the sponsor in the Christmas story?

3248
01:55:42,580 --> 01:55:45,020
Like it's like don't you ever have to drink your Oval Teen.

3249
01:55:45,020 --> 01:55:46,700
They sponsor a lot.

3250
01:55:46,700 --> 01:55:47,940
Yeah, just chocolate milk.

3251
01:55:47,940 --> 01:55:48,980
Yeah. Wow.

3252
01:55:48,980 --> 01:55:51,060
So guys, that was my surprise for y'all.

3253
01:55:51,060 --> 01:55:51,900
Oh my God.

3254
01:55:51,900 --> 01:55:53,100
Thank you so much.

3255
01:55:53,100 --> 01:55:54,580
How was there three of everything?

3256
01:55:54,580 --> 01:55:55,420
That's amazing.

3257
01:55:55,420 --> 01:55:56,260
This is insane.

3258
01:55:56,260 --> 01:55:58,020
It was like, this is so crazy.

3259
01:55:58,020 --> 01:56:00,300
The past gave a gift to us.

3260
01:56:00,300 --> 01:56:01,140
Yeah, that is.

3261
01:56:01,140 --> 01:56:01,980
This is so nuts.

3262
01:56:01,980 --> 01:56:03,820
That's some weird time traveler shit.

3263
01:56:03,820 --> 01:56:04,660
Yeah.

3264
01:56:04,660 --> 01:56:06,300
Oh my God, okay.

3265
01:56:06,300 --> 01:56:07,780
Sealed in a hoarder closet.

3266
01:56:07,780 --> 01:56:10,020
Well, as if there was any question

3267
01:56:10,020 --> 01:56:11,860
about the right decision being made

3268
01:56:11,860 --> 01:56:15,820
for the first audience selected Club 3 episode.

3269
01:56:15,820 --> 01:56:19,580
Oh my God, what an epic celebration.

3270
01:56:19,580 --> 01:56:21,660
Eva Anderson, you survived.

3271
01:56:21,700 --> 01:56:23,980
You survived Club 3.

3272
01:56:23,980 --> 01:56:25,500
You made it all the way down.

3273
01:56:25,500 --> 01:56:29,500
So nice and committed to this podcast.

3274
01:56:29,500 --> 01:56:32,500
You made it all the way to the lowest rung.

3275
01:56:32,500 --> 01:56:33,980
You've come all the way with like,

3276
01:56:33,980 --> 01:56:36,700
spend more time on the second gate than any other guest.

3277
01:56:36,700 --> 01:56:39,780
Now you're club, you're maybe the only guest in Club 3.

3278
01:56:39,780 --> 01:56:40,620
Oh man.

3279
01:56:40,620 --> 01:56:41,460
This is wonderful.

3280
01:56:41,460 --> 01:56:43,100
I'm so grateful. Thank you very much.

3281
01:56:43,100 --> 01:56:45,420
Grateful to the fans, the listeners.

3282
01:56:45,420 --> 01:56:47,180
Thanks so much for having me.

3283
01:56:47,180 --> 01:56:50,380
Thank you guys for participating in themed car washes.

3284
01:56:50,380 --> 01:56:51,220
Of course, yeah.

3285
01:56:51,660 --> 01:56:52,500
Thank you for bringing us.

3286
01:56:52,500 --> 01:56:54,780
I can't, then you gave present.

3287
01:56:54,780 --> 01:56:56,780
Look, you saved my marriage.

3288
01:56:58,460 --> 01:57:00,860
Obviously, obviously on the fritz.

3289
01:57:02,340 --> 01:57:04,700
Yeah, but nothing, but that mug is gonna test it.

3290
01:57:04,700 --> 01:57:06,620
I know, I was like, whoever gets the mug,

3291
01:57:06,620 --> 01:57:08,060
it's gonna be wild.

3292
01:57:08,060 --> 01:57:09,660
Good thing you guys got all that energy

3293
01:57:09,660 --> 01:57:10,940
from that little jaunt.

3294
01:57:11,900 --> 01:57:12,740
The mug's gonna break it.

3295
01:57:12,740 --> 01:57:14,140
This is gonna test all of it.

3296
01:57:14,140 --> 01:57:16,860
That gave it another six months.

3297
01:57:16,860 --> 01:57:20,180
It's either the mug or the assorted items of plastic

3298
01:57:20,180 --> 01:57:22,140
that are breaking down.

3299
01:57:22,140 --> 01:57:22,980
Oh, uh-huh, uh-huh.

3300
01:57:22,980 --> 01:57:24,260
Oh yeah, no, they're, yeah, they're.

3301
01:57:24,260 --> 01:57:26,540
Will Jason brush with the crest tonight?

3302
01:57:26,540 --> 01:57:28,380
Oh, we do brush.

3303
01:57:28,380 --> 01:57:30,180
I hear someone's gonna open the crest.

3304
01:57:30,180 --> 01:57:31,020
It's so good.

3305
01:57:31,020 --> 01:57:31,860
30 year old crest.

3306
01:57:31,860 --> 01:57:34,700
I don't know what consistency that ends up with.

3307
01:57:34,700 --> 01:57:35,540
Maybe better.

3308
01:57:35,540 --> 01:57:37,420
Well, we're the ones exiting through the gift shop,

3309
01:57:37,420 --> 01:57:39,020
but would you like to as well?

3310
01:57:39,020 --> 01:57:40,380
Is there anything you'd like to plug?

3311
01:57:40,380 --> 01:57:41,660
I got no plugs.

3312
01:57:41,660 --> 01:57:43,900
Go to a themed car wash, live your life.

3313
01:57:43,900 --> 01:57:45,100
Okay. Yeah.

3314
01:57:45,100 --> 01:57:46,660
Well, you know, Wee Crash is still up,

3315
01:57:46,660 --> 01:57:47,660
and I don't think I've gotten to say to you,

3316
01:57:47,660 --> 01:57:49,060
I liked Wee Crash so much.

3317
01:57:49,060 --> 01:57:49,900
Oh, thank you.

3318
01:57:50,660 --> 01:57:51,860
Yeah, check out, it was great work on Wee Crash.

3319
01:57:51,860 --> 01:57:53,260
So I'll plug that for you.

3320
01:57:53,260 --> 01:57:54,220
Thanks, man.

3321
01:57:54,220 --> 01:57:57,020
And audience, you survived the first Club 3

3322
01:57:57,020 --> 01:58:02,020
that you selected, the moment of intimacy,

3323
01:58:02,420 --> 01:58:04,300
your bravery saved the podcast.

3324
01:58:04,300 --> 01:58:06,300
Well done, Freedom Fighters.

3325
01:58:06,300 --> 01:58:08,460
And truly thank you for subscribing to Club 3.

3326
01:58:08,460 --> 01:58:13,460
You're keeping this old Delta Queen river boat afloat.

3327
01:58:14,140 --> 01:58:15,660
So thank you so much.

3328
01:58:15,660 --> 01:58:17,140
Don't forget to vote in the comments

3329
01:58:17,140 --> 01:58:19,540
for next month's episode.

3330
01:58:20,180 --> 01:58:21,860
And if you just say, do this again with Eva,

3331
01:58:21,860 --> 01:58:23,740
we would totally understand.

3332
01:58:24,620 --> 01:58:27,700
Watch Butter on streaming services.

3333
01:58:27,700 --> 01:58:28,660
Watch Butter.

3334
01:58:28,660 --> 01:58:31,220
And I just want to throw out there's a YouTube video.

3335
01:58:31,220 --> 01:58:32,740
You don't have to suggest it for next month,

3336
01:58:32,740 --> 01:58:35,660
but just Google search YouTube Liberace,

3337
01:58:35,660 --> 01:58:37,100
send in the clowns medley.

3338
01:58:37,100 --> 01:58:39,860
That's all I'll say.

3339
01:58:39,860 --> 01:58:42,060
I think we are allowed to, we can juice the,

3340
01:58:42,060 --> 01:58:45,500
we can try to like get our plugs in for what we want.

3341
01:58:45,500 --> 01:58:46,380
We can campaign for sure.

3342
01:58:46,380 --> 01:58:50,260
I mean, just seeing that the video of the MGM grand opening

3343
01:58:50,260 --> 01:58:52,740
with just a parade of stars coming out of limos

3344
01:58:52,740 --> 01:58:54,380
certainly sounds intriguing.

3345
01:58:55,340 --> 01:58:56,660
But it's up to you, the listener.

3346
01:58:56,660 --> 01:58:57,500
It's up to you.

3347
01:58:57,500 --> 01:59:01,460
You decide and we, yeah, we will so willingly watch Butter.

3348
01:59:01,460 --> 01:59:02,300
Yes.

3349
01:59:04,740 --> 01:59:06,580
I'm sorry, spoiled Butter dies.
