1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:22,800
Up, up and away.

3
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,800
That's what I was gonna say.

4
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,040
Welcome to podcast there.

5
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:26,120
Hey, all right.

6
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:26,960
Wow.

7
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,720
While we both, that we're debating who,

8
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,080
if either of us had something and the answer is

9
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,840
both of us had a half something.

10
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:33,680
Wow.

11
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:34,960
It was up, up and away.

12
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,120
Cause today we're boarding the Mickey Mouse balloon

13
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,680
on podcast, The Ride, The Second Gate.

14
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,020
I'm Scott Gardner.

15
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:46,280
Mike Carlson was thinking the same thing as me.

16
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,040
We were having a standoff of who would say

17
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:53,320
the not thought out, non joke intro to the show.

18
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,060
And we both had the same thought.

19
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:55,900
So yes, I'm here.

20
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:56,740
What is it?

21
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:58,400
When we do things like that, it's not a joke.

22
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:01,560
It's just like, it's the most you would ever want is like,

23
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,560
that's nice.

24
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,120
That's nice that they said that.

25
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:04,960
A nod.

26
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:05,780
Oh.

27
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:06,620
A nice little introduction.

28
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:09,120
Oh, I saw that the, I saw the title of the episode.

29
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:12,040
And now yes, I see how that could play into that.

30
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:12,960
Yes.

31
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,080
Maybe like my mom would hear that and go, ha ha ha.

32
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:20,880
Maybe that she might laugh at up, up and away.

33
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,320
This is, yeah, this is the episode where you can play

34
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:25,640
a couple seconds of it for her.

35
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,480
Finally.

36
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,640
This is gonna be the rare snippet.

37
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,520
These are Jason, Jason Sheridan.

38
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,320
Hey, we don't, don't, don't, don't,

39
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,240
we didn't forget about you.

40
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,720
You're coming up up and away with us.

41
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:36,640
What would you have said, Jason?

42
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,480
Oh, thanks.

43
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,200
If we made you do it.

44
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,600
Probably something nasty.

45
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,800
Probably something not suitable for our moms.

46
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,760
Oh yeah, okay.

47
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,440
You would have said, yeah, you would have.

48
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:48,280
Some real crude, like yeah, nasty stuff

49
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,320
about balloons or something.

50
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,120
Let's get this fucking balloon fucking shit started.

51
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:54,960
These guys.

52
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:55,800
You fucking dicks.

53
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,080
You fucking listeners.

54
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:57,920
Yeah.

55
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,600
That's what you would have said.

56
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,200
That might have been the most I've sworn on the show ever.

57
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,040
Yeah, really?

58
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:03,880
Or just accidentally.

59
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:06,360
I think that little bit might be, I apologize,

60
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,560
but it's the second gate.

61
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,080
Oh well, so immediately now, my mom can't hear it.

62
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,520
Sorry. Shut it off, mom.

63
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,000
Sorry. Yeah, that's all right.

64
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,160
I assure you Mike's not usually like this

65
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,600
and in fact is very apologetic most of the time.

66
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,960
I am, yes, and I was playing,

67
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,720
I was playing a character just now.

68
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,840
Ha ha ha.

69
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,680
Wasn't me.

70
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,560
Ah, history's best excuse.

71
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,360
Yeah, I was in character, everyone.

72
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,520
Get off my back.

73
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,560
Now I'm back to being normal.

74
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,200
Just blame anything that the audience

75
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,440
doesn't like on a character.

76
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,280
Yeah.

77
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,120
On a character, yeah.

78
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,800
I was a character for the whole living with the land episode.

79
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,640
I of course love the ride.

80
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,840
I love the boat ride.

81
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:53,080
Hey, today we are talking about Ear Force One

82
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,520
and what is Ear Force One?

83
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:58,640
Ear Force One was a Mickey Mouse hot air balloon

84
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,680
and you might wonder if you have seen this before

85
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,600
and I assure you that you have.

86
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,680
If you ever saw Disney World,

87
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:11,000
maybe Disneyland promotional materials in the 80s and 90s,

88
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,720
I feel like this balloon was omnipresent.

89
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,520
It was like a way for them to kick it up a notch.

90
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,600
If it's not enough to just show a sweeping aerial view

91
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,960
of a massive theme park complex,

92
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,000
well, look at this.

93
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,720
We also got a Mickey Mouse head floating around in the sky.

94
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,360
This is a grand place.

95
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,640
You gotta come.

96
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,040
Yeah, this was, it's funny

97
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,360
because I do think that's what it conveys to children.

98
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:41,160
I never was like, I wanna get in this balloon,

99
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:44,160
but I was like, whoa, Mickey's in the sky.

100
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:47,320
It's like the bat, it was like a bat signal for me

101
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,760
saying come to Disney World.

102
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,800
Absolutely, they took over the air too.

103
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:56,280
Yeah, it was a 10 story tall balloon

104
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:01,280
made for the 15th anniversary of Walt Disney World in 1986

105
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,880
and they just got years of footage for openings

106
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:10,680
of specials and the vacation VHSs you would mail away from.

107
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,400
They got years of footage out of it.

108
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:17,160
Yeah, and it's still, does it still, they use it today?

109
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,840
Is that what I read?

110
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,840
I don't know the lifespan of a hot air balloon.

111
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:26,640
I see in 2013 they were still using it here and there.

112
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,400
I maybe saw something as recently as 2015.

113
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:34,400
I think it's rare and I think that it does not live

114
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,040
on Disney property anymore.

115
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:42,040
It seems to be in Idaho in a storage space for balloons.

116
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,040
Right.

117
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,480
Good place to store a balloon.

118
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:47,800
Obviously we all read a lot about Cameron Balloons.

119
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,640
Yes.

120
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:51,280
The maker of this balloon.

121
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:55,520
We did, Cameron Balloons in England,

122
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:00,520
they made this, Imagineers not hot air balloon experts.

123
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,240
They do have to outsource things that they want.

124
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,080
Right.

125
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:11,120
Yeah, Cameron Balloons and they not only made this,

126
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:16,120
the Air Force One, but also, I mean,

127
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:20,200
a bunch of shapes for Disney, which we can get to,

128
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,760
to give those all their due, but I also just wanted

129
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:26,200
to run through other things that that balloon company made.

130
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,040
Oh, yeah, yeah.

131
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:27,880
Oh, please, yeah.

132
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:28,700
Let me share this.

133
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:29,540
I looked on their website.

134
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:31,960
Yes, I was doing a lot of work on the website.

135
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:32,800
Oh yeah, here we go.

136
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,720
Oh, okay, okay.

137
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,000
Well, we have some of the same things.

138
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,880
These are just the ones that jumped out at me a lot.

139
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,880
This is a Whopper, it's a Whopper hot air balloon

140
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,040
for Burger King.

141
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:47,040
This is a big Vincent van Gogh done in his style

142
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,620
and his painted style and with a hat.

143
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,360
You got, now this one's not a shape.

144
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,480
It's just a little, a little racy, a little body.

145
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:00,760
Again, I don't know if, now we're back to apologetic

146
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,820
territory. Jason, okay.

147
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,280
Let me say this.

148
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,780
The hot air balloon is a picture of a woman in a bra

149
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:08,940
and it's for Wonder Bra and it says, hello boys.

150
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:13,900
And Jason on the Zoom did maybe my favorite emotion

151
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:14,860
he's ever done.

152
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:18,020
He leaned in like real close to his computer

153
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:21,540
and adjusted his glasses like an older gentleman.

154
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:23,460
Like an older, well I couldn't.

155
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:25,740
Like, is that, like is that real?

156
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:28,140
I couldn't read the text at the bottom

157
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:30,980
because it's kind of folded over and it reads,

158
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:33,240
the one and only Wonder Bra.

159
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:38,560
I mean, he didn't do a classic 80s push the glasses down

160
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,120
to see a lady walking by move,

161
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,700
but he definitely did the like old man

162
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:47,240
who's a little flustered by the image he's seeing.

163
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,320
And I don't think the glass is fogged

164
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,160
as far as I could tell.

165
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:54,280
I couldn't tell, but the camera quality isn't so good.

166
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,040
I think there could have been partial fogging

167
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,080
in the glasses.

168
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,680
Could have been partial foggy.

169
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,400
Not sure, but there's possible is what I'm saying.

170
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,120
Hello boys, it says.

171
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,640
We're all staring at a picture of a woman in a bra.

172
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:09,040
Boy, this is the most inappropriate

173
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,520
podcast right episode yet.

174
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,840
I better keep moving.

175
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,800
This is too scandalous.

176
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,880
Cause then we get to my favorite one.

177
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,200
Yeah.

178
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,200
This is more our speed.

179
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,320
It's Sugar Bear.

180
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,160
Yeah, of course it is.

181
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,680
This is a hot air balloon of Sugar Bear.

182
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:27,480
Now what's, I know Sugar Bear,

183
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,440
but what cereal is Sugar Bear on?

184
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,760
Why can't I think of the name of it?

185
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,600
I've had it, Scott have you not had it?

186
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,920
Do you know?

187
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,400
I think it might be on the list too.

188
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,160
I liked the character, but I haven't had this cereal.

189
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:43,040
You know Sugar Bear, he's got like mellow eyes.

190
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:46,800
He looks like a little stoned or something.

191
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,000
He's a sleepy, he's a very casual bear.

192
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,040
He is Golden Crisp.

193
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,760
Oh.

194
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,600
Yes.

195
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,440
And it used to be called Super,

196
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,320
they had a Super Golden Crisp as well.

197
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,920
Super Sugar Crisp was an earlier name too.

198
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,680
Right, yes.

199
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,960
And they were like, it's like a Honey Smacks.

200
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,760
Yes.

201
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,200
It's like similar to that.

202
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,360
That was the Frog.

203
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,160
Sugar Smacks, right?

204
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,520
Yes, and yeah, what's the Frog's name?

205
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,120
Smacks, isn't it?

206
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,960
Oh, Frog's name is Smacks.

207
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:19,800
You might be right.

208
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,640
Yeah, that seems right.

209
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,460
Is it Frog?

210
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:22,300
Yeah, I think so.

211
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,440
What was the personality of Sugar Bear?

212
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:29,120
I mean, as I said, he looks very mellow and easygoing.

213
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:29,960
Genial?

214
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,440
Yeah.

215
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,280
Right?

216
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,520
I think that's correct.

217
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,560
General guy, I guess, is what he was.

218
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,800
And then, well, if you were on the website,

219
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,440
then I'm sure you also gravitated to this.

220
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,900
It's an Independence Day ship, the big destroyer ship

221
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,320
that was above all the cities.

222
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,000
They made an inflatable one of these

223
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,440
with a little basket at the bottom.

224
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,400
I mean, this is great.

225
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,240
Yeah, I love.

226
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,360
I would have flipped out if this was above my city.

227
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,200
I love this.

228
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,960
I mean, yeah, I've never seen this.

229
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,400
They should have flown this everywhere.

230
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:03,000
We were all, had an Independence Day fever

231
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,720
at the time, I think, right?

232
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,560
Oh yeah.

233
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,400
I love this.

234
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,220
Oh, certainly.

235
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:09,160
Yeah, so if I saw this, I would have been a little,

236
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,280
honestly a little scared too.

237
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,120
It would have been so big.

238
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,360
It would have been real.

239
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,200
I was freaked out coming out of Independence Day

240
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,120
a little bit too.

241
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,160
Yeah.

242
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:18,980
Rattled.

243
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:20,600
I was like, yeah, maybe, maybe.

244
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,720
Maybe this is coming.

245
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:27,220
Well, in the theme park tangentially related world,

246
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:29,360
I came across another one they did.

247
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:35,360
The inflatable me, the big minion.

248
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:36,720
Yes.

249
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,920
Hashtag spot Stewart.

250
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,760
It was called inflatable me.

251
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:43,600
I saw it called inflatable me, at least in,

252
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,840
I think I saw it first in a Daily Mail roundup

253
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:50,200
about the company and all their novel balloons they had made.

254
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,200
Not an inflatable Jason Sheridan.

255
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,040
No.

256
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:57,120
Oh, Cameron balloons.

257
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:57,960
Come on.

258
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,200
Come on, Cameron.

259
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,240
Make our dreams come true.

260
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:07,440
Yeah, will they make us a hot air balloon on spec?

261
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,600
Please, yes.

262
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,440
Please.

263
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,040
I mean, at least tell us how to do it.

264
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:15,000
They're like, they're the kings of these type of balloons.

265
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,820
It looks like.

266
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:20,080
I didn't do a ton of outside other balloon company research.

267
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,320
They have, if you look at their, they also have,

268
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,080
did you see the Ultraman they have?

269
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,160
They made-

270
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:26,980
Yeah, yeah, I caught that.

271
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:28,720
That's very cool.

272
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,640
They make, they call that fabric engineering,

273
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,880
which I think is more like

274
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,740
when they're not making a traditional balloon,

275
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:39,080
when it's like, yeah, and like it's in the shape of a man.

276
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,120
Then they have Cameron Classics,

277
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,960
which are your classic hot air balloons, which I like.

278
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,280
I like the name there.

279
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,600
Cameron Classic.

280
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,980
And then they also have extreme ballooning.

281
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,920
What's extreme ballooning?

282
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,040
Well, it's kind of unclear.

283
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:58,120
I mean, sometimes you see videos of like two hot air balloons

284
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:01,840
and then like a rope and somebody tries to like walk across.

285
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,440
And then there's also like balloons.

286
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:07,760
I think they can just go higher into the atmosphere

287
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,500
than like your standard hot air balloon,

288
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,120
which I don't think gets very high usually.

289
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,880
I mean, it's high for a human being off the ground,

290
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,140
but it's not like very, very high.

291
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:19,600
I think, I think it's like, I don't,

292
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,400
I don't have the numbers here, but it's like, it can last.

293
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,500
The balloon is like tougher.

294
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,240
It can last higher up in the atmosphere.

295
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:30,400
The point of it is to get, ascend and ascend and ascend.

296
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,240
Yeah.

297
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,440
Do not just float kind of above places

298
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,120
and promote a movie or a theme park.

299
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:35,960
Right.

300
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,080
I mean, I think there definitely should be

301
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,040
some sort of Mission Impossible stunt

302
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,880
that involves extreme ballooning.

303
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,120
I think that may be the missing thing.

304
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,960
It is surprising there hasn't been.

305
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,800
And then yes.

306
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,560
What's your guys feeling about hot air balloons in general?

307
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,560
Have you been in one?

308
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,520
Do you wish to go in one?

309
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,240
Oh, I would love to have given the chance.

310
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:00,400
Yeah, I would jump at the chance of that for sure.

311
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:05,400
I, I think we've, if it was for the show,

312
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,840
I will probably force myself to do it,

313
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:13,040
but I do not want to get in a hot air balloon.

314
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,280
It's too much.

315
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,600
It feels too fragile to me.

316
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,980
There's not enough around me in the sky.

317
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:22,360
I do not want to do it.

318
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:25,160
Well, it seems like the extension of you not liking,

319
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:29,680
heights, drop rides, not like tower guardians,

320
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,640
but yeah, you're more, you got limbs dangling around.

321
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,640
Limbs dangling.

322
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,200
It just feels like somebody's going to push me

323
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,000
out of the basket as a gag.

324
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,960
Like I'm going to go flying out of there.

325
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,040
I will also say, and I've said,

326
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,400
I've mentioned this before on the show,

327
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,080
when they would put a hot air balloon,

328
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,000
like the hot air balloon shape,

329
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,660
a car dealership would be promoting something.

330
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:54,160
You know, they put a hot air balloon or something was new.

331
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,080
I was freaked out by these as a kid.

332
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,120
Oh, right.

333
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,320
Well, do you count a big gorilla,

334
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,800
which scared you as a child as this?

335
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,440
Is this the same genre?

336
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,280
I think it is.

337
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,840
They're certainly related.

338
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:10,440
I think it is because I would see that.

339
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:13,720
I remember one, I remember some of these moments in my brain.

340
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:17,160
Like we were driving by then the Rosemont Horizon,

341
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:20,380
now the Allstate Arena, which boring, worst name,

342
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:22,540
but there was like,

343
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:24,620
I think it was some sort of a car dealership that was open

344
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:28,700
and they had like eight balloons along the expressway.

345
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,900
And they had like an animal, a couple animals,

346
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:33,260
and then a couple standard looking hot air balloons.

347
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:34,500
And I remember just kind of like,

348
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,740
I had to look the other way.

349
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:37,420
I remember being in the back seat of the car

350
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:39,540
and like looking the other way on the expressway.

351
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:41,340
We weren't even that close to it,

352
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:43,360
but like the idea of it freaked me out.

353
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:45,700
And then-

354
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,900
You know, like sugar bears smiling at you.

355
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:51,040
If it was one of my friends from cereal,

356
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,040
I might've been less scared,

357
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,840
but I don't believe I ever saw any cereal mascots

358
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,980
as balloons.

359
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:59,960
One of your breakfast confidants.

360
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,600
Childhood breakfast confidants.

361
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,440
That's right.

362
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,880
They knew all my secrets as a child.

363
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:05,960
That's right.

364
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:09,520
Like the cookie crisp dog I would confess to.

365
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:13,080
They knew the secret of why you start at school

366
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,520
feeling like shit after your breakfast

367
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,980
was a bowl of cookie crisps

368
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:19,800
and a massive glass of orange juice.

369
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:24,400
I will say cookie crisp was too far for my mom.

370
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,000
That was too sugary.

371
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,200
So we were not allowed to have cookie crisp.

372
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,100
Did you ever have cookie checks?

373
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:32,960
No.

374
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,420
Cookie checks was sweetened checks

375
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:36,960
with just chunks of like butter cookie in it.

376
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:41,840
And I still regret not stocking up on it

377
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:42,880
when I was a teenager,

378
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,000
because it belongs to the ages now.

379
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,440
Putting it in cold storage.

380
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:49,000
Putting it in cold storage, yeah.

381
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,000
And then you like break it out for like celebrations.

382
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,640
Like an old bottle of wine,

383
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:58,200
you have a cookie check small box.

384
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,440
You got a little vintage here.

385
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,400
Getting it, shaking it in your hand.

386
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,760
Cask of Amontillado,

387
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,640
I get lured down to a basement.

388
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,600
My climate controlled cellar.

389
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,080
Yeah.

390
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:10,920
Where is it?

391
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,140
Let me out.

392
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:13,900
Vintage cereal.

393
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:14,880
Although yeah, you would,

394
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,360
I mean, you should write a story

395
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:20,600
about getting locked in a climate controlled cask

396
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,640
full of cereal.

397
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,120
Yeah.

398
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,600
That's pretty good.

399
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:29,240
I don't want to just to not have an error sitting there.

400
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:32,840
I was curious and the character from Smacks

401
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:35,360
is in fact called Digum Frog.

402
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,400
Oh, Digum.

403
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,840
Okay.

404
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:40,980
I feel very stupid because I know Digum.

405
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,200
I know the name Digum.

406
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,720
I feel very silly.

407
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,560
Thank you.

408
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,080
I don't, I didn't.

409
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,240
And now of course I'm upset because I discovered

410
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,960
that the original mascot was yet another awful clown.

411
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,400
It is Cliffy the Clown.

412
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,280
Oh God.

413
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,120
Cliffy.

414
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,320
Back when it was Sugar Smacks.

415
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,640
All right, this episode topic has changed.

416
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,960
It is now entirely about Cliffy.

417
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:03,800
Scott's gotta be-

418
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,560
You know what's something I want to say is that,

419
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,400
oh, what was that?

420
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,000
I was gonna say Scott's gonna be hopping into Air Force One

421
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,040
to slowly escape Cliffy.

422
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,520
Oh God.

423
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:17,680
Now I'm gonna be worried Cliffy is hiding in there.

424
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:23,120
I'm not typically afraid of clowns.

425
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,920
I'm not even sure that that's my reaction to

426
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,000
these clowns that keep coming up.

427
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,360
It's not, I think like,

428
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,440
not like any clown freaks me out,

429
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:35,800
but the specific ones that we are discussing.

430
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,880
And here's Cliffy.

431
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,800
I'm looking at him now.

432
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:40,840
Oh, you're looking, okay, good.

433
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:43,600
My mouse stopped working so I can't show you the screen.

434
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,400
Wait, which means he's stuck on my computer.

435
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,880
Oh God.

436
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,120
I better charge this thing

437
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,520
or I'm gonna be staring at Cliffy for a while.

438
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,960
Yeah, Cliffy's weird.

439
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,600
He looks very old, doesn't he?

440
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,760
Is this, were you talking about this picture right here?

441
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:06,520
Yeah, well, I don't like that cartoon one, the marionette.

442
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,880
Oh yeah, Cliffy, yeah.

443
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,280
Yeah.

444
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,760
They standed real weird.

445
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,600
What does he look like?

446
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,120
He looks like Ed Koch or something.

447
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:18,480
Cliffy, wait, here, here.

448
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,320
Is this Cliffy too?

449
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:20,880
He looks different on this box.

450
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:25,280
Wait, why is Sugar Smacks selling a gun?

451
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,920
This is the cereal with a clown on the cover

452
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,760
you can send back for a gun?

453
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,840
Famous American rifle.

454
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:36,080
Famous American rifle, free inside.

455
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,760
Yeah, you could get a rifle with your cereal back in the day.

456
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,560
Yeah, that was the default toy.

457
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,640
It was teddy bear or a gun.

458
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,560
This, yeah, I mean, you gotta know

459
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,880
why the country is the way it is

460
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,280
and you take a look at this and you go, oh, I get it.

461
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,880
Buy a rifle with your clown cereal.

462
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:59,480
Anyway, look, I think that there are clowns

463
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,720
who do not and would not bother me,

464
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:05,560
but Choco bothers me, Cliffy bothers me.

465
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,320
Look at this.

466
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,760
Whoa.

467
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,600
This is a nightmare clown.

468
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,680
He's got a tiny straw hat

469
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,600
with a big feather exploding out of it.

470
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,480
That seems to be his primary hat.

471
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,280
He's also kind of a conehead.

472
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,240
I don't like this Sugar Crinkles clown either.

473
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,240
He's terrible.

474
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,080
Yeah, look at this.

475
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,760
There's another free squirt gun inside

476
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,720
and this just looks like a.

477
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,560
It's a derriger.

478
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,640
It's extremely realistic.

479
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:32,320
Why does a squirt gun have to be black?

480
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,440
It could be a fun color.

481
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,720
To send a message.

482
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,160
Wait, Cliffy.

483
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,800
This is not the same Cliffy as this.

484
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,280
No, sometimes Cliffy is a conehead

485
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,960
and sometimes he's just like a scary uncle.

486
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,080
That's Ed Koch Cliffy.

487
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,400
Yeah.

488
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,480
But then this is a different one too.

489
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:57,640
Were there multiple clowns that advertised sugar specks?

490
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,800
They can't decide what Cliffy looks like.

491
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:02,280
They can't decide what their cereal is called.

492
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,240
This is just a woman.

493
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,040
Just some lady.

494
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,360
She from Superman maybe?

495
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,840
This is promoting Superman.

496
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,840
Oh, look at that dog thing.

497
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:12,680
Look at that creature.

498
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,520
Look at this.

499
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,520
This is Honey Smacks then.

500
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,520
That looks like the mask for The Shining

501
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,200
where she looks in the hotel room.

502
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,480
He's a banana split.

503
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,320
Yeah, yeah, that's a banana split.

504
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,360
Oh, it's a banana split.

505
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,200
Yeah.

506
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,440
Spock is on the cover here too.

507
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:28,560
And sometimes the mascot was Quick Draw McGraw

508
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:31,040
who is just not from cereal.

509
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,640
It's a Hano Barbera character.

510
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,480
Huh.

511
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,320
Well, we have-

512
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,040
Max is all over the map.

513
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,880
We have another, we have more to do

514
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,720
with the eventual Choco episode,

515
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,440
adding Cliffy to the pile.

516
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,040
No, one clown at a time, please.

517
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,400
Cliffy.

518
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,560
I think maybe we should just collect clowns

519
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,640
and then we feel we have enough.

520
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,080
Then that's when we do the episode.

521
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,160
There's already enough.

522
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,640
There was enough before Choco.

523
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:01,840
Oh, wait, Mary and Cliffy.

524
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:02,680
Who's Mary?

525
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:06,080
Don't buy a marionette of Cliffy

526
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,560
and do anything to me with it.

527
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,960
It's gonna be too expensive.

528
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:10,920
It's from the 50s.

529
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:14,120
It's not gonna be worth whatever it did

530
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,400
and whatever happens.

531
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,600
You're acting like we don't have a couple marionettes

532
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,920
already sitting around.

533
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,080
Don't worry.

534
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,400
Marionette right over here.

535
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,800
A little creepy boy.

536
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:26,200
Don't combine clowns then with ventriloquist dummies

537
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,280
and scary puppet stuff.

538
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:29,800
All right, fine.

539
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,640
That's enough as it is.

540
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,040
Ear Force One, I guess.

541
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,080
No more clowns.

542
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:38,200
Now I can't, God, we've had this runner about Choco

543
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,680
haunting me and being inside me

544
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:46,120
and now possessing me.

545
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,840
And now I think the spirit of Cliffy the Clown

546
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:51,000
has possessed my computer

547
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,520
because I can't look at my notes about Ear Force One

548
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,680
because my mouse stopped working

549
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,760
and I can only look at Cliffy the Clown.

550
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,840
Cliffy is now living with you basically.

551
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,920
It's like starting to work.

552
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,080
I'm inching my mouse.

553
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,120
Okay, got it.

554
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:07,960
Okay.

555
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:11,920
Uh-oh, Cliffy has turned off the command tab shortcut.

556
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,240
Uh-oh, you're stuck on Cliffy.

557
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,520
Cliffy is reformatting your hard drive.

558
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:19,640
Uh-oh.

559
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:24,120
Every photo of my baby is now a photo of Cliffy the Clown.

560
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:26,080
Cliffy loves disk utility.

561
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,960
Cliffy loves disk utility.

562
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,320
That's his favorite program to use.

563
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,720
Oh, he's partitioning your drives now.

564
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,560
Uh-oh.

565
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,960
Cliffy the Defrag Clown.

566
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,840
Cliffy the Defrag Clown.

567
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,320
Oh, Cliffy is photoshopping you into the basket

568
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:44,840
of the more problematic named Zippity Doo Duck.

569
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,120
You're right, that's a good way to get back on track

570
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,480
and away from clowns.

571
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,280
There was also a balloon of Donald Duck.

572
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:58,240
After the smash success of the Mickey Mouse hot air balloon,

573
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,200
and I gauged success by it existing and being photographed,

574
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,440
smash success.

575
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:07,240
So the next year they introduced a big Donald Duck head

576
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,880
as the Zippity Doo Duck.

577
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,040
Right. Yeah.

578
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:12,240
Name is kind of perplexing.

579
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,840
Donald did not have anything to do with that song.

580
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,440
No. Yeah, I don't know why you would wanna

581
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,840
tie Donald to Song of the South, but.

582
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:20,680
Yeah.

583
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,520
I guess they thought it was cute.

584
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,560
Well, I didn't know when that was a problem.

585
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,520
Yeah.

586
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:27,600
The song was still around and used just all over the place.

587
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,440
Yeah.

588
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,520
So it was fine then.

589
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,640
I mean, Air Force One really,

590
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:37,240
Air Force One is a plane.

591
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:39,160
Is that name that good? Yeah, that's a confusing thing.

592
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:43,880
I like the name, but, and I get it, but it's like,

593
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:46,320
Mickey should have his own plane called Air Force One

594
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,320
and it shouldn't be a balloon, that should be something else.

595
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,960
It would be named after a famous balloon.

596
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,120
It's also confusing because there is a plane

597
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:57,760
that you would see on the Disney MGM Studio tour

598
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,320
and that had Mickey Mouse on it.

599
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,760
And I believe that that was Walt's plane.

600
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:03,600
Yes. Yes.

601
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,800
And it was the plane that he used to spot the land

602
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:09,880
that he would gather up slowly in a shady way.

603
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:10,720
That's right.

604
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,960
To form Walt Disney World.

605
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,000
Yes, and I.

606
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,080
That's not Air Force One.

607
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,000
I came across the name of that,

608
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,720
people are saying that was just called The Mouse.

609
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:20,920
Really, that plane?

610
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:23,760
Yeah, that was what people referred to that.

611
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:27,160
I came across like three different Mickey based forms

612
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:31,280
of transit that we'll have to touch on on future episodes.

613
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,240
That's interesting, because they,

614
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,840
I wonder if that's the plane he used

615
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,280
for a lot of different things.

616
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,320
Because there were, I'm sure I talked about this before,

617
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:41,320
at Midsommar Scream two years ago,

618
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:44,200
imagine your tiny Norris who worked on the mansion

619
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:47,760
in New Orleans Square talks about being on the plane

620
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:51,720
with them going to New Orleans to find artifacts and stuff

621
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:55,360
to put around the land and put in the Haunted Mansion.

622
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:58,280
And I wonder, is that like the plane he always used?

623
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,520
Because she talks about going to New York on that plane,

624
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,080
going to New Orleans.

625
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,720
Yeah, timing-wise that works out,

626
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,880
because I came across stuff saying that plane was used

627
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:08,760
to go back and forth for the World's Fair.

628
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:12,360
So I believe it is that plane, but.

629
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:15,080
I'd be interested to know if that was like the standard,

630
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:17,760
get on the mouse, like he had his own like Batman,

631
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,680
his own Batplane essentially, and they just like,

632
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,920
we're fired up, we're going to New Orleans,

633
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,880
we need a new lamp to put in the hallway

634
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,040
at the Haunted Mansion.

635
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:29,560
And his office chair sent him into a tube.

636
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,840
Yes, like Batman Forever.

637
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,920
The best Batman film.

638
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:40,720
Yeah, and he didn't pass it along to that,

639
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,440
that didn't work for Eisner and certainly not for Eiger.

640
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,800
Right, no.

641
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,440
They dismantled the chair tube.

642
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,760
Right.

643
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,400
Oh, but hey, well, let me hear,

644
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:52,480
let me see if I can share the screen

645
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,880
despite my computer being hobbled

646
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,760
and being defragged by a clown.

647
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:02,800
Because this hot air balloon did appear

648
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:07,840
in an opening on the magical world of Disney.

649
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,800
And forgive me if it's not super edited,

650
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,360
I'll try, if it gets boring,

651
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,080
and you just wave your hands if you're bored

652
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,760
and we'll turn off the clip.

653
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:20,200
But this is Michael Eisner in Air Force One.

654
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,960
Looking at the balloon, the big balloon,

655
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,960
and it's in front of that dwarf building on the Disney lot.

656
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:38,000
I'm here with Mickey Mouse in a huge,

657
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,640
10 story high hot air balloon in the shape of Mickey's head.

658
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,680
Officially known as Air Force One.

659
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,200
Hello, Michael Eisner, head of the Walt Disney Company.

660
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:51,000
Mickey thought this would be the perfect place

661
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,680
to introduce tonight's Disney animated classic, Dumbo.

662
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:57,760
That's right, Michael, we're going up to meet Dumbo.

663
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,480
What do you mean, going up to meet Dumbo?

664
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:01,200
Well, he's flying over the studio

665
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,600
and we're gonna meet him in the wild blue yonder.

666
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,160
Oh, wait a second, Mickey, I have a family,

667
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,600
I've got children, I've got responsibilities.

668
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:11,000
Ah, Michael, don't be a wimp, this is perfectly safe.

669
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,760
Uh, and where are the parachutes?

670
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:16,240
Michael, relax, you're gonna love it.

671
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,080
Aw, enjoy tonight's picture.

672
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:22,080
Taking off, it's flying, off he goes.

673
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,160
So, there's a cute little moment.

674
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:31,160
Yeah, here's my thought about that

675
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:35,720
and several other bits that I found involving Air Force One.

676
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:39,640
There's also a Christmas special where Regis gets in it

677
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:42,880
and there is the wraparounds of an Easter special

678
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,680
where Goofy is in it.

679
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:48,240
And the implication in all three is danger.

680
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,600
It's always characters like, I don't know,

681
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,480
and I'll let you know, Mike Eisner's saying,

682
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,040
I don't wanna get in the thing, I got a family.

683
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:57,720
And Regis is, ah, what did I get myself into?

684
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,840
And Goofy's like, oh, shucks,

685
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:02,760
I don't know if you'll see me again, but.

686
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:06,800
And then there is no payoff for any of these, all three.

687
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:09,120
That would imply then a little scene

688
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,760
where the balloon's going, whoa, whoa, whoa.

689
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,480
But it's also a balloon that they own

690
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:17,040
and they can't imply that there would be a problem with it.

691
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,520
It'd be a safety issue.

692
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,520
So, it's just people, beat one,

693
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,320
people being scared to get in a balloon.

694
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:25,240
Beat two, three, and four do not exist.

695
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,520
There are no more beats.

696
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:29,200
I think that even in this day and age of Disney,

697
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,840
they wouldn't even imply it was on,

698
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:32,360
they couldn't even, the character couldn't even

699
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,520
be scared of it, I bet.

700
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,400
Yeah, that's true.

701
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:38,640
Yeah, they just say it's the most epic balloon ever.

702
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,520
And it's really gonna set the holiday season off right.

703
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:45,680
So now we're heading over to Disney World

704
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:49,880
for a performance from Megan Trainor.

705
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,760
Always Megan Trainor.

706
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,840
Could you send me that clip, Scott,

707
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,880
because I just wanna take out that little piece of audio

708
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:58,360
of Mickey saying, Michael, don't be a wimp.

709
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:59,960
And I wanna make it my ringtone.

710
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:02,440
Yeah, come on, Michael.

711
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:04,240
So I have an affirmation, don't be a wimp.

712
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,560
I just need that, I think,

713
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:08,280
to get me out of my shell a little more.

714
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,160
It's like, do it for him.

715
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,000
Yeah.

716
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,400
Like that touching Simpsons moment.

717
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,280
That's exactly right.

718
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:18,440
All right, you're gonna be scared of stuff today,

719
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:20,680
but do it for him, do it for the mouse.

720
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,960
Yeah, and that's, I mean,

721
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,880
it's a little bit of a bullying kind of thing.

722
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:27,000
He's calling me a wimp, but that's what I respond to.

723
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,240
Come on, Michael, do you wanna die a coward?

724
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,800
Yeah, Jason, you could dub some lines in too.

725
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,640
Yeah.

726
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,480
Piling on.

727
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:41,080
Let's do it and be absolute fucking legends.

728
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:47,400
Yeah, I need all that.

729
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,560
That would really help me.

730
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:53,480
So that clip reminds me of a big feature of hot air balloons.

731
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:58,480
Since their innovation, they have not progressed super far

732
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:03,720
in that still kind of not quite 100% sure

733
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,160
where you're gonna land.

734
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:10,840
You know, there's a lot of very nature dependent.

735
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:17,520
And that's, I found an LA Times story from 1987

736
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:20,760
where the balloon just landed on the,

737
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:23,960
I believe the soccer field of Cal State Fullerton

738
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,440
with no warning.

739
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,720
It's heavier.

740
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,960
Cal State Fullerton Public Safety Officer,

741
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:34,640
Tom Garrel said the pilot, whom he declined in name,

742
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,600
told him that it was normal procedure

743
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:39,560
to land at any safe available site,

744
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:43,320
even though the landing was at 540 PM,

745
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,680
was not caused by any emergency.

746
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,160
If you have a hot air balloon,

747
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:51,320
you can just land it wherever you want.

748
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:52,600
At least Disney procedure.

749
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,520
I mean, they were being followed by a van.

750
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:58,800
They deflated it and then put it in a van.

751
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:03,040
Has Harrison Ford crashed a hot air balloon?

752
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Is that an onion headline I'm stealing also as I say that?

753
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,480
It is a good question though.

754
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,320
Yeah, cause there was that.

755
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:14,280
It'd be exciting to see him in Ear Force One.

756
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,520
Oh, it would be.

757
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:19,440
Maybe for Indiana Jones 5 when they're promoting that.

758
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,240
Get an 80 year old Harrison in there.

759
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:25,880
He'd be fine. Get off my balloon.

760
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,160
Oh yeah.

761
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,240
Cause he was, yeah.

762
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,680
Okay, after he's still the president

763
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:35,960
and after what happened with Air Force One,

764
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:39,800
they decide it's too easy to sneak onto airplanes.

765
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,400
So we need a safer form of travel

766
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:44,880
that less people can be part of a hot air balloon baskets.

767
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,400
Really hard to stow away in a hot air balloon.

768
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,320
They make a deal with Disney company

769
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,920
and the president of the United States

770
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,920
travels on Ear Force One,

771
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:56,240
but then somebody still sneaked on board.

772
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,160
Captain Hook.

773
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,000
Great.

774
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,360
Solves that problem.

775
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,800
Yeah, that's great.

776
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,320
Scott, did you answer is would you,

777
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,720
have you been in one or would you go in one?

778
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,440
I think I would.

779
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,280
I don't know if I would so actively pursue it.

780
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:15,000
Well, I was gonna say if a bunch of my friends

781
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,440
were going in a hot air balloon,

782
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,920
but like that's impossible.

783
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,320
You can't fit too many in.

784
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,560
You can't fit a ton.

785
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,280
I mean, a few, actually, I honestly,

786
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:25,120
my friends being in the hot air balloon

787
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,600
makes me wanna go on it less.

788
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,080
I don't want shenanigans.

789
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,680
I don't wanna get made fun of if I'm like kinda

790
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,360
crawled up in a corner somewhere.

791
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,600
For sure.

792
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,640
This thing's made for standin', Michael.

793
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,560
You could sleep at home.

794
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,680
Take a look at the view.

795
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,840
Let me give you a big pat on the back.

796
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:44,680
The back.

797
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:50,160
Cowards die a thousand deaths, heroes but one.

798
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,120
Yeah, so I don't know.

799
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,160
We'd all kinda go in it,

800
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,600
but Jason's the only one enthusiastically.

801
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,160
Oh, I would love to.

802
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,000
I wanna know though.

803
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,760
The height miser strikes again.

804
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:00,480
The height miser strikes again.

805
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,760
Did you guys come across the castle balloons?

806
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:08,640
I mean, I remember the castle balloon existing, yes.

807
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,680
I have some questions about the castle balloons

808
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:15,680
because there's a video about that retro WDW restored

809
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:20,160
of a couple who got their wish to go on Air Force One,

810
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,040
and they did it at a balloon festival,

811
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:26,600
which included this balloon of a castle,

812
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,760
but it's the castle from Florida,

813
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,440
and it's labeled Disneyland.

814
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,160
And then I found this picture

815
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:37,280
of what appears to be the same balloon,

816
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:40,400
but it's labeled Walt Disney World 20 years.

817
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,240
What?

818
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,440
And it looks like Sleeping Beauty's castle.

819
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:46,800
Yeah, I think it's the same balloon

820
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:49,160
that they changed logos on almost,

821
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,520
or at least the same design.

822
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,720
That's absolutely correct.

823
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,720
Yeah, I think it was Disney World first,

824
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,160
and then Disneyland.

825
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,600
Stole balloon valor.

826
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,560
Wow, that's crazy.

827
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:03,080
They really, were people furious?

828
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,480
I would be.

829
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,640
I would be.

830
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,880
Yeah, interesting.

831
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:12,800
I'm always mad when the castles are mixed up.

832
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,960
In any casual context,

833
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:15,800
if it's, you know,

834
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,720
or if somebody does a Photoshop on Twitter,

835
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:20,320
or it's like a late night comedy joke,

836
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:23,920
wrong castle is used, it shows your lack of care.

837
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,080
There's a world of difference

838
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:28,480
between Cinderella castle and Sleeping Beauty castle,

839
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:32,280
and this is one of the main issues on my mind at all times.

840
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,840
I get your castle straight.

841
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:36,080
I feel like Ryan Reynolds tweeted a Deadpool joke

842
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,480
a couple years ago, and he was using the wrong-

843
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,600
Yes, and we talked about it, yes.

844
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,080
Yeah, that's right.

845
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,360
Yeah. Yeah.

846
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,040
Well, I was, I know I was mad.

847
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,040
Were you mad?

848
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:48,320
We were all furious, yeah.

849
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,000
Well, I'm always mad at Deadpool,

850
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,920
because he's always up to something.

851
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,720
He's always up to no good.

852
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,840
Well, that's true, that's for sure.

853
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:58,480
Mad at him because he swears.

854
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:01,120
Swear is like that character Michael portrayed briefly

855
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,480
at the beginning of the show.

856
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:09,040
Can I quickly jaunt over to my favorite

857
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,320
hot air balloon scene in media?

858
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,560
Oh, yeah. Okay.

859
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:14,760
Here, let me-

860
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,000
I don't know if I know what this would be offhand.

861
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,840
Oh yeah, like, do you want to guess?

862
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,760
I'll play the end of it.

863
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,320
Jason, do you have any guesses?

864
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,560
I have a guess.

865
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:27,440
Okay.

866
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,480
Is Buffett in the balloon?

867
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,800
No, but I'm sure maybe, I mean,

868
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,240
I have obviously not seen all media,

869
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:34,680
so if Buffett is in the balloon somewhere,

870
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:37,360
then obviously that might go to the front.

871
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,000
But here, let me-

872
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:39,840
Yeah.

873
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,640
Chipmunks movie.

874
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:53,400
Anyway, the Chipmunks and the Chipettes,

875
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:57,200
the big finale of the boys of rock and roll musical number

876
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,400
is them both getting in their own

877
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:02,000
gender specific hot air balloons.

878
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:09,000
One has bows for girls and one has tassels for boys.

879
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:12,560
Oh, there's also Davis at the end,

880
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:15,240
and the whole bit of the thing is Davis on vacation

881
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,560
and he doesn't realize that the kids

882
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,280
have followed him basically.

883
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,120
He's just an idiot.

884
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,760
Around all the places that he-

885
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:23,440
I have a lot of affection for this Chipmunks movie.

886
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,920
Yeah, me too.

887
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,080
Yeah.

888
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:28,520
The Chipettes, so much more fashion forward

889
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,160
than like Alvin Simon Theodore,

890
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,320
look like shit in their colored burlap sacks.

891
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,160
You know, that is a good point.

892
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:34,000
Compared to-

893
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,360
I never thought about that, but you're right.

894
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:41,360
The Chipettes in like 80s, like kind of like fun 80s gear.

895
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:44,080
Well, but the Chipettes newer creations, is that why?

896
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,240
Yeah, I'm sure that's why, but like Mickey Mouse's-

897
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,440
I'm not sure I'm in a 60s show, yeah.

898
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,000
If they were made for the 80s

899
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,560
and to have like Madonna light vibes.

900
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,720
Cause I like the vibe.

901
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,520
The vibe, Eleanor is the best.

902
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:59,640
She's got the tie.

903
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,640
Do you know what I'm talking about?

904
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:02,480
Yeah, that's cool.

905
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,640
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

906
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:04,640
They're all cool.

907
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:05,480
They're all cool.

908
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:07,640
I don't know that you would call the Chipmunks cool,

909
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,360
but the Chipettes are cool.

910
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,200
Yes.

911
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,040
Yeah.

912
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,400
Jeanette, Brittany and Eleanor.

913
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,840
Eleanor is like the Theodore of the Chipettes,

914
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:17,800
but she's, I feel like it's dressed the best of the three.

915
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,640
She's got kind of a-

916
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:19,760
I've been pointed out that-

917
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,600
Oh, okay.

918
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,440
Just like a Diane Keaton vibe, I think.

919
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:24,560
Yeah.

920
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,320
Well, you know, tie.

921
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,160
She worn a tie.

922
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,000
She kind of has like a-

923
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:29,820
Yeah, yeah.

924
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:30,660
The thing going.

925
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:31,680
No, they're cool.

926
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:32,520
Absolutely.

927
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:33,520
Yeah.

928
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,440
Has it been pointed out that we're all,

929
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:38,440
the three of us are kind of the proportions of Chipmunks?

930
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,400
I think it has.

931
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,240
I think somebody made-

932
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,560
I think somebody drew that.

933
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:43,040
I don't know who it was,

934
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,320
but I'm pretty sure somebody made that happen.

935
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:47,400
Yeah.

936
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:48,400
Tall.

937
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,280
Shorter.

938
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,120
Yeah.

939
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:53,600
The lowest hanging fruit, it's literally so low,

940
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:56,440
it's buried in the ground for next season's harvest.

941
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:00,840
I mean, if I'm misremembering, please.

942
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:01,680
Yeah, please go ahead and draw it.

943
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,400
Draw is also as the Chipettes.

944
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,240
I'm interested to see that too.

945
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,080
Oh, that's fine too.

946
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,720
Which one's which?

947
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:09,160
So I'd be Brittany.

948
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:11,800
I believe, yeah, Brittany is the leader

949
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:14,760
and she's the regular.

950
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:15,660
The middle.

951
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:16,500
Yeah.

952
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:17,320
Cool.

953
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,080
And then I'm, yeah, Jeanette.

954
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:19,920
Yeah, Jeanette.

955
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:20,760
And then Jason is-

956
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:21,600
Oh, so I'm Elendor.

957
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:22,960
You're Elendor, yeah, you have the best look.

958
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:23,800
All right.

959
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:24,640
Pretty good.

960
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:25,480
Cool.

961
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,320
Yeah, good for you.

962
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,560
I like, as a kid, I think I liked Simon the best

963
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:29,400
and I don't think it was

964
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,880
because I thought of myself as Simon, but-

965
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:34,160
You knew you'd be the Simon of a group.

966
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,000
Yes, eventually.

967
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,400
At some point.

968
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,960
So we'll do a full,

969
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:40,880
I mean, there's gotta be Chipmunk theme park stuff

970
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:41,920
we'll eventually get there.

971
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:42,760
Is there?

972
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,360
Yeah, were they in a theme park ever?

973
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,280
That's a good question.

974
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,800
That feels like they must have been.

975
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:49,960
That's IT, it's just been there.

976
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:52,320
Yeah, probably the new, maybe the new stuff.

977
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:56,000
Yeah, I don't know, that's not as exciting to me,

978
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,200
but I'm sure we can find some fun in there.

979
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:02,440
Maybe not, or Alvin and the Chipmunks Live,

980
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:05,840
I'm seeing here at Universal Studios?

981
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:06,840
What?

982
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:07,680
Ooh.

983
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:10,520
Various live shows between 1998 and 2002,

984
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:13,360
but there's no information on this one website.

985
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,200
Okay.

986
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,080
2002.

987
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:16,320
Interesting.

988
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:19,280
That's still pre-CGI.

989
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,840
Right, the Chipmunks sue Universal Studios

990
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:24,440
for lack of promotion, is this about the movie?

991
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:29,920
Oh yeah, the creator of Alvin and the Chipmunks

992
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,920
sued Universal.

993
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,080
Huh, all right, well we'll look into it.

994
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:36,120
Yeah, we'll look into it.

995
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,560
Yeah, great scene.

996
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,720
Yeah, that's a great scene.

997
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:44,720
The Eisner and Mickey 32nd scene is a great scene.

998
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:52,680
Hey, well here's a weird use of the balloon of Air Force One.

999
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:55,360
Let me find it in screen share.

1000
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:58,920
I don't know if you guys saw any footage or photos

1001
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:04,640
of Air Force One in Red Square in Moscow.

1002
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:05,720
Isn't that crazy?

1003
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:06,560
Yeah.

1004
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:09,480
I like, this is vaguely familiar to me,

1005
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:10,800
and I think they took photos,

1006
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:15,080
and I think photos were available as a poster or something,

1007
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:20,080
but that's kind of wild, and it's a empty Red Square.

1008
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,440
And I was like, what is this for?

1009
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,720
Why did this happen?

1010
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,680
Do you have any idea why this happened?

1011
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:32,360
Can you picture anything for Disney done in Red Square?

1012
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:34,320
Oh.

1013
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:40,040
Were they taking him around the world?

1014
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:42,080
I think you're hinting at something more specific,

1015
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:42,920
but I feel.

1016
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:45,320
I mean, I think that did happen to some extent.

1017
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:47,920
And by the way, and as you mentioned that,

1018
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:50,520
Air Force One was in all kinds of places,

1019
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:51,520
like there's photos of it.

1020
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,720
I mean, they took it to Euro Disney

1021
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:56,760
while it was still under construction.

1022
00:39:56,760 --> 00:40:00,440
They took it to Niagara Falls, where it had a hat.

1023
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,280
Yeah, wow.

1024
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:05,400
It had a big birthday hat for Mickey's birthday in 88.

1025
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:08,880
That's an Oz, the great and powerful balloon

1026
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,200
in the Disneyland parking lot.

1027
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,400
That's its own thing.

1028
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:16,000
But yeah, that's the right reaction, I think.

1029
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:23,720
Anyway, yeah, so the Mickey Mouse balloon was in Red Square

1030
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:28,760
because of that thing, the Visionarium slash the Timekeeper,

1031
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:33,960
the 360 movie that was in Disney World in Paris

1032
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:36,000
with the Robin Williams robot.

1033
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,200
Wow.

1034
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,920
They are, I believe Jules Verne

1035
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:42,520
is being whisked around the future.

1036
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:45,960
And as part of it, there is one single shot

1037
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:48,560
of Jules Verne in a hot air balloon

1038
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:52,920
when there's other hot air balloons around in Red Square.

1039
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:56,600
It's like a six second scene in this movie,

1040
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:58,720
in one of those Circle Vision movies,

1041
00:40:58,720 --> 00:40:59,920
probably the most complex one

1042
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,960
because it's the one that had a narrative.

1043
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,640
But so you don't see the Mickey balloon in it,

1044
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:10,080
but they shot it in the basket of the Mickey balloon.

1045
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:11,920
Like we have a hot air balloon, we might as well use it.

1046
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,280
I see.

1047
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,240
Yeah, yeah.

1048
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:18,560
But the weird thing about it is that this was done

1049
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:23,560
in Russia in 1991, and then two weeks later,

1050
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:29,000
there was a coup to try to get Gorbachev out of there.

1051
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:32,400
Like when Yeltsin was trying to take over from Gorbachev,

1052
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:36,000
so there was a big crazy coup situation,

1053
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,120
and Mickey Mouse only barely made it out in time.

1054
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:40,120
Wow.

1055
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:41,120
The timing.

1056
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,960
If Mickey was there during the coup.

1057
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:45,440
Yeah.

1058
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:48,680
Yeah, the balloon could have been burnt

1059
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:51,760
as a symbol of something.

1060
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:54,320
I don't really know the issues that were at play.

1061
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:56,040
Again, as if you can't tell,

1062
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:59,800
my knowledge of Disney history is very detailed.

1063
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,520
My knowledge of world history,

1064
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:04,840
even recent world history is not at all.

1065
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:09,240
You can't walk us through the implications of Glasnost.

1066
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:11,200
The lucid egg of Soviet Union.

1067
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:13,720
That's what I was like, well, is it for Glasnost?

1068
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:14,560
Or they're like, where are you?

1069
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,400
American movies are here.

1070
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,400
Probably Glasnost.

1071
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,440
Probably because of Glasnost, I would have to say.

1072
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:20,280
Probably.

1073
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:22,960
That's for the, save it for the Glasnost episode.

1074
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:23,920
Save it for the Glasnost.

1075
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,800
Probably butchering that term, too.

1076
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:28,920
No, I just found Glasnost the clown.

1077
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:29,760
Oh no.

1078
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:30,760
That's terrifying.

1079
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:32,040
The Russian clown.

1080
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:38,520
Did you guys see the pictures of the balloon?

1081
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:41,720
And it's our favorite Glendale location,

1082
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:43,160
Walt Disney Imagineering.

1083
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:44,280
Oh cool.

1084
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:46,600
Rising up above the shrubs.

1085
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:50,440
Rising up from Bio Reconstruct on Twitter,

1086
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:53,080
every theme park person's favorite Twitter account.

1087
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:53,920
Oh, I missed that.

1088
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:57,240
Here he is, you can see the Glendale Air Terminal,

1089
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:59,680
the historic airport terminal

1090
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,640
that is now part of Disney's massive

1091
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:03,440
Glendale, California campus.

1092
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:07,000
This is where Jim Cummings learned to fly.

1093
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Jim Cummings, the cranked out host

1094
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,520
of the opening day special.

1095
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:16,480
Yeah, it used to be an airport and now it's like part of it.

1096
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:17,320
Oh, okay.

1097
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:18,760
Or part of near the Disney campus.

1098
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:19,600
Wow.

1099
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:20,440
What are you showing?

1100
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:22,000
Oh my God, these are crazy photos.

1101
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,840
Yeah, and here's, they were doing like an event

1102
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:26,920
for the Roger Rabbit opening

1103
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:29,920
and for the same event, year four swung was there.

1104
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:30,840
Wow.

1105
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:33,600
I would love to drive by and see a big balloon.

1106
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:35,440
Now, not in my younger days.

1107
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:40,440
We all live not very far from Imagineering,

1108
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:44,000
your three hosts, and we all know where it is.

1109
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,440
And I think I might be the only one

1110
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:49,320
who has actually done this, but I have driven around

1111
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:51,240
and I've done it during the pandemic,

1112
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:56,240
just like so much can I not get a taste of Disney

1113
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,480
that can I like look over a fence

1114
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:00,560
and see anything that's going on?

1115
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:03,240
And the answer mostly is no.

1116
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:06,720
I saw a big thing that maybe looked like, I don't know,

1117
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:09,520
like a giant mermaid tail or something,

1118
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:11,720
but it mostly had a tarp over it.

1119
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:16,720
And I saw a half constructed miniature spaceship Earth,

1120
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:22,480
which I sent photos to Mike and Jason quickly as I could.

1121
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:24,000
Get a load of this, fellas.

1122
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:29,400
A half spaceship Earth rusting in a parking lot.

1123
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:32,840
This is bad.

1124
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:34,640
This is like needing a fix.

1125
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:37,360
Which it gives me a little.

1126
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:38,440
I did it too, though.

1127
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:40,040
Oh, you did a pass at some point?

1128
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:42,040
Yeah, Jane and I drove through once.

1129
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:43,120
It's a little interesting.

1130
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:45,480
It's a very nice area.

1131
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:47,680
They work in great digs.

1132
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:48,640
Did you see anything?

1133
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:49,920
Did you see any tarps?

1134
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:53,720
I saw what looked like the net,

1135
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:56,760
like the framework for the net structure

1136
00:44:56,760 --> 00:45:00,040
that they had been launching the Spider-Man creature,

1137
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:01,640
like a flipping Spider-Man.

1138
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:02,480
That's there for sure.

1139
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:06,560
I saw just the scaffolding, no net or anything.

1140
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:09,560
But you used to be able to drive by and see it like set up.

1141
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:10,640
Yeah.

1142
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:11,480
You'd have to catch it.

1143
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:13,560
I think I saw it still with the nets.

1144
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:14,400
Wow.

1145
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:17,240
I don't wanna make anyone jealous, but I saw the nets.

1146
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:18,520
The Disney nets?

1147
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:21,800
Will there be nets when they do?

1148
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:23,080
Cause we're talking about there's an effect.

1149
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:25,120
There's a robot they're gonna supposedly have

1150
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:26,480
on the top of the new Spider-Man ride

1151
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:29,720
at California Adventure that is like a stunt robot

1152
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:32,320
that does flips and they dress it up as Spider-Man

1153
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:34,800
and he does like flips on the building.

1154
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:38,000
I wonder if there will be nets to catch the robot

1155
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,480
if it falls.

1156
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:41,080
I guess there have to be, right?

1157
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:42,920
Most likely.

1158
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:43,760
Oh, you see.

1159
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:44,720
You don't want that thing shattering

1160
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:46,400
into many, many pieces.

1161
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:47,240
Yeah.

1162
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:48,080
Yeah.

1163
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:49,480
It would be funny if the first time they try it,

1164
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:51,480
like opening day of that Avengers campus,

1165
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:53,160
it just eats shit and shatters.

1166
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:58,040
Or just they misfire it into the Matterhorn.

1167
00:45:58,040 --> 00:45:58,880
Yeah.

1168
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:01,160
It flies all the way from California Adventure

1169
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:02,280
to the Matterhorn.

1170
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:06,400
Legs are just kind of kicking out of the top for a while.

1171
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:08,520
They don't know how to get up there.

1172
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:09,640
Then it's a full day.

1173
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:12,600
People think somebody actually crashed a plane into it.

1174
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:18,400
Those robots are very cool if you haven't seen them.

1175
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,200
They released video of them.

1176
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:22,880
I pre-probably talked about this already.

1177
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:25,600
Aren't they called like stuntatronics or something?

1178
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:27,360
Am I wrong with calling them that?

1179
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:28,200
I think I am, but.

1180
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:29,920
They've made a new term.

1181
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:30,760
Yeah.

1182
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:31,600
So you can have like robots.

1183
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:32,440
Guardians.

1184
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:35,120
Guardians, guardian robots.

1185
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:38,760
You can have robots like iron making land, you know.

1186
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:43,560
But anyway, we'll hopefully see them sometime next year.

1187
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:45,520
I hope so.

1188
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:47,000
Or this year, this year.

1189
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:47,840
Oh!

1190
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:48,840
2021.

1191
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:49,680
Yes, of course.

1192
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:50,520
This year.

1193
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:51,960
Of course, this year.

1194
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:52,800
2021.

1195
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:53,720
Year.

1196
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:54,560
The year we're talking in.

1197
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:56,920
Yes, we of course remember we know this.

1198
00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:01,960
And Air Force One is what we're talking about.

1199
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:05,960
What have we not covered with this marvelous balloon?

1200
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:10,760
I have a photo of it in front of the,

1201
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:15,400
it's in a postcard in front of the Disneyland Hotel,

1202
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:16,960
but that seems impossible.

1203
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:19,000
I bet it couldn't be that close to it.

1204
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,240
But this is what they used it for.

1205
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:21,800
I like, here's really the question.

1206
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:23,280
Did anybody ever see it in person?

1207
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:24,120
Never.

1208
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:25,920
And I ask you guys and I ask the listener

1209
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:28,720
because I'm convinced there were not many opportunities

1210
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:29,760
to see it in person.

1211
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:36,320
I have a picture of one from the Disney Parks blog

1212
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:40,040
that they posted like a throwback picture a few years ago

1213
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:43,240
where it was parked around New Year's one year,

1214
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:44,920
right at the entrance of the Magic Kingdom.

1215
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:46,600
You can see the contemporary in the background.

1216
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:47,800
You can see a big clock.

1217
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:49,920
It's cool.

1218
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:52,040
You can see, yeah, the clock is set up

1219
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:55,000
for the 15th birthday celebration.

1220
00:47:56,360 --> 00:47:58,840
That's why the clock only has the number 15 on it.

1221
00:47:58,840 --> 00:47:59,680
I'm just realizing.

1222
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:00,840
Oh yeah, look at that.

1223
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:01,680
That's fun.

1224
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:03,240
That's not a misprint.

1225
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:04,400
Where's that clock?

1226
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:06,320
Where'd they put that clock?

1227
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:07,760
Yeah, where is that clock?

1228
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:08,880
I gotta bring that out again.

1229
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:11,800
See, see those holiday crowns.

1230
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:12,800
Yeah, I never saw it.

1231
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:15,920
I mean, it felt, I mean, like any of the big,

1232
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:17,200
what are their big balloons?

1233
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:21,200
They made those big balloons for the party gra parade, right?

1234
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:22,040
Those are balloons, right?

1235
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:22,880
Yeah.

1236
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:26,480
Yeah, Epcot big balloons of the characters for some show.

1237
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:28,960
Yeah, I feel like I never got to see the big balloons,

1238
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:30,840
but I really also, here's the thing.

1239
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:33,560
I may have blocked them out of my mind

1240
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:34,760
because as a child, again,

1241
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:37,440
I was scared of these things in person.

1242
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:38,760
And I probably said this already,

1243
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:42,960
but my father forced me to go up to one of these things

1244
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:44,840
to touch it to try to get me over my fear,

1245
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:46,320
which kind of worked.

1246
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:48,280
And it was right by a Toys R Us.

1247
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:50,320
It was right by the Toys R Us on Gulf Road.

1248
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:52,360
And I don't know what business was opening.

1249
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:53,200
It was giant.

1250
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:54,720
So I went over and I don't remember how old it was,

1251
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:57,280
but I did like go up and touch it.

1252
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:58,280
And I felt okay about it.

1253
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:02,040
But still I may not remember some of these things,

1254
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:02,880
but I don't think so.

1255
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:06,880
I think seeing Mickey, I would have remembered.

1256
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:08,440
Every time you saw one of these big balloons,

1257
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:11,040
you just, you blacked out and woke up at home.

1258
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:11,880
Maybe.

1259
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:14,720
Like from Orlando, you woke up back in Chicago.

1260
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:16,400
That's possible.

1261
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:17,800
Yes, it's a memory that my brain wants to forget.

1262
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:19,720
I did remember that.

1263
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:22,200
Rosamont Horizon series of balloons,

1264
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:24,440
but maybe that's the first time.

1265
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:25,440
I don't know.

1266
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:26,280
We'll know.

1267
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:29,200
What about Scabby the Rat?

1268
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:30,520
Was he in Chicago ever?

1269
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:31,920
What?

1270
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:32,760
Oh.

1271
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:33,600
Scabby the Rat?

1272
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:34,440
Oh yeah, I know Scabby.

1273
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:35,400
Who's Scabby?

1274
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:38,360
Scabby is when a union is protesting a business.

1275
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:40,760
Sometimes they will inflate this giant,

1276
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:42,840
ugly looking rat balloon.

1277
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:46,320
I'm sure Scabby had a lot of opportunities in Chicago

1278
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:47,160
to show up.

1279
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:48,240
Well, sure.

1280
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:51,320
I don't think I saw him, but yeah.

1281
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:53,040
I'm sure he was, he was been around.

1282
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:55,640
I'm sure Rahm Emanuel knows Scabby.

1283
00:49:57,160 --> 00:50:00,520
You see Scabby show up outside the Disney parks sometimes

1284
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:03,800
because you know, there's the union issues obviously.

1285
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:08,120
Yeah, Scabby's part of the Disney family character.

1286
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:11,480
Oh, an official Disney adjacent character unfortunately.

1287
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:12,360
Hey, it's Scabby.

1288
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:16,600
Would you have the same respect if Scabby told you

1289
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:18,520
to not be afraid of Scabby?

1290
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:20,040
You'd be afraid of Scabby.

1291
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:22,680
Don't be afraid of me, pussy.

1292
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:24,720
Does Scabby selling Mickey or does he sound like,

1293
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:26,600
I assume he has like a cigar.

1294
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:28,720
Probably.

1295
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:29,560
Oh.

1296
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:31,120
Yeah, I'm Scabby.

1297
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:32,360
Hey.

1298
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:33,360
Don't go on that.

1299
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:34,560
I'm your friend.

1300
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:36,400
Don't be a wimp, Michael.

1301
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:37,800
I'm Scabby.

1302
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:38,640
It's like a harsh,

1303
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:39,480
Don't cross this line, Michael.

1304
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:40,880
The tougher blue 32.

1305
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:44,680
Cut your brake lines if you cross this big line.

1306
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:46,320
Love, Michael, love.

1307
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:49,560
That's what it's all about.

1308
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:52,400
Hey, check out that woman.

1309
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:53,240
She's hot.

1310
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:56,800
It's blue but harsher, what Scabby sounds like.

1311
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:57,640
Yeah.

1312
00:50:57,640 --> 00:50:59,000
It's the same dialogue though.

1313
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:05,520
Yeah, Rob Paulson's doing the,

1314
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:07,560
working on the Scabby movie.

1315
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:10,000
Finally, you know him from protests.

1316
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:13,080
Now Scabby's coming to the big screen.

1317
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:18,080
Scabby's journey to become the mascot of

1318
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:22,040
crooked corporation issues.

1319
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:24,840
I'm surprised Scabby for being such a well-known character

1320
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:27,400
has not been put in a TV or movies.

1321
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:30,080
Somebody should really snatch that up.

1322
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:32,640
Present, very present type-E in people's minds.

1323
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:34,080
We see him all the time.

1324
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:36,880
And I think we'll see him all the time this year as well.

1325
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:37,960
I think that's right.

1326
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:40,040
Maybe some problems that people have

1327
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:41,520
with some companies.

1328
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:47,400
Now there was a return of this balloon

1329
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:51,760
for the 50th anniversary of Disneyland.

1330
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:55,040
They made a bunch of things gold around that time.

1331
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:56,800
I think we talked about it with Casey Jr.

1332
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:59,080
that they painted a Casey Jr. car gold

1333
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:01,480
and I think a lot of other opening day attractions.

1334
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:06,200
And they made big gold ears for Air Force One

1335
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:10,840
and they flew him around into the Grand Canyon this time.

1336
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:12,680
And I mean like into the Grand Canyon,

1337
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:15,600
which I think is hard to do, hard to navigate.

1338
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:18,480
Imperils the people operating the balloon.

1339
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:20,280
Shouldn't have done it, not worth it.

1340
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:23,560
But it made it out, it didn't deflate, nobody died.

1341
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:24,640
Wow.

1342
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:27,800
So there was a gold era of this balloon.

1343
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:30,280
Yeah, it seems like they could add stuff to it.

1344
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:31,560
I mean, I don't know how hard it is,

1345
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:33,360
but it definitely seems like it adds stuff to it.

1346
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:36,280
So it feels like they could add stuff to it.

1347
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:38,560
They could make him a little bit more like the new Mickey

1348
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:40,560
on these new Mickey shorts.

1349
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:42,360
Maybe they could add, they could change the eyes

1350
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:45,200
around a little bit, which I like.

1351
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:46,160
I mean, you could put a hat,

1352
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:48,000
you can put different hats on him, you can put whatever.

1353
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,080
I saw the hat.

1354
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:51,360
I mean, that seems surprisingly easy.

1355
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:52,200
Mm-hmm.

1356
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:54,360
So I like all this.

1357
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:58,240
I want more of it if we can do it.

1358
00:52:58,240 --> 00:52:59,800
I guess balloons are not as,

1359
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:01,880
were balloons hipper back in the day?

1360
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:04,960
I feel like we don't talk about balloons enough anymore.

1361
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:06,680
It was closer to the turn of the century

1362
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:09,440
when it was the main form of entertainment.

1363
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:11,120
That's true.

1364
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:12,800
Around. Balloon shows.

1365
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:14,720
Yeah. Jason, did you ever want to go around the world

1366
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:16,200
in 80 days as a child?

1367
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:19,960
Oh, I can, you know,

1368
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:22,680
I definitely have watched some versions of that.

1369
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:25,000
I feel like I've watched some cheapy versions of that

1370
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,880
as a kid, or like there was a cheapy like dollar store

1371
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:30,560
VHS cartoon or something.

1372
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:33,600
Is that your favorite hot air balloon media?

1373
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:36,960
Is that, well, I didn't see, there was a,

1374
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:38,280
was it called the Aerialist?

1375
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:40,680
There was a hot air balloon movie that went on Amazon Prime

1376
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:41,920
like a year or two ago.

1377
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:44,160
And it like, the trailer was very intense

1378
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:45,800
because I think it was the advent.

1379
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:47,760
Eddie Redmayne?

1380
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:51,880
Could Robert Downey Jr. do around the world in 80s days?

1381
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:53,120
Is that another thing I'm making up

1382
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:57,040
that he was announced for that I've thought like,

1383
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:58,880
that I forgot, but I remember.

1384
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:00,320
Fog.

1385
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:02,320
It's just being called fog

1386
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:05,800
because it's about Phileas Fogg, we all know.

1387
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:08,960
You know, Phileas.

1388
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:10,960
Phileas was Pierce Brosnan.

1389
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:15,640
Phileas was Steve Coogan in that unpleasant.

1390
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:18,600
I'm real, I'm putting together the Disney movies

1391
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:20,160
that I least want to watch

1392
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:23,840
and that will be all the way at the end of my quarantine list

1393
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:26,000
are the ones involving hot air balloons.

1394
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,360
I do not want to watch around the world in 80 days.

1395
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:31,400
I do not want to watch Oz the Great and Powerful.

1396
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:34,520
Is there a good Disney movie with a balloon?

1397
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:36,560
There must be.

1398
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:40,000
Well, yeah, cause you got to go to Disney Minus

1399
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,640
to watch those streaming.

1400
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:46,640
Oh man, Disney Minus was really sitting there.

1401
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:50,360
Is he?

1402
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:52,280
Has anyone's done Disney Minus yet?

1403
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:54,840
I just wanted to pitch

1404
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:58,280
cause I feel like the Donald one looks pretty good too,

1405
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:02,760
but I had some alternate names instead of Zippity Duda.

1406
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:04,880
That you found or that you.

1407
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:06,120
No, I wanted to pitch.

1408
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:10,440
If we bring back the SS Mallard.

1409
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:11,800
Wonderful.

1410
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:12,640
Kind of dry.

1411
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:15,840
That's usually what a water.

1412
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:18,120
It's the same problem with Air Force One, I feel.

1413
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:18,960
Yeah.

1414
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:20,880
I'm going to criticize all of this.

1415
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:21,720
Yeah, okay.

1416
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:23,680
The other, this one is very cumbersome,

1417
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:25,160
but I think that's its charm.

1418
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:26,560
Doonald the Balloonal.

1419
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:30,080
You know, I like that one actually.

1420
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:30,920
Okay.

1421
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:31,760
It's kind of a lot of.

1422
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:32,600
Yeah, I like that.

1423
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:33,440
I like that.

1424
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:34,280
Doonald.

1425
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:35,120
No notes.

1426
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:38,160
Smashing words together, you know.

1427
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:40,240
That it?

1428
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:41,080
That's the list.

1429
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:41,920
Oh, that was a list of,

1430
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:43,480
oh, okay, we're really settling in.

1431
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:45,280
Unless you guys have any, okay.

1432
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:48,200
You were like, I got some to pitch

1433
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:51,280
and you should have said, I have two to pitch.

1434
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:54,960
I burned out typing Doonald the Balloonal

1435
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:56,440
and trying to fight against auto-correct.

1436
00:55:56,440 --> 00:55:58,080
You had to take a nap after that.

1437
00:55:58,080 --> 00:55:59,920
Yeah, I'd take a nap after.

1438
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:01,320
You slept for 13 hours.

1439
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:04,800
I pulled the sandbags off of the bed

1440
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:06,120
so I could float a little.

1441
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:09,640
Rested, and then he rested.

1442
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:13,240
It feels like we're winding down.

1443
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:16,320
We can start coming back to Earth.

1444
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:17,760
Closing thoughts, I think you're right.

1445
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:18,920
I wish they did things like this.

1446
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:22,720
It did add to the grandeur of Disney in my head,

1447
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:23,880
but I was always disappointed.

1448
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:25,480
I didn't get to see it.

1449
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:27,200
So that's my criticism.

1450
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:28,800
I actually do remember thinking,

1451
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:30,080
I think I may have asked my parents,

1452
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:32,080
is that balloon gonna be here?

1453
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:33,280
And they didn't know.

1454
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:35,480
They didn't know what I was talking about.

1455
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:39,240
But hey, I would have liked to have seen it.

1456
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:41,920
I think it should have been more present

1457
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:45,080
and I would just blame that I bet it's very expensive

1458
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:47,320
to operate hot air balloons.

1459
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:49,000
Yeah, I mean, I think it would have to be like,

1460
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,360
yeah, it would have to be a,

1461
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:54,000
it would have to be, they have to commit to it

1462
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:57,680
being somewhere for a while and have a spot for it.

1463
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:59,440
I think it's probably expensive to bring it,

1464
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:01,440
do it this, move it here.

1465
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:03,920
I think if they just carved out a section for it,

1466
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:05,400
maybe they could cut down on cost

1467
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:07,200
because it would just be there for a while.

1468
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:09,640
But yeah, I think that's probably,

1469
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:11,440
they're not gonna just keep it at Disneyland.

1470
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:16,080
They have that big balloon at Disney Springs.

1471
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:18,880
Disney Springs and in Paris.

1472
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:19,720
There's a big balloon.

1473
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:21,680
You can go up in that.

1474
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:24,120
And that doesn't go very high at all.

1475
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:25,520
I think that might even just be connected

1476
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:27,360
to some sort of a wire still.

1477
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:29,760
I don't know that they actually disconnect.

1478
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:33,840
But why isn't that Mickey?

1479
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:37,320
Well, I think it's, sometimes that stuff is,

1480
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:39,120
again, susceptible to the elements.

1481
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:42,200
I found an article where they took the balloon.

1482
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:44,840
It was gonna be at a festival in Iowa

1483
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:48,360
because I guess there was a very bad drought

1484
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:53,360
and an economic downturn in the Midwest farming country

1485
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:56,160
in the 80s and they had a big festival

1486
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:58,440
and they were gonna have,

1487
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:00,400
Air Force One is a big centerpiece of it

1488
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:02,000
and the winds were just so bad.

1489
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,640
They're like, we just can't.

1490
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:06,040
We can't put it up there.

1491
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:08,640
And that's a big issue, I think, with hot air balloons.

1492
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:10,000
You're susceptible to the winds.

1493
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,560
That's probably why there's a wire

1494
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:13,160
connected to the one at Disney Springs

1495
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:15,680
because you'd fly away. For sure, yeah.

1496
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:17,400
In the Florida hurricanes.

1497
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:22,680
Which is what starts Oz's journey,

1498
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:25,760
but do you really wanna go on Oz's journey?

1499
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:27,680
And the answer for me is no.

1500
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:29,240
Do you wanna get stuck in a hot air balloon

1501
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:30,440
with James Franco?

1502
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:33,320
The answer is no. No, no, no.

1503
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:34,600
It's universally no.

1504
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:40,360
Well, did you survive Podcast The Ride?

1505
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:42,560
Second Gate?

1506
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:43,400
I think they did.

1507
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:44,560
Mickey Hot Air Balloon Edition?

1508
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:45,840
I think they did.

1509
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:47,880
I think that they did.

1510
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:52,680
Look at these other ones that we've been talking about.

1511
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:55,360
I really like that Sugar Bear.

1512
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:57,280
I like knowing that he's Sugar Bear.

1513
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:02,840
I like Digum Frog and I do not like Litty the Clown,

1514
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:06,400
who I will be working to expunge from my computer.

1515
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:08,480
As this is being recorded,

1516
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:13,480
I believe the Genius Bar is not super available

1517
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:17,320
due to pandemic and shutdowns, so I don't know.

1518
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:20,880
I might be stuck with Cliffy running my computer for a while.

1519
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:23,200
Did you give, was there a prompt that said,

1520
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:26,120
what do you give Cliffy remote access?

1521
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:27,560
You may have accidentally clicked that

1522
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:30,080
during the setup for the Zoom.

1523
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:32,680
Oh, well, I did click a button that was,

1524
00:59:32,680 --> 00:59:36,920
a window that was so small that I couldn't even read the text.

1525
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:40,640
And now I'm worried that Cliffy wrote

1526
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:44,440
a big confusing Apple warranty kind of thing.

1527
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:47,680
Just made it look like just a black line.

1528
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:50,120
And then in that text,

1529
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:54,560
I gave him permission to take over my computer

1530
00:59:54,560 --> 00:59:56,480
and eventually my body and soul.

1531
00:59:57,400 --> 00:59:58,760
Well, yeah.

1532
00:59:58,760 --> 01:00:01,400
And that little box, that little text box,

1533
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:03,600
about 30 Cliffys are gonna come out of it.

1534
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:05,600
Jesus fucking Christ.

1535
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:08,920
That's like hatching eggs.

1536
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:11,000
Like the, oh God.

1537
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:11,840
Cliffy lays eggs.

1538
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:13,640
Like aliens or their Godzilla.

1539
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:19,240
No, the sugar smacks,

1540
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:22,880
the 50 sugar smacks clown lays eggs

1541
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:24,560
that hatch more of him.

1542
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:28,200
Cliffy, the sugar smacks clown lays,

1543
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:34,000
he has large sugar smack shaped eggs

1544
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:37,200
that come out of his, I guess his asshole.

1545
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:40,480
No, no, he's got a clue.

1546
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:42,160
He's got to be dirty again.

1547
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:43,200
I'm playing the character again.

1548
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:46,000
And he, yeah, he shits out those sugar smack eggs

1549
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:49,720
and then they hatch into little clownlets.

1550
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:50,560
Oh God.

1551
01:00:50,560 --> 01:00:51,600
So you think that maybe it,

1552
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:53,160
do they look like sugar smacks?

1553
01:00:53,160 --> 01:00:55,560
Like, so you think it's just a big sugar smack

1554
01:00:55,560 --> 01:00:57,560
on the ground, but then it hatches?

1555
01:00:57,560 --> 01:01:01,520
Football shaped, football shaped sugar smacks,

1556
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:06,520
hatches and little Cliffys fully clothed too somehow.

1557
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:09,200
Well, that's preferable.

1558
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:11,680
I will give him points for modesty.

1559
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:12,520
Okay.

1560
01:01:12,520 --> 01:01:15,680
But in no other regard, do I like this clown

1561
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:17,680
or the clowns that he lays?

1562
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:20,600
If they're born early though, they are naked.

1563
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:22,920
Yes.

1564
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:25,040
Okay, well go to term then, please.

1565
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:27,480
Let the clown uniform just stay.

1566
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:29,320
Yeah, cause that's the last month

1567
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:32,560
is when the clown uniform grows in the egg.

1568
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:36,040
And that's when every little clown gets its clothes.

1569
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:37,720
Jesus.

1570
01:01:37,720 --> 01:01:40,480
After they lay the eggs in the subway, like you said,

1571
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:43,160
like the Godzilla, the Matthew Roderick Godzilla.

1572
01:01:44,120 --> 01:01:44,960
Cliff with me.

1573
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:46,720
Da na na na, na na na na.

1574
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:53,640
Daddy and Jimmy Page's remake about clown hatching.

1575
01:01:53,640 --> 01:01:54,480
Clown hatching.

1576
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:55,440
That's right.

1577
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:56,280
Oh God.

1578
01:01:56,280 --> 01:01:58,640
I think I'm red in the face from this.

1579
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:01,880
I'm so uncomfortable with this hatching clown notion.

1580
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:05,320
I'm like, I miss Choco now.

1581
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:07,920
You're looking a little clownish if I may say.

1582
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:09,560
No, no.

1583
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:11,160
I'm not red in the nose.

1584
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:13,080
Rosy cheeks and red nose.

1585
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:15,320
No, must fight it.

1586
01:02:15,320 --> 01:02:16,880
Must fight back.

1587
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:18,360
Little clownish.

1588
01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:21,440
Scott, I'm taking over Scott's butt.

1589
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:23,240
No, stop it.

1590
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:25,120
No, we're ending the episode.

Stay subscribed.

1592

01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:37,040
I feel the first one.

1597
01:02:37,040 --> 01:02:39,720
No, no regaining my body, regaining my computer,

1598
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:41,040
hitting the stop bar.
