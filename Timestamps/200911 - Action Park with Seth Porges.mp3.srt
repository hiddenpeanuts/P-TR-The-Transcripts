1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:09,560
Warning, the following podcast contains things that make good boys very uncomfortable.

4
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:17,080
Danger, injuries, high powered weapons, and most importantly, rude teens.

5
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:23,440
It's Action Park with Class Action Park director Seth Borges on today's podcast, The Ride.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:49,920
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, a theme park podcast that will not be held legally responsible

7
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,400
if listeners die from laughing.

8
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,120
I'm Scott Gardner.

9
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,440
I take no responsibility.

10
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:58,240
Mike Carlson does not either.

11
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,000
Yeah, I also don't take responsibility for anything that I do in my life.

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,200
I'm reckless now.

13
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:08,280
That's just, that's a thing that happened from the Europe trip, I think.

14
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,160
I didn't mention it, but now I'm mentioning it.

15
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,160
Anyway, Jason Sheridan is here.

16
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:18,240
I'm here and I guess we should, you know, mention we, like a cruise ship that is docked

17
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:25,440
in like a country that is constantly changing governments, we are incorporated in the country

18
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:28,360
from the terminal that no longer exists anymore.

19
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,640
So we cannot be held liable.

20
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,640
That's right.

21
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:38,280
And while we can't remember the name of it, it is legally listed on a legal document.

22
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,560
It just says the country from the terminal.

23
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:49,440
And yeah, if there's any legal beef with us, take it up with our holding company there,

24
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:52,440
Manhattan and Global Obsolvings Inc.

25
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:57,440
It is a completely legitimate company with a very fancy name.

26
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:01,080
And, you know, take it up with them.

27
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:05,080
We do have insurance, but we will not give you any of it.

28
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:12,920
This is all we, we today are talking about a notorious, the notorious Action Park, which

29
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:19,280
somehow we, has eluded us for the years we've been doing this podcast and we're finally there.

30
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,560
You know how it's eluded us.

31
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:26,800
It's because it was so dangerous and it's just we, I think the three of us, as you know,

32
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,880
everyone, are good.

33
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:28,720
We're too good.

34
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,680
We would have been scared of this.

35
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:34,880
Oh, we would even be like it would have just like not even we wouldn't have acknowledged

36
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,800
its existence because we would have never gone.

37
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:42,040
Our my parents, my mother, I wasn't allowed to go to a normal water park.

38
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:48,720
I don't know why she would have like like duct taped me to a chair to keep me from going.

39
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:55,440
Yeah, if I sensed that a group trip was forming, like, oh, I think I think there's, you know,

40
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:01,120
all the boys choir or something I was in is all going to Action Park.

41
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,880
I would have just like, well, do I fake an illness?

42
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,880
What is my do I quit the boy choir before this has to happen?

43
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,320
What is my plan to get out of Action Park?

44
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,680
Nervous, crying into nervous vomiting.

45
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,680
That was that always worked for me.

46
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,560
The Jason Secret.

47
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,080
Well, it's a scary topic for us.

48
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,760
And so we need somebody to lead us through it.

49
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,760
And I think we have just the person in Action Park experts.

50
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,160
He is the co-director and producer of the documentary Class Action Park.

51
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,160
Now streaming on HBO Max.

52
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,040
Seth Porges is with us.

53
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:37,760
Hello, Seth.

54
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,800
Hey, it's it's awesome to be here.

55
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,480
Yeah. So happy to have you.

56
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,160
Yeah. Yeah.

57
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,120
I don't know.

58
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:51,720
Are are are you appalled by our point of view, by us,

59
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,520
our good boy is working its way and like that?

60
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:59,520
How there's I think there's no chance that the three of us would have set foot in that.

61
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:02,560
I don't want to speak for Jason, maybe, but I think we would have been very scared

62
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,160
of this place if you can't handle a haunt and you can't handle a launch coaster.

63
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,760
The chances of handling an asbestos laden alpine sled

64
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:14,640
that would leave half of your skin at the top of a ski resort in New Jersey.

65
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,720
It's probably out of the question.

66
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,000
Well, now, while we look to point out, we've made progress in these areas,

67
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,440
as I've just been through.

68
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:26,320
I am a launch queen and Mike loves haunts and haunts now.

69
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,960
I will say, though, this may be like if this was still around,

70
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,800
this is maybe a decade later where I get there.

71
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,320
Maybe maybe it's like I can feel the progression,

72
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,640
but I still don't think it's right.

73
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:39,400
It would be right around the corner.

74
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:43,200
Let's just in case anybody doesn't know this, just real quick,

75
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,800
what we're talking about, this was a very dangerous water park.

76
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:50,720
That's probably the most probably the most dangerous, most dangerous.

77
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,040
I'm in New Jersey.

78
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,200
I mean, yeah, the very basics of it.

79
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:02,360
That, yeah, it was in Vernon, New Jersey, many lawsuits, some deaths,

80
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:06,120
unfortunately, and it's developed this notoriety.

81
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:10,840
And I feel like especially I don't think that I ever heard of this place

82
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:15,800
pre 2015 and somewhere around that point, there was a tipping point

83
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,920
where suddenly I'm aware of it. It comes up every once in a while.

84
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,720
I don't know if it was just like everyone was ready to be nostalgic for it.

85
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,120
But suddenly you're seeing articles and videos and I think things

86
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,800
you were involved with said that, you know, mention this place

87
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:33,320
and all the crazy stories and the loops, the crazy looping slide

88
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,760
that is sort of the emblematic image reading you.

89
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:40,280
The entrance of the park, like a demented Cinderella's Castle.

90
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,280
The first thing you see when you walk up to the park, the icon of the park,

91
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:48,800
a giant enclosed tube looping water slide that just instantly

92
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,000
scrambles your brain because it makes no sense.

93
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,920
And when you saw people come go down it, they would come out

94
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,520
facing a different direction.

95
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:59,120
And that doesn't make any sense because what happens?

96
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,360
How does that happen?

97
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,360
It's very strange to be seen.

98
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,440
You would understand. Yeah.

99
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:07,040
It really feels like I'm I'm just going to say I'm just I'm sure

100
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,360
this is not an original thought, but it feels like some a five year old

101
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,600
made a roller coaster tycoon park.

102
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,720
The whole park.

103
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,800
Like the whole park like that.

104
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,440
And they didn't put any thought into it.

105
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,040
And like it's like, yes, they're complaining that they're

106
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,040
getting dumped out the side of a of a inner tube or no thought.

107
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,600
But a ton of imagination.

108
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,520
So imagine like going there as a six or seven year old.

109
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:32,600
And you're used to parks where sort of like the laws of common sense

110
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:36,720
and physics regulate and dictate what rides you can have there.

111
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,960
And you go to Action Park and all of your wildest fantasies,

112
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,840
like the things you would see in like itchy and scratchy land in the Simpsons

113
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,800
are like suddenly in front of you.

114
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,120
And it's it just it messes with your head.

115
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,520
It like you feel like anything, anything is possible when you walk up there.

116
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,840
And that's like in the air.

117
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:56,520
And so it's not just these crazy slides, it's this general sense of

118
00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:00,920
possibility and chaos and violence kind of like conspire

119
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:05,800
to just put people in this mindset where they do things that they would never

120
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,600
in the normal world normally do.

121
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:11,480
Well, and watching the footage like the period footage

122
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:16,560
you have in the documentary, like as as someone who like reads

123
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:21,120
and watches this stuff a lot, everything was just a little off.

124
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:26,160
Like it's like that's not how water slide like that ski lift

125
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,040
is awfully close to that alpine racing thing.

126
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:34,880
Like there's just little aesthetic things of like, oh, usually like

127
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,160
raft rides that four people ride in.

128
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:42,360
There is a series of lifeguards going down and they use hand signals to say,

129
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,000
OK, send another one. This one is clear.

130
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,520
And that just does just didn't happen that next.

131
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,960
Next, next, next, next.

132
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:55,200
If you want to go down like six buddies at a time and get like clogged up in the tube,

133
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,080
like that would that would just happen.

134
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,440
That's like what life was like there and everything there.

135
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,120
You're right. It's all these slides.

136
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:05,440
You look at it now and you kind of seen versions of this like Typhoon Lagoon

137
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,520
or a normal water parks.

138
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,080
But what made actually different was it was it was earlier.

139
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,000
It was one of the first three or four water parks in the country.

140
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,000
Modern water parks country.

141
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,640
So you had like Schlitterbahn, you had one wild Disney's River country

142
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:20,280
and you had action park first four water parks in the country.

143
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:24,080
And so it's just kind of very early and sort of like the evolutionary tree.

144
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,440
Like nobody knew what a water park was.

145
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:29,400
So they're trying out all these ideas, many of them not yet perfected.

146
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,640
And so they all kind of had issues.

147
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:34,760
And now you look at it and it's like, that's that's not right.

148
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,120
That's just like not right.

149
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:40,680
Yeah, I wrote I recall from learning about Schlitterbahn and Wet n Wild

150
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,080
how and I don't remember which is which, but I know like there was there was a time

151
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,960
where there were parks operating for a long time before they figured out,

152
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:51,600
oh, here's a softer material to make the slides out of.

153
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,480
Don't just tear people's knees apart.

154
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:59,160
Obviously, there's a lot of trouble that is specific to action park.

155
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:02,800
But you're you're that's interesting context you're giving us that it was

156
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,720
it was sort of a wild west of an area in general, the water park.

157
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:10,640
It was a wild west and all of those parks, like except for Disney's

158
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,720
River Country, clearly, but like Schlitterbahn and Wet n Wild

159
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:18,720
and Action Park are all run by these kind of really big iconic personalities.

160
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,720
And there's this great like Grantland article about this kind of weird

161
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,680
frenemy relationship between the Schlitterbahn and the one wild guy.

162
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,200
The action park guy was like 10 times like crazier than those guys.

163
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:31,360
And all these rides coming to action park, we talk about in the movie,

164
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,880
but it was it was literally just like some random employee has an idea

165
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:38,920
and they build it or the owner has an idea or they build it or they go to like

166
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,800
IAPA, like an industry convention.

167
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,000
And instead of like the big display booze

168
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,120
where like the real legit manufacturers are, they go to like the little tables

169
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:50,120
in the back where some dude has a doodle and it's like a ball that rolls down a hill.

170
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,960
And they decide to build it, even though no prototypes

171
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,320
have ever been built before.

172
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,680
And so you get all these strange rides

173
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:59,160
that were just kind of, you know, thrown at a wall and what's going to work.

174
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,640
It's very like old timey Coney Island, the way when you see

175
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:07,400
we have to do an episode in some way, like actually getting specific about,

176
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:12,760
you know, like that weird footage you see where it's 20 people in full

177
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:17,760
thick wardrobe, all like on like a vibrating floor,

178
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,440
like being slammed against walls.

179
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,120
I'd like to know what that is and where it comes from and what the hell happened.

180
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:29,000
But it feels like for the 1970s, when there are more polished Disney parks,

181
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,560
it feels extremely like there's never been a park of any kind before.

182
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,520
Yeah, it's like they're starting again.

183
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:38,160
It's like, you know, like this was decades after Disneyland.

184
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,000
Disney World was already there.

185
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,680
And this was in many ways like a direct response to the rise of Orlando

186
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:45,880
as a theme park destination.

187
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:48,960
Like the owner was literally saying to himself, like, OK,

188
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,240
Orlando is all the way down there.

189
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,600
We're right next to New York City.

190
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,000
We're right next to Philadelphia.

191
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,560
We're not that far from Boston.

192
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:58,320
Like half the country is within like a day's drive of here.

193
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,040
Why don't we build Disney World here?

194
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,240
And so they had the ski resort.

195
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:07,240
And of course, the ski resort in New Jersey has like a three month long season,

196
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,520
like nothing. Right.

197
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,320
And so he wants something to do within the summer.

198
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,800
And so they dreamed of building this four seasons resort.

199
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,080
There would be a ski resort in the winter and action park in the summer.

200
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:20,520
And in order to build it, they would, you know, it was mostly funded

201
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,960
via like a penny stock scam.

202
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:25,280
So they would call up like grandma's eating dinner at their table saying,

203
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,480
we're going to build Orlando in New Jersey.

204
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,400
And that's how Action Park was built.

205
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:34,000
Yeah, I it's funny, the scam stuff is very interesting to me.

206
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,720
Like, it's always interesting to us.

207
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,840
It's like an evergreen topic on this show.

208
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:42,760
But at the start of this documentary, I thought, you know,

209
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,680
Mulville, the guy behind Action Park, he was going to join the pantheon of like,

210
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:51,120
you know, John Binkowski kind of miss the hard rock park.

211
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,760
I kind of misguided.

212
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:58,240
But like I was optimistic or like David Hare, like completely delusional.

213
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,680
But Mulville has a body count.

214
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:03,800
The other guys don't have like blood.

215
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,960
Literal blood on their hands.

216
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,640
With his claim to fame.

217
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:13,800
Yeah, this is the second episode where the phrase near decapitation will be uttered,

218
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,680
though. I mean, I think that's worth.

219
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,800
But that was dogma, you would say, before David Hare,

220
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:22,800
for all the things you could call David Hare for, he didn't put up a wire that almost

221
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,600
killed the dog patch episode.

222
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,640
I was just like, like so tense, like when are they going to get to the capitation?

223
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,840
Like when's the capitation coming?

224
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:34,200
The answer was two and a half hours in.

225
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,720
Exactly. You know, it's coming.

226
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,400
It's like, when's the trip wire and all that has to come, it has to come.

227
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:44,040
And it gets to the fireworks factory. Yeah. Yeah.

228
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,960
Exactly. When the fireworks factory coming.

229
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,000
Wait, so you knew about dog patch.

230
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:54,440
So is this your interest in weird, shady, dangerous parks?

231
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,080
Extends, I guess, beyond just action.

232
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,200
Yeah, I got I got a shady theme.

233
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,160
Do you guys know about Spree Park, by the way?

234
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,520
This is no.

235
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:08,880
OK, it was this park in Germany, and it was like the only amusement park

236
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,160
in East Germany during the Cold War.

237
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:14,760
And then after the Cold War, it was purchased by this guy who used it

238
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:19,400
as a vessel to ship large amounts of cocaine inside ride vehicles.

239
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:22,920
So he'd be like transporting like carousel horses

240
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,560
and they'd just be like loaded with cocaine.

241
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,480
It's like a totally wild story. Yeah.

242
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,960
Oh, my God.

243
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,480
That's wild.

244
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,640
That's like what Robert Evans was doing on the set of Popeye with mannequins.

245
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,120
Oh, yeah. Is that right?

246
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,280
I believe it was. Yeah. Yeah.

247
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:42,120
And then like, you know, hiding it in his trunks

248
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:45,400
and having to falsify a letter from Henry Kissinger.

249
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,920
That's a second date one.

250
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:52,120
Yeah, there's a second gate episode clear, but there's a park.

251
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:55,640
I think it's in Germany that's built in a decommissioned nuclear reactor

252
00:13:55,640 --> 00:14:00,200
like the Simpson style, like smoke staff is like the center of the park.

253
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,320
And you're like in rides in the middle of it.

254
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,760
Wild stuff. Do you know anything? Is it cool?

255
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,760
Is it a good place?

256
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,800
I hope it's cool and not very, very hot, honestly.

257
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:12,160
It's probably much safer. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

258
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,880
So do you do you have I assume the answer is yes.

259
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:20,320
Do you have like sort of a maybe a Mount Rushmore of these figures

260
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,200
who have started these parks? Because these people are fascinating.

261
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:26,040
I think it's interesting because Walt's shadow looms large.

262
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:29,400
And I think everyone in their own head thinks I'm going to be

263
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:32,040
the Walt Disney of New Jersey or I'm going to be the Walt.

264
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:36,000
Like, that's always fascinating to me how I think these people are reaching

265
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,360
for that like. Yeah.

266
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:41,160
Well, well, Jean Mulvihill, the guy who created Action Park,

267
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:44,560
he was like trying like directly in many ways modeling.

268
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,600
So what I like is he was friends.

269
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,760
He was friends of Trump.

270
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,160
And what I like to basically say is like when Trump decided

271
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:54,320
he wanted to be like whatever politician, his friend Jean Mulvihill

272
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,080
decide he wanted to be Walt Disney.

273
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,840
So like the thought experiment is like really what would have happened

274
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,520
if Trump had opened an amusement park?

275
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:03,040
And I think that's like exactly how Action Park played out.

276
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:07,240
But there's, you know, we talked about in the movie how amusement parks,

277
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:10,160
theme parks in particular, kind of these like embodiments of these

278
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:14,640
eccentric auteurs often people have like this vision for the world,

279
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:17,440
like a petri dish, maybe for how they want the world to work.

280
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,400
They want to create this little lab

281
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,560
and they want to just like throw people into it.

282
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:24,360
And Walt Disney had this like very specific idea of this,

283
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:27,400
like fantastical, very safe, tame place.

284
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:31,040
You have Disneyland and then Jean Mulvihill's vision was like anarchy

285
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,080
and chaos and like Lord of the Flies.

286
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,720
And that's what Action Park was.

287
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:42,160
Right. And his background seems like it's stock trader, insane pace.

288
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,640
Like no rules.

289
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:47,440
I mean, you basically detail all this in the movie.

290
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,800
Yeah, it really he he got his vision.

291
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,200
It was realized.

292
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:57,840
Yeah, he was, you know, he was just kind of, you know, like Jordan Balfour era

293
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:01,360
Wall Street kind of guy who was breaking all these rules.

294
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,960
And that's kind of like par for the course of that time, that place.

295
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,760
And he gets banned for life by the SEC.

296
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:10,600
But prior to that, he he had his hands in all sorts of businesses.

297
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:13,120
And he kind of buys up these ski resorts for cheap

298
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,960
and basically decides he's going to turn Vernon, New Jersey

299
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,880
into this big time resort destination.

300
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,720
And he quickly realizes that this like small town,

301
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,440
you know, if the SEC can't stop him, what's the town of Vernon going to do?

302
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:27,720
You know, like this attitude of like ask for forgiveness, not permission.

303
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:30,440
Break every rule in front of you, like these small towns,

304
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:34,640
even the state of New Jersey, which is so helpless, like the wheels of regulation,

305
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,680
the wheels of government move so slow.

306
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:39,560
So if he didn't have insurance one season, maybe just like

307
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:43,400
conveniently forgot to file paperwork by the time the state got around

308
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:46,240
to realizing it or saying anything, the season would already be over.

309
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,520
And you'd be like, well, what are you going to do?

310
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,960
We can't undo that season.

311
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:51,840
And as you mentioned before, like for many years of operation,

312
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:55,080
the park operated with a totally fake insurance company

313
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,480
that the owner created based in the Cayman Islands

314
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,440
with the amazing name of London and World Assurance.

315
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,480
I think I want to like print t-shirts that say that.

316
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,480
Like one of my favorite detail, the insurance company of the Cayman Islands.

317
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:10,600
I think the name of the word super name.

318
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,800
How does that mean?

319
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,280
It reminds me of King Features Syndicate.

320
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:16,880
No, yes.

321
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,440
The company that owns all those comic strip characters.

322
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:24,040
So things fancy if you put a stuffy word like Crown or London in it.

323
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,800
Yeah, I think it was like designed to be a pocket of Lloyds of London, clearly.

324
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,920
So like some clerk in New Jersey is going through.

325
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:35,040
Papers like that sounds like an insurance company, sort of, right?

326
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,640
Yeah, for sure.

327
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:42,840
You mentioned Trump, the another character that briefly shows up in the documentary.

328
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:48,040
And I appreciate you contextualizing New Jersey at the time of like Atlantic City

329
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:52,000
had only gotten casino gambling legally,

330
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:58,120
you know, in the early 80s or late 70s or so early 70s, early 70s.

331
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:03,320
Yeah. And one of the first casinos on the boardwalk was the Playboy Club.

332
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:08,920
So then Hefner opens the Playboy Club in North Jersey, too, which

333
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,640
it's kind of like North Jersey is always close to New York.

334
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:16,640
It's always associated with being close to New York.

335
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,680
A few years ago, I think Chris Christie started giving out

336
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:22,800
casino permits for casinos in North Jersey

337
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:25,760
while casinos were struggling in South Jersey.

338
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:30,800
So like there is always shady business going on financially there.

339
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:34,200
And in the 80s and 90s, you could go to Seaside Heights

340
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:38,520
or you could go to Wildwood Beach and just bungee jump off a crane.

341
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:43,560
Like that just and what was under you was maybe a small plot of grass

342
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:46,840
or just the beach, just the mile long beach.

343
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,520
Very brief story that is not in the movie,

344
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,680
that I don't think anybody really knows.

345
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:55,320
So the owner of the park, he had one of the first bungee towers

346
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:58,320
of the sort at Action Park is actually sponsored by Snapple.

347
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,800
It's called like the Snapple bungee tower or something.

348
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:04,680
But he had partners and was investor in some other bungee towers

349
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,200
along the Jersey Shore.

350
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:10,520
And one he was on like the outs with one of his business partners or investors.

351
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,640
And so he planned an overnight Carmen

352
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:16,400
San Diego style heist of this bungee tower.

353
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,960
So he literally in the dead of night steals an entire bungee tower

354
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,480
from the Jersey Shore and then drives off with it.

355
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,680
And the person like doesn't even know until the next morning

356
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:28,200
the entire bungee tower is gone.

357
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,720
This is all the thing after that.

358
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,240
What do you do about it?

359
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,000
No, he was he this is who this guy was.

360
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,920
So another OK.

361
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:39,960
So in 1994, towards the end of Action Park's life,

362
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:44,560
MTV Beach House, Hampton's Beach House, like the grind around the pool,

363
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,280
you know, all that stuff.

364
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:51,880
The MTV wanted to build like a really stupid, ill advised water slide

365
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:55,240
that would go from the roof of the beach house into the beach house swimming pool.

366
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,080
And they had like four days to get the beach house ready

367
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:01,080
from when they took possession of it to when like the show began.

368
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:05,360
So they're thinking like, who can we get to build this really shady water slide

369
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,200
without permits, without zoning, without permission, with Action Park?

370
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:11,200
So they call up Action Park and Action Park, the whole team,

371
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,840
like drives from New Jersey to Long Island, to the Hamptons

372
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:16,880
and constructs this really shady water slide

373
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,760
that went from the roof of the MTV Beach House into the pool.

374
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:23,600
If you look online at like videos and footage from the 94 Beach House,

375
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,520
you can see this big Action Park sign they put next to the house.

376
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:29,640
So like the best video is probably the one of Lisa Loeb performing.

377
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:33,040
You just see this Action Park sign behind her in all of the B shots.

378
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:37,880
But then the kicker to the story is, you know, the park, Gene,

379
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:41,680
he had to supposedly like pay the lumber supplier in Long Island

380
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,800
for the wood they were using to build it.

381
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,880
And he just decided he wasn't going to.

382
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:48,120
He basically was saying like, they're in Long Island.

383
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,360
We're in New Jersey. What are they going to do about it?

384
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,480
And apparently nothing.

385
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:57,640
That's there's a whole documentary in just yet.

386
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:02,600
And just how much he just flaunts laws.

387
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:06,720
Yes. Like I just I am almost I'm just kind of fascinated how that works,

388
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,960
because I think we've talked a little bit about the show, about,

389
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,680
you know, we're following rules and everything.

390
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:17,160
And the idea I'm assuming that you touch on about five percent

391
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:22,440
of just the court cases and the lawsuits that he just ignores.

392
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:25,720
And then like 90 percent of them do kind of go away.

393
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,760
Like it seems like it.

394
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,960
Yeah, nothing. Nothing stuck. Everything went away.

395
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:33,800
The park when it shut down, it was never because of like legal reasons.

396
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:34,960
It was bankruptcy.

397
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,960
It was it was never like they suffered virtually no fines.

398
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,640
Their citations, their entire existence.

399
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,920
Here's a great story. OK.

400
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:43,200
Almost none of this is in the movie just because it's a 90.

401
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,480
It's a tight 90. You got to tell a story. Yeah.

402
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:48,240
Can't tell exactly. Exactly.

403
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,360
So next to the park, they had they had a parking lot

404
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,520
and connected to the parking lot was like a gate.

405
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,240
And if you walk through that gate to this mom and pop restaurant,

406
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:59,720
the mom and pop restaurant was closing and McDonald's wanted to take over

407
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,720
the site and build a McDonald's.

408
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,960
Gene didn't want McDonald's to open up because he thought

409
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,160
would eat into all his concession sales.

410
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:09,000
So what he does is he concocts a scheme.

411
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:09,680
There's always a scheme.

412
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:13,200
He sends like one of his kind of attack dog, like lieutenants

413
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:17,120
to a town council meeting, and he has him say the following.

414
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:21,280
He says, here's what's going to happen if you allow McDonald's to open.

415
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:25,280
We're going to shut the gate that allows people to walk from a parking lot

416
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,400
to that restaurant in order to get there.

417
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,080
Oh, the first thing you got to know also is that a major highway

418
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,320
ran through the middle of the park called Route 94.

419
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:36,240
Says what people are going to have to do is they're going to have to walk on Route

420
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,840
94 on icy roads in ski boots.

421
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,280
They will slip.

422
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,320
They will fall.

423
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,280
They will die.

424
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,080
And the blood will be on your hands if you allow McDonald's to open.

425
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,960
And they did not allow McDonald's to open.

426
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,040
Wow. This I mean, that's crazy.

427
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:56,360
And my first thought is like not to get too political, you know, but like

428
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,440
this is a Trump's running the government.

429
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,920
It's just like, fuck you.

430
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,960
Don't I don't care.

431
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,200
And then like, are you telling me that action park is are you saying

432
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,160
that action park is America?

433
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:08,680
I wish you're telling me at least at the moment.

434
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:12,200
But also, I will say is for the first time, but then I'm thinking

435
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:16,920
this isn't that dissimilar to what Disneyland did in Anaheim,

436
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:19,960
where they were going to build a bridge from a new parking structure

437
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,680
that was across from Harbor.

438
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:24,560
And Disney wanted not not

439
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,800
to have a little area or access point so people could go down

440
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:31,200
and harbor and go to those businesses.

441
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,120
And Anaheim said, no, they should be able to access those businesses.

442
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:36,600
And he said, fuck you, we're not building it.

443
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,400
So it's not totally dissimilar.

444
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:44,440
I think we keep coming across all this odd legality and like shysters

445
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:49,160
and tricks with these because theme parks are such massive undertakings.

446
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:53,920
Like, there's no way to get one made without at least a little sprinkling

447
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:58,000
of shadiness and maybe a giant bucket full of it.

448
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,920
Yeah, you need like a little bit of Robert Moses in you.

449
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:04,080
I think to like get any of these places built, you just need to like steamroll

450
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,520
over people.

451
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:09,640
Well, it's messy man, Barnum and not like great showman P.T. Barnum,

452
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:14,720
like maniac P.T. Barnum, not not singing and dancing Hugh Jackman.

453
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,520
Not to bar them.

454
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:19,760
No, that's a little like a racist, eluded P.T. Barnum.

455
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:24,400
So different. But waiting for the sequel with Gene to it's like he

456
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,760
there's a face to all of these stories.

457
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:31,320
But with, for instance, like Disney and Anaheim, there's not like one hulking

458
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:34,960
figure that's like, hey, we want to build a parking garage

459
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,720
and you're going to pay for it.

460
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,880
And then we're going to collect all the money and not give it to you.

461
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,840
Like, there's not one guy making a weird demand like that.

462
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:46,040
It's a corporation, so it doesn't have a face necessarily.

463
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:48,600
But they they didn't get away with it.

464
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:54,120
And maybe this is sort of similar to this is like how the DNC

465
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:58,200
is like is facelessly shady and they don't get away with as much

466
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:03,560
as when it's just some asshole who like is right, wears it, is proud to wear it.

467
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,520
Yeah, it's me. I don't know. Come at me.

468
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,880
And then nobody does. Right.

469
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:11,280
Yeah, they're very gene and Trump are very, very similar.

470
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,680
And like, I don't know.

471
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:15,120
Yeah, we'll see if like none of this will stick to me.

472
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,240
And it kind of didn't. Yeah.

473
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:20,400
Basically challenging them like what I can imagine, like the Anaheim

474
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:25,120
tops like going to like an Anaheim council meeting and being like, hey, guys,

475
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,160
here's what's going to happen. Here's the deal.

476
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:29,800
It's all thing we're going to pick up.

477
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:33,960
Eiger sends like his Beagle Boys to a town council meeting.

478
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:39,280
This is when they hire all those like the social clubs that like grow Main Street.

479
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,120
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Some heads.

480
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,400
This is what this is their moment.

481
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,880
This is what they've been waiting for.

482
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,360
Time to activate them. Yeah.

483
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,440
They've all been like lying dormant sleeper cells.

484
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:51,080
And now the Hell's Angels

485
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:54,520
of that are outsourced to police like, of course,

486
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,360
the famous Horrible incident at Altamont.

487
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,160
Yeah. The Rolling Stones.

488
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,800
It's the Altima of Disney.

489
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:04,200
They call like, was it like the Waltz Gang or whatever they call it,

490
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:07,040
like all these groups that are just busting heads, you know, you don't

491
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,760
you don't mess with those guys.

492
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:12,600
They just call it the California Adventure Food and Wine Festival.

493
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,680
That is.

494
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:19,000
Yeah, it's wild, but it's yeah, it's interesting.

495
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:23,520
It just you could you feel it more when there's a maniac doing it

496
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,720
one maniac.

497
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:28,680
Yeah. What a what a maniac.

498
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:33,120
I mean, he certainly like holds the piece together and like boy,

499
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:37,360
hearing is hearing his voice is really you've got a couple little moments

500
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:40,480
of his voice and it's it's also very Trumpian and that like,

501
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:43,160
he doesn't like look character.

502
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:46,000
He doesn't like seem sleazy from his appearance, does it?

503
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:46,920
Oh, no, extremely.

504
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,680
He looks like a sleazebag.

505
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,440
What does he like sounds like?

506
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,000
And then there's one I wait.

507
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:56,000
I don't I I only wrote it down so I couldn't do an impression,

508
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:02,720
but the phrase I wrote down is we got skin, you know, it's a beautiful asset.

509
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:05,160
Does that sound familiar from your movie?

510
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:07,600
Yeah. For a very hallucinating.

511
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,280
We got skiing. We got all these nice, beautiful places.

512
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,960
You know, we're valuable asset.

513
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,320
That's what it's. Oh, it's skiing.

514
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:17,120
I wrote it down like skin and I was like, what does that mean?

515
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,360
I didn't.

516
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,120
Slide skin.

517
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:20,800
That's what I wanted.

518
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:23,360
Is he like harvesting the skin of these people?

519
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,920
All right. Skiing. Got it.

520
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,720
In our movie. Yeah.

521
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:30,200
You can hear it in his voice and something about this place,

522
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:35,920
I feel like just emanates it that the there's a defunct land about Action

523
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:41,280
Park and they he Kevin ends it on a clip of like a local news.

524
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:46,960
And it's just an anchor, the news anchor being so sleazy to the correspondent.

525
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:48,800
I know the clip.

526
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,920
It's just so gross.

527
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,920
And it's like, did this get in the air?

528
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:57,200
Yeah. And it just seems to emanate from Action Park.

529
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:59,240
Yeah, absolutely.

530
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:02,600
We talk in the movie a little bit about some like the hanky panky

531
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,960
that was going down at that park.

532
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,680
Well, my favorite. So there was you guys ever heard the term?

533
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:08,320
I never heard this.

534
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,680
I don't know if this is like just an action park thing, but they call it

535
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,280
pool scarfing.

536
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:15,240
And that's like when you just like raid the bottom of pools

537
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:18,600
for like jewelry and money and all that kind of stuff like that.

538
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,040
That's how they would make up.

539
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:23,720
Yeah. These employees are paid like three bucks an hour,

540
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,040
like whatever minimum wage was in the early 80s.

541
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:28,520
And so in order to augment their pay, they would just like,

542
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,440
first of all, they go post scarfing.

543
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,520
So hunting for gold and money and all that stuff.

544
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:36,600
But more than that, they were basically trained by their superiors

545
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,880
on how to steal from cubbies when people were on rides.

546
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,920
So that was like part of the job experience.

547
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,920
So theft was a huge problem.

548
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:47,920
But it was almost all employees stealing from people

549
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:50,640
while they like put all their stuff in the cubbies while they're on rides.

550
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:54,440
With a New Jersey Oliver Twist gang

551
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,720
stealing from cubbies.

552
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:00,200
I can't wait to spend a day in the wave pool.

553
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:06,360
And I certainly want all my gold jewelry in my pocket as I do.

554
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,160
I wouldn't dream of.

555
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:11,480
Now, hold on. If you're in a wave pool in New Jersey, those gold.

556
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,000
No one is.

557
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:18,240
Without common and Scott thinks that there's a guy,

558
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,840
there's a bunch of gold chains at the bottom of a ratio of gold.

559
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,320
The skin. Yeah, the ratio of gold, the skin.

560
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:29,480
Yeah. A frame under shirt and the gold chain, the communion,

561
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:33,000
the gold chain you got as a communion gift stays on in the way.

562
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,560
Aspiring Mr. T's everywhere.

563
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:38,960
They would. OK, so they had this thing, you know, like you go to Disney World

564
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:42,240
and like people take photos of you by the castle and they try to get you

565
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,280
the photo.

566
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:46,560
So they would do that at Action Park where they take pictures of like you with

567
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:48,800
basically these like girls dressed like mermaids.

568
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,160
They were all about just ripping off IP.

569
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:54,160
So it was like right after a little mermaid came out, they would hire all these

570
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:57,520
people dressed in like mermaid outfits and you take a photo, take him

571
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,880
and they try to sell you the photo.

572
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,880
But even if you didn't buy the photo, they would still develop the photo

573
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:04,080
because that's you know, wasn't digital or anything back then.

574
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:08,920
So all the photos that went unsold, the employees would take the ones

575
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:12,400
with the most just a visually large guess.

576
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:15,160
And they put them onto a wall that they labeled the Wailing Wall.

577
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:19,160
So they just built this monument to it was just such a like that's what this

578
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:22,560
place was, man. It was just a lot of respect going around.

579
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:28,080
Sleaziness. I found an article saying how this is just a quote from

580
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,480
This Might Be Sports Illustrated.

581
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:32,800
When Jean discovered that the force of hitting the water at the bottom of

582
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:37,240
Surf Hill could tear off bathing suits, he took immediate action by building

583
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:41,960
a grandstand so spectators could watch this teenage burlesque show.

584
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:48,160
No, it was Jean's first stop every morning was Surf Hill, I was told.

585
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,800
So he personally would do the rounds and wind up there.

586
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:54,120
They built an observation that you can sort of see that in like the

587
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:57,680
headbangers ball clips we use in the movie, which is like a crowd of people

588
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:01,640
overlooking it with that ride kind of looks a little innocuous.

589
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,520
It's like a big slip and slide on a mountain.

590
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:07,760
You go down this like Matt, the original design for that ride, original concept

591
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:11,320
was you're going to jump off of a cliff and that Matt was going to catch you.

592
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:13,040
And then you just kind of coast the way down.

593
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:16,600
That was abandoned because they couldn't find anywhere appropriate to build it.

594
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:20,720
But the employees, everything about this park, like every ride, the employees

595
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:24,920
would, like the teenage employees would personally plus up in some really

596
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,560
strange and erratic way.

597
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:31,320
So this one, they would lift up the mat and they would place other mats or trash

598
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:35,600
cans or just any like large bulbous object they could find under the mat in

599
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,560
order to build a jump.

600
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:40,480
So the last lane far in the right, it was like eight or 10 lanes of people

601
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,440
racing down this hill.

602
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:45,440
They would just build up and build up and get more and more air until the guests

603
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,280
eventually broke their neck as it happened.

604
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:52,080
Like everything at Action Park, it was like the employees found a way to plus

605
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,240
it up, which is weird and creative.

606
00:31:54,800 --> 00:32:00,520
The laws of physics still apply and that just makes the teenage employees furious.

607
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:05,960
I know the only rules that anyone has to follow at Action Park.

608
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:06,800
Yeah.

609
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:11,160
When you're saying all these stories, it's like if somebody was like, well,

610
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:13,920
hey, tell me like, why did Rome fall?

611
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:18,960
They would be like, oh, well, there was this water park and they sort of just

612
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,440
pushed everything to everything went too far.

613
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:25,200
And then like, obviously like it couldn't sustain past that.

614
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,520
Everyone just lost their minds.

615
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:30,760
You know how like movies are given some weird title in other countries?

616
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:33,000
That's like sort of vaguely related, but it's a little different.

617
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:37,960
So I was in like Paris when train wreck came out in a poster called a crazy Amy,

618
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,200
which was terrible and offensive.

619
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:43,320
Oh, but they always have like some type, like a little bit different.

620
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:45,400
The four tells, I just imagine they're like other countries.

621
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:49,040
They really some movie they're going to call it like America Park or something.

622
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,920
You know, like America.

623
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,320
How do we quickly translate what's so crazy?

624
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:57,760
Like, what's the spirit that this is tapping into?

625
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,280
It's exactly like America.

626
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,480
Oh, my God.

627
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,720
Title, probably the most accurate description.

628
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,840
And they go, oh, yeah, we know exactly what that is.

629
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,240
We don't even need to see it. We know.

630
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:09,840
Are you telling me action park is a metaphor for America?

631
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:12,600
Because again, I just don't see it.

632
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:13,920
I don't see. I don't want to.

633
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:17,600
I want I want the I want the listeners to view it themselves and decide.

634
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,920
I would never decide for themselves for them.

635
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,320
But if any of our listeners have just started

636
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:26,280
college and are looking for an essay to write and need a thesis,

637
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,840
this might be a good one.

638
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:34,440
I I I was just going to say, like, I I get I gotten so nervous

639
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:37,200
watching this because I was really putting myself and I said at the start

640
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,280
of the show, like I was not allowed to go to

641
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:46,240
my friend's waterpark birthday when I was 15, 14, 13.

642
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,880
It would happen every year.

643
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:50,280
And my mom, we would get we would like, oh, we're busy.

644
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:52,920
I'd have to say, like, we're busy that day.

645
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:56,680
And I'd be like, because my mom thought this was too dangerous for me to do,

646
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:59,800
especially with a group of kids and the kid whose birthday was

647
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,080
they were a little crazy. They were a little reckless.

648
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,120
One of the kids had a BB gun.

649
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:07,720
And I just the whole this whole thing gave me anxiety.

650
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:11,880
And there's so many stories about like, you know, all fond memories of it.

651
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:15,240
I I can't I can't see it being possible for me.

652
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:19,280
Again, quick, quick role play.

653
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,960
I'm OK, I'm you and you're your mom.

654
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:26,480
Hey, there's going to be there's a change of venue of that birthday party.

655
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:29,360
This year, this year, they want to do it at Action Park.

656
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,080
Well, what is that?

657
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,520
Oh, that's like this.

658
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:37,040
I mean, it's a water park, but it's you know, there's like

659
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:42,440
slide the loops all the way like there's like a full it does.

660
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:44,440
Like it was upside down.

661
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,920
OK, not going to that.

662
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:50,360
Tell Brian that it's our anniversary and we're all doing something that day.

663
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:54,360
But I told him that a month ago and I wouldn't

664
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:56,760
I wouldn't go watch him show off his BB gun.

665
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:00,320
OK, well, tell him it's the anniversary of when we first started dating.

666
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,080
That was our marriage anniversary.

667
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,400
This is our dating anniversary.

668
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:07,680
But I use that when he wanted me to come over and he wanted to show me

669
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:11,800
May West level sensuality on a black and white VHS.

670
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:15,200
I tell him we're celebrating

671
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,960
the bicentennial

672
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,760
years later from that.

673
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,920
Tell him we're late to it for 15 years too late.

674
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:27,480
Tell him you tell him you died.

675
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:30,960
Tell him that you plan to commit suicide.

676
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:35,760
I think this this is not not this is accurate to what would happen.

677
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:39,720
I think oftentimes then I would just be like, well, you call and tell his mom.

678
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,120
And she'd be like, OK.

679
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:45,200
And she would. Yeah.

680
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,880
Of course, she's going to if she listens to this, she is going to dispute

681
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,920
the story that we know.

682
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:52,480
Well, the anniversary is absolutely correct.

683
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,720
That part is absolutely 100 percent correct.

684
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:57,920
And everything else is it's all hypothetical.

685
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:00,240
We're all we're imagining if you went to Action Park.

686
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:03,800
Yeah. So what a place to spend an anniversary.

687
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,120
Yeah. But a place to spend an anniversary.

688
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:12,120
What was your danger tolerance as a child going on rides and water slides?

689
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,480
I loved the thrills.

690
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,560
I did. I really love the thrills.

691
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,920
But it's so weird.

692
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,160
I went to Action Park at like a super young age.

693
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:23,720
So it's kind of hard when you're six or seven years old

694
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:27,240
to tell the difference between the artificial danger,

695
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:31,640
like the imagineered story danger of like Tower of Terror, where, oh, my God,

696
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:34,360
these ghosts are attacking you and your your elevators crashing

697
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:37,800
versus like the actual danger of a place like Action Park.

698
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:40,760
And that's why it's such a mind scramble and like messes with you so much.

699
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,400
Because you go there really young.

700
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,760
You're told these things are dangerous.

701
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,960
But like that thrill isn't, you know, it's an illusion.

702
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,520
And actually, it was like super real.

703
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,040
And I think when you're young, you really can't tell the difference.

704
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:54,160
So you think like it's just like going on a roller coaster.

705
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:57,920
And it's within the confines of like a gated amusement park,

706
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,800
which is a place you kind of take for granted is going to be safe.

707
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:04,600
So all these things in Action Park were effectively like extreme sports

708
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,760
within the perceived safety of an amusement park.

709
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:10,760
And that's what made it so so strange, I think.

710
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:13,880
But even then, you know, I went on a bunch of rides there,

711
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:16,920
but there were ones I wouldn't touch, ones I couldn't touch because,

712
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:19,480
you know, they like the speedboats.

713
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:22,240
I think you had to be like 16 or have a good fake ID to ride.

714
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,920
And I think we should talk about the speedboats for a second, too.

715
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,280
Yeah, I don't know.

716
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:28,680
I don't know about those really.

717
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:28,960
Yeah.

718
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:33,000
Was Gene selling fake IDs as a side business?

719
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,600
Oh, somebody had.

720
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:37,320
OK, there were all the teenagers there had hustle.

721
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:40,920
So like this park, it wasn't just employed by 16 years old,

722
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:45,080
which which is like kind of common for regional parks and like fairs and whatnot.

723
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:48,320
It was managed by them, except for the really, really top people,

724
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:51,280
like the people who would manage like the entire section of the park

725
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:52,880
would be 16 or 17 years old.

726
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:55,480
So they all had hustles. They all had schemes.

727
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:58,240
There were a lot of like pot plants growing up on the mountain.

728
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:02,640
The people who would be in charge of kind of like reservations at the hotels

729
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:06,160
would just like pretend like rooms were booked and then they'd live in those rooms

730
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,600
and throw parties in them.

731
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,760
Like everybody kind of had a hustle.

732
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:13,840
They would, you know, scarf the bottom of the pool for gold jewelry and stuff,

733
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:16,560
kick a little up top and then throw parties with the rest of it.

734
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,640
It was a fun place. It's a fun place.

735
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:21,800
Wow. I am interested to know whatever.

736
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:25,760
Did everyone basically you talk to have like, well, I was also

737
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:30,160
stealing like big canisters of soda and I was selling them

738
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:32,160
to a local restaurant for profit. Yeah.

739
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:36,760
Well, there was some of the scams were like, OK, so they had daily wristbands

740
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:38,560
and maybe different colors depending on what day.

741
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:41,200
So like Monday would be orange, like Tuesday, green kind of thing.

742
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:44,320
So if you collected and people just like tear off their wristbands

743
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,960
and throw them in the parking lot, you can really easily just collect

744
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,600
all these colored wristbands.

745
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:51,720
So not even employees, just like local kids would just scour

746
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:55,480
the parking lot for used wristbands and then sell them to their friends.

747
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:57,920
It was also really easy to sneak into the back of the park

748
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,920
because it's like kind of a wooded.

749
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,160
It's not like there's no gate around. There's no berm.

750
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,960
You know, it's not like Disneyland or something like that.

751
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:06,120
There's no berm at Action Park.

752
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:10,040
So one day this dude escaped from a jail near Vernon

753
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:13,120
and he was hiding out in one of the condos

754
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,960
that was like a budding, the ski resort in Action Park.

755
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:20,040
And this, I think, tells you so much about Action Park and this idea

756
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:23,560
that like rules and laws just don't apply here.

757
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:27,880
He thought he was he was bored while he was hiding out as a fugitive from the law.

758
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:31,640
So he decided to sneak into the back of Action Park, thinking that like

759
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:35,160
the laws of God and man just like don't apply here or something like that.

760
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:38,280
And he was eventually busted while waiting in line for the Colorado River ride.

761
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,600
I didn't even did he not get to go on anything?

762
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,880
He was just standing around a couple of times.

763
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:47,400
I got a couple of a bit of you in. Oh, my God.

764
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:51,400
This is one of the things that I'm sorry.

765
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:54,800
Go ahead. I always go to say no, no, no.

766
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:59,080
One of the things I think that Action Park probably had going for it is like,

767
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,960
you know, I think people think of New Jersey

768
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:05,840
and they think the opening credits of the sopranos like the smokestacks of Newark.

769
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:09,960
But in the spring and summer, they call it the garden state for a reason.

770
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:12,240
It's very lush, very green.

771
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:19,920
And in a lot of the footage that does add some to me, it added like, OK,

772
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,320
that does the woods look kind of nice.

773
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,760
That stream looks kind of nice.

774
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:29,480
But like, I mean, there are water parks in the northeast that don't have like

775
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:33,600
the one in my hometown was just two tube slides and a swimming pool.

776
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:37,560
And on one side was I-95 and was on the other side

777
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:41,160
was the smaller local highway that merged onto I-95.

778
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,840
So it was practically on a highway island.

779
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:48,880
And you knew even as a kid, I knew like, I don't want to go there.

780
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,960
But I think if I saw Action Park

781
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:57,120
from a distance, I would be like, oh, OK, yeah, this looks nice.

782
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:02,560
Vernon is this incredibly bucolic, gorgeous, very lush area.

783
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:05,920
It's you know, it's 45 miles from New York City, but really like it was a cow

784
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:08,080
town, just like farms and whatnot.

785
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:11,840
And then everything started to change in the 70s when Hugh Hefner built

786
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:16,080
the Playboy Club and he wanted to basically turn Vernon into the next

787
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:17,440
Atlantic city. That never happened.

788
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,320
Gambling never actually came up there.

789
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:23,400
And the Playboy Club slowly kind of fell into various states of disrepair.

790
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:27,240
In many ways, the Playboy Club might be a metaphor for something.

791
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,200
I'm not sure why.

792
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:30,200
Man, what could it be?

793
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:31,960
I don't know. I don't know.

794
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,720
But then Action Park, the same deal.

795
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:36,440
It was like, we're going to take this area that has this beautiful,

796
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:37,520
natural surroundings.

797
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:41,040
What is a day trip from New York City and just kind of exploit that.

798
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:45,200
So you have this like natural resources and then just like New Jersey

799
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:48,520
personalities and politics kind of moving in on it is really what made Action

800
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:49,560
Park what it was.

801
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:54,400
There really is a facade of this is a nice, cool place to go.

802
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:58,080
I mean, you're right, Jason, the seeming natural beauty of it.

803
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:01,200
And then that logo rules that rainbow color.

804
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:04,680
It's so simple, but pretty instantly iconic.

805
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:08,040
So you're watching those ads and it's got jingles that are akin

806
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:12,560
to any theme park jingle we like or the we've got it all at Woodfield.

807
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:16,320
It's very like it's it fits right along any of the there's nothing in the ads

808
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:20,040
that tell you this is a shady land.

809
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:24,440
It's not the what was that like old SNL like super

810
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:29,160
like the bouncy ball to how the ads like super deep or fun ball.

811
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,040
Super fun ball.

812
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:33,320
It's not like super fun ball with like 100 disclaimers at the happy fun.

813
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:35,000
No, it's like happy fun ball.

814
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,640
Yes. Happy fun ball. Yeah.

815
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:38,480
It's it's not. Yeah. Sing the song.

816
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:41,000
You know, it's not where it's like come to Action Park

817
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,560
and then like three minutes of fast talking disclaimers,

818
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:45,160
which is probably what it should have been.

819
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:50,840
No, but maybe another theme park tour might have like

820
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:54,080
some entity might have said you got to put a bunch of disclaimers in there.

821
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:56,560
But the jeans not going to do that.

822
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:58,000
It would have made it more popular.

823
00:42:58,040 --> 00:42:59,200
I mean, the whole appeal of Action

824
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:04,120
Mark and why I am fascinated with the topic is that the danger was no secret.

825
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:05,680
Like it was in the newspapers.

826
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:09,160
Everybody, everybody knew when you go to the park in real time,

827
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:12,680
you're hearing people talk about like, oh, yes, some kid got stuck there.

828
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:13,840
Some kid died there.

829
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:14,720
You're just like here.

830
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:17,720
People are calling it to your face like welcome to Accident Park.

831
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:19,080
Welcome to Traction Park.

832
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:20,880
Like it's in the air.

833
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:23,880
And instead of scaring people away, that's what drew them in.

834
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:27,600
And that's what's so strange and I think amazing about Action Park

835
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:30,840
was what happens when not only is the danger draw people in,

836
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:33,880
but then how do people act when they're in this environment

837
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:36,760
where they know it's dangerous and they know there are no rules.

838
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:38,720
And that's really like it's not just any one thing.

839
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:40,440
It's not just this is a dangerous ride.

840
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:41,400
It's just a dangerous ride.

841
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:43,760
And people know it's dangerous and they know they can do things

842
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:46,840
they shouldn't be allowed to do on it is what made Action Park what it was.

843
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:50,800
To again, bring up a sketch analogy.

844
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:52,320
It also it reminds me of the Mr.

845
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:55,800
Show sketch thrill world where it's alternating between.

846
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,400
I wonder if this was Action Park inspired,

847
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:00,360
where you're alternating between news reports

848
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:04,000
about all of the calamity and death occurring at thrill worlds

849
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:08,600
on their new on the Devastator and then and then switching back

850
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:11,840
and forth between that and ads for the Devastator in the line only grows

851
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:15,760
as it like it's not a deterrent.

852
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:20,240
It it feels there's almost like no chance that one of those writers

853
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:23,800
like isn't from the Tri-State area and when you know, it's like

854
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:28,400
it's so weird how the kind of cultural on trails of Action Park, like

855
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:33,560
Judd Apatow tweeted that the screaming that Steve Carell makes

856
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:38,440
when he gets like waxed in 40 year old version was inspired by the screaming

857
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:41,720
he would hear when people were having their wounds treated the Alpine slideshed.

858
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:45,760
It's just like, whoa, wow.

859
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:48,240
It's like wild and crazy. Yeah.

860
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:50,000
Like like you have to imagine.

861
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,240
I love the thing that is amazing about Action Park is this thing

862
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:57,120
that really shaped just like shaped this generation of kids

863
00:44:57,120 --> 00:45:02,280
from the Tri-State area in no small way, like show them how the world works

864
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:06,440
or doesn't work, like traumatize them, like, you know,

865
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:11,000
push them to their limits, maybe build their confidence, did all these formative,

866
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:15,120
better or worse things to millions and millions of kids.

867
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:18,840
And many of them, like they don't really it doesn't never comes up.

868
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:23,040
And I think that's why once Action Park kind of enters the cultural melew,

869
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:26,240
it kind of has these legs because all these people are like, oh, yeah, that

870
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:29,160
I absolutely went there and that, you know, I here's a scar.

871
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:34,880
Like I met I met I met Cory Booker, the senator from I met Cory Booker.

872
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:37,480
And he tweets about Action Park every once in a while.

873
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:41,040
And I mentioned it to him and he just starts lifting up his pant leg

874
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:43,280
and showing me his scars from like the Alpine slide.

875
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:48,240
Like, it's just like millions and millions of people like have these experiences.

876
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:51,280
And it's just kind of like this hidden trauma in the Tri-State area.

877
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:56,760
Well, and there's that that ball, the the I forget the man and ball and ball.

878
00:45:57,240 --> 00:46:01,480
Yeah, that they that the metal ball that someone got inside and rolled downhill

879
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:05,800
and rolled onto the high glass ball, fiberglass, excuse me.

880
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:10,480
I watched that that 80s romantic comedy a few weeks ago.

881
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:11,920
Take me home tonight.

882
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:15,480
And that is a major plot point in that movie, a fiberglass ball

883
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:21,080
that rolls out of control, that is an act of bravery for someone to get into.

884
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:24,000
And I would you have gotten in the.

885
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,800
Yeah. Would you have gotten in the man in the ball in the ball, Jason?

886
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:30,240
I think even I have my limits.

887
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:32,880
The man in the ball.

888
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:34,960
Come on, Jason, get in the ball.

889
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:36,520
The man in the ball in the ball.

890
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:37,000
You know what?

891
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,760
I don't want to.

892
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:39,200
That's your cool.

893
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:42,680
I'm tearing the highway that cuts through the park.

894
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:44,520
What?

895
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:48,920
Even just hearing people talk about a 94, like not 95.

896
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:53,080
The major road you always hear about I-95 going through New Jersey.

897
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:54,320
And it's like, wait, what?

898
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:56,720
There's a 94 like that.

899
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:58,200
That seemed off to me.

900
00:46:58,200 --> 00:46:59,680
That made me uneasy.

901
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:01,400
Just like, yeah.

902
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:03,080
So so so about that.

903
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:05,400
So we're 94 kind of cut the park in half.

904
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:06,920
He had Waterworld on one side.

905
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:09,080
That's all the water side in Motorworld on the other.

906
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:11,720
That's like the speed boats and the racing cars and whatnot.

907
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:15,200
And in order to get between them, they had this real rickety,

908
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:17,720
shady monorail type thing.

909
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:21,080
They'd be like sitting on a bench and would take you over the highway.

910
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:25,760
And Gather told us a story that didn't end up in the movie when a friend of his

911
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:29,360
or maybe it was him, I can't recall, was on that thing and it broke down.

912
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:32,920
It broke down over the road and caught on fire.

913
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:36,520
And either his friend or somebody had to jump down

914
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:40,600
like into the middle of the busy highway because their monorail car was on fire

915
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:43,000
as they're trying to go between Waterworld and Motorworld.

916
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:45,000
So that's Action Park.

917
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,520
And that wasn't in the movie.

918
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:47,320
That was not in the movie.

919
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:48,720
That was on the cutting room floor.

920
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:50,640
I just give you guys a sense.

921
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:52,840
I just want to give anybody a sense that they don't know anything about this

922
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:53,880
or anything about the movie.

923
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:57,320
That story is not in the movie.

924
00:47:57,360 --> 00:48:01,800
That is not even a significant enough event to make it.

925
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:07,200
Also, the the Action Park Gladiator Challenge.

926
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:09,440
You want to talk about IP rip offs.

927
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:11,160
That was a rip off.

928
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:12,480
That was not licensed.

929
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:16,040
Gladiators rip off where guests could just joust

930
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:19,080
large, jacked up to name Turbo.

931
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:24,440
They just hire like this was kind of that peak steroid bodybuilder, like,

932
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:27,040
you know, WWF below and up era.

933
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:31,320
And Action Park was a huge hangout for like steroid freaks and bodybuilders.

934
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:35,160
So many of the stories, especially the ones involving fights from the security

935
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:37,880
guards, involved just like jacked bodybuilders.

936
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:42,560
And so they hired all these like local jacked up steroidal dudes,

937
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:44,760
gave them names like Turbo and Nitro.

938
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:50,040
And then you as a patron at the park could just joust them and fight them.

939
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:55,320
And they got legal action was pushed against them from the actual

940
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:59,800
American Gladiators for just like the straight, straight IP rip off of that.

941
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:03,720
My this is I think is my favorite thing that's there.

942
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:10,400
And I found this this is from a newspaper at the time promoting it.

943
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:14,680
The idea is a spinoff of television's American Gladiators.

944
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:17,520
Though there is no connection with the popular show.

945
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:18,640
Well, I don't know.

946
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:20,200
But is it spin off?

947
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:24,440
There's another blank off word you might use might be a more.

948
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:27,080
Are you allowed to just do that?

949
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:29,840
Are we allowed to like spin things out?

950
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:32,080
Italy, Italy, a movie land.

951
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:35,240
I guess you could say the park we just did at our European

952
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:37,520
trip spun a lot of different things off.

953
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:41,240
They're full of great spin offs.

954
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:42,840
Yes. Yeah.

955
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:45,880
And then a couple of paragraphs later,

956
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:50,600
the Gladiators attraction is run by Michael and Vince Mancuso,

957
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:54,160
former bodybuilders.

958
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:56,160
We end up being a former bodybuilder.

959
00:49:56,160 --> 00:50:00,720
Like that's not a like like you can build your body any time.

960
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:02,520
There's no license that's revoked.

961
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:03,840
What happened?

962
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:05,960
Why aren't they bodybuilders anymore?

963
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:10,480
Straining orders or

964
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:12,760
any number of bannings?

965
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:17,000
You can do this just not in New Jersey.

966
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,600
Go, you got to go over the state line if you want to lift the weight.

967
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:24,040
It feels like you could just like go in in the morning and be like,

968
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:26,200
hey, I got a couple strong guys.

969
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:27,760
Can we have guests fight them tonight?

970
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:30,440
And you'd be like, yeah, Jean would be like, fine.

971
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:32,640
OK, which part of the park?

972
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:36,680
Sometimes they would almost you get the feeling like they're almost asking for

973
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:40,320
for like these big fights and may lays like fights would happen nonstop.

974
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:44,720
Like the security guards are so to just like every day, just fights everywhere.

975
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:46,920
You let people stand up in the middle of the Colorado River

976
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:49,840
ride after the rafts bump into each other and just like have at it.

977
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:51,880
But one of the biggest fights occurred.

978
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:55,640
So a brief period, like in the early days of paintball,

979
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:58,640
action park, got some paintball guns and thought this would be a good attraction.

980
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:00,320
So they decided to orchestrate.

981
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:03,240
Now, they had a lot of guests coming in from the city, meaning like New York.

982
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:06,720
So they decided to orchestrate this year, Queens versus Brooklyn

983
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:09,240
or Queens versus Bronx paintball match.

984
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:11,560
So anybody coming in from Queens is on one team.

985
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:15,520
Anybody coming in from like Bronx or Brooklyn is on number two, another team.

986
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:20,280
And it was just like minutes before the pistol weapon started and the fights.

987
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:25,000
And like it just became this like all out like fight, like blood

988
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,880
everywhere kind of thing.

989
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:29,960
And was this like published, like was this in the paper the next day?

990
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:32,120
Or is this just sort of a story people told?

991
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:34,360
It was. Yeah, this kind of stuff happened.

992
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:36,640
I mean, it got reported. It was widely reported.

993
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:39,800
You know, we spoke to in the movie, a former Vernon newspaper editor

994
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:43,320
who was, you know, she she dared report

995
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:46,520
honestly about the park and kind of suffered the consequences,

996
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:48,640
which you kind of go into in the in the movie.

997
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:52,840
Here's another good story about Jean, I think it sort of builds off of one in the movie.

998
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:55,960
We very briefly have a security guard tell us

999
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:59,760
that he had heard that Jean kept a Mac 10 machine gun in his desk.

1000
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:04,320
The full story is that he actually broke into Jean's office

1001
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:06,800
in order to look for this gun with the idea that he would like

1002
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:10,960
shoot some cans and play around with it and have a good time with this machine gun.

1003
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:14,120
The idea being that Jean saw the gun had been taken or was missing.

1004
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:16,560
He wouldn't report it because it's an illegal gun.

1005
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:18,720
What can you do about it?

1006
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:21,040
Oh, when he got to the office, the gun was not there.

1007
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:24,280
And I only found out a couple of weeks ago, speaking to another former employee,

1008
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:25,920
why the gun was not there.

1009
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:29,480
That former the other employee basically told me that he had the exact same idea

1010
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:32,880
just before this dude had actually broken into Jean's office,

1011
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:36,480
found the gun, shot up a bunch of cans, like had a good time,

1012
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:39,760
stole a bunch of jeans ammo, and he's pretty sure one of the guards

1013
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:41,840
who broke in with him stole the gun.

1014
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:43,440
And that's why it wasn't there.

1015
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:47,080
So so plenty of people were going after Jean's gun.

1016
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:49,440
And his doors are locked.

1017
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:50,880
Yeah, everybody knew.

1018
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:55,920
And she'd also had a had a panic button in his desk and nobody knew what it went to.

1019
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:57,760
It didn't go to the local police.

1020
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:00,200
Like nobody knew where this panic went to.

1021
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:05,760
Local toughs, his Beagle Boy, jeans, Beagle Boys, former bodybuilders

1022
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:08,760
to the Knights of Columbus Club.

1023
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:11,800
You know what I mean?

1024
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:15,320
I would pay money to know what that panic button went to.

1025
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:18,280
I would. That's like a mystery that I'm going to dedicate a couple of years

1026
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:19,840
to solving, I think.

1027
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:23,200
I'm sure people, psychologists or something have done this.

1028
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:27,680
And I'm fascinated by in general human beings behavior, because there has to be

1029
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:33,880
some cognitive dissonance when you hear like, oh, there was a giant fight

1030
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:37,040
or there was a man firing a machine gun off at Action Park last night.

1031
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:38,720
And then you then you go, oh, I would like to go.

1032
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:40,200
I'd like to go.

1033
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:43,640
Is it because I think in your head, you go like, oh, nothing's going to happen to me.

1034
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:44,760
And like, it's going to be fine.

1035
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:47,880
And I'm fascinated by you could probably apply this to covid.

1036
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:50,240
You can apply this to a range of different topics.

1037
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:55,200
But I am fascinated that this only all these stories made this more popular.

1038
00:53:55,240 --> 00:53:57,240
Yes. That's that's crazy to me, because I was

1039
00:53:57,240 --> 00:53:59,560
I've never been again, I've never been like that.

1040
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:02,120
But I think now, especially you would hear all these stories

1041
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:04,960
and there would be this could never exist now.

1042
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:09,960
The uproar, the articles like it would be shut down in two seconds.

1043
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:14,160
And I do think more people would be like, oh, my God, that sounds crazy.

1044
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:18,520
There's gladiator unlicensed gladiator fights happening.

1045
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:20,880
I thought the real turbo.

1046
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:21,520
It's not the real.

1047
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:22,520
Oh, yeah.

1048
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:24,440
But I think it's interesting to say that, because I think like,

1049
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:27,200
so you yourself would be like, I just was a death trap.

1050
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:28,840
I'm not going anywhere near that.

1051
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:33,080
So the place became self selective so that like no good boys were going there.

1052
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:34,720
It was only bad boys.

1053
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:38,480
It was a park just like full to the brim of bad boys who were going there.

1054
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:41,480
And then like what happens when you have a park that's nothing but bad boys?

1055
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:42,880
That's actually right.

1056
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:47,760
Well, now it would be bad boys and vlogger like influence, like, you know,

1057
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:51,200
people going to get stuff on camera.

1058
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:52,560
Right.

1059
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:54,600
Oh, yeah. Can I get an incident?

1060
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:57,880
Yes. And the two million views that will follow if I catch one.

1061
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:00,280
Oh, they're just going to go today.

1062
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:05,320
They go there without a mask just for like the clicks on their TikTok or something

1063
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:07,640
like the libs or something.

1064
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:10,720
I don't know. The park is still open and it's actually kind of a cool place now.

1065
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:14,600
Mountain Creek, you know, a lot of the some of the old rides are still there.

1066
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:17,960
But like they're, you know, modified a little like the Colorado River ride.

1067
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:21,360
You have to wear like a lacrosse style face mask

1068
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:23,600
because so many people were smashing their faces against this cave.

1069
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:28,720
That that ride, by the way, super important in the history of fake rock,

1070
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:31,000
I will say, Colorado arrived.

1071
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:35,000
So it was so they were really early to gun night,

1072
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,880
which is one of the fake rock materials, basically get like a hose

1073
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:41,320
and you spray this stuff and when it dries it onto like a wireframe

1074
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:42,840
and it becomes rock.

1075
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:46,080
And they were, I think, very likely the very first water park

1076
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:48,400
to use gun night in like any capacity.

1077
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:51,480
And so Gene himself was like super obsessed with this

1078
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:55,960
and would just spray shit building these massive like rides.

1079
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:58,800
And so he was really intimately involved with the construction

1080
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:01,080
of most of these rides.

1081
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:03,280
We talked about in the movie, but oftentimes these rides ideas

1082
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:05,080
to come in and be somewhat tame.

1083
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:07,520
And then he get his hands on them and he'd like plus them up

1084
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:11,160
in his own weird way and make them just kind of truly insane.

1085
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:14,080
So the Colorado River ride was initially going to be something like a lazy river,

1086
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:17,360
like a gentle day with your family on a raft kind of ride.

1087
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:21,560
And he wanted during construction to be plus up into a class

1088
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:24,320
for rapid simulation like the real Colorado River.

1089
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:26,800
And he didn't want any lifeguards on the ride because he said

1090
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:29,600
the real Colorado River doesn't have lifeguards, which I love.

1091
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:33,720
And so that was so these rides that in Roaring Springs,

1092
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:35,080
it was just this massive area.

1093
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:38,560
So that whole area was called is called, I think the whole area

1094
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:41,360
is called Roaring Springs, but they was built in like 1984.

1095
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:44,520
And it was just like this gigantic gun night installation

1096
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:48,200
that kind of trying to create this like old timey mountain rocky

1097
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:51,880
swimming hole feel super important in the history of fake rock.

1098
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:56,080
Because maybe up until that point, water slides were just

1099
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:58,280
industrial looking tubes.

1100
00:56:58,280 --> 00:57:01,920
And the idea like what makes Typhoon Lagoon special

1101
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:05,240
or any other wealthy water park is is some environment.

1102
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:09,840
And maybe it was I was I guess with it emulating the real Colorado River,

1103
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:13,880
it is the maybe the first steam just water slide potentially.

1104
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:16,520
Well, or not slide, but whatever it is, water attraction.

1105
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:21,560
Yeah. Other than River Country, which opened, I think 72, the first water parks.

1106
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:26,640
I mean, like what and wild was and most water parks are like a couple of towers

1107
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:28,040
in the middle of a parking lot.

1108
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:30,600
You know, they're they're just like, we're going to build some slides

1109
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:33,200
and you're not really immersed in this environment anyway.

1110
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:35,720
What made Action Park kind of interesting from an environmental perspective

1111
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:39,520
was it was built on the side of a mountain and a wooden mountain of that.

1112
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:42,360
So it felt very natural and very like serene.

1113
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:46,200
But it would also use the slope of the mountain for the for the slides.

1114
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:50,480
So instead of modeling, like maybe we here's what the exact angle of this

1115
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:53,120
right should be for maximum effect and safety.

1116
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:55,760
It would literally be just whatever the slope of the mountain is.

1117
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:57,040
That's what we're going to use.

1118
00:57:57,040 --> 00:58:00,000
And that that's how like most of the park was built. Wow.

1119
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:05,680
And it used just the real bodies of water that were there in some cases,

1120
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:11,240
which was a true shock to the system for people to just slash down and hit real

1121
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:15,160
like chillingly cold water, chillingly cold water.

1122
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:17,680
And it was shaded natural water, too.

1123
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:21,440
So those areas and that area, that's where like the Tarzan swing was.

1124
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:24,120
And Cannonball Falls, that was open until like two years ago.

1125
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:27,720
So that's stuff you could still do until pretty recently. Yeah.

1126
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:31,120
Well, it's a safe with no restrictions, essentially.

1127
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:35,680
Yeah. Well, I mean, back then they were just like throwing kids off.

1128
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:40,520
Well, OK, Tarzan swing is not a ride that's like innately dangerous.

1129
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:45,080
Unless you get a lot of people like slip and lose a hold of the handle

1130
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:47,920
and like hit their head against the platform, they're jumping off.

1131
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:49,120
What that would happen all the time.

1132
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:52,440
But like in theory, you're like on a rope and you're swinging into a pool of water.

1133
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:53,600
If you do it safely, you're fine.

1134
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:57,680
The real thing that made Tarzan swing so notorious was just like the atmosphere

1135
00:58:57,840 --> 00:59:01,080
because like 100 people from New Jersey are looking at you and just taunting you

1136
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:03,560
and making fun of you and screaming at you.

1137
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:07,120
And so even if you weren't like a big enough kid to go on,

1138
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:09,720
like the speedboats or the looping water slide,

1139
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:12,280
you could still probably go into Tarzan swing

1140
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:15,920
and still get like a taste of what this park was all about.

1141
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:20,200
And I think that's why Tarzan swing is so infamous and kind of lives on so much

1142
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:23,400
in the imagination because everybody could go into Tarzan's way,

1143
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:25,400
not just like the bigger kids.

1144
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:28,920
Yeah. I mean, they had stuff like that at River Country.

1145
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:33,440
But it was a simulation of the old swimmin hole.

1146
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:37,120
You know, there are plenty of lakes and ponds that do have a rope swing,

1147
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:40,680
you know, in the northeast that do have that kind of rope swing

1148
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:44,240
that you can go into a body of water, a varying coldness.

1149
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:47,400
And River Country was like, you know,

1150
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:53,600
non chlorinated famously like fed from the waterways around Disney.

1151
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:55,520
And they had rope swings and everything.

1152
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:57,240
But it's Florida.

1153
00:59:57,240 --> 01:00:00,760
It's Orlando. That water is like bathwater.

1154
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:04,840
You know, it's just constantly cooking, you know.

1155
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:09,360
So my this is like in my blood, my my mom actually grew up

1156
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:11,840
on an old timey swimming hole water park.

1157
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:15,680
So that's like so she that was like her upbringing in the Ozarks in Missouri.

1158
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:19,640
She grew up living and working on one of those kind of like swimming hole

1159
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:21,920
with the Tarzan Swing Water slide water park.

1160
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:26,040
And, you know, that's all there was until the late 70s

1161
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:30,200
when like Schlitterbahn Action Park opened and tried to kind of commoditize

1162
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:33,640
these really like naturally occurring organic like places.

1163
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:35,720
That's what it was. Yeah. Yeah.

1164
01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:38,200
And I mean, River Country was open.

1165
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:42,040
I think it was 76, like two years before Action Park.

1166
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:45,160
And obviously a much bigger budget, much more imagineered.

1167
01:00:46,760 --> 01:00:52,480
But you see the way the slides look and they're pretty small at that point.

1168
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:57,040
And you see like this is what fiberglass like slides.

1169
01:00:57,520 --> 01:00:59,400
This is what it looks like.

1170
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:01,720
And it does not look like that at Action Park.

1171
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:05,200
No, no. And they would and it would test things.

1172
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:08,840
I mean, every like they would test things in a way that you knew it was safe

1173
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:11,680
by time, because it was Disney, you know, Disney had decades

1174
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:13,880
of experience making rides and like testing rides.

1175
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:17,880
Action Park's testing process was let's send some dummies down

1176
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:19,600
and hope they're not decapitated.

1177
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:22,240
And if they're not decapitated, we'll wave hundred dollar bills in there

1178
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:25,880
and then send employees down and then we'll work out the kinks that way.

1179
01:01:26,120 --> 01:01:27,720
That was how they would test rides.

1180
01:01:27,720 --> 01:01:30,680
And if somebody corrected me, though, only the older kids were given $100.

1181
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:33,000
There's more. They've got more bodies.

1182
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:34,760
They're taller. So you give them more money.

1183
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:37,760
What's not clear about that?

1184
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:39,800
Yes.

1185
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:43,480
Can you imagine?

1186
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:44,600
Yeah, that loop, I'm sorry.

1187
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:45,640
What were you saying, Mike?

1188
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:47,600
No, I was going to say if you were saying about the loop,

1189
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:51,000
I was just thinking about being this tall and going on that loop.

1190
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:55,400
And it would just I would come out twisted into a cartoon.

1191
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:58,720
That's like I would be all wrapped up like a present compacted.

1192
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:00,280
It hurt.

1193
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:01,880
Yeah.

1194
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:05,520
I'm trying to remember in the movie, I was just going to say,

1195
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:10,560
was there stuff, was there anything Gene was like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, too far?

1196
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:16,800
No, he was probably the most the most like to the right of the curve

1197
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:20,000
of anybody at the park, you know, so everybody under him

1198
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:24,480
was like trying to temper his instincts to be like, hey, maybe we shouldn't do this.

1199
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:26,640
And he was the guy was like, oh, we're just going to do it.

1200
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:27,480
It's going to be great.

1201
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:29,200
It's going to be so much fun.

1202
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:30,640
And that was his thing.

1203
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:33,520
And it's such an interesting that's why his character is so interesting

1204
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:38,400
because he he was this, you know, fairly well off like Wall Street outcast

1205
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:42,480
who just like really immersed himself into like playing rollercoaster

1206
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:44,800
tycoon and like coming up with these novel ideas.

1207
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:46,880
It's something it's something strange about that.

1208
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:52,360
So is it literally true that the the loop, because the it's

1209
01:02:52,360 --> 01:02:56,360
it's said somewhere in the documentary that the cannonball loop

1210
01:02:56,360 --> 01:02:59,760
looks like somebody just did it as a doodle on a napkin and then that was built.

1211
01:03:00,040 --> 01:03:02,120
And that was what happened, right?

1212
01:03:02,120 --> 01:03:07,480
Like like Gene drew one of the slides loops and then it and then it happened,

1213
01:03:07,480 --> 01:03:10,240
which because it just that's what's so striking.

1214
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:14,480
I remember when I first saw it, you know, as some thumbnail to click on,

1215
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:16,960
it seemed fake. It looks like an onion.

1216
01:03:17,240 --> 01:03:23,640
Like it's like it looks Photoshop the the actual photo of the slide in reality.

1217
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:26,280
It looks like it's in scratchy land.

1218
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:29,240
It looks like something like The end of Simpsons or like life is hell.

1219
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:33,520
Back in the day, it was Gene himself who drew basically a circle and a cocktail

1220
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:35,960
napkin. And the only thing that comes to mind, it's like in the Hudson

1221
01:03:35,960 --> 01:03:38,040
Cripple proxy, it's like a circle napkin.

1222
01:03:38,040 --> 01:03:40,760
It's like, you know, for kids, what else would go wrong?

1223
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:46,040
That's probably the most upsetting thing in the documentary is the phrase

1224
01:03:46,040 --> 01:03:48,520
teeth pad in the loop.

1225
01:03:48,520 --> 01:03:54,200
Second, the only other competition might be pond filled with gasoline and snakes.

1226
01:03:54,840 --> 01:03:56,480
Yeah. And dead fish, too.

1227
01:03:56,480 --> 01:03:57,920
And dead fish.

1228
01:03:57,920 --> 01:04:03,440
But they had to put a pad in the loop to cushion people.

1229
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:06,800
But then people kept coming out with cuts and abrasions.

1230
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:08,120
And then they looked at the pad.

1231
01:04:08,120 --> 01:04:10,600
It was it was covered with loose teeth.

1232
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:13,640
Yes. And there is like a Lovecraftian monster.

1233
01:04:13,640 --> 01:04:16,280
So you go through it and the teeth would just like eat into you,

1234
01:04:16,280 --> 01:04:18,840
which is nightmare fuel. Just terrifying.

1235
01:04:18,840 --> 01:04:20,720
It's the worst place in the world.

1236
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:24,960
The top of that loop is the literal worst spot you can be.

1237
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:30,200
Scientists have studied it for years trying to understand this little spot.

1238
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:32,720
It didn't exist until 1978.

1239
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:36,960
And being an employee there, like the stuff you would have to do.

1240
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:40,280
So the Alpine slide, which it's widely thought to be like a concrete

1241
01:04:40,280 --> 01:04:42,640
or cement track, but it's actually mostly made of asbestos,

1242
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:45,960
was just like a loose track built into the side of a mountain.

1243
01:04:46,280 --> 01:04:49,480
And you take this cart and you go to the top on a ski lift.

1244
01:04:49,480 --> 01:04:52,240
And as we talk about in the movie, it was a pretty regular practice

1245
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:55,200
for people to knock their carts off their ski lift and attempt

1246
01:04:55,360 --> 01:04:58,960
to hit people below them as like a sick game of target practice.

1247
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:00,240
Because why not?

1248
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:03,760
But you make it to the top and you'd be greeted with like warning signs

1249
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:07,440
and photos showing you wounds and like gory bloody bodies,

1250
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:09,920
like saying, like, keep your hands inside the track.

1251
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:11,720
Like this is serious.

1252
01:05:11,720 --> 01:05:15,640
Well, in the movie, we show like a quick shot of a newspaper article

1253
01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:18,560
about this girl who got her finger cut off because she,

1254
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:21,760
I guess, didn't keep her hands inside the inside the track.

1255
01:05:22,360 --> 01:05:25,960
The girl who lost her finger wrote me after the movie came out

1256
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:31,440
thrilled because she's like, nobody believes me that I lost this on a ride.

1257
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:33,880
I can't find any documentation.

1258
01:05:33,880 --> 01:05:38,520
And she sent me a video of her fingerless hand, just like like she told me.

1259
01:05:38,520 --> 01:05:41,200
She got a nine thousand dollar payout for that.

1260
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:45,760
But she was she was like super excited to have her missing finger

1261
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:48,360
or make a cameo in the movie. Very strange.

1262
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:52,120
The Alpine slide to put them to Twitter afterwards, by the way,

1263
01:05:52,120 --> 01:05:55,320
if you guys want to the video of the finger video.

1264
01:05:55,640 --> 01:05:58,520
Yeah, she said I could share it if you guys want the bigger

1265
01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:01,120
if the audience demands it.

1266
01:06:01,120 --> 01:06:03,440
Yeah, if the audience, we're going to blur it.

1267
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:05,880
I think we're going to blur it and put a bar on it.

1268
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:07,520
We're too scared.

1269
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:12,440
Yeah, I want to mention Action Point,

1270
01:06:12,440 --> 01:06:15,280
the Johnny Knoxville movie inspired by Action Park.

1271
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:20,160
So they kind of replicated the Alpine slide in that movie.

1272
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:23,360
And first off, Johnny Knoxville said

1273
01:06:23,360 --> 01:06:26,800
making that movie was the most injured he ever got.

1274
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:32,360
And the Alpine's the story goes that like on the Alpine slide, he flew off it,

1275
01:06:32,760 --> 01:06:36,280
landed on his face, went to the hospital.

1276
01:06:36,280 --> 01:06:38,840
They checked him out, gave him the OK to go home.

1277
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:44,200
He went home, blew his nose and his left eye popped out of his head.

1278
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:50,640
So even the recreation of the Alpine slide was

1279
01:06:51,320 --> 01:06:52,960
was like dropping people.

1280
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:56,920
The worst damage ever done to Johnny Knoxville.

1281
01:06:57,320 --> 01:07:01,160
Yeah, a man who gets damaged every point of Johnny Knoxville.

1282
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:04,560
Oh, my. He got messed up making that movie like really.

1283
01:07:04,840 --> 01:07:08,400
He's and then I saw some article where he detailed some of that and said,

1284
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:11,160
like, and it wasn't worth it because the movie didn't do good.

1285
01:07:11,840 --> 01:07:13,200
It didn't do.

1286
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:17,000
But I think I didn't get hurt at all.

1287
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:22,400
One thing that's odd to me in general about the places

1288
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:25,080
where people got injured and in fact killed,

1289
01:07:26,080 --> 01:07:31,400
you know, Action Park did not invent the Alpine slide.

1290
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:36,760
Like there's an Alpine slide in Big Bear that I've done a couple times.

1291
01:07:36,760 --> 01:07:39,600
And I'm I'm a pussy and I did it.

1292
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:43,160
And so if that tells you like and I had fun,

1293
01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:45,880
I wasn't you could tell how if you just throttled it the whole time

1294
01:07:45,880 --> 01:07:48,440
and were a little, you know, play it a little fast and loose

1295
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:50,360
with it could be dangerous.

1296
01:07:50,360 --> 01:07:51,640
And I was trying to break a lot.

1297
01:07:51,640 --> 01:07:56,240
But like it in and of itself isn't this crazy idea.

1298
01:07:56,240 --> 01:08:01,160
It's just like the way they did it and the negligent way, which similar to

1299
01:08:01,880 --> 01:08:04,080
I was just going to say the same thing about wave pools.

1300
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:05,880
It's funny. Wave pools in the world.

1301
01:08:05,880 --> 01:08:09,280
But there's only one that kept like drowning people.

1302
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:11,560
Yeah. So compared to this,

1303
01:08:11,560 --> 01:08:14,920
you you probably at some point in your life have had an automobile.

1304
01:08:14,920 --> 01:08:17,840
That automobile in itself is not dangerous.

1305
01:08:18,120 --> 01:08:22,240
But if you remove the brakes, got drunk and tried to smash into the person

1306
01:08:22,240 --> 01:08:24,120
ahead of you, it would be a very dangerous.

1307
01:08:24,120 --> 01:08:27,320
Yeah. And that's kind of what the Action Park Alpine slide.

1308
01:08:27,360 --> 01:08:30,040
That's a very good way to break it down. Yeah. Yeah.

1309
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:35,760
I mean, I don't you also explain how it's you had to like know all the curves.

1310
01:08:35,760 --> 01:08:40,840
You had to like know it as if you'd done a hundred runs before you could.

1311
01:08:40,840 --> 01:08:44,320
I just imagine it's even cool runnings where he's like in the bathtub,

1312
01:08:44,320 --> 01:08:47,640
memorizing and studying like all the twists and curves he's got to do.

1313
01:08:47,840 --> 01:08:50,800
It literally is the the there are three tracks.

1314
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,280
And one of them was the expert track, they called it.

1315
01:08:53,560 --> 01:08:56,280
And that was like that was extreme.

1316
01:08:56,640 --> 01:08:59,760
That was the one where people just constantly flown off of that.

1317
01:08:59,760 --> 01:09:02,160
Like you have to be crazy to go on that thing.

1318
01:09:02,160 --> 01:09:05,880
And that was one where if you went at full speed, you were going to fly off.

1319
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:07,640
You just were going to fly off.

1320
01:09:07,680 --> 01:09:12,560
And this gets really dicey because part of the duties of the employees

1321
01:09:12,760 --> 01:09:15,200
was when it rained, I think it was super dangerous when it rained.

1322
01:09:15,480 --> 01:09:16,960
So it was your job.

1323
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:19,920
If you're an employee, they didn't want to wait toward like the dry naturally.

1324
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:20,920
That's like downtime.

1325
01:09:20,920 --> 01:09:25,080
You know, so if you're an employee, it'd be your job to dry it off

1326
01:09:25,280 --> 01:09:29,280
by taking an Alpine slide cart down the wet Alpine slide with towels

1327
01:09:29,480 --> 01:09:32,360
dragging behind it, sopping up rain.

1328
01:09:32,360 --> 01:09:35,240
And you weren't supposed to break while you were doing this,

1329
01:09:35,240 --> 01:09:38,040
because for some reason or another, the act of breaking was like super

1330
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:39,680
dangerous on the wet surface.

1331
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:44,320
So you had to go down it without using a break with towels behind you.

1332
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:48,200
And I spoke to somebody who was doing this when the person behind them,

1333
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:52,080
their thing got messed up or they know what it was, was they couldn't resist

1334
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:55,840
the urge to break because every fiber of your body is telling you to break

1335
01:09:55,840 --> 01:09:57,240
when you do that. So they break.

1336
01:09:57,800 --> 01:10:02,520
A person behind them ran over them, just like over them on the Alpine slide.

1337
01:10:02,520 --> 01:10:04,880
These are sending like four kids at a time down with towels.

1338
01:10:05,080 --> 01:10:07,400
Sopping up a wet Alpine slide.

1339
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:11,400
So she's Seth, when you go on like the Matterhorn at Disneyland,

1340
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:16,000
do you just like yawn or you just like as you went to this place

1341
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:19,480
as a child, like it reset your whole danger level?

1342
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:24,160
I mean, yeah, you know, yeah, yeah.

1343
01:10:24,160 --> 01:10:25,240
Right. Like Matterhorn.

1344
01:10:25,240 --> 01:10:27,000
Come on, guys. Yeti is not even real.

1345
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:28,760
You know, right.

1346
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:31,960
Like there would have been a real like like there would have been a real animal

1347
01:10:31,960 --> 01:10:35,840
at Action Park that was stuck inside of the ride that would claw you.

1348
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:37,880
Dude, that would be

1349
01:10:37,880 --> 01:10:39,840
one of you guys is from Jerry. Jason, you're from Jersey.

1350
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:41,520
Yeah. Oh, I yeah.

1351
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:44,640
From outside of Philadelphia, but spent a lot of time in Jersey. Yeah.

1352
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:45,840
Do you know about that?

1353
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:49,800
Like drive through Safari attraction built around this time in Jersey

1354
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:52,640
that they like had lions and stuff, but they abandoned it.

1355
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:55,400
And then like the lions and like tigers took over this place.

1356
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:57,280
Do you know about this thing?

1357
01:10:57,280 --> 01:11:01,440
It's hard to say if I know about it, because I think there's more than one.

1358
01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:03,520
I mean, Six Flags.

1359
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:05,520
I did the great adventure.

1360
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:10,600
My family would do the you drive your minivan through the Safari

1361
01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:14,360
and don't put the windows down and also take the antenna off

1362
01:11:14,360 --> 01:11:17,120
because the monkeys might take it if you don't. Yeah.

1363
01:11:17,560 --> 01:11:19,360
I was like a Jersey thing. Drive through.

1364
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:21,640
So that's like a big Jersey thing.

1365
01:11:21,640 --> 01:11:26,640
And in recent years, they had a big like, you know, Six Flags.

1366
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:30,880
They had an official driver off road vehicle that would take you through this park

1367
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:32,640
in times of covid.

1368
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:37,560
They reopened it for like, and, you know, the park's not open yet,

1369
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:40,000
but you can drive through the Safari again.

1370
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,800
So I don't know what safety measures they've taken, but,

1371
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:48,120
you know, it might be it might be on the rise again

1372
01:11:48,120 --> 01:11:50,720
as drive through entertainment catches on.

1373
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:54,040
Yeah. In early days of Action Park,

1374
01:11:54,040 --> 01:11:55,560
when they were still figuring out what it was going to be,

1375
01:11:55,560 --> 01:11:58,560
the Alpine side was the first ride they had before was like any water

1376
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:00,640
size about they had like a roller skating rink.

1377
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:03,320
And I think they actually had a petting zoo and they had like lions and stuff.

1378
01:12:04,040 --> 01:12:07,080
So they were they were definitely like they weren't going to put a robot yeti

1379
01:12:07,080 --> 01:12:09,000
and they were like everything was going to be real there.

1380
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:10,520
Everything was going to be.

1381
01:12:10,520 --> 01:12:12,280
Gene was looking for a real yeti.

1382
01:12:12,280 --> 01:12:15,000
He went out on an expedition.

1383
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,120
He was going to find the Jersey Devil.

1384
01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:20,640
The Jersey Devil was going to be the the main draw.

1385
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:24,120
Gene would have gone around Disneyland and been like gone to Mr.

1386
01:12:24,120 --> 01:12:27,520
Toad and been like, remove this track, let him drive the real car

1387
01:12:27,880 --> 01:12:30,280
through the ride. What the fuck is this?

1388
01:12:30,280 --> 01:12:31,560
Like and then there's every ride.

1389
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:33,320
I assume he would have built pitchforks.

1390
01:12:33,320 --> 01:12:35,960
People can reach up and grab them.

1391
01:12:35,960 --> 01:12:37,720
Ram them into the other vehicle.

1392
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:39,680
I actually go into hell.

1393
01:12:39,680 --> 01:12:41,840
Yeah, let's summon up some demons in here for real.

1394
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:44,080
Let's get a look at a crooked priest.

1395
01:12:44,080 --> 01:12:46,280
I got to say I got a guy. I got a guy.

1396
01:12:46,280 --> 01:12:48,560
Got a Ouija board over here, guys. Let's do this.

1397
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:49,480
Yeah, let's.

1398
01:12:49,480 --> 01:12:52,480
It's not the mission. So turn it up to 400 degrees.

1399
01:12:52,520 --> 01:12:54,880
Get it up and up and down.

1400
01:12:56,000 --> 01:13:00,120
Action Park is the real life version of the Jurassic Park line

1401
01:13:00,120 --> 01:13:02,840
about like if the Pirates of the Caribbean breaks down, the pirates

1402
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:08,200
don't eat the tourists like if the ice breaks down, you will.

1403
01:13:08,280 --> 01:13:10,800
You will get destroyed.

1404
01:13:11,560 --> 01:13:14,800
There's like no chance Michael Crichton didn't go to action park, right?

1405
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:18,760
Like Westworld and Jurassic Park, like like half of the Michael Crichton

1406
01:13:18,760 --> 01:13:21,320
cannon is theme parks that go raw.

1407
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:23,560
Like he went to action park, right?

1408
01:13:23,560 --> 01:13:25,960
Huh? That's I mean, yeah, like he was.

1409
01:13:26,280 --> 01:13:29,120
Yeah, he was probably born in what, the 40s or 50s?

1410
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:31,600
He would have been a little older, maybe.

1411
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:34,320
This was all born from this timeline.

1412
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:36,600
Might not be right because Westworld is maybe up.

1413
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:39,960
But I like to imagine that it was his entire body work was born from

1414
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:44,640
doing the Tarzan swing and a bunch of Jersey meatheads yelling,

1415
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:46,400
you fucking pussy.

1416
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:49,480
And he splashed hard and everybody booed him and made fun of him.

1417
01:13:49,480 --> 01:13:51,320
And he's like, I'll show you.

1418
01:13:51,320 --> 01:13:53,920
I'll become one of the great authors of the century.

1419
01:13:55,120 --> 01:13:58,120
Thirty eight year old man doing the Tarzan swing.

1420
01:13:58,920 --> 01:14:00,280
Getting yelled at.

1421
01:14:00,280 --> 01:14:03,640
The first scene is biopic is him wiping out a Tarzan swing

1422
01:14:03,640 --> 01:14:05,160
and it's just trying to get us come up.

1423
01:14:05,160 --> 01:14:08,960
And the thing nobody talks about about action park,

1424
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:11,960
this is going to be kind of gross, is so OK.

1425
01:14:11,960 --> 01:14:13,960
It became like super popular super quickly.

1426
01:14:13,960 --> 01:14:18,400
They started running TV ads and then they got up to 15000 people on a busy day,

1427
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:20,360
like a million people a year.

1428
01:14:20,360 --> 01:14:23,640
And it was this regional park and they didn't have enough bathrooms.

1429
01:14:24,240 --> 01:14:27,560
So there was like a multi-year period in which they just didn't have

1430
01:14:27,560 --> 01:14:29,920
the infrastructure to deal with all of the waste.

1431
01:14:30,120 --> 01:14:32,600
And so people were just like shitting everywhere.

1432
01:14:32,840 --> 01:14:36,320
So I had a former employee tell me they were like, clean out the grottoes

1433
01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:40,400
and the caves and everywhere you look, they just be like shit like everywhere.

1434
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:43,200
And that was like a big job for all the teenagers.

1435
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:45,480
But they like like hosing down the Alpine slide.

1436
01:14:45,480 --> 01:14:46,560
It really disgusting.

1437
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:48,400
Eventually, they added more bathrooms.

1438
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:50,920
That's good. Eventually.

1439
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:55,520
The food. It's like a roller coaster tycoon when you don't have enough bathrooms.

1440
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:57,480
It's like weird things start to happen. It's just like that.

1441
01:14:57,600 --> 01:14:58,320
Right.

1442
01:14:58,320 --> 01:14:59,720
Yeah. He sits on the coaster.

1443
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:05,560
Like it doesn't all the footage you have of a guy manning a grill or manning.

1444
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:06,960
It looks disgusting.

1445
01:15:07,160 --> 01:15:11,880
Like I love eating garbage, but the food cooking footage is so unpleasant.

1446
01:15:12,080 --> 01:15:14,760
And it's crazy that like,

1447
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:18,040
you know, the I always how do you pronounce his name again?

1448
01:15:18,240 --> 01:15:21,280
The head of the hill, the hill, the hill

1449
01:15:21,480 --> 01:15:27,360
that he like, like Silvio or Polly Walnuts was obsessed

1450
01:15:27,560 --> 01:15:33,560
with community festival like that was another odd layer of him is that like he

1451
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:38,560
loved throw it the German festival, Polish festival, Irish festival

1452
01:15:38,760 --> 01:15:41,840
and putting on the later hose and putting on the later hose.

1453
01:15:42,040 --> 01:15:45,960
And like that was such a weird detail about this guy.

1454
01:15:45,960 --> 01:15:47,160
Yeah, actually, it was kind of

1455
01:15:47,160 --> 01:15:49,800
historically significant some of the things he did in that regard.

1456
01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:53,960
They opened up one of the first microbreweries in the country and they'll

1457
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,600
claim they kind of kick started the microbrewery, whatever.

1458
01:15:56,800 --> 01:16:02,720
But he went to Germany and he had an entire brewery dismantled and shipped

1459
01:16:02,720 --> 01:16:04,680
to New Jersey, including the Brewmaster.

1460
01:16:04,680 --> 01:16:07,800
They would claim that everything but the water came from Germany.

1461
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:11,640
And according to the book put out just a couple of months ago by the owner's son,

1462
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:17,200
the Brewmaster they brought in had previously been Hitler's personal Brewmaster.

1463
01:16:18,200 --> 01:16:20,160
That too.

1464
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:24,840
I think if this part couldn't be any more cursed,

1465
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:29,960
it's just they should have just leaned into like it's a crazy extreme place.

1466
01:16:30,160 --> 01:16:32,080
And yeah, Hitler's Brewmaster.

1467
01:16:32,280 --> 01:16:34,280
And you think that's a that's a clever name.

1468
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:36,200
And they'll say, no, it isn't.

1469
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:38,080
It's descriptive.

1470
01:16:38,280 --> 01:16:40,160
It is true.

1471
01:16:40,360 --> 01:16:43,400
Like, yeah, how old is Hitler's Brewmaster?

1472
01:16:43,400 --> 01:16:45,280
He was like an old dude when he came in.

1473
01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:47,600
Everybody was like, he was like the old guy by that point.

1474
01:16:47,680 --> 01:16:49,640
He's got to make some like that.

1475
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:52,240
Those beers can't like the pod.

1476
01:16:52,440 --> 01:16:57,160
They can't like sting and bubble too much because it'll like nip at that stash.

1477
01:16:57,360 --> 01:16:59,120
It's he probably had to go a little mellower.

1478
01:16:59,320 --> 01:17:00,400
That's fair.

1479
01:17:00,600 --> 01:17:03,400
I've used this joke, I think, on the show before, but it's like Emperor.

1480
01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:05,080
I assume is Hitler's Brewmaster was like

1481
01:17:05,280 --> 01:17:11,160
Emperor Palpatine, an exegol and the last Star Wars movie, the crane kind of like

1482
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:16,520
just keeping him alive because he needs to brew more beer and making beer with

1483
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:18,400
lightning. That scene.

1484
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:23,080
Yes, that scene that had to have been somebody who like just rode Forbidden

1485
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:27,320
Journey and was like, that's what that's what moves the Emperor like a cuckoo arm,

1486
01:17:27,320 --> 01:17:28,760
whatever it's called. Like, you know, that's it.

1487
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:29,920
Right.

1488
01:17:30,120 --> 01:17:30,720
Yes.

1489
01:17:30,920 --> 01:17:34,200
So JJ Abrams was interested in the cuckoo arm technology and he was like, we're

1490
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:37,960
going to put a arm attached to the cuckoo arm.

1491
01:17:38,160 --> 01:17:39,520
Totally cuckoo arm, isn't it?

1492
01:17:39,720 --> 01:17:45,240
Well, I think we're like the corner of the DVD box of Prometheus.

1493
01:17:45,240 --> 01:17:49,080
I saw like a Giger drawing just out of the corner of the eye.

1494
01:17:49,080 --> 01:17:50,760
And it's like, oh, that's yeah, that's good.

1495
01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:51,880
That's cool.

1496
01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:54,680
You're based on my vague memory of this.

1497
01:17:54,880 --> 01:17:59,280
Based on the thing, the DVD box.

1498
01:17:59,480 --> 01:18:02,960
What rights would you have, guys, would you guys have gone on, like actually got

1499
01:18:03,160 --> 01:18:06,280
any of them? That's what I was thinking about the whole time.

1500
01:18:06,480 --> 01:18:10,880
I the Tarzan swing I might do

1501
01:18:11,080 --> 01:18:14,120
now as a kid, I would have freaked out because I was freaked out of that high

1502
01:18:14,200 --> 01:18:15,120
dive as a kid.

1503
01:18:15,320 --> 01:18:18,240
I could barely go off the regular diving board.

1504
01:18:18,440 --> 01:18:21,200
Yeah, I could not dive at all

1505
01:18:21,400 --> 01:18:22,320
as a kid.

1506
01:18:22,520 --> 01:18:25,040
Now I might do it.

1507
01:18:27,240 --> 01:18:33,960
Alpine slide, the easy, whatever the safest version I might have tried, but that's

1508
01:18:34,160 --> 01:18:37,800
still I don't know. Yeah, I mean, yeah, I mean, that one's dangerous.

1509
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:43,520
I like the idea of the Colorado River and maybe today I would do whatever version

1510
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:47,560
of it there is, but back then it seems kind of deceptively.

1511
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:49,000
I really like that aspect.

1512
01:18:49,200 --> 01:18:52,840
You can choose your own adventure, that there's different paths.

1513
01:18:53,040 --> 01:18:57,320
I think like that is a water slide or water attraction asset is cool.

1514
01:18:57,520 --> 01:18:58,680
And that would make me want.

1515
01:18:58,880 --> 01:19:01,120
But I also feel like it might just like

1516
01:19:01,320 --> 01:19:05,120
I might just slam my head on those innovative fake rocks.

1517
01:19:05,320 --> 01:19:09,480
Yeah, yeah, you don't really get to choose like physics chooses for you.

1518
01:19:09,680 --> 01:19:12,560
Typically, the Tarzan one, I think.

1519
01:19:12,760 --> 01:19:16,640
Now, you know, look, is a needy ass performer.

1520
01:19:16,840 --> 01:19:21,080
I think I would enjoy being on the stage of the Tarzan swing.

1521
01:19:21,280 --> 01:19:23,440
I would enjoy the audience.

1522
01:19:23,640 --> 01:19:29,360
I would do something impressive, but I would I would maybe enjoy yelling at people.

1523
01:19:29,560 --> 01:19:30,960
And maybe I wouldn't even go off.

1524
01:19:30,960 --> 01:19:34,160
Maybe I just go up there and taunt everybody and then get them to all boo me

1525
01:19:34,360 --> 01:19:35,960
because I also like wrestling so much.

1526
01:19:35,960 --> 01:19:36,920
I would feel like I would.

1527
01:19:36,920 --> 01:19:38,160
That's a good deal.

1528
01:19:38,200 --> 01:19:39,360
You would have been the heel turn.

1529
01:19:39,560 --> 01:19:41,200
Yeah, the Tarzan swing.

1530
01:19:41,200 --> 01:19:44,080
You would have had your persona like, oh, it's that guy again.

1531
01:19:44,280 --> 01:19:46,040
I just stands there and holds up the line.

1532
01:19:46,240 --> 01:19:46,560
Right.

1533
01:19:46,760 --> 01:19:48,360
And making fun of people out there.

1534
01:19:48,360 --> 01:19:49,640
And then I got like ready to go.

1535
01:19:49,640 --> 01:19:50,520
I pretend I'm going to do it.

1536
01:19:50,720 --> 01:19:54,240
And then I turn around and then everyone booze me and I relish.

1537
01:19:54,440 --> 01:19:57,480
I then when you go to the Gladiator experience,

1538
01:19:57,480 --> 01:20:01,000
everybody is excited that turbo gets the whoop you because it's like, oh, they got

1539
01:20:01,200 --> 01:20:04,040
that that wimp from earlier. I get my.

1540
01:20:04,240 --> 01:20:06,080
Yeah, I remember him.

1541
01:20:06,280 --> 01:20:07,200
He held up the line.

1542
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:08,360
I don't think I would.

1543
01:20:08,560 --> 01:20:11,400
You know, it seems maybe safe ish.

1544
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:12,280
It correct you.

1545
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:13,680
You might know more than me, Seth.

1546
01:20:13,880 --> 01:20:22,520
But for the person playing more than the employee, the battle tanks sort of seem

1547
01:20:22,720 --> 01:20:23,760
like I would love to do that.

1548
01:20:23,960 --> 01:20:29,920
But that was is there a way that I'm forgetting that it would hurt me?

1549
01:20:30,120 --> 01:20:31,040
No.

1550
01:20:31,240 --> 01:20:33,400
Well, unless the OK, sometimes the greats

1551
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:36,880
that like would close that would keep the balls from hitting you in the face.

1552
01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:38,640
Wouldn't close and be able to get pelted in the face.

1553
01:20:38,840 --> 01:20:40,920
We did a drive in screening of the movie

1554
01:20:41,120 --> 01:20:44,280
in Brooklyn like a couple of weeks ago right before it opened before it was

1555
01:20:44,480 --> 01:20:49,160
released and we had a dude bring us a bunch of vintage action park ride vehicles,

1556
01:20:49,360 --> 01:20:50,280
including a battle tank.

1557
01:20:50,480 --> 01:20:52,200
So I got to like get inside of one.

1558
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:55,120
And that was like I could feel the ghost, man.

1559
01:20:55,320 --> 01:20:56,960
That was that was it for me.

1560
01:20:57,160 --> 01:20:57,960
That was it.

1561
01:20:58,160 --> 01:20:59,720
Getting inside that tank. Pretty cool.

1562
01:20:59,920 --> 01:21:01,120
I was like, I'm home.

1563
01:21:01,640 --> 01:21:03,400
We talk a lot about owning pieces of the park.

1564
01:21:03,400 --> 01:21:06,600
Would you want to own one of the battle tanks and display it proudly?

1565
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:10,160
Oh, there's like a weird kind of underground collector.

1566
01:21:10,360 --> 01:21:12,440
You know, it's not it's not like the,

1567
01:21:12,640 --> 01:21:16,320
you know, the Disneyland collector scene like at the Van Eden Gallery or anything.

1568
01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:19,840
But there's people who collect old action park ride vehicles because something

1569
01:21:20,040 --> 01:21:22,280
strange happened that when the park shut down,

1570
01:21:22,480 --> 01:21:24,640
I'm going to get my timeline and my story mixed up here.

1571
01:21:24,840 --> 01:21:26,040
So like, don't scream at me.

1572
01:21:26,240 --> 01:21:31,400
But this one dude like bought up all of the Motor World ride vehicles.

1573
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:35,320
So the speedboats, the Lola cars, which were the racing cars, the tanks.

1574
01:21:35,480 --> 01:21:40,800
And they sat in this like storage container in Vernon for like 20 years or so

1575
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:45,040
until I want to say 2015, he just sold them all at once.

1576
01:21:45,240 --> 01:21:46,640
So just a couple of years ago,

1577
01:21:46,640 --> 01:21:50,120
all these collectors started getting their hands on all of these rides.

1578
01:21:50,320 --> 01:21:51,440
So I've been in touch with like a half

1579
01:21:51,640 --> 01:21:55,200
dozen people who have battle tanks, so speedboats, Lola cars.

1580
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:56,920
And so we had a couple come to the screening.

1581
01:21:57,120 --> 01:21:59,600
It was amazing. Just wild stuff.

1582
01:21:59,800 --> 01:22:02,480
Do these fetch a lot of money on an aftermarket?

1583
01:22:02,480 --> 01:22:03,920
I assume they fetch a lot of money.

1584
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:05,840
But is it how how crazy does it get?

1585
01:22:06,040 --> 01:22:06,680
Do you know?

1586
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:11,920
I think it's I think it's closer to what the value of that would be as like a 40

1587
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:14,200
year old speedboat than like as a nostalgia item.

1588
01:22:14,200 --> 01:22:17,160
You know, I don't think I think it's like a couple of thousand bucks.

1589
01:22:17,360 --> 01:22:19,440
But I think you can get them to work is what's cool.

1590
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:22,760
You know, like Disney, you're buying like a space mountain car.

1591
01:22:22,760 --> 01:22:24,840
You can't actually ride that if you're

1592
01:22:24,840 --> 01:22:27,960
buying like an action park battle tank and you get a fixed up, you can actually

1593
01:22:27,960 --> 01:22:30,640
ride that. I think that's what makes it cool.

1594
01:22:30,640 --> 01:22:33,880
Now I'm afraid I'm going to see one of those coming down my street.

1595
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:39,120
Firing at people who voted for whoever they didn't vote for.

1596
01:22:40,720 --> 01:22:42,960
With like on fire tennis balls.

1597
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:44,960
It's just Leno.

1598
01:22:46,480 --> 01:22:49,560
Oh, in our area. Yeah, yeah.

1599
01:22:49,560 --> 01:22:52,080
He's got an airplane hanger full of all the action

1600
01:22:52,080 --> 01:22:54,280
park ride vehicles, I'm sure.

1601
01:22:54,280 --> 01:22:55,760
Oh, my God.

1602
01:22:55,760 --> 01:22:59,920
I remember the East Coast equivalent of Jay Leno is just collects this stuff.

1603
01:23:00,640 --> 01:23:03,640
Yeah. We speaking of vehicles.

1604
01:23:03,920 --> 01:23:05,120
Super speed boats.

1605
01:23:05,120 --> 01:23:07,360
I have the Wikipedia in front of me.

1606
01:23:07,360 --> 01:23:10,720
The super speed boats were set up in a small pond known by Park staff

1607
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:14,000
to be heavily infested with snakes.

1608
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,040
Yes. Yeah. Yes.

1609
01:23:16,040 --> 01:23:17,360
Well, it's true. Good.

1610
01:23:17,360 --> 01:23:18,880
Nobody died on that ride, at least.

1611
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:20,320
So no one died.

1612
01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:23,200
But that's a big moment in the documentary where the woman,

1613
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:27,880
the woman who was a lifeguard talks about how one speedboat did not slow down,

1614
01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:29,680
went on top of the other speedboat.

1615
01:23:29,680 --> 01:23:33,600
And that's where the reference she was very concerned that these

1616
01:23:33,920 --> 01:23:37,520
person underneath was going to be decapitated.

1617
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:41,480
And imagine you just got a little cut, a little.

1618
01:23:41,720 --> 01:23:45,280
Well, the propeller, the motor was cutting into their neck

1619
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:48,240
and she was worried the hair, like whatever mullet this guy had,

1620
01:23:48,240 --> 01:23:51,040
because, you know, the era was going to get pulled up into this thing

1621
01:23:51,040 --> 01:23:53,440
and get like scalped or something.

1622
01:23:53,440 --> 01:23:55,960
But that that ride was was nuts.

1623
01:23:55,960 --> 01:23:58,680
And that position we talked about briefly in the movie,

1624
01:23:59,040 --> 01:24:02,120
but working being a lifeguard on that ride was the worst job.

1625
01:24:02,320 --> 01:24:03,760
That was like you're being punished.

1626
01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:05,360
Nobody likes you.

1627
01:24:05,360 --> 01:24:06,240
You're not connected.

1628
01:24:06,240 --> 01:24:08,000
You're like not part of the cool kid clique.

1629
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:11,800
You're the lifeguard on the speedboats, because if you had to pull somebody out,

1630
01:24:12,040 --> 01:24:16,720
you're diving into a pond just like full of snakes and oil, just like snakes and oil.

1631
01:24:17,560 --> 01:24:21,000
All right. So do we know what was

1632
01:24:21,560 --> 01:24:26,160
do we know what has like changed like in the local government

1633
01:24:26,560 --> 01:24:31,720
now there that would prevent snakes and oil being in a pond

1634
01:24:31,720 --> 01:24:33,520
that people would have to go in?

1635
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:36,880
I honestly feel like there's no law in the books against that.

1636
01:24:37,200 --> 01:24:40,240
So, you know, I feel like I don't think there's a law about that.

1637
01:24:40,240 --> 01:24:41,360
So you could probably get away with that.

1638
01:24:41,360 --> 01:24:46,520
By the way, so it's snakes and oil is what evil Ringo Starr wishes.

1639
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:49,880
Snakes and oil, everyone.

1640
01:24:49,880 --> 01:24:50,920
It's oil.

1641
01:24:50,920 --> 01:24:56,640
Oil. They got a man from the snake, oil salesman.

1642
01:24:56,640 --> 01:24:58,160
I don't know. There's something.

1643
01:24:58,160 --> 01:25:00,800
Oh, yeah, not to say, oh, it's no, it's not.

1644
01:25:01,040 --> 01:25:03,560
You misheard me. It's not snake oil in the water.

1645
01:25:03,560 --> 01:25:06,360
It's snake and oil.

1646
01:25:06,360 --> 01:25:07,680
Snake, oil sales.

1647
01:25:07,680 --> 01:25:09,640
The oil is not from the guy who filled this.

1648
01:25:11,920 --> 01:25:13,920
Yeah, we filled the pond up with the wrong stuff, guys. Sorry.

1649
01:25:15,160 --> 01:25:19,120
That was the big like revelation for me in the documentary,

1650
01:25:19,920 --> 01:25:23,480
because I think I first heard about it on the best show.

1651
01:25:23,480 --> 01:25:26,800
You're in Tom Sharpling talk about Traction Park and the looping

1652
01:25:27,080 --> 01:25:30,960
waterslide and and all the stories about that.

1653
01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:34,920
But I it didn't dawn on me that like, oh, the town,

1654
01:25:35,400 --> 01:25:39,600
not only like it wasn't that they ignored it, like they they full on

1655
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:43,800
like tolerated it and it brought a bunch of money into the town.

1656
01:25:44,440 --> 01:25:46,120
Yes. Yes.

1657
01:25:46,120 --> 01:25:49,040
Imagine like this parks been open, not just the park, but the ski resort

1658
01:25:49,040 --> 01:25:53,080
prior to that have been open for 15 whatever years more than that

1659
01:25:53,320 --> 01:25:55,320
and just dominates the local economy.

1660
01:25:55,320 --> 01:25:57,720
You know, it's the biggest employer in town.

1661
01:25:57,720 --> 01:26:01,440
All the foot traffic, kind of a million people a year just like shopping

1662
01:26:01,440 --> 01:26:04,800
at your stores, like paying your tolls, whatever it's going to be.

1663
01:26:05,240 --> 01:26:06,960
What do you do if that shuts down?

1664
01:26:06,960 --> 01:26:08,240
Like, what do you do?

1665
01:26:08,240 --> 01:26:11,040
And it's like it's like the, you know, the factory leaving town

1666
01:26:11,040 --> 01:26:11,800
is what it'd be like.

1667
01:26:11,800 --> 01:26:16,880
So that resulted in, I think, a very high level of risk tolerance,

1668
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:19,120
we'll say, from the town for what the park had to offer.

1669
01:26:19,720 --> 01:26:23,560
It's so funny that it wasn't just like, well, we like having a park here.

1670
01:26:23,800 --> 01:26:25,960
Just take the snakes and oil out of the water.

1671
01:26:26,080 --> 01:26:29,280
Like, just make a few changes.

1672
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:30,840
Why not?

1673
01:26:31,720 --> 01:26:36,440
You think the very I don't think it's a kind of park where without.

1674
01:26:36,880 --> 01:26:40,800
OK, so now it's open under a different name and they got rid of most of the rides.

1675
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:43,880
But at its peak, it was the they claimed it was the largest water park in the world.

1676
01:26:43,880 --> 01:26:46,360
And more than 75 rides and attractions.

1677
01:26:46,360 --> 01:26:48,040
That's like a lot of stuff.

1678
01:26:48,040 --> 01:26:51,320
And the vast majority of them were, I think, what Ralph Nader

1679
01:26:51,320 --> 01:26:53,160
would have called like unsafe at any speed.

1680
01:26:53,200 --> 01:26:55,120
Like, there's no fixing that.

1681
01:26:55,120 --> 01:26:58,640
There's no way to like, we'll just pay attention and this will be safe.

1682
01:26:58,640 --> 01:27:02,640
Like there's something like innately flawed with the design or the concept of it

1683
01:27:03,080 --> 01:27:04,800
that was going to get people hurt.

1684
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:07,440
You couldn't just be like, we're going to pay a little bit more attention now.

1685
01:27:07,840 --> 01:27:09,800
It was messy. Right.

1686
01:27:09,800 --> 01:27:13,400
Like have more than half the rides were like unfixable.

1687
01:27:13,400 --> 01:27:15,680
It would be like, well, we can't plus up the ride

1688
01:27:15,680 --> 01:27:20,120
where we just hand you a bag of rocks and you sink to the bottom of a 30 foot pool.

1689
01:27:20,840 --> 01:27:22,560
We're plusing up this ride by not killing it.

1690
01:27:22,560 --> 01:27:27,880
Like it was a really it was a wild place after the park was shut down in 96.

1691
01:27:27,880 --> 01:27:32,000
And the purchase in 98 by Intra West, which owns like Whistler Mountain.

1692
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:33,960
They mostly bought it for the ski resort.

1693
01:27:33,960 --> 01:27:36,320
They kept the Alpine slide open for one year.

1694
01:27:36,680 --> 01:27:39,080
And they forced you to wear a helmet and sign a waiver.

1695
01:27:39,320 --> 01:27:42,920
And I think that that only lasted one year in that form.

1696
01:27:42,920 --> 01:27:44,640
I think they realized like either.

1697
01:27:44,640 --> 01:27:45,600
Yeah, this is too much.

1698
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:48,760
Or that defeats the whole spirit of the Alpine slide.

1699
01:27:48,760 --> 01:27:50,160
Maybe I don't know.

1700
01:27:50,200 --> 01:27:56,960
It's also so crazy that, OK, so the first death occurs in 1980, 1981,

1701
01:27:57,840 --> 01:28:02,520
the first of six all told, and then it's not closed till 96.

1702
01:28:02,760 --> 01:28:04,080
And that has nothing to do with it.

1703
01:28:04,080 --> 01:28:06,600
They just ran out of money. Nothing.

1704
01:28:06,600 --> 01:28:08,680
Yeah. And if you ask like, yeah.

1705
01:28:08,680 --> 01:28:11,960
And I think the death count, which is, you know, single digits,

1706
01:28:11,960 --> 01:28:15,960
I don't really think that was justice to how incredibly dangerous the park was.

1707
01:28:16,280 --> 01:28:19,520
I think it's the injuries and like there should have been many, many more deaths.

1708
01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:21,920
There just should have been on any given day.

1709
01:28:21,920 --> 01:28:25,280
The Alpine slide alone would injure hundreds of people a day.

1710
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:32,440
One ride, one day, triple digit injuries every single day, day in and day out.

1711
01:28:32,680 --> 01:28:36,680
And I think that to me is a lot more astonishing than than the number of deaths.

1712
01:28:36,680 --> 01:28:41,800
I think it's crazy in with the horrible things in our world with Covid-19

1713
01:28:41,800 --> 01:28:46,240
and with in mass shootings and stuff that people find comfort in.

1714
01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:48,280
Oh, well, there was only this many deaths.

1715
01:28:48,280 --> 01:28:51,440
Don't worry. There were injuries or they didn't die.

1716
01:28:51,640 --> 01:28:53,240
You know, that's still horrible.

1717
01:28:53,240 --> 01:28:55,760
Like people are scarred, scarred physically, mentally.

1718
01:28:55,760 --> 01:28:59,360
But you kind of gloss over injuries in general.

1719
01:29:00,680 --> 01:29:02,040
Yeah, we don't want to minimize that.

1720
01:29:02,040 --> 01:29:05,000
And, you know, I think that was that was like sort of the purpose of our movie was,

1721
01:29:05,240 --> 01:29:09,880
you know, Action Park has become this like urban legend and to some degree a joke

1722
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:13,520
because it's so surreal and absurd that it exists.

1723
01:29:13,520 --> 01:29:17,080
I like the only response your body can make after reading about Action

1724
01:29:17,080 --> 01:29:20,480
Park is to laugh because it kind of short circuits your brain a little

1725
01:29:20,480 --> 01:29:22,040
like the mere existence of it.

1726
01:29:22,040 --> 01:29:25,880
And one of the big purposes, the goals of our movie was to kind of go beyond

1727
01:29:25,880 --> 01:29:28,040
that a little and figure out like what was the actual cost here?

1728
01:29:28,040 --> 01:29:28,720
What was the toll?

1729
01:29:28,720 --> 01:29:32,480
What stories are being kind of like swept under the rug in service

1730
01:29:32,760 --> 01:29:34,880
of this myth and service of this legend?

1731
01:29:35,120 --> 01:29:38,120
And as you saw in the movie, we spoke to the family of a kid

1732
01:29:38,120 --> 01:29:41,000
who was killed there, who kind of walked us through the beat

1733
01:29:41,040 --> 01:29:45,880
by beats of like what happened to them after their son died, like what went wrong

1734
01:29:45,880 --> 01:29:48,040
and then how the park responded to it?

1735
01:29:48,040 --> 01:29:49,560
That's kind of horrifying.

1736
01:29:49,560 --> 01:29:52,240
Like, it's very scary. Yeah.

1737
01:29:53,120 --> 01:29:55,560
Yeah. That's not to put a damper on the funnies.

1738
01:29:55,600 --> 01:29:58,440
Well, that's what's weird is what you have to do.

1739
01:29:58,440 --> 01:30:02,040
And like, like, so was that tough in the documentary to

1740
01:30:02,560 --> 01:30:04,760
make that turn and have that balance?

1741
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:09,680
I mean, it became the whole purpose of the movie was this really sudden turn

1742
01:30:09,680 --> 01:30:12,040
that we want to do. And it kind of think a lot of people by surprise.

1743
01:30:12,040 --> 01:30:14,840
And it's something I think people, you don't really see that much in movies, I'll say.

1744
01:30:14,840 --> 01:30:17,440
But it was it was kind of whiplashy by design

1745
01:30:18,720 --> 01:30:22,200
as, you know, as sort of response to the legend and myth that actually

1746
01:30:22,480 --> 01:30:26,400
also because like not to like over explain my own movie.

1747
01:30:26,400 --> 01:30:30,400
But I mean, say you are at Action Park and you're having like the best time

1748
01:30:30,400 --> 01:30:33,760
of your life and actually work with a place capable of giving you immense

1749
01:30:33,760 --> 01:30:37,120
thrills, immense joy, immense happiness, immense memories, immense all these good

1750
01:30:37,120 --> 01:30:40,760
things. The distance between that experience

1751
01:30:41,480 --> 01:30:44,840
and and getting seriously injured or even dying is like one second.

1752
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:47,480
Like there is no foreshadowing.

1753
01:30:47,680 --> 01:30:51,040
There's no there's no telegraphing it. It just like happens suddenly.

1754
01:30:51,280 --> 01:30:55,520
And that was sort of the idea there was like, this is the most fun

1755
01:30:55,520 --> 01:30:58,960
you've had until the minute it's not is what Action Park was.

1756
01:30:59,680 --> 01:31:03,280
Yeah, right. Yeah, there was no because I yeah, if you were there,

1757
01:31:03,920 --> 01:31:07,800
the people that were there were probably not like us and not like like

1758
01:31:07,920 --> 01:31:12,440
nervous all time. They were like having fun and then something goes horribly,

1759
01:31:12,440 --> 01:31:13,440
horribly wrong.

1760
01:31:13,880 --> 01:31:16,320
And we're incredibly desensitized to it.

1761
01:31:16,320 --> 01:31:19,440
You know, unless you're actually seeing somebody get killed, you're you're very

1762
01:31:19,440 --> 01:31:22,000
likely going to see people get injured while you're at the park.

1763
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:23,880
It just happens constantly.

1764
01:31:23,880 --> 01:31:27,920
Like when you take the Alpine slide ski lift up, the chances are really good.

1765
01:31:27,920 --> 01:31:31,040
You'd see somebody wipe out as you're going up, just like see somebody wipe out.

1766
01:31:31,360 --> 01:31:35,080
That would happen. And yeah, so that's what I was saying earlier.

1767
01:31:35,080 --> 01:31:38,360
I'm fascinated by human behavior like that.

1768
01:31:38,560 --> 01:31:43,920
And I think you can apply it to like Covid and masks and you can apply it to.

1769
01:31:43,920 --> 01:31:47,240
Are you telling me that Action Park is a metaphor for Covid?

1770
01:31:47,320 --> 01:31:48,400
Is that what you're telling me?

1771
01:31:48,400 --> 01:31:52,120
I first look, I don't I don't I don't make conclusions.

1772
01:31:52,520 --> 01:31:55,680
The listeners of our podcast do that. I don't tell them what to do.

1773
01:31:55,680 --> 01:31:58,440
Are you telling me that? Tell me what a metaphor is.

1774
01:31:59,200 --> 01:32:00,720
Just keep hearing this word.

1775
01:32:00,720 --> 01:32:03,000
This literary device. It's very fancy.

1776
01:32:03,280 --> 01:32:05,440
It's like a simile. It's very similar to a simile.

1777
01:32:05,880 --> 01:32:11,040
Are you telling me that a place, a place where the where the forces of fun

1778
01:32:11,040 --> 01:32:16,720
and freedom in air quotes are up against common sense and safety

1779
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:19,920
is a metaphor for anything we're all experiencing today?

1780
01:32:19,920 --> 01:32:21,120
Is that what you're telling me?

1781
01:32:21,120 --> 01:32:24,640
I might be walking down the road, but I wouldn't tell you anything.

1782
01:32:24,640 --> 01:32:27,960
I'm walking down that road for sure.

1783
01:32:27,960 --> 01:32:31,160
But it is interesting because I think we all in general in our lives

1784
01:32:31,160 --> 01:32:35,680
have to do a lot of this ignoring stuff.

1785
01:32:35,800 --> 01:32:38,000
You can't have all this stuff in your head.

1786
01:32:38,360 --> 01:32:42,240
You'll be like this is just general, like whether it's, you know,

1787
01:32:42,440 --> 01:32:46,320
the chance of you, I don't know, getting in a car accident or something like this.

1788
01:32:46,320 --> 01:32:48,440
You just have to put all this stuff out of your mind.

1789
01:32:48,440 --> 01:32:53,680
But to see constant accidents and you're like, huh, OK,

1790
01:32:53,760 --> 01:32:55,000
I'm going to go on that ride now.

1791
01:32:55,000 --> 01:33:00,640
Choose to go to a hot spot, essentially of accidents and injury potential. Yeah.

1792
01:33:01,160 --> 01:33:03,840
That's like that's like a supercharged version of what I'm saying,

1793
01:33:03,840 --> 01:33:06,160
where you just have to sort of put out the fact that like something bad

1794
01:33:06,160 --> 01:33:09,040
is going to happen to all of us at some time.

1795
01:33:09,440 --> 01:33:11,320
But we just got to go on with life.

1796
01:33:11,320 --> 01:33:14,960
That's what's so interesting about Action Park is for people who aren't from the area,

1797
01:33:14,960 --> 01:33:18,520
this seems like this crazy, absurd, how could this possibly have existed thing

1798
01:33:18,800 --> 01:33:21,600
that people grew up there? It was so normal.

1799
01:33:21,920 --> 01:33:24,280
It was just so, so, so normal.

1800
01:33:24,480 --> 01:33:28,320
And that is what's so weird to me about it is I and I think

1801
01:33:28,720 --> 01:33:31,840
the whole city of New Jersey, I think, like is super into this movie

1802
01:33:32,120 --> 01:33:35,640
because it gives them this like validation, like, see how tough we are.

1803
01:33:35,640 --> 01:33:37,200
This is what we grew up with.

1804
01:33:37,200 --> 01:33:39,360
But it wasn't just that.

1805
01:33:39,360 --> 01:33:41,360
I mean, New Jersey was a weird New Jersey.

1806
01:33:41,360 --> 01:33:43,240
It was a weird place.

1807
01:33:43,240 --> 01:33:46,440
And even if you weren't from New Jersey, like just growing up in the 80s,

1808
01:33:46,440 --> 01:33:50,040
people were doing stupid stuff and like getting hurt and running around.

1809
01:33:50,280 --> 01:33:54,320
And today, everything about that seems so foreign and so absurd

1810
01:33:54,320 --> 01:33:57,320
because we have like cell phones now and kids aren't like nobody's outside.

1811
01:33:57,320 --> 01:34:00,760
Period now. But and just how normal this all was.

1812
01:34:01,040 --> 01:34:04,200
And it wasn't just like the injuries and what not at Action Park.

1813
01:34:04,200 --> 01:34:06,880
Working at Action Park, you're in this small cow town.

1814
01:34:07,080 --> 01:34:08,840
Suddenly becomes this major tourist destination.

1815
01:34:08,840 --> 01:34:11,960
A million people a year coming in and just the things that happen

1816
01:34:11,960 --> 01:34:14,240
when that many people come in and what you're exposed to.

1817
01:34:14,240 --> 01:34:16,240
So there's employees is going to get dark.

1818
01:34:16,240 --> 01:34:19,040
I'm sorry, guys. But so there's like employees who I spoke to,

1819
01:34:19,040 --> 01:34:20,760
like 15, 16 years old.

1820
01:34:20,760 --> 01:34:22,440
They're working the front gate.

1821
01:34:22,440 --> 01:34:26,720
There was an oil tanker like like upturned,

1822
01:34:26,720 --> 01:34:29,040
like an accident, like right outside the gates of the park.

1823
01:34:29,320 --> 01:34:32,520
And the cab got trapped underneath the tanker.

1824
01:34:32,880 --> 01:34:35,280
And they couldn't use the jaws of life to get the guy out

1825
01:34:35,280 --> 01:34:37,800
because it would have sparked and caused an explosion.

1826
01:34:37,800 --> 01:34:40,840
So these like teenage employers are watching this guy who just like

1827
01:34:41,080 --> 01:34:45,160
knows he's about to die and like how like what that does to you.

1828
01:34:45,160 --> 01:34:47,680
And now they laugh about it and they joke about it

1829
01:34:47,680 --> 01:34:49,600
because there's like really no other response.

1830
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:53,080
The human body is just like capable of doing when faced with that

1831
01:34:53,240 --> 01:34:56,560
while still going on with your life, while still, you know, waking up

1832
01:34:56,560 --> 01:34:59,240
in the morning and like going through your life.

1833
01:34:59,240 --> 01:35:04,320
Right. Our brains do gymnastics a lot of times, either to just mask

1834
01:35:04,320 --> 01:35:09,440
like crazy trauma like that or just, you know, if it's just like

1835
01:35:09,440 --> 01:35:13,000
you're normally at a park where people are flying off the slide, you go, huh?

1836
01:35:13,360 --> 01:35:15,040
That guy got hurt really bad.

1837
01:35:15,040 --> 01:35:17,440
Here I go. And I think it's really.

1838
01:35:17,440 --> 01:35:21,280
Yeah, it's important because when we like joke about action park,

1839
01:35:21,640 --> 01:35:23,640
get there, put this really well in the movie.

1840
01:35:23,640 --> 01:35:25,440
But nobody's joking about it.

1841
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:27,840
Who went there because they think this was good.

1842
01:35:28,080 --> 01:35:30,640
They're joking about it because that's the only response

1843
01:35:30,640 --> 01:35:35,000
the human brain is like capable of doing when something short circuits it like that.

1844
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,480
Like what is like laughter from like an evolutionary perspective?

1845
01:35:37,480 --> 01:35:42,000
It's I just miss like narrowly escaping a saber to tiger.

1846
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:43,560
You laugh about that's like what it is.

1847
01:35:43,560 --> 01:35:47,400
And I think that bit of like it is such a weird, strange type of laughter

1848
01:35:47,680 --> 01:35:52,520
that is sort of not really as common as like, you know,

1849
01:35:52,640 --> 01:35:55,520
designed comedy and things that are designed to make you laugh

1850
01:35:55,760 --> 01:35:58,600
or that kind of tap into that same instinct are.

1851
01:35:58,720 --> 01:36:00,960
But it's there and it's present and it's real.

1852
01:36:01,080 --> 01:36:03,280
And I think it's like it's so weird.

1853
01:36:03,280 --> 01:36:06,200
And that's what makes action like such an unshakable topic to me

1854
01:36:06,320 --> 01:36:08,960
is that it kind of elicits that sort of laughter response.

1855
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:12,760
Well, it seems like a lot of the people in the documentary are

1856
01:36:13,640 --> 01:36:17,080
tacitly acknowledging the old adage about like

1857
01:36:17,360 --> 01:36:19,680
tragedy plus time is comedy.

1858
01:36:19,680 --> 01:36:20,240
Yes.

1859
01:36:20,360 --> 01:36:23,800
But then there are plenty of people in the documentary who it's just, well, no,

1860
01:36:23,800 --> 01:36:28,040
it's just tragedy plus time is just that it's just more tragedy.

1861
01:36:28,280 --> 01:36:31,600
I just keep thinking about the tragedy, you know,

1862
01:36:31,760 --> 01:36:34,120
tragedy plus time plus like a little bit of distance.

1863
01:36:34,120 --> 01:36:37,880
Like if it wasn't you or somebody super close to you, I think it's what it was.

1864
01:36:37,920 --> 01:36:39,920
Yeah. Yeah.

1865
01:36:39,920 --> 01:36:40,880
It's a weird place.

1866
01:36:40,880 --> 01:36:45,400
Well, the, you know, the Mulvahills have a comment on all this.

1867
01:36:45,440 --> 01:36:48,520
The the the son who wrote a book and kind of was

1868
01:36:48,640 --> 01:36:52,640
attempted to be front and center when they tried to do the park again.

1869
01:36:52,640 --> 01:36:54,160
And he's kind of kept the legend alive.

1870
01:36:54,160 --> 01:36:56,720
I think this is also from the Sports Illustrated article.

1871
01:36:57,720 --> 01:37:00,600
He says, as for the people who died,

1872
01:37:00,600 --> 01:37:05,000
I'm sure Dad has gone and looked for each and every one of them to say he's sorry.

1873
01:37:06,040 --> 01:37:08,040
All right. Yeah, sure.

1874
01:37:08,040 --> 01:37:09,080
Yeah, OK.

1875
01:37:11,080 --> 01:37:12,800
That's that settles that.

1876
01:37:12,800 --> 01:37:16,280
He certainly seemed like an apologetic man

1877
01:37:17,200 --> 01:37:18,480
in his day to day.

1878
01:37:18,480 --> 01:37:19,600
A client to participate.

1879
01:37:19,600 --> 01:37:23,520
And he's like, what if he's in heaven trying to sue these people more?

1880
01:37:24,600 --> 01:37:26,480
I'm suing you under heaven laws.

1881
01:37:26,480 --> 01:37:28,600
The you. Oh, oh.

1882
01:37:28,600 --> 01:37:29,800
So this wasn't a movie.

1883
01:37:29,800 --> 01:37:33,160
Oh, man, the stories that kind of just filled my inbox after the movie came out.

1884
01:37:33,320 --> 01:37:37,680
So we talk in a movie about how if you manage to sue, manage to win,

1885
01:37:38,120 --> 01:37:41,920
like Jean just wouldn't pay unless the US marshals literally collected the money.

1886
01:37:42,440 --> 01:37:46,040
A lawyer reached out to me who was like a client who had that happened to him.

1887
01:37:46,280 --> 01:37:49,480
And how they had to get the US marshals to show up.

1888
01:37:49,480 --> 01:37:51,960
But they had this big problem because the US marshals collected.

1889
01:37:52,160 --> 01:37:54,880
It literally went from like ticket booth to ticket booth, collecting cash

1890
01:37:55,320 --> 01:37:57,200
and put into a duffel bag.

1891
01:37:57,200 --> 01:37:59,720
When a duffel bag was the US marshal duffel bag

1892
01:37:59,720 --> 01:38:02,120
and they weren't allowed to hand over US marshal property.

1893
01:38:02,320 --> 01:38:06,840
So this lawyer had to like go window shopping until he found another duffel bag.

1894
01:38:07,040 --> 01:38:11,360
The stuff all this cash into and then take gets to the bank

1895
01:38:11,360 --> 01:38:14,320
and like try to deposit like half a million dollars or whatever in cash.

1896
01:38:14,600 --> 01:38:15,680
Wow.

1897
01:38:15,880 --> 01:38:17,440
Wow. Do you have enough?

1898
01:38:17,440 --> 01:38:19,520
You've given us a lot of stuff that's not in the movie.

1899
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:23,000
But now that you're getting all these stories, do you have enough for like a follow up

1900
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:25,160
as far as just a movie full of stories?

1901
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:29,000
I mean, yeah, there's a movie full of stories, but what's the story?

1902
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:30,960
You know, so, yeah, right.

1903
01:38:30,960 --> 01:38:35,320
It's at least supplemental material on a DVD or Blu Ray release.

1904
01:38:35,320 --> 01:38:38,040
Oh, man. If only we had like DVDs with supplemental material.

1905
01:38:38,040 --> 01:38:39,560
I would have had so much fun with this.

1906
01:38:39,560 --> 01:38:40,800
There was a lot.

1907
01:38:40,800 --> 01:38:43,040
I mean, it just seems like ever.

1908
01:38:43,600 --> 01:38:46,480
This is going to sound corny, but like everyone who went had a story.

1909
01:38:46,800 --> 01:38:49,040
Everybody who went had a story or like 10.

1910
01:38:49,040 --> 01:38:50,800
And like, yeah, right.

1911
01:38:50,800 --> 01:38:53,080
And it's so weird, like you look at like the Wikipedia page

1912
01:38:53,080 --> 01:38:55,200
and like the stories that kind of become the action park

1913
01:38:55,200 --> 01:38:59,840
lore and the actual canon and just like that's just like such a tip of the iceberg.

1914
01:38:59,840 --> 01:39:03,520
And most of those come from a couple like Weird New Jersey articles.

1915
01:39:03,520 --> 01:39:06,600
That's like patient zero, like ground zero for most of the action park.

1916
01:39:06,600 --> 01:39:09,080
Lore was like Weird New Jersey's coverage.

1917
01:39:09,080 --> 01:39:12,640
If you look at the citations on the wiki page, it's like 90 percent weird.

1918
01:39:12,640 --> 01:39:15,000
New Jersey stuff is like all it is.

1919
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:17,400
And that's just talking to a couple of employees for those articles.

1920
01:39:17,400 --> 01:39:19,880
You talk to any employee, they have just as many stories.

1921
01:39:20,120 --> 01:39:23,360
And now after the movie came out, I'm like I was invited to these

1922
01:39:23,840 --> 01:39:26,480
secret Facebook groups that are all former action park employees.

1923
01:39:26,480 --> 01:39:28,120
And it's like a thousand people in them.

1924
01:39:28,120 --> 01:39:30,840
And it's just like gold, man. It's gold.

1925
01:39:31,600 --> 01:39:33,840
It's wild stuff. Yeah.

1926
01:39:33,840 --> 01:39:36,800
I you know, I have I was goofing a little bit on the Valencia

1927
01:39:36,800 --> 01:39:41,680
teens who run Six Flags Magic Mountain, but they look like saints and angels,

1928
01:39:41,680 --> 01:39:45,680
I think, compared to fairy level precision operating.

1929
01:39:47,040 --> 01:39:50,120
I mean, I don't think those Valencia teens next time I see them. Yeah.

1930
01:39:50,120 --> 01:39:51,840
And I don't want to bash the teens who work there.

1931
01:39:51,840 --> 01:39:54,880
I mean, they they were all put in the tough spot.

1932
01:39:55,240 --> 01:39:57,960
Yeah. And yeah, they were just living their lives.

1933
01:39:57,960 --> 01:39:59,760
They were coming of age. They were doing their thing.

1934
01:39:59,760 --> 01:40:02,960
I don't think anybody can like blame the 15 year old kid

1935
01:40:03,160 --> 01:40:05,440
for all the stuff that's going on around them.

1936
01:40:05,600 --> 01:40:07,440
It just becomes normal.

1937
01:40:07,440 --> 01:40:11,520
They partied, man. Those kids partied, by the way, like like they would regularly

1938
01:40:11,520 --> 01:40:15,400
just like show up to work three days in a row with the same shirt on either

1939
01:40:15,400 --> 01:40:19,200
sleeping at the park after a party, sleeping in some random condo

1940
01:40:19,200 --> 01:40:22,680
because like all the condos that surround the park, different people like access

1941
01:40:22,680 --> 01:40:26,360
to them, so they use them as like crash pads or just, you know,

1942
01:40:26,880 --> 01:40:30,560
partying all night and then like go to work the next day at like age 16.

1943
01:40:30,560 --> 01:40:32,680
Sleeping at the top of the cannonball loop.

1944
01:40:34,200 --> 01:40:37,360
And then it just hot boxing the entire loop.

1945
01:40:37,840 --> 01:40:40,160
Hot boxing the loop.

1946
01:40:41,520 --> 01:40:44,560
Just goes in the bottom of it and just fill it up with smoke.

1947
01:40:45,120 --> 01:40:47,800
And they already had to worry about the normal problems.

1948
01:40:47,800 --> 01:40:51,840
Jersey teens have to worry about cruising down Highway nine,

1949
01:40:52,760 --> 01:40:56,920
working on their cars, learning that they blew up the chicken man in Philly last night.

1950
01:40:57,200 --> 01:41:01,080
You know, that's Nebraska, not Jersey, I think.

1951
01:41:01,600 --> 01:41:05,000
But no, wait, no.

1952
01:41:05,040 --> 01:41:07,280
But that was way too much.

1953
01:41:07,280 --> 01:41:08,880
But also the tan and the hair.

1954
01:41:08,880 --> 01:41:11,200
I don't know. It was it was a strange place.

1955
01:41:11,200 --> 01:41:15,120
And it's really amazing speaking to the place people live there who live this,

1956
01:41:15,120 --> 01:41:20,440
who like grew up working there and how fond they all are of this place.

1957
01:41:20,440 --> 01:41:23,440
And you kind of some degree, I think it's like a little bit of Stockholm syndrome.

1958
01:41:23,680 --> 01:41:26,920
But to some degree, it's I think we all kind of take whatever we went through

1959
01:41:26,920 --> 01:41:30,280
and we internalize it and we make, you know, this is this is our childhood.

1960
01:41:30,760 --> 01:41:32,200
It's a weird place.

1961
01:41:32,200 --> 01:41:38,280
Yeah. Did did do we know did Springsteen or even Southside Johnny go to Action Park?

1962
01:41:38,360 --> 01:41:42,640
OK, I am sure that like like everybody did.

1963
01:41:42,680 --> 01:41:45,360
Like from this area, it was what you did.

1964
01:41:45,360 --> 01:41:46,400
It was what you did.

1965
01:41:46,400 --> 01:41:50,920
Like like Fallon mentioned on the show the other day, like I know that

1966
01:41:51,720 --> 01:41:53,480
like I know that Kimmel went there.

1967
01:41:53,480 --> 01:41:56,640
Everybody who grew up like Springsteen had to have gone there. Right.

1968
01:41:56,640 --> 01:41:58,080
Like there's no way older.

1969
01:41:58,080 --> 01:41:59,960
He's he's another little older.

1970
01:41:59,960 --> 01:42:04,640
So maybe not. But he was I mean, he was he was still like very

1971
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:06,720
he's probably very popular by the time this open.

1972
01:42:07,120 --> 01:42:10,280
At least one member of the East Street band went there, I would bet.

1973
01:42:10,760 --> 01:42:11,440
At least one member.

1974
01:42:11,440 --> 01:42:13,480
We think it was.

1975
01:42:13,480 --> 01:42:16,960
It was it was a little I don't think it was a little Stephen.

1976
01:42:17,360 --> 01:42:19,160
I don't think was it Weinberg?

1977
01:42:19,160 --> 01:42:21,760
It doesn't seem like Max Weinberg seen either.

1978
01:42:21,760 --> 01:42:24,360
He Max is probably the most likely. Yeah.

1979
01:42:24,640 --> 01:42:28,240
Little Stephen probably broadcast it.

1980
01:42:28,240 --> 01:42:33,160
Little Stephen's garage from the reopen renamed cleaned up version.

1981
01:42:33,640 --> 01:42:36,400
All right. We're going to do some I'm going to do some research and figure this out.

1982
01:42:37,040 --> 01:42:41,160
He's got a built in difficulty, though, which is you don't want to get a bandana

1983
01:42:41,160 --> 01:42:42,640
caught in one of these slides.

1984
01:42:42,640 --> 01:42:44,080
I was thinking about that.

1985
01:42:44,080 --> 01:42:46,800
Like once your bandana gets why you won't wear a mask on rides out,

1986
01:42:46,800 --> 01:42:49,880
because like it gets wet, that that cramps your style.

1987
01:42:50,240 --> 01:42:53,280
Like how do you how do you go down on a looping water slide in a bandana?

1988
01:42:53,280 --> 01:42:55,880
And little Stephen is just full of scarves as well.

1989
01:42:55,880 --> 01:42:58,480
So he has the bandana and the scarves.

1990
01:42:58,480 --> 01:42:59,960
They're fused to him now.

1991
01:42:59,960 --> 01:43:02,080
So he can't exactly take them off.

1992
01:43:02,760 --> 01:43:05,200
Maybe that's where they come from, is the scars.

1993
01:43:06,160 --> 01:43:07,720
It's very possible.

1994
01:43:07,720 --> 01:43:12,200
Yeah. So he's got to stay out of the slides and he's got to stay out of that.

1995
01:43:12,760 --> 01:43:15,520
If he gets yanked into a turbine, then he's like

1996
01:43:16,400 --> 01:43:19,200
then he stays down there with the snakes and oil.

1997
01:43:19,200 --> 01:43:21,440
Yeah. You guys throw me a ride name.

1998
01:43:21,440 --> 01:43:23,760
I'll give you a story that nobody's heard.

1999
01:43:23,760 --> 01:43:28,640
We missed what's the the one that's spelled weird, the aqua scoot.

2000
01:43:28,840 --> 01:43:31,840
I think that's one that hasn't been name checked yet.

2001
01:43:31,840 --> 01:43:33,320
OK, there's nothing too crazy about that.

2002
01:43:33,320 --> 01:43:35,400
It did. It was kind of a messy ride.

2003
01:43:35,400 --> 01:43:37,120
That was OK. Actually, I'll tell you something about that.

2004
01:43:37,120 --> 01:43:39,480
That was like warehouse rollers on an angle.

2005
01:43:39,480 --> 01:43:42,240
And you take this car, you try to skip across the pond like a stone.

2006
01:43:42,480 --> 01:43:45,400
That was actually created by the same guy who made the man in the ball

2007
01:43:45,400 --> 01:43:48,400
and the ball, the same the same dude made that one.

2008
01:43:48,640 --> 01:43:50,640
That right actually made it the prime time, though.

2009
01:43:50,920 --> 01:43:54,600
A lot of people got got like their toes like cotton and stuff.

2010
01:43:54,600 --> 01:43:56,080
Nothing. That's like the most team right.

2011
01:43:56,080 --> 01:43:58,160
Come on, give me another one. Only your toe.

2012
01:43:58,440 --> 01:44:02,080
Oh, man. Wait, what have we not named checks?

2013
01:44:02,800 --> 01:44:04,200
And we've talked about a lot of them.

2014
01:44:04,200 --> 01:44:07,440
What car I have, kamikaze in front of me.

2015
01:44:07,440 --> 01:44:09,360
That's tame, though.

2016
01:44:10,040 --> 01:44:13,880
Kamikaze people, people would people would fly off the kamikaze all the time,

2017
01:44:13,880 --> 01:44:17,640
because that was a ride that was built like into the natural slope of the mountain.

2018
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:20,840
And the rails on the side of it were like three inches.

2019
01:44:20,840 --> 01:44:24,200
So people just hit these like lips and they'd fly off.

2020
01:44:24,440 --> 01:44:27,160
And the ride we talked about in the movie, that was like a prototype one

2021
01:44:27,160 --> 01:44:31,400
based off of zero gravity planes where you go over like parabolic hills

2022
01:44:31,400 --> 01:44:35,480
and get some air time was sort of like the amped up version of the kamikaze.

2023
01:44:35,680 --> 01:44:39,280
I think once they realized people were getting air and flying off the kamikaze,

2024
01:44:39,280 --> 01:44:42,040
they're like, well, let's just like milk that for what it's worth.

2025
01:44:42,080 --> 01:44:44,840
Let's like make that a ride where the goal is to get airtime.

2026
01:44:46,360 --> 01:44:47,920
Surf Hill.

2027
01:44:47,920 --> 01:44:50,600
Yeah, Sir, feels the one that they hit broke his neck

2028
01:44:50,600 --> 01:44:53,720
after they started building up the jump and just like going

2029
01:44:53,720 --> 01:44:56,000
in the observation stands, all that stuff.

2030
01:44:56,880 --> 01:44:57,600
Mm hmm.

2031
01:44:58,160 --> 01:45:01,160
Um, the whiplash falls.

2032
01:45:01,680 --> 01:45:02,680
I don't even know what that one is.

2033
01:45:02,680 --> 01:45:04,200
I'm just I'm just making them up now.

2034
01:45:04,200 --> 01:45:05,160
I'm just trying.

2035
01:45:05,160 --> 01:45:08,760
So they had a lot of rides that like don't get much attention.

2036
01:45:08,760 --> 01:45:11,520
Like if you look at old park maps, you're like, what was that?

2037
01:45:11,520 --> 01:45:13,440
Like they had one called the human maze.

2038
01:45:13,440 --> 01:45:15,280
Like, what's the human maze?

2039
01:45:15,280 --> 01:45:17,280
Nobody talks about the human maze at Action Park.

2040
01:45:17,320 --> 01:45:21,640
Well, that's just what I used to call having a nine to five, the human maze.

2041
01:45:21,880 --> 01:45:24,040
I'm just getting lost.

2042
01:45:24,040 --> 01:45:27,040
This is my life, man. The human maze.

2043
01:45:27,040 --> 01:45:30,960
We're all just trying to navigate the human maze and trying to have some fun

2044
01:45:30,960 --> 01:45:31,760
while we do it.

2045
01:45:31,760 --> 01:45:37,080
And, you know, I I think I enjoyed myself talking about about this old place.

2046
01:45:37,080 --> 01:45:39,000
And I thank you so much for being here.

2047
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:42,440
So the porges, you survived podcast, the ride,

2048
01:45:43,640 --> 01:45:46,880
not as harrowing as a day at Action Park, not in the least.

2049
01:45:47,200 --> 01:45:50,480
Unless that microphone you have is near some water,

2050
01:45:50,600 --> 01:45:53,160
you're some snake oil that could get you.

2051
01:45:53,400 --> 01:45:54,640
I think it's a little too dark.

2052
01:45:54,640 --> 01:45:57,520
Somebody actually did die from electrocution at Action Park.

2053
01:45:58,240 --> 01:46:00,440
Yes. I mean, well, there's a look.

2054
01:46:00,440 --> 01:46:02,280
We've been hovering around darkness.

2055
01:46:02,280 --> 01:46:06,360
I think the world's worst, like improv guy who like, like, yes,

2056
01:46:06,360 --> 01:46:09,360
and somebody died, like just air out of the room.

2057
01:46:09,880 --> 01:46:13,280
You could say when it comes to Vernon, there's certainly darkness

2058
01:46:13,280 --> 01:46:14,920
on the edge of town.

2059
01:46:16,120 --> 01:46:18,360
It's like, hey, everybody has everybody.

2060
01:46:18,360 --> 01:46:19,760
Who did anybody get hurt today?

2061
01:46:19,760 --> 01:46:21,600
It's just Christ. I'm that guy.

2062
01:46:21,640 --> 01:46:23,440
So never invite me to your improv trip, guys.

2063
01:46:25,440 --> 01:46:29,280
Well, it is no longer an art form, so that's not happening anymore.

2064
01:46:29,280 --> 01:46:34,440
So no, it's just for everyone to continue to live.

2065
01:46:35,240 --> 01:46:37,880
Yes. Someone should make a documentary about improv.

2066
01:46:38,200 --> 01:46:40,280
Very funny. Oh, that'd be great.

2067
01:46:40,280 --> 01:46:42,720
Oh, that'd be the problem of great documentaries.

2068
01:46:43,480 --> 01:46:46,640
Anyway, your documentary, I'll do your plugging for you a little bit.

2069
01:46:46,640 --> 01:46:50,200
Your documentaries on HBO Max and it's a little bit of a fun one.

2070
01:46:50,240 --> 01:46:52,840
HBO Max and it's a lot of fun.

2071
01:46:52,840 --> 01:46:55,560
But but is there anything else you would like to plug

2072
01:46:55,560 --> 01:46:58,200
or anything else related to the film?

2073
01:46:58,200 --> 01:46:59,880
No, guys, it's on HBO Max.

2074
01:46:59,880 --> 01:47:03,040
You know, social for me is just like at Seth Porges with a P.

2075
01:47:03,080 --> 01:47:05,920
That's simple. Wonderful.

2076
01:47:05,920 --> 01:47:10,720
And as for us, we are at podcast the ride on the socials.

2080
01:47:23,800 --> 01:47:26,280
I mean, as far as parting words,

2081
01:47:26,280 --> 01:47:29,920
I can't think of anything better than snakes and oil.

2082
01:47:29,920 --> 01:47:33,640
Everyone still oil, oil, oil, oil.

2083
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:38,520
I'm evil Ringo snakes, comma, separate and oil.

2084
01:47:38,800 --> 01:47:41,040
That's new. And everything for us.

2085
01:47:41,040 --> 01:47:43,840
Evil ring. If anyone has art of people, Ringo, feel free.

2086
01:47:43,840 --> 01:47:46,000
I will be signing autographs.

2087
01:47:46,480 --> 01:47:52,040
I start everything snakes, comma oil, everything, everything.

2088
01:47:52,960 --> 01:47:54,240
Opposite peace sign.

2089
01:47:54,240 --> 01:47:57,000
He doesn't do peace sign. He does like this.

2090
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:58,960
He turns them upside down. Inverted.

2091
01:48:00,280 --> 01:48:01,840
It did be sign.

2092
01:48:01,840 --> 01:48:06,840
He wears rings on his toes and are a big brother.

2093
01:48:07,160 --> 01:48:09,080
Don't don't do that on the aqua scoot.

2094
01:48:09,080 --> 01:48:10,720
Don't wear toes in the atmosphere.

2095
01:48:10,720 --> 01:48:11,880
Is that the thing here?

2096
01:48:11,880 --> 01:48:13,480
Everyone else, thanks for listening.

2097
01:48:13,480 --> 01:48:14,480
