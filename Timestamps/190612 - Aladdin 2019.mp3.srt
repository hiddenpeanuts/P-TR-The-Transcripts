00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, the second gate where we have just returned from the exotic

2
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:35,040
kingdom of Agrabah as witnessed in the 2019 remake, live action remake of Aladdin directed by Guy

3
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:44,640
Richie. How do you feel boys? How you doing? I feel like I maybe had a full podcast length of

4
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:51,120
thoughts in me as soon as we left the theater, if we had recorded it from our seats, but in the time

5
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:56,880
it took to leave, get a bite and get over here, which was, you know, what 45 minutes or so it's

6
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:06,160
all gone. This movie is like already vanished from my brain as if Jafar made a wish and made it never

7
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:14,080
happen. As if his infamous red staff vexed you and forced you to forget your opinions.

8
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:21,280
Weld me into a famous, one of his famous spells. Now, one of you was the first one to propose

9
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,280
seeing this movie. I think this was, yeah, I think this may have been my fault.

10
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:35,520
And now I'm, I don't know, buyer's remorse. I walked in thinking it was going to be more of a

11
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:42,720
catastrophe than it was. More of a train wreck than it was. And I have to say there was stuff I liked

12
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:48,960
in it. You know, this isn't, this is our, our, one of our, the newer topical epi, you know, we did

13
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:55,280
galaxy's edge. That was topical, you know, we did the live show and that came out very quickly,

14
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,600
I guess, technically topical and we're doing, we're about to record one, all our thoughts about,

15
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:05,040
you know, the bar subpoena and, you know, we're going to be topical in that regard too. Yes.

16
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,560
You know, we're going to branch away from the theme park stuff a little bit. Sure. But yeah,

17
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,520
for now, this is tangentially related. Yeah. Hey, no, we're getting right to it.

18
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:24,400
Three weeks after the three week. To me, the part, it was funny, like the longer and longer we got

19
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:29,440
away from it, the funnier it got. So you're saying three weeks was the funniest though? No, I'm saying

20
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:34,880
it could be even fine. I'm saying we could put it out six weeks from now. So where would it not be?

21
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:40,160
What time period would it not be funny? And would it be a year after it came out? And any other time

22
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,560
would have been funny. To me, it would have been funny if we did it two years from now. I think

23
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:51,840
that would be very funny because yeah, it's kind of, it feels very ethereal. Well, no, no one will

24
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:58,000
watch this film in two years. Probably not. There will be zero views of this film in 2021.

25
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,560
It is. Yeah. Now. Okay. So let me say something positive, though. Yes. It is good. It is good

26
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:12,320
that a big blockbuster American made movie, uh, it stars a primarily middle Eastern cast

27
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:19,680
in a movie industry that primarily, uh, casts, uh, middle Easterners as the villains, uh, in a country

28
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:25,600
that has a lot of issues with a llama phobia, uh, Islamophobia. I was going to say, is that how you

29
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:32,000
pronounce it? Islamophobia. Um, until we say the word right, we won't be able to solve the problem.

30
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:40,320
Yeah. Uh, uh, it is, it is good that this was such a hit, uh, now. So you saying that it's going to

31
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:46,160
let you be able to trash it guilty conscious, uh, no guilty conscience. I do think that is a positive

32
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:52,000
thing. I don't know why, uh, Lily white British man, Guy Ritchie had to direct it. That was,

33
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,360
I mean, I guess, I don't know. I mean, maybe he was had a passion for telling the story. I don't know.

34
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:03,440
I suppose. Yeah, maybe everybody knew that when Guy Ritchie got his hands on the, if you want to,

35
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:08,000
if you're going to see the famous marketplace through Guy Ritchie's eyes and you're doing

36
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,960
parkour between those alleyways and hopping around on those tents, he's going to bring that to life

37
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:20,080
like you've never seen. And we weren't, we all whisked away. And I, I said, just don't like

38
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:24,640
someone somewhere must've been excited about that. If we, when we get the guy who made that

39
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:30,960
movie like floating away with Madonna, when he gets his, let's get Madonna's ex-husband.

40
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,880
I think that might've been the early, they just wanted to hear Madonna stories. I'm going to say

41
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:40,240
now here's one of my criticisms. Not enough Guy Ritchie indulgent bullshit, like not enough quick

42
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,720
cuts for me. Not enough like, cause I like those two Sherlock Holmes movies. You put that they're

43
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,960
on cable. You put one of those on, you zone out for an hour and a half. You don't have a lot of

44
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:55,760
room in these movies. I don't think there's not a ton of time or time of room for you to like make

45
00:04:55,760 --> 00:05:02,960
changes or no, there was like one Abu bullet time kind of flip where he catches the lamp.

46
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:07,920
There's a slow down. Oh, so by the way, spoilers too, I think, cause we have to spoil the movie.

47
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:13,600
I think, Oh yeah. Well, all right. So spoilers. And with that in mind, Jafar gets too greedy

48
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:20,720
and he ends up becoming a genie and he gets stuck in a lamp forever. Um, big spoilers, big

49
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:28,080
spoilers. I suppose our, is that the genie fucks the genie that is not real. He does not. We don't

50
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:34,080
spread that vicious rumor to the genie fucks. I mean, I guess he eventually does eventually does

51
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,080
fuck. You're right. That's fair, but he's not the genie when it happens. So that is spoiler alert.

52
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:44,720
A former genie. Yes. So tell me about your husband. Well, he has been alive for a thousand years and

53
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:51,440
I met him while I was a servant. And now he's not a, he's been a real man for three years in

54
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:56,640
which time we've had children and now, and he's grown a very handsome beard. Yes. And we see all

55
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:05,360
the world in our nice boat. It's a bookend that is only in, that is a like 0.5% of the runtime of

56
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:10,560
the movie. It's important to know that Will Smith has a beard and sails the world with his children

57
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:17,280
who are named before they exist. Um, and it's all the whole movie is being told from that perspective,

58
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:22,640
except never in the middle or at the end. Yeah. I don't know. I'm interested. Like they were like,

59
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:27,120
well, what's the genie's arc? And this is actually interesting because I thought I actually did see

60
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:32,240
that clip of him like going with his love at the end of the movie, but I wasn't thinking that far

61
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:37,840
because I was hoping that like we could get a whole series of sequels and we could redo return

62
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:43,920
of the, of Jafar and then whatever the third one was called and we get more of this, but it seems

63
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:47,520
like they really cut it off there because it seems like he doesn't have magical powers anymore at the

64
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:52,000
end of the movie. Cause Jeannie in the cartoon was just a fun Jeannie. He didn't have the little wrist

65
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,040
restraints and he could still do crazy fun stuff, but it seems like now Will Smith is just a man.

66
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:02,480
But it does, I mean, Jafar does say at the end of the movie, like I'll get you, I'll be back.

67
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:08,320
Like true. But I'm just saying, I guess there's a way and like, oh, I had my powers after all.

68
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:16,400
Like just a quick, if they did return of Jafar in this, this, this lineup in this,

69
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:21,120
in this way, would they have to then in keeping with the pattern, Will Smith would not come back

70
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:27,840
and he'd be played by Seth MacFarlane. It always has to be the Jeannie and the second one only has

71
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:33,200
to be played by the voice of a cartoon dad. I think, yes, I think Seth has been on TV now for

72
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:38,240
a few years. So I think he's ready to go for another go at the feature film world, which he took.

73
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:44,480
And I want to know what he'd look like if he was fucking jacked. Oh man. Let's see Seth MacFarlane

74
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:50,880
with like 70 more pounds of muscle. Yeah. HGH Seth MacFarlane. That's something we all didn't

75
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:56,080
know we wanted, but we now know we want it. The Jeannie was so jacked. It was approaching like

76
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:03,680
body horror, like Cronenberg level. Like, agreed. Yeah. The, the never had a friend like me sequence

77
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:08,000
looked like it took place in the twin peaks of black lodge in the back where you were the backwards

78
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:15,520
talking man is. I, I was comfortable with his physique. I thought that it was, I didn't have

79
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:20,640
really a thought that like, it's too weird or I'm too grossed out by it. I thought it was fine.

80
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:26,720
But the combined with the blue, giant hulking blue muscles. I don't know. I'm surprised that

81
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,400
Jason would say that he had a problem with it where comic book fans, you know, there's plenty

82
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:35,680
of characters that are blue and are jacked up. Oh, I didn't, I didn't mean body horror as like a,

83
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:43,120
as a bad thing. That is just a description of what it is. Like, uh, this is a counterpoint.

84
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:48,560
You were wrong scenario. You're saying it in a nice way. Yeah, I'm saying it as like, that is the

85
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:55,200
thing that I am pointing to, but yes, there is like a Rob Liefeld like exaggerated physicality.

86
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,280
I just think body horror generally would dictate that you found something horrifying

87
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:05,680
and not pleasant. I was thinking more of it as like a genre-y kind of thing. I, I think-

88
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:10,000
Is there a body, is there a horror body horror movie where somebody just gets fucking strong?

89
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,280
Is that the horror? Just gets strong. Well, the Josh Trink Fantastic Four sort of.

90
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,960
They unlock the process of getting the powers. Oh yeah. I guess that's sort of a,

91
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:26,800
that's more of a mutantism. Cause it, yeah, if he just got jacked, let me, that's fun. Let's get that

92
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:34,240
movie going. No horror there. Just a body, just a good looking body. I mean, now it's, I mean,

93
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,080
I think the reason probably why I wanted to do this, I thought, you know, we like to sort of,

94
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:46,480
we like to watch schlocky things and kind of quote unquote dunk on them as it were. Uh, and from the

95
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:53,760
early signs, the early footage made you think that the genie was going to be rendered just horribly.

96
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:58,400
And I think it did look markedly worse in those first few previews than it did in the, in the

97
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:06,800
finished. Yeah, it looked fine. Uh, yeah. I mean, all bizarre and all like not nearly as lovable as

98
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:15,200
the like detail-free Robin Williams genie, but it does make me wonder why do they, what is the rush

99
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:22,480
to get these things out where like we need to get out a 70% rendered, uh, with blue characters in

100
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,320
general. It happened with the genie, it happened with Sonic. People are upset about the rendering

101
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,480
of our blue characters. And they're upset about the re-rendering of Sonic. That's been really the

102
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:36,320
next. Did it come out already? I feel like some, I saw some sort of image. Isn't there, isn't there

103
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:41,040
a new one? I don't think so. Look it up, please. Cause I think you probably, somebody was trolling

104
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:47,440
or somebody was making a comedy, uh, Sonic. There's no way dentures were photoshopped into his mouth.

105
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:52,720
Yeah. I think, I mean, obviously look, uh, the studio system is a mess as far as movies are

106
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,480
concerned. You know, these things get released dates before they get a writer and director,

107
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:03,360
for gosh sake. Sure. So yeah, that's probably the problem here is that, uh, stuff isn't ready. Um,

108
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,360
so I guess you have to judge these things on the basis of, well, live action Aladdin is going to

109
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:15,120
happen. Like that, like what's my solution to anything I didn't like about that movie

110
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:20,800
could only be solved by none of it existing, but it's going to exist. So you have to judge it on

111
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:25,360
its merits. Did Guy Ritchie do a good job with the thing that would happen with or without him? Did

112
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:30,800
Will Smith do a good job with the thing that would have, would have been Josh Gad had he not said yes?

113
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:35,440
Right. Gad was number two, probably. Do we know, was there a number one or was Will always number

114
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:40,000
one? I would think Will would be the number one choice. Yeah. Like that makes sense to me. But

115
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,880
should it have been because here's the like Will Smith, here's things that the original

116
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:51,120
genie did that Will Smith cannot do. Lots of voices and sing. Well, here's what I will say.

117
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:56,000
I would, I appreciate, I believe I liked this movie the most of the three of us.

118
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,200
Yeah. I think I'm in between. What I liked about it was unlike maybe a Beauty and the Beast,

119
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:07,200
uh, they didn't feel like they had to imitate the cartoon. I felt like sometimes you're watching

120
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,800
some of these other ones and they're like trying to do an impression of the cartoon

121
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:16,560
and that really is a bummer. That kind of, so like Will Smith can't do Robin Williams.

122
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:21,440
The guy playing Jafar was not doing any sort of version of what Jafar in the movie was doing.

123
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,640
And I kind of appreciate that. It lets me like forget the stuff that would sort of take me out

124
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:29,920
of it. I think were the songs. Cause you'd be like, Oh yeah, that song from that other movie.

125
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:36,560
Yes. And like the rest of it tonally is not like, it doesn't quite jump ahead of the bread line.

126
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:42,880
And he still sings. Yes. Like, yeah, like they hire this actor and still make him sing like a,

127
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:48,960
like thirties guys and dolls man. Right. Like that's the, that's the thing that it didn't sort

128
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:54,080
of fit with me, but I kind of liked that. Like Will Smith is, is at least not trying to do,

129
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:58,800
cause like who would be the equivalent of voice man now? I, I, Rich Little, perhaps.

130
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:06,240
Now it's Rich Little. 80 year old Rich Little. It was Robin Williams to update it.

131
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:12,240
Jonathan Winters past. Did he do a lot of celebrity impressions? He did a lot of voices,

132
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,920
didn't he? Yeah, but we need celebrity impressions. I think again, Seth MacFarlane.

133
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:23,920
Seth MacFarlane or Frank Caliendo. Frank Caliendo. That's one idea. I think I'd like,

134
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:29,920
I think how I would like this movie like 10 times less budget and it's Frank Caliendo.

135
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:35,360
That would be, I like the idea of that too. That's a good word. I can't deny. That may have been a

136
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:40,160
Zucker brothers, you know, that we just missed. Like that could have happened. Yeah. Like movie.

137
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:45,200
Yeah. I'm into that. Pretend like, pretend I'm your coach, you know, like I'm John Madden, let's say.

138
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:53,920
Yeah. Yeah. I mean the first, the first, the original Aladdin, what did it have going for it?

139
00:13:54,560 --> 00:14:01,600
It had some great Broadway musical style music and it happened during the Disney animation

140
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:08,800
Renaissance, you know, with Little Mermaid and Aladdin and Lion King. Directors who would come

141
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:14,240
off of Little Mermaid. Is that correct? Musker and Clements are the directors, I believe. So

142
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,400
they're, yeah, they're polished from this movie. It went really well and took it right into another

143
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:25,040
great one. And, and you know, lots of looseness, animation stuff, stuff you can get away with in

144
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:30,880
animation that translating to, I think when we were walking out of theater, the phrase I said was like,

145
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:38,000
well, that was, it's much more expensive to do 2D animation, but you do have more freedom,

146
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:44,160
but it is cheaper to do after effects. Cause like some of the C, some of the CG stuff in this was a

147
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:49,840
little, I mean, it didn't help that felt like another AMC that was not bright enough. Like that.

148
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:53,760
Yeah. We saw end game on a screen that was not bright enough at the AMC. Although we're all

149
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:58,800
used to these, these IMAXs now. So what are we, what's the, that should be the standard I feel like

150
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:03,040
of brightness? I guess so. I feel like, but I feel like I never have that problem at the

151
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:08,080
historic Vista, the one screen theater. And well, that's, yeah, they're, they're much more on top,

152
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:12,640
excuse me, on top of it than like a big multiplex, I guess. Yeah. What's up with the, now we say,

153
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:18,560
where's the, where's the brightness issue? Is it in the projector? Is it the screen itself? Does it

154
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:23,440
need a coat of bright, blindingly bright pain? Is it the footage? Cause we were having this problem

155
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:28,560
with Game of Thrones. I feel like it's some sort of bulb. I feel like a bulb needs to be better.

156
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:34,320
I think it's a bulb. I'll play play for the bulb. I'll get one in there. Every time I walk into a

157
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:39,040
theater, I'll just hand them a bulb and say, insert this please. Yeah. We should all carry around a

158
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:43,920
bulb when we go to a movie. Just to make sure we visit a theater. Cause it's, yeah, I assume it's

159
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:48,000
a bulb, but somebody correct us if it's not. I wish it was a live show. Cause obviously five people

160
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,800
would be like, no, it's the, it's the this. Yeah. Yeah. It's the first one we've done since the live

161
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:58,880
show. And yeah, Jason, I really feel like you were the most supported in several scenarios where

162
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:03,600
here you'd be just hanging on the vine. Yeah. Let's going, what are you talking about? You got so much

163
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:08,080
support. Yeah. And is it now, and now I'm worried about the next scenario where you don't have

164
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:14,160
people shouting, no, Jason isn't insane. And here's what the thing was. I, you know, I, it's just a

165
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:21,440
thing that I'm just used to. So it was nice to have some support. I, we were saying early like that,

166
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:26,000
thank you to everyone who came to the live show a million times. Thank you. The warmest crowd I

167
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:34,240
have ever seen. So fun. Very nice. You know, the, the satisfaction down the road, it comes, it comes,

168
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:41,200
you know, I don't need a Greek chorus backing me up every day. It's okay. But I would like if then,

169
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:46,880
if at a future live show, somebody shows up with a handwritten list of like, here's every time that

170
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:53,520
Jason was right and you guys shout them down or didn't listen or weren't curious enough to

171
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:58,640
find it out for yourself. Didn't know your English history. Didn't know.

172
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:08,880
Britain's wars, a list of 36 points where we were, we were wrong and Jason was right. But I will

173
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:13,920
admit, I will be the first to admit, I do not quite know what's going on with dark digital footage.

174
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:20,880
No. I think, yeah, as Mike said earlier, like the deadlines are kind of in place before the work

175
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:27,520
starts, you know? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Weird system. And it's based on a company's financial quarters.

176
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,880
It based on like, well, we need one here and we need one there and we need one here.

177
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:40,240
These movies are also just such a count on a steadfast money makers because parents just go,

178
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,720
I don't know, what am I going to, we got to kill three hours.

179
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:48,560
Cause like this is three weeks in and this, we were in a full, it was like full screening.

180
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:52,640
Part of not doing it right away. It was like, I don't want to be in a sort of empty theater so I

181
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:59,280
can kind of laugh at it. But there wasn't enough to laugh at and packed, not a seat in the house.

182
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:03,520
Yeah. School's out. School's out. Nice. But still three weeks later. Three weeks later. Yeah,

183
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:09,840
that's true. It's a steady, it's a dependable. It's going to fill the Disney coffers.

184
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:15,120
Yeah. For a little while. Which maybe we have to thank this film because ultimately some of that

185
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:19,200
money goes into the stuff that we like. Yeah. Some, yeah. In some ways, cause like if it's a

186
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:24,640
Tomorrowland scenario and it bombs, there's $200 million that were, was, was counted on.

187
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:29,200
And now we don't get a nice thing. And especially with that, we don't get a nice Tomorrowland.

188
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:36,720
But I pray to God we never see a Will Smith genie in the park. Imagine the day that there's like a

189
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:42,960
big hulking. Explain to me what your vision of the Will Smith genie in the park looks like.

190
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:47,280
Cause then I'll decide if I don't want to see him or not. Okay, there's like a flying carpet ride in

191
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:53,280
Florida. Like it's a little cheaper flying carpet ride. If they like put a giant Will Smith genie

192
00:18:54,400 --> 00:19:00,160
with his big outstretched arms on the top of that and your carpets were like giving you a real good

193
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:05,200
view of his abs. They have, there's the carpet ride in Orlando. Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

194
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,880
Dumbo. And it's just, they put Will Smith in the middle there. Center of that. If it was all,

195
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:13,680
if the carpets are surrounding and he like tells jokes every once in a while,

196
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:20,560
like he has a projection face and he tells jokes. It sounds good. You want to see those abs?

197
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:25,440
I just said better. I said better. Blue nips. I'll say this. Hulking blue nips. I'm comfortable with it.

198
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:33,280
We all perked up when the credits started because then there was a Will Smith DJ Khaled song

199
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:37,600
and we're like, oh yeah. Like that was another thing where it's like, I want more Guy Ritchie

200
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:43,760
bullshit and I want it more of that. Like I want it more. Yeah, yeah. It is the most distinct part

201
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:48,560
of the movie. Yeah. If he, if Friend Like Me was not a more traditional version and it was a Will

202
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:54,560
Smith rap like he used to do in the late nineties, I think we would have liked, now the average

203
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:59,120
movie goer, would they have liked it? That's the question. Cause these are made, these movies are

204
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:06,160
also made for the average folks to come in that aren't thinking about this thing as being kind of

205
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:11,280
a cynical move perhaps and just going, oh, I like that song from the movie 20 years ago.

206
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:16,240
Would they be upset? I don't know. Cause we all cheered when we heard the DJ Khaled version.

207
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:21,360
Because of course he yelled DJ Khaled right at the top. That's a spoiler. It goes black

208
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:30,480
and then to credits and then straight to DJ Khaled. Yeah. Really crazy moment. If DJ Khaled was

209
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,720
Khaled, Khaled, whatever is in the cave of wonders in the movie. Like,

210
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:39,200
Gene comes out and does, I mean, that would be awesome. That's the plus stuff. Yeah. I liked,

211
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:44,480
you know, some of the visuals and stuff in, in the black lodge, some of the body heart, like I liked

212
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:48,640
some of the visuals there. I thought Friend Like Me was pretty good. Friend Like Me is when it felt

213
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:53,520
like the movie woke up a little. Yeah. So I actually thought that version, I felt like the

214
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:58,400
first couple songs felt a little weird and the instrumentation was a little weird. It felt kind

215
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:04,880
of like, um, the arrangements were strange for a lot of these songs. Yeah. It felt like kind of,

216
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:09,680
instead of like, oh, this is a cool take on an old song. It felt a little more like karaoke version

217
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:15,760
or something. I mean, it's a cover movie. Yes, it is a cover movie. Sure. But Friend Like Me,

218
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:20,800
I did like some of the sequences. I thought it sounded okay. I thought it sounded fine.

219
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:27,760
It was like, can your friend do this? I did like that. Yeah. God, I wanted more of that. What's

220
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:34,000
wrong with you? You liked the Will Smith beat boxes. That's cause I was hoping there was more

221
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,920
of the DJ Khaled type rapping. So when he gave me a little- But do you like that because it's sort of bad?

222
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:42,560
Because it's sort of hokey. Well, this is the question. It's hard for me to answer at this

223
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:49,120
point because I was watching this thing and I was like, I don't know what I like. It's hard at this

224
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:55,760
point for me to really figure out what I like truly, like what I love and then what I am

225
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:59,760
entertained by. Cause like if Will Smith beat boxing is funny and weird and interesting,

226
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:04,400
but am I laughing cause it's like bad? I don't think so. It's just like Will Smith doing like

227
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:08,960
a thing I would imagine the Will Smith genie to do. So I'm entertained by it. I don't know that

228
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:14,080
I'll ever be able to solve this equation completely. But I didn't hate it cause I know

229
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:20,480
there's movies I still see where I go, oh, I hate this part or this is stupid. But I like that part.

230
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:24,640
I don't think there's anything where I'm like, oh, it's so bad. I like that. You think it's just genuinely

231
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:32,000
that's cool. That's funny. But I don't, it's not like I'm saying it like excitedly. Like it's my,

232
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:38,400
what's the last movie I really like? I don't know. Last Jedi. First reform. Last Jedi.

233
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:44,000
First reform. The favorite is a great movie. Favorite's great. Yeah. But I'm not saying it's

234
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,640
like that, but I did like, oh, that's, I like that. I mean, it's like that. That's the vibe of it.

235
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:53,200
I'm like, I like beat boxing. I recognize the conundrum that you kind of proposed earlier of like

236
00:22:54,320 --> 00:23:00,240
they, how do you, you have to do something that he can't just do Robin Williams genie. Like a few

237
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:07,040
days ago, I watched the friend like me scene and watched Prince Ali and the cartoon version.

238
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:14,000
And it's so dynamic and it's so like, I mean, it's written for Robin Williams. Yes. But like

239
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,200
all the animate where you can illustrate and make them turn into anything in animation,

240
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:26,320
like they do barely a quarter of the gags in this one. That said, it is like a full screen of,

241
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:31,680
of dancers and people and stuff. And I do like the, like all the dance sequences in this movie,

242
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:36,720
I thought were very fun and interesting. That was kind of different. That's what I'm interested in

243
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:44,160
these live action stuff. When they start to, to, um, go a little off, like they start to do

244
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:50,400
something a little different than the animated ones. And, uh, so like the dance sequence where

245
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:55,040
Aladdin does a backflip. I liked when genie's controlling him. Yeah. When genius controlling

246
00:23:55,040 --> 00:24:00,960
it, that was like a fun physical gag. Um, there was other stuff where it's just like, well,

247
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:08,080
the cartoon version, they didn't have, they didn't justify this, this heart. Like it just was like

248
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:14,320
all this stuff about where's a Bob well on a map or like, do we really need to pick apart that logic?

249
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:21,200
Um, yeah. Is that fun at all? There was like three extra conversations about like absolute power

250
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:27,360
corrupts absolutely in this version that I think was covered in three sentences in the original

251
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,400
version. Well, the original, you got what? 90 minutes. Is that right? Yeah. 90 minutes.

252
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:36,880
Why could this not have been 90? Why was this two hours 15? I think they wanted to,

253
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:41,600
I'm sure they were like, well, Jasmine doesn't have a ton to do in the original cartoon. Right.

254
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:47,360
Sure. Let's give Jasmine more to do. She has a song that feels, is it new? Is the song song?

255
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:52,400
Cause it feels like totally different. Was it Menken? No, it's a different person.

256
00:24:52,400 --> 00:25:00,000
Not diverse. Uh, and the song is the shortest song. This is a black history month is the

257
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:07,920
shortest month scenario. Is it the same song twice? I don't know. Early. And then one happens when

258
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:12,640
she's about to be arrested. It becomes a music video for a little bit. And it's not the song

259
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:18,560
that Jasmine sings in the Disney's California adventure version of the show where it's like

260
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:23,840
about it being a bird in a cage. She has a whole nother song. And then the Broadway Aladdin has

261
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:30,000
additional songs. Yes. Call a proud of your boy is one of the songs, which I've heard is inspiration

262
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:37,440
for the proud boys group. The all right group. Yeah. Yeah. Which was not intended. I think Menken

263
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:41,280
wanted it in the original movie and it didn't fit. Yeah. Menken's idea was not that it was going to

264
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:45,840
be an all right anthem. And Pepe the frog was originally one of the characters that the genie

265
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:54,000
turned into. Right. It was a rejected sketch from a 93. Right. Yeah. There is like a,

266
00:25:55,120 --> 00:26:00,880
the movie, the sequence of a lot of Jafar becoming the salt and is interrupted for a music video.

267
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:08,960
And then she makes an impassioned monologue to the guards, to like the lead guard. Yeah. Hakim,

268
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:13,440
I believe. Yeah. Well, I said that Huck, it seemed like she was trying to say that you shouldn't

269
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:19,680
always support the leader of the government over, you know, what logically makes sense,

270
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:25,760
which I just read as Hakim is Lindsey Graham or another Republican Senator that you feel like

271
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:29,600
they're not doing the right thing right now. They're good people. Under Mr. Tribe. Deep down,

272
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:33,920
they're good people. We should, that's, that's what Biden, that's the Biden philosophy.

273
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:41,280
Yes. Everybody calmed down. My platform, everybody calmed down. Once it already calms down,

274
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:47,120
we'll sort through this mess. And he's still in the lead. So if we had, because clearly there's

275
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:53,600
someone in the process of writing this had some, some Trump ideas. If we had to map it all. So you

276
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:59,520
think Hakim is Lindsey Graham and if he just had a change of heart or Mitch McConnell, yeah. Right.

277
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:04,720
That's what the, I mean, that's what whoever, whoever's idea was things. Yes. Uh-huh. That's

278
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:09,840
the kind of parallel. So Trump is, so Trump would be Jafar then obviously. Right. But I was proposing

279
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:17,920
is Trump the Sultan and Jaf, and deep down he's good. And that Jafar is Stephen Miller,

280
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:23,760
who may, I, there's very little photo, photo and video of him. We don't know a lot about Stephen

281
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:28,960
Miller. He may walk around the white ass with a literal snake staff and hypnotize. So that was

282
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:35,840
another change. Jafar does not turn into a giant snake. These CGI movies love giant snakes and a

283
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:42,480
giant snake does appear for one shot. And then some snails, snakes a little. Yeah. The conclusion

284
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:49,280
of the movie, a lot of the stuff from the original happens in a different order, but like there's no

285
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:54,000
Aladdin sword fighting. Like as a kid, that's what I like. Aladdin grabs a big sword and then he

286
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:01,600
stabs the snake and like, yeah. Right. They didn't do that. And then Iago doesn't do jokes anymore.

287
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:05,760
Yes. He's got a couple of lines that are kind of funny. He's got a couple of lines, but yes,

288
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:09,520
that was another. It's not full of ice cracks. He's more of a real parrot. Yeah. Another thing

289
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:15,600
that happens in these, these movies is like the comedic relief. Then he's just played straight in

290
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:21,440
the live action where the Sultan was like a doofus in the original one. Yeah. A little more goofy.

291
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:28,000
A little bit goofy. And yeah, Iago was just Gilbert Godfrey doing Gilbert Godfrey, just like

292
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:34,480
Robin Williams was doing Robin Williams. So well, and in, and then Jafar was not funny in the first

293
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:39,200
one or in this one, but he was like a bigger, crazier villain. I think if I have a big problem

294
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:44,560
with this movie, it's that everybody got flatter. Everybody, like everybody just became more of,

295
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:49,360
I don't know, they're a guy and their, their philosophy is what's interesting and say more

296
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:57,120
of the comedies put on Naseem Padrad, which is an interesting attempt at something, but I wish like,

297
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:02,160
why can't the characters we know be a little funnier? Yeah. Aladdin, I think has one of the

298
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:08,480
interns of like big animated movies has one of the most interesting openings with Arabian Nights,

299
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:14,320
like the, the guy, the guy in the marketplace, the weird, uh, creeper kind of looking guy,

300
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:20,000
Robert Williams, which is Robin Williams. Um, uh, uh, yeah. And then they go to the cave of wonders

301
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:25,200
and he eats the first, the guy who wasn't the diamond in the rough. And this one, I think,

302
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:30,000
you mean that he eats something, right? Yeah. What cave eats the person.

303
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:41,040
The narrator ate the traditional middle Eastern dinner. Um, it slows down the movie. It takes a

304
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:48,800
while. Uh, uh, orders more stuffed grape leaves. Um, uh, yeah. And that I feel like, yeah, it was

305
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:57,200
flatter cause it was Will Smith singing it and, uh, real auto-tune-y, a little auto-tune-y and then

306
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:03,680
you had to see every character and it's just like, well, you're kind of, I'm, I know we kind of know

307
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:09,040
who these characters are, but you kind of taken the mystery away a little at first opening. So

308
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:14,720
sure. Um, yeah, but they got to dance around that line. That's offensive, but I don't remember what

309
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:19,120
the line is, but, uh, that people were like, cause that was a big problem at the time.

310
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:26,000
Oh yeah. There were protests about the, uh, um, it became something real generic. And this one,

311
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:31,600
this one, they changed the line in Prince Ali. I forget what it is originally, but Will Smith

312
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:38,320
sings like, we heard your princess is hot. That's a weird move. That's changed. That's a new line.

313
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:41,520
That is the original line. I don't know. How do you know it's changed then?

314
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:46,240
Because people are posting about like, why did they change this line to the princess is hot?

315
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:50,960
I got to find out what this original line is. It's, it's something much more innocuous.

316
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:59,120
Well, we did keep is the word nae bob, which I, it's funny to hear. That's one of those funny

317
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:05,040
culture clashes is Will Smith, like rapping nae bob. That's like a vaudeville word or like a

318
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:09,120
Marx brothers word. Well, I just looked it up. It is apparently, there we go. And nae bob is

319
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:13,680
a conspicuously wealthy man driving his fortune in the orient, especially in India during the 18th

320
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:19,520
century, privately held East India company. Uh, Hey, that's a historical thing. You didn't get

321
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:24,480
there, Jason. I didn't get there. Well, I guess that's like, um, uh, uh,

322
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:34,000
Oh wait, but a nattering nae bob, a nattering nae bob is a phrase used by vice president Spiro

323
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:42,160
Oh yeah. So of course his famous phrase. Yeah. Is that really an, of course, uh, that, that was like,

324
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:48,640
I feel like that was what was headline worthy back then is, is though the, do you hear the vice

325
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:53,840
president called someone a nattering nae bob? Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um, this was the idea. This,

326
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:59,440
this was as offensive as a politician. Yeah. It's like, uh, in, in the musical Annie, there's a lot

327
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:05,120
of period ref of like never fully dressed without a smile talks about like dapper Dan and

328
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:11,840
Bo Bromley, which were both like Bo Bromley was like a men's, he was, uh, uh, like, oh, men should

329
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:20,960
dress in this way. And dapper Dan was a style of, um, hair bo bo Bromley, uh, bro, bo Bromel,

330
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:26,960
excuse me. But in the song it's your clothes may be bro, bo Bromley as in like, yeah, bro,

331
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:33,440
Bromley ish is what you're saying. Um, he was like a guy who was like, oh, men should dress this way.

332
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:38,160
And it was more conservative. And there's a sixties band called the Bo Bromwells. Oh,

333
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:43,200
I never knew what that was about. I think I assume there was just a man named Bo Bromwell in that time.

334
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:49,200
Yeah. But no, in fact, boy, more of this great, more of this great anachronism. You're walking,

335
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:57,760
what's the word, not treasury, the glossary of old timey stuff. Boring. Bullshit.

336
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:04,320
I have the answer here. Uh, Herger. Yeah. The original is perjure princess was a sight. Lovely

337
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:10,320
to see. And now Herger princess was hot. Where is she? A lot more aggressive.

338
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:16,400
I guess it's just aggressive. This is really though, a thing where it's like, it is tone.

339
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:22,000
Tone is the thing here. We always talk about tone, but it's like Jason and I talk about tone.

340
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,880
Oh, okay. That's one of our favorite topics. Thanks for filming. I love talking about

341
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:28,880
tone. Political tone. You know, what are you saying? They are sort of saying the same thing.

342
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:33,040
Optics. One is just, it's all optics. One of one, they're the same. They're saying the same thing.

343
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:37,040
One's just the new one's just a bit more aggressive. A sight. Lovely to sit like that.

344
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:42,160
Doesn't sound that that sounds very, you know, Broadway eat, but it doesn't sound like

345
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:46,640
children would be confused by that. I think it's still clear and simple.

346
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:53,040
You think children don't know what hot means? No, I, hot sounds dumb. Or like hot sounds like

347
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:58,320
they were like, Oh, we let's simplify that. Let, let's make that more modern. Like why change that

348
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:03,680
at all? Why would you, why not? If you're going to change it, why not change it to jiggy? I was

349
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:09,120
going to say, herger princess looked like a snack. That would be very top. Well, yeah, you know,

350
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:14,000
that was one of the stand for your princess, right? Cause you say snack. You've been using

351
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:19,840
that vernacular, but would that be too aggressive for Disney's Aladdin? Uh, that yeah. No, I think

352
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:24,560
that is okay. You would say that's okay. Cause I think that's on the level of hot to me. Cause

353
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:29,600
snack is like, I'm going to eat you up. That's a very aggressive. Doesn't that sound like, uh,

354
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:34,960
you know, something that aunt would say, like, I just want to eat you up. I mean, like about

355
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:43,040
somebody handsome on TV, like Chris O'Donnell, Chris O'Donnell from, uh, um, like Mark Harmon

356
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:52,000
from, uh, uh, from N, uh, NCIS New Orleans. I believe. Yeah. So Donald is, or is it a Los Angeles?

357
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:59,520
He's on NCIS. Um, yeah, snack. That was the missed opportunity. I was saying is, um, the genie never

358
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:03,840
dabbed. It was really, well, I said, I was really pretty confident that Jeannie would dab in this

359
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:09,920
and he did not dab. Yeah. I, but maybe we're finding we want things like that to have happened.

360
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:15,440
I think I wish this was more of a train wreck is what I'm getting at. I think it might be like

361
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:20,320
more fun to me if, uh, well, of course I know. Yeah. I mean, if it's, if something's like an insane

362
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:26,560
disaster, it is fun. Yeah. Um, I think though that I sort of settled into the movie early when I kind

363
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:33,520
of felt like, Oh, this is like a pretty good ABC and I don't even mean this is that much of an insult,

364
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:39,280
but it's like an ABC Sunday night movie version of Aladdin. Cause it's like, all right. I like,

365
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:43,280
I liked everyone in the movie for the most part, but there was, there was the feeling,

366
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:49,120
there was not maybe a feeling of the like big important fairy tale. There was a low keyness

367
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:54,160
to a lot of it, which I'd like I settled into and I was like, I like these, I like this guy. I like

368
00:35:54,160 --> 00:36:03,040
this girl. It's on it's a, uh, it's a, uh, 1997 Cinderella or a Drew Carey. Yeah. And it's not a

369
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:08,400
bad thing. It's just you, you might be wishing it was like the animated version, which felt like

370
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:13,680
such an Epic. Um, but like, I don't know. It doesn't feel like a film. It doesn't feel like

371
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:19,920
you're really like go to a place and see Epic shots. Like it's all, it's all video gaming and

372
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:26,240
T a video gamey and TV, but I never questioned it if it was on TV or if it premiered on Disney,

373
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:31,200
we'd be raving about it on these Disney plus, you know what? There's that like they just put

374
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:35,120
an Aladdin movie on and it's got the songs, but it's like pretty good. Everyone's fun. Like I like

375
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:42,880
those actors are fun and they seem nice. And it's like a Greece live hairspray live. Yeah. Oh yeah.

376
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:47,840
With the Fed, with post, with a post department. Yeah. A lot of people. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. At one

377
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:53,040
point filling the entire screen for a while as we filed out a thousand people. What's my feel? Why

378
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:57,920
do I, I sort of like the live musicals, partially because I'm impressed by the live thing when

379
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:01,040
they've done them not live. I think there was a Rocky horror that looks like,

380
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:07,360
so inessential not going anywhere near that. But why do I kind of like the live musicals, but not

381
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:14,080
this? Well, I think that the S I think that they're set up in a way like by Disney to be like big

382
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:19,760
event movies and they have built up and they're really like, they're really holding them because

383
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:24,560
cause they use the same songs. You're like, well, I'm remembering the other movie I saw when I was a

384
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:29,120
kid that I loved that everyone's loved for 20 years. So like when you go with Beauty and the

385
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:33,840
Beast and they kind of try to do it exactly right with a couple, like exactly the same people go,

386
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:41,200
not quite as good. And then the Aladdin, I don't know they had much like as much of a vision for

387
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:46,640
it, but you're like, well, I, I, the other thing I like, and I've, it's been with me 25 years.

388
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:53,520
So your brain is naturally going to go, and then I could do going to the movies also is another

389
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:59,360
thing where it's like, I paid money and left my apartment to go here. So there's a little bit more

390
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:04,400
of an expectation. I feel like in that way, but yeah, if you were watching it on TV, I feel like

391
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:10,800
our people would be like, oh yeah, everyone seems cool. I like this. And it will now go into that

392
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:14,880
world and just be on forever and people will probably be fine with it. But like, you know,

393
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:22,080
it's a perfect example of the fine of it is a whole new world. You would never, the whole new

394
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:26,480
world is not bad. There's nothing bad about that sequence finishes. And I turned to Charles,

395
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:33,120
who we saw it with and was like, well, we got that done. Like it doesn't, it does nothing new or

396
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:40,160
innovative or, but nothing wrong either. It was really the wonders of the world. They just kind

397
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:45,760
of flew over some swamp land. Like in this one, like me, I did feel like there was some thought

398
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:50,400
in like, oh, these are some fun ideas we'll throw. That's not that aren't from the movie. Like we'll

399
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:56,400
throw some ideas in here that are versions of the old thing. And I don't know if him being a waiter

400
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:00,240
is kind of the same, but it's in a different way. And there's a different, there's different things

401
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:06,080
that I remember now from it. Whereas, you know, whole new world is like, I don't think my memory

402
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:11,440
exists of that sequence. I don't think I can remember it. I remember listening to the song.

403
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:17,600
I remember thinking the song sounded good, but not better. And nobody's singing it better or worse.

404
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:21,840
Yeah. Cause like not one. And you'd think of all the things we're going to use modern technology

405
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:28,480
to take you on a carpet ride. It's going to be so epic. And it's like, we'd yes, you know,

406
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:34,400
did they do the whole new world scene? They sure did. They did get done. Yeah. Maybe they didn't

407
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:42,400
have like kind of an interesting take on that. Does carpet get like torn to shit? Yeah. No,

408
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:47,520
I mean in the original. Oh, I don't not like that. I'm just shitting this one. And then Jeannie puts

409
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:52,080
them back together. So are we led to believe that the carpet is not alive even though it.

410
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:58,640
It's unclear if the carpet is dead or dying and then Jeannie. And then Jeannie with a new soul.

411
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:05,360
I guess so. One of the first diamonds in the rough that Jafar kills his soul is moved into the.

412
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:10,720
Like the last person who died in Angrabah becomes the carpet. He can't bring people back from the

413
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:15,280
dead, but he can move souls around. He can kind of shuffle souls around. Yeah. You go here.

414
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:22,000
Shell game of souls. Yeah. Yeah. That that was, I would have been traumatized by that as a kid.

415
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,640
I will say Abu has some funny reactions. There's some Abu reactions. I really like

416
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:32,400
when he like shifts his eyes or he's nervous, like a lot of the CGI stuff, those are the true

417
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:38,800
heroes of these movies. And I do think like you're getting so much mileage out of stuff that they

418
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:43,600
make. Like, obviously they have to make half of it or 75% of the movie, but you know, there's a

419
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:47,600
lot of nice little monkey business. Character acting. I guess I'd agree with that. And I think

420
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:53,280
we all agreed with the carpet was just like perfectly moved from one medium to the other.

421
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:59,440
He was the same. Yeah. He was the same. Yeah. Good job. He was the same. But I like, I like this

422
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:04,880
more than trying to have everybody just copy. Like if this was Guy Ritchie's like here, we're

423
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:11,040
going to do sort of a low key Aladdin. Everyone's going to be sort of like 21st century. They'll

424
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:15,360
wear like fun, colorful outfits. They don't look like the other movies, but they're like colorful

425
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:20,560
and like, we're just going to shoot it. Like a TV movie. I think that was his take when he

426
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:23,840
went into pitch at Disney. He was like, here's my, here's my idea. We're going to get it done.

427
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:28,080
We're all going to make a lot of money. I'm not going to stress out about it. I'm going to go

428
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:31,760
find, I'll go find some like Bollywood dancers. They're going to be great. We're going to have so

429
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:36,640
much fun watching them. We'll all applaud when they're done and then we'll go home to our families.

430
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:42,720
Yeah. And Bob Iger was like a tear in his eye. He was like, God bless you, sir.

431
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:47,760
The finest pitch I've ever heard. And this is the greatest. I'll stay on for another five years

432
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:52,640
to oversee you making this film. Aladdin, you know, the actors who were Aladdin and Jasmine,

433
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:58,320
they did a nice job. I thought she was a good singer. Um, the, I mean, again, though, the

434
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:02,240
animated Disney Renaissance movies, all they needed was like, well, we need the voice, right?

435
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:06,480
And we need the pipes to be right. We need the singing to be good. The look doesn't matter.

436
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:14,160
They had to find like real actors around the same right age who could also sing and like who could

437
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:19,440
do, you know, he had to do some stunty kind of stuff. I'm sure there was stunt men.

438
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:23,440
Correct me if I'm wrong about this is a sort of a thought I just had.

439
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:31,520
Correct me if I'm wrong. The end of the cartoon movie, he tricks Jafar and he says, you know,

440
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:35,280
the genie is more powerful than you are. And then Jafar says, make me a genie.

441
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:42,080
Yes. I think this is an improvement in the ending. That gray area. There's a running.

442
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:49,200
Yes. So to back up, I think this sort of corrects a little bit of a logic leap or it is just, it's

443
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:54,320
a little more seamless for me is that in the movie and the new version, um, Jeannie explains,

444
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:58,000
you have to be very specific with your wishes. It's a gray area. If you just say, make me a

445
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,960
prince, cause he makes a different prince, which I think is kind of a funny joke.

446
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,000
That was a decent sidekick.

447
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:07,840
And then at the end, Jafar, he tricks Jafar into making himself a genie, but Jafar says,

448
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:12,960
make me the most powerful creature in the universe. And he leaves it very vague. So Jeannie then can

449
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:18,080
make him a very powerful genie who gets trapped in a lamp, which I like a lot more because it's,

450
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:22,640
I see it makes more sense to me that you could trick Jafar that way than have him actually say

451
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:27,280
Jeannie. Cause he might think if he thought Jeannie in his head, he would think I'm going

452
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:32,080
into a lamp, aren't I? So I like that. No, no one cared about that. Only me.

453
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:36,720
I was questioning your use of the word. I liked it a lot more because that made me think you

454
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:40,560
might like tell someone about you're going to call your mom and say, so, Oh, I gotta tell you

455
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:46,080
about this. Um, so they fixed the wording and the only person I would tell is our friend Andrew

456
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:50,480
Grissom. And he would let me talk about it for 10 minutes. And then I either, he hate, he didn't

457
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:54,640
care or he really did like it. I wouldn't be able to tell cause he's too nice, but I don't think

458
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:58,320
I'll tell anyone this. Thanks for sharing friend. Yeah. That's what he say. I don't think I'll tell

459
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:02,480
anyone other than you two and everyone who's listening to this. I did really, I honestly,

460
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:06,720
when I say really like that, I did really like it. I was like, Oh, I like that. I like that punch

461
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:12,640
up. That's great. I like that it paid off, but like it's kind of in the vein. There was like one or

462
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:20,240
two moments where like so much in movies nowadays, like the comedy is so self-aware or self-referential

463
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:27,040
to me. So you're saying characters commenting on stuff. So that was kind of right on the line for

464
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:33,840
me. The idea of calling out the gray areas. Yeah. Like that was like a running thing on the story

465
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:40,160
though. I think that was commenting on the nature of wishes in general versus what he's making,

466
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:46,000
making a meta commentary. Calling out, he's commenting on Jeannie rules. Right. But I think,

467
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:52,000
I don't know that's Jeannie is meta in general. So he gets away with it. I mean, yeah, that was

468
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:58,000
the one he wasn't as meta of course, as the California adventure Jeannie. No, which is,

469
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:04,000
but how could you be? Yeah, that's literally impossible. He's the most meta. Sure. He wished

470
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:11,440
to be the most meta being in the galaxy. Yeah. And he got his wish. Tenfold. There was,

471
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:17,360
I'm trying to think, I was hoping, cause I have a lot of the Jeannie's from California

472
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:22,160
adventure's jokes in my head at all times, but especially this time watching this movie,

473
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:27,280
when he says, I can't bring anybody back from the dead and I can't make anyone fall in love,

474
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:32,000
whichever order he says that in California adventure Jeannie always used to do a Dr. Phil.

475
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:36,240
He said, I couldn't, I can't make anybody fall in love. And he would do like a Dr. Phil voice.

476
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:41,360
And that's one of the ones he would always do. So as soon as Jeannie was saying that in my brain,

477
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:45,840
it was like, is he going to do a Dr. Phil voice? But he did not do it. He did not. There's another,

478
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:49,440
if they'd been a little riskier and dangled on the, they're on the line a little more and

479
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:55,200
Will Smith became, how's there not one celebrity impression? At least one. Yeah. They did stay

480
00:45:55,200 --> 00:46:00,320
away from that. Like the yodeling cowboy or something. I appreciate them not, the yodeling

481
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:06,080
cowboy. You remember the kid or the yodeling kid. Sorry. He dressed like a little cowboy in a yodel.

482
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:10,480
Is this a topical reference from 1899? If we were at the live show, people would be like, yes,

483
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:16,720
the yodeling kid. We all love this. Jason, no, it's from like a year ago, the kid who yodeled.

484
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:22,800
I don't know what you're talking about. Thank God they didn't put the yodeling cowboy in, although,

485
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:27,920
or then they do and entire audience that was sort of listless through it stands up and screams.

486
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:31,680
I'm not that out of it. Like I know like topical things. Walmart yodeling kid.

487
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:37,200
What is this? He was yodeling in the Walmart. His name is Mason Ramsey.

488
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:44,560
Oh, Mason Ramsey. I can't make anyone fall in love. I can't turn anyone into Mason Ramsey,

489
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:51,920
the yodeling Walmart boy. You all know. It would have been funny if there was like a meme,

490
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:57,680
if like Jeannie turned into a meme from when they were shooting it that we have forgotten about now.

491
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:03,200
That would have made me laugh. He turned into pizza rat for a second. He turned into pizza rat.

492
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:09,520
Keyboard cat. That's 10 years ago to friends is pizza rat on a slice of pizza.

493
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:15,120
I realize that I was silence in theater. I just go ha.

494
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:20,480
I wish they had waited like a week before the movie came out to shoot all Will Smith stuff. So

495
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:25,520
it could have been the most topical. Absolutely. This is him on Ellen dressed as a little cowboy.

496
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:34,560
I really, I would cop to knowing the yodeling boy. I don't think I remember seeing him charts

497
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:39,440
for a little while. I remember Ellen breaks kids all the time. She does kids all the time.

498
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:44,720
So it's possible again, everyone's mad. Now it's God and I for not knowing the yodeling boy from

499
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:51,040
Walmart. Sheridan Pierce from. Don't be mean to Jason. You know the yodeling boy. You're just

500
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:56,560
pretending you don't. She's on Dear White People and she was on what was the show?

501
00:47:56,560 --> 00:48:00,560
They just canceled on Netflix. It was the remake of. Canceling a show on Netflix.

502
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:04,960
Was it one day at a time? She was on a couple of Netflix. She knows that yodeling cowboy I think

503
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:10,240
has done on a few comedy podcasts and done at UCB before. But it's very funny. So I'm backing up to

504
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:14,960
what did this movie came out a couple of weeks ago? Like around like May is May 25th sort of

505
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:20,000
around the neck of the woods. Something like that. Let's or how about here. Let's even go back a

506
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:26,880
little further to May. I'm looking up like OK May news from May 19th. What he would have said.

507
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:34,320
2019. So what let's figure what would the genie do about. I'm skipping the first one because it's

508
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:40,400
very dark about Trump. Oh he holds up the Mueller report and then he's like hold on a second. I got

509
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:46,320
to take care of something. He blacks out a lot of the census. Like the agreement the genie agreement

510
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:52,800
has says redactions like the Mueller report. Oh that's funny. OK great. Michigan congressman becomes

511
00:48:52,800 --> 00:49:00,800
first GOP lawmaker to back impeachment. So if somebody betrayed Jafar then the genie could

512
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:11,280
turn to camera and say who's this guy? Representative Justin Amash? I'm on Friday May 19th on the CNN

513
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:17,920
recap and Sunday marks the 25th 25 years since MTV first launched its trailblazing social experiment

514
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:25,520
the real world. Oh wow. Are you guys getting those long getting along as well as the 25 year old show

515
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:32,000
broadcast on MTV? Well it would have been like Aladdin's like not following the gist of something

516
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:39,120
and and then the genie says like man you're dumber than Puck. Yeah that's good. All right

517
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:43,440
hey let's have a house meeting Puck. And then he would have said turn to the camera and said happy

518
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:50,480
25 years MTV's real world. We're thinking of you this week. Nobody thought you made it but you made it.

519
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:59,200
You know when they when they ultimately win against Jafar he can say wow we won just like

520
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:06,080
the horse war of will won freakness steaks the famous race in Baltimore.

521
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:14,080
Yeah these I mean these would have been good these would have been good for sure. Yeah yeah yeah so

522
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:24,000
next Aladdin we would like there to be holes in it. There's a great plan where they and then they

523
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:29,040
do it like SNL style movies coming out Friday let's get everybody together on Sunday. Right.

524
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:35,680
And let's like do a little topical workshop and make sure that it's super relevant by whatever

525
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:42,240
Memorial Day 2021. I mean the next one could be a buddy moot because like Aladdin and genie are like

526
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:48,560
equal power levels now. Actually Aladdin is now royal he's past him the genie is but a simple

527
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:56,560
fisherman now. Oh that's right yes with the fakest beard in the history film. It's like he's playing

528
00:50:56,560 --> 00:51:06,240
Abraham Lincoln in a play in 1936. So yeah so what is Aladdin 2 then? Like we know they're on the ship

529
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:13,600
does Aladdin have to like make a wish with Jafar do a wish deal with Jafar to make

530
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:20,480
Beardwill Smith into a genie again. He has to like trick him to get him to also be a genie but then

531
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:25,920
save the last wish to get him back on the boat again. I mean they could combine two and three

532
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:31,520
was king of thieves and Aladdin's father comes back. Oh yes deadbeat dad right. Deadbeat dad yeah

533
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:35,680
the king of thieves. The king of thieves. Which is different than the prince of thieves. Right. Who was

534
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:40,320
Robin Hood. Kevin Costner Robin Hood I think. Right he was the prince of thieves. Yeah. What if not the

535
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:49,280
prince of tides. Not the prince of tides. Not the prince of darkness the devil.

536
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:58,160
So we'll get there it's the prince of tides will be in there let's get all the princes and kings

537
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:04,080
from all media into one movie. What if Aladdin because he's he's like doesn't feel like Jafar

538
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:08,480
got enough of his comeuppance just goes and rubs the lamp because Jafar now has to do whatever he

539
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:14,400
wants and he uses those three wishes to humiliate Jafar further. To make him like punch himself in

540
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:21,200
the dick. Yeah wish one. That was a more unnerving body horror because Jafar Jeannie was big and he

541
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:28,640
was flesh colored so those extra muscles were real really popping. You found the muscles less creepy

542
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:34,560
when it was blue. Yes I think the blue was like a little you know spoonful of sugar. I guess I'm the

543
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:41,920
only one. I guess I'm the only one on the podcast comfortable with big muscles giant muscles. Well

544
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,440
you're a wrestling fan so you're watching them all the time. That's a good point.

545
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:52,400
So but even giants like you know three story men with muscles. So wait a minute you would love then

546
00:52:53,200 --> 00:53:01,120
a wrestler whose theme was being the Jeannie. Oh well we've had. His gimmick is being the

547
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:06,080
especially the topical Jeannie. Kevin and you know Kevin Nash of Magic Mike he's super shredder. Okay

548
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:11,600
okay. His first one of his first gimmicks I believe in WCW was he was Oz the great and powerful Oz.

549
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:19,600
Which the Turner owned Wizard of Oz so they could use the IP. Oh wow. So he was Oz. That's pretty

550
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:26,160
good. So he's that's not he's not he's a he's a I think in the in he wasn't a fraud in the wrestling

551
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:32,720
storyline like Oz actually is. He wasn't then small behind a curtain though that's a good move.

552
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:36,880
That is a good move. Another wrestler then goes and finds the curtain and he's just a little wimpy

553
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:42,320
guy back there. Yes. And Kevin Nash on the in the ring is just a hologram. Yeah. Right.

554
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:47,040
Help me show Jason have I ever showed you a picture of what Oz looked like with the mask he wore.

555
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:53,200
That is a crazy mask. There's a couple of jokes about big beards. You got big wizard's beard.

556
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:59,200
I don't know why. Neat. That is more clear like my reference point when you said like what about

557
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:03,120
am I the only one who like big muscley guys and this was like I recognize the artistic

558
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:11,520
America of Tom of Finland a he a man a cartoonist a long dead cartoonist from Finland I believe.

559
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:20,800
Audience totally on board. Very Tom of Finland. Very muscley homoerotic men very muscle bound men.

560
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:28,000
What's the in what era? I'm not sure when the Tom of Finland guy passed away.

561
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:34,000
When's Disney going to buy Tom of Finland? When will Disney buy the homoerotic

562
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:39,600
beefcake art of Tom of Finland? So you're comfortable with the Will Smith genie because

563
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:45,440
he reminds you of old homoerotic art. I'm saying no I'm saying I'm more comfortable with that than

564
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:50,880
blue genie. Oh more so. Blue genie's proportions were just kind of odd because I did appreciate

565
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:56,320
that he did have the genie like tail that he didn't always have the but then when he was blue he

566
00:54:56,320 --> 00:55:03,920
sometimes the genie had genie legs I feel like this genie didn't have the blue the big plant pants.

567
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:07,920
You wanted him to have those blue pants or the big plants you were scratching your head like you

568
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:19,440
have a real like problem going on that you have to work out here. I'm just trying to think there was a lot they had to justify like Aladdin going like look more normal or Jasmine trying so hard to find a babwa on a map. Right.

569
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:26,400
It's like we don't that's fine we don't need you it's magic it's the magic is the answer to all these questions.

570
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:31,280
Yeah speaking of magic I am now lost in my google results for Tom of Finland.

571
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:41,840
Yeah I agree this is more pleasing aesthetically even are there gigantic penises bulging out of

572
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:47,760
very tight jeans yes would I rather look at this than the Will Smith genie probably. Yeah you got it too.

573
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:52,400
That is the the art style don't mind us listener we're all just looking at Tom of Finland.

574
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:58,560
Finland those draw some of those drawings were on a stamp in Finland. Wow that is how much she is

575
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:08,800
beloved as a national hero. The bulges. Oh my god this is insane. Yeah this is yeah fan graphics I think has put out a bunch of his stuff.

576
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:13,040
Interesting. I also don't know if this is related but I'm now I'm looking at a painting of that

577
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:19,840
famous painting blue boy and there's a penis bursting out of him that's you talk about body

578
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:27,360
horror is this bigger than the blue boy himself there's a these oh well okay that's just a full

579
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:36,320
on erotic one. This is an erotic one. I can't see from where you are. Here you go. This podcast we're so bored by

580
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:43,600
Aladdin now we're all just looking at erotic art. Yes I see men of hulking men of many professions

581
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:50,320
are all performing one task together. Very significant significant cartoonist significant history of comics.

582
00:56:51,120 --> 00:57:00,480
Save your money. It is pride month it is pride month Tom of Finland a big yeah sure home erotic. Stay home and look at Tom of Finland instead and

583
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:05,680
crank up the brightness on your phone so you won't have the problem in the theater of watching watching

584
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:10,560
dim muscles look at the brightest muscles you can bring your own home and it's all free. I think you

585
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:16,480
could bring your bulbs if you're gonna go out just carrying your gonna see if you're gonna see a movie

586
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:23,040
let's get those let's get those muscles lit get those muscles bring your bulbs everybody bring the

587
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:28,720
bulbs I want to see a movie line where everybody's carrying a light bulb you want yours we'll use mine

588
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:32,480
we'll use mine tonight which one's the brightest how many times will you use?

589
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:40,240
Yeah I think my feeling with all these movies is I do wish we could go completely I've said this before

590
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:45,520
I'm sure but completely off the cliff with them let's just Dumbo meets Aladdin if we're doing

591
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:50,880
live action let's just totally let's just dump everything on top of each other and see what

592
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:57,280
happens oh let's bathe in this garbage pile together I've just regurgitating our childhood.

593
00:57:57,280 --> 00:58:03,120
We were kids in the the Marvel the four issue Marvel versus DC era so you know we're on board

594
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:08,720
for crossovers so yeah I just like let's let's go nuts let's let's if you're good let's do six

595
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:16,400
sequels to Aladdin and the tramp and Bernard and Bianca like rescuers meets lady fine great yes the

596
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:24,400
carpet falls in love with the living foot rest from Beauty and the Beast and it's an unrelated romance

597
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:32,320
tale fine it's really sweet and they get broken up by that feather duster but then they they

598
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:38,960
they patch it up and get back together how about Jafar Jeannie turns LeFou from Beauty and the Beast

599
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:46,960
into a Jeannie and finally Gad can be a Jeannie the great and powerful LeFou yeah so LeFou I'm

600
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:52,320
lining up for that yeah why not let's just do let's go crazy we also haven't talked about you know

601
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:58,480
what I here let's I'll give them this the maybe the craziest component that I wasn't sure that I

602
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:05,200
liked and now looking back it is something they did different was Iago becoming giant I loved

603
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:12,320
Iago becoming giant Iago becomes like a big scary dinosaur bird yeah so let's match that up with

604
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:20,880
Dumbo and also then then uh Jafar the Jafar Jeannie also makes uh Dumbo a rabid so there's

605
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:29,920
Dumbo is like now like an evil elephant and a big fight in the sky just 90 minutes of pure fighting

606
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:36,560
between Dumbo and giant Iago that's great tearing at each other the big bites with the beak making

607
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:43,200
each other bleed the most violent movie Disney's ever released yeah fine they're gonna need to get

608
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:47,600
some leaders the reason we have to go to the theater to see it and it's a horror show

609
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:55,360
animal nature versus man man versus animal animal versus um do other animation studios copy this

610
00:59:55,920 --> 01:00:02,480
do illumination are there live action minions the studio of Ghibli do a live action Totoro

611
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:10,720
live action minions look exactly like tom from Finland I guarantee you this is the only review

612
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:18,800
of the 2019 Aladdin that references Tom of Finland and it's all because of you

613
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:28,800
huge penises busting out of those minion overalls yeah yeah I don't things are a little more wild

614
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:34,480
in Europe the history of comics is a little more interesting actually to speak with me from Finland

615
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:39,440
that's probably the same right uh not quite they're all bikers

616
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:48,400
their definition of banana is a little bit different

617
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:50,800
I'm sorry it was Rich Little

618
01:00:53,120 --> 01:00:58,880
what did I object to Rich Little coming back uh I think I think I did hear tell that that they

619
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:05,280
were thinking about Shrek real life oh is that the move there we go he's coming back in in some form

620
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:10,880
but I've heard back but they want to potentially it's yeah it's live action CGI Shrek so who's

621
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:16,720
Shrek Mike Myers they're not gonna it's not gonna be him as much as that would be maybe it's just a

622
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:22,720
voice yeah but you don't think they would Will Smithify it they don't just make it I think and

623
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:26,560
I don't know that somebody can probably prove me wrong already but I feel like I heard they wanted

624
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:31,680
everyone back for voices but it's a different medium but it's a different medium I heard

625
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:36,480
that could be totally out the window or that was just a rumor no way change of plans it's DJ Khaled

626
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:45,760
I'm Shrek! Here's another one! Shrek baby! Shrek is all the way up!

627
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:56,080
and then Eddie Murphy still Donkey? um that'd be great I guess so you think no though um well if

628
01:01:56,080 --> 01:02:02,320
it's I don't know who would DJ Khaled vibe with hmm that's a good question it's Lil Wayne he could

629
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:09,120
be Lil Wayne uh we can do multiple versions though that's true let's just make five competing

630
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:14,400
Shreks all going at once and there will be a point before the universe folds in on itself where

631
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:19,680
we'll have like a five Shrek movies released in one week like in 20 years everything will just be

632
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:28,400
so crazy well I see like it'll be in six to seven minute parts on Kweeby and then two years down the

633
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:34,320
line the rights are released to be a two-hour movie after Kweeby releases them I like how you

634
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:42,400
say Kweeby Kweeby well it's anyone's best guess because I say Kweeby but technically because so

635
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:49,120
Kweeby if you don't know and you will know soon the thunder of Kweeby is coming to your town

636
01:02:49,120 --> 01:02:57,520
the hand of God is coming down from the heavens to deliver you quick bites quick bites of entertainment

637
01:02:57,520 --> 01:02:59,040
the former head of dream jerks

638
01:03:02,080 --> 01:03:09,280
the dream jerk himself Jeffrey Katzenberg has a new site coming your way and yes and he's Mr. Shrek

639
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:16,320
as well uh and also I just I was just talking to our friend Anthony Geo about how he was behind the

640
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:22,480
show uh father of the pride as well yeah that's it that's maybe a topic for us is the Siegfried

641
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:30,880
and Roy NBC uh CGI show that had to debut after Roy was mauled by one of the comical tigers

642
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:38,320
voiced by John Goodman Montecor um Montecor is who mauled Roy that's the name yep was Montecor

643
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:44,240
portrayed on the show specifically he had Montecor was the famous tiger I think I am sure

644
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:52,320
John Goodman as Montecor what's the show called pride of the father of the pride cheese okay so

645
01:03:52,320 --> 01:03:58,320
that's the series whoever wins in Dumbo versus Gianniago has to face off against Montecor

646
01:04:00,560 --> 01:04:07,440
I'm combining every universe father of the pride come out the fall after Shrek came out um I think

647
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:12,400
maybe yeah it's around that same time could you imagine like Shrek was such a huge hit when it

648
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:18,880
came out and it's like now we're gonna do it on tv and people are not interested well I think that

649
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:25,680
I think I'm not making this up that donkey did a cameo on father of the pride there oh my god

650
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:29,040
there is no way that donkey did not do

651
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:38,000
but I think that is too specific to have thought of the safest money bet besides putting a dollar

652
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:42,320
on everything but I'd also bet that it's not Eddie Murphy I don't think it was Eddie Murphy

653
01:04:42,320 --> 01:04:47,600
I've already found a few interesting things okay yes please this is now a slash it's a father of

654
01:04:47,600 --> 01:04:52,960
the pride this is our Hollywood week superstar limo the new Aladdin movie Hollywood baby

655
01:04:52,960 --> 01:05:01,120
John Goodman was Larry and I don't see Montecor last name Larry Montecor it does not say Larry

656
01:05:01,120 --> 01:05:06,080
Montecor the bloodthirsty lion it doesn't say lions what are they what's the what actual species

657
01:05:06,080 --> 01:05:13,200
tigers tiger okay yeah um I will so so I was just scrolling through and something that caught my eye

658
01:05:13,840 --> 01:05:20,560
is that Kelsey Grammer is on the show as himself what and Matt Lauer is on the show as himself

659
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:26,240
oh no why didn't you say if only Montecor could have taken his rage out on Matt Lauer instead of

660
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:34,240
Roy and Dave Foley is on the show one episode as Kelsey Grammer's cat what I have also confirmed

661
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:40,080
that indeed Eddie Murphy was donkey okay I'm glad I didn't place an official bet there

662
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:50,960
uh is there one other thing I saw like oh did you catch Carl Reiner as Sarmati yes yes so that's

663
01:05:50,960 --> 01:06:01,120
oh and Orlando Jones as snack whoa wow the simulation is real he's always well undoubtedly

664
01:06:01,120 --> 01:06:08,080
then that character was always looking like a snack well with that tied together there's nothing

665
01:06:08,080 --> 01:06:14,720
I think there's nowhere else to go with this but we'll boy I like when a good idea spins out

666
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:20,880
father of the pride episode to come in your way there are into the dream jerks archives 14

667
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:28,000
episodes of it do we have to watch all of them I guess the father of the pride saga I believe my

668
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:34,960
friend Tommy Blanchard wrote for father of the pride wow 6.9 on the scale of ratings so not the worst

669
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:43,680
out of a thousand their folklore on the DVD 1226 reviews too so it's not like it's got 10 or

670
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:49,120
something not the worst show not the worst geez well maybe I gotta do a behind the scenes delve

671
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:56,560
too uh we should do a Montecore episode too we're committing to two now before we've even known

672
01:06:56,560 --> 01:07:00,720
okay let's do father of the pride and then we can talk about Montecore on the episode oh wait no

673
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:04,560
because Montecore is different than so we have to do an episode all about the lion the tiger the

674
01:07:04,560 --> 01:07:10,880
moldy man but they the reason I don't think that's that grisly is because Roy was like no Montecore

675
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:17,760
was trying to help me Roy absolved the the tiger so it's not like now I don't know if he was doing

676
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:23,680
that just so they didn't kill him but they were they both were like no Montecore was trying to

677
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:29,680
help he was confused I believe that Roy was like I was having a stroke and he tried to save me which

678
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:34,160
I don't know if that's true I think he just like took a hunk by like giving him CPR just taking a

679
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:41,680
bite out of his throat I guess I don't know complete series 199 oh and that was a dollar 99

680
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:49,120
yeah huh I didn't boy that's the if they put that on quibi then everybody subscribes

681
01:07:49,120 --> 01:07:53,680
everyone subscribes they gotta watch something until the sun goes down to watch Steven Spielberg's

682
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:57,840

683
01:07:57,840 --> 01:08:04,080
Steven Spielberg horror series from sundown to sunup I was gonna who's gonna stop me

684
01:08:05,360 --> 01:08:11,200
the algorithm what you literally can't you can't yeah that I actually think is kind that's like the

685
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:16,240
tingler level of novelty that's like the internet version of like a little shocking device in every

686
01:08:16,240 --> 01:08:24,800
chair wow wow um kind of interesting yeah Montecore passed away in 2014 the attack happened in 2003

687
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:32,000
and Siegfried and Roy said that Montecore sensed the horn was having a Roy horn was having a mini

688
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:37,200
stroke and was dragging him to safety rather than attacking him and then there's a statement in this

689
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:47,280
article from USA Today that says animal experts have disputed that theory so yeah and then wait

690
01:08:47,280 --> 01:08:52,960
