1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Forever...

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Dog.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
When your town has let you down

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
When your port has fallen short

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
When you're too worn out to run

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
And need some ribs or a Cinnabon

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
You need a place, a place for rock

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
A place for roll, a place where Oakland Raiders merch is sold

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
A sublime hot topic and bill of bond

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
A place where you can purchase a candy thong

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
So let's go take a walk

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Let's all go to City Walk

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Tonight, tonight...

14
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Jason Sheridan, Scott Gairdner, and our very special guest, Nick Mundy, returning to Podcast the Ride.

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Thanks for having me back.

16
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Returning champion.

17
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I always assumed that we would go on some rides on Podcast the Ride.

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I feel like I've been bamboozled.

19
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Yet here I am.

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Look, it's not necessarily... though Ride is in the title, if you read the full bio, if there is such a thing,

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:53,000
we are about all themed experiences of which Bucatubepo counts, of which stomach rattling restaurants like that count.

22
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Well, it was a ride because I got to pay parking and go on a terrible trip through Universal's valet and parking system.

23
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Oh boy. Well, wait.

24
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Let's save that gold.

25
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:13,000
That gold is going to have to be for another episode because we have very precise as far as sectors are concerned and there's another parking episode coming up.

26
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Yeah, okay. Real quick. I will come back for that.

27
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Okay. Yes.

28
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Who is the Sector Master?

29
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
It's the Sector Keeper, first of all.

30
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:29,000
And the Sector Keeper is the person who's making sure that we cover all of the areas of CityWalk expeditiously.

31
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
He helped us set the boundaries, which are very clear.

32
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Who is this piece of shit?

33
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Hey, hey, don't call him a piece of shit.

34
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:45,000
He's the ghost of a child who died from a staph infection in the dancing fountains. And he's also simultaneously an ageless being.

35
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Like the Holy Trinity.

36
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
The Sector Keeper has been very good to us.

37
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:58,000
And for you to come in here guns blazing, especially when there's already been some issues about you not adhering to the Sector Keeper's rules.

38
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
In fact, I think...

39
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Batman!

40
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
There he is!

41
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
The Sector Keeper!

42
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
He's here!

43
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Batman!

44
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Oh, look! He's grabbed the hidden microphone.

45
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Batman!

46
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
The Sector Keeper has appeared.

47
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
You have no idea the Hornet's Nest that you've walked in here.

48
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I didn't even expect that you would insult the Sector Keeper right off the bat, but I'm glad he's here to defend himself.

49
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Boys, boys, it's cold in here.

50
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Oh no, we're making a week.

51
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Sector Keeper, tell us, as you do every episode, please tell us what is in this Sector.

52
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Sector 11. Bukit Abebo.

53
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
The Raider image.

54
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Yes, certainly.

55
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
And Shoe Palace.

56
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Yes.

57
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Shoe Palace. And Raider store in Bukit Abebo. Is there something in that list that you don't hear?

58
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Yeah, Lids. Superstore.

59
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
That's correct.

60
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Not the Lids hat exclusives, but the Lids with the jerseys and the pennants and the t-shirts.

61
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
That's okay.

62
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Locker room.

63
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Why? Why?

64
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Oh my god, he's disappearing.

65
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Scott, explain to him.

66
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Why do you want to send my soul to hell?

67
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
We're trying to keep him out of hell, Monday.

68
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Here's what happened.

69
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Yesterday, we recorded the episode about Lids.

70
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:27,000
And Mike dropped the bombshell on us that you have been trying to annex Lids into this Sector, even though we set the rules very clearly.

71
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I have one hobby.

72
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I have one hobby.

73
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
It's Houston Astros.

74
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Fuck you, Sheridan.

75
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
He remembers. Monday remembers.

76
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
He's got a long memory.

77
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Dodger.

78
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
We beat the...

79
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Thank you. And I have two hobbies, Houston Astros and the worst hobby in the world, I admit it, yet I'm in Mike Carlson's place.

80
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I collect Astros hats.

81
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
So I frequent Lids a lot.

82
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I have a membership.

83
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Right.

84
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Wait, you're a member of Lids?

85
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Yeah.

86
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
What?

87
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I have a membership where I get discounted prices for a yearly fee.

88
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
No kidding.

89
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
How much is the annual fee on that?

90
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I get like 20% off.

91
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Wow.

92
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
But how much is the fee that you pay?

93
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Oh, like $29.95.

94
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Wow.

95
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Worth it?

96
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,000
For this many hats and stuff, yes.

97
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
You haven't...

98
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:27,000
The Sector Keeper went into kind of a purgatory in the mid-90s, so by inflation, that price isn't actually that bad.

99
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

100
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
If we made you a chart of how inflation works.

101
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
But anyway, are you even...

102
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Sector Keeper, are you even okay with this amount that we've talked about, Lids?

103
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I feel I'm growing weaker.

104
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
This is what I was worried about.

105
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Yeah.

106
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
We have to...the whole thing here...

107
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I did a nice thing at Lids though.

108
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
We'll get to...

109
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Well, yeah.

110
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Here's the thing.

111
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Between yesterday and today, we went to locker room by Lids with you, and you bought us all

112
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
hats and presents.

113
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
And as I was preparing to come in here and bum rush you, my wife, Erin, wanted me to

114
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
issue a statement, which is, I am not part of this, and I love my hat.

115
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
So let's be very clear, Erin.

116
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Carlson's wearing the hat.

117
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I got him.

118
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I'd like to say...

119
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Whoa, whoa.

120
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
That's where you got that fucking hat from?

121
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Yes.

122
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Nick Nolany bought me a hat.

123
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Michael.

124
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Well, look, Sector Keeper, I'm so sorry.

125
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Hold on.

126
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I'm so sorry.

127
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I just want to say yesterday, I was talking about the fact that the sacred scrolls that

128
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
are written on the back of Popcornopolis wrappers say you cannot speak of different sectors

129
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
when you're not in the right sector episode.

130
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
But I'd like to say I like this hat.

131
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I think this hat is great.

132
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
You look like a Beastie Boy.

133
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I look like a Beastie Boy, which is the best compliment you can get.

134
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
And Sector Keeper, I'd love to...

135
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I wouldn't mind talking about lids, to be very honest with you.

136
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Hold on.

137
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Hold on.

138
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Mike, you got a hat?

139
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I did get a hat, yeah.

140
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Scott got a hat.

141
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Erin got a hat, my wife got a hat.

142
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Erin got a hat.

143
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Okay.

144
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
What'd you say about Yuli?

145
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Huh?

146
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Oh, that he, you know, he said he's racist.

147
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
He did a racist thing.

148
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
He did.

149
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
And he paid for it.

150
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
And he apologized.

151
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
And he went through and then it was unnecessary to bring it up in the context of the conversation.

152
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Okay?

153
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I think it was good.

154
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Look, here's the thing.

155
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
So you don't get a hat.

156
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I'm going to heighten it.

157
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Most baseball players are racist.

158
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
That's why there's a lot of good old boys in baseball.

159
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
There's a lot of good old boys in baseball.

160
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
You don't see baseball players.

161
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
There are a lot of racist places and malls.

162
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
You don't see a lot of baseball players kneeling for the anthem.

163
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
African American children are out all the time.

164
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Okay?

165
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
So he, you know what he got in trouble for though?

166
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
He said the quiet stuff.

167
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Okay.

168
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
What's the second thing?

169
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
He said the quiet stuff loud.

170
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Oh boy.

171
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Too far.

172
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Too far.

173
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
All bets are off now.

174
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Your, your boy, Yuli, he said the quiet stuff loud, just like Donald Trump.

175
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
And that's why I don't, Republicans don't like him.

176
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:51,000
And just like Trump, Michael Cohen and Paul Manafort getting these hats, you know, you're

177
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
bringing hats in general.

178
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I'm just saying, it seems like a bribe.

179
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
It seems like a bribe.

180
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
It seems like a drug.

181
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Okay.

182
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
A bribe.

183
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I'm issuing.

184
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I want a trash ad hat.

185
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,720
I'm issuing, I'm issuing a ruling.

186
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:09,000
The sector keeper just came from a dimensional portal, which was outside your apartment.

187
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,360
And now you're inside.

188
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:15,000
I think for that outburst, I think Jason gets two minutes in the outdoor penalty box.

189
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
How does the sector keeper rule out that?

190
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
The sector keeper will have the ultimate, that's my proposal to you sector keeper.

191
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
It's look, that's tough.

192
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
But wait, wait, what does he think?

193
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Yes.

194
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Jason, please think about your sins outside.

195
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
What are my sins?

196
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Outside.

197
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
You are the man.

198
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I stuck up for you.

199
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I stuck up for you when he was bullying you about not buying a buffet lunch.

200
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
And Lundy, think about your sins outside as well.

201
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Lundy goes outside?

202
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
You're sending them both together?

203
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Oh yeah, this rules.

204
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
What if they never come out of the...

205
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Well, it's two minutes, so we'll set the timer for two minutes.

206
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Two minutes here.

207
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Wait, you're sending them to two minutes in heaven.

208
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Two minutes here.

209
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
They're going to end up making out.

210
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Yeah, they're going to start kissing.

211
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Wait, they have to, wait, they will have no podcast if they go at the same time.

212
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Well, we can, the three of us can talk.

213
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Okay, okay, but I think this will help us deal with one thing at a time.

214
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Okay, so Jason is gone and we can bring him back in.

215
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
He'll serve his time and then...

216
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Okay, okay, great.

217
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
So, I bought ads, I did a nice thing.

218
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Yeah, I agree.

219
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
And that's why Aaron wanted to steer way clear of this.

220
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
What's he doing?

221
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
All right, he's dealing with other things.

222
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
He's on it, but this will help us sort out this conflict.

223
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Now, the Jason conflict may never be settled, but let's talk about your conflict with us.

224
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I may have said some strong words yesterday.

225
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I may have said you were bullying our podcast and the Sector Keeper into submission,

226
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,000
and that you were acting like a biff trying to pull lids into your sector.

227
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:52,000
But after the events of the last day and what you did for Mike and for my wife,

228
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I feel better about the situation and I feel like the power of friendship is maybe overriding.

229
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Friendship.

230
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Yes, you believe in friendship.

231
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
You can feel the power of friendship even in your existential hell.

232
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Good deeds.

233
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Yeah, I think you maybe have reversed some of the things I was mad about.

234
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Lids is a magical place.

235
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Locker room by Lids is an even more magical place because it has jerseys.

236
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Mm-hmm.

237
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
All right, look.

238
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
And it has famous jerseys such as Goldberg's jersey from The Mighty Ducks.

239
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
From The Mighty Ducks.

240
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
And it all turned around.

241
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
They had The Mighty Ducks jersey from Disney.

242
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Yes, and from the Disney property, which you know I like.

243
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,000
And then they also have the Semi Pro jersey, Jackie Moon's famous jersey from that movie Semi Pro.

244
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
You remember that?

245
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Oh, you sucked it.

246
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Sorry.

247
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I don't know that.

248
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I'm sorry.

249
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
That's more of a modern movie.

250
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
It's a 2000s thing.

251
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
You'll get to Semi Pro.

252
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Did he die before Mighty Ducks?

253
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Yes.

254
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Yeah, right before probably.

255
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
You were probably looking forward to it coming.

256
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
You saw the trailer, I think.

257
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I saw the preview, but I never saw the movie.

258
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
And the character, Averman, seemed hilarious.

259
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
He certainly was, and I can't wait for you to see his full effect.

260
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
But anyway, I guess what I'm...

261
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Josh, did you see Free Willy?

262
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Because Joshua Jackson kind of looks like the kid from Free Willy, but it's not, despite confusion.

263
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Yes, I did see that.

264
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
So here's also a full disclosure.

265
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:23,000
We did an episode two days ago about locker room by Lids, and it's possible that none of us actually went into locker room by Lids.

266
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
So now that you've...

267
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Two minutes is up.

268
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Two minutes is up.

269
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
All right.

270
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Jason's back in.

271
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Fair enough.

272
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Okay, so here's my thing.

273
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
This is my case.

274
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Yes.

275
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Okay, now that I have all the info.

276
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Yeah.

277
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Okay, one, you didn't even talk about locker room by Lids.

278
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
You're right.

279
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
The most important...

280
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Yes, we did, because it was covered in Uncle Drew stuff.

281
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I spent a significant amount of time at locker room.

282
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Oh, you did.

283
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Talking about Uncle Drew stuff.

284
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
A hilarious movie.

285
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
And the plethora of World Cup paraphernalia.

286
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Well, look, you found a point of agreement.

287
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
You both agree Uncle Drew was great.

288
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
But they didn't even go in.

289
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
No, I didn't say Uncle Drew.

290
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Okay.

291
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I think I walked by the first time, but I certainly spent more time in it last night when we were there, and you were so nice to buy me this wonderful hat that I like a lot.

292
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Yeah.

293
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Pay off.

294
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
And then also, Sheridan didn't even bother to show up to our sector.

295
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
That's true.

296
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I don't know if you know this sector keeper.

297
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Absent boys.

298
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Whoa, whoa.

299
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Absent boys.

300
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I went to move into Pepo Solo and enjoyed the lunch menu on the cart.

301
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
But he called it the wrong name.

302
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
He called it Pepo.

303
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I feel like he should maybe go back in the penalty box, but that's too much.

304
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
We've lost Jason for too long.

305
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Yeah, we can't have him in more penalty.

306
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
The Jason Stans would be furious if I was in the penalty box too much.

307
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Did you calm down in your time in the penalty box?

308
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Did you learn anything?

309
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Do you have a different perspective as we all do?

310
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I mean, as calm as I ever get.

311
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I'm like Bruce Banner.

312
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I'm always angry.

313
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Sure.

314
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Okay.

315
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Well, I guess I think we have to go backwards and do the chronology of this.

316
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I don't know.

317
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I'm not even sure why you didn't end up with Lids in your sector.

318
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
There is only.

319
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Okay.

320
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I've been a universal.

321
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,000
We've established the only times I've been a universal city walk is with Mike Carlson.

322
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
That's true.

323
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
When he's like, Hey, I bought eight tickets for a thing.

324
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Do you want to go instead of the movie theater down the street and pay more money for 3D movies?

325
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I'm like, I'm money you could pay for IMAX.

326
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:20,000
And then I'm like, uh, and then my wife, the law is like, yeah, let's go be social.

327
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I'm like, fine.

328
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:28,000
And then I had a theory about how it works and then do the worst version of, uh, parking

329
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
and valet.

330
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Yes.

331
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
So my experience is with, well, I guess I'm not going to invite you ever.

332
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
No, I enjoy it.

333
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
We're going to find a new theater.

334
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I thought this whole Burbank thing would change things.

335
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Yeah.

336
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
But none of them especially since my movie theater has a Buffalo Wild Wings.

337
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I thought that would entice you more.

338
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Well, but there's a Margaritaville now by the city walk.

339
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
God damn it.

340
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
And you know, that's good.

341
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Yeah.

342
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
But we're not going to talk about it.

343
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
It's a different one.

344
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Yeah.

345
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Different sector.

346
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
And we certainly can't talk.

347
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:04,000
So my experiences with city walk are completely, um, based on Mike Carlson.

348
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Okay.

349
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,000
And then what, every time I go, I'm like, I always go to the locker room.

350
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Yeah.

351
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Locker room lids.

352
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Okay.

353
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
That's my place.

354
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
And then when I was like, Hey, we're doing sectors.

355
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:24,280
I assumed maybe that was presumptuous by me that I would get the locker room lids and

356
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,480
not the imitation Italian food.

357
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:32,600
Uh, sir, it was very important to us that you go in a Raiders store for four minutes

358
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,640
and that you eat food that may.

359
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:37,480
Well, I think we should start from the get-go.

360
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:41,960
I engaged with the patrons of the Raider image.

361
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,200
Oh, that's true.

362
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:47,560
Because you, well, I guess we can talk about things in the sector, but I want the official

363
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,300
ruling from the sector keeper.

364
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:54,240
If we veer into discussion of lids or locker room by lids, does the power of friendship

365
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,280
make this okay?

366
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,640
The power of friendship gives me strength.

367
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,640
Yeah.

368
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,640
Okay.

369
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,640
All right.

370
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,640
Well, look, I'm sorry.

371
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,640
We.

372
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:28,160
We are the final judge of this whole saga.

373
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,960
Much like Christian God.

374
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:30,960
Yes.

375
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:33,760
Much like our beloved Christian God.

376
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:37,360
We'll get to some of that when we start talking about a certain restaurant.

377
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,360
Oh, that's true.

378
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,360
Okay.

379
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,360
Well, do we go in order of what we did?

380
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,360
Perhaps.

381
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,360
Yeah, let's do that.

382
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,360
Yeah.

383
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,360
Okay.

384
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,360
So, um, Bucca di Beppo.

385
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,360
Yeah.

386
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,360
Yeah.

387
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,360
You ended up with this and this was not really by choice.

388
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:51,960
I feel like we were giving you, I think we were excited to give you the Raiders, the Raider

389
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:52,960
image.

390
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:56,960
That's the strangest things that city walk and this whole lids kerfuffle.

391
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:57,960
Sure.

392
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:58,960
I understand that.

393
00:15:58,960 --> 00:15:59,960
Yeah.

394
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:00,960
But you're a big Raiders.

395
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,960
Yeah.

396
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:02,960
The Raiders are still here.

397
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:03,960
Right.

398
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:13,600
Well, um, they're about to leave to Las Vegas, but they haven't been in LA for a very long

399
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,600
time.

400
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,600
Sector Key.

401
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,600
Yeah.

402
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,760
Actually, when he died, they would have been Oakland again.

403
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:19,760
Uh huh.

404
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,760
I think so.

405
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,760
What?

406
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,760
Ninety three, 94.

407
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:23,760
Yeah.

408
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,760
But yeah.

409
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:27,240
So as far as you know, no, that's the strange thing.

410
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:32,640
The Raiders are not in LA and haven't been for decades and decades.

411
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:38,600
Raiders store in it's like Chicago bear store in Indianapolis.

412
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,600
Yeah.

413
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,600
Yeah.

414
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,600
We have that.

415
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,840
They might have that, but it wouldn't make much sense.

416
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:50,840
Well, here's what I learned is that by going to Raider image.com, I didn't know.

417
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:54,080
In my mind, that was the only Raider image store.

418
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,800
Would you guys like to guess how many there are in total?

419
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:57,800
Um, three.

420
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:03,160
Um, it's a, it's a little few, uh, subtract yours by yours.

421
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,160
It's a, uh, uh, 13.

422
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,160
Wow.

423
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,160
Really?

424
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,160
That's not right.

425
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,360
Um, I don't think any, but there's a fee.

426
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:12,320
They just opened a couple in Vegas.

427
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,320
Well, yeah.

428
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,200
Preparation for their move.

429
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:20,000
But one of them is in Moreno Valley, which is, oh, there's a Portillo is a Moreno Valley.

430
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Oh really?

431
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Yeah.

432
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Where Lucasfilm is?

433
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,520
No, no, that's up North.

434
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,520
Okay.

435
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,720
No, this is, this is like weird.

436
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,000
On the way to Palm Springs.

437
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Yeah.

438
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I looked it up.

439
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Um, I take notes.

440
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,560
I have notes with me and we always have notes.

441
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:39,560
Um, the, uh, I worked far too hard on them and still get accused of not doing research.

442
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:45,880
Um, you know, you never can win the sector keepers on Twitter, by the way, that's, that's

443
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:46,880
his right.

444
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:47,880
He's never experienced it.

445
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:52,440
And while he's on this mortal coil, as he's going through the series, he's getting stronger

446
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,440
and stronger.

447
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:58,440
Yes. Yeah. Trying to track down my family.

448
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:01,720
Yeah. He's missed a lot.

449
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,760
Just getting city walk for his life.

450
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:08,520
Of all the wonderful things that the sector keeper has missed out on Twitter is certainly

451
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,520
high on the list.

452
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,520
Yeah.

453
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,520
It's a magical world over there.

454
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,000
Seems fun and friendly.

455
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Yeah.

456
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Everybody's great.

457
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
It's a real online community.

458
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Big party.

459
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:22,800
Um, as I was saying, Moreno Valley is 429 miles away from Oakland.

460
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,080
That is the furthest Raiders store.

461
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,080
The Raiders travel, man.

462
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,080
The Raiders travel.

463
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,080
It's one of those teams.

464
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,080
It was like, uh, it wasn't just a team.

465
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,560
It was a fashion icon.

466
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,560
Yeah.

467
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:37,200
I had a Raiders airbrushed varsity jacket.

468
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,200
Whoa.

469
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,200
As a child.

470
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,200
Yeah.

471
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,200
Yeah.

472
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,200
Airbrushed with what?

473
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,360
I had Raiders for one Christmas.

474
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:47,040
I got Raiders Zuba's pants.

475
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,040
Wow.

476
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:54,000
Uh, Raiders turtleneck and a Raiders airbrushed varsity jacket.

477
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,600
I cause I wasn't a Raiders fan.

478
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,480
I was a Bo Jackson fan.

479
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:08,440
Oh, Jackson to me is, you know, he's my Walt Disney minus the, minus the, oh boy day.

480
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,080
Don't get up in the penalty box.

481
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,080
Sure.

482
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,080
Watch your words.

483
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,800
Actually, isn't he due two minutes in the pen?

484
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,480
No, I, I'm not getting up.

485
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:21,640
Can't argue with that.

486
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:25,520
My impression, the way I've always understood it is a Raiders nation.

487
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,040
The Raiders fan base is very intense.

488
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,040
Is that right?

489
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:34,440
Like it's like it's almost to a cartoonish level.

490
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,040
They're kind of like the bears there.

491
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:42,040
They don't or the, sorry, the cubs, they were, they just will show up all the time.

492
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:44,220
They don't demand greatness.

493
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:48,360
You're saying cause like the cubs famously have like a fan base.

494
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:53,000
That's like full of like, they're kind of like Jason Mraz listening to guys that dress

495
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,080
like college boys and like are annoying to some people.

496
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,080
Yeah.

497
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:02,720
Raiders fans are like, it's like if there was a company that had movies and movies and

498
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:10,260
theme parks, um, and they could not admit any wrongdoing by this company, no matter

499
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:13,880
if they did wrong and they would still show up in their garish costumes.

500
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:14,880
Interesting.

501
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:19,800
Look, we landed that metaphor like a 747 coming in on a runaway.

502
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,800
So smooth.

503
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:27,680
Look, we've, we've held Disney's feet to the fire on some of the labor issues and we're

504
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:31,160
very happy with some of that has played out.

505
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,400
We're willing to see wrongdoing.

506
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:37,720
And with that in mind, I'd like you to say one bad thing about Bo Jackson.

507
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:40,360
No, fair enough.

508
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:43,040
Not getting up, not saying no.

509
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:48,000
He didn't get to like him getting hurt was the worst thing that ever happened to me as

510
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
a kid.

511
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,320
He was out for a while.

512
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:57,760
Oh, he's got his like hip and leg ripped out of his, uh, during like a tackle in 1991 because

513
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:02,600
my understanding of Bo Jackson from what little I know is that he was playing two sports at

514
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:06,200
the same time, which is a terrible idea.

515
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,360
It's reeks havoc on your body.

516
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:10,000
No, it's the greatest thing.

517
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,960
Like he like within 24 hours he hit a home run and scored a touchdown.

518
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:14,960
I know it's cool.

519
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:15,960
I agree with you.

520
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:16,960
It's cool.

521
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:21,440
It is cool as hell, but it's not like it's bad for you to like just be pushing yourself

522
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,440
that much.

523
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:26,120
He was beyond human until he got hurt, but he got hurt very clearly.

524
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:29,280
Also baseball is much easier on the body, right?

525
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,280
We can agree on that.

526
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,280
Yeah, no, not for 162 games.

527
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:36,200
You're hitting dingers out of the park, your shoulder, your, your knees.

528
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,200
Come on, you're running.

529
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:42,440
But Bo Jackson was the greatest athlete ever and no one will ever be better.

530
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,880
And the phrase was bow nose.

531
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:44,880
Yes.

532
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,800
It was like, it was, do you remember that sector key?

533
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:47,800
Yes.

534
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,800
Yes.

535
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,800
Bo knows, those baseball bonus laundry.

536
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:52,800
He did everything.

537
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:56,480
He was a great marketer, which you guys would appreciate.

538
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:01,520
I have a fondness for Bo Jackson because I liked baseball 25 years ago.

539
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,160
So I walked into the Raiders store.

540
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,360
Like, look, I'll play along.

541
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:10,000
I went to the Raiders store and I, unlike you guys, I made eye contact with the customers,

542
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,640
service people, the employees, the employees.

543
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:17,920
And I asked them directly, do you have a Bo Jackson Jersey?

544
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:23,880
And they did, which, okay, that was my main test for this place for the quality, for the

545
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,120
quality of the place.

546
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,600
But it was at the bottom shelf.

547
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:31,880
I mean, the Raiders have had other players, but Bo Jackson was transcendent.

548
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:35,760
He was the guy who got me into, I don't know if you remember Zuba's pants, but there was

549
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:40,240
a big baggie hammer pants with, you know, I had the Zuba's football.

550
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,000
I had the jacket, turtleneck.

551
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,200
I wore it to my brother's birthday and Mr. Gattie's.

552
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,880
It was wonderful.

553
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:49,120
Is there a photo of you as a child with all of the Raiders stuff on?

554
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,120
I would have to check.

555
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,120
Sure.

556
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:54,880
Most of my parents, most of our children, childhood photos got thrown out because my

557
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:55,880
parents stopped caring.

558
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,920
I mean, or they're in a big box.

559
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:58,920
No one cares.

560
00:22:58,920 --> 00:22:59,920
Maybe in a big box somewhere.

561
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,920
You keep moving forward.

562
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,800
That happened to my photos.

563
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,560
No, no sector keeper.

564
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:05,680
No, absolutely not.

565
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,680
Your family still loves you.

566
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,680
They still remember.

567
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:10,160
Oh, now he's kissing up to the sector keeper.

568
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:14,360
There's a lot of shifting politics in this room.

569
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,360
This, this.

570
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,360
Oh, I know.

571
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:19,240
I remember the shifting politics because when he stopped Carlson from bullying him about

572
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:22,680
food and then all of a sudden all the rules get thrown out.

573
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,680
Well, there's no loyalty.

574
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:27,440
These episodes with you, you just, I don't know, they're testy.

575
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:31,920
For some reason you bring controversy to the show.

576
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:36,360
You ignite Jason to accuse all athletes of being racists.

577
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,360
I'm just saying.

578
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,360
What was that?

579
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,360
He said all.

580
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,360
Oh no, not all.

581
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,360
A lot of baseball players.

582
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,360
Nothing you said most.

583
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,360
Well, there's a lot of good old boys.

584
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,360
What was your memory of that?

585
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:48,320
I said there's a lot of good old boys in baseball.

586
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,080
You know, you don't see a lot of baseball players kneeling for the anthem or making

587
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:54,640
big political statements like the NFL players or NBA players.

588
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,080
There's articles about this.

589
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,600
Well, I don't know.

590
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,240
I mean, I don't even know what to say.

591
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,240
Sandy walk.

592
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:04,240
Let's talk about Raiders and Bo Jackson.

593
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,240
Yeah.

594
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:12,200
So they, so a point for, you know, having a Bo Jackson Jersey, but it wasn't the authentic

595
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,200
Jersey.

596
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,680
It was the replica Jersey, which cost more.

597
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,680
Okay.

598
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,680
What is the distinction?

599
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:23,480
What quality of the, like the quality of the build and the cut, like the replica jerseys

600
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:28,960
are, you know, what most people get, but like for the professional collector, which you'll

601
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:36,120
appreciate it's the, the cut, the same material, you know, the better stitching.

602
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:40,600
So if you were to like take it, like go back in time with the authentic Jersey and put

603
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:44,520
it on Bo, the coach and everybody would be like, that looks perfect.

604
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,520
That's right.

605
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,520
Is that what you're saying?

606
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:49,880
It's exactly the same thing he wore as opposed to a cheaper version of it.

607
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:50,880
Yes.

608
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:51,880
I see.

609
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:54,840
I see that you took it a long time and posed as the team dresser.

610
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:55,840
Very good.

611
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:56,840
I believe this.

612
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:01,960
You're clearly a staff member here and not a time traveler.

613
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:07,520
And clearly the positions team dresser.

614
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,520
All teams have and have always had.

615
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:13,480
Bo Jackson, you got a wardrobe right now and get your uniform fixed.

616
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:18,360
One time I was at a baseball game with my dad and one of his friends and I, and one

617
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:24,120
of the players had just slid and, uh, you know, gotten a dirt all over their pants.

618
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:28,680
And I was like, do you think it takes them a long time to wash their uniforms?

619
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:33,920
Like I thought that the players wash their own uniforms and my dad and his friend laughed

620
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:37,520
and laughed at me for so long.

621
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:43,040
Maybe that's maybe that seed of a memory is why I get defensive when we're talking about

622
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:48,200
sports and strong arm opinions involving sports and sports stores.

623
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:51,400
I think maybe that's why I lash out at you about things like this.

624
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,880
Why'd you, you never lash out at me.

625
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:53,880
I well, I did.

626
00:25:53,880 --> 00:26:00,120
Well, you should listen to your list and you'll hear, you'll hear him lashing at you.

627
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:02,720
The notion of this sector annexing, I don't know.

628
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,360
It just put me in a state.

629
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:06,960
I, nothing, nothing too bad was said.

630
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:12,160
You know, Carlson hit me with this and that you guys were texting about the sectors without

631
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,760
me and you know, what can I say?

632
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,120
He got jealous maybe texting.

633
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:18,520
Uh huh.

634
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:21,960
Are you corrupt?

635
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:24,040
Let's finish the story.

636
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:28,000
Most professional sports are there's rampant corruption.

637
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Oh boy.

638
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,080
Well, I would say corporate, every corporate structure is rampant with.

639
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:38,520
Governments that just give away, you know, tax bonds, just give away to build a stadium,

640
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,280
the rampant corruption.

641
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:44,720
It's just, God knows what's going to come out about that LA stadium in a few years.

642
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,480
Are you pulling your phone out for Monday?

643
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,720
Are you going to throw it at Jason?

644
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:55,840
Are you going to, are you going to do a release embarrassing information?

645
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,920
You should, I was expecting to pull out a handful of pennies and just throw them at

646
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:01,040
him like you did at the kids at Astroworld.

647
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,680
Disneyland to Anaheim.

648
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:06,200
These tax agreements are divisive.

649
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,440
So let's rip them up.

650
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,000
Yeah, it's awful.

651
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:15,520
They're trying to do that because if you take city tax incentives, then you have to, you're

652
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:19,480
going to have to pay an $18 minimum wage down the line.

653
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:24,560
So Disney, what Disney is doing is they're trying to say, we'll get rid of the tax breaks

654
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:29,520
we're getting, but covertly then they won't have to pay the $18 minimum wage into a couple

655
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,600
of years.

656
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,600
So we're on that side.

657
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,520
Look, we straddle both sides of the line.

658
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:41,560
We're aware of the labor issues and that Disneyland does dirty ball with the, with everyone's

659
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,560
bad.

660
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,560
Yeah.

661
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:47,560
But have you seen the fake rocks that are going up at Star Wars land because they are

662
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:50,360
beautiful and I am so excited about them.

663
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:51,960
They look like just from the movies.

664
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:52,960
They look like they're from the movies.

665
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,360
Oh man, look like just like last Jedi.

666
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:55,360
All right.

667
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,840
I'm trying to talk about my sector.

668
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:59,200
Yeah, all right.

669
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:04,120
So they didn't have the, the, and I just thought someone of a Bo Jackson stature, right.

670
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:09,840
Should have not only the full quality Jersey, but granted it wasn't Mitchell and Ness.

671
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,560
And so those are the quote, like better quality replicas.

672
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,560
Right.

673
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:18,480
But the placement of it was in the bottom, right behind a bunch of stuff instead of right

674
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,480
up front.

675
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:24,680
Like it was all the way in the back and you could not see it when you entered the store.

676
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:25,680
Yeah.

677
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,680
I mean, you had to ask.

678
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,680
Yeah, I had to ask.

679
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,040
I couldn't find it.

680
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:33,080
You would think, Hey man, right.

681
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:40,440
You want Bo Jackson's Jersey to be held aloft in the rafters as though it were retired.

682
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:43,400
I want, I want soft lights focusing on it.

683
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,400
Yeah.

684
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:48,440
Shining upon and constantly like shifting and then refocusing your attention on the

685
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,440
Jackson.

686
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,800
Also is Kansas city Royals Jersey.

687
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:53,760
I know, I know it's a Raiders image.

688
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:57,320
You're annexing other teams now into the, this is what I do.

689
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:59,640
This is all I object to is the forcible annexing.

690
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,600
He was a two sport athlete.

691
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,600
Okay.

692
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,600
Yeah.

693
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,600
Well, the reggae, it's all bets are off.

694
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,600
Here's the two.

695
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,600
We got celebrate history.

696
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:07,600
We should celebrate it.

697
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:12,880
I also, my memory now of Bo Jackson is that he had one of those handheld LCD games and

698
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:13,880
it was two.

699
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:14,880
Do you remember this sector keeper?

700
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,880
Like the tiger electronics.

701
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:16,880
Yeah.

702
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,880
Like tiger electronics.

703
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:18,880
It was two sided.

704
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,880
One was baseball, one was football and you'd flip it around.

705
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:22,880
So you have two screens.

706
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:27,880
But the radar image is probably just chopping in half and selling an incomplete product.

707
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:30,040
They're not honoring the true history of Mr. Jackson.

708
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:34,680
You think that back room at the Raider image, they're destroying Bo Jackson merchandise.

709
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:35,680
Hmm.

710
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,680
Who's front and center?

711
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,400
Who is displayed?

712
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,840
Oh, they're new players.

713
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,800
Like I saw bobble heads.

714
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:45,640
I can look up the NFL is too corrupt for me now.

715
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,920
I'll agree with Jason there.

716
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:47,920
Hey, hey, hey, great.

717
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:52,760
I can't wait to, I get thrown back in my face.

718
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:53,760
Yeah.

719
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:57,280
I, I was looking at the Yelp reviews for Raider Nation.

720
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:03,480
I walked through it and well, for one thing, much better Yelp, much more positive Yelp

721
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:06,640
reviews than Shoe Palace.

722
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:11,080
But Raider, there's some five star reviews for Raider Nation.

723
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:12,640
Like there's some diehard Raiders fans.

724
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:16,640
It's like, you know, we, every time we come up here from San Diego, we go to Raider.

725
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:21,840
I will say this, if I was a Raiders fan, which I am not, I'm a Bo Jackson fan.

726
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:22,840
Not a bad store.

727
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:28,280
It's not a bad, it's not a bad store.

728
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,800
We were the only people inside.

729
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:30,800
I will say that.

730
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:31,800
Sure.

731
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:34,000
But there were two employees and they were helpful.

732
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Sure.

733
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Yeah.

734
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Great customer service.

735
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,680
I appreciated their gusto.

736
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:43,520
I don't like their planograms.

737
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,520
Their what?

738
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:45,520
What is that word?

739
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,520
Didn't anyone not work retail?

740
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:47,520
I worked retail.

741
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,520
That's the...

742
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:49,520
We didn't have that term at the container store though.

743
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:52,280
Diagram of product placement.

744
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:54,280
It was called what?

745
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:55,280
Planograms.

746
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,280
A planogram?

747
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,280
That was Best Buy.

748
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,280
Oh yeah.

749
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,280
Oh yeah.

750
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,280
That's what.

751
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,280
Okay.

752
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,280
This is interesting.

753
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,960
I'm surprised this word has not come up in city.

754
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:04,960
Yeah.

755
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,320
We'll continue to talk about the planograms of the other sectors.

756
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:10,720
There's no planograms?

757
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,240
Did you not work when you were a kid?

758
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,240
He was a child.

759
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,240
He was a child.

760
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:17,240
I died in fourth grade.

761
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,240
What do you want?

762
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,240
Child labor laws to be overturned too?

763
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,240
I mow lawns.

764
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,240
That's true.

765
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,240
I mow lawns.

766
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:27,240
Oh, when I was fourth grade, I mow lawns all summer so I could buy a Bo Jackson rookie

767
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,240
card.

768
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,240
Really?

769
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:33,600
It cost me all the money I made, like a couple hundred bucks, and now it's not even listed

770
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,560
in the Beckett Monthly because everything fucking sucks.

771
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:37,560
Wow.

772
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,560
Yeah.

773
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,520
Are cards not worth what they used to be worth?

774
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:42,240
Did the card industrial index...

775
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,240
That all collapsed.

776
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,240
Yeah.

777
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,800
In the 90s, everything that was collectible collapsed.

778
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:47,800
Oh no.

779
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:52,480
The comic books, oh, Detective Giver, do you have a collection of all this stuff?

780
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,480
Yes.

781
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:57,480
Do you have all the Jim Lee, you have all the number one X-Men covers that connect it?

782
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,480
Yes, all of the cards.

783
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,480
Those aren't worth shit either?

784
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,480
No, those aren't worth very much.

785
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:03,120
No, they made a million of them.

786
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:06,320
My Kenny Lofton rookie card isn't worth anything.

787
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,320
I don't know.

788
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,400
I'm so afraid to say, probably not.

789
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:14,800
And your college fund made entirely of rare beanie babies might not work out for you.

790
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:15,800
Oh.

791
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:16,800
Oh no, he's losing strength.

792
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:24,640
And your Image Comic Chromium Cover Rob Liefeld's Youngblood comic is for sure not worth anything

793
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,640
anymore.

794
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:29,320
Is my Luke Skywalker ripped Power of the Force figure still worth something?

795
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,800
No, I don't think so.

796
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:31,880
But he's super strong.

797
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:34,120
He is strong and I know exactly what you're talking about.

798
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:36,360
It doesn't make any sense, but I don't think that's worth very much money.

799
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,360
I could eBay.

800
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:41,880
That might, the figures can sometimes be worth some money, but I'll say this, all the Force,

801
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:45,720
excuse me, the Force, the Phantom Menace figures I have in the package, worthless.

802
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:46,720
God damn it.

803
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,400
Oh, that was a Star Wars.

804
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,400
They made a fourth Star Wars in 1999.

805
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,640
Is this the Star Wars?

806
00:32:53,640 --> 00:33:00,000
Yeah, they were bad, but now they're retroactively good for some reason.

807
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Everyone decided that they're good now.

808
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Oh boy.

809
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Let's not open this can.

810
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
It won't work.

811
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,200
Anyway, please move on to Shoe Palace.

812
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,040
This was a thing I came across.

813
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:22,080
Shoe Palace and Raider Image brought up this fact that neither of the stores at CityWalk

814
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:28,440
don't validate for parking or the valet, only the table service restaurants.

815
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,800
So there's people mad.

816
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:36,520
There was a person on the Raider Image page going, I came up here and bought over $300

817
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:40,560
of Raider merch, some of which started dissolving immediately.

818
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:43,520
And I paid the $25 parking.

819
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,520
He did buy the good jersey.

820
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:48,080
Yeah, like after you washed it, it just started wearing away.

821
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,080
And then they got screwed.

822
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,560
Because he didn't get the authentic jersey.

823
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:51,560
Didn't get the authentic jersey.

824
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,360
That's a better investment.

825
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:57,960
Shoe Palace only had two Yelp reviews, both one star, but they were those kind of unhinged

826
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:58,960
Yelp reviews.

827
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:01,640
So I don't want to chalk that up.

828
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,880
That's a lot to be mad at for Shoe Palace.

829
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:04,880
Like it's not.

830
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:10,680
It reminded me of the gas store where it's like very limited stock on display, I felt

831
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:11,680
like.

832
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:12,680
The gas store?

833
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:13,680
Yes.

834
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:14,680
There's a gas.

835
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:15,680
Jason calls the gas station the gas store.

836
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,680
Yeah, I go to the gas store.

837
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:20,760
Anyone need anything at the gas store?

838
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,600
Give me a gallon of unleaded, please.

839
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:23,600
You got it.

840
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,600
You got an empty milk jug to fill up.

841
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:25,840
They love when you do that.

842
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:26,840
Sure do.

843
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:27,840
Oh man.

844
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,800
So the Shoe Palace.

845
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:30,800
Shoe Palace.

846
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:34,600
What do you think?

847
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:37,640
They have socks there as well as the sock market.

848
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:40,200
Yeah, there's a small collection of socks.

849
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:42,400
Now is that the sock store that you pointed out?

850
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,400
We like, ah?

851
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:46,640
Yeah, we were walking through City Walk and I pointed, I go, look, and it was sock market

852
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:49,920
and you just like barely acknowledged what I said and we kept walking.

853
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:53,520
There wasn't enough for you to latch onto with, hey, look.

854
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,360
No, no, he did.

855
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,760
No, like Willy Wonka.

856
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:57,760
Yeah.

857
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:58,880
Like, look, look upon these socks.

858
00:34:58,880 --> 00:34:59,880
And then I did what he said.

859
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:01,600
And you were like, oh, and then we kept walking.

860
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:05,480
That's a metaphor for how the world treats you and us.

861
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,480
That's true.

862
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,480
Sorry.

863
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,480
No, it's okay.

864
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:12,600
I understand what my, my lot in life.

865
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:16,640
So the shoe palace was like, okay, so I'm a big guy.

866
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:24,840
So I judge it by cross trainers, like new balances, uh, shoes for husky boys, Reebok

867
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,440
cross trainer pumps.

868
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:29,380
Cause those are that, I mean, those are what you get.

869
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:33,280
But I mean, if I was in a Michael Jordan shoes, the Jordans, right.

870
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,400
They have a whole giant display of them.

871
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,400
Yeah.

872
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,800
That seemed to be their main.

873
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,800
Yeah.

874
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:45,080
So that's not a collection I, uh, in engaging.

875
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:52,920
So both shoes and you're in, there were no Bo Jackson's, uh, there were no Bo Jackson.

876
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:53,920
Did Bo ever have a shoe?

877
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:54,920
Oh yeah.

878
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:55,920
No, he had them.

879
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:56,920
They were great.

880
00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:00,120
And then Nike doesn't release them or still continuing to make them.

881
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:04,120
There's no, the Bo Jackson's 15 or 16 that sell out.

882
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,120
Where is Bo been?

883
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:07,160
Cause Bo has not been culturally as relevant.

884
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,160
We'll get there.

885
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,160
We'll get there.

886
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,160
Oh, okay.

887
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:13,840
When we get to this is, this is, I think is another point of common ground we have.

888
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,480
Cause I am the opposite of spectrum.

889
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:19,160
I'm a little guy and I find buying shoes a little difficult.

890
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:23,740
I wear smaller shoes, but I also have like wide feet towards the end.

891
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:27,600
So it's like, it's a pain in the ass.

892
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,600
What shoes do you wear?

893
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:32,760
I usually just wear Vans or Converse, but then they, they wear pretty quickly.

894
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:35,760
Uh, right where like my toes start.

895
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:36,760
That's the widest.

896
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:37,760
I like the underarmors too.

897
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,760
Hmm.

898
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,260
That's a good, good rec.

899
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:41,920
I'm a Converse lately.

900
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,680
That's what I've been wearing in the last couple of years.

901
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,720
I have some Nike though upstairs.

902
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:51,480
Uh, but Converse fit the best cause I, I have wide feet as well and it's, it's tough sometimes

903
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,160
because not a lot of shoes fit.

904
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,440
These wide feet.

905
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:55,440
Yep.

906
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,440
Yep.

907
00:36:56,440 --> 00:37:02,960
So, you know, no bow Jackson's no white feet shoes for smallies or biggies or, or, or tallies.

908
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,960
Um, sorry about the white feet gang.

909
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:06,960
Yeah.

910
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:07,960
I was in a room full of lights.

911
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:11,800
I guess, I guess the shoe palace keeps a certain part of people out.

912
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:12,800
Hmm.

913
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,800
The wides.

914
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:18,000
Um, the other thing is I, I'm, I'm having a child.

915
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
No wides.

916
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Oh really?

917
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Yeah.

918
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:25,000
If this were the first time I was hearing it.

919
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
That would be so funny if you.

920
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
What?

921
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
That was the last time I was here.

922
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,440
The last time I was here that was the episode.

923
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,440
Oh yeah.

924
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,440
Right after we recorded.

925
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:33,440
Yeah.

926
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,440
The extra one episode.

927
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,440
Don't mention having a baby.

928
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,440
Yeah.

929
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,440
Yeah.

930
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:41,680
But how beautiful if I had found out on air, what a magical real moment that would have

931
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:48,040
been just like when we, just like this whole sector, uh, inquisition that we did to you.

932
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,040
Real organic moments.

933
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,040
The next baby.

934
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:53,840
The next baby you have, if you could break it on our show, we would really appreciate

935
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:54,840
it.

936
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:55,840
Oh yeah.

937
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,840
It would be so great.

938
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:57,840
The content would be perfect.

939
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:58,840
Give us the name.

940
00:37:58,840 --> 00:37:59,840
Give us the name.

941
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:00,840
Well, you're announcing officially Bow Mundy.

942
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:01,840
Bow Mundy is great.

943
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:02,840
Little Bow Mundy expectant.

944
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:03,840
I didn't push that name.

945
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:04,840
Or even like a world event.

946
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:11,640
If you happen to see a world event happen on a phone, like when John Cena revealed that

947
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:14,960
uh, Osama Bin Laden had been eliminated or whatever.

948
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:15,960
That was Dwayne Johnson.

949
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:16,960
That was compromised.

950
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:17,960
No, no.

951
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:18,960
It was Cena.

952
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:19,960
Cena announced to a WWF.

953
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:20,960
To a permanent end.

954
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:26,000
Cena, Cena learned that Osama Bin Laden had been killed at a WWF house show while he was

955
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,560
out there and somebody whispered it to him and he got on the mic at the show and he said

956
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:33,800
that he's like, I'd like to make an announcement to the crowd.

957
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:36,960
We have Osama Bin Laden has been compromised to what was it?

958
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:37,960
A permanent end.

959
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:38,960
To a permanent end.

960
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:42,560
And the audience like roared with approval as if he just won the world title.

961
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:49,240
There was a festival going on at UCB in LA that day and the person who revealed it there

962
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:52,040
on stage during our set with Sarah Silverman.

963
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,040
Oh yeah, I remember that.

964
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,080
To like a crowd of 150.

965
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,960
And I revealed it to you.

966
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:57,960
To us.

967
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:02,400
Yes, when we were at an improv practice, you and then our friend Anthony Geo, wherever

968
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,600
he is, I remember I ran back in because I was running late.

969
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:09,680
I was running late to a meeting with a manager that's no longer I'm with.

970
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:13,520
And I was like, guys, we killed Osama Bin Laden.

971
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:14,520
We.

972
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:21,720
But Jwayne Johnson tweeted like two hours before, hey, like American flags.

973
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:23,680
He knew somehow before the news knew.

974
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,280
Why did the wrestlers know?

975
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,400
The wrestlers know all.

976
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,400
Bizarre.

977
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:31,480
John Cena and The Rock are essentially troops at this point.

978
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:32,480
That's true.

979
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:35,440
Cena still salutes when he comes out as if he was in the military, which he was not.

980
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:38,760
He just played a man in the military in a movie.

981
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:42,640
Scott and I were at a bachelor party that weekend and we got so black out drunk.

982
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:46,440
We all got on a text chain and we were like, did we do it?

983
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:47,440
Oh, yeah.

984
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:50,040
Did we done it that Saturday night in Palm Springs?

985
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,040
You forgot.

986
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:54,360
Like, yeah, we couldn't we couldn't say where what we happened that night.

987
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:57,680
Like it was the hangover and you were in a hotel room and there was a tiger and then

988
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,680
a dead Osama Bin Laden.

989
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,880
Let's not give this gold away.

990
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,440
This is Hangover 4.

991
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:06,040
We're rebooting the series.

992
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:07,040
Yeah.

993
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,040
So shoe pallets.

994
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,040
I'm having a baby.

995
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:14,200
I had to look at the baby shoes and they were like, OK, this is just a baby thing.

996
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:19,160
Baby stuff is either really, really cheap or really expensive.

997
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:24,920
And then if you put a Michael Jordan Jumpman on it, a shoe this big can be ninety nine

998
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:25,920
dollars.

999
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:26,920
Like I'm holding.

1000
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:27,920
Yeah.

1001
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:33,080
It's weird that any item that's that small, no matter what it is, could be that much money.

1002
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:37,200
I don't know if that's shoe pallets fault or Michael Jordan's gambling greed.

1003
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:41,600
But I also think it was very inappropriate of shoe pallets to have like the display of

1004
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:45,320
baby shoes, like the big sign at the top say for sale.

1005
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:46,800
Baby shoes never worn.

1006
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:47,800
What?

1007
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:48,800
What was that?

1008
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:51,800
I can get you there.

1009
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:52,800
Yes.

1010
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:53,800
Yes.

1011
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:58,400
Someone challenged Hemingway to write like a sad six word short story.

1012
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:01,040
And he came up with the phrase for sale.

1013
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,040
Baby shoes never worn.

1014
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:04,840
Sectorkeeper, you were in the Hemingway as a little boy.

1015
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:07,440
Yeah, Hemingway rules.

1016
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:10,560
Well, he is getting wiser.

1017
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:14,240
But man, you'll be father.

1018
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,240
Yeah.

1019
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:18,240
And I'm not.

1020
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:24,360
And I'm going to teach my kid not to stick to the parameters.

1021
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:26,840
Some bullshit arbitrary child.

1022
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:30,320
Oh, sets down on me.

1023
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:32,000
My kid is going to make his own life.

1024
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
All right.

1025
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,440
Fatherhood lesson number one, fourth grade.

1026
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,440
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1027
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:37,440
A staff infection.

1028
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,440
Whoa.

1029
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:39,440
He did it to himself.

1030
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,440
He's weak.

1031
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:41,440
Fatherhood lesson number one.

1032
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:45,720
Don't yell at children, especially long deceased ones.

1033
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:53,600
I think we've established that I'll yell at children or children's dads if we have to.

1034
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:58,040
You're going to there's going to be your your your child.

1035
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:02,960
I don't know how public you are about the your child will have a.

1036
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:09,080
Bizarre memory of really early on you screaming, no sectors, sectors don't apply to you.

1037
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:11,320
What was dad yelling about?

1038
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:13,000
It haunts me to this day.

1039
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:18,280
I would like to see you get into a little league dad fight with the sector keepers dad,

1040
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:19,760
wherever he may be.

1041
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,560
I think that would be.

1042
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:23,320
I played baseball.

1043
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:25,160
I want you to find my dad.

1044
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:27,120
See what I could do.

1045
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:29,120
I'll go through the little league.

1046
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:34,400
You would have played baseball right at the height of like a nightline news stories of

1047
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,720
like unhinged baseball parents.

1048
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:37,720
Yes, yes.

1049
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:39,440
I I watched those.

1050
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:40,920
I loved those.

1051
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:43,800
You never knew it would be your dad, though.

1052
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,280
What if his dad is Bo?

1053
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,280
Oh, my.

1054
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:51,360
And where Bo has been for the last few decades is processing the guilt of I'll get to where

1055
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,360
Bo's been.

1056
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:53,360
I'll get to where he's been.

1057
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:54,360
I'm not sold.

1058
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:55,360
And this is a cliffhanger.

1059
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:57,360
Well, let's get to Bucco Di Beppo.

1060
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:59,040
Bo Jackson ties into Bucco Di Beppo.

1061
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:00,160
All right, then I guess we have to.

1062
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,160
Bucco Di Beppo.

1063
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:02,160
Let's go.

1064
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:04,160
Yeah, we ate there.

1065
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:06,320
Jason, you did a separate lunch.

1066
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:07,320
I did.

1067
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:09,160
Wait, they only serve family size.

1068
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:10,160
They do not.

1069
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:15,920
They have a smaller lunch menu that is available from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.

1070
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:21,800
And I left Mike's the other day after working on podcast stuff around two fifteen.

1071
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:25,600
And I called and I said, do you still offer you still offering your lunch menu?

1072
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:27,820
And they're like, yes, until three.

1073
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:32,480
And I went up there and I had a lovely lunch because I'm very interested in a thing I've

1074
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:39,120
seen at CityWalk a number of times now of like either workers from Universal or like

1075
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:44,200
business travelers from the hotels having a solo lunch at the bars at the restaurant.

1076
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:46,680
So I was like, let's see what this experience is like.

1077
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:49,560
And I can have some authentic Italiano food.

1078
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:57,480
So I had a real authentic Italian chicken BLT with garlic fries and sweetened iced tea.

1079
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:02,360
And Saturday, then my dad, you got to write it.

1080
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:06,640
And Monday's voluntarily go into the penalty box to get a break.

1081
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:07,640
I was pretty good.

1082
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:09,760
I thought it was fine.

1083
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:11,800
I had some more stuff to do that thing.

1084
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:14,600
So I didn't want to get a big lasagna.

1085
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:20,160
You know, you miss the entire experience of what Buko De Beppo, a terrible restaurant

1086
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:30,600
is, it's multiple people figure out two dishes that would be the least offensive to them

1087
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:32,280
because it's family style.

1088
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:33,280
Yeah.

1089
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:34,280
Right.

1090
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:37,840
And no one wanted any, no one exactly wanted what we got.

1091
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:39,120
No at the restaurant.

1092
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:41,280
My wife's a vegetarian.

1093
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:42,840
We eat like birds.

1094
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:44,320
You're on a health kick.

1095
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:45,320
You're trying to work out.

1096
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:48,720
None of us wanted to be eating massive Italian food.

1097
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:51,800
And we all got the, no one was happy with the meal.

1098
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:52,800
No.

1099
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:56,880
But no one was, but it was all something someone could eat a little bit of.

1100
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:57,880
Yeah.

1101
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:01,160
We had red wine and that was the best part of the meal probably.

1102
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:02,160
Yeah.

1103
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:06,960
But it was like, there's no entree under $30 that you can get.

1104
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:10,440
It's all family style and it's like 29.99 or higher.

1105
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:14,840
So you must have just ribbon him the whole time about, are you going to spend $30 for

1106
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:15,840
one meal?

1107
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:16,840
Well, I spent $11.

1108
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:20,640
Well, he again, it was a lunch menu.

1109
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:21,640
I mean, for sure.

1110
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:26,280
If, look, if Jason Sheridan went into a Bocca di Beppo alone, especially, and he had to

1111
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:30,240
pay over $20 for a meal, he would have walked right out.

1112
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:32,480
He would have said, no, thank you, sirs and madams.

1113
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,520
So what did you guys get?

1114
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:39,200
Because like that's the Italian food you can make in such large quantities and like the

1115
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:41,200
cost of the ingredients is so low.

1116
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:42,200
Everything is expensive there.

1117
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:45,200
But like if you ordered chicken Parmesan, you got like eight of them.

1118
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:48,640
There was no taste.

1119
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:52,640
When you got to the when you got to the crust, you started tasting like something bad.

1120
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:55,880
I don't know what it was, but you would get to the crust and I would be like, how did

1121
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:57,040
it get worse?

1122
00:45:57,040 --> 00:46:01,540
And then the crust, like it tasted like the pan or like the oven and not like the fun

1123
00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:06,400
or not the cool like, wow, all the ingredients for 20 years, the height of the dinner was

1124
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:07,400
the height.

1125
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:08,400
Yeah, still.

1126
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,860
It's like the 15th best cheese bread I've ever had.

1127
00:46:10,860 --> 00:46:12,720
So what was on the pizza?

1128
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:13,720
To mushrooms.

1129
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:16,240
That was the one ingredient we could agree with.

1130
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:17,240
Yeah.

1131
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:18,240
Besides nothing vegetarians.

1132
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:19,240
OK.

1133
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:20,240
And then what was the second dish?

1134
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:21,560
It was a spicy chicken reggaeton.

1135
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:22,560
Yeah.

1136
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:25,240
And I actually a solid.

1137
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:27,120
That was much better than the pizza.

1138
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:28,120
Mm hmm.

1139
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:29,120
Sure.

1140
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:30,120
Much better.

1141
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:31,120
You wouldn't give it much.

1142
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:35,520
I'm saying the pizza is an F C minus for the chicken.

1143
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:37,160
It was all just nothing.

1144
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:39,440
Yeah, it existed.

1145
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:42,000
It was kind of a neat environment to eat.

1146
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:47,560
But it's the trick of like no one wanted to be rude or, you know, and everyone wanted

1147
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:48,560
to eat.

1148
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:53,720
So we're just like, OK, what's the bare minimum of food we could all share together?

1149
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:56,560
Because it's like bartering feelings.

1150
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:57,560
Yeah.

1151
00:46:57,560 --> 00:47:00,680
And we and we had like a lot to catch up on.

1152
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:01,960
We're good friends.

1153
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:05,920
And I wanted to hear how the baby stuff's coming.

1154
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:06,920
Sure.

1155
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:07,920
It was an enjoyable meal.

1156
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:10,760
It was an enjoyable evening with terrible food.

1157
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:11,760
Yeah.

1158
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:16,120
And we had to like sit through 10 minutes of food decisions and all this negotiation

1159
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:18,440
before we could actually talk.

1160
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:20,120
And no one wanted to be a jerk about it.

1161
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:21,120
So it was all very gingerly.

1162
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:24,360
I wanted to say being a jerk until you were here.

1163
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:25,360
But sector borders.

1164
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:26,360
Yeah.

1165
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:27,360
Yeah.

1166
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:28,360
I saved it up.

1167
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:29,360
We all know to save the best stuff for the year.

1168
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:32,960
So it's like we were all having we were like formulating what we're going to say, what

1169
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:34,960
like snarky things we'll say on the podcast.

1170
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:36,760
No, but the dinner was nice.

1171
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:37,760
Yeah.

1172
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:39,440
Dinner was terrible food, but it was real nice.

1173
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:40,440
I had a great time.

1174
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:43,400
I have some nice things to say about Bucatubeppo.

1175
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:47,800
When my taste was worse in high school, I'd go up there with groups of dorks and we'd

1176
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:53,000
have a good time and spend pretty little because if you're splitting it with six people and

1177
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:58,240
I like how sprawling that campus is, how it's multiple stories and multiple rooms that all

1178
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:00,160
have different vibes.

1179
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:01,520
There's a booth in the kitchen.

1180
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:02,520
Did you see that?

1181
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:03,520
If you walked by there, yeah.

1182
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:04,520
That was very cute.

1183
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:08,560
I think there's a standard of things that are at all Bucatubeppos and that is one of

1184
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:09,560
them.

1185
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:10,560
They have a kitchen of a chef's table.

1186
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:11,560
Do they have a pope room in every book?

1187
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:13,120
They do all have a pope room.

1188
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:17,280
We share a photograph in the pope room.

1189
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:19,720
In the pope room, there is a round table.

1190
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:22,560
Is that offensive to Catholics?

1191
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:23,560
Which I grew up being a Catholic.

1192
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:29,080
I think they got some other issues to worry about as we mentioned it fast.

1193
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:30,080
Bigger fish to fry.

1194
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:34,840
Back in my home state of Pennsylvania, a lot going on there right now with the old Catholics.

1195
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:35,840
Oh, yeah, that's right.

1196
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:36,840
There sure is.

1197
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:37,840
Were you an altar boy, sector keeper?

1198
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:38,840
Oh, no.

1199
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:46,640
I was up for it the week before I died.

1200
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:49,160
Oh, no, you were about to be.

1201
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:50,160
That might have been.

1202
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:53,160
Probably the last act is preferable.

1203
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:57,280
It was good that that happened.

1204
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:00,920
There's a table on what's the lazy Susan.

1205
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:05,840
There's a lazy Susan on top of the round table and there is a the pope's head is trapped

1206
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:11,800
in a cube in the center and taking up valuable food space unless they put the pizzas on top

1207
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:13,760
of the pope's head.

1208
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:17,520
But yeah, every book of De Beppo has the pope room and we have a nice photo.

1209
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:23,080
You can only set me free, but he's buying the picture at the end of the meal.

1210
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:24,080
Is that the pope?

1211
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:25,300
Yes, the pope.

1212
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:26,800
He's like an Italian pizza maker.

1213
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:34,120
Yeah, it's a me, the young pope, Lenny Ballardo, smoke and a young pope.

1214
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:35,120
You love young.

1215
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:39,720
Ten hours of my plus up for Bucca De Beppo is put the young pope in there and then you'll

1216
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:41,120
never have to change it again.

1217
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:43,200
You don't have to keep updating for new popes.

1218
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:44,280
And you know what?

1219
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:47,320
I'm not a food review person.

1220
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:49,040
Maybe people like Bucca De Beppo.

1221
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:51,640
That's just I have this weird expression.

1222
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:53,000
I don't like Italian.

1223
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
I grew up.

1224
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000
I'm Italian.

1225
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:58,140
So I know eating Italian food.

1226
00:49:58,140 --> 00:49:59,140
What is this?

1227
00:49:59,140 --> 00:50:00,140
I don't know.

1228
00:50:00,140 --> 00:50:04,320
He was racially profiling Jason like you were like the baseball industry.

1229
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:05,320
What were you saying?

1230
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:08,320
I was talking about my culture before I was marginalized.

1231
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:10,360
Represent your people, Mundy.

1232
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:15,720
Yeah, so I don't love Italian restaurants, especially chain restaurants.

1233
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:19,400
Olive Garden, Crab, Macaroni Girl, Crab.

1234
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:20,840
You don't like the chain Italian.

1235
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:22,640
I don't really like Italian restaurants.

1236
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:24,320
I prefer home.

1237
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:28,960
So we were starting in a deficit here just going to an Italian restaurant.

1238
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:33,080
Yeah, the sector I was put in was ill advised, which I said from the get go.

1239
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:35,520
No, you can't say that.

1240
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:38,280
He was very careful setting these rules.

1241
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:40,520
But I did respect the.

1242
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:42,600
Sure, sure.

1243
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:48,840
Also Bo Jackson, his new career is custom making.

1244
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:55,000
He became a chef and he makes like really good meals for school children.

1245
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:59,320
So I'm assuming Bo Jackson food is better than Bucca De Beppo.

1246
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:01,320
Do you think he feeds with Jamie Oliver?

1247
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:03,680
Because that was one of his crusades for a while.

1248
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:07,240
Or are they like allies in that fight?

1249
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:08,240
He's an English chef.

1250
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:09,240
He's that English chef.

1251
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:10,600
He used to have a bunch of TV shows.

1252
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:11,600
I don't know what he's doing now.

1253
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:12,600
I'll answer for Mundy.

1254
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:13,600
No, they're good friends.

1255
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:14,600
OK, great.

1256
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:15,600
Yeah, they're buds.

1257
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:22,040
I think Tiger should make a third tier part of that LCD game.

1258
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:23,040
They should bring it back.

1259
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:24,040
It should be baseball, football.

1260
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:25,600
And on the side, it's a little cooking game.

1261
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:28,440
Yeah, and he has many trays as you can.

1262
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:30,360
Yeah, flip it around.

1263
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:33,000
I mean, it could be an app game and you could just.

1264
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:37,640
This was a sector I wanted to go in with like a kind of a good attitude.

1265
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:39,520
And I tried and the food sucked.

1266
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:41,720
But it was a cool, weird restaurant.

1267
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:46,640
I like, yes, the atmosphere of Bucca De Beppo, which I say I never was in before, is like

1268
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:47,640
kind of awesome.

1269
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:54,100
Yeah, it's another like, some machos, machos where you like it's actually themed very well.

1270
00:51:54,100 --> 00:51:55,440
It's highly themed.

1271
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:59,280
If we're talking theme park experience where you do feel like you're in sort of an old

1272
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:01,960
weird restaurant, there's so many rooms.

1273
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:05,280
There's so many photos on the wall.

1274
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:07,640
We were finding many very strange photos.

1275
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:11,640
Bathroom, there's a picture of a bunch of statues with their dicks just flopping out.

1276
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:12,640
Yeah.

1277
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:17,440
There's also like a fake medicine cabinet of like old timey, like, you know, shaving

1278
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:19,160
cream around anymore.

1279
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:20,600
Like, yeah, there's a picture.

1280
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:23,120
Did you shave?

1281
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:29,440
I use the hair mane, the horse mane, like shampoo that was in there for some reason.

1282
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:32,720
I do like the idea that you would take a shower at a Bucca De Beppo.

1283
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:33,720
Yeah.

1284
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:35,080
Like in the VIP lounge.

1285
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:38,800
Don't you come down to dinner looking like that, Jason.

1286
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:42,520
There really should be some more like Italian street characters, street-mosphere characters

1287
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:43,520
at Bucca De Beppo.

1288
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:44,520
I mean, they're universal.

1289
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:45,520
They're busy, you know.

1290
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:46,520
Yeah, Jason, keep marginalizing my culture.

1291
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:50,080
Hey, look, the area I grew up in was all Italian and Irish.

1292
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:51,080
So I've eaten a lot of Italian food.

1293
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:52,080
So he's one of you, is what he's saying.

1294
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:54,640
Oh, so it's OK.

1295
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:59,480
Just like the good old boys who grew up a certain way and maybe didn't understand, changed

1296
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:00,480
cultures.

1297
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:01,480
There's the truth.

1298
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:02,480
We all shared the boats over, you know.

1299
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:07,760
So it's kind of like Yuli, who grew up in Cuba and maybe didn't understand things and

1300
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:10,560
then then apologized, yet it's still brought up.

1301
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:15,080
And then he and then he was suspended for five games and, you know, apologized to him

1302
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:16,080
now.

1303
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:17,080
All right.

1304
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:18,080
But I do agree with what you're saying.

1305
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:19,080
Ignore it.

1306
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:20,080
Not happy he didn't do it.

1307
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:26,040
But, you know, I especially when there are like there's McKelley's right down the road

1308
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:31,080
on Cuenca Ventura, like a solid Italian restaurant.

1309
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:32,800
There's Pinocchio's right here in Burbank.

1310
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:35,520
I also prefer home Italian cooking.

1311
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:39,360
But like there are better cheap, like better decent Italian places around.

1312
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:45,840
If you're going to make a point that there's better restaurants than city, why are we talking

1313
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:47,560
about restaurants outside the sector?

1314
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:54,080
I would interject, but your corruption drained my strength.

1315
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:55,080
Oh, no.

1316
00:53:55,080 --> 00:54:00,160
So Monday, I feel like Monday's been turning leaves and Jason has become more villainous.

1317
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:01,160
All of us.

1318
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:02,160
All right.

1319
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:04,720
The friendship has a blast.

1320
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:06,240
You're not being boys.

1321
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:07,240
You're being bad.

1322
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:08,240
Oh, no.

1323
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:12,760
Well, then let me let me reach out a hand of friendship.

1324
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:19,800
Me and I both went in with skepticism of this, you know, cartoon Italian restaurant.

1325
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:25,880
So we went in with skepticism and agree the food was not the most amazing.

1326
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:26,880
The skepticism.

1327
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:27,880
Yeah.

1328
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:31,560
And that's the way that that's common ground.

1329
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:32,560
So you're friends now.

1330
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:36,120
I don't think we were ever not friends.

1331
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:37,120
What do you what's your rule?

1332
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:38,120
What do you feel about afterwards?

1333
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:42,680
I work with my friends to OK, we went through our sectors and I was like, OK.

1334
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:50,760
OK, as friends, let's go to Lids locker room because two sectors back.

1335
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:54,360
Well, it's not about sectors when it's about friendship.

1336
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:57,360
We're going to a baseball game tonight.

1337
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:58,360
Yeah.

1338
00:54:58,360 --> 00:55:05,640
And Scott's wife, Erin, doesn't exactly love baseball, but she wants to go because, you

1339
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:08,520
know, my wife's there and other people are there.

1340
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:12,000
And I wanted to make her feel comfortable.

1341
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:17,640
So while while there and we were looking around, by the way, Lids locker room had both a Bo

1342
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:23,800
Jackson Raiders jersey and a Bo Jackson Kansas City jersey.

1343
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:27,440
And they even had multiple both way more bows than the Raiders store.

1344
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:28,440
Yes.

1345
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:29,440
Whoa.

1346
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:32,880
Well, that's something that real that notches down the Raider image.

1347
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:34,960
You were very impressed by that.

1348
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:35,960
Wow.

1349
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:41,600
And then so I wanted Erin to feel comfortable because we're going with a bunch of Astros

1350
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:42,600
fans.

1351
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:48,320
So I got Erin and Astros had had nothing to do with my friendship with Erin has nothing

1352
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:51,120
to do with the sectors or this podcast.

1353
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:55,960
It hasn't been clouded by bullshit like what we all do to each other's friendships.

1354
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:58,120
We rip each other apart.

1355
00:55:58,120 --> 00:55:59,120
Yeah.

1356
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:00,200
And create barriers.

1357
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:05,280
Maybe that's what you know, with Erin and I'm doing my friend's husband's podcast right

1358
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:06,280
now.

1359
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:10,080
So that doesn't illustrate the power of friendship.

1360
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:13,000
You made me see.

1361
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:16,000
I'm not done.

1362
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:26,600
Then Mike Carlson is a man who enjoys many pursuits and he has it within his heart that

1363
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:30,040
he wants to get become a baseball fan.

1364
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:35,480
And he went to a Cubs game and he keeps talking about the Cubs game because he got the best

1365
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:38,560
tickets from an old crazy millionaire.

1366
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:45,640
And he got to experience that with his dad and his dad, me and his dad have never met,

1367
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:48,600
but we're good friends because how did that happen?

1368
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:53,000
Oh, your dad's your friend to dad every day at dad's everywhere.

1369
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,000
There's something about you.

1370
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:58,200
There's there's like a genealogy or something that dad's latch onto.

1371
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:03,040
And out of all the people my dad knows exist that I'm friends with you, that he's never

1372
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:05,920
of all the people he knows that I'm friends with that he's never met.

1373
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:09,440
You were the one he's latched onto and he gave you some cards.

1374
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:11,680
He said baseball cards during the World Series.

1375
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:13,400
He was very supportive.

1376
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:15,080
He gave me some baseball cards.

1377
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:16,520
He's a big baseball fan.

1378
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:22,200
So I wanted to repay him the favor of the baseball cards by getting his son a Cubs hat

1379
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:23,900
of his favorite team.

1380
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:29,460
So maybe their strength of baseball and father and son relationship can grow even more.

1381
00:57:29,460 --> 00:57:32,560
So that's the right way because his dad already has a Cubs hat.

1382
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:34,460
Now his son has a Cubs hat.

1383
00:57:34,460 --> 00:57:37,000
My first Cubs had in probably 15, 20 years.

1384
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,400
And also you look like a beastie boy.

1385
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:39,400
And I look like a beastie boy.

1386
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:43,280
So I was not trying to bribe anyone about sectors.

1387
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:48,360
I was not trying to, you know, corrupt the system.

1388
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:56,920
What I was trying to do was bring friendship to my friend, my friend and his son's podcast

1389
00:57:56,920 --> 00:58:00,440
and my friend and her husband's podcast.

1390
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:04,560
Are you serious to the rumor that the receipt for those hats is in that National Enquirer

1391
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:05,560
safe?

1392
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:09,320
The second thing, I don't know what you're talking about.

1393
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:10,880
Are you talking about Geraldo's vault?

1394
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:12,600
Are you talking about Geraldo's vault?

1395
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:15,160
No, the safe with all the Trump dirt.

1396
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:16,440
There's a safe with Trump dirt?

1397
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:19,800
Oh yeah, the National Enquirer head has like a safe with Trump dirt.

1398
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:21,720
There's a joke about Topical News story.

1399
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:22,720
Okay, you know what?

1400
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:23,720
The guy was granted immunity.

1401
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:24,720
Get in there.

1402
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:26,200
You should just get in the box.

1403
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:27,640
No, this is my show.

1404
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:29,480
You should say Trump.

1405
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:30,480
You should say Trump.

1406
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:31,480
Oh, Donald Trump.

1407
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:32,480
He's a business man.

1408
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:33,480
From this pizza commercial.

1409
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:34,480
You know what I'm talking about.

1410
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:37,000
Trump's so funny with Kevin McAllister.

1411
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,800
Yeah, he is pretty.

1412
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:42,800
Things went a little awry with old Trump and you'll, you'll hope, maybe hopefully you won't

1413
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:44,700
have to catch up on all of it.

1414
00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:48,080
Maybe it'll be solved by the time your soul is free.

1415
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:57,600
For a sector that includes Bukita Beppo, bad man made the experience family style.

1416
00:58:57,600 --> 00:59:01,760
Oh yeah, you're very right.

1417
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:07,480
And I think what I was, I would thought this might end up being a combative episode and

1418
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:13,600
I guess at times it was, but I think it's ended up being extremely heartwarming.

1419
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:17,520
And you know what you bring up Donald Trump, just to catch you up, Donald Trump is talking

1420
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:24,200
about building walls between the US and Mexico and splitting up families and that kind of

1421
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:25,200
thing.

1422
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:26,200
Yeah.

1423
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:32,000
And, and you know, maybe I'm learning a lesson here, which is that division and putting stores

1424
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,800
into different arbitrary boxes.

1425
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:41,360
Maybe it only splits us up and makes us fight and hurts friendship bonds and family bonds.

1426
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:46,080
Maybe I don't know, maybe sectors are what's truly bad.

1427
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:49,680
Am I bad man?

1428
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:50,680
Are you the devil?

1429
00:59:50,680 --> 00:59:51,680
Yes.

1430
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:52,680
Oh my God.

1431
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:57,960
But as we've learned, I think there's, I think there's hope for you.

1432
00:59:57,960 --> 00:59:58,960
Yes.

1433
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:01,760
We've, we've all, this has been such a transformative experience.

1434
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:06,680
And if we have in fact learned that you were the devil, I think you can become all the

1435
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:08,320
way good once more.

1436
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:09,720
Thank you.

1437
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:11,680
Boys, boys, thank you.

1438
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:13,720
Look what it is.

1439
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:15,360
It's the stone.

1440
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:16,680
It's a sector 11 stone.

1441
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:17,680
We unlock the sector stone.

1442
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:19,120
We always get a stone at the end.

1443
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:29,160
It's half Bo Jackson Royals Jersey, half Bo Jackson Raiders Jersey, Zubas pants, Raiders

1444
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:34,120
hats, and a big bowl of pasta with a wide shoe in it.

1445
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:35,600
Well, what a shoe.

1446
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:36,600
Wow.

1447
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:38,880
That's a complicated, complicated stone.

1448
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:40,320
These are all things I'll wear.

1449
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:41,320
Yeah.

1450
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:42,320
Yeah.

1451
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:43,320
You've never been so represented in one sector.

1452
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:44,320
Thank you sector boy.

1453
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:45,320
Keeper, oh keeper.

1454
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:49,840
I think we all are going to have to hug it out after this.

1455
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:50,840
Yeah.

1456
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:54,680
This, I'm so happy that this ended on such an uplifting note.

1457
01:00:54,680 --> 01:01:00,000
And while we will continue to go through city walk sector by sector, I don't know.

1458
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,000
I do.

1459
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:07,080
I kind of, when this is done, I think, uh, I don't think we should, I think, I think

1460
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:10,320
maybe the sector system has to be dismantled once and for all.

1461
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:15,760
Well, I think this, this is a story of, of, you know, saving the sector keeper soul and

1462
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:17,400
it's redemption.

1463
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:21,680
So to go back to Christian iconography, it's like the reverse story of Lucifer.

1464
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:24,180
Lucifer was an angel who fell from heaven.

1465
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:29,600
You are getting out of hell and being elevated to a high point.

1466
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:34,800
City walk is on a tall hill and soon you will ascend from city walk when we finally free

1467
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:35,800
you.

1468
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:40,560
I died when I was in fourth grade, but I think I understand what you said.

1469
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:41,560
Yes.

1470
01:01:41,560 --> 01:01:42,560
Yes.

1471
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:46,440
City walk is kind of a Holy land and maybe all of these sector talks are like the disputes

1472
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:49,640
between the borders, but we've found peace here today.

1473
01:01:49,640 --> 01:01:54,640
I like to think of city walk is like a rainbow bridge sort of as a conduit to different worlds

1474
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:55,640
and different realities.

1475
01:01:55,640 --> 01:01:57,960
Mundy, what do you like to think of city walk?

1476
01:01:57,960 --> 01:02:03,680
Can we do an appitow style, uh, alt run on what we think city walk is like?

1477
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:08,180
It's that bullshit place where they screwed you out of your valet ticket and they said

1478
01:02:08,180 --> 01:02:09,180
we got there early.

1479
01:02:09,180 --> 01:02:10,180
Talk about that.

1480
01:02:10,180 --> 01:02:11,180
That's in a different sector.

1481
01:02:11,180 --> 01:02:12,180
That's sector 19.

1482
01:02:12,180 --> 01:02:13,180
Sector 19.

1483
01:02:13,180 --> 01:02:14,180
Sector 19.

1484
01:02:14,180 --> 01:02:15,180
Okay.

1485
01:02:15,180 --> 01:02:16,180
Look, before this all unravels again.

1486
01:02:16,180 --> 01:02:17,180
I'm hiding out there.

1487
01:02:17,180 --> 01:02:18,180
What do you do?

1488
01:02:18,180 --> 01:02:19,180
Sector 19.

1489
01:02:19,180 --> 01:02:22,720
Oh no, he's going to punch through the screen door.

1490
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:23,720
No.

1491
01:02:23,720 --> 01:02:25,320
Um, Mundy, thanks for being on podcast.

1492
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:26,320
Thank you.

1493
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:27,320
Thank you for having me again.

1494
01:02:27,320 --> 01:02:28,320
I can't.

1495
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:30,320
Can we talk about some rides next time?

1496
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:31,320
No.

1497
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:32,320
Maybe.

1498
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:33,320
Yeah.

1499
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:34,320
I appreciate on that.

1500
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:35,320
Uh, all right.

1501
01:02:35,320 --> 01:02:36,800
We'll see at the baseball game tonight.

1502
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:37,800
Yeah.

1503
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:38,800
Yeah.

1504
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:40,280
We'll try to put all this behind us.

1505
01:02:40,280 --> 01:02:42,440
Um, and set sector keeper.

1506
01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:43,440
Do you want to?

1507
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:45,920
By the way, the dizzy used to own the angel stadium.

1508
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:50,480
So there's, uh, and I was going to say, maybe if you want to have a little fun, like from

1509
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:55,440
a popular movie, if you wanted to swing down to the angel stadium and maybe help some of

1510
01:02:55,440 --> 01:03:02,260
the players, uh, make some catches and do some batting, Danny Glover, he, there's, uh,

1511
01:03:02,260 --> 01:03:03,260
he might be there.

1512
01:03:03,260 --> 01:03:04,260
I'm not sure.

1513
01:03:04,260 --> 01:03:06,120
He knows angels in the outfield, but he doesn't know mighty ducks.

1514
01:03:06,120 --> 01:03:10,520
I think it's about rec a city walk opened in 93 and then, and that was when as you give

1515
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:12,880
me strength, I remember pop culture.

1516
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:13,880
Yeah.

1517
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:15,880
It's all he would be.

1518
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:20,080
Hey, if you help the angels tonight, I swear to God, I will go the news.

1519
01:03:20,080 --> 01:03:25,360
I will, if you help the angels, I will, I will bring the whole thing down.

1520
01:03:25,360 --> 01:03:26,780
Okay, great.

1521
01:03:26,780 --> 01:03:29,440
So we are ending on threatening our ghost child.

1522
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:30,440
Uh, he's a devil.

1523
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:34,080
He just said he might angels in the outfield, the Astros are playing the angels.

1524
01:03:34,080 --> 01:03:35,800
I'm not going to like, we're in a pen race.

1525
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:36,800
Okay.

1526
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:37,800
The angels are shit right now.

1527
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:41,880
I'm not going to let some angel, like he helped the team might try to catch more balls.

1528
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:43,920
First of all, he's actually kind of established.

1529
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:44,920
He's more of a little devil.

1530
01:03:44,920 --> 01:03:45,920
Let's be honest.

1531
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:50,200
So like a little devil, you know, who likes little devils, little stinkers.

1532
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:53,040
Are you calling yourself a little stinker?

1533
01:03:53,040 --> 01:03:54,040
All right.

1534
01:03:54,040 --> 01:03:55,040
Fair enough.

1535
01:03:55,040 --> 01:03:56,040
All right.

1536
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:58,760
So we'll stinker.

1537
01:03:58,760 --> 01:03:59,760
Thank you, bad man.

1538
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:05,640
Hopefully tonight at the angels game, there are no devils in the outfield.

1539
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:06,640
See you tomorrow.

1540
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:07,640
Everyone.

1541
01:04:07,640 --> 01:04:08,640
