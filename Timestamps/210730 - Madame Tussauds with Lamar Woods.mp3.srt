1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,840
Forever.

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:04,160
Dog.

courtesy of special guest Lamar Woods.

8
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:24,960
It's Madame Tussauds on podcast The Ride.

9
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:49,160
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, the theme park podcast hosted by three men who are so polite

10
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:51,900
they asked permission to take a photo with a wax figure.

11
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:54,200
My name is Mike Carlson, I choked a little bit on the intro.

12
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,360
Jason Sheridan joining me as always.

13
00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:00,280
Yeah, yeah, I was asking anyone I saw,

14
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,160
which turned out to be more wax figures

15
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,360
because some of the rooms are a little dark.

16
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,840
Oh, you're saying you couldn't tell the difference

17
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,040
between a human and a wax figure.

18
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,280
I see how late night shows get away with,

19
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:13,040
like Arnold Schwarzenegger pretends to be the wax figure

20
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:13,960
and then jumps out.

21
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:14,800
Oh, I see what you're saying.

22
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,440
Yeah, when they prank, there was an Ozzy Osbourne prank

23
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,620
where he was pranking people.

24
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:19,720
And I will say, we'll get to this,

25
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:23,320
but I did go to Madame Tussauds,

26
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,240
is how I believe it's pronounced.

27
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,240
And we'll figure if we have somebody who will tell us

28
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,640
exactly what the right answer is.

29
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,480
But.

30
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,440
Probably one thing he can tell us, yeah, I think.

31
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:35,280
But I very much felt like these are coming to life.

32
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,520
Like I had this body reaction to them,

33
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,360
but we'll get to that.

34
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,560
Scott Gertner here joining us.

35
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:42,680
Hi, yeah, no, and you gotta ask for selfie permission.

36
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:45,320
Just, yeah, just cause they're fake doesn't mean

37
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,560
consent's not in the picture.

38
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,600
Right, wax, yeah, wax figures.

39
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,800
And I would, like, they felt like a mental agreement.

40
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,920
They like kind of give me a yes.

41
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,480
Elton John would say yes, you are allowed.

42
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,680
Yes, you are allowed.

43
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,120
They're human shaped, feels weird.

44
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,140
But I honestly, I will say this,

45
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:05,760
I was not expecting to have a ton to talk about today.

46
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,160
I have so much to talk about after going yesterday.

47
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,000
Oh yeah.

48
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,120
Like, so I'm very, very excited.

49
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,160
I went to this place thinking,

50
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,080
ah, I'm gonna probably just make some jokes about it.

51
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,280
Who gives a shit?

52
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:21,280
I'll say this, I came away, I love wax museums.

53
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,120
I am a wax figure.

54
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,240
Well, don't hang on, don't go pluralizing that

55
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:28,640
because Madame Tussauds is like the champagne brand.

56
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,480
All right, that's fair.

57
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,880
There's some other wax museums that are a little iffier.

58
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:32,840
Although you might like those more,

59
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,840
I think maybe I like them more.

60
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,200
I like the prettier ones more.

61
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,300
I just, I'm in it, I'm into it now.

62
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,640
And I didn't realize I was a wax guy.

63
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,840
But I am a wax guy now.

64
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,080
Let's bring our guest in to really give us the expertise.

65
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,980
He's a writer, an improviser, and a musician.

66
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:51,000
He's writing on the upcoming show Grand Cru.

67
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,760
Improvising with the group White Women.

68
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,640
And he's got an album coming out very soon.

69
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,460
He's doing a lot.

70
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:56,360
Lamar Woods is here.

71
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,920
Hey, what's up y'all?

72
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,760
What's happening?

73
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,600
Hey. Thanks for having me.

74
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,680
Thanks for coming.

75
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:04,080
Excited to talk about wax, I guess.

76
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,680
Oh man, it was so great to hear.

77
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,720
I didn't realize y'all went like two yesterday.

78
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,560
So that's great.

79
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,680
And it's always the same thing where people are like,

80
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,800
wax museum, whatever.

81
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,880
They go and they fucking love it after.

82
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,600
It's like, it's just like,

83
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,560
you don't know until you've done it for sure.

84
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,200
It's like a beautiful experience.

85
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,080
Yeah, really.

86
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,360
I came out like grinning, I think.

87
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,000
And I was so tired going in.

88
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,360
I was like, yeah, I gotta get this done.

89
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,880
This is for work.

90
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:29,920
I'm from a theme park journal.

91
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,760
This is for work.

92
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,580
And I came up going,

93
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:35,560
I'm going to every one of these in any city I'm in, I think.

94
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,400
Well, I was curious.

95
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,600
I'm gonna ask y'all questions too,

96
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,600
cause I haven't been there in a long time.

97
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,040
So I'm actually curious how it is.

98
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,540
Like I worked there for seven years,

99
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:48,200
but I stopped, I quit probably about six years ago.

100
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,280
So I haven't really been since.

101
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,840
So I'm curious what y'all experienced.

102
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,440
I'm curious what figures are still there.

103
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,560
Well, we have photos.

104
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,380
Oh, really?

105
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:55,220
Oh, great.

106
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:56,060
Yes.

107
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,360
I want to talk about our experience,

108
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,360
but we should just say this all at the top.

109
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:03,560
Your situation with Madame Tussauds.

110
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,800
Are we right about that, first of all?

111
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,960
I mean, I've always said Tussauds,

112
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,200
but I don't know anymore.

113
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,120
The way y'all saying it sounds like,

114
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,480
cause I was always like,

115
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,200
never really have respect for the old guard.

116
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,800
So I was out there butchering the name.

117
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,720
I was like, fuck Madame Muzelle, whatever.

118
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,880
But no, she's cool.

119
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,840
But it was like, so I could be saying it wrong,

120
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,880
but what makes y'all think it was Tussauds?

121
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,720
Well, the reason I think it's Tussauds

122
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,400
is because Spider-Man said it in the 4D movie

123
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,520
at the end of the whole tour yesterday.

124
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,360
Really?

125
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,680
Now did any of us do that?

126
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,520
I didn't do that.

127
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,340
Jason and I did it.

128
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:39,180
Okay.

129
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:40,000
All right, all right.

130
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,840
All right, that's probably what it is then,

131
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,000
cause they would have quality checked that for sure.

132
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,120
That's why I thought it.

133
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,880
But if you look at you, Jason said this too.

134
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,680
And if you look at the YouTube videos,

135
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,200
even the stuff that's like official company video stuff

136
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,880
will say different like pronunciation.

137
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,520
So I don't know if there's even.

138
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,320
Some are saying Tussauds and there's like YouTube videos

139
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,120
of like, how do you pronounce this French name?

140
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,600
And they're saying Tussauds.

141
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,840
Somebody said Tussaur and I went, what the hell?

142
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:07,680
That doesn't even are there.

143
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,960
I wonder if it's, yeah, I bet there's a story there.

144
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,720
I bet it's probably shamed over time.

145
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,760
But I feel like Tussauds is the way we all said it.

146
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,600
Like Madame Tussauds is how I've always said it.

147
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,720
That's how I've always said it.

148
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,560
Yeah, yeah.

149
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,680
Until I felt like I was being like smarty pants yesterday.

150
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,600
Like I know the real way to say it.

151
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,440
I know.

152
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,680
I'm gonna go back to Tussauds just to,

153
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,100
for my own relaxation.

154
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,920
Every time I say Tussauds.

155
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,760
Tussauds, so tense.

156
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:34,040
It feels a little like, elegant, like a little too like bougie.

157
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,960
Like that's probably what they called it back in the,

158
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,680
did y'all watch the little, the history of Madame Tussauds?

159
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,960
Like where, like how it all started?

160
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,600
There was like, I saw some British made thing.

161
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,200
There was like very dry.

162
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,560
Yeah, like it's in the behind the scenes.

163
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,920
There's like a section out there before you end.

164
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,760
Oh yeah, at the end.

165
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,600
Like did you.

166
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,680
Oh wait, no, in the museum?

167
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,520
No, I didn't see it in the museum.

168
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,360
Oh, okay.

169
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,200
Okay, okay.

170
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:57,280
There's like a segment in a museum called Behind the Scenes

171
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,320
and there's like a documentary that shows like

172
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,240
how she started and stuff.

173
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,680
And, but we could get into that,

174
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,480
but I guess I should explain my relationship to the museum.

175
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:08,760
Yeah, you're here because you used to work

176
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,040
for this organization.

177
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,560
So yeah, it's totally random.

178
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,720
There's no, I had no like,

179
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,840
I had no awareness of wax museums or anything

180
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,760
before I moved to LA, but I was just,

181
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,640
I just moved to LA like every other person

182
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:22,160
who wants to be in the Hollywood industry.

183
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,960
And then I, I needed a job.

184
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,880
So I worked like, I was working like three different jobs

185
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,720
at the time.

186
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,560
I was working like at the, at the movie theater,

187
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,240
at the, shout out to Pacific theaters, rest in peace.

188
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,880
And then also I was working at a Hollywood video,

189
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:35,720
rest in peace.

190
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,720
Damn, everywhere I worked, it's like,

191
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,440
God, at least not Madame Tussauds though.

192
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,800
So Madame Tussauds was just a part-time job I had.

193
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,800
And I worked inside, you know,

194
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,840
like when I first moved to LA, just trying to survive.

195
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,080
And we did like these, you know, when you walked in,

196
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,800
you probably experienced this, you walk in,

197
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,520
there's like these employees that are trying

198
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,800
to take pictures of you with the wax figures,

199
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,480
and then they sell it to you at the end.

200
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,160
So I was one of those guys just like,

201
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,920
hey, come on, get a pic with Shrek or whatever.

202
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:05,760
And so I did that for like a year

203
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,280
and I was pretty good at it.

204
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,960
I'm like good at making people like smile.

205
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:14,960
And then, and then also Madame Tussauds was very big on like,

206
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,760
they're part of, just to give you context,

207
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,800
they're part of a corporation called,

208
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,000
I'm blanking on it right now.

209
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,360
Their current owner is, or manager, they sold,

210
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,200
there's a weird-

211
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,020
They sell it somewhere else?

212
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:29,860
Yeah.

213
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:32,680
Merlin Entertainment is who runs them.

214
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,400
But they did, they sold it to someone

215
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,520
and then leased it back.

216
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,360
It's one of those sorts of things.

217
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,200
Oh, I didn't know about that.

218
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,040
But Merlin is operating.

219
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,200
Which is like, I didn't realize it was like a huge,

220
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:47,520
in the UK, like a huge theme park business.

221
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,680
They have like a bunch of stuff,

222
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,400
like the London Eye and all that.

223
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,240
So it's like a pretty intense corporation,

224
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,040
but they're very big on like promoting people,

225
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,080
like within, right?

226
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,360
So I'm just doing good, like I'm a young employee.

227
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,600
Then they asked me to be like a little supervisor

228
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,320
and of the photo people.

229
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,760
I was still working on the floor,

230
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:08,080
but I was also like doing schedules and stuff.

231
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,280
And I was like, you know, doing my thing.

232
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:13,000
And then I just got like, I just, all of a sudden,

233
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,640
I had this like idea that like revolutionized

234
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,720
the entire business.

235
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,160
Because first of all, when they first moved to Hollywood,

236
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,480
they were not doing that good.

237
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:26,560
It was like, we, they opened up and I think, you know,

238
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,640
it's kind of funny because I think people don't realize

239
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,600
Hollywood Boulevard is so shitty.

240
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,440
So I was like, I think they like, we're coming,

241
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,360
they did huge grand open, Garcetti's there,

242
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,840
before he was mayor, for some reason, I remember his image.

243
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:41,200
And because we had the wax figure

244
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,440
of the other mayor before him, but they were like,

245
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,320
you know, it was a full grand opening and they,

246
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,440
we opened and it's just like two people a day,

247
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,240
like just like no one coming.

248
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,000
But then, so we're like really in the,

249
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,600
I don't know if I should be putting all the business

250
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,760
out there like that, but we were like really like

251
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,600
not doing well.

252
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,600
So the photo department, I would put in charge of,

253
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,040
so you know, it's a lot of this,

254
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,320
we had this new boss come in,

255
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,680
cause he's coming in to shape things up from the UK, right?

256
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,440
He's like this short guy named Colin.

257
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:14,640
He was like really, you know, really business minded,

258
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,320
like doesn't play around, like he's like,

259
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,240
I don't care, where's the money?

260
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,720
Like that's kind of how he is.

261
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,680
And then he's like, so he puts me in charge,

262
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,160
he's like, we need to figure out how to like

263
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,280
make some money here.

264
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,840
So I came up with this whole prices structure

265
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:32,000
for the photos and it was so smooth too,

266
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,080
cause it was like, I don't know,

267
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,560
I wanna break it all down to put the secrets out there.

268
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:38,000
But basically what I did was like,

269
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,760
I had this, we had this USB thing that if you,

270
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,240
that's our most expensive thing, right?

271
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,960
It was like 35 bucks.

272
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:48,480
So what I would do is like, it was such a simple thing.

273
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,600
They were taking, the people were taking pictures of,

274
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,800
like say you go in there, right?

275
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,760
They take a picture of you and you do one pose

276
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,920
and then they take another one and then they let you go.

277
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,160
But what I was doing, I was like,

278
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,920
I was coming up with like three different poses

279
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:04,400
that are fucking awesome and the one, all of them.

280
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:07,240
And then what happened is they always would buy the USB

281
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,280
cause they couldn't make a decision on which one they liked.

282
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,360
So they would take all of them.

283
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,040
So it was like every transaction was like

284
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,600
almost $35 transaction.

285
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,560
It was like, boom, the shit just like skyrocketed, right?

286
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,920
So then I'm like, all of a sudden we got the most,

287
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:21,440
the number one photo department in the country.

288
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,840
Like, cause you know, we got massive sales all over the,

289
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,880
all over the world or whatever.

290
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,720
So.

291
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,560
Yeah, there's tons of them, dozens of them.

292
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,920
Yeah, so then I got promoted again and I'm now like,

293
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:36,280
I'm like the guest experience manager

294
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,200
and I'm running the, that inside.

295
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:41,200
And then I get, I get, no, I got promoted to something else.

296
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,920
It was like something between, which is all bullshit.

297
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,920
It was just like different ways of like paying me

298
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,280
the same amount of money.

299
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:49,520
But like then I like got promoted to guest experience manager

300
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,600
and I was like fully like in a suit

301
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,400
and I'm like running this place and I'm like,

302
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:56,200
it's like, like this is like my career at this point.

303
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,600
So I have a huge relationship with that museum

304
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,920
and I did that for seven years.

305
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,400
And then, and then I, and then I, you know,

306
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,800
started my writing career, but I'll never forget it.

307
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,600
Cause it taught me everything I know about life.

308
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,600
And it's like, I literally like,

309
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,920
I get to point to everything aspect of my career

310
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,760
and my life right now and say that I learned something,

311
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,960
some of it at Wax, at Madame Tussauds Hollywood for sure.

312
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,800
Wow.

313
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,640
That's wild.

314
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,400
It sounds like you saved the bit,

315
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,520
like saved the Hollywood location.

316
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,680
That seems accurate.

317
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,960
I'm not gonna toot my own horn, but you know,

318
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:32,120
I would say between Collin, that guy Collin came in,

319
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:35,400
like he, I think he saw something in me and he was like,

320
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,720
this guy's gonna help me turn around.

321
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,000
Cause I think I would, I would give the credit to him.

322
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,480
I'm just assuming he's listening.

323
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,320
Sure.

324
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,440
Yeah. He's like, thank you Collin.

325
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,320
But I think, you know, he, he was kind of like

326
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,280
a little bit of a mentor in a way where he,

327
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,600
he just taught me a lot about business and stuff

328
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,320
and like how that shit works.

329
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:54,520
But, but yeah, no, we took that shit from like struggling

330
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,440
to like actually making money for sure.

331
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,840
It was, it was cool.

332
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,560
But yeah, and I had like people knew about me.

333
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,240
It was like, I was getting awards and stuff.

334
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,080
It was crazy.

335
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,240
I was like a wax man.

336
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,320
I was the wax man.

337
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,840
I had, I had it going on.

338
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:09,560
Like man, I was doing it and my girlfriend worked in,

339
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,400
I was dating this girl.

340
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,440
She worked in events.

341
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,240
So me and her were like a power couple.

342
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,080
Wow.

343
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,920
Yeah.

344
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,040
It was wild, man.

345
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:17,880
It was like a life.

346
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,480
It was a life for sure.

347
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:23,080
Would you go to like, here's this like company wide banquet

348
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,000
where then you got a trophy or something?

349
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Yeah, we had those.

350
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,640
We would do some at the, at the music,

351
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:30,280
at the rooftop on the, and it went in Hollywood

352
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,600
and we would go to Vegas because there's one in Vegas

353
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,920
and we would go there a lot.

354
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,880
And then it got to the point where they were sending me

355
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,080
around to teach all the other ones,

356
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,360
this pricing structure and all the things we were doing.

357
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,120
So even going to like, I went to Legoland and like,

358
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,920
cause that's also part of Merlin and like all these other

359
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:46,760
places. Oh wow.

360
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:49,720
And yeah, it was like, I was like a full on corporate

361
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,360
like amusement park guy.

362
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:54,040
It was very, it was very rewarding.

363
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,120
Getting flown around.

364
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,080
So you're in Vegas on other people's diamonds.

365
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:57,920
So this is amazing.

366
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:58,760
Yeah, yeah.

367
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,720
Like they're giving me like a stipend and stuff, you know,

368
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,560
being in hotels.

369
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,400
Wow.

370
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,240
Yeah, yeah.

371
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,760
But you know, so that's my relationship.

372
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:08,120
So, you know, I mean, it was not an easy job because middle

373
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,760
man, when you're doing middle management,

374
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,560
which was mostly what I was doing was,

375
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,400
that's always just a nightmare cause people don't ever

376
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,360
want to listen to you and stuff.

377
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,360
But yeah, that's, that's, that's my relationship with.

378
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,200
Wow.

379
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:22,880
That's wild.

380
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,920
Was there any consideration, were you ever like,

381
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:28,920
I could take over Merlin entertainment if I kept going.

382
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,640
Like I could be the head of this whole company.

383
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,840
I definitely, I mean, definitely it was a possibility.

384
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,880
Cause that's what they want.

385
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,720
They want that.

386
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,880
They want, they don't even, they, they, like,

387
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:40,920
if you look at all their CEOs, even the guy Colin,

388
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,040
or like all the people who run it, they've, you could,

389
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,160
pretty much everyone will tell you they started at the

390
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,400
bottom and like, that's like part of the story.

391
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,560
So it definitely seemed like a realistic out.

392
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,240
I mean, I know I didn't never want to do that.

393
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:54,640
Like, I was like, I want to be,

394
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,360
I want to be a rapper slash comedian.

395
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,880
That I want to be Donald Glover when I grow up.

396
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,080
But yeah, it's like a very funny thing though.

397
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,920
Cause you don't, I don't know how, like,

398
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:05,920
I was like, how would I have really survived out here if I

399
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,080
never got the promotion?

400
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,480
Cause I was only making like,

401
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,080
it seems like so little money now,

402
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:13,280
but it was like $10 an hour, you know, doing that.

403
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,360
And then living in LA.

404
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,560
So then the promotion getting like bumped up to like 12 or

405
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,240
like 15 was enough for me to feel like, okay,

406
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:24,520
I can actually live here in this city, you know?

407
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:28,960
But, but yeah, not, not, I never liked it.

408
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:31,800
It was terrible.

409
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,280
And then running like seminars,

410
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,920
you have to go into a city and then like teach people how to

411
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,280
do a system that is, that is kind of, yeah,

412
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,880
it's sort of dry.

413
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:42,720
I'll tell you what's cool.

414
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,960
Like the cool stuff was like the, like the behind the scenes,

415
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,600
like seeing how they work, like how they, they like,

416
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,000
the one of the funnest times I ever had was like,

417
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,600
we had the Tupac wax figure.

418
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,240
So every time they, they do a release of a new figure,

419
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,200
it's like a party, right?

420
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:01,160
So they get the red carpet out and it's like,

421
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,400
as if the wax figure is gonna walk down there.

422
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:07,480
But like they had basically, you know, it was on the radio.

423
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,280
They got, I think they partnered with,

424
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,480
have my memories like gone,

425
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,960
but the radio station in LA that plays like,

426
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,200
basically 90s hip hop.

427
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,320
I forgot what it's called,

428
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:22,160
but they partnered with them and they had this party on the

429
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,240
roof for the release.

430
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:26,000
And then like Bone Thugs and Harmony came and DJ Quick was

431
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,760
there and I like basically got to party with them like all

432
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:32,720
night cause we went out, we went out after and I got to hang

433
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,800
out with them and I like, that was like fucking dope.

434
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,400
And it was like, that was so cool.

435
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,320
Bone Thugs.

436
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,800
Did you connect with one of them in particular?

437
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:40,640
Or the other?

438
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,760
Wait, I connect with Busy Bone.

439
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:45,880
I mean, Busy is like, I'm a busy guy too.

440
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,560
I'm a manager.

441
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,640
I got a lot of things going on.

442
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,720
So I understand where you're going through Busy Bone.

443
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,560
It's hard, man.

444
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:52,720
You get overwhelmed, you know?

445
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,920
But no, it wasn't like, we weren't like really like talking

446
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,680
like that, but it was cool to just like kick it,

447
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,040
like be in the same facility as him for sure.

448
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:00,880
Oh my God.

449
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,700
That's great.

450
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,000
I mean, they really go, like you said,

451
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,640
they go all out when they unveil a new one.

452
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,000
I imagine partly because of what they invent,

453
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,040
like it takes hundreds and hundreds of hours to sculpt

454
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:12,880
the wax figure.

455
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,040
And like the average number that they kept throwing around

456
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:20,080
was like one wax figure cost over $300,000 to make.

457
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,080
Yeah, they're so expensive.

458
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:25,840
And it is like when you made a good point, Jason,

459
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:28,760
of like, or no, I think you made the point that was like,

460
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,720
it ain't just no regular wax resam.

461
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,800
Like those other wax resams ain't doing this.

462
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:37,040
So they're like really taking their time

463
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,760
and getting the celebrity involved

464
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:41,480
and the celebrity approves the outfits, like the piano.

465
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,240
I don't know if you saw the piano that Elton John

466
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,880
was sitting at or he has a piano behind him.

467
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,480
He's standing now.

468
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,080
There's no piano, I don't think.

469
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,720
I was like, there's no big red piano with him.

470
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,080
I didn't see the big red piano.

471
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,920
But that's like his piano, like that's like his actual one.

472
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,880
So it's like, they have like a lot of buy-in

473
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:01,800
with all the, you know, thing, which is cool.

474
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,160
But yeah, like speaking of, it's funny though,

475
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,080
cause I will say, you know, if you want some real, you know,

476
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:08,840
tea, I'll give y'all some real wax figure,

477
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:11,280
if you want to hear some wax figure war.

478
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:15,000
A little wax tea with some honey.

479
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,720
But that, so one of our biggest challenges

480
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,560
was the other wax museum.

481
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:23,320
So there was another one that was there before us

482
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:25,040
called Hollywood Wax Museum.

483
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:28,600
That's like not, cause it was more like by Hollywood

484
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,760
and Highland next to the Chinese Theater

485
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,360
and the other one's like over, like across Highland

486
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,880
by the Ripley's.

487
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,000
It's kind of like part of that.

488
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,440
They're all like part of that kind of,

489
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,080
it was almost like the blessed,

490
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,360
it was like two different worlds.

491
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,000
Like we don't even fuck with them.

492
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,920
So they, so the irony was interesting.

493
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,880
I didn't realize, we thought they were taking business

494
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,640
from us, but what they really were doing

495
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,680
was actually hurting our brand.

496
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:54,120
So it would be like, what was happening was people

497
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,760
were going to the wax museum, the Hollywood one,

498
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,600
and then being like, I was at Madame Tussauds

499
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,880
and like the wax figures weren't that great, right?

500
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,200
So they were, so we had this whole thing

501
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,600
where we were getting in like a lot of trouble

502
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,240
with the corporate side, the UK guys over there.

503
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,080
Cause they're like, man, what the fuck's going on?

504
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:13,160
Why is this wax museum even exists?

505
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,440
You should be the only wax museum on the whole block.

506
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,760
They're like, I want that shit gone, shut it down.

507
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:23,440
And then, so I'm like, so here, this is one

508
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,600
of the most difficult things for me as a manager, right?

509
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,480
Because so all the employees are cool as hell.

510
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,600
They're like, they're not, they're like, a lot of them

511
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,120
are like LA natives, like they're like from LA

512
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,000
and they like just working or whatever.

513
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,320
And like young, you know, young kids or whatever.

514
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,240
So they're friends with a lot of people that work at

515
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,760
the wax museum, right?

516
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:43,000
So, cause they're all like, kind of know each other.

517
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,120
Then, so now there's a whole new director where he's like,

518
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,600
we need to shut this place down, right?

519
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,360
So I'm like, whatever, okay.

520
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:53,840
And then it's like so stressful, right?

521
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:57,400
So then I go, so he's like, so I'll never forget.

522
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,520
I hope Colin don't hear this.

523
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,280
He should not, don't let him hear this.

524
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,600
I don't know if he can control that.

525
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,520
But don't tag him in there.

526
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,320
Just one phone doesn't get to hear it.

527
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:08,680
Colin, you did corporate espionage for wax museum.

528
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:11,200
I know, like what?

529
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,400
So, so basically we did this.

530
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,920
So there was this whole campaign where we would like,

531
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:20,200
they printed out these big ass billboards,

532
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:24,160
which basically had pictures of the Hollywood wax museum

533
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,080
of like Nicole Kidman, right?

534
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,880
And then it would have our version of it.

535
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:30,200
And you could just see like how shitty theirs was.

536
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,240
It was so bad.

537
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,160
And it was like, now that I think about it,

538
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,280
it wasn't that bad, but it felt like really immoral.

539
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:40,000
So we had to, so we were, it was like in the front

540
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,600
of the building and it was like, look at the difference.

541
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,760
This is what we doing.

542
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,360
That's what they're doing, right?

543
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:50,360
So, you know, so my employees were like upset about this.

544
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,800
They were like, we're not, we don't want to put this place

545
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:53,680
out of business.

546
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,720
This is bad business practice.

547
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:58,000
And I feel them because it's like,

548
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,920
if they go out of business, like that's a lot of their friends

549
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,760
get, you know, get laid off and stuff.

550
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:05,240
So then I was like, but then my bosses were like,

551
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,080
you have to do this.

552
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,040
We have to put these out every morning.

553
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:12,640
And it was like so crazy because it would be like,

554
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,880
I would be like, you know, trying to like,

555
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,880
it's hard to like, please both party.

556
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,480
Cause I was like, well, I don't want to get in trouble

557
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,360
cause I'm not doing what they're saying.

558
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:22,240
But also I don't want the, all the employees mad at me.

559
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,200
Like I'm like this big corporate arm or whatever.

560
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,920
Cause like, I don't give a shit, whatever.

561
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:29,200
But then, so I would kind of like, you know,

562
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,040
sometimes I would open up and then I would like,

563
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,560
hey, we don't gotta put it out today.

564
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:37,360
So I like, you know, leave it, leave the signs in the inside

565
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,440
and no one would, so nobody see them.

566
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,080
And it would be like, cool, normal day or whatever.

567
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:45,400
And then I guess I didn't realize that the other managers

568
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,840
were also doing that.

569
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,040
So then I was like, so that means it's basically

570
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,040
was not out.

571
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:53,920
And I really, so Kyle was coming around and he's like,

572
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:57,160
I think he just happened to walk by when I hadn't done it.

573
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:00,080
And he, I think he had been just off his rocker

574
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,800
cause he just, no one's been doing it.

575
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,320
And he just went off on me.

576
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,640
And I was like, it was in front of everybody.

577
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,760
And I think I like cried in front of him.

578
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,680
Like I like cried.

579
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,600
I was like, cause I was like, it was like,

580
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,000
I felt so overwhelmed.

581
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,640
It's like, I don't know what to do.

582
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:16,040
Cause I don't want to get fired,

583
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:19,280
but I don't want to do this thing that you guys make me do.

584
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:23,280
And then, but anyway, it was, we ended up,

585
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,280
I think they ended up, it didn't really work.

586
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,400
Cause I'm sure it's still there.

587
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,560
I haven't been over there, but is the other one still there?

588
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,000
It is. Yeah.

589
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,440
I didn't think it predated, madam.

590
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,160
She says, or at least a version of it.

591
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,680
Cause I went to like, I remember going as a kid,

592
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:38,120
going to one over there, at least in the same,

593
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:40,840
maybe the business or the ownership changed at some point.

594
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:45,240
And I liked it a lot cause it had like stuff I liked,

595
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,640
like Back to the Future and the Ninja Turtles

596
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:50,560
and a really miserable Home Alone.

597
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:54,040
Like all three of the Home Alones were so cruddy.

598
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:56,880
I think when, if you remember the Conan Tonight Show

599
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,400
when they were firing wax figures out of cannons and stuff,

600
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,520
I think those were all bought in a giant lot

601
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,440
from that wax museum.

602
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,720
They were like unbelievably shitty.

603
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:09,120
Like there was a really crazy looking Tom Cruise,

604
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,960
even shorter than he is, really horrible hair.

605
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,880
To me it's kinda cooler cause they're like shitty

606
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:16,000
in a more kitschy way where it's like,

607
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,040
like it's kinda novelty.

608
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:20,960
But like Mount Desauce does feel a little more like clean.

609
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,200
Like it's like, you know, don't, don't fuck these up.

610
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,120
You know? Yeah.

611
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,520
No, they're good. They're really good.

612
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,960
And then like, so you're, so there's,

613
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:32,240
in Hollywood you had this confusion about,

614
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,160
like people are saying the other one was Madame Tussauds.

615
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,960
I, I, there was a thing I didn't clear up with myself

616
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,760
until we were gonna talk about this,

617
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,200
which is I remember going to Niagara Falls

618
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,720
and there was a, and in my head the whole time

619
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,520
it's been like, oh yeah, I went to Madame Tussauds

620
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,720
in Niagara Falls.

621
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,680
And then I looked it up and wait, but it wasn't though.

622
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,160
Cause those were so cruddy.

623
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,480
So that's a whole, you want some more?

624
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,280
You know about it. You obviously know about this.

625
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

626
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:55,960
You know I'm down with this.

627
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:58,120
There's a whole nother fucking crazy drama.

628
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:00,080
Cause there's. Cause it's the name.

629
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:00,920
It's Louis Tussauds.

630
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:05,280
So it's like Madame's like step brother or something.

631
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,120
It's like crazy.

632
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,840
It's a great grandson.

633
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,680
Yeah. Louis Tussauds.

634
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,520
Yeah. Wow.

635
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,520
He's like not affiliated.

636
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,360
Like he just went off, took the name

637
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,960
and did his own fucking thing.

638
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,000
He's like, fuck y'all, I'm making my own museum.

639
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:17,840
I'm waxing.

640
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,480
Even though like you think that you, you hear this

641
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,920
and you're like, well, this is some like scumbag

642
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,360
who did this in the eighties, but no,

643
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,520
this is like 1800s still.

644
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:28,000
This was like forever ago.

645
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,080
He had the scheme to like open a bad one.

646
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,840
Cause there's one in London that people have

647
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,680
been making fun of for centuries.

648
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:35,520
Right.

649
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:39,240
So he's been like the, you know, the bad stepchild

650
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,120
for like over a hundred years.

651
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:41,960
Gallagher II.

652
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,680
Yeah, yeah, the ultimate Gallagher II.

653
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,680
I would love to check it out.

654
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,720
Yeah, but I remember hearing about that

655
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,520
and it's just like, he's like,

656
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,840
you don't bring his name up.

657
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,440
It's like, it's like, you don't talk about him.

658
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,080
Yeah, it's really serious.

659
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,680
It's like lawsuits, like tons of shit.

660
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:59,920
Like it's like crazy, like fully like a real family

661
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:00,760
like issue.

662
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,240
This is a real family we're talking about.

663
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,680
Yeah, yeah, right.

664
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:08,000
Yeah, the Tussauds and it goes, like we're saying,

665
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,600
it goes back a while.

666
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,800
Like it goes back to the 1800s.

667
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:14,720
Like Madame Tussaud herself was locked up

668
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,200
during the French Revolution.

669
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,440
Tordered wax figures around England and Ireland

670
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,400
and then could not go back to France

671
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,840
because the Napoleonic Wars were happening

672
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:30,000
and kind of like ended up setting up a museum in London

673
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,680
on Baker Street for a while.

674
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:34,720
It's moved since, but it was on Baker Street,

675
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,720
which you know, the street, the fictional address

676
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,600
of Sherlock Holmes is on Baker Street too.

677
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,800
But like Madame Tussauds in London was damaged

678
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:46,520
during World War II by German bombs.

679
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,840
Yeah, this shit goes back.

680
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,240
It's like a legacy, but she's like a little dope

681
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,480
like fucking entrepreneur.

682
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,680
She was just taking the wax figures in the ship

683
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,640
and just hitting people up with them.

684
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,680
And like that.

685
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:57,520
Oh, like touring it?

686
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,360
Yeah, yeah.

687
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,360
Like before that, imagine touring anything

688
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:02,040
in the early 1800s.

689
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,200
How the hell do you do that?

690
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,200
Yeah, it's like no healthcare.

691
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,400
I don't know what the fuck's going on.

692
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,240
Yeah.

693
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,360
But yeah, no, but that whole,

694
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:13,000
that whole Boulevard is just like a crazy situation.

695
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,280
Like I always just, I can't disassociate working there

696
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:19,880
with just working on Hollywood Boulevard as a concept

697
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:23,840
because it's just like that, like I'll tell you a story.

698
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,400
I got two, I got a lot of stories

699
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,240
if y'all wanna hear all this shit.

700
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,080
Of course.

701
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:31,280
Like the, so, okay, so that whole Boulevard

702
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,200
is like kind of like the mafia a little bit

703
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,280
where it's like, okay, like you have this Starline tour guys

704
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:38,880
and you have all these other kinds of random tour people

705
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,920
who kind of be on these blocks on the Boulevard.

706
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:44,560
So like that shit is like negotiated,

707
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:47,320
like where people are, where they stand on that.

708
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:50,040
So with Bouncy Souls is coming in, big European,

709
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,920
like huge company.

710
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,040
They're like, what the fuck is this?

711
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:55,360
Basically like have no regard for the rule,

712
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:58,280
what the setup or like the way everybody had kind of like

713
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,280
decided this is how we're gonna do it.

714
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:02,680
So we're like, so basically we have,

715
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:05,040
we had this thing called a street team

716
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:08,200
and it was, this was like when they got real rough for me,

717
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,800
I was real like, you know, losing my hair and shit.

718
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:13,720
But I, so I was doing, cause inside is great.

719
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,880
When you work, I was managing the photo people,

720
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:18,640
we take pictures, we sell photos, it's all good.

721
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,760
Nobody fucks with you, it was air conditioned.

722
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,320
It was just a beautiful time.

723
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:25,400
But then I was doing so well, my boss was like,

724
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:29,120
hey, so we got a new thing we're doing on the street

725
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:33,480
outside on a Boulevard and it's just a mess right now.

726
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,920
And we need you to kind of go in and like clean it up.

727
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:36,760
Right?

728
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,280
Like felt like, I felt like Joe Clark can lean on me.

729
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,920
It was like, I had to like go in and like fix the thing.

730
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:43,080
So then I'm like, all right, whatever.

731
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:47,360
So it's like, you go into Boulevard,

732
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,920
basically we have this street team

733
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:52,400
that's basically hired on from like people

734
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,520
who didn't work for the company,

735
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:57,400
but they were like passing out flyers and shit.

736
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:00,360
So we got rid of that, we had to start over

737
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:03,600
and basically from talking to him,

738
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,000
what I've already heard was that the rappers

739
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,420
who sell the CDs, that other fucking tour guys

740
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:11,720
are just really bad people.

741
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:12,920
They're like massaging us,

742
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:15,120
they're like fucking harassing the employees.

743
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,440
They're just like crazy, right?

744
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:20,160
So I was like, okay, my employees don't wanna deal

745
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:22,760
with this shit and I gotta like come out,

746
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:26,820
figure out a way for them to like be able to be out there

747
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:29,480
passing flyers without it being like a nightmare at work.

748
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,320
Right?

749
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,400
So then, so I had this whole thing, right?

750
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,640
It was so funny, cause I was like,

751
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,000
who the fuck do I think I am, right?

752
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,400
So I come out, cause I used to be a rapper,

753
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,620
so I'm like, maybe I can relate to these dudes or whatever.

754
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:42,500
So I'm like, okay, I had this big meeting,

755
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:46,300
I go out, I go down to all the rappers on the block, right?

756
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:47,900
Who's selling their CDs, I say,

757
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:52,900
hey look, I'm the new street manager with a street team.

758
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:55,780
You know, I know how it is, I know the struggle,

759
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:56,620
you know what I'm saying?

760
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:59,100
I'm like you man, like trying to act like, you know,

761
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:01,260
I can relate to you man, I come from the block too,

762
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:03,820
you know, trying to get my music going, I totally get it.

763
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:06,620
I know I work for a company that has Madame in the title,

764
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:07,540
but still.

765
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:08,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

766
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:11,980
It's a mad damn, but you know what I'm saying?

767
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:15,020
Like it's cool, like so then she goes, so then,

768
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:20,060
so I go, I basically like, look, y'all have,

769
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:23,400
cause what I didn't want is for them to fuck around,

770
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,780
like basically, you know, cause you know,

771
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:28,180
what happens is, like an example of what the issue was,

772
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:31,400
is like, let's say one of my employees goes into their space

773
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,900
where they're selling the CDs to pass out flyers,

774
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:36,220
they basically will be like, get the fuck out of here, right?

775
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:39,180
So it's like, I was trying to avoid that kind of situation.

776
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:42,500
So I'm like, okay, so let's agree to have,

777
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:44,340
we're gonna be over here, we're not gonna mess

778
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:47,140
with y'all space or where y'all do y'all CD stuff,

779
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:50,740
and if there's any problems, like don't say nothing

780
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:53,740
to the employees, just come to me, like you come,

781
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:55,540
my name's Lamar, you come directly to me

782
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:56,940
and we'll deal with it, right?

783
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:58,580
And it was like a whole, I'm like,

784
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:01,300
this is a whole new regime, it's a new day at Mounders Sells,

785
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:03,420
right, I'm here now, right?

786
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:06,580
Used to call me Crazy Joe, now they call me Batman.

787
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:10,900
So then, so for a while it was working,

788
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:15,300
like peaceful, everybody was like, chill, no problems.

789
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:18,540
So then we hired a bunch of new people,

790
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:23,540
and like I told them, like a new people for the street team

791
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:24,980
and I had this meeting with them,

792
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:27,340
I told them how to set up, you go on the blog,

793
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:29,300
you pass your flyers, you see the rappers,

794
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:31,060
you don't fuck with them, don't talk to them,

795
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,740
don't do nothing, right?

796
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:36,740
Of course, day two, right after I hire,

797
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:40,380
I walk outside, I got my walkie on or whatever,

798
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:42,460
it's a busy day too, hot in the summer,

799
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:45,300
line is way out the door, Shrek is melting, it's crazy.

800
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:50,300
So I'm like, I get a call, someone says on the radio,

801
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:54,820
Lamar, can you come down here, the entire rap,

802
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:56,580
all the rappers on the Boulevard are outside

803
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:58,020
the box office, right?

804
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:59,780
I'm like, what the fuck?

805
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:01,860
So then I go down, and it's all of them,

806
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,460
like a gang right in front of me,

807
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:05,340
and meanwhile, the line is long as hell, right?

808
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:07,220
So I'm already kinda overwhelmed,

809
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:10,100
and then they're like, I go, what's the problem?

810
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:12,220
Because I did say come talk to me, right?

811
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:13,860
So they say, hey, you said come to you.

812
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:17,260
So they said, one of my employees walks up to them,

813
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:19,060
basically getting off the train,

814
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:21,420
one of my employees was on his way to work,

815
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:24,740
and just says some kind of snide comment to one of them,

816
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:28,540
basically to the effect of these guys are crooks,

817
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:30,300
don't buy their CD, basically.

818
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:33,540
So he kinda sat down under his breath, and kept going,

819
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:37,500
so they're like, we wanna talk to him,

820
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:40,340
and I'm like, well, hold on, I can't just feed him to y'all.

821
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:42,100
I'm gonna feed his ass.

822
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:45,380
So I'm like, so then I go, okay,

823
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:48,580
it's like I'm telling this, and I'm like,

824
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:50,180
how is this a real thing, right?

825
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:54,500
So I go up to the break room, right,

826
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:56,780
and I see him in there, and I go,

827
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:58,900
I don't wanna say his name, but I'll just say,

828
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:01,500
we'll just call him Jimmy, right?

829
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:04,700
Okay, so Jimmy was in the break room,

830
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:08,700
and in a banana or something,

831
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,300
he looked like he had no clue, right?

832
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:13,220
So I go, hey man, did you say something to those guys?

833
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:14,580
Because I had just hired this guy, right?

834
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:16,380
So I'm trying to figure out what happened,

835
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:19,020
and he's like, oh yeah, those guys are assholes, man,

836
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:20,340
fuck those guys, right?

837
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:22,740
And I was like, oh, they all downstairs right now,

838
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:24,100
and his face just dropped.

839
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:25,740
He was like, what?

840
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:27,540
He looked so scared.

841
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:30,060
He should be, these guys are not rappers,

842
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:31,260
they are criminals.

843
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:36,260
So then I go, so then I'm like, okay, don't worry,

844
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:37,780
I'm not gonna let nothing happen to you,

845
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:39,460
we're gonna take care of this, right?

846
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:43,260
So meanwhile, the line is getting crazy.

847
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:45,020
I'm getting calls out the ass,

848
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:46,460
coming down here, we need to refund all this shit,

849
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:48,020
and I'm like the only manager, I'm like,

850
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:49,900
I don't know, I'm losing my mind.

851
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:54,300
So then I get down there, and I go,

852
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:55,940
I say, stay here in the break room, I'll be right back.

853
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:57,740
I go down to the rappers, and I say,

854
00:31:57,740 --> 00:32:01,220
okay, he says he's sorry, I think it was just

855
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:04,140
an honest mistake, let's just let bygones be bygones,

856
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:05,380
and he's like, no, they were like,

857
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:08,060
no, we wanna hear it from him, we want him to say it.

858
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:10,300
And I was like, well, I can't do that,

859
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:12,580
because if y'all do something to him,

860
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:14,340
we gonna have to call the cops, right?

861
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:16,900
So they were like, no, we ain't gonna touch him,

862
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:18,300
we ain't gonna do nothing, we promise.

863
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:20,020
I'm like, all right, give me your word,

864
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:23,580
y'all ain't gonna put your hands on him, or whatever,

865
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:25,660
and then we'll squash this shit.

866
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:27,780
Meanwhile, the line is getting crazy.

867
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:30,780
I'm losing my mind, they're calling me like crazy,

868
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:32,380
I gotta refund over here.

869
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:35,820
So then I go back up, I say, hey man,

870
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:38,340
okay, here's what we gonna do, we gonna go down there,

871
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:39,860
don't worry, I ain't gonna let nothing happen to you,

872
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:42,100
I promise, but we just apologize to them,

873
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:43,740
and we'll be done with it.

874
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:47,580
And then, there we go, so he's like,

875
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:49,780
all right, man, I felt so bad,

876
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:51,020
he's putting so much trust in me,

877
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:53,820
because I got no idea what was about to happen, right?

878
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:56,020
I'm like, kill this motherfucker, right?

879
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:59,820
So then I come down, and then,

880
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:03,100
they immediately, of course, immediately break their promise,

881
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:04,780
and they're like, ready to fucking squash.

882
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:07,460
I jumped in, I'm like, go off, I'm like,

883
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:09,260
you guys said y'all wasn't gonna do nothing.

884
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:11,460
I told y'all, I told y'all what would happen

885
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:12,340
if y'all do that, right?

886
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:13,660
So I'm just yelling at them,

887
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:15,460
and I was like, I thought y'all was a man of your word,

888
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:17,300
I'm like lecturing them and shit,

889
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:19,300
and then the line is watching it,

890
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:21,420
I got this whole audience, it's like crazy.

891
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:24,140
And then, I swear to God, I'm not making this up,

892
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:26,700
because it's gonna sound, it makes me look really cool,

893
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:29,980
but they all just left, and they're like,

894
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:32,740
all right, I don't know what came over me,

895
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:35,660
but I felt like after that, I was like,

896
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:38,980
yo, y'all owe me, I'm killing it, I'm out too,

897
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:41,740
so I just saved that dude's life,

898
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:45,780
man, he almost fucking got killed by his street rapper.

899
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:48,180
But yeah, and it was almost like a mutual respect thing,

900
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:50,100
it was like, all right, man, we got you.

901
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:52,220
So then ever since then, after that,

902
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:53,620
everything went back to normal,

903
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:55,620
but it was just like, that's the kind of shit

904
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:58,380
that was just like a daily type of shit,

905
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:00,740
like shit like that, just working in that area,

906
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:02,700
like just bomb threats, it's like crazy.

907
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,420
We had one time, sorry, I got all the,

908
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:05,260
I mean you guys had to question that.

909
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:08,020
There's another one, it was like, we had a full ride,

910
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:09,820
I mean, I don't know if y'all remember this,

911
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:13,420
it was a DJ, he was a really famous DJ,

912
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:18,220
I think he died actually, but I can't remember,

913
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:20,700
but one of those DJs that was super popular,

914
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:24,540
and he did a pop-up concert on the boulevard,

915
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:26,060
like on Twitter or whatever, he said,

916
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:27,500
we're just gonna show up,

917
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,380
and then it turned into this whole riot,

918
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:32,380
and we had to basically close the museum down

919
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:34,460
and bring all the wax figures in,

920
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:35,980
because they were about to tear them apart,

921
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:36,820
it was crazy.

922
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:37,660
It was water, it was outside.

923
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:38,820
The ones outside to get people in,

924
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:40,660
you had to drag in Lucy or whatever.

925
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:41,660
You had to drag them all in and shut the door,

926
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:43,060
it was like, they were this close.

927
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:46,980
Like if they would have got in the fucking museum,

928
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:49,620
oh man, those men, oh man,

929
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:51,740
Morgan Freeman, Justin Timberlake,

930
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:53,660
they would have been destroyed,

931
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:54,500
they would have been crazy.

932
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:55,460
They would have taken the elevator up

933
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:57,380
and made their way down destroyed.

934
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:59,540
Yeah, yeah, up to the third floor.

935
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:01,340
The third floor, work your way down.

936
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:03,820
Using Marlene Dietrich as a battering ringer.

937
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:06,100
Right, right, right, they got the Betty Davis thing

938
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:07,860
with her hands out, with the like,

939
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:09,140
I love what close-up is in the man,

940
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:10,860
it's a slice of corn, everything like,

941
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:12,660
shh, shh, shh.

942
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:16,300
Driving Travolta's car out the door.

943
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:18,740
They got grease lightning.

944
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:21,340
Yeah, man.

945
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:22,820
It's like Game of Thrones,

946
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:25,460
like it's like the different houses on block

947
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:28,980
and like you're in charge of one and you have the power.

948
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:31,900
As you say that, I am thinking back to being down there

949
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:35,020
like yesterday and then other times before.

950
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:37,820
I'm like, oh yeah, when I was,

951
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:39,860
when someone was asking me if I wanted to buy a CD,

952
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:42,900
no one was simultaneously asking if I wanted to take a tour

953
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:45,420
and when I was buying a hot dog, no one bothered me.

954
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:47,500
Like everyone had their own zone.

955
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:48,340
Yeah, it's completely sectioned off.

956
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:49,180
They know not to bother you

957
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:50,020
when you're trying to buy a hot dog.

958
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:52,860
Well, there's a certain hungry aura.

959
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:54,180
I got that blade on me.

960
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:56,180
I got you a slice of pie in the block.

961
00:35:56,180 --> 00:36:01,180
But yeah, man, oh yeah, but it's all illegal, right?

962
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:03,540
So it's like not even rooted in any sort of law,

963
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:05,020
it's just like they've decided

964
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:06,780
that this is where we're gonna stand

965
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:08,740
and sell these things even though

966
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:10,780
they have no permission to be out there.

967
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:12,700
Do you have characters out there,

968
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:13,540
like the costume characters?

969
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:14,940
Yeah, they're out there.

970
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:16,380
They're crazy too.

971
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:18,740
They're just all insane.

972
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:22,460
I think now I kind of have a soft heart for them.

973
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:24,220
Now they're reflecting back,

974
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:27,220
but they were definitely just all usually on drugs.

975
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:30,420
It was just weird because you see these guys

976
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:31,740
dressed up like Spider-Man or whatever

977
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:33,540
and hugging kids and you're like,

978
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:36,380
then I see him later behind the building

979
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:38,420
when I get up with his mask off,

980
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:39,900
smoking, cracking behind the thing.

981
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:41,780
You're like, oh weird, that's weird

982
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:43,300
that he was hugging these kids earlier.

983
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:46,220
Yeah, no, it's a wild world.

984
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:48,180
Yeah, it is like a game.

985
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:49,460
It's like its own universe.

986
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:51,820
Yeah, it's very disturbing.

987
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:55,820
Power structures and truces in play

988
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:58,340
and then if somebody breaks the rules,

989
00:36:58,340 --> 00:37:01,660
then the whole power is changed,

990
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:03,020
the whole structure moves.

991
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:04,980
Yeah, and there's big collect,

992
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:06,740
what do you call it, when the Lannisters

993
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:10,300
and they work together.

994
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:11,140
We have- Yes.

995
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:12,820
Alliance. Alliance.

996
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:17,340
The biggest one, I think Madden-Tissot's smartly was like,

997
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:19,020
we're not winning this on our own

998
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:21,180
and they lined up with Starline,

999
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:23,140
which was the tour company,

1000
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:25,260
and then you started seeing the Starline buses

1001
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:27,420
with the Madden-Tissot banner on it.

1002
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:31,340
Once we did that, we had basic control of the whole block.

1003
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:33,300
It was literally like the West Coast.

1004
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:36,860
We were like, oh, now we have this side of the block

1005
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:38,300
and now because of Starline,

1006
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:40,380
we have pretty much the entire Hollywood,

1007
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:41,500
the East side of Hollywood,

1008
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:44,460
which is like, no one can fuck with us at that point.

1009
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:46,220
Starline's like the fucking,

1010
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:48,140
they're rooted deep in Hollywood,

1011
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:49,540
you don't fuck with them.

1012
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:53,540
There's little tour companies that they must muscle out

1013
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:56,340
and try to push- Yeah, the little small ones,

1014
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:57,820
they gotta get their permit.

1015
00:37:57,820 --> 00:37:59,540
We gotta go to them to make sure it's okay

1016
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:02,580
that we sell our tours here.

1017
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:03,900
It's like risk or something,

1018
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:05,580
like if you can get Madden-Tissot

1019
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:08,900
and then you can get the Hooters across the street,

1020
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:12,220
then you can kind of form your own country there

1021
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:14,500
and then that's a fortified wall.

1022
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:15,700
We took the Baja fresh.

1023
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:17,860
Yeah, yeah, we got the Baja fresh.

1024
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:19,980
Yeah, yeah, Baja fresh.

1025
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:20,820
Raise a flag.

1026
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:22,140
Yeah, raise a flag.

1027
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:23,620
Raise a flag.

1028
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:26,020
And then Merlin has to manage this

1029
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:28,940
in all the major cities of the world

1030
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:31,940
because this microcosm is going on in,

1031
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:35,300
yeah, not just in America and New York and Vegas and stuff,

1032
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:38,700
but in Istanbul and Shanghai

1033
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:43,420
and Australia and I'm sure they all have their own little

1034
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:46,820
unwritten rules and tourism districts and stuff.

1035
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:49,380
I can't even imagine, yeah, especially out overseas.

1036
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:51,660
Even New York, yeah, or Vegas too.

1037
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:54,540
Vegas is like a legit, that's like a real-

1038
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:57,380
That was the first one in America in the Venetian.

1039
00:38:57,380 --> 00:38:58,580
Oh really, I didn't know that.

1040
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:01,660
Oh wow, yeah, that one's really cool.

1041
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:04,580
I like how they all have an area that's specific

1042
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:05,940
to where they are where it's like,

1043
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:07,740
we have old Hollywood

1044
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:10,980
and then they have the Rat Pack and all that.

1045
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:12,140
It's very cool.

1046
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:12,980
Oh, gotcha.

1047
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:14,540
There's a lot of different, oh, okay.

1048
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:17,420
Oh, I was gonna say, my girlfriend lived in Orlando

1049
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:19,420
for a long time and she said when you go to the Orlando one,

1050
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:22,700
the very first wax figure you would see

1051
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:24,380
would be Ponce de Leon.

1052
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:25,220
What?

1053
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:26,500
Yeah.

1054
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:30,540
Because it's Florida, it's like the Florida history.

1055
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:31,700
Oh, okay.

1056
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:32,900
That's so funny.

1057
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:35,260
What it was, the most specific historical I figure,

1058
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:38,140
I found at the Istanbul location,

1059
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:42,100
the Ottoman Sultan Mehmed the Conqueror,

1060
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:45,900
the one who conquered Constantinople, making it Istanbul.

1061
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:46,740
Wow.

1062
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:47,580
It was a wax figure.

1063
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:48,420
It is town.

1064
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:49,260
He has one there, wow.

1065
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:50,100
Yeah.

1066
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:53,220
Man, they really be going, how did it, yeah, like that shit,

1067
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:55,260
they really like secretly are just like,

1068
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:58,100
kinda like locked in, like they might be able to say

1069
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:00,940
global warming or something, like the way they are positioned,

1070
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,620
like they're just positioned all over the world

1071
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:05,820
and they seem like they, at least making a,

1072
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:08,460
wherever they go, making some kind of connection to the,

1073
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:10,260
or the place that they are.

1074
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:14,100
The DC one is like, has a lot of really cool ones too.

1075
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:19,100
But yeah, that shit, it's like crazy how they actually,

1076
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:23,180
like, you know, they get by it, like I always thought

1077
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:25,260
like wax figure is sort of lame

1078
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:27,460
before I started working there, but it is like,

1079
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:30,020
there's like a art to it, like some kind of craft to it

1080
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:32,300
and it like, even I'll never forget my first day,

1081
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:36,940
like Nicole Kidman like fell, like a kid pushed her

1082
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:40,100
and like her head shattered everywhere.

1083
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:40,940
Whoa.

1084
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:41,780
It was like nightmare.

1085
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:43,860
It was such, I can't get that image out of my head.

1086
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:44,700
It's the hate.

1087
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:46,660
I was like, oh my God, Nicole Kidman.

1088
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:49,180
I was like, but yeah, it was, it's like,

1089
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:51,620
this thing's expensive, yo, this shit's crazy.

1090
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:52,460
Yeah.

1091
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:54,460
Yeah, I was gonna ask like the situation

1092
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:56,100
with damage in general, that's crazy to have

1093
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:58,340
in the first day, was it a pre-winter?

1094
00:40:58,340 --> 00:40:59,180
I started, yeah.

1095
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:01,100
Oh, when you started, yeah, yeah.

1096
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:03,020
Does that happen a lot though, where there people

1097
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:03,940
gang up? It does, yeah.

1098
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:05,180
Like they get damaged a lot

1099
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:08,100
cause people are pretty like aggressive with them,

1100
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:10,500
but we have like, it's funny, you know,

1101
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,860
another crazy thing is, so we have this thing

1102
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:15,500
where we have to take them off if they get damaged

1103
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:18,220
cause we don't want them to look bad on the floor

1104
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:21,260
and, but they have this interesting rule

1105
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:24,140
where you're not allowed to move the figures

1106
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:27,300
without them being covered and it's like,

1107
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:30,100
it's like some psycho, human psychological thing

1108
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:32,740
where like they like, we're not allowed to like

1109
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:36,220
show moving bodies like that, like it's like a weird.

1110
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:37,740
Like a corpse. Yeah, yeah.

1111
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:39,540
We put it in the, you cover it before you put it

1112
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:40,660
in the ambulance. Yeah, like this,

1113
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:42,340
especially if disbelief or something like,

1114
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:44,540
so we have to like put a sleeping bag over them

1115
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:46,260
and like take, so that would happen all the time,

1116
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:48,540
like, oh, like some kid would like scratch

1117
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:50,220
just a tip of like in the face

1118
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:53,100
and then we have to like take him off and like, we like,

1119
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:54,980
it's like a secret mission, we're like, do it,

1120
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:56,220
we like block it off. It's like a kidnapping.

1121
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:57,060
Yeah, it feels like that.

1122
00:41:57,060 --> 00:42:00,460
It feels like, yeah, it's so, it's so interesting,

1123
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:01,300
but that happens a lot.

1124
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:03,580
I mean, the full head shattering is like rare.

1125
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:04,860
I mean, that doesn't happen all the time

1126
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:06,180
because they're like, they're pretty pegged in.

1127
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:08,140
I was surprised like first, whoever got them off.

1128
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:08,980
Was that what it is?

1129
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:09,820
Because they have to be light enough

1130
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:13,100
to be moved in theory, but then they can't be,

1131
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:14,420
they gotta be locked down for.

1132
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:16,700
Yeah, it's really the head is all the thing

1133
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:19,020
that's the only one that's really actually valuable.

1134
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:20,980
Like the body is just a mannequin.

1135
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:22,300
Like it's basically a mannequin.

1136
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:24,340
It's like you say, you're pretty, it's pretty light.

1137
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:26,180
You could like, you could definitely do a heist

1138
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:30,860
and like get a couple out of there, but yeah, not that.

1139
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:34,340
Cause they'll reuse that, like if somebody is retired,

1140
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:37,780
like for instance, evidently New York had a Matt Lauer

1141
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:39,620
and then obviously they don't want to keep having

1142
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:40,620
a Matt Lauer. Sure.

1143
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:43,100
So you can just take those hands off, take that head off

1144
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:44,540
and then like that can be somebody else.

1145
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:45,380
Exactly.

1146
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:46,500
So they're really upsized.

1147
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:50,460
They discovered a few years ago, the Beatles wax heads

1148
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:52,860
that were the ones that were photographed

1149
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:54,820
for the cover of Sergeant Pepper's.

1150
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:55,660
Oh yeah.

1151
00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:58,900
And those heads were like just in a storage

1152
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:01,540
at Madame Tussauds in London for a long time.

1153
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:04,900
And they were auctioned off for over $80,000.

1154
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:06,740
Wow. Like $81,000.

1155
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:07,580
That seems low to me.

1156
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:08,980
That seems low to me, yeah.

1157
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:10,900
The Beatles heads from Sergeant Pepper's on the cover?

1158
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:12,900
You're clogging like a 20,000 a head.

1159
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:15,780
Yeah, the ones from the, I think maybe Paul's was a replica.

1160
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:16,980
Half a million at least.

1161
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:17,820
Yeah, I know.

1162
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:19,980
For the Beatles heads from Sergeant Pepper's.

1163
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:22,100
Yeah, the ones that are like just over their shoulder.

1164
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:24,260
The ones that are like the mop top ones.

1165
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:25,100
Oh, right.

1166
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:25,920
Yeah.

1167
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:26,760
That's crazy.

1168
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:27,600
Yeah.

1169
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:30,900
The craziest one I looked up in terms of like

1170
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:34,260
people fucking up figures was that there was a Berlin,

1171
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:37,940
when the Berlin Madame Tussauds opened,

1172
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:40,060
on the first day that it opened,

1173
00:43:40,060 --> 00:43:44,060
the second guy in the door made a beeline

1174
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:47,740
for the history room where there was a Hitler.

1175
00:43:47,740 --> 00:43:51,220
And he started yelling stuff about no more war

1176
00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:54,500
and then just charged at Hitler and yanked the head off.

1177
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:56,540
So this was like the first morning.

1178
00:43:56,540 --> 00:43:57,380
They had a Hitler.

1179
00:43:57,380 --> 00:43:59,700
A lot of them have, I don't know if Madame Tussauds does,

1180
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:01,700
but I've seen multiple Hitlers for sure.

1181
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:03,620
I saw Hitler on one of the videos.

1182
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:05,380
There's a few Hitlers floating around.

1183
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:07,620
The London one was in the Hall of Horrors,

1184
00:44:07,620 --> 00:44:08,460
I believe it was called.

1185
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:11,820
Oh yeah, sometimes they go up in like, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1186
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:12,660
With like monsters and stuff.

1187
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:15,340
Yeah, with fun monsters like Frankenstein and Dracula

1188
00:44:15,340 --> 00:44:17,780
and Hitler, that fun gangster.

1189
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:18,620
Well, I was looking.

1190
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:21,500
Hong Kong just has a Hitler still floating around

1191
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:22,820
in the historical section, it seems like.

1192
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:23,940
Okay, okay, yeah.

1193
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:28,940
The one I went to, the Louis Tussauds in Niagara Falls.

1194
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:29,980
Don't talk his name.

1195
00:44:29,980 --> 00:44:32,860
I'm sorry, yeah, I'll make sure it's the last time I say it.

1196
00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:36,100
But they had like a house of horror and I had a video

1197
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:38,580
and I don't, if I, I might bring this up again,

1198
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:40,940
I was like wasted for sure in that one

1199
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:42,900
because Niagara Falls, I don't know how you get through

1200
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:44,740
Niagara Falls without being drunk as hell.

1201
00:44:44,740 --> 00:44:47,740
It is like such a bizarre, stressful, unpleasant place.

1202
00:44:47,860 --> 00:44:50,740
And they leave it open late and I think the idea is like,

1203
00:44:50,740 --> 00:44:52,860
this is the wax museum that's a little shittier

1204
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:54,340
and you run around and you're drunk at it.

1205
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:57,180
And that one had a bunch of video of a house of horrors

1206
00:44:57,180 --> 00:45:00,260
where like it goes from a crypt keeper that's talking

1207
00:45:00,260 --> 00:45:04,020
past some guy I didn't recognize over to Saddam Hussein.

1208
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:04,860
What?

1209
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:07,700
And I had to zoom into the name tag to be able to tell

1210
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:09,660
who it was because he honestly kind of looked like

1211
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:11,620
Alec Baldwin with a mustache.

1212
00:45:11,620 --> 00:45:13,380
He might have been a reused Alec Baldwin.

1213
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:14,940
Yeah, it was an old Alec Baldwin.

1214
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:16,780
I think maybe, yeah, yeah.

1215
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:18,740
That's hilarious.

1216
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:21,660
But like, but that one in general, and I've seen,

1217
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:25,100
I saw this complaint on different Yelps that they would put,

1218
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:29,100
everybody has a name tag because it is a little iffy

1219
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:30,020
who everybody is.

1220
00:45:30,020 --> 00:45:33,260
Like I saw the full name Beyonce Knowles.

1221
00:45:33,260 --> 00:45:35,740
You know how everybody says her last name all the time

1222
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:37,300
because Beyonce is not famous enough?

1223
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:38,820
But I think maybe they did have to do the full,

1224
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:40,500
because it was questionable.

1225
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:44,140
This was truly, like the teeth were so clearly not

1226
00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:44,980
Beyonce's teeth.

1227
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:46,700
The thing was so strange.

1228
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:48,260
Like you'd be like, okay, it says Beyonce,

1229
00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:52,140
but it might be a different Beyonce that I don't know.

1230
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:54,220
Beyonce Henderson.

1231
00:45:54,220 --> 00:45:55,220
Beyonce Smith.

1232
00:45:55,220 --> 00:45:56,060
Yeah.

1233
00:45:56,060 --> 00:45:56,900
Ah, okay.

1234
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:58,020
Beyonce and the flight attendant.

1235
00:45:58,020 --> 00:46:00,740
She's just like, I'm famous.

1236
00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:03,900
Yeah, we have one that was like,

1237
00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:07,860
if the opposite too happens, not damaging,

1238
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:10,220
but people will come in, like they have like so much reverence.

1239
00:46:10,220 --> 00:46:13,180
Like Michael Jackson, we had a Michael Jackson one,

1240
00:46:13,220 --> 00:46:16,100
and every day this woman would come in there

1241
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:19,300
with flowers and stuff and just stay in there all day.

1242
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:20,140
Oh my.

1243
00:46:20,140 --> 00:46:22,500
Yeah, and just kind of be there.

1244
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:24,580
I don't know what she was doing,

1245
00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:26,540
but just she was in the room with him all day,

1246
00:46:26,540 --> 00:46:27,380
wouldn't leave.

1247
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:28,860
But she would have enough money every time,

1248
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:30,420
would buy a ticket and go in.

1249
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:33,580
But yeah, that shit, it's kind of weird.

1250
00:46:33,580 --> 00:46:34,420
I always thought it was,

1251
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:35,340
I grew up really religious,

1252
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:38,180
so I've always been interested in idolatry and stuff.

1253
00:46:38,180 --> 00:46:40,180
And it is interesting.

1254
00:46:40,220 --> 00:46:43,820
Like essentially it is like a religious experience

1255
00:46:43,820 --> 00:46:46,300
because we kind of do worship celebrities.

1256
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:49,940
So you're like, this is like a temple,

1257
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:53,140
like in a weird way to like the way our culture is.

1258
00:46:53,140 --> 00:46:58,020
Cause it's like the very fact that it exists as a thing to do

1259
00:46:58,020 --> 00:47:00,860
is like really interesting.

1260
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:03,980
I guess it makes sense like in an era where like Instagram

1261
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:07,900
and social media is so big that you can go right up to them

1262
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:09,740
and touch them and there's like props

1263
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:11,380
and they want you to put your arm around them

1264
00:47:11,380 --> 00:47:12,860
and take a picture.

1265
00:47:12,860 --> 00:47:14,780
When we first started talking about this,

1266
00:47:14,780 --> 00:47:16,220
I was like, oh, it's wax museum.

1267
00:47:16,220 --> 00:47:18,100
They're probably like a little removed,

1268
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:20,060
like a museum, like sculptures or paintings.

1269
00:47:20,060 --> 00:47:21,500
They're a little removed, set back,

1270
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:23,140
and you don't want to get too close to them.

1271
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:24,860
And then my grandma was like,

1272
00:47:24,860 --> 00:47:27,740
no, you get up and fuck around with them.

1273
00:47:27,740 --> 00:47:30,300
There's like hats you can put on at some spots

1274
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:32,220
and take a picture with them.

1275
00:47:32,220 --> 00:47:33,060
Oh yeah.

1276
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:34,100
I did not know that either.

1277
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:35,900
I didn't know about the costumes and everything,

1278
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:38,340
which I didn't, we're still pretty COVID-y

1279
00:47:38,340 --> 00:47:40,700
and now we're kind of Delta-y.

1280
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:43,740
So I didn't put any spare hats on.

1281
00:47:43,740 --> 00:47:44,820
I put the hat on.

1282
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:45,940
You did a hat.

1283
00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:47,220
Which hat?

1284
00:47:47,220 --> 00:47:48,340
The cowboy hat.

1285
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:51,140
They still got like Paul Newman over there.

1286
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:53,020
Yeah, Paul Newman, Robert Redford.

1287
00:47:53,020 --> 00:47:56,220
But you will see through the sequence of photos

1288
00:47:56,220 --> 00:48:00,780
I took yesterday of how I started to disregard COVID

1289
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:02,180
as I went through the museum

1290
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:05,300
because I was being so delighted by it.

1291
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:06,420
Yeah, it's really hard.

1292
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:08,020
You were just falling for the magic.

1293
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:11,700
I start out so like mask on this.

1294
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:14,460
At the end, I'm doing pictures with Audrey Hepburn,

1295
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:18,060
mask-less, I'm asking strangers to take my photo.

1296
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:19,860
I'm like, look, I'm only gonna be here once

1297
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:23,180
in like this part of the year probably.

1298
00:48:23,180 --> 00:48:24,580
I'm not gonna be here like a lot.

1299
00:48:24,580 --> 00:48:25,780
So I better make the most of it.

1300
00:48:25,780 --> 00:48:27,580
Unless, did it convert you?

1301
00:48:27,580 --> 00:48:29,780
You're gonna be like that Michael lady now?

1302
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:30,620
I...

1303
00:48:30,620 --> 00:48:32,780
Yeah, I think you're covered every once in a while.

1304
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:35,580
I'm bringing flowers to Ingrid Bergman tomorrow

1305
00:48:35,580 --> 00:48:37,340
if anyone wants to go with me.

1306
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:39,580
Oh man, but it would be like not dope,

1307
00:48:39,580 --> 00:48:42,300
but it's really cool when they like,

1308
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:44,300
it is when it's the anniversary of somebody's death.

1309
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:47,100
Like we do like cool shit, like where we like,

1310
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:51,460
well like I'm trying to think like, who do we do that for?

1311
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:52,660
It was someone like Ingrid,

1312
00:48:52,660 --> 00:48:55,060
like one of the old Hollywood ones

1313
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:57,540
where we just like did like this whole celebration to them.

1314
00:48:57,540 --> 00:48:59,900
And it's like, people could come in and like, yeah,

1315
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:03,180
it's really, yeah, it was a really cool museum.

1316
00:49:03,180 --> 00:49:04,260
I guess it's cool.

1317
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:07,020
Yeah, it's so, it's such a weird part of my life,

1318
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:08,860
but that shit is like cool.

1319
00:49:08,860 --> 00:49:11,540
It is like, I always felt cool giving people tickets.

1320
00:49:11,540 --> 00:49:13,900
Like I could always get people free tickets

1321
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:16,300
and that was like my one currency where I'm like,

1322
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:17,900
I can get you into Wet Madams and Sells.

1323
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:19,820
That's what I can do for you.

1324
00:49:19,820 --> 00:49:22,700
They have a, they also have like a really cool rooftop.

1325
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:24,820
If you ever want to throw a party or something,

1326
00:49:24,820 --> 00:49:28,340
you can rent it and like, they have the, like,

1327
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:30,380
they would have like Alfred Hitchcock,

1328
00:49:30,380 --> 00:49:33,220
like a lot of the parties would do like,

1329
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:35,220
kind of like scare, like a Halloween thing.

1330
00:49:35,220 --> 00:49:36,660
And you do like Alfred Hitchcock

1331
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:38,140
and have them all up there.

1332
00:49:38,140 --> 00:49:39,380
And then people are like partying or whatever.

1333
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:40,700
Should probably do a live show up there.

1334
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:41,780
Could we do a live show up there?

1335
00:49:41,780 --> 00:49:42,940
Oh, definitely.

1336
00:49:42,940 --> 00:49:44,620
I mean, it's very expensive, but.

1337
00:49:44,620 --> 00:49:45,940
All right.

1338
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:48,900
Tickets are $700.

1339
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:51,620
But yeah, you get to take a picture with Bridget Bardot.

1340
00:49:51,620 --> 00:49:52,620
Yeah.

1341
00:49:52,620 --> 00:49:53,980
Johnny Grant.

1342
00:49:53,980 --> 00:49:55,300
You'll find me by Johnny Grant,

1343
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:57,180
the honorary mayor of Hollywood.

1344
00:49:57,180 --> 00:50:00,060
I can't believe I was the first to bring up Johnny Grant.

1345
00:50:00,060 --> 00:50:01,020
That's so insane.

1346
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:02,220
Like I was so delighted.

1347
00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:05,580
I took pictures being as if my mind was being blown

1348
00:50:05,580 --> 00:50:08,660
by being in the presence of Johnny Grant.

1349
00:50:08,660 --> 00:50:10,020
Johnny Grant is the weirdest.

1350
00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:10,860
That's the weirdest one.

1351
00:50:10,860 --> 00:50:11,700
Yeah.

1352
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:12,980
Johnny Grant there when you were there?

1353
00:50:12,980 --> 00:50:13,820
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

1354
00:50:13,820 --> 00:50:16,020
He's the, cause he isn't his audio,

1355
00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:18,180
like the thing that welcomes you when you go in that room.

1356
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:20,380
He's like, welcome to Hollywood.

1357
00:50:20,380 --> 00:50:23,060
Like this is a wonderful place to be.

1358
00:50:23,060 --> 00:50:23,900
Yeah.

1359
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:24,740
I heard it.

1360
00:50:24,740 --> 00:50:25,580
Are they?

1361
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:26,700
Did I just not associate that with him?

1362
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:27,940
There was some sort of narration.

1363
00:50:27,940 --> 00:50:29,860
I don't think I was looking that closely.

1364
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:31,140
Yeah, I wasn't paying attention to it.

1365
00:50:31,140 --> 00:50:33,500
I mean, I did like, I mean, Johnny Grant was like,

1366
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:35,860
yeah, the quote unquote honorary mayor,

1367
00:50:35,860 --> 00:50:39,300
but he just sat on a lot of the boards that did like the walk of fame and the,

1368
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:40,620
that, you know, Chinese.

1369
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:42,620
He was always in those little ceremonies.

1370
00:50:42,620 --> 00:50:46,100
He's always hosting the handprints and the, and the star ceremonies.

1371
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:47,580
He's kind of like the,

1372
00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:50,940
I think like the Hollywood equivalent of like Danny Gans is in Vegas,

1373
00:50:50,940 --> 00:50:56,020
where it's like Danny Gans was no one knew Danny Gans outside of Vegas.

1374
00:50:56,020 --> 00:50:59,340
But then in Vegas, he's like one of the most famous people in the city.

1375
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:00,700
Oh yeah, that's good.

1376
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:03,260
I didn't know when I moved here, I had no idea who he was.

1377
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:07,180
But yeah, over time, I guess he's like, out of our spec.

1378
00:51:07,180 --> 00:51:08,180
Out of our deal.

1379
00:51:08,180 --> 00:51:11,540
This Mickey Rooney, this like the spirit of the city.

1380
00:51:11,540 --> 00:51:14,340
So yeah, I want to know who else is like, what figures are there now?

1381
00:51:14,340 --> 00:51:18,940
Because like last time I was there, you go up, there's the party room.

1382
00:51:18,940 --> 00:51:21,580
The party room is a real mind blow.

1383
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:23,060
The party room is wild.

1384
00:51:23,060 --> 00:51:27,060
You expect maybe to be like led in slowly.

1385
00:51:27,060 --> 00:51:28,860
Like this will build to something.

1386
00:51:28,860 --> 00:51:31,420
Like I feel like maybe even other wax museums might,

1387
00:51:31,460 --> 00:51:33,460
and I've seen them more like end with like,

1388
00:51:33,460 --> 00:51:37,780
and then here's the grand room with it's Bob Hope and Lucy and kind of the people

1389
00:51:37,780 --> 00:51:40,740
you expect. But then to get off the elevator and immediately be in the room

1390
00:51:40,740 --> 00:51:46,020
of like all current, like actually legitimately currently relevant

1391
00:51:46,380 --> 00:51:50,340
stars all in a party with a light up floor and everything.

1392
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:52,580
Yeah, it's a Beyonce, Stonksville play.

1393
00:51:52,580 --> 00:51:54,820
I think they were doing all the single ladies.

1394
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:55,740
I heard that somewhere.

1395
00:51:55,740 --> 00:51:59,420
Yeah, she got moved down to, I think you were talking the behind the scenes.

1396
00:51:59,460 --> 00:51:59,980
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1397
00:51:59,980 --> 00:52:04,260
She is a lot of videos about with her talking about sitting for.

1398
00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:06,180
Well, she's too. She has two figures.

1399
00:52:06,180 --> 00:52:07,340
Oh, she does have to.

1400
00:52:07,340 --> 00:52:08,060
Yeah, she's too.

1401
00:52:08,060 --> 00:52:10,220
She's in the music room and she's at the very end.

1402
00:52:10,220 --> 00:52:11,260
Oh, OK.

1403
00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:13,780
I think they were pushing Ariana Grande.

1404
00:52:13,780 --> 00:52:15,500
Like, oh, that's no, she wasn't there when I was.

1405
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:16,980
She had a big display.

1406
00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:19,100
Ariana Grande looks so real.

1407
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:20,700
I felt so uncomfortable.

1408
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:22,500
I'm taking a photo with these figures.

1409
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:24,580
I'm alone. Did you feel odd?

1410
00:52:24,580 --> 00:52:26,220
That one I took.

1411
00:52:26,220 --> 00:52:27,860
Yeah, that I felt letharious.

1412
00:52:27,940 --> 00:52:29,420
Taking photo like a photo with.

1413
00:52:29,420 --> 00:52:32,060
Are you like by yourself as a single guy?

1414
00:52:32,060 --> 00:52:34,820
You kind of like you're like, all right, can you take a picture of me?

1415
00:52:34,820 --> 00:52:35,980
I already had a girl.

1416
00:52:35,980 --> 00:52:38,180
Well, I did. I was not going to ask anyone to do that.

1417
00:52:38,180 --> 00:52:39,940
I felt like I was.

1418
00:52:39,940 --> 00:52:41,660
I felt like my way through the theater.

1419
00:52:41,660 --> 00:52:44,700
I did not want any like I didn't want to like, can you take a picture of me

1420
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:46,500
and Howard Hughes?

1421
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:49,140
I I took a photo.

1422
00:52:49,140 --> 00:52:50,620
I took a photo on the bike.

1423
00:52:50,620 --> 00:52:53,300
I mean, on the E.T. bike, I did take a photo.

1424
00:52:53,460 --> 00:52:55,140
I asked the younger.

1425
00:52:55,140 --> 00:52:58,580
There were some like late, like two ladies that were like following me around

1426
00:52:58,580 --> 00:53:00,300
and they were happy to take photos with me.

1427
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:01,740
They were directing me.

1428
00:53:01,740 --> 00:53:04,420
They were giving me notes and then which is fun.

1429
00:53:04,540 --> 00:53:08,220
But then for the E.T. bike, I gave some younger girl my phone

1430
00:53:08,380 --> 00:53:10,460
and she did not want to do it.

1431
00:53:10,460 --> 00:53:12,220
She clearly don't want to do it.

1432
00:53:12,220 --> 00:53:15,900
And then her dad, I guess he was with this goes like, oh, honey, where are you?

1433
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:20,140
She goes, some guy wants me to take a photo of him.

1434
00:53:20,740 --> 00:53:22,220
And I was like,

1435
00:53:22,980 --> 00:53:24,780
like this man.

1436
00:53:24,780 --> 00:53:27,300
Yeah. Did you do the wax thing?

1437
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:28,940
The hands. Did you do the wax hands?

1438
00:53:28,940 --> 00:53:32,340
Hands were closed. I was prepared to buy.

1439
00:53:33,340 --> 00:53:34,140
Yeah. Yeah.

1440
00:53:34,140 --> 00:53:35,100
Oh, yeah. Damn.

1441
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:36,820
I'm so glad I did not work there.

1442
00:53:36,820 --> 00:53:38,900
They're in code. That would have been a nightmare.

1443
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:41,180
Yeah. It's a small space.

1444
00:53:41,180 --> 00:53:43,980
Yeah. But people used to pass out all the time.

1445
00:53:44,180 --> 00:53:49,900
It was such a like I feel like I learned so much about like first aid work

1446
00:53:49,900 --> 00:53:51,140
in there, too, just because.

1447
00:53:51,260 --> 00:53:54,620
Yeah. Like I was constantly having to like save like lives.

1448
00:53:54,620 --> 00:53:58,260
Like it's like there is like so because it was so hot.

1449
00:53:58,260 --> 00:54:00,740
So the way you did a wax hand, I don't know if you have you ever done one

1450
00:54:00,740 --> 00:54:02,180
in general, like at a fair or whatever.

1451
00:54:02,380 --> 00:54:06,420
No, no. So like they basically put your hand in like ice cold water

1452
00:54:06,620 --> 00:54:09,660
for like 30 or 40 seconds or something like that.

1453
00:54:09,860 --> 00:54:11,060
And it's super cold.

1454
00:54:11,060 --> 00:54:12,020
Like it's really cold.

1455
00:54:12,020 --> 00:54:14,780
But then it numbs it and then they put it in the hot wax.

1456
00:54:14,980 --> 00:54:18,020
Right. And then it pulls it out and makes a hand that you could keep.

1457
00:54:18,220 --> 00:54:19,740
But sometimes in the summer,

1458
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:24,060
but sometimes in the summertime when they do that, they'll just pass out.

1459
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:27,380
So it would be like it would just be we had like we had to come up with a code

1460
00:54:27,580 --> 00:54:32,260
for past someone passed out and we'd have to go down and like and like give them

1461
00:54:32,260 --> 00:54:34,020
water, all this shit. And it was crazy.

1462
00:54:34,220 --> 00:54:37,700
Like, yeah. And like there were so many times where it was just like,

1463
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:41,140
like, I'd never realized that that's part of being a manager is like someone.

1464
00:54:41,140 --> 00:54:44,500
If someone gets hurt in there, you are the first person that like, right.

1465
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:45,500
Yeah. Yeah.

1466
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:48,820
So I was like, oh, yeah, I always felt like a, you know,

1467
00:54:49,060 --> 00:54:51,340
I just I feel like I became an adult working there.

1468
00:54:51,540 --> 00:54:55,500
Yeah. Oh, I have to like I have to do like this lady was like bleeding in the

1469
00:54:55,700 --> 00:54:59,260
bathroom and I like it was like literally about to close.

1470
00:54:59,260 --> 00:55:00,780
It was like just me and the janitor.

1471
00:55:00,980 --> 00:55:02,860
She's like she's the janitor.

1472
00:55:03,060 --> 00:55:07,100
She's so funny. She was like, she's like this lady, she's bleeding in there.

1473
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:09,340
And I'm like, you got to go in there.

1474
00:55:09,340 --> 00:55:11,220
I'm like, you go in there.

1475
00:55:11,420 --> 00:55:13,940
And it was just like it was like we had to call an ambulance.

1476
00:55:14,140 --> 00:55:15,700
It was like it was crazy, man.

1477
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:17,860
I was like, I like that this shit.

1478
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:21,340
And yeah, people like it's like

1479
00:55:21,540 --> 00:55:24,540
maybe just the Hollywood nature of it or just the fact that it's like a tour.

1480
00:55:24,740 --> 00:55:29,580
But it was just like every day there was something like it was always a thing.

1481
00:55:29,780 --> 00:55:33,460
But but and that's but in essence, I like really know CPR.

1482
00:55:33,460 --> 00:55:34,460
I know how to do all that shit.

1483
00:55:34,460 --> 00:55:37,660
So like if anything happens to you all, if you want to go to a theme park,

1484
00:55:37,860 --> 00:55:39,900
I'll help you out.

1485
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:42,100
They party. You got to know that should have been parts.

1486
00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:43,620
People get. Oh, yeah.

1487
00:55:43,820 --> 00:55:45,100
Yeah. Vomiting.

1488
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:46,780
Do you vomit incidents?

1489
00:55:46,940 --> 00:55:48,060
Oh, all the time. Yeah.

1490
00:55:48,260 --> 00:55:52,220
Vomiting like a lot of like a lot of summer type illness, like hot people

1491
00:55:52,420 --> 00:55:57,260
being too hot, not drinking enough water, like that kind of shit would happen a lot.

1492
00:55:57,460 --> 00:55:58,420
What else?

1493
00:55:58,620 --> 00:56:03,860
Like, you know, a lot of homeless stuff, you know, almost like just, you know,

1494
00:56:04,060 --> 00:56:07,300
they're like they'll just walk up in there and like I would have to like get them out.

1495
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:10,580
Like, yeah, it's like a weird like thing.

1496
00:56:10,580 --> 00:56:13,460
I think like the homeless people were actually became cool after a while

1497
00:56:13,660 --> 00:56:16,620
because you get to know them and stuff like I like know them.

1498
00:56:16,660 --> 00:56:20,500
Like I like like when I see them, I'm like, oh, shit, I know he used to be over there.

1499
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:22,740
It's like we're interesting to be like

1500
00:56:22,940 --> 00:56:26,260
sort of have a relationship with people who are just live on the street.

1501
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:29,100
But but yeah, man, it's a life.

1502
00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:32,580
That's the life I lived my life, you know,

1503
00:56:32,780 --> 00:56:35,260
the man of two souls story.

1504
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:37,540
But I'll tell you one more story.

1505
00:56:37,540 --> 00:56:39,020
I got I got a hell of story.

1506
00:56:39,220 --> 00:56:40,740
I haven't talked about this in so long.

1507
00:56:40,940 --> 00:56:42,540
It's crazy. I'm like, I could believe it.

1508
00:56:42,660 --> 00:56:44,780
So it was like people like, oh, they want to hear about this.

1509
00:56:44,820 --> 00:56:46,020
I'm like, I can talk about it.

1510
00:56:46,220 --> 00:56:48,900
I'll fucking say, OK, so it was so funny.

1511
00:56:49,100 --> 00:56:52,700
So so we had this one because the janitor thing reminded me of this.

1512
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:56,700
So like this guy, Byron, he was like this

1513
00:56:56,900 --> 00:57:00,220
kind of like tall black dude kind of reminds me of like Keith David,

1514
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:01,420
you know, like that kind of vibe.

1515
00:57:01,620 --> 00:57:05,180
And he like he so he was like cool as hell.

1516
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:08,100
But he he kind of was out for back surgery for a while.

1517
00:57:08,100 --> 00:57:08,460
Right.

1518
00:57:08,660 --> 00:57:12,220
Well, meanwhile, we had we had this really cool collab with Jamba Juice.

1519
00:57:12,420 --> 00:57:14,700
Right. So Jamba Juice

1520
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:18,860
would basically set up in our courtyard because we had we had that black.

1521
00:57:19,060 --> 00:57:22,580
We had that we own it up part of the property and they would basically sell or

1522
00:57:22,780 --> 00:57:25,500
give out, you know, sell Jamba Juice to the public.

1523
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:26,820
People walking on the boulevard.

1524
00:57:26,820 --> 00:57:27,100
Right.

1525
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:31,380
So as a bonus, we would if you worked that magic, so you get to get a free smoothie.

1526
00:57:31,580 --> 00:57:34,460
So we was coming in every day to work and in the smoothie.

1527
00:57:34,460 --> 00:57:37,180
Right. It was like the best because it was like they were so good.

1528
00:57:37,180 --> 00:57:39,020
It was like whatever reason that was like

1529
00:57:39,220 --> 00:57:42,500
the perfect type of treat you wanted in that moment.

1530
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:44,500
And it just like was making it was like

1531
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:46,100
the happiest I've ever seen of my employees.

1532
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:47,940
They were just like always in a good mood.

1533
00:57:48,140 --> 00:57:49,620
We did it for like three months. Right.

1534
00:57:49,820 --> 00:57:50,860
And it was so funny.

1535
00:57:51,060 --> 00:57:54,500
So it was like, you know, you know how you know, when you're at work,

1536
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:57,260
you work at a place like that, that kind of like no one really wants to be there.

1537
00:57:57,460 --> 00:57:59,700
But there's like one thing or like we do

1538
00:57:59,780 --> 00:58:02,660
Chick-fil-A on Sundays and it's just like the biggest thing in the world just

1539
00:58:02,660 --> 00:58:06,260
because it's just like makes you somewhat happier to have a life existence.

1540
00:58:06,460 --> 00:58:07,660
Everything. Yeah.

1541
00:58:07,860 --> 00:58:08,620
Look over. Yeah.

1542
00:58:08,820 --> 00:58:10,260
Like this free aspect to it.

1543
00:58:10,460 --> 00:58:12,660
So everyone's just talking about it a lot.

1544
00:58:12,700 --> 00:58:17,700
So like finally, Byron comes back with a surgery.

1545
00:58:17,900 --> 00:58:20,140
And like literally we're doing the pre.

1546
00:58:20,140 --> 00:58:22,180
So we do this meeting every morning called pre show.

1547
00:58:22,180 --> 00:58:25,380
Right. And you just kind of give everybody update.

1548
00:58:25,580 --> 00:58:26,900
And

1549
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:30,180
the guy, the manager is like that day, he's like,

1550
00:58:30,380 --> 00:58:34,180
so last day yesterday was the last day working with Jama Juice.

1551
00:58:34,380 --> 00:58:36,540
And then Byron lost his shit.

1552
00:58:36,740 --> 00:58:38,660
He was like, what is it with smoothies?

1553
00:58:38,860 --> 00:58:41,380
I told my wife I was going to bring her a smoothie.

1554
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:44,740
I told my wife I was going to bring her a smoothie.

1555
00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:47,260
Oh, no, you're all wrong for this.

1556
00:58:47,260 --> 00:58:48,940
And he was like, he was going crazy.

1557
00:58:48,940 --> 00:58:50,660
He was like walking up and down the museum.

1558
00:58:50,660 --> 00:58:52,860
Like it was like it was like a scene from Family Guy or something.

1559
00:58:53,060 --> 00:58:56,540
Because you're like walk away and they're like, I can't believe you got rid of the

1560
00:58:56,740 --> 00:59:00,820
smoothies. Like he was just so like he was like, it was like, you know,

1561
00:59:00,820 --> 00:59:03,020
you just know he had been hearing about it.

1562
00:59:03,220 --> 00:59:06,180
You know, like the other janitors, like the other janitors probably were like,

1563
00:59:06,380 --> 00:59:08,340
yo, Byron, they got these free smoothies, man.

1564
00:59:08,540 --> 00:59:09,700
That shit is dope.

1565
00:59:09,980 --> 00:59:11,100
He's like, oh, word.

1566
00:59:11,300 --> 00:59:13,500
I can't wait to get back there.

1567
00:59:13,700 --> 00:59:17,380
And it was just it was like I never see someone like a heart just break in front

1568
00:59:17,580 --> 00:59:20,940
of me. It was so funny. I'll never forget that.

1569
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:24,540
He's been sleeping on the couch for weeks because he fails to bring the.

1570
00:59:24,740 --> 00:59:27,180
Yeah, it was just like, oh, where's the fucking smoothie?

1571
00:59:27,380 --> 00:59:30,180
Byron, he told me that she was going to bring me one.

1572
00:59:30,380 --> 00:59:32,540
Provider or not.

1573
00:59:32,740 --> 00:59:34,340
Like fucking liar.

1574
00:59:34,540 --> 00:59:35,700
I'm telling you, they had him.

1575
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:37,500
I swear to God, it was a whole thing.

1576
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:40,580
I swear. But yeah, that was a trip.

1577
00:59:40,780 --> 00:59:42,940
My God, Byron.

1578
00:59:43,140 --> 00:59:44,900
Oh, I hope he found his happiness.

1579
00:59:44,900 --> 00:59:46,060
That pain is real.

1580
00:59:46,060 --> 00:59:49,460
I don't know that I would have flipped out, but I would I would be upset.

1581
00:59:49,660 --> 00:59:50,980
Yeah, like you say, why?

1582
00:59:51,180 --> 00:59:52,180
Why today of all days?

1583
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:54,060
I stopped this shit.

1584
00:59:54,260 --> 00:59:54,980
So sad.

1585
00:59:55,180 --> 00:59:58,620
Yeah, I there was an old job that I used to work that I hated.

1586
00:59:58,820 --> 01:00:01,260
And a lot of other people did, too.

1587
01:00:01,260 --> 01:00:03,900
But the food trucks, different food trucks would be there every day.

1588
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:06,820
Yeah. And like Wednesdays, like every other

1589
01:00:06,820 --> 01:00:09,620
Wednesday was always like boba and popcorn chicken.

1590
01:00:09,620 --> 01:00:11,300
And everyone lined up for everyone.

1591
01:00:11,300 --> 01:00:12,060
Love this truck.

1592
01:00:12,060 --> 01:00:15,780
But then the days where it's like, oh, we got a catering gig or like, oh,

1593
01:00:15,980 --> 01:00:18,420
the truck broke down, it needs some maintenance.

1594
01:00:18,420 --> 01:00:19,460
It's not going to be here today.

1595
01:00:19,660 --> 01:00:21,820
Just everyone walking around very defeated.

1596
01:00:22,020 --> 01:00:24,260
They can't just shove popcorn chicken in their mouths.

1597
01:00:24,460 --> 01:00:26,580
Yeah, these jobs suck.

1598
01:00:26,580 --> 01:00:27,860
Like nobody want to be here.

1599
01:00:28,060 --> 01:00:30,500
And you're like, that's the one thing I always like.

1600
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:32,260
Remember now working in the writers room and shit.

1601
01:00:32,460 --> 01:00:35,180
It's like, it don't matter how hard that job gets.

1602
01:00:35,220 --> 01:00:36,740
Like people want to be here.

1603
01:00:36,940 --> 01:00:38,620
They want to be in TV.

1604
01:00:38,820 --> 01:00:41,740
Yeah. Like when I was managing these people,

1605
01:00:41,940 --> 01:00:45,940
you know, I remember my first day as a manager, you know, just trying to motivate.

1606
01:00:46,140 --> 01:00:52,180
I told this girl, I go, I started clocking out for the day and I walked up to her.

1607
01:00:52,180 --> 01:00:55,460
I was like, hey, I just wanted to let you know you had a really great day today.

1608
01:00:55,460 --> 01:00:56,580
Your numbers are really high.

1609
01:00:56,780 --> 01:01:00,540
And she's like, Lamar, I don't give a fuck.

1610
01:01:00,740 --> 01:01:02,580
And they're like, walk away.

1611
01:01:02,780 --> 01:01:04,820
And it's like, oh, like they hate this.

1612
01:01:05,060 --> 01:01:08,940
It's like a lot of them really want to, you know, especially in Hollywood,

1613
01:01:08,940 --> 01:01:10,620
they want to be they want to do what I'm doing.

1614
01:01:10,820 --> 01:01:11,780
But it was funny. I would get it.

1615
01:01:11,780 --> 01:01:12,980
I would always get really bitter to it.

1616
01:01:12,980 --> 01:01:14,500
Because I'm like, you think I want to do this shit?

1617
01:01:14,700 --> 01:01:18,260
I want to be an actor, too, because they would call out all the time for auditions

1618
01:01:18,260 --> 01:01:21,900
and shit. And I'd be like, I get so mad because it's like, you know how auditions

1619
01:01:22,100 --> 01:01:26,460
like there's no way you can really do that efficiently and be a good employee.

1620
01:01:26,460 --> 01:01:29,940
Because you're basically finding out the day of and you're like, oh, I can't come in.

1621
01:01:30,140 --> 01:01:33,780
I got an audition. And I should get so mad because I'm like, you think I want to

1622
01:01:33,820 --> 01:01:35,460
audition, too? I can't just fucking leave.

1623
01:01:35,660 --> 01:01:37,740
But, you know, whatever.

1624
01:01:37,940 --> 01:01:40,340
I try to support them.

1625
01:01:40,540 --> 01:01:43,860
One of us doing actually really good, my homegirl Deja, is like she was.

1626
01:01:44,060 --> 01:01:46,260
It's so funny because she was like

1627
01:01:46,460 --> 01:01:48,940
so funny to me, like always made me laugh.

1628
01:01:49,140 --> 01:01:52,740
Like she was like one of those people that kind of like, you know, like was

1629
01:01:52,940 --> 01:01:55,860
unapologetically, I'm here to be a star.

1630
01:01:56,060 --> 01:01:57,380
Like sure, hired her.

1631
01:01:57,580 --> 01:01:58,980
She's like, I'm a fucking star.

1632
01:01:59,180 --> 01:02:00,620
I can sing. I can act.

1633
01:02:00,660 --> 01:02:01,700
I can do all of it.

1634
01:02:01,900 --> 01:02:03,980
And she's like fucking work.

1635
01:02:04,180 --> 01:02:05,260
I've seen her. I've seen her.

1636
01:02:05,460 --> 01:02:08,700
And it's like, you know, we like I haven't talked to her yet about it.

1637
01:02:08,900 --> 01:02:13,260
But I'm like, if I if I sell this, I'm going to cast her in it and we're going to

1638
01:02:13,460 --> 01:02:16,380
fucking get way. I'm going to make sure we get wax figures in that motherfucker.

1639
01:02:16,580 --> 01:02:20,700
We're going to be next to each other and we'll be in our uniforms.

1640
01:02:20,900 --> 01:02:24,780
I think that'd be that'd be like such a dope ass dream to be like, you could be

1641
01:02:24,780 --> 01:02:28,180
like, they worked here and now they're actually famous and like they're wearing.

1642
01:02:28,380 --> 01:02:29,940
Oh, and the company would love that.

1643
01:02:29,940 --> 01:02:31,140
They would be thrilled at that.

1644
01:02:31,340 --> 01:02:33,460
Yeah, that was like, yeah, I would get this.

1645
01:02:33,660 --> 01:02:34,420
You want to work there?

1646
01:02:34,620 --> 01:02:37,380
The ultimate would be working there and then becoming a wax figure.

1647
01:02:37,580 --> 01:02:39,740
Yeah, that would be the dream.

1648
01:02:39,940 --> 01:02:44,540
Yeah, just being like it is like fully getting waxed, like just being waxed out.

1649
01:02:44,740 --> 01:02:46,820
It's just like I can't move.

1650
01:02:47,020 --> 01:02:50,540
But yeah, no, but there was some talented people working there.

1651
01:02:50,740 --> 01:02:52,700
Like I remember one time I had to fire this guy.

1652
01:02:52,900 --> 01:02:57,500
He goes and he just starts singing like he's like, please don't fire me.

1653
01:02:57,700 --> 01:02:58,660
I need this job.

1654
01:02:58,740 --> 01:03:00,300
Please, I have so much to offer.

1655
01:03:00,500 --> 01:03:03,740
He just started singing and it was his voice was pretty good.

1656
01:03:03,940 --> 01:03:06,140
I actually I was I was so bad at firing.

1657
01:03:06,140 --> 01:03:07,580
I just basically like kept him.

1658
01:03:07,780 --> 01:03:10,220
Just was like, I was like, all right, whatever you can say.

1659
01:03:10,420 --> 01:03:10,980
Good enough.

1660
01:03:11,180 --> 01:03:12,140
Sung your way back.

1661
01:03:12,340 --> 01:03:13,060
Wow. Wow.

1662
01:03:13,260 --> 01:03:13,940
Wow.

1663
01:03:14,140 --> 01:03:15,740
It is wow.

1664
01:03:15,740 --> 01:03:19,260
Just having to be in charge of like I say, like to your point, it's just like most

1665
01:03:19,460 --> 01:03:24,420
people, no one's coming there to want to work in that and want to be at a wax work

1666
01:03:24,460 --> 01:03:25,580
at a wax museum.

1667
01:03:25,780 --> 01:03:29,620
But they you know, you have to kind of

1668
01:03:29,820 --> 01:03:33,900
motivate them to actually care when they're not getting paid enough money to begin with.

1669
01:03:33,900 --> 01:03:35,180
So it's like it's ridiculous.

1670
01:03:35,380 --> 01:03:36,220
Sure. So yeah.

1671
01:03:36,420 --> 01:03:37,020
Yeah.

1672
01:03:37,220 --> 01:03:39,380
Yeah. You're like, I can't really fault you.

1673
01:03:39,580 --> 01:03:42,620
I can't know what it is, but it's kind of nice like that.

1674
01:03:42,660 --> 01:03:46,220
You know, that's like the real Hollywood experience, like all these people who want

1675
01:03:46,420 --> 01:03:50,060
to do other things and be writers and actors and singers and stuff.

1676
01:03:50,100 --> 01:03:51,780
Yeah. Getting in on the ground floor.

1677
01:03:51,980 --> 01:03:55,340
We're like in the like dirty center of Hollywood.

1678
01:03:55,380 --> 01:03:56,220
Right. Right.

1679
01:03:56,420 --> 01:03:58,740
Which that like, I don't know, like you got to feel like, yeah.

1680
01:03:58,740 --> 01:04:03,340
If then if you go on to do anything like I really did it, I like did the the trashy

1681
01:04:03,540 --> 01:04:05,260
ladder center of Hollywood experience.

1682
01:04:05,460 --> 01:04:06,820
I started here and now I'm here.

1683
01:04:06,820 --> 01:04:07,220
Yeah.

1684
01:04:07,420 --> 01:04:08,380
Yeah. It's a weird.

1685
01:04:08,580 --> 01:04:13,020
It gave me a lot of perspective because you kind of see most people who would work

1686
01:04:13,220 --> 01:04:15,980
there at a place like that are like fresh in Hollywood.

1687
01:04:16,180 --> 01:04:18,220
They really just like just like me.

1688
01:04:18,380 --> 01:04:19,980
I had just got moved here.

1689
01:04:20,180 --> 01:04:25,180
So you're like you see the sort of cycle of like I wouldn't call it delusion, but

1690
01:04:25,380 --> 01:04:28,900
just like this idea of like what they think it's going to be.

1691
01:04:29,100 --> 01:04:31,180
And then like because I've been I worked

1692
01:04:31,180 --> 01:04:34,380
there for seven years, so I've seen them and then and then like they're basically

1693
01:04:34,380 --> 01:04:36,780
like two years in and they're like, I got to go back home.

1694
01:04:36,780 --> 01:04:39,500
Like this is you just see that people cycle in and out.

1695
01:04:39,700 --> 01:04:42,380
And you realize like really the secret is I just don't leave.

1696
01:04:42,580 --> 01:04:44,420
But yeah, yeah.

1697
01:04:44,620 --> 01:04:46,460
I mean, it's like I worked there.

1698
01:04:46,580 --> 01:04:49,100
I basically was like

1699
01:04:49,540 --> 01:04:54,260
full on like I had a full career there, like but it wasn't like I knew that like

1700
01:04:54,460 --> 01:04:58,140
this was I was like, oh, my comedy career is not happening.

1701
01:04:58,140 --> 01:05:00,580
It's like this is what's going to this is what I'm going to end up doing.

1702
01:05:00,580 --> 01:05:00,860
Yeah.

1703
01:05:01,060 --> 01:05:06,220
But it was so interesting because the way that I ended up leaving Madison was like

1704
01:05:06,420 --> 01:05:12,300
because I had got such a big reputation with the photo department, this other

1705
01:05:12,340 --> 01:05:17,380
company wanted to recruit me and they kind of like sneakily was like, hey,

1706
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:21,260
we're going to build this new photo site up at Warner Brothers in the tour.

1707
01:05:21,460 --> 01:05:24,020
And we want you to open it and run it.

1708
01:05:24,020 --> 01:05:24,340
Right.

1709
01:05:24,340 --> 01:05:27,660
But they didn't tell because they were they're like they partner with Mountain

1710
01:05:27,660 --> 01:05:30,220
Souls, but they were like kind of like, we want you over here.

1711
01:05:30,420 --> 01:05:33,220
So but they offered me like it was like

1712
01:05:33,420 --> 01:05:37,860
almost three times what I was getting paid at at the Met Wax Museum.

1713
01:05:38,060 --> 01:05:42,260
And I was like, I but I kept feeling like if I take this job, like my every

1714
01:05:42,460 --> 01:05:45,860
all the dream I have of being a comedian and writer is done.

1715
01:05:46,060 --> 01:05:47,420
Like I'm this is who I am.

1716
01:05:47,620 --> 01:05:49,980
And I remember calling somebody.

1717
01:05:49,980 --> 01:05:51,700
I just remember I think it was one of my best friends.

1718
01:05:51,900 --> 01:05:54,100
And I just asked him if I should do it.

1719
01:05:54,300 --> 01:05:57,340
And it was like he was like,

1720
01:05:57,660 --> 01:05:58,820
yeah, like you should do it.

1721
01:05:59,020 --> 01:06:01,580
I mean, it was like it's so much more money.

1722
01:06:01,780 --> 01:06:05,420
And you can like that because that to me was like the thing was like you just

1723
01:06:05,620 --> 01:06:08,220
always want to be able to afford to live here.

1724
01:06:08,220 --> 01:06:11,980
Like that was always the thing that I felt like I was missing because I kept

1725
01:06:11,980 --> 01:06:13,660
trying to skip over and I'm like, fuck that.

1726
01:06:13,860 --> 01:06:15,660
I want to be I want to be in a writer's room.

1727
01:06:15,860 --> 01:06:16,620
Get me in there.

1728
01:06:16,820 --> 01:06:19,580
But then it wasn't happening.

1729
01:06:19,780 --> 01:06:24,140
And the harder you try to like halfway work, like I'm part time working.

1730
01:06:24,340 --> 01:06:24,620
Yeah.

1731
01:06:24,820 --> 01:06:27,380
Until hopefully my dreams come true or like a big break.

1732
01:06:27,580 --> 01:06:30,900
But so I took the job.

1733
01:06:31,100 --> 01:06:31,860
It was so crazy.

1734
01:06:32,060 --> 01:06:34,300
So it was like basically what it was.

1735
01:06:34,500 --> 01:06:37,740
This was like right after like like after the seven years.

1736
01:06:37,940 --> 01:06:40,700
So I go to Warner Brothers.

1737
01:06:40,860 --> 01:06:42,500
I start this whole site.

1738
01:06:42,500 --> 01:06:45,380
I don't know if you've ever been there, but there's like,

1739
01:06:45,580 --> 01:06:48,700
you know, if you go on a Warner Brothers tour and on the studio lot,

1740
01:06:48,900 --> 01:06:54,220
they have this whole section called it's called like Studio 64 or something like

1741
01:06:54,420 --> 01:06:56,500
that. It's not called that.

1742
01:06:56,700 --> 01:06:58,220
I hope that it wasn't called that way.

1743
01:06:58,420 --> 01:07:00,780
Like it's like some kind of part of the tour.

1744
01:07:00,780 --> 01:07:04,700
So the tour you go around the studio lot and you go in this room.

1745
01:07:04,900 --> 01:07:10,060
And we created these like experiences where you get to ride the bat bike and

1746
01:07:10,220 --> 01:07:12,020
and you get to ride the Harry Potter broom.

1747
01:07:12,220 --> 01:07:14,340
And it's like it films you like you're going.

1748
01:07:14,540 --> 01:07:17,860
It's almost like a 3D experience where you're like in it.

1749
01:07:17,860 --> 01:07:19,900
And then you get to keep the video or whatever.

1750
01:07:20,100 --> 01:07:21,860
So I like hired everybody.

1751
01:07:22,060 --> 01:07:23,740
I like install it.

1752
01:07:23,940 --> 01:07:26,780
We like was there for the construction, the whole thing.

1753
01:07:26,980 --> 01:07:29,180
We did a grand opening and everything.

1754
01:07:29,380 --> 01:07:31,620
And it was like a huge success.

1755
01:07:31,820 --> 01:07:34,220
And then like and then I got my first

1756
01:07:34,420 --> 01:07:37,940
writing job offer like literally that week and I just like left.

1757
01:07:38,140 --> 01:07:38,660
It was crazy.

1758
01:07:38,660 --> 01:07:43,100
Like it's just like it's never like to be like it doesn't matter.

1759
01:07:43,300 --> 01:07:45,220
Because like if when it happens, it'll happen.

1760
01:07:45,420 --> 01:07:48,820
But none of the stuff you did before will matter.

1761
01:07:49,020 --> 01:07:51,740
It's not like I did it the right way or anything.

1762
01:07:51,940 --> 01:07:54,140
I fucking worked in corporate world for eight years.

1763
01:07:54,340 --> 01:07:58,300
But the but yeah, that place that place is cool.

1764
01:07:58,300 --> 01:07:59,140
You have to check that out.

1765
01:07:59,140 --> 01:08:00,380
I don't know if you ever want to do that one.

1766
01:08:00,380 --> 01:08:01,580
We could do a part two.

1767
01:08:01,580 --> 01:08:02,500
I can tell you all about that.

1768
01:08:02,700 --> 01:08:04,180
That's what we're talking about.

1769
01:08:04,380 --> 01:08:06,940
Yeah, I added a bunch of new stuff to it.

1770
01:08:06,940 --> 01:08:09,780
Like, yeah, I heard reopening for Go that after Go.

1771
01:08:09,980 --> 01:08:11,980
But I mean, yeah, so we'll get there.

1772
01:08:12,060 --> 01:08:14,340
Still know people in all these places to some extent.

1773
01:08:14,540 --> 01:08:17,220
If you walked in, would you or maybe not the location?

1774
01:08:17,420 --> 01:08:19,340
But like, well, I just found out one of my

1775
01:08:19,540 --> 01:08:22,460
closest friends who had moved away when I quit.

1776
01:08:22,660 --> 01:08:25,780
I just literally found out yesterday that she is back in L.A.

1777
01:08:25,980 --> 01:08:28,380
and is working at what Max Wattam says right now.

1778
01:08:28,380 --> 01:08:30,500
So I might go up there and say what's up to her.

1779
01:08:30,700 --> 01:08:32,900
But for the most like the guy, Colin, who hired me, he's gone.

1780
01:08:33,100 --> 01:08:36,860
Like I don't I don't think a lot of the people I worked with are still there.

1781
01:08:37,060 --> 01:08:39,500
But I'm still I'm still friends with a lot of the people.

1782
01:08:39,700 --> 01:08:43,500
But yeah, that shit was a lifetime, you know.

1783
01:08:43,700 --> 01:08:44,780
That's a long career.

1784
01:08:44,980 --> 01:08:48,580
That's not even like a quick dip of the toe into a profession.

1785
01:08:48,780 --> 01:08:50,140
You really did a full arc.

1786
01:08:50,340 --> 01:08:51,620
A lot of your life.

1787
01:08:51,820 --> 01:08:57,100
Yeah, it's definitely more of my life is that world than the current world that I'm

1788
01:08:57,300 --> 01:09:00,860
doing right now, because I haven't like beat it yet for a few years.

1789
01:09:01,060 --> 01:09:03,740
I will. But yeah, man, not that shit.

1790
01:09:03,820 --> 01:09:06,260
To me, that shit is like

1791
01:09:06,460 --> 01:09:12,460
it's so like cool to just work somewhere where you actually like think like

1792
01:09:12,660 --> 01:09:15,420
it has a sense of irony, but you always get for remember it.

1793
01:09:15,420 --> 01:09:19,740
Like you're saying, Mike, or you're like you get there, you have this irony about it.

1794
01:09:19,740 --> 01:09:22,020
And then you're like, oh, yeah, this is a cool thing.

1795
01:09:22,220 --> 01:09:25,740
Like it's hard to like be like, it's like it's hard to get that.

1796
01:09:25,740 --> 01:09:27,860
It's hard to keep the like this is lame thing going.

1797
01:09:28,060 --> 01:09:30,620
It's just like it's like falling into it a little bit.

1798
01:09:30,820 --> 01:09:31,900
Yeah. Yeah.

1799
01:09:32,100 --> 01:09:33,260
Yeah. Which, hey, you know,

1800
01:09:33,300 --> 01:09:35,020
all your stories are amazing and everything.

1801
01:09:35,220 --> 01:09:36,300
It is a it is a cool place.

1802
01:09:36,500 --> 01:09:39,060
You want to like what else do we feel like about art?

1803
01:09:39,060 --> 01:09:43,220
Because I I feel you caused like some fun days for all of we all went, by the way,

1804
01:09:43,420 --> 01:09:47,140
not together, but not telling anyone that we're I think we all wanted to come in

1805
01:09:47,340 --> 01:09:51,820
like I went to know I went and we all went separately.

1806
01:09:52,020 --> 01:09:54,860
Yes, I did a I did a family trip.

1807
01:09:55,060 --> 01:09:56,020
We all went. Oh, really?

1808
01:09:56,220 --> 01:09:56,700
Yeah. Yeah.

1809
01:09:56,900 --> 01:09:59,580
I brought my my 15 month old.

1810
01:09:59,780 --> 01:10:02,700
And so I got to thank you for that, for bringing this topic to our attention,

1811
01:10:02,700 --> 01:10:04,060
because I was like, how is he going to respond to this?

1812
01:10:04,060 --> 01:10:05,180
Is it going to be weirded out?

1813
01:10:05,380 --> 01:10:07,820
And he didn't really care about the wax figure so much.

1814
01:10:07,820 --> 01:10:10,260
But it's just like a room with a bunch of lights and stuff.

1815
01:10:10,460 --> 01:10:14,940
So in that party room, he was just like he hasn't been to that many parties

1816
01:10:15,140 --> 01:10:17,340
in his life, maybe he's never been to an indoor party.

1817
01:10:17,540 --> 01:10:18,660
He was born during COVID.

1818
01:10:18,860 --> 01:10:22,100
So like this was like a light up stage

1819
01:10:22,300 --> 01:10:25,340
where there's glowing on the floor and Demi Lovato is up there.

1820
01:10:25,540 --> 01:10:26,740
Like he's going nuts.

1821
01:10:26,740 --> 01:10:28,140
He's walking around and clapping.

1822
01:10:28,340 --> 01:10:32,660
There was like a there's a kind of a kind of a scary room like with with tombs.

1823
01:10:32,860 --> 01:10:35,460
And I don't know how much is the same as over there.

1824
01:10:35,660 --> 01:10:38,900
But that, you know, that's, you know, Frankenstein's in there, Dracula and stuff.

1825
01:10:38,900 --> 01:10:42,420
And then like, but there's like they projected a bunch of bugs crawling around

1826
01:10:42,620 --> 01:10:45,420
the floor and that blew his mind. What's happening here?

1827
01:10:45,620 --> 01:10:47,740
He's trying to catch the Beatles.

1828
01:10:47,940 --> 01:10:52,060
He's touching this big wall of garlic next to Dracula.

1829
01:10:52,260 --> 01:10:53,500
He's trying to pull garlics off.

1830
01:10:53,700 --> 01:10:56,940
But then he started then he's given high fives to

1831
01:10:57,140 --> 01:10:59,820
Quentin Tarantino's framing up a shot.

1832
01:11:00,020 --> 01:11:01,380
He's got his arms out.

1833
01:11:01,540 --> 01:11:03,380
So my kids giving him high five.

1834
01:11:03,380 --> 01:11:04,580
This is like one of the best things.

1835
01:11:04,780 --> 01:11:05,340
Wow.

1836
01:11:05,540 --> 01:11:06,820
Don't love it.

1837
01:11:07,020 --> 01:11:08,180
You say, yeah, what a success.

1838
01:11:08,380 --> 01:11:08,940
So yeah.

1839
01:11:09,140 --> 01:11:10,260
So I'm almost thinking like,

1840
01:11:10,460 --> 01:11:14,180
when museums are silly, I guess that might be funny to go see.

1841
01:11:14,180 --> 01:11:17,500
And then I having a kid especially reminds you like, oh, yeah, no, these places are

1842
01:11:17,700 --> 01:11:22,620
great to go to, like, and then especially that magic is so well done.

1843
01:11:22,620 --> 01:11:24,380
And so many little themed environments.

1844
01:11:24,380 --> 01:11:25,500
That's what we care about.

1845
01:11:25,700 --> 01:11:27,820
That's what we got. Lucy's kitchen up here.

1846
01:11:28,020 --> 01:11:30,700
He he kept trying to go out little fake

1847
01:11:30,700 --> 01:11:33,220
doors. He didn't understand a set door.

1848
01:11:33,420 --> 01:11:34,700
So like you do it here.

1849
01:11:34,900 --> 01:11:39,100
But like Lucy's door, you walk up to it like, how do I get out of the kitchen?

1850
01:11:39,300 --> 01:11:41,180
Right. She was always one of my favorites.

1851
01:11:41,380 --> 01:11:42,420
Yeah, that's right.

1852
01:11:42,620 --> 01:11:44,340
She's right when you come in now.

1853
01:11:44,540 --> 01:11:47,980
Is that what she was in the gift shop when I worked there?

1854
01:11:48,180 --> 01:11:50,420
She was a suit that she'd be the last thing you would see.

1855
01:11:50,620 --> 01:11:53,060
So Lucy and Kong are in the lobby now.

1856
01:11:53,260 --> 01:11:53,540
Right.

1857
01:11:53,740 --> 01:11:54,140
Yeah.

1858
01:11:54,340 --> 01:11:55,420
Kong is totally new to me.

1859
01:11:55,620 --> 01:11:58,340
I've never seen Kong with Shrek there.

1860
01:11:58,540 --> 01:11:59,100
This one.

1861
01:11:59,140 --> 01:12:00,140
Oh, and they gave her a set.

1862
01:12:00,140 --> 01:12:01,500
So that's a set, the refrigerator.

1863
01:12:01,700 --> 01:12:02,820
Yeah, she's got a full set.

1864
01:12:03,020 --> 01:12:06,900
And I came straight from tennis.

1865
01:12:07,100 --> 01:12:08,820
I look like shit.

1866
01:12:09,020 --> 01:12:10,020
You've been playing tennis now.

1867
01:12:10,220 --> 01:12:14,380
You must have looked so insane with a potato picture of Ariana Grande.

1868
01:12:14,580 --> 01:12:15,740
With this group.

1869
01:12:15,780 --> 01:12:16,020
Great.

1870
01:12:16,020 --> 01:12:18,860
I think I like I guess because we took identical pictures.

1871
01:12:19,060 --> 01:12:24,700
Ours are doing a peace sign with Lucy in masks.

1872
01:12:24,900 --> 01:12:28,500
But I really was having because like I believe it or not, I've been playing tennis.

1873
01:12:28,500 --> 01:12:29,980
I may have mentioned on the show.

1874
01:12:30,180 --> 01:12:32,500
And I also I also in the last few years,

1875
01:12:32,500 --> 01:12:35,340
believe it or not, maybe I mentioned in the show or into haunts.

1876
01:12:35,540 --> 01:12:36,540
So I started.

1877
01:12:36,540 --> 01:12:38,260
Yeah. Believe it or not, if you haven't heard it.

1878
01:12:38,460 --> 01:12:40,260
So I started getting like kind of haunt

1879
01:12:40,460 --> 01:12:44,460
flashbacks immediately because of how real some of the figures looked.

1880
01:12:44,660 --> 01:12:49,180
So I couldn't my body physically couldn't go up to Lucy because I was sure.

1881
01:12:49,380 --> 01:12:53,980
I obviously knew she wasn't alive, but there was some part of my like

1882
01:12:54,180 --> 01:12:57,860
prehistoric brain or whatever that's like this is a living person.

1883
01:12:57,940 --> 01:12:59,220
And she's going to scare me.

1884
01:12:59,420 --> 01:13:00,500
I got better.

1885
01:13:00,700 --> 01:13:04,060
This is what we're learning is that you've never been to a wax museum.

1886
01:13:04,100 --> 01:13:06,900
I never know if you would ever done, then you wouldn't be having.

1887
01:13:07,100 --> 01:13:09,140
This is pretty like elementary stuff.

1888
01:13:09,340 --> 01:13:11,940
I feel like things like scared of the figure.

1889
01:13:12,140 --> 01:13:13,380
I found that feel.

1890
01:13:13,380 --> 01:13:15,540
I found it a little unnerving first in that big.

1891
01:13:15,740 --> 01:13:18,380
Scott, you're brave and you can do it.

1892
01:13:18,580 --> 01:13:20,340
I was the king of that party.

1893
01:13:20,540 --> 01:13:23,980
Being vulnerable on a podcast and explaining.

1894
01:13:24,180 --> 01:13:24,900
It's just funny.

1895
01:13:24,940 --> 01:13:28,660
I guess the first wax museum experience ever.

1896
01:13:28,860 --> 01:13:31,260
And again, I would say like this, I'm glad you did this.

1897
01:13:31,260 --> 01:13:33,380
This is great. You got to go check out like a crappy one.

1898
01:13:33,580 --> 01:13:35,220
I know I'm all in.

1899
01:13:35,420 --> 01:13:38,100
I don't want to take I'm a wax guy now.

1900
01:13:38,300 --> 01:13:39,060
Who is that?

1901
01:13:39,260 --> 01:13:40,500
Rihanna? That's Rihanna.

1902
01:13:40,700 --> 01:13:41,700
Mike loves wax.

1903
01:13:41,900 --> 01:13:44,620
Lamar is a wax man, but I'm a wax man.

1904
01:13:44,820 --> 01:13:46,420
Casual interest.

1905
01:13:46,620 --> 01:13:49,180
And I got a wax baby.

1906
01:13:49,380 --> 01:13:51,380
So I took a photo with Rihanna.

1907
01:13:51,580 --> 01:13:53,140
Then I started feeling that's a great one.

1908
01:13:53,180 --> 01:13:57,500
The first the first few of them, I also like was like, I can't.

1909
01:13:57,540 --> 01:13:58,660
I don't want to get to again.

1910
01:13:58,660 --> 01:13:59,900
I felt like this is a human being.

1911
01:14:00,100 --> 01:14:03,420
And then there's some of the pop stars are like wearing a bathing suit.

1912
01:14:03,620 --> 01:14:05,700
Then that made me also feel asivius.

1913
01:14:05,700 --> 01:14:10,540
Yeah. And I was like, I can't like put my arm around this woman in a bathing suit.

1914
01:14:10,740 --> 01:14:16,140
I think suits describe the sparkly.

1915
01:14:16,340 --> 01:14:17,340
It's a bralette.

1916
01:14:17,540 --> 01:14:19,580
What would you call that?

1917
01:14:19,780 --> 01:14:22,460
You know, I don't have a name exactly.

1918
01:14:22,460 --> 01:14:24,060
You're right. Her midriff is showing.

1919
01:14:24,260 --> 01:14:25,740
Scott, what would you call it?

1920
01:14:25,940 --> 01:14:30,380
You then just stuff to like Ryan Reynolds in a generic black suit.

1921
01:14:30,580 --> 01:14:30,900
Yeah.

1922
01:14:31,100 --> 01:14:32,500
George Lopez is going strong.

1923
01:14:32,700 --> 01:14:34,100
He's not moved the elevator.

1924
01:14:34,300 --> 01:14:35,980
It's funny. That's a funny first one.

1925
01:14:36,180 --> 01:14:38,300
And this is all this is always the L.A. thing.

1926
01:14:38,500 --> 01:14:40,460
I'm wading into the water here.

1927
01:14:40,460 --> 01:14:43,900
Those first two. I'm like, OK, it's like it is creeping me out a little bit.

1928
01:14:44,020 --> 01:14:45,700
George, I thought it was a real person.

1929
01:14:45,700 --> 01:14:46,540
I got off the elevator.

1930
01:14:46,540 --> 01:14:48,660
I'm like, oh, there's some people just standing around in here.

1931
01:14:48,660 --> 01:14:50,700
Yeah. And I was totally caught off guard.

1932
01:14:50,740 --> 01:14:52,420
I went, oh, my God, they're all wax figures.

1933
01:14:52,620 --> 01:14:54,540
There's barely any real humans in this room.

1934
01:14:54,740 --> 01:14:55,660
Yes.

1935
01:14:55,860 --> 01:14:59,260
Yeah. That happens to everyone when I used to work in that room and they would walk

1936
01:14:59,460 --> 01:15:03,100
off and always think George is real. Like, yes, this one is terrifying.

1937
01:15:03,300 --> 01:15:04,340
He's crazy. Yeah.

1938
01:15:04,540 --> 01:15:05,700
He's really scary.

1939
01:15:05,700 --> 01:15:07,260
We didn't tell John. Oh, sorry. Yeah.

1940
01:15:07,460 --> 01:15:09,540
But all these up. We'll put all these up.

1941
01:15:09,740 --> 01:15:11,620
And then they have that.

1942
01:15:11,820 --> 01:15:13,140
That's Lord.

1943
01:15:13,340 --> 01:15:16,660
I wanted to in that room where I was like, who is this?

1944
01:15:16,860 --> 01:15:17,900
I was like, oh, it's Lord.

1945
01:15:17,900 --> 01:15:20,940
And the other was, I think, Chloe Kardashian,

1946
01:15:21,140 --> 01:15:23,180
who's just in a very generic outfit.

1947
01:15:23,380 --> 01:15:24,980
No, it's Kylie Jenner. It's not Chloe.

1948
01:15:25,180 --> 01:15:27,740
You know what I mean? She's just standing by a chandelier.

1949
01:15:27,940 --> 01:15:29,460
Oh, she looks perfect.

1950
01:15:29,660 --> 01:15:30,820
She looks real.

1951
01:15:31,020 --> 01:15:32,140
She looks like a real person.

1952
01:15:32,340 --> 01:15:33,740
It was wild how real she looked.

1953
01:15:33,940 --> 01:15:34,460
Yeah.

1954
01:15:34,660 --> 01:15:35,420
I mean, I met you.

1955
01:15:35,620 --> 01:15:36,980
Her shoulders are exposed.

1956
01:15:37,180 --> 01:15:38,700
I'm not getting too close.

1957
01:15:38,900 --> 01:15:40,780
OK, she's like, come over here.

1958
01:15:40,980 --> 01:15:42,460
Come on. Morgan Freeman.

1959
01:15:42,660 --> 01:15:44,460
You don't want to bother. He's wearing a scarf.

1960
01:15:44,660 --> 01:15:45,180
Yeah.

1961
01:15:45,260 --> 01:15:47,740
I will say when I work at night,

1962
01:15:47,940 --> 01:15:51,340
I used to close that thing at night and like there was this moment right around

1963
01:15:51,540 --> 01:15:53,460
1230 where the entire lights were shut out.

1964
01:15:53,660 --> 01:15:58,820
But I had to I can't I had to walk all the way through the museum to get to my car.

1965
01:15:59,020 --> 01:16:03,380
And if it if I always it was always a rush to get to finish before that happened,

1966
01:16:03,580 --> 01:16:06,700
because it's terrifying, like, you know, it's not like there's like no light.

1967
01:16:06,700 --> 01:16:08,660
So you're like, you really can't tell what's you.

1968
01:16:08,860 --> 01:16:10,860
It looks like just figures in the dark.

1969
01:16:11,060 --> 01:16:12,780
And you're like, it's so scary.

1970
01:16:12,780 --> 01:16:17,340
Well, because there's this history in movies and TV, horror movies and just like

1971
01:16:17,540 --> 01:16:22,100
regular movies or TV shows of like wax museums are creepy places.

1972
01:16:22,300 --> 01:16:25,820
Something might start moving in here or you might get covered in.

1973
01:16:26,020 --> 01:16:28,140
Yes. Well, in every talk show.

1974
01:16:28,340 --> 01:16:29,740
Jason Derulo.

1975
01:16:29,940 --> 01:16:32,020
He's coming. Yeah, he definitely did that pose.

1976
01:16:32,220 --> 01:16:33,700
They probably they probably measured it.

1977
01:16:33,900 --> 01:16:35,780
Oh, there's Elton John's. Oh, yeah, I see it.

1978
01:16:35,780 --> 01:16:38,060
But not with they say they moved Elton from the stage.

1979
01:16:38,060 --> 01:16:40,300
So Demi's up there. Demi Lovato's on the stage.

1980
01:16:40,340 --> 01:16:41,340
Running around this.

1981
01:16:41,540 --> 01:16:44,180
That was the best moment of his life. Yeah.

1982
01:16:44,380 --> 01:16:47,860
The other thing you learn about is like because they're doing it, you know,

1983
01:16:48,060 --> 01:16:54,020
to the actual sizes are like, oh, yeah, celebrities are all not that tall.

1984
01:16:54,220 --> 01:16:56,380
Bob Hope was tall. Yeah.

1985
01:16:56,580 --> 01:16:59,220
Well, Jimmy Stewart and Snoop Dogg, I think were the tall.

1986
01:16:59,220 --> 01:17:00,500
Jimmy Stewart freaked me out.

1987
01:17:00,500 --> 01:17:04,980
I don't think I realized he was so tall, but like I could I could like Jimmy Fallon

1988
01:17:05,180 --> 01:17:08,220
take Timberlake. I love Meryl Streets figure.

1989
01:17:08,220 --> 01:17:10,900
And to me, my favorite part of the Wax Museum is

1990
01:17:11,100 --> 01:17:13,820
this one is that they get real outfits like.

1991
01:17:13,820 --> 01:17:14,540
Yes.

1992
01:17:14,740 --> 01:17:16,060
That's definitely Betty White.

1993
01:17:16,260 --> 01:17:19,100
Betty White and Betty White looks terrifyingly real as well.

1994
01:17:19,300 --> 01:17:20,580
Yeah, I met her.

1995
01:17:20,780 --> 01:17:23,820
She was she came in when she came and hung out with us and stuff.

1996
01:17:24,020 --> 01:17:25,020
It was nice.

1997
01:17:25,220 --> 01:17:25,620
Yeah.

1998
01:17:25,820 --> 01:17:31,340
I had the experience in the party room of being sitting next to a wax figure of

1999
01:17:31,540 --> 01:17:34,900
someone who I have been around in real life, which is Conan O'Brien.

2000
01:17:34,900 --> 01:17:36,220
Yes. Which is a very strange.

2001
01:17:36,220 --> 01:17:37,460
I like this is new to me.

2002
01:17:37,460 --> 01:17:42,540
I've never been here where I've been around the real person, which is really

2003
01:17:42,740 --> 01:17:45,540
that I think freaked me out on a cosmic level.

2004
01:17:45,740 --> 01:17:49,100
And mainly I was worried that he would come to life, reveal that it's the real

2005
01:17:49,300 --> 01:17:52,460
him and start punching me in the arm, which is what he did in real life.

2006
01:17:52,460 --> 01:17:53,220
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

2007
01:17:53,220 --> 01:17:54,620
I don't think I'm telling tales out of school.

2008
01:17:54,820 --> 01:17:55,780
That was a frequent.

2009
01:17:55,980 --> 01:17:58,580
He left me alone mostly because I'm a weakling.

2010
01:17:58,580 --> 01:17:59,700
He knew I couldn't take it.

2011
01:17:59,900 --> 01:18:01,980
But there were some arm punches.

2012
01:18:02,180 --> 01:18:04,020
Conan's on a bench and you could sit next to him.

2013
01:18:04,020 --> 01:18:06,020
But also on that bench is Simon Cowell.

2014
01:18:06,020 --> 01:18:06,940
And he's just kind of in the.

2015
01:18:07,140 --> 01:18:07,660
Yeah.

2016
01:18:07,860 --> 01:18:08,500
Oh, yeah.

2017
01:18:08,700 --> 01:18:10,260
Those guys get moved.

2018
01:18:10,460 --> 01:18:14,540
When we first started, we had the American Idol

2019
01:18:14,740 --> 01:18:18,260
room America when I first got hired, American Idol was the thing.

2020
01:18:18,460 --> 01:18:20,860
Like they had just like become a thing.

2021
01:18:21,060 --> 01:18:25,100
And since then, like those figures have not found a home.

2022
01:18:25,300 --> 01:18:25,900
They just keep moving.

2023
01:18:26,100 --> 01:18:28,140
Like, what's the main guy's name?

2024
01:18:28,340 --> 01:18:28,740
The host.

2025
01:18:28,940 --> 01:18:29,620
Seacrest. Yeah.

2026
01:18:29,820 --> 01:18:32,980
Seacrest. He moves around so much they can't figure out where to put it.

2027
01:18:33,140 --> 01:18:37,940
Because he's not in the movie area and he's not in the classic Hollywood area.

2028
01:18:37,940 --> 01:18:38,780
Like, what do you.

2029
01:18:38,980 --> 01:18:40,660
They had him by the bar in the party.

2030
01:18:40,860 --> 01:18:41,460
Was he still there?

2031
01:18:41,660 --> 01:18:43,020
He was last time I was there.

2032
01:18:43,220 --> 01:18:45,260
He's just there's like a bar in the corner.

2033
01:18:45,460 --> 01:18:48,780
He just sit in there like as if he's at a Hollywood party and he's like,

2034
01:18:48,780 --> 01:18:51,820
this is probably where I would be currently at the bar.

2035
01:18:52,020 --> 01:18:53,460
Barack Obama.

2036
01:18:53,660 --> 01:18:54,580
Oh, yeah.

2037
01:18:54,780 --> 01:18:55,300
Yeah.

2038
01:18:55,500 --> 01:18:56,340
Why is that?

2039
01:18:56,540 --> 01:18:59,180
That's kind of behind Betty White.

2040
01:18:59,180 --> 01:19:01,060
Like he was lurking in the photo you had earlier.

2041
01:19:01,180 --> 01:19:02,060
I was going to ask this.

2042
01:19:02,260 --> 01:19:05,100
Was there ever a time where there were more political figures?

2043
01:19:05,100 --> 01:19:07,540
Because I feel like other wax museums would have a lot of that.

2044
01:19:07,540 --> 01:19:08,820
But this is the Hollywood ones.

2045
01:19:09,020 --> 01:19:09,700
Right. Less.

2046
01:19:09,900 --> 01:19:10,260
No.

2047
01:19:10,460 --> 01:19:10,820
Yeah.

2048
01:19:11,020 --> 01:19:13,460
Barack was our only major political one.

2049
01:19:13,660 --> 01:19:15,460
There was a time where he was the feature.

2050
01:19:15,660 --> 01:19:18,980
Like when he was he was literally the first thing you would see when you came in.

2051
01:19:19,180 --> 01:19:21,700
But DC has a lot of them.

2052
01:19:21,900 --> 01:19:22,980
Yeah, they got all of them.

2053
01:19:23,180 --> 01:19:23,220
Yeah.

2054
01:19:23,420 --> 01:19:27,060
Recent presidents and then like Uncle Sam.

2055
01:19:27,260 --> 01:19:28,820
They got somewhere.

2056
01:19:28,820 --> 01:19:30,180
It's like here's Albert Einstein.

2057
01:19:30,220 --> 01:19:32,180
And you turn like in some of the other

2058
01:19:32,380 --> 01:19:35,860
museums like here's Albert Einstein, you know, here's Winston Churchill.

2059
01:19:36,060 --> 01:19:37,820
And now here's Rocket Raccoon.

2060
01:19:38,020 --> 01:19:39,260
Yeah, they're breaking them.

2061
01:19:39,260 --> 01:19:42,700
Like I remember there was a big we had a big fight at one of the pre shows because

2062
01:19:42,900 --> 01:19:46,620
we couldn't figure out the rule because I thought there was a rule that we don't

2063
01:19:46,820 --> 01:19:52,380
do characters like but it seems like breaking that rule or they're breaking that game.

2064
01:19:52,580 --> 01:19:53,380
Marvel. Yeah.

2065
01:19:53,580 --> 01:19:54,100
Yeah. Yeah.

2066
01:19:54,300 --> 01:19:57,180
Because I remember we had it was a big argument.

2067
01:19:57,340 --> 01:20:02,620
Because you went to the other manager who was like, they were like, no, we don't do

2068
01:20:02,820 --> 01:20:06,020
characters, we only do real people here and we're like, I don't know.

2069
01:20:06,220 --> 01:20:08,460
I think I've seen a couple of characters.

2070
01:20:08,660 --> 01:20:11,340
I definitely see the video game character in the action hero role.

2071
01:20:11,540 --> 01:20:13,380
But it was like a huge debate.

2072
01:20:13,380 --> 01:20:15,620
But I think I think it probably started out that way.

2073
01:20:15,820 --> 01:20:20,020
And then they were like, well, might as well sell out.

2074
01:20:20,220 --> 01:20:22,660
Yeah, people get kids in there, you know.

2075
01:20:22,660 --> 01:20:23,100
Yeah.

2076
01:20:23,300 --> 01:20:25,060
Yeah, they have the actual like Wolverine and shit.

2077
01:20:25,260 --> 01:20:26,940
Kids aren't as interested in.

2078
01:20:27,060 --> 01:20:31,060
There was a line of young people lining up to take this picture with Ingrid Bergman.

2079
01:20:31,260 --> 01:20:32,020
Yeah.

2080
01:20:32,220 --> 01:20:35,980
I will say this was like my when you hear my album coming out.

2081
01:20:36,180 --> 01:20:36,980
We'll talk about it later.

2082
01:20:37,180 --> 01:20:40,340
But I like really big on Hollywood and it's working here.

2083
01:20:40,540 --> 01:20:41,780
Oh, nice.

2084
01:20:41,980 --> 01:20:42,940
I really got into it.

2085
01:20:43,140 --> 01:20:43,980
I love Audrey.

2086
01:20:44,180 --> 01:20:46,180
I started getting so excited in this room.

2087
01:20:46,380 --> 01:20:47,140
Yeah.

2088
01:20:47,340 --> 01:20:51,900
I was an adult man alone wearing like sweats like tennis.

2089
01:20:52,100 --> 01:20:53,580
Like, hey, I'm sweating too.

2090
01:20:53,780 --> 01:20:54,540
It's hot outside.

2091
01:20:54,740 --> 01:20:56,020
Band on, by the way.

2092
01:20:56,060 --> 01:20:57,380
Well, my hair was so bad.

2093
01:20:57,580 --> 01:21:00,060
I felt like it looked better with the headband on.

2094
01:21:00,260 --> 01:21:01,980
And I didn't everyone in the museum.

2095
01:21:01,980 --> 01:21:03,700
You're saying, sorry, I was playing tennis, tennis, early.

2096
01:21:03,900 --> 01:21:04,420
It was tennis.

2097
01:21:04,620 --> 01:21:08,340
I did not think also that I was going to be like taking photos with all these.

2098
01:21:08,420 --> 01:21:10,500
I thought I would be taking photos from far away.

2099
01:21:10,700 --> 01:21:14,300
So I probably would have gone home and put a suit on or something.

2100
01:21:14,500 --> 01:21:17,420
Yeah. You got to go back and wear like a full.

2101
01:21:17,620 --> 01:21:18,140
Yeah.

2102
01:21:18,340 --> 01:21:18,860
Respect.

2103
01:21:19,060 --> 01:21:22,620
So do you guys have my photos to some of them?

2104
01:21:22,620 --> 01:21:23,820
I have some of them. Yeah.

2105
01:21:23,820 --> 01:21:24,340
Yeah. Yeah.

2106
01:21:24,340 --> 01:21:25,820
That's my favorite room right now.

2107
01:21:26,020 --> 01:21:27,180
I've had worse.

2108
01:21:27,380 --> 01:21:29,980
My arms are much shorter than yours.

2109
01:21:30,180 --> 01:21:32,900
Oh, that's a Star Trek pop star trekking deck.

2110
01:21:33,100 --> 01:21:34,100
Yeah.

2111
01:21:35,340 --> 01:21:36,780
Yeah. This is my favorite one.

2112
01:21:36,980 --> 01:21:38,140
That's obviously the best photo.

2113
01:21:38,140 --> 01:21:40,260
I have multiple photos with him, but I won't show that.

2114
01:21:40,260 --> 01:21:41,460
I won't bore you. Jack Nicholson.

2115
01:21:41,460 --> 01:21:44,620
Yeah, there's one photo op and we'll put it on where he's got a cigar and he's

2116
01:21:44,820 --> 01:21:47,380
like at the Oscars and he's like telling you a joke.

2117
01:21:47,580 --> 01:21:50,260
I assume it's dirty and you get to react to it.

2118
01:21:50,260 --> 01:21:51,820
Mike's pretending he's not offended.

2119
01:21:51,820 --> 01:21:52,900
Yeah. Well, he's yes.

2120
01:21:52,900 --> 01:21:53,660
He's a legend.

2121
01:21:53,660 --> 01:21:54,500
So I would not.

2122
01:21:54,540 --> 01:21:56,900
I would I wouldn't scold him for the language.

2123
01:21:56,900 --> 01:21:58,100
I'd burn you with that cigar.

2124
01:21:58,300 --> 01:22:04,060
Yeah, I was this when I first walked in, I was like I'm people watching a little

2125
01:22:04,060 --> 01:22:07,340
because I was curious, like, oh, are people into this or people excited to be here?

2126
01:22:07,540 --> 01:22:10,580
Right. And I think

2127
01:22:11,380 --> 01:22:16,580
we saw a person walk by the Jimmy Fallon one went, oh, Jimmy Fallon looks so cute.

2128
01:22:16,780 --> 01:22:19,740
And then down on the classic Hollywood

2129
01:22:19,980 --> 01:22:25,780
section, the Marlon Brando from The Godfather, a guy so loudly went, oh, yeah,

2130
01:22:25,980 --> 01:22:27,820
this is cool.

2131
01:22:28,020 --> 01:22:30,500
I was like, I.

2132
01:22:30,700 --> 01:22:31,900
Yeah. OK, it's working.

2133
01:22:31,900 --> 01:22:32,980
It's working for people.

2134
01:22:33,180 --> 01:22:36,820
What were your favorites of all the different photo ops?

2135
01:22:37,020 --> 01:22:37,700
Well, Johnny Grant.

2136
01:22:37,700 --> 01:22:40,100
I was very excited that they had Johnny.

2137
01:22:40,300 --> 01:22:41,740
Johnny Grant, too.

2138
01:22:41,940 --> 01:22:43,300
Yeah.

2139
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:48,180
Howard Hughes, too, because it was just such an insane life, like such an insane

2140
01:22:48,180 --> 01:22:54,180
man, like it was so funny to see him like by Bogart and then like Fred Astaire and

2141
01:22:54,180 --> 01:22:57,420
Ginger Rogers. And then there's Howard Hughes and his like aviation.

2142
01:22:57,420 --> 01:22:58,500
Right. Yeah.

2143
01:22:58,700 --> 01:23:00,580
Did you Lamar? Did you have a favorite years?

2144
01:23:00,580 --> 01:23:01,580
Yeah, I had a few.

2145
01:23:01,780 --> 01:23:05,540
I think Morgan Freeman was one I just had to detail him was dope.

2146
01:23:05,740 --> 01:23:06,700
Oh, yeah.

2147
01:23:06,900 --> 01:23:08,420
Who else did I like?

2148
01:23:08,620 --> 01:23:12,420
I always liked the Meryl Streep.

2149
01:23:13,700 --> 01:23:15,340
Trying to remember there was one I just

2150
01:23:15,380 --> 01:23:17,740
loved. I really love Shrek, too.

2151
01:23:17,940 --> 01:23:19,020
Do you see Shrek?

2152
01:23:19,220 --> 01:23:21,300
I don't think Shrek's around.

2153
01:23:21,500 --> 01:23:22,780
I think he got replaced with Kong.

2154
01:23:22,780 --> 01:23:25,100
It sounds like you can't have Kong and Shrek.

2155
01:23:25,300 --> 01:23:30,180
I feel like that that's a thing where like we only have one big ass thing because I

2156
01:23:30,380 --> 01:23:31,300
that was like a big deal.

2157
01:23:31,300 --> 01:23:35,540
We used to have to because we would take him out in this front to have them

2158
01:23:35,740 --> 01:23:36,980
attract kids and stuff.

2159
01:23:37,180 --> 01:23:40,500
And it would be so funny because he would like we had like a two hour window and he

2160
01:23:40,700 --> 01:23:44,500
started his face melting and we had to like run down and like bring him back in.

2161
01:23:44,540 --> 01:23:47,180
It was so fun. But like I really like I really like Shrek.

2162
01:23:47,380 --> 01:23:49,580
He was his his his shit is full wax.

2163
01:23:49,780 --> 01:23:53,540
Like I don't know. It must have took a lot of wax because his head is like all wax.

2164
01:23:53,740 --> 01:23:54,780
It is huge. Yeah.

2165
01:23:54,980 --> 01:23:59,980
Yeah. A few of the museums have Shrek's and I swear like one of them.

2166
01:24:00,180 --> 01:24:04,140
I don't know if one like the Google image results like one is a Madame Tussauds

2167
01:24:04,140 --> 01:24:05,660
Shrek and one is a bad Shrek.

2168
01:24:05,660 --> 01:24:09,700
But there was one where it's like that Shrek face doesn't look right.

2169
01:24:09,900 --> 01:24:12,700
I saw a lot where it's like, oh, that Shrek doesn't look right.

2170
01:24:12,780 --> 01:24:15,780
Is there a melting possibility in general?

2171
01:24:15,980 --> 01:24:19,620
Is there an actual danger of that with these figures overall?

2172
01:24:19,820 --> 01:24:20,860
Yes, they will melt.

2173
01:24:21,060 --> 01:24:23,860
They you put them in the sun, they will melt.

2174
01:24:24,060 --> 01:24:26,020
They melt, they melt, they melt.

2175
01:24:26,220 --> 01:24:27,460
I can't tell you all enough.

2176
01:24:27,660 --> 01:24:30,060
But, you know, inside they're good.

2177
01:24:30,060 --> 01:24:32,420
You know, you keep them in a cool area like room temp.

2178
01:24:32,420 --> 01:24:33,060
They ain't gonna melt.

2179
01:24:33,260 --> 01:24:35,820
But if you put them outside, like in L.A. and California,

2180
01:24:36,020 --> 01:24:40,140
yeah, like you'll see when Shrek used to melt, like if you didn't get out there

2181
01:24:40,180 --> 01:24:44,340
fast enough, like his face would just like like it was like a legit like cost

2182
01:24:44,540 --> 01:24:47,820
benefit, we were just like, we're getting so many people

2183
01:24:48,020 --> 01:24:51,420
like excited by having them outside that it was worth the damage.

2184
01:24:51,620 --> 01:24:55,580
We would actually like the guys in the back hated it because they we constantly

2185
01:24:55,580 --> 01:24:58,020
had they had to redo them all the time because it was just melting.

2186
01:24:58,220 --> 01:24:59,940
Oh, yeah, because there's upkeep people.

2187
01:25:00,140 --> 01:25:01,660
That's my that's my question.

2188
01:25:01,860 --> 01:25:02,740
What does that look like?

2189
01:25:02,940 --> 01:25:05,980
How many people are working each day in that area?

2190
01:25:06,180 --> 01:25:07,780
It's like it's like one guy.

2191
01:25:07,820 --> 01:25:12,500
Usually it's probably a staff of like three, but it was only like one in a day.

2192
01:25:12,700 --> 01:25:13,980
And they're like, they're cool.

2193
01:25:14,180 --> 01:25:16,300
They're like way cooler.

2194
01:25:16,500 --> 01:25:20,100
They're like, they're like, oh, would you fuck up Shrek again or whatever?

2195
01:25:20,300 --> 01:25:21,340
I bring them in here.

2196
01:25:21,540 --> 01:25:25,780
But they're like, they're not the guys who make them like they're like they like

2197
01:25:25,780 --> 01:25:29,420
hope to be those guys, you know, like you kind of start out in the in the bet.

2198
01:25:29,620 --> 01:25:33,740
We call them behind the scenes guys and they not got there's women, too.

2199
01:25:33,940 --> 01:25:36,380
So they all work back there and they kind

2200
01:25:36,380 --> 01:25:39,580
of just do like makeup and they keep their hair like it's a good job for like

2201
01:25:39,780 --> 01:25:42,180
you like in the hair and makeup to you do that.

2202
01:25:42,380 --> 01:25:44,100
And then

2203
01:25:44,300 --> 01:25:48,300
but they have to they they're they're like their hopes is in the same way that I

2204
01:25:48,300 --> 01:25:51,620
got promoted to manager, they're hoping to get promoted to like the big

2205
01:25:51,820 --> 01:25:54,140
where they make the real shit and get a part of it.

2206
01:25:54,340 --> 01:25:56,540
Is that where is that a centralized location?

2207
01:25:56,740 --> 01:25:57,620
I think it's in the UK.

2208
01:25:57,820 --> 01:26:02,500
I don't know where, but it's definitely not in America.

2209
01:26:02,700 --> 01:26:04,220
But I think I think it's out there.

2210
01:26:04,380 --> 01:26:06,820
Can I say something about this zone with sort of the classic guys?

2211
01:26:07,020 --> 01:26:11,660
I the godfather, I got stuck there for a while

2212
01:26:11,860 --> 01:26:16,820
because my son was interested not so much in him, but in his desk, was just kind of

2213
01:26:16,820 --> 01:26:19,180
playing with his desk, just like the texture of the desk.

2214
01:26:19,180 --> 01:26:20,820
So it made me stare at that for a while,

2215
01:26:20,980 --> 01:26:23,420
which made me notice that like it's really good and a good little set there.

2216
01:26:23,620 --> 01:26:30,620
But Don Corleone's desk does have the the cord management holes like he's got like

2217
01:26:31,220 --> 01:26:34,660
hiding your your your iMac.

2218
01:26:34,860 --> 01:26:40,460
So I guess and I don't I just I don't think that was his was the era where

2219
01:26:40,660 --> 01:26:44,660
having too many too many fucking cords,

2220
01:26:44,860 --> 01:26:46,340
so

2221
01:26:46,540 --> 01:26:47,460
those are killing me.

2222
01:26:47,660 --> 01:26:50,820
Coppola see that he'll start to fit.

2223
01:26:51,020 --> 01:26:52,580
They still have Kobe Bryant in there.

2224
01:26:52,580 --> 01:26:54,860
I'm curious if they did anything with that.

2225
01:26:55,060 --> 01:26:57,100
I don't think so.

2226
01:26:57,300 --> 01:27:00,260
They had a really they had a sports or did they have a sports room?

2227
01:27:00,420 --> 01:27:03,700
No, I think that's what they turn into that scary room.

2228
01:27:03,900 --> 01:27:09,900
Well, there's that or like the what was on the first floor was kind of the big

2229
01:27:10,100 --> 01:27:13,500
like final room before the behind the scenes

2230
01:27:13,700 --> 01:27:16,540
because currently it's a big 90s.

2231
01:27:16,740 --> 01:27:18,060
Oh, yeah, yeah.

2232
01:27:18,260 --> 01:27:20,020
Like that's where Tupac is now.

2233
01:27:20,220 --> 01:27:25,380
There's a saloon in there and there's kind of a 90s bedroom.

2234
01:27:25,580 --> 01:27:26,300
Yeah, it's after this.

2235
01:27:26,500 --> 01:27:26,900
Yes.

2236
01:27:27,100 --> 01:27:28,260
Snoop in here.

2237
01:27:28,460 --> 01:27:30,140
Snoop, I guess, counts as a 90s.

2238
01:27:30,340 --> 01:27:32,780
I like the way they're appropriating the rappers.

2239
01:27:32,980 --> 01:27:35,020
It's a little so nice.

2240
01:27:35,220 --> 01:27:37,740
Yeah, like they deserve to be in the party room.

2241
01:27:37,940 --> 01:27:40,500
I think it was Furbies and Tupac basically.

2242
01:27:40,700 --> 01:27:45,540
Yeah, like Tupac should not be with Cameron Diaz with the sperm here.

2243
01:27:45,740 --> 01:27:48,060
Like that's insane.

2244
01:27:48,260 --> 01:27:48,700
Oh, yeah.

2245
01:27:48,900 --> 01:27:51,700
Bodyguard era Whitney specifically.

2246
01:27:51,900 --> 01:27:53,580
So maybe this was sports at some.

2247
01:27:53,580 --> 01:27:55,860
Yeah, there were not the action here.

2248
01:27:56,060 --> 01:27:58,820
A room like this had like they have Arnold in there.

2249
01:27:58,820 --> 01:27:59,660
Arnold's in that room.

2250
01:27:59,660 --> 01:28:02,580
But yeah, he's like they left him for because he gets technically that is the 90s.

2251
01:28:02,780 --> 01:28:04,340
Who is that in the back with the suit on?

2252
01:28:04,540 --> 01:28:05,460
Pierce Brosnan.

2253
01:28:05,660 --> 01:28:06,860
OK, yeah, yeah, he was there.

2254
01:28:07,060 --> 01:28:07,620
He was there.

2255
01:28:07,820 --> 01:28:08,740
Celine is back there.

2256
01:28:08,740 --> 01:28:09,940
I don't I didn't put all the photos in.

2257
01:28:10,140 --> 01:28:12,780
And then Madame Tussaud herself is on like a landing.

2258
01:28:12,980 --> 01:28:16,060
She's on like the exit landing with the right of the axe.

2259
01:28:16,260 --> 01:28:18,860
She is an insane person.

2260
01:28:19,060 --> 01:28:19,940
She was making.

2261
01:28:20,140 --> 01:28:22,100
She looks insane in this picture.

2262
01:28:22,300 --> 01:28:27,140
There are some of her where she's like hunched over a desk and she this is like

2263
01:28:27,340 --> 01:28:28,140
the better version.

2264
01:28:28,180 --> 01:28:30,740
Yeah, that's it's really creepy at the end.

2265
01:28:30,940 --> 01:28:34,060
Yeah, like Mars Attacks haired woman

2266
01:28:34,260 --> 01:28:38,380
who like creates the perfect facsimiles of people.

2267
01:28:38,580 --> 01:28:45,660
She also like she made heads off of she would like get decapitated heads,

2268
01:28:45,860 --> 01:28:49,060
heads that had gotten guillotined in the French Revolution.

2269
01:28:49,260 --> 01:28:49,900
I believe so.

2270
01:28:50,100 --> 01:28:50,500
I don't know.

2271
01:28:50,700 --> 01:28:54,460
I can read a report on it, but I like she almost got beheaded at some point.

2272
01:28:54,660 --> 01:28:55,380
I heard that. Yeah.

2273
01:28:55,380 --> 01:28:59,380
Yeah, she like she had to have her head shaved and then she had to prove her

2274
01:28:59,580 --> 01:29:04,540
loyalty and some of proving loyalty was, well, you make the wax heads for people

2275
01:29:04,740 --> 01:29:06,500
we've cut the heads off of.

2276
01:29:06,700 --> 01:29:07,700
Yes.

2277
01:29:07,900 --> 01:29:10,140
And then how so how that it's this like

2278
01:29:10,260 --> 01:29:12,380
Hollywood Boulevard, hey, kids, come see the stars.

2279
01:29:12,580 --> 01:29:16,300
And that this all stems somehow from this bizarre dark beheading era.

2280
01:29:16,500 --> 01:29:17,180
Yeah.

2281
01:29:17,380 --> 01:29:22,260
And then and then like Hollywood, the way she got out of it, it was like a friend

2282
01:29:22,460 --> 01:29:23,180
helped her out.

2283
01:29:23,380 --> 01:29:25,060
So it's not like it's

2284
01:29:25,940 --> 01:29:29,620
a friend getting you a gig, but it is a friend getting you out of jail so you

2285
01:29:29,820 --> 01:29:31,620
don't get beheaded.

2286
01:29:32,580 --> 01:29:33,420
Her hair.

2287
01:29:33,620 --> 01:29:35,940
Let me be an assistant on your show.

2288
01:29:36,140 --> 01:29:37,940
Work my way up.

2289
01:29:38,140 --> 01:29:43,500
The Knott's Berry Farm two years ago did a maze, a haunted maze called Wax Works

2290
01:29:43,700 --> 01:29:46,620
about an evil wax person.

2291
01:29:46,820 --> 01:29:49,340
And I was like, this is who she is, I think.

2292
01:29:49,540 --> 01:29:53,740
Like like there's no telling like what like what's real.

2293
01:29:53,740 --> 01:29:56,340
Probably in the old museum, like someone, this is real, you know?

2294
01:29:56,540 --> 01:29:56,940
Yeah.

2295
01:29:57,140 --> 01:30:00,100
Like I wonder like what they don't say.

2296
01:30:00,220 --> 01:30:01,980
I'm sure there's like a part of her history.

2297
01:30:01,980 --> 01:30:05,620
They don't they're not like telling in the museum to these kids and stuff.

2298
01:30:05,820 --> 01:30:09,980
Like at 3 a.m. she'd get the shovel and go to the graveyard.

2299
01:30:10,180 --> 01:30:12,140
She's obsessed with that.

2300
01:30:12,340 --> 01:30:13,020
Yeah.

2301
01:30:13,220 --> 01:30:16,980
Oh, she'd sleep in the coffin with one of them.

2302
01:30:18,100 --> 01:30:19,860
She had to take reference feels.

2303
01:30:19,860 --> 01:30:21,300
She couldn't take reference pictures.

2304
01:30:21,300 --> 01:30:22,140
Yes.

2305
01:30:22,340 --> 01:30:26,740
Her face had to rub up against their face for eight hours during sleep in a coffin

2306
01:30:26,940 --> 01:30:28,740
every night for a while.

2307
01:30:28,940 --> 01:30:30,980
Yeah. No, she's she's a great villain.

2308
01:30:31,180 --> 01:30:32,740
I mean, look, look at her.

2309
01:30:32,940 --> 01:30:35,500
No, no, no. My grandson is the Louie is the villain.

2310
01:30:35,500 --> 01:30:36,500
Let's be clear about this.

2311
01:30:36,500 --> 01:30:37,820
There could be two villains.

2312
01:30:38,020 --> 01:30:41,140
I'm sure Louie thinks that she's the villain.

2313
01:30:41,340 --> 01:30:42,180
They're the villain.

2314
01:30:42,180 --> 01:30:43,900
Like they're the evil corporate villain.

2315
01:30:44,100 --> 01:30:45,940
That'd be funny if he's just like a great guy.

2316
01:30:46,140 --> 01:30:49,100
Like I'm just totally brainwashed because I'm like, yeah,

2317
01:30:49,260 --> 01:30:50,460
you only heard it from the man.

2318
01:30:50,660 --> 01:30:53,260
I was just like, like you said, he's openly like he's just awesome.

2319
01:30:53,260 --> 01:30:56,020
He's like, you know, come in, drink it here and party like he's like, right.

2320
01:30:56,060 --> 01:30:58,020
Cool as hell. He was the real he was the good one.

2321
01:30:58,220 --> 01:31:00,260
Yeah. That's that was that's been there since the OG.

2322
01:31:00,460 --> 01:31:01,580
That's that's has not.

2323
01:31:01,780 --> 01:31:05,940
OK, this is this new Marvel room and maybe they aren't all new.

2324
01:31:06,140 --> 01:31:07,220
They write them together.

2325
01:31:07,420 --> 01:31:11,220
Is that wax technically? No, no, that's like not a wax figure.

2326
01:31:11,420 --> 01:31:13,620
I guess that's just like a statue of Spider-Man.

2327
01:31:13,620 --> 01:31:16,140
Yeah. Can I say one thing about Louie's before I forget?

2328
01:31:16,140 --> 01:31:17,500
I'm sorry to say his name one more time.

2329
01:31:17,500 --> 01:31:21,100
But one one more memory I had is that I went to the bathroom and I was like,

2330
01:31:21,300 --> 01:31:25,580
I walk in like this one's like I use the other stall and I'm like, is it occupied?

2331
01:31:25,780 --> 01:31:30,780
And then you go out and like, oh, that's a and you're you're risking a big scare

2332
01:31:30,780 --> 01:31:32,220
if it is if your hunch isn't right.

2333
01:31:32,420 --> 01:31:36,060
But there is just a wax figure permanently at one of the urinals.

2334
01:31:36,060 --> 01:31:37,060
Really? Yes.

2335
01:31:37,060 --> 01:31:39,860
So just occupying one of the better hope there aren't two people.

2336
01:31:40,060 --> 01:31:41,900
That is kind of maybe Louie's cool.

2337
01:31:41,900 --> 01:31:43,780
Like maybe that's like that.

2338
01:31:43,780 --> 01:31:45,700
There's nothing like that going on in here.

2339
01:31:45,700 --> 01:31:47,660
If you got an elevator and you say that,

2340
01:31:47,660 --> 01:31:50,380
you never do. But when I went into the bathroom here,

2341
01:31:50,580 --> 01:31:53,940
I was greeted with this massive sign that says have time to poo.

2342
01:31:54,140 --> 01:31:59,660
Then you have time to review, review us on Yelp and TripAdvisor.

2343
01:31:59,860 --> 01:32:04,500
And when you're missing a big deal or a big detail of the word poo,

2344
01:32:04,700 --> 01:32:07,300
which is that it is censored by poo emojis.

2345
01:32:07,500 --> 01:32:10,540
Oh, yes. To poo emoji instead of the who did that?

2346
01:32:10,540 --> 01:32:11,860
Was that that's that Madame Tussauds?

2347
01:32:11,860 --> 01:32:12,900
That's that Madame Tussauds.

2348
01:32:13,100 --> 01:32:14,620
And then the stalls.

2349
01:32:14,740 --> 01:32:16,540
I don't know if this was when you were there,

2350
01:32:16,540 --> 01:32:19,820
but the different stalls wanted a sign that said politician.

2351
01:32:20,020 --> 01:32:21,420
Yeah, we had that.

2352
01:32:21,620 --> 01:32:22,500
I thought that was cool.

2353
01:32:22,500 --> 01:32:24,020
Like, I would totally do that to it.

2354
01:32:24,020 --> 01:32:25,420
Like, I'm a politician today.

2355
01:32:25,420 --> 01:32:27,060
I'm going to be a politician when I take this shit.

2356
01:32:27,260 --> 01:32:30,260
That's fine. But yeah, that that sign I've never seen.

2357
01:32:30,460 --> 01:32:32,820
I want to know who is responsible for that.

2358
01:32:33,020 --> 01:32:35,020
Would that have flown during your administration?

2359
01:32:35,020 --> 01:32:37,940
That's insane. I would never let that happen.

2360
01:32:38,140 --> 01:32:40,180
Yeah, keep that shit classy.

2361
01:32:40,380 --> 01:32:43,020
I did not go. I should have gone to the bathroom.

2362
01:32:43,100 --> 01:32:43,940
We missed out.

2363
01:32:44,140 --> 01:32:46,340
Yeah. So they have like, OK, so yeah, they have full care.

2364
01:32:46,540 --> 01:32:47,500
Like, yeah, they did.

2365
01:32:47,700 --> 01:32:49,180
They were there now.

2366
01:32:49,380 --> 01:32:51,980
Samuel Jackson, Nick Fury looks pretty good, I think.

2367
01:32:52,180 --> 01:32:54,420
His his actor one is good, too.

2368
01:32:54,620 --> 01:32:56,940
I did YouTube face for this.

2369
01:32:57,140 --> 01:32:58,100
Yeah.

2370
01:32:58,300 --> 01:33:01,220
So that means you guys went into that theater in there.

2371
01:33:01,420 --> 01:33:02,940
Jason, I did the theater show.

2372
01:33:03,140 --> 01:33:04,820
OK, we should just do.

2373
01:33:05,020 --> 01:33:06,460
I could talk about the theater show.

2374
01:33:06,660 --> 01:33:07,420
I know.

2375
01:33:07,620 --> 01:33:09,340
Well, we can talk briefly about it.

2376
01:33:09,340 --> 01:33:10,300
Yeah.

2377
01:33:10,500 --> 01:33:11,940
Yeah, they're doing the Marvel Universe 40,

2378
01:33:11,940 --> 01:33:13,780
which seems like it's been around for a while and it's.

2379
01:33:13,980 --> 01:33:14,620
Yeah, I opened it.

2380
01:33:14,820 --> 01:33:17,140
I had I was there when we were like,

2381
01:33:17,340 --> 01:33:19,260
I was in charge of the opening for that.

2382
01:33:19,460 --> 01:33:20,580
Yeah, it was very fun.

2383
01:33:20,780 --> 01:33:26,300
And the premise is that the Marvel heroes are at Madame Tussauds and they're opening

2384
01:33:26,500 --> 01:33:29,260
there, they're seeing new wax figures of themselves.

2385
01:33:29,260 --> 01:33:30,220
Right. That's the.

2386
01:33:30,420 --> 01:33:31,060
That's different.

2387
01:33:31,260 --> 01:33:33,980
They said the actual movie you're watching is that's what's happening.

2388
01:33:34,180 --> 01:33:35,780
The plot. Oh, yeah, we didn't.

2389
01:33:35,980 --> 01:33:38,300
Yeah, it wasn't like it was more of a

2390
01:33:38,500 --> 01:33:39,500
there wasn't.

2391
01:33:39,700 --> 01:33:41,340
Yeah, yeah.

2392
01:33:41,420 --> 01:33:43,700
And it smelled like burnt pizza in there.

2393
01:33:43,900 --> 01:33:45,220
Yeah, it did smell.

2394
01:33:45,420 --> 01:33:47,100
They fired off the water effects.

2395
01:33:47,300 --> 01:33:48,300
It smelled like burning.

2396
01:33:48,500 --> 01:33:49,980
They shot water at us.

2397
01:33:50,180 --> 01:33:53,740
And every time it was as if the water was burned.

2398
01:33:53,940 --> 01:33:54,940
That's so funny.

2399
01:33:55,140 --> 01:33:58,180
Like 40 theories are hilarious because you like if you don't do it right, they're

2400
01:33:58,380 --> 01:34:00,460
just annoying. Like, did they have that?

2401
01:34:00,660 --> 01:34:04,500
They had this thing that was like just a stick that was coming out of the sea

2402
01:34:04,700 --> 01:34:05,820
poking you in the back.

2403
01:34:06,020 --> 01:34:10,100
Sure did. They did it once and everyone went, oh, yeah,

2404
01:34:10,820 --> 01:34:13,340
because it didn't happen again.

2405
01:34:13,540 --> 01:34:14,940
And it was so forceful.

2406
01:34:15,140 --> 01:34:16,580
You can see a hole, too.

2407
01:34:16,780 --> 01:34:18,220
I mean, I lean forward.

2408
01:34:18,220 --> 01:34:19,380
I don't want to deal with that shit.

2409
01:34:19,580 --> 01:34:21,220
Yeah, it's so disrespectful.

2410
01:34:21,420 --> 01:34:22,780
Why is this part of it?

2411
01:34:22,980 --> 01:34:27,100
Then the under the chair, they did the like, you know, a bunch of things run

2412
01:34:27,300 --> 01:34:28,140
under you. Yeah.

2413
01:34:28,340 --> 01:34:30,900
So they're like whipping things at you.

2414
01:34:31,100 --> 01:34:33,380
And but that effect was going for a while.

2415
01:34:33,580 --> 01:34:36,060
Well, that's like for too long.

2416
01:34:36,260 --> 01:34:38,340
My legacy.

2417
01:34:38,500 --> 01:34:42,580
The water, though, you got shot three times with water for different parts

2418
01:34:42,780 --> 01:34:45,620
where like a bad guy blew up or whatever.

2419
01:34:45,820 --> 01:34:51,060
And each time it was more unpleasant than the last and smelled awful.

2420
01:34:51,260 --> 01:34:52,460
Yeah, it's a weird smell.

2421
01:34:52,660 --> 01:34:53,500
I remember that.

2422
01:34:53,500 --> 01:34:55,140
We didn't. I was surprised I never fixed that.

2423
01:34:55,340 --> 01:34:57,940
And they told me at the front, I said, how often does this run?

2424
01:34:57,940 --> 01:34:59,140
And they said every 10 minutes.

2425
01:34:59,340 --> 01:35:05,140
And I think the reality is it runs any time someone walks up and asks for it.

2426
01:35:05,340 --> 01:35:06,580
One or two parties.

2427
01:35:06,780 --> 01:35:07,620
That's funny.

2428
01:35:07,780 --> 01:35:10,180
We had like 20 people in the theater.

2429
01:35:10,380 --> 01:35:11,380
Oh, yeah.

2430
01:35:11,580 --> 01:35:14,300
Really? And a family of three

2431
01:35:14,500 --> 01:35:15,260
all together.

2432
01:35:15,260 --> 01:35:16,460
And you sat next to each other.

2433
01:35:16,660 --> 01:35:20,260
Was it busy? Like, I mean, I guess since COVID, it seemed like they're doing OK.

2434
01:35:20,260 --> 01:35:24,460
I was like actually literally concerned about when I started the when I started

2435
01:35:24,660 --> 01:35:27,300
on that the first room, there wasn't that many people.

2436
01:35:27,500 --> 01:35:31,620
But I think I was taking my sweet time that a lot of people caught up to me.

2437
01:35:31,820 --> 01:35:34,420
So then by the time it was Hollywood room, there were a lot of people.

2438
01:35:34,420 --> 01:35:35,380
There were a lot of people jockeying

2439
01:35:35,380 --> 01:35:39,380
for position for like the grease lighting photo with John Travolta.

2440
01:35:39,580 --> 01:35:42,060
So, yeah, not so bad.

2441
01:35:42,260 --> 01:35:43,820
It's disappointing to hear about the theater.

2442
01:35:44,020 --> 01:35:46,140
Because we always have problems when I open it.

2443
01:35:46,340 --> 01:35:49,420
It was like it was like, oh, it was going to be the coolest thing.

2444
01:35:49,620 --> 01:35:51,860
And then it just never worked well.

2445
01:35:52,060 --> 01:35:56,380
Like I never fully was like the thing that was supposed to be.

2446
01:35:56,580 --> 01:35:57,060
Yeah.

2447
01:35:57,260 --> 01:35:59,060
But that was like six years ago.

2448
01:35:59,260 --> 01:36:01,660
I was surprised I was surprised I have not fixed.

2449
01:36:01,860 --> 01:36:03,260
It sounds like it's just there now.

2450
01:36:03,460 --> 01:36:05,020
It sounds like people don't they don't really.

2451
01:36:05,060 --> 01:36:09,420
Was the video in the movie they like they're they get attacked by Loki at the

2452
01:36:09,620 --> 01:36:12,300
at Madame Tussauds, he infiltrates Madame Tussauds.

2453
01:36:12,500 --> 01:36:15,140
That's where they fight like Loki rock monsters.

2454
01:36:15,340 --> 01:36:19,860
And then they spill out onto Hollywood Boulevard and there's this big like squid

2455
01:36:20,060 --> 01:36:23,100
monster that's like hovering above Hollywood Boulevard.

2456
01:36:23,100 --> 01:36:24,420
And they're fighting all the Avengers,

2457
01:36:24,420 --> 01:36:26,180
like show up eventually and they're fighting it.

2458
01:36:26,380 --> 01:36:26,900
Wow.

2459
01:36:27,100 --> 01:36:31,820
They got you know, you got Chris Evans and well, Danny Jr.

2460
01:36:32,020 --> 01:36:34,620
Well, I don't know.

2461
01:36:34,860 --> 01:36:36,220
Rocket Raccoon was there, too.

2462
01:36:36,420 --> 01:36:37,940
I don't know that it was Bradley Cooper, though.

2463
01:36:38,140 --> 01:36:39,020
I don't know.

2464
01:36:39,220 --> 01:36:41,540
But yeah, it was not.

2465
01:36:41,740 --> 01:36:44,060
I don't know. That's not really what I want from this place.

2466
01:36:44,260 --> 01:36:45,780
Yeah, it's it's it's off.

2467
01:36:45,780 --> 01:36:46,940
It felt like it was.

2468
01:36:47,140 --> 01:36:49,020
I remember it clearly because it was I

2469
01:36:49,020 --> 01:36:53,820
remember not wanting to do it because I was like, OK, they we we were just not

2470
01:36:53,820 --> 01:36:55,940
doing well. We like we needed something.

2471
01:36:56,140 --> 01:37:00,340
And it was like they were like this is we needed to like have something to market.

2472
01:37:00,540 --> 01:37:03,500
So I remember them like being like throwing it on me.

2473
01:37:03,580 --> 01:37:05,020
And it's another one of my friends,

2474
01:37:05,220 --> 01:37:09,180
Pini, who's another manager who's like an Israeli army.

2475
01:37:09,380 --> 01:37:12,420
It was like it was like this ex Israeli army guy.

2476
01:37:12,420 --> 01:37:14,380
And he was just like one of the other managers.

2477
01:37:14,580 --> 01:37:16,180
And he was like, all right, Lamar, Pini,

2478
01:37:16,180 --> 01:37:18,260
you guys, you guys are going to run this thing.

2479
01:37:18,460 --> 01:37:23,100
And it just felt like they just dumped this like pile of shit on it.

2480
01:37:23,780 --> 01:37:24,780
It's like, oh, man.

2481
01:37:24,980 --> 01:37:26,500
But yeah, it feels off.

2482
01:37:26,700 --> 01:37:29,740
Like it feels off of the the main aesthetic.

2483
01:37:29,940 --> 01:37:31,620
You're there. You're there for the wax.

2484
01:37:31,620 --> 01:37:32,820
You're there for the wax.

2485
01:37:32,820 --> 01:37:34,260
Guys, we want more wax.

2486
01:37:34,460 --> 01:37:38,300
Even the Marvel Room feels underwhelming after what you've just seen.

2487
01:37:38,500 --> 01:37:41,220
And I was excited, like, oh, cool, because I like all that crap.

2488
01:37:41,220 --> 01:37:42,140
So I was like, oh, great.

2489
01:37:42,140 --> 01:37:42,860
I'll take a photo.

2490
01:37:43,060 --> 01:37:45,660
And it's like, this is sort of this is anticlimactic.

2491
01:37:45,860 --> 01:37:46,580
Like climactic.

2492
01:37:46,780 --> 01:37:49,980
It is because it's so much like the exit hallway.

2493
01:37:50,180 --> 01:37:53,700
Like there's a giant sign that says exit, like next to Robert Downey Jr.

2494
01:37:53,900 --> 01:37:56,460
Yeah, exit past Robert Downey.

2495
01:37:56,660 --> 01:37:57,340
Yeah, exit.

2496
01:37:57,540 --> 01:37:59,300
That's what employees were like.

2497
01:37:59,500 --> 01:38:01,340
You exit past Tony Stark.

2498
01:38:01,500 --> 01:38:02,940
I was like, OK, that's it.

2499
01:38:03,140 --> 01:38:05,140
Well, I had to ask, like, where is the theater?

2500
01:38:05,140 --> 01:38:06,700
Like, just follow the exit signs.

2501
01:38:06,900 --> 01:38:07,820
I was like, OK.

2502
01:38:08,020 --> 01:38:09,420
Tony Stark, Tony Stark.

2503
01:38:09,620 --> 01:38:10,900
He's just a he's a sign.

2504
01:38:11,100 --> 01:38:12,020
He's a trash can.

2505
01:38:12,220 --> 01:38:14,060
Yeah, he's basically like directing traffic.

2506
01:38:14,060 --> 01:38:15,340
Yeah, the way he's his hands are.

2507
01:38:15,540 --> 01:38:18,940
He looks more like almost like Eric McCormick or something.

2508
01:38:19,140 --> 01:38:22,260
Yeah, I think they I think they got to stay away from characters.

2509
01:38:22,260 --> 01:38:23,980
I think it's got to be real people.

2510
01:38:23,980 --> 01:38:25,340
That's the thing they do.

2511
01:38:25,380 --> 01:38:26,300
It's the bread and butter.

2512
01:38:26,300 --> 01:38:30,420
Was there one that people like you felt like complaints about when like it was

2513
01:38:30,420 --> 01:38:34,300
everyone that was retired, not for some Matt Lauer reason, but for like just.

2514
01:38:34,500 --> 01:38:34,980
Oh, yeah.

2515
01:38:35,180 --> 01:38:38,660
Shakira Shakira was she's I mean, wonderful performance,

2516
01:38:38,860 --> 01:38:41,460
but like her wax figure was just did not look like her.

2517
01:38:41,660 --> 01:38:43,060
She was back. They had her.

2518
01:38:43,260 --> 01:38:44,980
They had her back. Maybe they fixed her up.

2519
01:38:45,180 --> 01:38:46,340
I like a picture of her.

2520
01:38:46,540 --> 01:38:48,340
But I remember it being a thing where we

2521
01:38:48,340 --> 01:38:51,500
were getting way too many complaints about this wax figure.

2522
01:38:51,700 --> 01:38:54,020
And they took her off the floor.

2523
01:38:54,220 --> 01:38:57,980
But I was really happy to see they had Selena there because I was

2524
01:38:58,180 --> 01:39:02,580
that was a big deal, like because we had a lot of Latinx employees and they

2525
01:39:02,780 --> 01:39:07,060
constantly were like, we want her as a figure and it never happened.

2526
01:39:07,060 --> 01:39:08,900
I was like, oh, shit, they actually ended up doing it.

2527
01:39:09,100 --> 01:39:11,700
She's got her own little like wall, like a video wall.

2528
01:39:11,700 --> 01:39:12,620
That's very yeah.

2529
01:39:12,620 --> 01:39:14,180
Definitely is like a big old trip.

2530
01:39:14,380 --> 01:39:19,780
There was one that I was I'm thinking like they would change something about.

2531
01:39:19,980 --> 01:39:26,620
I think it's in the 90s area, which is the Britney Spears one is it's her outfit.

2532
01:39:26,620 --> 01:39:31,580
And like this, like, you know, the set of the You Drive Me Crazy video.

2533
01:39:31,780 --> 01:39:35,220
Right. But that presentation is just a Britney Spears wax figure.

2534
01:39:35,420 --> 01:39:36,540
It's just crazy.

2535
01:39:36,740 --> 01:39:37,580
Are you kidding me?

2536
01:39:37,780 --> 01:39:41,220
And this giant sign is in the video, something like this.

2537
01:39:41,420 --> 01:39:43,300
But it's like, oh, maybe turn the sign off

2538
01:39:43,300 --> 01:39:45,860
for a little while with the current events going on.

2539
01:39:46,060 --> 01:39:47,980
Her dad requested it.

2540
01:39:48,180 --> 01:39:49,740
He masterminded it.

2541
01:39:49,940 --> 01:39:54,020
So that is not the Shakira that I think that's the Shakira from Vegas, which is

2542
01:39:54,060 --> 01:39:55,620
better. And they brought it over.

2543
01:39:55,620 --> 01:39:57,820
But that's not the one that people complained about.

2544
01:39:57,820 --> 01:39:59,540
Yeah. So she looks way better.

2545
01:39:59,740 --> 01:40:02,380
Mike, respectful distance from Shakira.

2546
01:40:02,580 --> 01:40:04,260
Thank you for being a gentleman.

2547
01:40:04,460 --> 01:40:06,380
This guy, that was a big deal.

2548
01:40:06,380 --> 01:40:07,580
I'll never forget that launch.

2549
01:40:07,780 --> 01:40:11,340
That was like, like lit, like we had it was like a party.

2550
01:40:11,380 --> 01:40:14,140
It was like pack because it was just everybody wanted to see it.

2551
01:40:14,140 --> 01:40:17,460
And it was like they have this thing where they have a button.

2552
01:40:17,660 --> 01:40:22,140
And it's like a countdown, like five, five, three, four, three, two.

2553
01:40:22,180 --> 01:40:25,100
And it goes and then it was like, baby, whatever.

2554
01:40:25,100 --> 01:40:26,860
And it was just like, it was so dope.

2555
01:40:26,860 --> 01:40:28,020
And the confetti is going.

2556
01:40:28,220 --> 01:40:29,060
I was like, what?

2557
01:40:29,260 --> 01:40:31,220
Lady Gaga is on point right now.

2558
01:40:31,420 --> 01:40:33,100
They do a reveal ceremony.

2559
01:40:33,300 --> 01:40:36,180
That every time there's a new one, they do that.

2560
01:40:36,380 --> 01:40:38,940
Wow. Yeah, I feel like we've been going a little while.

2561
01:40:38,940 --> 01:40:40,340
Is there is there something we can close?

2562
01:40:40,340 --> 01:40:42,020
Is there anything you haven't told us anyway?

2563
01:40:42,220 --> 01:40:45,460
Like any of the final crazy details?

2564
01:40:45,660 --> 01:40:46,620
I'm trying to think.

2565
01:40:46,820 --> 01:40:50,500
I mean, I feel like, yeah, there's so much.

2566
01:40:50,660 --> 01:40:54,500
I mean, I can't think of anything else off top of my head.

2567
01:40:54,700 --> 01:40:55,420
It's great.

2568
01:40:55,620 --> 01:40:57,700
Yeah, Tupac Snoop was one of my favorites.

2569
01:40:57,900 --> 01:41:01,300
Where's the I'm looking for the suddenly Michael Jackson?

2570
01:41:01,500 --> 01:41:06,100
Oh, the Michael Jackson thing was really cool because it was they had this room

2571
01:41:06,100 --> 01:41:08,780
that we did that was like it was all stages of him.

2572
01:41:08,980 --> 01:41:13,460
So you see him like when he's like a little kid with the Afro and then he's like,

2573
01:41:13,660 --> 01:41:17,220
you know, doing Thriller and then he just seemed like, wait, what happened?

2574
01:41:17,220 --> 01:41:17,940
And he's like, what?

2575
01:41:17,940 --> 01:41:18,860
He's like full crazy.

2576
01:41:18,900 --> 01:41:21,900
Like it's like a weird you get to kind of see him through time,

2577
01:41:22,100 --> 01:41:23,460
which is like a very cool role.

2578
01:41:23,660 --> 01:41:26,420
Now they just have his the scary.

2579
01:41:26,620 --> 01:41:28,500
I know it's just kind of scary.

2580
01:41:28,700 --> 01:41:29,740
Yeah.

2581
01:41:29,940 --> 01:41:33,580
I in that in that case, let me ask a question.

2582
01:41:33,780 --> 01:41:37,100
And you're just to see if you can I'll make this a little bigger because I was

2583
01:41:37,100 --> 01:41:41,100
looking at some of the odd or wax figures and this this I believe is from this is

2584
01:41:41,300 --> 01:41:44,420
from Louis world, this is not the mad am I'm going to show you a picture.

2585
01:41:44,420 --> 01:41:46,060
One is a real guy taking a selfie.

2586
01:41:46,260 --> 01:41:51,940
There's also a very odd short Jimmy Fallon, who has kind of like regis energy.

2587
01:41:52,140 --> 01:41:52,900
Right.

2588
01:41:53,100 --> 01:41:57,780
And genuinely here, I'll show you if you know it, don't say it.

2589
01:41:57,980 --> 01:41:59,340
And I don't know it genuinely.

2590
01:41:59,460 --> 01:42:00,780
Who is the guy on the left?

2591
01:42:00,780 --> 01:42:01,900
Just look at him for a minute.

2592
01:42:02,100 --> 01:42:03,700
Just hold it. I want to give everybody a chance.

2593
01:42:03,900 --> 01:42:05,100
I truly don't know.

2594
01:42:05,300 --> 01:42:09,580
Does it is am I am I crazy to not know who he looks like?

2595
01:42:09,780 --> 01:42:11,380
Like a leather jacket guy,

2596
01:42:11,580 --> 01:42:15,100
Daniel Radcliffe and someone had a child.

2597
01:42:15,220 --> 01:42:17,940
Yeah, like Dan Radcliffe, Timberlake or something.

2598
01:42:17,940 --> 01:42:18,780
Justin Timberlake.

2599
01:42:18,980 --> 01:42:21,460
Oh, maybe it's can I see it one more time?

2600
01:42:21,660 --> 01:42:23,180
That might be right.

2601
01:42:23,380 --> 01:42:26,100
He's but he's got like it's not a mode of Timberlake.

2602
01:42:26,100 --> 01:42:27,580
I guess I've seen him look like this,

2603
01:42:27,780 --> 01:42:31,100
but he's sort of like Robin Thicke, except for the face.

2604
01:42:31,100 --> 01:42:32,540
Yeah, it's more the Robin Thicke.

2605
01:42:32,740 --> 01:42:36,220
Lance Bass and Daniel Radcliffe together.

2606
01:42:36,420 --> 01:42:37,860
I mean, that's what you get to do.

2607
01:42:38,060 --> 01:42:42,380
That plaques doing a lot of heavy lifting if there's if we're doing a mutant.

2608
01:42:42,460 --> 01:42:44,260
They're doing murder in that.

2609
01:42:44,460 --> 01:42:46,340
Like those two figures next to each other.

2610
01:42:46,340 --> 01:42:47,660
Could be because they're together.

2611
01:42:47,660 --> 01:42:48,660
They have a bromance.

2612
01:42:48,660 --> 01:42:50,300
It could be Justin and Jimmy.

2613
01:42:50,300 --> 01:42:53,140
That's definitely Conor McGregor taking the selfie of himself.

2614
01:42:53,340 --> 01:42:54,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2615
01:42:54,540 --> 01:42:56,140
It's the real Conor McGregor.

2616
01:42:56,340 --> 01:42:57,740
We're on right now.

2617
01:42:57,940 --> 01:43:00,340
I just you know, I'll put this to the listener too.

2618
01:43:00,340 --> 01:43:03,180
I feel like I have one more of the oh here.

2619
01:43:03,380 --> 01:43:04,700
Who are we looking at?

2620
01:43:04,900 --> 01:43:07,580
Who is this? This one might be a madam.

2621
01:43:07,780 --> 01:43:10,660
Is that this is a this is like a blonde.

2622
01:43:10,820 --> 01:43:13,340
Is that a blue or is that a fancy size?

2623
01:43:13,540 --> 01:43:17,660
I think this might be because you got red signs back there unless they're he stole

2624
01:43:17,860 --> 01:43:20,340
the sign vibe and let me see one more time.

2625
01:43:20,540 --> 01:43:22,820
This one I do know that's.

2626
01:43:23,020 --> 01:43:24,340
I think I have a guess.

2627
01:43:24,540 --> 01:43:27,940
What is that? I think it's is a blonde Lindsay Lohan.

2628
01:43:27,940 --> 01:43:29,020
You got it. You got it.

2629
01:43:29,220 --> 01:43:32,260
It is so hard to guess, right?

2630
01:43:32,460 --> 01:43:35,940
Like and very like Amy Poehler in a wig.

2631
01:43:36,140 --> 01:43:37,140
Oh, I see it. Yeah.

2632
01:43:37,140 --> 01:43:38,340
Yeah. I had to think about it.

2633
01:43:38,340 --> 01:43:42,540
Almost because I thought for a second is like is it blonde Emma Stone?

2634
01:43:42,740 --> 01:43:44,900
Like, no, I think it is.

2635
01:43:45,100 --> 01:43:46,740
Yeah, Lindsay Lohan. Yeah.

2636
01:43:46,940 --> 01:43:48,900
Oh, here. Yeah. One more while we're doing it.

2637
01:43:49,100 --> 01:43:50,380
Who are we looking at?

2638
01:43:50,580 --> 01:43:53,900
Kind of short hair, short woman in leather jacket.

2639
01:43:54,100 --> 01:43:58,180
She looks like somebody from old Hollywood, but they dressed her up in modern.

2640
01:43:58,380 --> 01:43:59,740
Yeah, they time traveled her.

2641
01:43:59,940 --> 01:44:01,780
Isabella Rossellini.

2642
01:44:01,980 --> 01:44:04,620
No, I like the guess.

2643
01:44:04,820 --> 01:44:05,660
Any idea?

2644
01:44:05,820 --> 01:44:07,780
Like who plays?

2645
01:44:07,980 --> 01:44:09,860
It looks like a Tarot.

2646
01:44:10,060 --> 01:44:10,500
You know what?

2647
01:44:10,700 --> 01:44:14,700
That was like a young Glenn Close, like a younger version of Glenn Close.

2648
01:44:14,900 --> 01:44:16,380
Oh, yeah. Yeah. I could see that.

2649
01:44:16,580 --> 01:44:20,020
This is if I zoomed it out, you would see her next to her husband.

2650
01:44:20,220 --> 01:44:23,100
This is supposed to be Victoria Beckham.

2651
01:44:23,300 --> 01:44:24,100
Yeah.

2652
01:44:24,300 --> 01:44:25,180
Yeah. They change.

2653
01:44:25,180 --> 01:44:26,620
They probably change their outfits.

2654
01:44:26,820 --> 01:44:28,380
This is this one's credit.

2655
01:44:28,580 --> 01:44:31,060
This is not this is not the madam for sure.

2656
01:44:31,260 --> 01:44:32,220
This one is not.

2657
01:44:32,420 --> 01:44:33,580
Madam wouldn't screw it up that bad.

2658
01:44:33,780 --> 01:44:35,500
Yeah. No, that is awful.

2659
01:44:35,700 --> 01:44:36,700
Yeah.

2660
01:44:36,900 --> 01:44:39,340
Well, I'll post these people do their own guessing games.

2661
01:44:39,540 --> 01:44:42,940
But with that, I mean, like we just got to thank you.

2662
01:44:42,940 --> 01:44:43,900
We all had a great time.

2663
01:44:44,100 --> 01:44:45,300
This opens so much irony.

2664
01:44:45,300 --> 01:44:46,260
You just melted away.

2665
01:44:46,260 --> 01:44:47,540
We're just there having a blast.

2666
01:44:47,740 --> 01:44:50,780
This opens up a rich vein of different experiences.

2667
01:44:50,780 --> 01:44:53,860
Now we will be covering on the podcast, too, because there's videos.

2668
01:44:54,060 --> 01:44:58,380
I was looking through old Madame Tussauds videos from England 30 years ago.

2669
01:44:58,580 --> 01:45:00,940
And it's like Dudley Moore,

2670
01:45:01,140 --> 01:45:02,380
Benny Hill.

2671
01:45:02,580 --> 01:45:05,500
And I'm like, we got to cover all of this.

2672
01:45:05,700 --> 01:45:06,620
Yeah, eventually.

2673
01:45:06,820 --> 01:45:07,900
So thank you.

2674
01:45:08,100 --> 01:45:09,300
Thank you. It was real fun.

2675
01:45:09,500 --> 01:45:11,660
I was because I was thinking about

2676
01:45:11,860 --> 01:45:16,140
because my ex, who were still close, but we used to work together.

2677
01:45:16,340 --> 01:45:19,780
So we were just talking about like who's still there and stuff.

2678
01:45:19,980 --> 01:45:23,140
So it's cool to kind of reminisce on that shit.

2679
01:45:23,340 --> 01:45:24,380
It was a vibe. Yeah.

2680
01:45:24,580 --> 01:45:25,500
It was a lifetime.

2681
01:45:25,700 --> 01:45:27,740
But thank you so much for your stories and everything.

2682
01:45:27,740 --> 01:45:28,500
That was such a blast.

2683
01:45:28,700 --> 01:45:30,620
The Marwood's You Survive podcast, The Ride.

2684
01:45:30,820 --> 01:45:31,340
Thank you.

2685
01:45:31,540 --> 01:45:35,060
Just like the very much like the this experience.

2686
01:45:35,060 --> 01:45:36,500
We got to exit through the gift shop.

2687
01:45:36,700 --> 01:45:37,980
What a gift shop.

2688
01:45:38,180 --> 01:45:39,300
By the way, yes.

2689
01:45:39,500 --> 01:45:43,380
One of the more one of the we were, I mean, that boy, we're with a baby.

2690
01:45:43,580 --> 01:45:46,300
We're like, how fast can we possibly get back?

2691
01:45:46,500 --> 01:45:51,180
Because even like a brief walk down Hollywood Boulevard, like a, you know,

2692
01:45:51,380 --> 01:45:56,740
not even the full block, maybe feel like a bad parent, even having a small child

2693
01:45:56,940 --> 01:45:58,620
protected by both parents.

2694
01:45:58,820 --> 01:46:01,820
This is like, how fast can we can we sprint with this stroller?

2695
01:46:01,900 --> 01:46:05,020
We run over an Elmo's foot or something as we do.

2696
01:46:05,140 --> 01:46:07,700
Doesn't matter. That's it's overstimulating.

2697
01:46:07,900 --> 01:46:09,820
It's like this is the big candy stuff in there.

2698
01:46:10,020 --> 01:46:14,340
Like it's sugar. They got rid of OK, there's a whole other episode.

2699
01:46:14,540 --> 01:46:16,540
But there were like for a couple of years ago.

2700
01:46:16,740 --> 01:46:20,180
Remember, there were like multiple can't there's a giant candy store,

2701
01:46:20,380 --> 01:46:22,500
not just sugar, which was on Hollywood Boulevard.

2702
01:46:22,700 --> 01:46:26,060
There were multiple like on that second level when you went up the escalator.

2703
01:46:26,260 --> 01:46:27,180
There were those rooms.

2704
01:46:27,180 --> 01:46:29,820
There was a big state of Marshmallow and this one.

2705
01:46:29,860 --> 01:46:30,780
What the hell was that?

2706
01:46:30,980 --> 01:46:32,460
I can't remember what it was called.

2707
01:46:32,660 --> 01:46:33,460
It's all gone.

2708
01:46:33,660 --> 01:46:35,580
It was a giant multiple rooms.

2709
01:46:35,580 --> 01:46:37,740
Then we would go back the next time in one room and be closed.

2710
01:46:37,940 --> 01:46:40,100
You go in the next time and another room would be closed.

2711
01:46:40,100 --> 01:46:41,220
And now it's just gone.

2712
01:46:41,420 --> 01:46:42,780
The Randy's Donuts was gone.

2713
01:46:42,980 --> 01:46:45,340
There was a Randy's Donuts for a little while.

2714
01:46:45,540 --> 01:46:48,420
Like the big, you know, they have the big sign.

2715
01:46:48,620 --> 01:46:52,180
And so there was one and that has already flipped to edible cookie dough.

2716
01:46:52,380 --> 01:46:54,740
Wow. So edible cookie dough is there.

2717
01:46:54,940 --> 01:46:55,980
Yes. Times change.

2718
01:46:56,180 --> 01:46:58,220
I bet that's. Yeah, I bet it's so different there.

2719
01:46:58,300 --> 01:46:59,780
There's a ten dollar store there.

2720
01:46:59,980 --> 01:47:01,180
There was like a ten dollar.

2721
01:47:01,380 --> 01:47:03,460
The gift shop is connected with the ten dollar.

2722
01:47:03,660 --> 01:47:05,700
Oh, I guess that's the same place we get exit.

2723
01:47:05,700 --> 01:47:06,460
We exit, right?

2724
01:47:06,460 --> 01:47:07,740
The gift shop you exit into.

2725
01:47:07,740 --> 01:47:09,820
They were like, all right, and show us your baskets.

2726
01:47:10,020 --> 01:47:12,500
If you're buying four things, you get a fifth free.

2727
01:47:12,700 --> 01:47:13,300
Like, oh, yeah.

2728
01:47:13,500 --> 01:47:14,980
Everything was marked down.

2729
01:47:15,180 --> 01:47:16,660
Like, yeah, that's not, madam.

2730
01:47:16,860 --> 01:47:18,380
So but what happened was they.

2731
01:47:18,580 --> 01:47:21,780
So that was like a store that we basically leased space to.

2732
01:47:21,980 --> 01:47:23,380
But that's so interesting.

2733
01:47:23,580 --> 01:47:27,060
Like brand wise, it's confusing because it probably feels like it's part of the same

2734
01:47:27,100 --> 01:47:29,180
thing, but it is like a different thing.

2735
01:47:29,380 --> 01:47:30,380
I could tell you could tell it.

2736
01:47:30,580 --> 01:47:32,660
It's like the like this stuff.

2737
01:47:32,860 --> 01:47:36,420
But this is like this shit is like it's chaos.

2738
01:47:36,620 --> 01:47:40,260
Like, yeah, claustrophobic room I've been in since the pandemic.

2739
01:47:40,460 --> 01:47:44,580
I think chaos things of that of that play.

2740
01:47:44,780 --> 01:47:46,140
The owner is such a character.

2741
01:47:46,340 --> 01:47:49,820
He's like a very like, you know, like Donald Don Jr.

2742
01:47:50,020 --> 01:47:53,900
It kind of looks like, hey, man, everything's ten dollars.

2743
01:47:53,900 --> 01:47:54,900
You want something from the store?

2744
01:47:54,900 --> 01:47:56,060
Let me get you some from the store.

2745
01:47:56,060 --> 01:47:57,500
Come on, take somebody to change it.

2746
01:47:57,500 --> 01:47:58,820
Go home like yourself.

2747
01:47:58,820 --> 01:48:01,420
You know, he's like fast talking like he drives like a convertible.

2748
01:48:01,620 --> 01:48:04,620
Always has like a like a girl who's like way too young for him.

2749
01:48:04,820 --> 01:48:06,940
Like, it's just so it's ridiculous.

2750
01:48:07,140 --> 01:48:09,340
But but yeah, no, yeah.

2751
01:48:09,540 --> 01:48:10,660
What a life. Well, let's all right.

2752
01:48:10,860 --> 01:48:15,420
So let's exit our less icky gift shop because it's about what you have going on.

2753
01:48:15,620 --> 01:48:16,980
Is there anything you would like to plug?

2754
01:48:17,180 --> 01:48:17,940
Oh, yeah.

2755
01:48:18,140 --> 01:48:21,420
So check out Grand Cru coming out next year.

2756
01:48:21,620 --> 01:48:25,940
It's starring Carl Tarr and my boy Phil, who's one of my closest friends.

2757
01:48:26,140 --> 01:48:27,820
It's his show and I'm writing on it.

2758
01:48:27,820 --> 01:48:28,900
I'm having a great time.

2759
01:48:29,100 --> 01:48:32,740
I'm about to drop an album called Wine Bars.

2760
01:48:32,940 --> 01:48:34,220
It's coming out August 6.

2761
01:48:34,420 --> 01:48:35,620
It's going to be fire.

2762
01:48:35,820 --> 01:48:36,860
It's super romantic.

2763
01:48:37,060 --> 01:48:40,780
It's basically imagine a hip hop album that you could play in a wine bar.

2764
01:48:40,980 --> 01:48:42,060
That's what it sounds like.

2765
01:48:42,260 --> 01:48:43,660
It's a vibe. It's lifestyle.

2766
01:48:43,860 --> 01:48:46,500
Shout out to Villa Vibes, the label, DSO, the crew.

2767
01:48:46,700 --> 01:48:49,540
And hopefully white women will, you know,

2768
01:48:49,740 --> 01:48:52,500
I don't know when we're going to get fully back in the improv space,

2769
01:48:52,500 --> 01:48:53,940
but hopefully we'll start performing soon.

2770
01:48:53,940 --> 01:48:55,380
You did a show a couple of days ago.

2771
01:48:55,380 --> 01:49:02,180
Yeah, we did one up in a studio stage over in I think it was over in East

2772
01:49:02,180 --> 01:49:06,060
Hollywood, but that was the first show we've done since like the world shut down.

2773
01:49:06,260 --> 01:49:07,220
That was super fun.

2774
01:49:07,420 --> 01:49:09,860
And so I was like, oh, it was like right back to normal.

2775
01:49:09,860 --> 01:49:11,220
Like it like nothing had changed.

2776
01:49:11,420 --> 01:49:16,220
So I think we're going to try to get a big show going or something soon.

2777
01:49:16,220 --> 01:49:17,780
So look out for that. Yeah, cool.

2778
01:49:17,980 --> 01:49:21,300
And you'll be out on Hollywood Boulevard passing the record.

2779
01:49:21,500 --> 01:49:24,540
Yeah, yeah, I will be selling it on the street.

2780
01:49:24,700 --> 01:49:27,140
That's how I get my music out.

2781
01:49:27,340 --> 01:49:29,860
Bothering a lot of wax figure employees.

2782
01:49:30,060 --> 01:49:31,660
Oh yeah, but it will be like spot.

2783
01:49:31,860 --> 01:49:34,860
It will be actually on Spotify and all the platforms and all that.

It's super funny.

2791
01:49:52,300 --> 01:49:53,860
It's an indie movie I made a while back,

2792
01:49:53,860 --> 01:49:55,780
but it's still relevant and funny.

2793
