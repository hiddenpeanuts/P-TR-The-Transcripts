1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,840
Hey folks Michael here just want to give you a quick heads up

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:09,640
We did record some video of this epic battle of Nick Weiger and I playing Disney's Lorcan a collectible card game

3
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:15,700
So if you want to see that it is live right now on the patreon the video is fine

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,280
It's a little bit far away

5
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:23,360
But you can kind of see the cards and you can see us turning the cards and putting things in a discard pile

6
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:31,760
So about minute 40 into the audio of this podcast you can switch over to that video and see us playing live

7
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,180
There were a few problems. I did not clear enough space on my phone

8
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:41,520
So there are a couple chunks where the video is missing, but in that section

9
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:47,400
I've just put up a picture of the sexy Robin Hood from the 70s cartoon. It's a new picture. He looks very

10
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,960
Good. He looks very sexy

11
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:56,920
So if you want you can switch over when you're listening to the audio at about minute 40 or so to the video and you

12
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:02,920
Will hear and see the rest of the podcast if you would like if you don't want to do it. No problem

13
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:07,060
I'm not offended. Just enjoy what you want and have a good day

14
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:21,960
Oh

15
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,080
It's podcast the right Club 3 you guys say hi, but otherwise, let's skip the formalities. Okay. There you go

16
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:43,120
It's a beautiful day for a card game too much too much formality talking about the weather

17
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,120
I

18
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:54,840
Well, I took up just as much time complaining about the formality look at that the point of that energy was to get straight to

19
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,200
Our guests who were so excited has joined us behind the double paywall

20
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:03,300
You know, he is renowned for his raving's about burgers

21
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,240
But today he's all about a trading card game made by Ravensburger

22
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:14,160
It's the Ravensburger boy Nick Weiger Wow that that beats the Ravensburger joke

23
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:20,240
I had locked and loaded which is that a Ravensburger sounds like a Raven-Symones pop-up that Robert earl restaurants

24
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:29,200
Oh, I disagree that sounds that's both a good joke and a very viable idea a bad ghost kitchen that would be inside a book

25
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:34,560
It a Beppo no perfectly viable business idea and by that I mean something that would fail in any

26
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,680
Regular terms, but something that he could write a lot of

27
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:44,400
Taximony off of now obviously both of our respective podcasts have talked about Robert earl at length. I am curious

28
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:50,160
How like how many of the Robert earl panoply of ghost kitchens? Have you actually sampled?

29
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:54,560
We did a thing. I did an experiment during our

30
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:59,000
Celebrary month where we had Mariah's cookies. Yes

31
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:03,320
Delivered right both a was it a Stewart Anderson and a book of the Beppo

32
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:07,840
I think to see which would get there faster and which was of superior quality and

33
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:14,960
All forms were slow expensive and bad. Yeah, so that's my most that's the only time I've ordered

34
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:22,600
What is your guys ghost kitchen? You've done a chicken guy of you not coming from black Angus. Yes, I believe so, okay

35
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,960
Yeah

36
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,960
Yeah, we've had

37
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:31,300
The guy fury one that was the ghost kitchen at Boca real disappointing the guy

38
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:39,800
Where that where was that good a pet po, okay, I just wanted to hear it and hear it correctly, okay

39
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,440
Correctly in a wrong

40
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:51,520
Yeah, we think the guys one was really disappointed cuz he's like he's a at least a chef like he's a restaurant guy

41
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:57,920
It's one thing was like Mariah Carey or whatever like Mario Lopez wants to like lend his name to a bad sandwich like whatever

42
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,560
He's case getting a check

43
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:04,320
But when it's like when your business is food and like you're you have a food empire

44
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:08,400
Like wouldn't you want your own restaurant to be good quality food?

45
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:13,040
So that was a real that was a real bummer the the other ones we did we did mr.

46
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:20,000
Beast burger, which was a real disappointment and then obviously there was litigation involved after that and then and then tiger bites was just

47
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:27,440
Wretched and tiger bites was like chicken fingers and I'm like again tiger is a rapper. Okay, and it's like it's

48
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:33,880
How do you mess up a tendy? You know what I mean? Like it's like that should be like a pretty straightforward food stuff

49
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:38,320
I feel like you'll get like a frozen tendy that you heat up in the oven that will be better than like what you would

50
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,680
Get from Robert Earl's ghost kitchen. So it's a real bummer

51
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,360
There's something that creeps me out, especially about both

52
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:49,920
Tendies and cookies just feel wrong coming out of the Bucca to what do I do Beppo?

53
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:55,320
I guess just a consistent kitchen like I don't it just doesn't feel like the place that should be me

54
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:59,280
No any of those things. Yeah, I don't know like

55
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:04,280
Oregano getting in the air of the of the cookie ingredients. It's weird. It's weird

56
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:09,560
I you know what quick formalities before we we get into things

57
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,200
Obviously

58
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:16,240
Nick you won by a wide margin. Thank you for bringing this idea to us right at the end of the city walk saga

59
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:23,960
And excited to do this with you. The runner-up was Little Golden Books about Disney attractions

60
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,960
They you know, there's those these like kind of simple books for kids

61
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,600
It's a small world and Space Mountain and figment

62
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:36,320
They you know, they've done all kinds of attractions as kids books could be a good one for us parents could be fun

63
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:42,240
But we do need four more topics for the poll next month. And you know what? How about to match Little Golden Books?

64
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:48,480
We let's do topics that are all at least tangentially related to theme parks. Oh, that's fun. Why yeah, why not?

65
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:53,240
You know, there's been a lot of work been a lot of sitcoms and bands and long dead actors

66
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:57,800
So what let's let's stay mildly on topic though. Even that's like a step beyond

67
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:04,080
Also, it just said just because Emeril has a restaurant somewhere in a theme park does not mean that Emeril sitcom again qualifies

68
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:14,240
The 20-year contract that Emeril clearly signed with Universal Orlando is if we can get a hold of it, you know

69
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:19,380
one thing to bring up also you ended up be one of the topics you ended up beating Nick was

70
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:25,880
The Nixon presidential library. Yeah, the Richard Nixon presidential library in Yorba Linda, California

71
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:32,240
Which I there was a moment where I was like it would be funny to pivot to that and just do that episode instead

72
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,940
But I felt like it also felt like the club three

73
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:39,940
Voters were like it because they wanted this specifically. I don't want to give that toss them like a fuck you

74
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:44,660
You know, I mean, so like let's let's do the Larkana app. Although I do think by the end of this

75
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:47,140
You're gonna be begging for the Richard Nixon

76
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:54,180
It is a place it's a place you can go with themed rooms

77
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:54,860
It's true

78
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:57,300
and if you look if you ever want to pull as you know

79
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:02,420
We try to vest a lot of power in this in the person in the club three seat if you ever want to do some

80
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:08,460
Nixonian abuse of power and switch this or barge in to any other episode and make it be about Nixon

81
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:15,060
That is your right. You know what we should do is we should make custom Nixon Larkana cards with different powers

82
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:17,660
And we could just insert them into our decks

83
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:21,420
Yeah, I mean he is in the Hall of Presidents right is in the Hall of Presidents

84
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:27,340
Character yeah in the universe. Uh-huh to tie to Walt. So I think there's many things we could do with that

85
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,740
So maybe maybe yeah, we create our own

86
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:37,320
Full like our own full or kind of decks right like custom cards like a deep throat card that like applies like a plus

87
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:43,220
Tube off to one of your cars secretly. Yeah, no one knows about it Robert Earl card. There you go restaurant

88
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:51,500
it's like restaurateur extraordinaire or something and then like it's plus like plus or negative three points or something because of like the

89
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,500
bad food you've served to your

90
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:59,060
With his food and then like you'll it's like a really strong

91
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:04,420
Points for any card that Jason throws down. It gives Jason power automatically

92
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:11,960
Minus three minus three hit points except playing against Jason and it makes Jason automatically win the game

93
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,820
The lure I have so much lure

94
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:26,100
I that is true now to say it officially this topic first officially nominated by Nicole Nassuti

95
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,100
Disney Larkana with Nick Weiger

96
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:36,300
In this yeah, yeah, somebody had to do it per parliamentary procedure and thus you were here one looking out for another appreciate that

97
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:37,780
Oh, that's true. Yeah

98
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:39,460
so I

99
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:44,100
Guess at this point I have to really turn it over to you Nick and to some extent Mike

100
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:47,140
Because I have prepared nothing and I know nothing

101
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:50,420
Jason before we started you were saying you were watching a ton of

102
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:56,340
Larkana tutorials and get to like get to know it videos. I did not do anything of the sort

103
00:08:56,340 --> 00:09:00,380
I don't know what this is and I will require you guys to explain it to me like I'm fine

104
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:06,700
And I have to say a lot of the videos watch very nicely produced very professionally done

105
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:11,940
I could not follow a lick of them. Yes, totally inscrutable. It's like it's really

106
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:14,180
it's a very

107
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:18,740
complicated set of rules for what should be and what I imagine would be a lot of

108
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:21,940
Players entry point for collectible card games

109
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:25,500
Like I imagine if you're like, you know, like whatever you're under the age of 10

110
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:29,380
And you've never played one of these games before and you're a Disney like fan

111
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:32,740
then like you might in your tractors of the characters for whatever reason then you might be

112
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:36,740
Like I meant attracted in the sense of like that. You will like that

113
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:39,180
I didn't mean like it's like it like they didn't print it on you sexually

114
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:42,940
I was not trying to say that like but like well, I don't have you seen every card

115
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:44,940
Maybe some of them are

116
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:51,300
Sarah Roxanne card is there I know there is multiple Fox Robin Hood cards. Oh, yeah sure

117
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:59,940
Yeah, we've discussed the meme of the Robin Hood the the Fox Robin Hood passing the the the torch to the

118
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:02,460
to Nick from

119
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,860
Yeah, yeah

120
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:08,180
Yeah, it's like it's like that. He's like shaking his hand and he was like he was like

121
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:11,100
Thanks for taking care of the last generation of furries. I'll take it from here

122
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:15,300
Wow

123
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:20,460
Wow, is he hotter? No bullshit. Yeah. Yeah, I know

124
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:24,580
Like sleazy and like a cool way

125
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:32,700
Contemporary, but like your attractiveness. I don't know. I don't know if I'm the one to say no Fox Robin Hood is smoother and he's cooler

126
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,900
I he's much cooler. I think there might be an aesthetic quality though

127
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,700
If you grew up with 3d animation

128
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:42,780
You might just be looking at a you might look for a 3d animated character more so than like a cell cell

129
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:47,700
Animated care you more of it like it you're like attracted to dimensions different. Yeah, I think so

130
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:51,420
I don't know. I just could just be like what the visual language are used to right as a kid

131
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:57,820
I don't know. Yeah, but but I'm just speculating. I do want to I do want to make sure we have time for for Lorcan

132
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:00,820
I don't know how many I think we'll probably at least get through one game

133
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:07,060
It's a it's you know, it's a 60-deck a game. So it's like 60 cards 60. I mean, yes

134
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:14,220
You're correct a 60 card deck and a game like Hearthstone, which is a mobile game is like a 30 card deck

135
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:19,220
So like that's designed for like a quicker round 60 cards is like I think like kind of the general magic the gathering

136
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:22,060
Which is like a meteor lengthier gameplay session

137
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:26,660
So I don't know how long one of these is gonna take because I'll be honest. I have not played Lorcan a before

138
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:31,940
I did I did spend a lot of time studying the rules and I did spend I did watch a lot of the

139
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:36,820
Tutorial videos, but I thought it would be more interesting to just try to come in cold and they're like

140
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:41,300
Let's just see what this is like Mike. Have you gotten any practice games in? I've never played Lurkana

141
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:46,020
Though you've been collecting the decks, yes

142
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:51,740
Yeah, you are coming in with that but you've never actually yeah ends up being a big part of the Mike and I've talked a lot

143
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:57,420
About the Marvel overpower game from the mid to late 90s and a few years ago

144
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:02,580
We did have people over and try to play. Yeah. Yeah, cuz I have a ton of those cards still

145
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:10,780
Yeah, and it was admittedly confusing, but I think eventually caught on I think it's a thing where it was a little

146
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:17,660
Modular like customizable like you can play a quicker version of this than a longer version

147
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:21,140
Yeah, that's all true. I still don't remember how to play it

148
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:25,460
I do not know and that's something I was I collected a ton of as a kid

149
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,900
So yeah, and no I haven't I

150
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:34,220
Have magic the gathering cards. I tried playing that when I was a kid. It was a little confusing to me as well back then

151
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:39,420
This seems less confusing the magic the other thing. So I did just to talk about collectible card games real quickly

152
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:42,660
I did play magic the gathering when I was a kid and I

153
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:47,980
And then I also like, you know, that would the physical game that that's the physical one. I played I mentioned Hearthstone

154
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:50,220
That's the Blizzard game

155
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:55,180
That's set in like kind of the Warcraft universe and I played that like like a bit too much

156
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:58,900
And then also Carlson you and I have both been playing Marvel snap

157
00:12:58,900 --> 00:12:59,260
Yeah

158
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:03,020
Which I've fallen off of cuz I just it's a thing that's like both a time sink and a money sink

159
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:08,100
Like I just I'm buying too many of these you buy you spend money. Yeah, well, I buy the season pass. Did you ever buy?

160
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,100
I haven't bought I haven't spent any money actually

161
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:10,500
Yeah

162
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,580
I would not I would like this the the whatever the season pass was was like

163
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:18,100
599 a month or whatever and then you get like some cards and right, you know some platinum currency or whatever

164
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:21,660
So I was I was continually on the hook for that and I reached a certain was like I can't be doing this anymore

165
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:23,620
That one's a 12 card deck

166
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:27,940
So like they're really quick gameplay sessions. Yeah, I just signed up for that last night

167
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:33,340
It's fun. It definitely holds your hand a lot more at least at the beginning

168
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:41,220
And there's a lot of fun sounds in my friends as Mike says my friends from the Marvel Universe are there

169
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:45,100
I will say this real quick and I don't like to be braggadocious

170
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:48,660
But in the same way that Jason was bragging about his sexual prowess the other day on the show

171
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:52,500
This is a new thing. Yeah, I'm gonna be bragging about my prowess at Marvel snap

172
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:59,140
I'm excellent. Wow this game. Have you found that Marvel snap is a great way to connect with your partner the opposite in fact

173
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:05,540
It's a good way to disconnect from exactly. Yes, it's good way to just be in your own little world on your phone

174
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:12,220
You're playing snap Lindsay. He's got a stack of Christopher Pike books. That's right. Yeah, that's how love works

175
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:15,460
And our child is just doing whatever we're not sure

176
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:20,220
She's over by one of the outlets. It's fine. She loves that

177
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:27,500
Yes, I say part of the joy of listening to this podcast is that you know when you have an episode that's devoted to the Super Bowl

178
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,900
Shuffle that goes into a lengthy digression

179
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,100
Jason Sheridan's

180
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:35,460
joys of carnality

181
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:44,420
Explaining what sex is to Mike and I people who have reproduced as if it is explaining the rules of Lorcan Oh to me

182
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:47,220
It's good stuff. I

183
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:48,540
Do want to

184
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:50,900
One more one more tangent before we get into this

185
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:57,140
So we were going to do an episode of doughboys with y'all last year and unfortunately we couldn't get the scheduling right because of you

186
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:58,940
you all went to

187
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:01,700
To Orlando and then Mitch was gonna be out of town

188
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,700
And so the timing didn't work out

189
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:09,780
But how much I don't know how much you've dug into bucket Lister's but this was a thing that was through bucket Lister's

190
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:15,780
Which is a company that does like promotions and and like little pop-ups and events in various regions

191
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:21,380
They so they what they had is they had a family guy a pop-up that was both

192
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:22,900
This is what we're gonna review for the show

193
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:28,260
It was both like a miniature like kind of like the the Pawtuck at Pete's so what's the bar and go?

194
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:32,580
I am the drunken clam. Yeah, I was a miniature drunken clam and then also a family guy mini golf

195
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:36,540
Yeah, yeah, and unfortunately, we couldn't get the scheduling quite right, but I'm gonna be a

196
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:44,020
Double show crossover even there were big plans put in this. Yeah. Yeah, but I don't know how much again

197
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:48,580
You've dug into this but it's really interesting all the the weird like shitty events that they put on

198
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:53,260
So I've got the I've got the the bucket Lister's LA thing open right now

199
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:55,940
They've done things

200
00:15:55,940 --> 00:16:02,180
I know that that that our buddies over at your Kickstarter sucks went to one of these in the Nashville area and it was a Simpsons

201
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:04,180
Pop-up bar and they did an episode of it

202
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:07,980
And it was like it they were just talked about how cheap it was

203
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,900
but one of the details that I like fixated on is that

204
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:16,980
Behind the bar was not a guy and mow the bartender cosplay. It was uh, it was sideshow Bob

205
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:22,740
And it's just like how do you get that wrong? It's like mows bar. How do you not get mows the boat a bartender?

206
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:27,260
Just so orthogonal from the act what the actual show is anyway

207
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:30,020
exceptional quality control exactly

208
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:35,060
Would you ever get a sense of how the family guy experience was like what we missed?

209
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:39,620
I think it was kind of shitty. I think it was like a little chintzy and if you got some stuff is

210
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:47,140
A lot of flats. Oh, yeah, like putting greens. It was a nine hole miniature golf course, which I'm an 18 hole

211
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:49,660
mini golf

212
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:53,060
Shorter but I

213
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:57,580
Understood when I saw the physical space like oh, yeah, okay nine holes

214
00:16:57,580 --> 00:17:00,300
We didn't get canceled not just because of our schedules

215
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:03,060
But we had a date planned and like we'll do it on Wednesday

216
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:06,700
And it was like this is canceled because we are no longer doing Wednesdays

217
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:09,780
They started pulling dates I think because they weren't because of poor sales

218
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:13,700
So that was part of we had to win then we had to reschedule and then the other dates didn't work

219
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:17,100
It was a whole whole but a range of things around the same time

220
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:22,340
I feel like we why you and I were talking about going to a thing called Santa's secret, which was a dirty

221
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:26,340
Show and we didn't that wasn't even for content. No, we're just gonna go

222
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:33,540
Do that you were really interested in the burlesque Santa thing and Santa's secret in the Beverly which mall

223
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:37,420
Yes, Beverly Center. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, and even Anderson was was

224
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:44,360
Wrangle that and then there was also they they for July 4th. They recently brought back uncle Sam's secret, which is

225
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:52,100
Patriotic version of it. I feel they yeah, they were like subbing out holidays for like they're different like burlesque show

226
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:56,380
So, I don't know if Santa's secret comes back. Maybe we make a priority this year. I'd love to go to Santa's

227
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:59,700
I love that experience. I guess we could do an episode if we feel like it

228
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:05,580
What was I don't remember what were some of the things that were supposed to happen at Santa's secret

229
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:10,100
I think you were supposed to like they were like hyping up that you would learn what Santa's secret was

230
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:13,980
Like there was some sort of reveal about what Santa had been hiding

231
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:16,000
I don't think it was just his dick

232
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:21,660
But it's possible like they're like there was some there was some sort of mystery that was going to be unraveled

233
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:26,220
Well, cuz it like it was I believe the promo photo was something like a pair of lips

234
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:29,620
Like, you know dressing like a Santa suit with like a finger like a

235
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:33,560
And then the the caption was don't tell mrs. Claus

236
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:43,740
So mrs. Claus wasn't involved in the show I guess no, I think it's like Santa's like kind of horny fantasy

237
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:49,940
I think is the idea so I imagine there'll be all sorts of like whatever like sexy elves and sexy like reindeer and you know

238
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:52,740
I mean like it like all just like like kind of a Christmas pasty

239
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:54,940
Reindeer I don't know

240
00:18:56,540 --> 00:19:02,660
How many angles no bad idea for a burlesque dancer at a Christmas review, you know

241
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:04,700
Yeah, so yeah

242
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:10,620
I mean in this scenario like Santa's like very bored in the workshop and he just starts imagining letting his mind drift

243
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:13,500
Yeah, all the elves making the toys turn into hunks

244
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:21,780
I don't know dance or something. I think so. I think it's mostly that and it's just an excuse for like kind of lewd dancing

245
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:27,380
Take a break from carving little dolls in boats and maybe try. I don't know but plug

246
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:34,620
Well, I also just like I like a hunky Santa I always think that's like a fun thing, you know

247
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:40,700
Yeah, sure and then it was it looked like it was equal opportunity as far as like ladies and men both

248
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:44,700
In good shape. Yeah, that's part of the fun of it, too. Yeah

249
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:51,500
So yeah, I just wanted to go celebrate the human body. It's not even about the sexuality or the maybe oh, yeah

250
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,500
No, it's not about sexuality. I'm not comfortable with that

251
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:58,500
As far as the scene is the bodies. Yeah, I like that. I like that part. Yeah

252
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:01,660
Okay, well then

253
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,380
much to play

254
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:09,780
Don't figure something out and uncle Sam because God and I don't think I don't know regular facts about uncle Sam much less a secret

255
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:14,360
That flips my notion of what uncle Sam is right head. Don't tell mrs. Sam

256
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:16,360
All

257
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,240
Right, we do we want to dig in

258
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:27,400
Because you guys you've come prepared despite having not played it with anybody

259
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,520
You've both got kits you got gear

260
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,760
I hate to

261
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:37,880
You know call him out especially but why yours is a little bit more professional and slick

262
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:43,720
Well, I don't know about that because I will say that that I couldn't find so that these the starter deck that it come that

263
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:48,960
That the Carlson still has a case for here. It comes with a bunch of extra shit

264
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:53,360
So it comes with like a bunch of counters that you can use to denote like car buffs or D

265
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:57,920
But card buffs or D buffs and then there's also like a a thing that I think tracks the amount of lore

266
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:04,280
Which is the the win condition for the game? Yes. Now, this is a this little I didn't bring that this little box

267
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:07,480
I have is a separate purchase. Oh, okay a different thing

268
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:13,000
You just purchased the box and it's a thicker box with card stock for your specific deck

269
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:18,240
This is this so I bought this just like to show off. This is a flashy little like Scrooge

270
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:24,400
Yeah, it's really you bought that to show off and I didn't clock that it was something to show off and I liked Knicks instead

271
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:32,600
Generic black case. Yes, that could be but it's a good case used for makeup. It could be used for anything

272
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:35,880
Well, they have any sort of branding on it. This is in a way like

273
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:42,360
Toiletries kit that I got with a free bag from a podcast. Yeah, I mean it's nice

274
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,960
Yeah, so but it's very functional

275
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:46,800
I will say this and I think Scott you will not be upset with me

276
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:50,520
But I have an extra starter deck that I would like to gift Jason before we start this

277
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:58,080
He can like kind of go through and see some of the cards and then maybe in dead spaces when we're trying to figure

278
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:02,120
Out what the hell we're doing. You can go. Oh, look at this. It's Jasper from

279
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:07,040
101 Dalmatians, that's great. That's great. Can I also can I read really quickly?

280
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:13,880
We're throwing a lot of like specifics out but another person who officially nominated this topic Benjamin Martin said

281
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:17,000
Let's see some hot Lorcan a action with Weiger

282
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:23,080
I also would like to nominate Jason as official flavor text reciter for the episode

283
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:30,140
What does that mean? And what would that entail on Jason's part? I am I reading like the card?

284
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:33,140
By like the bit of color

285
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:39,260
So basically and I have this this Cruella de Vil card right here, which we can use as an example

286
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:41,180
But there's a bunch of numbers on this thing

287
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:46,540
So like this this is like the amount of ink it costs to play this number two up here in the corner

288
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:51,380
This is essentially it's there. They're different names that it has for it that I think are a little bit tamer

289
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:54,180
But this is essentially like it's a tack and it's health pool

290
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:56,700
You spend ink you spend

291
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:05,220
Yes, okay and then lore when we say lore that's not the lore of the world of lore is wind

292
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:08,780
The lore is yes. Oh, no, that's damage counter

293
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:15,140
Lore is like points. You're trying to get to 20 lore 20 lore non pluralized

294
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:20,740
And but ink is yeah spend ink to get lore you spend ink and then

295
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:28,460
You spend it in one turn the next turn the ink you can't play a card the ink has to dry, right?

296
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:31,860
I'm not kidding

297
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:35,220
So so this is this is like a concept that's in a lot of these games

298
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:42,060
I believe in Magic the other means called summoning sickness and basically it's a gameplay balance thing that if I play Cruella de Vil on

299
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:47,420
This turn I have to wait another turn. So I've introduced Cruella de Vil to the game board

300
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:51,060
I have to wait another turn before I can use Cruella de Vil's abilities

301
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:56,020
So I can't just like throw it down throw down a bunch of cards at once play them all at once and then you know

302
00:23:56,020 --> 00:24:00,340
Whatever, maybe I can I can burst out a win suddenly and they say her ink is drying

303
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:06,180
That yes, that's the term that you use because you use because you spend ink the currency to play a character

304
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:11,980
I spending to ink to play Cruella de Vil then the ink has to dry for a single turn before I can use Cruella de Vil's

305
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:15,180
Let's see, let her now get going ability

306
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:20,020
Or or use Cruella de Vil to attack one of Carlson's characters

307
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:22,700
So the flavor text is do we see at the bottom?

308
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:27,900
so there's all these things that says like their abilities that all their stats the name the name of the card the type of

309
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:32,780
Card at the bottom it says and and and Sheridan you can read that sure on at the end

310
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:35,960
Yeah, they in the italics the italics. Yeah, okay, great

311
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:41,980
Isn't it just gorgeous darling and just as stylish as I am

312
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:46,500
Wow, so it's just a little bit of pizzazz to kind of like add to the character of the world

313
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:50,420
It is a little pizzazz. Yeah, and she is a very jaunty outfit

314
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:55,860
I feel like can I can I borrow one of your cards when you get them open Jason to like get a sense of?

315
00:24:55,860 --> 00:25:02,580
What this of course are and oh Nick you have every one of these cards in a protective sleeve

316
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:06,580
Yeah, I sleeved these preemptively if I take them out of here. You can see the card back

317
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:10,260
That is also better than what Mike did. Hey, do you think so?

318
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:18,060
I fell right in it fell right into the trap because maybe I have sleeves and everything and maybe they're special

319
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:20,820
Lorcona sleeves

320
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:29,100
So far that's really cool. Oh, that's right. Oh, we're right to the sexy fox. Yep

321
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:36,260
My whole deck has that Robin Hood backing basically with a different card protectors. Where did you get these sleeves online?

322
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:41,940
I don't remember best buy comm perhaps. I forget you're not gonna last five minutes looking at these sleeves

323
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:43,980
yeah

324
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:53,340
Yeah, mine mine just has like a generic like black backing you could use in any any card game

325
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:55,940
So it's it's a little bit less on point

326
00:25:55,940 --> 00:26:01,220
All right on the scale on my lore scale you guys are even you both have okay great Scott

327
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:02,060
Yeah

328
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:08,420
also you talk about where you get these Mike and I realized that some of the mythology here and why this has come up on

329
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:09,900
the show before is

330
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:17,020
Because do you not do you or do you not find out about Lorcona deals from your beloved deal vibes?

331
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:21,420
I have in the past. Yes found out because initially when this came out the first

332
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:25,300
Like the introductory sets they were very hard to find

333
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:30,660
Sold out you'd have to go and reset like on eBay or something and buy them at big markups

334
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:33,140
This is only been going for like a year that this is less

335
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:39,540
I think at this point last November or something and they've released like five sets at this point and it's not impossible to get anymore

336
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:44,060
It's still pretty popular from what I how like just seeing in target

337
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:47,180
It seems like you yeah, you see things here and there but sometimes they'll be sold out

338
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:52,020
But yes deal vibes, especially early days would be like go now

339
00:26:52,540 --> 00:27:00,460
Lorcona available at Amazon or Lorcona available at best buy comm. Mm-hmm. And yes, I think I think I got something via

340
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:07,760
Deal vibes link. I'm trying to remember which one but it's all blur when you're talking about different Twitter pop-up

341
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:14,040
Messages I get alerting me to a specific deal or something in stock. It's a kind of a blur at this point

342
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:17,920
It happens so often when you got to choose like in a given day

343
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:22,640
How many can you get like do you get a Lorcona pack when he's also offering like, you know

344
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:29,600
Tricks themed after Deadpool and Wolverine. Yeah or patio furniture, which is what was happening

345
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:34,800
And I'll take a look I go it was a good deal for that, but I don't think we need that right now

346
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:39,440
That's a hundred dollars off. Oh, that would be a good good chair and table set for the patio

347
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:43,620
I don't need we don't need that. Is he the main source of your shopping?

348
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:53,540
Like the trap I fall into is I spend too much money on something because it's a deep discount

349
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:57,480
It's like I don't need this. Yeah, but it's like this is like 50% off

350
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:00,400
I was like, I gotta get you know, I mean like, oh, yeah, we just got we just bought

351
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:03,040
I just bought like a new cabinet. I was like, wait, I don't we don't really need this

352
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,320
It's like it's kind of functional for our space

353
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:09,160
but it's also like this is more money than I need to spend on this thing just because it was on sale I

354
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:17,000
Read a lot on my Kindle nowadays. Yes, and try not to buy too many new books

355
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,400
But then I get really into buying

356
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:26,960
Used books like interesting like oh cool. That's really I just learned about this book and it's not available through the library

357
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:32,120
So I can get it used so and did the same thing with like cool vintage t-shirts

358
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:37,360
So now that's becoming an issue. It's like oh, I have too much secondhand stuff now

359
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,720
Yeah, put him in Wiger's cabinet

360
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:46,320
Like a gift of the magi sort of situation

361
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:50,200
Do you have a do you have a used book like go to like do you have like a like a site you look at?

362
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,240
I really like a biblio.com

363
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:55,480
eat eat books is good to

364
00:28:56,400 --> 00:29:01,520
I feel like I use a like Alibri or Alibri so I can't remember what okay what the site is

365
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:05,040
But like I yeah, it's the same thing cuz you just see something is like wait

366
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:11,120
This is like 80% less than the than a new copy and it's like in good condition like I might I like yeah

367
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:16,920
I'll get this and then yeah book I never read the only issue is with the older stuff from like 70s or 80s the

368
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,360
like

369
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:24,280
Print is so small. Yes. Yeah. Yeah, I'm dealing with that now. I'm reading up

370
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:27,280
I've been reading this we're working my way through this Paul Schrader book

371
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,120
and

372
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:32,680
It's the the director what the hell is it called?

373
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:37,320
It's like transcendental film making or something like that and it's so boring

374
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:41,720
and it's like it's so boring and the text is so small and it's like, you know, it's

375
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:46,560
It's a it's like a hundred eighty pages. So I was like, okay, I'll breeze through this

376
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:52,200
But then like the font point is like the size of like the care instructions on like a laundry tag

377
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:58,820
So it's like so I'm like reading this eight-point font and it's just like so dull about like talking about you know

378
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:00,820
I'm

379
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:07,540
Whatever like talking about some particular like shot size at length and I'm just like man this is like I don't know

380
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:11,220
It's just gonna take me forever to get through it. Yeah, you're doing it. I'm doing it. Yeah. Yeah

381
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:14,660
Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I know you plan. So we're throwing a lot

382
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:20,860
Yeah, but could I say could I explain what the actual like narrative of the game we're playing is? Yes

383
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:24,060
So

384
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:29,020
What happens when you play the game against someone else you are playing as an Illumineer? Yes

385
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:33,340
We are Illumineers. We are Illumineers like the band the Illumineers the hey ho band

386
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:37,020
Called the Illumineers, but

387
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:42,380
Close your sandwich you're calling them. Yeah, they're the ill

388
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:48,540
Mears they're ill. Yeah, I think they're ill. Yeah. Yeah. Uh-huh. Yeah the way you said cool 30 years ago exactly

389
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:52,820
Yeah, 30 years. That's yeah makes sense. So what we're doing is we're summoning

390
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:54,980
glimmers of

391
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:58,220
Disney characters so these when we're playing cards with Cruella de Vil

392
00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:00,940
It's not that we're actually playing with the real Cruella

393
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:06,240
We're summoning sort of a snapshot of them and making them sentient in the moment

394
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:11,920
That is the way in which it's being described so they can be different versions of the character, you know

395
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:16,660
They don't have to be directly like they can be out of doing things out of character slightly, right?

396
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:19,500
Because you have a before I believe of the same character in a deck

397
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:23,820
So it's like it just I think is to make it make sense that you can have four Goofy's right ever

398
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:27,740
But I think it's also a little bit of the that it's the same device

399
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:34,860
They use in Nintendo use in Super Smash Brothers of like we don't actually want Mario punching link or or peach or peach

400
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:39,500
Yeah, we don't actually want that. So what they're they're these are dolls that come to life, right?

401
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:44,280
You know, we're fighting for fun. It's not they're not the actual character. Okay, they come to life as

402
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:47,020
facsimiles of these care

403
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:50,820
Not literally okay, but we are you would have loved Disney's work

404
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:56,580
Simulation and simulacra are very heavy

405
00:31:57,180 --> 00:32:02,180
Like when Mickey kills Pluto in a game, it's not really happening

406
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:07,520
No, you know, I hope we get to see that kind of thing that happens a hundred presented really others

407
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:11,460
Yeah, there's deaths in this you're attacking you are tearing other characters

408
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:16,420
They have all sorts of language for it that I think is this more about like I'm blocking you or whatever

409
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:18,420
I'm removing from the game

410
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:23,120
Could be like cutting off Phineas and Ferb's head

411
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:32,540
And there are like weapons there's like a frying pan there's a skillet yes, yeah, you can hit Pluto with a skillet

412
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:36,820
There's also songs which we'll get into there are songs

413
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:40,040
Okay. Yeah, there's characters items

414
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:47,420
Actions actions and then in newer series. There's locations. Oh, there's locations. Okay

415
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:50,860
Yeah, I think that I don't know if if you guys

416
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:59,020
I have a couple of the Ursula returns expansion. Okay cards in this deck, but it's mostly first

417
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:01,860
Generation. Yeah, that's this that's the same as me

418
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:06,780
I think I got one expansion pack that came bundled with my started which I think is what you have

419
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:08,780
Yeah, I have opened my

420
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:11,820
Starter deck and I have quick start rules

421
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:18,540
There is a game at in here and then there is the stack of 60 cards that are sealed

422
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:21,540
yeah, and then there is a pack of

423
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:28,460
12 cards and I immediately when I saw this pack of 12 cards something activated my brain where I was like

424
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:30,980
I cannot wait to open these cut like

425
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:36,900
The primal childlike urge of like if someone gives me a pack of cards like I

426
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:41,180
Cannot wait to especially the collectible card game too because you could get like a very rare one

427
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:44,340
Which is what I pulled in one of these starter decks. I I don't have it with me

428
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:48,780
I have a card that's where they think five hundred dollars. Maybe I have like a bell card

429
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:54,260
That's very very rare that I pulled out of a starter the that expansion pack in a starter deck

430
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:57,180
So yeah, that's always that's always like, oh my god

431
00:33:58,180 --> 00:34:03,340
That's always exciting too there I did see there was a video and I thought it was like

432
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:10,940
Beginner's Lurkana, but it was actually like a stock market. Like here's the current what current cards are going for

433
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:16,940
Like it was like a collector's market video. I'm like, okay, so this thing is caught on

434
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:23,940
What are you two in the world of this? Are you just yourselves or a human ear?

435
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:27,300
We're sorry you're looming ears. Okay. Forgive me. There's a lot

436
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:30,380
and but and

437
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:32,900
Why why do looming ears do this?

438
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:38,340
We're good to win to go on a quest to see who can go finish their quest first

439
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:45,860
Essentially, okay, and the quest is getting to 20 lore. Yes. Yes. So so this is like again

440
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:49,400
I you know all these games stem from from Magic the Gathering the same way

441
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:53,180
They're all like, you know kind of tabletop role-playing comes from from Dungeons and Dragons to some degree

442
00:34:54,780 --> 00:35:00,540
And there you're attacking the other player and so like in that if we're playing Magic the Gathering then Carlson would have like a pool

443
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:05,580
Of hell of like 30 health and I would be trying to reduce his health to zero to kill him

444
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:09,860
But I think because it's Disney it's like well, we want to make this a little bit more abstract

445
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:15,300
It's about it's a race to get to who can accumulate 20 points for their own character first for their own Illumineer, right?

446
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:21,660
Yeah, so yeah, so I got I don't I didn't say we have to come up with their own personas as Illumineers

447
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:22,540
I think we can just be ourselves

448
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:27,860
But I don't know if you want to come up with something where like I'm Michael the great or the great Michael

449
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:31,220
Maybe I'll call myself the great Michael. This is your chance to inhabit a

450
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:36,020
Character who is very comfortable with sexuality. Oh, that's no

451
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:42,940
You're uncomfortable being someone who's comfortable with sex you don't want to be Bernard the mouse

452
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:50,500
Why well that's but that's already a character, huh Bernard is well you were inhabiting a character

453
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:55,580
Hard low-key like oh, yeah is Bernard your sort of hero when it comes to sexuality

454
00:35:58,420 --> 00:36:02,260
I'm just saying he's a little guy, but it's pretty confident, you know

455
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:05,980
He gets Shasha Gabor, right? That's Shasha

456
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:12,840
Isn't Eva Gabor, I'm always a bar is it a Gabor? Okay. It sounds like a three-topic

457
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:19,500
Sisters you guys do other things. I'll I'm I always reverse it one is on Green Acres one is in rescue

458
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:23,740
Wrong. I can't remember. You might be right. Look, you have anything on that

459
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:26,300
You have to do a Gabor sisters deep dive on club three

460
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:35,100
1314 year old I was like, oh man the Gabor's they're so glamorous

461
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:42,260
That's why you're the most comfortable with sexuality you got all Gabor pill when you were little Gabor pill

462
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:45,780
Gabor. Yeah, I'm the oldest one here

463
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:53,220
So I remember like being seven and seeing like Johnny Carson like making like using the the Gabor's as like the most beautiful women like punch

464
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:58,580
Like like I was gonna name like a hot woman. It's like I was naming Kardashians today. I would name the Gabor's

465
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:05,740
Okay, well I was pretty close yeah, I want all your cards hey

466
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:08,900
Maybe there's one of the Gabor's in the

467
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:11,060
viral

468
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:15,140
Paramount plus a paramount photo that was going around a while ago

469
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:17,380
Oh, I wonder with all of the you know

470
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:31,700
Comes back around it's I was just happy to see the forest Kelly

471
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:35,020
That's really all you immediately honed in on the forest Kelly

472
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:37,460
Yeah from he was standing next to Tom crew a young Tom Cruise

473
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:41,620
But a red-blooded man like Jason goes for Gabor, right?

474
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:48,120
Yeah, no, I wanted to see if there's a photo and Gabor's in it you got a Gabor ommeter perpetually in your

475
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:54,060
Detecting Gabor there is a grant. There's a company that makes these big Star Trek figures

476
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:58,580
They're very tall and realistic and they just released the picture of their new de forest

477
00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:01,860
Kelly figure with his like shirt open and he had got a medallion

478
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:06,420
It's from his look from Star Trek one. I was like, mmm. This is good. He's got a big bushy beard

479
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:11,260
This is good. I really like this Nick. You're gonna have to come back and play with that

480
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:17,580
Okay, I had to thin my deck a little bit because I did a count and I realized it's 70 cards because I just think I just

481
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:20,100
Tossed an expansion cards is 70 allowed. I thought 60

482
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:29,100
60 is the minute is like the floor. Okay, can have more than four of any type of car got it

483
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:33,340
So I'll just keep this as is for the the purposes of playing this playstation for cards got it

484
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:37,020
Okay, so you but you can have two tight two different stitch

485
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:46,060
Cards yes, if they're like different names or different art, but you can't have more than four of the same like

486
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:51,140
Foxrobin hood go and do and shootin bullseyes or something, right?

487
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:57,620
Cuz they'll be variants of of like the same like doc from the seven dwarfs, you know, like they'll be different

488
00:38:57,620 --> 00:39:01,300
There's like this is doc leader of the seven dwarfs, but they're also might also be you know

489
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:06,380
Doc a guy with glasses or you mean like you'll have some sort of different title to it

490
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:08,620
Which which that one's you're allowed those can coexist

491
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:12,660
Okay, so we start with a starting hand and I've got the Disney Larkana app up here

492
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:17,620
Which has a pretty helpful tutorial and also has like a built-in counter which we can use to track our lore

493
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:23,540
So the the starting hand we shuffle your our deck and each draws a hand of seven cards, right?

494
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:29,700
So we'll do a little shuffling here shuffling as I we talk. Yes. Yeah now I do in this

495
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:35,460
Starter kit does have a mat and did you guys want to use a mat mat?

496
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:39,740
Yeah, there's a mat in here. There's a paper mat. Let's take a look

497
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:44,340
Is it I is it actually four? Oh, it's a it pulls out. Okay. Yeah

498
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:51,900
Is it big enough? It's very tight. It doesn't seem to be the rare show that does an audio unboxing

499
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:57,620
Well, I think that I think the thing I think what that that has like a place for your discard pile and like yeah

500
00:39:57,620 --> 00:40:02,260
Like this is full. It's not like a full play mat. It's not okay. So this is a

501
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:05,860
Like a starter mat, yeah

502
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:10,460
Now Mike are you attempting to I mean we

503
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:13,100
You're attempting to film some of this

504
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:18,540
I don't know if I commit to actually posting any of it right and I'll cut that audio out if we don't okay, sure

505
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:23,780
But yeah in case anyone wants to see some of the exciting

506
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:26,540
card action here

507
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:32,740
Card table action. There is an okay. There'll be hopefully an okay video showing you what's going on here

508
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:36,700
Hopefully check in on my phone won't run out of battery before

509
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:39,060
How you guys feeling about what you're looking at?

510
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:41,220
Okay, so we I drew seven cards Carlson

511
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:45,660
I don't know if you've if you're gonna draw yours and then as part as part of this round we are allowed to

512
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:47,820
mull again

513
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:53,120
So you can take any number of these cards and then put them at the bottom of your deck and instead draw some

514
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:57,200
Replacements so a Gardner, I'll let you take a look at what I got here. Okay

515
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:00,840
so, you know, I just got a few different characters and

516
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,560
Okay, I think what I'm going to do

517
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,600
Is I'm going to

518
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:13,320
Mull again some I just just you know knowing how the other versions of these games work other types of these games work

519
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:18,840
I'm gonna mull again some of these higher cost cards to try to get some more lower cost ones that they could play earlier

520
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,960
So I'll just put like these three back

521
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:29,360
And I will draw three more mm-hmm. What are you doing Mike?

522
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,600
I'm gonna mull again a

523
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:37,720
Couple cards, but I'm actually pretty happy with my hand overall here

524
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:44,600
I'm gonna just actually put one back and then draw another and I'm going to quietly

525
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:52,840
Go through my starter kit and then I will probably burst out with excitement at inopportune times

526
00:41:53,120 --> 00:42:01,040
To describe what I'm encountering and read that text read that flavor, but I will keep the cards far away

527
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:06,360
So it's not to confuse any gameplay. All right, and I would say if you feel the need to

528
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:11,720
Nick or Mike, you know bring Jason in to have him read anything as

529
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:19,960
I did bring a full set of Robin Hood Prince of Thieves trading cards. So those get mixed in please feel free to play

530
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:28,000
Which there is back in my mom's house a lot of Robin Hood Prince of Thieves Wow Brian Adams

531
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:39,240
Which song was that that's the one that's a song that I referred to Aaron and I refer to as three idiots

532
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:46,040
Because it's the way it's the three musketeers of music Brian Adams sting and Rod Stewart. Oh, yeah, the most like machismo

533
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:47,840
I don't know how Henley didn't get invited

534
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:49,920
All of the best like

535
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:57,520
They're all just screaming their parts no harmonizing just three screamers

536
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:03,520
No, there was a I think there was a I don't know if they they reteamed or they tried to

537
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:09,960
Recreate that with a different like trio, but there wasn't there a song for like the lethal weapon 3 soundtrack

538
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:15,480
That was a similar thing. It was like an invented super group to do like like I think it's it's probably me was the name

539
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:19,880
Oh, I don't know that wait a minute actually and as you were talking was maybe involved

540
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:23,200
I got to deduct some lore for myself. I think that's a song maybe from three musketeers

541
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:26,800
Not from is Robin Hood anything I do I do it for you. Yeah, that's what it is

542
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,800
Yeah, but still Brian Adams. So my first joke was right

543
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:33,760
All for one from the Disney three musketeers

544
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:42,980
Movie. Yes. Yeah. Okay. Yeah that song stuck in my head the other day and I'm like that has to be the Chris O'Donnell three musketeers

545
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:48,220
Right. Yeah, you can't Scott you gained a point from the Gabor sister thing, but then you lost you lost

546
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:52,040
So your quest is even sort of right now

547
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:55,700
Carlson, do you want to go first? One of us needs to go first? Yes

548
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:58,900
Okay, I will go first and then the first player does not draw a card, right?

549
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:02,260
so what I'm gonna do is I am going to

550
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:05,900
Let's see here. I am going to

551
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:10,260
Shoot this is interesting. This is interesting

552
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:18,380
Okay, keep saying it it'll be true I am going to take here I'm gonna take a boo Jason do you say I dropped my flounder?

553
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:25,600
Little bit of color here is flounder

554
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:32,340
Excitement dot-dot-dot adventure dot-dot-dot change you're lurking around every core. Ah

555
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:36,300
So flounder is screaming in agony

556
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:40,380
So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take this

557
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:44,320
Lefou card and I'm gonna put it in my inkwell. Yes

558
00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:45,060
Okay

559
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:47,460
So I put it down face down here in my inkwell

560
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:51,740
And then what you do is you take the card and then you turn it

561
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:58,100
Like to the right to indicate that you're going to use the ink and then I am going to play

562
00:44:59,140 --> 00:45:04,500
Archimedes. Oh, wow. Okay. So so in magic the gathering this would be called tapping your card

563
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:09,580
I think the language they have in Larkana is exerting your card. So you turn it flip that you turn it

564
00:45:10,220 --> 00:45:12,780
No, I you leave it like that. I think until the next turn

565
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:14,660
Yes, okay. So yeah

566
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:19,980
So so you basically turn the card 90 degrees to signify that its powers have been exerted

567
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:24,740
So yes, so so what you have is like and what was the card you turn into ink Carlson?

568
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:28,940
The card I took was Lefou fan the flames an action card got it

569
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:33,020
So that card is now out of play and now it has just become a part of the ink pool

570
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:35,460
So he so Carlson can use that to

571
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:42,300
Pull other cards into play for the remainder remainder of the session. Yes. What do you think are the odds that this will take three hours?

572
00:45:46,340 --> 00:45:50,860
That is like a guarantee that's the safest bet you just got 20 lure

573
00:45:54,260 --> 00:45:59,980
Just gotta cut in I open the pack of 12 I got a hologram tinkerbell

574
00:46:03,020 --> 00:46:08,300
So that's pretty cool. You'd be mad if you've realized you gave Jason like 500 bucks worth of

575
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:13,580
I thought about maybe giving him the pack and then saying but I get to keep the pack inside

576
00:46:13,580 --> 00:46:19,460
I thought oh those exchanges were always so fun in childhood. What do you mean? Oh, yeah that like hey

577
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:24,860
You can have this action figure, but I get to take it back any time. I want oh, well, I didn't that wasn't what I was

578
00:46:24,860 --> 00:46:26,860
Gonna do

579
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:32,100
Okay, here's our Hercules card and he's wearing a full lions main like the

580
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:40,040
Mythological Hercules so what's the what's the little text underneath Hercules like directly underneath what what's like his title you gotta admit

581
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:42,260
That was pretty heroic

582
00:46:42,620 --> 00:46:46,520
Or wait, no, you want that's a flavor text, but what's that? What's like his title?

583
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:55,200
Dreamborn hero prince. Okay, so that this is like a different version of Hercules than the default Hercules. Yes. Okay got it

584
00:46:55,200 --> 00:47:00,180
Okay, so, um, so are you are you done with your turn? I am done with my turn. Yes. So now it's my turn

585
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:05,920
So I can turn cards. I think the first thing is to turn cards into ink. Yeah, and I can do that once per turn

586
00:47:06,940 --> 00:47:08,940
I'm gonna take this Gaston

587
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:15,140
This is a Gaston baritone bully. Okay chair down. I'm gonna look at that flavor text real quick. That might be fun

588
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:17,780
Yep, I like that. You should call him Gaston

589
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:25,440
Without like an E at the end. It's thinking about his stones. Yeah. Yeah Gaston's big stones flavor text. No one

590
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:28,220
sings like Gaston I

591
00:47:29,060 --> 00:47:31,840
Think Gaston is as valid as Bucca di Pepo

592
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:38,780
I'm putting this down and then I don't have enough. Unfortunately does not give me enough ink to play one of the other cards in my

593
00:47:39,140 --> 00:47:43,540
In my hand, so I will pass sounds like you don't have a very balanced deck. Well, you know

594
00:47:45,060 --> 00:47:48,980
I got a starter deck. So I don't know what to tell you take it up with Ravensburger

595
00:47:49,940 --> 00:47:57,180
Mr. Ravensburger. All right. Well, okay. I have to Ravensburg. I have to draw a card here

596
00:47:57,740 --> 00:48:02,060
okay, and then I'm going to have to yes, I have to add to my inkwell and

597
00:48:02,820 --> 00:48:06,580
Which card am I gonna strategically add to my inkwell Carlson?

598
00:48:06,580 --> 00:48:11,860
I realize I forgot to draw a card last turn today. Did you're drawing one now and then just moving forward?

599
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:13,420
mmm

600
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:15,420
Yes, okay

601
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:23,960
It's a very polite game for now, I know I was thinking about okay, so what I'm gonna do is I am going to

602
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:28,120
Put in the inkwell, there's some a lot of pressure doing this. I'm like

603
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:34,040
I'm going to take Olaf the friendly snowman and put him in my inkwell

604
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:41,740
And wow, let me let Jason say this little piece of dialogue from Olaf and if you could do the voice I'd appreciate it

605
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:45,320
I'm Olaf and I like worm hugs

606
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:49,960
Okay, that is good we all agree

607
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:57,000
Your move dad and then I will activate I will activate my ink

608
00:48:57,720 --> 00:48:59,720
right now and

609
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:02,160
I will

610
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:04,720
Shoot I can't play that

611
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:07,320
Exert chosen

612
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:10,760
Have another one. All right, you know what? I'm not gonna exert my ink

613
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:14,840
Okay, but I am going to quest with Archimedes Wow

614
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:18,920
And what how much lore do you get from questing Archimedes Archimedes gets one lore?

615
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:23,540
Okay, so in quest another feature of the Larkana app is that it has a lore counter

616
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:29,360
So player two on your side Carlson you will get I will increment you you and have one lore

617
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:33,940
Is there anything that might happen where you guys get like 10 or 15 or 18 lore?

618
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:36,100
And

619
00:49:47,380 --> 00:49:49,380
It's possible that that would

620
00:49:49,940 --> 00:49:55,940
Accelerate the game a bit you've activated the action of the Domino's pizza trackers

621
00:49:55,940 --> 00:49:57,940
So none of you pass out to wearing this

622
00:49:57,940 --> 00:49:59,940
Multi-hour endeavor

623
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:08,500
So at that point then my my turn is over and it's Wiger's turn, okay, so I am going to draw a card

624
00:50:09,820 --> 00:50:11,820
I am going to

625
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:14,940
Turn something into ink. I think I'm going to turn

626
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:17,940
Cruella de Vil

627
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:23,380
Fashionable cruiser. Oh into ink. You want to take a look at that Sheridan? Uh, sure

628
00:50:24,180 --> 00:50:27,780
Um, oh wait, I already read this oh then never mind

629
00:50:31,220 --> 00:50:37,420
Okay, I'll put that one down so now I have to ink available I am going to exert this to ink so that I can

630
00:50:37,420 --> 00:50:38,740
Play a card

631
00:50:38,740 --> 00:50:40,740
The card I am going to play

632
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:43,500
is

633
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:46,500
I am going to play

634
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:52,140
Hercules hero in training. Okay, Hercules goes down to Hercules

635
00:50:52,220 --> 00:50:58,500
Okay, yeah, and his ink is drying so you cannot play him correct because he's not he's just chilling right when will his ink be dry

636
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:09,120
Wiger has summoned a snapshot of the character. Yes, and is it but he's painted him with his bruh his lumineer brush

637
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:11,120
Okay, I think wait

638
00:51:11,140 --> 00:51:17,740
Illumineer Illumineer Illumineer Illumineer. Okay. Yeah. All right. Okay, so I will draw a card. It's akin to imagine here

639
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:20,740
It's very yes similar. Okay, I will then

640
00:51:22,460 --> 00:51:23,900
Will use

641
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:28,660
This a boo. He's got a sword action. Uh-huh a boo from Aladdin

642
00:51:28,660 --> 00:51:29,780
I will put that in my ink well

643
00:51:29,780 --> 00:51:35,900
And then I will turn in this this goes back here and then I will turn my three cards and I will play

644
00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:43,060
One of Scott's favorite characters in fiction Peter Pan fearless fighter Wow, and I would like Scott

645
00:51:43,060 --> 00:51:45,060
Oh

646
00:51:48,260 --> 00:51:53,260
Scott's least favorite episode you wouldn't mind doing the voice and sort of the spirit of Peter

647
00:51:53,260 --> 00:51:55,260
I think the heart would appreciate it

648
00:52:07,460 --> 00:52:09,460
Okay

649
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:15,460
Nobody calls pan a coward and lives I'll fight you man-to-man with one hand behind my back

650
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:18,300
Wow, perfect. Wow

651
00:52:19,180 --> 00:52:21,180
Even through my protest

652
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:27,340
So so disgusting your turn is gross. My turn is gross. I cancel your turn. Okay, that's okay

653
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:33,000
And Peter remember Peter's ink isn't dry Scott. He's wet still. Yes, Peter's ink is still wet

654
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
So my ink is so wet

655
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:37,160
So what I'll do though is

656
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:43,000
Archimedes I'm gonna turn I'm in a quest with Archimedes Wow, and I'm gonna get another point on my little quest

657
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:50,000
So that's very exciting. Yeah, you're you're definitely in the lead now. You got to lore. I've yet to get on the board. Okay

658
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:52,560
Let's see

659
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:55,600
So I can draw card first thing I can do. Mm-hmm

660
00:52:57,240 --> 00:52:59,160
I have a

661
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:02,920
Just keep seven if it's seven you don't have to you can play but yeah

662
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:05,600
But I mean like that's like what you're starting hand sizes

663
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:09,400
But if you play enough cards on a turn you can go below. I only have four right now. Yeah

664
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:12,200
Okay, so

665
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:16,780
I'm going to turn a card into I'm gonna turn sleepy

666
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:22,080
From the seven dwarves from the seven dwarves find four ways to describe sleepy

667
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:25,480
What is this one? This one is nodding off?

668
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:30,400
Is that an action or is it a character? This is a character sleepy. Yeah, this is nodding

669
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:33,680
That's his title. So to put sleep mine to into my ink. Well

670
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:40,440
Yes, I just I really take pity on your listeners because I am bored to tears and I'm playing

671
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:48,880
You know if you get the variant sleepy he nods off with a cigarette in his hand

672
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:55,040
That can activate like a fire effect yeah, yeah that roofs made a straw

673
00:53:56,560 --> 00:53:58,560
Kidley

674
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:02,840
Okay, let's see. How many of these do I want to exert? Sorry. I was preemptive there

675
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:06,320
I think I do want to do something with Hercules so I can attack you right?

676
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:09,200
Yes, you can attack me. Yes

677
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:14,640
You can attack Archimedes because he is sort of prone. He's on a quest right now

678
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:17,160
Yeah, and and you can't attack pan yet

679
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:22,780
But you can attack Archimedes and then it basically is just you can attack with two and your defense sort of is three

680
00:54:22,780 --> 00:54:23,960
I know there's other terms for it

681
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:29,900
So you will deal two damage to Archimedes and he will get taken out of the game and you will be dealt to

682
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:35,160
Damage and you will be now injured but still in play. Yeah, so I am going to do that. I'm going to

683
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:43,280
Exert Hercules take Archimedes out of there. Okay, Hercules has killed Archimedes the owl. Yeah, that's great. Here we go

684
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:49,280
Now we're talking I want every the listener all think of Hercules from Disney. He just murdered Archimedes

685
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:53,280
You think with a sword or did he like take a big bite out of him?

686
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:55,920
I think this is the best way we can bring it to life for the listeners

687
00:54:55,920 --> 00:55:00,440
Wow, he just picked up an owl and took a big bite out of its stomach exactly

688
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:07,200
But Hercules took damage as well. Yes, correct. He has two damage Archimedes did deal him some damage

689
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:10,840
He got in some nibbles on Hercules leg. So he is hurt

690
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:18,600
We'll leave Hercules prone to any sort of pan attack I might want to do next game next round

691
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:25,120
Now damage there are like punch out just paper damage counters. We do have counters which

692
00:55:26,060 --> 00:55:30,000
Calculate I think damage in the app too. I don't know about that

693
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:35,920
But you can certainly deal it like that and just two little damage token put two little circles on top of the card

694
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:39,800
Yeah, and I believe that's how it outs how it works, right? The character does have a constant health pool

695
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:42,000
It's not that it resets every turn it doesn't reset

696
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:46,480
Yeah, there's can be healing action and stuff got it can do to bring him back

697
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:50,160
The other move I'm going to do is I'm going to now I'm self-conscious about the pronunciation

698
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:56,120
But I'm going to put down Gaston. Oh, there we go. That was fun. Yeah, yes. All right. Yes, and his ink is not dry

699
00:55:56,120 --> 00:56:00,840
It's not dry. So I have tapped my three ink so I can put him down. Got it

700
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:06,840
Okay, so I will now draw a card and I am going to reset my inks

701
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:12,000
And then I will take let's see here I will take

702
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:19,520
Let's see. I have another Abu. Okay, that will be going into the ink. There's two monkeys now in my ink. Wow. Well

703
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:26,880
But that's okay, and then I want I know it's on your side, but I want them both to devour pan so

704
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:31,080
To a booze eating a human. Yeah

705
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:34,920
He's a phrase not a forever dog

706
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:39,240
Okay

707
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:43,680
Okay, so I'm gonna put down now I'm gonna I am going to

708
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:51,000
Attack Hercules with yes. Okay, that is what's going to happen now pan has three attack and two defense

709
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:56,920
So yeah, Hercules has two. Okay. I mean this would this would also take out pan. Yes, it will

710
00:56:56,920 --> 00:57:01,400
Okay, so this is this is I'm sacrificing pan to get rid of Hercules. Oh, no

711
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:04,440
Pan has been taken off

712
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:06,520
but then I will

713
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:10,800
Activate my ink and I'm going to play Maleficent Sorceress

714
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:17,160
Play this character. You may draw a card night. So I've played her ink is not dry yet

715
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:19,840
But I get to draw another card right now

716
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:24,040
So I will have options as you know, can she turn into a dragon?

717
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:27,200
But can weger throw down a card that lights that dragon on fire?

718
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:36,080
It's a cut maintenance hours due to the end of a fiscal quarter

719
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:41,860
Is that card chairman Josh tomorrow a card in this game? And should he be maybe in our

720
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:49,760
Some daddy I got handsome daddy, I just want to cut in I opened my

721
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:55,760
60 count card starter deck which was gingerly wrapped in tissue paper

722
00:57:56,120 --> 00:57:59,040
Yes, the first two cards are two of the same

723
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:05,840
Ariel voiceless and her flavor text is just dot dot dot because she's voiceless

724
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:13,440
Next card was a shiny hologram Moana card pretty cool. Okay. Okay

725
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
pretty cool

726
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:19,700
So why are you a hologram Mickey Mouse? Oh hell yeah

727
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:25,440
Mike is it any extra trouble if you just add like kind of a shimmery sound effect every time a hologram

728
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:35,040
Yeah, if you don't mind maybe we could also just like insert like a local sports game in between when we're trying to decide to sort

729
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:37,040
of fill the

730
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:40,400
And he walks

731
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:42,920
Back to I go well, I think I'm gonna

732
00:58:43,560 --> 00:58:45,560
Jeannie is in my hand now

733
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:48,560
Let me take five minutes to figure out if I'm playing him or not

734
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:52,240
Are you don't are you doing with your time done? Yeah, okay great. So I'm gonna draw a card

735
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:56,100
Mm-hmm. I am going to take

736
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:58,600
this song card

737
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:02,780
Painting the roses red right and I'm going to put this into my inkwell

738
00:59:02,820 --> 00:59:09,680
So that is going to my ink pool. So now for ink I am going to now I have a

739
00:59:11,900 --> 00:59:17,820
Lefou card lefou lefou lefou I have a lefou card. I know this I'm just overthinking it now

740
00:59:19,820 --> 00:59:25,300
I got a lefou card which I can now the lefou has an ability that is loyal

741
00:59:25,300 --> 00:59:28,180
So if you have a character named Gaston in your play in play

742
00:59:28,260 --> 00:59:33,380
You play one less ink to play this character so I can play a lefou for one ink now

743
00:59:33,380 --> 00:59:37,120
So I'm going to tap one ink or exert one ink so I can get lefou in the play field

744
00:59:38,020 --> 00:59:41,380
That leaves me with three ink, which I am going to use

745
00:59:42,420 --> 00:59:44,420
to also get

746
00:59:46,100 --> 00:59:49,620
Sneezy into the play field shit so I can tap to

747
00:59:50,260 --> 00:59:57,140
Get Sneezy down and Sneezy has high defensive. He has not a particularly high attack, but he has for defense, which is pretty good

748
00:59:57,300 --> 01:00:00,260
Yeah, and then also I believe this is how this works

749
01:00:00,580 --> 01:00:07,380
So Gaston has a song a singer ability of five so he can sing a song up to a cost of five. Yes

750
01:00:07,940 --> 01:00:11,620
um, and a character with two or more can

751
01:00:12,740 --> 01:00:15,540
Uh can exert to sing this song for free

752
01:00:15,780 --> 01:00:20,980
So I'm going to exert I am going to exert to sing the song legend of the sword in the stone. Oh my god

753
01:00:21,220 --> 01:00:24,500
Um, which gives a chill. Oh wait. No, I don't want to do this. What is that? Oh, that's oh wait

754
01:00:24,980 --> 01:00:26,980
I'm just gonna do it anyway. I'm gonna do it anyway

755
01:00:27,300 --> 01:00:29,780
I didn't really know what this was doing, but I just was excited to sing a song

756
01:00:29,940 --> 01:00:34,420
So exert to sing the song legend of the sword of the stone, uh, which gives a character

757
01:00:35,140 --> 01:00:37,700
A chosen character gains challenger plus three

758
01:00:38,260 --> 01:00:44,980
Uh plus three while challenging but it doesn't really isn't really gonna do anything because neither cards have summoning sickness. Is anybody gonna sing anything?

759
01:00:45,300 --> 01:00:49,380
Well, you don't have Jason Jason. Could you sing the sword in the stone song? Jason Jason

760
01:00:50,340 --> 01:00:54,580
It's the sword in the stone, it's his future. Let's go

761
01:01:12,580 --> 01:01:17,700
Legend is sung when england was young and knights were brave and bold

762
01:01:18,420 --> 01:01:22,980
Okay, so kind of given given big ups to england, uh, you know

763
01:01:23,460 --> 01:01:26,180
I'm realizing also there's 11 and this needs to go separately my discard

764
01:01:27,060 --> 01:01:32,020
Hercules because this is out of play now. I just really so the ink cards. It's fun to play a song

765
01:01:32,660 --> 01:01:39,940
Card is just one ink. Yes, you don't need to look on the card and calculate ink via that correct

766
01:01:39,940 --> 01:01:40,980
Yes, okay

767
01:01:40,980 --> 01:01:46,500
That makes a lot more sense because i'm i was like, how are they remembering how much ink they have no functionally

768
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:50,420
What you're doing is whatever the cost of this card so like it could be like hey

769
01:01:50,580 --> 01:01:54,500
I'm getting a high ink card in this costs a lot of ink to play

770
01:01:54,740 --> 01:01:56,260
I'm getting it on turn one

771
01:01:56,260 --> 01:02:00,820
So the way to get utility out of now is by turning it into ink so they can use it to play other cards

772
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:05,540
Okay, but that also like means that you're taking a powerful card out of play for future turns

773
01:02:05,620 --> 01:02:10,980
And how do you calculate how much ink a card requires? So that's in the upper left hand corner there

774
01:02:11,700 --> 01:02:18,660
That the will number three oh, oh that's no that's yes, so that's the ink this is the strength and that's the health, okay?

775
01:02:19,540 --> 01:02:21,540
god this sucks

776
01:02:23,060 --> 01:02:27,620
I'm really caught between deciding i'm deciding should I try to learn?

777
01:02:28,180 --> 01:02:32,820
Or should I not because I won't need to know this by the end of today

778
01:02:33,540 --> 01:02:36,580
Well, hey, you have a you have a lot of time to decide. Oh man

779
01:02:36,740 --> 01:02:40,980
Yeah, we're still uh, we're it's still for this this race to 20 it is two to zero

780
01:02:44,180 --> 01:02:47,460
We're putting in the scores none of that got us closer no

781
01:02:47,860 --> 01:02:50,340
Are we are we now maybe in the running?

782
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:54,900
This could very well be longest episode ever just by sheer mechanics of what it is

783
01:02:55,620 --> 01:02:58,820
Pick up the pace once we get more cards into play because then you could when you have more ink you can

784
01:02:59,060 --> 01:03:02,420
Put bigger cards on the table that more ability to gain lore faster

785
01:03:02,580 --> 01:03:05,700
If I requested all three of these cards at once I would get four lore

786
01:03:05,860 --> 01:03:07,860
So, you know, he really should do it

787
01:03:07,940 --> 01:03:14,500
That's the thing if I put in if I if I try to pull a joke then I lose time points

788
01:03:15,140 --> 01:03:20,420
That makes it all go longer. That's my personal struggle. Oh, yeah, that's a good point. Uh, uh,

789
01:03:20,980 --> 01:03:22,100
okay, so

790
01:03:22,100 --> 01:03:24,100
Uh, I am going to

791
01:03:25,140 --> 01:03:31,780
I am going to uh, that's a good card, but i'm gonna take jafar keeper of secrets. Wow, and i'm gonna put it in my ink

792
01:03:32,580 --> 01:03:36,020
Um, and then I am going to play just like uncle sam

793
01:03:48,500 --> 01:03:51,140
Yeah, there's got to be a genie without his wrist gauntlets on

794
01:03:56,420 --> 01:04:00,900
And i'm going to then uh take my ink i'm gonna play

795
01:04:01,780 --> 01:04:08,180
Uh a tinker bell peter pan's ally card. Wow, I should have waited and not gotten rid of pan

796
01:04:08,660 --> 01:04:10,660
um, but then i'm also going to

797
01:04:11,460 --> 01:04:13,460
Uh quest maleficent

798
01:04:13,940 --> 01:04:15,220
And get one

799
01:04:15,220 --> 01:04:20,180
Okay, lore points. So scott. We're on the road here. I have three points. Okay. There are three. Okay

800
01:04:20,580 --> 01:04:23,620
Oh, wait, no, you didn't just get three points. No, you're at three points. All right

801
01:04:23,620 --> 01:04:27,540
I have a total so that's something. Okay. Okay. I am good. I'm done now. I gotta say just

802
01:04:27,860 --> 01:04:30,280
I am rooting for mike now purely functionally

803
01:04:31,080 --> 01:04:34,920
He's closest to the exit and therefore I am too. Well, we'll see how this goes

804
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:39,640
Okay, so it's my turn i'm gonna draw a card

805
01:04:40,680 --> 01:04:42,680
Oh, okay

806
01:04:44,120 --> 01:04:46,600
Did you guys like a hot robin hood card I don't know I yeah

807
01:04:47,720 --> 01:04:48,840
Ba-ba-boom

808
01:04:48,840 --> 01:04:52,440
Um, I don't know. No, I don't I don't know exactly what this means is the thing

809
01:04:52,520 --> 01:04:55,720
I'm I'm like reading it trying to figure out on the air here. Yeah

810
01:04:56,680 --> 01:04:58,680
You take your time. Uh

811
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:00,680
Okay

812
01:05:00,680 --> 01:05:03,960
Does it mean I get to double tap one of my characters? What does that mean?

813
01:05:04,120 --> 01:05:06,200
Yeah, that's what I wonder i'm gonna hold on this one

814
01:05:06,280 --> 01:05:09,240
In fact, I might just i'm just gonna turn this card into ink because I don't understand it

815
01:05:09,240 --> 01:05:12,280
We can try and figure it out. This is binding contract, right?

816
01:05:12,680 --> 01:05:16,600
I imagine is that is that a little mermaid thing? Is that where that's from? Oh, right

817
01:05:16,760 --> 01:05:20,520
Because that's kind of alive right like the pen comes up of its own volition

818
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:25,960
So this is a this lets you I believe double tap one of your characters. The ability is for all eternity

819
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:28,920
So I think you can just like exert a character twice, right?

820
01:05:29,320 --> 01:05:33,000
I think that but I don't know exactly if that's exactly what it is and what that means exactly

821
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,400
So i'm just gonna put that into my ink. So I now have five ink

822
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:37,720
I'm going to use

823
01:05:37,720 --> 01:05:41,560
Uh, one, two, three four ink to play the knock

824
01:05:42,280 --> 01:05:43,960
water spirit

825
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:45,960
And then the hell's that from?

826
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:51,720
Fantasia 2000 it might be I feel like we should know this but I among the four of us

827
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:55,560
But I don't know what the knock the knock not the group that did my sharona. Yeah

828
01:05:56,280 --> 01:05:58,360
It is cool art. Uh, no, okay

829
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:04,040
And the knock is not the neck

830
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:09,000
Is it the nick? No, it's not the nick either the dirty hospitals. No, no

831
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:15,240
Okay, not that either and it's not nick from knickknack the snowman pixar move, which is the first that comes is it?

832
01:06:15,240 --> 01:06:17,240
No, that's a horse. Okay

833
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:24,200
Um, I am going to now an exerted character. I can still go after right? Correct and tinkerbell has just been summoned

834
01:06:24,200 --> 01:06:30,760
So tinkerbell's not target not dry. Got it. Uh, I am going to use uh, uh gaston to take out maleficent

835
01:06:30,840 --> 01:06:37,400
Okay, so maleficent's out of play and gaston gets a minus two two minus two counter. Correct. Yes

836
01:06:38,040 --> 01:06:44,840
And maleficent's out. I am going to quest. Uh lafou and sneezy, uh, which gives me three lore

837
01:06:45,320 --> 01:06:47,320
So here we go. I'm on the board

838
01:06:49,560 --> 01:06:53,640
There's three moves great, yeah, wow, wow i'm in it, uh

839
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:56,200
The knock is from frozen two

840
01:06:56,520 --> 01:07:01,480
I just proved I never saw frozen two. It's into the unknown. That's the song from that

841
01:07:02,040 --> 01:07:07,320
Uh, uh, oh, okay. Here we go. All right. Well carlson is working through this this turn

842
01:07:07,800 --> 01:07:13,720
There is a restaurant I believe shared and i've heard you mention on on ptr, which is uh, romano's macaroni grill

843
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:14,840
Yeah, yeah

844
01:07:14,840 --> 01:07:19,880
I now I have a lot of fondness for romano's macaroni grill and so my ears perked up when when that was mentioned

845
01:07:19,960 --> 01:07:25,560
I believe the the two of you have not been to romano's is that correct or been it's been forever

846
01:07:25,720 --> 01:07:28,920
It's been a while since you've been in carlson. Have you been to a romano's never

847
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:31,960
I think look we'll figure out whatever it is

848
01:07:32,040 --> 01:07:36,600
But I think that could be a good candidate because we've never done a dough boys for a for a ptr dough boys episode

849
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:37,240
All right

850
01:07:37,240 --> 01:07:41,080
I think we might have to go down to carson california, but we we I think we it's doable

851
01:07:41,160 --> 01:07:45,400
That's the closest one. There used to be one in northridge. You remember that's probably been gone for a long time

852
01:07:45,400 --> 01:07:52,280
There is one right in the center of the orlando airport like right in the security that's the one to go to

853
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:55,340
Let's all do that then. All right. Yeah, meet you guys in orlando

854
01:07:56,840 --> 01:08:01,720
I will say if that doesn't come together my other pitch is to we all go to dean norris from breaking bad's

855
01:08:02,200 --> 01:08:08,600
Barbecue restaurant to mecula. I love that idea. Oh, I love barbecue. Yeah. Well, he's out there. He's out there

856
01:08:09,240 --> 01:08:11,080
Like alan hale jr

857
01:08:11,080 --> 01:08:15,240
Like just hanging out with everybody he's on instagram constantly talking come on down tonight

858
01:08:15,240 --> 01:08:19,560
Uh, you know, we got a you got a jerry jr over here playing guitar on the fatty

859
01:08:19,560 --> 01:08:20,280
We got a bunch of ribs

860
01:08:20,280 --> 01:08:21,640
We got a bill. Yeah, come on down

861
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:26,680
And then a couple months ago like they would constantly run out of barbecues. We'd be like hey everybody if you're coming down tonight

862
01:08:26,760 --> 01:08:28,760
Don't uh, we are out of ribs

863
01:08:29,560 --> 01:08:32,680
We're out of brisket. Uh, so sorry if you're making the trip

864
01:08:33,240 --> 01:08:34,440
That's so fun

865
01:08:34,440 --> 01:08:39,720
That is actually a standard feature of barbecue restaurants where they they run

866
01:08:40,920 --> 01:08:49,080
They've run out some I follow on instagram will put up stories like crossing off what they're out of as the night goes on

867
01:08:49,400 --> 01:08:55,560
I think they've taken care of their supply issues. I have not seen one of these do not come tonight messages from him in a while

868
01:08:55,560 --> 01:08:57,720
That's too bad though. He should make them anyway

869
01:08:57,960 --> 01:09:04,520
Yeah, there's more stakes to as an actor it's more fun to play sometimes he sings with the musician that's playing on the patio too

870
01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:09,080
Oh, hell. Yeah, man. So that seems like his vibe. Oh, yeah. Yeah, we gotta go. Okay

871
01:09:10,040 --> 01:09:14,120
We could do two episodes. Okay, gator. Were you because he was doing he was around funnier dial

872
01:09:14,280 --> 01:09:16,680
I think you'd already left at that point. I don't think I yeah

873
01:09:16,680 --> 01:09:22,120
I don't think I had a deal like the final season of breaking bad. I remember like the the day after his episode aired

874
01:09:22,840 --> 01:09:24,840
With his when his character was killed

875
01:09:25,160 --> 01:09:28,760
I was like on the phone with dean norris, or it was so weird

876
01:09:29,560 --> 01:09:33,400
It's such a strange thing to like everybody he's just whole thing. He's like yeah, we'll do a funny video about it

877
01:09:33,400 --> 01:09:36,840
It'd be great. It's like all right. Oh, did he makes it was it some video where he like comes back?

878
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:38,840
He like punches through the yeah, he comes back

879
01:09:39,320 --> 01:09:45,240
I helped out with the script and then I actually directed it. Okay. Yeah, lovely man. Okay

880
01:09:45,480 --> 01:09:50,360
So I'm going to I don't have any cards that will let me put ink down

881
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:57,000
So i'm gonna just activate my ink and put down bruno madrigal wow out of the shadows

882
01:09:57,940 --> 01:09:59,320
story-borne

883
01:09:59,320 --> 01:10:03,480
Um right there and then I will take tinker bell

884
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:07,400
I guess i'm

885
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:09,800
I guess i'm gonna quest with her

886
01:10:09,960 --> 01:10:15,320
Maybe this is a bad strategy. No, I think as we go here. Maybe I my strategy is poor is not thought out

887
01:10:15,400 --> 01:10:20,360
This is both of our of our first games and you know, like the ultimate goal is to accumulate 20 lord

888
01:10:20,360 --> 01:10:22,360
That gives you two more on the board

889
01:10:23,240 --> 01:10:28,360
And uh, so I I think it's I think it's a valid thing to do right now. Yeah, okay, so I am going to

890
01:10:29,240 --> 01:10:31,400
Your turn is done. Correct. All right, so i'm gonna

891
01:10:32,020 --> 01:10:36,760
Unexert all these characters the counters remain on gaston. I am going to unexert my ink

892
01:10:37,480 --> 01:10:40,280
And I am going to draw a card now

893
01:10:40,280 --> 01:10:44,920
My understanding is that adding to my ink pool is optional, right? Like you don't have it's not

894
01:10:45,320 --> 01:10:51,240
Tori each turn to it last time. Yeah, that's that that that's that's what I thought. Okay, so I am going what I'm going to do is

895
01:10:51,320 --> 01:10:53,320
I am going to

896
01:10:53,560 --> 01:10:55,480
Exert all of my ink

897
01:10:55,480 --> 01:10:57,480
And this will let me put down a five

898
01:10:58,440 --> 01:11:00,440
Cost card the queen

899
01:11:01,240 --> 01:11:07,080
Wow witch queen from snow white. Yes, the snow white queen. Wow, this is uh, the the this is

900
01:11:09,140 --> 01:11:14,280
Outstanding oh i'm sorry commanding presence is the title here and I think this character is so

901
01:11:14,840 --> 01:11:18,280
Has so much going on that it does not actually have flavor text

902
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:23,640
So whenever this character takes a breather jason chosen opposing character gets minus four

903
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:30,200
Health or attack this turn and chosen character gets plus four health this turn. I don't understand what that is exactly

904
01:11:30,280 --> 01:11:33,160
We'll figure it out. Um, okay. So what i'm going to do is

905
01:11:34,360 --> 01:11:36,440
Oh boy, bruno has a lot of health. Oh, yeah

906
01:11:37,240 --> 01:11:41,640
Okay, it's a powerful card. Yeah, that really is it doesn't make sense. He lives with rats

907
01:11:42,440 --> 01:11:44,440
The rats they'll give him strength

908
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:50,040
Can I now can I attack the same card with multiple cards I can do that, right?

909
01:11:50,680 --> 01:11:54,120
Oh, I that's good. I'll let you do it. I say yes, I think that's how it works

910
01:11:54,200 --> 01:11:59,000
I think I can I think I can i'll let you do it. Yeah, so i'm going to to take the knock here

911
01:11:59,080 --> 01:12:00,520
Oh my god the knock

912
01:12:00,520 --> 01:12:04,760
I'm going to take the knock and i'm going to exert the knock and i'm also going to exert

913
01:12:05,160 --> 01:12:07,560
Lefou and I am going to take out a bruno

914
01:12:07,960 --> 01:12:12,680
Well bruno isn't uh, you can only attack oh never mind because I didn't oh right, right, right

915
01:12:12,760 --> 01:12:16,600
Okay, then what i'm going to do instead is i'm going to uh, oh right, right, right

916
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:18,680
I'm gonna take this is what i'm gonna take gaston

917
01:12:18,840 --> 01:12:23,080
Uh who has a three attack and is almost out of health anyway and use that to take out tinkerbell

918
01:12:23,240 --> 01:12:27,560
So tinkerbell has been killed by gaston. Oh my god. So how do you do it? Gaston is also dead

919
01:12:28,600 --> 01:12:30,920
How he's a murder suicide it's a murder suicide

920
01:12:31,320 --> 01:12:33,320
Oh, yeah

921
01:12:34,280 --> 01:12:37,480
Well, I don't I don't I guess I shouldn't have all the characters eat each other

922
01:12:37,560 --> 01:12:43,320
But you know, he's uh, maybe if he's like reaching for a bunch of eggs and then grabs her accidentally and chokes on her

923
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:47,240
Yeah, yeah. Oh, okay. So he choked. Yeah, so they took them out took them both out. Yeah. Yeah

924
01:12:47,400 --> 01:12:47,960
Yeah, that makes sense

925
01:12:47,960 --> 01:12:52,360
You know i'm realizing was recommended in one of the tutorials i'm gonna start doing is that you have a different place for your

926
01:12:52,440 --> 01:12:56,600
Newly summoned characters to remember. Yeah, so i'm gonna start putting them at the lower deck here

927
01:12:56,600 --> 01:13:00,520
Are you doing anything? Are you questing? Are you going i'm going to quest the rest of these so lefou

928
01:13:01,080 --> 01:13:05,240
Sneezy and the knocker all questing and that gives me an additional four

929
01:13:06,760 --> 01:13:08,760
So i'm up to seven more

930
01:13:10,440 --> 01:13:15,640
I was gonna say if it goes any longer scott's gonna be double tapping himself in the lake

931
01:13:17,640 --> 01:13:20,600
So you can get the ambulance here to try to give away

932
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:26,360
Oh man, I am I you can't be mad at me if it's a medical emergency

933
01:13:26,520 --> 01:13:29,400
I'm mad about some of my some of my choices here, too

934
01:13:29,480 --> 01:13:32,200
Because I i'm i'm running low on a new ink

935
01:13:32,280 --> 01:13:37,240
I think it's funny by the way that that like i'm questing the grandeur of that term

936
01:13:37,240 --> 01:13:42,860
And then that means you turn the cards 90 degrees. Yeah. Wow a quest i'm exerting

937
01:13:47,240 --> 01:13:50,760
It's funny the specific because these all have all these games have the same sort of mechanics

938
01:13:50,840 --> 01:13:53,320
But they all have insist on a specific vocabulary

939
01:13:53,320 --> 01:13:58,380
It's like how zombie movies like none of them say zombies. They're all like, oh it's walkers or groaners

940
01:14:01,640 --> 01:14:04,680
Um, i'm just gonna pass i'm i'm done my turn is done

941
01:14:05,080 --> 01:14:08,680
Well, you should at least you should at least quest bruno and get a lore, right?

942
01:14:09,560 --> 01:14:14,600
But he's only got one lore and he leaves him vulnerable. No, i'm not going to so you're just gonna leave him as is

943
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:18,600
I'm leaving him as is so I so if a character does not get exerted. They are not vulnerable to attack

944
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:21,480
I don't believe that's the rule set. Okay. Got it. Hey bad news everybody

945
01:14:21,560 --> 01:14:25,160
All our ink has been exerted repeat all our ink has been exerted

946
01:14:25,240 --> 01:14:30,360
Don't come down got no more next weekend open up some cooking up some great new ink for you, but uh

947
01:14:31,720 --> 01:14:33,720
Okay, I just drew a card

948
01:14:33,800 --> 01:14:35,800
Yeah, um, I am going to uh

949
01:14:36,120 --> 01:14:39,400
Unexert all of my characters and then exert all of my ink

950
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,960
Um, jason loves to exert his ink. Oh, okay

951
01:14:45,160 --> 01:14:47,160
It's very comfortable with it

952
01:14:51,960 --> 01:14:56,600
Okay, I still don't quite understand how this questing works whenever this character quest

953
01:14:56,920 --> 01:14:59,800
Chosen opponent opposing character gets minus four this turn

954
01:15:00,040 --> 01:15:03,080
So I think what I could do you can attack I could I could use it on bruno

955
01:15:03,080 --> 01:15:07,720
But because bruno is just hanging at just idling bruno's not a target now

956
01:15:07,720 --> 01:15:10,280
We could be wrong about that rule, but that's just how we're going to play it for right now

957
01:15:10,600 --> 01:15:14,040
Okay, so I am all i'm going to do this turn then is i'm going to um

958
01:15:15,320 --> 01:15:16,760
I'm going to

959
01:15:16,760 --> 01:15:19,320
Get some more cards in the play field. I'm going to um

960
01:15:20,280 --> 01:15:22,600
Uh tap or exert

961
01:15:23,640 --> 01:15:25,640
1234 ink

962
01:15:26,120 --> 01:15:30,760
And then I am going to play out my hand cruella goes down. Wow another lefou goes down

963
01:15:30,920 --> 01:15:34,280
Wow, and i'll put those in this lower deck so we can see that they are badly

964
01:15:34,360 --> 01:15:38,280
They are summoning they're they have a summoning sickness and then i'm going to exert

965
01:15:38,760 --> 01:15:42,120
My four remaining cards, which gives me another two four

966
01:15:42,840 --> 01:15:44,600
six

967
01:15:44,600 --> 01:15:46,600
Lore so i'm up

968
01:15:46,920 --> 01:15:50,600
Wow, okay scott is exerting now, yes

969
01:15:52,360 --> 01:15:54,360
Very

970
01:15:54,360 --> 01:16:00,060
So it's funny. This is the it's the it's the cool fantasy fighting game. Oh, who's in it lots of lefou's

971
01:16:02,440 --> 01:16:07,160
Well, I think if you have like a better construct like if you don't just take an off-the-shelf starter deck

972
01:16:07,160 --> 01:16:11,960
And you curate a little bit more you can probably have a little bit more like creativity with your bill

973
01:16:12,760 --> 01:16:16,120
I will say i'm getting a lot of dupes in here. I would say I like playing the game

974
01:16:16,200 --> 01:16:18,200
It's i'm actually having fun. It is very fun

975
01:16:18,280 --> 01:16:23,480
It's just a pressure to uh make this sound good or entertaining to vocalize every internal thought

976
01:16:23,480 --> 01:16:27,640
You can't leave anything in your brain. Let me just say we knew going in this was going to suck

977
01:16:30,120 --> 01:16:33,240
And then also I think everyone who voted for also knew it was going to suck

978
01:16:34,360 --> 01:16:37,240
Grim fascination of just like I want to see what this actually is

979
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:44,760
I I think they should appreciate that club three is the place for experimentation for an episode that doesn't feel like any other episodes

980
01:16:44,760 --> 01:16:47,160
Yes, you're like you're the test lab

981
01:16:47,240 --> 01:16:51,560
I think we they will appreciate we've chosen to fall on the double-edged sword

982
01:16:51,880 --> 01:16:56,600
And add some jokes in here that are making the game longer. Yes. Yeah. Yeah

983
01:16:57,800 --> 01:17:04,200
Every single time we open our mouths. That's great. Um, okay, so I finally have a chance to add to my ink

984
01:17:05,160 --> 01:17:06,040
and

985
01:17:06,120 --> 01:17:08,760
Minnie mouse is going into the ink. Wow

986
01:17:09,720 --> 01:17:15,640
Minnie always classy it says and it says her fashion sense is always spot on and that's true. And now she's ink

987
01:17:16,520 --> 01:17:21,400
And you're not allowing jason to do that voice because it'll confuse things for you too much. No, you caught on

988
01:17:21,560 --> 01:17:23,560
Thank you for noticing that

989
01:17:23,880 --> 01:17:29,400
So what i'm gonna do is then i'm going to uh, uh turn all my ink on my six inks

990
01:17:29,400 --> 01:17:34,440
Oh boy, we got a big boy coming out putting madame medusa into play here

991
01:17:34,840 --> 01:17:35,960
Wow

992
01:17:35,960 --> 01:17:39,240
That it says the boss and then it says that terrible woman

993
01:17:40,200 --> 01:17:44,840
When you play this character banish chosen opposing character with three or less

994
01:17:45,480 --> 01:17:48,200
So I can get rid of let's say

995
01:17:49,160 --> 01:17:56,360
Right here. Sneezy's out. Sneezy is out madame medusa has killed him. Wow. R.I.P. Sneezy. R.I.P. Sneezy

996
01:17:56,840 --> 01:18:01,080
Um, so she's he had a tough life though. He might be happier out of his misery

997
01:18:01,240 --> 01:18:04,780
He's freed of his condition when he's sneezing he says kill me in between

998
01:18:09,560 --> 01:18:12,280
And then what i'm gonna do is i'm going to

999
01:18:13,080 --> 01:18:14,920
uh, uh

1000
01:18:14,920 --> 01:18:17,560
I'm going to attack lafou with bruno

1001
01:18:18,520 --> 01:18:21,400
I want to make this game longer is what i'm gonna do is gonna die

1002
01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:27,160
Yeah, and then he has to is it to r.i.p get dealt. Is that what it was? Is that how it works? You exert it

1003
01:18:27,880 --> 01:18:34,120
You exert him. Yeah, but it's two damage. Is that right for the yes. He no. No, he only does one damage

1004
01:18:34,120 --> 01:18:38,280
He has a health pool of two, but yeah, so he's only gonna take one there. Awesome. Sorry

1005
01:18:38,680 --> 01:18:41,880
I'm happy to go to the afterlife because gueston's already there

1006
01:18:46,760 --> 01:18:50,040
Uh, okay, so my turn is done. Wow. Okay

1007
01:18:50,760 --> 01:18:52,760
uh, i'm going to take

1008
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:56,760
Uh the queen and the knock and I am going to unexert them

1009
01:18:56,920 --> 01:19:03,400
I am moving my other lafou and my cruella up to the front line because they are no longer their ink is dried

1010
01:19:03,960 --> 01:19:07,480
Um, this guard pool is over here. You just played madame medusa, right?

1011
01:19:07,720 --> 01:19:12,440
Or do you do you want to roll back? I mean does rolling back the video help? I think you just I think you just I just

1012
01:19:12,920 --> 01:19:14,920
Or did I finish my turn?

1013
01:19:15,080 --> 01:19:19,400
I can't have finished my turn because my characters are unexerted. Yeah, I just attacked

1014
01:19:19,800 --> 01:19:23,560
I just got rid of that and I just attacked you attacked. Yeah, so I got rid of two of your cards

1015
01:19:23,560 --> 01:19:29,240
And I think it's you. Okay, you haven't finished your turn. Do you have to exert bruno to attack? I think you do, right?

1016
01:19:30,840 --> 01:19:34,280
Oh, so he should be like this. I think so. Yeah. Yeah, sorry. Sorry. Okay, you're right. Okay

1017
01:19:34,920 --> 01:19:39,080
All right. So it's my turn now. We took a little we had a little bit of a stop down for video

1018
01:19:39,560 --> 01:19:42,120
Uh, but I I think we were picking up in the right place

1019
01:19:42,920 --> 01:19:47,720
So I I am drawing a car. Oh wait, I had a card. Where the fuck did my card go? It's over there. Oh there

1020
01:19:49,400 --> 01:19:52,520
It was on the couch. Yeah, I moved we had like a little bit of a break

1021
01:19:52,520 --> 01:19:57,240
So I moved over there and I put my the one card in my hand over on the couch by my back. Okay

1022
01:19:57,880 --> 01:19:59,880
So I drew another card

1023
01:20:00,280 --> 01:20:03,880
And I I I am going to go ahead and play

1024
01:20:04,840 --> 01:20:11,400
Um popsicle. This is an item. This requires one popsicle ink. Oh, it's utopia popsicle

1025
01:20:11,400 --> 01:20:18,200
Yes, right. Uh, so so i'm tapping one ink exerting one ink and what this lets me do is it just lets me draw another card

1026
01:20:18,520 --> 01:20:20,520
So i'm going to draw another card

1027
01:20:22,040 --> 01:20:23,320
Uh, okay

1028
01:20:23,320 --> 01:20:25,320
Do you have to exert the popsicle?

1029
01:20:25,640 --> 01:20:28,760
Uh, I think the popsicle just gets played and he just goes away

1030
01:20:28,840 --> 01:20:33,160
He just goes to the discard pile after his effect. Okay. Okay, uh, but we could catch

1031
01:20:34,440 --> 01:20:36,440
um and then

1032
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:40,680
I get to I i'm going to let's see

1033
01:20:42,040 --> 01:20:44,040
Uh minus two

1034
01:20:44,680 --> 01:20:46,680
Uh, I don't know how this works

1035
01:20:47,640 --> 01:20:49,640
I'm so confused

1036
01:20:50,760 --> 01:20:55,960
So this is an item that I have I have one item in one character and i'm tempted to play the item

1037
01:20:55,960 --> 01:20:59,400
Then maybe we can just figure it out because I think this might let me do something on the board

1038
01:20:59,640 --> 01:21:04,680
So I am going to exert three remaining ink and i'm going to play the fang crossbow

1039
01:21:05,160 --> 01:21:09,420
The fang crossbow is an item and the chosen a chosen character

1040
01:21:11,240 --> 01:21:12,760
Gets

1041
01:21:12,760 --> 01:21:13,960
um

1042
01:21:13,960 --> 01:21:15,640
minus two

1043
01:21:15,640 --> 01:21:17,640
Oh, wait, does this require more ink?

1044
01:21:18,280 --> 01:21:20,440
What does this mean? Do you do you understand this carlson?

1045
01:21:20,840 --> 01:21:23,640
Uh, well, it's three after carefully. Yeah three inks

1046
01:21:23,720 --> 01:21:28,600
So I exerted the three ink to play it down right i've exerted one for the popsicle three more for that item

1047
01:21:28,680 --> 01:21:31,880
We're gonna have to send jason back to watch more videos. He's gonna have to watch this

1048
01:21:35,960 --> 01:21:38,200
I think that i'm confused as well

1049
01:21:38,280 --> 01:21:42,440
I don't know if you can play both of these at the same time or like both those things happen or one of them

1050
01:21:42,600 --> 01:21:47,080
You chose one of them i'm, not sure well I can either I can banish a chose a chosen dragon character

1051
01:21:47,080 --> 01:21:49,080
But you don't have any dragon so that's moot

1052
01:21:49,080 --> 01:21:53,160
But I do have careful aim which lets me give a chosen character minus two

1053
01:21:53,960 --> 01:21:58,520
Attack this turn, right? That's what that means minus two attack. I believe so. Yep

1054
01:21:58,600 --> 01:22:02,520
So what i'm going to do is i'm going to give the fang crossbow to the queen

1055
01:22:03,320 --> 01:22:05,320
The queen has four attack

1056
01:22:06,200 --> 01:22:11,320
And since uh bruno has minus one health from a pool of four

1057
01:22:11,720 --> 01:22:14,200
I can go ahead and and exert the queen

1058
01:22:14,520 --> 01:22:19,800
Right the queen now can attack with four and uh bruno will have minus two attack

1059
01:22:19,800 --> 01:22:23,480
Which means the queen will survive despite only having a health pool health of three

1060
01:22:23,800 --> 01:22:30,280
Uh with minus two minus one counters and bruno will and bruno is bruno's gone. The queen is killed bruno

1061
01:22:30,360 --> 01:22:32,680
Wow, wow, we don't talk about bruno anymore

1062
01:22:35,240 --> 01:22:37,240
Fang crossbows go to my discard pile

1063
01:22:37,640 --> 01:22:42,520
And then I am going to go ahead and exert my remaining cards or quest my yeah to quest them

1064
01:22:42,520 --> 01:22:45,000
So the nock lefou and carilla duvill

1065
01:22:45,640 --> 01:22:51,240
All get quested and that gives me an additional four lore to bring me up to 17. Oh my god. Wow

1066
01:22:53,800 --> 01:22:55,000
This you know

1067
01:22:55,000 --> 01:23:01,960
You mentioned the videos and uh, there was a video that was pretty good at explaining all this from the channel inc born heroes

1068
01:23:02,360 --> 01:23:08,200
But I just took a picture of like all the things you can do during a round and it's like six options

1069
01:23:08,280 --> 01:23:09,880
Yes, it's too many

1070
01:23:09,880 --> 01:23:14,280
you just did like four three or four things and i'm like

1071
01:23:15,480 --> 01:23:20,040
I I am so confused like i'm like, okay, so you can do multiple things

1072
01:23:20,600 --> 01:23:22,200
In your round. Yeah

1073
01:23:22,200 --> 01:23:27,720
basically the limiting factor is is the limiting factors are the number of cards in your hand and then the amount of ink you have

1074
01:23:27,720 --> 01:23:29,720
in your pool, yeah, so like

1075
01:23:30,280 --> 01:23:36,200
Because I only have four five ink I can't play a six six ink card carlson has more ink available. So

1076
01:23:36,920 --> 01:23:41,480
Yes, well, let's see if I can add even more ink to this score by the way 17 to five

1077
01:23:41,640 --> 01:23:48,280
Yeah, i'm i'm getting destroyed. Yeah early lead and then well my beloved mini is going to also go back into the ink

1078
01:23:48,280 --> 01:23:50,280
Well, wow, she's back my one

1079
01:23:50,760 --> 01:23:55,480
Uh, it doesn't matter how many you play but she's got the ability to be turned into ink. What's her description?

1080
01:23:55,720 --> 01:24:00,200
This is the same one it's her fashion sense is always spot on get it because of the spots

1081
01:24:00,840 --> 01:24:07,640
um, I wonder if there's like there's like a canon justification or explanation for what's happening when a character gets turned into ink because

1082
01:24:07,640 --> 01:24:13,720
It sounds kind of grim because they can't come back from being they can't know once they're once they're turned into ink for the remainder

1083
01:24:13,720 --> 01:24:20,840
Of that that play session. Well, they're not the real characters. They're just right sketches of from our illumineers paint brush

1084
01:24:21,480 --> 01:24:27,880
So in my mind since they're not dry yet, they sort of just melt into just a general ink pool

1085
01:24:28,200 --> 01:24:30,280
Yes, and then when they're over here on the board

1086
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:35,560
they sort of solidify in a way where the ink is there and like it now it's like kind of stuck to the

1087
01:24:36,760 --> 01:24:42,440
God's easel or whatever. Got it. It's kind of like sperms that don't make it all the way

1088
01:24:42,840 --> 01:24:48,040
You could call it. Yeah, that's true. That's a good. Yeah, it's like illuminating illuminating sperms. Yeah

1089
01:24:51,160 --> 01:24:53,160
I'll try not to think about it

1090
01:24:53,160 --> 01:24:58,360
So so many is just kind of like dissolving into a pool of illumineer sperms just picture that

1091
01:24:58,680 --> 01:25:03,400
Yeah, yeah, and mike just has a lot of illumineer sperm like lied at

1092
01:25:03,800 --> 01:25:11,000
I got seven sperm. I've just turned over. Um, and I would like to play ursula. Wow power hungry

1093
01:25:12,040 --> 01:25:15,640
And that's her she's got two. She's got seven cost card. Look at that. Yeah

1094
01:25:16,280 --> 01:25:18,280
So what i'm gonna do then?

1095
01:25:18,600 --> 01:25:21,640
With madame medusa i'm trying to should I

1096
01:25:22,680 --> 01:25:28,760
Feel so hopeless to just get one lore because like what am I even doing? Maybe I should just attack

1097
01:25:29,560 --> 01:25:33,240
It's like a free throw every little bit helps. I guess that's true

1098
01:25:34,280 --> 01:25:36,280
Let me um

1099
01:25:37,240 --> 01:25:39,240
Attack

1100
01:25:40,440 --> 01:25:42,440
Jason

1101
01:25:43,400 --> 01:25:45,400
Oh

1102
01:25:46,360 --> 01:25:50,840
He's the corner of the card on his face lefou i'm attacking i'm gonna take lefou out

1103
01:25:51,720 --> 01:25:54,840
Um, and I will be dealt two or no. He's got only got one

1104
01:25:54,920 --> 01:25:59,880
So I only got one. Yeah there because lefou is out there two lore get two lore on a quest

1105
01:25:59,960 --> 01:26:01,960
still 17.5, but you got a

1106
01:26:02,600 --> 01:26:04,600
Damage I took lefou out

1107
01:26:04,680 --> 01:26:09,240
All right, what i'm noticing lefou is a seems a pretty a lore efficient card because he only costs

1108
01:26:09,640 --> 01:26:10,680
Right, he's got two ink

1109
01:26:10,680 --> 01:26:11,000
Yeah

1110
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:17,320
But he costs one less ink if you have gaston in there and then you can he gets two lore every time you exert him so

1111
01:26:18,680 --> 01:26:22,040
Versus like a character like the nock that's a more expensive car, but only gives you one lore

1112
01:26:22,120 --> 01:26:28,040
Yeah by exerting madame medusa. Did you gain any lore? No, you only get I haven't quested with her

1113
01:26:28,360 --> 01:26:31,480
So so so exerting only gets you lore

1114
01:26:32,200 --> 01:26:34,200
This is so dumb

1115
01:26:34,920 --> 01:26:39,160
Exerting only gets you lore if you if that's the only thing you do with that character

1116
01:26:39,320 --> 01:26:44,520
If you're trying to use that character for another purpose, then like that's that's what their their attention is at. Yeah

1117
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,160
Okay, uh, all right. So you're done with your turn. Yeah

1118
01:26:47,800 --> 01:26:49,800
All right. I'm going to

1119
01:26:49,960 --> 01:26:53,480
Uh, yeah, I mean, I this is the thing i'll play out the turn but i'm going to win this turn

1120
01:26:53,720 --> 01:27:00,520
Uh, so i'm going to unexert all of my cards. I have three characters on the board karela the queen and the nock

1121
01:27:01,320 --> 01:27:02,760
I drew a card

1122
01:27:02,760 --> 01:27:04,600
Which is painting the roses red

1123
01:27:04,600 --> 01:27:09,480
I am going to turn that into ink and then exert all of these just for the sake of adding to the board

1124
01:27:09,960 --> 01:27:14,120
I'm going to add on gaston intellectual powerhouse. This is a gaston variant

1125
01:27:14,520 --> 01:27:18,200
Which has developed brain when you play this character look at the top three cards in your deck

1126
01:27:18,440 --> 01:27:21,160
You may put one in your hand put the rest in the bottom of your deck in any order

1127
01:27:21,160 --> 01:27:26,840
So i'm going to go take these three out. I have i'll just show it everyone. I have another nock

1128
01:27:27,400 --> 01:27:29,880
I have a dock knock in the dock

1129
01:27:30,840 --> 01:27:33,720
Those guys are going to the bottom of my deck and i'm going to keep dopey

1130
01:27:34,440 --> 01:27:39,720
But dopey is just going to remain in my hard my my my hand where he will uh, the card will remain in my hand

1131
01:27:39,720 --> 01:27:45,480
That's why I meant like I conflated the hand and card into hard. It sounded weird. Dopey's gonna remain hard

1132
01:27:48,600 --> 01:27:50,600
And I am going to turn

1133
01:27:50,600 --> 01:27:55,880
Uh all of exert all these characters and that is going to take me all the way up to 21 lore

1134
01:27:56,840 --> 01:28:02,440
It means I win this inaugural jeez that was pretty fast actually

1135
01:28:03,240 --> 01:28:06,600
For all the great for the the boy it seemed at the beginning

1136
01:28:06,920 --> 01:28:09,240
It's really like that could be at a three hour

1137
01:28:09,720 --> 01:28:15,320
Pace but maybe but I don't know like I don't know any I don't understand a lot of what I just saw

1138
01:28:15,480 --> 01:28:19,880
But it sure seems to me like wyger kicked ass here. He did. I mean that was a fit

1139
01:28:20,440 --> 01:28:22,440
What 21 to 5 is the final?

1140
01:28:22,440 --> 01:28:27,160
But we also it's this is the thing is like we're both like figuring out how to play the game and the one thing

1141
01:28:27,160 --> 01:28:31,560
I know from from collectible card games is that like you kind of want to control like the board

1142
01:28:32,040 --> 01:28:33,320
Uh, because there is an ultimate goal

1143
01:28:33,320 --> 01:28:38,040
And if you're just trying to race to i'm going to try to burst down my opponent's health in a normal game

1144
01:28:38,040 --> 01:28:40,040
Or here i'm going to try to get my lore score up

1145
01:28:40,200 --> 01:28:45,080
What will happen is that your opponent against the advent can can have card advantage and have just more cards available

1146
01:28:45,240 --> 01:28:51,160
So they can take more actions so like here just because I have four cards and and and carlson has two

1147
01:28:51,800 --> 01:28:54,520
I I think he just has fewer options for what he can do during

1148
01:28:55,640 --> 01:28:59,080
If it is a pre-made deck also, I think they obviously it was a good

1149
01:28:59,560 --> 01:29:05,160
They they went because this was one of the pre-made starter decks. Yes. Yeah, because I started to get on very uneven

1150
01:29:05,960 --> 01:29:10,120
When I was drawing my cards as well. I'm blaming it on the fact that I put my own deck together as well

1151
01:29:10,200 --> 01:29:13,240
I would say that's part of what's fun about these you can do that

1152
01:29:13,240 --> 01:29:16,600
You can you can kind of go rogue and and and do your own thing

1153
01:29:16,600 --> 01:29:20,280
But yeah, that that's that you can actually end up with something more optimized

1154
01:29:20,280 --> 01:29:23,720
But some of these starter decks, I think it's just a lot more newbie friendly. Yeah, I mean look at

1155
01:29:24,440 --> 01:29:30,520
There's all these cards that went like goofy in a weird like squirrel flight suit kind of a thing rocks nice all these different

1156
01:29:30,600 --> 01:29:34,200
So there I I think I was also putting cards in that just looked fun as well

1157
01:29:34,680 --> 01:29:39,480
So I wasn't the strategy i'm gonna learn over time when we have our weekly men's lorcona night

1158
01:29:39,800 --> 01:29:43,480
We'll turn this into a regular thing and it's not women not allowed

1159
01:29:44,440 --> 01:29:47,080
You're gonna be pushing so many women away

1160
01:29:50,920 --> 01:29:55,320
Don't you play lorcona women are not allowed but stogies are must

1161
01:29:56,600 --> 01:30:03,800
Oh, yeah, so it's gonna stink and we're not gonna be able to breathe properly our lorcona cards are gonna smell like stogie smoke

1162
01:30:04,520 --> 01:30:07,080
Yeah, so he hates cigar. This is a real runner

1163
01:30:07,160 --> 01:30:12,040
You've been many times you see i've never heard you say a word with more hate in your heart than stogie

1164
01:30:12,040 --> 01:30:17,000
Oh, it's from growing up on the jersey shore beaches when someone would just smell

1165
01:30:17,720 --> 01:30:22,120
It just it just travels on the wind. It just smells so bad

1166
01:30:22,280 --> 01:30:27,880
It I don't love second hand cigarette smoke either but like cigarettes first hand

1167
01:30:28,280 --> 01:30:30,520
Oh first hand cigarette is great. Yeah

1168
01:30:31,960 --> 01:30:39,800
Uh the smell stogies, uh, I do like uh, this starter deck has multiple dingle hopper cards, which is of course

1169
01:30:40,440 --> 01:30:45,320
The fork from little mermaid and what what does the dingle hopper do exactly?

1170
01:30:45,640 --> 01:30:49,480
Uh remove up to one damage from a chosen character

1171
01:30:49,560 --> 01:30:54,120
Oh, so it just lets you heal so I could use the dingle hopper on the queen and get rid of one of these minus ones

1172
01:30:54,760 --> 01:31:00,680
Um, if I have a cut or a wound, I don't want no dingle hopper coming for it. Well, that's just a fork

1173
01:31:01,640 --> 01:31:06,120
Going to an urgent care and they're like well, uh, what else I can give you is

1174
01:31:06,760 --> 01:31:08,760
Advil and a dingle hopper

1175
01:31:10,360 --> 01:31:12,600
Sounds like a medical term like six hundred dollars

1176
01:31:13,160 --> 01:31:18,760
Um, if we had to sort of post game it and mike maybe I like I don't know if you want to like kind of assume

1177
01:31:18,840 --> 01:31:22,920
the like defeated, you know basketball post game like slumped with

1178
01:31:23,400 --> 01:31:28,440
uh towel around your neck like if I uh, you know if I can just throw out a like, uh,

1179
01:31:29,160 --> 01:31:31,160
Uh, well, I don't know. What do you think happened there?

1180
01:31:31,960 --> 01:31:36,280
Well, I think I need to have more cards that are uh, uh have the ability to be turned into ink

1181
01:31:36,680 --> 01:31:40,840
I think I need to have more because you know these these cards you can't without the border on them

1182
01:31:41,160 --> 01:31:46,280
But these cards with the border so I want to make sure that I have enough at least one card per hand

1183
01:31:47,080 --> 01:31:50,520
Or any time I have a turn, excuse me that I can do that with

1184
01:31:51,080 --> 01:31:56,360
Um, yeah, that's number one one thing I noticed about the starter deck is that almost every one of these cards can be turned

1185
01:31:56,360 --> 01:31:59,320
Into ink. Yeah, that's like it's just like that border is like so key

1186
01:31:59,480 --> 01:32:03,640
Which order the so you see like it's got like the thicker sort of outline

1187
01:32:03,800 --> 01:32:04,440
So yeah

1188
01:32:04,440 --> 01:32:10,120
This this is actually judy hops here as opposed to the hades card that you have the judy hops can be turned into ink

1189
01:32:10,120 --> 01:32:13,720
But hades because it does not have the thicker border cannot be coming. Oh, yeah

1190
01:32:14,360 --> 01:32:18,920
Um, and I also think I maybe I was too aggressive in the early goings, you know, I was too attacky

1191
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:20,280
I was too questing

1192
01:32:20,280 --> 01:32:25,000
I should have maybe built up more of sort of an army of things had more cards on the table all at once

1193
01:32:25,480 --> 01:32:31,640
Because ultimately when weiger was playing, you know four cards once I think he was able to get a big lead going when he could

1194
01:32:31,880 --> 01:32:33,880
so your advice to players

1195
01:32:34,600 --> 01:32:38,440
Out there would be to not uh blow your load

1196
01:32:39,880 --> 01:32:42,200
So to speak, I think that's right. Yes, right

1197
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:47,880
I I think that that part of that might carlson might come from because you've gotten so many reps in marvel snap

1198
01:32:47,960 --> 01:32:51,160
And again, that's just like a much faster game. It's like a six turn game

1199
01:32:51,640 --> 01:32:56,440
And so I think just the pace of that record like, you know, usually rewards more aggression

1200
01:32:56,440 --> 01:33:01,000
Yeah, this is more of an a methodical. Yeah. Yeah, it's a thinking man's game. Not like that marvel snap is

1201
01:33:01,800 --> 01:33:07,160
Very much like aggro sort of aggressive type of a person that gravitates like my natural

1202
01:33:07,880 --> 01:33:13,000
Yeah, it's a lot of attacking too. It's a lot of attacking there are like different

1203
01:33:13,640 --> 01:33:19,640
Elements in marvel snap. We didn't even get into the inky the six types of caught the amber

1204
01:33:19,880 --> 01:33:26,200
Amethyst emerald ruby sapphire steel. Well, you can only have two types in one deck two types in one deck. Yes

1205
01:33:26,440 --> 01:33:30,680
Yeah, I have an amma am of what is the word amethyst amethyst and ruby deck

1206
01:33:30,680 --> 01:33:33,000
This is again like, you know, because they they they yeah

1207
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,320
They they want to all have their own sort of flavor

1208
01:33:35,400 --> 01:33:39,320
But like they they all pretty much all these have some sort of coloration system

1209
01:33:39,400 --> 01:33:45,240
But yeah, I have like a blue yellow deck and I don't know which colors those are exactly I guess sapphire and like topaz or whatever

1210
01:33:45,240 --> 01:33:47,240
They say whatever they call yellow

1211
01:33:47,240 --> 01:33:55,800
Uh, yeah, what did I just call yellow saffron? Who knows amber amber amber. There you go. Yeah

1212
01:33:56,360 --> 01:33:59,800
Um, well, do you are you satisfied with the degree we got into it jason?

1213
01:34:00,360 --> 01:34:06,840
Oh very great. Wow. I think we really covered some inks there. Uh, why your post game? How does it feel?

1214
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:10,200
I feel great. I mean like look I was I was ready for defeat

1215
01:34:10,360 --> 01:34:13,320
I I know I figured carlson would come prepared

1216
01:34:13,400 --> 01:34:17,720
So, you know and I also just was like figured like it's it's a it's both of our first games

1217
01:34:17,720 --> 01:34:20,920
So we don't really you know, we're anything that we're learning. Yeah

1218
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:27,160
Yeah, we're but but I feel pretty good because I just I feel like I was I have a much better understanding of how it actually

1219
01:34:27,240 --> 01:34:32,760
All works now mechanically. Um, and I also just had a lot of fun. I thought this was a lot more fun than I expected

1220
01:34:32,840 --> 01:34:35,000
Yeah, yeah, I like I like the guy I would like to yeah

1221
01:34:36,280 --> 01:34:38,280
For us, yeah, not for anyone listening to it

1222
01:34:38,520 --> 01:34:45,640
Sometimes you got to do episodes for you we there was talk there was talk of

1223
01:34:46,280 --> 01:34:49,560
We should have bet something at the start when we didn't end up betting. Oh, yeah

1224
01:34:49,640 --> 01:34:55,400
We're all about betting now. We'd love to bet and I was I totally forgot about it too because I was rolling around different bets

1225
01:34:55,960 --> 01:35:01,960
Uh, um, I was like, well, is there a scenario or like if I lose we lose jason to two episodes of doughboys for a week

1226
01:35:01,960 --> 01:35:03,160
or something

1227
01:35:03,160 --> 01:35:05,160
Um, i'd love that

1228
01:35:08,680 --> 01:35:11,560
I guess he did not an exchange month. He does. Yeah treat month

1229
01:35:12,440 --> 01:35:18,120
There was uh, you know, there was some talk of a doughboys episode months ago when we were texting of uh an episode about

1230
01:35:18,680 --> 01:35:22,440
Uh chicken wings and paul mccartney's wings. Oh, yeah. Oh boy

1231
01:35:22,520 --> 01:35:26,120
So yeah, any of those would have been a good good bet to make but we didn't do it

1232
01:35:26,120 --> 01:35:30,520
So well, I think there was also the next next time there was also a little bit of like I I

1233
01:35:31,160 --> 01:35:36,360
I already feel like I kind of took over your format for this episode this this kind of self-indulgent episode

1234
01:35:36,440 --> 01:35:39,720
So I was like, I don't know if I want to be like the stakes like I have another right thing that I want

1235
01:35:39,720 --> 01:35:40,920
You to do on the pot, you know

1236
01:35:40,920 --> 01:35:43,640
I mean, so I was like, I think I think it was fine just for it just to be a friendly

1237
01:35:43,960 --> 01:35:47,720
Yes, I agree. I agree. I agree. Yeah. Yeah, we don't have to lose jason for right

1238
01:35:50,360 --> 01:35:55,320
As he would not be allowed to appear on our show for like like there would be no that would have been the rules of it

1239
01:35:55,400 --> 01:35:57,720
Wow, the doughboys are reviewing candy apples

1240
01:36:00,760 --> 01:36:02,760
The doughboys are reviewing big lollies

1241
01:36:02,760 --> 01:36:04,760
Yeah

1242
01:36:05,320 --> 01:36:07,880
In a deeply negative episode stogies

1243
01:36:09,640 --> 01:36:13,880
It's kind of you put it in your mouth it's kind of food if you stretch your definition

1244
01:36:14,680 --> 01:36:16,840
I understand jason's by the way distinction

1245
01:36:16,840 --> 01:36:21,240
I understand your distinction between cigarette guys and cigar guys because it's a cigarettes

1246
01:36:21,320 --> 01:36:26,680
That's a working class thing and the scar guys like I just think of like tom selleck on cigar aficionado magazine

1247
01:36:26,760 --> 01:36:29,640
It's all like nra guys like it's like it became like a really

1248
01:36:30,200 --> 01:36:35,240
Right-wing, you know affectation like rudy. Giuliani is like a big cigar guy. This is like the worst fucking yeah

1249
01:36:37,720 --> 01:36:41,960
Yeah, so I don't know I think if jason got a stogie in his mouth he might can reconsider though

1250
01:36:42,360 --> 01:36:45,000
Yeah, I think he might like it. Let's see. Is that a future?

1251
01:36:45,720 --> 01:36:48,200
Find a stogie jason would like oh, no

1252
01:36:51,400 --> 01:36:54,280
Just what I need more complications for my health

1253
01:36:54,760 --> 01:36:59,240
Excellent. Well, look we've now that we've thrown it out there. You're gonna unfortunately have to do it

1254
01:36:59,320 --> 01:37:02,540
Oh shit, just telling your doctors that you've taken up cigars

1255
01:37:04,360 --> 01:37:11,080
Yeah, going down the list like you drink like, oh maybe one or two beers a month, right they're like you're a smoker. Well, I

1256
01:37:11,780 --> 01:37:13,780
unfortunately a stogie guy

1257
01:37:16,040 --> 01:37:21,880
Can you stop that uh, we would really prefer you did not your stogie intake I can't I can't

1258
01:37:23,480 --> 01:37:25,480
How many big lollies a month

1259
01:37:26,440 --> 01:37:28,440
Oh jesus

1260
01:37:28,680 --> 01:37:35,480
Like the fantasy of like jason goes to visit jason goes to dole boys camp for a couple days and then it's like pleasure island

1261
01:37:35,880 --> 01:37:37,880
You make them play pool and smoke

1262
01:37:41,240 --> 01:37:45,160
I think there's also an element of like when you become a cigar guy you have to go to like cigar

1263
01:37:45,460 --> 01:37:51,240
lounges like that's like you hang out in places with other guys who are smoking big stogies and that's like city walk and

1264
01:37:52,200 --> 01:37:57,800
Oh, that's right. Yeah. Yeah. Well you start all only wanting to hang out with people with the same like kind of weird mustard coloration

1265
01:38:03,720 --> 01:38:07,240
Well, hey I I think it was fun and I boy, you know

1266
01:38:07,640 --> 01:38:11,960
As soon as I realized that it wasn't just one point every one lore every turn

1267
01:38:12,360 --> 01:38:15,800
I my spirits really picked up and I had a blast

1268
01:38:16,520 --> 01:38:24,600
Uh, uh, so thank you for bringing this to us, uh, nick wyger you survived podcast the ride your bravery saved our podcast

1269
01:38:24,840 --> 01:38:31,480
Well done freedom fighter. Thank you. We get to give the guest the uh, the most emotional line in uh, in all of theme park

1270
01:38:32,040 --> 01:38:34,680
Uh, it's exit through the gift shop anything you want to plug?

1273
01:38:45,160 --> 01:38:52,360
This is the first uh, uh non a parking garage episode. Yeah, so we broke we broke the pattern there

1274
01:38:52,760 --> 01:38:57,960
I don't know if that I don't know if that changes the rules or if only behind only in the crazy experimental club

1275
01:38:58,040 --> 01:39:03,000
Three only in the double paywall. Can I talk about anything other than a parking garage? I think that's fair

1276
01:39:04,040 --> 01:39:09,480
It's like when wrestlers it's like if you lose you can never challenge for this belt again. Yes, you know

1277
01:39:09,960 --> 01:39:12,520
Just an insane complication. Yeah

1278
01:39:13,080 --> 01:39:14,280
Yeah

1279
01:39:14,280 --> 01:39:19,880
We should have a next time we play larkana. It should be a career versus hair match. Oh, yeah podcast career. Yeah

1280
01:39:21,800 --> 01:39:28,040
Oh man, what would I do? Jesus christ? Yeah, no move back to game video game testing. Yeah
