1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,840
Forever.

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:03,680
Dog.

3
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:08,640
Warning, the following podcast is for family only.

4
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:12,120
If you ain't family, stop listening.

5
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:13,040
But guess what?

6
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,640
You're all family.

7
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:17,880
So grab the nearest helicopter that's as big as you

8
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,160
and hold on tight, cookie puss.

9
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,900
It's fast and furious supercharged

10
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:25,440
on Podcast The Ride or Die.

11
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,580
["Diamond City"]

12
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,040
2021, baby, Podcast The Ride.

13
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,880
The only theme park podcast where we live our lives

14
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,880
a quarter mile at a time.

15
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:58,440
And for those 90 minutes to say three,

16
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,280
three and a half hours, we're free.

17
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,040
I'm Jason Sheridan, Scott Gardner here.

18
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,400
Yeah, Scott Gardner's here and I'm so happy

19
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,720
because my demand for the first episode

20
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,740
and for this topic was that Jason kick it off.

21
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:15,780
Cause I knew Mike and I would only be pretenders.

22
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:16,960
I knew we wouldn't do it right.

23
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,560
And Jason, you did it right.

24
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,400
You did it right, bud.

25
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,000
You did, thank you so much.

26
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,860
Mike Carlson also here.

27
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:25,680
I am here, yes.

28
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,820
And I want to say, Jason, you're not my friend.

29
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,380
You're my family.

30
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,220
Family, salute familiar.

31
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:33,380
Both you and Scott are not friends, you're family.

32
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:35,860
Well, we don't have friends, we have family.

33
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:38,140
That's right. That's how it goes.

34
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:42,900
So here we are, 2021, new year,

35
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,100
new season of Podcast The Ride.

36
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:45,920
What do we do?

37
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,760
Are we in season?

38
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,600
Do we do seasons?

39
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,420
I don't think we do.

40
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:49,740
I think it's just one big, we don't ask.

41
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,060
I don't know, let me do.

42
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,840
Yeah, so we, okay, not new season,

43
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:57,320
new year, new fun, new thrills,

44
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:00,640
still at home individually for now.

45
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,320
Yes, that part has not changed.

46
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,280
Doesn't mean we're not family, though.

47
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,880
Hey, with this holiday season,

48
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,640
families had to come together on Zoom,

49
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,440
and we're gonna be doing it for,

50
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,840
till November, when the fuck is this over?

51
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,440
Perceivable future.

52
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,200
Every article has a wildly different timeline

53
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,840
and answer for you.

54
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,400
We just better not be saying,

55
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,360
all right, baby, 2022, we're back.

56
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,180
Still Zoom, but it's pretty much gonna work.

57
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,680
We're really, they're vaccinating 150 people now,

58
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,160
a week in Los Angeles,

59
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,000
and we think they're gonna get it up to 175,

60
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,160
so we're gonna be on the list,

61
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,120
hopefully at the end of 2022.

62
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,760
Hopefully that doesn't happen, I'm just saying.

63
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,720
But we, who knows, who knows?

64
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,880
We're all gonna have to get jobs as doctors

65
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,800
just to get on the list.

66
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,920
Yes, okay, I don't wanna really derail

67
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,000
the whole episode by this, but I have wondered,

68
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,320
and I've thrown it out to you guys,

69
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:05,400
or floated the idea of, is there an opportunity

70
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,720
for me to use my checking abilities

71
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,080
to get the vaccine early?

72
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,640
I don't know that there is yet,

73
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:14,160
but I've seen different people go like,

74
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,960
hey, we wandered into that CVS,

75
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,960
and we just got a vaccine,

76
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,520
because they were running,

77
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,240
like the fridge was gonna,

78
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,160
it was gonna go bad in the fridge, essentially.

79
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,680
So they were just like, they saw five people,

80
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,260
and they go, hey, you want these vaccines?

81
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:29,040
Because we gotta get them now before they go bad,

82
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:29,880
and people got them.

83
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,540
So I was like, is there a way I can get on,

84
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:36,080
in the same way that I'm on PS5 sales tracker

85
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,480
that knows when a PS5 goes on sale,

86
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,120
is there a vaccine tracker Twitter account

87
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,880
that will send me alerts, and that'll say,

88
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:48,480
the CVS in Palmdale has 12 vaccines,

89
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,840
you should head up there.

90
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,080
That's a good idea, because in Washington, D.C.,

91
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,080
a bunch of the giant supermarkets,

92
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,640
the giant brand supermarkets are like,

93
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,960
hey, if we have extras at the end of the day,

94
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,840
first come first serve for vaccines.

95
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,680
And look, I'm sure I said this on the story,

96
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,440
you always wait around.

97
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,920
I was in line to get free Rolling Stones tickets

98
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,240
when they played the Echo Plex, which is a tiny place,

99
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:15,880
and I left the line early, and I found out later

100
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,960
they were just handing them out to people on the street,

101
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,640
because there weren't enough people in line.

102
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,160
And I learned a valuable lesson that day,

103
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,480
you always just hang around.

104
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:25,000
This lesson might save your life now.

105
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,840
Yes.

106
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:26,800
Very valuable lesson.

107
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,080
So well, it depends.

108
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,600
We don't know what's gonna happen past these,

109
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,860
sort of the most important groups to get vaccinated,

110
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:36,400
and if beyond this initial point,

111
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,120
they start doing it via boarding groups,

112
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,400
then you might be, I don't know,

113
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,520
you might be in luck,

114
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,720
and I would like to be in your boarding group if possible.

115
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,200
All right, well yes, if it's boarding groups,

116
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,960
if it's like, yes, exactly like Galaxy's Edge,

117
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,480
or getting on Rise of the Resistance,

118
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:56,560
it'll be groups of eight, I think is the max.

119
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,880
Yeah.

120
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,600
And look, we've all got each other's passes,

121
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,840
we've all got each other's annual passes

122
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,440
in the useless Disneyland app.

123
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:07,800
We can all help check, we can get off Wi-Fi, use data,

124
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,200
because that's gonna be more reliable.

125
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,480
We're all on the same healthcare,

126
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,960
and the same healthcare app,

127
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:17,320
and it's all very easy to use and very not confusing.

128
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:21,220
Same dog shit covered California plans, sure.

129
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:26,000
I'm on some sort of dog shit California plan, I believe.

130
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,400
But yeah, so I will pledge,

131
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,320
if there is a checking element to the vaccinations,

132
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,720
I will help us all get them.

133
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,840
But I don't know that there will be.

134
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,600
Yeah, yeah, but that's certainly your best hope,

135
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,680
it's all our best hope.

136
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,640
Yeah, we hope checking is possible.

137
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:46,560
Yeah, we'll see where this goes.

138
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,680
But you know, a tough year last year,

139
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:55,160
obviously, hopefully this year ends up a little brighter.

140
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,840
You know, and I think family has helped us get through it,

141
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,240
I think, and that includes you, the podcast,

142
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,360
the Ride family, you're not just part of our crew,

143
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,840
you're part of our family.

144
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:09,840
Now, of course, family, you know, still bickers sometimes,

145
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,920
you don't always get along,

146
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:16,160
and that's sort of what being part of a family is all about.

147
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,760
And with that, there's a new format

148
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:22,240
that we're going to introduce for 2021,

149
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,280
a new type of episode,

150
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:28,680
and this requires you, the podcast, the Ride family,

151
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,000
and the, well, I don't know, you know, Mike, this is your idea,

152
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,520
do you want to introduce us to this new episode format?

153
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,720
I'm just going to say the one word that will be,

154
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,480
I think, the title of the episode,

155
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:44,720
and I think you'll know what we're getting at here.

156
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,160
Gripes.

157
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,000
Gripes.

158
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,560
Because from time to, gripes,

159
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,320
from time to time on social media, I will see,

160
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:54,440
oh, so-and-so didn't like this rider,

161
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:57,840
they had a bad opinion, Jason didn't like, hmm.

162
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,560
I'm just trying to say, I'm not sure.

163
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,800
Yeah, I'm a pretty easy mark.

164
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,760
Jason likes everything, except for the Frozen ride,

165
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,520
and Epcot for some weird reason.

166
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,360
Okay, wait, he doesn't like the Frozen ride,

167
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:11,320
and he didn't like the Avengers Infinity War.

168
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,680
He likes every other Marvel movie,

169
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,840
but he doesn't like Infinity War

170
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,960
because it made kids too sad, he said.

171
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,680
I didn't, I also did not like

172
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,200
the West Coast Customs roller coaster

173
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,600
at Six Flags Magic Mountain.

174
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,240
Insane.

175
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,160
Yet another roller coaster trying to kill me.

176
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,600
So there's three things Jason doesn't like.

177
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,920
He didn't like walking through

178
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:35,360
the mostly abandoned Margaritaville complex, that was one.

179
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,200
No, I didn't. Four, four, four.

180
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,640
We've got four.

181
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,640
Can we get five?

182
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,840
Can we think of a fifth thing Jason doesn't like?

183
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,640
I mean, I've had some bad treats at theme parks.

184
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:48,000
There's definitely been some bad, like, stiff brownies,

185
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,360
some stale brownies and stuff.

186
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,040
Stiff brownies?

187
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:56,200
Stiff brownies, wet quesadillas at Margaritaville, you know?

188
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,680
Soaking wet quesadillas.

189
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,520
But is it on purpose wet, or is it?

190
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,600
Because sometimes you get a wet burrito and it's very good.

191
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,880
But if it's a wet quesadilla and you didn't order that,

192
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,680
and it's just like wet with water.

193
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,680
Wet quesadilla makes no sense.

194
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,640
It's too flat. There wouldn't be anything left.

195
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:14,080
That's not, you wouldn't purposefully order a burrito.

196
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,400
You got a lot of the substance.

197
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,800
All right, that's fair.

198
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,120
But yeah, I'd, well, I'll put that on my own list too.

199
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:23,280
I don't like wet quesadillas either.

200
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,280
OK, fine. Wet quesadillas.

201
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,480
Yeah, OK. If it's accidentally wet,

202
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:30,480
if somebody's made some sort of an innovation in quesadilla making

203
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,360
and they figured out a way to make a wet quesadilla,

204
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:35,520
I'm interested. But yes, if it's just wet, I'm that's on my list as well.

205
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:39,240
I also don't care for a stiff brownie.

206
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,480
I'm anti-stiff brownie.

207
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:43,520
I like a nice, soft, chewy brownie, not stiff.

208
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,160
Yeah, I mean, I like the corners.

209
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,960
I like the burnt corners. I'll do that.

210
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,400
But like, you know what I mean.

211
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:52,120
So what are we? What's great?

212
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:55,320
What we're getting at here is that, you know, say

213
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:58,680
Jason was a listener of the podcast and he heard me say, you know what?

214
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,520
I love eating a good stiff brownie.

215
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,560
I like it when it's stale. I like it when it's hard.

216
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:07,560
I want it to feel like it's some sort of a like a paperweight in my mouth.

217
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:11,280
I like that. He would say, OK, I have a gripe with you, Mike.

218
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,720
And then he'll there'll be a you'll see it.

219
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:17,600
We'll put it online and you would write into an anonymous prompt.

220
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,600
Jason Sheridan would say he's but he's anonymous.

221
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:27,800
I'm getting confused. He would say, Mike, I don't like when you praise stiff brownies.

222
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,400
And then I will see that.

223
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:33,520
And then we will respond to these gripes on an episode.

224
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,600
Yes. To talk to like talk it through.

225
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:40,320
Maybe either we'll get defensive or we'll say, you know what?

226
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,760
Maybe you're right. Maybe I've been too hard on stiff brownies

227
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,800
and I should reconsider them.

228
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,640
So we're hoping this opens up an interesting dialog.

229
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,720
We can chat about the different things.

230
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:53,520
And we also get to see maybe there's one thing that I always say

231
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:58,280
I don't like or like that everyone in the audience thinks I'm wrong about.

232
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,360
So we'll see sort of take the temperature of the audience to see exactly

233
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:06,760
if we're who if we're all in line together or maybe one of us has a really radical opinion.

234
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:11,720
Has there been some take that is not a hot take in a good way?

235
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,600
That's a that's a wrong take a cold take.

236
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:19,760
Is there some you know, is there a piece of information that we got wrong?

237
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,960
And you know that we we got it wrong.

238
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,280
We heard a little of this recently.

239
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:26,920
We're talking about we were talking about Dollywood and saying how it's hard

240
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:29,720
so hard to get to and isn't it in a dry county?

241
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,680
And somebody was like, enough is enough.

242
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,560
Guys, you are wrong about all this.

243
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,280
So things like that are helpful.

244
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,880
It's nice to be corrected.

245
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,320
It's a little bit of a correction segment, I think possibly, too.

246
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,600
But if it's just, you know,

247
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,320
yeah, there's something that we say over and over, we disagree with.

248
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,280
Or you want us to reconsider.

249
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:51,680
One thing is, did we do an entire park or a ride and we left out some aspect

250
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,120
or something that matters to you?

251
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:58,600
And we skipped over it brazenly and you want us to put a spotlight on it.

252
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,720
That's a gripe.

253
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,920
Right.

254
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:05,040
We talked I talked about like doing like a like lost and found idea on the Patreon.

255
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:05,760
We haven't done that.

256
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,960
Maybe that is the way to do it.

257
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,200
You do it under gripes.

258
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,040
Do we lose something in the past with a topic?

259
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,440
It's time for us to find it and and we can do it via your gripes.

260
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,960
Right. We can do a lot via your gripes.

261
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,280
Is I think what we're realizing, especially even now.

262
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,240
Now, keep the gripes.

263
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,960
Don't let's not make them maybe personal attacks.

264
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:29,600
But I mean, maybe if your gripe is like, look, like you've had the same haircut

265
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:34,360
for like seven years, I think you would look good with a crew cut or something.

266
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:37,960
As long as you spin it at that in a positive way, I'm not going to be upset.

267
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,400
Yeah. Keep it clean.

268
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,400
Keep it nice.

269
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,320
Although I got a gripe, if one more person sends us that Pixar

270
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:47,640
named the podcast thing, the guy with glasses in that meme looks like shit.

271
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,880
So I know if I get that one more time, I'm throwing this MacBook out the window.

272
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,480
No one in that is like us.

273
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,800
I don't understand.

274
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,240
I don't understand the meme.

275
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,760
I get that there's like three dudes

276
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,720
and like white dudes who do pocket, but like.

277
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,960
But then within that, how is that us?

278
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,680
I don't know. Well, like it's Al.

279
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:13,520
Al's from Al's Toy Barn from Toy Story 2 is in there.

280
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,400
There is not an Al among us.

281
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,280
That's not that's not right.

282
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:20,640
Yeah, Jason, if Jason, you're obviously responding

283
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,920
because you believe people are calling you Al.

284
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,560
I don't think you're Al.

285
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,120
I know. I don't think you're Al at all.

286
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,720
I mean, Al, if anyone's like Al, it's me.

287
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,760
I have all these goddamn toys behind me.

288
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:36,040
And you don't and you sometimes forget the lesson that toys are to be played

289
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:40,280
with and not stored forever, although you do take them out of the box.

290
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:40,800
You don't leave them.

291
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,680
You don't align with stinky Pete's philosophy.

292
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,480
I do not know stinky Pete's philosophy.

293
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:50,080
There was one time when I was moving some stuff around

294
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:54,880
and Lindsay walked in and she goes, you like touching the toys, don't you?

295
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,920
And I went, I do. Yes.

296
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,240
Got to let him breathe.

297
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:02,360
I wasn't touching like Donatello's penis or anything.

298
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:05,520
I was just like holding them and placing them and putting them around.

299
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,240
That's what she meant.

300
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,120
I wasn't like caressing his turtle cheek or something.

301
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:13,160
One of those where you give us the fodder along with the statement.

302
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,280
You're as with the foot stuff.

303
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,360
Saying it.

304
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,360
I was like, oh, this is a fun little anecdote.

305
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,640
I'll tell. And I was like, oh, now I'm opening up myself to like

306
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:24,440
the fact that I'm like molesting my toys as I as I play with them.

307
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,880
Mike likes touching the toys.

308
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:31,760
He likes taking his socks off in the log in the in the stiff brownie log.

309
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:35,760
And the stiff brownie log.

310
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,640
You know, I think we've at least maybe we're like it's

311
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,800
I'm already feeling good about this episode.

312
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,480
We've we've started a couple new things this year.

313
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,720
Is that I like I'm sexual with my toys.

314
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,320
And that Jason hates stiff brownies.

315
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:53,840
So we've got some new new things to play with in this upcoming year.

316
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,680
And I'm looking for it because I'm just going to make a soundboard of my voice

317
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:02,240
that just plays the the words OK, or not looking for notes.

318
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,960
And I'll just I'll jump back and forth between those two.

319
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,440
That's it. No further response on these grapes.

320
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:15,800
If I can figure out how to clip that pop song from a few years ago

321
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,600
where the chorus is just I don't care.

322
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:21,320
I love it. I love it.

323
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:24,080
I don't care. Yeah.

324
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,840
I don't care about your grind.

325
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:31,520
And maybe I think since the least resistant to gripes,

326
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,960
he doesn't like so this will be funnier.

327
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,400
Actually, you know what? I take it back.

328
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,400
Be as rude as you want to Jason.

329
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:42,160
OK, well, look, just because we haven't gotten a chance

330
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,880
to see our families or take a general meeting in a while

331
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,920
and we're just craving criticism, doesn't mean you have to be mean.

332
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,360
All right. Don't be mean to Jason.

333
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,920
That's the we're still good boys.

334
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,560
These are gripes, but we're still good boys.

335
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:58,640
So be nice. But if there's been some burning opinion, if you've had it for you,

336
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,560
we've been doing this podcast for a couple of years now.

337
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,640
And if there's something from episode two that made you mad

338
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,040
or just want to correct us on set us straight,

339
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:08,400
there's a lot of things that gripes could be.

340
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:11,360
So we've set up a Google form

341
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:15,760
that asks you if you have any gripes and you can put the gripes anonymously.

342
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:19,240
It's it's really like a little comment box, a suggestion box.

343
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,440
We'll put that in the link to this episode and we'll also tweet it out.

344
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:25,840
You'll you'll we'll make sure that you you find the gripes page.

345
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,080
And yes, we said it's anonymous.

346
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:33,040
If you want to put your name, feel free if you want us to associate you with this gripe.

347
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:38,560
But if you just, you know, if you want anonymity in a voting way, then feel free.

348
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:42,600
This also is not a requirement, but I was going to throw this in as something

349
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:47,280
that I think that would make us for me, it would skip a gripe to the front of the line

350
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,880
just because I would enjoy it.

351
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,400
You know, like with Jeopardy!

352
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,960
answering the form of a question, I think it would be nice

353
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:58,400
if the gripes started with the phrase, yeah, I got a gripe, all right.

354
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,120
So if you start your gripe with that, yeah,

355
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:07,080
I got a gripe, all right, Scott, your your Rex is overrated, whatever it is.

356
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:12,720
I just I think that I think that's a nice piece of the flow and I'd enjoy reading that.

357
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,640
So but up to you.

358
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,400
Yeah, I think that, yeah.

359
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,640
If your gripe is that you hate that and you don't want to

360
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:21,160
don't dictate some phrase to me, then that's a fair gripe.

361
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:22,960
Mm hmm.

362
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,920
I yeah, use that.

363
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:29,680
I mean, I think that, yeah, as long as we can do a little voice,

364
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,400
we're always going to be a little happier to do anything.

365
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:35,960
As you if you listen to the show, you know, anytime we can do a voice,

366
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,920
we all like to do it ad nauseam.

367
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,320
This is very true. Yeah.

368
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,320
So, yeah, give us the chance to do a little voice

369
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:48,800
and it'll cushion the blow of the gripe that is is coming.

370
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,560
So podcasts are at gripes and we'll yeah, we'll collect those and then put them up.

371
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,960
Probably as a Patreon episode.

372
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,280
I don't know, at some point the next month or something.

373
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,160
Yeah. Yeah.

374
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,680
So we'll brace for gripes, bracing for gripes.

375
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:07,160
And speaking of gripes, fast and furious supercharged.

376
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:09,920
Oh, man.

377
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:12,000
Better way to ultimate gripe.

378
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:14,400
The ultimate gripe.

379
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,640
We know I got to say, I watched one of those YouTube channels that like,

380
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,080
you know, does stuff about theme park history at all.

381
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:24,600
And one of them was laying it on a little thick about.

382
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:25,840
I thought the same thing.

383
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:28,800
Yeah, I don't I don't even know which one, so I won't call them out.

384
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,920
But yeah, I have a call out.

385
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:33,240
I know. Yeah, calm down.

386
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:36,000
But, you know, it fit the but we're trying to think how to start the year.

387
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,800
And we were saying, well, like a bigger one.

388
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,760
But of course, bigger ones, you know, we're trying to do this dance

389
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:44,280
where there's so many bigger attractions that we would love to do in person.

390
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:47,320
As we've now declared, we're going to do with the country bear jamboree

391
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,360
or, you know, this live shows we'd like to do.

392
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:54,680
What's a big attraction that we can let live in the awful morass of the zoom era?

393
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,000
I say fast and furious supercharge.

394
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,720
Let's hit the nitrous and kick off this year.

395
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,520
Right. That's how we roll.

396
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:07,080
As as Don Omar Buster rhymes,

397
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:10,480
wreak the villain and Jay Doe what's saying.

398
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:13,120
Oh, yeah. Oh, the whole gang.

399
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:14,720
Hell, yeah.

400
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:18,520
This is not we're not putting the Fast and Furious franchise

401
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,840
in this gripe category.

402
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,480
I have not seen all full disclosure.

403
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,800
I've not seen all of them.

404
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,080
It is on my list to watch all of them this year.

405
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,960
At certain point, I know they're very fun.

406
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,200
They're insane.

407
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,280
But we don't.

408
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:33,040
The ride itself is going into the gripe column here.

409
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:36,440
Not. Yeah, that's important to clarify, I think, because, yeah,

410
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:41,080
you don't want to be like the cultural snob who's these films that are.

411
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:43,200
Yeah, I think they're they're fun people like them.

412
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,720
People have a blast going to them when they open up.

413
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:50,360
And I it's just what they ended up doing with it.

414
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,200
Is. Yeah, I think.

415
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,000
Cause the reckoning at Universal.

416
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:54,760
I think it did.

417
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:57,280
I think it impacted what they're going to do for the future.

418
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,080
I think that's 100 percent right.

419
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:02,280
And I I rewatched the first one last night.

420
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,680
I'm going to rewatch them all now because I've watched them at like

421
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:08,960
half on USA, half on like an airplane.

422
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,600
And like they are very fun.

423
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,080
And I would go so far as to say I read one

424
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,640
like a review of them once of like

425
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,080
these are kind of more fun Avengers movies,

426
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,320
like especially when they get to five, six, seven

427
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,680
and they get to the spy stuff and all like it's like,

428
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,040
yeah, these are really fun.

429
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,240
Like I don't know.

430
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,280
The early ones are fun in their own way.

431
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:33,120
The middle ones are fun in their own way.

432
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,160
It's just wild.

433
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:37,600
And then they've retconned stuff like the watching order.

434
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:43,400
The movies is technically one, two, four, five, six, three, seven, eight,

435
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:46,320
because they retcon the order that they go in.

436
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:51,120
The character Han is technically the same character

437
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:56,760
from Better Luck Tomorrow that that actor plays and Justin Lin directed.

438
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,880
It's so wild.

439
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:00,520
The mythology of these movies.

440
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:03,600
Where does Hobbs and Shaw fall into the chronology?

441
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:08,480
Hobbs and Shaw, I think, happens directly either between seven and eight

442
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,120
or right after eight.

443
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,000
Oh, characters come back from the dead.

444
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,920
Like comic book logic applies, which is awesome.

445
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,240
Like it's so fun.

446
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:20,680
Which sort of happens in the ride a little not dead, but there's a, you know,

447
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:25,160
I mean, we'll get to it, but there's it doesn't really fall on the timeline

448
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,640
of the movies super well.

449
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,440
They have to nudge some stuff.

450
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,320
Right.

451
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:33,120
So, yeah, so we've just set that aside.

452
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,360
The movies are good.

453
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,680
Yeah, you know, here we go.

454
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,520
Absolutely.

455
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:41,520
And so so the idea of there there being

456
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:46,640
attractions of these of these films makes a lot of sense for something

457
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,520
that we're doing for a topic that we're doing in the near future.

458
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:52,760
I was trying to figure out, like, what are some of the biggest properties

459
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:56,480
that don't have an affiliated theme park attraction?

460
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:00,000
And in looking at what are just like the highest grossing film,

461
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,360
I just haven't looked in a while.

462
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,640
What are the highest grossing films?

463
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,000
And especially when you when you look at a list and like, all right,

464
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:10,560
how many franchises, you know, take over seven, eight slots in that list.

465
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,280
Infest and Furious is way up there.

466
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:15,840
Just like makes so much sense on paper for them to do something,

467
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,680
for them to exploit this in the theme parks somehow.

468
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,920
And when the first that it came up, one of those theme park

469
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:27,440
review videos reminded me that Fast and Furious came up as a rumor

470
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:31,120
when they took out the Back to the Future ride that they said, like,

471
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:36,160
this space is going to be used maybe for Simpsons or maybe for Fast and Furious,

472
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:40,360
which I think people were maybe happier with Simpsons because, you know,

473
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:43,160
probably if you're a big Badger the Future fan, you also like the Simpsons.

474
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,280
Fast and Furious is maybe less guaranteed that you.

475
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:51,760
Well, and around that time, Fast and Furious was not the worldwide sensation

476
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,960
that it became once they started just shoving people in there.

477
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,120
Just that's true.

478
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:59,480
And like the Rock and John Cena like them.

479
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:01,440
And yes, they thumb.

480
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,120
Yeah, you're right. It would have been weirder at the time.

481
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:07,040
Would have felt more akin to let's just make everything about

482
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,840
Brendan Fraser, mummy for a while.

483
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:12,760
Like, like, is this really going to I mean, those are good rides, obviously.

484
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:18,680
But, you know, I've made the complaint that there was a time at Universal Hollywood

485
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:21,320
where there were like three things based on that mummy.

486
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:23,480
And like that seems like a lot.

487
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,920
So, I don't know. Yeah, it seemed weirder at the time.

488
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,320
Now, of course, it makes sense to do an attraction.

489
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:33,720
But as we've said before, I think we said this before.

490
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:40,000
If you're going to do a ride based on the movies about fast cars,

491
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:44,560
would it not make sense to make it a ride involving fast cars?

492
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:49,520
Hmm. Speed, literal, actual speed, literal speed.

493
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,680
Yeah. But when one of the movies has the word drift in the title,

494
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:56,520
and you want to give us the opportunity to do a drift instead of like

495
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,720
sit between two IMAX screens.

496
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:04,440
Yeah, you would think like my first thought would be like, oh,

497
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:08,960
could they do some crazy like test track Fast and Furious ride? Yeah. Yeah.

498
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,680
And they obviously they could do that.

499
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:15,360
But like Cars Land, the Radiator Springs racer should be.

500
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:19,840
Fast and Furious ride, that should be the scope of a Fast and Furious ride.

501
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,800
Little dark ride, you see all your friends, you see Dom,

502
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,240
and then you have a fun, crazy race at the end.

503
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,120
Yeah, absolutely.

504
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,840
That's the plus up right that you just fixed it immediately.

505
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,360
Right. It takes up a lot more room.

506
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:37,680
But with the amount of money the Fast and Furious movies have made,

507
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:41,760
I don't think that that's crazy to devote that much space to the franchise.

508
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:45,920
No. Well, and here's here's the situation, I think,

509
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:49,320
because this was sort of shoehorned into,

510
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:53,680
if you don't know the full scope of the of Supercharged,

511
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,680
it exists as well.

512
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:58,840
You know, I'll just read off of the Wikipedia because I thought this was phrased

513
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,480
accidentally brilliantly. Fast and Furious Supercharged

514
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:06,200
is an attraction at Universal Studios Hollywood, Universal Studios Florida,

515
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,960
and was canceled at Universal Studios Beijing.

516
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:15,840
After the response to Florida, it became a defunct attraction

517
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,880
before it was ever an existing attraction.

518
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:23,920
So it is one of those in the long tradition of Universal

519
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:27,120
rides that is a freestanding ride in Florida,

520
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,880
but started as a stop on the tram tour.

521
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:35,440
And in fact, for a while has been the, as they put it, grand finale

522
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:40,000
of the tram tour, which was sort of missing like the big kick

523
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:45,200
at the end. This replaced the literal space where they they had the

524
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:48,560
the mummy tunnel and one of the many mummy things they had.

525
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:53,280
You sat in a weird tube that twisted you around, and that was the end of the tour.

526
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:58,200
So the desire to kind of go out with a bang on the tram tour makes a lot of sense.

527
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:01,920
And this thing was clearly based on the initial

528
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:04,000
good response to the King Kong

529
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,680
screen attraction that's kind of midway through the tram tour.

530
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,560
Yeah. And that brings up a couple of good points, Scott.

531
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:18,240
One, why does this one get so much more flack than the

532
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,640
reign of Kong at Islands of Adventure?

533
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:25,800
Is it just because Kong is more endearing to us

534
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:29,480
and there's a big animatronic at the end and there's a lot of fake rock work?

535
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,120
Animatronic helps a lot.

536
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,240
Yeah. And then you actually like go somewhere.

537
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:38,160
That little that little outdoor path is does a lot for you, even though it's very

538
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:43,520
short, it feels like they did more to make this its own fleshed out attraction,

539
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:46,640
to make Kong its own fleshed out attraction than they did Fast and Furious,

540
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:51,160
where they just it felt like they just kind of copy pasted the tram

541
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:55,960
show, except with like a weird Ghostbusters-esque

542
00:25:56,440 --> 00:26:02,400
room with a refillable hourly employee talking at you before you get on the ride.

543
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:07,200
Yeah, it doesn't. It feels really this should maybe be a lesson.

544
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,760
And I'm not too imagineers people.

545
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:11,480
I'm sure there was much cooler ideas for it.

546
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:15,160
But like management, when it comes to just a little bit,

547
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:20,760
goes a long way in regards to to to Kong versus Fast and Furious in Florida.

548
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:24,440
Because it's like it's just the difference is a giant monkey head

549
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:28,800
and then maybe like an extra scene like there's an extra scene, I think, on it

550
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:31,320
from the one from the tram tour version.

551
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,240
And yes, the exterior is like pretty cool.

552
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:36,280
Is there there's extra like there's extra video.

553
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:41,560
So, right. So, yes, just a little bit more goes a long way.

554
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:44,960
And then, yeah, Kong does not get the shit that Fast and Furious gets.

555
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:48,800
Well, what I was starting to say there was that, you know,

556
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:53,760
I definitely did this on the tram and was like a little underwhelmed.

557
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,920
But I certainly wasn't mad at it.

558
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:59,520
And I think it existing within the tram lets you cut some slack.

559
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:03,720
But when you install this as its own big, new freestanding attraction

560
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:07,480
years later in Florida, I think the expectation goes up.

561
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,480
And I think a lot of people were like, it's not just going to be the tram thing.

562
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:13,920
Right. I think I even thought, is it elements of that?

563
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:18,320
But then it's its own ride system that is more like radiator springs or something.

564
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:21,120
And no, no party buses.

565
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:27,560
Right. Yeah, yeah, I think we all assumed, oh, there's no way

566
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:30,560
they're just going to plug it in because, yeah, the tram tour is good.

567
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,320
Like, it's good. It's fine.

568
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:35,480
Oh, it's like we're kind of watching a movie and like there's a there's a fun

569
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:40,040
couple parts. There's a lot of like universal tropes of screens,

570
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:43,640
like where something hooks to you and there's like stuff like that.

571
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,440
But no, it's fine.

572
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:47,120
But there's a way they're going to just port this thing over.

573
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,760
But, you know, money.

574
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,680
I guess money at the time.

575
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:57,960
So and the desire to just get it in quicker, I guess, if it's just

576
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,640
if it's just the screen version.

577
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:03,760
And now, so well, and again, Scott, you brought up that these are like

578
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:08,440
the last two of these movies grossed over one billion dollars each.

579
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,320
So like, yeah, get them in the parks.

580
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:14,080
Yeah. So, yeah, I kind of get that.

581
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,400
But what an execution.

582
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:22,160
I mean, I remember doing the Hollywood one for the first time,

583
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:25,480
and I was like, OK, yeah, that kind of makes sense.

584
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,960
But yeah, that to do this,

585
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:34,520
the same thing in Florida exactly years later is so funny.

586
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:38,920
Really strange. Can we I mean, can we cliff notes?

587
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,840
And I ask you guys this because I don't think I can.

588
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:44,680
Can we cliff notes what it is?

589
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,200
I think our listeners know for the most part.

590
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:50,200
But can we like, how do you quickly explain what this is without getting into like,

591
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:55,560
OK, so then Toretto and like

592
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,480
Letty comes in.

593
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,920
Well, and FBI.

594
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:03,000
OK, well, I guess we'll start.

595
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,440
Let's start with the Hollywood one,

596
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:09,880
because the Hollywood one is has the element of like

597
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:13,520
the tram tour that it's got to deal with as well.

598
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:17,240
And this was not the first Fast and the Furious thing on the tram tour either.

599
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:21,520
When this opened, they closed the Fast and the Furious extreme close up

600
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:25,040
where they used two car shells on Kuka Arms

601
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:29,760
and they launched them at you and then the cars to dance to gasoline.

602
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,440
I was thinking about this.

603
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,960
Don't we all love that much more than the ride?

604
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,400
I do think it's cute.

605
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,400
I have a. I won't go that far.

606
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,600
Did you have to see it a lot?

607
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,200
Did you have to see it a lot?

608
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:48,200
Yes. And that was the I'm forgive me, I'm sure I'm repeating things, but I

609
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:53,520
this that debuted the summer that I started as a tour guide.

610
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:57,120
And I remember when they getting the I'm in the training program.

611
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,680
Cool. And I just get to go on the tram and this is my job.

612
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:03,640
And I was so excited and get to, you know, I did the do King Kong first.

613
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,880
And like, I just love being there no matter what.

614
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:08,960
And then you start going up the hill and then like, wait, what is this thing?

615
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:13,320
And it I just remember feeling so deflated the first time

616
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:17,640
and then thinking I have to do this many times a day.

617
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:20,320
And it's you know, if I was in a good mood on those things,

618
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,760
I would have a blast with it no matter what.

619
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:27,680
But if I was just not feeling the tram that day, I the part where I really died

620
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:32,160
was like, and that's why we're going to talk about picture cars.

621
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:35,800
And then you and then you pass by a bunch of like mediocre

622
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:40,840
like a little rascals go cart and and then you go into this weird little

623
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:44,200
the corral and then to

624
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:48,520
there's a lot of like just sound effects without anything corresponding.

625
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:50,000
Like, OK, bullets.

626
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,760
And then you hear bullet sounds and then cars sort of

627
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,000
fly at you slowly.

628
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,760
And the two the two lines that just crushed my spirit every single time.

629
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:05,120
And again, give it a how about a hand for our picture cars?

630
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,640
Carnage and karma.

631
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,480
Take a bow, boys.

632
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:13,440
And then they would do a little boop, which is like now I'm fond of now

633
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,360
that it's gone, I'm a little more fond of it.

634
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,680
I can see how that would grate on you.

635
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:21,120
But as somebody who would get to, you know, see the tour once a year,

636
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,240
twice a year, maybe.

637
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:26,160
So, yeah, basically, if in case you don't want to talk about on the tram tour,

638
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:28,680
the cars would sort of do like a trick for you, basically,

639
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:31,600
like they were peeling out and like going to drive at you.

640
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,200
And then there was like an explosion.

641
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:38,600
They flew out of an explosion and then like, you know, as if

642
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:42,480
flying right as if you're the POV of the camera and it stopped.

643
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:45,240
They stop right at the point where they would hit the tram.

644
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:48,440
Right. And then that's when you would say those lines, if you could.

645
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,600
By the way, I don't want to be too much on the spot, Scott.

646
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:55,120
But if you could just give us your you're feeling really good,

647
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,160
you're feeling optimistic from the tram tour.

648
00:31:57,160 --> 00:32:00,000
Give us the best line reading you could have that moment.

649
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,280
The take a bow, boys moment.

650
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:08,040
You wouldn't say, all right, how about a hand for carnage and karma?

651
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,240
Hey, take a bow, boys.

652
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,600
And then what was the line? It was like,

653
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,480
you got anything else to show us?

654
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:21,280
Oh, yeah, it was it was a hey, got any other moves?

655
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:24,000
And then I got so lean.

656
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:27,280
And then they just kind of like spun around.

657
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,920
Yeah, a little bit.

658
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:31,360
The Cooke arms are the things they have the Harry Potter

659
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:34,520
Forbidden Journey right on that's like can move all around.

660
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:37,800
So they would just on these two arms, the cars would just kind of like

661
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:41,560
dance, but not really because they can't really dance.

662
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,680
Turn and spin a little.

663
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:46,600
And you could see their undercarriage and there's nothing in it,

664
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,600
that there's facades of cars.

665
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,920
It's a lot of really unflattering.

666
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:54,040
You're getting like upskirts of the cars, unflattering angles.

667
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,760
I do.

668
00:32:55,760 --> 00:33:00,560
We think that Luigi's dance at Cars Land

669
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:03,320
was a reaction to this dance.

670
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:08,320
I was trying to or Luigi's whatever it's called, something of the dance.

671
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:09,840
Yeah, yeah.

672
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:13,400
Well, the issue is that there weren't enough like just two people dancing.

673
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:17,400
And look, you know, if you're if you're having a wedding or some event

674
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:20,320
and there's only two people on the dance floor, it's a little a little pathetic.

675
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:23,640
But you get a ton out there, a ton of little coops.

676
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,960
And now, you know, things are really happened.

677
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:31,120
The second one, the line that really destroyed the spirits was

678
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:36,600
that finishes and then you say, take that dancing with the stars.

679
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,480
Now, I don't care.

680
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,680
I don't care for that line.

681
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,920
No, take it.

682
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:47,200
OK, the show in general, like in who from the show is on

683
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:51,480
the tram, who's supposed to be offended and why?

684
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,000
Because they dance to.

685
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,560
Could I say that if I danced a little

686
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:59,480
and then say and I say, take that dancing with the stars?

687
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:03,400
I mean, we're going to whenever we do a full episode on this tram tour,

688
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,440
we'll break it all down.

689
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:07,480
But it is it is confusing because you

690
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:10,920
you should say like, oh, these two should be on dancing with the stars.

691
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,280
Like that should be like the way better.

692
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,240
There may have even been was it an alter?

693
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:18,880
Did it just occur to me that that you you make it something about

694
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:22,200
like like, boy, you know, I got another name for that.

695
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:24,320
Dancing with the cars.

696
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,400
Oh, that's even better.

697
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,640
Yeah, perfect.

698
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:30,200
It's I I don't obviously I did that job and I loved it.

699
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:33,520
So my my problem was never with the corniness of it,

700
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:37,560
because there's like classic corniness, there's the corniness of King Kong's

701
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:40,400
banana breath, then the shark was his lawyer.

702
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:43,840
If it's like caked in corniness, I kind of liked it.

703
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:46,920
But then dancing with the stars.

704
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:51,360
What I take that take that.

705
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:55,520
I was going to try to clip gasoline to play under the intro to the show.

706
00:34:55,520 --> 00:35:01,040
But it's just it's very it's hard to compete with because it's so infectious.

707
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:04,440
Look, Jason, I don't want to this is going to make the audience sad.

708
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,600
And I wasn't even going to say anything.

709
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:09,640
But I had an idea to put to bring the soundboard back to this episode.

710
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,800
But I'm having a problem with the operating system

711
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:14,240
working with the program that I was using.

712
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:19,480
So there will not be any gasoline played intermittently on this podcast today.

713
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:23,160
I'm not saying, though, it's out of bounds for future episodes.

714
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:26,560
Now I will promise there will be an episode in 2021

715
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:29,160
where all of a sudden gasoline will just start playing

716
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:33,040
here and there. We least suspect that when you least.

717
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:35,440
Scott, that was your first summer working the tour.

718
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:38,360
And that was right around. I first started going regularly.

719
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:40,720
And I was out here doing internships.

720
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,320
I was living close by.

721
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,880
So I bought a pay. I bought an annual pass.

722
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:48,400
And I went a lot. I was very cool in college.

723
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:53,560
And so I probably saw that thing a lot and saw you a lot.

724
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:57,080
That's a weird thing, the possibility that you took a

725
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:02,160
a tram and it was my tram tram tour and then walked and got

726
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,560
Taco Tuesday at Rubio's up at City Walk.

727
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:07,040
Long fallen, long gone, fallen brother.

728
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:09,360
Boy, those are the days, huh?

729
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:13,640
Yeah. Back when you had somebody trustworthy in office like Bush.

730
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:14,920
George W.

731
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:18,560
There was nothing quite like driving a golf cart up to City Walk

732
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:21,520
and trying to get six people's orders of one dollar

733
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:24,400
taco combos with six things of coke

734
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:28,720
and then driving down the hill at an 80 degree angle.

735
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:31,840
Yeah, it's so steep, steep, narrow roads.

736
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,520
And like a deer could dart out in front of you.

737
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:38,480
Yeah, you're in a fast and furious situation.

738
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:44,480
I just Luigi's Rollicking Roadsters is the name of that ride.

739
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,800
I was I was going to call it Luigi's Lord of the Dance.

740
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:49,920
Is that something else?

741
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,680
Is that like a short or something?

742
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:52,680
Why do I have that in my head?

743
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:54,080
I mean, I know what Lord of the Dance is.

744
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:56,920
Yeah. Not sure. You think that's.

745
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:57,760
Yeah, no, it's not.

746
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:00,240
I just put that in. OK, that's not that's not a thing.

747
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:01,720
Should be, though.

748
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:04,880
I feel like that's a joke Maeder makes for the parents.

749
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,640
It's something something, you know.

750
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:09,920
Yeah. But anyway, we'll get to the we'll get to the

751
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,280
Rollicking Roadsters eventually.

752
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,640
That's yeah, we'll get to that anyway.

753
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:17,360
Back to Supercharged, which is, by the way, the name of both

754
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:20,480
the Hollywood experience and the Florida experience, despite some differences

755
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,760
at the Hollywood part.

756
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:26,720
As we said, it's part of the studio tour and it kind of starts

757
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:31,960
with the guide driving by ending Wisteria Lane.

758
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:35,800
And then they go some version of like, oh, weird.

759
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:39,120
There's a 1970s Dodge Charger.

760
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,880
That shouldn't be there.

761
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:44,280
Or like that's suspicious.

762
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:47,440
So thanks, Karen, I guess.

763
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:51,760
Car stock car in a in a nice neighborhood.

764
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:55,920
I guess that's all it takes for someone to call in security at the universal lot.

765
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:01,040
But also, it's a movie studio lot.

766
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:05,320
Yeah, there probably is a period perfect car that should be there.

767
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,760
It's a movie studio.

768
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:07,840
Why is that weird?

769
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:11,200
And I don't know, maybe one of the desperate housewives is hanging out

770
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:14,640
with some some young hotshot with a cool old car.

771
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,720
I don't know what the desperate housewives do.

772
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:17,760
Truly, I don't.

773
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,600
I don't know what the show is.

774
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:23,440
And it's weird that it's still like a big before the grand finale.

775
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:25,800
See where the desperate housewives lived.

776
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,000
They'll be back soon enough.

777
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,240
They have to be back.

778
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:31,560
Yeah, they have to be.

779
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:32,640
And they're more desperate.

780
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:35,280
They're young. They're like it's a prequel and they're more desperate than

781
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:36,960
when they were older even.

782
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:41,160
OK, they've all moved off the street because only Felicity Huffman

783
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:42,440
still lives on the street.

784
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:45,320
She agrees to do the reboot because she needs money.

785
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:48,280
And then it's the next gen.

786
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:50,280
It's the next gen of housewives.

787
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:54,280
Yes, they're passing the torch, proving that anyone can be a desperate housewife.

788
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:57,240
Anyone can be a desperate housewife.

789
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:00,800
Well, we remember at the end of the full of the series,

790
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:04,840
there was a little girl with a broom broom housewife sweeping up

791
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:09,240
and she was sort of looking off into the distance and realizing that she could be

792
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,080
a desperate housewife.

793
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:15,040
Should we add the addendum to the gripes that we will probably not respond

794
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,280
to the gripes if they're about new Star Wars?

795
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,760
Oh, yeah, we're not talking about news.

796
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:19,880
No, no, no. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

797
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:22,200
We're not following. Oh, it's a trap.

798
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:25,760
Sorry. I, I thought it was very cool

799
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:29,360
during the seven and a half hour Disney investor call where they

800
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:34,040
thoughtfully announced the, you know, a young Muslim woman superhero,

801
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,760
very diverse cast.

802
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:38,120
And then very close to that,

803
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:42,120
Patty Jenkins shows up and goes, yeah, USA fighter pilots, number one.

804
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:47,600
That wasn't tone deaf after the last century of US foreign policy.

805
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,040
That was it.

806
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:51,600
And she was promoting a rogue squadron.

807
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,640
Just say you played the video game in the 90s.

808
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:54,400
What are you doing?

809
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:59,400
What is this Air Force buying half the budget for the movie?

810
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:02,640
We're not going to talk about this either on the gripes episode. All right.

811
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:05,400
We're not going to talk about any of that.

812
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,640
So we'll talk about Galaxy's Edge, though.

813
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:09,320
So Galaxy's Edge is a game, yeah.

814
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:14,120
But we're not going to talk about how every other live action

815
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:17,600
Disney movie has to have like an Air Force approved, like person

816
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:20,320
getting out of the cockpit.

817
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,960
They all have to be sort of partially funded by the CIA.

818
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:24,640
Yeah, they all have to be.

819
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:28,200
Lady and the Tramp had a subplot of about a CIA agent.

820
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,600
Just three Larson. Be very careful.

821
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:34,520
That's one of the jets that if it rains, it explodes.

822
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:36,600
That we spent 40 million dollars on.

823
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:39,240
So be very careful with what you do.

824
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:42,840
I don't know anything about this jet that explodes, but we don't have time for this.

825
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:43,880
We don't have time.

826
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,840
My gripe is that we don't have time.

827
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:50,720
We hey, look, we're dealing with an attraction where the FBI has got a role in.

828
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:55,120
Oh, FBI agent Novak shows up,

829
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:59,760
who I assume was a character from the movies and then is not is some guy.

830
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:03,840
Oh, I think he might be original to the ride.

831
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:07,120
Oh, OK. Oh, so we have to maybe pay attention to this

832
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:10,960
because it's if it's original ride, I'd be FBI agent Novak.

833
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:16,520
Because the Rocks character agent Hobbs works for the US diplomatic service.

834
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:20,240
And that's different than the organization that Mr.

835
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:25,200
Nobody Kurt Russell's character works for in the later movies.

836
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:31,000
OK, so they drive fast cars and they sometimes they steal things

837
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:36,120
and they have parties and but then but then Hobbs,

838
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:38,640
the rock is after them, but then joins them.

839
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:41,080
I'm a little fuzzy.

840
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:43,680
So here's the the the cliff notes.

841
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:46,800
The first three movies are about underground street racing.

842
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:51,120
The fourth movie where Vin Diesel and Paul Walker came back,

843
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:54,000
shifted more to be about like heist stuff.

844
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:58,520
And then it kind of treads the line for the rest of them from like heist

845
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:02,480
to then they get amnesty if they help Hobbs.

846
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:07,240
And then they kind of become like secret agent heisters slash street racers.

847
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:08,920
Which people like more like that.

848
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:12,240
These are maybe this is where it's really cooking the franchise.

849
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:17,400
Yes. And it kind of lets them do anything.

850
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:22,720
Like, I mean, Vin Diesel does like Spider-Man stuff with like old mustangs.

851
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,640
Like, it's crazy.

852
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:26,000
Yeah, that's good.

853
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,480
I mean, I'm very excited to watch all of these.

854
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:32,320
Finally, this year, because it sounds like good nonsense.

855
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:35,680
This is this one sort of stems the most from

856
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,960
is it fast? Five is a fast.

857
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:39,720
It's the one it's the one from 2013.

858
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:41,840
That's the one that they're sort of.

859
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:44,840
One from the most that might be

860
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:49,400
is that Furious Seven, the last Paul Walker one?

861
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:54,400
Not sure if he is the first rock one that they're mainly addressing.

862
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,360
Oh, that's five.

863
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:59,400
OK. And they're they're enemies at that point.

864
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:02,880
So, yes, six or around six or seven, they're allies. OK.

865
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:06,760
Also, no gripes about the fact that we don't know these movies that well.

866
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,720
Yes. Sorry. I know.

867
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:11,880
I think the one that this ride is referencing the most

868
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:16,480
is the one that I saw in theaters, and I do not know one thing about it.

869
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,680
I can tell you what. I enjoyed it.

870
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:22,920
I looked up and smiled and clapped, but I don't know any plot.

871
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:27,040
I got it. It's six because the villain in this ride is

872
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:32,520
is the Shaw that Luke Evans plays and the Shaw that

873
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:36,880
the brother that Jason Statham plays who avenges

874
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:40,560
his brother, Luke Evans, is in seven.

875
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:42,760
So, yes, six. You're correct.

876
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:45,200
OK, OK. Six. OK, got it.

877
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:49,840
But so you keep taking us through Hollywood where there's a weird car

878
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:52,880
and we got to go investigate.

879
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:57,640
So they called into security and then that call gets overrided

880
00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:01,240
by the FBI who tells you that there is an FBI witness

881
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:07,280
in the audience of the tram tour that pissed off Shaw

882
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:12,240
and Shaw is coming to get because FBI witnesses deserve to enjoy

883
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:14,720
the entertainment capital of Los Angeles as well.

884
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:18,160
They get to enjoy Orlando recreation as well.

885
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:24,320
The FBI gets overrided by agent Hobbs of the US diplomatic services

886
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:26,720
and he owns him.

887
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:28,720
He calls him like sweet cheeks.

888
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:30,400
Does he call candy ass cookie?

889
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:33,280
Plus, cookie. Plus, just kind of.

890
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:34,640
That's kind of something.

891
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:35,960
I kind of like cookie.

892
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:37,920
Plus, yes.

893
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:40,120
It's funny when the rock insults people.

894
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:43,480
Yeah, like that was that goes back to his wrestling career.

895
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:45,480
It's funny when it's all career. Yeah.

896
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:48,080
Insulted people. Yeah, that's yeah.

897
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:50,000
So he's doing a little bit of it here.

898
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,320
He's doing a little bit of it here.

899
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:53,760
So they're going to hide you out in a garage.

900
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:58,080
Sullivan's garage, which

901
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:01,920
I might be in one of the movies in the first movie.

902
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:04,360
That's just called Toretto's.

903
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:07,440
But at this point, they've had so many headquarters and locations.

904
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:10,960
And you are told by

905
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:16,240
Letty, Michelle Rodriguez's character and Roman

906
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:20,720
Tyrese's character that you're going to hide out in one of the very good

907
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:25,280
single or two shots shot on an iPhone used for the tramp tour.

908
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:28,800
Yes. Yeah.

909
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:30,360
OK, all right.

910
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:32,560
So we're halfway through the pre-show.

911
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:36,760
So we're we're we're pulling into the giant custom made building

912
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:38,480
made for this experience.

913
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:40,640
And there's been a big race.

914
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:42,960
Dom is, of course, won the race.

915
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:46,200
And there's a party going on, you know.

916
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:47,520
I didn't get that.

917
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:49,200
Wait, where was the?

918
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:53,640
Well, wait, so we're at the end of we're at a party celebrating a race.

919
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:55,880
That's why there's all those people.

920
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:57,440
OK, yeah.

921
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:59,960
And we love the party people, don't we, folks?

922
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:01,800
They seem very natural.

923
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:04,200
This is my favorite part of the whole thing.

924
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:07,680
These non-union background.

925
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:12,400
Well, just the effects of the people partying in like a little group.

926
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:14,840
Yeah. And then it's like repeated.

927
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:17,840
But I like the technology because it kind of makes it look if you squint,

928
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:20,560
it makes it look like there's actually humans kind of in the distance

929
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:22,680
partying in a little group.

930
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:26,400
Mike, I might have to call this a gripe because I what I wrote down

931
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:30,360
is that this is maybe my least favorite theme park scene ever.

932
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:33,640
The club scene before the dancing at the.

933
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:38,120
Yes. I called it the the shoved in the center dance party.

934
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:42,800
All of these people like oddly crouched together and being very still.

935
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:47,120
Let's dance, but not in such a way that our feet go anywhere that we leave this.

936
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:50,240
It's like they're they're in like an invisible cage,

937
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:53,320
like they'll trip a wire if they go slightly to the left to the right.

938
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:56,280
And then they get as soon as you see it.

939
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:58,600
What's that? You're not amazed by Mr.

940
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:00,440
Pepper's ghost.

941
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:04,160
I mean, sure, I guess I always like that.

942
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:09,760
And I like the that. Hey, it's a it's one of those Muzin holograms.

943
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:12,000
You know, a Muzin hologram.

944
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:16,160
I kept seeing that on theme park review sites as if I knew what that was,

945
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:18,240
like which is achieved via a Muzin hologram.

946
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:20,000
I don't know what a Muzin is.

947
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,320
That's a weird word.

948
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:23,800
I don't like the word Muzin.

949
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:26,600
It seems like something that would be wrong with your body.

950
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:29,160
Like if some weird if like, I don't know, like

951
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:33,040
like parts of your genitals are fusing together, that shouldn't be.

952
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:35,560
You're experiencing general Muzin.

953
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:38,200
Do you know what is it?

954
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:39,720
General Muzin?

955
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:42,360
No, no. What is the Muzin like illusion?

956
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:44,040
It might be a company name.

957
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:46,440
I don't know. As opposed to a style.

958
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:48,480
I don't hear a Muzin hologram.

959
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:52,680
It's not the holograms owned by that that evil guy, Alki.

960
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:56,040
Yeah, Muzin.

961
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:57,800
I look it's called Muzin.

962
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:00,360
It's a system. It's called Muzin eyeliner.

963
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:04,520
Infusingly, it sounds like a makeup, but it's not that.

964
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:08,640
It's it is a

965
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:10,760
Pepper's Ghost type thing.

966
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:15,960
It's invented by a guy named Ove Moss, M-A-A-S-S.

967
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:19,480
And I'd have to look further into it.

968
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:21,760
I guess it's been a long round for a while.

969
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:23,640
Just a weird word. What is it?

970
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:25,960
What does it mean? What is Muzin?

971
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:28,000
And you just Googled it and it doesn't have a definition?

972
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:30,880
Doesn't explain. No, it's just Muzin holograms are.

973
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:33,280
It's not somebody's last name, I don't think.

974
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:35,840
I don't know where this word comes from.

975
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:37,720
Jason, do you do you agree with me?

976
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:40,280
This is the best part. Or do you just are you in the middle?

977
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:47,360
Um, I I kind of like no, I like it a few minutes later.

978
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:48,920
I think the best part.

979
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:50,720
You mean when they show up and stuff?

980
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:54,200
When everyone comes in, like because I like that, too.

981
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:55,600
You know what I think it is?

982
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:57,400
I'm really trying to analyze here what it is.

983
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:59,520
Yeah, I like OK.

984
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:00,560
I like the effect a lot.

985
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:02,920
I think the effect actually is pretty cool.

986
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:06,720
I think it's reminding me of when I get to go like once

987
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:10,080
every other year to a douchey Vegas pool party or something.

988
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:12,480
I think, oh, yeah, which I don't like.

989
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:14,520
I like Vegas and I don't. Yeah, I don't.

990
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:19,640
I love why you do she Vegas pool party loud, loud, like just

991
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:23,440
the rattling your heart base loudness.

992
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:25,240
I love that.

993
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:26,880
So maybe that's what this is.

994
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:32,000
Maybe I'm starting to sort of feel like I'm at this big weird party.

995
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:35,000
I think I like it in the movies.

996
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:38,040
I like when they have the crazy parties in the movies, like when they go to

997
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:43,400
the unfortunately named Race Wars in the first one, which is God.

998
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:48,560
In the first, in the first movie, there's a big street racing event

999
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:53,880
in like Coachella Palm Springs area, and it's called Race Wars.

1000
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:58,240
I don't know if that's supposed to be a joke or just no one thought to like

1001
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:02,800
do another read pass on the racing wars.

1002
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:04,320
They're fixed there.

1003
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:09,560
Yeah, but yeah, but I like I like the parties in the movies,

1004
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:14,640
but in just them dancing in this, I feel like there's just so many conceits.

1005
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:17,680
I'm just a little tired from all the things that's like, OK,

1006
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:20,400
I think I witness Shaw's after them.

1007
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:24,040
The diplomat of the rock is here.

1008
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:28,440
The crew, the family is going to protect us.

1009
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:31,520
That that we don't know until a second later.

1010
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:34,080
They said we would be safe in this garage.

1011
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:38,040
And then Tyrese comes in with a bunch of ladies.

1012
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:40,600
The FBI agent pulls a gun on him.

1013
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:44,640
You know, I don't want to do it just to say a little more about this dance party.

1014
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:48,960
I don't like about it because I don't object to the I don't like all

1015
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:51,440
a dance party is fine with me.

1016
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:55,920
I think that the problem is that, you know, if for anybody who deals

1017
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:59,560
with with video or anything, the dull issue of title safe

1018
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:03,760
that you have to in a frame, put everything a little bit in the center.

1019
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:07,440
So in case the TV cuts something off, that it'll all be you'll see everything.

1020
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:09,240
Nothing. No words will get cut off in the.

1021
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:10,920
So you keep it in the title safe area.

1022
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:13,000
This is a title safe dance party.

1023
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:17,080
Everybody you enter a room and then there's like margins.

1024
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:21,520
Like a P like a word document, there's margins in this dance party.

1025
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:24,120
And I understand they have to do that to pull the effect off.

1026
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:27,440
But it never this would never bother me when you're looking at just Ray

1027
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:29,960
and Rise of the Resistance, because it's only one person

1028
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:32,520
when you're trying to get 50 people into one room.

1029
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:36,400
And now you have to just like, and don't do not shimmy

1030
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:40,200
to the left or the right whatsoever or you'll get cut off.

1031
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:44,320
It's unfortunately the only part of the ride they made title safe,

1032
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:49,000
because depending on where you sit, you might miss a significant portion.

1033
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,840
Yeah, no, no joke.

1034
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:54,720
I didn't know until reviewing a YouTube channel

1035
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:57,760
that showed the right side of the ride and the left side of the ride.

1036
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:02,040
I didn't know if the rock was in the ride ride part

1037
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:04,520
because I'd never seen some people,

1038
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:07,560
some of the body count of the ride.

1039
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:09,680
Oh, he does some of the murdering. OK. Yeah.

1040
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:14,360
I think you guys are expecting too much of this new technology of the

1041
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:16,640
fusion.

1042
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:18,280
Manu shit, Steve Manu Shins,

1043
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:20,800
how would you Manu Shins hologram company?

1044
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:24,280
Yeah, it did cost six hundred dollars too.

1045
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:27,880
And that's a great topical joke.

1046
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:32,080
Manu Shins produced a fist fight and he produced a fusion hologram.

1047
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:33,360
Yeah.

1048
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,960
That's right. Right. He's the movie producer.

1049
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:39,480
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

1050
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:42,760
The next gen, I think, will be able to get as many dancers

1051
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:46,720
as possible in a warehouse, as many great ghost dancers.

1052
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:48,520
I think that's coming.

1053
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:50,680
OK, OK. So yeah, a little more.

1054
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:52,320
Just don't make it so obvious.

1055
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:53,880
Don't play.

1056
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:56,240
I can see I can see the lines. I can see the margins anyway.

1057
00:52:56,840 --> 00:53:00,040
Yes. So they all are you.

1058
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:03,720
You land and then they're all asked to leave as soon as you've seen them

1059
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:05,240
for the first time.

1060
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:11,600
And then and then Tyrese comes in and then the and then

1061
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:16,360
a an FBI agent who's like, you can I guess I should have include in

1062
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:21,040
that he's not one of the leads of this film franchise because he doesn't

1063
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:24,360
really carry it as much as they do.

1064
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:29,480
Mm hmm. I'm remembering now that when you said they got dismissed,

1065
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:33,600
my memory is that we go through like like we see like here.

1066
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:36,240
OK, I'm unlocking a memory now here.

1067
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:37,440
Sorry to go back.

1068
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:42,480
But the first time I ever went on this, it broke down, I believe, five times

1069
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:45,400
in a row. We did not get to go.

1070
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:47,880
We it kept turning around and going back in.

1071
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:54,320
So I was in the dancing area stuck for a long, long time,

1072
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:57,920
like like minutes and minutes and minutes.

1073
00:53:58,120 --> 00:54:01,720
And then we go in, the ride would break and then we'd have to go out

1074
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:04,120
and turn around and try to do it again.

1075
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:09,320
So I think I've sort of been like I have a comfort with the part,

1076
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:10,960
the dancing part.

1077
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:13,840
And that's also why I think it lasts longer than what you just explained,

1078
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:16,240
that it was a quick thing and they're dismissed.

1079
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:17,520
The OK.

1080
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:20,240
And maybe you like it in a Stockholm syndrome,

1081
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:23,520
where you were trapped, so you had no choice but to start to like

1082
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:25,520
this odd hologram dance party.

1083
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:26,720
Yes, that's wow.

1084
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:29,560
I was with a friend of the show, Andrew Grissom, I believe.

1085
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:31,560
Mm hmm. How does he feel?

1086
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:35,240
I haven't asked him recently.

1087
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:37,560
I think we both were like, OK.

1088
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:39,040
Yeah, all right.

1089
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:40,440
Mm hmm.

1090
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:44,240
Agent Novak, original theme park, I.B.

1091
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:45,560
Agent Novak.

1092
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:49,800
Agent Novak, he he pulls a gun on Tyrese.

1093
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:52,120
Tyrese says, we don't work for you.

1094
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:57,080
And that's when an elevator is activated

1095
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:02,120
and the big hero shot here comes Dominic Toretto and Letty

1096
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:05,280
on a big like Mack truck.

1097
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:08,240
And he says, we don't work for no one.

1098
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:13,280
Now, this I like that is the moving physical set piece.

1099
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:15,640
And then and then the holograms are on it.

1100
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:18,040
I will give it up to that. That is very cool.

1101
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:20,680
I like this too.

1102
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:26,240
And I believe Agent Novak says something about I'm the one holding the gun.

1103
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:30,720
And that's when the rock comes in and says, yeah, but mine's a whole lot bigger

1104
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:33,120
because he has like a giant assault rifle.

1105
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:38,400
And I have been on this experience before,

1106
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:42,000
and I've seen people cheer like when these characters show up.

1107
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:43,960
Yeah. Well, he always gets one.

1108
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:46,640
Yeah. That's the idea of the rock gets applause.

1109
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:52,280
I'll say and I'll after we finish Hollywood, I will explain my experience

1110
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:54,360
as the only one who wrote it in Orlando.

1111
00:55:56,720 --> 00:56:00,880
People do like to see famous people in their rides

1112
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:03,560
playing the characters they know and love.

1113
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:07,160
So I do understand that part.

1114
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:09,440
I do understand people like, yeah, it's the whole gang.

1115
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:11,360
The whole family is here.

1116
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:13,880
Yeah. Sure. Yeah, it makes sense to me.

1117
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:15,160
Yeah. Yeah.

1118
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:20,360
What doesn't make sense is why the the rock comes in with a big gun.

1119
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:25,440
By the way, a lot of guns in that is maybe the gunniest attraction

1120
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:28,400
in of the 2010s.

1121
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:31,120
Like there's a holdovers of attractions full of guns

1122
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:32,560
where you can't do anything about it.

1123
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:37,920
But like kind of weird that, especially in 2018, like do a big gun show.

1124
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:41,920
It's like there's probably the same amount on like Transformers,

1125
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:44,680
but since like the guns are in a robot's arm,

1126
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:47,640
it doesn't read exactly like that.

1127
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:50,920
And it's like, yeah, so if a robot has a gun arm,

1128
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:53,120
it doesn't read as bad as.

1129
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:56,000
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That makes sense.

1130
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,880
But anyway, he'd like, yeah, his entrance is cool

1131
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:02,480
and he gets applause and lifts a big thing and makes a cookie, puts joke.

1132
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:05,200
But then everybody just kind of like files out of the room.

1133
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:06,520
Nobody runs.

1134
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:09,920
It's just kind of like, all right, well, we're in a load up

1135
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:12,960
stroll, stroll, stroll.

1136
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:15,040
It's like everybody taking a lunch break.

1137
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:18,600
OK, because you need to establish another premise

1138
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:20,840
that you have to turn off your phones.

1139
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:25,160
You can't take pictures because then Shaw can track your location

1140
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:28,480
and he'll he'll show up and kill everyone.

1141
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:31,520
And it should be noted, no one fires a gun.

1142
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:34,480
These guys just don't fire guns. Shaw has a flamethrower.

1143
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:38,000
I guess a helicopter has a gun, but it's sort of like in Batman.

1144
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,280
We're like, well, Batman's not pulling out a handgun,

1145
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:43,280
but the Batmobile has a gun

1146
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:48,000
and there's a giant gun that just runs through people.

1147
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:49,920
Yeah, the Lincoln.

1148
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:55,000
So yeah, it it it there is the conceit that they can track you.

1149
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:58,120
And then, of course, Tyrese takes a phone call and it's like

1150
00:57:58,560 --> 00:58:00,840
and then the diesel very casually.

1151
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:02,480
Vin Diesel or Michelle Wright.

1152
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:05,640
Someone goes, well, Shaw knows where you where we are now.

1153
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:11,960
No one tosses it off the stakes or nobody's concerned.

1154
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:17,040
Just know that it feels like this attraction should have been a show

1155
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:21,440
and it should have been just like stopped here, had all your favorites,

1156
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:24,600
and they just do a little show for you and you drive out.

1157
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:27,320
We don't need the action adventure part.

1158
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:30,080
We just like hanging out with our friends for a little while here.

1159
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:32,520
Yeah, like motor action.

1160
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:38,680
I guess I like this part a little more, maybe than the like,

1161
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:42,520
despite my problems with the title safe dance party, it I like.

1162
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:44,240
All right. Well, this will.

1163
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:47,280
So this is kind of fun and they're all a little funny.

1164
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:50,560
And so the finale of this is going to blow me away.

1165
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:54,800
But then and then you go in.

1166
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:58,480
And if if it's my experience, half the time it works,

1167
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:01,600
half the time, all of a sudden, it's just like the screens are what you wheel

1168
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:06,080
into, like a room with just white screens on the side and drive right out.

1169
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:11,080
But yeah, if it's working, if it's working,

1170
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:15,240
you're transported to a parking garage underground, baby.

1171
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:19,080
That is Jurassic Parking.

1172
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:21,760
It has the you can see the T-Rex on it.

1173
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:23,640
You're in a parking.

1174
00:59:23,640 --> 00:59:26,040
That's very funny. I did not ever catch that.

1175
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:28,080
I didn't catch that either. That's great.

1176
00:59:28,080 --> 00:59:30,640
Yeah. All right. Now I like it more.

1177
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:31,760
And immediately.

1178
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:34,680
So I remember my reaction is immediately when we're on this.

1179
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:38,320
And I was like, oh, it's exactly it's just Kong again.

1180
00:59:38,320 --> 00:59:41,120
And which is a worse version of Transformers.

1181
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:45,160
I remember like my initial feeling of like kind of disappointment

1182
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:47,800
because I was hoping they had used some like crazy new technology.

1183
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:50,080
I knew it wasn't going to be a crazy roller coaster or anything.

1184
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:53,000
But I just remember being like, OK, all right, all right.

1185
00:59:53,560 --> 00:59:57,080
Got it. Which if you haven't done any of this, you're sort of sandwiched

1186
00:59:57,080 --> 00:59:59,520
between two giant screens

1187
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:04,600
that are very tall, that feel oddly close to the track.

1188
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:06,960
It's an interesting effect.

1189
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:11,920
But it's it's it's tough because it is just obstructed.

1190
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:15,320
It's just a really obstructed view,

1191
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:18,960
which like works a little better in King Kong because you feel like

1192
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:22,920
our in the jungle and it's sort of chaos and what's coming through those trees.

1193
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:26,040
Oh, it's it's calling like it feels like you're on a safari.

1194
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:30,680
Like the inability to see is a little more and you forgive it maybe.

1195
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:34,600
But here this feels a little more like you're supposed to understand

1196
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:36,120
and comprehend everything.

1197
01:00:36,120 --> 01:00:38,880
Right, because you're moving to I mean, like the whole,

1198
01:00:39,240 --> 01:00:42,560
you know, you're trying to go fast, you're moving fast and fast and furious.

1199
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:46,680
But like there's the sections where like you're kind of tangled in trees

1200
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:50,280
or vines on King Kong, you're kind of stationary.

1201
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:53,800
You're moving a little bit and like it's teasing that you're going to fall or whatever.

1202
01:00:54,120 --> 01:00:57,280
But in general, like if you're just stationary

1203
01:00:57,280 --> 01:00:59,920
and like stuff is happening on the screens around you,

1204
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:04,640
you can take that all in more versus the tram, which is not

1205
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:10,680
like a Transformers vehicle that reacts so well with screens or anything.

1206
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:12,520
The tram was not built for this.

1207
01:01:12,520 --> 01:01:14,680
The tram is an old tram.

1208
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:18,520
It doesn't have any cool effects to really give you like the illusion

1209
01:01:18,520 --> 01:01:20,880
that you're have any G-Force going on.

1210
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:23,840
So that's why I feel like it just doesn't work as well.

1211
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:27,200
Well, and it Kong is a simpler story.

1212
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:32,440
The short, you know, three minute it and they they do a good job of splitting.

1213
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:36,840
Like, well, here's half of Kong fighting a dinosaur on this side of the screen.

1214
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:40,800
And then he literally climbs over the top and then he fights

1215
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:42,720
more on this side of the screen.

1216
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:47,960
But Dominic Toretto is not like if you sit on the one end of the tour,

1217
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:50,120
you get a lot of the rock.

1218
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:52,840
You sit on the other side, you get a lot of Dom and Letty.

1219
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:56,640
And if you break it down even further, the story is that they hook up

1220
01:01:56,640 --> 01:02:01,200
two trucks without trailers on them and you're towed really fast.

1221
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:03,360
Like Triple A tows you.

1222
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:07,200
And it's a towing. It's the same.

1223
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:08,760
Sorry, I stepped all over that.

1224
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:09,680
That's funny.

1225
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:12,320
Yeah, it's like this.

1226
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:16,440
And it's what I was saying before, it's like the same effect as minions,

1227
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:19,800
Transformers, Spider-Man, all of those rides.

1228
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:23,280
There's a hook that gets attached to your vehicle to make you go.

1229
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:27,960
Only the difference is you're just you're on a much less exciting vehicle.

1230
01:02:28,040 --> 01:02:30,640
It's an old tram and it just doesn't react at all.

1231
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:32,960
Real a little bit to the movements.

1232
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:34,720
So it's like, OK.

1233
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:38,080
And then and then to the you're talking about seeing the characters, it's like

1234
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:40,040
Kong is giant.

1235
01:02:40,040 --> 01:02:43,080
At the very least, you get to see a giant monkey head on the screen.

1236
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:45,880
You're like squeal. You're like, I think that's Dom.

1237
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:47,920
I think that's the rock.

1238
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:49,000
I guess.

1239
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:52,400
And then I'm on a less good version of the universal

1240
01:02:52,680 --> 01:02:55,480
dragging you through a screen trick.

1241
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:59,160
Well, and someone points out because at one point that should be very cool.

1242
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:03,520
Dom jumps out of his car and on to the bottom of a helicopter.

1243
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:10,080
And at a lot of that point, he is the same size as the helicopter.

1244
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:15,400
Because the way they film this, they had the actors in front of green screens

1245
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:20,640
and then everything is CGI and the CGI sets the CGI city streets.

1246
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:22,480
Everything is aging.

1247
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:25,320
Was it aging immediately in 2015?

1248
01:03:25,320 --> 01:03:30,640
It started. The clock started ticking on that PlayStation 4 quality.

1249
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:33,640
Yeah. Is there I have not seen all the Fast and Furious movies.

1250
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:36,000
Is there one where Vin Diesel grows giant?

1251
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:40,080
No, that would be cool.

1252
01:03:40,080 --> 01:03:43,480
Is that on the table, though, to the I asked the producers of Fast and Furious.

1253
01:03:43,480 --> 01:03:48,040
Is Vin Diesel growing giant possible mid jump?

1254
01:03:48,080 --> 01:03:52,560
He jumps out of a car and by the end of the jump, he's 70 feet tall.

1255
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:57,520
Fantastic. Yeah, he'll be like a ant man or something like just let's let's do it.

1256
01:03:57,760 --> 01:04:01,160
Why not? I'm going to see if I can get a good loop.

1257
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:05,720
Just like a gif of the of him jumping onto that helicopter.

1258
01:04:05,720 --> 01:04:09,680
It's so weird that the proportions change like crazy.

1259
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:11,000
The frame rate.

1260
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:14,760
I don't know is the is the frame rate of this 12 frames a second

1261
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:16,960
or 700 frames a second.

1262
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:19,320
It's something weird either way.

1263
01:04:19,320 --> 01:04:22,680
It goes back and forth between those two constantly shifting.

1264
01:04:23,160 --> 01:04:24,920
Hi, there's there's a lot.

1265
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:27,320
All this is happening in like different cars.

1266
01:04:27,720 --> 01:04:34,080
Letty runs Luke Evans's car off like the road, like off a freeway.

1267
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:39,440
The rock runs a car off the road with his big like assault vehicle car.

1268
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:42,160
Yeah, a lot's happening.

1269
01:04:42,680 --> 01:04:43,360
It's OK.

1270
01:04:43,360 --> 01:04:48,560
It's not a bad idea for an experience because like, no, it's just like this is not.

1271
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:53,760
It's probably very hard to render all this stuff, make it because like

1272
01:04:54,320 --> 01:04:57,040
there's like a lot of angle tricks with the screen.

1273
01:04:57,040 --> 01:05:00,880
And depending on which part of the car you're at, things look bigger and smaller.

1274
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:04,480
It's just there's so many variables for that experience.

1275
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:09,040
Like if it was just a VR thing, like with the basically the same premise

1276
01:05:09,040 --> 01:05:13,080
and the same like track or whatever, I think it's probably much cooler.

1277
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:18,320
I bet this looks like good on somebody's headset, like somebody there.

1278
01:05:18,320 --> 01:05:21,640
There must have been a test of this where you sat and did it and were like, holy shit.

1279
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:24,560
And then just once it moved to that tram, right.

1280
01:05:25,080 --> 01:05:28,480
Then you stretched out and like the person in the front of the tram is like

1281
01:05:28,920 --> 01:05:31,240
trying to peering back, trying to see it.

1282
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:34,000
And it doesn't really hold up as well.

1283
01:05:35,360 --> 01:05:38,880
So, yeah, I mean, like I did Mario Kart VR in Japan.

1284
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:40,880
Which I think they close that place, right?

1285
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:42,160
By the time you were there, Scott.

1286
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:43,640
Yeah, I didn't get to do it.

1287
01:05:43,640 --> 01:05:46,600
Oh, they've since yeah, they were sued that company.

1288
01:05:47,160 --> 01:05:51,560
Oh, but like Mario Kart is not as fast as Fast and Furious,

1289
01:05:51,560 --> 01:05:54,120
but the Mario Kart VR was amazing.

1290
01:05:54,320 --> 01:05:56,960
It was so good. Yeah.

1291
01:05:56,960 --> 01:05:58,680
So, yeah, I can imagine.

1292
01:05:58,680 --> 01:05:59,960
I'm sorry, not the VR.

1293
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:04,720
The Mario Kart go kart on the streets of Tokyo were sued by the Nintendo people, I believe.

1294
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:07,920
Oh, yes, yes. There was a and I didn't do it,

1295
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:08,920
but we saw them.

1296
01:06:08,920 --> 01:06:12,000
We saw them when we were in the like the video game district,

1297
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:16,360
essentially, like the people on tours like with Mario and Luigi hats,

1298
01:06:16,520 --> 01:06:20,240
driving go karts around the city streets, which I was like, that's cool.

1299
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:22,200
But also like seems dangerous.

1300
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:23,560
It seems like not a good idea.

1301
01:06:23,560 --> 01:06:24,840
No interest.

1302
01:06:24,840 --> 01:06:27,520
And yeah, no, I didn't really want to do it,

1303
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:29,960
although I guess maybe to review it, I should have. But.

1304
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:35,040
Hmm. Yeah. Oh, well, we'll review it when it opens in Hollywood.

1305
01:06:35,080 --> 01:06:39,760
Yeah, I don't.

1306
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:43,840
You know, even as you're you talk about this more simple story of Kong,

1307
01:06:44,440 --> 01:06:48,120
like, OK, take all of this backstory on all of this stuff about, OK,

1308
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:51,440
but now Shaw heard the cell phone and that like

1309
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:56,360
once the ride part begins, the big screens, what is happening?

1310
01:06:56,640 --> 01:07:02,440
Are they they're transporting us to keep the witness safe?

1311
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:04,200
Is that it?

1312
01:07:04,760 --> 01:07:08,680
Yeah. And they they they take out Shaw and the bad guys.

1313
01:07:09,040 --> 01:07:13,000
And then I think a bridges out and he yells, hit the nitrous.

1314
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:17,960
And then he screams, ride or die, which I believe is said in the movies

1315
01:07:18,560 --> 01:07:20,280
pretty regularly. Right.

1316
01:07:20,280 --> 01:07:23,440
I think not as often as family.

1317
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:24,640
But ride or die.

1318
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:26,440
And that's kind of cool.

1319
01:07:26,440 --> 01:07:30,480
But I want to jump ahead a little and mention before I forget,

1320
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:35,040
the ride ends with you landing in a warehouse full of shipping containers.

1321
01:07:35,320 --> 01:07:39,600
That's the exciting and the CGI warehouse.

1322
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:43,760
Everything is CGI because they did the actors in front of green screens.

1323
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:47,480
And then they they did it all CGI and everyone was just like, what?

1324
01:07:47,880 --> 01:07:49,200
What is this?

1325
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:53,560
It's an abrupt ending to like this, this, that this part,

1326
01:07:53,560 --> 01:07:56,240
the big screen part is only 90 seconds.

1327
01:07:56,520 --> 01:07:59,120
So you're kind of like, what already?

1328
01:07:59,120 --> 01:08:01,000
Yeah, it feels very short.

1329
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,600
I don't do we know how long the Kong part of the Tramp Tour is?

1330
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:06,920
It feels longer, but it might not be that much longer.

1331
01:08:07,360 --> 01:08:12,120
Yeah. But, you know, it is disorienting for sure.

1332
01:08:12,200 --> 01:08:14,920
And it's all of a sudden, yeah, you're in a CGI warehouse.

1333
01:08:15,320 --> 01:08:17,600
You're also getting I don't know where Jason, where would you plus it up?

1334
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:20,120
Where would you prefer they land?

1335
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:25,640
I don't I think just the premise in general, like it really

1336
01:08:25,760 --> 01:08:30,120
toes the line between like this is a moviemaking experience and like these

1337
01:08:30,120 --> 01:08:32,440
characters are real. You live in this world now.

1338
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:34,160
Dominic Toretto is real.

1339
01:08:34,160 --> 01:08:36,680
And if you keep it simple, you can get away with that.

1340
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:40,200
Like Universal got away with like Ghostbusters are real once you enter this

1341
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:42,160
building in Florida. You know?

1342
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:44,560
Well, OK, I have I have a plus up.

1343
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:48,320
They still land in the CGI warehouse.

1344
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:53,880
But then two of the cars start dancing, dancing against Alina.

1345
01:08:54,200 --> 01:08:57,480
Carnaval party going on in the warehouse.

1346
01:08:57,680 --> 01:09:00,520
Yeah. Like in the end of Minion Mayhem.

1347
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:03,320
There's a part there's a big adoption party.

1348
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:06,440
Well, yes. Here's the whole thing.

1349
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:10,680
They did not to I don't want to jump on what you're going to say about Orlando,

1350
01:09:10,680 --> 01:09:12,560
but they push this even harder in Orlando.

1351
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:15,760
The plot is more is a party to get to.

1352
01:09:15,760 --> 01:09:19,280
Oh, but wait, a bunch of stuff happening in Shaw and all this.

1353
01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:24,160
So weird that the whole thing is about OK,

1354
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:26,120
so there's a party and you're on route to the party.

1355
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:28,840
And when you see the party bus, it's going to be great because of the party lights.

1356
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:30,760
So get ready and then soon you'll be at the party.

1357
01:09:30,760 --> 01:09:33,080
Oh, a distraction. It's going to take us away from the party.

1358
01:09:33,320 --> 01:09:35,840
And then where's the party?

1359
01:09:35,840 --> 01:09:36,960
There's no party.

1360
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:40,280
We forget about the party and is the party the gift shop?

1361
01:09:40,680 --> 01:09:41,560
There's no payoff.

1362
01:09:41,560 --> 01:09:44,080
The party know the gift shop is a supply store.

1363
01:09:44,360 --> 01:09:46,760
No, there is no party.

1364
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:49,320
And the fireworks factory all over again.

1365
01:09:49,320 --> 01:09:51,960
We're going to get to Toretto's party.

1366
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:55,160
Is the party the dancing at the beginning?

1367
01:09:55,160 --> 01:10:00,520
Was that do we zoom past the party and then there isn't another party at the end?

1368
01:10:00,720 --> 01:10:02,000
Oh, that must be it, right?

1369
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,120
I think that's the party.

1370
01:10:04,120 --> 01:10:06,200
All right. Yeah, that must be the party.

1371
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,600
This is a good transition into Orlando

1372
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:13,840
because Orlando takes place in the San Francisco section of the park,

1373
01:10:14,080 --> 01:10:17,160
never mind the fact that the CGI streets

1374
01:10:17,160 --> 01:10:19,800
and the ride are clearly the streets of Los Angeles.

1375
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:22,360
Ignore that town L.A.

1376
01:10:22,360 --> 01:10:25,040
Yeah, so yeah.

1377
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:31,160
So this in in Florida, this ride replaced disaster.

1378
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:34,480
Major motion picture ride, dot dot dot starring you.

1379
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:37,000
And of course, Beetlejuice's graveyard review.

1380
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:41,360
So in this house, we are already have a grudge going against this ride.

1381
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:47,720
And so you go in through the streets of San Francisco and there's a lot of cars.

1382
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:50,560
There's like cool cars everywhere.

1383
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:56,560
And you go in through like a big brick building, big brick front.

1384
01:10:56,880 --> 01:10:58,080
There's cool cars.

1385
01:10:58,080 --> 01:11:02,680
And then you're in a garage, a lot of garage cues.

1386
01:11:04,840 --> 01:11:09,920
Look, the cars are cool, but these cues are just empty rooms.

1387
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:13,120
They put barrels and tires and some cars like it's.

1388
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:18,440
Yes. And the building itself is just a brick building with a fence.

1389
01:11:19,240 --> 01:11:24,120
Yes. It's like one of the worst facades of an attraction.

1390
01:11:24,120 --> 01:11:27,560
And not like Rise of the Resistance, they do in such a way where it's like,

1391
01:11:27,560 --> 01:11:29,920
there's no big here's the Rise of the Resistance.

1392
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:32,120
It's like, oh, is this a ride?

1393
01:11:32,120 --> 01:11:36,200
And you know, like you're subtly navigating through this little forest thing.

1394
01:11:36,440 --> 01:11:38,920
You could do that or you could just have a little bit of a

1395
01:11:38,920 --> 01:11:41,160
or you could just have just a building.

1396
01:11:41,160 --> 01:11:42,320
I it's kind of.

1397
01:11:42,320 --> 01:11:45,760
Well, I think they wanted to keep the facade that looks like the chocolate company.

1398
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:50,560
I always say the wrong pronunciation of from Delhi, San Francisco.

1399
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:51,560
Yeah, Ghirardelli.

1400
01:11:51,560 --> 01:11:53,600
Oh, it's that building. It used to be a Ghirardelli.

1401
01:11:53,800 --> 01:11:55,520
Yeah, it's kind of that.

1402
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:59,280
It's just a replica of like the headquarters in San Francisco.

1403
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:01,520
The front of it.

1404
01:12:02,240 --> 01:12:06,000
And I guess the pre show money went to like the cue money,

1405
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,920
went to the the two different pre show rooms

1406
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:13,520
where where you are met by Pat and Jamie,

1407
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:18,360
gender neutral team members who are help the crew.

1408
01:12:18,840 --> 01:12:24,640
And I I heard a rumor that these team members are pulled

1409
01:12:24,920 --> 01:12:28,240
not from the entertainment division where actors are staffed,

1410
01:12:28,240 --> 01:12:30,360
but from the operations division.

1411
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:35,160
And that would explain why they are often stiff,

1412
01:12:35,160 --> 01:12:38,320
even by theme park standards.

1413
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:43,080
Yeah. So it's interesting to me, though, that they were like,

1414
01:12:43,080 --> 01:12:45,040
well, we got to make some changes, you know, because it's going to be bigger.

1415
01:12:45,040 --> 01:12:48,600
And they were like more pre shows, more pre shows.

1416
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:54,560
We got Pat and Jamie who talked to Ludacris and Jordana Brewster.

1417
01:12:55,160 --> 01:12:59,880
And and and then clearly they didn't want to just reuse the footage of

1418
01:12:59,960 --> 01:13:01,920
a they didn't.

1419
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:06,120
Vin Diesel and the Rock show up as like waveform phone calls.

1420
01:13:06,760 --> 01:13:11,640
But Ludacris and Jordana Brewster are like shot as it.

1421
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:15,240
I keep saying like I'm shot on an iPhone, but they are shot like they are Face

1422
01:13:15,240 --> 01:13:20,240
Timing in and they deliver the lines with the brakes for the cast member to say,

1423
01:13:20,240 --> 01:13:21,840
like, what should we do next?

1424
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:26,120
Tej. OK, Pat, listen, I got party buses coming

1425
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:29,400
because that's a big difference from Orlando.

1426
01:13:29,400 --> 01:13:31,760
The vehicle is not a tram. It's not the tram.

1427
01:13:31,960 --> 01:13:33,640
It's a party bus.

1428
01:13:33,640 --> 01:13:35,200
And now this I love.

1429
01:13:35,200 --> 01:13:39,880
This is my only thing I love is that it's a party bus.

1430
01:13:39,880 --> 01:13:41,080
There's no other ride.

1431
01:13:41,080 --> 01:13:44,760
That's a party bus before. Like, there's a guy like this idea.

1432
01:13:44,760 --> 01:13:46,480
I I'm pleased with this.

1433
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:48,120
It's kind of it's kind of good.

1434
01:13:48,120 --> 01:13:50,600
It shows up flashing colors, kind of neon.

1435
01:13:50,600 --> 01:13:52,920
Yes, I like the view. Yeah.

1436
01:13:53,480 --> 01:13:56,280
You like the party bus and we like the party.

1437
01:13:56,480 --> 01:13:58,280
We like we like the party bus.

1438
01:13:58,280 --> 01:14:00,680
We like the party bus. Party bus.

1439
01:14:00,680 --> 01:14:03,240
Like ding ding ding ding ding.

1440
01:14:03,240 --> 01:14:05,760
That that that we did not again.

1441
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:07,680
Scott and I did not go on this.

1442
01:14:07,680 --> 01:14:09,240
Jason is the only one who went on it.

1443
01:14:09,240 --> 01:14:11,120
It was a packed date universal.

1444
01:14:11,120 --> 01:14:14,520
We all had things to do and we both made the decision.

1445
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:17,680
Doesn't seem like it's worth it, does it?

1446
01:14:17,680 --> 01:14:20,880
Well, I had I only had to get back to Cabana Bay.

1447
01:14:22,200 --> 01:14:24,040
Scott, did you?

1448
01:14:24,040 --> 01:14:26,360
Yeah, I was staying on property at that point.

1449
01:14:27,080 --> 01:14:31,880
So I literally this was the last thing I did before flying back to Los Angeles.

1450
01:14:31,880 --> 01:14:33,120
I did this ride.

1451
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:37,320
I ate up a solid pizza at that pizza place in City Walk.

1452
01:14:37,560 --> 01:14:40,920
Then I went back to the hotel and got my luggage and then gotten a lift.

1453
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:45,280
And I was just like shaking my head, eating that pizza.

1454
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:48,240
I was like, the last ride I did was Superchar.

1455
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:51,480
Oh, man. What was I thinking?

1456
01:14:52,080 --> 01:14:55,600
Yeah. So that was a more the lift ride was probably a better ride.

1457
01:14:57,240 --> 01:14:59,240
More immersive, more interactive. Yeah.

1458
01:15:00,200 --> 01:15:02,600
Yeah. So Jason has the first hand experience.

1459
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:06,680
But from watching the video, I guess the party bus is good.

1460
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:08,520
Yeah, I like it.

1461
01:15:08,520 --> 01:15:11,440
And probably you can see more than the tram because you don't have another thing

1462
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:12,880
right in front of you. Right.

1463
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:15,640
It's a little more tooled for the experience.

1464
01:15:15,640 --> 01:15:17,320
Well, and you know what?

1465
01:15:17,320 --> 01:15:20,640
What is much clearer in Orlando?

1466
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:24,680
Just how many times in the Orlando experience they say family,

1467
01:15:25,040 --> 01:15:29,480
because they say family a lot in these movies, but the movies are two hours long.

1468
01:15:29,880 --> 01:15:31,440
And so it's kind of distributed.

1469
01:15:31,440 --> 01:15:34,120
The Orlando experience is like under 10 minutes.

1470
01:15:34,360 --> 01:15:38,640
So when you hear like our family will protect you, you're part of our family now.

1471
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:41,800
And don't worry, our whole family's got looking out for your back.

1472
01:15:42,160 --> 01:15:46,560
You know, it's it almost seems like they're making fun of you.

1473
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:51,560
They're all they're saying like, we're you think we're family.

1474
01:15:51,560 --> 01:15:53,920
Fuck you. Yeah.

1475
01:15:54,240 --> 01:15:57,000
On on that note about the repetition of family,

1476
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:00,480
I have a clip from the opening of this attraction,

1477
01:16:00,760 --> 01:16:04,840
which had pretty high penetration of the cast.

1478
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:07,080
It is a remarkable amount of the cast.

1479
01:16:07,080 --> 01:16:11,920
Ludacris is there and Tyrese and I think you're Dan and Brewster and then.

1480
01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:17,200
But it all builds up to a stunt car arrival of Vin Diesel,

1481
01:16:18,280 --> 01:16:21,640
who then once he gets on stage,

1482
01:16:22,040 --> 01:16:25,200
I just what I don't have is the first part.

1483
01:16:25,200 --> 01:16:28,840
You know, there's the theme parky thing of hang.

1484
01:16:28,840 --> 01:16:30,520
I can't hear you.

1485
01:16:30,520 --> 01:16:34,000
And then, you know, saying it as I say, so this is he's already said this once.

1486
01:16:34,240 --> 01:16:38,320
And then this is his second escalated time to really pump up the crowd.

1487
01:16:39,720 --> 01:16:43,520
Who wants to be a part of the family?

1488
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:48,720
Who want to be part of the family?

1489
01:16:49,240 --> 01:16:50,240
And

1490
01:16:52,200 --> 01:16:56,080
pretty addictive, honestly, I was kind of that was that's been rattling

1491
01:16:56,080 --> 01:16:58,560
in my head for 24 hours.

1492
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:02,560
I mean, I think he also yells.

1493
01:17:02,600 --> 01:17:04,400
I wrote this quote down.

1494
01:17:04,400 --> 01:17:08,920
I then he yells, who wants to see this ride?

1495
01:17:08,920 --> 01:17:13,480
I don't know why he chose to deliver those lines like Eric Andre.

1496
01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:15,600
That's what it's like.

1497
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:17,720
I knew that was like something comedy.

1498
01:17:17,720 --> 01:17:19,840
Absolute God. Yes.

1499
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:24,840
He is he's earnestly doing Eric Andre insanity

1500
01:17:24,840 --> 01:17:27,560
and he doesn't realize it's insane.

1501
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:30,280
Wow. I said, what is that voice?

1502
01:17:30,280 --> 01:17:31,360
It's driving me crazy.

1503
01:17:31,360 --> 01:17:34,760
Also, I'm staring at the thumbnail of this and he, you know, it's

1504
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:38,440
it's the cool chain link fence aesthetic in the warehouse.

1505
01:17:38,440 --> 01:17:41,120
And so it's just signs around.

1506
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:44,240
And one of the signs says, thank you for not littering.

1507
01:17:45,680 --> 01:17:47,680
Cool. Hey, fam.

1508
01:17:47,720 --> 01:17:49,800
Don't litter. Family doesn't do that.

1509
01:17:49,800 --> 01:17:51,720
Family does not do that.

1510
01:17:51,720 --> 01:17:55,800
The opening of the Hollywood one had like a car doing a stunt,

1511
01:17:55,800 --> 01:18:00,800
like jumping through a, you know, a big sign.

1512
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:05,160
I also saw some B roll of like the Hollywood opening

1513
01:18:05,160 --> 01:18:08,680
where you got to see a real Hollywood experience

1514
01:18:09,040 --> 01:18:12,920
of like a famous person being escorted away

1515
01:18:12,920 --> 01:18:16,600
by like a well-dressed handler saying, thanks, guys,

1516
01:18:16,920 --> 01:18:17,920
to the assembled.

1517
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:22,520
And if you've ever been to a premiere or a real Hollywood event,

1518
01:18:22,520 --> 01:18:26,680
you've seen a famous person being surrounded by a reasonably nicely

1519
01:18:26,680 --> 01:18:29,040
dressed minder going, thanks, guys.

1520
01:18:29,040 --> 01:18:31,600
That's we're out of time. We got to go.

1521
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:32,680
Yes.

1522
01:18:32,680 --> 01:18:36,680
Folks are getting you away from like some red carpet got like,

1523
01:18:36,680 --> 01:18:38,600
what's up? I'm movie junkie.

1524
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:43,400
So you have 45 seconds. Wrap it up.

1525
01:18:43,400 --> 01:18:45,200
All right. All right. Movie.

1526
01:18:45,200 --> 01:18:47,120
Come on. Stop it now.

1527
01:18:47,120 --> 01:18:49,520
That's it. All right. You said, um, the entire time.

1528
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:50,920
You were just nervous to meet him.

1529
01:18:50,920 --> 01:18:52,840
You said nothing in the first seconds.

1530
01:18:52,840 --> 01:18:55,560
Sign the first 10 by 10s. We're not going to do another 10.

1531
01:18:55,640 --> 01:18:57,720
OK, let's keep moving along.

1532
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,440
Thanks, guys. Thanks.

1533
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:03,000
Thanks, guys. Thanks, guys.

1534
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:06,800
Thanks, guys. I feel like it applies to a lot of different Hollywood jobs.

1535
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:09,320
Yeah. Thanks, guys. Thanks, guys.

1536
01:19:09,320 --> 01:19:11,480
Thanks, guys. It was fun. Switch it up, agents.

1537
01:19:11,480 --> 01:19:12,840
Thanks, folks. We're not.

1538
01:19:12,840 --> 01:19:14,360
We're cutting back on guys.

1539
01:19:14,360 --> 01:19:15,400
Come on.

1540
01:19:15,400 --> 01:19:17,800
I'm trying to think when we were at the Jurassic Jurassic

1541
01:19:17,800 --> 01:19:21,560
World premiere for the ride, did we hear any thanks, guys?

1542
01:19:22,440 --> 01:19:24,880
We would have if we tried to talk to anyone.

1543
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:27,080
Yeah, I guess you're right. We didn't talk to anybody.

1544
01:19:27,080 --> 01:19:29,360
Maybe when we tried to have too many drinks,

1545
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:31,880
they should have somebody was like, hey, thanks, guys.

1546
01:19:33,080 --> 01:19:36,480
We when I think when we tried to go upstairs, they're like, sorry, guys.

1547
01:19:36,720 --> 01:19:39,160
Wrong land. Sorry. You got to say you got to eat down here.

1548
01:19:39,160 --> 01:19:41,360
Oh, that's right. There is a VIP. Yeah. Yeah.

1549
01:19:41,560 --> 01:19:44,000
Well, I like this ride. We're all VIPs.

1550
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:45,760
Right. We're sorry. Yeah.

1551
01:19:45,760 --> 01:19:47,680
I think we hear sorry, guys, a lot more.

1552
01:19:48,440 --> 01:19:50,440
Thank you. Sorry.

1553
01:19:50,440 --> 01:19:52,880
Sorry. Nothing to be thankful for.

1554
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:54,680
So what's your podcast about?

1555
01:19:54,680 --> 01:19:56,240
Well, it's about the.

1556
01:19:56,240 --> 01:19:58,120
Sorry, guys.

1557
01:19:58,120 --> 01:20:00,440
You three are not family. You're trash.

1558
01:20:00,440 --> 01:20:02,320
Get the hell out.

1559
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:04,720
Sorry, guys. Sorry, guys.

1560
01:20:04,720 --> 01:20:06,680
Sorry, guys.

1561
01:20:06,680 --> 01:20:09,520
Well, we're going to try to get more thank yous this year than sorrys.

1562
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:11,480
Right. We're going to.

1563
01:20:12,120 --> 01:20:15,880
I there's another thing about Jason, about when the when Ludacris

1564
01:20:16,680 --> 01:20:19,920
calls in that he because then in the ride.

1565
01:20:20,120 --> 01:20:22,480
OK, so maybe something we haven't said is that,

1566
01:20:23,120 --> 01:20:26,600
you know, the tram tour, there's monitors on the trams for all

1567
01:20:26,600 --> 01:20:28,440
of the myriad of other things you do on the tram.

1568
01:20:28,440 --> 01:20:32,800
So they have to play clips of the characters like they do some expositional stuff.

1569
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:36,440
And then when the ride's over, they cut to, you know, Vin and the rock.

1570
01:20:36,440 --> 01:20:38,800
And they all say, hey, thanks for being part of our crew.

1571
01:20:39,080 --> 01:20:41,800
So that same thing happens on the party bus.

1572
01:20:42,080 --> 01:20:47,880
But so it's a mix of stuff that they shot for the tour one where.

1573
01:20:47,880 --> 01:20:51,920
Yes. Like, OK, so it's shifts between when the ride's over

1574
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:54,120
and the Buster Rhymes song is playing.

1575
01:20:54,440 --> 01:20:58,720
Then you get Ludacris, who is being filmed on a pre-zoom,

1576
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:02,400
you know, there's like scan lines and either an interface.

1577
01:21:02,640 --> 01:21:06,680
But then you've got, you know, Vin and Tyrese and the rock

1578
01:21:06,680 --> 01:21:09,640
all leaning up against like a are they just in a golf cart?

1579
01:21:09,640 --> 01:21:11,600
What are they just like on a studio lot?

1580
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:14,000
It's just like junket style.

1581
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,600
Yeah. That was filming out on the back lot. Yeah.

1582
01:21:16,720 --> 01:21:18,840
They have a tripod.

1583
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:23,400
All right. So Hobbs is talking to you with like a junket crew he brought.

1584
01:21:23,680 --> 01:21:27,960
But Ludacris is talking to you via like a secret

1585
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:31,560
pirate radio, pirate video channel.

1586
01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:34,400
He's the computer guy and the crew. He's the computer guy.

1587
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:35,800
That's how they communicate it.

1588
01:21:35,800 --> 01:21:38,800
He hacks. Yeah. I see. Yeah.

1589
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:42,920
Is there a making of to know exactly who was in the room,

1590
01:21:42,920 --> 01:21:46,280
where even in the pre-show and this and like when it was shot

1591
01:21:46,280 --> 01:21:50,680
and was this shot a year later or was it all shot when Hollywood happened?

1592
01:21:50,680 --> 01:21:54,600
Or I'm always I'm always curious about that type of thing.

1593
01:21:54,720 --> 01:21:59,200
It apparently was Orlando and Hollywood were working on it together.

1594
01:21:59,200 --> 01:22:02,280
Like it was simultaneously being worked on.

1595
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:07,560
Did anyone see there was somebody had pointed out that the rock,

1596
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:11,200
the rock endorsed Biden and Kamala Harris, which

1597
01:22:12,160 --> 01:22:14,960
I think is his first political thing he's done since showing up at like

1598
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:17,320
the Republican National Convention in 2000.

1599
01:22:17,560 --> 01:22:19,320
Oh, boy, really?

1600
01:22:20,440 --> 01:22:21,720
But whatever. OK, all right.

1601
01:22:21,720 --> 01:22:25,200
He's but he endorsed Biden and Harris.

1602
01:22:25,560 --> 01:22:28,560
And then somebody pointed out, hey, did you notice he's wearing

1603
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:32,240
the exact same shirt in the exact same spot as when he inducted

1604
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:36,000
pro wrestler Ken Shamrock into the Impact Hall of Fame?

1605
01:22:36,760 --> 01:22:40,040
So he was he was getting like he was getting a bunch of videos

1606
01:22:40,040 --> 01:22:42,440
done at the same point.

1607
01:22:42,720 --> 01:22:46,440
And he did he did them like run after the other, I assume,

1608
01:22:46,440 --> 01:22:48,600
because same shirt, same location.

1609
01:22:48,880 --> 01:22:52,360
And he endorsed the president elect Joe Biden.

1610
01:22:52,360 --> 01:22:54,120
And then he also said that Mr.

1611
01:22:54,120 --> 01:22:56,600
Ken Shamrock was worthy of his Hall of Fame induction.

1612
01:22:58,400 --> 01:23:00,400
What's this one for?

1613
01:23:00,400 --> 01:23:03,920
Biden Harris Shamrock, Terra Mata, bang, bang, bang, bang.

1614
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:05,240
Yeah, it knocks them all out.

1615
01:23:05,240 --> 01:23:08,080
So I wonder if like one of these things was like rock just had to knock

1616
01:23:08,760 --> 01:23:13,840
this out, like a I got to knock out a pre show thing for for Universal.

1617
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:15,960
Then he does some sort of political thing.

1618
01:23:15,960 --> 01:23:20,880
Then he does cuts a promo on, you know, Roman Reigns or something.

1619
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:22,000
I mean, to some extent.

1620
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:26,600
But of course, they did all have to like swing around on rods and sandbags.

1621
01:23:26,760 --> 01:23:29,200
That's one thing as for as much as you make fun of

1622
01:23:29,520 --> 01:23:33,480
how Vin Diesel looks on the digital helicopter where he grows 70 feet.

1623
01:23:33,640 --> 01:23:38,560
When you see him do the stunt in a green screen void, it's really impressive.

1624
01:23:38,920 --> 01:23:39,680
Like this is true.

1625
01:23:39,680 --> 01:23:41,040
This is a real stunt man.

1626
01:23:41,040 --> 01:23:44,120
He's done and Vin Diesel's doing it.

1627
01:23:44,120 --> 01:23:46,640
Like, why is the behind the scenes look so much better?

1628
01:23:46,880 --> 01:23:50,760
Because there's no bizarre, like spatial shift going on.

1629
01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:52,200
And I can see it.

1630
01:23:52,200 --> 01:23:54,040
I mean, it's not like it's not blurry.

1631
01:23:54,040 --> 01:23:56,080
And I'm not like peering over somebody's head.

1632
01:23:56,240 --> 01:23:59,000
Watch the behind the scenes, the behind the scenes is better than the ride.

1633
01:23:59,040 --> 01:24:00,160
It's cool. Yeah.

1634
01:24:00,160 --> 01:24:03,480
And I think in the movies, too, like they certainly use CGI.

1635
01:24:03,480 --> 01:24:06,560
I mean, the 2000s one, it's very funny when they show like

1636
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:10,840
the sequence of like the night hit the nitrate and they go through the engine.

1637
01:24:11,080 --> 01:24:13,400
It's perfect. The logo in the original one

1638
01:24:14,360 --> 01:24:16,120
at the very time is amazed.

1639
01:24:16,120 --> 01:24:18,480
Like you can just see the evolution of filmmaking.

1640
01:24:18,680 --> 01:24:23,520
I think the second one is actually pretty bad with rough CGI.

1641
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:26,600
But I feel like Tokyo Drift is mostly practical stuff.

1642
01:24:26,920 --> 01:24:29,200
And there are a lot of practical stunts in this movie.

1643
01:24:29,200 --> 01:24:32,720
That's why the CGI-ness is so odd.

1644
01:24:33,120 --> 01:24:34,160
Yeah. Yeah.

1645
01:24:34,160 --> 01:24:38,480
Which this like I've got a kind of a bigger point here about the weird

1646
01:24:38,480 --> 01:24:42,480
like what what makes this not work and why this is like, you know,

1647
01:24:43,040 --> 01:24:47,240
it's certainly in the running for worst screen ride.

1648
01:24:47,440 --> 01:24:50,360
And for as much as we went on and on about the Fallon ride,

1649
01:24:50,360 --> 01:24:54,720
that almost felt like more in its construction than in the in the premise

1650
01:24:54,720 --> 01:24:57,520
and then in the like technical side of it.

1651
01:24:57,520 --> 01:25:02,120
And I think the technical side is just rough on this on this ride.

1652
01:25:02,120 --> 01:25:06,240
Yeah. And I was just thinking about how, OK, so it does pay off.

1653
01:25:06,240 --> 01:25:09,880
Here's all your favorite characters and you're going on an adventure with them.

1654
01:25:10,080 --> 01:25:16,520
But in the Back to the Future ride, you aren't following Marty and Doc.

1655
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:21,600
It's not about Marty on a hoverboard and you're following him.

1656
01:25:21,800 --> 01:25:25,120
And Star Tours is not about like

1657
01:25:25,480 --> 01:25:31,560
chasing a flying Darth Vader around like more of them show up in the characters

1658
01:25:31,560 --> 01:25:34,160
show up a little bit in the adventures continued in the new one.

1659
01:25:34,320 --> 01:25:38,560
But like when the characters show up as holograms mainly or in Back to the Future,

1660
01:25:38,560 --> 01:25:41,000
they're on little screens in which they do that.

1661
01:25:41,120 --> 01:25:43,520
Conceit on this thing.

1662
01:25:43,520 --> 01:25:48,120
Like that's I don't know, like when you're trying to fit your characters

1663
01:25:48,120 --> 01:25:50,760
into things, it's been done so much more successfully as

1664
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:52,320
here's a little console camera.

1665
01:25:52,320 --> 01:25:56,040
They're popping up on the second monitor in some sideways

1666
01:25:56,880 --> 01:26:01,280
rather than like here is VIN and the rest of it has to be digital.

1667
01:26:01,280 --> 01:26:04,160
So it has to be a real digital looking VIN.

1668
01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:07,160
I think that's sort of the problem.

1669
01:26:07,160 --> 01:26:09,080
And you can tell why.

1670
01:26:09,080 --> 01:26:13,120
I think there was some pre version of Back to the Future where it was like

1671
01:26:13,120 --> 01:26:18,720
Doc's in a flying machine, like some big umbrella like old timey

1672
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:20,480
pre Wright Brothers machine.

1673
01:26:20,480 --> 01:26:22,920
And I think it looked really silly and they bailed on it.

1674
01:26:22,920 --> 01:26:24,920
And you're just doing a DeLorean.

1675
01:26:24,920 --> 01:26:27,280
And I think Fast and Furious shows you why.

1676
01:26:28,080 --> 01:26:32,760
Yeah, it's I was I think it only works with the characters

1677
01:26:32,760 --> 01:26:37,360
in like a type of ride like this on the Simpsons, because they're already cartoons.

1678
01:26:37,720 --> 01:26:41,480
Yes. Yeah. Like that's the only because other than that, if you're going,

1679
01:26:41,480 --> 01:26:43,760
if you're on some sort of ride that's supposed to be very fast

1680
01:26:43,880 --> 01:26:47,200
or obviously Transformers because they're giants and it's totally a different

1681
01:26:47,320 --> 01:26:49,200
like type of screen ride.

1682
01:26:49,200 --> 01:26:52,280
But yeah, like if it's humans, it's like you're not really getting much

1683
01:26:52,840 --> 01:26:57,280
whizzing by tiny versions of the characters you like.

1684
01:26:57,680 --> 01:27:00,800
That's what when I was trying to when Aaron was trying to remember

1685
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:02,800
if she'd been on this or not, she was like, is that the one

1686
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:05,680
where you go by all the tiny people?

1687
01:27:05,680 --> 01:27:07,280
That's how it existed in her brain.

1688
01:27:07,280 --> 01:27:11,120
And I don't blame her when you think about King Kong, which we're not huge fans of,

1689
01:27:11,120 --> 01:27:13,000
but we all agree it works better.

1690
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,960
You've got weird scale issues like you're saying with Optimus

1691
01:27:16,120 --> 01:27:20,480
like if the scale ever looks weird, it's because you're looking at fantastic

1692
01:27:20,480 --> 01:27:23,440
beings and you don't know how tall they're supposed to look.

1693
01:27:23,640 --> 01:27:27,760
But I do know that the that Vin Diesel is

1694
01:27:28,360 --> 01:27:30,560
is he short? Maybe he's short.

1695
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:33,640
I know that Vin Diesel is somewhere between five and seven feet.

1696
01:27:33,880 --> 01:27:37,560
So when suddenly he is 70, I know that that's not right.

1697
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:40,200
Yeah. Yeah, it's yeah.

1698
01:27:40,200 --> 01:27:43,160
It just doesn't. I mean, I there's probably like

1699
01:27:43,400 --> 01:27:46,000
using the Spider-Man Transformers system.

1700
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:50,560
There's a version where you like the humans look better

1701
01:27:50,560 --> 01:27:53,960
because like Spider-Man is obviously the proportions are crazy,

1702
01:27:54,200 --> 01:27:57,720
but it's all pretty consistent feeling, whether it is or not.

1703
01:27:57,720 --> 01:27:59,480
It just feels consistent.

1704
01:27:59,480 --> 01:28:02,920
In my mind, the characters are all big, but like your brain

1705
01:28:03,080 --> 01:28:06,600
automatically gets used to like, OK, all the human characters are this big.

1706
01:28:06,720 --> 01:28:08,640
And it's something you don't even really think about.

1707
01:28:08,640 --> 01:28:10,000
Like he jumps on the hood.

1708
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,640
My memory is like now that I'm thinking about it is like

1709
01:28:12,920 --> 01:28:16,880
Spider-Man is seven feet tall and like seven feet wide.

1710
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,120
But it doesn't it doesn't.

1711
01:28:19,120 --> 01:28:20,720
It's not something you're thinking about because I think

1712
01:28:20,720 --> 01:28:24,400
because the scale stays pretty similar the whole time.

1713
01:28:24,600 --> 01:28:25,480
Yeah. Yeah.

1714
01:28:25,480 --> 01:28:29,400
But yeah, you that's that you get face to face with the characters,

1715
01:28:29,400 --> 01:28:32,080
which is, of course, what I like with Transformers and stuff is you get

1716
01:28:32,080 --> 01:28:36,000
little personal moments and then you get action adventure things here.

1717
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,840
It's just like you're trying to figure out what's going on.

1718
01:28:39,320 --> 01:28:43,440
If Dom were to like grab the rungs of the tram tour

1719
01:28:43,440 --> 01:28:47,360
or of the ride vehicle and like lean into the car and like be like, hey, you.

1720
01:28:47,880 --> 01:28:49,920
And then he points and he's like, you're my family.

1721
01:28:50,360 --> 01:28:52,040
Then he goes and does it.

1722
01:28:52,040 --> 01:28:55,360
That's a little bit more what what I think people would want.

1723
01:28:55,360 --> 01:28:58,320
They get a little more face time with Vin, with Dom.

1724
01:28:58,360 --> 01:29:00,680
Grabbed the sides of the tram

1725
01:29:01,040 --> 01:29:04,040
and rattled them and screamed in your face,

1726
01:29:04,200 --> 01:29:07,480
who wants to be part of the fancy family?

1727
01:29:07,960 --> 01:29:09,640
Yeah, that exactly.

1728
01:29:09,640 --> 01:29:12,080
I think then you're at least you

1729
01:29:12,080 --> 01:29:14,800
you can't see the action if it's a little blurry.

1730
01:29:14,920 --> 01:29:15,480
You at least go.

1731
01:29:15,480 --> 01:29:20,200
Well, it was fun when he rattled our rattled the vehicle.

1732
01:29:21,240 --> 01:29:26,400
I have one more thing from Florida that I I went back into my notes

1733
01:29:26,400 --> 01:29:30,680
from over a year ago because I was like, wait, there was something in the line

1734
01:29:30,680 --> 01:29:33,280
that struck me as like, oh, that's not great.

1735
01:29:34,240 --> 01:29:38,560
And it's right before you get to the room where you get on the party bus.

1736
01:29:38,840 --> 01:29:43,120
Inevitably, there is like a, you know, a curvy ramp up

1737
01:29:43,840 --> 01:29:45,000
to get to the room.

1738
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:46,360
And it's kind of unadorned.

1739
01:29:46,360 --> 01:29:48,360
Maybe there's one or two colored lights.

1740
01:29:48,360 --> 01:29:50,200
But they were blasting a song.

1741
01:29:50,200 --> 01:29:52,320
And I was like, what is that song?

1742
01:29:52,320 --> 01:29:54,080
What I cannot place it.

1743
01:29:54,080 --> 01:29:58,640
And then I immediately knew what it was because they said the name

1744
01:29:58,640 --> 01:30:00,440
and it went turned down for what?

1745
01:30:00,440 --> 01:30:02,480
Then I know that.

1746
01:30:02,480 --> 01:30:04,080
And I was like, oh, my God.

1747
01:30:04,080 --> 01:30:05,800
Like, and that's kind of a thing.

1748
01:30:05,800 --> 01:30:08,760
You know, I went back and looked at some of the soundtracks for these movies.

1749
01:30:08,760 --> 01:30:11,720
And there's some forgotten songs on there.

1750
01:30:11,720 --> 01:30:15,000
But I was just like, this is how you're building up people getting psyched.

1751
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:19,640
Like a 2009 song on this like giant expensive ride.

1752
01:30:19,640 --> 01:30:20,880
It's turned out for what?

1753
01:30:20,880 --> 01:30:24,240
In an empty hallway like that's kind of grim.

1754
01:30:24,600 --> 01:30:27,560
You're more of a we know you don't like turned down for what,

1755
01:30:27,560 --> 01:30:29,360
but you love Opa Gangnam style.

1756
01:30:29,360 --> 01:30:31,520
Still. Well, I do like that.

1757
01:30:31,520 --> 01:30:32,480
And the Harlem Shake.

1758
01:30:32,480 --> 01:30:35,440
I wish they had done the Harlem Shake because then we well would have just flopped

1759
01:30:35,720 --> 01:30:38,080
around in the hallway.

1760
01:30:39,080 --> 01:30:42,920
I like to turn down for what belongs in the category of those songs, I feel.

1761
01:30:43,240 --> 01:30:47,320
Yeah, I think it's I thought it was just like I had not thought about

1762
01:30:47,560 --> 01:30:49,080
turned out for what in a while.

1763
01:30:49,080 --> 01:30:51,440
And it was kind of a big,

1764
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:56,280
a big like right before you get on the ride moment.

1765
01:30:56,520 --> 01:31:00,000
But I'm done a it's been a couple of days now.

1766
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:03,240
Has anybody done like using the C-SPAN cameras,

1767
01:31:03,240 --> 01:31:06,400
like the stationary cameras in the in the Congress building?

1768
01:31:06,640 --> 01:31:11,560
Has anybody done the Harlem Shake where it's the footage of just the senators

1769
01:31:11,560 --> 01:31:14,680
like about to vote and then there's the jump cut and there's a bunch of people

1770
01:31:14,680 --> 01:31:18,040
in fur coats vaping.

1771
01:31:18,040 --> 01:31:21,520
Like you do the jump cut to the post invasion.

1772
01:31:23,360 --> 01:31:25,720
Has anyone done that?

1773
01:31:25,720 --> 01:31:27,760
No, no. Maybe it's happened.

1774
01:31:27,760 --> 01:31:28,640
That might be.

1775
01:31:28,640 --> 01:31:29,760
It's a future for us.

1776
01:31:30,040 --> 01:31:32,480
This might be storming Twitter as we speak.

1777
01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:33,800
It's very possible.

1778
01:31:33,800 --> 01:31:34,960
So we'll see.

1779
01:31:36,280 --> 01:31:36,800
We'll see.

1780
01:31:36,800 --> 01:31:37,760
Someone's everything.

1781
01:31:37,760 --> 01:31:39,800
It's trying to get it.

1782
01:31:39,800 --> 01:31:42,120
Someone's trying to get an invite to a tick tock house.

1783
01:31:46,640 --> 01:31:48,120
The trip.

1784
01:31:48,120 --> 01:31:50,800
Were those the tip tick tick tock house?

1785
01:31:50,840 --> 01:31:52,560
Were they having the parties on New Year's?

1786
01:31:52,560 --> 01:31:54,800
Yeah, drip crib and hype house.

1787
01:31:54,800 --> 01:31:56,840
And I drove. I love really sad.

1788
01:31:56,840 --> 01:31:59,880
I heard about drip crib and I'm very excited about drip crib.

1789
01:31:59,880 --> 01:32:03,640
I don't like what they were up to, but I like the concept of the drip crib.

1790
01:32:04,160 --> 01:32:08,000
Sure. But anyway, could you could could we rename the you know,

1791
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:11,280
because everybody you guys like varying degrees of little splashiness

1792
01:32:11,280 --> 01:32:13,240
in the in the splash mountain logs.

1793
01:32:13,240 --> 01:32:17,440
Could you do you want to think of those instead as drip cribs?

1794
01:32:18,320 --> 01:32:20,600
They're not logs, they're drip cribs.

1795
01:32:20,600 --> 01:32:22,040
I like the idea of that.

1796
01:32:22,040 --> 01:32:24,760
Yeah, I think that, you know, you could certainly.

1797
01:32:24,840 --> 01:32:26,800
OK, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1798
01:32:26,880 --> 01:32:31,440
The real hack at Disneyland or Disney World is you go on splash

1799
01:32:31,440 --> 01:32:34,760
mountain alone, you see if you can get the log alone somehow.

1800
01:32:34,960 --> 01:32:37,760
And then you lie down like a baby.

1801
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:40,280
In the log, it's going to be hard because of the seats,

1802
01:32:40,400 --> 01:32:43,360
but it'll be like you can kind of lie on the side on the Disneyland one

1803
01:32:43,360 --> 01:32:46,920
because the seats are sort of in the middle and you lie down on it

1804
01:32:47,080 --> 01:32:49,320
and then you get the splashes all over your body.

1805
01:32:49,400 --> 01:32:50,840
And that's called a drip crib.

1806
01:32:50,840 --> 01:32:51,880
That's a drip crib.

1807
01:32:51,880 --> 01:32:55,960
If you yeah, if you duck under the whole thing, do the entire thing

1808
01:32:56,200 --> 01:32:58,320
curled in a fetal position.

1809
01:32:58,320 --> 01:33:00,800
Yes, exactly. And you bring your little blankie.

1810
01:33:01,880 --> 01:33:04,040
And then it gets soaked.

1811
01:33:05,080 --> 01:33:07,120
So, yeah, Jason, I mean, Jason will love that.

1812
01:33:07,120 --> 01:33:10,240
I'm not a huge fan of getting soaked, but Jason

1813
01:33:10,800 --> 01:33:14,080
loves all aspects of his body getting soaked on a rise.

1814
01:33:14,440 --> 01:33:15,600
Sleep like a baby.

1815
01:33:15,600 --> 01:33:19,200
Look, if you if you toss water on me when I'm sleeping, I'm going on.

1816
01:33:19,520 --> 01:33:21,400
That's how you activate the deep rim.

1817
01:33:21,400 --> 01:33:23,520
That's how you dream and start

1818
01:33:24,200 --> 01:33:25,840
the right.

1819
01:33:25,840 --> 01:33:28,360
Yeah, the ram gets activated when Jason gets soaked.

1820
01:33:29,200 --> 01:33:30,640
Yeah, nice.

1821
01:33:30,640 --> 01:33:32,760
So key sleep.

1822
01:33:32,760 --> 01:33:35,600
Oh, what a nice wet sleep Jason.

1823
01:33:35,920 --> 01:33:37,120
Turn him over, turn him over.

1824
01:33:37,120 --> 01:33:39,440
He's going to drown again. Turn him over.

1825
01:33:41,200 --> 01:33:43,520
He's having a nightmare about stiff brownies.

1826
01:33:43,520 --> 01:33:48,840
Stiff. No, I wish I would put some more water in that brownie better.

1827
01:33:48,840 --> 01:33:53,160
No, they need a stiff brownie needs a trip to the drip crib.

1828
01:33:53,760 --> 01:33:54,560
Yeah.

1829
01:33:56,640 --> 01:34:00,480
We should also mention this ride was closed from August 8th to November

1830
01:34:00,480 --> 01:34:05,440
21st, 2020, when Universal scaled back operations due to low crowds.

1831
01:34:06,560 --> 01:34:08,720
From this was their roto virus.

1832
01:34:08,920 --> 01:34:11,040
This was their Stitch's great escape.

1833
01:34:11,040 --> 01:34:13,120
This is the one where we don't have to bother to run.

1834
01:34:13,680 --> 01:34:15,680
They did this Barney

1835
01:34:17,920 --> 01:34:19,760
Poseidon's Fury.

1836
01:34:19,760 --> 01:34:22,160
Oh, and I think there was a fourth.

1837
01:34:23,160 --> 01:34:24,000
Hmm.

1838
01:34:24,800 --> 01:34:25,760
Wow. Geez.

1839
01:34:25,760 --> 01:34:27,480
So this is already on their shit list.

1840
01:34:27,480 --> 01:34:31,400
And like we said, it seems like this has to have been.

1841
01:34:31,640 --> 01:34:35,720
This was the point where, you know, I think theme park nerds were saying

1842
01:34:35,720 --> 01:34:37,560
five years before this too many screens.

1843
01:34:37,560 --> 01:34:41,400
This was the point, I think, where more casual people were starting to say,

1844
01:34:41,400 --> 01:34:45,400
all right, it actually was what some of them were starting to say was my eyes hurt.

1845
01:34:45,800 --> 01:34:48,280
I can't go on any more of these screen rights.

1846
01:34:49,160 --> 01:34:53,560
And now we're getting Nintendo, which is not that there's.

1847
01:34:53,560 --> 01:34:55,640
Yeah, there's elements, but yeah, no, there's practical stuff.

1848
01:34:55,920 --> 01:34:57,840
It is funny the difference between that.

1849
01:34:58,320 --> 01:35:01,800
The two different ways you would say it, depending on what kind of person you are,

1850
01:35:01,800 --> 01:35:05,880
that mean the same thing to a universal employee, which is we come up to universal

1851
01:35:05,880 --> 01:35:11,040
and play and go, have you noticed that the same screen tricks are being utilized

1852
01:35:11,040 --> 01:35:14,960
in Jimmy Fallon's Simpsons, Minion Mayhem?

1853
01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:18,840
And then the other person is going like, yeah, it's blurry.

1854
01:35:19,240 --> 01:35:21,800
It's blurry. I didn't like it.

1855
01:35:21,800 --> 01:35:23,600
And that really conveys the same thing.

1856
01:35:23,600 --> 01:35:24,320
It's the same thing.

1857
01:35:24,320 --> 01:35:25,320
They both land out.

1858
01:35:25,320 --> 01:35:28,040
They both landed the same conclusion of like, we fucked up with this

1859
01:35:28,040 --> 01:35:30,160
Fest in the Furious Ride. Yeah. Yeah.

1860
01:35:30,640 --> 01:35:33,240
Well, the point is the chorus grew.

1861
01:35:33,240 --> 01:35:38,680
I think maybe you needed it to get this bad for things to change.

1862
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:43,520
Yeah. But I got a cute picture with Wax Vid Diesel

1863
01:35:43,520 --> 01:35:47,680
that you can really put your hands on in that gift shop.

1864
01:35:48,120 --> 01:35:50,600
They encourage you to touch the Wax Vid Diesel. Yes.

1865
01:35:50,920 --> 01:35:54,840
Yeah. And and and also I encourage strangers like, hey, man, hey,

1866
01:35:54,840 --> 01:35:57,040
could you could you hold my phone? Could you take a picture?

1867
01:35:59,120 --> 01:36:01,720
My friends have all fled the state,

1868
01:36:02,600 --> 01:36:05,920
but I need he told me I was part of his family.

1869
01:36:05,960 --> 01:36:07,760
And I really want a picture to remember that.

1870
01:36:07,760 --> 01:36:10,720
So I want to commemorate this sweet moment. Yeah.

1871
01:36:10,720 --> 01:36:13,600
Um, you need pictures with your family.

1872
01:36:14,400 --> 01:36:15,920
Yeah. Yeah.

1873
01:36:15,920 --> 01:36:18,360
I realize also the family, do they?

1874
01:36:18,360 --> 01:36:21,440
It's like very like an Olive Garden thing with the family.

1875
01:36:21,440 --> 01:36:23,520
When you hear your family is the whole Olive Garden.

1876
01:36:23,560 --> 01:36:24,800
Like they keep pushing that.

1877
01:36:24,800 --> 01:36:26,840
And it's the same thing with Fest in Furious.

1878
01:36:26,840 --> 01:36:29,200
When you hear your family,

1879
01:36:29,920 --> 01:36:33,480
has he done an Olive Garden commercial?

1880
01:36:33,480 --> 01:36:34,520
That's the one they're going to.

1881
01:36:34,520 --> 01:36:37,960
They can't be subtle about getting people back into these restaurants

1882
01:36:37,960 --> 01:36:39,160
when it's safe to do so.

1883
01:36:39,160 --> 01:36:40,960
They're going to have to yell about it.

1884
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:44,120
And who better to yell than Vin Diesel than Vin Diesel?

1885
01:36:44,240 --> 01:36:48,000
That that brings up a good point, because I was not certain.

1886
01:36:48,040 --> 01:36:52,480
Like the character Dominic Toretto, I Googled what ethnicity is Dominic

1887
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:56,360
Toretto because he's he's always talking about family.

1888
01:36:56,640 --> 01:36:58,400
He's always barbecuing forever.

1889
01:36:58,400 --> 01:37:02,400
He like the it's in L.A., but

1890
01:37:03,080 --> 01:37:04,760
and they're always drinking Carotas.

1891
01:37:04,760 --> 01:37:06,760
Dom always is giving people Carotas.

1892
01:37:06,760 --> 01:37:10,640
And I was just like, I have no way I am not.

1893
01:37:10,640 --> 01:37:15,080
And it seems like it wasn't until the there's a line in the Fate

1894
01:37:15,080 --> 01:37:18,280
of the Furious, the most recent one,

1895
01:37:18,280 --> 01:37:23,320
Dom says the Toretto's go back to Cuba like our family comes from Cuba.

1896
01:37:23,640 --> 01:37:26,200
And everyone was like, oh, OK.

1897
01:37:26,240 --> 01:37:29,360
Like, but does everyone in the movie go, oh, OK.

1898
01:37:30,560 --> 01:37:34,240
It seemed like on on message words, we were going like, oh, we thought it was

1899
01:37:34,480 --> 01:37:37,600
Dominican or Puerto Rican. OK.

1900
01:37:37,600 --> 01:37:40,920
The I also saw something that's a dominant Vin Diesel.

1901
01:37:41,320 --> 01:37:44,240
It's unsure of what ethnicity his father was.

1902
01:37:45,840 --> 01:37:48,120
It doesn't never knew his father didn't know his father.

1903
01:37:48,120 --> 01:37:51,160
Oh, man. I was hoping you were to say Olive Garden Italian.

1904
01:37:51,960 --> 01:37:55,200
You think I thought Italian at first, because I'm like, God damn,

1905
01:37:55,200 --> 01:37:58,120
this guy's talking about family a lot.

1906
01:37:59,680 --> 01:38:02,120
So he didn't he didn't know his family.

1907
01:38:02,520 --> 01:38:04,880
He didn't grow up with a full family.

1908
01:38:05,200 --> 01:38:07,000
He knew his mother. I mean, he knew his mother.

1909
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:11,600
But I think there it is in question some of the lineage.

1910
01:38:13,280 --> 01:38:17,240
Well, I want to post that you have obviously you have that view

1911
01:38:17,240 --> 01:38:20,960
and Vin wax figure framed at your desk, I assume, Jason.

1912
01:38:22,120 --> 01:38:24,040
Yeah. OK.

1913
01:38:24,040 --> 01:38:26,360
So, yeah, we'll post that. You'll get to see that.

1914
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:31,960
And that's the best thing that's that came out of this riot, I feel like.

1915
01:38:32,800 --> 01:38:36,520
Yeah, I think so, because it's the memories you keep.

1916
01:38:36,960 --> 01:38:38,080
And we got a koozie.

1917
01:38:38,080 --> 01:38:43,240
We got a koozie for our fan who went to the Chicago show and the Orlando show.

1918
01:38:43,240 --> 01:38:44,960
We gave him a koozie.

1919
01:38:44,960 --> 01:38:47,400
Oh, yeah. So that's good, too.

1920
01:38:47,760 --> 01:38:49,240
So those are the two things.

1921
01:38:49,240 --> 01:38:53,280
It inspired great koozies, who great koozie.

1922
01:38:53,920 --> 01:38:56,120
Look, we've heard a lot.

1923
01:38:56,120 --> 01:38:58,200
I don't know if Epic Universe is happening.

1924
01:38:58,200 --> 01:39:00,040
I think it probably isn't.

1925
01:39:00,040 --> 01:39:01,120
That would be my guess.

1926
01:39:01,120 --> 01:39:02,520
That's what I've heard.

1927
01:39:02,520 --> 01:39:03,960
But there's nothing official.

1928
01:39:03,960 --> 01:39:10,080
But I don't know why Fast and Furious wouldn't be on their plans to do it right.

1929
01:39:10,760 --> 01:39:14,720
Yeah. You know, like, oh, you build a rest.

1930
01:39:14,720 --> 01:39:18,320
You build like the Toretto house where they're always barbecuing.

1931
01:39:18,720 --> 01:39:21,040
And like, that's a restaurant.

1932
01:39:21,040 --> 01:39:22,560
Of course. Yeah.

1933
01:39:22,560 --> 01:39:26,640
A kind of fun backyard barbecue type restaurant like this could have.

1934
01:39:26,720 --> 01:39:29,400
Could easily slot into one of the epic universe,

1935
01:39:29,560 --> 01:39:33,120
which is, if you don't know, the third universal park that they were going to

1936
01:39:33,120 --> 01:39:34,280
build before the pandemic.

1937
01:39:35,200 --> 01:39:41,360
And but get rid of you could get rid of be fantastic beasts or how to train your

1938
01:39:41,360 --> 01:39:47,520
dragon land, put in a Fast and Furious land, do the barbecue restaurant, do that

1939
01:39:47,520 --> 01:39:53,560
Cars Land big expansive ride where like a robot Vin Diesel comes up to your car

1940
01:39:53,560 --> 01:39:57,160
and says something nice, which is nice to you.

1941
01:39:57,160 --> 01:39:58,760
And then you go on a little race.

1942
01:39:59,240 --> 01:40:01,200
And then you can put on, I don't know, another.

1943
01:40:01,680 --> 01:40:05,760
There's got to be a different maybe a Hobbs and Shaw spin off ride of some kind.

1944
01:40:06,200 --> 01:40:11,320
You know, I think these movies are too popular not to to do something else.

1945
01:40:12,360 --> 01:40:15,880
That's my it's well, it's a little it'd be cheaper for them.

1946
01:40:15,880 --> 01:40:18,760
They just got to buy like a mile of chain link fence.

1947
01:40:20,640 --> 01:40:23,840
That, I guess, is the aesthetic.

1948
01:40:23,840 --> 01:40:26,520
So, yeah, whatever.

1949
01:40:26,640 --> 01:40:30,120
Look, they got nothing's happening for a while, so I guess nothing's going to get

1950
01:40:30,120 --> 01:40:31,560
built, so nothing's happening.

1951
01:40:31,560 --> 01:40:34,760
It's not too big of a problem, but can't have too much.

1952
01:40:35,080 --> 01:40:36,680
A little Hobbs and Shaw goes a long way.

1953
01:40:36,680 --> 01:40:41,040
That movie made half as much as the Fast and Furious one did.

1954
01:40:41,080 --> 01:40:42,440
Really? That was less.

1955
01:40:42,440 --> 01:40:43,640
Well, that was less family.

1956
01:40:43,640 --> 01:40:45,440
It was like hanging out with your two uncles.

1957
01:40:45,440 --> 01:40:47,800
They didn't have the whole family.

1958
01:40:47,800 --> 01:40:51,880
But because Johnson and Diesel don't get along, so they're right.

1959
01:40:52,800 --> 01:40:55,640
They're replacing Johnson with Cedar.

1960
01:40:56,840 --> 01:41:00,800
As Dom's younger brother, Jacob, that was revealed in the trail.

1961
01:41:00,840 --> 01:41:03,640
A lot of stuff revealed in the Fast 9 trailer.

1962
01:41:03,880 --> 01:41:05,160
A lot of cool reveals.

1963
01:41:05,160 --> 01:41:05,560
So.

1964
01:41:06,760 --> 01:41:07,760
Maybe they made half.

1965
01:41:07,760 --> 01:41:09,800
It still made 700 million dollars.

1966
01:41:09,800 --> 01:41:13,920
Yeah, like 750 as opposed to one point five point five billion.

1967
01:41:13,920 --> 01:41:16,240
Right. Yeah. Just wanted to make sure.

1968
01:41:16,240 --> 01:41:20,920
Well, either way, maybe even more exciting than this ride or in a new land.

1969
01:41:21,240 --> 01:41:25,360
I mean, maybe the real detraction would be some, you know,

1970
01:41:26,160 --> 01:41:29,480
ancestry experience somewhere you like you.

1971
01:41:29,480 --> 01:41:35,040
You give you really do give a blood sample to somebody in the warehouse.

1972
01:41:35,320 --> 01:41:38,840
And then you get and then you wait around for 10 minutes for results,

1973
01:41:38,840 --> 01:41:39,800
kind of nervously.

1974
01:41:39,800 --> 01:41:42,360
And then it comes back and like, well, it came back.

1975
01:41:42,360 --> 01:41:44,920
Guess what? Your family.

1976
01:41:46,480 --> 01:41:48,440
Oh, every time it comes back that way.

1977
01:41:48,440 --> 01:41:50,920
Yes, no matter what, they still like run you through the motions.

1978
01:41:50,920 --> 01:41:54,440
And maybe they kind of like they come out like whoever walks out,

1979
01:41:54,440 --> 01:41:58,920
just like, I don't know, not looking good.

1980
01:42:00,040 --> 01:42:04,360
You start to ask like, so Jordana Brewster and Vin Diesel, our brother and sister.

1981
01:42:04,400 --> 01:42:06,160
Like, I don't I can't.

1982
01:42:06,160 --> 01:42:08,760
They don't look super like a family.

1983
01:42:08,800 --> 01:42:11,200
Don't worry about it. It's family.

1984
01:42:11,200 --> 01:42:11,880
Salute.

1985
01:42:11,880 --> 01:42:17,280
What what if it's like the exact same two pre show rooms on Avatar Flight of Passage?

1986
01:42:17,280 --> 01:42:22,480
And they're like scanning you to see if your family move around a little bit.

1987
01:42:22,480 --> 01:42:25,560
Move around.

1988
01:42:25,560 --> 01:42:27,600
All right. Your family.

1989
01:42:28,880 --> 01:42:32,320
Guess what? You're all family.

1990
01:42:34,120 --> 01:42:36,560
Rocket raccoon and then no right family.

1991
01:42:37,160 --> 01:42:40,200
Yeah, Rocket raccoon should tell us we're family and guardians.

1992
01:42:40,960 --> 01:42:44,880
Yeah, we love people say you live in France and you're proud of you.

1993
01:42:44,880 --> 01:42:48,480
I yeah. Well, we every ride should you should be told that you're part of the family.

1994
01:42:48,680 --> 01:42:51,880
Right. And then we our family should play on one of the right.

1995
01:42:51,880 --> 01:42:54,440
One of the ride sequences.

1996
01:42:54,440 --> 01:42:59,400
Beautiful. Well, we fixed not only this ride, but every ride, every ride.

1997
01:42:59,920 --> 01:43:02,600
And I, you know, this should be where I just end it

1998
01:43:03,400 --> 01:43:05,720
normally with the phrase that I say.

1999
01:43:05,720 --> 01:43:11,720
But I think I think in this case, we got to end it the way that the ride ends it.

2000
01:43:12,760 --> 01:43:16,120
And OK, so, guys, I guess with that.

2001
01:43:18,640 --> 01:43:21,160
You survived podcast the ride.

2002
01:43:21,400 --> 01:43:25,200
And let me tell you, you were lucky that you were riding with this crew

2003
01:43:25,480 --> 01:43:28,400
because the bigger the family, the stronger it is.

2004
01:43:28,880 --> 01:43:33,320
