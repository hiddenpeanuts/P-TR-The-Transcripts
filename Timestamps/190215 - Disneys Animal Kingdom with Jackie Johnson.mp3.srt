1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,400
Hey there, ForeverDog listeners, I'm Michael Wolff.

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:04,920
And I'm Colin O'Brien.

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:09,600
And we're the hosts of America's loudest podcast, LITERATI!

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:14,240
Sorry, sorry, we are recording in the library.

5
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,080
LITERATI is a podcast about books and the idiots who write them, featuring real readings

6
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,140
from some of your favorite authors.

7
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:23,440
And some of your favorite comedians pretending to be authors.

8
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,440
Mostly that one.

9
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:29,000
Plus, we dole out tons of amazing, unsolicited writing advice because we believe everyone

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,120
has at least one great novel in them.

11
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:35,640
Hey, just last week, I had to get a novel surgically removed from my small intestine.

12
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,680
I accidentally sat on my bookshelf and now I have three good novels inside me.

13
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,880
Very impressive.

14
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:45,560
New episodes of LITERATI are premiering on Monday, February 4th, and every Monday after

15
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,360
that until we die.

16
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,080
And that is contractual.

17
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:52,560
Stick around until after the show to hear a special sneak preview of our interview with

18
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:56,520
comedian Josh Sharp reading under his pseudonym, Clint Dimples.

19
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:01,480
And be sure to subscribe to LITERATI on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you get your

00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:02,480
podcasts.

21
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,080
And that's the end of that chapter.

22
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:07,080
Forever, dog.

23
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:16,400
Beware, on the following podcast adventure, you'll come face to face with pigs wearing

24
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:23,400
wigs, majestic Ringo stars, Dutch theme park acid trips, and condemnation of Mike's spending

25
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,520
habits.

26
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:29,280
Jackie Johnson joins us on a safari to Walt Disney World's Animal Kingdom.

27
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,200
Please don't feed the animals.

28
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,200
It's podcast the ride.

29
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:57,760
Welcome to Podcast the Ride, the theme park podcast hosted by three men whose podcast

30
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:01,440
mission to review every piece of Disneyland will not be complete until they figure out

31
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:05,560
to get made up at the Bibbidi Bobbidi Boutique.

32
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,280
My name is Mike Carlson.

33
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,360
I'll volunteer to do it if you guys don't want to.

34
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:16,160
But I'll ask my cohost, Jason Sheridan, would you get made up at the Bibbidi Bobbidi Boutique?

35
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,160
What would be stopping?

36
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:20,160
I think it's for little girls.

37
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,680
Yeah, but money has no age.

38
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:27,160
I think they would take your money.

39
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:30,480
I feel like adults probably have gone there.

40
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,040
Scott Gardner here.

41
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:35,080
Is Disney the most progressive place?

42
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,440
This I don't know.

43
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:41,840
There were issues with the same sex dancing in, but that was in the 80s.

44
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,640
Now there's Gay Day and that's fine.

45
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,640
But I don't know.

46
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,640
The makeup.

47
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:52,040
I think it's just child versus adult, actually.

48
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:55,400
It doesn't actually have to do with like, they would put us in a dress because I think

49
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,400
they probably would.

50
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,640
I think it's just more of like, this is for children.

51
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,840
The Bibbidi Bobbidi Boutique is for children.

52
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:05,160
The costuming aspect, I think they probably wouldn't have the correct size, certainly.

53
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,840
I think it's a size issue more than anything else.

54
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,840
Yeah.

55
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,840
Right.

56
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,840
Okay.

57
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,840
We should bring our guest in on this.

58
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,240
This was a little bit too old to our guests.

59
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,800
I was trying to think of something.

60
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,120
But folks, you know our guest from the podcast, Natch Butte.

61
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,160
Ladies and gentlemen, Jackie Johnson is here.

62
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,960
I'm so excited.

63
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,520
This is the best Sunday ever.

64
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,520
I'm so excited.

65
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,520
Wonderful.

66
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,520
Thank you for being here.

67
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:31,040
You tweeted out that you're going to be on the show and a lot of people were excited

68
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,360
and that got me excited.

69
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:37,280
But also, somebody did mention the Bibbidi Bobbidi Boutique as we missed the topic.

70
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,280
I feel really sad.

71
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,880
I've actually never even been in there.

72
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:41,880
Such a letdown.

73
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,880
Were you aware of it though?

74
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,880
Yes.

75
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,160
We'll get into it.

76
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:51,680
But I had never even stepped foot in a Disney park until I was 22 years old.

77
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,240
So I missed it.

78
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,480
Because I would have eaten that shit up honey.

79
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,480
It's like glamour shots but Disney.

80
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,040
My two interests combined baby.

81
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,360
I would have loved it.

82
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,360
I don't know.

83
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,360
I'd have to go in there.

84
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:08,480
But I think we could fool them into thinking Jason's a child.

85
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,480
Well they were experimenting.

86
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:13,480
They shaved you, you know, put you in like a little beanie cap.

87
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,480
Because they can't.

88
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,480
That is big lolly.

89
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,480
Get him a big lolly.

90
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,480
Right.

91
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,480
Give him a huge lolly.

92
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:21,680
That's that forced perspective that Disney is so famous for.

93
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,520
They weren't doing like boys, you know, girls be princesses.

94
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,280
Boys will make you look like a pirate.

95
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,280
Is that the deal?

96
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,280
For a little while.

97
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,280
Maybe still.

98
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,760
Yeah I think there's something like that.

99
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:34,000
But I assume now there's flexibility with that.

100
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,040
I'll call them out for like gender neutrality.

101
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:40,080
I'll be like my motherfucking kid wants to put on a fucking Tinkerbell dress.

102
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,080
Sure.

103
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,080
Absolutely.

104
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,720
They, you know, don't care.

105
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,160
So pop that dress on and let's get the fuck out of here.

106
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,160
Sure.

107
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,160
You're talking about Jason.

108
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,160
Yes.

109
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,160
I can play a bitchy mom.

110
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,840
I don't know if you've ever seen my home goods commercial.

111
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,880
I have not seen your home goods commercial.

112
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,880
I'd love to.

113
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:01,880
So you're Jason's mom in this scenario.

114
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:02,880
Yes.

115
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,880
If they put up any fight at all.

116
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,880
I'm sorry but your son actually looks like a full grown adult.

117
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:08,880
Excuse me.

118
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,880
He has a hormonal condition.

119
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:12,880
You know, whatever.

120
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,880
Yeah, yeah, that plays well.

121
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:14,880
I'll do whatever.

122
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,800
We don't need to do this until we're like sort of at the end I think and scraping sort

123
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,800
of the bottom of the barrel for stuff to talk about.

124
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,800
Right, you've run out of other things.

125
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,440
We're even older so it's even a tougher.

126
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:25,440
Yeah, we're in our late 50s I think by the time we're out of this.

127
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,440
That's how long this goes.

128
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,440
Yeah, I think so.

129
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,440
Maybe we'll actually have a real child at that point that we could force.

130
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,440
A couple years.

131
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,440
If that would be okay.

132
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:37,440
I don't think I'll be ready then.

133
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,440
Yeah, so we'll figure that out then I think.

134
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,440
We don't have to like solve it.

135
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:44,440
But it's still the scenario, even with the actual child, the scenario is still to get

136
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,440
Jason to do it.

137
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,440
Yes, not our child of ours.

138
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,440
Yeah, just Jason.

139
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,080
It just fleshes out the illusion of you as the mom that you have a second child.

140
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,080
Yes.

141
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,080
A baby and one with a condition.

142
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,080
Yeah, we'll get there.

143
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,080
Well, I'm glad we have this all planned out now.

144
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:02,080
So no Disney parks until 22, but you're into it now.

145
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:07,080
Yeah, so I grew up in Dallas and we have Six Flags over Texas.

146
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,080
We have Six Flags Hurricane Harbor.

147
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:12,080
So that's where I was all summer long, honey.

148
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:18,720
All summer long, I was up in Six Flags, riding the rides, eating the nasty food, getting

149
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,720
sunburned.

150
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,720
I was in Hurricane Harbor going down all the slides.

151
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,720
Do they have an annual pass?

152
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,720
Yes.

153
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,720
Did they then?

154
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,720
And that's just what you had?

155
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,720
Yes.

156
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,720
Okay.

157
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,720
Yeah.

158
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,720
And I actually was a total wuss until I was 13, 14.

159
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,720
My best friend, Lauren Campbell, dragged me onto a ride.

160
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,720
I was like, I wouldn't ride any roller coasters that had any loops.

161
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,720
I wouldn't ride anything.

162
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,360
I was like, the Runaway Mine Train, which is a really fun ride.

163
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,360
I don't know if you all have ever been to Six Flags over Texas.

164
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,360
I haven't, no.

165
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,360
And nowhere have we covered it yet.

166
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,360
We'd like to.

167
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,360
Yeah, y'all should go.

168
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,360
And then because, you know, it's what I grew up on.

169
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:56,560
But and but yeah, my parents were cheap and they never took me on vacation, you know,

170
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,560
broken home, all that.

171
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:02,560
So by the time I was when I moved to L.A. is the first time I went.

172
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,560
And I'm telling you, I felt like a child.

173
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:10,060
Though the wonder in my eyes, I had never seen anything like Disney before.

174
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:12,060
It was so beautiful.

175
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:13,560
It's so thoughtful.

176
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:18,560
The Q experiences, all the visuals, even the employees are nice.

177
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,960
I mean, Six Flags employees are like horny teens, you know, trying to get through their

178
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,960
damn day for the most part.

179
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:25,960
Right.

180
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:28,960
And I rate because they have to work and they would rather just be horny.

181
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,960
They would rather be doing the other half of their brain.

182
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:33,960
Exactly.

183
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,960
Summer jobs, you know, mom made him get out of the house.

184
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,960
And I was just like, this is amazing.

185
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:41,060
I stayed from the very beginning to the very end.

186
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,060
We rode every ride.

187
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,060
I mean, it was amazing.

188
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:46,060
I went with two of my sorority sisters.

189
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:53,060
But I have an interesting perspective to be here because I'm not the I'm not the biggest

190
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:54,060
enthusiast like y'all.

191
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:58,060
I have the perspective of being married to one of y'all.

192
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:05,060
I am married to a theme park nut, an enthusiast of the space.

193
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:06,060
OK.

194
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,160
Like lifelong, like lifelong.

195
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:12,160
And there is no park unturned.

196
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:17,160
I mean, we will detour 30 minutes an hour to get to park every trip we go on.

197
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:21,160
I have to negotiate how many theme parks we go on trips, you know.

198
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:26,160
So I've kind of learned to appreciate it more through him.

199
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,160
I've always been.

200
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,160
I like it.

201
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:32,160
But like when I listen to this show and by the way, I am a listener podcast.

202
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,160
Thank you.

203
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:34,160
Shout out to Steve Brandano.

204
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,160
Sure.

205
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:36,260
Yeah.

206
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:37,260
Hi, Steve.

207
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:38,260
Yeah.

208
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:39,260
Hi, Steve.

209
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:41,260
We maybe Howard Stern will come up.

210
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:42,260
Who knows?

211
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:45,260
Michael and I share that another weird niche fandom.

212
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:51,660
But, you know, I love experiencing the parks with my husband, you know, and like I've gotten

213
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,660
more into it because of him.

214
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:59,860
So, so will you do you like see his face on our faces when you're like, is it sound?

215
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:01,260
Does it feel the same?

216
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:02,660
Is it feel like obsessive?

217
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:07,560
Just appreciative, you know, and that's another thing.

218
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:12,760
I guess again, growing up only going to Six Flags, which like Six Flags has like, I'd be

219
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:16,360
like, oh my God, look up dirty old Batmobile bleach from the sun.

220
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,360
Whoa.

221
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,360
I thought it was cool.

222
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:21,860
But then you go to Disney and you're like, damn, the game is strong.

223
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,360
I mean, it's on a whole other level.

224
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,360
You know, you didn't know it could be that way.

225
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,960
Your standards were lower.

226
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,160
You feel happy.

227
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,360
It truly is the happiest place.

228
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:38,460
I took my father, who had never been to Disney as well, a few years ago, and I saw his face

229
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:39,460
do the same thing.

230
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:41,660
I mean, he was like, I looked over him and it's a small world.

231
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:44,460
He had the biggest smile on his face.

232
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:46,060
You know, it was amazing.

233
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:47,860
It was like, it truly is magical.

234
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:52,760
And I think because we all go all the time and we are childless people in our thirties,

235
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,960
we kind of lose that nostalgia and that magic.

236
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,660
But it really is a magical place.

237
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:58,860
Yeah, we agree.

238
00:09:58,860 --> 00:09:59,860
And it's a treat.

239
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:00,860
It's a treat.

240
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,360
It's a privilege.

241
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,360
It's important to remember that too.

242
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:09,960
The worst thing is when you get into the perfunctory, you know, it's all about the math and like,

243
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,160
okay, well, if we cut through here, we save five minutes.

244
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,160
And all right, so we can get on this at 335.

245
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:19,660
I think we've probably all had moments of that of like, wait a minute, are we forgetting

246
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,160
to have fun?

247
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:30,360
Although I will say almost every time I still am just like pure giddy happy lost in it.

248
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,260
Yeah, there's always like one or two things.

249
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:35,760
I think at the end of the day, you're like, well, that was great.

250
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:40,260
It becomes weird too, because we're so obsessed that it literally could just be like going

251
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:42,460
on a ride at night or something.

252
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:44,060
We're like, wow, we never did that before.

253
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:47,460
Which I mean, it gets to like, we're playing in the margins here, actually.

254
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:50,460
But there's still like, your brain is still processing.

255
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:54,060
That lets you find a lot of new little magic wrinkles.

256
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,060
Yes, for sure.

257
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:59,860
You know, we came out of Alice in Wonderland while the parade was going on.

258
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:03,560
So we were right above the parade during the outside party.

259
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:06,560
Little tiny like, sure that changes it up.

260
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,560
We've talked about how we rode and I've done this once or twice before.

261
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:14,560
We were a big thunder while the fireworks were going off and it's like, whoa, I can't

262
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,360
believe the fireworks are happening on the roller coaster.

263
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,560
It hit this bend like perfectly almost the fireworks.

264
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:27,360
It almost went left to right as did we and it was so romantic for Mike and I.

265
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:29,060
I'm not very significant.

266
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:31,060
We were together. We were alone.

267
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:33,260
Wow, that's so romantic.

268
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:37,860
And also you can get the ash in your eye at a high speed velocity as opposed to just

269
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:40,660
standing still and getting ash in your eye.

270
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:42,060
You get to take something home with you.

271
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:43,660
Yeah, it feels different with thrust.

272
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:43,860
Yes.

273
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:44,060
Yeah.

274
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:50,760
You know what else adds to the magic as you age and also to kind of help make the experience

275
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:53,460
new again is to get fucked up.

276
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:54,060
Certainly.

277
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,960
Well, sure.

278
00:11:55,960 --> 00:12:00,660
I don't drink alcohol, but I have overdosed on marijuana at Disneyland several times.

279
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:01,460
Oh my.

280
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:04,660
To the fact that I was like, we almost got a room at Grand California.

281
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:06,460
And I was like, we have to get out of here.

282
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:07,660
Oh, you have to like chill out.

283
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,160
It was really, really bad.

284
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:09,860
Oh, wow.

285
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:10,860
Wow.

286
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:13,960
We've talked about this a little bit like bad trips or whatever.

287
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,060
I've never been high at Disneyland.

288
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:17,060
I think I'm afraid.

289
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:18,760
I don't want to have like some bad.

290
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,460
Oh wait, I'm afraid.

291
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:20,960
Except for Downtown Disney.

292
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:23,460
I got too high in the Rainforest Cafe.

293
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:27,160
I think I mentioned a long time ago and it influenced my decision to not go to Chapman

294
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:27,960
University.

295
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:28,360
Oh, yeah.

296
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,860
I don't like Ganaim.

297
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:34,560
I don't want to be here because of a unrelated because because I had a bad time at the Rainforest

298
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,060
Cafe.

299
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:36,160
If you can imagine that.

300
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:36,660
Hmm.

301
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:37,460
Impossible.

302
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:38,760
Most most times.

303
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:43,060
Have you all ever done like I know people that go to Disneyland on mushrooms and crazy shit

304
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:44,160
like that like acid.

305
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,860
I've only had marijuana at my own at Disney.

306
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:49,060
I would never do it.

307
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,360
I can't handle it.

308
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,360
This is not a big like a puritanical thing.

309
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:52,660
Yeah.

310
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:54,660
Just truly like I'll lose my mind.

311
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:57,960
So I think yeah, you're a stressed out weed person.

312
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,960
I can't I've tried try it.

313
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:04,860
Maybe if I could try it once a year and then it just doesn't it's not going to happen.

314
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:08,860
I don't think somebody and everyone is always like you're not doing the right thing, bro.

315
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:09,960
You don't know what you're doing.

316
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,660
And it's like I think I'm good.

317
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:16,760
I think you have no desire to learn no desire to learn I guess but I would love to learn

318
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:20,360
but I yeah, it makes it so much more fun.

319
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:20,760
Really?

320
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,060
Okay.

321
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:21,660
Oh my God.

322
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:23,660
It makes it you laugh.

323
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:25,160
Everything looks awesome.

324
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:28,360
I mean, I've had some of the best moments of my life probably.

325
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:32,060
Do you remember any specific any specific highlights or is it all kind of a blur?

326
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:35,060
No, I got specifics honey.

327
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:42,660
So when I went to Disney World for my first and only time in 2015, we were stopping there

328
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:47,260
before we went to the Bahamas and because again every trip I go on we negotiate theme

329
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:47,760
parks.

330
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,460
So I never been we did Animal Kingdom, which we'll talk about.

331
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:55,460
But then we took we drove to Magic Kingdom, right?

332
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,460
The you take that boat over.

333
00:13:57,460 --> 00:14:07,060
So we pop some candies and we got fucked up and you know, I will talk about this.

334
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:12,360
I guess but I'm not like a big food drink enthusiast because I don't eat anything and

335
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,060
I don't drink alcohol.

336
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,560
So like I don't care about food.

337
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,160
I only eat food to live so I don't fall over.

338
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:21,860
So but I you can there's we'll talk about it maybe but I have some Instagram accounts

339
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:23,160
for vegan food at Disney.

340
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:28,860
So I had this burger or like a veggie burger and I piled it's like, you know, a little

341
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:29,860
salad bar kind of thing.

342
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:35,060
I piled so many damn pepper Cheney's on this burger pepper Cheney's lettuce.

343
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:36,160
I was eating it.

344
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,760
It was the best fucking thing I've ever eaten and it might have been garbage, but I was

345
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,860
like, this is so good.

346
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:48,660
So then we went on we went on the Space Mountain and the Space Mountain at Disney World is

347
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:50,960
single riders in a line.

348
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,360
Yep.

349
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,360
And rough.

350
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:52,860
Yes.

351
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:59,260
So my husband is behind me and I hear him laughing so hard that he's crying and then

352
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:00,660
I start crying laughing.

353
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:04,360
But then I start thinking oh my God, my head is going to get lobbed off because it's in

354
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:07,460
the dark and you get paranoid and I'm like, I'm going to die.

355
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:10,760
So I'm thinking I'm going to die and I'm crying laughing.

356
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:14,060
It was such an intense amazing experience and I it was so fun.

357
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:14,860
She loved it.

358
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:17,660
I mean, I that's the thing.

359
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:23,560
If you if you OD it could get really bad and this was like borderline too much.

360
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:30,060
The other really bad time was at Disneyland and Tortilla Joe's and we we always go to

361
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:31,760
Tortilla Joe's we get fucked up.

362
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:35,260
We go to Tortilla Joe's we load up and then we like go into the park.

363
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:37,260
We were fucking gone.

364
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:39,360
We way overdosed.

365
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,860
And that's my advice to everybody out there.

366
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:44,560
Be careful with your dosage of marijuana.

367
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,060
Be careful with your dosage.

368
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:51,860
We had drank this can of quench and I didn't know but drinking marijuana actually makes

369
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:54,160
you metabolize it way fast very fast.

370
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:54,760
Yeah.

371
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:59,460
And we made like Arnold Palmer's with like teas with this lemon can of course.

372
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:03,060
I you know the like table side guac service.

373
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:03,960
Of course.

374
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:08,460
I wish I could interview the guy that did our guac because it felt like he was there

375
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:13,660
for seven hours and we were losing our minds and Adam is my rock and like he keeps me safe

376
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:17,060
and I actually don't even know my way around Disney because he's a tour guide.

377
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,360
So I just like grab onto him.

378
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,860
I don't know where I'm going up because he keeps me safe.

379
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:24,760
He was a mess and I was like what's going to happen like this fucked up wind up leaving.

380
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:29,760
We didn't even eat our food walking around the park panicked didn't ride anything and

381
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:30,560
I was like we got to eat.

382
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:30,960
We got to eat.

383
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:31,460
We got to eat.

384
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:34,660
We got to eat and I don't know if it's your body telling you to eat.

385
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:35,460
You know the munchies.

386
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:39,060
It's like does your body tell you to eat because food will metabolize the marijuana out.

387
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:43,060
That's a new theory that I got well fucked up in that moment or is it something else?

388
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:47,660
But I was like eating those Mickey pretzels Mickey pretzels Mickey pretzels popcorn popcorn

389
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:50,960
because I'm vegan and there's not that you know don't whip don't whip pretzel pretzel.

390
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,260
I mean I couldn't stop eating.

391
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:53,360
I was like I got to help.

392
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,760
I got to stop this.

393
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,660
We were there for hours didn't write a damn thing.

394
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:57,160
Whoa.

395
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,560
So just wandering just wandering.

396
00:16:59,560 --> 00:16:59,860
Huh?

397
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:00,960
It sounds like a nightmare.

398
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:01,260
Yes.

399
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:02,060
It was a nightmare.

400
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:04,260
These bad ones don't seem worth the good ones.

401
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:05,860
Good ones are describing sound very nice.

402
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:09,060
You got to be careful because I don't want to it's illegal.

403
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,760
You can't and I don't like breaking rules.

404
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:18,260
You cannot Disney is straight like you're not supposed to have like like even if you were staying at the hotels like on Disney property.

405
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:21,660
They do not want marijuana despite it being laws.

406
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:24,660
Yeah, despite it being recreationally legal in California.

407
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:28,260
And if you were staying at the hotel like you can wheel in a case of beer.

408
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:28,660
Right.

409
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:30,160
That's fine.

410
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,360
Which seems kind of silly.

411
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,260
But of course.

412
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:32,660
Yeah.

413
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:36,760
But like I smoked out the Grand California in one time.

414
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:40,460
I forgot that before the return of Captain EO.

415
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:41,260
Look at you.

416
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,260
We made a night.

417
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,160
I stayed at the Grand.

418
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:46,260
We and several other me and the balcony.

419
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:51,460
And Katie I think just in the room and it then it reeked and it was in a non smoking room.

420
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:51,860
Yeah.

421
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:52,260
Yeah.

422
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:52,460
Yeah.

423
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:53,260
Well brazen.

424
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:57,160
But that's that's the how much I love the EO.

425
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:00,660
Why I'm willing to break hotel rules for it.

426
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:01,360
But I didn't.

427
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:03,860
I and now I don't remember.

428
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:08,460
I must have been really light with it being afraid of a bad trip because I don't remember

429
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:10,260
even any specific.

430
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:11,360
I just got to be careful.

431
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,460
I never overdosed after that.

432
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:19,560
But because it's illegal I get fucked up prior to entering and I and I don't smoke smoke.

433
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:22,660
So I have to use edibles and things.

434
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:25,360
But after that I learned the lesson to be way more moderate with.

435
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:25,960
Yeah.

436
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:29,760
Also be very careful with like the security is so intense.

437
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,160
Like they have caught people at the metal detector.

438
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:38,860
I've seen somebody on our Facebook put a photo of a guy that was dressed in disguise and

439
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:40,960
he caught people with edibles.

440
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:41,760
Oh yeah.

441
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:46,360
And it's like a dad and like a turkey leg t-shirt like over.

442
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:46,760
Yeah.

443
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,960
It was a plain clothes.

444
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:49,560
Yeah.

445
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:52,360
I think maybe I've told them this on the show.

446
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:56,560
The only theme park that's ever happened was that I had a friend in town and my friend

447
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:02,560
loves to imbibe with the weed chocolate.

448
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:08,760
So we he made me take some and we went to the House of Horrors at Universal Studios.

449
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:09,760
Oh hell yes.

450
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,960
And I had a headache after that.

451
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,360
Chucky attacked him with a knife and I lost my mind.

452
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:19,560
See I always get fucked up before I go to the haunted things.

453
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,360
Well I can see that you were.

454
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,160
We had a couple.

455
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,960
Now I'm in the haunts now.

456
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:29,560
I had a couple beers before and I do think that seems fun because my my thing with Disney

457
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:34,960
is just in the middle of the day to Carthay, Manhattan's one and one is fine also.

458
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,960
But if you do too you're really that's good.

459
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:37,760
You lose a goose.

460
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,760
You're ready to go.

461
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,960
That's the refresher.

462
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:43,360
Then you're then the whole park is fresh and new again.

463
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,360
That's what I'm saying.

464
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:46,360
You know alter that mind baby.

465
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:46,760
Yeah.

466
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:54,160
So that's my version of it possibly getting like a beer on the over by the Chinese food place.

467
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,960
You like you just like getting high on grenadine.

468
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:57,360
Yeah.

469
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,360
Well that is true.

470
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,560
I like the cherry.

471
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,360
I like the alcohol.

472
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:06,960
So if it was just a bottle of alcohol so alcohol so cherries, I think that would be better for me.

473
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:07,960
Just eating the cherries.

474
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:08,960
Is that an off value?

475
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,960
Is that an off menu item at the car thing?

476
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:15,360
Can I just get a bucket of cherries a bucket of cherries, but they've been lightly soaked.

477
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:15,760
Yeah.

478
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,360
So there's a little bit of alcohol content.

479
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:17,560
Yeah.

480
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:17,760
Yeah.

481
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:23,160
Mainly mainly if you're with a plaid tour guide if you're with a VIP tour guide, they'll give you that.

482
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:23,760
Yeah, that's true.

483
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,160
Yeah.

484
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,560
Have you all ever done those?

485
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:29,160
I got old money bags has yeah, I didn't pay.

486
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,160
How much is it?

487
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:35,360
Is like 500 an hour or something something like that?

488
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,360
Yeah, it's not.

489
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,360
Yeah, it's it's everyone can get it too.

490
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,160
I didn't realize that until a year ago.

491
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:44,960
Yeah, Jason's qualification for being a money bags is knowing someone with money.

492
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,160
Yeah, right.

493
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,360
Oh, Mr. knows a money bag.

494
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:53,360
Hollywood Hollywood Carlson probably would have been the better.

495
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:59,760
Jason's that would have been the Jason's also like I maybe like he'll see me like in a different pair of pants.

496
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,360
Like I have three pairs of pants and when we can be like, oh, someone's doing well.

497
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,960
You would have a cutting Jason was like, you're a bit of a clothes horse.

498
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:08,760
Aren't you?

499
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:11,360
That is all you rotate your closet a lot.

500
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,160
I know, but no one else has ever said that.

501
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:17,560
I'm just saying like no one else has been like, huh, is that new?

502
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,160
Like maybe that's I know.

503
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:21,160
You're adding that judgment in there.

504
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,560
I am not adding that judgment in there.

505
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,160
I was trying to pay you a compliment.

506
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,360
Just did a couple seconds ago.

507
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,360
What the judge?

508
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,760
Oh, the judgment about the clothes.

509
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,560
Yeah, about the clothes.

510
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:33,160
OK, so you you judged me in different ways.

511
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,760
No, that was an observation.

512
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,760
The clothes are sure that was like a compliment.

513
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,160
The clothes horse was benign.

514
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:41,760
The other ones definitely had a definitely with judging.

515
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,160
Oh, yes. You're very cavalier with money and I worry about you.

516
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:48,960
I was being honest, you know, my I think.

517
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,160
I think my role in the podcast once and maybe I view it sometimes

518
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:55,960
as being something of a referee between Mike and Jason.

519
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,360
And here's what I'll say.

520
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,360
Yeah, that does.

521
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:03,760
That I do when you tell that I do hear the judgment.

522
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,960
And I feel like that judgment is familiar to me.

523
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:10,360
However, I've also heard Mike tell stories in which judgment is added

524
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:14,960
that was not there in my version of the original story.

525
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,360
So I think there could be fault on both sides here.

526
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,760
That is my official referee call.

527
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,760
I need a whistle for these in the future.

528
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:25,160
That sounds like you're not your everyone wins.

529
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,160
I think yes.

530
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,560
Everyone is right and wrong.

531
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,560
Very diplomatic.

532
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:32,360
Yeah, so fuck both y'all.

533
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,160
That's my real thing.

534
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:36,360
Yeah, that's fine.

535
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,360
I'll take it.

536
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,560
He'll go around.

537
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:43,360
So Jackie, were you like way into Disney as a child, just the movies

538
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,560
and stuff as well?

539
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,660
Yes, definitely.

540
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:46,660
Nineties kid.

541
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:49,660
I mean, Little Mermaid, Lion King, Aladdin, that kind of sweet spot.

542
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:50,460
The music.

543
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:51,260
Yes.

544
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:51,660
Yeah.

545
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:56,260
And I had wanted to go to Disney, but again, never got taken.

546
00:22:56,260 --> 00:23:00,260
I mean, in Texas, you're smacking the middle.

547
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:01,060
Exactly.

548
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:03,060
And again, we had six flags.

549
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:09,460
So I always wondered why or if Disney ever thought about doing a Texas

550
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:10,660
outpost.

551
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:13,460
That seems like a good it's in the middle.

552
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:17,060
I don't think it would split the audience of either California or

553
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:21,060
whereas it weirdly they were trying to do the one in Virginia, which I

554
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:24,260
think would cut into Florida.

555
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:28,660
But like Texas, it feels like also there be some massive piece of property.

556
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:29,260
For sure.

557
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:30,260
Perfect for Disney.

558
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:34,060
Texas cut a big old cattle ranch down or something.

559
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:36,660
You know, that shit over a skedaddle.

560
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:41,660
I feel like we're not going to get another like state park.

561
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:42,660
They're going to do much more.

562
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:46,060
Like there would be like 10 more China parks before we get like another

563
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:46,660
one in America.

564
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:47,660
You mean from scratch?

565
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:48,660
Yes.

566
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:52,460
You think unless they start buying up, unless we have you know, there was

567
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:54,260
the rumor that they're going to buy knots.

568
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:57,460
I could see that sort of thing occurring.

569
00:23:57,460 --> 00:24:02,660
They become a Westfield of would there be like a shuttle like underground

570
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:04,060
between the two or something?

571
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:08,260
Well, they were talking about a Monterey a lot when they was a 10 years ago,

572
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:10,060
15 years ago, 20 years ago, I think.

573
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:10,660
20 years ago.

574
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:11,460
Yeah.

575
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:13,660
How cute was that Monorail in Japan?

576
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,060
Oh, yeah, very cute.

577
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:16,460
Oh, you done Japan then.

578
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:21,260
So like everybody in 2018, I went to Tokyo.

579
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:22,660
I went in a couple of nights.

580
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:24,660
This is the Japan time in everyone's lives.

581
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:25,460
What is that?

582
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:26,860
Yeah, what's happening?

583
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:30,060
Somebody went and then everyone was like, oh, I should do that.

584
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:30,460
I don't know.

585
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:34,460
Literally every motherfucker in LA went to Japan last year.

586
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:36,460
Everyone, dozens of people.

587
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:41,060
If I throw any recommendations, there's like the like three page

588
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:43,460
dense, dense tome email.

589
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:46,260
I feel like I have this from 12 people, which is great.

590
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:47,060
I'm so excited.

591
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:48,060
This is all wonderful.

592
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:50,060
But yeah, it is what's in the water.

593
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:50,860
Why are we all?

594
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:51,660
I don't know.

595
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:52,460
What are we after?

596
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:55,860
I feel like it hit critical mass in the last couple of years.

597
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:59,660
I do feel like maybe my parents or other people like a certain generation.

598
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:04,260
It's still kind of like Japan is kind of a strange place to go.

599
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:04,660
Right.

600
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:07,660
But really, Japan has been here all along.

601
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:09,260
Mario has been here all along.

602
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:12,860
You know, like there's so many different things that like are part of our culture

603
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:17,860
and then anime and all that's like everything makes sense to Doc Brown in 1955.

604
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:21,060
In 85, he knows the Japanese make all the best stuff.

605
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:26,660
So like I feel like we finally like as a culture been like, oh, yeah, there's a bunch of cool crap there.

606
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:29,860
And then you go there and it's like, this is very familiar.

607
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:31,060
This is like very similar.

608
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:35,260
Tony Baxter was talking about how like the culture there is very similar to American culture.

609
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:40,260
When they build a Disney there, like cute is a thing that resonates with the people there

610
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:45,660
as opposed to France where they shun cute when you get past five years old or something.

611
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:52,260
So it's like we went there and we've been listening to especially I've been digging deep with Japanese city pop lately

612
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:53,660
and like Japanese rock and roll.

613
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:58,660
You're like, this is just a parallel universe where it's the exact same sound as our pop music.

614
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:02,260
So it's like awesome because you're like, this sounds like a Neil Young record that never came out,

615
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:05,860
but it's Japanese people and they're singing in Japan or Japanese.

616
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:12,660
Overwhelming that it's like an entire you mean I'm not even done with cool pop culture, especially in the 70s, 80s.

617
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:14,060
Yeah.

618
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:15,260
So how do you even begin?

619
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:16,060
I don't understand.

620
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:16,460
So yeah.

621
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:22,060
And then with Japan, of course, the added thing of like there's a Disneyland there and then it's like a really good Disneyland.

622
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:23,260
And also like what you think?

623
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:24,860
What was your time?

624
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:25,260
It was good.

625
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:27,260
I know you haven't been I know you don't want to know.

626
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:30,460
I thoroughly enjoyed the podcast to ride on it.

627
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:31,860
I was I texted Mike.

628
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:36,660
I was like driving and just and just nodding my head being like, yep, yep, yep.

629
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:38,260
It was really cool.

630
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:45,660
We did not go as extensively as they did, you know, like going to the damn Auntie Skunk's Cafe and sitting for two hours.

631
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:52,260
We didn't do that, you know, we were we only had two days and we really like hustled.

632
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:52,660
Yeah.

633
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:58,960
And that's we had we got an amazing flight for people that are curious about going to Japan.

634
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,360
Black Friday, Singapore Air.

635
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:06,760
We had round trip tickets on Singapore Air, which is a luxury airline for three hundred dollars.

636
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:07,360
Wow.

637
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:07,960
That's crazy.

638
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:10,160
The catch is it was only for a week.

639
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:12,360
So we made that trip count.

640
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:17,160
I mean, we because I also went up to see the snow monkeys up in the Alps of Japan.

641
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:17,560
Right.

642
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:20,960
And that took a two days and then we did a real con up there was awesome.

643
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:27,560
And then we had, of course, because I married Adam McCabe two days at Disney negotiated and negotiated.

644
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,960
I was comfortable with non theme park.

645
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,360
Yeah, of course.

646
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:31,960
Yes.

647
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:32,360
Sure.

648
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,660
You know, we only did two days.

649
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:36,460
We did one day at Disney and one day at Tokyo Disney Sea.

650
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:37,760
Well, how'd that go?

651
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,360
Was it hellish?

652
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,960
So explain to me.

653
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,360
You need a lot of time.

654
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,760
Please lay it on thicker.

655
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:44,160
Please.

656
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:48,960
I don't think this is a constant thing of like how many days do you spend there?

657
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:53,760
And I remember when I think Adam was talking to you, Mike, and he said you only need two days and you were like,

658
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,360
what we're doing for, you know, but again,

659
00:27:56,360 --> 00:28:00,560
we don't sit at Mama Skunk's Cafe like we don't go in every goddamn bathroom.

660
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,560
You don't look at everything.

661
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:01,960
Is that right?

662
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,160
Mama Skunk's Cafe?

663
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,360
What's her name?

664
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:06,360
Her name, I believe, is Grandma Sarah.

665
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,760
Grandma Sarah.

666
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,760
Hello, honey.

667
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:09,960
I don't know. She was not a skunk.

668
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,160
She was like a bad, bad.

669
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:12,960
A possum.

670
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:13,760
Possum.

671
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:14,160
Okay.

672
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,560
Well, y'all know what I meant, damn it.

673
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,060
Yeah, we did.

674
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:16,560
I didn't know.

675
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:20,160
Yeah, but you know, it's it was awesome.

676
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:23,560
I think Tokyo Disney Sea is my favorite Disney park now.

677
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:24,360
Sure.

678
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,860
But Animal Kingdom second.

679
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:26,460
Sure.

680
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:26,860
Yeah.

681
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:27,260
Yeah.

682
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:29,860
Which do you want to start getting into it?

683
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:33,660
I mean, we can also we can tangent forever.

684
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:37,060
I also just want to say that y'all have to go to Efteling.

685
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:37,460
Okay.

686
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:37,860
I know.

687
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:38,860
None of y'all have been?

688
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:39,260
None of us.

689
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:40,460
Jason, you ever been?

690
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:42,260
No, I've never been to Europe.

691
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:44,060
Y'all gotta fucking go, man.

692
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:44,860
Is there a deal?

693
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:47,060
Is there a Black Friday deal that you know of?

694
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:47,860
I don't know.

695
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:48,260
Okay.

696
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:51,060
You just because you fly into Amsterdam.

697
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:52,860
Oh, what is that one?

698
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:53,660
Norwegian Air.

699
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:55,060
Have y'all flown on Norwegian Air?

700
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:55,660
No.

701
00:28:55,660 --> 00:29:00,860
Norwegian Air is the spirit airlines of Europe, but not not that bad.

702
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:01,260
Right.

703
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:02,860
It was actually really nice.

704
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:06,460
It's no frills, but you can get cheap flights.

705
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:10,660
Yeah, like $250 to Europe from LA.

706
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:11,860
You can get cheap flights.

707
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:13,860
They do Black Friday, but they have sales all the time.

708
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:14,860
Get on their email list.

709
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:16,060
I'm going to run that.

710
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:17,660
We're going to I want to do a Europe trip soon.

711
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:19,660
I'm going to run it by my business manager over here.

712
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:19,860
Okay.

713
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:23,260
On the couch and I'm going to see if I can afford it in the next couple years.

714
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:27,060
I'm going to get these stack of Chase Visa cards on the couch next to me.

715
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:29,060
I'm just going to pay the credit cards.

716
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:34,260
It's next to the payday loan form to pay for the...

717
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:36,460
He was crushed by all his credit cards.

718
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:39,460
All 250 choked him.

719
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:40,660
That would be a fine way to go.

720
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:47,260
See, that's what I thought why so many people are going to LA because

721
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:53,060
or going to Japan because from LA it's usually less expensive to fly

722
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:55,260
to Asia as opposed to flying to Europe.

723
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,260
Interesting.

724
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:58,260
You can get cheap flights.

725
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:03,860
Yeah, there's a couple Twitter accounts that are like just have constant sales and stuff.

726
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:09,660
So yeah, Norwegian Air and Singapore Air Black Friday if you want to go.

727
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:12,860
And we almost got these cheap flights to Bali.

728
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:13,660
Really?

729
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:16,260
Because I was like we got to plan a trip for 2019.

730
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:17,060
Where are we going to go?

731
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:18,260
Adam wants to go to Switzerland.

732
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:22,860
I was trying to do Norwegian Air and it wasn't really working.

733
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:26,860
To get out there, but I was like it was so cheap to go to Bali and I was like,

734
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:29,860
oh we should do this, but I didn't done research.

735
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:30,560
I love planning.

736
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,860
I love a good itinerary.

737
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:33,260
I love a good plan.

738
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:34,060
Sure.

739
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:38,060
What did you tie Efteling into with your negotiation theme park?

740
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:39,060
Okay, on our honeymoon.

741
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:43,060
So for our honeymoon we did London, Paris, Amsterdam.

742
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:43,860
Wow, wonderful.

743
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:50,060
And Efteling is if people don't know it's older than Disneyland by a few years

744
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:52,660
and the rumor is that Walt went there saw and said,

745
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:55,660
oh I got to do this in America and kind of ripped it off.

746
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:59,660
That I just saw the weekend this weekend that was debunked.

747
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:00,260
Oh interesting.

748
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:03,460
There's no record that that he was there, but I have heard that.

749
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:04,060
Yeah, I don't know.

750
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:04,460
You're right.

751
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:05,060
I just read it.

752
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:07,260
No trip log in his lifetime of.

753
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:08,660
I mean they saved everything else.

754
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:12,660
So it wouldn't surprise me if there if there was but it doesn't seem like it.

755
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:13,060
Interesting.

756
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:18,460
That guy that guy on who on Instagram stories who works for Disney who's always answering questions.

757
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:19,060
Okay.

758
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:21,660
Said he had never come across that.

759
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:22,460
Huh?

760
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:26,060
Unless he's just covering for his favorite.

761
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:27,660
Oh, yeah.

762
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:35,660
He could be could be covering for the narrative like no, no, it's never what no waves for the bench that we bought.

763
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:39,260
The historic Griffith Park and that is the tail.

764
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:46,460
It would be funny of like the historian that finds like the Walt notes from Efteling and the pictures of him there and like thinking and he's like I must burn this.

765
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:49,260
The mother world like least like least.

766
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:50,260
Oh, yeah.

767
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:53,860
I feel like I read that they also like helped Walt.

768
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:54,460
Oh, man.

769
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:59,260
Some of the planners or ride people were involved in Disney, but I don't know.

770
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:08,860
Well, and what I've learned now is that this place Garner Holt's animatronics, which is responsible for like all these great animatronics and knots and also what do they do in Disney?

771
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:12,860
They did Jack Skellington and the new dragon and phantasmic.

772
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:15,060
The monsters in Tokyo, right?

773
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:16,060
Oh, I think so.

774
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:18,460
And what's the other one?

775
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:19,460
Mystic Manor.

776
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:23,660
Do they do and they've done a lot of they've done a ton of animatronics for Efteling as well.

777
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:28,460
So if you feel Disney vibes there now, it could be the Garner Holt thing.

778
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:29,460
Yeah.

779
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:31,660
So they and that made me want to go really bad.

780
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:32,260
I didn't know.

781
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:42,260
I feel like I had heard it presented or I was like, is this some like preserved in Amber weird Park from the past and hearing that they have cutting edge stuff to it's both.

782
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:44,060
It is very much.

783
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:49,260
I mean, you're literally in a forest in the middle of the Netherlands.

784
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:50,460
I went in the fall.

785
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:51,860
It was so gorgeous.

786
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:56,660
I mean, it's not like Disney where you're in like a suburban area and there's homes and you're turning in.

787
00:32:56,660 --> 00:33:02,260
I mean, the ride to get to Efteling is probably the craziest ride that you'll go on there.

788
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:10,660
I mean, because you take this crazy bus from a subway stop out of Amsterdam and it was nuts and everyone warned me, but I don't want to ruin it.

789
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:20,260
If you've been Efteling and you got there from from Amsterdam, you know, it's just the bus driver and it was full of people like Dutch people on their way to work and living their lives.

790
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:26,060
And we're two childless 30 year olds from fucking America with our luggage, you know, schlepping it there.

791
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:27,860
But it's crazy.

792
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:32,060
But it's a beautiful park and it's fantasy fairy tale.

793
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:39,460
And you're immersed so deeply because no one's speaking English around you and nothing is in English.

794
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:47,460
It has really cool fun cutting edge rides, but it also has like classic old wooden creatures and the lighting is beautiful.

795
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:50,460
And once again, Amsterdam, I was fucked up.

796
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:57,060
But but not that much because the weed in Amsterdam didn't work on me because I'm a California stoner.

797
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:58,660
I'm not really I don't really even smoke that much.

798
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:00,060
You needed the corn syrup.

799
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:02,460
You needed that American corn syrup additive.

800
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:05,460
The GMO on Santo shit.

801
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:05,860
Yeah.

802
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:07,660
Do they sell weed at Efteling?

803
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:08,660
No, no, no, no, no.

804
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:11,260
Yeah. And and I like I said, we didn't smoke it.

805
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:12,260
I don't think you're allowed.

806
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:15,460
And I'm obviously not going to break laws internationally either.

807
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:20,260
So I had like an edible cookie or something and it was OK.

808
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:21,260
It was really light.

809
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:25,860
It was nice. I would have liked to up it a little bit, but it helps.

810
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:27,260
It helps enhance the experience.

811
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:31,660
That seems like a place to do talk to any of the boom Chicago people.

812
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:38,460
Any of our friends at Boom Chicago is a comedy show in the Netherlands or in Amsterdam that a lot of friends of ours from like

813
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:41,460
the upper citizens brigade go over and perform at.

814
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:43,060
They go on acid.

815
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:46,860
They go on everything and the stories are insane.

816
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:53,460
I don't want to name names in case anybody's embarrassed, but we have friends that have gone to Efteling like fully fucked up on like crazy drugs.

817
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:58,260
Do you OK? I'm not asking you to name names or not, but I'm here's what I'm curious about.

818
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:07,260
Can you can you name something in Efteling that you think would be particularly frightening while on acid or something or something that factors into one of their stories?

819
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:11,060
There are some the Dutch are a wild bunch.

820
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:15,060
There's like spooky stuff at Efteling.

821
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:17,860
There's a lot like weird moody rides.

822
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:20,460
There's a ride called.

823
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:22,060
Oh, what is it?

824
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:25,260
It was this one ride that everyone told us to go on.

825
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:27,260
It's sort of like a madhouse.

826
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:31,660
OK, I don't want to ruin anything, but that would probably be a pretty weird experience.

827
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:37,060
There are some like ghosty things, kind of haunted mansion ask things.

828
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:41,260
And crazy rides like roller coasters and thrilling things.

829
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:43,860
The flying Dutchman, honey.

830
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:46,460
Do you know anything about Efteling?

831
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:52,660
No, I'm not in any spoiler territory, but I'd like to go someday.

832
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:53,860
What's up with flying Dutchman?

833
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:55,260
It's a water.

834
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:57,060
It's like a haunted.

835
00:35:57,060 --> 00:36:00,260
Oh, haunted pirate ship water ride.

836
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:03,860
Well, all right, and they do crazy.

837
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:04,860
I mean, y'all got to go.

838
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:10,460
If you're a theme park head and you're looking for a trip, y'all got to go to Efteling.

839
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:12,060
Now really cool.

840
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:16,660
So so let me for just the very boring practical nature of it.

841
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:18,260
So how do you get there?

842
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:20,660
Because I have heard it's far away.

843
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:24,260
So but you can take this magical bus from Amsterdam.

844
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:25,460
I'm not going to lie to you all.

845
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:29,860
It was a little stressful to get there and I had been warned that it was and I had emails

846
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:34,060
detailed from from again, friends of ours who did Boob Chicago like OK, you turn left.

847
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:36,460
You're going to see a green light go three steps forward.

848
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:38,460
I mean, I had really detailed emails.

849
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:43,460
I remember we were leaving our hotel in Amsterdam and our fucking Internet and our phones just

850
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:44,460
stop working.

851
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:47,660
And it's one of those things where it's like you don't expect that to happen.

852
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:49,260
So we were totally boned.

853
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:51,860
So we missed a train, missed a train and like screw us up.

854
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:53,060
Finally, our phones are working.

855
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:56,860
We get on the train because Google Maps is really helpful in Japan.

856
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:59,260
I mean, we did y'all get a portable Wi-Fi?

857
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:02,660
No, mine was just my I have the plan that it's fine.

858
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:05,460
I got a portable Wi-Fi ahead of time.

859
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:08,860
And so you basically have Wi-Fi all the time, no matter where you are, if you're underground,

860
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:11,260
up in the mountains, up with the snow monkeys, wherever you are.

861
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:12,260
It was really helpful.

862
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:14,260
My phone was 100% connected all the time.

863
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:16,260
Google Maps, you type in, I'm going here.

864
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:18,260
It'll go, OK, turn left, get on this train.

865
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:19,060
You're going to take it three stops.

866
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:20,060
You're going to get off here.

867
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:23,260
It's a must for like, you know, dumb Americans.

868
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:24,860
OK, good to know.

869
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:27,860
So I and everyone's again, we're privileged.

870
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:29,860
So everyone does speak English pretty much.

871
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:31,860
And that was true in Tokyo.

872
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:34,060
And in the Netherlands.

873
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:39,260
But you get off a train and then you walk down and you go up and you say, I want to go to Efteling.

874
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:41,860
And they'll go, OK, you get on this bus.

875
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:42,860
And you do.

876
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:45,460
But, you know, if you miss them, you have to wait.

877
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:48,260
And then if you can't find the stop and you miss it and blah, blah, blah.

878
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:50,260
And then they drop you off at a certain location.

879
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:51,060
And it might not be.

880
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:53,860
We were staying at the hotel at Efteling and we had missed that stop.

881
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:56,660
So we had to carry our luggage through the entire park.

882
00:37:56,660 --> 00:38:00,460
And it's double the size of Disneyland.

883
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:05,260
And then we're like schlepping luggage through the park, you know, and then we had to go back to the front to start over.

884
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:07,760
Like my feet were so sore that day.

885
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,660
Like you were you walk a lot.

886
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:11,860
Yes, yes. But it's true.

887
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:17,260
But yeah, well, I think we were talking about topics with you and I think Efteling was it was an option.

888
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:20,260
And we were like, I don't think we can do it justice until we go.

889
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:21,460
You have to go. Yeah.

890
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:25,460
And thus we landed on Animal Kingdom, which we've covered.

891
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:29,260
We were talking. We just recently talked about Expedition Everest and realized we have no.

892
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:32,860
Have we not done an animal kingdom ride of any kind?

893
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:39,260
Right. And and here you bring this up as a good chance to talk about the place overall and the broad strokes of it.

894
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:41,260
Why Animal Kingdom? What's the animal kingdom?

895
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:44,160
OK, so I am an animal nut.

896
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:54,560
And I don't get I don't get many interactions with wild animals because I don't believe in a lot of them morally.

897
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,760
I don't like zoos for the most part.

898
00:38:56,760 --> 00:39:01,160
I don't like interactive animal like the fucking porcupine cafes and shit.

899
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:03,560
I'm like, no, let those porcupines go.

900
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:07,360
It's not OK. You're OK with Grandma Sarah's cafe.

901
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:09,560
Grandma's. What's it called?

902
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:17,360
Anti skunkies. Actually, after listening to the episode, I watched a YouTube on it and it does look really cool in there.

903
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:19,760
It's very cute. Which park was that?

904
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:22,460
It's in Disneyland. This is Splash Mountain Restaurant, essentially.

905
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:24,260
Oh, neat. OK, OK.

906
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:32,160
And fun fact about opossums I learned recently, they look scary, but they are unlikely to have rabies because their blood temperature is too low.

907
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:35,260
Good to know. I saw opossum last night going down my street.

908
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:37,060
Yeah, you could have kissed it.

909
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:37,860
You could have been friends with it.

910
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:41,160
You could have kissed it. They might fuck you up, but you won't get to get rabies shot.

911
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:43,460
You could have drank its blood.

912
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:45,060
Yeah, sure could have.

913
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:54,160
So I don't believe in most animal interactivity things, although I will say I did go to the snow monkeys in Japan.

914
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:56,060
If you have time, it's amazing.

915
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:56,860
Really, really?

916
00:39:56,860 --> 00:40:00,060
And then I did go see the swimming pigs in the Bahamas.

917
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:03,260
And it was the best moment of my whole life.

918
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:04,660
I sobbed when I saw them.

919
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:05,760
It was like a big moment.

920
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,960
We got engaged right before that, but it was like beautiful.

921
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:12,460
But I got read to filth over it because vegans love to come for each other.

922
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:18,560
So my wedding was written up in a vegan magazine and I got like, I can't believe you did that.

923
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:24,960
And then I was just like, oh, it's like there's so many levels to people's beliefs and things.

924
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:30,460
And part of me was like, oh shit, should I even talk about animal kingdom because there's animals and they're captive?

925
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:32,960
And I'm like, no, you think shit's going to the people.

926
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,760
No, because your degree of followers.

927
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,560
Listen, here's where I'm at now with it.

928
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:37,160
Okay.

929
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:43,160
Our our animals, especially the animals in Africa are being hunted and killed.

930
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:45,960
Most of them are on endangered species list.

931
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,360
Disney treats them well.

932
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:52,260
I've done tons of research, which we'll talk about when we get to the they treat them well.

933
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:53,160
They're breeding there.

934
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:54,460
They're keeping them safe.

935
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:59,560
Is there, you know, an aspect to it of like people driving cars past these animals?

936
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:00,360
Sure.

937
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:10,960
But at this point, I'd rather these animals be safe and alive and healthy and monitored than being free and shot and killed, you know,

938
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:11,260
right?

939
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:11,460
Yeah.

940
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:12,060
Sure.

941
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:15,060
May have saved the white rhino population.

942
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:15,960
Exactly.

943
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:16,460
Yeah.

944
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:18,660
So, you know, it is what it is.

945
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:29,360
I think I don't go to zoos typically because like animals on like big fake fiberglass rocks make me sad, but they brought in so many species of plants.

946
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,560
It's all real grass.

947
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:33,060
You know, we'll talk about it when we get to that part.

948
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:35,360
But I'm going to give it a pass.

949
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:38,560
And if you want to if you want to come for me, go ahead.

950
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:39,960
But you heard it.

951
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:41,160
You heard her vegan.

952
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:41,560
Yeah.

953
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:43,360
Bring it on.

954
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:49,260
Could you imagine this is what you get canceled for Jackie going on a theme park podcast?

955
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:51,160
Our first guest got canceled.

956
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:55,160
I would be honored to be the first cancel guest.

957
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:56,960
We'll see how far I go.

958
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:00,560
Well, if Bugsy didn't get canceled, you're probably fine.

959
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:01,460
Well, he's dead.

960
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:02,260
He's a skeleton.

961
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:04,060
He was canceled by being alive.

962
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:04,760
Yeah.

963
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:05,660
Yeah, that's the thing.

964
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:10,160
I was like in thinking about this park as a whole.

965
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:15,960
I remember that it was I think people like Pito was upset when it opened and there was that general concern.

966
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:17,760
I like you and you'll see it on a list.

967
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:20,960
You'll see animal Kingdom on lists of controversial things.

968
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:23,660
Disney has done to have animals in captivity.

969
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:32,060
But if you unless they're doing a good job covering it up or something, it's not like there are tons of stories of awful things happening to animals.

970
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:36,660
I do think that they are kept up well from my mildest of research.

971
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:38,260
It seems like you've done more potentially.

972
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:38,960
So that's good.

973
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:43,760
I wanted to make sure again, like I won't do dolphin swimming.

974
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,860
It's I think it's so wrong.

975
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:49,260
Dolphins sonar goes off like crazy.

976
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:51,060
They shouldn't be in confined areas.

977
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:52,860
Like I think it's torture for them.

978
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:56,760
If you go on vacation in your hotels, like let's rank dolphins.

979
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:58,660
I'm sure I would literally weep with joy.

980
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:01,260
I mean, imagine how amazing it would be with that poor animal.

981
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:03,760
You know, I have a lot of issues with things.

982
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:05,660
I don't even think dog breeding should be legal.

983
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:08,660
I think it's fucked up to make dogs have babies and then sell them.

984
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:09,860
I think that's fucked, you know.

985
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:10,860
Yeah.

986
00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:14,060
But did I go on Disney's Safari?

987
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:14,460
Yes.

988
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:15,860
Amazing.

989
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:16,460
Yes.

990
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:17,060
Okay.

991
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:18,260
You know what?

992
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:19,460
This is what it is.

993
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:20,060
Okay.

994
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:21,460
Do your research.

995
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:30,560
The Kilimanjaro Safari is what you're talking about, which I went I hadn't been on it in years and then we went on a couple years ago and I was like, are they allowed to get this close to us?

996
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:32,660
Like I mean, isn't it crazy?

997
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:33,660
It's crazy.

998
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:38,160
It truly is like a real African Safari, but in Florida.

999
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:38,760
Yes.

1000
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:38,960
Yeah.

1001
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:42,760
And I've always wanted to do a Safari, but they're so expensive.

1002
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:43,560
How much are they?

1003
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:45,860
I mean, tens of thousands of dollars.

1004
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:46,260
Okay.

1005
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:47,860
And again, you have to be safe.

1006
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:50,660
There's a lot going on in certain territories and things.

1007
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:54,560
I'm sure you could probably get a cheaper one, but because I used to be a dog walker.

1008
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,060
We kind of talked about this when I got here.

1009
00:43:56,160 --> 00:44:05,060
I had a client who's like very wealthy and they went on one and it looked like just the most amazing like but it was how much who knows, you know, for some comfort.

1010
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:08,560
I'd imagine you're paying a lot of money and you're popping those pills.

1011
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:10,060
You're worried about malaria.

1012
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:11,060
There's a lot going on.

1013
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:11,660
Yeah.

1014
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:13,160
No malaria in Florida, baby.

1015
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:14,860
Orlando is fine.

1016
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:15,760
It's safe.

1017
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:16,260
Yeah.

1018
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:18,860
Which does just a brain eating parasites.

1019
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:20,260
Yeah.

1020
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:21,260
And sinkholes.

1021
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:22,060
There's stuff to worry about.

1022
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:22,560
Holes.

1023
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:22,960
Yes.

1024
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:23,460
The sinkhole.

1025
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:30,860
There's a spot by the Magic Kingdom where they can't build a hotel because they kept sending beams down to test and the beams wouldn't come back.

1026
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:35,560
And spit up like in the middle of Epcot one day.

1027
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:41,160
The beam, the beam shooting through the air beam Kano.

1028
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:41,760
Yeah.

1029
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:43,360
So it's a yeah.

1030
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:44,960
Say where is the animal and it does well.

1031
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:50,160
So so on the Safari thing, this is pretty like animal Kingdom basics, I guess.

1032
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:58,060
But if you're listening and you're not a super nerd, the whole thing about this ride, you see this wide variety of animals and they get very close to you.

1033
00:44:58,060 --> 00:44:59,760
You're like, how are they?

1034
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:01,960
Could they just lunge?

1035
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:05,960
But there are there are natural barricades set up.

1036
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:15,560
They designed this area so that this moat is here or this little like stopping mechanism is on the ground, but the guests can't see it.

1037
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:21,260
So actually you are safe at all times, but in a way that is not cage oriented.

1038
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:25,760
And it's this is something Disney has pioneered and that I think other I'm not totally sure.

1039
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:29,560
I think other like zoos or nature parks have started to do it.

1040
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:29,860
Right.

1041
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:39,660
Isn't like like, yeah, huge leap forward in this industry to actually plan things in a smart way and not just like, yeah, it's a bunch of fences.

1042
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:41,360
It'll electrocute them if they touch it.

1043
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:48,560
There was also concern like how would they, especially for the safaris, get the animals to come towards the people?

1044
00:45:48,560 --> 00:46:11,160
And like they figured out tricks like, well, if you put the tree that has the draft favorite kind of leaf on it that is like candy to them and you put that on a lazy Susan and you rotate it towards like where the path is, they will come towards the the tree and the guests.

1045
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:14,060
It's really, they really thought a lot about that.

1046
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:20,160
Cause how do you remember when you were little and you went to the zoo and like you'd be like, oh, that's supposed to be a hippo, but you couldn't see shit.

1047
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:20,560
Yeah.

1048
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:21,860
It's like they thought about all that.

1049
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:26,160
There's like hidden food troughs, hidden water things that will make them come closer.

1050
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:27,860
And it's crazy how close they come.

1051
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:28,960
Yeah, they get very close.

1052
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:34,760
The only thing that's bad, I feel like, is they say don't like yell at the animal and everyone does.

1053
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:35,360
Yeah.

1054
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:35,760
Right.

1055
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:36,760
Both times I've been on it.

1056
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:39,360
It's like, don't I feel like I can't even yell.

1057
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:43,960
It's not taking pictures because I don't think that would bother, but it's like, don't call them to the car.

1058
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:47,760
They tell you at a certain point to like lower your voice and not say anything and stuff like that.

1059
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:51,160
But then there's like a giant heavy vehicle, you know, going through.

1060
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:55,660
Well, you had like one of the person, cause there's also about this thing, the Kilimanjaro Safari.

1061
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:58,160
It's the most impressive job.

1062
00:46:58,160 --> 00:46:59,560
Like to do it.

1063
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:03,460
I'm so blown away by the people who do it, who have to do the announcing.

1064
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:07,560
Like it's like the jungle cruise, but they're driving a real car through rough terrain.

1065
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:08,260
Right.

1066
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:13,060
Which I just learned is like a giant flatbed truck that they modified.

1067
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:18,860
So it's like a, it's a difficult vehicle to operate and they're telling you the plot and everything too.

1068
00:47:18,860 --> 00:47:19,660
They're telling you everything.

1069
00:47:19,660 --> 00:47:20,860
They're asking questions.

1070
00:47:20,860 --> 00:47:23,960
They're like putting the car in different gears.

1071
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:29,260
They're waiting for other cars because maybe there's an animal on the track essentially and they have to wait.

1072
00:47:29,460 --> 00:47:32,160
They're doing so much and it's seamless.

1073
00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:32,560
Yeah.

1074
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:34,260
And you're like, whoa, what a skill you have.

1075
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:35,760
I wonder what training was involved.

1076
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:38,460
I mean how long they had to train to get that job.

1077
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:42,560
It has to be the most impressive of all, like the ride operator job.

1078
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:42,760
Yeah.

1079
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:49,360
And when the ride first opened, there was like a storyline that there were poachers, which makes a lot less sense.

1080
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:50,160
I don't like that.

1081
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:50,360
Yeah.

1082
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:52,860
That you were like, you had to chase the poachers.

1083
00:47:52,860 --> 00:47:55,360
You were like, we got to stop these poachers.

1084
00:47:55,860 --> 00:48:01,360
Oh, now see I've only, I did it with that overlay and I don't think I knew it's not there.

1085
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:03,060
I think that element of it is gone.

1086
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:14,160
So I might like it more now because I found that unpleasant and literally all I can remember about it are terrible tinny sound effects in that Jeep of like poachers like coming in on the radio.

1087
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:16,560
Am I remembering this correctly?

1088
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:20,860
Like that they catch the signal and like, yeah, there's some crackly.

1089
00:48:20,860 --> 00:48:21,460
Where did I get them?

1090
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:23,660
Watch out tigers.

1091
00:48:23,660 --> 00:48:29,860
I think you also are likely to see more animals now, especially because like that park is open later.

1092
00:48:29,860 --> 00:48:31,260
Now that was a big thing.

1093
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:34,460
Like noise is a big concern with all these animals.

1094
00:48:34,460 --> 00:48:38,060
Animal Kingdom used to close much earlier than the other parks.

1095
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:47,060
Once they got the Pandora World of Avatar in there though, I think they realized like, well, we need to keep this park open a little later.

1096
00:48:47,060 --> 00:48:48,260
For the bioluminescence.

1097
00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:49,460
For the bioluminescence.

1098
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:52,260
And then they added the Rivers of Light nighttime show.

1099
00:48:52,460 --> 00:49:05,660
And so and then they started experimenting with like later in the evening safaris with some lighting and like, you know, you get more nocturnal animals out or animals who sleep at the hottest points of the day come out.

1100
00:49:05,660 --> 00:49:08,160
So yeah, the parks open.

1101
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:13,460
I checked it was like yesterday or today was open till eight and like every other park was also open till eight.

1102
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:13,860
Okay.

1103
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:14,360
Yeah.

1104
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:16,760
Also like fireworks.

1105
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:23,560
They started doing fireworks in the recent past and people were concerned about is that a problem fireworks near the but apparently they're separate.

1106
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:24,560
They do remain in the animal kingdom?

1107
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:25,560
No.

1108
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:26,760
No, I don't like that.

1109
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:33,960
I think they did like a new they got in some they got checked on because there was a New Year's Eve fireworks.

1110
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:37,560
But like the Rivers of Light nighttime show has like no fireworks.

1111
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:38,560
They don't have a regular fireworks thing.

1112
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:40,560
But they have a church in front now of the tree of life.

1113
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:42,060
I'm fucking done with fireworks.

1114
00:49:42,060 --> 00:49:43,660
I don't think so many fireworks.

1115
00:49:43,660 --> 00:49:44,560
I'm fucking done with that.

1116
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:45,060
Wow.

1117
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:46,360
That's been my take.

1118
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:48,860
We had to say controversial opinions a while ago.

1119
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:52,260
Once you've seen one you've seen them all they're loud.

1120
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:52,960
They're pollutant.

1121
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:54,560
They really stress dogs out.

1122
00:49:54,560 --> 00:50:00,960
I mean if anyone's a dog owner and you know a busy area during 4th of July is a fucking nightmare.

1123
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:01,960
That's true.

1124
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:06,260
Let's can we stop with the fucking fireworks or do them like once a damn week or something?

1125
00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:07,060
I don't know.

1126
00:50:07,060 --> 00:50:09,660
There's it's more of a concern for the local area.

1127
00:50:09,660 --> 00:50:11,060
You think I just think they're dumb.

1128
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:16,060
I think they're overrated and I think they're very pollutant and loud and they stress things out.

1129
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:17,560
They stress out animals.

1130
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:21,360
I think that will I think there'll be a time when they're replaced by drones.

1131
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:23,760
That's what it feels like it's going to happen.

1132
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:30,860
Well, there's a sparkly drones like a hundred and fifty drones that shoot up into the sky and make like design like whatever.

1133
00:50:30,860 --> 00:50:31,760
I would love that.

1134
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:34,160
I mean they're totally like tested it and stuff.

1135
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:35,160
I'm down for that.

1136
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:38,360
Whatever like cool thing design they would make in the sky would be now drones.

1137
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:40,860
But you can't float them over people's heads right now is the problem.

1138
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:54,360
There's speculation and for Anaheim we're going to at least for a little while see less and less fireworks and more and more drones or projection any kind of stuff as they claim backstage buildings for expansion.

1139
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:56,860
Oh, because they used to fire them off from back there.

1140
00:50:56,860 --> 00:51:00,060
But now they'd land on our ashes would land on the galaxy.

1141
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:11,060
Of like a office building or a parking garage and like cast members could like go into their parking garage and be like really close and watch.

1142
00:51:11,060 --> 00:51:22,560
Jesus I hate to be such an aggro dude about this, but I love when I love when the fire shoots up either in World of Color or in the one of the old Disneyland shows.

1143
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:28,060
And it's usually like accompanied by the Star Wars theme and they just shoot flames into the sky.

1144
00:51:28,060 --> 00:51:29,360
I'm like, this is awesome.

1145
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:30,360
Yeah, it is pretty cool.

1146
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:39,860
I was going to say if we are getting to a less fireworks centric time while he's still on this earth, let's allow McCartney to still do it during living.

1147
00:51:39,860 --> 00:51:40,860
Living like that.

1148
00:51:40,860 --> 00:51:45,360
You know, he bless his heart.

1149
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:48,060
We don't have much more Paul McCartney touring most likely.

1150
00:51:48,060 --> 00:51:49,060
So pure math.

1151
00:51:49,060 --> 00:51:51,860
I'm finally going to go for longer than anybody thinks.

1152
00:51:51,860 --> 00:51:54,360
Same, but I'm here for that.

1153
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:56,860
So this is actually the perfect segue.

1154
00:51:56,860 --> 00:52:02,860
Last night, because Scott and I went to see Ringo Starr a couple of years ago and you were there.

1155
00:52:02,860 --> 00:52:05,860
I was very high.

1156
00:52:05,860 --> 00:52:09,360
I was crying laughing.

1157
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:10,360
Y'all were so funny.

1158
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:11,360
I just don't remember.

1159
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:12,860
It was such a beautiful night.

1160
00:52:12,860 --> 00:52:18,360
Y'all were wearing your little Hawaii shirts, you know, Margaritaville.

1161
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:21,360
I was laughing my ass off.

1162
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:22,360
At Ringo Starr?

1163
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:24,860
Them two, it's Scott and Mike.

1164
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:27,860
I don't think we were wearing Hawaiian shirts in Ringo.

1165
00:52:27,860 --> 00:52:29,860
No, you were in my mind, okay?

1166
00:52:29,860 --> 00:52:30,860
Don't ruin this for me.

1167
00:52:30,860 --> 00:52:31,860
I think you might be remembering.

1168
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:32,860
You were!

1169
00:52:32,860 --> 00:52:35,360
Don't you think Scott, you were in some kind of Hawaiian shirt?

1170
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:36,360
Very possibly.

1171
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:37,360
I have a photo somewhere.

1172
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:38,360
I'll pull it out.

1173
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:45,860
I was probably, you know, yeah, hey, I was probably something sort of like 60s psychedelic-y or something.

1174
00:52:45,860 --> 00:52:46,860
It was really fun.

1175
00:52:46,860 --> 00:52:52,860
So I looked last night and I was like, are there any instances of Beatles at Disneyland, specifically Ringo?

1176
00:52:52,860 --> 00:52:55,860
We have a rare case of visual aids on the television.

1177
00:52:55,860 --> 00:53:01,860
I found a blog, we'll post this, of all Beatles and Disney related photos.

1178
00:53:01,860 --> 00:53:02,860
Oh wow.

1179
00:53:02,860 --> 00:53:03,860
Good for them.

1180
00:53:03,860 --> 00:53:04,860
What's the blog?

1181
00:53:04,860 --> 00:53:07,860
Disneybeetles.tumblr.com.

1182
00:53:07,860 --> 00:53:08,860
Wow.

1183
00:53:08,860 --> 00:53:11,860
And there's some, nothing amazing, but some pretty cool.

1184
00:53:11,860 --> 00:53:13,860
So here's John.

1185
00:53:13,860 --> 00:53:14,860
Yes.

1186
00:53:14,860 --> 00:53:16,860
John wore a Mickey Mouse shirt.

1187
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:17,860
Yeah, pretty classically.

1188
00:53:17,860 --> 00:53:21,860
And John also dissolved the Beatles officially at Walt Disney World.

1189
00:53:21,860 --> 00:53:22,860
At the Polynesian.

1190
00:53:22,860 --> 00:53:23,860
Oh my God.

1191
00:53:23,860 --> 00:53:25,860
He signed the papers saying Christmas over.

1192
00:53:25,860 --> 00:53:26,860
I didn't know that.

1193
00:53:26,860 --> 00:53:27,860
At the, yeah.

1194
00:53:27,860 --> 00:53:32,860
Well wait, now I heard the other rumor that the papers were delivered but there was a

1195
00:53:32,860 --> 00:53:36,860
problem, so it was signed in another location in Florida.

1196
00:53:36,860 --> 00:53:37,860
Oh, not at Disney World?

1197
00:53:37,860 --> 00:53:40,860
Yeah, not at Disney World, but he was at the Polynesian.

1198
00:53:40,860 --> 00:53:43,860
But there's a picture, one or two pictures go around, it's like here he is at the Polynesian

1199
00:53:43,860 --> 00:53:44,860
and it's a different Florida.

1200
00:53:44,860 --> 00:53:46,860
John dropped the pen and thus the papers had to be signed elsewhere.

1201
00:53:46,860 --> 00:53:48,860
I don't know why I'm debunking everything today.

1202
00:53:48,860 --> 00:53:49,860
That's okay.

1203
00:53:49,860 --> 00:53:50,860
That's okay.

1204
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:51,860
Jason, you're in house every day.

1205
00:53:51,860 --> 00:53:52,860
This is honor.

1206
00:53:52,860 --> 00:53:53,860
Jason ruins everything.

1207
00:53:53,860 --> 00:53:54,860
I spent like half a day.

1208
00:53:54,860 --> 00:53:59,860
I gotta grow my hair out, I'm gonna do that.

1209
00:53:59,860 --> 00:54:01,860
I gotta give you the hair left.

1210
00:54:01,860 --> 00:54:03,860
Yeah, I spent like half a day reading about the-

1211
00:54:03,860 --> 00:54:05,860
That's the contemporary there.

1212
00:54:05,860 --> 00:54:06,860
Yeah.

1213
00:54:06,860 --> 00:54:07,860
Oh, the contemporary behind John Lennon.

1214
00:54:07,860 --> 00:54:08,860
There's a couple-

1215
00:54:08,860 --> 00:54:09,860
Grace.

1216
00:54:09,860 --> 00:54:12,860
John is at Disneyland, here, with a monorail driver, 1974.

1217
00:54:12,860 --> 00:54:16,860
It's really funny that John Lennon went to Disney World.

1218
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:18,860
And there's the Eton Square.

1219
00:54:18,860 --> 00:54:21,860
He's at Disneyland too in these photos too, so like he must have kind of liked it.

1220
00:54:21,860 --> 00:54:23,860
John stayed at the Polynesian.

1221
00:54:23,860 --> 00:54:25,860
Here is Paul, 2009.

1222
00:54:25,860 --> 00:54:26,860
With his younger-

1223
00:54:26,860 --> 00:54:27,860
On the Autopia?

1224
00:54:27,860 --> 00:54:30,860
Yeah, on the Autopia with his young daughter.

1225
00:54:30,860 --> 00:54:31,860
Wow, cool.

1226
00:54:31,860 --> 00:54:33,860
Do we know for sure that's Paul McCartney?

1227
00:54:33,860 --> 00:54:34,860
I mean that could-

1228
00:54:34,860 --> 00:54:35,860
Yeah, look at the mouth.

1229
00:54:35,860 --> 00:54:38,860
You think he was singing his famous song, Red Rose Speedway?

1230
00:54:38,860 --> 00:54:39,860
Yeah.

1231
00:54:39,860 --> 00:54:42,860
And not the better car-related song he's written.

1232
00:54:42,860 --> 00:54:44,860
Certainly not Baby You Could Drive My Car.

1233
00:54:44,860 --> 00:54:46,860
No, we all think of Red Rose Speedway.

1234
00:54:46,860 --> 00:54:47,860
Now look at this.

1235
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:52,860
This is Ringo Starr in New Orleans Square with a plaid.

1236
00:54:52,860 --> 00:54:54,860
I mean, is there a greater photo than this?

1237
00:54:54,860 --> 00:54:56,860
He's dead now, hard.

1238
00:54:56,860 --> 00:54:57,860
Yeah, real big hat.

1239
00:54:57,860 --> 00:54:58,860
Thor is dead.

1240
00:54:58,860 --> 00:55:03,860
And they have like Ringo and his children walk around Disneyland in the mid-1970s with their plaid, Linda Allen.

1241
00:55:03,860 --> 00:55:04,860
The plaid is named.

1242
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:05,860
Plaids have names.

1243
00:55:05,860 --> 00:55:06,860
Yeah, look at that.

1244
00:55:06,860 --> 00:55:07,860
Wow.

1245
00:55:07,860 --> 00:55:08,860
This I don't know.

1246
00:55:08,860 --> 00:55:09,860
Linda was lovely.

1247
00:55:09,860 --> 00:55:10,860
She didn't see anything there.

1248
00:55:10,860 --> 00:55:14,860
Oh, that's them in the costumes, like the I Am The Walrus-y shit.

1249
00:55:14,860 --> 00:55:17,860
They're saying that's the Beatles in those outfits, but who knows?

1250
00:55:17,860 --> 00:55:21,860
Then there's Muppets, and that's cool, but that's not what they should have this on here.

1251
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:24,860
Sean Lennon just has a Disney shirt on.

1252
00:55:24,860 --> 00:55:25,860
That's cute.

1253
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:28,860
I love the idea, because I love niche Tumblrs.

1254
00:55:28,860 --> 00:55:31,860
Like celebrities in Disney shirts, I think that's a fun Tumblr.

1255
00:55:31,860 --> 00:55:32,860
Yeah, yeah.

1256
00:55:32,860 --> 00:55:36,860
Look at Ringo eating a popsicle or an ice cream at Disneyland.

1257
00:55:38,860 --> 00:55:40,860
That combines all of our interests.

1258
00:55:40,860 --> 00:55:41,860
It sure does.

1259
00:55:41,860 --> 00:55:44,860
That photo is the nexus of Scott Mike and Jason.

1260
00:55:44,860 --> 00:55:46,860
There's not too much more on here.

1261
00:55:46,860 --> 00:55:48,860
You went right past Winnie the Pooh recreating Abbey Road.

1262
00:55:48,860 --> 00:55:50,860
Yeah, but that doesn't do much for me.

1263
00:55:50,860 --> 00:55:51,860
There's some cartoons here.

1264
00:55:51,860 --> 00:55:53,860
You're looking for authentic Beatles content.

1265
00:55:53,860 --> 00:55:54,860
How about this?

1266
00:55:54,860 --> 00:55:59,860
Paul in a Grandma Mickey sweatshirt with some sort of chalice.

1267
00:55:59,860 --> 00:56:00,860
Wow.

1268
00:56:00,860 --> 00:56:04,860
Yes, I think probably we all have grandmas dressing similar to that.

1269
00:56:04,860 --> 00:56:05,860
That shirt is sick.

1270
00:56:05,860 --> 00:56:08,860
The collar is the grandma thing, especially about it.

1271
00:56:08,860 --> 00:56:10,860
This is from like 80, I think it says.

1272
00:56:10,860 --> 00:56:14,860
Do y'all ever go to those Disney after dark special nights or whatever?

1273
00:56:14,860 --> 00:56:16,860
I'm going to 90s night next month.

1274
00:56:16,860 --> 00:56:17,860
Oh, you are.

1275
00:56:17,860 --> 00:56:18,860
I'm so excited.

1276
00:56:18,860 --> 00:56:19,860
You'll have to report back.

1277
00:56:19,860 --> 00:56:26,860
Speaking of celebrities in Mickey clothes, I got this sick Mickey sweatshirt at a thrift store.

1278
00:56:26,860 --> 00:56:29,860
When I was buying it, the woman goes, you know who used to wear this sweatshirt?

1279
00:56:29,860 --> 00:56:31,860
Not the same exact one, maybe.

1280
00:56:31,860 --> 00:56:33,860
But Princess Diana.

1281
00:56:33,860 --> 00:56:34,860
There's a photo of Princess Diana.

1282
00:56:34,860 --> 00:56:39,860
If you Google Princess Diana Mickey sweatshirt, she's in this white sweatshirt and I have the same one.

1283
00:56:39,860 --> 00:56:40,860
And I'm wearing it.

1284
00:56:40,860 --> 00:56:41,860
Disney's 90 night baby.

1285
00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:42,860
That's great.

1286
00:56:42,860 --> 00:56:43,860
Wow.

1287
00:56:43,860 --> 00:56:47,860
Throwback to the reign of Princess Diana.

1288
00:56:47,860 --> 00:56:48,860
That's right.

1289
00:56:48,860 --> 00:56:54,860
So there's Paul with little Farrouza Balk on the set of Return to Oz.

1290
00:56:54,860 --> 00:56:55,860
Wow.

1291
00:56:55,860 --> 00:56:57,860
Paul was on the set of Return to Oz.

1292
00:56:57,860 --> 00:56:58,860
I don't know what the hell that's all about.

1293
00:56:58,860 --> 00:56:59,860
Strange.

1294
00:56:59,860 --> 00:57:00,860
Yeah.

1295
00:57:00,860 --> 00:57:02,860
And we all know Paul was on the set of Pirates 4.

1296
00:57:02,860 --> 00:57:03,860
There it is.

1297
00:57:03,860 --> 00:57:04,860
There's the people's princess.

1298
00:57:04,860 --> 00:57:07,860
If you Google Princess Diana Mickey, the picture comes up.

1299
00:57:07,860 --> 00:57:08,860
No kidding.

1300
00:57:08,860 --> 00:57:09,860
Right here.

1301
00:57:09,860 --> 00:57:10,860
Cool.

1302
00:57:10,860 --> 00:57:15,860
She has, I think that's Harry on her back and he's wearing a Mickey sweatshirt as well.

1303
00:57:15,860 --> 00:57:16,860
Do we think that's at a park?

1304
00:57:16,860 --> 00:57:17,860
No, maybe not.

1305
00:57:17,860 --> 00:57:20,860
I don't think this is, but there are photos of her at Disney World also.

1306
00:57:20,860 --> 00:57:21,860
Wow.

1307
00:57:21,860 --> 00:57:25,860
Here, we'll throw this to the audience too.

1308
00:57:25,860 --> 00:57:31,860
If you know, send us your favorite photos of your favorite or least favorite stars wearing

1309
00:57:31,860 --> 00:57:32,860
Disney sweaters.

1310
00:57:32,860 --> 00:57:33,860
What's that?

1311
00:57:33,860 --> 00:57:34,860
Sweaters.

1312
00:57:34,860 --> 00:57:36,860
I'm into sweaters almost more than anything.

1313
00:57:36,860 --> 00:57:38,860
Have y'all seen celebrities at Disney?

1314
00:57:38,860 --> 00:57:41,860
Like with their guides?

1315
00:57:41,860 --> 00:57:42,860
Here and there.

1316
00:57:42,860 --> 00:57:45,860
Do you ever find out that you were there the same day when you, like I was just, I saw

1317
00:57:45,860 --> 00:57:48,860
Mark Hoppus was there the same day as me and I was like, oh man.

1318
00:57:48,860 --> 00:57:49,860
I didn't say hi.

1319
00:57:49,860 --> 00:57:52,860
Because you went to a Blink in Vegas, right?

1320
00:57:52,860 --> 00:57:53,860
Yeah.

1321
00:57:53,860 --> 00:57:54,860
You're like a Blink diehard?

1322
00:57:54,860 --> 00:57:55,860
Yeah.

1323
00:57:55,860 --> 00:57:59,860
I'm going again and they're doing like this back to the beach fest or something in Huntington

1324
00:57:59,860 --> 00:58:01,860
Beach in April, May.

1325
00:58:01,860 --> 00:58:02,860
I'm going again.

1326
00:58:02,860 --> 00:58:05,860
I gotta get my Blink fix.

1327
00:58:05,860 --> 00:58:06,860
You know what's my favorite?

1328
00:58:06,860 --> 00:58:12,860
I forget if I've said this on the podcast before that the, I have a hazy memory of that

1329
00:58:12,860 --> 00:58:19,860
I may have as a child been going, been in line for the teacups and that into the booth

1330
00:58:19,860 --> 00:58:21,860
the announcements are made on the teacups.

1331
00:58:21,860 --> 00:58:28,860
I think maybe Tim Allen got on and made the teacup announcement because I think it ended,

1332
00:58:28,860 --> 00:58:33,860
I think it was, it was kind of confusing what was going on, but I think it's possible that

1333
00:58:33,860 --> 00:58:36,860
he, an announcement was made and then he did, ha ha ha.

1334
00:58:36,860 --> 00:58:41,860
And the, and people in line went, oh, but maybe I just didn't understand what the hell

1335
00:58:41,860 --> 00:58:42,860
was going on.

1336
00:58:42,860 --> 00:58:43,860
Yeah.

1337
00:58:43,860 --> 00:58:44,860
Yeah.

1338
00:58:44,860 --> 00:58:47,860
If anyone can vouch for Tim Allen's whereabouts throughout the nineties.

1339
00:58:47,860 --> 00:58:48,860
They would have probably had to pay him for that.

1340
00:58:48,860 --> 00:58:49,860
You know what I mean?

1341
00:58:49,860 --> 00:58:52,860
If I were him, I wouldn't give them my voice for free.

1342
00:58:52,860 --> 00:58:53,860
Oh, yeah.

1343
00:58:53,860 --> 00:58:56,860
I mean, Disney's paid him quite a bit of money.

1344
00:58:56,860 --> 00:58:57,860
Yeah.

1345
00:58:57,860 --> 00:58:59,860
But maybe he's, I don't know, maybe he was in a good mood on a vacation.

1346
00:58:59,860 --> 00:59:03,860
Maybe he was tripping and feeling like giving it out for free.

1347
00:59:03,860 --> 00:59:06,860
Do you think there's so many celebrity voices at Disneyland?

1348
00:59:06,860 --> 00:59:08,860
Like the monorail, isn't that Billy West?

1349
00:59:08,860 --> 00:59:09,860
Is that Billy West?

1350
00:59:09,860 --> 00:59:10,860
No, I don't think so.

1351
00:59:10,860 --> 00:59:13,860
Is it somebody doing a Billy West impression then?

1352
00:59:13,860 --> 00:59:15,860
It's a similar, I hear what you're saying.

1353
00:59:15,860 --> 00:59:16,860
Yeah, it's similar.

1354
00:59:16,860 --> 00:59:18,860
But then they have like some of those people.

1355
00:59:18,860 --> 00:59:20,860
Like Neil Patrick Harris does one, right?

1356
00:59:20,860 --> 00:59:21,860
Well, he's gone now.

1357
00:59:21,860 --> 00:59:23,860
He was the running coaster.

1358
00:59:23,860 --> 00:59:24,860
Credit coaster.

1359
00:59:24,860 --> 00:59:25,860
In credit coaster.

1360
00:59:25,860 --> 00:59:26,860
So he's been replaced.

1361
00:59:26,860 --> 00:59:28,860
But yeah, there's like little things.

1362
00:59:28,860 --> 00:59:31,860
A lot of those people don't get any much money for it because like people in the video, like

1363
00:59:31,860 --> 00:59:33,860
Patrick Warburton is in two different rides.

1364
00:59:33,860 --> 00:59:36,860
He's on Soarin' and he's on Star Tours.

1365
00:59:36,860 --> 00:59:37,860
Is he on a third one?

1366
00:59:37,860 --> 00:59:38,860
Am I misremembering?

1367
00:59:38,860 --> 00:59:39,860
I don't believe so.

1368
00:59:39,860 --> 00:59:40,860
Okay.

1369
00:59:40,860 --> 00:59:41,860
Yeah.

1370
00:59:41,860 --> 00:59:43,860
So like there's, yeah, there are like a lot of things.

1371
00:59:43,860 --> 00:59:47,860
I didn't realize it was Neil Patrick Harris until I think a year ago or something.

1372
00:59:47,860 --> 00:59:49,860
He was like five, four, three, two, one.

1373
00:59:49,860 --> 00:59:50,860
But were I?

1374
00:59:50,860 --> 00:59:54,860
He probably just did that on his damn iPhone in his bathroom and got a million dollars.

1375
00:59:54,860 --> 00:59:55,860
Possibly.

1376
00:59:55,860 --> 01:00:00,860
The final picture though, real quick, is Julian Lennon, which is the greatest photo with Space

1377
01:00:00,860 --> 01:00:01,860
Mickey.

1378
01:00:01,860 --> 01:00:05,860
Space Epcot Mickey at Epcot Center with Spaceship Earth in the back.

1379
01:00:05,860 --> 01:00:06,860
Wow.

1380
01:00:06,860 --> 01:00:07,860
Looking just like his father.

1381
01:00:07,860 --> 01:00:10,860
Yeah, I mean I probably wouldn't have even known that wasn't him if you had to say.

1382
01:00:10,860 --> 01:00:11,860
So we'll post a link to this.

1383
01:00:11,860 --> 01:00:14,860
Follow along with this Tumblr.

1384
01:00:14,860 --> 01:00:20,860
Before it gets taken down for whatever Tumblr rules that take down everything now.

1385
01:00:20,860 --> 01:00:24,860
Disney sues him and every beetle widow sues them.

1386
01:00:24,860 --> 01:00:25,860
Yeah.

1387
01:00:25,860 --> 01:00:26,860
It's sued into the ground.

1388
01:00:26,860 --> 01:00:27,860
Yeah.

1389
01:00:27,860 --> 01:00:28,860
Animal Kingdom.

1390
01:00:28,860 --> 01:00:29,860
Let's get back on track.

1391
01:00:29,860 --> 01:00:30,860
Yes.

1392
01:00:30,860 --> 01:00:37,860
Kilimanjaro Safari, as we talked about, which by the way, I didn't know this fact that that

1393
01:00:37,860 --> 01:00:40,860
ride is bigger than the Magic Kingdom.

1394
01:00:40,860 --> 01:00:41,860
The square foot.

1395
01:00:41,860 --> 01:00:42,860
Oh wow, I didn't know that either.

1396
01:00:42,860 --> 01:00:44,860
Because the track is like two miles.

1397
01:00:44,860 --> 01:00:47,860
The largest attraction in any Disney theme park.

1398
01:00:47,860 --> 01:00:48,860
Wow.

1399
01:00:48,860 --> 01:00:49,860
No kidding.

1400
01:00:49,860 --> 01:00:50,860
Yeah.

1401
01:00:50,860 --> 01:00:54,860
And there's a cool video of what you were saying, Mike, of the cars getting stopped

1402
01:00:54,860 --> 01:00:58,860
and where is all of them and it's all along a track and there's little light up dots and

1403
01:00:58,860 --> 01:01:04,860
somebody's nervously monitoring at a computer and seeing where the Jeeps are and it is exactly

1404
01:01:04,860 --> 01:01:05,860
Jurassic Park.

1405
01:01:05,860 --> 01:01:10,860
It is so excitingly a Samuel L. Jackson scenario.

1406
01:01:10,860 --> 01:01:12,860
So you get if you want to be a real life.

1407
01:01:12,860 --> 01:01:13,860
What's his name?

1408
01:01:13,860 --> 01:01:15,860
We I know Nedry, but what's Sam?

1409
01:01:15,860 --> 01:01:17,860
I can never remember his name.

1410
01:01:17,860 --> 01:01:20,860
If you want to be a hold on to your butts, man, get that job.

1411
01:01:20,860 --> 01:01:24,860
Be the Jeep monitor at Kilimanjaro Safari's.

1412
01:01:24,860 --> 01:01:28,860
But yeah, I why would this ride another go?

1413
01:01:28,860 --> 01:01:33,860
Because I did it in this unpleasant poacher era in which there was a fake dead elephant.

1414
01:01:33,860 --> 01:01:36,860
No, yeah, I think that's got to be going.

1415
01:01:36,860 --> 01:01:37,860
It's upset.

1416
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:42,860
But at the same time, this is the reality and people need to know.

1417
01:01:42,860 --> 01:01:45,860
And I'm like a dark kind of because they brought that up on mine.

1418
01:01:45,860 --> 01:01:47,860
At one point they were like, this is the white rhino.

1419
01:01:47,860 --> 01:01:52,860
They're almost extinct, you know, and then they even said, which it pissed me off so bad.

1420
01:01:52,860 --> 01:01:55,860
There were elephants in there to have the African elephants in there and dangers.

1421
01:01:55,860 --> 01:01:59,860
And they were like, if you really want to help the elephants recycle your electronics.

1422
01:01:59,860 --> 01:02:03,860
And I was like, if you really want to help the animals, don't eat them.

1423
01:02:03,860 --> 01:02:05,860
I mean, that's all there is to it.

1424
01:02:05,860 --> 01:02:13,860
The more our society normalizes animal cruelty, the more people are going to hunt them, eat them, kill them and mistreat them.

1425
01:02:13,860 --> 01:02:14,860
And that's just the bottom line.

1426
01:02:14,860 --> 01:02:17,860
And that's like my angry veganism.

1427
01:02:17,860 --> 01:02:23,860
You get off this ride where you're like literally looking at these beautiful animals and they're like, have your turkey leg.

1428
01:02:23,860 --> 01:02:26,860
Have your fucking burger.

1429
01:02:26,860 --> 01:02:27,860
You have flame.

1430
01:02:27,860 --> 01:02:29,860
Look at the animals, eat the animals.

1431
01:02:29,860 --> 01:02:30,860
This one's OK.

1432
01:02:30,860 --> 01:02:32,860
This one is it.

1433
01:02:32,860 --> 01:02:33,860
I hate it.

1434
01:02:33,860 --> 01:02:39,860
Reading about the restaurants, I'm like for a park called Animal Kingdom, all the best reviews restaurants are barbecue locations.

1435
01:02:39,860 --> 01:02:41,860
They're like, it's just it doesn't.

1436
01:02:41,860 --> 01:02:44,860
Once you see that and you're like, yeah, this is fucked up.

1437
01:02:44,860 --> 01:02:46,860
You can't unsee it as a person.

1438
01:02:46,860 --> 01:02:49,860
And that's just another hypocrisy of our society.

1439
01:02:49,860 --> 01:02:52,860
Sure. So while you like this park, it is a park of hypocrisy.

1440
01:02:52,860 --> 01:02:53,860
Well, they all are.

1441
01:02:53,860 --> 01:02:55,860
I mean, there's no such thing as a vegan park.

1442
01:02:55,860 --> 01:02:58,860
They do have more options of food.

1443
01:02:58,860 --> 01:03:04,860
You know, friggin California Adventure is like vegan out.

1444
01:03:04,860 --> 01:03:13,860
You can eat vegan good food there, not just like fries, which, oh my God, Tokyo, Japan starved my ass off.

1445
01:03:13,860 --> 01:03:15,860
My wife's in trouble. My wife's vegetarian.

1446
01:03:15,860 --> 01:03:16,860
She's in trouble.

1447
01:03:16,860 --> 01:03:18,860
I starved through Japan.

1448
01:03:18,860 --> 01:03:19,860
Any advice?

1449
01:03:19,860 --> 01:03:20,860
Anything we wouldn't know?

1450
01:03:20,860 --> 01:03:22,860
I mean, I have lots of I did a whole map.

1451
01:03:22,860 --> 01:03:23,860
I did a whole map.

1452
01:03:23,860 --> 01:03:25,860
Again, the Google Maps, I can say to y'all.

1453
01:03:25,860 --> 01:03:28,860
But did you were you like we're just thinking granola bars.

1454
01:03:28,860 --> 01:03:29,860
Let's just load up.

1455
01:03:29,860 --> 01:03:30,860
But you're used to it.

1456
01:03:30,860 --> 01:03:32,860
You know, I'm used to it.

1457
01:03:32,860 --> 01:03:35,860
Like I said, food isn't a big part of the tourist experience for me.

1458
01:03:35,860 --> 01:03:37,860
Unfortunately, it's just how it is.

1459
01:03:37,860 --> 01:03:39,860
But it's really difficult.

1460
01:03:39,860 --> 01:03:40,860
We're very privileged in L.A.

1461
01:03:40,860 --> 01:03:42,860
I forget like that.

1462
01:03:42,860 --> 01:03:44,860
And then I go somewhere else and I'm like, oh, I don't have rice.

1463
01:03:44,860 --> 01:03:47,860
Oh, the rice has been, you know, beef stock.

1464
01:03:47,860 --> 01:03:49,860
Cool. I will eat this pickle.

1465
01:03:50,860 --> 01:03:52,860
I'll eat a pickle and die.

1466
01:03:52,860 --> 01:03:54,860
It's boiled in beef brine.

1467
01:03:54,860 --> 01:03:56,860
I mean, it is depending on where you are.

1468
01:03:56,860 --> 01:03:57,860
It's really hard.

1469
01:03:57,860 --> 01:04:00,860
But there was maybe vegetable curry in Tokyo.

1470
01:04:00,860 --> 01:04:03,860
There was. Yeah, it's vegetarian, though.

1471
01:04:03,860 --> 01:04:04,860
Well, it was actually vegan.

1472
01:04:04,860 --> 01:04:06,860
So vegans pass.

1473
01:04:06,860 --> 01:04:07,860
That's right. Yeah, it's hard.

1474
01:04:07,860 --> 01:04:09,860
And then, I mean, that's a whole other story.

1475
01:04:09,860 --> 01:04:14,860
I we went to when I went to see the Snow Monkeys in Japan, we were staying in a Rio

1476
01:04:14,860 --> 01:04:17,860
Khan, which is like the traditional Japanese hotel, which if you have time to leave

1477
01:04:17,860 --> 01:04:19,860
Tokyo and go to a Rio Khan, it's so cool.

1478
01:04:19,860 --> 01:04:21,860
It's worth the trip.

1479
01:04:21,860 --> 01:04:23,860
You don't have to go that far out, but it's really cool.

1480
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:25,860
And I had written ahead and told them I don't eat meat.

1481
01:04:25,860 --> 01:04:29,860
And they were like, but I guess to them, fish isn't meat.

1482
01:04:29,860 --> 01:04:31,860
Oh, no.

1483
01:04:31,860 --> 01:04:35,860
And they started serving me the most fishy fish of all the fish.

1484
01:04:35,860 --> 01:04:36,860
You know what I mean?

1485
01:04:36,860 --> 01:04:40,860
Like a little whole fish on a plate with his little eyeballs looking at me.

1486
01:04:40,860 --> 01:04:44,860
They served me a bowl of little tiny squids.

1487
01:04:45,860 --> 01:04:47,860
And I don't know if they were raw or if they were boiled.

1488
01:04:47,860 --> 01:04:52,860
But like Adam, my husband popped one into his mouth and I saw him like chewing it.

1489
01:04:52,860 --> 01:04:54,860
I was like, how is it?

1490
01:04:54,860 --> 01:04:56,860
And he was like, very fishy.

1491
01:04:56,860 --> 01:04:58,860
And I just moved stuff around my plate.

1492
01:04:58,860 --> 01:05:01,860
And then I felt terrible because it's a part of the culture to like not be

1493
01:05:01,860 --> 01:05:03,860
disrespectful and be like, I'm not eating that.

1494
01:05:03,860 --> 01:05:06,860
You know, it was just I was very hungry.

1495
01:05:06,860 --> 01:05:08,860
It was really not.

1496
01:05:08,860 --> 01:05:13,860
I also think I'm going to have two meals every meal as I am given what my wife

1497
01:05:13,860 --> 01:05:15,860
cannot eat. So I'm going to try to get the weight down.

1498
01:05:15,860 --> 01:05:17,860
Does Erin eat fish?

1499
01:05:17,860 --> 01:05:19,860
No. Oh, OK. Yep.

1500
01:05:19,860 --> 01:05:21,860
But she's going to look the other way on stocks.

1501
01:05:21,860 --> 01:05:23,860
Stocks are going to be tough. She's just going to.

1502
01:05:23,860 --> 01:05:25,860
You know what? I don't know what I don't know.

1503
01:05:25,860 --> 01:05:28,860
Same way, because part of me was like, I'm in a different culture.

1504
01:05:28,860 --> 01:05:31,860
I don't want I want to I want to try things, you know, whatever.

1505
01:05:31,860 --> 01:05:33,860
So I definitely had fish in Japan.

1506
01:05:33,860 --> 01:05:35,860
I had to. You know what I mean?

1507
01:05:35,860 --> 01:05:37,860
Every stock is everything.

1508
01:05:37,860 --> 01:05:39,860
I did my best to ask about things.

1509
01:05:39,860 --> 01:05:41,860
You know, it'd be so crazy.

1510
01:05:41,860 --> 01:05:43,860
I was like, is there anything in this rice?

1511
01:05:43,860 --> 01:05:46,860
And they go ask and they go, there's pork, there's beef and there's chicken.

1512
01:05:46,860 --> 01:05:49,860
And I'm like, they put pork in everything.

1513
01:05:49,860 --> 01:05:52,860
You know, and fish, they put fish in everything.

1514
01:05:52,860 --> 01:05:55,860
It was like in on The Simpsons when he's like, is anything without meat?

1515
01:05:55,860 --> 01:05:57,860
Possibly the meatloaf. Right.

1516
01:05:57,860 --> 01:05:59,860
Or when they go to the all you can eat seafood place in March goes,

1517
01:05:59,860 --> 01:06:01,860
is there anything without fish in it?

1518
01:06:01,860 --> 01:06:03,860
And they they and she goes, I'll just have the tic tacs in my purse.

1519
01:06:03,860 --> 01:06:05,860
He was excellent choice.

1520
01:06:05,860 --> 01:06:07,860
I felt I was just like, well, it's fine. I'll see the tic tacs.

1521
01:06:07,860 --> 01:06:09,860
That's all real. Oh, boy.

1522
01:06:09,860 --> 01:06:11,860
So good luck.

1523
01:06:11,860 --> 01:06:13,860
It's hard. Can I guess is the topic of

1524
01:06:16,860 --> 01:06:18,860
of animals and generally

1525
01:06:18,860 --> 01:06:21,860
like a disconnect of what's an animal and what's not.

1526
01:06:21,860 --> 01:06:26,860
I've watched several several specials did this, but especially one.

1527
01:06:26,860 --> 01:06:30,860
There's a in preparation for this episode, I watched some Michael Eisner

1528
01:06:30,860 --> 01:06:36,860
intros and stuff, which, you know, a classic hello always does me good.

1529
01:06:36,860 --> 01:06:37,860
But there's a really good one.

1530
01:06:37,860 --> 01:06:41,860
His intro to an animal kingdom special that Drew Carey ends up taking

1531
01:06:41,860 --> 01:06:43,860
the reins and posting.

1532
01:06:43,860 --> 01:06:46,860
But Michael kicks it off.

1533
01:06:46,860 --> 01:06:53,860
Hello. And then he talks about he he he says he says how Disney's

1534
01:06:53,860 --> 01:06:58,860
connection to animals has been part of the company for over seventy five years.

1535
01:06:58,860 --> 01:07:01,860
And then it cuts to Mickey Mouse.

1536
01:07:01,860 --> 01:07:05,860
And I'm like, like a drawing like, yeah, like a scratchy drawing.

1537
01:07:05,860 --> 01:07:07,860
Yeah. And then Steamboat Willie.

1538
01:07:07,860 --> 01:07:11,860
And I saw other things that said, you know, and with Animal Kingdom,

1539
01:07:11,860 --> 01:07:14,860
Disney's love affair for animals continues because as Walt said,

1540
01:07:14,860 --> 01:07:16,860
it all began with a mouse.

1541
01:07:16,860 --> 01:07:19,860
And I guess Mickey is a mouse.

1542
01:07:19,860 --> 01:07:22,860
But isn't it in the Safari Park?

1543
01:07:22,860 --> 01:07:26,860
Don't you feel a disconnect with that Mickey Mouse is an animal like my

1544
01:07:26,860 --> 01:07:32,860
if you had to describe him in ten words, I don't think animal would be one of the words.

1545
01:07:32,860 --> 01:07:35,860
He's essentially a person. He's a cartoon.

1546
01:07:35,860 --> 01:07:37,860
He's one of us, but he has big ears.

1547
01:07:37,860 --> 01:07:38,860
He's a person with big ears.

1548
01:07:38,860 --> 01:07:43,860
Well, and Disney did all those nature documentaries that like baby boomers

1549
01:07:43,860 --> 01:07:48,860
would have grown up watching on TV and like the people who would be paying for

1550
01:07:48,860 --> 01:07:52,860
a trip to this park would probably fondly remember.

1551
01:07:52,860 --> 01:07:55,860
Yes, that would be the connection to Disney and animals.

1552
01:07:55,860 --> 01:07:56,860
To me, it's weird to go.

1553
01:07:56,860 --> 01:08:01,860
It's Michael Eisner in an African village shopping and people are in the

1554
01:08:01,860 --> 01:08:05,860
people are in tribal wear and there's the dung dung dung dung.

1555
01:08:05,860 --> 01:08:08,860
And then they're telling me that, well, I don't know if you knew this,

1556
01:08:08,860 --> 01:08:13,860
but Disney likes animals and then it cuts to a 1920s mouse on a steamboat.

1557
01:08:13,860 --> 01:08:15,860
There's just an aesthetic disconnect here.

1558
01:08:15,860 --> 01:08:18,860
Specifically, I believe because I watch that special too.

1559
01:08:18,860 --> 01:08:20,860
And this is what I'm going to say. That special is rough.

1560
01:08:20,860 --> 01:08:22,860
We like these specials.

1561
01:08:22,860 --> 01:08:25,860
They're yeah, this one's really, really hard.

1562
01:08:25,860 --> 01:08:30,860
A lot of public domain, do do do do do kind of like music, like comedy music,

1563
01:08:30,860 --> 01:08:32,860
like comedy music. Yeah.

1564
01:08:32,860 --> 01:08:36,860
Now I get there's some very good music in it too, like Ladysmith, Black Mabazo,

1565
01:08:36,860 --> 01:08:44,860
Lebo M from the sings the song from the opening of the Lion King movie and musical.

1566
01:08:44,860 --> 01:08:51,860
But then there's like this like slapstick music and like some really very odd

1567
01:08:51,860 --> 01:08:53,860
like guests show up.

1568
01:08:53,860 --> 01:08:58,860
Paul Rodriguez and Jane Seymour and her family, a lot of family forced in there.

1569
01:08:58,860 --> 01:09:03,860
A fourth Maori, there's Tia Tamera, Taj and then you saw the fourth one.

1570
01:09:03,860 --> 01:09:05,860
There's a fourth Maori.

1571
01:09:05,860 --> 01:09:07,860
Fourth Maori is a lie.

1572
01:09:07,860 --> 01:09:10,860
It also like I think that is Eisner.

1573
01:09:10,860 --> 01:09:15,860
The opening is Eisner walking through the Harambe section, the Harambe village.

1574
01:09:15,860 --> 01:09:21,860
And it is so populated with background actors and like set dressing and stuff.

1575
01:09:21,860 --> 01:09:24,860
Like it looks like a full interactive theater thing.

1576
01:09:24,860 --> 01:09:29,860
And later, Jane Seymour and her family, and I feel very bad about this,

1577
01:09:29,860 --> 01:09:34,860
but they meet the mayor of Harambe Village, Joseph Botoa.

1578
01:09:34,860 --> 01:09:36,860
I'm sorry, Joseph.

1579
01:09:36,860 --> 01:09:43,860
I'm going to, as I've said before, I will be rat fucking all of the park managers

1580
01:09:43,860 --> 01:09:46,860
when my reign begins.

1581
01:09:46,860 --> 01:09:50,860
Welcome to Harambe. Meet the mayor, Jason Sheridan.

1582
01:09:50,860 --> 01:09:52,860
Jumbo, welcome.

1583
01:09:52,860 --> 01:10:01,860
But yeah, I think that some of that, I don't remember much interaction,

1584
01:10:01,860 --> 01:10:03,860
interactive element.

1585
01:10:03,860 --> 01:10:06,860
They felt like they were really pushing.

1586
01:10:06,860 --> 01:10:08,860
Like it's a living, breathing thing.

1587
01:10:08,860 --> 01:10:13,860
And I do think this park has a lot of character and is of any of them in Florida,

1588
01:10:13,860 --> 01:10:14,860
living, breathing thing.

1589
01:10:14,860 --> 01:10:18,860
But I'm like, who are all these people walking around for this special?

1590
01:10:18,860 --> 01:10:21,860
I feel like they're later on.

1591
01:10:21,860 --> 01:10:22,860
Yeah, little too thick.

1592
01:10:22,860 --> 01:10:29,860
Does anyone have any information, memories of the opening village of Harambe?

1593
01:10:29,860 --> 01:10:31,860
Or is this a mystery to us all?

1594
01:10:31,860 --> 01:10:33,860
This is no Main Street, I don't think.

1595
01:10:33,860 --> 01:10:37,860
No, I've been twice or a couple of times in the last few years.

1596
01:10:37,860 --> 01:10:40,860
This is in the Africa, the section of the park.

1597
01:10:40,860 --> 01:10:42,860
It's where, what else is there?

1598
01:10:42,860 --> 01:10:45,860
This is where the Kilimanjaro safaris leaves from.

1599
01:10:45,860 --> 01:10:48,860
This is where you board the train to go to Rafiki's Planet Watch.

1600
01:10:48,860 --> 01:10:50,860
Which is over now, right?

1601
01:10:50,860 --> 01:10:51,860
It's reopening.

1602
01:10:51,860 --> 01:10:52,860
Yeah, it's reopening.

1603
01:10:52,860 --> 01:10:55,860
Everyone thought they were, they announced they closed it,

1604
01:10:55,860 --> 01:10:57,860
and now they just announced they're reopening it in the spring.

1605
01:10:57,860 --> 01:10:59,860
How about that? Rafiki's Planet Watch?

1606
01:10:59,860 --> 01:11:00,860
Anybody?

1607
01:11:00,860 --> 01:11:05,860
I listened to y'all's episode on the Kilimanjaro.

1608
01:11:05,860 --> 01:11:06,860
Ever.

1609
01:11:06,860 --> 01:11:07,860
Yes.

1610
01:11:07,860 --> 01:11:11,860
And I like that this park only has like two or three big rides,

1611
01:11:11,860 --> 01:11:14,860
and the rest is kind of chilling, looking around,

1612
01:11:14,860 --> 01:11:16,860
looking at animals, you know.

1613
01:11:16,860 --> 01:11:20,860
Because of where I'm at in life, you know, I don't need those crazy rides.

1614
01:11:20,860 --> 01:11:21,860
You know what I mean?

1615
01:11:21,860 --> 01:11:24,860
I don't need to get a head rush and fill like shit for two days.

1616
01:11:24,860 --> 01:11:29,860
I like just easy, I love going through all the animals and looking at them.

1617
01:11:29,860 --> 01:11:32,860
And again, I guess from someone who doesn't really go to zoos often,

1618
01:11:32,860 --> 01:11:34,860
you can go up to that glass,

1619
01:11:34,860 --> 01:11:38,860
and there are gorillas on the other side of the glass like five feet from you.

1620
01:11:38,860 --> 01:11:39,860
I mean, not like a foot from you.

1621
01:11:39,860 --> 01:11:40,860
Oh, yeah.

1622
01:11:40,860 --> 01:11:42,860
And you can just sit there and watch them.

1623
01:11:42,860 --> 01:11:43,860
Look at the bats.

1624
01:11:43,860 --> 01:11:44,860
Did you see the bats?

1625
01:11:44,860 --> 01:11:45,860
No!

1626
01:11:45,860 --> 01:11:48,860
The bats are so close.

1627
01:11:48,860 --> 01:11:51,860
The bats are, I forget, if I forget which, it's the walkthrough tour.

1628
01:11:51,860 --> 01:11:53,860
I think of the same when you're talking about,

1629
01:11:53,860 --> 01:11:55,860
but there's a couple like of those little rooms,

1630
01:11:55,860 --> 01:11:58,860
and you just go and you just stare at bats like three feet from you,

1631
01:11:58,860 --> 01:12:00,860
and you're like, these are terrifying.

1632
01:12:00,860 --> 01:12:02,860
Bats are so weird.

1633
01:12:02,860 --> 01:12:04,860
They're just hanging there, and you're just like fascinated.

1634
01:12:04,860 --> 01:12:09,860
And also, there's holes, there's like netting to protect you,

1635
01:12:09,860 --> 01:12:11,860
but you're like, I can pull my hand through here.

1636
01:12:11,860 --> 01:12:13,860
They put a lot of trust in people.

1637
01:12:13,860 --> 01:12:14,860
Yeah.

1638
01:12:14,860 --> 01:12:16,860
Because I was thinking that being,

1639
01:12:16,860 --> 01:12:17,860
I don't know if you all are like this,

1640
01:12:17,860 --> 01:12:19,860
but I have sort of a dark vision of things where I'm like,

1641
01:12:19,860 --> 01:12:23,860
oh, I could just throw this at someone.

1642
01:12:23,860 --> 01:12:24,860
Oh, I know, all the time.

1643
01:12:24,860 --> 01:12:27,860
You could throw a damn camera at an antelope and hit them.

1644
01:12:27,860 --> 01:12:28,860
You're saying?

1645
01:12:28,860 --> 01:12:30,860
They couldn't stop you.

1646
01:12:30,860 --> 01:12:32,860
They could remove you from the park and sue you or whatever,

1647
01:12:32,860 --> 01:12:35,860
but they trust these people going through that safari

1648
01:12:35,860 --> 01:12:37,860
to not jump out and grab a lion or something.

1649
01:12:37,860 --> 01:12:38,860
Is there a name for that?

1650
01:12:38,860 --> 01:12:42,860
Because I have that, where it's an impulse to do the worst thing you could ever do.

1651
01:12:42,860 --> 01:12:44,860
You don't do it, but you see it in your head.

1652
01:12:44,860 --> 01:12:47,860
They say that's healthy, to have like, this thought is crazy,

1653
01:12:47,860 --> 01:12:51,860
and then you actively recognize yourself not acting on it.

1654
01:12:51,860 --> 01:12:53,860
Yeah, I do that constantly.

1655
01:12:53,860 --> 01:12:54,860
It's weird.

1656
01:12:54,860 --> 01:12:59,860
It's like fantasize about if, now I could do this, is what you're saying.

1657
01:12:59,860 --> 01:13:00,860
Yeah.

1658
01:13:00,860 --> 01:13:01,860
The Starbucks is closed.

1659
01:13:01,860 --> 01:13:02,860
There's no one inside.

1660
01:13:02,860 --> 01:13:03,860
I could drive into it.

1661
01:13:03,860 --> 01:13:05,860
What's the harm?

1662
01:13:05,860 --> 01:13:07,860
I've never had that one.

1663
01:13:07,860 --> 01:13:10,860
You never just wanted to destroy a storefront?

1664
01:13:10,860 --> 01:13:12,860
That wouldn't matter so much.

1665
01:13:12,860 --> 01:13:14,860
I feel like I used to have it when I'd be in band

1666
01:13:14,860 --> 01:13:17,860
and I'd be watching the different symphonic band play,

1667
01:13:17,860 --> 01:13:19,860
and I had my trumpet waiting for my part,

1668
01:13:19,860 --> 01:13:22,860
and I'd be like, I could fuck everything up right now.

1669
01:13:22,860 --> 01:13:26,860
I never got close to it, but I would get away.

1670
01:13:26,860 --> 01:13:29,860
This probably seems like part of my character.

1671
01:13:29,860 --> 01:13:33,860
I would get away with telling other kids to do bad stuff in high school.

1672
01:13:34,860 --> 01:13:38,860
I would say, hey, it would be funny if you,

1673
01:13:38,860 --> 01:13:41,860
when you were signing your slip that said you practiced,

1674
01:13:41,860 --> 01:13:46,860
if you signed like Hitler, and he would do it.

1675
01:13:46,860 --> 01:13:50,860
I would get kids to do stuff because I was too scared to do it.

1676
01:13:50,860 --> 01:13:51,860
I had bad instincts.

1677
01:13:51,860 --> 01:13:55,860
That isn't as bad as driving your car through the Starbucks.

1678
01:13:55,860 --> 01:13:56,860
No.

1679
01:13:56,860 --> 01:13:58,860
You didn't get anybody to go full reference.

1680
01:13:58,860 --> 01:13:59,860
Again, no one's in there.

1681
01:13:59,860 --> 01:14:00,860
They're insured.

1682
01:14:00,860 --> 01:14:01,860
I'm insured.

1683
01:14:01,860 --> 01:14:03,860
Go to the drive-thru first.

1684
01:14:03,860 --> 01:14:05,860
And what's the name on that?

1685
01:14:05,860 --> 01:14:06,860
Hitler.

1686
01:14:06,860 --> 01:14:07,860
Then drive through the store.

1687
01:14:07,860 --> 01:14:09,860
Get your jollies off.

1688
01:14:09,860 --> 01:14:13,860
And play a ripping off-key trombone solo.

1689
01:14:13,860 --> 01:14:16,860
Let's combine all of these awful things.

1690
01:14:16,860 --> 01:14:17,860
That would be so funny.

1691
01:14:17,860 --> 01:14:18,860
And a little lying loose in there, too.

1692
01:14:18,860 --> 01:14:21,860
It would be so funny if you just, oh, when the saints...

1693
01:14:21,860 --> 01:14:22,860
in the middle of the day.

1694
01:14:22,860 --> 01:14:24,860
What's the worst thing I could do now?

1695
01:14:24,860 --> 01:14:28,860
Play when the saints go marching in at an inappropriate time.

1696
01:14:29,860 --> 01:14:32,860
Now, in terms of worst-case scenario, thinking,

1697
01:14:32,860 --> 01:14:34,860
I did find out an interesting thing about Animal Kingdom.

1698
01:14:34,860 --> 01:14:40,860
It is the only one of the Disney parks where the bathrooms have doors.

1699
01:14:40,860 --> 01:14:42,860
Think about the other Disney parks.

1700
01:14:42,860 --> 01:14:44,860
You walk into the bathrooms.

1701
01:14:44,860 --> 01:14:47,860
It's kind of an entryway, hallway sort of thing.

1702
01:14:47,860 --> 01:14:48,860
These bathrooms have doors.

1703
01:14:48,860 --> 01:14:53,860
In case an animal gets loose, you have a place to hide.

1704
01:14:53,860 --> 01:15:00,860
So, now, there is not really any record of incidents of animals getting loose, thankfully.

1705
01:15:00,860 --> 01:15:03,860
But there's other parks with doors.

1706
01:15:03,860 --> 01:15:05,860
It's just maybe all the bathrooms have doors in it.

1707
01:15:05,860 --> 01:15:07,860
Yeah, maybe that's it.

1708
01:15:07,860 --> 01:15:08,860
It's something like that.

1709
01:15:08,860 --> 01:15:09,860
Disney has doors on bathrooms.

1710
01:15:09,860 --> 01:15:10,860
Disneyland, I guess.

1711
01:15:10,860 --> 01:15:11,860
Typically, they're just open.

1712
01:15:11,860 --> 01:15:12,860
Yeah, right.

1713
01:15:12,860 --> 01:15:13,860
I feel like, yeah.

1714
01:15:13,860 --> 01:15:14,860
More likely.

1715
01:15:14,860 --> 01:15:17,860
But Animal Kingdom designed actively with doors.

1716
01:15:17,860 --> 01:15:22,860
The day where the shit goes down and everybody's huddling in an Animal Kingdom bathroom.

1717
01:15:22,860 --> 01:15:23,860
The Jurassic Park day.

1718
01:15:23,860 --> 01:15:24,860
Yeah, yeah.

1719
01:15:24,860 --> 01:15:29,860
But don't you think they would shoot that poor thing with tranquilizers so fast?

1720
01:15:29,860 --> 01:15:32,860
Yeah, I think there's probably extra guns at Animal Kingdom.

1721
01:15:32,860 --> 01:15:37,860
The problem is they're all different animals and they all have to coordinate sort of with themselves

1722
01:15:37,860 --> 01:15:40,860
to probably be an effective human eating situation.

1723
01:15:40,860 --> 01:15:44,860
They'd all have to somehow communicate to each other, today's the day.

1724
01:15:44,860 --> 01:15:45,860
Right.

1725
01:15:45,860 --> 01:15:49,860
Because I could see just a pack of rhinos going nuts and they'll tranq them.

1726
01:15:49,860 --> 01:15:51,860
All the animals would have to lose their mind.

1727
01:15:51,860 --> 01:15:54,860
Collectively come together and say, May 5th, we're going.

1728
01:15:54,860 --> 01:15:58,860
Which might be a thing that they'll evolve into.

1729
01:15:58,860 --> 01:15:59,860
Yeah.

1730
01:15:59,860 --> 01:16:03,860
Like generations from now, the animals also develop a like, we gotta get the hell out of here.

1731
01:16:03,860 --> 01:16:09,860
Which especially the better kept animals at Animal Kingdom who are like,

1732
01:16:09,860 --> 01:16:12,860
or have it better than the caged animals at other zoos.

1733
01:16:12,860 --> 01:16:13,860
Right.

1734
01:16:13,860 --> 01:16:18,860
Yeah, maybe they're more, that's where the singularity, that's where the animal's singularity is.

1735
01:16:18,860 --> 01:16:20,860
Yes, the animal singularity.

1736
01:16:20,860 --> 01:16:22,860
The animal singularity, yes.

1737
01:16:22,860 --> 01:16:25,860
That'd be more likely to happen at like a shitty zoo.

1738
01:16:25,860 --> 01:16:26,860
Maybe so.

1739
01:16:26,860 --> 01:16:27,860
Yeah.

1740
01:16:27,860 --> 01:16:28,860
Where security is less.

1741
01:16:28,860 --> 01:16:31,860
But I don't know, maybe these Animal Kingdom animals are smarter.

1742
01:16:31,860 --> 01:16:34,860
Maybe they're evolving faster, so in a hundred years.

1743
01:16:34,860 --> 01:16:39,860
And if some of those crazy crocodiles from the swamps start making it down there,

1744
01:16:39,860 --> 01:16:43,860
maybe they start unlocking cages with their teeth and letting their buddies out.

1745
01:16:43,860 --> 01:16:46,860
Are there like three Dr. Dolittle movies in development?

1746
01:16:46,860 --> 01:16:50,860
Like if people get inspired to talk to the animals, you know.

1747
01:16:50,860 --> 01:16:53,860
We must kill these films before they wreak havoc.

1748
01:16:53,860 --> 01:16:56,860
The good news is we won't be here in a hundred years.

1749
01:16:56,860 --> 01:16:57,860
Sure, maybe not.

1750
01:16:57,860 --> 01:16:58,860
Oh, maybe not.

1751
01:16:58,860 --> 01:16:59,860
Maybe not.

1752
01:16:59,860 --> 01:17:00,860
Uh oh.

1753
01:17:00,860 --> 01:17:02,860
Because of global warming.

1754
01:17:02,860 --> 01:17:03,860
Oh wow.

1755
01:17:03,860 --> 01:17:05,860
From Animal Agriculture.

1756
01:17:05,860 --> 01:17:06,860
Yeah, that's true.

1757
01:17:06,860 --> 01:17:07,860
I'm sorry.

1758
01:17:07,860 --> 01:17:14,860
Hey look, it's a park with a conservation message and this is an episode with a conservation message.

1759
01:17:14,860 --> 01:17:15,860
Yes.

1760
01:17:15,860 --> 01:17:24,860
Which said that is a thing that sets some of these attractions apart that even the Rapids ride has is about deforestation.

1761
01:17:24,860 --> 01:17:32,860
Which I was watching this with my wife and she pointed out, oh yes, clearing out a bunch of forests for industrial purposes.

1762
01:17:32,860 --> 01:17:34,860
You know, like a theme park.

1763
01:17:34,860 --> 01:17:39,860
It is a little weird to be, yeah imagine, forests coming down.

1764
01:17:39,860 --> 01:17:44,860
I think there's a time and a place and entertainment is important and art is important.

1765
01:17:44,860 --> 01:17:52,860
And you know, keep some forests up, take some of it down for things that are going to serve us and then keep a balance.

1766
01:17:52,860 --> 01:17:53,860
Yeah.

1767
01:17:53,860 --> 01:17:54,860
You know.

1768
01:17:54,860 --> 01:18:00,860
Especially in Florida where like for every plot of land Disney does something, two of it affects like swamp or marshland.

1769
01:18:00,860 --> 01:18:02,860
They have to do something to counteract it.

1770
01:18:02,860 --> 01:18:03,860
And they have, right?

1771
01:18:03,860 --> 01:18:04,860
Yeah, yeah, quite a bit.

1772
01:18:04,860 --> 01:18:06,860
They've covered their ass.

1773
01:18:06,860 --> 01:18:09,860
They got a PR team on this.

1774
01:18:09,860 --> 01:18:14,860
Tons of trees, tons of plants and stuff added for Animal Kingdom.

1775
01:18:14,860 --> 01:18:16,860
I remember that when I first went.

1776
01:18:16,860 --> 01:18:18,860
Like these trees are a little thin.

1777
01:18:18,860 --> 01:18:26,860
Sort of the same thing with later 20th century islands of adventure and California adventure.

1778
01:18:26,860 --> 01:18:36,860
Like the early pictures make it look so thin in terms of trees because it takes like a decade for stuff to really grow and fill in.

1779
01:18:36,860 --> 01:18:38,860
But like Animal Kingdom looks beautiful now.

1780
01:18:38,860 --> 01:18:39,860
Yeah.

1781
01:18:39,860 --> 01:18:42,860
And especially now with all the trees are helping it.

1782
01:18:42,860 --> 01:18:45,860
But Animal Kingdom is the only one I don't know my way around still.

1783
01:18:45,860 --> 01:18:46,860
Yeah.

1784
01:18:46,860 --> 01:18:47,860
Which is interesting.

1785
01:18:47,860 --> 01:18:52,860
If I landed there right now, I wouldn't know where Asia is as opposed to Dino Land USA.

1786
01:18:52,860 --> 01:18:54,860
I know like vaguely where stuff is.

1787
01:18:54,860 --> 01:18:59,860
But like I like that aspect of it is like it does feel a little bit less structured than a theme park.

1788
01:18:59,860 --> 01:19:01,860
Even though it's of course structured like theme park.

1789
01:19:01,860 --> 01:19:02,860
It's just I don't know.

1790
01:19:02,860 --> 01:19:10,860
They do a good job of sort of blending everything and making me kind of in my memory be like, I don't remember where I see Everest over there.

1791
01:19:10,860 --> 01:19:11,860
I know where that is.

1792
01:19:11,860 --> 01:19:13,860
But it's like you're exploring.

1793
01:19:13,860 --> 01:19:15,860
It is an actual jungle.

1794
01:19:15,860 --> 01:19:25,860
I would imagine too like when Animal Kingdom started, there were the grand plans of like what we were talking about going back to like the mayor and like locals and this.

1795
01:19:25,860 --> 01:19:30,860
And this is what I was telling you that Jason the other day is why we got to go to Star Wars land first couple of weeks.

1796
01:19:30,860 --> 01:19:32,860
Is because they had such grand plans and vision for it.

1797
01:19:32,860 --> 01:19:35,860
And then within a couple of weeks, they're like, oh, this isn't sustainable.

1798
01:19:35,860 --> 01:19:36,860
Uh huh.

1799
01:19:36,860 --> 01:19:37,860
Like all this insane stuff.

1800
01:19:37,860 --> 01:19:38,860
Right.

1801
01:19:38,860 --> 01:19:41,860
This is because they're talking about being able to barter with a robot at Star Wars land.

1802
01:19:41,860 --> 01:19:43,860
And it's like, that's going to go away.

1803
01:19:43,860 --> 01:19:45,860
That's not going to last for a week.

1804
01:19:45,860 --> 01:19:46,860
Like three weeks.

1805
01:19:46,860 --> 01:19:49,860
A kid will stick a pencil in its eye and it'll short out.

1806
01:19:49,860 --> 01:19:51,860
Or like a dad will be confused.

1807
01:19:51,860 --> 01:19:53,860
He just wants to buy an item.

1808
01:19:53,860 --> 01:19:57,860
It's just like the robot won't give me the price I'm looking for.

1809
01:19:57,860 --> 01:19:58,860
And then he freaks out.

1810
01:19:58,860 --> 01:20:00,860
And then it's a viral video.

1811
01:20:00,860 --> 01:20:03,860
If the card has a chip, you must insert the chip.

1812
01:20:03,860 --> 01:20:04,860
Well, no, it's a Disney credit.

1813
01:20:04,860 --> 01:20:08,860
I have points on Disney bucks on the credit card.

1814
01:20:08,860 --> 01:20:11,860
Dad melts down and strangles robot.

1815
01:20:11,860 --> 01:20:14,860
It'll be like a viral video and then they have to pull the robot out.

1816
01:20:14,860 --> 01:20:16,860
What are dollars called in Star Wars?

1817
01:20:16,860 --> 01:20:17,860
Damn it.

1818
01:20:17,860 --> 01:20:19,860
I just want a Diet Coke.

1819
01:20:19,860 --> 01:20:20,860
I'm so tired.

1820
01:20:20,860 --> 01:20:22,860
We do not have Diet Coke here.

1821
01:20:22,860 --> 01:20:23,860
I know.

1822
01:20:23,860 --> 01:20:24,860
Yes.

1823
01:20:24,860 --> 01:20:25,860
I've been told that at every location.

1824
01:20:25,860 --> 01:20:28,860
Why you can milk Diet Coke from this beast?

1825
01:20:28,860 --> 01:20:30,860
I don't want to milk it.

1826
01:20:30,860 --> 01:20:33,860
Diet C-K-E is available.

1827
01:20:33,860 --> 01:20:38,860
Is that the same thing or is that a different call letter for a robot or droid?

1828
01:20:38,860 --> 01:20:40,860
They're not called robots here.

1829
01:20:40,860 --> 01:20:42,860
Droid is the correct term.

1830
01:20:42,860 --> 01:20:44,860
I think this is me.

1831
01:20:44,860 --> 01:20:45,860
I think I'm going to be this.

1832
01:20:45,860 --> 01:20:46,860
You might be the main guy.

1833
01:20:46,860 --> 01:20:47,860
Yeah, you might be.

1834
01:20:47,860 --> 01:20:48,860
I'm going to bring it all the way.

1835
01:20:48,860 --> 01:20:50,860
And not have a getting a Diet Coke.

1836
01:20:50,860 --> 01:20:52,860
I love people watching at the parks.

1837
01:20:52,860 --> 01:20:59,860
I love the dads that you know or have to work and they just had to go for the family.

1838
01:20:59,860 --> 01:21:02,860
You can see their mind racing in their heads as they were.

1839
01:21:02,860 --> 01:21:04,860
They're like Winnie the Pooh Mickey ears.

1840
01:21:04,860 --> 01:21:06,860
They're just like, I got to get back to the office.

1841
01:21:06,860 --> 01:21:08,860
McGillicuddy files are due.

1842
01:21:08,860 --> 01:21:11,860
I love it.

1843
01:21:11,860 --> 01:21:13,860
They all work in the 50s.

1844
01:21:13,860 --> 01:21:21,860
The Florida one, I think, is you see more of it because I feel like I see less of Cranky Dad and Disneyland.

1845
01:21:21,860 --> 01:21:30,860
I see more of somebody who I might profile as hating Disneyland, but they have a big sweatshirt on, a big gaudy Mickey sweatshirt on or something.

1846
01:21:30,860 --> 01:21:33,860
You kind of overhear them talking and you're like, oh, they're a nerd too.

1847
01:21:33,860 --> 01:21:38,860
Yeah, I don't know if Florida has as many townies as we have.

1848
01:21:38,860 --> 01:21:39,860
They don't.

1849
01:21:39,860 --> 01:21:40,860
Yeah.

1850
01:21:40,860 --> 01:21:46,860
You see more, I think, of Dad on vacation who has no strong appreciation for this and is just exhausted.

1851
01:21:46,860 --> 01:21:52,860
There's so many people that from around the area that have passes that just go and get a dole whip and go home.

1852
01:21:52,860 --> 01:21:54,860
You know, or that kind of thing.

1853
01:21:54,860 --> 01:21:55,860
Yeah.

1854
01:21:55,860 --> 01:21:57,860
Ain't it grand?

1855
01:21:57,860 --> 01:21:58,860
That's the best.

1856
01:21:58,860 --> 01:22:04,860
You know who took a vacation to Disney's Animal Kingdom was Sabrina the Teenage Witch.

1857
01:22:04,860 --> 01:22:06,860
Oh, I didn't know that.

1858
01:22:06,860 --> 01:22:10,860
There's a full Animal Kingdom episode of it.

1859
01:22:10,860 --> 01:22:11,860
She doesn't go to the other parks.

1860
01:22:11,860 --> 01:22:13,860
It's entirely a lot of the show.

1861
01:22:13,860 --> 01:22:21,860
Thirty percent of the show is in a hotel is in a fake Coronado Springs hotel room and the rest is in Animal Kingdom.

1862
01:22:21,860 --> 01:22:26,860
And I love a good TGIF Disney World episode.

1863
01:22:26,860 --> 01:22:28,860
This is a rough one.

1864
01:22:28,860 --> 01:22:30,860
Yeah, it's not.

1865
01:22:30,860 --> 01:22:33,860
I think this might be some of why I didn't really like Animal Kingdom for a while.

1866
01:22:33,860 --> 01:22:35,860
These I didn't like the specials as much.

1867
01:22:35,860 --> 01:22:37,860
Not a very good TGIF.

1868
01:22:37,860 --> 01:22:50,860
There is a very rough B plot where the two aunts are digging in Dino land USA, which is an area where you where kids can like excavate and they find a bone.

1869
01:22:50,860 --> 01:22:54,860
And I guess a real bone is what we're led to believe.

1870
01:22:54,860 --> 01:23:04,860
And one of the aunts said one of the answers, I've got to find out more about this bone, which is like that's a great promo line.

1871
01:23:04,860 --> 01:23:07,860
This week on Sabrina, I've got to find out more about this bone.

1872
01:23:07,860 --> 01:23:09,860
Which aunt is it? Caroline Ray?

1873
01:23:09,860 --> 01:23:10,860
It's the other aunt.

1874
01:23:10,860 --> 01:23:12,860
The other aunt that I don't know the name of.

1875
01:23:12,860 --> 01:23:14,860
Brodrick, I want to say.

1876
01:23:14,860 --> 01:23:17,860
My dream role, a witchy aunt.

1877
01:23:17,860 --> 01:23:19,860
I'm getting up there, you know.

1878
01:23:19,860 --> 01:23:21,860
I love those aunts.

1879
01:23:21,860 --> 01:23:22,860
I thought they were very funny.

1880
01:23:22,860 --> 01:23:23,860
Me too.

1881
01:23:23,860 --> 01:23:24,860
They were great.

1882
01:23:24,860 --> 01:23:25,860
Oh, and the cat.

1883
01:23:25,860 --> 01:23:26,860
Yeah, Salem.

1884
01:23:26,860 --> 01:23:29,860
Salem was my favorite.

1885
01:23:29,860 --> 01:23:35,860
Yeah, I also thought it was very cute when they all wished the Netflix cast good luck on their show.

1886
01:23:35,860 --> 01:23:37,860
I thought that was very charming.

1887
01:23:37,860 --> 01:23:38,860
That's nice.

1888
01:23:38,860 --> 01:23:43,860
The thumbnail down from the Disney World episode, the very next episode has RuPaul in it.

1889
01:23:43,860 --> 01:23:46,860
So they had fun bands and stuff.

1890
01:23:46,860 --> 01:23:49,860
I feel like the monkeys were on Sabrina.

1891
01:23:49,860 --> 01:23:50,860
Wait, is Sabrina on Netflix?

1892
01:23:50,860 --> 01:23:51,860
It's on Hulu.

1893
01:23:51,860 --> 01:23:52,860
Okay, good to know.

1894
01:23:52,860 --> 01:23:53,860
Sabrina on Hulu.

1895
01:23:53,860 --> 01:23:54,860
Check it out.

1896
01:23:54,860 --> 01:23:55,860
I used to watch.

1897
01:23:55,860 --> 01:23:58,860
I was very into the show when it was on.

1898
01:23:58,860 --> 01:23:59,860
Sure.

1899
01:23:59,860 --> 01:24:00,860
Yeah, yeah.

1900
01:24:00,860 --> 01:24:02,860
Rough Disney World episode, though, I have to say.

1901
01:24:02,860 --> 01:24:09,860
The bone comes to life with magic and they make it a Neanderthal who's running around the park with them.

1902
01:24:09,860 --> 01:24:10,860
What?

1903
01:24:10,860 --> 01:24:11,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1904
01:24:11,860 --> 01:24:12,860
That's an odd choice.

1905
01:24:12,860 --> 01:24:13,860
Yeah, really strange.

1906
01:24:13,860 --> 01:24:18,860
See, and you barely get to see, a lot of it is Sabrina running around the nature outskirt of the party.

1907
01:24:18,860 --> 01:24:19,860
You don't get to see rides.

1908
01:24:19,860 --> 01:24:21,860
They don't talk about dinosaur.

1909
01:24:21,860 --> 01:24:22,860
They don't go on it.

1910
01:24:22,860 --> 01:24:23,860
It's a rough.

1911
01:24:23,860 --> 01:24:25,860
Give me my sweet park shots.

1912
01:24:25,860 --> 01:24:29,860
Let me see characters riding a ride with no jokes for five minutes.

1913
01:24:29,860 --> 01:24:32,860
That's what I want in my theme park episode.

1914
01:24:32,860 --> 01:24:38,860
This park, the way the lands and everything are broken up, it does start to slip a little

1915
01:24:38,860 --> 01:24:41,860
because it's like, ah, the oasis when you walk in.

1916
01:24:41,860 --> 01:24:48,860
And then Discovery Island, which was originally called Safari something, where the Tree of Life is,

1917
01:24:49,860 --> 01:24:56,860
the big centerpiece of the park, is on an island in the middle of the waterway.

1918
01:24:56,860 --> 01:24:58,860
And then you have Africa and Asia.

1919
01:24:58,860 --> 01:25:01,860
And then Dino Land USA.

1920
01:25:01,860 --> 01:25:03,860
Had to get America in there somehow.

1921
01:25:03,860 --> 01:25:06,860
And then eventually Pandora, the world of Avatar.

1922
01:25:06,860 --> 01:25:09,860
Yeah, it's a strange breakdown.

1923
01:25:09,860 --> 01:25:18,860
Continent, continent, weird side road attraction, and then a place beyond the realm of imagination.

1924
01:25:18,860 --> 01:25:22,860
You know what's so interesting though is that I never even thought about that.

1925
01:25:22,860 --> 01:25:26,860
I wonder how many people even notice that.

1926
01:25:26,860 --> 01:25:29,860
How many people know the names of these things at all?

1927
01:25:29,860 --> 01:25:32,860
I'm usually just looking around, being like, oh, that's cool.

1928
01:25:32,860 --> 01:25:33,860
And I do have to give them credit.

1929
01:25:33,860 --> 01:25:37,860
There is a full bag of like, oh, Dino Land USA was made by Chester and Hester.

1930
01:25:37,860 --> 01:25:39,860
It was a roadside attraction.

1931
01:25:39,860 --> 01:25:44,860
Like all the dinosaur, like the Cabezon dinosaurs in California.

1932
01:25:44,860 --> 01:25:49,860
They did put some thought into it because they're like, well, we need to put some kiddie rides in here somewhere.

1933
01:25:49,860 --> 01:25:52,860
Yeah, they found a way to justify it.

1934
01:25:52,860 --> 01:25:59,860
But I was reminding myself of the not built, what was supposed to be in Dino Land USA, the excavator.

1935
01:25:59,860 --> 01:26:00,860
Oh, yeah.

1936
01:26:00,860 --> 01:26:09,860
The excavator was like a mine car that takes you into the dig site and things go haywire and you go through.

1937
01:26:09,860 --> 01:26:21,860
It's like kind of an advance of Big Thunder Mountain, where you go through some of those dinosaur bones and here you go through a full, you know, long, fully enveloping dinosaur skeleton.

1938
01:26:21,860 --> 01:26:24,860
And then you get attacked by like a robotic dinosaur.

1939
01:26:24,860 --> 01:26:27,860
Like it's like a crane or something that looks like a dinosaur.

1940
01:26:27,860 --> 01:26:30,860
Like a dinosaur. The concept art is super cool.

1941
01:26:30,860 --> 01:26:33,860
And they they were going to do it.

1942
01:26:33,860 --> 01:26:36,860
This was going to be one of the major attractions of the place.

1943
01:26:36,860 --> 01:26:44,860
And then Countdown to Extinction came up, which was a tie in to the movie dinosaur that was coming out.

1944
01:26:44,860 --> 01:26:47,860
And they could use the same track as Indiana Jones.

1945
01:26:47,860 --> 01:26:48,860
That was going to be cheaper.

1946
01:26:48,860 --> 01:26:50,860
So we didn't get this cool Dino roller coaster.

1947
01:26:50,860 --> 01:26:54,860
That's so I think that would have like notched up this park.

1948
01:26:54,860 --> 01:26:57,860
Yeah, from out of the gate a little stronger.

1949
01:26:57,860 --> 01:27:14,860
But they had to spread the word about the tale of, you know, Aladar and Kron, our friends Aladar and Kron as voiced by D.B. Sweeney and Julianne Margulies.

1950
01:27:14,860 --> 01:27:16,860
Dinosaur is a weird.

1951
01:27:16,860 --> 01:27:17,860
Yeah, we should do.

1952
01:27:17,860 --> 01:27:18,860
We should watch.

1953
01:27:18,860 --> 01:27:20,860
We should do a dinosaur commentary.

1954
01:27:20,860 --> 01:27:21,860
We shouldn't flick dinosaur.

1955
01:27:21,860 --> 01:27:26,860
That I feel like was one where my family just silently agreed like that summer.

1956
01:27:26,860 --> 01:27:29,860
Like, well, we can skip this one, right?

1957
01:27:29,860 --> 01:27:32,860
Like no one was jumping on that.

1958
01:27:32,860 --> 01:27:33,860
Yeah. Yeah.

1959
01:27:33,860 --> 01:27:35,860
You skipped it then.

1960
01:27:35,860 --> 01:27:40,860
Yeah. I mean, you like Grandma Auntie's Squirrel Badger Cafe.

1961
01:27:40,860 --> 01:27:42,860
She's Grandma Auntie.

1962
01:27:42,860 --> 01:27:44,860
Animals not represented.

1963
01:27:44,860 --> 01:27:45,860
Not even an animal.

1964
01:27:45,860 --> 01:27:46,860
She's a big aunt.

1965
01:27:46,860 --> 01:27:48,860
Grandma and an aunt though.

1966
01:27:48,860 --> 01:27:49,860
Of course you could.

1967
01:27:49,860 --> 01:27:50,860
I would imagine.

1968
01:27:50,860 --> 01:27:51,860
Who knows?

1969
01:27:51,860 --> 01:27:53,860
Did you like dinosaur when you went?

1970
01:27:53,860 --> 01:27:54,860
I did.

1971
01:27:54,860 --> 01:27:56,860
Dinosaur was cool.

1972
01:27:56,860 --> 01:27:59,860
Expedition Everest, very cool.

1973
01:27:59,860 --> 01:28:00,860
Sure.

1974
01:28:00,860 --> 01:28:06,860
But my favorite, favorite, favorite thing was the Kilimanjaro Safari.

1975
01:28:06,860 --> 01:28:07,860
I loved it.

1976
01:28:07,860 --> 01:28:08,860
OK. I did mention this.

1977
01:28:08,860 --> 01:28:13,860
So I was at this park with my friend who is a former Imagineer.

1978
01:28:13,860 --> 01:28:17,860
She was a very current non-Imagineer.

1979
01:28:17,860 --> 01:28:18,860
Anymore.

1980
01:28:18,860 --> 01:28:22,860
So we were hearing all the commentary from the Couture guy.

1981
01:28:22,860 --> 01:28:27,860
She was also telling me things and I was so I was so interested in one thing.

1982
01:28:27,860 --> 01:28:30,860
She had said that the giraffe, I think giraffes are so cool.

1983
01:28:30,860 --> 01:28:40,860
I mean, really, these animals are fucking crazy looking like this warthog jumps out and you're like, this is a damn pig with a damn wig on.

1984
01:28:40,860 --> 01:28:43,860
It's like a wig, a big crazy gray wig.

1985
01:28:43,860 --> 01:28:47,860
It's like shoved at the bottom of the wig bed at the UCB prop closet.

1986
01:28:47,860 --> 01:28:48,860
You know what I mean?

1987
01:28:48,860 --> 01:28:49,860
Sure.

1988
01:28:49,860 --> 01:28:51,860
Every mod team has worn that wig at one point.

1989
01:28:51,860 --> 01:28:55,860
This damn pig shoots out with a damn wig on.

1990
01:28:55,860 --> 01:28:56,860
I mean, animals are crazy.

1991
01:28:56,860 --> 01:28:57,860
Yeah.

1992
01:28:57,860 --> 01:28:59,860
And giraffes are cool.

1993
01:28:59,860 --> 01:29:12,860
And she told me that the giraffes at Disney's Animal Kingdom are some of the only giraffes in the whole world that sleep lying down because they know they are not in immediate danger.

1994
01:29:12,860 --> 01:29:13,860
Oh, wow.

1995
01:29:13,860 --> 01:29:15,860
And that made me cry.

1996
01:29:15,860 --> 01:29:22,860
And I thought that was so sweet because, you know, maybe they are in a park, but they're safe.

1997
01:29:22,860 --> 01:29:24,860
Well, they're not going to get shot.

1998
01:29:24,860 --> 01:29:26,860
They're not going to get eaten.

1999
01:29:26,860 --> 01:29:27,860
And I love that.

2000
01:29:27,860 --> 01:29:33,860
And I even quoted that in my wedding vows because I was I said something about like, I feel like a giraffe at Disney.

2001
01:29:33,860 --> 01:29:35,860
Like I'm saying it was cute.

2002
01:29:35,860 --> 01:29:36,860
That's amazing.

2003
01:29:36,860 --> 01:29:39,860
But in that moment, I like really like that really got to me.

2004
01:29:39,860 --> 01:29:41,860
You know, that's so interesting.

2005
01:29:41,860 --> 01:29:42,860
Because it's so crazy.

2006
01:29:42,860 --> 01:29:46,860
It looks like those lions are going to eat them.

2007
01:29:46,860 --> 01:29:47,860
They're five feet away.

2008
01:29:47,860 --> 01:29:50,860
You're like there's a lion on a rock right next to them.

2009
01:29:50,860 --> 01:29:53,860
But they are there's hidden barriers that we can't see.

2010
01:29:53,860 --> 01:29:57,860
I wonder if they ever go over there and sniff at those giraffes.

2011
01:29:57,860 --> 01:29:59,860
You know, it's really interesting.

2012
01:29:59,860 --> 01:30:07,860
That would be a question for like an Imagineer of what are the protocols in place for things like how fast is someone deployed?

2013
01:30:07,860 --> 01:30:10,860
What is the mechanism to deploy?

2014
01:30:10,860 --> 01:30:20,860
If someone if one wanders into a wrong spot, but they don't, I guess, you know, I mean, they because lions are only active for four hours.

2015
01:30:20,860 --> 01:30:23,860
And then the rest of the time they're sleeping.

2016
01:30:23,860 --> 01:30:25,860
Well, so it's crazy.

2017
01:30:25,860 --> 01:30:27,860
And the women are the hunters, not the men.

2018
01:30:27,860 --> 01:30:28,860
Is there?

2019
01:30:28,860 --> 01:30:29,860
Sure.

2020
01:30:29,860 --> 01:30:30,860
Sure.

2021
01:30:30,860 --> 01:30:33,860
Hey, let's say shout out to the those temperature controlled rocks.

2022
01:30:33,860 --> 01:30:35,860
Also, isn't that sweet?

2023
01:30:35,860 --> 01:30:36,860
I think that's sweet.

2024
01:30:36,860 --> 01:30:37,860
How does that work?

2025
01:30:37,860 --> 01:30:40,860
If it's cold, they do they warm the rocks and vice versa.

2026
01:30:40,860 --> 01:30:41,860
They cool them down.

2027
01:30:41,860 --> 01:30:44,860
Those are those got to go into our fake rock Hall of Fame.

2028
01:30:44,860 --> 01:30:45,860
Yeah, yeah.

2029
01:30:45,860 --> 01:30:49,860
And so, yeah, those are very special fake rocks.

2030
01:30:49,860 --> 01:30:53,860
Yeah, they have a purpose beyond making some dorks in their 30s freak out.

2031
01:30:53,860 --> 01:30:55,860
They help animals.

2032
01:30:55,860 --> 01:30:57,860
The lions lay on the rocks.

2033
01:30:57,860 --> 01:30:58,860
That's delightful.

2034
01:30:58,860 --> 01:31:01,860
It's so sweet because they really are just big old cats.

2035
01:31:01,860 --> 01:31:02,860
Yeah.

2036
01:31:02,860 --> 01:31:03,860
Yeah, sure.

2037
01:31:03,860 --> 01:31:04,860
They really are just big old cats.

2038
01:31:04,860 --> 01:31:05,860
Oh, no, go ahead.

2039
01:31:05,860 --> 01:31:09,860
I was going to say, did you all see the aquarium like the fish in the tank?

2040
01:31:09,860 --> 01:31:13,860
I think it's called the it's not at the rain forest cafe.

2041
01:31:13,860 --> 01:31:14,860
Yes.

2042
01:31:14,860 --> 01:31:16,860
Beautiful, wonderful appetizer deals.

2043
01:31:16,860 --> 01:31:18,860
No, I'm just you know, it's crazy.

2044
01:31:18,860 --> 01:31:21,860
I've never been to the rainforest cafe ever.

2045
01:31:21,860 --> 01:31:23,860
There was one in Dallas and it was so popular.

2046
01:31:23,860 --> 01:31:27,860
There was a line out the place and I was just like, I don't like lines.

2047
01:31:27,860 --> 01:31:28,860
Oh, yeah.

2048
01:31:28,860 --> 01:31:29,860
This is the wrong topic.

2049
01:31:29,860 --> 01:31:31,860
I haven't been to.

2050
01:31:31,860 --> 01:31:34,860
I haven't been to the Navi Avatar land.

2051
01:31:34,860 --> 01:31:35,860
Satuli.

2052
01:31:35,860 --> 01:31:37,860
I'm not going to stand in line for two fucking hours.

2053
01:31:37,860 --> 01:31:39,860
I'm 34 years old.

2054
01:31:39,860 --> 01:31:40,860
I don't care.

2055
01:31:40,860 --> 01:31:41,860
You know what I mean?

2056
01:31:41,860 --> 01:31:43,860
Like, I can't think of anything.

2057
01:31:43,860 --> 01:31:44,860
Mike, counterpoint.

2058
01:31:44,860 --> 01:31:45,860
Counterpoint.

2059
01:31:45,860 --> 01:31:49,860
Briding on the back of the mighty Akron is something that you never forget.

2060
01:31:49,860 --> 01:31:54,860
It is a journey that people literally gasped after they were done when we went out the first

2061
01:31:54,860 --> 01:31:55,860
time.

2062
01:31:55,860 --> 01:31:58,860
Very emotional and I would argue very emotional.

2063
01:31:58,860 --> 01:32:02,860
Very emotional and I would argue very worth two hours.

2064
01:32:02,860 --> 01:32:03,860
Really?

2065
01:32:03,860 --> 01:32:04,860
The Avatar?

2066
01:32:04,860 --> 01:32:05,860
I would.

2067
01:32:05,860 --> 01:32:06,860
Yeah.

2068
01:32:06,860 --> 01:32:07,860
Wow.

2069
01:32:07,860 --> 01:32:08,860
See, that's really interesting.

2070
01:32:08,860 --> 01:32:09,860
That's good to hear.

2071
01:32:09,860 --> 01:32:12,860
You know, I waited in line for Blink 182 to be the very first person in.

2072
01:32:12,860 --> 01:32:13,860
I did that.

2073
01:32:13,860 --> 01:32:15,860
Was that the recent concert or before?

2074
01:32:15,860 --> 01:32:16,860
Yeah, the one in Vegas.

2075
01:32:16,860 --> 01:32:17,860
So you were up in the front of the pit.

2076
01:32:17,860 --> 01:32:19,860
I was at the very front, right?

2077
01:32:19,860 --> 01:32:20,860
Under Mark.

2078
01:32:20,860 --> 01:32:22,860
How is the mosh pit now at that?

2079
01:32:22,860 --> 01:32:23,860
And what's the age group?

2080
01:32:23,860 --> 01:32:24,860
Zero.

2081
01:32:24,860 --> 01:32:25,860
Zero mosh pit.

2082
01:32:25,860 --> 01:32:26,860
People our age?

2083
01:32:26,860 --> 01:32:27,860
They don't let you mosh.

2084
01:32:27,860 --> 01:32:28,860
Oh, interesting.

2085
01:32:28,860 --> 01:32:29,860
They didn't at this particular event.

2086
01:32:29,860 --> 01:32:31,860
I mean, you're in the casino.

2087
01:32:31,860 --> 01:32:32,860
Right, right.

2088
01:32:32,860 --> 01:32:33,860
You're in the palms.

2089
01:32:33,860 --> 01:32:36,860
But is it people in their 30s?

2090
01:32:36,860 --> 01:32:37,860
Yeah.

2091
01:32:37,860 --> 01:32:38,860
Yeah, okay.

2092
01:32:38,860 --> 01:32:40,860
Next to me was like a chick my age.

2093
01:32:40,860 --> 01:32:42,860
It's all kind of our age, people.

2094
01:32:42,860 --> 01:32:47,860
I was shocked because I saw a replacements concert a couple years ago and there's all

2095
01:32:47,860 --> 01:32:51,860
people older than me because that was a band that was popular when I was not born or very,

2096
01:32:51,860 --> 01:32:52,860
very little.

2097
01:32:52,860 --> 01:32:53,860
Yeah.

2098
01:32:53,860 --> 01:32:55,860
I don't even know what that band is, I'm embarrassed to say.

2099
01:32:55,860 --> 01:33:00,860
Oh, well they're like a cool, they're like a culty, a cool band, but they're really,

2100
01:33:00,860 --> 01:33:01,860
really good.

2101
01:33:01,860 --> 01:33:03,860
I think that the hype is not too much for them.

2102
01:33:03,860 --> 01:33:04,860
They're really great.

2103
01:33:04,860 --> 01:33:09,860
But they reformed and there were a lot of baby boomer types there and all of a sudden

2104
01:33:09,860 --> 01:33:13,860
they started, there's like a group that started like moshing.

2105
01:33:13,860 --> 01:33:18,860
So like dads were like smacking into each other and then like some dads were mad at

2106
01:33:18,860 --> 01:33:19,860
the dads moshing.

2107
01:33:19,860 --> 01:33:20,860
Yeah.

2108
01:33:20,860 --> 01:33:22,860
And it was a whole like scene developed at the palladium.

2109
01:33:23,860 --> 01:33:25,860
I was like, what the hell's going on here?

2110
01:33:25,860 --> 01:33:26,860
I love that.

2111
01:33:26,860 --> 01:33:32,860
When I saw Blink at the forum a couple years ago, there were kids sitting in front of me

2112
01:33:32,860 --> 01:33:38,860
and they knew every word and they were probably 16, which is when I, how old I was when I

2113
01:33:38,860 --> 01:33:39,860
saw Blink in concert.

2114
01:33:39,860 --> 01:33:40,860
Sure.

2115
01:33:40,860 --> 01:33:44,860
So because of YouTube and stuff, fandom has grown into all genres for everything.

2116
01:33:44,860 --> 01:33:45,860
Right.

2117
01:33:45,860 --> 01:33:47,860
But y'all, we, did y'all go to Ringo last year?

2118
01:33:47,860 --> 01:33:48,860
No.

2119
01:33:48,860 --> 01:33:49,860
Okay.

2120
01:33:49,860 --> 01:33:50,860
Y'all went to two years before?

2121
01:33:50,860 --> 01:33:51,860
Yes.

2122
01:33:51,860 --> 01:33:55,860
We saw, we saw the lineup with the Todd Rundgren, Richard Page.

2123
01:33:55,860 --> 01:33:58,860
Who else is an all star?

2124
01:33:58,860 --> 01:33:59,860
Richard Page.

2125
01:33:59,860 --> 01:34:00,860
God, what an angel.

2126
01:34:00,860 --> 01:34:01,860
Hell yeah.

2127
01:34:01,860 --> 01:34:03,860
Richard, Richard Page, that ties it back together.

2128
01:34:03,860 --> 01:34:05,860
Richard Page sings America.

2129
01:34:05,860 --> 01:34:07,860
Spend your golden way.

2130
01:34:07,860 --> 01:34:09,860
That guy from the Ringo band, the singer of Mr.

2131
01:34:09,860 --> 01:34:13,860
Mister is sings the American Adventure Epcot song.

2132
01:34:13,860 --> 01:34:14,860
Oh my God.

2133
01:34:14,860 --> 01:34:15,860
I didn't know that.

2134
01:34:15,860 --> 01:34:16,860
There you go.

2135
01:34:16,860 --> 01:34:17,860
Ringo was repping Disney.

2136
01:34:17,860 --> 01:34:19,860
That should be on the account.

2137
01:34:19,860 --> 01:34:21,860
Post a picture of Ringo and Richard Page.

2138
01:34:21,860 --> 01:34:23,860
More all star content please.

2139
01:34:23,860 --> 01:34:27,860
That man has the voice of a fucking angel.

2140
01:34:27,860 --> 01:34:29,860
Again, I was very high.

2141
01:34:29,860 --> 01:34:36,860
I was weeping during his songs because I don't believe in God, but that made me believe in God.

2142
01:34:36,860 --> 01:34:38,860
I was like, this person is blessed.

2143
01:34:38,860 --> 01:34:39,860
The vocals of Richard Page?

2144
01:34:39,860 --> 01:34:40,860
Are you kidding me?

2145
01:34:40,860 --> 01:34:41,860
Wow.

2146
01:34:41,860 --> 01:34:45,860
He's an older man, but he sounds like he's 20.

2147
01:34:45,860 --> 01:34:46,860
You're talking like QT.

2148
01:34:46,860 --> 01:34:47,860
You sound like QA, a lazen.

2149
01:34:47,860 --> 01:34:48,860
Yes.

2150
01:34:48,860 --> 01:34:49,860
Broken wings.

2151
01:34:49,860 --> 01:34:50,860
Broken wings.

2152
01:34:50,860 --> 01:34:51,860
Check out his solo album.

2153
01:34:51,860 --> 01:34:56,860
Check out OCOE from his band, Pages in the 70s.

2154
01:34:56,860 --> 01:34:57,860
I'll cut myself off now.

2155
01:34:57,860 --> 01:34:58,860
I'll never stop talking.

2156
01:34:58,860 --> 01:34:59,860
I'm impressed.

2157
01:34:59,860 --> 01:35:00,860
OCOE.

2158
01:35:00,860 --> 01:35:01,860
Check it out.

2159
01:35:01,860 --> 01:35:02,860
But anyway.

2160
01:35:02,860 --> 01:35:03,860
He's amazing.

2161
01:35:03,860 --> 01:35:04,860
Yeah.

2162
01:35:04,860 --> 01:35:08,860
And y'all need to see Ringo and the all star band if they come through town ever.

2163
01:35:08,860 --> 01:35:09,860
It was a best concert.

2164
01:35:09,860 --> 01:35:11,860
Hey, theme park fans, check out Ringo and the all star band.

2165
01:35:11,860 --> 01:35:13,860
That was what happened to me in that concert.

2166
01:35:13,860 --> 01:35:14,860
Yeah.

2167
01:35:14,860 --> 01:35:16,860
He's in this deep, not famous culty band called Pages.

2168
01:35:16,860 --> 01:35:17,860
They're not even culty.

2169
01:35:17,860 --> 01:35:18,860
They're so obscure.

2170
01:35:18,860 --> 01:35:20,860
This band, Pages, and he was setting up one of his songs, one of his Mr.

2171
01:35:20,860 --> 01:35:21,860
Mr. songs.

2172
01:35:21,860 --> 01:35:23,860
And you know, I used to be in a band called Pages.

2173
01:35:23,860 --> 01:35:24,860
Woo.

2174
01:35:24,860 --> 01:35:25,860
Me only.

2175
01:35:25,860 --> 01:35:27,860
In the entire Greek theater.

2176
01:35:27,860 --> 01:35:28,860
One person.

2177
01:35:28,860 --> 01:35:29,860
And everyone's old too.

2178
01:35:29,860 --> 01:35:32,860
Like everyone had many more years to know that.

2179
01:35:32,860 --> 01:35:33,860
Yeah.

2180
01:35:33,860 --> 01:35:34,860
And absorb it.

2181
01:35:34,860 --> 01:35:35,860
Even more sad.

2182
01:35:35,860 --> 01:35:36,860
And they did not.

2183
01:35:36,860 --> 01:35:39,860
And I'm, yes, somehow me in my 30s, I'm the only person giving him love on this.

2184
01:35:39,860 --> 01:35:41,860
I'm going to look that band up now.

2185
01:35:41,860 --> 01:35:42,860
Please check out Pages.

2186
01:35:42,860 --> 01:35:43,860
His voice is incredible.

2187
01:35:43,860 --> 01:35:44,860
I mean, it moved me.

2188
01:35:44,860 --> 01:35:45,860
Oh, you're all saying the whole Pages thing.

2189
01:35:45,860 --> 01:35:52,860
I missed him this last round when Ringo was back in LA last year.

2190
01:35:52,860 --> 01:35:54,860
He wasn't in the band anymore and I was bummed.

2191
01:35:54,860 --> 01:35:55,860
Oh, he's out of the band?

2192
01:35:55,860 --> 01:35:56,860
He was this round.

2193
01:35:56,860 --> 01:35:57,860
Yeah.

2194
01:35:57,860 --> 01:35:58,860
It was still a great show.

2195
01:35:58,860 --> 01:36:00,860
The men at work guy is now in it.

2196
01:36:00,860 --> 01:36:01,860
Oh, he was in it a long time.

2197
01:36:01,860 --> 01:36:02,860
Colin Hay.

2198
01:36:02,860 --> 01:36:03,860
He was great.

2199
01:36:03,860 --> 01:36:04,860
He's lost in and out of the All-Star band.

2200
01:36:04,860 --> 01:36:05,860
He was great.

2201
01:36:05,860 --> 01:36:13,860
I did a whole bonus episode of my show, Natch Butte, which is a fucking makeup podcast about

2202
01:36:13,860 --> 01:36:14,860
Ringo starring the All-Star band.

2203
01:36:14,860 --> 01:36:15,860
That's how passionate I was about this.

2204
01:36:15,860 --> 01:36:16,860
Oh, yeah, I listened to it.

2205
01:36:16,860 --> 01:36:21,860
It was a bonus episode I did and I started crying because Ringo has overcome so much.

2206
01:36:21,860 --> 01:36:23,860
He almost died as a child.

2207
01:36:23,860 --> 01:36:26,860
Couldn't read, was poor and look at him now.

2208
01:36:26,860 --> 01:36:27,860
He's flourishing.

2209
01:36:27,860 --> 01:36:29,860
He's truly inspiring.

2210
01:36:29,860 --> 01:36:33,860
He's not signing autographs, but other than that, he's living by the face I love to go

2211
01:36:33,860 --> 01:36:34,860
back to the...

2212
01:36:34,860 --> 01:36:35,860
But you know why he doesn't sign autographs?

2213
01:36:35,860 --> 01:36:38,860
Because they would end up on eBay and he would rather sign things that he knows are going

2214
01:36:38,860 --> 01:36:39,860
to go to charity.

2215
01:36:39,860 --> 01:36:40,860
So he only signs things for charity now.

2216
01:36:41,860 --> 01:36:42,860
He should have said...

2217
01:36:42,860 --> 01:36:45,860
He was saying that it was an angry moment, he said, when he made that video.

2218
01:36:45,860 --> 01:36:48,860
Yeah, because he was mad because he saw Gattari sign it up on eBay.

2219
01:36:48,860 --> 01:36:51,860
He explained it on Howard Stern.

2220
01:36:51,860 --> 01:36:55,860
Okay, so no deforestation.

2221
01:36:55,860 --> 01:36:59,860
Be careful with our animals and don't sell Ringo's merch.

2222
01:36:59,860 --> 01:37:00,860
And no more autographs.

2223
01:37:00,860 --> 01:37:01,860
Peace and love.

2224
01:37:01,860 --> 01:37:02,860
Peace and love.

2225
01:37:02,860 --> 01:37:03,860
Peace and love.

2226
01:37:03,860 --> 01:37:09,860
This episode is really like one of the circuitous tracks and trails you can take around the

2227
01:37:09,860 --> 01:37:10,860
animal kingdom.

2228
01:37:10,860 --> 01:37:13,860
Well look, we're going to break off on these rides.

2229
01:37:13,860 --> 01:37:14,860
Please, just individually.

2230
01:37:14,860 --> 01:37:16,860
In fact, here's a little tease.

2231
01:37:16,860 --> 01:37:21,860
I think we can say we're soon going to do an episode about one of the shows.

2232
01:37:21,860 --> 01:37:26,860
And I don't want to say what show, but we don't have time to go into it because there's

2233
01:37:26,860 --> 01:37:27,860
so much to get in there.

2234
01:37:27,860 --> 01:37:30,860
I mean, it's got two worlds and one family.

2235
01:37:30,860 --> 01:37:33,860
How can we possibly fit this into an already two hour episode?

2236
01:37:33,860 --> 01:37:38,860
I'm excited to learn what this is because I have forgotten in this moment.

2237
01:37:38,860 --> 01:37:40,860
Even Jason doesn't know.

2238
01:37:40,860 --> 01:37:41,860
Oh boy, get ready.

2239
01:37:41,860 --> 01:37:42,860
Buckle up everybody.

2240
01:37:42,860 --> 01:37:46,860
But hey, what do we fit in before we wrap it up?

2241
01:37:46,860 --> 01:37:48,860
I got a roadie thing.

2242
01:37:48,860 --> 01:37:49,860
Yeah.

2243
01:37:49,860 --> 01:37:50,860
Joe Roadie.

2244
01:37:50,860 --> 01:37:56,860
Yeah, so I kind of was wondering about why does everything look Asian?

2245
01:37:56,860 --> 01:38:00,860
Especially in the continent of Asia.

2246
01:38:00,860 --> 01:38:05,860
There's so much of Asia that looks like Blade Runner, that looks like the future.

2247
01:38:05,860 --> 01:38:11,860
And I was trying to figure out why all this older looking things.

2248
01:38:11,860 --> 01:38:14,860
And of course, Joe Roadie is on record.

2249
01:38:14,860 --> 01:38:19,860
They reached out to local craftsmen, they'd carve animal statues and do roof work, and

2250
01:38:19,860 --> 01:38:21,860
they learned how they built buildings.

2251
01:38:21,860 --> 01:38:23,860
We talked about that on the Everest one.

2252
01:38:23,860 --> 01:38:33,860
And he has a very interesting quote about aging, which was the idea behind it of making

2253
01:38:33,860 --> 01:38:36,860
everything look older.

2254
01:38:36,860 --> 01:38:40,860
And I'm lost.

2255
01:38:40,860 --> 01:38:42,860
I know I swiped it.

2256
01:38:42,860 --> 01:38:45,860
Okay, we created this motif of age of erosion.

2257
01:38:45,860 --> 01:38:49,860
It reminds us that no matter how great our efforts, nature is the most powerful force

2258
01:38:49,860 --> 01:38:51,860
around us and we should respect it.

2259
01:38:51,860 --> 01:38:53,860
It's almost a moral tale.

2260
01:38:53,860 --> 01:39:00,860
So I think that is very fascinating to look at the park through that lens and see, oh yeah,

2261
01:39:00,860 --> 01:39:07,860
the park, the nature of the park just keeps growing, but everything has rust painted on

2262
01:39:07,860 --> 01:39:10,860
or faded elements to it.

2263
01:39:10,860 --> 01:39:17,860
So it's always reminding you of the temporary nature of our structures, but the nature itself

2264
01:39:17,860 --> 01:39:20,860
will keep thriving.

2265
01:39:20,860 --> 01:39:21,860
This is great.

2266
01:39:21,860 --> 01:39:26,860
Hey, Joe Roadie, as we've said a little bit before, this is kind of the culmination of

2267
01:39:26,860 --> 01:39:29,860
his aesthetic at this point.

2268
01:39:29,860 --> 01:39:35,860
The park in general was this guy, Avatar is this guy, Expedition Everest.

2269
01:39:35,860 --> 01:39:37,860
He's a legend.

2270
01:39:37,860 --> 01:39:40,860
Did you go on the Tower of Terror in Tokyo?

2271
01:39:40,860 --> 01:39:41,860
Hell yes.

2272
01:39:41,860 --> 01:39:42,860
Twice.

2273
01:39:42,860 --> 01:39:44,860
Do you know the character they have, Harrison Hightower?

2274
01:39:44,860 --> 01:39:49,860
That's modeled after, imagine, Joe Roadie, who's a very earthy guy, so it's a Joe Roadie

2275
01:39:49,860 --> 01:39:52,860
guy, so it's a joke that he's this crazy capitalist monster.

2276
01:39:52,860 --> 01:39:55,860
Oh, so it's playing against type.

2277
01:39:55,860 --> 01:39:57,860
Scott, you don't know about the Tower of Terror.

2278
01:39:57,860 --> 01:40:01,860
I know about generally Harrison Hightower, but I don't know the story.

2279
01:40:01,860 --> 01:40:02,860
It's so fantastic.

2280
01:40:02,860 --> 01:40:03,860
It's really cool.

2281
01:40:03,860 --> 01:40:04,860
It's really cool.

2282
01:40:04,860 --> 01:40:05,860
If I get up the nerve to do it.

2283
01:40:05,860 --> 01:40:06,860
At least go to the line.

2284
01:40:06,860 --> 01:40:07,860
At least do the queue.

2285
01:40:07,860 --> 01:40:08,860
Oh wait, you don't like drop rides?

2286
01:40:08,860 --> 01:40:09,860
I'm in no drop.

2287
01:40:09,860 --> 01:40:10,860
Yeah, I hear that.

2288
01:40:10,860 --> 01:40:11,860
I've started doing the launch.

2289
01:40:11,860 --> 01:40:12,860
I've come around on the launch.

2290
01:40:12,860 --> 01:40:13,860
It's going to be hard.

2291
01:40:13,860 --> 01:40:14,860
It's going to be hard, still.

2292
01:40:14,860 --> 01:40:17,860
It'll be hard, though, if you're in the line, you're trying to explain to somebody who doesn't

2293
01:40:17,860 --> 01:40:18,860
speak English, like I'm just doing the queue.

2294
01:40:18,860 --> 01:40:19,860
I thought about this.

2295
01:40:19,860 --> 01:40:20,860
Right, right, right.

2296
01:40:20,860 --> 01:40:21,860
And they're like, right this way.

2297
01:40:21,860 --> 01:40:22,860
And you're like, ah, the exit.

2298
01:40:22,860 --> 01:40:23,860
And then you're on the ride.

2299
01:40:23,860 --> 01:40:26,860
I think you can pull it off.

2300
01:40:26,860 --> 01:40:28,860
But it's a little less scary than current Guardians.

2301
01:40:28,860 --> 01:40:29,860
Correct.

2302
01:40:29,860 --> 01:40:31,860
I have not been on it, to be honest.

2303
01:40:31,860 --> 01:40:33,860
Well, no, I guess you know what it is.

2304
01:40:33,860 --> 01:40:35,860
There's a, I'm trying to think.

2305
01:40:35,860 --> 01:40:39,860
There's a couple months now where they do a bunch more drops.

2306
01:40:39,860 --> 01:40:43,860
What we found on it was that it was too short for us.

2307
01:40:43,860 --> 01:40:47,860
It felt like the original Tower of Terror ride profile.

2308
01:40:47,860 --> 01:40:49,860
And it felt like 90 seconds or a minute.

2309
01:40:49,860 --> 01:40:51,860
And we're like, that's it?

2310
01:40:51,860 --> 01:40:58,860
So then apparently there's a couple months when they try to attract like teenagers to come to the park where it's like called like something more, blah, blah, blah.

2311
01:40:58,860 --> 01:41:03,860
And it's more change up ride profiles and it's more drops and stuff.

2312
01:41:03,860 --> 01:41:05,860
And it seems like it's, but I don't know if that's happening now.

2313
01:41:05,860 --> 01:41:06,860
I swear.

2314
01:41:06,860 --> 01:41:07,860
Teenagers love to drop.

2315
01:41:07,860 --> 01:41:08,860
But I was like so mad.

2316
01:41:08,860 --> 01:41:10,860
It's fine there during the teen months.

2317
01:41:10,860 --> 01:41:12,860
I think it's all teen specific.

2318
01:41:12,860 --> 01:41:14,860
These teens will be the death of me.

2319
01:41:14,860 --> 01:41:16,860
But you have to see the pre-show and everything.

2320
01:41:16,860 --> 01:41:19,860
And just the queue itself is unbelievable.

2321
01:41:19,860 --> 01:41:24,860
At the very least, once you get to like the loading area, just like run backwards and like.

2322
01:41:24,860 --> 01:41:26,860
I bet there's some kind of exit area.

2323
01:41:26,860 --> 01:41:27,860
There has to be.

2324
01:41:27,860 --> 01:41:28,860
There has to be, yeah.

2325
01:41:28,860 --> 01:41:31,860
Or just have your like translator out and says like, I need to leave.

2326
01:41:31,860 --> 01:41:32,860
They'll know enough.

2327
01:41:32,860 --> 01:41:35,860
I pissed my pants here.

2328
01:41:35,860 --> 01:41:36,860
What does this say?

2329
01:41:36,860 --> 01:41:37,860
They shut the ride down.

2330
01:41:37,860 --> 01:41:40,860
That translator app doesn't work that well.

2331
01:41:40,860 --> 01:41:44,860
I got into a weird thing with a girl and I wish I could remember it.

2332
01:41:44,860 --> 01:41:49,860
She showed it to me and it said like lion lubricant or something.

2333
01:41:49,860 --> 01:41:50,860
I was like, what?

2334
01:41:50,860 --> 01:41:53,860
And she was trying to tell me that I had my shirt on inside out.

2335
01:41:53,860 --> 01:41:54,860
My tag was out.

2336
01:41:56,860 --> 01:41:59,860
It was because she translated Japanese to show it to me in English.

2337
01:41:59,860 --> 01:42:01,860
And I was like, oh, thank.

2338
01:42:01,860 --> 01:42:02,860
I didn't know what the fuck she showed me.

2339
01:42:02,860 --> 01:42:04,860
I was like, Adam, it just said lion lubricant.

2340
01:42:04,860 --> 01:42:05,860
I was like, what?

2341
01:42:05,860 --> 01:42:07,860
I just go like smile.

2342
01:42:07,860 --> 01:42:08,860
I didn't know what she was trying to tell me.

2343
01:42:08,860 --> 01:42:09,860
Yeah.

2344
01:42:09,860 --> 01:42:11,860
We had some success with it, but it wasn't perfect.

2345
01:42:11,860 --> 01:42:12,860
Yeah.

2346
01:42:12,860 --> 01:42:16,860
I'm trying to go through just like last anything I wanted to get in.

2347
01:42:16,860 --> 01:42:18,860
There's probably a lot more we could talk about with the beastly kingdom.

2348
01:42:18,860 --> 01:42:20,860
We've alluded to a little.

2349
01:42:20,860 --> 01:42:24,860
There's supposed to be a mythological world that was kind of too expensive to get built.

2350
01:42:24,860 --> 01:42:26,860
Avatar sort of in its place now.

2351
01:42:26,860 --> 01:42:29,860
That's what represents the fantastical side of nature.

2352
01:42:29,860 --> 01:42:34,860
And that was going to be the thrilling more like kind of element that some people thought was lacking where you'd get a crazy ride.

2353
01:42:34,860 --> 01:42:35,860
Roller coaster there.

2354
01:42:35,860 --> 01:42:36,860
Right.

2355
01:42:36,860 --> 01:42:37,860
Yeah.

2356
01:42:37,860 --> 01:42:38,860
Really good road.

2357
01:42:38,860 --> 01:42:39,860
Now there's Everest.

2358
01:42:39,860 --> 01:42:40,860
But there was not a big thrill ride.

2359
01:42:40,860 --> 01:42:52,860
There was in his dedication of the park mentions like a land of all animals from, you know, lions to dinosaurs to dragons and stuff like men like tips it like previews it.

2360
01:42:52,860 --> 01:42:55,860
And then dragons are in the logo too.

2361
01:42:55,860 --> 01:42:56,860
Yeah.

2362
01:42:56,860 --> 01:43:03,860
It's a very like the Hakuna Matata silhouettes of animals walking in a line and right in the middle is a dragon.

2363
01:43:03,860 --> 01:43:04,860
Where's that dragon?

2364
01:43:04,860 --> 01:43:06,860
And try to get a dragon out of that boat ride.

2365
01:43:06,860 --> 01:43:09,860
And I don't think I forget if it got built or not.

2366
01:43:09,860 --> 01:43:10,860
Yeah.

2367
01:43:10,860 --> 01:43:11,860
But it's been removed if there ever was one.

2368
01:43:11,860 --> 01:43:14,860
But I think it's interesting that there was Camp Mini Mickey.

2369
01:43:14,860 --> 01:43:17,860
That was another land, another land that sounds odd.

2370
01:43:17,860 --> 01:43:19,860
And that was always meant to be temporary.

2371
01:43:19,860 --> 01:43:21,860
They're like, yeah, we're going to put something better here.

2372
01:43:21,860 --> 01:43:24,860
And I believe that's where Pandora is now.

2373
01:43:24,860 --> 01:43:25,860
We'll do it.

2374
01:43:25,860 --> 01:43:26,860
We'll break off.

2375
01:43:26,860 --> 01:43:29,860
That'll be the sleepiest second episode.

2376
01:43:29,860 --> 01:43:32,860
How many of you have been on the Pandora thing?

2377
01:43:32,860 --> 01:43:33,860
Just Mike.

2378
01:43:33,860 --> 01:43:34,860
Just me.

2379
01:43:34,860 --> 01:43:35,860
OK.

2380
01:43:35,860 --> 01:43:36,860
So we don't.

2381
01:43:36,860 --> 01:43:37,860
Yeah, we got to we got to build up to that.

2382
01:43:37,860 --> 01:43:38,860
We're not qualified.

2383
01:43:38,860 --> 01:43:39,860
We can't do that episode yet.

2384
01:43:39,860 --> 01:43:41,860
We haven't wept the tears that Mike is wet.

2385
01:43:41,860 --> 01:43:42,860
Right.

2386
01:43:42,860 --> 01:43:49,860
And but they I have faith that my co-host will Sivako rise to the challenge.

2387
01:43:50,860 --> 01:43:55,860
With cushioned insoles to withstand the standing in the line for it.

2388
01:43:55,860 --> 01:43:56,860
Even with a fast pass.

2389
01:43:56,860 --> 01:43:57,860
Yes, of course.

2390
01:43:57,860 --> 01:44:01,860
Let me say this fact that I learned about this dragon roller coaster that was supposed

2391
01:44:01,860 --> 01:44:02,860
to be built.

2392
01:44:02,860 --> 01:44:06,860
The the synopsis of the plot is very odd to me.

2393
01:44:06,860 --> 01:44:10,860
Well, you know, there's the good side of Beastly Kingdom in which you meet a unicorn.

2394
01:44:10,860 --> 01:44:16,860
And then there's the bad side, the evil side dominated by Dragon Tower, a ruined castle

2395
01:44:16,860 --> 01:44:21,860
home to a greedy fire breathing dragon who hoarded a fabulous treasure in the tower.

2396
01:44:21,860 --> 01:44:23,860
So it's a money.

2397
01:44:23,860 --> 01:44:24,860
Stealing dragon.

2398
01:44:24,860 --> 01:44:25,860
Grubby dragon.

2399
01:44:25,860 --> 01:44:27,860
He knows about money and takes money.

2400
01:44:27,860 --> 01:44:30,860
But also blatantly the plot of The Hobbit.

2401
01:44:30,860 --> 01:44:31,860
Oh, yeah.

2402
01:44:31,860 --> 01:44:36,860
This is their way to do like an off brand like without paying the money.

2403
01:44:36,860 --> 01:44:38,860
The Tolkien money.

2404
01:44:38,860 --> 01:44:45,860
The castle was also inhabited by bats who planned to rob the dragon of his riches.

2405
01:44:45,860 --> 01:44:46,860
Got it.

2406
01:44:46,860 --> 01:44:47,860
Dragon stole money.

2407
01:44:47,860 --> 01:44:49,860
Bats want to steal it back.

2408
01:44:49,860 --> 01:44:53,860
That would have been so cute to see little bats with like one little doubloon in their

2409
01:44:53,860 --> 01:44:54,860
feet.

2410
01:44:54,860 --> 01:44:55,860
Yeah, little Bill.

2411
01:44:55,860 --> 01:44:56,860
Little rubies.

2412
01:44:56,860 --> 01:45:01,860
One little ruby in its claw.

2413
01:45:01,860 --> 01:45:06,860
You the bats were to enlist us, the guests help in their scheme.

2414
01:45:06,860 --> 01:45:10,860
And so I think you were going to ride in a bat.

2415
01:45:10,860 --> 01:45:12,860
The vehicle was a bat.

2416
01:45:12,860 --> 01:45:15,860
I saw a concept art that seems to support this.

2417
01:45:15,860 --> 01:45:16,860
So, yeah.

2418
01:45:16,860 --> 01:45:18,860
So you are right.

2419
01:45:18,860 --> 01:45:19,860
Well, we're us.

2420
01:45:19,860 --> 01:45:20,860
You're I'm me.

2421
01:45:20,860 --> 01:45:24,860
And I met a bat who wants to rob a dragon who robbed other humans.

2422
01:45:24,860 --> 01:45:25,860
Got it.

2423
01:45:25,860 --> 01:45:26,860
Great.

2424
01:45:26,860 --> 01:45:27,860
Let's go get that money back.

2425
01:45:27,860 --> 01:45:30,860
Rob from an animal and give to another animal.

2426
01:45:30,860 --> 01:45:32,860
Does the unicorn ever come back?

2427
01:45:32,860 --> 01:45:33,860
I don't know.

2428
01:45:33,860 --> 01:45:34,860
Bats do.

2429
01:45:34,860 --> 01:45:35,860
I don't know.

2430
01:45:35,860 --> 01:45:36,860
Are they cutting me in?

2431
01:45:36,860 --> 01:45:37,860
Why am I helping the bats?

2432
01:45:37,860 --> 01:45:38,860
Oh, the unicorn was a different ride.

2433
01:45:38,860 --> 01:45:39,860
Yeah.

2434
01:45:39,860 --> 01:45:40,860
You met a unicorn in a maze.

2435
01:45:40,860 --> 01:45:41,860
Yeah.

2436
01:45:41,860 --> 01:45:42,860
I can't quite talk to you.

2437
01:45:42,860 --> 01:45:43,860
Unicorns.

2438
01:45:43,860 --> 01:45:44,860
Oh, right.

2439
01:45:44,860 --> 01:45:45,860
Through the vibrations.

2440
01:45:45,860 --> 01:45:46,860
I heard that on your last episode.

2441
01:45:46,860 --> 01:45:47,860
Yeah.

2442
01:45:47,860 --> 01:45:48,860
Yeah.

2443
01:45:48,860 --> 01:45:49,860
That's very dolphin.

2444
01:45:49,860 --> 01:45:53,620
That seems like a very sonar sort of I think.

2445
01:45:53,620 --> 01:45:55,700
And I'm creeped out by dolphin sonar.

2446
01:45:55,700 --> 01:45:58,940
And thus I'm also creeped out by unicorn vibrations.

2447
01:45:58,940 --> 01:46:03,300
When you said when you described that last time, I was like, oh, I don't like this unicorn.

2448
01:46:03,300 --> 01:46:05,300
I would have been interested to see what they did, though.

2449
01:46:05,300 --> 01:46:06,500
I bet it could have been cool.

2450
01:46:06,500 --> 01:46:07,500
Yeah.

2451
01:46:08,140 --> 01:46:12,940
There was also supposed to be like a Fantasia kind of boat ride with like animal scenes

2452
01:46:12,940 --> 01:46:15,780
from like the same Fantasia segments.

2453
01:46:15,780 --> 01:46:20,740
I wonder how much of that was like, oh, Fantasia 2000 did not do well.

2454
01:46:20,740 --> 01:46:22,180
So put that one back in the drawer.

2455
01:46:22,180 --> 01:46:26,140
People didn't want to do the graduation march as a ride with.

2456
01:46:26,140 --> 01:46:27,140
Have you seen that segment?

2457
01:46:27,140 --> 01:46:28,140
Is that?

2458
01:46:28,140 --> 01:46:31,220
It's Donald Duck is Noah and he's leading all the animals under the boat and it's to

2459
01:46:31,220 --> 01:46:33,180
the graduation theme.

2460
01:46:33,180 --> 01:46:35,940
And Disney's trying to say, well, you know, that piece existed before.

2461
01:46:35,940 --> 01:46:39,900
It's only we recently who have made it the graduation song.

2462
01:46:39,900 --> 01:46:43,580
But it actually is a piece that like no, no, no, it's the graduation song.

2463
01:46:43,580 --> 01:46:46,580
Well, it makes you feel like why are these these animals are graduating?

2464
01:46:46,580 --> 01:46:48,740
We're at an animal graduation.

2465
01:46:48,740 --> 01:46:50,540
What do you mean graduation song?

2466
01:46:50,540 --> 01:46:51,540
Vitamin C?

2467
01:46:51,540 --> 01:46:56,540
Oh, I also was thinking about vitamin C. I don't know.

2468
01:46:56,540 --> 01:46:58,580
But as we go on.

2469
01:46:58,580 --> 01:47:03,860
Vitamin C, listener of the show, Kia Burton is in the music video for our good friend

2470
01:47:04,100 --> 01:47:09,140
is the in the music video for she's in the kids choir.

2471
01:47:09,140 --> 01:47:11,300
That is vitamin C Friends Forever music.

2472
01:47:11,300 --> 01:47:13,260
That better be in the Twitter bio.

2473
01:47:13,260 --> 01:47:14,260
That's such an iconic.

2474
01:47:14,260 --> 01:47:15,260
Yeah, that is more.

2475
01:47:15,260 --> 01:47:16,260
I'm kind of outing this.

2476
01:47:16,260 --> 01:47:20,020
I don't know if she was trying to bury this fact.

2477
01:47:20,020 --> 01:47:21,500
Have you ever seen vitamin C in concert?

2478
01:47:21,500 --> 01:47:22,500
I haven't.

2479
01:47:22,500 --> 01:47:23,500
No, neither.

2480
01:47:23,500 --> 01:47:24,500
I don't know where she's at.

2481
01:47:24,500 --> 01:47:25,500
I don't know what she's up to.

2482
01:47:25,500 --> 01:47:26,500
Good Halloween costume.

2483
01:47:26,500 --> 01:47:27,500
Die the hair.

2484
01:47:27,500 --> 01:47:28,500
Yep.

2485
01:47:28,500 --> 01:47:29,500
Yep.

2486
01:47:29,500 --> 01:47:30,500
Well, now everybody has orange hair.

2487
01:47:30,500 --> 01:47:31,500
You know, is that true?

2488
01:47:31,500 --> 01:47:32,500
Everyone has.

2489
01:47:33,460 --> 01:47:34,460
Brightly colored hair.

2490
01:47:34,460 --> 01:47:35,460
Everyone went to Japan.

2491
01:47:35,460 --> 01:47:36,460
That's true.

2492
01:47:36,460 --> 01:47:37,460
They go hand in hand.

2493
01:47:37,460 --> 01:47:40,260
Yeah, I wanted to say real quick.

2494
01:47:40,260 --> 01:47:43,860
Did you ride the Beaver Brothers Explorer canoes in Japan?

2495
01:47:43,860 --> 01:47:44,860
No.

2496
01:47:44,860 --> 01:47:47,940
Well, something I did that you didn't take that grandma.

2497
01:47:47,940 --> 01:47:50,660
You skunk weasel cafe.

2498
01:47:50,660 --> 01:47:53,340
That's the Rivers of America canoe.

2499
01:47:53,340 --> 01:47:54,340
Yes.

2500
01:47:54,340 --> 01:47:55,340
It's the pedal.

2501
01:47:55,340 --> 01:47:56,340
You should do it.

2502
01:47:56,340 --> 01:47:57,340
OK.

2503
01:47:57,340 --> 01:47:58,340
What's the deal?

2504
01:47:58,380 --> 01:48:05,660
You're in a big giant canoe and no one speaks English and they tell you to row.

2505
01:48:05,660 --> 01:48:09,420
And it's just a really fun experience of like not knowing what's going on.

2506
01:48:09,420 --> 01:48:10,420
And you get tired.

2507
01:48:10,420 --> 01:48:12,500
I mean, you have to really row.

2508
01:48:12,500 --> 01:48:13,500
I've done it Disneyland.

2509
01:48:13,500 --> 01:48:14,500
Yeah.

2510
01:48:14,500 --> 01:48:15,500
It's exhausting.

2511
01:48:15,500 --> 01:48:16,940
It's exhausting, but it was really fun.

2512
01:48:16,940 --> 01:48:17,940
I had a really fun time.

2513
01:48:17,940 --> 01:48:18,940
I see beavers.

2514
01:48:18,940 --> 01:48:20,500
I don't think I saw a beaver.

2515
01:48:20,500 --> 01:48:21,500
I don't know.

2516
01:48:21,500 --> 01:48:22,500
That's just a name.

2517
01:48:22,500 --> 01:48:26,660
But it's just the proprietors immersing yourself in a group of people.

2518
01:48:26,700 --> 01:48:28,700
And they're not all people from Japan.

2519
01:48:28,700 --> 01:48:30,180
I mean, you never know.

2520
01:48:30,180 --> 01:48:35,260
You know, it's people from all over the world working together to canoe this boat.

2521
01:48:35,260 --> 01:48:36,940
And you have to say the commands.

2522
01:48:36,940 --> 01:48:37,940
And it was just really fun.

2523
01:48:37,940 --> 01:48:38,940
I don't know.

2524
01:48:38,940 --> 01:48:39,940
I liked it.

2525
01:48:39,940 --> 01:48:40,940
You learn a word that you all know?

2526
01:48:40,940 --> 01:48:41,940
I do.

2527
01:48:41,940 --> 01:48:42,940
But I can't remember what it is.

2528
01:48:42,940 --> 01:48:46,140
I was going to watch my Instagram archives and like because I was filming part of it

2529
01:48:46,140 --> 01:48:47,140
because I was laughing so hard.

2530
01:48:47,140 --> 01:48:48,140
I was like, this is so funny.

2531
01:48:48,140 --> 01:48:50,940
It's Japanese for rise to the challenge.

2532
01:48:50,940 --> 01:48:51,940
Yeah.

2533
01:48:52,220 --> 01:48:57,980
I was going to say, Scott, the justification of that Imagineer ago or the animator ago

2534
01:48:57,980 --> 01:49:03,180
and like, well, the graduation song was around before we took it for graduations.

2535
01:49:03,180 --> 01:49:07,180
That is a leap so big you could only make it on the back of the mighty Akron.

2536
01:49:13,180 --> 01:49:14,180
That was where you like.

2537
01:49:14,180 --> 01:49:16,180
You did have mighty Akron leap in time.

2538
01:49:16,180 --> 01:49:17,180
Yes, I did.

2539
01:49:17,180 --> 01:49:19,180
Yeah, I was very pleased with it.

2540
01:49:19,180 --> 01:49:20,180
You did.

2541
01:49:20,180 --> 01:49:21,180
Yeah.

2542
01:49:21,420 --> 01:49:26,780
What else do we have to fit in as the gates close for the now extended hours of Animal

2543
01:49:26,780 --> 01:49:27,780
Kingdom?

2544
01:49:27,780 --> 01:49:28,780
I've never been to the Yak and Yeti restaurant.

2545
01:49:28,780 --> 01:49:29,780
I need to go there.

2546
01:49:29,780 --> 01:49:30,780
When you talk about that eventually.

2547
01:49:30,780 --> 01:49:32,580
I haven't been to any of the good restaurants.

2548
01:49:32,580 --> 01:49:33,580
I'd like to.

2549
01:49:33,580 --> 01:49:35,060
People say that's a very good restaurant.

2550
01:49:35,060 --> 01:49:37,340
So Tully Canteen also supposed to be very good.

2551
01:49:37,340 --> 01:49:38,340
Tully Canteen, very good.

2552
01:49:38,340 --> 01:49:43,420
Yes, I can confirm that you can get like a protein bowl or you can get quinoa there.

2553
01:49:43,420 --> 01:49:44,420
They have like a lot of options.

2554
01:49:44,420 --> 01:49:45,420
You can get quinoa and tofu.

2555
01:49:45,420 --> 01:49:49,980
And that's one of their most like progressive quick service Disney World restaurants.

2556
01:49:50,060 --> 01:49:56,060
I mean, Disney could be if Disney like gets the Impossible Burger like they have them

2557
01:49:56,060 --> 01:49:57,420
in California Adventure.

2558
01:49:57,420 --> 01:49:58,420
They do have it now.

2559
01:49:58,420 --> 01:49:59,420
OK.

2560
01:49:59,420 --> 01:50:00,420
Yeah, it's not Beyond.

2561
01:50:00,420 --> 01:50:01,420
It's the Impossible.

2562
01:50:01,420 --> 01:50:02,420
It's the Impossible.

2563
01:50:02,420 --> 01:50:03,420
Wow, really?

2564
01:50:03,420 --> 01:50:04,420
Because the Impossible is a better one.

2565
01:50:04,420 --> 01:50:05,420
The Beyond.

2566
01:50:05,420 --> 01:50:06,420
It depends.

2567
01:50:06,420 --> 01:50:07,420
I'm not mad at a Beyond because I do.

2568
01:50:07,420 --> 01:50:10,860
I'll eat a Beyond, but it's Impossible is better to me.

2569
01:50:10,860 --> 01:50:11,860
Let's see.

2570
01:50:11,860 --> 01:50:14,300
But I think Burger at the Lamplight Lounge.

2571
01:50:14,300 --> 01:50:18,420
Oh, so they're up on the trends.

2572
01:50:18,420 --> 01:50:19,700
It's still on the nicer.

2573
01:50:19,700 --> 01:50:26,460
If Disney could buy in bulk enough to bring the price down, that people would try it.

2574
01:50:26,460 --> 01:50:30,020
And so they could like get people on these things a little bit.

2575
01:50:30,020 --> 01:50:34,780
I found the Impossible Burger to be more seamlessly fooling of me.

2576
01:50:34,780 --> 01:50:36,060
Like that's not the right sentence.

2577
01:50:36,060 --> 01:50:40,220
But Fat Burger has it here and I had it and I was like, oh, this is I'll eat a Beyond

2578
01:50:40,220 --> 01:50:43,340
Burger, but Impossible really like felt like they got they're close.

2579
01:50:43,340 --> 01:50:44,340
It's really good.

2580
01:50:44,340 --> 01:50:45,980
Have you all had the Carl's Jr. one yet?

2581
01:50:45,980 --> 01:50:46,980
No.

2582
01:50:46,980 --> 01:50:47,980
What is that?

2583
01:50:48,700 --> 01:50:52,300
I think it's called the Beyond Star famous Beyond Star Burger.

2584
01:50:52,300 --> 01:50:56,980
But I've had two of them now and I had never eaten a Carl's Jr. in my life until this week.

2585
01:50:56,980 --> 01:50:58,940
OK, so you endorsed that one.

2586
01:50:58,940 --> 01:51:04,580
I was inspired to go after the Super Bowl commercials because Hyundai famously took

2587
01:51:04,580 --> 01:51:06,180
a jab at vegans in their commercial.

2588
01:51:06,180 --> 01:51:07,180
Oh, right.

2589
01:51:07,180 --> 01:51:08,180
Of course.

2590
01:51:08,180 --> 01:51:12,220
And then Carl's Jr. had a commercial for their new vegetarian burger.

2591
01:51:12,220 --> 01:51:13,940
So I said, fuck Hyundai.

2592
01:51:13,940 --> 01:51:16,500
I'm going to go buy Carl's Jr. at Burger.

2593
01:51:16,500 --> 01:51:17,500
And it's good.

2594
01:51:18,020 --> 01:51:19,020
It is OK.

2595
01:51:19,020 --> 01:51:20,020
Yeah, I'll try it.

2596
01:51:20,020 --> 01:51:23,820
And then we've talked, of course, about Taco Bell being a very good option, especially

2597
01:51:23,820 --> 01:51:24,820
with the app.

2598
01:51:24,820 --> 01:51:25,820
Yes.

2599
01:51:25,820 --> 01:51:28,460
You changed my life with that app.

2600
01:51:28,460 --> 01:51:29,460
This is what I want to hear.

2601
01:51:29,460 --> 01:51:33,340
You have changed my life with that app.

2602
01:51:33,340 --> 01:51:35,140
And I said it when I was on Doughboys.

2603
01:51:35,140 --> 01:51:36,140
Yes.

2604
01:51:36,140 --> 01:51:37,140
Thank you.

2605
01:51:37,140 --> 01:51:40,340
That Taco Bell app, you can grill your friggin seven layer burrito.

2606
01:51:40,340 --> 01:51:41,340
It changes the game.

2607
01:51:41,340 --> 01:51:42,340
You can modify anything.

2608
01:51:42,340 --> 01:51:47,020
And you don't have to wait in the line.

2609
01:51:47,020 --> 01:51:50,140
You don't have to be an asshole and say you're out loud.

2610
01:51:50,140 --> 01:51:52,100
They just have to sigh inside when they see it.

2611
01:51:52,100 --> 01:51:53,100
Exactly.

2612
01:51:53,100 --> 01:51:54,100
Oh, God.

2613
01:51:54,100 --> 01:51:55,100
Exactly.

2614
01:51:55,100 --> 01:51:56,100
Get that Taco Bell app.

2615
01:51:56,100 --> 01:51:58,860
And there's also free stuff on there all the time.

2616
01:51:58,860 --> 01:52:00,300
Like free drink, free taco.

2617
01:52:00,300 --> 01:52:01,300
I'm like, hell yeah.

2618
01:52:01,300 --> 01:52:02,300
Sure.

2619
01:52:02,300 --> 01:52:05,300
There used to be McDonald's in Animal Kingdom, right?

2620
01:52:05,300 --> 01:52:06,300
Yeah.

2621
01:52:06,300 --> 01:52:07,300
Which is what?

2622
01:52:07,300 --> 01:52:08,300
Which is, yeah.

2623
01:52:08,300 --> 01:52:11,660
Which was like, I don't know, it bothered me.

2624
01:52:11,660 --> 01:52:12,660
But just the fries?

2625
01:52:12,660 --> 01:52:15,380
Remember when they were selling just the fries?

2626
01:52:15,380 --> 01:52:16,380
That's right.

2627
01:52:16,740 --> 01:52:17,740
That was our...

2628
01:52:17,740 --> 01:52:18,740
It was a weird licensing.

2629
01:52:18,740 --> 01:52:19,740
Was that called Restorontosaurus?

2630
01:52:19,740 --> 01:52:20,740
Was that there McDonald's?

2631
01:52:20,740 --> 01:52:21,740
Wasn't there like a...

2632
01:52:21,740 --> 01:52:26,580
Now I'm getting confused with the dinosaur sunglasses hot in California Adventure that

2633
01:52:26,580 --> 01:52:29,300
was right by the fry stand.

2634
01:52:29,300 --> 01:52:30,540
This was a credit time.

2635
01:52:30,540 --> 01:52:32,140
I didn't like any of this stuff.

2636
01:52:32,140 --> 01:52:35,060
Bad specials, bad TGIFs.

2637
01:52:35,060 --> 01:52:37,660
I'm fine with the McDonald's, but I don't know.

2638
01:52:37,660 --> 01:52:39,460
It felt invasive in the parks.

2639
01:52:39,460 --> 01:52:43,540
They even called it, in California Adventure, they called it Burger Invasion as a little

2640
01:52:43,540 --> 01:52:45,380
jab at...

2641
01:52:45,380 --> 01:52:50,300
That was the Imagineers way of getting back at this forced McDonald's entry into the

2642
01:52:50,300 --> 01:52:51,300
parks.

2643
01:52:51,300 --> 01:52:57,740
But yeah, I'm anxious to go back to Animal Kingdom and forgive the late 90s bummer sins

2644
01:52:57,740 --> 01:52:58,740
of the...

2645
01:52:58,740 --> 01:52:59,740
Yeah, you gotta cleanse.

2646
01:52:59,740 --> 01:53:00,740
Right.

2647
01:53:00,740 --> 01:53:03,700
Because both of the times I went there in the last decade, I did not go into Animal

2648
01:53:03,700 --> 01:53:04,900
Kingdom at all.

2649
01:53:04,900 --> 01:53:06,340
I clearly owe it a visit.

2650
01:53:06,340 --> 01:53:08,180
You definitely owe it a visit.

2651
01:53:08,180 --> 01:53:14,140
I do think it's good that they, kind of in the territory of things that are good about

2652
01:53:14,220 --> 01:53:19,660
They don't use plastic straws or plastic lids for fear of it getting in the animals' habitats.

2653
01:53:19,660 --> 01:53:20,940
Okay, I like that.

2654
01:53:20,940 --> 01:53:25,820
It's the only one of the four parks in Florida that does that.

2655
01:53:25,820 --> 01:53:29,300
But they're kind of de facto saying, yeah, this is bad.

2656
01:53:29,300 --> 01:53:33,380
Anyway, ignore these other three parks where we do this.

2657
01:53:33,380 --> 01:53:36,300
Because there's animals all over those parks.

2658
01:53:36,300 --> 01:53:38,500
Yeah, there's birds and cranes and ducks.

2659
01:53:38,500 --> 01:53:39,780
There's animals everywhere.

2660
01:53:39,780 --> 01:53:41,860
I saw a cat at Tokyo Disney.

2661
01:53:41,860 --> 01:53:42,860
What was the cat say?

2662
01:53:42,900 --> 01:53:45,900
It was a little kitty just hanging out and we tried to pet him.

2663
01:53:45,900 --> 01:53:46,900
Sure.

2664
01:53:46,900 --> 01:53:47,900
Probably dangerous.

2665
01:53:47,900 --> 01:53:51,980
Wait, let me say this weird fact about, we've been talking about animals at the parks.

2666
01:53:51,980 --> 01:53:55,900
One of the things in the corner of Animal Kingdom and their conservation efforts is

2667
01:53:55,900 --> 01:54:02,620
that they've significantly raised the population of Guam Kingfisher chicks.

2668
01:54:02,620 --> 01:54:03,620
What do those look like?

2669
01:54:03,620 --> 01:54:04,620
What are they?

2670
01:54:04,620 --> 01:54:05,620
Don't know.

2671
01:54:05,620 --> 01:54:06,620
But they were almost on the way out.

2672
01:54:06,620 --> 01:54:08,540
And in Animal Kingdom, they are thriving.

2673
01:54:08,540 --> 01:54:09,540
So wonderful.

2674
01:54:09,540 --> 01:54:10,540
Love that.

2675
01:54:10,700 --> 01:54:12,140
Life will find a way.

2676
01:54:12,140 --> 01:54:14,020
That's not from The Lion King or any...

2677
01:54:14,020 --> 01:54:15,020
Circle of Life.

2678
01:54:15,020 --> 01:54:16,020
How about that?

2679
01:54:16,020 --> 01:54:17,020
There you go.

2680
01:54:17,020 --> 01:54:18,020
Beautiful.

2681
01:54:18,020 --> 01:54:24,180
Circle of Life probably played too much in all of the specials and all of the build-up.

2682
01:54:24,180 --> 01:54:27,740
I think they maybe overestimated.

2683
01:54:27,740 --> 01:54:32,120
I think it's impossible to underestimate how much people love and don't get tired of Let

2684
01:54:32,120 --> 01:54:33,120
It Go.

2685
01:54:33,120 --> 01:54:34,380
I'm not one of those people.

2686
01:54:34,380 --> 01:54:36,020
I got tired of it quickly.

2687
01:54:36,020 --> 01:54:38,900
But clearly they have not hit the ceiling on Let It Go.

2688
01:54:38,900 --> 01:54:40,300
Circle of Life, they seem convinced.

2689
01:54:40,300 --> 01:54:45,700
Like, yeah, we can have full performances of Circle of Life in every special for a decade.

2690
01:54:45,700 --> 01:54:46,700
I agree with that.

2691
01:54:46,700 --> 01:54:50,420
I could see Circle of Life all day, but I don't give a shit about Frozen.

2692
01:54:50,420 --> 01:54:53,780
Did y'all hear about the theory about why they made Frozen?

2693
01:54:53,780 --> 01:54:57,940
So people would stop Googling Disney's Frozen head?

2694
01:54:57,940 --> 01:55:06,180
So to cover up the conspiracy, they wrote a movie called Disney's Frozen so it would

2695
01:55:06,660 --> 01:55:08,620
be found on Google again.

2696
01:55:08,620 --> 01:55:11,260
To hide the fact that Disney's head is frozen.

2697
01:55:11,260 --> 01:55:13,300
I feel like I could find it on Google right now though.

2698
01:55:13,300 --> 01:55:18,020
Well, you have to change the search history to only show articles before Frozen came out.

2699
01:55:18,020 --> 01:55:19,540
We'll look into this.

2700
01:55:19,540 --> 01:55:22,300
So they also have to make a movie called Commie Hater.

2701
01:55:22,300 --> 01:55:24,940
Distributed from Disney being Commie Hater.

2702
01:55:24,940 --> 01:55:25,940
Coming Summer 2022.

2703
01:55:25,940 --> 01:55:27,940
But it's a Dean movie.

2704
01:55:27,940 --> 01:55:28,940
That's just a last name.

2705
01:55:28,940 --> 01:55:31,460
It follows William Commie Hater.

2706
01:55:31,460 --> 01:55:34,460
By Josh Gad.

2707
01:55:35,460 --> 01:55:40,460
Did you hear the rumor that they're changing the name of Disney Plus to Gad Plus?

2708
01:55:40,460 --> 01:55:44,460
Because it's all Gad all the time, baby.

2709
01:55:44,460 --> 01:55:45,460
I did hear that.

2710
01:55:45,460 --> 01:55:46,460
I think that's true.

2711
01:55:46,460 --> 01:55:48,460
The biggest brands in the industry right now.

2712
01:55:48,460 --> 01:55:50,460
Netflix, Apple, Gad.

2713
01:55:50,460 --> 01:55:51,460
Gad.

2714
01:55:51,460 --> 01:55:56,220
I have a final question, I think, but it should be the last thing before we exit to the gift

2715
01:55:56,220 --> 01:55:57,220
shop.

2716
01:55:57,220 --> 01:55:58,220
Does everybody else have anything else?

2717
01:55:58,220 --> 01:55:59,820
I'm good to go.

2718
01:55:59,820 --> 01:56:03,940
I just really quick want to say because my podcast, NatchBeaut, is all about skincare,

2719
01:56:03,940 --> 01:56:04,940
beauty, wellness.

2720
01:56:04,940 --> 01:56:05,940
Oh, yeah.

2721
01:56:05,940 --> 01:56:09,780
I want to tell everybody that if you are a theme park head, you got to wear sunscreen.

2722
01:56:09,780 --> 01:56:10,780
I don't care if it's overcast.

2723
01:56:10,780 --> 01:56:11,780
Absolutely.

2724
01:56:11,780 --> 01:56:13,820
I don't care if you're at Florida and it's raining.

2725
01:56:13,820 --> 01:56:15,380
When I was there, it was raining all the time.

2726
01:56:15,380 --> 01:56:17,580
It was very foggy and cute and fun.

2727
01:56:17,580 --> 01:56:19,780
You got to sunscreen up every day.

2728
01:56:19,780 --> 01:56:21,820
And at night, you got to wash your face.

2729
01:56:21,820 --> 01:56:22,820
Wash your face.

2730
01:56:22,820 --> 01:56:26,960
Wash off all the pollutants, all the dirt, everything that hits your face, the old sunscreen.

2731
01:56:26,960 --> 01:56:30,100
So keep that skin fresh.

2732
01:56:31,100 --> 01:56:35,060
Definitely put a moisturizer on at night after a big day at the park.

2733
01:56:35,060 --> 01:56:36,060
Very good advice.

2734
01:56:36,060 --> 01:56:37,060
I need to do that more.

2735
01:56:37,060 --> 01:56:38,060
Specific theme park skincare.

2736
01:56:38,060 --> 01:56:39,060
Sometimes I do it, sometimes I get lazy.

2737
01:56:39,060 --> 01:56:40,780
Y'all better wear it every time.

2738
01:56:40,780 --> 01:56:42,420
Do you sunscreen, Scott?

2739
01:56:42,420 --> 01:56:48,180
The last time I was there, even though it was overcast, I got a little bleary and I

2740
01:56:48,180 --> 01:56:52,900
think it was because that sun was creeping in there and I wasn't wearing anything.

2741
01:56:52,900 --> 01:56:56,020
So I'm thinking, your advice is resonating with me.

2742
01:56:56,020 --> 01:57:02,700
Please, everybody, no matter what age you are, everybody, put that sunscreen on before

2743
01:57:02,700 --> 01:57:03,820
you hit the lines.

2744
01:57:03,820 --> 01:57:06,060
Any recommendations, brand wise?

2745
01:57:06,060 --> 01:57:07,060
I mean, you know what?

2746
01:57:07,060 --> 01:57:08,140
I'm a bougie bitch.

2747
01:57:08,140 --> 01:57:10,140
So I like that Sephora price point.

2748
01:57:10,140 --> 01:57:11,460
I'm all about the super goo.

2749
01:57:11,460 --> 01:57:12,460
Those are at the parks.

2750
01:57:12,460 --> 01:57:13,460
Those are at the sun.

2751
01:57:13,460 --> 01:57:15,420
You can get one at Universal City Walk or Disney.

2752
01:57:15,420 --> 01:57:16,420
Downtown Disney.

2753
01:57:16,420 --> 01:57:17,420
Sephora is there.

2754
01:57:17,420 --> 01:57:18,420
Oh yeah, there you go.

2755
01:57:18,420 --> 01:57:22,460
Because I don't like, on Attribute, we only do non-animal testing products.

2756
01:57:22,460 --> 01:57:26,620
So a lot of the like Neutrogena's and whatnot, they test on animals.

2757
01:57:26,620 --> 01:57:30,060
So we're all about kind of the, you got to look at it.

2758
01:57:30,060 --> 01:57:33,780
I like Super Goop and Kula, C-O-O-L-A.

2759
01:57:33,780 --> 01:57:36,860
They're both at Sephora, Ulta, that kind of price point.

2760
01:57:36,860 --> 01:57:41,460
Great, good, high quality ingredients and all kinds of different ones, depending on

2761
01:57:41,460 --> 01:57:42,460
what you're looking for.

2762
01:57:42,460 --> 01:57:45,900
If you want a mineral, if you want a chemical, if you don't know what the fuck that is, listen

2763
01:57:45,900 --> 01:57:46,900
to Attribute, babe.

2764
01:57:46,900 --> 01:57:47,900
I'll tell you.

2765
01:57:47,900 --> 01:57:48,900
Wow, cool.

2766
01:57:48,900 --> 01:57:49,900
That's good specifics.

2767
01:57:50,340 --> 01:57:51,340
Yeah, yeah.

2768
01:57:51,340 --> 01:57:52,340
Listen to Attribute.

2769
01:57:52,340 --> 01:57:53,340
Does it matter when days anymore?

2770
01:57:53,340 --> 01:57:58,340
I was going to be like, it comes out every...

2771
01:57:58,340 --> 01:57:59,340
Comes out every Friday.

2772
01:57:59,340 --> 01:58:00,340
Friday, like us.

2773
01:58:00,340 --> 01:58:01,340
Oh my gosh, okay.

2774
01:58:01,340 --> 01:58:02,340
We'll just head on over there right now.

2775
01:58:02,340 --> 01:58:03,340
The fun day, Friday, you know?

2776
01:58:03,340 --> 01:58:04,340
Yeah, that's where the coolest podcasts...

2777
01:58:04,340 --> 01:58:05,340
We have crossover fans because tweets were coming in.

2778
01:58:05,340 --> 01:58:06,340
Oh yeah, I saw that.

2779
01:58:06,340 --> 01:58:07,340
People were excited.

2780
01:58:07,340 --> 01:58:08,340
Well, I hope you liked it.

2781
01:58:08,340 --> 01:58:09,340
I hope we did it at service and we'll get to Bibbidi Bobbidi Boutique.

2782
01:58:09,340 --> 01:58:10,340
I'm down to all try and go, I mean, whenever y'all want.

2783
01:58:10,340 --> 01:58:11,340
Oh yeah.

2784
01:58:11,340 --> 01:58:12,340
I have fun.

2785
01:58:12,340 --> 01:58:13,340
I have fun.

2786
01:58:13,340 --> 01:58:14,340
I have fun.

2787
01:58:14,340 --> 01:58:15,340
I have fun.

2788
01:58:15,340 --> 01:58:16,340
I have fun.

2789
01:58:16,340 --> 01:58:17,340
I have fun.

2790
01:58:17,340 --> 01:58:18,340
I have fun.

2791
01:58:18,780 --> 01:58:19,780
Whenever y'all want.

2792
01:58:19,780 --> 01:58:20,780
Oh yeah.

2793
01:58:20,780 --> 01:58:24,620
I have questions for you probably off air about my scalp and about my moisturizing routine,

2794
01:58:24,620 --> 01:58:25,620
but that's...

2795
01:58:25,620 --> 01:58:26,620
We'll do that later.

2796
01:58:26,620 --> 01:58:27,620
It's too far.

2797
01:58:27,620 --> 01:58:30,620
Listeners, if you're upset that you didn't get to hear this on air, let us know.

2798
01:58:30,620 --> 01:58:31,620
Dry?

2799
01:58:31,620 --> 01:58:32,620
Very dry.

2800
01:58:32,620 --> 01:58:33,620
Yeah.

2801
01:58:33,620 --> 01:58:34,620
How often do you wash your hair?

2802
01:58:34,620 --> 01:58:39,460
Well, here's the problem is that when people say don't wash your hair a lot, wait a couple

2803
01:58:39,460 --> 01:58:41,860
days, it gets worse if I do that.

2804
01:58:41,860 --> 01:58:42,860
It gets way worse.

2805
01:58:42,860 --> 01:58:43,860
You got to train it.

2806
01:58:43,860 --> 01:58:44,860
I've tried.

2807
01:58:44,860 --> 01:58:45,860
It's unsustainable.

2808
01:58:45,860 --> 01:58:46,860
Yeah, interesting.

2809
01:58:47,380 --> 01:58:50,020
I think I almost knocked over his microphone twice.

2810
01:58:50,020 --> 01:58:52,140
This is a problem that's been plaguing me for years.

2811
01:58:52,140 --> 01:58:53,140
Yeah.

2812
01:58:53,140 --> 01:58:54,140
Same.

2813
01:58:54,140 --> 01:58:55,140
It's a problem.

2814
01:58:55,140 --> 01:58:56,140
It is.

2815
01:58:56,140 --> 01:58:57,140
We'll talk about it later.

2816
01:58:57,140 --> 01:58:58,140
We'll talk about it.

2817
01:58:58,140 --> 01:59:03,220
My final question though is if we had to populate Ringo's All-Star Band with Disney characters,

2818
01:59:03,220 --> 01:59:05,620
instrument playing Disney characters, what do we think?

2819
01:59:05,620 --> 01:59:06,620
Oh boy.

2820
01:59:06,620 --> 01:59:07,620
Sonny Eclipse has got to be in...

2821
01:59:07,620 --> 01:59:09,140
Sonny Eclipse is in there.

2822
01:59:09,140 --> 01:59:10,700
King Louie is in there.

2823
01:59:10,700 --> 01:59:15,220
Some of the Aristocats band who are not racist stereotypes are probably session guys.

2824
01:59:15,220 --> 01:59:16,220
Okay.

2825
01:59:16,580 --> 01:59:17,580
Is there a bear in there somewhere?

2826
01:59:17,580 --> 01:59:18,580
Does he play an instrument?

2827
01:59:18,580 --> 01:59:20,380
He does in my head.

2828
01:59:20,380 --> 01:59:22,500
Maybe he's just like the Mighty Mighty Bossdones dancer guy.

2829
01:59:22,500 --> 01:59:23,500
Yes, the hype man.

2830
01:59:23,500 --> 01:59:24,860
He's dancing back and forth.

2831
01:59:24,860 --> 01:59:26,380
He can probably play a jug.

2832
01:59:26,380 --> 01:59:28,340
Yeah, but there's like a jug.

2833
01:59:28,340 --> 01:59:30,060
I was going to just put a country bear in there.

2834
01:59:30,060 --> 01:59:31,500
I'm fine with that.

2835
01:59:31,500 --> 01:59:32,500
A country bear.

2836
01:59:32,500 --> 01:59:33,500
That's fine.

2837
01:59:33,500 --> 01:59:35,860
Or is it just the country bears with Ringo in front?

2838
01:59:35,860 --> 01:59:38,300
God, I would love that.

2839
01:59:38,300 --> 01:59:39,300
It's maybe the cleanest.

2840
01:59:39,300 --> 01:59:40,780
Yeah, that works maybe the best.

2841
01:59:40,780 --> 01:59:42,780
I would love that so much.

2842
01:59:42,780 --> 01:59:44,700
But can Richard Page be there?

2843
01:59:45,180 --> 01:59:47,180
He's part of the Disney family.

2844
01:59:47,180 --> 01:59:48,180
America!

2845
01:59:48,180 --> 01:59:53,180
Ringo and the All-Stars, man, you've got to get Golden Dreams into the sun.

2846
01:59:53,180 --> 01:59:54,180
Oh my God.

2847
01:59:54,180 --> 01:59:55,180
We would go every time.

2848
01:59:55,180 --> 01:59:56,180
And start touring.

2849
01:59:56,180 --> 01:59:57,180
Yeah, okay.

2850
01:59:57,180 --> 01:59:58,180
Tour with the country bears.

2851
01:59:58,180 --> 01:59:59,180
Ringo, again?

2852
01:59:59,180 --> 02:00:01,660
Well, I'm having trouble limiting it.

2853
02:00:01,660 --> 02:00:08,500
I want Ringo, with his vast wealth, to next time he goes on tour, pay for a Rock of Fire

2854
02:00:08,500 --> 02:00:13,420
explosion and a Chucky Make-Believe band and the country bears.

2855
02:00:13,420 --> 02:00:15,860
Let's get a Muppet and the Kermit playing the band show.

2856
02:00:15,860 --> 02:00:16,860
Oh yeah.

2857
02:00:16,860 --> 02:00:17,860
Sunny Eclipse.

2858
02:00:17,860 --> 02:00:20,860
On the banjo, Kermit the Frog.

2859
02:00:20,860 --> 02:00:21,860
Kermit the Frog.

2860
02:00:21,860 --> 02:00:25,660
He could put, Ringo could put Kermit the Frog in the All-Star band and nobody would bat an

2861
02:00:25,660 --> 02:00:26,660
eye.

2862
02:00:26,660 --> 02:00:27,660
Nobody would say that's weird.

2863
02:00:27,660 --> 02:00:30,140
He perfectly fits into the lore of the band.

2864
02:00:30,140 --> 02:00:31,140
Absolutely.

2865
02:00:31,140 --> 02:00:32,140
Yeah, why not?

2866
02:00:32,140 --> 02:00:36,140
Could we get some of the like, under the sea animals in there?

2867
02:00:36,140 --> 02:00:37,140
Oh, that's good.

2868
02:00:37,140 --> 02:00:38,140
Yeah, the Duke plays the flute.

2869
02:00:38,140 --> 02:00:39,140
In the clam.

2870
02:00:39,140 --> 02:00:40,140
The Duke playing the flute.

2871
02:00:40,140 --> 02:00:43,140
The flute plays the, well, I don't remember.

2872
02:00:43,860 --> 02:00:46,860
The crab playing the harp.

2873
02:00:46,860 --> 02:00:49,860
Give me a hand and fall, here we go again.

2874
02:00:49,860 --> 02:00:54,860
And then of course they have to play octopus's garden when they bring on the undersea.

2875
02:00:54,860 --> 02:00:55,860
I'm getting tired.

2876
02:00:55,860 --> 02:00:56,860
This is the finale.

2877
02:00:56,860 --> 02:01:01,860
Octopus, they all leave, you think it's done, but then my undersea friends.

2878
02:01:01,860 --> 02:01:04,860
There they are, flounder and best friend.

2879
02:01:04,860 --> 02:01:08,860
A hippo opens its mouth and a bug, a crab, a shrimp.

2880
02:01:08,860 --> 02:01:09,860
Getting his teeth.

2881
02:01:09,860 --> 02:01:10,860
Yeah.

2882
02:01:11,580 --> 02:01:14,580
How do we make this happen?

2883
02:01:14,580 --> 02:01:16,580
Well, do we have to make these animals alive?

2884
02:01:16,580 --> 02:01:19,580
Do we have to breed these animals or are they all robots?

2885
02:01:19,580 --> 02:01:22,580
Is it easier to make Ringo a cartoon?

2886
02:01:22,580 --> 02:01:25,580
He's already been a cartoon in various guises.

2887
02:01:25,580 --> 02:01:26,580
Sure.

2888
02:01:26,580 --> 02:01:30,580
And he's been on Shining Time Station.

2889
02:01:30,580 --> 02:01:35,580
So there's Ringo Shrinking technology available.

2890
02:01:35,580 --> 02:01:39,580
Maybe the easiest thing, you know, you could take all these robots and you could take them

2891
02:01:40,300 --> 02:01:44,300
on a tour with Ringo or you could just make Ringo a permanent part of the under the sea,

2892
02:01:44,300 --> 02:01:45,300
Ariel's undersea adventure ride.

2893
02:01:45,300 --> 02:01:48,300
Now that is my favorite of all these ideas.

2894
02:01:48,300 --> 02:01:53,300
Yeah, Ringo lives in the under the sea right now.

2895
02:01:53,300 --> 02:01:57,300
And it's old Ringo, it's 80 year old Ringo.

2896
02:01:57,300 --> 02:02:00,300
I think he's in the peace and love position and he's singing.

2897
02:02:00,300 --> 02:02:05,300
Is there a scarier song he can sing with Ursula or does he just do a duet?

2898
02:02:05,300 --> 02:02:08,300
I admit that in the past I've been a nasty.

2899
02:02:09,020 --> 02:02:10,020
Oh boy.

2900
02:02:10,020 --> 02:02:13,020
Ringo doing poor unfortunate souls.

2901
02:02:13,020 --> 02:02:15,020
Poor unfortunate souls.

2902
02:02:15,020 --> 02:02:18,020
If he turned the no no song into like a dirge.

2903
02:02:18,020 --> 02:02:19,020
Yeah, sure.

2904
02:02:19,020 --> 02:02:20,020
He could put no no song in.

2905
02:02:20,020 --> 02:02:21,020
He could scary that up.

2906
02:02:21,020 --> 02:02:22,020
Yeah, yeah.

2907
02:02:22,020 --> 02:02:25,020
I don't take souls no more.

2908
02:02:25,020 --> 02:02:28,020
It kind of sounds like a Ringo song.

2909
02:02:28,020 --> 02:02:29,020
Yeah.

2910
02:02:29,020 --> 02:02:30,020
In a way.

2911
02:02:30,020 --> 02:02:31,020
That was very easy to go into.

2912
02:02:31,020 --> 02:02:32,020
Poor unfortunate souls.

2913
02:02:32,020 --> 02:02:37,700
And then on Kiss the Girl, Ringo's kind of peering through the bushes with like Sebastian

2914
02:02:38,100 --> 02:02:41,100
and Flounder, like making sure that it happens.

2915
02:02:41,100 --> 02:02:42,100
You know what?

2916
02:02:42,100 --> 02:02:45,100
Kiss the Girl could be a Ringo song.

2917
02:02:45,100 --> 02:02:50,100
They're all really, they're all physically makes Disney songs as it is.

2918
02:02:50,100 --> 02:02:53,100
Sitting there across the lake.

2919
02:02:53,100 --> 02:02:54,100
Short phrasing.

2920
02:02:54,100 --> 02:02:57,100
Can't hold a note out to save his life.

2921
02:02:57,100 --> 02:03:03,100
Oh God, please is there a cover somewhere of Ringo singing Kiss the Girl or Poor Unfortunate

2922
02:03:03,100 --> 02:03:04,100
Souls.

2923
02:03:04,100 --> 02:03:06,100
區瀾 Wilson has covered Kiss the Girl.

2924
02:03:06,500 --> 02:03:09,500
He has an entire Disney covers album.

2925
02:03:09,500 --> 02:03:12,500
So Ringo, take a cue from your friend Brian Wilson.

2926
02:03:12,500 --> 02:03:13,500
Give us what we all want.

2927
02:03:13,500 --> 02:03:15,500
How have I not heard that?

2928
02:03:15,500 --> 02:03:18,500
That's like, because my husband is a tiki head.

2929
02:03:18,500 --> 02:03:20,500
That's like combining two interests once again.

2930
02:03:20,500 --> 02:03:22,500
If I'm not into it.

2931
02:03:22,500 --> 02:03:25,500
I'm a giant Disney head and a giant Beach Boys head and I don't care.

2932
02:03:25,500 --> 02:03:27,500
And you're saying not to listen to it.

2933
02:03:27,500 --> 02:03:28,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2934
02:03:28,500 --> 02:03:30,500
So that doesn't get the Scott stamp of approval.

2935
02:03:30,500 --> 02:03:35,500
But Ringo, please live the rest of your life in the under the sea ride.

2936
02:03:35,900 --> 02:03:38,900
Yeah, we're all agreed, including Jackie.

2937
02:03:38,900 --> 02:03:40,900
Jackie Johnson, you survived podcast the ride.

2938
02:03:40,900 --> 02:03:41,900
Oh, I'm so happy.

2939
02:03:41,900 --> 02:03:43,900
Thank you so much for being here.

2940
02:03:43,900 --> 02:03:44,900
Let's exit through the gift shop.

2941
02:03:44,900 --> 02:03:45,900
Well, I think you know, I think I know.

2942
02:03:45,900 --> 02:03:47,900
Well, you already plugged a little bit.

2943
02:03:47,900 --> 02:03:49,900
When does this come out?

2944
02:03:49,900 --> 02:03:51,900
I don't know yet.

2945
02:03:51,900 --> 02:03:52,900
We got that.

2946
02:03:52,900 --> 02:03:53,900
I'm not sure.

2947
02:03:53,900 --> 02:03:54,900
This exists outside of time.

2948
02:03:54,900 --> 02:03:55,900
It doesn't matter.

2949
02:03:55,900 --> 02:03:56,900
Perfect.

2950
02:03:56,900 --> 02:03:57,900
Coming up in March.

2951
02:03:57,900 --> 02:04:03,900
Well, I am doing a skincare collab with a company called Lolli Beauty and it's a fully

2952
02:04:04,300 --> 02:04:09,300
sustainable organic food grade skincare line and we're doing three products.

2953
02:04:09,300 --> 02:04:14,300
So if you like skincare, you can head to the next boot Instagram, my Instagram, Twitter,

2954
02:04:14,300 --> 02:04:16,300
listen to an attribute, national.com.

2955
02:04:16,300 --> 02:04:18,300
Go anywhere because I'm really excited about their products.

2956
02:04:18,300 --> 02:04:19,300
They're all pink.

2957
02:04:19,300 --> 02:04:20,300
Pink is my favorite color.

2958
02:04:20,300 --> 02:04:22,300
It's called the Nashville pink collection.

2959
02:04:22,300 --> 02:04:24,300
So it's available now.

2960
02:04:24,300 --> 02:04:27,300
So check it out and listen to this.

2961
02:04:27,300 --> 02:04:28,300
Wow.

2962
02:04:28,300 --> 02:04:29,300
Great.

2963
02:04:29,700 --> 02:04:32,700
You folks, check us out at patreon.com slash podcast.

2964
02:04:32,700 --> 02:04:39,700
Right for this second gate full of even more magical content and I'm sure more Ringo bullshit.

2965
02:04:39,700 --> 02:04:40,700
Yes.

2966
02:04:40,700 --> 02:04:41,700
That's so tricky.

2967
02:04:41,700 --> 02:04:46,700
I was worried there wouldn't be more of me.

2968
02:04:46,700 --> 02:04:51,700
Check us out on Twitter and Instagram and there's a Facebook group and I don't, Facebook

2969
02:04:51,700 --> 02:04:56,300
and Reddit are sort of separate from us, but where they're existing and happening and I'm

2970
02:04:56,300 --> 02:04:59,300
glad they are and they're nice places.

2971
02:04:59,300 --> 02:05:00,300
Check them out.

2972
02:05:00,300 --> 02:05:01,300
Yeah.

2973
02:05:01,300 --> 02:05:02,300
People seem nice.

2974
02:05:02,300 --> 02:05:03,300
Yeah.

2975
02:05:03,300 --> 02:05:04,300
We, Jason and I actually approve people for this Facebook group.

2976
02:05:04,300 --> 02:05:05,300
I don't know.

2977
02:05:05,300 --> 02:05:06,300
Is that right?

2978
02:05:06,300 --> 02:05:07,300
Yeah, that is.

2979
02:05:07,300 --> 02:05:09,300
Yeah, because there's the Facebook.

2980
02:05:09,300 --> 02:05:11,300
Bots will get you if you don't do that.

2981
02:05:11,300 --> 02:05:12,300
Yeah.

2982
02:05:12,300 --> 02:05:13,300
We fortunately avoided that.

2983
02:05:13,300 --> 02:05:14,300
It is our group.

2984
02:05:14,300 --> 02:05:15,300
Well, it is our group.

2985
02:05:15,300 --> 02:05:16,300
Oh yeah.

2986
02:05:16,300 --> 02:05:17,300
The group we set up.

2987
02:05:17,300 --> 02:05:18,300
It's more active than I am though.

2988
02:05:18,300 --> 02:05:19,300
I take a look at it.

2989
02:05:19,300 --> 02:05:20,300
I take a look at it a little while.

2990
02:05:20,300 --> 02:05:24,300
Administering Facebook groups is confusing and not very clear.

2991
02:05:24,300 --> 02:05:26,300
The actual software is odd.

2992
02:05:26,300 --> 02:05:28,300
That's why the election went the way it did.

2993
02:05:28,300 --> 02:05:29,300
Yes.

2994
02:05:29,300 --> 02:05:30,300
But the people are nice.

2995
02:05:30,300 --> 02:05:31,300
Everyone's nice in the group.

2996
02:05:31,300 --> 02:05:32,300
Yeah, everyone's nice.

2997
02:05:32,300 --> 02:05:33,300
It's great.

2998
02:05:33,300 --> 02:05:34,300
Everyone's nice.

2999
02:05:34,300 --> 02:05:35,300
Keep being nice out there.

3000
02:05:35,300 --> 02:05:38,300
We will catch you on the next podcast ride.

3001
02:05:38,300 --> 02:05:39,300
Peace and love.

3002
02:05:39,300 --> 02:05:40,300
Peace and love.

3003
02:05:40,300 --> 02:05:41,300
Peace and love.

3004
02:05:41,300 --> 02:05:42,300
Peace and love.

3005
02:05:42,300 --> 02:05:43,300
Peace and love.

3006
02:05:43,300 --> 02:05:44,300
Peace and love.

3007
02:05:44,300 --> 02:05:45,300
Peace and love.

3008
02:05:45,300 --> 02:05:46,300
Peace and love.

3009
02:05:46,300 --> 02:05:47,300
No more autographs.

3010
02:05:47,300 --> 02:05:48,300
Forever Dog.

3011
02:05:48,300 --> 02:05:49,300
This has been a Forever Dog production.

3012
02:05:49,300 --> 02:05:55,600
Executive produced by Mike Carlson, Jason Sheridan, Scott Gardner, Brett Boehm, Joe

3013

Hey there.

3019
02:06:19,600 --> 02:06:20,600
Congratulations.

3020
02:06:20,600 --> 02:06:22,600
You made it all the way through that episode.

3021
02:06:22,600 --> 02:06:23,600
Wow.

3022
02:06:23,600 --> 02:06:26,600
We did not think you were going to be able to do it.

3023
02:06:26,600 --> 02:06:27,600
We barely could.

3024
02:06:27,600 --> 02:06:28,600
It was touch and go.

3025
02:06:28,600 --> 02:06:29,600
Yeah.

3026
02:06:29,600 --> 02:06:30,600
Anyway, now that you did, Michael and I have a pretty cool surprise for you.

3027
02:06:30,600 --> 02:06:31,600
We are going to get high.

3028
02:06:31,600 --> 02:06:32,600
What?

3029
02:06:32,600 --> 02:06:33,600
Come on.

3030
02:06:33,600 --> 02:06:34,600
What are you talking about?

3031
02:06:34,600 --> 02:06:35,600
Let's light up that joint, baby.

3032
02:06:35,600 --> 02:06:36,600
No, Colin.

3033
02:06:36,600 --> 02:06:37,600
Without listeners.

3034
02:06:37,600 --> 02:06:38,600
That is not what we do.

3035
02:06:38,600 --> 02:06:39,600
Litterandi is a pretty cool thing.

3036
02:06:39,600 --> 02:06:40,600
We're going to get high.

3037
02:06:40,600 --> 02:06:41,600
What?

3038
02:06:41,600 --> 02:06:42,600
Come on.

3039
02:06:42,600 --> 02:06:43,600
What are you talking about?

3040
02:06:43,600 --> 02:06:44,600
That is not what we do.

3041
02:06:44,600 --> 02:06:45,600
Litterandi is a podcast about books.

3042
02:06:45,600 --> 02:06:48,400
It is not about getting stoned.

3043
02:06:48,400 --> 02:06:49,840
I thought we had a special treat for you.

3044
02:06:49,840 --> 02:06:51,120
You do not even smoke weed.

3045
02:06:51,120 --> 02:06:52,120
You freak out and get paranoid.

3046
02:06:52,120 --> 02:06:56,480
I thought we had a special treat or surprise for the listeners who made it to the end of

3047
02:06:56,480 --> 02:06:57,480
the episode.

3048
02:06:57,480 --> 02:06:58,480
Yeah.

3049
02:06:58,480 --> 02:06:59,480
We are going to play them a clip from our show.

3050
02:06:59,480 --> 02:07:00,480
How would we get everybody high?

3051
02:07:00,480 --> 02:07:01,480
That does not even make sense.

3052
02:07:01,480 --> 02:07:06,000
Honestly, I do not really listen to podcasts.

3053
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:07,000
I did not know.

3054
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:08,000
That is true.

3055
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:09,480
I am guessing they had the technology to do that.

3056
02:07:09,480 --> 02:07:10,480
No, they do not.

3057
02:07:10,480 --> 02:07:11,480
That is such a weird...

3058
02:07:12,360 --> 02:07:14,160
Colin, we are not going to get anybody high.

3059
02:07:14,160 --> 02:07:15,160
We are not getting high.

3060
02:07:15,160 --> 02:07:16,160
Okay.

3061
02:07:16,160 --> 02:07:18,440
I actually think that you should not be promoting that on this podcast.

3062
02:07:18,440 --> 02:07:19,440
Yeah.

3063
02:07:19,440 --> 02:07:20,440
Okay.

3064
02:07:20,440 --> 02:07:21,440
Fine.

3065
02:07:21,440 --> 02:07:25,520
But if you want to get high at home, sure do it, but we are not promoting it.

3066
02:07:25,520 --> 02:07:26,520
Neither here nor there.

3067
02:07:26,520 --> 02:07:30,480
We are going to play a clip from our podcast with Josh Sharpe.

3068
02:07:30,480 --> 02:07:31,560
Just listen and enjoy that.

3069
02:07:31,560 --> 02:07:32,560
And get high.

3070
02:07:32,560 --> 02:07:33,560
What?

3071
02:07:33,560 --> 02:07:38,100
With that in mind, we would like to take the pressure off of us for a second and introduce

3072
02:07:38,100 --> 02:07:39,760
you to the reader of today.

3073
02:07:40,040 --> 02:07:43,560
He is a recent NYU dropout.

3074
02:07:43,560 --> 02:07:46,520
And we know that means a recipe for success.

3075
02:07:46,520 --> 02:07:48,080
Oh, yes, indeed.

3076
02:07:48,080 --> 02:07:53,160
Dropping out of school and into our hearts, we have young novelist and self-proclaimed

3077
02:07:53,160 --> 02:07:55,560
genius Clint Dimples for you.

3078
02:07:55,560 --> 02:07:56,560
Enjoy.

3079
02:08:01,560 --> 02:08:04,560
Hello, my name is Clint Dimples.

3080
02:08:05,360 --> 02:08:11,060
And this is a piece of short literature that I call The Story.

3081
02:08:11,060 --> 02:08:14,800
There was once a girl with deep brown hair who lived with her grandfather in a small

3082
02:08:14,800 --> 02:08:16,280
cabin upstate.

3083
02:08:16,280 --> 02:08:19,800
Though her parents, who had been professors, died eight months before in an automobile

3084
02:08:19,800 --> 02:08:23,800
accident while returning from an academic conference on the viability of the universal

3085
02:08:23,800 --> 02:08:28,460
basic income, the girl was of a happy sort, her optimism only fading to melancholia on

3086
02:08:28,460 --> 02:08:32,560
nights such as these when the rain shuddering at the windows made her wish for her mother's

3087
02:08:32,560 --> 02:08:33,560
arms.

3088
02:08:34,560 --> 02:08:37,560
The story goes that the grandfather, a wiry man with a great beak of a nose, had just

3089
02:08:37,560 --> 02:08:41,560
climbed the old stairs to her attic bedroom when he heard her quiet sniffles.

3090
02:08:41,560 --> 02:08:42,560
Is everything all right?

3091
02:08:42,560 --> 02:08:43,560
He asked the girl.

3092
02:08:43,560 --> 02:08:45,560
I'm just having trouble sleeping.

3093
02:08:45,560 --> 02:08:46,560
She said it's hard sometimes.

3094
02:08:46,560 --> 02:08:49,560
Yes, I know, said the grandfather.

3095
02:08:49,560 --> 02:08:50,560
Maybe a story would help?

3096
02:08:50,560 --> 02:08:54,560
The little girl nodded, and so the old man began.

3097
02:08:54,560 --> 02:08:58,560
There once was a girl with deep brown hair who lived with her grandfather in a small

3098
02:08:58,560 --> 02:08:59,560
cabin upstate.

3099
02:08:59,560 --> 02:09:02,560
Though her parents, who had been professors, died eight months before in an automobile

3100
02:09:02,560 --> 02:09:05,560
accident while returning from an academic conference on the viability of the universal

3101
02:09:05,560 --> 02:09:09,560
basic income, the girl was of a mostly happy sort, her optimism only fading to melancholia

3102
02:09:09,560 --> 02:09:13,560
on nights such as these when the rain shuddering at the windows made her wish for her mother's

3103
02:09:13,560 --> 02:09:14,560
arms.

3104
02:09:14,560 --> 02:09:18,560
Her grandfather, a wiry man with a great beak of a nose, had just climbed the old stairs

3105
02:09:18,560 --> 02:09:21,560
to her attic bedroom when he heard her quiet sniffles.

3106
02:09:21,560 --> 02:09:22,560
Is everything all right?

3107
02:09:22,560 --> 02:09:23,560
He asked the girl.

3108
02:09:23,560 --> 02:09:24,560
I'm just having trouble sleeping.

3109
02:09:24,560 --> 02:09:26,560
She said it's hard sometimes.

3110
02:09:26,560 --> 02:09:28,560
Yes, I know, said the grandfather.

3111
02:09:28,560 --> 02:09:30,560
Maybe a story would help?

3112
02:09:30,560 --> 02:09:33,560

3114
02:09:37,560 --> 02:09:38,560
cabin upstate.

3115
02:09:38,560 --> 02:09:42,560
Though her parents, who had invented the soda stream, were murdered eight months before

3116
02:09:42,560 --> 02:09:46,560
while leaving a Papa John's pizza in Bridgeport, Connecticut, the girl was of a mostly happy

3117
02:09:46,560 --> 02:09:50,560
sort, her optimism only fading to melancholia on nights such as these when the rain shuddering

3118
02:09:50,560 --> 02:09:52,560
at the windows made her wish for her mother's arms.

3119
02:09:52,560 --> 02:09:57,560
Her grandfather, a wiry man with a great beak of a nose, had just climbed the old stairs

3120
02:09:57,560 --> 02:10:00,560
to her attic bedroom when he heard her quiet sniffles.

3121
02:10:00,560 --> 02:10:01,560
Is everything all right?

3122
02:10:01,560 --> 02:10:02,560
He asked the girl.

3123
02:10:02,560 --> 02:10:03,560
I'm just having trouble sleeping.

3124
02:10:03,560 --> 02:10:04,560
She said it's hard sometimes.

3125
02:10:04,560 --> 02:10:07,560
Yes, I know, said the grandfather.

3126

3127
02:10:09,560 --> 02:10:12,560
The little girl nodded, and so the old man began.

3128
02:10:12,560 --> 02:10:16,560
There was once a girl with deep brown hair who lived with her grandfather in a small

3129
02:10:16,560 --> 02:10:17,560
cabin upstate.

3130
02:10:17,560 --> 02:10:20,560
Though her parents, who had been professors, died eight months before in an automobile

3131
02:10:20,560 --> 02:10:23,560
accident while returning from an academic conference on the viability of the universal

3132
02:10:23,560 --> 02:10:26,560
basic income, the girl was of a mostly happy sort, her optimism only fading to melancholia

3133
02:10:26,560 --> 02:10:31,560
on nights such as these when the rain shuddering at the windows made her wish for her mother's

3134
02:10:31,560 --> 02:10:32,560
arms.

3135
02:10:32,560 --> 02:10:37,560
Her grandfather, a wiry man with a great beak of a nose, had just climbed the old stairs

3136
02:10:37,560 --> 02:10:39,560
to her attic bedroom when he heard her quiet sniffles.

3137
02:10:39,560 --> 02:10:40,560
Is everything all right?

3138
02:10:40,560 --> 02:10:41,560
He asked the girl.

3139
02:10:41,560 --> 02:10:42,560
I'm just having trouble sleeping.

3140
02:10:42,560 --> 02:10:43,560
She said it's hard sometimes.

3141
02:10:43,560 --> 02:10:48,560
I know how that is, said the grandfather, with the trouble sleeping.

3142
02:10:48,560 --> 02:10:50,560
Is that why you sleep on the roof?

3143
02:10:50,560 --> 02:10:51,560
The little girl asked.

3144
02:10:51,560 --> 02:10:52,560
Yes, that's why.

3145
02:10:52,560 --> 02:10:53,560
That's why I sleep on the roof.

3146
02:10:53,560 --> 02:10:54,560
I see, she said.

3147
02:10:54,560 --> 02:10:55,560
And no other reason, he yelled.

3148
02:10:55,560 --> 02:10:56,560
Okay, cool, fine, said the girl.

3149
02:10:56,560 --> 02:10:57,560
Will you tell me a story?

3150
02:10:57,560 --> 02:10:58,560
Hmm?

3151
02:10:58,560 --> 02:10:59,560
Said the old man.

3152
02:10:59,560 --> 02:11:00,560
A story.

3153
02:11:00,560 --> 02:11:01,560
Oh, yeah, sure, right, story, yeah.

3154
02:11:01,560 --> 02:11:02,560
Oh, I can do that.

3155
02:11:02,560 --> 02:11:03,560
And so the old man began.

3156
02:11:03,560 --> 02:11:04,560
There once was a girl with deep brown hair who lived with her grandfather in a small cabin

3157
02:11:04,560 --> 02:11:05,560
upstate.

3158
02:11:05,560 --> 02:11:06,560
Though her parents, who had been professors, died eight months before in an automobile

3159
02:11:06,560 --> 02:11:07,560
accident while returning from an academic conference on the viability of the universal

3160
02:11:07,560 --> 02:11:08,560

3161
02:11:08,560 --> 02:11:09,560
on nights such as these when the rain shuddering at the windows made her wish for her mother's

3162
02:11:09,560 --> 02:11:10,560
arms.

3163
02:11:10,560 --> 02:11:11,560
Her grandfather, a wiry man with a great beak of a nose, had just climbed the old stairs

3164
02:11:11,560 --> 02:11:32,120
to her attic bedroom when he heard her quiet sniffles.

3165
02:11:32,120 --> 02:11:44,400
She said it's hard sometimes.

3166
02:11:44,400 --> 02:11:49,320
Yes, I know, he said, scratching at his big fucking beak nose.

3167
02:11:49,320 --> 02:11:50,760
Maybe a story would help?

3168
02:11:50,760 --> 02:11:54,240
Sure, Grandpapa, but what's happening to you?

3169
02:11:54,240 --> 02:11:55,240
Whatever do you mean?

3170
02:11:55,240 --> 02:11:56,240
He asked.

3171
02:11:56,240 --> 02:11:57,240
Your nose!

3172
02:11:57,240 --> 02:11:58,760
It's turned into a beak like that of a bird!

3173
02:11:58,760 --> 02:12:02,720
And sure enough it had, the nose, ossified into a large yellow beak.

3174
02:12:02,720 --> 02:12:05,560
Squawk, said the Grandfather, Squawk, Squawk!

3175
02:12:05,560 --> 02:12:08,880
As feathers, deep blue and red feathers, began to shoot out of his back.

3176
02:12:08,880 --> 02:12:10,920
Squawk, he said, Squawk!

3177
02:12:10,920 --> 02:12:13,880
Why Grandfather, the little girl cried, you're turning into a bird!

3178
02:12:13,880 --> 02:12:16,560
A real fucking bird with a giant fucking beak!

3179
02:12:16,560 --> 02:12:17,900
It's amazing!

3180
02:12:17,900 --> 02:12:19,160
His feet now claws.

3181
02:12:19,160 --> 02:12:21,840
He reached over and stood atop the girl's wrists.

3182
02:12:21,840 --> 02:12:24,480
Then he flapped and flapped until he started to rise.

3183
02:12:24,480 --> 02:12:27,140
Over the bed, clutching the small girl beneath him.

3184
02:12:27,140 --> 02:12:31,900
His great wings swatting at the walls, he tilted his feathered crown forward and burst,

3185
02:12:31,900 --> 02:12:34,220
beak first, out of the large attic window.

3186
02:12:34,220 --> 02:12:38,060
The girl hung below him as they made their way up, higher and higher, until the house

3187
02:12:38,060 --> 02:12:39,860
was but a speck below them.

3188
02:12:39,860 --> 02:12:40,860
She looked up.

3189
02:12:40,860 --> 02:12:42,340
Thank you, Grandpapa.

3190
02:12:42,340 --> 02:12:43,340
Thank you.

3191
02:12:43,340 --> 02:12:47,140
Thank you for transforming into a big fucking bird and taking flight.

3192
02:12:47,140 --> 02:12:51,740
And then the old man let forth a mighty Squawk, spread his wings wide, and the two soared

3193
02:12:51,740 --> 02:12:55,620
off into the warm night air, floating and finally free.

3194
02:12:55,620 --> 02:12:56,700
The End.

3195
02:12:56,700 --> 02:12:59,060
What a lovely story, said the little girl.

3196
02:12:59,060 --> 02:13:04,100
But I must ask, was the grandpa in that story, the one who turned into a bird, was he supposed

3197
02:13:04,100 --> 02:13:05,100
to be you?

3198
02:13:05,100 --> 02:13:06,100
Me?

3199
02:13:06,100 --> 02:13:08,780
The old man replied, whatever you mean.

3200
02:13:08,780 --> 02:13:13,060
I mean, said the little girl, that maybe it is you who wants to be a bird?

3201
02:13:13,060 --> 02:13:15,460
I'm asking in part because I know you like to sleep on the roof.

3202
02:13:15,460 --> 02:13:17,100
I told you about that already.

3203
02:13:17,100 --> 02:13:18,540
I just do that because I like it.

3204
02:13:18,540 --> 02:13:19,940
No other reason, he shouted.

3205
02:13:19,940 --> 02:13:24,420
Well, sure, said the girl, but the way in which you chew my food up for me and our winter

3206
02:13:25,420 --> 02:13:29,460
trips down south, it just all makes me think that maybe you want to be a bird for some

3207
02:13:29,460 --> 02:13:32,740
reason, which, to be honest, is sort of a ridiculous notion given that you're a grown

3208
02:13:32,740 --> 02:13:33,740
man.

3209
02:13:33,740 --> 02:13:36,500
And so if you actually want to be a bird, well, I don't know, maybe you're just crazy.

3210
02:13:36,500 --> 02:13:38,980
OK, story time is over, said the old man.

3211
02:13:38,980 --> 02:13:40,340
I'm turning off the lights now.

3212
02:13:40,340 --> 02:13:41,500
It's time for bed.

3213
02:13:41,500 --> 02:13:44,500
He pulled the chain on the lamp and all was still.

3214
02:13:44,500 --> 02:13:48,620
I know you have to use the ladder in my room to climb onto the roof, Grandpa, said the

3215
02:13:48,620 --> 02:13:49,620
little girl.

3216
02:13:49,620 --> 02:13:52,340
So you can turn the lights back on and get it if you want.

3217
02:13:52,340 --> 02:13:54,340
OK, I'll turn them on just because I want to turn them on.

3218
02:13:54,340 --> 02:13:56,860
How about that, said the old man, fumbling for the chain.

3219
02:13:56,860 --> 02:13:57,860
There we go.

3220
02:13:57,860 --> 02:13:58,860
They're on.

3221
02:13:58,860 --> 02:13:59,860
The lights are on.

3222
02:13:59,860 --> 02:14:00,860
Oh, and look, it's the ladder I need to get on the roof.

3223
02:14:00,860 --> 02:14:04,300
You know, I better go up there to check on some of the tiles and the roofing and other

3224
02:14:04,300 --> 02:14:05,300
things.

3225
02:14:05,300 --> 02:14:06,660
Not to sleep, just to, you know, check it out.

3226
02:14:06,660 --> 02:14:09,660
I just you won't mind turning the lights off once I'm up there, you know, just in case

3227
02:14:09,660 --> 02:14:10,660
I take a while.

3228
02:14:10,660 --> 02:14:12,740
No, Grandpa, of course not.

3229
02:14:12,740 --> 02:14:13,940
All right, he said.

3230
02:14:13,940 --> 02:14:17,180
Here I go up the ladder to check on the tiles.

3231
02:14:17,180 --> 02:14:19,180
Night and night, I'm almost to the top.

3232
02:14:19,180 --> 02:14:22,780
Shutting the hatch behind him, the old man sat down on the roof, pulled his knees to

3233
02:14:22,780 --> 02:14:26,180
his chest, then looked up to the sky and quietly sobbed.

3234
02:14:26,180 --> 02:14:30,500
A pigeon landed on his shoulder and the man gently scooped the bird in his palms and pulled

3235
02:14:30,500 --> 02:14:31,500
it close.

3236
02:14:31,500 --> 02:14:34,260
Not today, he whispered, snot running down his face.

3237
02:14:34,260 --> 02:14:36,460
Maybe someday, but not today.

3238
02:14:36,460 --> 02:14:37,460
The end.

3239
02:14:37,460 --> 02:14:39,860
What a sad story, said the little girl.

3240
02:14:39,860 --> 02:14:43,940
I feel sad for the man in that story who told that other story, the man who wanted to be

3241
02:14:43,940 --> 02:14:44,940
a bird.

3242
02:14:44,940 --> 02:14:46,660
Yes, the old man replied.

3243
02:14:46,660 --> 02:14:50,820
But sometimes it is the sad stories that give us comfort, that remind us of how lucky we

3244
02:14:50,820 --> 02:14:52,500
are to have what we have.

3245
02:14:52,500 --> 02:14:56,140
Your parents left you with a great fortune and you should take solace in that.

3246
02:14:56,140 --> 02:14:57,140
She nodded.

3247
02:14:57,140 --> 02:14:58,860
Yes, but I still miss Mom and Pop.

3248
02:14:58,860 --> 02:14:59,860
She paused.

3249
02:14:59,860 --> 02:15:03,380
Grandpa, do you think they'll ever find who murdered my parents in front of that Papa

3250
02:15:03,380 --> 02:15:05,820
John's Pizza in Bridgeport, Connecticut?

3251
02:15:05,820 --> 02:15:07,340
The grandfather thought for a moment.

3252
02:15:07,340 --> 02:15:09,380
No, I'm almost certain they will not.

3253
02:15:09,380 --> 02:15:10,940
He drew in a labored breath.

3254
02:15:10,940 --> 02:15:12,740
I was very careful.

3255
02:15:12,740 --> 02:15:13,740
The girl looked up at him.

3256
02:15:13,740 --> 02:15:14,740
You were what?

3257
02:15:14,740 --> 02:15:16,180
I said I was careful.

3258
02:15:16,180 --> 02:15:17,460
He stood up over her bed.

3259
02:15:17,460 --> 02:15:21,140
And what's more, I'm not like the old man in that story, pretending to be something

3260
02:15:21,140 --> 02:15:22,140
he's not.

3261
02:15:22,140 --> 02:15:24,100
At the time, you know who I really am, little girl.

3262
02:15:24,100 --> 02:15:28,620
I murdered your parents outside of that Papa John's Pizza in Bridgeport, Connecticut.

3263
02:15:28,620 --> 02:15:30,100
The girl pulled back towards the wall.

3264
02:15:30,100 --> 02:15:31,100
You what?

3265
02:15:31,100 --> 02:15:32,180
Why would you do that?

3266
02:15:32,180 --> 02:15:34,040
Because I wanted that SodaStream money.

3267
02:15:34,040 --> 02:15:36,900
And with them gone, now only you stand in my way.

3268
02:15:36,900 --> 02:15:40,660
In one quick motion, he removed the knife from his sleeve and plunged it into the little

3269
02:15:40,660 --> 02:15:41,700
girl's chest.

3270
02:15:41,700 --> 02:15:45,660
He pulled her close to his face and whispered, Let me hear you squawk before you fly away,

3271
02:15:45,660 --> 02:15:46,660
little bird.

3272
02:15:46,660 --> 02:15:47,660
Let me hear you squawk.

3273
02:15:47,660 --> 02:15:48,660
Stop, stop, stop!

3274
02:15:48,660 --> 02:15:49,660
The little girl shouted.

3275
02:15:50,660 --> 02:15:51,660
I don't like it when the stories turn scary.

3276
02:15:51,660 --> 02:15:55,340
I'm sorry if I gave you a fright, said the old man, catching himself.

3277
02:15:55,340 --> 02:15:58,580
I just thought a little adventure story might take your mind off things.

3278
02:15:58,580 --> 02:16:03,700
Yes, but a story about a man who tells a story of some other man who lies in yet another

3279
02:16:03,700 --> 02:16:07,580
story as a way of revealing that he's murdered a little girl's parents when I'm here sad

3280
02:16:07,580 --> 02:16:08,580
about my parents?

3281
02:16:08,580 --> 02:16:10,540
What are you thinking, you old kook?

3282
02:16:10,540 --> 02:16:12,020
And what was all that bird stuff?

3283
02:16:12,020 --> 02:16:15,780
You're right, you're right, the old man replied, standing up from bed.

3284
02:16:15,780 --> 02:16:18,100
I guess I just got away from myself.

3285
02:16:18,100 --> 02:16:19,100
He backed out of the room.

3286
02:16:19,340 --> 02:16:21,500
Good night, it won't happen again.

3287
02:16:21,500 --> 02:16:25,740
He opened the bedroom door and tumbled into the dark, empty vacuum of space.

3288
02:16:25,740 --> 02:16:29,740
The house fell away from him and he slowly drifted, naked now to his boxer shorts, earth

3289
02:16:29,740 --> 02:16:31,460
far off in the distance.

3290
02:16:31,460 --> 02:16:35,580
A chorus of male voices, hundreds of them, came at him from every direction.

3291
02:16:35,580 --> 02:16:37,940
You've done well, my good and favored son.

3292
02:16:37,940 --> 02:16:42,340
Squawk, know that you are good and strong and that your cock is mighty and powerful.

3293
02:16:42,340 --> 02:16:43,340
Squawk.

3294
02:16:43,340 --> 02:16:47,240
And as he crossed into the black hole, his every atom splitting into more energy than

3295
02:16:47,240 --> 02:16:48,660
powers our son.

3296
02:16:48,660 --> 02:16:53,100
His frozen form on the event horizon, trapped for eternity, was that of a man, arms spread

3297
02:16:53,100 --> 02:16:55,300
wide and reaching for something greater.

3298
02:16:55,300 --> 02:16:56,300
The end.

3299
02:16:56,300 --> 02:16:59,660
I don't get it, said the little girl.

3300
02:16:59,660 --> 02:17:02,540
Come to think of it, said the old man, me either.

3301
02:17:02,540 --> 02:17:04,100
He gave her a kiss on the head.

3302
02:17:04,100 --> 02:17:06,460
A nightingale landed on the windowsill.

3303
02:17:06,460 --> 02:17:10,380
He pulled out an old Luger he'd stolen from a Nazi during the war and then he shot the

3304
02:17:10,380 --> 02:17:11,620
bird dead.

3305
02:17:11,620 --> 02:17:12,120
The end.
