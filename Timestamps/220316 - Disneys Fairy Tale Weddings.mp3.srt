00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:26,440
Welcome to Podcast The Ride of the Second Gate, the podcast that will marry your ears to laughs.

2
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:29,880
My name is Mike Carlson, Jason Sheridan here as well.

3
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:34,880
I'm sorry, I should have, as soon as I said I didn't have anything to start the episode,

4
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:39,320
I thought of something old, something new, something Disney, something blue.

5
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,360
See, that's not even fully cooked yet.

6
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,440
That wasn't cooked, yeah. Mine was more cooked than that.

7
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:46,400
Maybe your thing has been disproven already.

8
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:50,760
Yeah, maybe Scott got in her head an idea and he said I should go with my intro and

9
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,880
I went, I said that thing you just heard.

10
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:57,560
Mine's a little deep because it requires you to maybe have watched some of the show we're

11
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:01,960
talking about, Disney's Fairy Tale Weddings, and my idea was to try to open it like the

12
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,800
host of the show Twitch might open it.

13
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:11,920
So you imagine me walking out of the castle with you guys, I guess, and I'm like, you

14
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,800
know they say that love is a many-splendored thing and there is no limit to the amount

15
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:21,440
of splendors you and I have shared, babes.

16
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:29,360
And then I call you babe an aggressive amount, which I'll just try to do throughout the show.

17
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,000
Sound good, babe?

18
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,120
Yeah, it sounds good to me.

19
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,280
I do it to give Twitch and Allison credit.

20
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,640
They were more charismatic than Ben and Lauren.

21
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,320
Oh yeah, who got shafted seemingly.

22
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,520
Yeah, yeah, there's been a reason they didn't come back.

23
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,320
I think I know the reason.

24
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,600
What is their story?

25
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,080
Is it bad?

26
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,800
No, I don't think it's bad bad.

27
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:58,640
No, Ben Higgins and Lauren Bush now were both on The Bachelor and they did get married for

28
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,640
two years and then at the moment they are no longer married.

29
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,000
At the moment, so you're saying maybe...

30
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,920
Love like a boomerang, you never know when it comes back around.

31
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,640
Oh, that's one of the ones I watched.

32
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:16,520
There's a big long, very dramatic break between the first stint of relationship and the latter.

33
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:19,200
Okay, yeah, some human interest.

34
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

35
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,840
Well, that's what you get into with this show.

36
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:27,520
We're talking about Disney's Fairy Tale Weddings, which is a show...

37
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,200
It's the show and not the idea of the Fairy Tale Weddings, which is a service that they

38
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,880
offer, but the ad is a giant...

39
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,600
I just called it an ad, right?

40
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:39,560
The show is a big ad for that service.

41
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,760
So, mine is the same thing.

42
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,040
Ad and show are the same.

43
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,680
Yes, it is an ad.

44
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,520
It tries to take...

45
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,520
It tries to...

46
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:51,360
I mean, this is a cover of Common with Disney specials in the last so many years, but it

47
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,200
tries to take any personality out of anything.

48
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:59,860
It tries to literally just show you some sort of emotional moment with the family and then

49
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:05,880
just how wonderful this very expensive wedding would be on one of their properties.

50
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:06,880
Yes.

51
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:11,960
Yeah, I think a big thing for me that sucked it out of the room was whenever regular people

52
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:16,680
had to go like, well, we're getting married at Pandora, the world of Avatar, or we got

53
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:20,320
engaged during Happily Ever After, a nighttime spectacular.

54
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:25,160
They didn't just say, this nighttime show.

55
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,120
This show, they project on the gas.

56
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,600
No, do it again.

57
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,600
Say it again.

58
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,600
This is the branding.

59
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,600
Say it again.

60
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,600
Okay, no, no, no, no.

61
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,600
You didn't do it with the space of...

62
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,320
It's the long dash, not the little dash.

63
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:40,320
It was a long space between Happily Ever After and a fairy tale...

64
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,320
What is it?

65
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,320
A fireworks celebration.

66
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,320
A nighttime spectacular.

67
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,320
No, a nighttime spectacular.

68
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,320
Say it again.

69
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,320
Yeah, there's...

70
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,680
They're cracking a whip.

71
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:54,240
There's a moment of flight of...

72
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,680
You can see someone hiccup or something, like a Pandora...

73
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,680
The world of Avatar.

74
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:02,880
They get it, but that was the best take, even though they kind of like, fuck, I can't just

75
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:06,480
say Avatar land.

76
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,400
That's really the main thing to talk about, honestly, which I think this came over in

77
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,400
an episode once before.

78
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,360
This is aggressive branding of...

79
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:16,720
Because in one of the episodes, I think this is in season two, there is a couple that makes

80
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:23,120
Disney history by being the first couple to be married in Pandora, the world of Avatar.

81
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,120
Who calls it...

82
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,320
Who has ever said this out loud?

83
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,720
James Cameron has not, unless they made him for PR purposes.

84
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,800
But he regularly doesn't refer to it as that, you would assume.

85
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,800
Yeah.

86
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,800
Yeah.

87
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,800
That's because it's not that to him.

88
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:41,880
The Na'vi, and the world of Unobtanium, and the world of the Na'vi children who we will

89
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:42,880
meet.

90
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:43,880
It's my world, he says.

91
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:48,080
What's the name of one of these subsequent Avatars?

92
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,080
The Seed Bearer?

93
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,080
The Seed Bearer?

94
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,080
Yeah.

95
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:54,640
It's Avatar, if you want to call it Avatar, the world of the Seed Bearer, then sure, that's

96
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,640
narratively correct.

97
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,640
Right.

98
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,640
But they aren't Avatar.

99
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:01,800
There's only one Avatar there, if they're lucky, and that's Jake Sully.

100
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,800
That's right.

101
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,800
But even he's not an Avatar anymore.

102
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,800
Yeah.

103
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,400
Sorry, just parsing the line.

104
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,400
No, no, I understand.

105
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,400
Yeah.

106
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:14,000
And then they, I do wonder, has anyone out there ever, I'm asking the listeners now,

107
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,840
have you ever referred to it, the full name, not as a bit?

108
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:22,320
Have you ever said Avatar, the world of Panda, whatever it's called, I've already forgot.

109
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,200
But if that's a thing you regularly say, please let us know, because I'm curious.

110
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,360
Doesn't count if you also have a theme park podcast.

111
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,360
If you also have a theme park podcast.

112
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,360
Oh, doesn't count, yeah.

113
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,360
Doesn't count.

114
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,360
That's true.

115
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:36,920
And if you have one of those and you're like us, then you probably aren't saying it right.

116
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,920
That's true.

117
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:41,400
Probably actively messing it up every time.

118
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:46,520
Yeah, so this show, this has not been on the air for a little bit.

119
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,320
This is a few years ago.

120
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,280
You don't see any masks in this show.

121
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,280
Yeah.

122
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:56,360
Right, this is kind of like 2017, 18, and it was on free form before it was archived

123
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,360
now on Disney+.

124
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,040
Yeah, I think that's right.

125
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,500
There were some specials.

126
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,500
There were some.

127
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,020
It started with these bachelor people, started with that.

128
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:07,820
What I learned, I thought it would have been like, ah, this will be one hour.

129
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:12,660
And I was like, oh no, this was made to fit a 90 minute block of air.

130
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:16,820
Because the show does get shorter, oddly enough, when it goes to TV seasons.

131
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:19,020
Like the second season, which aired.

132
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:21,060
It's only half hours?

133
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:24,020
It's like 40, 37 minutes.

134
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:26,500
So they were trying to fit that into an hour slot.

135
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:31,460
But the first bachelor one where they follow four couples, I'm like, this is too long.

136
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:33,620
This is just too much.

137
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:39,020
I was a little despondent because the hosts were not really helping move anything along.

138
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:40,020
Yeah.

139
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:43,820
So you're right about Twitch and Allison being superior.

140
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,620
Yeah, more charismatic.

141
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:50,020
And it's funny because as this show goes on, they also start showing up at the planning

142
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:51,020
sessions.

143
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:52,660
They also like, hey, Twitch.

144
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:53,660
Yes.

145
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:57,860
Well, it feels like those would show up if it was like a place they, well, if it's in

146
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:02,540
LA, if it's only Disneyland, or if it's a place they just wanted to be.

147
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:04,940
Maybe Twitch wanted to see Alaska.

148
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:06,940
So he got on the cruise.

149
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:08,460
Allison was busy.

150
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:11,980
But Twitch is still, is he still the DJ for Ellen?

151
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:12,980
Okay.

152
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:16,300
I was like, who are Twitch and Allison were both on.

153
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,420
So you think you can dance.

154
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:23,420
Twitch apparently was the DJ and then kind of became the unofficial sidekick of Ellen.

155
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:27,540
At some point, I think she made him co-executive producer of the show.

156
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:29,220
Wow.

157
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,220
Geez.

158
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:33,620
And he was her sidekick, I think on another show, one of those prime time shows.

159
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:34,620
One of those game shows.

160
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:35,620
Yeah.

161
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:36,620
Yeah.

162
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:37,620
Uh-huh.

163
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:38,620
Wouldn't know.

164
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:42,980
I don't usually watch Ellen clips that don't involve Dakota Johnson fucking her shit up.

165
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:45,980
Where Zach Galifianak is uncomfortably in the audience.

166
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:46,980
That's a great clip.

167
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:47,980
Yeah.

168
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:48,980
Refusing to dance.

169
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:49,980
Yeah.

170
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:50,980
Glaring from the audience.

171
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:51,980
Oh yeah.

172
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:52,980
That's all right.

173
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:55,980
That's our Ellen watching summed up.

174
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:57,420
Yeah.

175
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:05,140
So two seasons of the show, we, I don't think anybody watched all of it.

176
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:09,860
I think we just said in this case, let's just like, everybody do a smattering and we'll

177
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:12,460
see what we come in with.

178
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:14,100
But what's the typical thing?

179
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:18,820
Especially you said it was exhausting because there were four couples in the show.

180
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:21,460
It's two and we're bouncing back and forth.

181
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:28,740
If we haven't said this, obviously it is couples getting married or in some cases just popping

182
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:36,020
the question or renewing their vows in exotic Disney branded locations, not just Disneyland

183
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:41,700
and Disney World, but also the Adventures by Disney settings, the excursions that you

184
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:45,300
can do, the magical places that Disney can take you everywhere around the globe.

185
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,300
Sure.

186
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:48,620
Part of the signature experience wing of the company.

187
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:49,620
Of course.

188
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:54,060
Also a phrase everyone says.

189
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:58,060
So yeah, it's, it's, they're big ads.

190
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:59,740
This we know.

191
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:00,740
They're very good.

192
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:06,300
And like, of course everything we've watched our whole lives are ads, big ads, but they've

193
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:09,340
also included, you know, we're fond of these things where like, maybe you get like a fun

194
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,340
musical number.

195
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:12,460
You see Regis being silly.

196
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:17,140
They really don't, they don't give you, no, not really.

197
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,020
And well, here's a question.

198
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:24,820
Whenever you put it on, did you have any idea of what the show would be that isn't what

199
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:25,820
you got?

200
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:28,780
Cause I did a little, but you guys say what you think.

201
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:36,340
My, my fear was that it was following people who had purchased the deluxe high end weddings.

202
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:40,980
And I was going to start Googling and go like this hair to a gunpowder fortune.

203
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:47,140
And it's, it's not, this is a very casted, this is a very casted reality casting kind

204
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:48,140
of show.

205
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:55,020
I would assume these weddings were comped as part of the exchange of like, we get to

206
00:09:55,020 --> 00:10:01,780
film you and your friends and family for hours, if not days and days at a time in exchange,

207
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:08,660
you get a free wedding and pentatonix shows up or the tenors, the tenors guy.

208
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:09,660
You saw the tenors.

209
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:13,780
So I think I got bored of the episode before the tenors appeared.

210
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:14,780
Tell us about the tenors.

211
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:17,780
Well, the tenors show up in, I forget which one.

212
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:18,780
Holiday magic.

213
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:19,780
Holiday magic.

214
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:22,740
If you look this up on Disney plus, there's three categories of it.

215
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:26,180
There's the main show, there's the original special and there's holiday magic.

216
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:30,460
But I think there's a holiday magic later one that isn't on Disney plus.

217
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:31,460
Why?

218
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:32,460
I don't know.

219
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:33,820
Martina McBride would not clear the song.

220
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:38,180
Are these Christmas weddings or Christmas that time of year wedding?

221
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:40,820
That seems like an unconsiderate choice to make for people.

222
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:41,820
The tenors.

223
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,580
We're getting married.

224
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:47,020
You have to travel at Christmas time, but not for Christmas.

225
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:49,540
Separate for a, it also feels like too many premises.

226
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:50,540
Disney weddings at Christmas.

227
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:52,100
You got a lot going on.

228
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,100
That's yes.

229
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,180
And the tenors are there as well.

230
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:55,380
And the tenors are there.

231
00:10:55,380 --> 00:11:00,900
There are three guys who have tenor voices, much like the three tenors.

232
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:03,060
Not the three tenors.

233
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:05,500
These are not your dad's tenors.

234
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,500
Not your dad's.

235
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,500
They're younger tenors.

236
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,500
Okay.

237
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,100
They're not older tenors.

238
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,020
They're younger tenors.

239
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:16,820
The tenors have been around for like almost two decades and they are casted.

240
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:20,820
A woman put them together and has fired and replaced tenors.

241
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:25,700
So they're not, there are, if you look at past members, there are like 10 past members

242
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:26,700
of the tenors.

243
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:27,920
That's a long list.

244
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:31,740
So they used to be called the Canadian tenors and then they changed to just the tenors.

245
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:34,340
They've been active since 2004.

246
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:41,980
And if you look at the albums the tenors have put out, it's just covers of like, what was

247
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:42,980
it, what did they do?

248
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:47,500
They did the song from the, I Will Always Love You on the episode.

249
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:54,860
But then they'll like, is there a song like, like he lifts, you lift me up.

250
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:55,860
Groban jam.

251
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:56,860
Yeah.

252
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:57,860
I think they do stuff like that.

253
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:59,860
They, I had it here, but my phone.

254
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:03,180
I mean, there's no, you raise me.

255
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,700
Yeah.

256
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:07,460
There's no way they do a cover of Hallelujah.

257
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:10,620
Oh, let me look.

258
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:11,620
Statistically.

259
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:13,260
They do lean on me though.

260
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:15,300
Cause Pentatonix I learned sure does.

261
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:18,700
What's there, can you imitate what they sound like out loud?

262
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:19,700
Can I forget?

263
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:22,980
Are they like, is that what you're looking at?

264
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:23,980
Yeah.

265
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:27,180
In other words, they aren't doing like, no, they're not.

266
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,700
That's Pentatonix where they do like a lot of like mouth percussion.

267
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:33,980
No, there's no mouth percussion as far as I could tell from the tenors, unless that's

268
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:36,180
just a different thing they pull out for different song.

269
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:43,580
It was like, and I will always love you like that type of a thing.

270
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:44,580
Good.

271
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:45,580
Yeah.

272
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:46,580
That's a horrible.

273
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:47,580
It's very warbly.

274
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:50,420
One of them is very warbly and I really should have figured out who it is.

275
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:53,460
Cause I was looking into, is it Frazier?

276
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:54,460
Is it Victor?

277
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:55,460
Is it Clifton?

278
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:56,460
I'm not sure.

279
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:57,460
Frazier.

280
00:12:57,460 --> 00:13:03,660
Frazier, Walters, Victor, McAlef and Clifton Murray are the three tenors or no, these be

281
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:05,300
the regular tenors.

282
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,300
The tenors.

283
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,300
The tenors.

284
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:08,300
I'm sorry.

285
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,620
What is, I'm blanking on the name.

286
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:12,780
What is the group that Ricky Martin came out of where they would do?

287
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:13,780
Menudo.

288
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:14,780
Menudo.

289
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:15,780
Wouldn't they cast Menudo too?

290
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:17,500
Wouldn't they swap Menudo members in and out?

291
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,500
Oh, yeah.

292
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,500
Cause they'd outgrow it.

293
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,500
Yeah.

294
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:24,980
So there was a, he was kind of in the, like maybe pop peak Menudo.

295
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:30,060
So Ricky kind of had a longer, like a more visible spot, I would say seemingly than other

296
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:36,060
people who just like got a four month stint and then their voice deepened when you're

297
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:37,060
out.

298
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:39,060
Ricky, Ricky rolled the Menudo Keat into something.

299
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:40,060
Yeah.

300
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:41,060
Yeah.

301
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:42,060
Yeah.

302
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:43,060
I got the wrong start of it for sure.

303
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:45,820
Is there, I don't, it seems like there's not a Ricky in tenors, but maybe you're not,

304
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:46,820
you're happy in tenors.

305
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:47,820
I don't think so.

306
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:48,820
They're a Canadian group.

307
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:49,820
So it's possible.

308
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:53,220
Some of them have had maybe more success in specifically Canada.

309
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:58,460
But when I look at the list of, of former members, I don't, nothing pops to me at least,

310
00:13:58,460 --> 00:13:59,460
but I could be ignorant.

311
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:01,980
I do not know this type of music very well.

312
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:03,460
That's what Frazier's doing.

313
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:04,460
So low.

314
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:05,460
Right.

315
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:06,460
I'm not sure.

316
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:11,820
The tenors, it's a perfect modern day Disney special group.

317
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:12,820
Yeah.

318
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:15,020
Safe as hell.

319
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:20,900
Like grandma likes them and dad can appreciate the voice at least.

320
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:24,900
Like it's, it's a perfect, you could, I could picture them on any of the specials Disney's

321
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:27,220
made in the last decade or two.

322
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:32,420
I always feel kind of gaslit by the groups that appear on these things now because I'll

323
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:33,420
say, what is this?

324
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:34,420
I've never heard of this.

325
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:37,020
And it's like, they've sold 90 million records.

326
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:38,300
That was positive.

327
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:40,020
You are ignorant, sir.

328
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:42,300
Well, I don't know.

329
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:46,580
You see like, you're like the piano guys are the biggest selling or like the biggest selling

330
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:48,660
tour and you're like, huh, what's this?

331
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:52,740
It's like four guys at one piano and it's like, mother's love the piano guys.

332
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:55,020
And you're like, I've never heard of the piano guys.

333
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,580
I have seen the piano guys.

334
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:58,340
They're pretty, they're kind of silly.

335
00:14:58,340 --> 00:14:59,540
Yeah, no, I'm not against them.

336
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:01,900
I'm just saying it was one of those where it was like, what is this?

337
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:04,540
Oh, it's like the, it's way bigger than anything I like.

338
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:06,700
It's more popular than anything I like.

339
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,100
So piano guys are real.

340
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,180
That's not just a joke.

341
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,180
Not a joke.

342
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:11,180
You've never heard of the piano guys?

343
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:12,180
I had the experience in real time.

344
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:13,180
Jason, they sold over 90 million albums.

345
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:14,180
I don't know.

346
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:15,180
The piano guys are the biggest.

347
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:19,180
This is what I was saying about Yellowstone.

348
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:21,060
I'm going to watch it.

349
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:22,060
I haven't watched it yet.

350
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:23,060
I'm going to, I promise.

351
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:31,060
Every show that you watch, that is that you could fit, that's the, you can fit that entire

352
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:35,860
viewership 700 times into the viewers of Yellowstone.

353
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:38,820
The guys, the guy who created it has got your name.

354
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:40,940
Oh, is it the other Taylor Sheridan?

355
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:41,940
One of those Sheridan?

356
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:42,940
Yeah.

357
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:43,940
Oh, that's right.

358
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:44,940
Are you related?

359
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:45,940
I don't think so.

360
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:46,940
He's doing spinoffs left and right.

361
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:47,940
He can't hook up a relative.

362
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,940
I'd love to pop in there.

363
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:51,540
Stallone is on one.

364
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:53,460
Tyler Sheridan doesn't answer the phone.

365
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:55,420
Nicolette Sheridan doesn't answer the phone.

366
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:56,420
No one answers.

367
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:57,940
All the Sheridans have turned their bet.

368
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:02,260
The hotels don't let you stay there for free because it's spelled differently.

369
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:07,820
Sheridan Pierce from the One Day at a Time remake who I knew a little at UCB.

370
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:09,380
I mean, she, that's different.

371
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:12,500
That's the first person I ever met was Sheridan as first name.

372
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,500
Oh, weird.

373
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:18,340
Sheridan's, Sheridan's lookout for Sheridan's, please.

374
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:19,340
Please.

375
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:25,100
But so I get, I'm just, I think what I thought before watching this is that there might be

376
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:33,060
drama, maybe drama would be in it and that maybe, yeah, there is no, and there it's what

377
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:34,060
I've learned.

378
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:35,620
There's nothing close to drama.

379
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:39,780
These are all aspirational experiences where everything is perfect.

380
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:41,380
It is a fairy tale.

381
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:45,180
I can, cause I, I, I'm not a anti-reality TV.

382
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:50,180
Obviously there's some of it's like exploitive or whatever and some of it's, well, reality

383
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:52,260
TV is fake for the most part.

384
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:53,460
It's obviously manufactured.

385
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:57,220
Jon Taffer might not be the smartest man in the world, believe it or not, even though

386
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,220
he's portrayed that way.

387
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:59,220
What?

388
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:00,220
Get off of the podcast.

389
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,220
Shut it down.

390
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:07,420
I may have heard from people, personal interactions with him that he's not the smartest man, believe

391
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:08,420
it or not.

392
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:09,900
Are you allowed to say this?

393
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,860
I guess, yeah.

394
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:12,860
What happened?

395
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:16,500
I'm trying to think of there's even an example, but somebody was like, yeah, he's a, he's

396
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:19,620
an idiot and that show makes him look very smart.

397
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:20,620
Does it?

398
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:28,420
Well, as he stomps around like a heavy and like in a stage play of Goodfellas.

399
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:31,100
Yeah, I don't think he had a very like specific example.

400
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:34,500
It was just like, oh yeah, he's, he's not smart man.

401
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,500
He's not pleasant.

402
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:38,260
No, haven't you seen the intro of the show?

403
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:42,820
There's numbers and shirts next to him when he, he's, he's, they wouldn't do that.

404
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:44,460
If he was a beautiful mind guy.

405
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:47,900
Well, I got confused because he lights the bottles from underneath, which he says people

406
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:48,900
like.

407
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:49,900
Yeah.

408
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:50,900
And he embraces solutions, not excuses.

409
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:51,900
Exactly.

410
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,340
And he always wants people to respect women.

411
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:56,140
And he couldn't be lying about that, right?

412
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:57,140
I was duped.

413
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:59,980
I was duped by a loud man on TV.

414
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:04,420
I like my, one of my, I liked Honey Boo Boo a lot.

415
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:08,900
That was a show I really liked because I honestly, it was like the family was charming.

416
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:13,180
I think it's all turned very sad at this point from what I understand, but they were

417
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:18,420
like a funny family and like Mama June would call her vagina a biscuit and like everyone

418
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:19,420
would laugh.

419
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:20,420
I don't know.

420
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:21,420
They were like charming.

421
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:24,420
You're describing a carnival show.

422
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:27,300
Well, but I think it was, but this is a little different.

423
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:29,540
This was like, they were like kind of charming.

424
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:30,540
Yeah.

425
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:31,540
It wasn't as much of a lie.

426
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:33,100
I wasn't like, Oh, look at these freaks.

427
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:36,580
It was just like, Oh, they're funny and weird in their own ways.

428
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:40,660
But that, no, there's none of, they're not showing you like weird stuff from any of these

429
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:41,660
families.

430
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:44,700
Not one bad thing that happens to anybody in this show.

431
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:48,340
Maybe they discuss something that happened in their past, but that is to only make the

432
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:51,660
wedding more beautiful and special and poignant.

433
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:58,260
I think I also thought, well, is this a kind of reality show where it's like extreme such

434
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:03,100
and such where you're obsessed so people would get married and like, imagine like somebody

435
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:07,980
coming out in a white tuxedo that has like 900 Mickey's all over it.

436
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:11,740
Like people are kind of insane with their Disney love.

437
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:18,060
But I feel like, do you think anyone in the show would understand anything we talk about

438
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:19,260
on this podcast?

439
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:20,260
This is a big thing.

440
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:23,140
I don't think any of them are like, no, they're a big thing.

441
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:24,860
There's one guy I think I got.

442
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:25,860
I think we got it.

443
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:26,860
Okay.

444
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:27,860
So at least there's one.

445
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:34,140
I also felt this where I was like, I don't think these like, I don't think like these

446
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:37,980
people are obviously Disney fans, but how hardcore in the parks?

447
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:42,980
Because if they were really hardcore parks people, there would be people like insisting

448
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:46,780
like I want to get married in the empty body wars building.

449
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:47,980
Like you know what I mean?

450
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:51,500
Like they would be having much more outlandish.

451
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,860
Reanimate Buzzy and he's the ring bearer.

452
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:57,580
Because that's what I was actually maybe not really thinking that's what it would be, but

453
00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:00,540
I was thinking it would be more a little bit along those lines where people would have

454
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:06,100
very specialized requests from care for characters or for locations.

455
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:10,500
And like they did have the Pandora and there was somebody got married to the American Adventure,

456
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:16,740
but it was not as unusual as I would expect, especially for like lavish, expensive weddings.

457
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:20,980
No, they're all just like nice settings, but it's not weird.

458
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:23,840
Like you're not in the star tours line.

459
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,800
And then there's a special message from C3PO on the big screen.

460
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:32,800
If I'm, if you're going to drop $150,000 on a wedding, you're getting something.

461
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,800
I want that.

462
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,800
I want something like that.

463
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:39,280
Yeah, it's something really unique and specific.

464
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:43,680
But like what I've learned is because I went to the website for the fairytale weddings

465
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:47,240
and every one of these is just like a package they offer.

466
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:51,760
Because one of the more unusual ones is the Tower of Terror that you're in the courtyard

467
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:55,000
under the Tower of Terror and you think, oh, is that going to be like, it's going to be

468
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,120
kind of like a kooky gothy sort of wedding?

469
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:02,320
No, they just made it look like a regular nice courtyard and they're all nice.

470
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,000
I have no problem with any of these.

471
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,200
But then you look on the website and like, oh, it's every bit of it, the way they arrange

472
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:13,740
the flower petals on the ground, the chairs are like none of these are some custom invented

473
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:15,440
for the show thing.

474
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,760
Other than those special flourishes of like Pentatonix.

475
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:21,000
Or the Stanley Cup.

476
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:26,800
Yes, I don't believe they typically offer that the real Stanley Cup appears for hockey fans.

477
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,800
But I did.

478
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:31,280
I started cracking up when I realized what was about to happen.

479
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:36,760
Like when they they walked down a line of hockey sticks held like nice swords and at

480
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:39,440
the end was the Stanley Cup.

481
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:44,760
After a lion, after like a lion you would see like in a Chinese New Year parade.

482
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:48,800
Yeah, the rest of it, that's a good, that might be the best wedding I feel.

483
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,800
Those, I like those too.

484
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:53,600
Yes, the couple's cool.

485
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,920
The hockey passion is very sincere.

486
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:58,560
They freak when they see the Stanley Cup.

487
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,880
And there's not even, that's the thing.

488
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,680
There's not a lot of freaking in this show.

489
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,680
Right.

490
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:09,160
A lot of just kind of like when I saw the coach pull up, I was like, wow, this is the

491
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:12,520
this is the thing I imagined to make my wedding day the most special.

492
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:13,520
None of it is like, right.

493
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:17,520
It's never besides that people going like, holy shit, this happened.

494
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,520
Yeah.

495
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,880
John and Emily was that couple.

496
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:21,880
OK.

497
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:28,800
And immediately I was on board because she said, I've been to Disney World three times.

498
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,440
John has been 30 times.

499
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:34,360
It's always been his dream to have a Disney World wedding.

500
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:38,320
And she acknowledges like usually it's the bride who wants to do that.

501
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,760
And I'm like, this has been this is interesting.

502
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,760
Now you have my attention.

503
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,120
And they picked an interesting venue.

504
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,560
They picked the China Pavilion.

505
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:49,200
He's Chinese, Chinese.

506
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,480
The better that is a little more specific.

507
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,000
That is that that was cool.

508
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,280
And they I think the the human interest stuff interested me.

509
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:05,640
The cultural traditions where like they do a Chinese tea ceremony, the Pandora couple

510
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:15,480
a couple jump the broom, which is a popular for African-American weddings in this country.

511
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:18,120
I thought were interesting touches.

512
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,120
Sure.

513
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,400
And that was better than just like, OK, here's the coach.

514
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,400
All right.

515
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,760
Everyone feels like Prince and Princess.

516
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:29,240
You know, I feel like at a certain point you could feel the people making the show go like,

517
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:34,000
oh, we can only talk about people feeling like royalty so many times.

518
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,080
We have to.

519
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:38,880
They started to get more stories where it's like, oh, we had a wedding plan and then we

520
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,320
had someone died.

521
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,240
And so we just did a courthouse thing and we always wanted a big wedding.

522
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,240
You know?

523
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,240
Yeah.

524
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:54,040
There's an early one where you watch the it get solved, that it's going to be the castle.

525
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:57,240
And it's this is what I'm talking about in terms of the person presents himself as the

526
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,720
biggest Disney fan.

527
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,200
It's the most standard.

528
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:03,040
Like, like, so what are we thinking in terms of location?

529
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:06,920
Well, something I've always really loved is the castle.

530
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:10,160
I like standing under it and looking up at it.

531
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:13,520
And when it gets lit up, I've always thought it was so magical.

532
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,880
Well, I think we could do that.

533
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:16,880
What?

534
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,760
When they told me that I was going to get married in front of the castle, I thought,

535
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:23,160
wow, this is my ultimate dream come true.

536
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:26,680
There's nothing interesting about any of that.

537
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,280
Nothing unique about one bit of it.

538
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,680
Is that the one with rain?

539
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,680
Rain?

540
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,680
I don't know.

541
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:34,000
So there's one where it rains or is there someone named rain?

542
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,640
There's a pouring rain, like Florida rain.

543
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:40,540
There's a couple that were going to get married in front of the castle.

544
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:41,840
First off, they're getting married at midnight.

545
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:46,040
A lot of these weddings take place very late at night or at sunrise.

546
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,040
Right.

547
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,040
That's the deal.

548
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:52,480
If you do this in reality and they stipulate on the site, like, just so you know, it's

549
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,480
going to be the timing.

550
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,480
Yeah.

551
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,960
Unless the money is real good.

552
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:56,960
Yeah.

553
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:57,960
Yeah.

554
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:00,920
But that couple, they say they were getting married in front of the castle.

555
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:05,000
The ceremony was set up halfway down Main Street.

556
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,040
And so technically, the castle is in the background.

557
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:11,560
But I'm like, is there a tarp covering Main?

558
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:12,720
Can they stop the rain?

559
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,720
Can they cover the rain?

560
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:16,600
Is that why they're not directly in front of the castle?

561
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,960
Is that what happening here?

562
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:18,960
Oh, maybe.

563
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,520
But they didn't go into that.

564
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:23,760
I would have thought they would have taken the opportunity to go like, and Disney weddings

565
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,640
are prepared for any inevitability.

566
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:29,880
Well, yeah, because that would be a problem being solved.

567
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:30,880
Right, right, right.

568
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:34,720
This is what they are unwilling to show.

569
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:39,760
That mixed with the this perhaps an obvious thing about it.

570
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:42,960
Let me say really quick, people have suggested this topic when we threw out.

571
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,960
Let's do what second gates do you want?

572
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,640
Amanda Hasaka threw it out.

573
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,760
Thanks, Amanda.

574
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,200
Great supporter of the show.

575
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:54,300
And I realized also, Dashiell Driscoll, a friend from Funny or Die, mentioned it a long

576
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:55,300
time ago, too.

577
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:59,160
And he brought up just to shout him out, quote his tweet.

578
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:03,040
My only note is I could use a dollar amount ticker in the corner for every decision.

579
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,040
I had the same thing.

580
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,040
I had that thought, too.

581
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,040
Yeah.

582
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:08,880
Now, Jason, as you said, there's been a little bit of sleuthing done here.

583
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,280
I believe that Disney pays for all of it.

584
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:16,720
So while these are all things that you could technically make happen, we do.

585
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:19,240
Probably you're not getting the stars.

586
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:21,400
You're not getting Tori Kelly to come.

587
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,220
OK, it's not on TV.

588
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:29,140
But then also, yeah, the money amount, because that's fast and every like you are constantly

589
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:35,920
seeing decisions occur that like, OK, well, that's you just that's a house that you just

590
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,480
Yeah.

591
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,480
All right.

592
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,480
You can have that one house, please.

593
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:44,960
A regular wedding in a regular place is so expensive.

594
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:45,960
Yes.

595
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:50,200
So multiply every this every like price that that costs by like 10.

596
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,200
Yeah.

597
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,440
Maybe 20, depending on what the ask is.

598
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,440
Uh huh.

599
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:59,640
But this is what like and it's what you would love to know in kind of if this were a different

600
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:03,880
kind of show, if it were a super sweet 16 sort of show where it would keep like, ching,

601
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:07,040
ching, ching, and then you get an amount at the end.

602
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:09,460
But that's not what that's not what Disney's about.

603
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:12,940
But not only that, you can't find like you can't find that anywhere.

604
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:16,480
This show has, I think, like a press embargo around it.

605
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,480
You can't find a review.

606
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:18,480
Yeah.

607
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,360
It mentions what what Dashiell said or what we're saying.

608
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,360
You can't.

609
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:25,360
There's no like we know there's nobody who's leaked.

610
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,920
Like I did a Disney fairytale wedding.

611
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:30,000
That doesn't occur.

612
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,200
Like you're not allowed to.

613
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,560
This is like military secrets, all this stuff.

614
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,720
Yeah.

615
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:38,120
All I know from I guess people there's like one person or two that I've known has done

616
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,120
like a version of this.

617
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:43,320
But like, yeah, like characters are all a cart, essentially.

618
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:47,280
If you wanted a character to show up and I don't know the dollar amount, I guess I can

619
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:51,640
add I can see if we can ask someone how much is it for like certain characters.

620
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,680
I think certain characters are more than others.

621
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:59,320
So there's like there's like a wine list of characters essentially that you can pick from

622
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:01,560
and you have to make a decision.

623
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,280
I wonder, like, what do we think?

624
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,280
What do you think it is?

625
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,280
I don't know the answer.

626
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:09,720
Like, what do you think it is to have Mickey show up at your wedding?

627
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:14,080
Well, Mickey would probably be the top, even though they have the most Mickey costumes.

628
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:18,840
But maybe Mickey is he's still expensive, but maybe he's not as expensive as getting

629
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:21,720
like one of the rescuers.

630
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:22,720
Honest John or something?

631
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,720
Blue in tailspin.

632
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:24,720
Yeah, right, right.

633
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:25,720
Exactly.

634
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,280
They got to dig out of storage.

635
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,280
Right.

636
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,280
They have to really do.

637
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,280
Yeah.

638
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,280
So maybe that's more money.

639
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Yeah.

640
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Got it somewhere.

641
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
I've seen pictures.

642
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Uh huh.

643
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Or Leonardo Columbus.

644
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,920
Oh, if you want Leonardo Columbus to show up.

645
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:44,880
Oh, described my art Disney fairy tale weddings would be so.

646
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,760
I also thought, can I get on this lid?

647
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:49,760
I wish they were doing the show because I could like fool my way into this and before

648
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:53,640
we get married and I could like make them make it a big pain in the ass.

649
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,640
Right.

650
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:58,960
First say like, oh yes, our dream is to get married in Disneyland.

651
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:05,120
What we want to do is get married, you know, in front of let's say, uh, what would be like

652
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,120
the space.

653
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:10,480
You know, you know what you do is like, don't like leave it open ended, but you don't specifically

654
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:16,800
define it, but you say like, uh, you know, Disney, uh, Disney is a magical place and

655
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,320
where any, you can dream up anything.

656
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:21,200
And we think that marriage is the ultimate, the next frontier.

657
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:26,080
We're going to take things in the next year and we're just going to see where things land.

658
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,080
So I don't know.

659
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:29,920
You tell me where I should have my wedding.

660
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:33,840
But then once we get into, sorry, once we get into the, like the details, I go, okay,

661
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:34,920
so what I really want is to happen.

662
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:40,360
I want you remember Leonardo Columbus from, I want him to, uh, a zip line down from space

663
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,360
mountain.

664
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:45,880
He comes during the ceremony, by the way, he comes in, uh, he knocks, uh, my bride to

665
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:51,480
be out of the way and he grabs my hand and says, we need to save the future.

666
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:56,760
And then, and then he looks at two worlds plays.

667
00:29:56,760 --> 00:30:01,640
He gives me some kind of an orb, some sort of orb that is full of energy.

668
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:08,120
Though the, the big robotic dinosaur rises up from out of the ground from the Epcot show

669
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:09,120
splash tackler.

670
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:11,520
You remember you've got it somewhere.

671
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,680
It's in storage.

672
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,200
Go crack it out of the crate.

673
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:18,800
I don't care if it's like, if you auction it off to somebody in North Carolina, go find

674
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:19,800
it.

675
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:20,800
Go find it.

676
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:24,840
We always wanted to get married on dinosaur and animal kingdom.

677
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:28,760
And when the ride at the end stops, we want the dinosaur to come and roar at us.

678
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:34,360
But instead of roaring, he says, I now pronounce you man and wife.

679
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:40,440
I want the officiant to be the puppet people from the parade, from the millennium celebration.

680
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,440
Okay.

681
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,840
Now I have a, there's a guest that's there.

682
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:44,880
His name is Jason Sheridan.

683
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:50,760
I want the nightmare doll faced men from spectral magic to surround him in the middle of the

684
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:55,880
ceremony and carry him in a chair away and carry him out of the park.

685
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:58,160
Beat the shit out of him in the beginning.

686
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,160
Get a roll of quarters.

687
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,160
I'll get quarters.

688
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:03,960
A roll of quarters and beat him with them.

689
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:06,800
You think we look weird, do you?

690
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:07,960
Who's weird now?

691
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,760
This is the, I would want this.

692
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:13,160
I want like little antics during the ceremony with the various characters.

693
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:17,080
This is what I would ask, especially if Disney was fronting, if Disney was paying for it.

694
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:22,440
If we had like fooled them into like, oh great, these reasonable people want a nice standard

695
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,440
Disney wedding.

696
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,120
Dream Finder and Figment do the ceremony.

697
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:28,280
Dream Finder is trying to do it normally.

698
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:31,360
Figment is mucking it up.

699
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:40,560
Like the same, like saying bad snarky stuff, lewd stuff, farting.

700
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:45,080
Three course meal, dig out the menus from spoodles cause everything's coming off there.

701
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:50,520
Spoodles of course, the Italian restaurant on the boardwalk when it first opened.

702
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:53,800
I want Michael Eisner to perform the ceremony.

703
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:54,800
I don't care, get him.

704
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,960
I know he doesn't work here anymore.

705
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:57,960
Make it happen.

706
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:03,440
This is where you run all of this game on them and then they just say like, do you want

707
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:08,320
the Grand Floridian or do you want the Polynesian?

708
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:12,400
Write an amount of money on this piece of paper and it better be, there better be at

709
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:17,200
least five numbers on there, if not six, and we will tell you where we will do it.

710
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,080
Do you understand, sir?

711
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,560
I hope you enjoyed your jokes.

712
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:23,800
Yeah, they'll be mad at me.

713
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:26,520
And then they would edit out any fun.

714
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:31,200
Cause that would all have been on camera, all those demands.

715
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:36,560
Did we find anything in here that where it wasn't, they weren't able to zap it all, where

716
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:39,600
they weren't able to put it all through the bland machine?

717
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,680
Is there anything notable enough?

718
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:49,560
Dominique and Joe have like real strong Italian accents and that was a close.

719
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:51,120
What else is up with their wedding?

720
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,640
Oh, nothing.

721
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,720
It's a boring wedding.

722
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,720
Where is it?

723
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:56,720
Hold on a minute.

724
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,720
It's a shit.

725
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:00,640
Are they the Philly people?

726
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:06,600
One of them works at Urban Coal House, which is a restaurant that the family owns.

727
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:09,400
You got that detail, but not where the wedding.

728
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,760
I can open up my Disney Plus real quick.

729
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,760
Yeah, there's two locations.

730
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,040
Joe is a police officer.

731
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:21,800
Dominique is, she's a waitress and something else.

732
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:27,560
By the way, let me tell you the point where I realized for sure that Disney pays for it

733
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:33,520
is that one of the, one of the grooms was telling their backstory and they were describing

734
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:36,680
a point in their life where they had to get a second job.

735
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:42,080
I thought no one who would actually be able to afford this kind of thing has ever needed

736
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,640
a second job in their life.

737
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:49,920
These are all people who are starting pretty high tier and only move up.

738
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:50,920
Yes, that is, yes.

739
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:51,920
I noticed that as well.

740
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,520
That was what I was like, I wonder, do they pay?

741
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,520
Oh, okay.

742
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:55,520
Yeah, yeah.

743
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:59,080
Yeah, but a lot of the people's jobs tell you and they aren't bad jobs.

744
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:02,920
You hear a lot of normal jobs and you're like, hang on.

745
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:06,880
I think people could not afford a $400,000 wedding.

746
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:07,880
No.

747
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:08,880
Yeah.

748
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:09,880
No.

749
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,480
The tenors are not cheap.

750
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:16,280
There's a lot of military, but I think it's all, you know, under a certain rank.

751
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:19,160
It's not the top brass who are raking in a lot of money.

752
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:20,760
No five star generals got married.

753
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:23,400
There's no five stars pulling in like six or seven fingers.

754
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:26,600
They didn't do Mark Millay's wedding.

755
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:27,960
What was that guy's name?

756
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:30,080
He's the Trump guy, wasn't he?

757
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,080
Oh yeah.

758
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:32,560
Norman Schwartz gots.

759
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,560
But there is.

760
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,560
But there is Norman.

761
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:40,200
And I've always been a big Disney fan.

762
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:42,000
Wesley Clark didn't get married.

763
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,480
Mark Millay, I think.

764
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,720
He's the chairman of the joint chief of staff anyway.

765
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:47,720
Okay.

766
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:49,760
I'm looking for where they got married here.

767
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:50,760
Okay.

768
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,760
It's a holiday.

769
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:52,760
It was a holiday.

770
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:53,760
What was the, oh, okay.

771
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:58,280
Did you, you found them, what was, that they were interesting?

772
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:02,640
I just found that they had like, they talk like this and I like to imitate it basically.

773
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:07,040
I like, it was a fun voice to do and that's like as close as I could find to something

774
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,040
interesting.

775
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:13,560
But you're saying they didn't communicate just by screaming at each other.

776
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:14,920
No, they cut that out.

777
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:18,840
Well that must've been hard to cut around in the editing room because I grew up around

778
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:21,480
a lot of people like that and they only know how to scream.

779
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,880
Well they said like, oh, they go, oh yeah.

780
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,840
They're like, well, she's always around family.

781
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:25,840
All the family.

782
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:29,440
Every night, every Sunday night, we're always with the study family members and they're

783
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,440
all here.

784
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,840
All the family members are here.

785
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,880
He's complaining about Sunday night dinner again.

786
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:36,000
We see his family all the time.

787
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,480
Oh, they were Grand Floridian it appears.

788
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,480
Okay.

789
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,480
Yeah.

790
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,480
That's, I could see why you'd forget.

791
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:48,280
Like those ones are, and then also like, I'm sorry, but the, any Adventures by Disney

792
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,280
ones get out of here.

793
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:53,400
I didn't want to, if I'm not looking at a fake rock, then why am I?

794
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,400
Right.

795
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,400
I don't know.

796
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,400
You can get married in Europe.

797
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,400
Sure.

798
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,400
Why am I?

799
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,360
Why is that on this show?

800
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:03,400
Almost any scene that where there wasn't a visible Disney park.

801
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,720
I'm like, yeah.

802
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,360
And 10 for 10 seconds.

803
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,360
It 10 seconds.

804
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:11,120
Unless you bring Leonardo Columbus to Europe or something, then what's the point?

805
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:17,120
Like if you're going to get like the entire Disney afternoon lineup or something.

806
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,120
Yeah.

807
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:19,120
Why?

808
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,120
Yeah.

809
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:21,120
Bonkers isn't going to be there.

810
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,120
Who gives a shit?

811
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:24,120
You know, that's what I, I mean, I say that a lot of, oh, yeah.

812
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:27,840
I say that a lot about a lot of things, but especially these weddings.

813
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:28,840
You're disappointed a lot.

814
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:29,840
Bonkers isn't here.

815
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:30,840
Who gives a shit?

816
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:34,560
Most of your life doesn't have bonkers in it, unfortunately.

817
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,560
Most of my life does not have bonkers.

818
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:40,080
Zero bonkers in this show, right, Michael?

819
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,080
Zero bonkers.

820
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:45,080
I, yeah, I'm looking through my list.

821
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:48,720
I don't, there's one where they added a little extra ad where it's.

822
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:49,720
The copper tone?

823
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:50,720
No, I missed that one.

824
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:51,720
Right here.

825
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:52,920
You say yours F.

826
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:58,560
Mine was that there's a little like, um, there are a few people are suddenly taking pictures

827
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,320
on some old sleek white camera.

828
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,000
Then you hear people kind of mumbling.

829
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,520
Whoa, that's so cool.

830
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,520
Yeah.

831
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:05,520
That's right.

832
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,160
It's the HP sprocket or something.

833
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:08,160
Yeah.

834
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,320
It takes the picture to pictures print right away.

835
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,320
All right.

836
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:14,160
Then back to the, like it is deep embedded.

837
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,520
What did copper tone do?

838
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:21,520
I think maybe it was in the, the long special, but there was like suddenly the host would

839
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:26,000
be like, and you know, lots of beautiful outdoor venues, but if you're outdoors, don't forget

840
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
sunscreen copper.

841
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,000
And like, and then it was just a copper tone card.

842
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,240
And then there were two of them.

843
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,240
It happened like twice.

844
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:40,320
I mean, weddings are so from my, my going to weddings, weddings are fascinating times

845
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:43,960
when things happen and people are stressed because they want it to be right.

846
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:46,800
And people's personalities come out and you see the best of them and you see the worst

847
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,800
of them.

848
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:53,880
I am so impressed at how bland they made it because you would have to not any wedding

849
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:54,880
I've ever been to.

850
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:59,360
There's like 10 interesting things that happen leading up to it or like during the ceremony

851
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:02,760
or somebody's too, I mean, they're never going to say like somebody's too drunk at the Disney

852
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:07,640
wedding, but still I like, I'm so impressed at how they've managed to like completely

853
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:09,600
neuter these things.

854
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:16,640
There is one, there's one groomsmen party and they're in a hotel room and they do a

855
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:22,120
cheers and they are holding glasses that appear to have brown liquor in them.

856
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,600
It's never acknowledged.

857
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,480
That's the most body.

858
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,480
There was a,

859
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:32,240
Wait, wait, wait, are you saying, are you saying that in those glasses are Scott's favorite

860
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,360
term adult libations?

861
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:38,880
It's not a friend.

862
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:45,680
I mean, it could have been Scott's other favorite libation on sweetened iced tea.

863
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:49,560
So I also drink a lot of that too.

864
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:54,040
So I mean, it'd be weird if they were just drinking shots of like a pure leaf.

865
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,040
Don't get a kidney stone.

866
00:38:55,040 --> 00:39:01,560
If a relative got sick or too drunk or something, it would never be in there.

867
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:02,720
Certainly would not be in there.

868
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:06,220
There's everything you want to see that there's a wedding in the Italian pavilion and then

869
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:11,680
somebody has to run out and barfs in the bath tub.

870
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,560
That's the interesting.

871
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:19,080
You want to see somebody in the shadow of Spaceship Earth giving his best man speech

872
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:26,280
and doing the thing where he's telling too many embarrassing stories in a bad way.

873
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:32,140
Like, yeah, like, you know, man, when we were with those women down in Houston, I told this

874
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:36,240
guy's never getting married, but because we spent so many weeks with these women, these

875
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:39,480
two strange women we had just met and I was like, you're not going to be able to give

876
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,800
up this life, bro.

877
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,800
You ain't going to be able to give in.

878
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:42,800
Look at this.

879
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,880
He gave it up because he found abroad.

880
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:45,880
You know what?

881
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:51,320
And like, because I've seen this happen before where like people misjudge a speech at a wedding.

882
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:53,160
This happens all the time.

883
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:58,640
Or like I've edited a best man speech before where I'm like, you got to take this out,

884
00:39:58,640 --> 00:39:59,640
man.

885
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:02,360
Six weeks in Houston.

886
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:03,360
Got to go.

887
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:06,800
So it's like 45 minutes before the speech and I was like, hey, read me the speech you're

888
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:07,800
about to give.

889
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:08,800
Wow.

890
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:09,800
You just had a feeling.

891
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:10,800
Yeah.

892
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,120
And I was like, this got to go.

893
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:13,120
This has got to go.

894
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:18,080
This wasn't, wasn't so bad, but I was like, these are, these got to go.

895
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:19,080
You dodged the bullet.

896
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:23,280
There was no stopping uncle Anthony from punching Ratatouille because he was still mad that

897
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:26,320
France didn't support us in the Iraq war.

898
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:30,800
Yeah, that's the show.

899
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:33,520
I mean, my goodness, that's a great idea.

900
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:39,000
Yeah, God, I don't, I mean, the only thing you sometimes get some people who are like

901
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
fine.

902
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,360
They seem cool.

903
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:48,240
There's two women who love soccer and then their ceremony is performed by Brandi Chastain,

904
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,960
the famous soccer player.

905
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:50,960
Sure.

906
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:53,480
And she reveals herself by kicking a ball at them.

907
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:54,480
Yeah.

908
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,480
And she seems great.

909
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,480
Great.

910
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,480
Everybody seems great.

911
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:58,480
Yeah.

912
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,480
She got ordained to do that wedding.

913
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:00,480
They said.

914
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:01,480
That's pretty cool.

915
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:02,480
That's cute.

916
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,480
That's nice.

917
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:04,480
You know what I actually realize now?

918
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:09,360
The closest thing to anything interesting is that in the episode with Taylor and Tyler

919
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:14,040
who got married about American adventure, they do say the word poop.

920
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,040
Whoa.

921
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,040
Right.

922
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,720
Because she's getting her graduate degree.

923
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:18,720
Yes.

924
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,920
She works with like animal feces essentially.

925
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,900
And they say poop a couple of times.

926
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:27,020
And there's some of that like comedy music like fun, like, isn't this a funny little

927
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:28,160
thing or whatever.

928
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,800
And I was like, well, that is pretty bawdy Disney.

929
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:31,800
Okay.

930
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:35,360
I have a couple of things about Taylor and Tyler though.

931
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:41,760
One, the rotunda at the American experience.

932
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:42,760
American adventure.

933
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:43,760
American adventure.

934
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:44,760
I just blanked on that.

935
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:45,760
That's okay.

936
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:49,960
That's, you have all of Epcot at your disposal.

937
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:50,960
That's no.

938
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,240
Where would you, what would you plus it up?

939
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,240
Where would you take them?

940
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:58,000
Well, no, I thought the ones like in the Italy pavilion and the even the UK pavilion, certainly

941
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
the China pavilion.

942
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,720
I mean, Italy and China were looked pretty good.

943
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:06,440
The British one was interesting because like all, everything was like edible.

944
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:09,120
Like they had all these edible place settings and like.

945
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,120
Well the Mexico pavilion.

946
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:14,480
I mean, yeah, the Mexico pavilion is incredible.

947
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,800
What we now know is a Joe roadie mural.

948
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:17,800
Right.

949
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:18,800
Right.

950
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,480
By that in their blue Bayou.

951
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,480
Yeah.

952
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:22,480
Equivalent.

953
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:23,480
Yeah.

954
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:24,480
I don't think that's one.

955
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:25,480
That's the thing.

956
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:26,480
They're all ones.

957
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:29,060
I just realized the math of it once I went to the website and saw these are all things

958
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:32,040
that are, these are all specific packages they offer.

959
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,440
And that are often are just like, this is, this does look like a nice pretty place.

960
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:38,920
They usually don't have too much like theme parky character.

961
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:40,440
There's one I don't know.

962
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:42,580
Maybe there was an episode with this, but I didn't see it.

963
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:47,900
But off of the actual list, the one that I would do is you can get married by the fake

964
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:49,320
rocks in Canada.

965
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:50,400
Oh, right.

966
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:51,400
That's not bad.

967
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:52,760
Yeah, that I would do.

968
00:42:52,760 --> 00:43:00,000
However, they do specify that that one you can only do, you can only have 60 people and

969
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:05,720
you can only do a nine o'clock Sarah, nine a.m. ceremony, which is luxurious compared

970
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:07,720
to a lot of the other right.

971
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:09,200
Seven a.m. like a call.

972
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:10,200
Yeah.

973
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:14,320
That's maybe maybe the most interesting thing in a way is that is the late night nature

974
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:15,320
of it.

975
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:19,040
And then the like, because they and they try to just like slip it in there and ignore it.

976
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:22,360
But there's one where they're showing the bride getting her makeup done.

977
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:26,120
And then there's the timestamp in the bottom and it says two a.m.

978
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:27,120
Yes.

979
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:29,240
Because she was getting married at sunrise.

980
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:29,920
Yes.

981
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:30,920
Yeah.

982
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:31,920
Yeah.

983
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:35,080
The ceremony then is that's that's a Disneyland one that's in front of the castle and that's

984
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:37,080
at five fifty.

985
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:38,080
Yes.

986
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:39,080
Sir, walking up.

987
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:40,080
Yeah.

988
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:42,680
So you're like hammered by 10 a.m.

989
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:43,680
I think so.

990
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:47,080
Well, then they showed the ceremony, which then they then you're out of the park.

991
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:50,280
Now you move to like a Disneyland Hotel ballroom.

992
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:51,280
But you.

993
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:52,280
Yeah.

994
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:55,800
If there's a what meal are we doing eggs at this point?

995
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:56,800
Are we?

996
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:57,800
Right.

997
00:43:57,880 --> 00:43:59,520
Food at a wedding feels weird to me.

998
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:00,520
Kind of.

999
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:01,520
What else are you going to do?

1000
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:02,520
It's a good nine a.m.

1001
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:09,400
And then and then like getting drunk is I mean, look, I did it for Galaxy's Edge.

1002
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:12,960
I was I was off on Blue Wine at eight fifty.

1003
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:16,120
But yeah, but that's not that's not wedding drunk.

1004
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:20,880
I think we had like a little fun drink, a couple one or two drinks at eight or nine

1005
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:23,320
is different than wedding drunk.

1006
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:24,920
I think open bar drunk.

1007
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:26,480
I think it's quiches and omelette.

1008
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:30,600
I've been to like when I was very young, we went to like a morning wedding that was

1009
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:32,800
like an inn restaurant.

1010
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:33,800
Those can be fine.

1011
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:35,920
I've been early weddings that are fine.

1012
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:38,240
But the but it's six a.m.

1013
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:39,240
It's that's interesting.

1014
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:40,240
Nutty.

1015
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:42,280
The signature drink is a red eye.

1016
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:44,320
It's coffee with a shot of espresso.

1017
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:46,160
Yeah, I want to know the hours.

1018
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:47,440
And when does that end?

1019
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:50,880
When does this say like the reception end at that time?

1020
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:53,000
Is it like over noon?

1021
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Could be.

1022
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Yeah.

1023
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,240
And then, yeah, you're like hammered.

1024
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:59,240
Then you wander into the park like blackout drunk.

1025
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:00,240
Yeah.

1026
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:02,960
Afterward or figure out Jeannie Plus.

1027
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:06,040
Hopefully that's not the first day there.

1028
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:08,200
Yeah, because they're like switching lightning lane.

1029
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:10,760
You don't know what what's what what's lightning lane anymore.

1030
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:17,240
This is you know, Mike, you're heading to a wedding at some point at some point.

1031
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:23,960
And the like my wedding, which you two were not at bizarrely.

1032
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:27,520
You refused.

1033
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:28,520
We asked.

1034
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:30,360
I'll be spending plenty of time with these guys.

1035
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:31,360
I think they don't know.

1036
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:32,360
We didn't know each other.

1037
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:33,360
Yes, you weren't at my wedding.

1038
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:39,800
But the we like was the greatest night of my life legitimately.

1039
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:41,000
It was so wonderful.

1040
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:45,920
But I think part of it was all right, we're going to we need a venue where we can drag

1041
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:47,200
it out as long as we can.

1042
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:48,520
And then we need an after party.

1043
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:49,520
Yeah, yeah.

1044
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:53,940
To like go and go and go because the quick wrap it up nature of so many places that look

1045
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:55,860
nice to get married.

1046
00:45:55,860 --> 00:45:58,060
I think that's a brick wall you're going to hit.

1047
00:45:58,060 --> 00:46:01,100
So like having to as much as getting married in front of the castle would be cool.

1048
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:04,700
The idea that like, all right, seven a.m.

1049
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:05,700
Air raid signals.

1050
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:06,700
Yeah, get out.

1051
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:07,700
Get out, grandma.

1052
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:10,700
There's OK, there's three errors you can make of the wedding.

1053
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:12,300
OK, here's what I'll say.

1054
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:14,300
And you're you're absolutely right.

1055
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:20,460
A wedding shouldn't be too short because there's a magic hour hour or two where it gets really

1056
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:21,460
fun.

1057
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:23,620
Probably because everyone's a little drunker.

1058
00:46:23,620 --> 00:46:29,500
But if your wedding is like seven to eleven, too short, you need that extra like hour or

1059
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:30,500
two.

1060
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:32,180
Second, you need good music.

1061
00:46:32,180 --> 00:46:35,540
You need a DJ that's not going to play the same YMCA crap.

1062
00:46:35,540 --> 00:46:37,380
We talked about this before.

1063
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:39,460
Our don't play list was so wrong.

1064
00:46:39,460 --> 00:46:44,380
I have I have a fantasy that I will just I will DJ my own wedding.

1065
00:46:44,380 --> 00:46:47,860
I will just put an iPad with a playlist of stuff, but I will also have my phone so I

1066
00:46:47,860 --> 00:46:50,780
can remote control and just add on the fly if I want.

1067
00:46:50,820 --> 00:46:52,340
I think this is something I'll do.

1068
00:46:52,340 --> 00:46:54,980
Maybe somebody will have to man the control.

1069
00:46:54,980 --> 00:46:58,380
You tried that at birthday party like every generation of app.

1070
00:46:58,380 --> 00:46:59,380
You are there.

1071
00:46:59,980 --> 00:47:02,180
My 30th birthday was at was it M bar?

1072
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:03,940
What was that bar?

1073
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:06,100
So, yeah, yeah. And it was it was all Prince.

1074
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:10,940
I played the music for the whole bar all night from my phone.

1075
00:47:10,940 --> 00:47:12,140
You want to do this at the wedding?

1076
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:13,220
Yes. Wow.

1077
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:14,340
I think I do.

1078
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:17,700
Yeah, but you lucked out because that bar scene like was about to clap like that bar

1079
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:20,380
scene like it was about to go out of business the next day.

1080
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:21,660
And I think it did.

1081
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:25,620
And then we learned Prince played a secret show down the street down the street that

1082
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:27,020
night and that night.

1083
00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:28,980
Oh, my God. That we didn't know about.

1084
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:33,460
And all of a sudden, like 11 p.m., people were like, you know, Prince is playing at

1085
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:36,900
the palladium because we were like literally in the same zip code.

1086
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:40,980
Yes. And I was like, should I leave all the people I invited to go see him?

1087
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:42,580
Because he was starting late.

1088
00:47:42,580 --> 00:47:44,500
And then we started tweeting at him to try to come.

1089
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:46,540
But he's I think he played way past.

1090
00:47:46,860 --> 00:47:48,540
You're trying to get him to come to your birthday.

1091
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:51,620
Well, because it had been advertised as a Prince birthday.

1092
00:47:51,620 --> 00:47:52,620
It was my 30th birthday.

1093
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:55,660
And it was it was. But you thought you thought that was plausible.

1094
00:47:56,140 --> 00:47:57,420
Well, we're having a Prince birthday.

1095
00:47:57,420 --> 00:47:59,220
You are famously eccentric man.

1096
00:47:59,220 --> 00:48:01,340
I was going to say suddenly shows up at City Walk.

1097
00:48:01,340 --> 00:48:05,460
Obviously, we weren't like betting a ton of money on it, but he was like three blocks

1098
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:06,460
away. Yeah.

1099
00:48:06,740 --> 00:48:10,300
So but your plan was to tweet at Prince.

1100
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:12,020
Well, we weren't like Prince's check.

1101
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:16,140
Check my mentions. He was he was on Twitter at the time.

1102
00:48:16,340 --> 00:48:17,940
He was on Twitter at the time.

1103
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:20,340
I don't know. That's the that's the question.

1104
00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:23,340
Well, of course, I knew he wasn't going to I knew it wasn't probably going to happen.

1105
00:48:23,340 --> 00:48:24,420
But I was like, oh, that's funny.

1106
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:28,220
Tell tell his Twitter account that there's a Prince themed party.

1107
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:30,860
Yes. Which I don't think is so crazy.

1108
00:48:30,860 --> 00:48:34,380
But obviously, we weren't like sitting there for hours going, please come.

1109
00:48:35,020 --> 00:48:39,580
There was like 20 people, 20 plus people all trying to tweet at.

1110
00:48:39,580 --> 00:48:42,020
So like it would have been noticeable.

1111
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:45,420
Yeah. Yeah. So so yeah, it wasn't like, oh, my God, we have to.

1112
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:46,660
It was just like, oh, that's funny.

1113
00:48:46,660 --> 00:48:49,900
Let's hope he sees that he's like a bunch of dorks.

1114
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:51,980
They're probably going to try to kill me.

1115
00:48:51,980 --> 00:48:52,980
I would have said.

1116
00:48:52,980 --> 00:48:57,060
But I would have said I would have said if because it was the branding was such

1117
00:48:57,060 --> 00:48:59,700
that this was a party where we were only playing his music.

1118
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:02,780
It's pretty weird. I say it's unlikely that he comes.

1119
00:49:02,820 --> 00:49:05,580
But this is a thing that clubs and stuff do all of these.

1120
00:49:05,580 --> 00:49:06,860
He's like, I got to get there.

1121
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:08,020
He was my music.

1122
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:10,500
That's a way he could have walks away.

1123
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:12,300
He could have walked to this thing.

1124
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:14,380
It just seemed a little funny of a coincidence.

1125
00:49:14,380 --> 00:49:18,180
That's all I'm saying. Crazy stuff happens in Hollywood when the crazy stuff.

1126
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:20,380
He played WWF New York.

1127
00:49:20,380 --> 00:49:24,020
We don't know why that wasn't like we're playing your music.

1128
00:49:24,020 --> 00:49:24,940
Come hang.

1129
00:49:24,940 --> 00:49:26,380
Picked a bunch of equipment.

1130
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:29,180
He would have come if he didn't have his his concert.

1131
00:49:29,180 --> 00:49:31,860
If his concert hadn't gone so late, I think he would have come.

1132
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:35,860
I think your your expectation is not unrealistic, but I think it's a little.

1133
00:49:35,860 --> 00:49:40,060
It's a little you're not so out of the realm of the.

1134
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:41,380
I just the proximity.

1135
00:49:41,380 --> 00:49:44,060
If he was in the valley and we were in Hollywood, I would say no way.

1136
00:49:44,380 --> 00:49:47,340
Yeah. But it was it was a mere blocks over.

1137
00:49:47,540 --> 00:49:49,780
It's a nice stroll to somebody who would have driven him.

1138
00:49:49,780 --> 00:49:53,500
And so it's already is like a like a segue or something.

1139
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:54,740
Whatever he was doing.

1140
00:49:54,740 --> 00:49:58,420
I think you're saying a sidecar is a sidecar on a motorcycle.

1141
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:03,300
Was there a moment at like 1201 where you're like, it's probably not.

1142
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:05,740
Guys, probably.

1143
00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:07,020
Um, that's a good question.

1144
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:09,300
I'm trying to remember gingerly pets you on the back.

1145
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:12,340
It's OK. Next time there was a lot going on that night, too.

1146
00:50:12,780 --> 00:50:13,900
There were like some.

1147
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:16,500
Yeah, we ate at tender grains around the corner.

1148
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:20,260
That's true. We did.

1149
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:22,620
There were like but there were like some there were some like breakdowns

1150
00:50:22,620 --> 00:50:23,580
that happened that night.

1151
00:50:23,580 --> 00:50:24,580
I don't know if you remember.

1152
00:50:24,580 --> 00:50:26,820
I can't say that on the air, but there were some.

1153
00:50:27,420 --> 00:50:28,500
There was like some chaos.

1154
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:30,300
Monday won't mind.

1155
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:34,260
I was going to say I refused to invite him.

1156
00:50:35,820 --> 00:50:39,420
Yeah, there was no there was some like, like, oh, you know, so and so are doing

1157
00:50:39,420 --> 00:50:42,620
so like thing and I'm like, oh, like the 28 year old comedians

1158
00:50:42,620 --> 00:50:43,900
are always having breakdowns.

1159
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:45,140
Yeah. Well, I was 30.

1160
00:50:45,140 --> 00:50:47,660
Well, they would have been they probably would have been like

1161
00:50:48,020 --> 00:50:49,700
everybody is at their lowest point.

1162
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:52,860
It's just whatever they're feeling is just wrecking them.

1163
00:50:52,860 --> 00:50:54,100
And then all of a sudden,

1164
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:56,540
because we don't want it to be your weekend.

1165
00:50:56,860 --> 00:51:00,540
He'd blast in full band, brought his own amps.

1166
00:51:00,540 --> 00:51:02,700
Yeah, this is for you, Michael.

1167
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:05,020
I consider you my best friend immediately.

1168
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:07,140
He would have taken care of the no, no, no, no, no.

1169
00:51:07,140 --> 00:51:08,140
That was happening.

1170
00:51:09,180 --> 00:51:11,340
He would have he would have set everyone straight.

1171
00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:15,340
Oh, I was in the middle of a wedding for my wedding.

1172
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:17,980
Yeah, I guess you want to go about Taylor or Tyler.

1173
00:51:18,620 --> 00:51:19,620
No, no, I have one more.

1174
00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:21,180
I have one more declaration about a wedding.

1175
00:51:21,180 --> 00:51:24,100
Yeah, I said that, yeah, it has to go late because the magic

1176
00:51:24,380 --> 00:51:26,940
the playlist has to be good in a central location.

1177
00:51:26,940 --> 00:51:30,780
I've been to some very nice weddings that have so many rooms and places

1178
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:35,180
you can go, but the wedding is not fun because everyone spread out the whole time.

1179
00:51:35,540 --> 00:51:37,780
It needs to be in like a pretty central location.

1180
00:51:37,780 --> 00:51:39,100
Get everybody in that ballroom.

1181
00:51:39,100 --> 00:51:41,780
You have to force everyone together to have fun.

1182
00:51:41,780 --> 00:51:44,780
They don't have to dance, but there's an energy because that's some of the things

1183
00:51:44,780 --> 00:51:48,900
you're looking around like, like, you know, at my wedding, I was like,

1184
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:51,900
wow, this is I get to see my

1185
00:51:53,780 --> 00:51:57,460
it to see my slightly inebriated aunt meet Mike Hanford.

1186
00:51:58,260 --> 00:51:59,940
You got to see like worlds collide.

1187
00:51:59,940 --> 00:52:00,980
Yeah, that's the fun.

1188
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:03,780
It's fun to meet the Jetsons constantly.

1189
00:52:04,540 --> 00:52:08,100
Your friends from like high school, meeting your friends from now.

1190
00:52:08,140 --> 00:52:10,460
Yeah, yeah, yeah. The big jumble of your life.

1191
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:14,100
It's like it's your life flashing before your eyes without the part where you have to die.

1192
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:16,580
Yeah, it's exactly. Hopefully not.

1193
00:52:17,620 --> 00:52:20,900
But yeah, so like a Disney wedding where it's like we got to go in and out.

1194
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:22,620
It's like a surgical strike.

1195
00:52:22,620 --> 00:52:28,140
Yeah, 45 minutes here and then we're out of there and then now we're paying by the minute

1196
00:52:28,140 --> 00:52:30,660
or the second when you're in whatever the reception area.

1197
00:52:30,660 --> 00:52:34,860
It's like that just doesn't sound like the right recipe for.

1198
00:52:35,060 --> 00:52:39,420
Yeah, yeah. A fun, relaxing or loose, loose, loose ish wedding.

1199
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:40,500
I'm also a little caught on.

1200
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:43,580
I feel like I have to say how the you know, because I do think about it.

1201
00:52:43,580 --> 00:52:47,500
You guys weren't at my wedding and and and you also weren't at Nick Mundy's wedding.

1202
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:49,100
And that's right. He's he's probably said this to you.

1203
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:51,780
He's very like he said to me every week.

1204
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:52,860
So you know, I think about my wedding.

1205
00:52:52,860 --> 00:52:55,060
It's like Mike should have been there.

1206
00:52:55,060 --> 00:52:56,580
He said he just said it to me.

1207
00:52:56,580 --> 00:52:58,340
He said it to me a couple of days ago.

1208
00:52:58,340 --> 00:52:59,220
I know it's all right.

1209
00:52:59,220 --> 00:53:01,980
He's even asked me, oh, there's an open ended.

1210
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:04,940
He's like, think about like who who wasn't at your wedding.

1211
00:53:04,940 --> 00:53:06,340
You wish was there.

1212
00:53:06,340 --> 00:53:08,460
Now, see, for me, it's Mike.

1213
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:09,820
He's very sweet to constantly.

1214
00:53:09,820 --> 00:53:12,300
He brings it up constantly.

1215
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:13,020
He's really hung up.

1216
00:53:13,020 --> 00:53:14,140
It's very sweet, though.

1217
00:53:14,140 --> 00:53:17,060
He does that sweet head nod.

1218
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:18,700
Yeah, you know, you would have been there.

1219
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:19,340
You would have been there.

1220
00:53:19,340 --> 00:53:21,500
I could have really made special.

1221
00:53:22,660 --> 00:53:24,140
Well, he was mad I was there.

1222
00:53:24,140 --> 00:53:26,060
I was confused.

1223
00:53:26,060 --> 00:53:28,860
I put sugar in his gasoline tank,

1224
00:53:28,860 --> 00:53:31,500
but not in the tailpipe like the rascals, you know.

1225
00:53:31,540 --> 00:53:32,340
Well, you were trained.

1226
00:53:32,340 --> 00:53:34,620
Scott, why did you bring Jason Sheridan?

1227
00:53:34,620 --> 00:53:37,820
You'd only met at a party once at that point instead of your wife.

1228
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:38,340
Yeah.

1229
00:53:40,140 --> 00:53:43,380
Anyways, there is one

1230
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:49,420
that I that the first episode of this oddly calibrates you at like

1231
00:53:49,420 --> 00:53:51,580
that things are going to be a little kookier than they

1232
00:53:52,780 --> 00:53:54,700
may be being.

1233
00:53:54,700 --> 00:53:56,540
And I don't think I don't remember the names.

1234
00:53:56,540 --> 00:53:59,060
I apologize. And I believe this is the one where I was saying that

1235
00:53:59,380 --> 00:54:02,780
what they land at is like, well, what I really like is the castle.

1236
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:05,660
This might come up in several episodes that somebody's like,

1237
00:54:05,820 --> 00:54:08,060
when I think Disney, I think Castle.

1238
00:54:08,380 --> 00:54:12,300
I don't know. To me, the iconic locations got to be that castle.

1239
00:54:12,580 --> 00:54:15,500
That's the level of like normie that this thing.

1240
00:54:15,580 --> 00:54:17,620
I think you're talking about Chelsea and Spencer.

1241
00:54:17,860 --> 00:54:19,980
Might be. Yeah, I think so. Yeah, I have Chelsea written somewhere.

1242
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:23,540
OK, OK. So there's that the landing at the

1243
00:54:24,380 --> 00:54:26,540
the landing at the castle is funny and mundane.

1244
00:54:27,340 --> 00:54:29,660
But there is this part with her when they're talking about

1245
00:54:29,660 --> 00:54:33,180
what we could do with the cake and kind of the general theme

1246
00:54:33,180 --> 00:54:35,340
because they're fishing for like, is there a certain character

1247
00:54:35,340 --> 00:54:38,940
that you like? And the guy, the planner has already been tipped off.

1248
00:54:38,940 --> 00:54:41,020
And he's like very enthusiastic.

1249
00:54:41,180 --> 00:54:43,540
I understand that you really enjoy Tinkerbell.

1250
00:54:43,820 --> 00:54:48,820
And her response to that is like, yeah, well,

1251
00:54:48,820 --> 00:54:50,820
and it's already like, oh, where are we going with this?

1252
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:54,540
And she says, yeah, I think about as well.

1253
00:54:54,540 --> 00:54:58,620
Look, you know, I actually I actually call my mom right before college

1254
00:54:58,620 --> 00:55:03,740
graduation, crying, saying that I wanted to be Tinkerbell.

1255
00:55:03,740 --> 00:55:06,660
And I didn't want to grow up and actually be in the real world.

1256
00:55:06,860 --> 00:55:10,540
So and then that kind of sits there in the planners like,

1257
00:55:11,020 --> 00:55:13,100
oh, you didn't want to. OK.

1258
00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:15,420
Well, what we can do is have a projection cake and Tinkerbell's

1259
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:16,540
flying around the cake.

1260
00:55:16,540 --> 00:55:20,580
And he does not want to touch whatever weird pathologies going on.

1261
00:55:20,740 --> 00:55:24,540
We're like, OK, you like, yeah, I loved Tinkerbell when I was little.

1262
00:55:24,540 --> 00:55:27,860
There's that's one thing being that I am.

1263
00:55:28,460 --> 00:55:32,540
I am 21 or 22 about to graduate college.

1264
00:55:32,740 --> 00:55:35,620
And I want to be I don't want to do it.

1265
00:55:35,620 --> 00:55:38,060
I want to be Tinkerbell forever.

1266
00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:42,220
And also Tinkerbell is the choice for I don't want to grow up.

1267
00:55:42,220 --> 00:55:43,860
I want to be Tinkerbell.

1268
00:55:43,860 --> 00:55:46,180
Is it Tinkerbell's like 30? Right.

1269
00:55:46,420 --> 00:55:48,940
Tinkerbell is not a little girl.

1270
00:55:48,940 --> 00:55:50,140
Is she? Good question.

1271
00:55:50,140 --> 00:55:51,500
She's just little.

1272
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:55,300
But she's at least if you're going by hook, it's Julia.

1273
00:55:55,300 --> 00:55:56,900
It's a grown Julia Roberts.

1274
00:55:56,900 --> 00:55:59,660
If you're going by hook rules, I don't know that it's really defined

1275
00:55:59,660 --> 00:56:00,780
in the animated version.

1276
00:56:00,820 --> 00:56:03,740
But she doesn't look you look at the drawing of Tinkerbell.

1277
00:56:03,740 --> 00:56:06,300
That's not like a it's not a nine year old.

1278
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:10,460
But she is a but she is like a true jealous of Wendy

1279
00:56:11,100 --> 00:56:13,340
for Peter's affection and Peter's young.

1280
00:56:13,740 --> 00:56:17,860
Yes. So she would hope you would hope it's not licorice pizza situation.

1281
00:56:19,620 --> 00:56:22,100
You would hope that it's a modern day Peter Pan.

1282
00:56:22,140 --> 00:56:25,780
Yeah, you hope it's you would hope it's yeah, like more age appropriate.

1283
00:56:25,780 --> 00:56:26,660
So I don't know.

1284
00:56:26,660 --> 00:56:30,540
I guess I would. I read that her and Peter were like similar ages.

1285
00:56:31,140 --> 00:56:32,340
But maybe that's wrong.

1286
00:56:32,340 --> 00:56:36,100
Mm hmm. But this is hey, I'm not I'm never getting off.

1287
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:37,500
My pan is canceled point.

1288
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:39,300
This is the kind of thing it breeds.

1289
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:42,740
You get this movie in your brain and now you're about to graduate college.

1290
00:56:42,740 --> 00:56:45,820
You're going no, I don't want to.

1291
00:56:46,140 --> 00:56:50,860
I want to be Tinkerbell, which is like look, if you don't

1292
00:56:50,860 --> 00:56:53,620
if you want to be like Tinkerbell and not grow up, I'm sorry, lady.

1293
00:56:53,620 --> 00:56:55,860
You are already more than two inches tall.

1294
00:56:56,980 --> 00:56:58,460
The ship has already sailed.

1295
00:56:58,460 --> 00:57:01,140
Yeah. Yeah. This moment was a little much for me.

1296
00:57:01,140 --> 00:57:04,020
I was glad most of the other episodes didn't have stuff like this.

1297
00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:09,060
It's a little that's when you get some of it because we see this Disney

1298
00:57:09,060 --> 00:57:11,420
adulting thing around all the time.

1299
00:57:11,420 --> 00:57:15,460
And that's kind of the zone that I think is a little like, OK, let's.

1300
00:57:15,540 --> 00:57:19,980
Yeah, it's not so much like I don't want to adulting.

1301
00:57:19,980 --> 00:57:23,380
I like I'm like this is a fun place to run around and go on a ride

1302
00:57:23,380 --> 00:57:27,100
and get a break from my life, not like just let me be little.

1303
00:57:27,100 --> 00:57:30,340
Let me hide in Simba's cave forever.

1304
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:34,980
Well, that's also on the story editor and producer and director to not call like,

1305
00:57:35,420 --> 00:57:36,740
all right, cut.

1306
00:57:36,740 --> 00:57:38,340
Can we massage that a little?

1307
00:57:38,340 --> 00:57:39,820
Can we go?

1308
00:57:39,820 --> 00:57:41,180
Oh, I don't want that.

1309
00:57:41,180 --> 00:57:44,060
I love that. Finally, there was something like you want.

1310
00:57:44,060 --> 00:57:46,180
No, no. You want somebody cookie in the shoe.

1311
00:57:46,220 --> 00:57:48,540
Somebody to be like, talk more about that, please.

1312
00:57:48,540 --> 00:57:50,220
Keep going. Yeah.

1313
00:57:50,220 --> 00:57:53,980
I'm saying it's in the show because they're like, OK, this will probably be.

1314
00:57:53,980 --> 00:57:56,220
Yeah. She told us a thing about Tinkerbell in college.

1315
00:57:56,220 --> 00:57:58,420
And they're like, OK, well, we can't do that again.

1316
00:57:58,420 --> 00:58:00,260
Like, all right.

1317
00:58:00,260 --> 00:58:02,060
I guess we'll use that take.

1318
00:58:02,060 --> 00:58:03,660
I want to keep going. I want it like.

1319
00:58:03,660 --> 00:58:06,300
And then it's but then I did go to graduation.

1320
00:58:06,300 --> 00:58:08,740
But I bought a costume the night before.

1321
00:58:08,740 --> 00:58:13,180
And when I got the diploma, I ripped off my robe and I was Tinkerbell underneath.

1322
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:15,380
And I yelled, I'm not growing up.

1323
00:58:15,380 --> 00:58:18,980
And I tore up the diploma and I ziplined out of there.

1324
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:25,180
My memory of like everyone around and graduating college is, yeah,

1325
00:58:25,180 --> 00:58:27,460
everyone did kind of go a little feral.

1326
00:58:28,060 --> 00:58:30,780
So but I don't know that you need to.

1327
00:58:30,780 --> 00:58:34,060
Hang on. People started dating like rather two weeks school left.

1328
00:58:34,060 --> 00:58:36,580
People started getting together and everyone's getting hammered.

1329
00:58:36,580 --> 00:58:39,460
And it's just like everyone's getting hammered.

1330
00:58:39,460 --> 00:58:42,140
Everyone's getting like, I say, you got out of there.

1331
00:58:42,140 --> 00:58:45,860
Jason's like extra like we got to clean out this rental apartment.

1332
00:58:45,860 --> 00:58:47,300
We got to clean out the bottles.

1333
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:49,500
When you say that, let me ask you, you don't have to say names.

1334
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:53,060
When you say people were like hooking up or something two weeks before,

1335
00:58:53,060 --> 00:58:54,380
do you have two names in your mind?

1336
00:58:54,380 --> 00:58:56,220
And you went, whoa, those those people are together.

1337
00:58:56,220 --> 00:58:57,940
I have a handful. Oh, a handful.

1338
00:58:57,940 --> 00:58:59,980
I have a handful. Chelsea and Spencer.

1339
00:58:59,980 --> 00:59:01,660
Tell me it's Spencer Taylor and Tyler.

1340
00:59:01,660 --> 00:59:03,620
Was it Taylor and Tyler?

1341
00:59:03,620 --> 00:59:05,540
Chelsea, Spencer, Dominique and Joe.

1342
00:59:08,660 --> 00:59:12,460
Hey, Jason, I just want to let you know that Dominique and I hooking up now.

1343
00:59:12,460 --> 00:59:15,060
It's two weeks to go until graduation, but we're going to do it.

1344
00:59:15,220 --> 00:59:17,020
Dominique, this is just like you.

1345
00:59:17,020 --> 00:59:19,140
Spencer. What was the other guy's name?

1346
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:22,340
No, Dominique and Joe. I'm Joe. I'm Joe.

1347
00:59:22,340 --> 00:59:23,980
I'm not Dominique.

1348
00:59:23,980 --> 00:59:25,620
You two are both Dominique.

1349
00:59:25,620 --> 00:59:27,940
I'm nuts. You two are both nuts.

1350
00:59:27,940 --> 00:59:30,860
So we got two weeks to go, but we're going to start hooking up.

1351
00:59:30,860 --> 00:59:32,540
I'm so sorry.

1352
00:59:32,540 --> 00:59:35,180
We're going crazy here because we're going feral.

1353
00:59:35,180 --> 00:59:36,340
We're going feral.

1354
00:59:36,340 --> 00:59:38,540
Do you think we used to say about Jason, honestly, on Harold

1355
00:59:38,820 --> 00:59:41,020
when we were in a hero? Mike used to say that.

1356
00:59:41,020 --> 00:59:44,180
Yeah, we would say Jason going feral because he would get like really riled up.

1357
00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:45,460
I get really punchy.

1358
00:59:45,460 --> 00:59:47,340
And Wolverine was a Wolverine.

1359
00:59:47,340 --> 00:59:49,300
Now, this doesn't sound familiar to me.

1360
00:59:49,300 --> 00:59:52,180
Yeah, he hasn't been feral in many years.

1361
00:59:52,180 --> 00:59:54,340
I've been working on it actively.

1362
00:59:54,340 --> 00:59:55,660
More feral or no, to be less feral?

1363
00:59:55,660 --> 00:59:58,500
No, I've been in therapy for years to not go feral so often.

1364
00:59:58,500 --> 01:00:00,940
To be less feral, yeah.

1365
01:00:00,940 --> 01:00:05,100
You went to therapy and expressed your feelings about wanting to be Tiger Bell.

1366
01:00:05,300 --> 01:00:08,780
There was a weird period of X-Men.

1367
01:00:08,780 --> 01:00:12,660
Well, Wolverine, they called it when Wolverine was feral,

1368
01:00:12,660 --> 01:00:14,860
where he like lost his nose, essentially.

1369
01:00:14,860 --> 01:00:18,340
They didn't draw a nose on him anymore, and he wore like a big thing over his head.

1370
01:00:19,220 --> 01:00:22,260
We also got the adamantium ripped out of him for a little while.

1371
01:00:22,260 --> 01:00:23,620
That happened as well.

1372
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:25,220
He became more savage, too.

1373
01:00:25,220 --> 01:00:27,420
That's true. He became more feral and savage.

1374
01:00:27,420 --> 01:00:30,180
I would have loved a guy like a groom

1375
01:00:30,180 --> 01:00:33,740
monologuing about like the adamantium being ripped out of Wolverine.

1376
01:00:33,740 --> 01:00:35,500
And that's, you know.

1377
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:36,820
Yes, absolutely.

1378
01:00:36,820 --> 01:00:37,940
You're like, why isn't there even?

1379
01:00:37,940 --> 01:00:40,940
Well, they I guess they know they could have done a Marvel thing at this point.

1380
01:00:40,940 --> 01:00:42,860
Sure. There are some crazy deep.

1381
01:00:42,860 --> 01:00:46,140
More. See, I really did think the show is going to be like nerd.

1382
01:00:46,180 --> 01:00:48,420
Yeah, yeah. Nerds nerding out.

1383
01:00:48,420 --> 01:00:49,620
Right. And I don't understand.

1384
01:00:49,620 --> 01:00:52,420
Maybe that doesn't have appeal for free form.

1385
01:00:52,460 --> 01:00:54,020
Yeah, it's not nerds.

1386
01:00:54,020 --> 01:00:56,700
It's not like insanely rich people.

1387
01:00:57,020 --> 01:01:01,220
I'll say there was there was like an odd like, oh, that's a weird Disney connection

1388
01:01:01,220 --> 01:01:06,020
where that woman Taylor, her father was on the food and beverage

1389
01:01:06,020 --> 01:01:10,060
team in Florida, who brought the turkey leg to Florida to the parks.

1390
01:01:10,580 --> 01:01:15,700
And then her sister voices Soka Tano in the Clone Wars cartoon.

1391
01:01:16,100 --> 01:01:18,020
The Jedi. Oh, wow.

1392
01:01:18,020 --> 01:01:19,940
I apologize if I butchered that character.

1393
01:01:19,940 --> 01:01:21,980
Soka Soka Tano.

1394
01:01:21,980 --> 01:01:23,380
Is that right? Yeah.

1395
01:01:23,380 --> 01:01:26,020
That Rosario Dawson played her in the live action. Yeah.

1396
01:01:26,900 --> 01:01:28,620
She's getting her own show, I think she is.

1397
01:01:28,620 --> 01:01:31,740
Yeah. What else occurred in this?

1398
01:01:32,700 --> 01:01:34,780
I just I'm just going to say random things.

1399
01:01:34,780 --> 01:01:38,220
I like the people who are getting married at the Coronado Hotel

1400
01:01:38,220 --> 01:01:40,540
and they have that they have to say the branding and like, you know,

1401
01:01:40,660 --> 01:01:43,820
arriving there, looking out over Grand Destino Plaza.

1402
01:01:44,820 --> 01:01:46,100
Anything like that.

1403
01:01:46,100 --> 01:01:48,900
Um, that Pandora thing also,

1404
01:01:48,900 --> 01:01:51,180
that the constant saying of Pandora, the world of Avatar,

1405
01:01:51,300 --> 01:01:56,380
I like that the efficient has to say it like who has the coolest voice

1406
01:01:56,380 --> 01:01:58,300
I've ever heard, the deepest voice.

1407
01:01:58,300 --> 01:02:00,780
He sounds amazing, but then he has to like

1408
01:02:01,260 --> 01:02:04,780
and that they're making Disney history here by getting married in Pandora,

1409
01:02:04,780 --> 01:02:06,700
the world of Avatar.

1410
01:02:06,700 --> 01:02:09,740
But even I, I like the efficient a lot there.

1411
01:02:09,740 --> 01:02:12,820
And he kind of made it offhand a joke about like the groom

1412
01:02:12,820 --> 01:02:16,060
loves the Lion King and I sound a little like a character in that.

1413
01:02:16,060 --> 01:02:18,100
But I don't know why they didn't just tell him like, hey, man,

1414
01:02:18,100 --> 01:02:20,140
just say you sound like Mufasa.

1415
01:02:20,140 --> 01:02:21,580
Yeah. Why didn't he say that?

1416
01:02:21,580 --> 01:02:23,700
That was strange. Yes.

1417
01:02:23,700 --> 01:02:26,300
But he was I liked him. He was a character.

1418
01:02:26,420 --> 01:02:27,540
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1419
01:02:27,540 --> 01:02:30,340
There's a there's interesting people.

1420
01:02:30,340 --> 01:02:32,740
There's cool people throughout.

1421
01:02:32,740 --> 01:02:34,780
Here's another. OK, let me throw out also this.

1422
01:02:34,780 --> 01:02:37,420
If you're doing a castle one, I understand that.

1423
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:41,540
And I understand like I want to I'm the bride and I want to look like a princess.

1424
01:02:41,780 --> 01:02:46,820
But I always find it funny that and I get the coach to like the glass coach

1425
01:02:46,820 --> 01:02:50,260
that Disney has recreated that in reality very well.

1426
01:02:50,420 --> 01:02:53,300
But I always find it funny then when there's the coachman,

1427
01:02:53,460 --> 01:02:57,380
when there's like the powdered wig ponytails like little

1428
01:02:57,540 --> 01:03:01,540
and then like the little suit tails go up, these little these fancy

1429
01:03:01,660 --> 01:03:03,260
these cabin boys.

1430
01:03:03,260 --> 01:03:07,060
I find it weird that that's actively part of anyone's fantasy.

1431
01:03:07,060 --> 01:03:10,180
I just when I was a little girl, I loved the coachman

1432
01:03:10,340 --> 01:03:14,820
and I just dreamed of having four coachmen with their white ponytails.

1433
01:03:16,380 --> 01:03:18,420
Take me off of that.

1434
01:03:18,420 --> 01:03:21,340
I know that feels like a weird like coachman, please.

1435
01:03:21,820 --> 01:03:24,940
I would like it if, you know, one party

1436
01:03:25,780 --> 01:03:27,900
and said we want a real fairy tale wedding.

1437
01:03:28,300 --> 01:03:30,020
We'd like some Disney characters there.

1438
01:03:30,020 --> 01:03:33,060
But also we'd like some of the real Grimm's fairy tale.

1439
01:03:33,060 --> 01:03:34,500
Like we want some brutality.

1440
01:03:34,500 --> 01:03:36,860
We want some darkness.

1441
01:03:36,860 --> 01:03:38,860
Or royalty. It's like we want some royalty.

1442
01:03:38,860 --> 01:03:41,180
We want some royalty and stuff.

1443
01:03:41,180 --> 01:03:44,780
But, you know, we want the we want some gossip hounds there.

1444
01:03:44,820 --> 01:03:46,460
Like hounding the royalty.

1445
01:03:46,460 --> 01:03:50,220
We want like the real royalty experience where it's like, oh, it's miserable.

1446
01:03:50,260 --> 01:03:53,540
Like you want like Piers, Markle, and leave Morgan there.

1447
01:03:53,740 --> 01:03:58,020
Yeah, like we're asking for a Piers Morgan is like bothering Prince Charming.

1448
01:03:58,020 --> 01:04:00,900
Like I would have wanted like a mashup.

1449
01:04:00,900 --> 01:04:02,780
I've been like, all right, Grand Floridian.

1450
01:04:02,780 --> 01:04:06,220
But the coach boys are not coach boys are like for Navi.

1451
01:04:06,780 --> 01:04:10,100
And there's like we don't talk about like they're the Navi are like driving the.

1452
01:04:10,100 --> 01:04:12,140
You want them not in Pandora's.

1453
01:04:12,140 --> 01:04:13,940
Not exactly.

1454
01:04:13,940 --> 01:04:16,900
They're at Grand Floridian, but they're like just like

1455
01:04:16,900 --> 01:04:20,260
driving the carriage essentially is just a Navi, a couple Navi.

1456
01:04:20,500 --> 01:04:22,340
Yes. And they're completely out of place.

1457
01:04:22,340 --> 01:04:23,860
But like, it's interesting.

1458
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:25,540
Yeah, fun. Absolutely.

1459
01:04:25,540 --> 01:04:30,780
I think at the Pandora one, they should have had each like next to them.

1460
01:04:31,300 --> 01:04:34,700
Dantrel and Patrice should have have nine foot Navi.

1461
01:04:35,260 --> 01:04:38,660
Mimicking the movement, like also getting married completely.

1462
01:04:38,700 --> 01:04:40,060
I thought there was going to be something.

1463
01:04:40,060 --> 01:04:42,140
Yeah. And I and when I heard about it,

1464
01:04:42,260 --> 01:04:44,740
I think they just wanted to get married in like a pretty place.

1465
01:04:44,740 --> 01:04:47,660
I thought these are going to be like super avatars.

1466
01:04:47,660 --> 01:04:52,300
Nerds are like the people if you saw how to with John Wilson, they go.

1467
01:04:52,580 --> 01:04:55,620
He goes and talks to the people who are sad because avatar isn't real.

1468
01:04:56,100 --> 01:05:00,780
I want to see those people get married and just and they're melting down.

1469
01:05:00,780 --> 01:05:02,500
They can't handle their display.

1470
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:04,300
They just start like seizureing.

1471
01:05:04,300 --> 01:05:07,220
They're so excited to be married in Pandora.

1472
01:05:07,300 --> 01:05:11,820
They let him in that room with a big avatar in the tank, the big Navi in the tank.

1473
01:05:11,820 --> 01:05:15,220
And they're just like, yeah, holding on, like weeping, like hold

1474
01:05:15,220 --> 01:05:16,980
like their face against the glass.

1475
01:05:16,980 --> 01:05:21,020
That's the efficient they ordain that inanimate Navi.

1476
01:05:21,060 --> 01:05:22,740
Oh, yeah. Floating in a tank.

1477
01:05:22,740 --> 01:05:28,060
And they have to lean in and go, he says, do you take this woman?

1478
01:05:29,540 --> 01:05:31,900
And then they and then like they do the braid.

1479
01:05:32,180 --> 01:05:34,500
They. Oh, yeah. They have a braid.

1480
01:05:34,700 --> 01:05:40,540
Yes. They should also do a thing where they they knock the bride and groom out

1481
01:05:41,420 --> 01:05:45,100
and they act like as if they're trans like they're transitioning

1482
01:05:45,100 --> 01:05:47,100
to being an avatar, essentially.

1483
01:05:47,100 --> 01:05:50,340
Oh, yeah. You know how like, yeah, like he goes to sleep basically and wakes up.

1484
01:05:50,340 --> 01:05:53,820
So like if they knock them out, then they will become a Navi.

1485
01:05:53,820 --> 01:05:58,460
So then they wake up and they've had like full paint and full like prosthetics put on.

1486
01:05:58,460 --> 01:06:00,900
And they've turned in now to Navi.

1487
01:06:00,900 --> 01:06:05,140
Oh, you know, you can do is the night before, like everybody's arrived

1488
01:06:05,140 --> 01:06:06,580
and they're going to gather at the hotels.

1489
01:06:06,580 --> 01:06:08,020
But then you start getting

1490
01:06:08,020 --> 01:06:10,060
calls, start going out to the individual rooms.

1491
01:06:10,060 --> 01:06:12,300
You're like, what? What happened?

1492
01:06:12,300 --> 01:06:15,180
Both the bride and the groom

1493
01:06:15,180 --> 01:06:17,860
fell and lost the use of their legs.

1494
01:06:18,180 --> 01:06:20,420
They're both. They'll both never walk again.

1495
01:06:20,740 --> 01:06:21,900
This is terrible.

1496
01:06:21,900 --> 01:06:24,020
Well, this wedding must be off, right?

1497
01:06:24,100 --> 01:06:25,380
No, no, no. Still go.

1498
01:06:25,380 --> 01:06:26,700
They're still going to try to do it.

1499
01:06:26,700 --> 01:06:29,620
We'll see. And then when the Navi walk in,

1500
01:06:30,500 --> 01:06:35,100
kind of crawling in like after Jake Sully first gets in the avatar for the first time.

1501
01:06:35,100 --> 01:06:40,060
Well, yeah, like you would want like a hardcore avatar nerd

1502
01:06:40,140 --> 01:06:41,980
to want something like that.

1503
01:06:41,980 --> 01:06:43,420
Yes. So you want to see that?

1504
01:06:43,420 --> 01:06:44,100
I want to see that.

1505
01:06:44,100 --> 01:06:47,620
I would watch a full reality show that is my Pandora wedding.

1506
01:06:47,860 --> 01:06:50,220
If it was all people, really, that idea.

1507
01:06:50,220 --> 01:06:53,460
Yeah. And they're finding different aspects of the world.

1508
01:06:53,460 --> 01:06:55,300
Maybe there's people who really like the villain.

1509
01:06:55,300 --> 01:06:57,140
They really like Stephen Lang.

1510
01:06:57,140 --> 01:07:00,860
Seeing a bride and groom have to kiss

1511
01:07:01,180 --> 01:07:05,180
in the like the mech suits, like stomping towards each other

1512
01:07:05,180 --> 01:07:10,340
and then really delicately hang the hand, the little ring with the big clunky arms.

1513
01:07:10,700 --> 01:07:12,620
Oh, that's a great idea.

1514
01:07:12,620 --> 01:07:14,540
They can't quite get close enough to kiss.

1515
01:07:14,540 --> 01:07:15,940
They keep leaning in.

1516
01:07:15,940 --> 01:07:16,740
Hmm.

1517
01:07:16,740 --> 01:07:17,700
Hmm.

1518
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:19,060
Honk.

1519
01:07:19,060 --> 01:07:22,220
Sparks when they technically technically is a kiss,

1520
01:07:22,220 --> 01:07:25,900
if the two metals clang against each other and sparks fly.

1521
01:07:26,100 --> 01:07:28,100
That's a mech kiss.

1522
01:07:28,100 --> 01:07:30,460
They call it Navi in the tank says it counts.

1523
01:07:32,100 --> 01:07:35,220
There's an infinite amount of possibilities for Pandora,

1524
01:07:35,220 --> 01:07:37,340
the world of avatars, for weddings are concerned.

1525
01:07:37,700 --> 01:07:38,420
Yeah.

1526
01:07:38,420 --> 01:07:41,660
Uh, OK, so the one couple.

1527
01:07:42,060 --> 01:07:45,100
This is a weird thing that I just picked up on one.

1528
01:07:45,300 --> 01:07:48,660
She the bride was staying at the beach club

1529
01:07:49,180 --> 01:07:52,300
or the yacht club and got fully ready there.

1530
01:07:52,380 --> 01:07:54,500
This might be Taylor and Tyler again.

1531
01:07:54,500 --> 01:07:57,060
I don't know why this this fair is glued in my mind.

1532
01:07:57,620 --> 01:08:00,620
She got fully they all got fully ready.

1533
01:08:01,620 --> 01:08:03,260
Like hair, makeup, everything.

1534
01:08:03,260 --> 01:08:04,780
And it's like, OK, let's go.

1535
01:08:04,780 --> 01:08:06,580
And they're walking down the hall of the hotel.

1536
01:08:06,580 --> 01:08:08,020
And I'm like, hold on a minute.

1537
01:08:08,020 --> 01:08:12,860
The American adventure from the club, that is a one mile walk or so.

1538
01:08:12,860 --> 01:08:14,900
At least the most Jason.

1539
01:08:15,580 --> 01:08:16,020
Yeah.

1540
01:08:16,020 --> 01:08:18,500
Did you all get steps and amounts?

1541
01:08:18,500 --> 01:08:21,500
But I'm assuming they put them in golf carts or pass fans.

1542
01:08:21,620 --> 01:08:24,700
It's like, did you get 100 percent ready and then climb a pass fan?

1543
01:08:24,700 --> 01:08:26,740
Like, give them a room at the venue.

1544
01:08:27,180 --> 01:08:29,540
The other thing I noticed.

1545
01:08:29,540 --> 01:08:30,860
You want a steps counter.

1546
01:08:30,860 --> 01:08:31,980
You do not have money counter.

1547
01:08:31,980 --> 01:08:33,300
You want steps.

1548
01:08:33,300 --> 01:08:34,820
I just thought it was weird.

1549
01:08:34,820 --> 01:08:37,220
Like show backstage at the venue.

1550
01:08:37,340 --> 01:08:40,140
The other thing I noticed, she was getting ready at the club.

1551
01:08:40,220 --> 01:08:42,460
He was in a hotel room getting ready,

1552
01:08:42,620 --> 01:08:46,660
but it had one of the big windows by the doors, like at the All Stars

1553
01:08:46,900 --> 01:08:48,860
or like Port Orleans and stuff.

1554
01:08:48,860 --> 01:08:50,020
I'm like, wait a minute.

1555
01:08:50,060 --> 01:08:52,940
If Disney's paying, why didn't you put one of them up at the yacht club

1556
01:08:52,940 --> 01:08:54,060
and one at the beach club?

1557
01:08:54,060 --> 01:08:56,140
Where where is he getting ready?

1558
01:08:57,260 --> 01:08:59,100
Wait, do you think it's a different I'm confused.

1559
01:08:59,100 --> 01:09:01,780
I'm saying I think they were at different hotels.

1560
01:09:02,180 --> 01:09:04,580
Oh, and I think he was at a worse hotel.

1561
01:09:05,060 --> 01:09:06,260
Which one do you think it was?

1562
01:09:06,260 --> 01:09:09,420
I'm saying I think he was at either like a moderate or a value hotel.

1563
01:09:09,420 --> 01:09:11,460
And she was at the yacht club.

1564
01:09:11,460 --> 01:09:15,140
And you know what they say before a wedding, the bride and groom can't say

1565
01:09:15,140 --> 01:09:18,220
each other, you know, they can't stay at the same level of

1566
01:09:18,220 --> 01:09:20,060
quality hotel value.

1567
01:09:20,060 --> 01:09:23,260
Yeah, cheat that a few times because they're like on the balconies,

1568
01:09:23,260 --> 01:09:26,300
not looking at each other, exchanging letters and poems.

1569
01:09:26,300 --> 01:09:27,580
A lot of letters and poems.

1570
01:09:27,580 --> 01:09:28,660
There were a lot of letters. Yeah.

1571
01:09:28,660 --> 01:09:29,580
Pre letter. Yeah.

1572
01:09:29,580 --> 01:09:30,740
Do any letter poems?

1573
01:09:30,740 --> 01:09:32,900
I was going to say, is that a common thing? Yeah.

1574
01:09:32,900 --> 01:09:34,420
I don't know. Hmm.

1575
01:09:34,420 --> 01:09:35,540
Well, I screwed up.

1576
01:09:35,540 --> 01:09:38,260
Well, when you when you do your renew your vows.

1577
01:09:38,260 --> 01:09:40,620
When I redo it, they bring the show back.

1578
01:09:40,620 --> 01:09:42,620
Yeah. We'll we'll make it right.

1579
01:09:42,620 --> 01:09:47,260
And you do it at like in like the gift shop of the Swan Hotel.

1580
01:09:47,660 --> 01:09:50,060
Yeah, that is probably where you would want it.

1581
01:09:50,300 --> 01:09:51,620
In the Michael Graves Cosmere.

1582
01:09:51,620 --> 01:09:52,460
Michael Graves.

1583
01:09:52,460 --> 01:09:55,060
And let's all have a moment of silence for someone who couldn't be here.

1584
01:09:55,060 --> 01:09:57,060
Architect Michael Graves.

1585
01:09:57,060 --> 01:10:01,500
And then a hologram of Michael Graves appears and does this ceremony.

1586
01:10:04,100 --> 01:10:08,420
Your love be as beautiful as my many buildings and as functional as well.

1587
01:10:08,860 --> 01:10:10,500
With as many amenities.

1588
01:10:10,500 --> 01:10:12,820
And then Leonardo Columbus ziplines in.

1589
01:10:13,860 --> 01:10:16,180
Hey, I think I should get a little of my money back.

1590
01:10:16,180 --> 01:10:17,380
I noticed the hologram.

1591
01:10:17,380 --> 01:10:21,420
I could kind of see the mirror and we're paying a lot of money for this experience.

1592
01:10:21,420 --> 01:10:22,820
And this is your best hologram.

1593
01:10:22,820 --> 01:10:24,380
I can see the reflect. Come on.

1594
01:10:24,380 --> 01:10:26,820
Your game, Disney. Come on.

1595
01:10:26,820 --> 01:10:27,700
What else do we do?

1596
01:10:27,700 --> 01:10:28,900
Name check for a wrap it up.

1597
01:10:28,900 --> 01:10:30,780
The the oh, you know what?

1598
01:10:30,780 --> 01:10:33,380
There's one that involves a flash mob.

1599
01:10:33,460 --> 01:10:35,180
And oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1600
01:10:35,180 --> 01:10:37,540
I just hadn't thought about flash mobs in a while.

1601
01:10:37,700 --> 01:10:41,980
Yeah. And I feel like maybe a net good of the pandemic is that

1602
01:10:41,980 --> 01:10:43,860
maybe it killed the flash mob.

1603
01:10:43,860 --> 01:10:45,540
Maybe flash mobs are done.

1604
01:10:45,540 --> 01:10:48,900
And if that's what it took, if it took a two year or deal.

1605
01:10:48,900 --> 01:10:50,700
Oh, I don't know.

1606
01:10:50,700 --> 01:10:53,980
You know, if you want to look at the silver lining of the worldwide pandemic

1607
01:10:53,980 --> 01:10:56,700
and perhaps the loss of flash mobs.

1608
01:10:57,100 --> 01:10:58,100
Yeah, I think so.

1609
01:10:58,100 --> 01:10:59,940
I think maybe it's worth it just just for that.

1610
01:10:59,940 --> 01:11:02,180
Hmm. Did you guys see the one with the flash mob?

1611
01:11:02,180 --> 01:11:04,020
I think it was.

1612
01:11:04,020 --> 01:11:05,420
Were they singing? They all singing?

1613
01:11:05,420 --> 01:11:09,220
Is that they're singing like a let's like what's what's the like

1614
01:11:09,420 --> 01:11:12,060
tinniest version of you make my dreams come true?

1615
01:11:12,060 --> 01:11:14,340
We can knock out. Oh, yeah, I did see that.

1616
01:11:14,340 --> 01:11:18,140
Where there's like a bunch of it's a we're going to get the bride

1617
01:11:18,140 --> 01:11:20,460
and she will be taking a photo in front of the castle.

1618
01:11:20,460 --> 01:11:23,660
And then there's a line of people also waiting to take a photo.

1619
01:11:23,820 --> 01:11:27,060
And the people are all doing the most business you've ever seen.

1620
01:11:27,060 --> 01:11:27,700
Right, right, right.

1621
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:30,460
All wearing the most extras in a play clothes.

1622
01:11:30,660 --> 01:11:33,020
You all pantomime like, hey, yeah, picture.

1623
01:11:33,020 --> 01:11:34,060
Cool, huh?

1624
01:11:34,060 --> 01:11:36,580
Making like lens gestures.

1625
01:11:36,740 --> 01:11:38,620
That's going to be you and me soon taking a picture.

1626
01:11:38,620 --> 01:11:39,860
OK, well, just wait a second.

1627
01:11:39,860 --> 01:11:41,980
There's not going to be any flash mob coming.

1628
01:11:41,980 --> 01:11:43,460
And then it. Oh, my God.

1629
01:11:43,460 --> 01:11:45,940
Just the whole I guess I'm not a flash mob.

1630
01:11:46,540 --> 01:11:50,780
I got caught. OK, I'll have to look this up and confirm it.

1631
01:11:50,780 --> 01:11:55,460
I'm sure some listeners had seen it, maybe even done it at Universal Florida

1632
01:11:55,460 --> 01:11:58,220
by Mills and like the makeup show that area.

1633
01:11:58,580 --> 01:11:59,900
I was walking along there.

1634
01:11:59,900 --> 01:12:02,940
This was probably when I went like 2017 or so.

1635
01:12:03,300 --> 01:12:06,660
Maybe a year, I think it'd be like 2017 and

1636
01:12:07,900 --> 01:12:10,180
flash mob started happening around me.

1637
01:12:10,740 --> 01:12:13,460
I believe they were dancing to Happy

1638
01:12:14,100 --> 01:12:17,940
that it's not a song, but it's similarly like you said.

1639
01:12:17,980 --> 01:12:20,980
Yeah, everyone the most straight out of central casting,

1640
01:12:20,980 --> 01:12:24,740
wearing what could only be described as, you know, regular clothes,

1641
01:12:24,780 --> 01:12:28,340
like the most ironed regular clothes you've ever seen.

1642
01:12:28,620 --> 01:12:32,220
Sure, a slightly turned lavender baseball cap.

1643
01:12:32,540 --> 01:12:33,780
Yeah. Pretty good.

1644
01:12:33,780 --> 01:12:35,500
Doesn't have a logo on it.

1645
01:12:35,500 --> 01:12:37,540
Logo free. Yeah.

1646
01:12:37,900 --> 01:12:40,020
So nothing gets in trouble.

1647
01:12:40,780 --> 01:12:42,700
Yeah, it's always like that.

1648
01:12:42,700 --> 01:12:46,100
Do you get scared for a second that the flash mob was happening to you?

1649
01:12:46,140 --> 01:12:49,100
I had a single second of like, what the fuck is happening?

1650
01:12:49,100 --> 01:12:51,900
And then when I realized the song and where I was, I was like,

1651
01:12:51,900 --> 01:12:53,540
oh, I think I know what's happening.

1652
01:12:53,540 --> 01:12:56,740
I think this is suddenly I realized it was me.

1653
01:12:56,740 --> 01:12:59,180
This the flash mob is for you.

1654
01:12:59,460 --> 01:13:02,940
Please don't ever know one create.

1655
01:13:02,980 --> 01:13:05,180
I'm setting up something awful here now.

1656
01:13:05,180 --> 01:13:07,580
But you're Michael Douglas in the game.

1657
01:13:08,580 --> 01:13:10,420
Yeah, everything's happening around.

1658
01:13:10,420 --> 01:13:12,660
I do you. And game sounds good.

1659
01:13:12,660 --> 01:13:13,980
A pan flash mob.

1660
01:13:13,980 --> 01:13:15,100
Oh, my God.

1661
01:13:15,100 --> 01:13:18,020
Everyone takes off their regular clothes and are all where.

1662
01:13:18,020 --> 01:13:19,900
Oh, boy.

1663
01:13:19,900 --> 01:13:21,740
Oh, come on, everybody.

1664
01:13:21,740 --> 01:13:24,020
Here we go.

1665
01:13:24,020 --> 01:13:27,500
If I was anywhere near a body of water and dive straight into it.

1666
01:13:27,780 --> 01:13:29,180
Swim for safety.

1667
01:13:29,180 --> 01:13:33,620
Do do do do do do do do do do do.

1668
01:13:33,620 --> 01:13:35,820
We don't want to grow up.

1669
01:13:35,820 --> 01:13:37,180
Neither does Scott.

1670
01:13:37,180 --> 01:13:38,460
Yes, I do.

1671
01:13:38,460 --> 01:13:40,660
I did grow up. I'm happy I did.

1672
01:13:41,860 --> 01:13:43,620
Think of a woman.

1673
01:13:43,620 --> 01:13:45,900
I'm trying to do the beat while it's going on.

1674
01:13:48,220 --> 01:13:49,700
No, no, no, no, no.

1675
01:13:49,700 --> 01:13:51,100
Do you know this?

1676
01:13:53,300 --> 01:13:55,460
Well, no, stop it.

1677
01:13:55,460 --> 01:13:57,700
This is this is already too much of a flash mob.

1678
01:13:58,580 --> 01:14:00,340
Oh, then it goes to like half speed.

1679
01:14:00,340 --> 01:14:01,980
You can fly.

1680
01:14:01,980 --> 01:14:02,700
You can fly.

1681
01:14:02,700 --> 01:14:05,980
They start trying to hook me up and grabbing me and making me hook up to wire.

1682
01:14:06,300 --> 01:14:07,860
Get your hands off me.

1683
01:14:07,860 --> 01:14:09,100
No, I cannot fly.

1684
01:14:09,100 --> 01:14:10,500
Do not make me fly.

1685
01:14:10,500 --> 01:14:12,220
You can fly.

1686
01:14:12,220 --> 01:14:13,260
You can fly.

1687
01:14:13,260 --> 01:14:15,820
Let's make Scott's dreams come true.

1688
01:14:15,820 --> 01:14:16,820
Stop it.

1689
01:14:17,940 --> 01:14:19,740
It's not what that song sounds like.

1690
01:14:19,740 --> 01:14:21,500
It's not about flying.

1691
01:14:22,580 --> 01:14:26,260
Not this show, but on the season two of Righteous Gemstones,

1692
01:14:26,260 --> 01:14:30,300
great Disney wedding joke, running gag throughout the season.

1693
01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:31,100
Oh, really?

1694
01:14:31,100 --> 01:14:32,900
Wedding occurring.

1695
01:14:32,900 --> 01:14:35,340
I don't want to spoil it, but yeah,

1696
01:14:35,380 --> 01:14:36,620
it's it's pretty good.

1697
01:14:36,620 --> 01:14:38,540
By the way, here, wait, really, I forgot this.

1698
01:14:38,540 --> 01:14:42,860
So there's there's one episode I said that isn't there's a holiday one

1699
01:14:42,860 --> 01:14:46,140
that's not on Disney Plus for some reason.

1700
01:14:46,260 --> 01:14:49,500
And this involves a Mary Poppins themed wedding.

1701
01:14:49,500 --> 01:14:50,580
Nobody saw this, right?

1702
01:14:50,580 --> 01:14:52,780
I think I don't see this now.

1703
01:14:52,780 --> 01:14:55,860
And if they they managed to find an aspect they could incorporate

1704
01:14:55,860 --> 01:14:58,340
that bothers me even more than flash mobs.

1705
01:14:58,340 --> 01:15:00,620
Here's a little here's some audio.

1706
01:15:00,620 --> 01:15:03,900
Join our house on Twitch and I miss his twitch, but you can call me

1707
01:15:04,380 --> 01:15:06,380
for a Mary Poppins returns wedding.

1708
01:15:06,380 --> 01:15:07,220
That's practically.

1709
01:15:07,220 --> 01:15:10,140
Poppins returns wedding featuring Lin-Manuel Miranda.

1710
01:15:10,140 --> 01:15:11,340
Hello, hello.

1711
01:15:11,460 --> 01:15:14,420
And hello, hello.

1712
01:15:14,660 --> 01:15:17,940
I wouldn't say, you know, you didn't say returns.

1713
01:15:17,940 --> 01:15:19,260
You just said Mary Poppins.

1714
01:15:19,260 --> 01:15:21,980
Yeah, wait, that is you did you had to go.

1715
01:15:21,980 --> 01:15:25,180
Mary Poppins returns themed wedding dirt.

1716
01:15:25,180 --> 01:15:26,860
And the whole turning party.

1717
01:15:26,860 --> 01:15:30,100
Turning turtle turning turtle,

1718
01:15:30,500 --> 01:15:32,620
to see I want topsy.

1719
01:15:32,620 --> 01:15:33,660
They're the mayor.

1720
01:15:33,660 --> 01:15:38,540
It has to show up as topsy at my Mary Poppins returns wedding.

1721
01:15:38,540 --> 01:15:41,100
Can't break character.

1722
01:15:41,100 --> 01:15:42,700
He will not stay the whole time.

1723
01:15:42,700 --> 01:15:43,380
She never would.

1724
01:15:43,380 --> 01:15:44,740
She's America's greatest treasure.

1725
01:15:44,740 --> 01:15:47,260
She wouldn't. Yeah, she's got to be there the whole time, too.

1726
01:15:47,260 --> 01:15:48,740
And come to the after party.

1727
01:15:48,740 --> 01:15:51,180
The bride and groom kiss upside down.

1728
01:15:53,060 --> 01:15:53,900
We're turning.

1729
01:15:53,900 --> 01:15:56,140
Well, did we did we do it?

1730
01:15:56,140 --> 01:15:58,380
And then Disney's fairytale weddings.

1731
01:15:58,380 --> 01:15:59,460
Did you survive it?

1732
01:15:59,500 --> 01:16:01,300
Listeners, you asked, we answered.

1733
01:16:01,300 --> 01:16:02,420
We answered. We did it.

1734
01:16:02,420 --> 01:16:03,580
We loved the show.

1735
01:16:03,580 --> 01:16:05,460
Or we are having a swatch.

1736
01:16:05,460 --> 01:16:06,180
The show.

1737
01:16:06,180 --> 01:16:07,900
I thought it was it was better than I expected.

1738
01:16:07,900 --> 01:16:10,700
I think it's a good if you're cleaning the house, put it on the background

1739
01:16:10,700 --> 01:16:12,660
like House Hunters or Dino Travis and Dodd.

1740
01:16:12,660 --> 01:16:14,340
That's a high recommendation.

1741
01:16:14,340 --> 01:16:16,260
It's not as good, but it's in that genre.

1742
01:16:16,260 --> 01:16:19,260
It's in that genre of TV you put on in the background.

1743
01:16:19,260 --> 01:16:22,380
I don't know that I could in good conscience recommend this.

1744
01:16:22,380 --> 01:16:25,180
I don't think it's even in the same zip code, you know,

1745
01:16:25,380 --> 01:16:28,700
not like your prince birthday party, you know, but it

1746
01:16:29,340 --> 01:16:30,460
you put it on the back.

1747
01:16:31,460 --> 01:16:32,620
We got a tweet out of Prince.

1748
01:16:32,620 --> 01:16:35,860
We are doing a binge watch of Disney's fairytale weddings.

1749
01:16:35,860 --> 01:16:38,300
You've got to go over it as princes in it.

1750
01:16:38,300 --> 01:16:40,340
Prince, like from the Disney movies.

1751
01:16:40,340 --> 01:16:43,180
And he may have done like the Disney wedding special.

1752
01:16:43,180 --> 01:16:45,620
I have bad news for you.

1753
01:16:46,620 --> 01:16:48,020
Oh, no.

1754
01:16:48,020 --> 01:16:49,420
What happened five years ago?

1755
01:16:49,420 --> 01:16:51,300
Yeah. Seven years ago.

1756
01:16:51,300 --> 01:16:52,020
Oh, yes. Yeah.

1757
01:16:52,020 --> 01:16:53,020
He didn't make it.

1758
01:16:53,020 --> 01:16:56,140
Prince didn't wasn't able to see this show, but we were.

1759
01:16:56,260 --> 01:16:59,860
And thanks for for having us watch it.

1760
01:17:00,700 --> 01:17:03,820
I think, hey, if you want us to watch it,

1761
