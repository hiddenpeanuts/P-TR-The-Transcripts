1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,840
Forever.

2
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:03,680
Dog.

3
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:08,520
Warning, the following podcast contains a famous nephew,

4
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:12,840
stomach acid strength, a big slug,

5
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:16,520
and hard eye contact with a barely emoting gorilla.

6
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:20,480
All that plus we tackle Skull Island, reign of Kong,

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,040
on today's podcast, The Ride.

8
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:47,960
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, hosted by three people with skulls,

9
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,960
which are wasted, storing theme park facts.

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,440
I'm one of the skull owners.

11
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,520
Scott gets up with skulls is the name.

12
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,680
I don't know, that resonates, right?

13
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:58,920
We know it's about skulls.

14
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,200
Jason Sheridan, hi.

15
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:03,600
I mean, I have a lot of facts about islands of adventure.

16
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,880
So it all works out.

17
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:05,720
In your skull.

18
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:06,560
In my skull, yeah.

19
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,720
In your skull.

20
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:11,600
Keep your skull safe so we can get them all out.

21
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,160
Mike Carlson, how's your skull?

22
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,680
My skull is okay.

23
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,520
I took a nap.

24
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,960
I've been complaining about it ever since I got here

25
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,560
10 minutes ago.

26
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,840
So I have a dreamy skull still.

27
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:25,600
I'm still, my skull is still, I guess not my skull,

28
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,280
but the contents of my skull are still recovering

29
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,280
from the nap.

30
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:33,720
Well, I bet your skull contents are also recovering

31
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,480
from your activities last night,

32
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,640
which I wanted to wait and bring up on the show,

33
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,920
because I woke up to them dreamily this morning.

34
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,240
And I just want to say to your text, OMG.

35
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,880
And then before that, the screenshot of what it was,

36
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:50,520
which was that Sammy Hagar had been on Bill Maher's podcast

37
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,880
and web show Club Random.

38
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:52,720
That's right.

39
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,200
I figured I'd just wait and do it in person.

40
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,120
I hope it was a great episode.

41
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:57,960
It was to both of us.

42
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,400
I want to give Jason a chance to say anything

43
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,240
he wanted to.

44
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,760
Yeah, I might've already been like half asleep.

45
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,600
It might've been very early and I got up

46
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,320
for a couple more hours and I went back to sleep.

47
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,720
Well, but you're making it about you.

48
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,680
What do you think about Mike and the great video

49
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,520
he got to watch?

50
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,840
You know, I haven't swung by yet.

51
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:18,640
I haven't swung by the old CR, the old club, you know?

52
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,880
But I'm happy, happy for you.

53
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:21,800
Thank you, yes.

54
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:26,800
It was a big, I've been a big proponent of Club Random,

55
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,400
I guess.

56
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,760
Bill Maher and his bad opinions and his bad show

57
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,680
where he drinks and smokes weed and then people come on

58
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,240
and he annoys them.

59
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:40,760
It's the dimmest show, the grungiest show.

60
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,160
They just need to like take that saturation

61
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,920
and the brightness and dial it up.

62
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:50,920
It looks like, oh, so this is footage from 1968

63
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,640
and it needs to be restored.

64
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,680
Can we take it to a lab?

65
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,400
No, no, no, this was filmed several days ago.

66
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,320
But the things they're saying, the opinions,

67
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,200
surely this is from 1968.

68
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,640
Yeah. No, no, no, no.

69
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,280
So yeah, so Sammy Hagar appeared on the show

70
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:09,160
and I have not finished, I've watched 45 minutes of it

71
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,400
at this point.

72
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,800
Out of?

73
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,760
It's like an hour and something.

74
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,480
Oh, okay.

75
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,320
Yeah.

76
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,160
I was worried.

77
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,000
Yeah, he doesn't go like crazy.

78
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,840
He's in his six hour.

79
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,160
I'm glad you brought this up.

80
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,000
Mm-hmm.

81
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,840
Because I-

82
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,680
As is the audience, yes.

83
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,600
The audience is thrilled.

84
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,440
They saw the title of this, new listeners thrilled

85
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,280
to talk about this.

86
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,120
Yeah, it's show at theme parks, we'll get to it.

87
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,600
And all of a sudden they're in the fucking mud right now.

88
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,960
Like, what am I in the mud?

89
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,520
Why am I talking about Bill Maher?

90
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,200
Oh shit, what is this shit?

91
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,880
Do they ever start?

92
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,360
They skip 40 minutes in, still a tangent.

93
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,800
Hour 20, still a tangent.

94
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,560
Why does most of this guy's interests,

95
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,760
why is it stuff that he likes to punish himself with?

96
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,720
What is that about?

97
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,680
What's contained in his skull that makes him

98
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,640
wanna punish himself with stuff like this?

99
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,800
You're also sitting, drinking a bottle of like,

100
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,200
is that regular Sprite or dumb?

101
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,040
Regular Sprite.

102
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,240
You're drinking full fat Sprite,

103
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,080
so you're gonna have a sugar rush.

104
00:03:59,080 --> 00:03:59,920
Full fat?

105
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,240
Full fat Sprite.

106
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,440
As opposed to diet Sprite, I mean.

107
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,960
What does anyone call it?

108
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,320
I don't know, what else?

109
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,560
Regular Sprite.

110
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,040
Yeah, I would say Sprite.

111
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,920
It's sugar, so you're gonna crash.

112
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:11,920
You're gonna get that higher.

113
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,560
I love full fat, there's zero total fat, no fat.

114
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,520
Well, I don't think of it as fat.

115
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,360
It's not.

116
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,480
How much fat is in Sprite?

117
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,320
But how many grams of sugar is that?

118
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:24,080
Oh, there's a decent amount of sugar, of course.

119
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,760
Okay, well, follow-up question.

120
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,520
What was your dinner and what are you gonna eat

121
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,360
when you get home?

122
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,240
Oh, I kind of skipped on dinner,

123
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,640
so I was eating a Nature Valley granola bar

124
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,680
on the drive over.

125
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,200
All right, all right.

126
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:39,520
I'm debating how to destroy my brain after the show

127
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,480
if I get a Big Mac on the way home or.

128
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,320
That's full fat.

129
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,840
Or that is full fat.

130
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,680
There's only one option there and it's full fat.

131
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,160
But I haven't eaten a lot today.

132
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,760
Or do I go to the 10 10 showing of Crimes of the Future

133
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,480
at the Burbank AMC's.

134
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,320
Sneak a Big Mac in there.

135
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,560
Oh, let's do both.

136
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,480
Oh, sneak a Big Mac into a Cronut Burt movie.

137
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:02,840
There are only four tickets sold so far, so.

138
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:03,800
So you'll be distant.

139
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,800
You don't need to work on it during the record.

140
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,120
You don't need to get the jump.

141
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,040
No, yeah, yeah.

142
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,200
People are listening to this show

143
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,400
and thinking this show should be called Club Random

144
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,720
with the topic switching.

145
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,520
They have talked about any and everything but.

146
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,120
So real quick, I was very excited about this

147
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,760
because I have often wondered if Sammy Hagar

148
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:26,560
held any sort of animus tour to Jimmy Buffett

149
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,280
or any of the other people who have sort of jumped on

150
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,720
the celebrity liquor bandwagon in the last few years

151
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,760
because Sammy's been doing this longer than everyone.

152
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,600
And he does.

153
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,640
Does it predate Margaritaville also?

154
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,480
Yes.

155
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,240
And Cabo Wabo was his brand, which he sold,

156
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,720
and now he has a new, like a hard seltzer drink

157
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,320
or something, I think.

158
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,360
He has a new drink,

159
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,280
but he already made his money from Cabo Wabo.

160
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,680
Full fat, full taste.

161
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,960
Full fat, full fat liquid.

162
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:57,200
That's so good.

163
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:03,600
So he does, he throws a little shade at George Clooney

164
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,520
and Jimmy Buffett at the start of this.

165
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,600
At Clooney?

166
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,440
Yeah, because he kind of.

167
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,920
Who is he, me?

168
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,880
Yeah, so he's obviously, he's a little resentful

169
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:15,280
that Clooney sort of came in and did the whole Casamigos

170
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,880
because he feels like he's the number one guy.

171
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,040
He didn't say that,

172
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,080
but that's sort of the tone of the conversation.

173
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:20,920
Wow, wow.

174
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:24,200
So I was like, okay, Sammy's getting real at Club Random

175
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,040
because usually he's just doing

176
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:29,080
some sort of a rock and roll interview on Access TV.

177
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,160
That's usually how I'm watching him

178
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:34,080
because I very often am watching him interview

179
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,000
one of his musician pals on Access TV.

180
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,480
He's doing the interview?

181
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,240
He's got an interview show.

182
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,320
Yeah.

183
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:44,720
He gets to rock and talk, talk rock with a lot of the guys.

184
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,760
He gets to rock and talk rock.

185
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:49,760
Yeah, he gets to do both things, talk rock and rock,

186
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,840
which is a good combination,

187
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,360
which two things I like to do as well.

188
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,640
So you get a little of that.

189
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:58,120
You get some, there's some bawdy talk up top with Bill

190
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,560
because Bill always wants to talk about ladies.

191
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,880
Well, that's what here, content warning, skip ahead,

192
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,760
because I put it on for a second

193
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,120
because I was curious what you were omg-ing about.

194
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,240
And the first thing it landed on was,

195
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,880
hey, settle a bet.

196
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,800
Do you get a lot of pussy?

197
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,800
Ugh.

198
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,640
Yeah.

199
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,480
Yeah.

200
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,320
That's what Bill said.

201
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,960
Don't say babe, but does the uh change?

202
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,760
If you remember that's coming from a 70 year old man.

203
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,160
To another 70 year old man?

204
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,560
To another 70 year old man.

205
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,120
And that they are both sweaty in the shot.

206
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:31,400
As usual on Club Random, the guests,

207
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:34,120
like Bill makes the guests seem like the easiest person

208
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,520
to hang out with in the world.

209
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,280
You're like that other guest seems nice compared to Bill.

210
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,160
Cause Bill is like, Sam's like, oh man,

211
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,080
you know he says it a little bit,

212
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,120
but then later, Sammy's getting uncomfortable

213
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,560
with the amount of times Bill has said the word pussy.

214
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,400
Oh boy.

215
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,680
So Sammy's like, oh no man, people are gonna think

216
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,320
we're like being like degrading.

217
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,360
He goes, no that's not it.

218
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,000
It's beautiful, everything's beautiful, man.

219
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,960
It's all good, everything's good.

220
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,840
You know, sex is a beautiful thing.

221
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,360
He's explaining to Bill.

222
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,080
He's gotten worse somehow.

223
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,440
Yeah, I know, yeah.

224
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,040
Being a beautiful thing.

225
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,240
He's trying to get away from Bill's body,

226
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,080
is what I'm saying.

227
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,560
I'm saying Sammy is trying to defuse.

228
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,640
As by the way, as we need to do.

229
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,080
I agree as well.

230
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,720
But when you open the door to Club Random.

231
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,320
We have to, let's cut off the people

232
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,920
who have already typed into their comment boxes,

233
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,840
oh so 20 minutes about Club Random.

234
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,800
Let's see if we can get them to backspace it.

235
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,800
Okay, yeah, yeah.

236
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,120
It's my fault, I brought it up.

237
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,240
You did bring it up, which.

238
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,000
Look, any time on this show,

239
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,760
we can open up the door to Club Random.

240
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,360
And then the topics will get random.

241
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,440
Let's just say that.

242
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,960
Wouldn't it be funny if Bill Maher sued us

243
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,600
if we stole Club Random for some sort of aspect

244
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,440
of our show?

245
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,080
I think it would.

246
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,080
Did he lock those words down?

247
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,120
I don't know, let's find out.

248
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:46,960
Anyway.

249
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:50,120
Scott, I did, I texted Mike something last night.

250
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:54,160
I texted him a link on I think the Walmart website

251
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:59,240
to a vintage, well a reproduction of a vintage

252
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:02,760
Toys R Us Ghostbusters, real Ghostbusters toy.

253
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:05,600
Fearsome flush the haunted toilet.

254
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,440
Okay.

255
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,480
I sent him this link and he replied, already got it.

256
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,320
So.

257
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:17,320
$12, retro, they're redoing all the old Kenner

258
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,960
real Ghostbusters toys.

259
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,840
And I have a few, I have the Venkman

260
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,320
because he was always my favorite obviously.

261
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,000
Like that was a stretch.

262
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,600
Every kid liked Venkman.

263
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,720
But then they have the toilet monster

264
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,080
and I had to get it, so.

265
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,120
They settle a bet.

266
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:35,000
Can fearsome flush hold a lot of shit?

267
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,760
Oh man, don't call it shit, man.

268
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,960
That's not a nice, let's just call it excrement.

269
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,520
Let's say what it is, you know?

270
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,840
Answer the question.

271
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,680
We're in.

272
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,920
You're making it sound bad.

273
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,320
It's just the thing our bodies do.

274
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,480
That's a natural thing.

275
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,160
Smoke on this loud.

276
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,000
Come on.

277
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,520
Hit this loud.

278
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:56,520
Okay, let's veer from this to what the audience is,

279
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,520
what they actually wanna hear, what they are begging for

280
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:02,160
and that is the beginning of Discussing the Ride,

281
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,640
Skull Island, Reign of Kong.

282
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,640
And what I say the people are waiting for

283
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:11,000
and waiting for us to do is a classic podcast, The Ride.

284
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,160
This is not that.

285
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,000
Yeah, yeah.

286
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,840
Yeah, I got it.

287
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:16,040
Yeah, you know exactly where we're heading.

288
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,320
Yes, there is breaking down to do.

289
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,440
Would you like to say one of the things

290
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,640
that this is not?

291
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,680
Well, maybe first of all, this is a ride in Islands

292
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:25,160
of Adventure in Universal Orlando,

293
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:28,520
which means it is not, there are Kong things

294
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:31,600
that are similarly titled such as?

295
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:36,600
It is not the 2017 movie Kong Skull Island.

296
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:42,920
Skull Island, Reign of Kong is not Kong Skull Island.

297
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:46,920
No, because this ride is set in the 1930s.

298
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:52,440
It is a prequel even to the Peter Jackson film, King Kong.

299
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,520
It happens before the events of that movie,

300
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,920
much less that movie Kong Skull Island,

301
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,160
which confusingly was coming out after The Ride was opened.

302
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:05,280
And that movie is set in the 70s, I think.

303
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,120
And like.

304
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,160
Yeah, Dora Nam, yeah.

305
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah, because it's the first,

306
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,760
because it came out in 2017, remember?

307
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,600
Yeah, yeah.

308
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,800
And the first shot of it is this big protest in Washington

309
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,280
and then John Goodman says,

310
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:20,000
things will never get crazier in this country.

311
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,480
Yes, he does say that.

312
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,840
The audience stood and applauded for so long,

313
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:26,280
they missed the next scene and a half.

314
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,680
Interesting that you mentioned that.

315
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:32,000
Apparently the rights for Kong,

316
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,580
the legendary, I believe it was production company,

317
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:41,160
the rights jumped from Universal to Warner Brothers.

318
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:44,640
And there's a 2016 slash film article that said,

319
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,840
rumor has it that if this project

320
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,840
had gotten approved 30 days earlier,

321
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:52,080
it would have been a Jurassic Park ride instead.

322
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:52,920
Whoa.

323
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,000
Or a Jurassic World ride, excuse me.

324
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,840
Whoa, because it is in the Jurassic Park area.

325
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,680
Yeah.

326
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,800
Technically a violence of adventure.

327
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,800
Wait a minute, so, oh, that's wild.

328
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,720
Because you have to remember 2016,

329
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:08,200
that summer Jurassic World is coming out.

330
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,040
Mm-hmm.

331
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,120
Was it before, was it 2015, I wanna say?

332
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:12,960
Was it?

333
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:13,920
I could be wrong.

334
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:14,840
But.

335
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:15,680
Yeah, 2015.

336
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,600
But it was like, you know, it was still fresh, I think.

337
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:23,600
And there is still no Jurassic World presence in Florida.

338
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:25,920
Right.

339
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,360
That is sure to change now that it's Jurassic World.

340
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,080
Mania out there, it's Locust,

341
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,600
it's genetically modified Locust mania out there.

342
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:36,080
It was 2015, so they would have known it was a massive hit.

343
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,880
So it would have been a reliable choice

344
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,200
for a property for a ride.

345
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,720
Wait, Velocicoaster is Jurassic World?

346
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,560
Oh, that's, oh, wait a minute.

347
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,400
Yeah.

348
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,520
All right.

349
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,800
I haven't even been there.

350
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,200
I was like, oh, maybe I'm wrong.

351
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,040
Yeah, you're right.

352
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:50,280
And is there like Pratt material?

353
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,120
I think so.

354
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,560
I think Pratt has a video.

355
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:56,040
I'm trying to go clean, cold as far as the ride.

356
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,160
Clean and cold.

357
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:01,400
You just cut off at the pass people yelling about that.

358
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,240
Yeah.

359
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,000
I guess I was just not thinking,

360
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,080
cause the other one here is called Jurassic World the ride.

361
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:08,920
Right.

362
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,720
Which that is not, so it tricked me.

363
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,560
That's true, right.

364
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,760
So the presence is growing.

365
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:13,600
Blue is there.

366
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,440
We can see all our friends.

367
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,680
Can we see Claire Dearing?

368
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:17,520
I think she did something.

369
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,200
I think Claire, is Claire on the Velocicoaster?

370
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,280
I'm not 100% sure.

371
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,280
We're trying to go in clean.

372
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,120
Clean and cold.

373
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,120
Yeah. Clean and cold to the ride.

374
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,960
So we don't know if Claire is there.

375
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,400
Make sure it's both clean and cold.

376
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:30,800
Are there other things that this ride is not?

377
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:35,800
Well, I wanted to be clear that it is not King Kong 360 3D,

378
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,360
Right.

379
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,440
Which is the proto version of it

380
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,800
that is part of the Universal Tram Tour.

381
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,640
Yes.

382
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:46,040
It also obviously is not Kongfrontation,

383
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,760
which was the, which we did an episode about.

384
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:49,960
That one we've covered. I remember that.

385
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,200
Of the Kongs.

386
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,960
That's the one that we've done.

387
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:55,520
It's a real sticky mess here, these Kongs.

388
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,360
Yeah.

389
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,680
And if, cause there's so many sub Kong attractions to do.

390
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,440
Kongfrontation was the Universal Florida,

391
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,240
the original ride with big robotic Kongs.

392
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,080
Yep.

393
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:08,120
And then King Kong encounter is apparently the official name

394
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:12,400
of what it was on the tram before it burnt to the ground.

395
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,240
Yeah.

396
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,080
2007.

397
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,200
Yeah. Yeah.

398
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,240
So probably the most important of the,

399
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:23,800
this is not that is King Kong 360 3D because,

400
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:27,560
so if you haven't been on the Universal Tram Tour,

401
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,360
robot Kong burnt down.

402
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,600
They did this new thing in 2010 that is screen-based.

403
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,520
You drive into a building and there are two big screens

404
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:40,440
on either side of you, which they do not cover the transit into.

405
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,280
No.

406
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,120
You drive in.

407
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,920
Yeah. They don't cover above or below.

408
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:48,440
So it's more like, it's not even Kong 180.

409
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:51,200
It's Kong pillar boxed.

410
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,040
Like.

411
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,200
Yeah. There's no, yes.

412
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,720
There's no amount of degrees that have been,

413
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:58,520
it's, yeah, it is a little less than, well, no, it's,

414
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:02,800
it's 360 minus a big center sliver.

415
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,640
Yeah.

416
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,600
Right.

417
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,040
Plus every bar and person blocking your view.

418
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,480
Was there already a King Kong 3D?

419
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,320
Am I imagining that?

420
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,240
I think maybe I'm thinking of Jaws 3D.

421
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,080
I don't think that was a movie.

422
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:16,920
A film.

423
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:17,760
A movie.

424
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,600
King Kong 3D.

425
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,480
I don't believe.

426
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,560
But anyways, the,

427
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:26,680
when I heard, when this was getting announced,

428
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:30,160
I thought, oh, is this some kind of,

429
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,520
let's shove that in version.

430
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,800
As Fast and Furious ended up being,

431
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:39,520
that was a clearly designed for the Universal Tram Tour in LA.

432
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:42,920
Let's try to piece that out into its own ride in Florida.

433
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:46,160
So I thought, is this going to be one of those?

434
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,600
Is it kind of, let's just shove it in

435
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,520
and make this a custom ride vehicle and that's good.

436
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,560
And for the most part, I would say no,

437
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,680
because I would not be excited about that at all.

438
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,560
I don't really like that thing in the Tram Tour.

439
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,560
This thing, I don't know how y'all feel.

440
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,200
I really like this thing.

441
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,120
Well, I'll say this.

442
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:04,400
I like that part of the Tram Tour.

443
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,120
I do like, I don't, it's not amazing,

444
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:10,040
but I do like it versus obviously the Fast and Furious part.

445
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,600
Yeah, I like it.

446
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,600
I think the Islands of Adventure attraction,

447
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,080
I think is like a pretty solid attraction,

448
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,040
going back and re-watching videos and stuff.

449
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,760
I was like, oh, I do like this.

450
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:25,440
And they did like put a lot of attention in

451
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,560
and added some new stuff, like original characters

452
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,480
and like little nods.

453
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,200
I think they tried to make, they nodded to like

454
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:36,360
the essential King Kong elements,

455
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:39,480
like the island, the big wall,

456
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:43,400
like other freakish creatures on the island.

457
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,680
Early 20th century, mid 20th century explorers.

458
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:50,600
Yeah.

459
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,640
You get a more, you get a fully fleshed out experience.

460
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,760
But here, now I'm wondering from having to toss this out here,

461
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:58,000
am I more enthusiastic about Skull Island here

462
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:58,840
than the both of y'all?

463
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:01,560
I feel like maybe I'm a little above you

464
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:02,400
and Mike, I don't know.

465
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,440
Here's what I'm gonna say.

466
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,400
And I'm not, I swear to you, I'm not doing this to troll.

467
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,080
I'm not doing this to start another,

468
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,440
we're not gonna opening up a club random door,

469
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:14,000
but I swear to you, I'm gonna say this and it's true.

470
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,920
When we went to Islands of Adventure

471
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:18,000
and did this for the first time,

472
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,800
we got on it and we enjoyed it.

473
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,080
And then I heard people talking about it

474
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:26,400
and I remember going, well, what are they talking about?

475
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,240
What else?

476
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,080
I missed these elements

477
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:31,560
and the elements they were talking about were in the queue.

478
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,960
They were in the line.

479
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:33,800
Up, up.

480
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,920
And we totally missed them

481
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,600
because there's some cool shit in that line.

482
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,760
And I really feel that eases you into,

483
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,360
like the fast pass version of getting onto the ride

484
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,600
really robbed us of sort of getting in the mood for the ride.

485
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,080
And I do think, and again, this is not trolling,

486
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:52,480
I'm not, I'm not, this is a thought I'm having in real time

487
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,320
with Belmar.

488
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,240
No, no, the curse.

489
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,200
The curse of Mar.

490
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,960
Oh, the curse of Mar.

491
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,440
Think carefully about what you're gonna say next.

492
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,760
Don't say anything politically incorrect.

493
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:07,760
Oh no, oh, Sammy kept saying, calling his show now

494
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,720
politically incorrect and Bill was getting,

495
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:10,640
driving him nuts.

496
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,000
He hated it and it was so funny.

497
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,680
So yeah, so I saw it and I go,

498
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,760
oh yeah, the queue is really cool.

499
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:19,120
And I do feel like in the same way that Indiana Jones

500
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,560
really sets the mood for it.

501
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,880
So I think when watching the videos, I go,

502
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,240
oh, I think I would have liked this a little more

503
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:27,040
if I had done the queue.

504
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,440
All right, look, yeah, we're at the,

505
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,960
it occurred to me that this might,

506
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:36,720
we might head into this area because, you know,

507
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,960
look, I'll just, I'll dive right in.

508
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:44,960
This is as close as I could think of to an unskippable queue.

509
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,480
That's me saying, I think it's a very good queue

510
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,800
and it might be even an attraction where

511
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,760
the queue is half of it.

512
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,760
There's a lot, because you got animatronics there,

513
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,920
you got great sets, you got atmosphere.

514
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,840
You have a, I think this is a line first,

515
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:04,120
a Scarecter jumps out in the,

516
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:07,080
which I don't remember happening when I was there.

517
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,880
They might have been on break.

518
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,440
It might only be like busier times of the year

519
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:15,520
because I don't think I have seen that either.

520
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,160
There is, I mean, there's a lot to like about it.

521
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,480
I think overall, this is like a rock solid,

522
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:24,360
like attraction for Universal.

523
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,560
But queue wise.

524
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,400
Queue wise, terrific.

525
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,440
You did the full queue.

526
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,600
I, well, I think I did express too when I did it,

527
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:35,360
but it was looping it through most of the queue.

528
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,720
I don't know that I saw the worm animatronic.

529
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,120
I saw the shaman animatronic.

530
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,160
I don't remember that either, yeah.

531
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,120
I might have single writered it, I don't recall,

532
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,320
but I saw a lot of stuff.

533
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:48,400
Yeah, my memory of it, unless we really were out of it,

534
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,880
my memory is we kind of went in a real quick way,

535
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:55,800
kind of right on the ride portion of it.

536
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,360
But let me ask you this.

537
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:02,360
How much do you actually regret this having happened?

538
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:05,640
How many, over on my list of regrets of my life?

539
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,240
No, this is not in the top 100.

540
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:10,120
And that is what I'm saying, that's the argument.

541
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,440
That's not the argument.

542
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,280
That's not the argument.

543
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,520
It is, it is the argument.

544
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,360
The regret of your life.

545
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:16,440
The idea that you would like think back and go,

546
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:19,000
God, but I, that wasn't, like you're only,

547
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,600
you might only be there once.

548
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,680
You'll be there again, but.

549
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,320
You were just saying there's certain cues

550
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,320
if people had the time to spend

551
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,440
that you would want them to go through.

552
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,720
That's really what we were talking about, I think.

553
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,560
That's my memory of it.

554
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,380
But now.

555
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:33,220
We're gonna have to go back to the tape.

556
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:34,560
Having brought this up.

557
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,240
You're down in Florida.

558
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,720
Maybe you are with other people.

559
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,640
You get front of the line passes.

560
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,320
Let's do express, let's skip some stuff.

561
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:46,400
Your friends say, oh, let's use express pass

562
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,680
on Skull Island, Reign of Kong.

563
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:51,920
Do you now say, I'm sorry, friends.

564
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:56,140
What we need to do is experience the cue in full

565
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:57,640
because I've heard it's very good.

566
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,700
And even Scott.

567
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:01,720
Okay.

568
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,840
The villain of this argument.

569
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:03,680
Okay, okay.

570
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:07,600
I would probably be more benevolent and say,

571
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,560
you guys do the express.

572
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,560
I'll catch up with you in a little while.

573
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,840
I'm gonna do the full cue.

574
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:16,060
I know it sounds silly, but there's a lot of stuff.

575
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:20,660
Like for example, 150,000 square feet of rock work.

576
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:21,500
Well, that's a lot of rock work.

577
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,980
By the time you said that,

578
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:24,660
they would be right there with you.

579
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:26,100
Just running.

580
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:26,940
I said this in the time,

581
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,140
you gotta know your audience

582
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:29,780
when you're with people at the parks.

583
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:30,620
Yes.

584
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:31,440
You gotta know your audience.

585
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,400
So I'm a, look, I'm a crowd pleaser.

586
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:37,240
I am somebody who wants to cater to the group.

587
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:40,180
So obviously, look, if I'm with some of my rowdy guys

588
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:43,920
from my hometown and they just want those thrills,

589
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,780
like hit you in the face thrills,

590
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,900
then yeah, okay, we can skip the cues.

591
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:48,740
And I know they're not gonna.

592
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:49,580
You're roughnecks.

593
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:50,400
Yeah.

594
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,700
All my rowdy friends and I are going

595
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,020
to the theme park tonight.

596
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:56,980
They're like giving you a wedgie as you're rattling off.

597
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:59,940
12 guests per row, 72 per vehicle.

598
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:02,340
You're dying to say these facts.

599
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:04,460
You were like, we're over, we're having a little thing.

600
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:06,100
And you're like, how quickly can I get the facts, Megan?

601
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,900
We're having a debate and you're trying to.

602
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:11,140
But, it's 72.

603
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:13,180
So yeah, so I think it depends.

604
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:14,020
I think it depends.

605
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:15,860
Certainly if, okay, how about this?

606
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:16,980
You got some friends.

607
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:19,140
They move out to Los Angeles, California.

608
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:20,340
Maybe they're not theme park people,

609
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:22,020
but they're open-minded, okay?

610
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:22,860
Yeah.

611
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:24,240
And they go, you know what?

612
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,080
I would like to get.

613
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,180
You say let's all have sex together.

614
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:27,620
And you do and it's wonderful.

615
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:28,460
And you forget about theme parks.

616
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:31,620
Let's go to a special club with bad lighting.

617
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:37,500
Yeah, so you say, okay, we'll go to the theme parks.

618
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,860
And then I would start to go.

619
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:41,820
You start, I'm slow and you start to explain

620
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:42,980
the history of things.

621
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,780
There's certain people you know,

622
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:47,140
and especially if they have the time.

623
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:49,180
So what I'm trying to say is, in this scenario,

624
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:50,340
somebody has the time.

625
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:52,260
And you'd say, oh, have you ever walked through

626
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:54,860
the whole line of whatever ride we're talking about?

627
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:56,860
Oh, you only do single rider at Indiana Jones.

628
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:59,660
Well, did you know there's a long queue?

629
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:01,060
And then you point things out.

630
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:02,600
But they have to be that type of person

631
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,700
that might appreciate it.

632
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:04,540
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

633
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:05,380
So.

634
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:06,420
This is, look, I appreciate.

635
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:07,780
I like both of your answers.

636
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:09,700
Jason gave a very realistic answer

637
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:10,820
of something he would say.

638
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:11,660
Yeah.

639
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:13,260
Force the group to do it.

640
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:14,100
Sure.

641
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,620
Where I felt like the first time this came up

642
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:18,420
is that what was expected of me

643
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:21,620
is that I veer everyone with me.

644
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:22,740
No, no, I think what.

645
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:25,300
You need to do your homework.

646
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:28,860
I think what happens when we all have debates on this show

647
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:31,420
is the same thing that happens in politics

648
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:34,380
where all of a sudden we're at the very ends

649
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:36,460
of every side of the argument.

650
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:39,620
When maybe that's not actually where the argument started.

651
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:41,260
So the argument started, I feel like,

652
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:42,660
I don't know what I'm saying,

653
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:46,500
but it somehow morphed into Scott hates lines,

654
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,340
hates the.

655
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:48,180
Yeah, which button.

656
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:49,900
Yeah, and look, I don't like that.

657
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:51,340
That's something people say to me

658
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:52,740
and comes up in comments and stuff.

659
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:54,860
Like, people suggest like a club three.

660
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:58,460
Like, what about lines that Scott would actually do?

661
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:00,180
I do lines all the time.

662
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:02,500
I'm just saying the argument.

663
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:03,660
But, yeah.

664
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:06,180
If you had the option to skip all of them always.

665
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:07,300
A lot of these arguments,

666
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:09,820
we would have to go back to the scene of the crime

667
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:14,820
and really suss out exactly those first like eight sentences,

668
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:18,300
eight to 15 sentences to actually figure out

669
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:19,980
what everyone's opinion is on them.

670
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:20,820
Sure.

671
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:21,660
You know?

672
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:22,500
Right, right.

673
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:23,340
So, yeah.

674
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:25,460
Which is why we're gonna get back into Lake Nona

675
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:26,740
for a long time right now.

676
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:27,580
Yeah, you ready, Jason?

677
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:29,420
Right now, and let's go.

678
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:30,260
I was just letting you guys.

679
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:31,100
Let's go.

680
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:31,940
Patch it down.

681
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:32,780
All right, you all right.

682
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:35,580
Okay, you've let us talk, say some facts, say your facts.

683
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:41,420
2,160 guests per hour with a dispatch going every two minutes.

684
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:45,740
Although there's usually four of the five vehicles

685
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:47,380
going at any given time.

686
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:50,940
Do you have the miles per hour of the ride?

687
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:52,180
I don't have the miles per hour.

688
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:53,780
What do you think?

689
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:54,620
Oh, it's not.

690
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:56,420
You get like five miles, like two miles.

691
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:57,500
It's not a fast drive.

692
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,980
I was trying to tie it in.

693
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:00,620
I was trying to like do the Sammy Hagar,

694
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:02,780
I can't drive 55, but whatever.

695
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:04,340
Oh, yeah.

696
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:08,140
I can't drive four.

697
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:09,540
Four miles.

698
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:11,220
He's gotta do five.

699
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:14,980
He's one of the animatronic drivers of this attraction.

700
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:15,820
Oh, man.

701
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:20,060
It was Universal's first trackless ride.

702
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:24,940
And, you know, opened in 2016,

703
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:29,940
it is interesting that then Fast and Furious came after that

704
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:33,180
because they put so much time and attention

705
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:37,900
into like plussing up a port of like a clone

706
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:40,020
of the studio tour footage.

707
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:41,820
Yeah, making it way more of a beginning,

708
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:42,900
middle, and end experience.

709
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:45,620
They re-animate, they like up-res the animation,

710
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:47,900
they added, you know, they tweaked,

711
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:50,860
like there's not a tram being thrown.

712
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:52,980
There's another, you know, Safari car.

713
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:56,300
It's not a bright blue Universal tram anymore,

714
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:58,020
which I guess I miss in a way.

715
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:00,020
Wouldn't make sense if it was there.

716
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:01,060
But I kinda like that.

717
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,540
Maybe just because I, you know,

718
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:05,500
because I worked there and I see those babies,

719
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:08,060
it reminds me of my wild youth.

720
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:12,740
So seeing one in peril tumbling through the jungle,

721
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:14,420
like, oh, there's my girl.

722
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:16,100
That's how I feel about the tram.

723
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:18,540
When you were riding your rowdy years,

724
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:22,100
when you would think back to that first car you owned.

725
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:22,940
Yeah, mine was.

726
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:23,780
That first place you'd go to.

727
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:28,100
You were at Mel's night or pulling up at a multi-car tram.

728
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:32,300
I do consider that, yeah, that's my first car.

729
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:34,140
Mel's diner, then we'd take that thing

730
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:37,260
for a ride over to the big fat liar set.

731
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:40,700
Oh baby, those were the years.

732
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:43,100
You wanna get really wild, see a flash flood?

733
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:46,980
My friend Al Roker has some information about it.

734
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:49,580
I know we're not at this part of the tram yet,

735
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:52,780
but why don't I hit the gasoline, sound cute.

736
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:56,180
Oh, those days.

737
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:58,300
You never forget your first car.

738
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:02,980
That's a car that you are not licensed to operate.

739
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:05,620
It is a separate union from yours.

740
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:07,700
It's way better than yours anyway.

741
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:11,300
The vehicle is cool.

742
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:13,300
I don't know, it looks cool.

743
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:14,140
The vehicle of this?

744
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:17,540
Yeah, of the Islands of Adventure version.

745
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:23,140
Yeah, I remember, this shouldn't take any points away,

746
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:27,580
but I'm somewhat active as far as being a lurker

747
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:29,740
on the inside Universal message boards.

748
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:31,300
I think this is where I read this,

749
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:33,580
where they have a lot of rumors and people speculating.

750
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:34,740
It might not actually be these boards.

751
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:36,380
It might be different boards,

752
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:38,700
but there was a lot of talk before it opened

753
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:41,460
and then after it opened of speculation

754
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:45,460
on what the Universal Creative people were gonna do.

755
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:49,060
I do think in some ways, it had built it up

756
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:53,460
because there was lots of robots maybe in between.

757
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:54,700
Do you remember the one rumor,

758
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:56,780
because I'm gonna bring this up,

759
00:27:56,780 --> 00:28:00,580
that there was gonna be different tour guide characters,

760
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:03,900
which did pan out, that did come to pass,

761
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:08,300
but that Kong was going to reach into the cab

762
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:13,300
and pull the, make somehow they would do it

763
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:18,180
where the driver was pulled out of the car.

764
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:23,020
By Kong, which would have been admittedly awesome

765
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:26,380
and probably impossible, could probably pain in the ass.

766
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:28,500
Well, the thing, the rumor I had read on one of these boards

767
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,100
and again, who knows if that's true.

768
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:31,940
I mean, I think that one might have been a better source

769
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:32,780
even than this.

770
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:33,980
This was just like a message board,

771
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:35,780
but there's a rumor that they were gonna have

772
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:39,820
like animatronic Kong legs running behind you or something.

773
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:40,660
Yeah, they're running.

774
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:42,740
In some way, I'm not sure how they would make that look,

775
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:45,580
but there was some, yeah, very, very ambitious version

776
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:49,140
that probably would have mixed the 3D movie and robots.

777
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:49,980
How do you do that?

778
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:52,940
And then hit the ground with any.

779
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:54,580
I mean, I guess it couldn't hit the ground.

780
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:55,540
You would just make the noises

781
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:57,620
and it would kind of end up speculating.

782
00:28:57,620 --> 00:29:00,980
But just like the bending of joints on a massive scale,

783
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:03,380
that seems, I could see why they threw that out.

784
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:04,220
Which is cool as that would be.

785
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:05,740
Expensive as hell, yeah.

786
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:08,220
So I remember kind of reading a lot of that

787
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:10,060
and then maybe by the time,

788
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:11,940
like you see there's a little robot

789
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:14,980
and then there's just a nice,

790
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:18,060
I guess it's Optimus Prime style ending with the character

791
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:20,500
at the end, which is a robot, spoiler alert.

792
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,580
You get a real moment.

793
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:23,140
But yeah, yeah.

794
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:25,700
I think in some ways, when the ride was being built,

795
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:28,780
I think I was like, whoa, this thing's gonna be nuts.

796
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:29,820
And it's just like, it's good.

797
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:30,640
I do like it.

798
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,740
I'm not trying to put it down.

799
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:35,900
Basic synopsis of it, just to get that out of the way,

800
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:37,940
it is 1931.

801
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:40,360
You are on a expedition

802
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:43,620
with the Eighth Wonder Expedition Company

803
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:46,380
and you're going to explore Skull Island.

804
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:49,740
People don't really know everything that's going on there,

805
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:51,740
but you're trying to find if there's any evidence

806
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:53,980
of prehistoric creatures,

807
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:55,740
because that could be an incredible finding.

808
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:58,020
And there's archeologists already there

809
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:59,620
trying to do exactly that.

810
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:01,560
And boy, do you find them.

811
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:04,140
Boy, do you find them and then some.

812
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:04,980
Yeah.

813
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:08,060
And in fact, one of the archeologists, Kate,

814
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:13,060
is kidnapped by, not a bat, not a bat.

815
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:17,860
I mean, if you polled 99% of the people coming out of this,

816
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:19,220
they'd say it's a bat.

817
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:23,580
But the name of it is somewhere in my notes.

818
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:24,700
Oh, there it is.

819
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:27,820
A terapus mordax.

820
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:29,180
A terapus mordax?

821
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:30,540
A terapus mordax.

822
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:31,980
Jason, you have terapus mordax?

823
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:33,900
I did have terapus mordax.

824
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:38,380
She's, the bat does drop her and the other guy.

825
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:40,620
But you like that or a terapus?

826
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:42,220
Sorry, the terapus mordax.

827
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:44,140
You're confusing me.

828
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:44,820
Very good.

829
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:47,060
But then the giant claw that grabs her

830
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:51,100
is the giant crustacean, the deplector.

831
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:51,780
Oh, you're right.

832
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:52,280
Yeah.

833
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:55,580
The terapus mordax is just the beginning of the problem.

834
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:56,540
It's the.

835
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:57,820
Sorry, what then?

836
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:59,580
Deplector?

837
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:01,100
I don't have that.

838
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:01,940
Deplector?

839
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:03,220
I don't have that either.

840
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:07,660
I got a decarnate, decarnate cemex.

841
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:08,540
Oh, deplector here.

842
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:09,860
Is that the worm?

843
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:11,740
No, that's a.

844
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:14,060
That's a carnictus.

845
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:16,620
Deplector I have here is giant crustaceans

846
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:19,620
living in the cavernous crevices found along the walls

847
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:22,740
of the insect pit on the King Kong Wiki.

848
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:23,220
OK.

849
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:23,740
Yeah.

850
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:26,980
Because there's like big scorpions and big spiders.

851
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:27,500
Deplector.

852
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:28,140
And then a crab.

853
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:29,300
Deplector's a cool name.

854
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:30,180
Yeah.

855
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:31,020
Yeah, it's cool.

856
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:36,380
There's a lot of cool gross bugs and monsters and stuff.

857
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:39,820
And I like that they gave them names.

858
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:41,180
But we were pro-name.

859
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:42,260
The more names, the better.

860
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:43,220
Yeah.

861
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:45,260
It feels like they went.

862
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:48,940
They did go all out with the details and stuff.

863
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:53,820
There was also a lot of short making of videos on YouTube.

864
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:58,180
And then there was a fake web series called Myth Explorer.

865
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:00,420
Whoa, I didn't see that.

866
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:03,980
It's on the Universal Orlando account.

867
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:08,140
And it is like a fake discovery channel,

868
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:13,100
like globetrotting exploration show about a woman hunting

869
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:15,100
for the real Skull Island.

870
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:15,780
Wow.

871
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:19,740
But she acknowledges that there's been movies and TV shows.

872
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:21,940
And there's a ride coming to Universal.

873
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:25,220
It's like a thing within a thing.

874
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:30,620
And so yeah, it's 2017 or 2016.

875
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:35,180
There's also one of the behind the scenes videos.

876
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:36,820
A Universal creative person.

877
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:41,700
She goes really into the importance of STEM education,

878
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:44,700
of science and math education, which I feel like

879
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:47,180
was really big in 2016.

880
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:49,620
I feel like there was a big push about the importance

881
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:51,740
of STEM education.

882
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:54,140
It feels very much of its time.

883
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:58,020
And I'm sure that the educational thrust in that area

884
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:03,020
has remained under the firm leadership of Governor DeSantis.

885
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:05,020
Yeah.

886
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:05,660
Oh yeah.

887
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:07,900
Hope this on science and math is as strong as ever.

888
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:10,180
He's focused on all the right things.

889
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:11,220
All the right things.

890
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:12,980
The more books, the better, he says.

891
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:14,340
Oh yeah.

892
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:15,900
He is so mighty instead.

893
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:17,340
Fast, much like King Kong.

894
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:20,100
Much like the mighty Kong himself.

895
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:23,220
Countrywide, I feel like they're loving books.

896
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:24,340
It's a real book time.

897
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:25,900
Great time to read.

898
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:27,860
Do you know if the woman found Skull Island

899
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:30,180
in the continuity of those videos?

900
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:31,540
I only saw two clips.

901
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:35,380
I watched two episodes, and then it kind of cut off.

902
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:37,020
Oh, so maybe they didn't finish then earlier.

903
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:37,860
I don't know if they.

904
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:42,700
Well, the website mythexplorer.com is no longer active.

905
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:46,580
I think one, the Orlando Informer articles

906
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:49,020
about Kong Skull Island, I think they did redirect

907
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:51,780
their link to the archive.org page,

908
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:54,780
but it didn't seem like a ton was super functional there.

909
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:55,620
You know?

910
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:56,460
Okay.

911
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:57,300
So we'll never know.

912
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:58,140
Yeah.

913
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:00,780
Archive.org, the Skull Island of websites.

914
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:03,780
You gotta go on an expedition.

915
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:04,940
Might not ever come out.

916
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:08,500
Don't let your computer get a de Plector style bug.

917
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:11,020
Please be careful.

918
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:13,100
But yeah, I mean, generally you were,

919
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:14,420
and we'll go into details of it,

920
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:17,860
but generally you were trying to save this archeologist

921
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:19,860
and they're calling you back to the base camp.

922
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:20,940
No, it's not safe.

923
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:23,980
No, you gotta go save her, and thus you end up

924
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:26,900
in the jungle with a bunch of dinosaurs who are not,

925
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,940
we'll get into who they are,

926
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:31,660
but King Kong swoops in, saves the day,

927
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:33,740
and gives you a little moment where you worry

928
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:36,820
is gonna be bad news, but is more like,

929
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:38,860
remember, I'm the guy.

930
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:39,700
Yeah.

931
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:40,540
It's me.

932
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:41,380
Yeah, there's one king.

933
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:42,200
He kinda mad dogs you.

934
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:43,040
Yeah.

935
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:46,260
Yeah, he shows his authority.

936
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:47,180
Yeah.

937
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:48,020
Which is nice.

938
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:48,860
As you have to.

939
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:53,460
So, well, I mean, we could kinda,

940
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:55,660
look, we could talk about the queue.

941
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:56,500
We can.

942
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,220
It's a good queue.

943
00:34:58,220 --> 00:34:59,180
It's a good queue.

944
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,460
It's really good, yeah.

945
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:03,740
And it's got, yeah, it's got so much,

946
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:07,140
as we talked about a little, like a scare actor sometimes,

947
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:08,100
we think.

948
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:09,820
We're not sure of the schedule on that.

949
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:14,020
There's like, there's screen scare-ectors, essentially.

950
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:16,140
Like there is a, that's where I was like,

951
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:18,460
wow, this is pretty cool in here, where they kinda,

952
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:22,820
they kinda lure you into looking through this area

953
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:27,540
with some rocks, where there's some sparkly stuff going on.

954
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:30,740
So you crane your head, what's going on in here,

955
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:32,860
and then bah, guy jumps out at you,

956
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:37,620
who is very realistic and very bright in that way

957
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:39,260
that realistic screen people are,

958
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:41,820
but the brightness kinda adds to the,

959
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:42,660
the serenity.

960
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:44,600
You don't expect to see such a bright figure

961
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,100
poking out of those rocks.

962
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:48,900
That still is burned, and it did genuinely freak me out.

963
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:50,420
And I was like, well, this is, hey,

964
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:52,020
this is stuff that's only in this queue.

965
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:52,860
They gotcha.

966
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:55,420
Yeah, it's like we've heard,

967
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:58,020
we've heard tell over the years, like of those,

968
00:35:58,020 --> 00:36:00,940
the Haunted Mansion lore of when they would have

969
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:04,780
an actor in the ride or hanging out, you know, like the,

970
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:05,980
I guess it was a suit of armor.

971
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:09,220
There was, they supposedly had an actor

972
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:10,680
wearing the armor on the ride,

973
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:14,180
and the legend is like a person punched,

974
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:15,220
punched the person,

975
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:17,460
because they got their face into the car.

976
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:18,720
So I've heard of this, and then like,

977
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:21,300
Knott's used to do, at Scary Farm,

978
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:25,200
they would do scare-ectors on the log ride,

979
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:28,080
or maybe it was on the mine cart ride, I forget.

980
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:28,980
Maybe both.

981
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,440
It was the, I think it was the log ride,

982
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,440
because you are going pretty fast.

983
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:38,040
So there's not a ton of spots for them to pop out.

984
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:40,040
So it was a lot of the emergency exit.

985
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:40,880
Yeah, right, right, right.

986
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,840
They kind of knew it was coming,

987
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,960
because it would be dangerous to pop out

988
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,260
from anywhere else, you know?

989
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:47,760
Yeah, they haven't done that.

990
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,960
They haven't done those, they don't think the last couple,

991
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:52,220
well, not a couple, whatever, four or five years,

992
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:53,300
I feel like since we've gone,

993
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:56,500
I don't remember them having those scare-ectors on the ride.

994
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:58,500
But I've always been, I think as a kid even,

995
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:00,500
I was always kind of unsure of like,

996
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,900
oh, is there a real person here in these rides?

997
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:04,960
So this is like the first time,

998
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,580
I guess one of the most popular,

999
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:09,180
like a big Universal or Disney ride had a full scare-ector,

1000
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:10,620
correct me if I'm wrong,

1001
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:14,500
that's like regularly showing up in the ride experience.

1002
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:16,940
Yeah, well, don't forget the special treat

1003
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:20,660
that met some Disneyland guests every once in a while

1004
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:23,820
when Captain Jack himself.

1005
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:26,060
Oh, okay, well sure.

1006
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:27,220
But who?

1007
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:28,860
That's not quite what I'm saying.

1008
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:30,940
I don't even have the, I don't even want to.

1009
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:32,820
There's no stamina for you left in you

1010
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:34,420
to get to the end of that joke.

1011
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:36,660
Rather not say the name.

1012
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:37,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1013
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:39,580
Look it up yourself.

1014
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:42,060
So yeah, so this is cool,

1015
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:43,780
and as a kid this would have scared the shit out of me,

1016
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:45,100
and I wouldn't have wanted to go on it,

1017
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:45,940
because I would have been like,

1018
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:47,220
there's a person in that line?

1019
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:48,340
No way.

1020
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:50,700
I was terrified at the idea of real people

1021
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:52,300
in haunted houses as a kid,

1022
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:56,140
to the point of it was either in like Wildwood

1023
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:57,220
or Seaside Heights,

1024
00:37:57,220 --> 00:38:00,780
like we went to another town one night at the Jersey Shore

1025
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:02,220
that we didn't often go to,

1026
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:03,300
and there was a haunted house,

1027
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:05,940
and I was so excited because I loved the haunted mansion,

1028
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:07,540
but there were all these warning signs,

1029
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:08,740
that was very intense,

1030
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:11,420
and like we went up to the teen working,

1031
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:13,780
and was like, are there people in costumes in this?

1032
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:15,300
He's like, yeah, oh yeah, yeah.

1033
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:16,140
Yeah, yeah.

1034
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:18,300
And I was like, I'm not, no, I'm not doing this one.

1035
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:22,140
Early on, I remember the most like,

1036
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:26,180
rinky dink carnival haunted house around Halloween,

1037
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:28,580
and it was like, there was a sign outside

1038
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:30,820
that like explained kind of what it was,

1039
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:32,580
and I was like, no way,

1040
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:33,780
and I was like seven or eight,

1041
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:37,300
and then like that lasted up until, what, five years ago?

1042
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:38,740
Whenever I went to, whenever I started.

1043
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:39,580
Yeah.

1044
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:40,820
At least it ended at some point.

1045
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:43,860
Well, I mean, trick or treating in my neighborhood,

1046
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:47,540
there were parents or families who would go all out,

1047
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:49,940
and I remember a couple times,

1048
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:53,420
like dads, because some people would have like scarecrows,

1049
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:56,300
you know, on the front, like in a chair on the front yard,

1050
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:59,860
and then some people would dress like scarecrows,

1051
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:02,580
and sit in the thing, and then jump out at you

1052
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:04,860
when you reach for the candy bowl,

1053
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:07,980
and my dad always tells the story of like,

1054
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:10,900
there was one house, and we were pretty sure

1055
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:15,100
that like it was a person, not a scarecrow,

1056
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:16,860
but I went up and got candy,

1057
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:19,980
and said hi to like the people giving out the candy,

1058
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:23,340
and walked away, and so I didn't get caught,

1059
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:25,780
I didn't get, you know, they didn't jump out,

1060
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:30,380
and we turned to walk away, and my dad looks back,

1061
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:32,180
and the guy goes, hey Mike, hi,

1062
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:35,140
and like it was, but he saw me coming.

1063
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:35,980
Oh, so he didn't scare you.

1064
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:38,180
Terrified, so he did not do it.

1065
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:39,020
He went easy on you.

1066
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:39,860
He was like, cool dad.

1067
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:40,700
For old Jason.

1068
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:42,140
Oh wow, well that's nice.

1069
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:43,380
Yeah. Oh geez.

1070
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:44,860
Well, a candy bowl mix,

1071
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:46,540
I don't think I even said this,

1072
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:48,500
because I think I did this after we recorded

1073
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,100
our Halloween episode last year,

1074
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:53,740
or where I detailed my panic attack

1075
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:56,140
before going into an escape room with Eva,

1076
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:58,180
of course the Minotaur,

1077
00:39:58,180 --> 00:40:01,260
but I tried to get right back on the horse,

1078
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:05,500
like a week later, and went to a Zombie Joe show with Eva,

1079
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:07,100
which is just like a little mini maze,

1080
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:09,520
and then a weird show with a lot of nudity,

1081
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:13,420
because that's the thing over there.

1082
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:14,260
The club random.

1083
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:15,700
The club.

1084
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:16,540
Yeah.

1085
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:17,740
But they make a maze,

1086
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:20,460
they can make this very tight maze out of just like,

1087
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:23,260
I don't know, maybe I have told the story.

1088
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:25,900
They make just like, what am I thinking of?

1089
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:27,420
You put down like a tarp or something,

1090
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:30,700
they kind of make it in the lobby of this small theater.

1091
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:31,820
So like you really are like,

1092
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:33,620
say it's like as big as this garage,

1093
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:36,460
but they've put so much tarp and stuff around.

1094
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:38,060
They section it off to turn it into.

1095
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:39,220
Yeah, and it's like a maze,

1096
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:41,500
and you have to like go like really tightly in,

1097
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:43,700
and there's people in there yelling and screaming at you.

1098
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:45,700
And then at the very end,

1099
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:46,980
because you go one way,

1100
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:48,080
then you go into the theater,

1101
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:50,340
watch the show come out the other way,

1102
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:53,580
and it's a new maze with different characters

1103
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:54,620
on your way out.

1104
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:57,500
And in the very end, there's a candy bowl,

1105
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:59,620
and you go to reach for some candy,

1106
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:02,140
and of course it's a human being,

1107
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:05,780
and their head has got like a candy bowl thing

1108
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:06,740
is fixed to it.

1109
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:08,300
You're touching their, oh no, it's not.

1110
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:09,580
The candy isn't their face.

1111
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:10,980
Right, no, but it's like stuck on their head,

1112
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:12,980
and they're like in this like position,

1113
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:15,820
like as if there's some sort of stand

1114
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:17,300
for the candy bowl in them.

1115
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:18,140
That's great.

1116
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:18,960
So you reach in and you go, ah!

1117
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:23,140
It's really one last freak fright before.

1118
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:27,220
But I like that you're genuinely like,

1119
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:30,820
ah, I made it, ah, now to enjoy a piece of.

1120
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:31,660
I was disappointed,

1121
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:33,460
because I did reach in to get the candy.

1122
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:35,220
I was gonna say, they found the way to get you.

1123
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:36,580
Yeah, well. Every time.

1124
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:38,580
I wish the person saw me and was nice,

1125
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:40,660
like when Jason was little.

1126
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:42,220
Although there wasn't real candy either.

1127
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:43,460
I was disappointed to look like,

1128
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:45,380
I touched it and it was like fake.

1129
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:46,980
Like rubber and warm,

1130
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:48,140
because it was the person's head.

1131
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:51,420
So your scream was less scared and more.

1132
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:52,340
It's not candy!

1133
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:54,100
I wanted my full fat candy.

1134
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:56,620
I wanted full sugar candy.

1135
00:41:56,620 --> 00:41:57,460
Yeah.

1136
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:01,260
You know, I think this was Universal,

1137
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:05,300
Orlando's first thing with scare actors year round.

1138
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:08,620
But out here, there was the Universal House of Horrors.

1139
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:10,260
Yes, yes, yes, which I've talked about before.

1140
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:11,740
So, I mean, I guess that's different.

1141
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:13,380
That's like a full haunted house.

1142
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:14,220
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1143
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:15,060
You know, you're right.

1144
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:15,900
That's true.

1145
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:18,180
But yeah, it is also just a haunted house.

1146
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:19,020
Yeah.

1147
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:21,020
But as a kid, yeah, I think we share the same,

1148
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:23,140
like I hope there's not real people on this.

1149
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:24,940
Because as a kid, I think you would learn

1150
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:26,500
with Disney and Universal,

1151
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:28,820
that you could count on the rides

1152
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:31,300
to do what you knew they'd do.

1153
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:33,220
There was a safety in haunted mansion,

1154
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:35,260
because you knew it was gonna be the same thing every time.

1155
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:36,100
Yeah, yeah.

1156
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:38,100
The beach town where they were still giving out

1157
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:41,580
cartons of cigarettes at the carnival games.

1158
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:43,700
I knew was a little more chaotic.

1159
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:45,980
Yeah, so that was unpredictable.

1160
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:50,060
But the calmness that you could get from knowing

1161
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:53,900
that there were not random elements

1162
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:56,540
on the haunted mansion.

1163
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:57,380
Yeah.

1164
00:42:57,380 --> 00:42:58,900
That's why, you know, hey,

1165
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:00,820
that's why the haunted mansion stinks, right?

1166
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:02,860
You know exactly where it's going.

1167
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:03,700
Yeah.

1168
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:05,180
Not like a freewheeling conversation.

1169
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:06,220
That's right.

1170
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:08,580
Maybe we can talk about lib tears a little.

1171
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:09,540
That's right.

1172
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:12,980
So anyway, I mean, this queue is,

1173
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:14,220
it is really fantastic.

1174
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:16,300
The exterior is great.

1175
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:17,660
I feel like in general,

1176
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:19,580
what you can tell they're hitting over and over,

1177
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:21,780
is it is a screen-based ride,

1178
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:23,140
but it's a screen ride for people

1179
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:24,780
who don't like screen rides.

1180
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:27,780
Because that is the basis of it,

1181
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:29,700
but they're doing everything else

1182
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:30,820
that they can do to show you.

1183
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:32,460
Like this is a full experience

1184
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:34,900
that has a lot of dimensionality.

1185
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:37,500
Including right before you even get in there,

1186
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:38,740
the fact that you walk up

1187
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:41,260
and there is this exterior loop.

1188
00:43:41,260 --> 00:43:42,100
Yes.

1189
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:44,140
Where you watch the vehicle

1190
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:46,900
drive out of its boarding area,

1191
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:50,980
go up to the giant doors of the temple

1192
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:53,100
with huge flames shooting out of them.

1193
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:55,220
Like the scale of it is fantastic.

1194
00:43:55,220 --> 00:43:57,540
It's similar to, it's a little bit of that,

1195
00:43:57,540 --> 00:43:59,300
what's cool about Rise of the Resistance,

1196
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:02,540
where they carve out these exterior zones

1197
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:05,500
to be part of a mainly interior ride.

1198
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:06,500
Yeah.

1199
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:08,180
There's also a fail safe,

1200
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:11,820
where if it's lightning, if it's pouring rain,

1201
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:15,140
the car can skip that outdoor section

1202
00:44:15,140 --> 00:44:16,580
and continue to operate.

1203
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:18,060
Wow, wow.

1204
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:20,700
I'm not quite sure the mechanics of the shortcut.

1205
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:24,820
I couldn't, all the videos I tried to find on YouTube,

1206
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:28,700
like King Kong Rain, King Kong Shortcut.

1207
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:31,260
Like I did get a few, I was surprised.

1208
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:33,580
I did pick three random videos

1209
00:44:33,580 --> 00:44:36,860
and got three different tour guide characters.

1210
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:39,540
Yeah, I got a good mix of the guides.

1211
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:42,180
Which I think is another attention to detail

1212
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:44,420
that adds to this ride.

1213
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:46,380
Yeah, well we might as well dive into that.

1214
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:47,220
Sure.

1215
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:49,020
I mean, so King Kong does not reach his hand

1216
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:52,620
into a vehicle and pull out a nanometronic character.

1217
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:56,020
But on these vehicles, and by the way,

1218
00:44:56,020 --> 00:44:57,700
I bought all this hook line.

1219
00:44:57,700 --> 00:45:00,380
It never occurred to me that it was trackless.

1220
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:01,420
I figured this was like,

1221
00:45:01,420 --> 00:45:02,260
Yeah, I didn't know that.

1222
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:06,820
This was a real, like a vehicle with a motor

1223
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:08,660
that's driving you around.

1224
00:45:08,660 --> 00:45:11,820
And I thought the shape up front was a human being.

1225
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:13,820
So until we started prepping for this,

1226
00:45:13,820 --> 00:45:16,380
genuinely did not know that these are,

1227
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:19,140
there's nobody on them except for you, the guests.

1228
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:20,700
And that that figure up in the front

1229
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:22,260
is an animatronic driver.

1230
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:24,300
And I certainly did not know that there is a mix

1231
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:27,500
of five animatronic drivers

1232
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:29,940
that customize the experience.

1233
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:31,820
I didn't know that until now.

1234
00:45:31,820 --> 00:45:35,460
Yeah, I'm convinced, now while it's cool,

1235
00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:38,100
and I think everybody who finds this out thinks it's cool,

1236
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:40,660
it did occur to me, we might be the first people ever

1237
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:42,380
to have a conversation about it.

1238
00:45:42,380 --> 00:45:44,220
You know what I mean?

1239
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:45,700
Other than Universal Creative?

1240
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:47,860
We're gonna say these names, right?

1241
00:45:47,860 --> 00:45:50,660
Has anyone ever gone into this before?

1242
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:53,340
Oh, well, I think like we,

1243
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:56,820
there's a lot of websites when they, again,

1244
00:45:56,820 --> 00:45:57,660
Yeah, you know what I mean,

1245
00:45:57,660 --> 00:45:59,500
but that's like a press release being handed to them.

1246
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:00,340
Yeah, there's a press release.

1247
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:01,420
It was part of the press release.

1248
00:46:01,420 --> 00:46:02,260
Yeah, yes, clearly.

1249
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:04,300
It was part of like the full, the all hands media.

1250
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:08,900
The fandom of, there's no like Skull Island heads,

1251
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:10,220
Skull Island junkies.

1252
00:46:10,220 --> 00:46:11,820
You know, like a lot of things that we talk about

1253
00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:13,540
on this show, all of a sudden in a couple weeks,

1254
00:46:13,540 --> 00:46:16,980
stuff will start popping up and you go, did we do that?

1255
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:18,700
Maybe it's our egos talking,

1256
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:22,180
but I feel like maybe by just putting this into the world,

1257
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:25,100
you know, maybe we'll start to see the people

1258
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:28,340
will be stanning these characters, I don't know.

1259
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:32,780
I mean, there are a lot of archetypes you see in,

1260
00:46:32,780 --> 00:46:34,820
you know, adventure movies and stuff,

1261
00:46:34,820 --> 00:46:36,420
King Kong movies, of course.

1262
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:39,380
Should I just start?

1263
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:40,220
Yeah, sure, yeah.

1264
00:46:40,220 --> 00:46:43,340
Hopefully, and you're starting lineup of.

1265
00:46:43,340 --> 00:46:46,260
Becky Callahan, the loose cannon cowgirl

1266
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:50,140
who isn't fazed by the dangers awaiting her on Skull Island.

1267
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:51,740
Archetypes, loose cannon cowgirl.

1268
00:46:51,740 --> 00:46:53,300
Loose cannon cowgirl.

1269
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:54,940
Will Denham, the fresh face,

1270
00:46:54,940 --> 00:46:57,500
adventure seeking younger cousin,

1271
00:46:57,500 --> 00:47:00,260
famed movie director, Carl Denham.

1272
00:47:00,260 --> 00:47:04,140
Now, okay, this is the most interesting one to me.

1273
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:07,100
So to explain what's going on here,

1274
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:09,300
unless you're like, I know who Carl Denham is,

1275
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:10,220
I'm not an idiot.

1276
00:47:10,220 --> 00:47:14,580
So this is set in 1931, the Peter Jackson, King Kong,

1277
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:17,860
that Universal has done so many attractions about,

1278
00:47:17,860 --> 00:47:19,980
made the studio tour largely about,

1279
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:22,380
was from 2005, I think.

1280
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:26,260
Carl Denham is the filmmaker played by Jack Black,

1281
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:29,620
who goes to find King Kong,

1282
00:47:29,620 --> 00:47:32,340
and then make him do a meme show.

1283
00:47:32,340 --> 00:47:33,700
Yeah, yes.

1284
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:35,940
The one who calls him the eighth wonder of the world.

1285
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:36,780
Oh, okay.

1286
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:37,620
For the marketing.

1287
00:47:37,620 --> 00:47:41,300
Also the name of the character in the 1933 King Kong

1288
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:42,140
is Carl Denham.

1289
00:47:42,140 --> 00:47:43,060
Oh, okay, that is consistent.

1290
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:44,540
Okay, okay, cool.

1291
00:47:44,540 --> 00:47:47,700
So, and this is where, I think the fandom page

1292
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:49,740
started to get a little spicy of like,

1293
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:52,700
obviously, I mean, it's a nod to the movies,

1294
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:55,980
but it seems unlikely that this would be a full prequel

1295
00:47:55,980 --> 00:47:58,260
to that movie, because why would there have been

1296
00:47:58,260 --> 00:48:00,780
an expedition and then another expedition?

1297
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:05,180
Oh, right, because they're, yeah, it's unexplored.

1298
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:07,420
Yeah, yeah, if the guy's nephew has already been,

1299
00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:10,340
but they tried to make this all tie together,

1300
00:48:10,340 --> 00:48:14,820
and I watched a video where I did land on Will Denham,

1301
00:48:14,820 --> 00:48:16,740
so, and this is all just VO.

1302
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:19,260
There's kind of one big spot where the character

1303
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:22,260
gets to make their mark, and it is in that opening loop

1304
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:24,060
before the plot really kicks in,

1305
00:48:24,060 --> 00:48:26,940
but you get like one or two sentences to get to know

1306
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:28,740
your animatronic driver.

1307
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:30,580
It says his name, hey, I'm Will.

1308
00:48:30,580 --> 00:48:34,260
My uncle, Carl Denham, makes adventure movies.

1309
00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:36,340
That's what I wanna do someday.

1310
00:48:36,340 --> 00:48:39,020
I can't wait to tell him about this place.

1311
00:48:40,140 --> 00:48:43,220
You know the way you're always saying your uncle's name?

1312
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:44,540
Yeah, uh-huh.

1313
00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:47,060
Sure. Yeah.

1314
00:48:47,060 --> 00:48:49,380
My uncle, Robert Gardner,

1315
00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:52,700
pretty cantankerous.

1316
00:48:52,940 --> 00:48:57,940
I don't know what else I wanna say about my uncle.

1317
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:01,900
Yeah, it's a- But I said introduce it,

1318
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:03,300
now you know his name.

1319
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:05,060
Well, it is helpful that he speaks like that,

1320
00:49:05,060 --> 00:49:07,420
because we wouldn't know otherwise.

1321
00:49:07,420 --> 00:49:10,100
I just wanted to really quickly add that Carl Denham

1322
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:12,580
is a character that also appeared in the 1998

1323
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:16,060
The Mighty Kong animated movie, voiced by Dudley Moore.

1324
00:49:17,380 --> 00:49:19,860
Another actor who has played Carl Denham.

1325
00:49:20,740 --> 00:49:24,980
Someone mentioned, I think one of the universal

1326
00:49:24,980 --> 00:49:27,340
creative people was talking about like,

1327
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:31,980
yeah, we've seen Baby Boomers, we've seen Kong a lot.

1328
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:33,180
We know Kong.

1329
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:37,780
We saw the 1966 cartoon with Kong, and I was like,

1330
00:49:37,780 --> 00:49:38,620
did you?

1331
00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:40,420
I forgot about that.

1332
00:49:40,420 --> 00:49:41,260
I don't know.

1333
00:49:41,260 --> 00:49:42,100
There's a lot of Kong that I haven't seen.

1334
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:43,540
Yeah, there is a lot of Kong.

1335
00:49:43,540 --> 00:49:45,420
A lot of Kong, and a lot of Kong to go.

1336
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:47,180
We still have to talk about all these other-

1337
00:49:47,180 --> 00:49:49,100
Oh, there's prequels- Oh, there's more names.

1338
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:52,060
Oh yeah, yeah, we'll get to that real quick though.

1339
00:49:52,060 --> 00:49:55,340
I'll say that one of my memories of sitting next to

1340
00:49:55,340 --> 00:50:00,340
a certain tram tour once is just constantly saying,

1341
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:01,740
Skull Island.

1342
00:50:01,740 --> 00:50:02,580
Yeah.

1343
00:50:02,580 --> 00:50:03,420
Skull Island.

1344
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:04,500
We're going back.

1345
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:05,460
We're going back.

1346
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:08,780
Well, that's the truly, I mean, to compare and contrast

1347
00:50:08,780 --> 00:50:13,420
them, the context of that tram version,

1348
00:50:13,420 --> 00:50:18,060
and granted, it is the tram, so things on the tram

1349
00:50:18,060 --> 00:50:20,460
can happen in a way of, we're gonna go see a set,

1350
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:22,460
and then we'll see what happens on the set,

1351
00:50:22,460 --> 00:50:24,340
but they don't even really do that,

1352
00:50:24,340 --> 00:50:26,500
because you're just driving in,

1353
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:28,300
and Peter Jackson's talking to you,

1354
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:30,020
and we're gonna go back, we're going back,

1355
00:50:30,020 --> 00:50:33,900
and you go into a dark room, and then all of a sudden,

1356
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:35,860
lights turn on, and it's very impressive,

1357
00:50:35,860 --> 00:50:37,700
and the experience is impressive,

1358
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:40,180
but there really is something to building the story.

1359
00:50:40,180 --> 00:50:42,900
We are in 1931, we're fully committed.

1360
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:43,740
Yeah, for sure.

1361
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:44,580
The drivers of character.

1362
00:50:44,580 --> 00:50:47,300
There's the little set of Skull Island on the tram tour.

1363
00:50:47,340 --> 00:50:48,620
They're still doing that, right?

1364
00:50:48,620 --> 00:50:49,900
Oh, the bigature.

1365
00:50:49,900 --> 00:50:51,020
Yeah.

1366
00:50:51,020 --> 00:50:53,500
Because Peter Jackson, he wasn't happy

1367
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:55,460
just using a miniature.

1368
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:56,300
Of course.

1369
00:50:56,300 --> 00:50:59,380
He wanted to step it up, and that's why we deployed bigatures.

1370
00:50:59,380 --> 00:51:00,460
That's what we're about to see.

1371
00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:02,020
Get your camera, I remember him saying that,

1372
00:51:02,020 --> 00:51:05,580
like, get your cameras ready, you won't wanna miss this.

1373
00:51:05,580 --> 00:51:08,140
And then we would drive by quietly.

1374
00:51:08,140 --> 00:51:10,540
The parting of the Red Sea effect.

1375
00:51:10,540 --> 00:51:12,300
Yes, that became, yeah, yeah, yeah,

1376
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:13,740
part of the Universal Tram Tour,

1377
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:15,300
where you descend into a lake,

1378
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:18,380
and then come back up out of it, but they don't,

1379
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:20,260
wait, they brought it back when I was working there.

1380
00:51:20,260 --> 00:51:21,100
Initially, they were like,

1381
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:22,740
we're cutting the parting of the seas.

1382
00:51:22,740 --> 00:51:23,580
Oh, yeah.

1383
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:25,260
But then for a while, it was this awkward thing,

1384
00:51:25,260 --> 00:51:26,380
where you're talking about King Kong,

1385
00:51:26,380 --> 00:51:28,620
and then you have to go part the seas.

1386
00:51:28,620 --> 00:51:29,460
Right.

1387
00:51:29,460 --> 00:51:30,820
Okay, now we're gonna see a bigature.

1388
00:51:30,820 --> 00:51:33,900
So we're melding together, it's now the Ten Commandments,

1389
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:36,660
and it's the Bible.

1390
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:37,500
Yeah, yeah.

1391
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:39,700
Plus the 2005 King Kong.

1392
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:41,980
I mean, for a generation of filmmakers,

1393
00:51:41,980 --> 00:51:43,900
King Kong was kind of like the Bible.

1394
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:45,500
Well, that's a very good point.

1395
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:48,660
2005 one as well, of course.

1396
00:51:48,660 --> 00:51:51,820
As we've been told, again and again and again,

1397
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:53,740
pretty much since I've had memories,

1398
00:51:53,740 --> 00:51:57,180
I've been told about how important King Kong is.

1399
00:51:57,180 --> 00:51:58,900
Yeah, so it's funny,

1400
00:51:58,900 --> 00:52:00,500
because the movie Skull Island came out

1401
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:01,620
already five years ago,

1402
00:52:01,620 --> 00:52:04,380
but back then, they say Skull Island,

1403
00:52:04,380 --> 00:52:07,780
and that part of the Tram Tour so much.

1404
00:52:07,780 --> 00:52:08,620
Yeah.

1405
00:52:08,620 --> 00:52:11,540
And that wasn't on the tip of our tongues like it is now.

1406
00:52:11,540 --> 00:52:12,380
No.

1407
00:52:12,540 --> 00:52:15,460
The movie didn't really keep,

1408
00:52:15,460 --> 00:52:19,500
I find those things funny when Universal has so,

1409
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:21,940
just dug their claws into,

1410
00:52:21,940 --> 00:52:24,020
I mean, it sort of keeps happening.

1411
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:26,100
I mean, even Secret Life of Pets

1412
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:31,100
does not exactly reverberate across all of our,

1413
00:52:31,180 --> 00:52:33,260
how many of those characters can we name?

1414
00:52:33,260 --> 00:52:37,180
But I also, I appreciate the risk involved,

1415
00:52:37,180 --> 00:52:40,300
because it feels like Disney won't get out of bed,

1416
00:52:40,340 --> 00:52:42,540
they won't build something for a franchise

1417
00:52:42,540 --> 00:52:45,660
that made less than $5 billion.

1418
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:47,940
So I kind of like that Universal might,

1419
00:52:47,940 --> 00:52:50,740
we're probably close to getting a Beethoven dark ride.

1420
00:52:52,180 --> 00:52:53,540
They had it drafted up.

1421
00:52:54,540 --> 00:52:57,300
About from the old Beethoven, or is there a new Beethoven?

1422
00:52:57,300 --> 00:52:59,060
Well, the inevitable reboot.

1423
00:52:59,060 --> 00:52:59,900
Okay, yeah.

1424
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:01,100
Oh yeah.

1425
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:03,900
That feels like a Disney plus fodder, right?

1426
00:53:03,900 --> 00:53:05,740
Does Disney have Beethoven now?

1427
00:53:05,740 --> 00:53:06,620
I don't think they do.

1428
00:53:06,620 --> 00:53:08,220
Oh no, that's a pride of Universal.

1429
00:53:08,220 --> 00:53:09,060
That is Universal.

1430
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:09,900
Yeah, okay.

1431
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:11,900
Although it did have a strong, thank God.

1432
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:12,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1433
00:53:12,740 --> 00:53:13,580
It would have been so embarrassing.

1434
00:53:13,580 --> 00:53:15,820
Beethoven and Missy and all the pups,

1435
00:53:15,820 --> 00:53:17,540
I don't want them to be on Disney Plus,

1436
00:53:17,540 --> 00:53:20,140
I want them to be on which one?

1437
00:53:20,140 --> 00:53:20,980
On Peacock.

1438
00:53:20,980 --> 00:53:22,180
Wherever Universal movies go.

1439
00:53:22,180 --> 00:53:24,340
Yeah, Peacock, I guess. Peacock sometimes.

1440
00:53:24,340 --> 00:53:26,500
With Ambulance.

1441
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:28,340
Michael Bay. Ambulance.

1442
00:53:28,340 --> 00:53:30,380
Ambulance, LA-ance.

1443
00:53:30,380 --> 00:53:32,740
Ambulance, yes.

1444
00:53:32,740 --> 00:53:35,380
The exclusive home to Ambulance.

1445
00:53:35,380 --> 00:53:38,620
Ambulance, LA-ance, yeah, you have to stop the A

1446
00:53:38,620 --> 00:53:39,860
at the LA.

1447
00:53:40,860 --> 00:53:41,700
Okay, anyways.

1448
00:53:42,620 --> 00:53:44,420
Jason wants to say these names.

1449
00:53:44,420 --> 00:53:45,980
Oh no, well I was gonna say,

1450
00:53:45,980 --> 00:53:50,900
because King Kong, the Peter Jackson King Kong,

1451
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:54,580
a movie I liked fine, and I think made a lot of money,

1452
00:53:54,580 --> 00:53:57,140
and did well enough.

1453
00:53:57,140 --> 00:54:00,380
That is kind of an early example

1454
00:54:00,380 --> 00:54:02,460
of what feels so common nowadays,

1455
00:54:02,460 --> 00:54:05,780
where a thing is coming out and it's pushed on you,

1456
00:54:05,860 --> 00:54:08,620
it's pushed in a way,

1457
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:11,060
like Lightyear might be an example of this,

1458
00:54:11,060 --> 00:54:14,020
where it's pushed on you, on the audience.

1459
00:54:14,020 --> 00:54:16,700
You like this, and you like this.

1460
00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:19,140
This is a classic movie.

1461
00:54:19,140 --> 00:54:21,260
This new release is a classic movie.

1462
00:54:23,220 --> 00:54:25,620
They were trying to reverse engineer

1463
00:54:26,740 --> 00:54:31,140
a hit with long lasting repercussions.

1464
00:54:31,140 --> 00:54:32,660
It's too big to fail.

1465
00:54:32,660 --> 00:54:34,140
There's no way.

1466
00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:35,740
You don't have the option to not like.

1467
00:54:35,740 --> 00:54:37,860
Yeah, it's not like organic.

1468
00:54:37,860 --> 00:54:40,060
I feel like I'm wrong, the Kong, Peter Jackson movie,

1469
00:54:40,060 --> 00:54:42,580
which I do like in my memory of it,

1470
00:54:42,580 --> 00:54:44,220
but I feel like it wasn't as big of a hit

1471
00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:45,380
as they wanted it to be.

1472
00:54:45,380 --> 00:54:48,460
I think they wanted it to be like a Lord of the Rings hit.

1473
00:54:48,460 --> 00:54:49,780
Yeah, because they were coming off that.

1474
00:54:49,780 --> 00:54:50,620
So it was like, yeah.

1475
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:52,100
Wait, that was probably the bar for him.

1476
00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:52,940
Yeah, yeah.

1477
00:54:52,940 --> 00:54:53,780
So I think it was like,

1478
00:54:53,780 --> 00:54:56,020
because I think they would have done more than.

1479
00:54:56,020 --> 00:54:59,180
Surely this man can hit the lottery a fourth time.

1480
00:54:59,180 --> 00:55:00,500
Sure.

1481
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:02,700
Fair expectation to put on a man.

1482
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:04,060
Only Cameron can do it.

1483
00:55:04,980 --> 00:55:05,820
Only Jimmy Cameron can do it.

1484
00:55:05,820 --> 00:55:06,660
Yeah.

1485
00:55:06,660 --> 00:55:11,660
And it's pre like internet marketing or like.

1486
00:55:11,740 --> 00:55:14,940
Well, we've seen the failures of organic viral sensations

1487
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:18,020
with like the Morbius re-release just eating shit.

1488
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:19,820
It was very funny.

1489
00:55:19,820 --> 00:55:23,140
But if they had, they could have jumped on.

1490
00:55:23,140 --> 00:55:27,540
Everyone thought the commercial for this

1491
00:55:27,540 --> 00:55:29,980
where that takes place with Naomi Watts

1492
00:55:29,980 --> 00:55:32,060
and King Kong in Central Park

1493
00:55:32,060 --> 00:55:35,780
with a Coldplay song playing, that was very funny.

1494
00:55:35,780 --> 00:55:36,620
I don't remember that.

1495
00:55:36,620 --> 00:55:37,440
What song?

1496
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:39,140
I have zero recollection of that.

1497
00:55:39,140 --> 00:55:40,980
Do you remember what song it was?

1498
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:42,420
It was like Clocks.

1499
00:55:42,420 --> 00:55:43,780
It's King Kong the song.

1500
00:55:43,780 --> 00:55:44,620
King Kong.

1501
00:55:44,620 --> 00:55:46,500
It's a thing where they're looking at each other.

1502
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:47,340
Bing bong.

1503
00:55:47,340 --> 00:55:50,140
And it seems like it's romantic

1504
00:55:50,140 --> 00:55:52,620
with the Coldplay song playing.

1505
00:55:52,620 --> 00:55:54,380
Okay, is it Fix You?

1506
00:55:54,380 --> 00:55:56,900
I think it's, I think it might be Fix You.

1507
00:55:56,900 --> 00:55:58,740
She's trying to get them to calm down.

1508
00:55:58,740 --> 00:56:00,700
Well, you already have too many dangling plot threads

1509
00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:01,540
on podcast, right?

1510
00:56:01,540 --> 00:56:05,140
I will say I'm sort of a Coldplay defender.

1511
00:56:05,140 --> 00:56:05,980
I will say that.

1512
00:56:05,980 --> 00:56:06,820
Yeah, I like Coldplay.

1513
00:56:06,820 --> 00:56:08,020
That adds up.

1514
00:56:08,020 --> 00:56:09,420
Rush of Blood to the head.

1515
00:56:09,420 --> 00:56:11,220
Based on what has come up before.

1516
00:56:11,220 --> 00:56:12,060
Not shocking.

1517
00:56:12,060 --> 00:56:13,020
I don't mind Coldplay.

1518
00:56:13,020 --> 00:56:13,860
Clocks?

1519
00:56:13,860 --> 00:56:14,700
Yeah.

1520
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:15,940
Clocks, okay, yeah.

1521
00:56:15,940 --> 00:56:18,660
I feel like that third album, what is that called?

1522
00:56:18,660 --> 00:56:21,180
I, you know what I do like, I still like, what's the song?

1523
00:56:21,180 --> 00:56:24,620
What's the, oh shoot, what's the real poppy song that I-

1524
00:56:24,620 --> 00:56:25,860
Jason, say some facts quick.

1525
00:56:25,860 --> 00:56:26,700
I don't know.

1526
00:56:26,700 --> 00:56:27,540
Get us off here.

1527
00:56:27,540 --> 00:56:29,380
Okay, they have this music video

1528
00:56:29,380 --> 00:56:31,620
where a bunch of monkeys dance on an island.

1529
00:56:31,620 --> 00:56:33,260
Oh damn, that's related, okay.

1530
00:56:33,260 --> 00:56:34,100
Monkeys, yeah.

1531
00:56:34,100 --> 00:56:36,380
Yeah, like King Kong.

1532
00:56:36,380 --> 00:56:37,380
Do you guys know, by the way,

1533
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:40,740
the story that Naomi Watts tells about David Lynch?

1534
00:56:40,740 --> 00:56:43,140
Like she was, she had done 21 Grams,

1535
00:56:43,140 --> 00:56:44,300
she had done Mulholland Drive,

1536
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:47,380
and she was weighing whether to do King Kong or not.

1537
00:56:47,380 --> 00:56:52,380
So she asked David Lynch whether she should do it.

1538
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:55,380
Naomi Watts says, I remember calling up David Lynch,

1539
00:56:55,380 --> 00:56:57,940
who's my mentor, and he said to me,

1540
00:56:57,940 --> 00:56:59,100
and I've heard her tell this story

1541
00:56:59,100 --> 00:57:01,140
where she does the voice, so I'm gonna do the voice.

1542
00:57:01,140 --> 00:57:05,300
Naomi, anyone who sits in the hand of King Kong

1543
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:07,340
is a movie star for life.

1544
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:12,100
And he wasn't wrong, she's gone on to great success.

1545
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:13,300
All because of Kong.

1546
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:14,420
Jessica Lange.

1547
00:57:14,420 --> 00:57:15,260
Jessica Lange?

1548
00:57:15,260 --> 00:57:17,620
I don't know if Linda Hamilton sits in his hand

1549
00:57:17,620 --> 00:57:19,620
in the bad one that she's in,

1550
00:57:19,620 --> 00:57:21,300
but she was a movie star.

1551
00:57:21,300 --> 00:57:23,380
Is that the, do you know De Laurentiis,

1552
00:57:23,380 --> 00:57:25,340
like had to make a sequel?

1553
00:57:25,340 --> 00:57:26,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1554
00:57:26,180 --> 00:57:27,020
One, yeah, okay.

1555
00:57:27,180 --> 00:57:29,860
Where he eats like a bunch of crocodiles

1556
00:57:29,860 --> 00:57:31,860
and then dangles their bones around.

1557
00:57:34,260 --> 00:57:36,820
Oh, I think the main,

1558
00:57:38,940 --> 00:57:41,020
Jodie Benson, I think, is the voice of the character

1559
00:57:41,020 --> 00:57:43,740
in the Mighty Kong, the Judley Moore.

1560
00:57:43,740 --> 00:57:45,060
Movie star for life.

1561
00:57:45,060 --> 00:57:46,900
So this is already 1998.

1562
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:49,820
Toy Story, yeah, yeah, I guess it's true.

1563
00:57:49,820 --> 00:57:51,900
It's true, David is right.

1564
00:57:51,900 --> 00:57:53,380
Think about Jodie.

1565
00:57:53,380 --> 00:57:55,580
Yeah, of all the Kong movies,

1566
00:57:55,580 --> 00:57:58,820
and I really, we should have researched this before,

1567
00:57:58,820 --> 00:58:01,180
which one is the weirdest in regards to the romance

1568
00:58:01,180 --> 00:58:02,620
between Kong and the woman?

1569
00:58:03,700 --> 00:58:04,580
That's my question.

1570
00:58:04,580 --> 00:58:08,540
I don't know the answer, but I pose it to the listener.

1571
00:58:08,540 --> 00:58:10,780
Well, I think in King Kong Live is my favorite.

1572
00:58:10,780 --> 00:58:13,020
It's a romance with another Kong.

1573
00:58:13,020 --> 00:58:14,380
Yeah, well that, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1574
00:58:14,380 --> 00:58:15,780
Well, that's good, that's appropriate.

1575
00:58:15,780 --> 00:58:17,100
Yeah, yeah, finally.

1576
00:58:17,100 --> 00:58:17,940
Yeah.

1577
00:58:17,940 --> 00:58:19,780
Yeah, they fixed that.

1578
00:58:19,780 --> 00:58:22,940
Like we finally, we got that one part out of it.

1579
00:58:22,940 --> 00:58:26,380
So this King Kong will finally be the most successful

1580
00:58:26,380 --> 00:58:29,020
ever made, certainly not a thing that no one remembers

1581
00:58:29,020 --> 00:58:31,500
except for Scott when Scott brings it up

1582
00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:32,740
every two and a half years.

1583
00:58:32,740 --> 00:58:34,340
The thing is though, people don't want that.

1584
00:58:34,340 --> 00:58:37,540
They learned that people want a giant gorilla

1585
00:58:37,540 --> 00:58:40,460
and a woman to be falling in love.

1586
00:58:40,460 --> 00:58:41,940
That's what they want.

1587
00:58:41,940 --> 00:58:44,420
That movie, that 86 one, I just saw.

1588
00:58:44,420 --> 00:58:45,980
That's the heart one?

1589
00:58:45,980 --> 00:58:47,460
Yeah, yeah, that's what the heart transplant.

1590
00:58:47,460 --> 00:58:50,580
Yeah, I saw a clip of Siskel and Ebert talking about it,

1591
00:58:50,580 --> 00:58:52,140
and they were like, this is the part of the show

1592
00:58:52,140 --> 00:58:55,300
where we normally show a clip, but we don't have one.

1593
00:58:55,300 --> 00:58:57,860
Because the studio said, we'll let you play a clip

1594
00:58:57,860 --> 00:59:01,100
on your local show in Chicago, but not the national.

1595
00:59:01,100 --> 00:59:03,900
And they said, no dice, if this movie,

1596
00:59:03,900 --> 00:59:06,020
if you want us to sell your movie,

1597
00:59:06,020 --> 00:59:08,860
why wouldn't you send us a clip for us to show everywhere?

1598
00:59:08,860 --> 00:59:10,820
Is it not good or something?

1599
00:59:10,820 --> 00:59:14,500
And then it went to shit, and then they just yelled at it

1600
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:16,700
on their show without a clip.

1601
00:59:16,700 --> 00:59:19,140
See now, now here, now as far as YouTube rabbit holes,

1602
00:59:19,140 --> 00:59:21,020
I've been watching a lot of Siskel and Ebert lately.

1603
00:59:21,020 --> 00:59:22,020
That's a good rabbit hole.

1604
00:59:22,020 --> 00:59:22,860
Yeah, yeah.

1605
00:59:22,860 --> 00:59:24,980
Yeah, that's healing.

1606
00:59:24,980 --> 00:59:27,100
It's healing the gray matter in your brain.

1607
00:59:28,220 --> 00:59:31,260
Ebert, dead wrong about kids in the hall brain candy.

1608
00:59:31,260 --> 00:59:32,100
Oh yeah, yeah.

1609
00:59:32,100 --> 00:59:33,340
Was up his butt that day.

1610
00:59:33,340 --> 00:59:35,940
Ebert has a few big misses.

1611
00:59:35,940 --> 00:59:36,780
Yeah, he's usually.

1612
00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:39,620
He did Wet Hot American Summer wrong, incorrect.

1613
00:59:39,620 --> 00:59:40,460
Oh yeah.

1614
00:59:40,460 --> 00:59:41,300
He just didn't get it.

1615
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:42,300
You can tell he just didn't understand

1616
00:59:42,300 --> 00:59:43,660
what I'm trying to be.

1617
00:59:43,660 --> 00:59:45,700
Yeah, I feel like he's more right than he's wrong,

1618
00:59:45,700 --> 00:59:48,100
but yeah, he has some big ones where he's wrong.

1619
00:59:49,100 --> 00:59:52,220
But yeah, you can't bat a thousand.

1620
00:59:52,220 --> 00:59:53,180
Except for us.

1621
00:59:53,180 --> 00:59:54,340
Except for us in our opinion.

1622
00:59:54,340 --> 00:59:55,460
Every opinion right.

1623
00:59:55,460 --> 00:59:56,460
Every take. Transformers.

1624
00:59:56,460 --> 00:59:57,300
Correct, celebrated.

1625
00:59:57,300 --> 00:59:58,860
Transformers better than Rize.

1626
00:59:58,860 --> 01:00:02,140
Unlike the folly prone Jinx Costanza.

1627
01:00:03,460 --> 01:00:04,300
Jinx Costanza.

1628
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:05,220
Jinx Costanza.

1629
01:00:05,220 --> 01:00:08,260
Frank, his name is revealed as Frank later on.

1630
01:00:08,260 --> 01:00:10,340
But Frank Costanza. Frank Costanza.

1631
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:11,180
Frank Costanza.

1632
01:00:11,180 --> 01:00:12,260
Is Jerry Stiller.

1633
01:00:12,260 --> 01:00:13,100
Yes.

1634
01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:13,940
On Seinfeld.

1635
01:00:13,940 --> 01:00:16,500
Is that, so it's Jerry Stiller of a con connection.

1636
01:00:17,420 --> 01:00:20,060
Is that, do you think that's a nod?

1637
01:00:20,060 --> 01:00:21,380
Does he fall in love with that con?

1638
01:00:21,380 --> 01:00:22,500
It has to be a nod.

1639
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:24,580
Also, somebody in the building must have said,

1640
01:00:24,580 --> 01:00:26,100
hey, that's the name.

1641
01:00:26,100 --> 01:00:27,460
Yeah.

1642
01:00:27,460 --> 01:00:29,060
Yeah, cause that's weird.

1643
01:00:29,060 --> 01:00:30,740
You can't just take that name.

1644
01:00:30,740 --> 01:00:32,740
That's one of the great characters.

1645
01:00:32,740 --> 01:00:34,780
It's kind of not said together.

1646
01:00:34,780 --> 01:00:36,780
Hardin New York City ex-con,

1647
01:00:36,780 --> 01:00:39,340
it was wary of the island's mysteries.

1648
01:00:39,340 --> 01:00:41,980
And they say he's prone to like, you know,

1649
01:00:41,980 --> 01:00:45,140
my name's Jinx cause I find myself in scraps a lot.

1650
01:00:46,660 --> 01:00:48,380
You think he said what I wrote it that,

1651
01:00:48,380 --> 01:00:51,540
most people just call me Jinx and the voice is like this.

1652
01:00:51,540 --> 01:00:53,940
Cause I've had my share of bum luck.

1653
01:00:53,940 --> 01:00:54,780
Bum luck.

1654
01:00:54,780 --> 01:00:57,500
Before you ask, yeah, I heard about it,

1655
01:00:57,500 --> 01:00:59,780
but I ain't seen no giant ape.

1656
01:00:59,780 --> 01:01:01,260
Let's keep it that way.

1657
01:01:02,380 --> 01:01:03,820
Like he's threatening him.

1658
01:01:03,820 --> 01:01:04,660
Yeah.

1659
01:01:04,660 --> 01:01:05,500
Yeah, whatever.

1660
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:06,340
Couldn't they have just gotten,

1661
01:01:06,340 --> 01:01:08,940
they should have gotten Jerry Stiller to do it.

1662
01:01:08,940 --> 01:01:09,780
He may as well.

1663
01:01:09,780 --> 01:01:10,600
Yeah.

1664
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:11,440
I guess he was still, yeah.

1665
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:13,620
There's a big monkey.

1666
01:01:13,620 --> 01:01:14,660
I can't do Jerry, sorry.

1667
01:01:14,660 --> 01:01:16,300
I mean, it would have been,

1668
01:01:17,140 --> 01:01:19,020
like what a thrilling cameo you get on.

1669
01:01:19,020 --> 01:01:19,860
Oh my God.

1670
01:01:19,860 --> 01:01:22,620
Oh, this is like, well the character they own, you know.

1671
01:01:22,620 --> 01:01:24,220
Wait, no, no, they don't know the knife.

1672
01:01:24,220 --> 01:01:26,060
No, the knife broke away.

1673
01:01:26,060 --> 01:01:27,260
Yeah. Yeah.

1674
01:01:27,260 --> 01:01:28,460
And we're careful about it.

1675
01:01:28,460 --> 01:01:29,780
Broke out like Kong.

1676
01:01:29,780 --> 01:01:32,180
Yeah, you can still get Jerry though.

1677
01:01:32,180 --> 01:01:34,540
And you can like wink, wink, play the character.

1678
01:01:34,540 --> 01:01:35,380
Yep.

1679
01:01:35,380 --> 01:01:37,740
Anymore deadly games got him.

1680
01:01:37,740 --> 01:01:38,900
This ride did not.

1681
01:01:38,900 --> 01:01:40,380
It's too bad.

1682
01:01:40,380 --> 01:01:41,700
The final two.

1683
01:01:41,700 --> 01:01:44,660
Kalana, a mystical descendant of the natives

1684
01:01:44,660 --> 01:01:46,900
who first settled on the island.

1685
01:01:46,900 --> 01:01:50,580
The video where Kalana is narrating

1686
01:01:50,580 --> 01:01:53,340
immediately goes, my people worship Kong.

1687
01:01:53,340 --> 01:01:56,580
Like, I feel like that,

1688
01:01:56,580 --> 01:01:58,820
as soon as you were pulling away,

1689
01:01:58,820 --> 01:02:01,200
it's like gonna be straight with you.

1690
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:03,980
So we're gonna go see my god.

1691
01:02:03,980 --> 01:02:06,740
I'm pretty excited because we're gonna meet God today.

1692
01:02:06,740 --> 01:02:08,180
Yeah.

1693
01:02:08,180 --> 01:02:12,500
Charles Doc Jordan, a PhD student in paleontology

1694
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:16,100
who took time off from his studies to explore the world.

1695
01:02:16,100 --> 01:02:17,500
I don't know if you could take time off.

1696
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:21,100
I mean, you could probably finagle some credit hours

1697
01:02:21,100 --> 01:02:24,980
to exploring the world for paleontology.

1698
01:02:24,980 --> 01:02:25,940
Still applies.

1699
01:02:25,940 --> 01:02:26,780
Yeah.

1700
01:02:26,780 --> 01:02:27,620
I think so.

1701
01:02:27,620 --> 01:02:28,660
They should have overlapped him.

1702
01:02:28,660 --> 01:02:29,500
But he got the PhD.

1703
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:31,180
Especially if you're hanging out

1704
01:02:31,180 --> 01:02:35,900
doing on location studies at Skull Island.

1705
01:02:35,900 --> 01:02:38,020
Part of Skull Island study abroad program.

1706
01:02:38,020 --> 01:02:38,860
Yeah.

1707
01:02:39,820 --> 01:02:43,540
There's only about a 10% return rate.

1708
01:02:43,540 --> 01:02:44,380
Yeah.

1709
01:02:44,380 --> 01:02:46,260
You know, you're getting into it a lot.

1710
01:02:46,260 --> 01:02:50,900
The least they could get is like six credits, you know?

1711
01:02:50,900 --> 01:02:54,420
They try to send your bones back to your parents

1712
01:02:54,420 --> 01:02:57,140
if they are not mangled.

1713
01:02:57,140 --> 01:02:58,900
It's too thoroughly.

1714
01:02:58,900 --> 01:02:59,740
I would have gone to Skull.

1715
01:02:59,740 --> 01:03:00,580
No, I wouldn't.

1716
01:03:00,580 --> 01:03:01,400
That's too scary.

1717
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:02,240
My mom would not allow.

1718
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:04,220
It's pretty bad.

1719
01:03:04,220 --> 01:03:08,220
You know, you get any of these drivers pull you in.

1720
01:03:08,220 --> 01:03:12,220
I like that they customize it to where the archeologist,

1721
01:03:12,220 --> 01:03:15,660
Kate, says the name of all of these.

1722
01:03:15,660 --> 01:03:18,300
But like they change that dialogue.

1723
01:03:18,300 --> 01:03:21,460
So, you know, she'll say hey to jinx.

1724
01:03:21,460 --> 01:03:23,260
Are you talking about Kate McCaffrey?

1725
01:03:23,260 --> 01:03:24,940
Kate McCaffrey.

1726
01:03:24,940 --> 01:03:25,780
I guess I am.

1727
01:03:25,780 --> 01:03:27,100
Just make sure there wasn't another Kate.

1728
01:03:27,100 --> 01:03:28,100
No, no, no.

1729
01:03:28,100 --> 01:03:30,500
It's archeologist Kate McCaffrey.

1730
01:03:32,220 --> 01:03:36,300
But the way their little adventure starts

1731
01:03:36,300 --> 01:03:38,940
where she just gets kind of pleasantries.

1732
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:39,860
Like, oh, hey, what's up?

1733
01:03:39,860 --> 01:03:42,020
Hey, all right, well, we're gonna go back to the base camp.

1734
01:03:42,020 --> 01:03:44,940
And then I forget why the guy,

1735
01:03:44,940 --> 01:03:47,060
they're trying to get more light on something.

1736
01:03:47,060 --> 01:03:50,500
And then I think Joe is the guy that she's with

1737
01:03:50,500 --> 01:03:52,460
who just says, here, I got it.

1738
01:03:52,460 --> 01:03:54,200
And then fires a couple of flares

1739
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:58,740
and instantly a bunch of not bats, not bats.

1740
01:03:58,740 --> 01:03:59,580
No, no.

1741
01:03:59,580 --> 01:04:04,380
It's a bunch of, god damn it, terrapas mordaxes.

1742
01:04:04,380 --> 01:04:05,420
But it's just a flood.

1743
01:04:06,060 --> 01:04:08,140
It's the dumbest move in history.

1744
01:04:08,140 --> 01:04:10,520
You're all lighted up, bang, bang,

1745
01:04:10,520 --> 01:04:14,060
terrapas mordax swarm instantly.

1746
01:04:14,060 --> 01:04:18,900
He gets picked up by one, starts to carry him away.

1747
01:04:18,900 --> 01:04:21,500
She reaches up, pulls him down.

1748
01:04:21,500 --> 01:04:24,340
Then she gets picked up and he makes no effort to save her.

1749
01:04:24,340 --> 01:04:25,180
No.

1750
01:04:25,180 --> 01:04:26,980
He gets in a van and gets out of there.

1751
01:04:26,980 --> 01:04:28,480
What a coward.

1752
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:30,340
Yeah, Joe sucks.

1753
01:04:30,340 --> 01:04:31,360
Fuck you, Joe.

1754
01:04:31,360 --> 01:04:33,820
You should really be encouraged to get back

1755
01:04:33,820 --> 01:04:35,700
to where everyone survived, spoiler.

1756
01:04:35,700 --> 01:04:39,020
Even Kate made it despite a lot of monster encounters.

1757
01:04:39,020 --> 01:04:41,140
You should really boo Joe.

1758
01:04:41,140 --> 01:04:44,100
Yeah, Joe should be, or Kong should eat Joe.

1759
01:04:44,100 --> 01:04:44,940
Yes.

1760
01:04:44,940 --> 01:04:45,780
Just at the end.

1761
01:04:45,780 --> 01:04:49,060
Yeah, should get punished for what they, you know.

1762
01:04:49,060 --> 01:04:52,180
Like that Jurassic World babysitter got punished

1763
01:04:52,180 --> 01:04:54,540
for slightly poor babysitting.

1764
01:04:54,540 --> 01:04:56,980
He should at least put him in his mouth for a while.

1765
01:04:56,980 --> 01:04:58,060
Give him a good scare.

1766
01:04:58,060 --> 01:04:58,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1767
01:04:58,900 --> 01:05:01,900
Give him a stench he can't wash off for a couple weeks.

1768
01:05:01,940 --> 01:05:05,740
Roll him around on his tongue with a closed Kong mouth.

1769
01:05:05,740 --> 01:05:09,180
Like how far back in the throat can he get Joe

1770
01:05:09,180 --> 01:05:10,820
without fully swallowing him?

1771
01:05:10,820 --> 01:05:13,100
Like really make him see some shit.

1772
01:05:13,100 --> 01:05:15,100
What, he could get him down.

1773
01:05:15,100 --> 01:05:17,060
Okay, would Kong's stomach acid

1774
01:05:17,060 --> 01:05:18,980
immediately dissolve Joe's skin

1775
01:05:18,980 --> 01:05:20,820
or could he hit the stomach acid

1776
01:05:20,820 --> 01:05:22,780
and Kong could put his fingers down his throat

1777
01:05:22,780 --> 01:05:25,820
to make himself vomit again and puke Joe back up?

1778
01:05:25,820 --> 01:05:29,020
If he's got flares, he could maybe like electrify

1779
01:05:29,020 --> 01:05:30,900
the stomach acid.

1780
01:05:30,900 --> 01:05:32,980
Maybe there's like a Diet Coke Mentos effect.

1781
01:05:32,980 --> 01:05:33,820
Oh, maybe.

1782
01:05:33,820 --> 01:05:34,660
Oh yeah.

1783
01:05:34,660 --> 01:05:37,460
And then he flies up on flares right out of the,

1784
01:05:37,460 --> 01:05:39,500
which then makes King Kong cough

1785
01:05:39,500 --> 01:05:41,580
and spits him right back out to safety.

1786
01:05:41,580 --> 01:05:42,900
Okay, yeah, that would work perfectly

1787
01:05:42,900 --> 01:05:45,500
as long as the acid isn't too strong

1788
01:05:45,500 --> 01:05:49,180
to completely immediately like destroy him.

1789
01:05:49,180 --> 01:05:51,420
It's a quick, yeah, is King Kong's stomach acid

1790
01:05:51,420 --> 01:05:54,700
stronger than ours or is that part about him

1791
01:05:54,700 --> 01:05:57,740
not particularly notable?

1792
01:05:57,740 --> 01:05:58,580
That's a good question.

1793
01:05:58,580 --> 01:05:59,400
Or powerful.

1794
01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:00,240
I don't know if they address that

1795
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:01,080
in any of the Kong movies.

1796
01:06:01,080 --> 01:06:02,720
Jason literally looked at his watch.

1797
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:03,560
Huh?

1798
01:06:05,560 --> 01:06:06,640
You checked your watch?

1799
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:07,840
Oh, it's just a habit.

1800
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:09,520
I have the tick I have.

1801
01:06:10,560 --> 01:06:13,120
Well, no, that's a good indicator for the listener.

1802
01:06:13,120 --> 01:06:16,120
I was trying to go like how long have we been going?

1803
01:06:16,120 --> 01:06:16,960
Try to remember.

1804
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:20,200
Something about that made you start thinking about the time.

1805
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:21,040
Hey, it's a good indicator.

1806
01:06:21,040 --> 01:06:22,280
I look at my watch all the time when I record.

1807
01:06:22,280 --> 01:06:23,280
It's a good indicator.

1808
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:24,120
Oh, you do?

1809
01:06:24,120 --> 01:06:25,080
Yeah.

1810
01:06:25,080 --> 01:06:28,040
Every now and then I often don't remember when we started

1811
01:06:28,040 --> 01:06:30,680
so it's a useless gesture.

1812
01:06:30,680 --> 01:06:32,960
Okay, well, we got time for about two and a half more hours,

1813
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:33,800
right?

1814
01:06:33,800 --> 01:06:34,620
Yeah, sure.

1815
01:06:34,620 --> 01:06:36,320
Two and a half more hours about Kong's stomach acid.

1816
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:37,160
Yeah, yeah.

1817
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:38,000
That's what I want to talk about.

1818
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:39,680
Then we'll get, and then we'll wrap up.

1819
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:40,560
So Joe should get punished.

1820
01:06:40,560 --> 01:06:42,200
He doesn't get punished.

1821
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:43,640
He doesn't get punished.

1822
01:06:43,640 --> 01:06:46,920
She gets picked up and then kind of hacks her way free.

1823
01:06:48,360 --> 01:06:50,280
And then starts blasting everyone.

1824
01:06:50,280 --> 01:06:51,800
Bugs up, yeah.

1825
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:55,400
And those are the carnictises, the carnicti,

1826
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:57,360
and they give you a splash out of those.

1827
01:06:57,360 --> 01:07:00,120
You get that, you get your universal trademark,

1828
01:07:00,120 --> 01:07:02,280
which I've come around to now,

1829
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:04,760
because we've said before, oh, universal, same old trick.

1830
01:07:04,760 --> 01:07:07,040
No, I think that's now, that's the trademark.

1831
01:07:07,040 --> 01:07:09,160
That's the director cameo in their work.

1832
01:07:09,160 --> 01:07:10,280
They wrote it out.

1833
01:07:10,280 --> 01:07:12,160
It's like the Tarantino foot shots.

1834
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:13,000
Exactly.

1835
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:13,820
We know you're getting them.

1836
01:07:13,820 --> 01:07:15,080
So buckle up.

1837
01:07:15,080 --> 01:07:17,280
How good are they gonna be?

1838
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:19,200
The little splashes you get at universal.

1839
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:20,040
So yes, I like these.

1840
01:07:20,040 --> 01:07:21,400
They're good in this, and you know what?

1841
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:24,440
It's good atmosphere throughout too.

1842
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:26,000
Good reminder of Doug Jones' rule

1843
01:07:26,040 --> 01:07:27,840
that watching a video is not going on it,

1844
01:07:27,840 --> 01:07:30,880
because a lot of my memory of it is atmosphere.

1845
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:33,880
It's like there's temperature changes and wind blasts.

1846
01:07:33,880 --> 01:07:36,600
Like there's a feeling to these rooms.

1847
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:37,720
Yeah. Yeah.

1848
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:38,960
That's true.

1849
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:42,280
So yeah, they are doing all of that extra stuff

1850
01:07:42,280 --> 01:07:44,680
that the tram tour obviously doesn't have room to do.

1851
01:07:44,680 --> 01:07:47,040
You get a splash on there, but it's a little more,

1852
01:07:47,040 --> 01:07:49,880
and it's less clever, I would say,

1853
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:54,400
than feeling the innards of a big slug.

1854
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:55,240
Yeah.

1855
01:07:55,240 --> 01:07:56,080
It's like, this is so insane,

1856
01:07:56,080 --> 01:07:58,920
where there's mouths within mouths within mouths.

1857
01:07:58,920 --> 01:08:01,840
Oh yeah, there's a very, it's a really gross,

1858
01:08:01,840 --> 01:08:05,400
are we talking about, what's the phallic looking thing?

1859
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:06,240
Yeah.

1860
01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:08,080
Yeah, it is flesh, it is human flesh.

1861
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:09,840
It's really phallic, and it's not, again,

1862
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:12,240
it's not my twisted, dirty mind

1863
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:14,160
that everyone talks about from the show.

1864
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:15,000
It's not that.

1865
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:18,320
It looks like a giant penis with teeth.

1866
01:08:18,320 --> 01:08:21,120
Yeah, a pretty flaccid penis.

1867
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:21,960
Sure.

1868
01:08:21,960 --> 01:08:25,000
Yeah, I'm not commenting on the flaccidity.

1869
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:26,840
Probably.

1870
01:08:26,840 --> 01:08:27,680
Probably.

1871
01:08:27,680 --> 01:08:29,600
But yeah, no, that's very,

1872
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:32,320
I did not remember it from riding,

1873
01:08:32,320 --> 01:08:33,480
but when I was watching the video,

1874
01:08:33,480 --> 01:08:34,920
I went, oh, that's a big penis.

1875
01:08:34,920 --> 01:08:39,920
And you see one of those big penises in the queue, too.

1876
01:08:40,160 --> 01:08:41,560
Which really wakes up, apparently,

1877
01:08:41,560 --> 01:08:43,360
that thing really comes to life.

1878
01:08:43,360 --> 01:08:46,680
Yeah, that's just, there's an animatronic of that.

1879
01:08:46,680 --> 01:08:49,080
There's animatronics at the very start

1880
01:08:49,080 --> 01:08:50,800
of the ride of the firmus.

1881
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:53,720
Got it.

1882
01:08:56,040 --> 01:08:58,160
Yeah, of course, there's the big guy at the end.

1883
01:08:58,160 --> 01:08:59,240
I think the cave stuff,

1884
01:08:59,240 --> 01:09:02,600
the cave stuff filmed for this ride, too.

1885
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:03,920
I have to say, I-

1886
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:05,680
Everything till the main event.

1887
01:09:05,680 --> 01:09:06,520
Yeah.

1888
01:09:06,520 --> 01:09:07,680
You see it like two big,

1889
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:10,040
wait, am I missing one?

1890
01:09:10,040 --> 01:09:10,880
Is there more than one?

1891
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:15,960
Or like two big film screen sequences before the big show.

1892
01:09:15,960 --> 01:09:18,040
Yeah, I think that's right.

1893
01:09:18,040 --> 01:09:20,320
I remember thinking there were a ton of scenes

1894
01:09:20,320 --> 01:09:22,400
when I rode it the first time, too.

1895
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:23,240
But yeah, I think that's right.

1896
01:09:23,400 --> 01:09:26,280
It is a long, it's in the,

1897
01:09:26,280 --> 01:09:28,760
it's like 630 or something is the run time.

1898
01:09:28,760 --> 01:09:29,600
Yeah, yeah.

1899
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:32,240
It is a sizable, yeah, it is longer.

1900
01:09:32,240 --> 01:09:34,800
I have to say, I think I really like

1901
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:37,040
the first two film scenes

1902
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:42,560
more than the racing stuff.

1903
01:09:43,480 --> 01:09:45,560
More than the driving fast,

1904
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:47,480
the fake out where you're driving faster,

1905
01:09:47,480 --> 01:09:49,440
the stuff from the studio tour.

1906
01:09:49,440 --> 01:09:50,280
Yeah, yeah.

1907
01:09:50,280 --> 01:09:51,120
I like the new stuff in this more.

1908
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:54,440
I bet it's more like, it's kinda easier to track,

1909
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:56,520
I would say, moments you remember.

1910
01:09:56,520 --> 01:09:57,360
Yeah, for sure.

1911
01:09:57,360 --> 01:09:58,560
A little more, it's so,

1912
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:03,360
you're not sure where to look maybe in the main show.

1913
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:05,280
Yeah, and I think,

1914
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:08,680
I guess I just always wish they finished the,

1915
01:10:08,680 --> 01:10:10,920
and then they'd have to be a full 360,

1916
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:15,840
but to something on the roof of the car.

1917
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:17,440
I don't know, I can see the edges.

1918
01:10:17,440 --> 01:10:18,280
Yeah, you can.

1919
01:10:18,280 --> 01:10:20,880
I feel like I shouldn't be able to see the edges.

1920
01:10:21,880 --> 01:10:23,240
Yeah, that's true.

1921
01:10:23,240 --> 01:10:24,800
I mean, it's tricky.

1922
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:27,040
I mean, with even Soarin',

1923
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:29,200
it's like you can, depending on where you're sitting,

1924
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:31,600
you can easily, obviously if you're at the bottom,

1925
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:33,400
you see the edge.

1926
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:35,360
It's always a little bit of,

1927
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:37,560
couldn't you have done a little more

1928
01:10:37,560 --> 01:10:40,880
so I don't have to see these edges sometimes?

1929
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:42,280
It feels like they could.

1930
01:10:43,200 --> 01:10:45,040
That's just, maybe that's just because

1931
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:46,840
we've been on these things a lot,

1932
01:10:46,840 --> 01:10:49,080
and people aren't actually registering that.

1933
01:10:49,080 --> 01:10:50,760
Yeah, yeah, I don't know.

1934
01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:54,800
I feel really guilty for saying anything in this area.

1935
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:56,560
I think we're being ungrateful

1936
01:10:56,560 --> 01:11:00,400
to the people who give us so much great material.

1937
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:02,200
Well, I wanna be hashtag grateful,

1938
01:11:02,200 --> 01:11:04,280
so I don't wanna come off like that,

1939
01:11:04,280 --> 01:11:06,200
but sometimes when you see the edges,

1940
01:11:06,200 --> 01:11:08,560
you go, couldn't you, come on.

1941
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:11,120
A little more, make this screen a little bigger.

1942
01:11:11,120 --> 01:11:14,760
When things are, when transitions in screen rides

1943
01:11:14,760 --> 01:11:17,120
are seamless, where you really don't,

1944
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:19,520
which I think of Transformers, I think of Spider-Man,

1945
01:11:20,360 --> 01:11:23,800
Harry Potter, it is pretty unbelievable.

1946
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:26,200
You're like, I really can't, there's no,

1947
01:11:27,240 --> 01:11:31,600
how crazily did they put us in a physical position

1948
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:33,200
to never really see?

1949
01:11:33,200 --> 01:11:35,520
I didn't, I don't remember exactly when,

1950
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:37,440
but I didn't even know there was that elevator thing

1951
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:40,120
in Transformers until fairly recently,

1952
01:11:40,120 --> 01:11:42,120
which was the last couple years,

1953
01:11:42,120 --> 01:11:43,800
but I had to watch a YouTube video

1954
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:46,440
that points out the elevator that happens.

1955
01:11:46,440 --> 01:11:47,600
You know what I'm talking about?

1956
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:48,440
Yeah, I guess so, yeah, yeah.

1957
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:49,920
Like in Spider-Man.

1958
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:50,880
Yeah, in the middle of the ride,

1959
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:53,640
all of a sudden you literally just go up on an elevator,

1960
01:11:53,640 --> 01:11:55,320
which is crazy, because I never noticed that,

1961
01:11:55,320 --> 01:11:56,720
and then in the video on YouTube,

1962
01:11:56,720 --> 01:11:58,760
somebody specifically took their phone

1963
01:11:58,760 --> 01:12:01,160
and took a shot to show you

1964
01:12:01,160 --> 01:12:02,960
the actual physical movement of it,

1965
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:05,560
and I was like, I've never noticed that.

1966
01:12:05,560 --> 01:12:07,760
I've ridden this so many times.

1967
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:10,000
Your favorite ride just is the best ride, yeah.

1968
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:11,480
The gift that keeps on giving.

1969
01:12:11,480 --> 01:12:13,000
Yeah. So amazing, isn't it?

1970
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:17,240
So yeah, so yeah, I see what you're saying, Jason.

1971
01:12:17,240 --> 01:12:18,160
The edges.

1972
01:12:18,160 --> 01:12:19,000
Yeah.

1973
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,440
But I think if I had to choose,

1974
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:24,800
I'd rather do this than Kong on the studio tour,

1975
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:28,280
but I'd rather do Fast and Furious on the studio tour

1976
01:12:28,280 --> 01:12:30,000
than in Florida.

1977
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:30,840
Yeah, it's over quicker.

1978
01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:31,680
Does that make sense?

1979
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:32,520
Yes.

1980
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:33,560
Yeah, it's over quicker.

1981
01:12:33,560 --> 01:12:36,400
Mercifully, there's no separate line to wait in.

1982
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:40,680
Yeah, I kind of love the insane cumbersome setups

1983
01:12:40,680 --> 01:12:42,240
throughout the studio tour,

1984
01:12:42,240 --> 01:12:44,640
where they have to go like, hey, that's a strange car.

1985
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:45,480
Like security.

1986
01:12:45,640 --> 01:12:47,080
Do they still do that?

1987
01:12:47,080 --> 01:12:48,920
Oh my God, like they have to seat it the whole time?

1988
01:12:48,920 --> 01:12:49,760
I've been on it a while,

1989
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:51,040
but I feel like there's little differences.

1990
01:12:51,040 --> 01:12:54,920
I have an annual pass now, and I never go to that.

1991
01:12:54,920 --> 01:12:56,760
You haven't tried to get a two-year-old

1992
01:12:56,760 --> 01:12:58,000
on that 45-minute studio tour?

1993
01:12:58,000 --> 01:12:59,880
Oh my God, oh yeah, absolutely not.

1994
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:00,720
Oh my God.

1995
01:13:00,720 --> 01:13:01,560
There's a rumor.

1996
01:13:01,560 --> 01:13:03,520
And if there was any stall, if there was a one-minute stall.

1997
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:04,360
Oh yeah.

1998
01:13:04,360 --> 01:13:06,080
Sweating and sweating.

1999
01:13:06,080 --> 01:13:08,000
Son, look, Mr. Mayor has been canceled,

2000
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,200
but they're trying to film the finale, okay?

2001
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:11,040
They still owe it.

2002
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:12,360
It's a legal thing.

2003
01:13:12,360 --> 01:13:13,840
Finish the story.

2004
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:19,800
The rumor is Fast and Furious Coaster coming.

2005
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:20,640
This ghost.

2006
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:21,480
Coming here, right?

2007
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:23,320
That's the rumor, yeah.

2008
01:13:23,320 --> 01:13:24,280
We'll see.

2009
01:13:24,280 --> 01:13:27,080
There's been many rumors that haven't panned out, so.

2010
01:13:27,080 --> 01:13:27,920
We'll see.

2011
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:29,080
But that sounds like they might like.

2012
01:13:29,080 --> 01:13:30,400
Where do you think?

2013
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:32,360
Well, there's a lot of speculation about where.

2014
01:13:32,360 --> 01:13:34,640
They were talking about getting rid of like animal actors

2015
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:36,760
and just putting it up on the upper lot.

2016
01:13:36,760 --> 01:13:37,880
Gasping.

2017
01:13:37,880 --> 01:13:38,880
Yeah.

2018
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:42,400
So in that section there, and some even people,

2019
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:43,400
people were like speculating,

2020
01:13:43,960 --> 01:13:45,560
you could kind of like loop it around on the side

2021
01:13:45,560 --> 01:13:48,720
of the mountain a little bit in a way, which sounds awesome.

2022
01:13:48,720 --> 01:13:49,880
Yeah, jeez.

2023
01:13:49,880 --> 01:13:51,360
But I don't know, then other people were saying,

2024
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:53,160
I don't know, it could go anywhere on the lower lot.

2025
01:13:53,160 --> 01:13:55,600
Go through the big minion's eye.

2026
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:56,920
That would be amazing.

2027
01:13:56,920 --> 01:13:58,800
They really should do something like that.

2028
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:00,720
But yeah, so hopefully they'll correct

2029
01:14:00,720 --> 01:14:04,360
the Fast and Furious problem, you know?

2030
01:14:04,360 --> 01:14:06,400
Because I think Velocicoaster as well gave,

2031
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:08,280
people love Velocicoaster.

2032
01:14:08,280 --> 01:14:09,120
Yeah.

2033
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:10,760
So I think they're like, they're high on coasters

2034
01:14:10,760 --> 01:14:11,600
right now.

2035
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:12,960
Yeah, and that takes up,

2036
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:15,760
it's not a huge footprint either.

2037
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:17,680
Right, because a lot of that's vertical.

2038
01:14:17,680 --> 01:14:18,520
Yeah.

2039
01:14:18,520 --> 01:14:20,480
So yeah, we'll see.

2040
01:14:20,480 --> 01:14:21,320
Hopefully.

2041
01:14:21,320 --> 01:14:22,840
Yeah.

2042
01:14:22,840 --> 01:14:27,200
On this thing, I mean, like the sequence,

2043
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:31,720
the main sequence, I mean, so it's a lot of dinosaurs.

2044
01:14:31,720 --> 01:14:33,000
Who in the, oh fuck.

2045
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:34,120
They're not T-Rexes.

2046
01:14:34,120 --> 01:14:34,960
Not T-Rexes.

2047
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:35,800
They're evolved.

2048
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:36,880
They're V-Rexes.

2049
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:37,960
V-Rexes, yeah.

2050
01:14:37,960 --> 01:14:39,560
Vastodosaurus.

2051
01:14:39,560 --> 01:14:40,400
Vasta?

2052
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:42,200
Vast, I mean I.

2053
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:45,680
You want it, you're really looking at it like Vastasaurus,

2054
01:14:45,680 --> 01:14:49,360
but I'm seeing an extra Tato, like Tato Park.

2055
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:51,000
Vastasaurus.

2056
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:52,080
Vastasaurus.

2057
01:14:52,080 --> 01:14:52,920
It's like what.

2058
01:14:52,920 --> 01:14:53,760
It's Craig Healy.

2059
01:14:53,760 --> 01:14:54,600
Craig Healy would say.

2060
01:14:54,600 --> 01:14:55,440
Take it to Vastasaurus.

2061
01:14:55,440 --> 01:14:56,280
Yeah.

2062
01:14:56,280 --> 01:14:57,120
Yeah.

2063
01:14:57,120 --> 01:14:57,960
Yeah.

2064
01:14:57,960 --> 01:14:59,040
Headed to Skull and Island.

2065
01:14:59,040 --> 01:15:00,560
And we're in the back.

2066
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:04,880
Vastasaurus seems like it's bigger or something,

2067
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:06,800
like vast, like that's a descriptor for a land.

2068
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:08,360
Are they bigger or more.

2069
01:15:08,360 --> 01:15:09,240
Doesn't look like they're bigger.

2070
01:15:09,240 --> 01:15:10,080
Violent.

2071
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:11,280
Yeah, they're more violent.

2072
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:15,160
I do not like when Kong rips their skull.

2073
01:15:15,160 --> 01:15:16,000
Oh, you don't like when.

2074
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:16,840
I always found that very unnerving.

2075
01:15:16,840 --> 01:15:18,400
The moment he bends their,

2076
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:23,400
he like has both ends of the dinosaur's jaw

2077
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:25,640
and just rips it like.

2078
01:15:25,640 --> 01:15:26,480
It's the most violent.

2079
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:28,040
Cracks it like a nut.

2080
01:15:28,040 --> 01:15:29,080
Outside of Horror Nights,

2081
01:15:29,080 --> 01:15:32,320
like most gruesome, violent death

2082
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:33,680
in all of theme parks maybe.

2083
01:15:33,680 --> 01:15:34,520
I think maybe.

2084
01:15:34,520 --> 01:15:35,360
Of a creature.

2085
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:36,200
I think so.

2086
01:15:36,200 --> 01:15:37,040
It's pretty crazy.

2087
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:37,880
Yeah.

2088
01:15:37,880 --> 01:15:39,880
He snaps this thing's jaw.

2089
01:15:39,880 --> 01:15:41,720
You don't really see the aftermath of it,

2090
01:15:41,720 --> 01:15:44,080
but you certainly see the beginning.

2091
01:15:44,080 --> 01:15:46,640
You snap the thing and it lies.

2092
01:15:46,640 --> 01:15:47,480
You get a good.

2093
01:15:47,480 --> 01:15:48,320
It just flops.

2094
01:15:48,320 --> 01:15:50,040
Half second of limp.

2095
01:15:50,040 --> 01:15:52,320
And you're like, oh my God, Kong.

2096
01:15:52,320 --> 01:15:53,160
Yeah.

2097
01:15:53,160 --> 01:15:55,560
Gee, you couldn't get to kick him away?

2098
01:15:56,760 --> 01:15:57,800
Yeah, there's no,

2099
01:15:57,800 --> 01:16:01,560
this isn't a Batman doesn't kill situation.

2100
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:02,480
Right, I get.

2101
01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:04,520
More than willing to violently kill.

2102
01:16:04,520 --> 01:16:06,720
The law of the jungle, I understand it.

2103
01:16:06,720 --> 01:16:07,560
I know it.

2104
01:16:07,560 --> 01:16:09,840
This is a Zack Snyder Superman.

2105
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:11,120
That's a real crack.

2106
01:16:11,120 --> 01:16:13,160
Yeah, it's the quick.

2107
01:16:13,160 --> 01:16:14,840
It's a murderous hero.

2108
01:16:14,840 --> 01:16:16,040
Yeah.

2109
01:16:16,040 --> 01:16:16,880
You know.

2110
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:18,800
Yeah, it's, no, that's shocking.

2111
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:19,880
You really.

2112
01:16:19,880 --> 01:16:20,720
Yeah.

2113
01:16:20,720 --> 01:16:21,560
Yeah, I watched.

2114
01:16:21,560 --> 01:16:22,400
I was watching it and I was like,

2115
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:24,160
whoa, I forgot about that.

2116
01:16:24,160 --> 01:16:25,000
Yeah.

2117
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:25,840
Yeah.

2118
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:28,480
Kong, my goodness, I have to cover a child's eyes.

2119
01:16:28,480 --> 01:16:29,320
Yeah, yeah.

2120
01:16:29,320 --> 01:16:31,760
Let's see what Kong did to the Vastidosaurus.

2121
01:16:32,760 --> 01:16:35,640
Miami, the Vastidosaurus, what happened?

2122
01:16:35,640 --> 01:16:36,480
Is it okay?

2123
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:38,440
Is he going to Vastidosaurus heaven?

2124
01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:41,200
Honey, no, he's just, they're doing a joke.

2125
01:16:41,200 --> 01:16:42,440
They're having fun.

2126
01:16:43,760 --> 01:16:45,520
Anyway, get him off the ride.

2127
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:48,520
He'll put, he knows how to put him back together.

2128
01:16:48,520 --> 01:16:50,200
He wouldn't do it if he didn't know how to put him back

2129
01:16:50,200 --> 01:16:51,360
together.

2130
01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:56,360
Yeah, so very shocking violence, but it does save us.

2131
01:16:58,240 --> 01:16:59,080
Yeah, I don't know.

2132
01:16:59,080 --> 01:16:59,920
I guess that's what.

2133
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:02,080
Kate is saved off screen, so I don't know what.

2134
01:17:02,080 --> 01:17:02,920
Yeah.

2135
01:17:02,920 --> 01:17:06,280
Kate just made it separately, so good, good for her.

2136
01:17:07,120 --> 01:17:11,440
But then you get, the big thing that the tram portion

2137
01:17:11,440 --> 01:17:16,200
does not give you and has not given you since a fatal fire

2138
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:20,120
a number of years ago, that you do get a big animatronic

2139
01:17:20,120 --> 01:17:20,960
King Kong.

2140
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:23,880
Love this, love that they knew that that's part of the

2141
01:17:23,880 --> 01:17:24,920
experience.

2142
01:17:24,920 --> 01:17:27,240
They were probably hearing the thing about screen rides.

2143
01:17:27,240 --> 01:17:28,080
Yeah.

2144
01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:32,480
They know, look, there's just, there's no conversation to me

2145
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:36,800
in terms of the tram tour used to have a big robot

2146
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:40,720
that you could see and now you go sit between some screens

2147
01:17:40,720 --> 01:17:41,680
and then leave.

2148
01:17:41,680 --> 01:17:42,520
Right.

2149
01:17:42,520 --> 01:17:43,360
It's just not the same.

2150
01:17:43,360 --> 01:17:45,440
Like you want to see that big robot.

2151
01:17:45,440 --> 01:17:47,800
You want to, you want that banana breath.

2152
01:17:47,800 --> 01:17:51,120
And it's cool that they maybe did that calculation

2153
01:17:51,120 --> 01:17:52,520
and realized we got to give them something.

2154
01:17:52,520 --> 01:17:53,640
We owe a robot.

2155
01:17:53,640 --> 01:17:55,600
We got to give them something, yeah.

2156
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:57,800
It would have been, yeah, the only thing is like the old

2157
01:17:57,800 --> 01:18:02,440
Kong, both Kongs, both coasts, there was like the

2158
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:07,240
existing in a large scale environment.

2159
01:18:07,240 --> 01:18:08,960
That's the only note I would give it.

2160
01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:11,800
Cause like this Kong is like, he's in a building

2161
01:18:11,800 --> 01:18:13,480
perfectly built to his size.

2162
01:18:13,480 --> 01:18:16,720
It feels like I see there's no sense of scale as opposed to

2163
01:18:16,720 --> 01:18:19,760
when he was messing with the bridge, you know, right?

2164
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:20,600
He's big.

2165
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:23,400
And obviously he's a big Kong and it's really awesome to see

2166
01:18:23,400 --> 01:18:25,880
him. But yeah, the difference that that, the only thing I

2167
01:18:25,880 --> 01:18:29,400
would say, yeah, the scale and the other rides is, is kind of

2168
01:18:29,400 --> 01:18:32,880
important to my love of big robot Kong.

2169
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:36,120
It's kind of weird that he just like looks at you.

2170
01:18:36,120 --> 01:18:37,120
I mean, I don't love that.

2171
01:18:37,120 --> 01:18:39,440
I could, that would be, I guess, be a plus up is just do

2172
01:18:39,440 --> 01:18:40,280
something.

2173
01:18:40,280 --> 01:18:43,880
The budget, it feels like they just like begged the money

2174
01:18:43,880 --> 01:18:45,560
people, like we need this Kong.

2175
01:18:45,560 --> 01:18:47,840
And they're like, okay, you know how you want him to like do

2176
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:50,320
something or give a thumbs up or put some sunglasses on?

2177
01:18:50,320 --> 01:18:52,440
No way. Too much movement.

2178
01:18:52,440 --> 01:18:55,000
We need him cheaper, cheaper, cheaper.

2179
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:56,160
We don't want him breaking down.

2180
01:18:56,160 --> 01:18:58,360
And they're like, all right, well, can he do, can he give him

2181
01:18:58,360 --> 01:19:00,680
like a winker? Can he? No, no, no, no, no.

2182
01:19:00,680 --> 01:19:02,840
He just kind of has to breathe at them.

2183
01:19:02,840 --> 01:19:03,720
He can exist.

2184
01:19:03,720 --> 01:19:06,480
He can exist there and he can move a little bit.

2185
01:19:06,480 --> 01:19:08,080
Like it feels that's what it feels like to me.

2186
01:19:08,080 --> 01:19:10,880
Cause I, again, we've said it a million times, obviously the

2187
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:13,320
people making all this stuff, I'm sure came up with the

2188
01:19:13,320 --> 01:19:15,080
coolest ideas possible.

2189
01:19:15,080 --> 01:19:15,920
Yeah.

2190
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:17,840
And then this was probably, yeah, the compromise.

2191
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:19,520
So yeah, it's better than nothing.

2192
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:20,360
Of course.

2193
01:19:20,360 --> 01:19:21,560
Smoke a big cigarette.

2194
01:19:21,560 --> 01:19:22,400
Fantastic.

2195
01:19:22,400 --> 01:19:23,240
Oh man.

2196
01:19:23,240 --> 01:19:24,080
Who will that be?

2197
01:19:24,080 --> 01:19:24,920
Oh, fantastic.

2198
01:19:24,920 --> 01:19:27,640
Oh, can I complain about a cigarette thing real quick?

2199
01:19:27,880 --> 01:19:28,960
It's unrelated.

2200
01:19:28,960 --> 01:19:32,600
I just have to cause they're super seven is a company makes

2201
01:19:32,600 --> 01:19:35,120
toys and they're making a crusty, the clown toy.

2202
01:19:35,120 --> 01:19:38,000
And when they first showed the pictures of crusty, the clown,

2203
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:41,160
he came with a cigarette and he handed out a cigarette and

2204
01:19:41,160 --> 01:19:43,440
Mr. Teeny who has smoking a cigarette as well.

2205
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:46,080
And I was like, holy shit, this is the greatest thing ever.

2206
01:19:46,080 --> 01:19:49,920
Disney stepped in and said no cigarettes.

2207
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:52,080
And now they've had to revise the toy.

2208
01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:52,920
No cigar.

2209
01:19:52,920 --> 01:19:54,320
Disney stepped in.

2210
01:19:54,320 --> 01:19:55,960
Well, that's going to crusty.

2211
01:19:55,960 --> 01:19:57,560
Oh, yeah.

2212
01:19:58,480 --> 01:19:59,320
Cause I was shocked that they let it.

2213
01:19:59,320 --> 01:20:01,320
Cause I remember we were, I was texting people texting

2214
01:20:01,320 --> 01:20:04,080
Justin Michael, look at this crusty, the clown cigarette.

2215
01:20:04,080 --> 01:20:07,120
We're like, yeah, we want to see it.

2216
01:20:07,120 --> 01:20:07,960
We want to get it.

2217
01:20:07,960 --> 01:20:10,600
And then no, Disney stepped in and they, it sucks.

2218
01:20:10,600 --> 01:20:11,720
Can't have good things.

2219
01:20:11,720 --> 01:20:13,720
That's really like, yeah, they're going to,

2220
01:20:13,720 --> 01:20:16,560
I think they're going to change some minds with the people

2221
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:20,480
with the 30 somethings buying some adult collectors.

2222
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:21,320
Yeah.

2223
01:20:23,160 --> 01:20:26,120
Kids are going to be like Mr. Teeny is smoking with my dad's

2224
01:20:26,120 --> 01:20:28,640
$45 adult collectible toy.

2225
01:20:28,640 --> 01:20:30,320
And now I'm going to smoke.

2226
01:20:30,320 --> 01:20:33,240
I want to be like that minor character monkey.

2227
01:20:33,240 --> 01:20:34,640
Yeah. Oh gosh.

2228
01:20:34,640 --> 01:20:35,640
So annoying to me.

2229
01:20:35,640 --> 01:20:36,560
Yeah.

2230
01:20:36,560 --> 01:20:37,400
Anyway.

2231
01:20:37,400 --> 01:20:38,680
Anyway, the robot Kong.

2232
01:20:38,680 --> 01:20:41,080
I mean, I, this is where I will be grateful.

2233
01:20:41,080 --> 01:20:43,160
I'm happy to see my friend King Kong.

2234
01:20:43,160 --> 01:20:45,040
I feel warmly to King Kong.

2235
01:20:45,920 --> 01:20:47,840
I'm happy to see a giant animatronic.

2236
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:48,680
I am happy too.

2237
01:20:48,680 --> 01:20:50,040
I am grateful for Kong as well.

2238
01:20:50,040 --> 01:20:50,880
I don't want you to think I'm not.

2239
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:53,320
I am grateful so, and he does look emotive.

2240
01:20:53,320 --> 01:20:54,160
He does.

2241
01:20:54,160 --> 01:20:55,720
He's, I'm glad he's there.

2242
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:57,160
Oh, that's great.

2243
01:20:57,160 --> 01:20:58,840
I think they, they did a good job.

2244
01:20:58,840 --> 01:21:03,240
It was, you know, I, I, one article was pointing out,

2245
01:21:03,240 --> 01:21:05,240
article from the time this came out,

2246
01:21:06,760 --> 01:21:10,760
that this was Universal's first big attraction,

2247
01:21:10,760 --> 01:21:14,200
like in the Florida parks since they built Diagon Alley.

2248
01:21:14,200 --> 01:21:17,400
So I'm sure there were unreasonable expectations.

2249
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:18,240
Oh yeah.

2250
01:21:18,240 --> 01:21:20,240
That it's like, well, you build a massive giant land.

2251
01:21:20,240 --> 01:21:22,880
Surely you're going to hit it out in the park with this one.

2252
01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:25,880
And I think it's a solid B plus A minus.

2253
01:21:25,880 --> 01:21:26,720
Yeah.

2254
01:21:26,720 --> 01:21:28,040
I think it's a rock solid ride.

2255
01:21:28,040 --> 01:21:29,200
Like, I think it's fun.

2256
01:21:29,200 --> 01:21:31,360
It's like a ride they didn't need to have,

2257
01:21:31,360 --> 01:21:32,920
but they, they did it.

2258
01:21:32,920 --> 01:21:33,760
Look, I don't know.

2259
01:21:33,760 --> 01:21:37,640
This is, it's where Universal is at as opposed to Disney.

2260
01:21:37,640 --> 01:21:38,880
I don't think Disney's building rides

2261
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:40,680
that they don't need to be, like,

2262
01:21:40,680 --> 01:21:42,240
it feels like a blockbuster, nothing.

2263
01:21:42,240 --> 01:21:45,280
And then you go years between things and boy,

2264
01:21:45,280 --> 01:21:46,920
what they've added, what they've added,

2265
01:21:46,920 --> 01:21:51,120
especially lately to Universal Orlando in terms of

2266
01:21:51,280 --> 01:21:55,520
mid level, not even mid level, they're all like blockbuster,

2267
01:21:55,520 --> 01:22:00,160
but they, it's like somewhere between D and E ticket.

2268
01:22:00,160 --> 01:22:03,680
There's just a like, I just, I think all the time

2269
01:22:03,680 --> 01:22:05,560
about how much they are winning the war.

2270
01:22:05,560 --> 01:22:06,400
D pluses.

2271
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:07,240
Yeah.

2272
01:22:07,240 --> 01:22:08,080
D pluses.

2273
01:22:08,080 --> 01:22:08,920
Yeah.

2274
01:22:08,920 --> 01:22:10,120
Yeah. It doesn't sound great.

2275
01:22:10,120 --> 01:22:10,960
Disney pluses.

2276
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:12,640
They're doing a lot of Disney pluses.

2277
01:22:12,640 --> 01:22:16,560
But they had a run there where it's like Cabana Bay opens,

2278
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:17,680
the water park.

2279
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:20,040
Volcano Bay.

2280
01:22:20,040 --> 01:22:21,800
You can easily name the hotel.

2281
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:24,200
Well, they're two bays.

2282
01:22:24,200 --> 01:22:25,960
I know one of them's a water theme park.

2283
01:22:25,960 --> 01:22:27,040
I know that for a fact.

2284
01:22:27,040 --> 01:22:27,880
The third park.

2285
01:22:27,880 --> 01:22:29,240
The third park, the water theme park.

2286
01:22:29,240 --> 01:22:30,240
That's the only thing I don't like about it.

2287
01:22:30,240 --> 01:22:31,080
I know.

2288
01:22:31,080 --> 01:22:31,900
Hate it.

2289
01:22:31,900 --> 01:22:32,740
Not a third gate.

2290
01:22:32,740 --> 01:22:33,580
Volcano Bay.

2291
01:22:33,580 --> 01:22:35,880
So, I mean, they also opened Jimmy Fallon after,

2292
01:22:35,880 --> 01:22:37,200
but yeah, no, what are you gonna do?

2293
01:22:37,200 --> 01:22:38,480
But they allowed.

2294
01:22:38,480 --> 01:22:39,800
Okay.

2295
01:22:39,800 --> 01:22:41,760
Yeah, it doesn't make them not be winning the war.

2296
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:43,880
When's their fourth park opening?

2297
01:22:43,880 --> 01:22:44,880
Is it in a couple of years?

2298
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:45,720
2025?

2299
01:22:45,720 --> 01:22:48,080
Makes me wish it wouldn't be built.

2300
01:22:48,080 --> 01:22:49,760
That's how awful that is.

2301
01:22:50,760 --> 01:22:51,600
To hear that it's the fourth?

2302
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:52,440
No.

2303
01:22:52,440 --> 01:22:53,280
No.

2304
01:22:53,280 --> 01:22:56,200
You have yet to see the volcano up close though.

2305
01:22:56,200 --> 01:22:57,040
Yeah.

2306
01:22:57,040 --> 01:22:59,040
So you'll sign off on it.

2307
01:22:59,040 --> 01:22:59,880
Good enough.

2308
01:22:59,880 --> 01:23:01,920
This is good enough that it's the third park.

2309
01:23:01,920 --> 01:23:04,400
The volcano itself is good enough for the third park.

2310
01:23:04,400 --> 01:23:06,960
The water slide's not as much.

2311
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:09,840
But the volcano is third park worthy.

2312
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:13,940
But the theming around it is not as good

2313
01:23:13,940 --> 01:23:15,560
or existent at all.

2314
01:23:15,560 --> 01:23:16,640
Because as you're standing on the slides,

2315
01:23:16,640 --> 01:23:18,320
you can just see the houses on the street

2316
01:23:18,320 --> 01:23:19,480
over across the street.

2317
01:23:19,520 --> 01:23:21,320
Yeah, it is right along the freeway.

2318
01:23:21,320 --> 01:23:22,160
Yeah.

2319
01:23:22,160 --> 01:23:23,640
Because that volcano's incredible.

2320
01:23:23,640 --> 01:23:24,640
You go inside it, you're like,

2321
01:23:24,640 --> 01:23:26,560
I was just sitting in that wave pool looking up

2322
01:23:26,560 --> 01:23:28,840
and going, this thing is incredible, wow.

2323
01:23:28,840 --> 01:23:30,680
And then you go on the slides and you're just like,

2324
01:23:30,680 --> 01:23:32,000
there's some houses over there.

2325
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:32,840
Yeah.

2326
01:23:32,840 --> 01:23:34,680
That breaks the immersion a little bit.

2327
01:23:36,040 --> 01:23:39,280
Yeah, I remember, I saw that when I was down

2328
01:23:39,280 --> 01:23:41,960
for that Batch the Party last summer,

2329
01:23:41,960 --> 01:23:44,200
which is when I did this attraction.

2330
01:23:44,200 --> 01:23:47,440
I broke off from the group to do it.

2331
01:23:47,440 --> 01:23:48,640
I chickened out of Hulk.

2332
01:23:48,640 --> 01:23:50,560
I'm not quite there on a haul.

2333
01:23:50,560 --> 01:23:53,360
That seems like exactly above the line for me.

2334
01:23:53,360 --> 01:23:55,960
But it was also a good excuse to go do this.

2335
01:23:55,960 --> 01:23:57,560
I wanted to see this.

2336
01:23:57,560 --> 01:24:00,320
Over the course of that is the first time that I had

2337
01:24:00,320 --> 01:24:03,120
the best beer in theme parks, the Island New Bar IPA.

2338
01:24:03,120 --> 01:24:04,520
Oh yeah.

2339
01:24:04,520 --> 01:24:05,520
So great, oh my God.

2340
01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:08,380
And it kinda like, we'd like,

2341
01:24:08,380 --> 01:24:11,280
there were shots before we got in the car.

2342
01:24:11,280 --> 01:24:13,440
So I was already a little hazy.

2343
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:17,160
That Island New Bar IPA kinda fucked me up.

2344
01:24:17,160 --> 01:24:20,400
And it's like, sort of a, I don't know,

2345
01:24:20,400 --> 01:24:21,920
pretty high alcohol content, I think.

2346
01:24:21,920 --> 01:24:26,920
And something between that and the atmosphere of this queue,

2347
01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:30,120
it was like, there was just a lot,

2348
01:24:30,120 --> 01:24:33,440
it is scary, it's so misty and dark.

2349
01:24:33,440 --> 01:24:35,600
We didn't even talk about that animatronic,

2350
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:37,520
the creepy lady.

2351
01:24:37,520 --> 01:24:39,120
Oh yeah, the shaw woman.

2352
01:24:39,120 --> 01:24:41,240
The shaw woman, they even say.

2353
01:24:42,080 --> 01:24:45,380
And that she was warning you to not, you know,

2354
01:24:45,380 --> 01:24:46,640
to get out of there.

2355
01:24:46,640 --> 01:24:51,360
And just like, I just remember, I was in such a mood

2356
01:24:51,360 --> 01:24:53,480
and I also was trying to hook back up with them

2357
01:24:53,480 --> 01:24:55,160
and failing to do so.

2358
01:24:55,160 --> 01:24:57,560
I didn't know if they just weren't checking their phones

2359
01:24:57,560 --> 01:24:59,400
or if it was a reception issue.

2360
01:24:59,400 --> 01:25:02,000
But so, it's all, I'm kinda in a haze.

2361
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:03,760
The line is scary.

2362
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:05,560
I'm starting to genuinely think,

2363
01:25:05,560 --> 01:25:07,000
am I gonna lose the group?

2364
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,000
What if I have to go home by myself?

2365
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:10,440
And what if my phone runs out of battery

2366
01:25:10,440 --> 01:25:12,980
and I don't remember how to get back to the house

2367
01:25:12,980 --> 01:25:14,320
with Iron Man on the wall?

2368
01:25:14,360 --> 01:25:17,680
And on top of it, it was becoming very clear

2369
01:25:17,680 --> 01:25:20,240
how much Delta was a big real threat.

2370
01:25:20,240 --> 01:25:23,520
So I was also thinking, I'm getting Delta right now

2371
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:24,480
in this line.

2372
01:25:24,480 --> 01:25:26,080
This is the most claustrophobic line.

2373
01:25:26,080 --> 01:25:28,720
I think I even waited out a breakdown.

2374
01:25:28,720 --> 01:25:30,280
I think it was like, it's gonna be down for a minute

2375
01:25:30,280 --> 01:25:31,840
if you want and I did stay in there.

2376
01:25:31,840 --> 01:25:33,200
But then over the course of that,

2377
01:25:33,200 --> 01:25:34,680
oh, but that means I'm getting Delta.

2378
01:25:34,680 --> 01:25:37,280
So I'm getting, there was so much hitting me all at once

2379
01:25:37,280 --> 01:25:39,480
and it probably wouldn't have all been freaking me out

2380
01:25:39,480 --> 01:25:42,320
as much without the atmosphere of the queue.

2381
01:25:43,200 --> 01:25:47,480
It really did put me in a mood and transport me.

2382
01:25:47,480 --> 01:25:50,560
So again, it's as close as I can come

2383
01:25:50,560 --> 01:25:53,000
to saying an unskippable.

2384
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,680
Because it really gave you the fear.

2385
01:25:55,680 --> 01:25:57,680
It gave me the fear.

2386
01:25:57,680 --> 01:26:02,360
Yes, and it sparked my actual, my other fears.

2387
01:26:02,360 --> 01:26:07,360
Buoyed by real life fears of disease and loneliness

2388
01:26:07,760 --> 01:26:08,600
and abandonment.

2389
01:26:08,600 --> 01:26:09,720
Yes, abandonment, yeah, indeed.

2390
01:26:09,720 --> 01:26:12,560
I know, it was a very dramatic situation.

2391
01:26:12,560 --> 01:26:15,680
I felt like Kate.

2392
01:26:15,680 --> 01:26:18,040
I worried they were all gonna be Joes

2393
01:26:18,040 --> 01:26:20,080
and leave me in the lurch.

2394
01:26:20,080 --> 01:26:22,800
You tried to explain that too to Jinx Costanza

2395
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:25,840
and he's like, Delta, I've heard of some great music

2396
01:26:25,840 --> 01:26:27,760
coming out of the Mississippi Delta,

2397
01:26:27,760 --> 01:26:30,160
but I don't know what you're talking about, pal.

2398
01:26:32,040 --> 01:26:34,800
I don't want, I've never seen no Delta around here.

2399
01:26:34,800 --> 01:26:36,120
Let's keep it that way.

2400
01:26:36,640 --> 01:26:39,840
But the mighty Kong rescued you.

2401
01:26:39,840 --> 01:26:43,040
Yeah, he rescued all of us in a lot of ways.

2402
01:26:43,040 --> 01:26:44,280
We all fell in love with him.

2403
01:26:44,280 --> 01:26:46,800
We all sat in his hand in a certain way.

2404
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:48,960
Yeah, he made us all stars.

2405
01:26:48,960 --> 01:26:51,880
We were all Kong stars that day.

2406
01:26:51,880 --> 01:26:55,440
If I could plus it up, because that's what I would do.

2407
01:26:55,440 --> 01:26:57,160
Like it's a good ride if I plus it up.

2408
01:26:57,160 --> 01:27:00,680
If we could somehow touch his hand or sit in his hand.

2409
01:27:00,680 --> 01:27:03,000
I know you're not supposed to touch stuff on rides, but.

2410
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,440
Well, that plus up is an experience you can have

2411
01:27:05,440 --> 01:27:07,520
outside of a lot of wax museums.

2412
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:08,640
Well, that's true.

2413
01:27:08,640 --> 01:27:11,880
So you could, so you got that, you could go do that.

2414
01:27:11,880 --> 01:27:14,720
But like, what if he put his hand up against the tram

2415
01:27:14,720 --> 01:27:17,360
or put up against the car and you could kind of like touch it?

2416
01:27:17,360 --> 01:27:19,120
Oh boy, yeah, that'd be great.

2417
01:27:19,120 --> 01:27:21,040
Yeah, I guess you would still like snag clothing

2418
01:27:21,040 --> 01:27:24,000
and somebody be ripped out accidentally maybe, but.

2419
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:24,840
Yeah.

2420
01:27:24,840 --> 01:27:25,840
You just gotta keep it there for a while

2421
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:28,000
and you're supposed to immediately understand

2422
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:29,840
that this is so that you can touch him.

2423
01:27:29,840 --> 01:27:31,280
Well, he would say it, I think.

2424
01:27:31,280 --> 01:27:32,120
Touch me.

2425
01:27:32,120 --> 01:27:32,960
Touch me.

2426
01:27:32,960 --> 01:27:33,800
Touch me.

2427
01:27:33,800 --> 01:27:34,640
Touch me.

2428
01:27:34,640 --> 01:27:35,480
Thrill me.

2429
01:27:36,880 --> 01:27:38,200
Hold me, thrill me.

2430
01:27:38,200 --> 01:27:40,560
Kiss me, kill me.

2431
01:27:40,560 --> 01:27:44,160
Yeah, plus it ups, but yeah, I don't know.

2432
01:27:44,160 --> 01:27:46,120
It's hard to plus this up because I think, yeah,

2433
01:27:46,120 --> 01:27:48,920
my gripes that I've already shared is like open,

2434
01:27:48,920 --> 01:27:51,360
like a bigger space to see the Kong robot and.

2435
01:27:51,360 --> 01:27:52,200
Yeah.

2436
01:27:52,200 --> 01:27:53,520
And you, oh, okay.

2437
01:27:53,520 --> 01:27:56,160
I was gonna say, I think I have a plus up,

2438
01:27:56,160 --> 01:28:01,160
which is that I really like in the redone Jurassic Park

2439
01:28:01,840 --> 01:28:03,280
boat ride at Universal Hollywood,

2440
01:28:03,280 --> 01:28:07,520
the Jurassic World ride, there was like an indoor habitat.

2441
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:08,360
Like.

2442
01:28:08,360 --> 01:28:09,200
Up at the top.

2443
01:28:09,200 --> 01:28:10,020
Up at the top.

2444
01:28:10,020 --> 01:28:11,840
Yeah, there's kind of a jungle at night.

2445
01:28:11,840 --> 01:28:16,840
I would say 86, the studio tour footage,

2446
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:19,760
86 that and just build a habitat in there

2447
01:28:19,760 --> 01:28:21,400
and use some of those screens.

2448
01:28:21,400 --> 01:28:25,440
Like they have some practical dinosaurs

2449
01:28:25,440 --> 01:28:28,240
and maybe like a small Kong in the distance.

2450
01:28:28,240 --> 01:28:31,000
Use some of those screens, like area screens they have

2451
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:35,680
in like the Navi River journey that kind of like blend

2452
01:28:35,680 --> 01:28:37,720
into the practical scenery.

2453
01:28:37,720 --> 01:28:41,360
And I guess it's hard to be, do a big dramatic climax,

2454
01:28:41,360 --> 01:28:46,020
like a big fight scene, but they did something interesting

2455
01:28:46,020 --> 01:28:48,880
with practical stuff in a limited space.

2456
01:28:48,880 --> 01:28:51,320
And I just think you could do that here.

2457
01:28:51,320 --> 01:28:53,400
So you want to see what they actually,

2458
01:28:53,400 --> 01:28:54,560
now I understand what you're asking for.

2459
01:28:54,560 --> 01:28:59,560
You want to see a robot Kong kill the robot Vastodosaurus.

2460
01:29:00,440 --> 01:29:01,760
I wouldn't see the crack in real life.

2461
01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:06,760
You want to see the robot have its jaw come unhinged.

2462
01:29:07,080 --> 01:29:10,040
You want that sound to be coming from the robot.

2463
01:29:10,040 --> 01:29:12,720
Yeah, that's the tough, it is tough

2464
01:29:12,720 --> 01:29:16,000
because so much of this stuff when you like action wise,

2465
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,800
it's so hard to do that with the robots, almost impossible.

2466
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:19,640
So it is tricky.

2467
01:29:19,640 --> 01:29:22,320
I mean, what you're saying, I think you could do it,

2468
01:29:22,320 --> 01:29:24,240
but I feel like you'd have to do it the whole time.

2469
01:29:24,240 --> 01:29:26,520
You'd have to get, you have to like get the audience used

2470
01:29:26,520 --> 01:29:28,960
to the reality of the ride with like screens and robots.

2471
01:29:28,960 --> 01:29:32,120
So like if the climax, I like the idea.

2472
01:29:32,120 --> 01:29:35,280
It's just, yeah, it would be like a little jarring maybe,

2473
01:29:35,280 --> 01:29:36,120
but maybe not.

2474
01:29:37,440 --> 01:29:40,000
My plus up isn't for this, it's for volcano bay.

2475
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:41,960
It's you make it Skull Island.

2476
01:29:41,960 --> 01:29:42,800
Oh wow.

2477
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:45,320
You reshape the volcano and it's,

2478
01:29:45,320 --> 01:29:47,920
then it's you're in King Kong's stomach

2479
01:29:47,920 --> 01:29:49,920
and the water on all the sides is his stomach.

2480
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:52,840
Also he's the, it's not, the volcano is not on Skull Island.

2481
01:29:52,840 --> 01:29:54,280
He is the volcano.

2482
01:29:54,280 --> 01:29:55,120
Yeah, yeah.

2483
01:29:55,120 --> 01:29:56,560
You turn him into the volcano.

2484
01:29:56,560 --> 01:29:57,400
Yeah, yeah.

2485
01:29:57,400 --> 01:29:59,440
I guess you have to, you give him a head or something,

2486
01:29:59,440 --> 01:30:01,600
but yeah, you're crawling, you're,

2487
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:04,760
any slide that you're going on, you're lost in his innards.

2488
01:30:04,760 --> 01:30:05,600
So he-

2489
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:07,080
Sure, it's still more feasible

2490
01:30:07,080 --> 01:30:09,840
than when they were gonna try to build a King Kong

2491
01:30:09,840 --> 01:30:13,240
that you would board and then would climb the stratosphere.

2492
01:30:13,240 --> 01:30:14,240
Oh, that's right.

2493
01:30:14,240 --> 01:30:16,440
Oh, that's such a cool idea.

2494
01:30:16,440 --> 01:30:17,280
That is great.

2495
01:30:17,280 --> 01:30:18,720
So the volcano, I just wanna go back to the volcano

2496
01:30:18,720 --> 01:30:20,800
real quick, cause like they do a little show

2497
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:23,160
where the volcano erupts every so often.

2498
01:30:23,160 --> 01:30:26,120
So Kong would have some sort of acid reflux

2499
01:30:26,120 --> 01:30:29,360
every 45 minutes and like throw up bile

2500
01:30:29,360 --> 01:30:30,680
to the people in the wave pool.

2501
01:30:30,680 --> 01:30:31,960
That's him vomiting, yeah.

2502
01:30:31,960 --> 01:30:33,160
But it's good, you know, it's good

2503
01:30:33,160 --> 01:30:35,440
cause it adds more acid to the wave pool.

2504
01:30:35,440 --> 01:30:37,280
Add more acid to the wave pool.

2505
01:30:37,280 --> 01:30:39,560
And then every, you know, there's only,

2506
01:30:39,560 --> 01:30:41,720
you start up there at the top of his body,

2507
01:30:41,720 --> 01:30:42,920
there's only so many ways out.

2508
01:30:42,920 --> 01:30:46,200
So you're trying to, every slide is trying to get out

2509
01:30:46,200 --> 01:30:48,320
of King Kong's dick or butt.

2510
01:30:50,080 --> 01:30:52,160
Okay, that's good.

2511
01:30:52,160 --> 01:30:53,000
Yeah.

2512
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:54,600
If you, as long as you can touch his hand,

2513
01:30:54,600 --> 01:30:56,480
in that instance, I think I would be fine with it.

2514
01:30:56,480 --> 01:30:58,960
Definitely, because yeah, look, I'm here thinking dirty.

2515
01:30:58,960 --> 01:31:00,560
You want soft intimacy.

2516
01:31:00,560 --> 01:31:01,400
I want soft intimacy.

2517
01:31:01,400 --> 01:31:02,760
I think there's room for both

2518
01:31:02,760 --> 01:31:04,200
at this new improved Skull Island Park.

2519
01:31:04,200 --> 01:31:06,400
Okay, so Skull Island is the official

2520
01:31:06,400 --> 01:31:07,840
third park of Universal.

2521
01:31:07,840 --> 01:31:09,200
Yes, now that I would, yeah.

2522
01:31:09,200 --> 01:31:10,400
Once they do this.

2523
01:31:10,400 --> 01:31:11,960
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

2524
01:31:11,960 --> 01:31:14,360
Ride the movies, slide the stomach acid.

2525
01:31:16,840 --> 01:31:20,680
You survived podcast the right, I think.

2526
01:31:20,680 --> 01:31:22,280
You've survived.

2527
01:31:22,280 --> 01:31:24,560
If you've been listening, you were just like,

2528
01:31:25,600 --> 01:31:27,200
tumbling around inside of our stomach acid,

2529
01:31:27,200 --> 01:31:31,560
our guts, our brain, our brain acid, I really should say,

2530
01:31:31,560 --> 01:31:32,800
inside of our skulls.

2531
01:31:32,800 --> 01:31:34,520
And you lighting up a couple flares

2532
01:31:34,520 --> 01:31:38,240
is when I go like, oh, my stomach, my stomach hurts.

2533
01:31:38,240 --> 01:31:41,560
Let us out of this Bill Maher heavy episode.

2534
01:31:43,400 --> 01:31:44,520
What have I done?

2535
01:31:45,520 --> 01:31:47,840
And yet I'm gonna encourage people to go back in

2536
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:50,440
and slosh around some more because you can find us

2537
01:31:50,440 --> 01:31:52,360
on all the socials at podcast the ride.

2538
01:31:52,400 --> 01:31:54,600
There's merch is available in our T public store.

2539
01:31:54,600 --> 01:31:56,240
And for three bonus episodes every month,

2540
01:31:56,240 --> 01:31:58,320
check out podcast the ride the second gate

2541
01:31:58,320 --> 01:32:00,720
or get one more monthly bonus episode

2542
01:32:00,720 --> 01:32:02,880
on our new tier club three.

2543
01:32:02,880 --> 01:32:06,920
You'll find all that at patreon.com slash podcast the ride.

2544
01:32:06,920 --> 01:32:10,120
Might bear mentioning in this one, the quick programming.

2545
01:32:10,120 --> 01:32:11,760
But if you want a sense of what's going on

2546
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:15,440
on the new tier in club three, the third,

2547
01:32:15,440 --> 01:32:19,200
the earned third park of podcast the ride.

2548
01:32:19,480 --> 01:32:24,400
So we're the one more monthly bonus episode

2549
01:32:24,400 --> 01:32:26,400
beyond what you already get on the second gate.

2550
01:32:26,400 --> 01:32:30,000
We just did our first poll of what are those topics

2551
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,880
going to be narrowed it down to five.

2552
01:32:32,880 --> 01:32:35,360
We got to hundreds of great ideas from everybody.

2553
01:32:35,360 --> 01:32:40,320
But the the King Kong, the ults of the the one to beat

2554
01:32:40,320 --> 01:32:43,080
by far was the topic suggestion.

2555
01:32:43,080 --> 01:32:46,320
Eva Anderson talks about whatever she wants.

2556
01:32:46,320 --> 01:32:50,320
One by a landslide by a stomach acid slide.

2557
01:32:50,320 --> 01:32:53,400
And I just want to say that's common.

2558
01:32:53,400 --> 01:32:56,600
Eva has been, we have reached out to Eva.

2559
01:32:56,600 --> 01:32:58,680
We've sent up the Eva flare.

2560
01:32:58,680 --> 01:33:02,320
She responded like a bunch of skull island bats.

2561
01:33:02,320 --> 01:33:06,280
She overnighted us a box full of crocodile bones.

2562
01:33:06,280 --> 01:33:11,280
That could really mean anything coming from you.

2563
01:33:11,720 --> 01:33:13,480
It'll make sense when we do it.

2564
01:33:13,480 --> 01:33:14,920
So I just want to, I hype that up.

2565
01:33:14,920 --> 01:33:16,600
That'll be coming at some point in July.

2566
01:33:16,600 --> 01:33:18,520
It might even take a minute to come together.

2567
01:33:18,520 --> 01:33:20,560
So be patient, but that'll be coming in July

2568
01:33:20,560 --> 01:33:24,360
on club three that's at patreon.com slash podcast the ride.

2569
01:33:24,360 --> 01:33:25,840
We hand hand things over to Eva,

2570
01:33:25,840 --> 01:33:28,440
which probably might be the best choice.

2571
01:33:28,440 --> 01:33:31,160
The listeners are really trying to tell us something here.

2572
01:33:31,160 --> 01:33:33,040
Hey, what do you want us to talk about?

2573
01:33:33,040 --> 01:33:35,120
Why don't you let someone else?

2574
01:33:35,120 --> 01:33:38,480
Someone else decide you monsters.

2575
01:33:39,880 --> 01:33:41,680
You vast the sources.

2576
01:33:42,840 --> 01:33:44,600
Yeah. So, so that's fun.

2577
01:33:45,280 --> 01:33:46,120
Whatever it is, is fun.

2578
01:33:46,120 --> 01:33:47,120
I know, I know that.

2579
01:33:47,120 --> 01:33:48,240
Yeah, yeah.

2580
01:33:48,240 --> 01:33:49,200
We're going to figure it out.

2581
01:33:49,200 --> 01:33:50,760
The expedition begins.

2582
01:33:50,760 --> 01:33:53,760
And real quick, I just want to say if, you know,

2583
01:33:53,760 --> 01:33:55,280
Peter Jackson talking about Peter Jackson,

2584
01:33:55,280 --> 01:33:56,880
and you know, we just did get back,

2585
01:33:56,880 --> 01:33:58,800
which was, we all watched obviously

2586
01:33:58,800 --> 01:34:00,920
over the Christmas break.

2587
01:34:00,920 --> 01:34:02,480
If you want to hear a discussion about it,

2588
01:34:02,480 --> 01:34:05,960
Sammy and Bill talk about it on club random

2589
01:34:05,960 --> 01:34:07,800
and they have some interesting takes on it.

2590
01:34:07,800 --> 01:34:09,560
Did the Beatles, were the Beatles important

2591
01:34:09,560 --> 01:34:11,520
to those guys growing up?

2592
01:34:11,520 --> 01:34:12,920
But not the frighteners.

2593
01:34:12,920 --> 01:34:14,200
They don't touch on the frighteners.

2594
01:34:14,800 --> 01:34:15,640
I haven't finished it yet,

2595
01:34:15,640 --> 01:34:18,160
but so far they have not touched on the frighteners.

2596
01:34:18,160 --> 01:34:20,040
It's not so much about the Peter Jackson.

2597
01:34:20,040 --> 01:34:20,880
No, okay.

2598
01:34:20,880 --> 01:34:21,920
I don't, yeah, I don't know.

2599
01:34:21,920 --> 01:34:23,800
But big up back, yes.

2600
01:34:23,800 --> 01:34:27,080
All I know is that it broke Sammy's heart

2601
01:34:27,080 --> 01:34:28,760
and it was hard for him to watch.

2602
01:34:28,760 --> 01:34:31,080
Well, he's had some band strife of his own.

2603
01:34:31,080 --> 01:34:32,640
Maybe we'll get a documentary about that one.

2604
01:34:32,640 --> 01:34:33,520
That's what he says.

2605
01:34:33,520 --> 01:34:34,800
Fingers crossed.

2606
01:34:34,800 --> 01:34:36,160
That's what he says.

2607
01:34:36,160 --> 01:34:37,000
Forever.

2608
01:34:38,560 --> 01:34:39,600
Dog.
