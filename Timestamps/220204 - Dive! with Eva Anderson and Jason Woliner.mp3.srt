1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,520
Hi there, I'm Mike.

4
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:09,260
I'll be one of the hosts serving you content.

5
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:14,800
Today's podcast menu contains tastefully branded denim vests, the delicious sounding term pesto

6
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:18,120
cream and classy high-end submarine sandwiches.

7
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:22,720
And if you have any questions about the menu, feel free to ask our special guests Jason Wolner

8
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,400
or Eva Anderson.

9
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:29,040
Thanks for dining with us today at Steven Spielberg's underwater submarine restaurant, Dive, because

10
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:52,080
it's Celebriory on Podcast the Ride.

11
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:57,040
Welcome to Podcast the Ride presents Celebriory.

12
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:02,680
Podcast the Ride's latest and greatest themed event, it's Celebrity Restaurant Month.

13
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:07,800
All month we will be celebrating the wonderful world of celebrity owned restaurants.

14
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,640
I'm Scott Gardner joined by Mike Carlson.

15
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,640
Hi.

16
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,640
Hi, I'm Mike Carlson.

17
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,440
And I don't want to like contradict you immediately, but some of these are presented as owned by

18
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,440
celebrities.

19
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:19,680
I just want to make sure we put that caveat because we want some celebrities are being

20
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,760
used maybe as a mascot, just their name value.

21
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:26,320
When you hear these, I don't want to spoil it, but when you hear the name value of some

22
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,280
of these celebrities we're going to be talking about, you're going to be blown away and understand

23
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,280
why people wanted to manipulate the public into believing that they owned it.

24
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:38,680
The incredible assets that are at play, some of the biggest names in our industry.

25
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:42,880
If you know where we're starting today with today's topic, Dive and Steven Spielberg,

26
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,520
and I think it maintains that level throughout our entire month.

27
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:49,160
Jason Sheridan, speaking of star power, Jason Sheridan.

28
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:53,680
You know, the timing could not be better because I'm getting over a stomach ache.

29
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,120
So I'm very excited to talk about this bad food restaurant to steal a phrase from our

30
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,120
former president.

31
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,800
The bad food restaurant.

32
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,800
Which former president?

33
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,800
What did he say that about?

34
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:08,680
Donald Trump, I believe, referred to a place as a bad food restaurant.

35
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,680
I see.

36
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:14,640
Maybe one of his New York Phil and maybe like a great Grayson Carter or Graydon Carter or

37
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,880
whoever that was.

38
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:24,280
Well, Donald Trump, one of the many great men who will factor into this, this month,

39
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,760
I feel I know he pops up more than once.

40
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,160
I think he might today a little bit.

41
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,720
It's stacked with great men.

42
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:37,400
Yeah, which you have to be to get these massive establishments, which some of these are like

43
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,040
some of these are weird little holes in the wall.

44
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:45,840
And then some require the most expensive real estate on the planet and thus requiring the

45
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:52,320
muscling through of people who should be in jail for like 40 reasons.

46
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:56,600
Yeah, some real regular characters show up in this one.

47
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:01,480
And this is also one of the heaviest thematic ones, like in terms of a themed environment.

48
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:04,400
I'd say so. This is perfect in terms of it is themed.

49
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,640
This is a thing that we can parse throughout.

50
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,920
And we've talked about a little before.

51
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:13,320
Some of them are some celebrity restaurants are themed as well.

52
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,560
Yeah, some aren't explicitly.

53
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:22,440
But I feel like the celebrity themselves are the theme in a way like it's like in an ideal

54
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:28,680
scenario where it's almost like you are like entering into the celebrities body or mind

55
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,920
and piloting piloting your brain.

56
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:39,160
Like it's like hopefully like being in a in a fever dream of the life of some esteemed

57
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:42,120
their paraphernalia, their vibe.

58
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:46,160
If a celebrity restaurant succeeds in a lot of them, I would say almost everything we're

59
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,280
talking about did not succeed.

60
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:53,920
Yeah, these are mostly massive failures, I think, in one way or another.

61
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:58,520
But yeah, the month you'll be there'll be a lot of variety for you.

62
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:03,120
Some of the celebrity restaurants, the whole idea was just you'd go and you'd see the

63
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,640
celebrity sitting sadly in a chair.

64
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,480
I think those are the those are some of the ones we're the most excited about.

65
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,560
Yeah, you can find those on the second gate.

66
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,240
But look, it's it's great stars throughout.

67
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:20,840
We got a great logo which has stars in it made by Aaron Gardner.

68
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:23,040
Thanks, Aaron, for the great, the awesome logo for the month.

69
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:31,720
And joining us, very exciting to kick things off, joining us for the first time in far

70
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:37,040
too long. For the first time since directing the best comedy film in the last 10 years,

71
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,440
Boris says a good movie film.

72
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,240
It's Jason Waller. Hi, Jason.

73
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,440
Hey, guys. Thanks. Thanks for having me back.

74
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:45,120
I'm very excited to be back on the podcast.

75
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,120
It's been far too long.

76
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,600
We're happy to have you.

77
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:54,920
I was going to just quick say I was going to ask, could I no longer be referred to as

78
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,000
the Alec Baldwin of Podcast The Ride?

79
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:00,960
Why?

80
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:05,520
I just feel like it's time is coming.

81
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,120
There's something about that name.

82
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,200
No, nothing. No, nothing in particular.

83
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,200
I just think people might get the wrong impression.

84
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,360
It was I was referred to as that because I had been on the show a bunch of times.

85
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,680
It was at the time.

86
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,120
Not because I do.

87
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,120
Right, right. Of course.

88
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,120
Yeah.

89
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,960
And that you were around so much and so often like Alec Baldwin on SNL where you you could

90
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,240
have been in the cast.

91
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,480
That was the idea.

92
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,200
Yeah.

93
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,640
Such a match were you.

94
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:34,040
So it was meant as the highest praise.

95
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,040
It was it was fun.

96
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,120
It was a lot of fun.

97
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,520
But I think, you know, I just feel like it's time.

98
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:43,040
Is there another five timers club member you'd want to be referred to now?

99
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:46,360
Like, uh, Louis CK, perhaps.

100
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:52,240
Yeah. Like really, anyone who hosted SNL and hasn't killed anyone, I would.

101
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,640
Sure, sure.

102
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,160
I'm trying to think. I can't think of one.

103
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,840
So we'll have to get back to you.

104
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Thank you.

105
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:03,000
Oh, Rudy Giuliani.

106
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Oh, yeah, that works.

107
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,560
You worked with him.

108
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,560
Yeah, yeah.

109
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,520
I have. Yeah, that's right.

110
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,520
My buddy.

111
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:16,640
OK. And as if this were not stacked enough, great topics, great guests.

112
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,320
We are going to be joined.

113
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,840
Might be the most exciting part of the month.

114
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:23,400
We're going to be joined multiple times throughout the month

115
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:26,320
by one of the best guests in all the podcasting.

116
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,080
So excited you're here. Eva Anderson.

117
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:28,920
Hey, guys.

118
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,800
You guys are a favorite.

119
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,720
You're a favorite guest. You're regulars.

120
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:35,000
This, I mean, this is so exciting.

121
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
It's a great room.

122
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,240
This is this is a stacked lineup.

123
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,680
And I love that what brought this this awesome group together

124
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,760
is discussing Steven Spielberg's submarine restaurant.

125
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:51,200
Dive for me genuinely a huge topic.

126
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,640
Like what I've been I've certainly been looking forward to for a long time.

127
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:58,000
Every once in a while on the social media, somebody will say they got to do dive.

128
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,520
And I like point to it as much as I can.

129
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,400
Yes, we do.

130
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,320
Maybe we should build an entire month around dive is what we should do.

131
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,080
And here we are.

132
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,680
We're submerging and and I can't wait.

133
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,840
Yeah, this is I feel like we see this a lot.

134
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,240
People really want to talk about this.

135
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:18,600
And it feels it feels important in the like

136
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,760
90s era of these type of restaurants.

137
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:26,040
Yeah, kind of the ultimate version of what we're talking about, where

138
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:29,840
celebrities can throw their their muscle and their money

139
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:35,440
and their hubris behind the idea that that seems a little risky.

140
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,640
And in this case, very risky.

141
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,560
I would say this is not a long life at all.

142
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,320
Yeah. And there were grand plans for dive.

143
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,120
Was it 60 restaurants?

144
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,240
Yes, that's right, Michael.

145
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,360
60. We're going to open 60.

146
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:52,600
They wanted 60 dive restaurants around the world.

147
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,920
And they got to two.

148
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:59,040
They made it to two just further than which one is.

149
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,600
They almost opened one in Barcelona, I think.

150
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,760
I was trying to figure it out because I saw a logo for one,

151
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,520
but that did not come to pass.

152
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,280
I found a few references online.

153
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:11,800
People think that it did exist, but I don't think it did.

154
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,560
But that, I guess, was number three.

155
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,040
Did it get like built and then taken over by someone?

156
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:20,120
They just like moved in and yes, it was seized by locals.

157
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,200
Or was it like a sketchy fake?

158
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,560
Oh, maybe.

159
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,320
Like I went to a weird Simpsons bar in Barcelona.

160
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,520
It was definitely not authorized.

161
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,600
What was what happened?

162
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,680
What was going on there?

163
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,320
Just like pictures of the Simpsons on the walls and stuff.

164
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,800
So that dive was like the Austin Powers bar in Glendale.

165
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:45,080
Maybe. Barcelona has no respect for IP law.

166
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,920
I saw I went to the Wax Museum there.

167
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,520
If you're ever in Barcelona, it's fantastic and has a Star Wars room

168
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:55,080
that E.T. is just hanging out in.

169
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,080
Well, but don't forget, E.T.

170
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,920
is a senator or there is a senator.

171
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:04,760
Well, Senator Grebleibs is in the Imperial Senate.

172
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,200
He's in a little one of those discs.

173
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,920
Perfect. Grebleibs, of course, backwards for Spielberg.

174
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,960
Backwards for it.

175
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,440
Oh, boy. Things are falling.

176
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,920
Senator Grebleibs.

177
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:25,800
But we're yeah, we're so I'm excited to talk about Senator Grebleibs namesake.

178
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,520
Even Spielberg.

179
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:34,640
I mean, the I think one thing with these restaurants is it's often where

180
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:37,600
celebrities hit a wall, right?

181
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:42,400
Like they people who think they can achieve anything and have achieved

182
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:47,320
like this. This restaurant was opened at Spielberg's absolute peak.

183
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,240
This was two.

184
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:52,760
The restaurant opened two months after the Academy Awards,

185
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:56,960
where almost every award was won by either Jurassic Park or Schindler's List,

186
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,520
where he won best director for the first time.

187
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,280
So like the highest.

188
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:05,520
Did he plug the restaurant at all in the speeches and the Schindler's List speech?

189
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,000
It was a really solemn.

190
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,840
He was wearing a shirt that said live on the stage.

191
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,760
Do you remember, Beverly, wasn't his Oscar speech

192
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:16,320
This is a cool drink of water after a long drought or something like that.

193
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,840
And maybe he was referring to the water outside of dive.

194
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:19,840
Oh, yeah.

195
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:23,680
Are you trying to subliminally just make us think of water in the air?

196
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,800
Yeah. Wow. Wow.

197
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,960
So he made a subliminal advertising effort and yet it wasn't quite enough.

198
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:34,920
Although I sense that this is a place that was like hot for for a minute.

199
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,920
I don't know.

200
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,080
Did they say Candice Bergen ate there once?

201
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,800
I had an article I read.

202
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:43,800
Yeah, I have a list of celebs that people magazine spotted.

203
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:44,800
Let's hear it.

204
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:50,920
I was there. Henry Winkler, Pierce Brosnan, Tom Hanks, Rob Reiner,

205
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:57,200
Candice Bergen, Warren Beatty, the Olsen twins and Michael Keaton.

206
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:00,200
Wow. Wow. A-listers.

207
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:04,000
It really is crazy that like all these people would eat subs and what?

208
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:08,640
Yes, that is an important thing we have not gotten to yet.

209
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:13,760
The concept was gourmet subs sandwiches.

210
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:17,520
Expensive sit down subs sandwiches.

211
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,360
Yeah. Can I read the quote?

212
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,680
Did you guys find the quote by this dude who worked?

213
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,120
What? What the California Pizza Kitchen did for pizza?

214
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:30,400
We want to do for the submarine sandwich, which I was just saying, I ask,

215
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,320
what did California Pizza Kitchen do?

216
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,520
I looked it up. They put barbecue chicken on it.

217
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,720
That's right. That was their big thing.

218
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:41,720
They stole the idea of doing that from a place, I think, in the Tahunga

219
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,560
village. From Coyote.

220
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:49,000
Well, Chef Ledoux, yeah, I believe was the one who taught Wolfgang

221
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,760
Puck how to make pizzas.

222
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,840
And then he was the executive chef at California Pizza Kitchen.

223
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:57,560
And then Coyote is his little like retirement, you know, cafe restaurant.

224
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:01,280
Oh, I see. In 1985, Ed Ledoux told the L.A. Times,

225
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:04,200
We are at the threshold of a new epoch in pizza dining,

226
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,600
an epoch that will transform convention into invention

227
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,760
and open up an infinite spectrum of pizza possibilities.

228
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:16,320
And when I worked there in the 90s, in the training video

229
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:19,920
that you had to watch to work there, the two owners said,

230
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,760
I remember very vividly, they said, we are the Pied Pipers of pizza.

231
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,560
Something you always want to be like, who is it who called himself

232
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,520
the Pied Piper of R&B?

233
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,720
Oh, yeah, R. Kelly.

234
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:36,640
I guess if that did make pizza something people would go

235
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:40,400
and sit down with their families, it just seems so unlikely for that

236
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,800
to happen with sub sandwiches, which are just like

237
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,360
there's just something about eating a sub, but you have to like hold it

238
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,120
with both hands and like like gnash it like gnaw into it.

239
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,320
It's just like it doesn't look good to eat a sub.

240
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,440
It's not like you don't want to go on a date and like chomp on subs.

241
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,760
Like, yeah, glamorous to eat.

242
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,160
Yeah, yeah, for sure.

243
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,880
It's like what happened, go.

244
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:04,640
Yeah, yeah, construction site construction worker.

245
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:07,520
Yeah, yeah. On the top of a half built building.

246
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,560
That's what the theme should have been. Yeah.

247
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,960
Up on a car.

248
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,680
We're carbs on the way out as well.

249
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,840
I feel like in this era, like we were transitioning from

250
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:18,280
carbo loading to like no carbs for anyone.

251
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:23,760
I feel like low fat was still low fat and like sugar was OK, but fat was bad.

252
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:28,080
So and these are really they were really bready.

253
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:32,480
So no matter where things were at in terms of bread and the conversation,

254
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:35,320
it's they were like they're really bread forward.

255
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:38,640
Here's a here's a like a promotional picture.

256
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:43,840
And I know this is just the like very saturated film of the time.

257
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:47,960
But this is another instance where I'm going to refer to this

258
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:51,400
all looking as looking like disgusting food.

259
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,640
I mean, well documented.

260
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:59,960
I like garbage, but like there's so many details about this place

261
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:04,400
and the menu where I'm just like, oh, man, I don't want to eat that.

262
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:10,440
But imagining Warren Beatty chowing down on the nuclear Sicilian sub Rosa,

263
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,280
I like that.

264
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:15,560
Also, just every time we say sub, like because I'm the thing, it says like

265
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:20,680
dive into a fleet of gourmet submarine sandwiches and then all caps at the SUV.

266
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,240
Substantial salads.

267
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,560
I always read it as sub standard.

268
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,800
Wait, yes.

269
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,840
So it's below.

270
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:34,080
Yeah, I know it also means submarine, but just there's so many words.

271
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,320
Yes, subpar.

272
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:38,160
So like, so did you read?

273
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,760
You guys read about the genesis of this restaurant?

274
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,120
Yeah. Yeah.

275
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:47,680
The origin story with Spielberg and the other person who we have not brought in.

276
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,160
Yes, Senator Greb Niztack.

277
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,240
Also known as Jeffrey Katz.

278
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,160
What is Jeffrey Katzenberg?

279
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,080
Senator Grezmick tacked the character he later put in Shrek.

280
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:03,040
But he, of course, Jeffrey Katzenberg,

281
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,240
at the time, or maybe about to be or on the way of being

282
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:09,160
Spielberg's partner in DreamWorks.

283
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:14,240
And maybe they were they were maybe they were sowing the dream, perhaps together.

284
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,520
Maybe they were like brainstorming what the opening logo should be.

285
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:20,160
Yeah. It's like a kid sitting on a moon chomping on a sub.

286
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,680
Was Katzenberg like coming out of Disney at the time?

287
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,120
Yeah, that would have been around, like when he's like.

288
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,640
So he feels like he knows themed environments real good, right?

289
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,440
Yeah. And I

290
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,600
God, there's so much there's so many things.

291
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,680
I keep thinking like five things to bring up.

292
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:43,920
Probably my I think the best find I found out about this restaurant.

293
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:48,800
There is you can find a video online because again, this is a themed restaurant

294
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,480
like a planned Hollywood style restaurant.

295
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,600
There's a lot of bells and whistles to it.

296
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,560
There's a video online on someone's like portfolio

297
00:15:55,560 --> 00:16:00,840
YouTube page of the kooky video montage that would play this restaurant.

298
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:03,480
Every 45 minutes, every 45 minutes,

299
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:08,840
Zagat Zagat referred to this restaurant as like eating

300
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,480
so many bells and whistles.

301
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,400
It's like eating in a pinball machine.

302
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,480
So there is this very 90s, like super sped up

303
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:23,840
dive footage of like people jumping from high high dives.

304
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:27,760
And then like the camera coming out of a hot tub and there's like a sexy lady.

305
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:34,600
The end credit on this says produced by Bob Weiss Design Island.

306
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:38,920
If that name rings a bell, Bob Weiss is the outgoing president of Walt Disney

307
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,360
Imagineering.

308
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:44,680
Whoa. He oversaw MGM, Disney, MGM Studios. Yeah.

309
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,240
He left Disney Imagineering after overseeing the failed

310
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:54,560
Disney's America project and then came back to oversee the redo of California Adventure.

311
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:59,400
So in the middle there, he started his own design company

312
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:04,800
and apparently helped produce some media materials for Dive.

313
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:09,680
Yeah, yeah. There's like there's universal royalty in this as well.

314
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:12,080
Like it's it is a really stacked lineup.

315
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:15,240
But to take it back to the origin, to the

316
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:18,640
the two the two fathers of dive.

317
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:22,080
I mean, well, feel free to tell it Jason.

318
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,040
I think this was like a New York Times article or an LA Times article.

319
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:29,680
But something there, there Spielberg invited Katzenberg to lunch at his office.

320
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:33,280
To surprise him, Mr. Spielberg asked several assistants

321
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:36,840
to drive around Los Angeles and try to find the best submarine sandwiches.

322
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:39,440
They came back with a dozen or so.

323
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,480
Surprise. We're eating a dozen subs for lunch.

324
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:47,600
As the two moguls began sampling them, they agreed

325
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,360
that the ingredients were too soggy and leathery jokingly.

326
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,360
And then seriously, they began to wonder about opening a restaurant

327
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,480
to restore the credibility of submarine sandwiches

328
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:58,840
or take the food tastes and cravings of the 90s

329
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:02,040
with first rate breads and reinvent the sub sandwich.

330
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:07,800
This was the quote Spielberg said the Sicilian sub should be wetter.

331
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:11,680
So we came back with the idea of marinating the bread to make it juicier.

332
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,240
That sounds terrible.

333
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,240
It's like a French dip.

334
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,120
That's like if you order a French dip wet.

335
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:18,200
I like it. Actually, I do love a French dip wet.

336
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,640
I do, but to do pre wet is kind of weird.

337
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:24,480
I mean, they pre wet it at a Philippe.

338
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,600
What about Jersey Mike?

339
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,120
Should be wetter.

340
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:31,600
Just something describing it as. Yeah, that sounds awful.

341
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,240
Jersey Mike says a wet.

342
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,080
If you get a Mike's Way, it's wet.

343
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,520
It's very like it's soaked.

344
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,800
But I think they aren't calling it.

345
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,200
Mike's Way is like a euphemism, right?

346
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,280
For what? You don't say get it the wet way.

347
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,720
How what you want it here.

348
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,080
Like how what you want it.

349
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,880
Like they don't. Yeah, they don't say wet.

350
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,880
That's oil and vinegar on the inside.

351
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,360
That's different than dipping it into a bowl of oil and vinegar

352
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,880
and then cutting it and looting it up.

353
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,880
OK, that's true. Yeah.

354
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:04,360
And yet, I mean, you shouldn't besmirch these people so much

355
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:07,560
because the people then who they partnered with from the restaurant industry

356
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:11,320
said Stephen and Jeffrey have world class taste buds.

357
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:14,000
Yes. So how could they be wrong?

358
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,440
Are you referring to Larry Levy?

359
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:19,600
Larry Levy. Yeah, he's the guy who quoted was the California Pizza

360
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,960
Kitchen quote I quoted earlier. OK, OK.

361
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:27,720
So the yeah, the Levy's are who they came to to bring this mission to life.

362
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,160
The mission of I'm sorry, what was it?

363
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:32,800
Restoring the credibility of soggy subs.

364
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:41,120
They needed pros to do this.

365
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,880
And they went to this company, the company, the Levy Group,

366
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:47,440
who still operate restaurants in Disney World.

367
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:54,240
And I've never really put this together that really the pre dive.

368
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,560
It's something that we talked about on the show a long time ago.

369
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,800
Would have come up in Pleasure Island with Paul Scheer.

370
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,360
And I know we talked about it, but now I'm feeling like we didn't talk

371
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:06,400
about it enough or meditate on it enough because what probably the, you know,

372
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,160
if a place that's going to do a submarine, that's two stories

373
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:13,280
and exploding with life and sounds and videos,

374
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:16,000
they had to get their feet wet somewhere.

375
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,600
And they did it with a restaurant called the Fireworks Factory,

376
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,800
which was in Pleasure Island in Disney World.

377
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,480
The fireworks factory.

378
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,000
I mean, do you guys recall hearing about this?

379
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:33,680
It was like a the idea was that it was a restored fireworks

380
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:40,320
factory that was still very singed and bricks were loose everywhere.

381
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:45,000
I mean, first of all, I don't are there fireworks factories in reality?

382
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,560
I guess they got to be made somewhere.

383
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:47,240
Yeah, there are.

384
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,560
Oh, yeah. Looking this up. Yeah.

385
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:52,440
Oh, OK. So so there are a lot of disasters

386
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:55,880
throughout history when they explode. Yeah.

387
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:01,200
So a place you want to hang out and do fast casual dining.

388
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,720
Would it blow up like every 45 minutes, like dive would dive?

389
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,800
I'm not sure about that, but it looks it seems like it's set up for that.

390
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:08,880
Like the lighting.

391
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,080
There's bells and whistles.

392
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:13,600
And if I'm remembering correctly, one of the details was like,

393
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,480
you know, the is it what's it called?

394
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,920
Is it a one way mirror or a two way mirror?

395
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,720
Like, you know, on cop shows and stuff.

396
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,080
Two way. Yeah, two way glass.

397
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:25,280
I think so behind the bar, there's what looks like a mirror.

398
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,360
And that is the men's room at the urinals.

399
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:32,000
That's you can look into the bar, but they can't see you dive.

400
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,440
In the fire factory.

401
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,960
I think I've also had weird urinals.

402
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,120
Did you read about that?

403
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,680
No, I don't know about there.

404
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:44,560
Well, much like because I when we did Hard Rock Park, they also had weird urinals.

405
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:48,040
Like that's such a they're all your topics.

406
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:52,440
The urinals were hooked to a giant to giant clear cylinder tubes

407
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,960
that would blast water around when you flushed.

408
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,640
Huh? They would do like a water show when you flushed the urinals.

409
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:01,320
Well, why all these people that have these like

410
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,120
like ill fated ideas for themed entertainment are always like,

411
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:06,720
we got to put a lot of money in the urinal experience.

412
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:07,760
Would you like yell?

413
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,720
Would your pee go up in the pneumatic tube?

414
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,960
Yeah. You watch it go.

415
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:17,040
So you have to make sure you like register your level of hydration or not

416
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,320
so that you know already.

417
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:23,360
I know that pee that's going through right now is exactly how dehydrated my pee was.

418
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,000
It's extra yellow.

419
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,440
Wow. Look at it go.

420
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,160
What a show.

421
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:30,600
The two way mirror is to spy on your girlfriend while you're like,

422
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,080
like, I'm going to the bathroom.

423
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,640
Don't don't like flirt with the waiter.

424
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:38,160
And then you're like watching her while you're peeing

425
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:40,240
and you're just like, she's going to flirt with the waiter.

426
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,640
I know it angrily peeing.

427
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,720
I can she doesn't know I can see her.

428
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:48,040
I'm going to not talk to that guy.

429
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,560
She's laughing a little too hard.

430
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:50,680
You're like, I got to go get out there.

431
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,600
Oh, but I'm not done.

432
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,720
I want to see my pee.

433
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,680
I want to wave goodbye to my pee.

434
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:58,800
I got to watch the show first.

435
00:22:58,800 --> 00:22:59,920
You bitch shit.

436
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,760
Yeah.

437
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:05,480
I was able to confirm it was indeed the fireworks factory

438
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:09,640
had the one way mirror above the urinals on a website.

439
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:12,800
Huh? Just a regular mirror.

440
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:14,800
Oh, no. Sorry.

441
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:15,840
I miss both.

442
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,240
Two way. No, wait. Yeah.

443
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,640
Two way. Yeah.

444
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,800
Whatever the term is.

445
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:20,760
I found it on a website.

446
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,960
It's called Save Pleasure Island.

447
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,840
We must preserve things like this.

448
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,080
Preserve. Yeah.

449
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:26,560
Real quick.

450
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,760
I learned this from watching a Mr.

451
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,160
Moro video yesterday.

452
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:33,240
There's still like thematic narratives around Disney Springs.

453
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,320
Did you know this?

454
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,800
Still backstories stories.

455
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,760
Every building is like a reclaimed.

456
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:38,600
I didn't know this.

457
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,120
There's like a bottling like a fake.

458
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:42,320
It's a fake bottling factory.

459
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,720
That's a bar that kept this alive.

460
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:47,360
But if you want to go to a Talbot's, yeah.

461
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,880
You know that it used to be a place where crayons were made.

462
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,920
Yeah, it's it's like Pleasure Island, but it's like all the explanations

463
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,880
are like much more boring.

464
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,360
It's like, oh, yeah, this bar used to.

465
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,800
We used to make bottles here.

466
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,480
Really? No.

467
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,640
Oh, why do you lie about that?

468
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,680
It's fun.

469
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,480
Is it? Yes, it's good.

470
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,280
We like it.

471
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:12,400
Well, that's a big step down from the backstory of the fireworks factory,

472
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,360
which is that, of course, it was all under then Joe Rody,

473
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,440
I think, responsible for all of these.

474
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:21,120
Merryweather Pleasure

475
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:26,560
was responsible for all of Pleasure Island and rehabilitating these facilities.

476
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:29,680
And so the backstory for first factory

477
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:34,520
is that Merryweather Pleasure persuaded in 1922, persuaded China's

478
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:37,520
premier fireworks inventor to emigrate to Orlando.

479
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,680
Who was the premier fireworks inventor?

480
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,480
Why the Bang Master?

481
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,680
Oh, OK. Bang Master.

482
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,560
Come do your experiments here.

483
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:54,960
Well, I recommend people look up Google, the phrase fireworks factory,

484
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,920
see pictures of that long gone restaurant.

485
00:24:56,920 --> 00:25:00,120
I can't say I recommend people Google the Bang Master.

486
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,160
Do you think it's odd that a guy named Merryweather Pleasure

487
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:07,120
also had a relationship with the Bang Master?

488
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:10,720
Great summit between Mr. Pleasure and the Bang Master.

489
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,640
Geez, Joe Rody.

490
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:18,920
So anyway, just there's so much similar

491
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:24,320
in terms of like a kind of ludicrous theme, two stories, like massive facility,

492
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:28,520
burnt out pretty quickly, crazy themed cocktails and stuff.

493
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:33,960
But the other thing is, I think in terms of design and scope

494
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:39,680
and it feeling very high end 90s theme parky,

495
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:42,600
I think all of these places kind of pulled it off.

496
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:45,520
Like pictures of the fireworks factory look awesome.

497
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:48,400
I love to go there and pictures of dive.

498
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:52,080
I mean, the food doesn't look so great that you were showing us, Jason.

499
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,960
But like the interiors, though.

500
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,480
Yeah, are awesome. I think so.

501
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,400
That was my big takeaway after looking this stuff up.

502
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:03,120
I was like, as much as we're, you know, goofing on it or whatever, I

503
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:06,680
I'm really sad that there's not more stuff like this in the world,

504
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:11,640
just stupid themed things that you go and eat in a submarine or like.

505
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:15,640
Yeah. It as as the physical world has kind of faded.

506
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:19,440
I just miss everything.

507
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,200
Yeah. How much would you love to go to dive right now?

508
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:26,600
And especially whatever in the magical alternate universe

509
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:30,840
where dive survived still in an optimistic view.

510
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,560
There's like seven people in there at any given time.

511
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:38,440
And like, how great would it be to go to an empty two story

512
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:42,560
facility where every single surface is themed?

513
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:48,080
Like everything's got weird little bolts or curved steel or holes in it.

514
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:53,880
I mean, it's like everything's custom and cool in the place, I feel like.

515
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,560
It seems like they miss.

516
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:58,880
They screwed up. It should be a tiki restaurant, right?

517
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:01,120
That's what you would eat in a submarine.

518
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,200
Like you mean like taco.

519
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,920
You're saying like it would have a different like a Polynesian kind of.

520
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:09,040
I thought it was Spielberg's love of the sea.

521
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,880
And then they're like, well, sub and subs.

522
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:15,000
But no, it was the genesis of it was Spielberg and Katzenberg being like,

523
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,240
we got to make a sub sandwich restaurant.

524
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,480
Like seafood or backwards.

525
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:23,480
Yeah, you should eat the food that's named after the thing you're in.

526
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,040
Like that's the weird thinking.

527
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:29,520
That's like the like that's the flaw in the like immersive theming.

528
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:33,680
Yeah, there's so many awful puns on the promotional materials, the menus,

529
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:38,440
the media coverage really went wild with like the sub and like,

530
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:41,840
you know, die, you know, those kinds of puns.

531
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:45,640
Well, then it's weird that it yet came out of this sub thing.

532
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:49,560
And they're trying to, you know, make people excited about subs again.

533
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:53,280
But then the then it's called dive exclamation point,

534
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:57,040
which lends itself more to what Eva's saying, where it's like a that

535
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:59,360
that you think of a dive bar, right?

536
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,200
Like, were they kind of playing with that too?

537
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,600
But it's not the opposite of a dive bar.

538
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:06,560
Yeah. Massive and sprawling and expensive.

539
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:11,040
Well, I'm trying to think of is there like how they did with the Avatar land

540
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:14,280
where basically, you know, they were trying to make the food seem alien.

541
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:17,080
So basically all they did was like pick something that like your dad

542
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:19,720
has not had ever before, like a poke bowl or something.

543
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:22,480
And they're like, look at this thing from fucking Pandora.

544
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,520
Dad, huh?

545
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:26,800
This is alien food. Alien food.

546
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:29,080
Like, I don't know if anyone

547
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:36,560
for Mark, Tom, the hell of a synthetic alien food anywhere in America.

548
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,800
It's like noodles that you don't can't get at the grocery store.

549
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,120
Yeah. So it's like, I don't even know if there was a

550
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:46,000
was there any restaurant that was doing like kind of that thing

551
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,240
where they would just like repurpose some food and make it act like

552
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:51,200
it might look maybe diet a color.

553
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,720
Trying to think now.

554
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,160
Yeah, I don't think I can't think of one.

555
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:59,480
It's just yeah, because you could do like they should have done.

556
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:04,080
I mean, this is looked I wish this was all Sequest DSV themed also.

557
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:07,000
Because this gets mentioned that that's right around that time.

558
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,440
It's right around the time Spielberg is he's got dive mania.

559
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,200
He wants everything underwater.

560
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:17,200
His TV show that was like a star truck underwater, but it was in the future.

561
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:21,200
So they could have done an episode where their submarine

562
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,960
encountered like the future version of the dive restaurant,

563
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:27,320
which was on a real sub and just people are eating and they like go

564
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:29,240
and they sample all the menu items.

565
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,120
And yeah, and then like, yeah.

566
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,640
Dolphin watches people eat dolphin.

567
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:40,400
Registered his his feelings about that, and then they have to talk to him.

568
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,520
Yeah, they should have done that.

569
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:45,080
Yeah, there was promotional material.

570
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:45,480
Yes.

571
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:52,880
My darling, do you do you think that the solution is leaning into Sequest DSV more

572
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:56,000
the runaway success of Sequest?

573
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,040
Well, some press releases were like Steven Spielberg has been

574
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:01,800
obsessed with deep sea diving from a very young age.

575
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,360
And I was like, what? Since when? No, James Cameron.

576
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,720
No, I don't know who you're talking about.

577
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:10,760
Nope, it's Spielberg, I'm afraid.

578
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:13,400
What Roy Scheider was in that show, right?

579
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:16,080
Yeah. And he was also in Jaws.

580
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:20,400
Did they reference Jaws in that show that he's like, I hope there are no sharks this deep.

581
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,720
Oh, my God. They must have. Right.

582
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,080
It's an episode.

583
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:27,440
He would turn to the camera and look right into camera.

584
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,600
We're going to need a bigger sea.

585
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,080
Jonathan Brand is too.

586
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:35,360
Yes. Very good on Sequest.

587
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,560
Yeah. So I don't know.

588
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:40,680
I in my in my heart, I want it to be Sequest themed.

589
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:44,200
But I understand why they didn't want to maybe I don't know.

590
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:47,440
I was trying to say I was going to say they were going to tarnish one of the brands

591
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:50,160
with associating with the other, but I wasn't sure which one.

592
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,120
I guess Sequest was on for a couple of years.

593
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:54,440
So it might have made Sequest get canceled quicker.

594
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:56,040
Yeah. What could have happened? Right.

595
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:59,880
So submarine Sam, I just can't get my head around this.

596
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:02,160
The worst combination of stuff.

597
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,720
It's really crazy to be serving because I saw like

598
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:07,720
the picture Jason held up had like a blue drink.

599
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:11,360
Like, it's like it's just it's just be eating some like fried

600
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,280
shrimps and some little ribs.

601
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:16,000
Yeah. And some drinking some blue drinks in the submarine.

602
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:21,720
And then eventually they did like spruce up the menu a little and add like the most more.

603
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:25,880
I mean, this is all this the era of like TGI Fridays and Ruby Tuesdays.

604
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,520
They're at their height and stuff.

605
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:32,640
So it's all like upscale bar food was the thing that's that mention of like

606
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,240
very good bread.

607
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:38,040
I think in the 80s and 90s, like La Brea Bakery was so huge,

608
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:42,040
like made such a big impression and for both the bakery itself

609
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:44,280
and then supplying a lot of L.A. restaurants.

610
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:46,880
So I think that that all was just in the air.

611
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,920
It's like, yeah, people might have still been eating quite a lot of bread.

612
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,800
We want the breadiest shit.

613
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,960
Much bread.

614
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,200
What they're down is something wet bread,

615
00:31:56,560 --> 00:32:01,320
sopping bread and then and then sop up more with a blue,

616
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,360
a giant blue drink.

617
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:06,240
That's the combo that doesn't add up to me.

618
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:10,960
And doesn't that that photo, Jason, also have a sigh?

619
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:14,760
I feel like they would come with fries, but then there's also like a weird like

620
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,520
like chicken salad looking thing.

621
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:20,200
Oh, there is a salad, a substantial salad.

622
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:24,400
It's the fries with the dipping sauces, one of which was pesto cream.

623
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:27,360
And I think I've had that before, but just the phrase maybe gag.

624
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:32,080
Like the cocktail menu there,

625
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:36,560
I couldn't find a good scan of the full sub menu.

626
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:38,400
I kept finding one that was cut off.

627
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:41,160
I have something, I think. Yeah, yeah.

628
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,240
OK, are you going to go?

629
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,320
Yeah, sure. Let's see.

630
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:49,160
Polaris punch, a refreshing blend of smirnoff, vodka, fruit juice and lemonade.

631
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,560
Oh, no, this is the one I did. The cocktail menu I found.

632
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,160
Oh, OK, OK. Oh, sure, sure.

633
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:55,400
Throw out one throw out ones you dig.

634
00:32:55,560 --> 00:33:00,200
Well, the one that sticks out to me, I keep reading.

635
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,440
I can't find mine.

636
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:06,760
And the let's see, tropical torpedo, peach daiquiri and pina colada

637
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:11,200
with a burst of peach schnapps, Picardy dark rum, Midori melon liquor

638
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,640
blended with fruit juices.

639
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,760
I mean, I hate all of that.

640
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,080
These are all I don't want.

641
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:17,960
I want as little juice as possible, I'd say.

642
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:21,280
Quote on the drink menu.

643
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:24,520
Down the hatch attributed to WC Field.

644
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:28,000
I invent that.

645
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,160
I'm sure he said that.

646
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,040
I'm sure he said that.

647
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:33,560
But I'm sure we've all said that in some form.

648
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:35,920
And where does that fit into the theme?

649
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:38,080
I guess because a hatch on a submarine.

650
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,640
Is that a thing on a submarine?

651
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:41,760
Yeah, hatch. Yeah, that's how you get in and out of it.

652
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:42,560
Well, there you go.

653
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,760
Did WC Field's drown?

654
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,520
How did he die?

655
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:50,720
Why? Why do they call it sea level drinks spelled S E E?

656
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,680
There's a lot of that on the menu.

657
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:55,360
The sea, S E E, like you got to see dive.

658
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,200
You got to see these level drinks.

659
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,160
You got to see them.

660
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:01,360
There's a lot of like sub stuff and then it's called dive.

661
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:06,280
But then there's like the kind of the tagline of it is deep sea experience.

662
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,880
And sea is spelled S E E.

663
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,200
Why? I don't know.

664
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:11,800
And there's periods after all of those.

665
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:15,720
Right. End of sentence deep and sea and experience.

666
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,920
Oh, I see. It's like but it does it doesn't make sense.

667
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:21,880
But it would be like sea here experience.

668
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:26,000
It's like you do these things at dive, but deep is not a thing you can do.

669
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:26,800
It's not a verb.

670
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,960
So it kind of works as its own sentence, but deep does not.

671
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:31,640
Deep, you know, go deep.

672
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:32,560
Yeah, yeah, well, that works.

673
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,880
But you can't just say deep.

674
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:36,200
But deep sea is a phrase.

675
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,840
Sea experience is not.

676
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:39,640
I've had a sea experience.

677
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:41,280
You can have a deep experience.

678
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,800
Yeah, you wouldn't be like a deep.

679
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,160
You don't have a sea.

680
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:48,640
You wouldn't call it a deep visual experience.

681
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:49,640
You can say sea.

682
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:51,040
Yeah, there are definite.

683
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:53,000
You see the definitions, though.

684
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,160
I have the definition of the word.

685
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:58,120
There's codes on the menu for these three words.

686
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:00,360
Oh, yeah.

687
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:04,440
So deep means a mind state excluding matters of irrelevance.

688
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:10,880
Sea means visual sensory stimulus or a sustained flash of understanding

689
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,200
and experience.

690
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,240
You know, it doesn't.

691
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:14,440
What do you mean?

692
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,560
Hold on. Hold on.

693
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:19,720
One more. It's something experience, a fully awakened state of complete

694
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:21,160
sensory stimulus.

695
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:24,400
Now it sounds like a fucking cult.

696
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:28,960
I can almost guarantee you, Jeffrey Katzenberg wrote this

697
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:33,400
just from like studying his crazy brain.

698
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:37,720
And like there's so much his life, there's so much stuff that just like kind of

699
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:40,120
makes no sense that he just like gets an idea.

700
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,960
And sometimes it really works and sometimes it really doesn't.

701
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:47,000
But like this all has that ring to it of that like logic that's just like what

702
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,360
what brain came up with this?

703
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,520
It doesn't really make sense.

704
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,280
The gallons and gallons of diet,

705
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:54,680
cokey drinks just destroying his cerebral cortex.

706
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,920
He's a diet coke guy.

707
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:57,720
Oh, he's a diet.

708
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:01,160
There's multiple diet coke stories in the Disney War Book.

709
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:01,880
Wow.

710
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:04,440
And like breakfast, multiple breakfasts.

711
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:07,680
Did he have breakfast at dive three times a day?

712
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,080
Oh, he does.

713
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:09,920
He do that now.

714
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:10,800
He's a multi.

715
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,960
He's a diet coke guy, a multi breakfast guy.

716
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:17,360
And if the Quibi offices are to be believed, a big jars of candy.

717
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,320
So many jars there.

718
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,840
Yeah, he's a treat boy.

719
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,440
Well, that's what's wrong with that.

720
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:26,040
Do you think he had P.A.'s go and get like takeout from dive every day

721
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:30,120
for his meal, maybe put money back into the business?

722
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,040
Yeah, people.

723
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:34,280
The story that sticks out to me when he needed somewhere to lie low,

724
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:37,760
but didn't want to go too far from his Burbank office, he had someone meet him

725
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,800
at the restaurant at Providence St.

726
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,880
Joe's Hospital.

727
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:46,480
Across the street, maybe at the cafe in the hospital that Walt died in.

728
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:50,680
So he's a hospital food guy, too.

729
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:54,960
Yeah. And all of this taste came together to start a restaurant.

730
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:59,880
Wow. There's no rumor that can be started if you're spotted in a hospital cafeteria.

731
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,960
Very powerful, famous man.

732
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,880
That's definitely where you want to quote, lie low.

733
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:08,360
He might have been it might have been he might have been in the middle

734
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:12,360
of the lawsuit and he needed Frank Well, or he needed someone from the lot,

735
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:14,080
but he couldn't get back on the lot.

736
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:16,480
So he's like, meet me in the hospital across the street.

737
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:20,400
I think Katzenberg's dying.

738
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,440
Or he went to kill a rifle.

739
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:25,920
Maybe he was a syringe in somebody's neck.

740
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:29,560
There's two things on the cocktail menu that stand out.

741
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:31,200
The ocean motion margarita.

742
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,640
The description says, oh, it's blue.

743
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:36,480
Our special recipe uses only the best.

744
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:39,800
Jose Cuero at Aquila with a splash of blue curacao.

745
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,200
Oh, it's blue is what Mike says any time he orders any drink.

746
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:47,680
I think Scott says boo, it's blue.

747
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:50,920
Well, yeah, when we had to drink from the big bucket at Tall at the Moon,

748
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:52,880
you got a big blue bucket.

749
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,560
Disgusting.

750
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:58,800
The other thing of note on the cocktail menu to me, the two tone torpedo,

751
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,720
a blend of any of the above frozen drinks.

752
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:06,760
The captain's favorite is our ocean blue margarita layered with Polaris punch.

753
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:12,320
Hang on. So these we've been reading these recipes that all have seven ingredients.

754
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:15,560
And then the final drink is just throw in two of them together.

755
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:16,800
Any two.

756
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:20,720
You have a suicide of just all the all the shit.

757
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,680
Now, I'll tell you from personal experience, I once ordered at a bar

758
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:28,280
a drink that was half pina colada and half strawberry daiquiri.

759
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,600
And that was a classic stomach ache.

760
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:32,760
Previous stomach ache.

761
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:35,760
That's called a lava flow. That is an existing drink. Yes.

762
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,480
So I can't recommend that.

763
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:43,320
But right above the two tone torpedo is a drink called the Antarctic cappuccino,

764
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,600
which is all coffee liqueurs.

765
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:48,240
So you got to think that some lunatic was there.

766
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:51,440
And he's like, give me the frozen lemonade with the cappuccino.

767
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,400
Mix them up for me.

768
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,160
Let me say this really quick.

769
00:38:57,160 --> 00:39:00,440
One thing we haven't said is where this this location was.

770
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:02,440
It was in the Century City Mall.

771
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:07,360
Like on the same level, there's a big AMC over there.

772
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,160
If people might know it, if you're in L.A.,

773
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:11,920
hopefully it's a place you avoid if you're in L.A.

774
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:15,920
It's like the worst parking scenario, maybe of any mall around here.

775
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:20,480
But I I went I definitely went when I was a kid.

776
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,920
I remember my dad taking me and my sister.

777
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:27,200
And I just saw my dad and asked if he had any memories.

778
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,360
I said, because you took me there, right?

779
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,920
He said, yeah, I went there with you guys.

780
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:34,240
And then I went there with George. George what?

781
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:38,120
And George is a really like super drunk friend of my dad.

782
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:42,360
And I said, wait, you went to you went to this crazy restaurant without your kids.

783
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:45,640
And he said, yeah, I was working out in Century City.

784
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:49,720
And I met George because I'd loaned him a bunch of money

785
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,680
for a business that went south.

786
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:56,760
He was paying me back for my she managed to get money to pay me back.

787
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,840
So I all right, here you go, Kent.

788
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,400
I started didn't work out.

789
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,480
Hey, shots on me. Right.

790
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:07,520
And my dad did a bunch of shots at the dive bar at the dive bar.

791
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:10,360
And he was on the clock. He was working.

792
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:15,040
He had like a plate, like a like some formal conference room thing to go do.

793
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,920
And he showed up an hour late and super drunk

794
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:20,240
because he's doing shots at the dive bar.

795
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,680
Liquid lunch, baby, liquid lunch and dive.

796
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:27,400
George said, did you did you like you're not a shots person, are you?

797
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:28,920
He said, no, never.

798
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:32,080
So one of the only places my dad ever did shots in his life

799
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:35,480
was dive. I got to say, pretty proud of my dad.

800
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:40,760
Drunk at work because of like and with like if he was there for two hours,

801
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:43,920
I might have been enough times for to get three dives.

802
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,400
Yeah, you saw three dives. Yeah.

803
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:48,000
Oh yeah. And we have we actually does everyone that we haven't really talked

804
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,360
about exactly what would happen every 45 minutes.

805
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:52,920
We should talk. Yeah. I have a video also, if you want.

806
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:55,640
But should we say a little bit and then and then experience the video

807
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:57,240
from in the restaurant or the. Yes.

808
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:58,840
What Jason is referring to that video.

809
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:01,200
I watched that video. That video is crazy.

810
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:03,440
Yeah, I wrote.

811
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:06,640
I watched very similar to like the Nickelodeon promos

812
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,920
where it was just old stock footage sped up.

813
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:13,160
There's a lot of stock footage that has nothing to do with submarines

814
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:15,600
or diving or anything that it's just like that.

815
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:19,640
Yeah, that 90s like I wrote lots of screaming alarms, panic stock footage

816
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:22,760
that has nothing to do with subs ends with surf and safari.

817
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:28,720
Yes, there's there's another one that I only saw this describe it and watch it.

818
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:32,800
There's only this one documented, but like this one, like it was always that

819
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:37,520
this the submarine because OK, so just to paint this all over the restaurant,

820
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:41,680
our video screen, so many like next to almost every table

821
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:45,200
is a separate video screen with porthole stuff in front of it.

822
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:49,200
And then a giant video wall, which is wonderful, with a big

823
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,840
Panasonic logo on it.

824
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:54,880
And I remember this. Yeah, it happened a lot.

825
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,680
This the dive.

826
00:41:56,680 --> 00:42:01,920
My memory of it going as a kid, all I can remember is like dive, dive, dive.

827
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:04,640
Right. You hear a guy scream, dive, dive, dive

828
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:06,840
every 45 minutes and then just like,

829
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:11,280
like crazy sirens.

830
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:15,600
Like the last thing you would want to happen in a restaurant.

831
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:18,560
Oh, man, George has just has to stop apologizing.

832
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:25,960
Your dad and George just quietly nod at each other.

833
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:27,520
We were to be over.

834
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,320
Sorry again about the business.

835
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:31,160
Sorry for picking this place.

836
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:32,560
He's holding up like one moment.

837
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:33,920
It's over. I'll keep it going.

838
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:35,800
Keep talking. One second here.

839
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,000
Hold that thought.

840
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,840
Dive, dive, dive.

841
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:42,520
George thinks it's just like his own emotional projection.

842
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:44,840
Like he's the only one who can see it.

843
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:47,280
He said no man has sunk lower than George.

844
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:53,720
This might feel like I'm like I was hallucinating

845
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:55,560
at this restaurant was a submarine.

846
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:57,280
I'm not doing too well.

847
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:58,680
George ain't doing too good.

848
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:01,840
George's business, failed business, was another submarine restaurant.

849
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:06,360
That must have really stung to do that meeting there.

850
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:08,400
Yeah. So I just don't know what happened.

851
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,720
I don't know why it didn't.

852
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:12,280
Oh, wait a second.

853
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:16,080
All right. Here's your shot.

854
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:20,760
It's a layer of blue curacao, layer, half and half layer of cutty sark scotch.

855
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:23,400
Good luck.

856
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:25,680
Dive, dive, dive, dive.

857
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:33,920
So this dive sequence that would play the idea is that like you're in a submarine,

858
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:36,960
but you're not on some set trajectory or any.

859
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:39,080
There's no like place that you're heading.

860
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:43,600
So it would always the submarine would always pop up in somewhere unexpected and kooky.

861
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:48,320
I think it seems very inspired by the naked gun sequence

862
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:52,880
where there's the you're looking at the hood of the police car and the siren in front of it.

863
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:57,920
And it's going in places that a car would not be like a water slide or Jurassic Park or whatever.

864
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:00,560
Seems like completely maybe a rip off of that.

865
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:04,800
Yeah. I might say so it was like it would pop up and then you're like in a jacuzzi

866
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:11,560
with a supermodel or something or like and they would try to do little puns out of what

867
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:13,080
like the song that played.

868
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:19,760
So like it would surface some of you hear a voice say, Captain, what do you see?

869
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:21,120
And then it would play.

870
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:24,360
I can see clearly now the rain is.

871
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:29,480
Yeah. Did it ever provoke anything other than that?

872
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:30,840
Oh, yeah.

873
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:32,000
Can't imagine.

874
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:37,680
But you'd pause eating your fat, sopping wet sandwich to be like, oh,

875
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:45,160
damn it. Little little Tommy, finish your soft shell crab so you can get out of here.

876
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:46,680
That is the menu.

877
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:49,400
The sandwich menu. All the coverage emphasizes like.

878
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:52,360
And of course, they have the classic Italian sub and turkey sub.

879
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:57,760
But then they've got like a Southern fried chicken sub and a soft so shell crab sub

880
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:01,760
and a chicken fajita sub. And I'm like, no, I don't.

881
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:07,680
I mean, that's what they mean with the CPK thing is like, yeah, here's like here's a Chinese one

882
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:09,520
and a Mexican one.

883
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:12,680
They're covering genres within a food genre.

884
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:17,640
Because one of the things that Spago when Wolfgang Puck started doing pizzas that was real big

885
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:22,120
was like a locks pizza was like a layer of cream cheese smoked salmon.

886
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:25,720
They still have it. They'll deliver it to you on DoorDash right now.

887
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:28,160
Whether you want it or not.

888
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:30,760
If you open the app, it just comes.

889
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:34,520
Let me just play the mania of this for a second.

890
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:37,040
Just so so Eva gets to see it.

891
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:37,960
Here's what. All right.

892
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:41,480
So every 45 minutes, which we should do within the episode, let's just.

893
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:45,400
It's like 45 minutes exactly. Whoa.

894
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:48,920
It's crazy. 45. All right, here we go.

895
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:55,160
So there's something strange on the surface.

896
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:57,440
Prepare the service. Clear the bridge.

897
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:01,360
Clear the bridge. Clear the bridge.

898
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:15,240
What the. Sir, what do you see?

899
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:18,320
Not certain, men. Let's head in for a closer look.

900
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:26,360
The submarine was that was it was in a pool.

901
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:29,840
Like a lady doing a foam roller, but in a hot tub.

902
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:33,560
And then she starts knocking the periscope with the foam roller.

903
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:37,320
And then they play other footage of people getting knocked around.

904
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:41,360
Three stooges. This is like in a 60s movie when someone

905
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:43,960
takes bad LSD.

906
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:47,120
And that's how you like show that Jack Nicholson is like

907
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:49,240
freaking out.

908
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:53,280
And it's like very like, like unpleasant.

909
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:54,760
Yeah, that was half of it.

910
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:58,920
I didn't even make it halfway through the full video before wanting to bail.

911
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:03,120
Yeah. And so that happened every 45 minutes in this place.

912
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:05,360
Really loud, like cranked up.

913
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:07,200
My dad also said, I remember it was dark.

914
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:08,800
It's really dark in there, too.

915
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:12,240
It must have been someone who loved the food and just hated all the

916
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:13,080
food.

917
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:15,720
Like I had to get rid of the riff riff.

918
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:21,360
Take a look at the the dive ghost kitchen or like dive has delivery

919
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:25,040
like during the like the first early months of 2020 pandemic,

920
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:29,560
where everyone's like, we do delivery now, like take out dive cocktails.

921
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:30,760
They would have done Chuck E.

922
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:32,760
Cheese, I feel like, and made up a fake name.

923
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:35,600
Didn't you guys do you guys see that one of the Simpsons writers

924
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:37,840
said that they would get takeout from dive?

925
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:42,200
They made a list of like the top, like the top takeout in the 90s.

926
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:46,920
And one of them was just like they really know because it's

927
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:49,000
a lot right there. Yeah.

928
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,640
That's a really funny thing to do.

929
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:52,760
You know, maybe. Yeah, that sounds familiar.

930
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:55,160
OK, OK. Wow. That's pretty cool.

931
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:59,160
Only eating it without the deep sea experience.

932
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:04,000
Well, the Simpsons, I would I think it's not explicitly said,

933
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,520
but you have to think that the Simpsons

934
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:11,800
parodied this in a way with season finale, season nine.

935
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:14,280
Natural Born Kissers is the episode.

936
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:19,320
There is a restaurant that is a plane that they shake around like crazy.

937
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:23,360
Like Homer and Marge are trying to have a romantic anniversary dinner.

938
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:25,960
Grandpa drops out, so they need a sitter.

939
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:28,760
And but then Barney used to say, no, we know a place.

940
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:31,840
And they go to a place that's just a crowded airplane

941
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:35,600
where they come on the PA, say the Simpsons name wrong

942
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:39,440
and then shake the plane wildly and all the contents

943
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:41,360
of the overhead spill all over everybody.

944
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:44,520
So I would have to think that is a parody.

945
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,600
You just went to a plane restaurant in Palm Springs.

946
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:49,480
Yeah. Oh, yes.

947
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:52,800
Air in the in the back of a liquor store in Palm Springs,

948
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:55,240
there's a airplane themed bar

949
00:48:55,640 --> 00:49:00,280
that does a Saturday night like floor show with naughty stewardesses

950
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:03,000
where you crash at the end.

951
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,320
Yeah. And I don't know, maybe.

952
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:08,600
But I went I didn't want to sit and do it because it's Omicron.

953
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,560
I didn't want to do a full indoor thing,

954
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:11,800
but I did go in and get a drink there.

955
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:13,360
And it was really funny.

956
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:16,080
It was just it was like you go through the back of this wine shop.

957
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:18,400
You open a door and you're just in like a plane.

958
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:22,800
And then they you sit in like uncomfortable plane seats.

959
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:24,960
Do they like sing or like? Yeah, they they do.

960
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:28,320
There's like music and they were warming up the like singing

961
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:29,560
when I was there. Wow.

962
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:31,240
And and then you drink.

963
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:32,120
They have like a brunch.

964
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:34,880
They have like a bottomless mimosa brunch.

965
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:37,920
Any other time, I would do the full thing.

966
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:39,840
Yeah, but not not right now.

967
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:42,080
But everybody go.

968
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:45,480
Is it is it interesting to be on a fake plane?

969
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:46,560
I was so happy.

970
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:50,000
I mean, I like I was just in bad themed environment.

971
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:52,840
Like you look out the window and one of them had just Superman,

972
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,360
like Christopher Reeve, Superman flying at the plane.

973
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:59,080
Oh, yeah. And the flying nun, you sent a picture with one of the Orioles.

974
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:01,920
What a reference to Paul.

975
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:04,080
Yeah. How many rows of seats on the fake plane?

976
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:06,920
Probably like 20.

977
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:08,080
And some of them were facing each other.

978
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:10,080
So, you know, there's like two with a little table in the middle.

979
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:11,680
Right. They still were airplane seats.

980
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:13,280
Yeah. So it was authentic.

981
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:15,880
Yeah. Not comfortable.

982
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:19,840
Oh, by the way, also, when you're picturing

983
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:24,560
George and his hard luck and with my dad doing shots,

984
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:29,520
this is all happening on the bar stools are torpedoes.

985
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:34,880
They're like very industrial looking torpedoes with like a target top.

986
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:37,920
Like the I don't know if it's a cushion or a hard top.

987
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:39,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. Yeah.

988
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:43,800
But is the your butthole is the missile

989
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:48,120
or it's where they launch their missile is pointing at.

990
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:50,040
Yeah, great.

991
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:54,120
I'll say this, if you're the dive is surprisingly well documented

992
00:50:55,000 --> 00:51:00,160
and there's a great collection of like the the high end promotional pictures.

993
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:01,960
Well, I thought you were talking about these books.

994
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:05,240
I have these crazy coffee table books by Martin Pegler.

995
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:07,800
Oh, it's called theme restaurant design.

996
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,880
Well, that is called cafes and coffee shops.

997
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:13,920
And these are these are wonderful.

998
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:17,720
These were when I was really pining for crazy themed environments

999
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:20,080
in the darkest days of the pandemic.

1000
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:21,560
These books did a lot for me.

1001
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:23,440
Dive is on the cover of one of them.

1002
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:27,840
Vegas dive, which will move on to take a look if you want.

1003
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:31,080
I don't want to distract, but they're here for your perusing.

1004
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:34,360
My library is always open.

1005
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:37,440
But there's like, I mean, if when you light it right

1006
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:42,000
and don't have any knuckleheads eaten in here, when it's just an empty restaurant,

1007
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,200
it looks beautiful. Yeah.

1008
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:49,440
So if you buddy listeners, if you go to Twitter, the user Evan Collins,

1009
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:50,960
we've mentioned him on the show before.

1010
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:55,400
He's very good at collecting these kinds of pictures and and themed

1011
00:51:55,760 --> 00:52:00,040
restaurants or design theme design, all kinds of design in one place.

1012
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:03,240
He has a great thread on dive where you can see all the interiors

1013
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:06,000
and the disgusting food photo

1014
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,720
and some of the like merchandise.

1015
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:10,440
I mean, the merchandise that that's a big thing that

1016
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:14,960
there's a mental floss article they were speculating one of dives.

1017
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:17,920
One of the undoings, they say,

1018
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:21,760
themed restaurants, some of them,

1019
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:25,080
some restaurants were seeing 50 percent of the revenue

1020
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:27,880
from the sales of like merchandise and stuff.

1021
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:31,760
But with dive in the first year of operation in California,

1022
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:35,960
dive made just 15 percent of its gross sales on souvenirs.

1023
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:40,360
That's a big and we'll find this with other restaurants will do in this month

1024
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:43,600
that it's so caked in that you have to be buying.

1025
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:47,600
In addition to your expensive meal, you have to be buying really expensive

1026
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:51,600
merchandise in order to make this worth it, which I think it's all seemingly

1027
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:56,840
ripping off the original long ago out of date notion that coming back

1028
00:52:56,840 --> 00:53:01,240
from the Hard Rock Cafe in London with a shirt is cool.

1029
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:05,280
But that stopped being cool when there's a thousand Hard Rock Cafes

1030
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:07,760
and the restaurants bad planet Hollywood.

1031
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:11,400
There was kind of some like cache to the merch a little bit.

1032
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:15,480
But the dive logo, well, I like the the design of the place.

1033
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:17,440
The logo is bad, I feel.

1034
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:19,200
Anybody agree, disagree?

1035
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:22,240
Thoughts on the logo? Yeah, it's very like nine.

1036
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:24,520
It's very 90s in like a bad way.

1037
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:27,160
Yeah, it's like a CD-ROM game. Yeah.

1038
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:31,160
Font and yes, you don't want merch of that, I don't think.

1039
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,160
I kind of want the merch.

1040
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:36,920
There's a little plush toy of a happy little submarine.

1041
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:40,040
Oh, oh, how much?

1042
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:40,840
That's cute.

1043
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:44,360
Next to the sexy dive one piece bathing suit.

1044
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:49,720
There's you can get like a shirt on eBay for like 13 dollars

1045
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:51,600
with just a little dive insignia.

1046
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:54,680
OK, OK. And there's a dive hat you can have for like 20 bucks.

1047
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:58,760
I wish George had been trying to pay your dad back and like merch.

1048
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:01,800
Yeah, it's a dive watch.

1049
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:03,840
That's pretty funny. It's a dive watch.

1050
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:06,760
Years from now, you hand this to your kids.

1051
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:09,120
This is their college fun right here.

1052
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:11,480
Please help me out, Kentie.

1053
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:14,680
You got to help hold George.

1054
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:16,840
Oh, I got to go to the bathroom.

1055
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:20,800
Did your dad wind up beating him up?

1056
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:24,920
George goes to the bathroom, looks through the two way mirror,

1057
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:26,480
watches your dad.

1058
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:30,400
See if your dad is mad at him.

1059
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:32,440
He's cutting a business deal with a new guy.

1060
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:36,000
They used to be me.

1061
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:39,680
I went to throw up, but then my urine splashed in my face

1062
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:43,040
in a colorful display.

1063
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:46,000
For 50 dollars, you can get a dive polo shirt.

1064
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:48,000
Oh, and now.

1065
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:51,360
Yeah, yeah. I think it's like it's from the somebody in the UK has it.

1066
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,120
And it's it's you can buy it now.

1067
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:57,560
We're all going to end up with some dive cramps.

1068
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:02,560
I could buy it now and it was 56 dollars would go out of my account

1069
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:06,200
and I would own a dive polo shirt.

1070
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:08,320
It's a good way to think about buying things.

1071
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:13,560
I wish I was I could conceptualize money that way more often.

1072
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:15,120
There's a brochure.

1073
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:16,400
I won't have it anymore.

1074
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:17,400
Yeah. You know what?

1075
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:18,960
I will have this shirt.

1076
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:21,360
I don't want it to be replaced by this.

1077
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:22,840
There's I don't know if you guys saw this, too.

1078
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:24,600
Did you see? Did you have the dive gear?

1079
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:26,520
Yeah. The list.

1080
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:27,840
Yeah. Of what you could buy. Yeah.

1081
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:28,880
No. Did you see this?

1082
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:30,960
OK, so my phone hopefully won't die here.

1083
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:35,240
But you can see there's like shirts and hats and like bucket hats.

1084
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:39,160
And then I feel like Spielberg, I associate having like

1085
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:42,640
I don't know how to I guess like a Letterman style jacket.

1086
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:45,240
You know, he would wear in the 90s, kind of like a putties,

1087
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:46,880
eight ball jacket on Seinfeld.

1088
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:50,040
You could get like a dive Spielberg jacket.

1089
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:52,320
Oh, yeah. I want that. Yeah.

1090
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:53,800
That's a great jacket.

1091
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:55,160
That must have been so expensive.

1092
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:56,920
It looks like a couple of these different colors.

1093
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:59,560
That actually looks like a wrap present, like something

1094
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:01,800
they give the crew of like a crew jacket.

1095
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:05,720
Oh, there's there's also like a sleeveless kind of

1096
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:07,560
probably did when the restaurant wrapped.

1097
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:14,440
Did they get did they do full like taps

1098
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:16,280
when they had to shut the restaurant down?

1099
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:18,640
Did they do a full military?

1100
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:20,040
Lower the mast.

1101
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:22,160
That's a funny way to gaslight your employees.

1102
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:25,240
It's like, wait, you mean we're all fired?

1103
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:29,520
No, you know, restaurants wraps the Hollywood.

1104
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:32,000
We say that's a wrap showbiz.

1105
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:36,960
The funniest thing actually, though, is that you could buy a dive denim vest.

1106
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:39,120
Oh, cool.

1107
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:41,760
Huge dive logo on the back.

1108
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:46,360
That's my dad has a plan, an old planet Hollywood denim jacket

1109
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:48,080
with the logo on the back.

1110
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:50,240
And I'm so jealous.

1111
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:52,160
It's a family heirloom.

1112
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:55,760
Dive saw you can save money on denim material by cutting the arms off.

1113
00:56:57,720 --> 00:57:01,160
See, they were canny about some things.

1114
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:05,280
I found another unpleasant food thing I wanted to highlight.

1115
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:09,480
I don't think it would be awful to eat, but just the phrasing

1116
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:15,640
of cold angel hair pasta with peppers, scallions and spicy sesame dressing.

1117
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:19,440
And like the biggest all caps.

1118
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:25,760
It just says cold angel hair pasta like guys do another pass on this weird menu.

1119
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:28,280
What is going on?

1120
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:31,800
There's a non alcoholic drink that's like pina colada, strawberry

1121
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:34,440
daiquiri and different chocolate add ins.

1122
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:37,160
And I was like, oh, too much.

1123
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:40,160
Yeah. What are bathyspheres?

1124
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:45,680
OK, they have the I did look at up to the those circular submarine submersible.

1125
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:47,560
Yeah. Summary.

1126
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:50,680
It's like a name of a real practical like what is it?

1127
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:52,000
What's the food version?

1128
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,520
I couldn't figure that out. We don't know.

1129
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:55,120
We don't have an answer for that.

1130
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:55,640
Wait a minute.

1131
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:59,360
Those that that salad I was talking about comes in a weird little pod

1132
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:03,160
that looks like they like put some big cabbage leaves together.

1133
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:07,000
And is that are those is that supposed to be the food version?

1134
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,720
Like a little like hard to say.

1135
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:11,840
I think it's just a deep 90s ass bowl.

1136
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:16,960
Hmm. Am I am I crazy to think that it's that it is cabbage?

1137
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:17,840
That that's like an edit.

1138
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:20,160
Like you could eat the side of that like a bread.

1139
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:21,720
I would believe that it might.

1140
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:22,960
Oh, maybe.

1141
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:24,520
Wait, I see something on a plate.

1142
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:27,520
Yeah, maybe bathyspheres are just bread bowls.

1143
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:29,520
Well, it might be.

1144
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:30,480
Hmm. Yeah.

1145
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:35,000
So they are bread just in the bowl, just wet meat.

1146
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:42,680
Any sub is available in a bowl for can kill a bread bowl.

1147
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:45,400
Can we play a quick souvenir smackdown for how much

1148
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:47,640
some of these items cost at the time?

1149
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:48,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1150
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:49,520
OK. Oh, back then.

1151
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:51,200
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1152
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:54,160
OK. OK. So there are.

1153
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,320
This will just be the jackets.

1154
00:58:56,320 --> 00:58:58,760
We'll just talk about there are many versions of the jackets.

1155
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:02,600
OK, so how leather reversible bomber jacket?

1156
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:07,920
How much do we think this cost back when this opened?

1157
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:10,600
We start. Yeah, go Jason.

1158
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:12,200
Seventy dollars. Seventy dollars.

1159
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:14,200
Scott. 120. 120.

1160
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:18,520
Jason, I was going to say 79, 79 dollars, 200.

1161
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:21,560
Eva is correct.

1162
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:23,720
The answer is three hundred and twenty five dollars.

1163
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:25,520
My God.

1164
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:29,400
Wow. And then real quick, one more.

1165
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:32,320
The leather special edition bomber jacket.

1166
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:33,920
How much do we think that cost?

1167
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:37,560
Well, a special edition, three fifty, three fifty.

1168
00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:42,000
Scott got to go higher and jeez than three seventy three seventy.

1169
00:59:42,040 --> 00:59:43,600
Six thousand dollars.

1170
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:45,800
Five hundred.

1171
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:47,480
Eva is 100 percent correct.

1172
00:59:49,080 --> 00:59:50,280
Wow.

1173
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:51,280
Wow.

1174
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:55,240
Five hundred dollars for the leather special edition dive jacket.

1175
00:59:55,640 --> 00:59:57,960
You like that's the premier item.

1176
00:59:58,160 --> 00:59:59,320
That's the most expensive item.

1177
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:01,520
The denim vest is forty five dollars.

1178
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:04,960
And then there's there's a couple of jackets are two hundred and fifty.

1179
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:08,800
And then just a regular denim jackets are seventy five and ninety five.

1180
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:12,880
This is like delusional Katzenberg signing off on stuff

1181
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:13,960
nobody can afford.

1182
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:16,120
Like no wonder they weren't making any money from merch.

1183
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:18,480
Yeah, that's the level.

1184
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:22,000
And they have to be moving that level of stuff every day.

1185
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:23,560
Well, yeah, a lot of it.

1186
01:00:23,560 --> 01:00:26,760
And now you were setting us up to talk about Las Vegas.

1187
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:31,320
The Las Vegas store was moving about, you know, it was 40 percent

1188
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:34,000
of like money coming in, was coming from the store,

1189
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:38,000
because that was in a high traffic area and they got like three thousand

1190
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:41,240
guests a day. OK, so they are making the money.

1191
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:44,400
It's it's next to what's still there, the fashion show mall,

1192
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:47,800
which the marketing on that was like the most luxurious shopping mall

1193
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:49,640
Las Vegas has ever seen.

1194
01:00:49,640 --> 01:00:53,880
And then, of course, in the 2000s, every casino built a shopping mall into it.

1195
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:56,080
So a little less shiny now.

1196
01:00:56,080 --> 01:00:57,920
Yeah, that place sucks. It's awful.

1197
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:00,760
It was a good like exterior, though.

1198
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:01,760
Like now there was more.

1199
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:06,240
There's like a whole water scene and water jets shooting up.

1200
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:09,720
And they had to find a way to

1201
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:12,760
to go big because it's Vegas.

1202
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:16,040
How do we get this thing cooking a little more?

1203
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:18,680
How do we how do we submerge even deeper?

1204
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:21,760
We got to get a creep involved.

1205
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:25,360
So it was not just Spielberg and Katzenberg.

1206
01:01:25,360 --> 01:01:28,320
They rounded it out with Steve Wynn.

1207
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:31,200
Yeah, it is.

1208
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:36,200
It's got a photo picture that I had said has very sinister energy.

1209
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:38,400
And I think it's Steve Wynn's shittied grin.

1210
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:42,080
And the fact that he's just wearing a dive t-shirt like Steve Wynn

1211
01:01:42,080 --> 01:01:44,200
in a t-shirt is upsetting.

1212
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:48,440
Wait, so Steve Wynn, just to be clear, Steve Wynn's not involved with Hard Rock.

1213
01:01:48,440 --> 01:01:50,280
He's not involved in Planet Hollywood.

1214
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:52,000
This is like his his swing.

1215
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,400
I think so other than his casinos.

1216
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:57,600
Yeah, I don't think he's been part of a separate, like not in his complex

1217
01:01:57,600 --> 01:02:00,440
shopping at this fucking bid to get, you know, one of these.

1218
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:02,160
Yeah. Yeah.

1219
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:07,200
This this trend that is really big this year and assuredly will not collapse

1220
01:02:07,560 --> 01:02:09,800
by the end of this year.

1221
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:11,200
Steve's got to get a piece.

1222
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:15,040
I think he was involved in getting the fashion show mall off the ground.

1223
01:02:15,040 --> 01:02:16,280
OK. Oh, OK.

1224
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:18,560
So it was kind of maybe part of a facility.

1225
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:22,520
If you don't know, Steve Wynn Mirage is him.

1226
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:24,360
Treasure Island is him.

1227
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:25,840
Bellagio is him.

1228
01:02:25,840 --> 01:02:27,520
The Wynn and Encore.

1229
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:32,040
Yeah. Now, of course, no longer associated with any of those companies.

1230
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:34,480
Yeah. Due to his own insane behavior.

1231
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:35,760
Yeah. Yeah.

1232
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:39,000
I was trying to remember what it was, and I started looking and boy, it's bad.

1233
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:42,040
And boy, there's a lot of them over many days.

1234
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:45,360
And there's also his feud with Girls Gone Wild founder Joe Franklin.

1235
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:47,720
Oh, who do you root for in that one?

1236
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:50,400
You tell me. He owns the Maltese Falcon.

1237
01:02:50,680 --> 01:02:53,360
That's something I learned recently. Really?

1238
01:02:53,360 --> 01:02:56,160
Wow. So bizarre.

1239
01:02:56,720 --> 01:02:59,480
He paid like three million dollars.

1240
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:03,000
The three million dollars for a McGuffin.

1241
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:04,000
I got it.

1242
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,000
I'm smart.

1243
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:06,960
The the best.

1244
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:08,600
I mean, I may be correct me if I'm wrong.

1245
01:03:08,600 --> 01:03:13,200
Some of the best Steve Wynn media is him watching his old commercials on YouTube.

1246
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:14,400
I don't know if you guys have seen this.

1247
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:16,400
No, these are Scott knows.

1248
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:17,840
Yeah, we've talked about this.

1249
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:20,800
He goes over his old commercials like Frank Sinatra.

1250
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:24,000
And then he explains to you what it was like to work with Frank,

1251
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:26,040
which is just he has nothing to say.

1252
01:03:26,040 --> 01:03:27,240
There's nothing interesting to say.

1253
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:28,640
I mean, I think he's a great guy.

1254
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:29,640
I think he's a great guy.

1255
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:30,640
I think he's a great guy.

1256
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:31,640
I think he's a great guy.

1257
01:03:31,640 --> 01:03:34,040
Nothing to say. There's nothing interesting to say.

1258
01:03:34,040 --> 01:03:36,280
See, Frank was just Frank.

1259
01:03:36,280 --> 01:03:37,960
Ah, Frank, classic Frank.

1260
01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:39,800
And there's no real story.

1261
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:40,600
No, no story.

1262
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:43,960
But like the commercial was, you know, Frank's in the hotel room.

1263
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:46,440
And then he's like, hey, you and he's talking to Steve when he's like, hey,

1264
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:48,040
can you get me some more towels?

1265
01:03:48,040 --> 01:03:51,320
And Steve Wynn and looks at the camera and goes towels.

1266
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:55,480
And then the logo for the hotel comes up and Steve's like a classic Frank.

1267
01:03:57,160 --> 01:03:59,960
That was the hotel he opened that famously didn't have any towels.

1268
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:03,160
That was a gimmick of it.

1269
01:04:04,360 --> 01:04:06,360
But these are all still probably online.

1270
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:12,760
Yeah, the the lawsuits section of his Wikipedia is so massive and including the

1271
01:04:12,760 --> 01:04:17,640
Girls Gone Wild guy where I didn't know the source of that that feud.

1272
01:04:17,640 --> 01:04:20,200
But and I assumed Wynn was in the wrong.

1273
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:23,400
But I think it's I mean, I glazed over I'm sure Wynn is on the

1274
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:26,040
it wins always in the wrong somewhere, I would imagine.

1275
01:04:26,040 --> 01:04:31,800
But this involved like that guy, Joe, owed so much money to the hotel

1276
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:33,240
that he wasn't paying.

1277
01:04:33,240 --> 01:04:34,520
So they were suing him.

1278
01:04:34,520 --> 01:04:37,080
And then he threatened in some media.

1279
01:04:37,080 --> 01:04:39,160
He just said, I want Steve Wynn dead.

1280
01:04:39,160 --> 01:04:39,960
I'm going to kill him.

1281
01:04:40,680 --> 01:04:44,360
So then he got sued for that for a lot of money and they and

1282
01:04:45,720 --> 01:04:47,160
so he owed more money.

1283
01:04:47,160 --> 01:04:49,400
And then he said it again and he got sued again.

1284
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:52,840
I think Steve Wynn though said he was going to bury Joe in the desert.

1285
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:55,480
Maybe one was a threat.

1286
01:04:55,480 --> 01:04:57,080
Maybe there was a threat volley.

1287
01:04:57,080 --> 01:04:57,880
Maybe it wasn't.

1288
01:04:57,880 --> 01:05:02,040
I think Steve threatened to like Joe Pesci and casino him or something.

1289
01:05:03,160 --> 01:05:04,280
I have to look that up.

1290
01:05:04,280 --> 01:05:07,720
There was like five years where Joe Francis was really Joe Francis,

1291
01:05:07,720 --> 01:05:11,000
called him Joe Franklin, friendly, popular and powerful, not popular,

1292
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:12,040
but just had so much power.

1293
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:12,920
Yes.

1294
01:05:12,920 --> 01:05:15,400
When he was the bonda chat era.

1295
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:19,080
Videos with Snoop Dogg.

1296
01:05:19,080 --> 01:05:19,880
Yeah, yes.

1297
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:21,720
Everyone loved him.

1298
01:05:22,360 --> 01:05:25,000
Girls wanted to be on the thing.

1299
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:26,280
They put me in it.

1300
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:31,320
I want to be on TV with the word censored over my breast.

1301
01:05:32,680 --> 01:05:33,880
I want to be a star.

1302
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:38,120
Steve Wynn, of course, when New Jersey legalized casino gambling

1303
01:05:38,120 --> 01:05:42,200
and Atlantic City was adding all the casinos, Steve Wynn was in a war

1304
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:45,880
with the other casino magnet that eventually ran him out of town

1305
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:47,800
for president Donald Trump once again.

1306
01:05:48,440 --> 01:05:51,800
So that was another no matter who wins, we lose situation.

1307
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:57,720
But who they ended up kind of getting to be friends, seemingly.

1308
01:05:57,720 --> 01:06:01,640
And in fact, it was Trump who told him to call the hotel, the Wynn.

1309
01:06:01,640 --> 01:06:04,520
He was going to name the hotel after a Picasso.

1310
01:06:05,080 --> 01:06:08,040
And Trump said, but ultimately, you're going to want your name in there.

1311
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:09,320
You got to put your name on there.

1312
01:06:09,320 --> 01:06:09,960
And he did it.

1313
01:06:11,240 --> 01:06:16,920
And Trump ended up being at Wynn's third wedding, a wedding.

1314
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:21,720
There was also a reunion of his partners in Dive, Spielberg and Katzenberg.

1315
01:06:22,120 --> 01:06:29,400
And also Planet Hollywood, Sylvester Stallone, Clint Eastwood was the best man.

1316
01:06:30,760 --> 01:06:33,880
Steve Wynn's best man at his third wedding.

1317
01:06:34,680 --> 01:06:36,040
Brett Ratner was there.

1318
01:06:37,560 --> 01:06:44,040
And disgraced junk bond trader Michael Milken, who also famously ate at Dive.

1319
01:06:44,040 --> 01:06:45,960
It was a seemingly irregular dive.

1320
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:46,460
Yeah.

1321
01:06:48,840 --> 01:06:50,920
So that must have been cool for everybody.

1322
01:06:50,920 --> 01:06:54,600
It's like, boy, this wedding's like being back at the old place.

1323
01:06:54,600 --> 01:06:55,480
Was George there?

1324
01:06:58,360 --> 01:06:59,720
George is parking cars.

1325
01:07:03,080 --> 01:07:04,520
He crashed his second one.

1326
01:07:05,160 --> 01:07:07,560
He fucked up Clint Eastwood's car.

1327
01:07:07,560 --> 01:07:09,160
I'm so sorry.

1328
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:16,360
Steve Wynn, I believe a big Republican party booster, along with his casino founder

1329
01:07:17,160 --> 01:07:20,200
in the same part of the Las Vegas Strip, Sheldon Adelson,

1330
01:07:21,160 --> 01:07:27,000
now dead, one of the worst people in America, gave gobs and gobs to the Republican party and

1331
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:34,840
bought the local newspaper and started to demand coverage changes, like really nasty stuff.

1332
01:07:34,840 --> 01:07:39,000
That end of the Vegas Strip just has so many bizarre ghosts.

1333
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:42,520
Some of them are funny, like Dive, and some of them are not.

1334
01:07:42,520 --> 01:07:43,960
Didn't he just die?

1335
01:07:43,960 --> 01:07:46,840
Sheldon Adelson, I believe last year or so, last two years.

1336
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:50,600
He got mad at Trump for being rude to him, and he yanked a bunch of funding

1337
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:51,720
right before the election.

1338
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:53,640
It wasn't because of the stuff.

1339
01:07:53,640 --> 01:07:54,760
It was because he was rude.

1340
01:07:54,760 --> 01:07:55,320
He was rude.

1341
01:07:55,320 --> 01:07:56,840
He put a hump on him or something.

1342
01:07:59,640 --> 01:08:05,320
I found out that that guy, okay, Lin Wood, that crazy QAnon lawyer guy.

1343
01:08:07,480 --> 01:08:11,720
He used to represent Steve Wynn at some point in time.

1344
01:08:12,280 --> 01:08:15,880
And yeah, he's the most like Q-pilled guy.

1345
01:08:15,880 --> 01:08:19,160
He just represented Kyle Rittenhouse and did a bad job.

1346
01:08:19,160 --> 01:08:20,680
Kyle Rittenhouse hated him.

1347
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:24,040
Yeah, he kept Kyle Rittenhouse in prison longer for fundraising.

1348
01:08:28,680 --> 01:08:30,440
They had all the money to pay my bail.

1349
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:33,720
They kept me in longer to raise more money, and then they kept that money.

1350
01:08:35,720 --> 01:08:36,840
So this was Steve Wynn.

1351
01:08:36,840 --> 01:08:38,280
Wait, was Steve Wynn's lawyer?

1352
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:42,680
Well, it was once Steve Wynn's lawyer also represented Richard Jewell.

1353
01:08:44,440 --> 01:08:46,360
And the falling out with Steve...

1354
01:08:47,160 --> 01:08:47,560
Hang on.

1355
01:08:47,560 --> 01:08:48,840
This is so twisted up.

1356
01:08:50,200 --> 01:08:58,920
Apparently, he hates Steve Wynn now because Lin Wood was trying to get Trump

1357
01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:01,640
to give Richard Jewell the Medal of Freedom,

1358
01:09:02,280 --> 01:09:07,000
but posthumously he's been dead for a long time, and Steve Wynn talked him out of it.

1359
01:09:08,280 --> 01:09:10,120
So now they hate each other.

1360
01:09:10,120 --> 01:09:20,120
One other person Lin Wood represented is the Thai cave diver that Elon Musk called a pedophile.

1361
01:09:22,440 --> 01:09:27,640
Lin Wood represented him in the trial to sue Elon Musk and fucked that up too.

1362
01:09:27,640 --> 01:09:28,360
Oh, wow.

1363
01:09:30,120 --> 01:09:33,160
What we're learning is the downfall, the arc of dive,

1364
01:09:33,160 --> 01:09:37,240
the downfall of dive mirrors the downfall of the American 20th century.

1365
01:09:37,240 --> 01:09:44,840
Like dominates the theme restaurant industry craters in the late 90s, early 2000s, which...

1366
01:09:44,840 --> 01:09:46,680
Many of the same players.

1367
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:49,560
This actually might be a good time to play.

1368
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:53,480
It could be like a painting like that famous diner where they're sitting in the corner,

1369
01:09:53,480 --> 01:09:56,920
but just dive and all of these like horrible people.

1370
01:09:56,920 --> 01:09:58,200
Jayhawks or nighthawks.

1371
01:09:58,200 --> 01:10:04,520
Michael Nolan, Katzenberg and George Keeling over.

1372
01:10:05,480 --> 01:10:06,440
Oh, sorry.

1373
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:11,560
I was going to say there's an article in the Los Angeles Review Journal that talks about the

1374
01:10:11,560 --> 01:10:16,760
downfall of kind of like themed restaurants and ones like Rainforest Cafe and Hard Rock

1375
01:10:16,760 --> 01:10:18,040
that did manage to hang on.

1376
01:10:18,040 --> 01:10:22,520
And of course they quote another recurring podcast ride villain, Tillman Fertitta,

1377
01:10:24,360 --> 01:10:27,480
CEO of Landry's, which owns the Hard Rock Cafe now.

1378
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:32,120
His scintillating quotes include,

1379
01:10:32,680 --> 01:10:38,840
People eat differently when they're on vacation and you have to know who your customer is and

1380
01:10:38,840 --> 01:10:39,880
then have the food.

1381
01:10:41,160 --> 01:10:43,080
So great stuff as usual, Tillman.

1382
01:10:43,080 --> 01:10:45,240
Otherwise, the paddle.

1383
01:10:45,240 --> 01:10:48,280
The paddle going for your ass.

1384
01:10:48,280 --> 01:10:50,840
Have the food where the food should be or else.

1385
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:52,680
Paddle, paddle.

1386
01:10:54,360 --> 01:10:55,160
Here is it.

1387
01:10:55,160 --> 01:11:01,800
If we're talking like aftermath, this is on a Las Vegas news site that was kind of

1388
01:11:03,080 --> 01:11:07,400
synopsizing what have they were showing footage from the opening when things were optimistic

1389
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:11,160
and Steve Wynn and Katzenberg and Spielberg or Buddy.

1390
01:11:11,160 --> 01:11:15,240
But I don't think Spielberg actually did public appearances for the LA

1391
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:18,360
dive, at least not that I could find.

1392
01:11:18,360 --> 01:11:21,240
So it was kind of crazy that he's so publicly.

1393
01:11:22,360 --> 01:11:25,640
In some article, it said that they didn't really,

1394
01:11:25,640 --> 01:11:28,680
neither of them wanted to talk too publicly about it because they didn't want to create

1395
01:11:28,680 --> 01:11:30,920
the impression that it was their new full-time job.

1396
01:11:32,680 --> 01:11:38,040
People didn't want people to think that Spielberg was making the subs at the restaurant.

1397
01:11:40,280 --> 01:11:42,920
Roast beef and turkey up, table six.

1398
01:11:42,920 --> 01:11:45,480
My investors are like, I thought you were a movie director.

1399
01:11:48,040 --> 01:11:49,880
He's not working on Omistad at all.

1400
01:11:50,680 --> 01:11:58,600
Was it that he came up with the wet sub restaurant and then he won an Oscar and he's like, oh shit.

1401
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:00,920
What am I doing?

1402
01:12:01,720 --> 01:12:03,000
I just made Schindler's List.

1403
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:06,520
I can't be associated with this stupid fucking restaurant.

1404
01:12:06,520 --> 01:12:08,840
Like he thought people were going to think he's like Ronald McDonald now.

1405
01:12:11,720 --> 01:12:12,760
Like I'm just the mascot for this.

1406
01:12:12,760 --> 01:12:13,960
Dave Thomas.

1407
01:12:13,960 --> 01:12:14,600
Yeah.

1408
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:16,600
He had agreed to be in the ads.

1409
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:20,600
That would have been so cool though if they had like merchandise with like a cartoon

1410
01:12:20,600 --> 01:12:25,640
Spielberg or like every restaurant, every dive would have a Spielberg going from table to table,

1411
01:12:25,640 --> 01:12:27,000
like checking in on you.

1412
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:28,040
Whole big mascot.

1413
01:12:28,600 --> 01:12:33,320
And then like he asks you to describe your meal with the frame of the lens.

1414
01:12:33,320 --> 01:12:34,760
Oh, that's good.

1415
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:36,840
Describe your perfect meal.

1416
01:12:36,840 --> 01:12:37,400
Yeah.

1417
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:39,800
And what lens would you use to view it?

1418
01:12:39,800 --> 01:12:39,960
Yeah.

1419
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:42,600
Or if he comes over he goes, you guys ready to order yet?

1420
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:43,320
And action.

1421
01:12:45,240 --> 01:12:46,920
Then you order when he says action.

1422
01:12:46,920 --> 01:12:47,560
Yeah.

1423
01:12:47,560 --> 01:12:50,920
He flips the chair around and sits at the table with you.

1424
01:12:50,920 --> 01:12:52,520
Oh man.

1425
01:12:52,520 --> 01:12:54,200
Hello, I'm Steven Spielberg.

1426
01:12:54,200 --> 01:12:54,840
I'm going to be brief.

1427
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:55,640
We don't have much time.

1428
01:12:55,640 --> 01:12:59,880
The sub is sinking.

1429
01:13:01,240 --> 01:13:02,920
Would you like any appateezers?

1430
01:13:05,480 --> 01:13:07,080
I'm always on the podcast.

1431
01:13:07,080 --> 01:13:10,840
I'm always talking about, I wish there was a Michael Eisner, like a doll or a toy of some kind.

1432
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:19,640
There is an unlicensed Steven Spielberg one sixth scale toy that's called like director man.

1433
01:13:20,600 --> 01:13:24,760
And it's made overseas and they don't, I don't know if they make it and I can't find it on eBay,

1434
01:13:24,760 --> 01:13:26,440
but you can find, Jason, my phone just died.

1435
01:13:26,440 --> 01:13:33,000
Could you look up Steven Spielberg one sixth scale because I need this toy.

1436
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:33,500
Yeah.

1437
01:13:34,120 --> 01:13:39,320
There's all these different companies overseas that make like licensed knockoffs essentially,

1438
01:13:39,320 --> 01:13:43,160
but they look so like they make a good daredevil toy and it's called lawyer man.

1439
01:13:44,200 --> 01:13:47,000
And it's exactly, it looks like Charlie Cox from the Netflix show.

1440
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:48,600
And they have a Spielberg one.

1441
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:50,840
He comes with like accessories and like his hat.

1442
01:13:50,840 --> 01:13:51,480
The hat?

1443
01:13:51,480 --> 01:13:52,280
His famous hat.

1444
01:13:52,280 --> 01:13:56,600
And like, has it got, you know, the, the, the, maybe the megaphone and like the chair, I think as well.

1445
01:13:56,600 --> 01:13:57,000
Wow.

1446
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,320
And I need this stupid thing. Did you find it?

1447
01:13:59,320 --> 01:14:03,480
Okay. I don't, I haven't found a full set, but on Ali express.

1448
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:09,800
Oh, I found it too. The head, the head sculpt, the Steven Spielberg head sculpt.

1449
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:13,560
How much, how much, how much?

1450
01:14:13,560 --> 01:14:14,360
$29.

1451
01:14:14,360 --> 01:14:15,400
No, that's just the head.

1452
01:14:15,400 --> 01:14:16,440
$29.

1453
01:14:16,440 --> 01:14:17,960
I'll find a picture of it after this.

1454
01:14:17,960 --> 01:14:19,800
Steven Spielberg's head for $29.

1455
01:14:19,800 --> 01:14:20,280
$29.

1456
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:26,680
His, the jackets at the restaurant he made cost 500 and now his head is 29.

1457
01:14:26,680 --> 01:14:28,280
I'm going to buy that.

1458
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:34,280
Yeah. You have things very, you have one of these of you already.

1459
01:14:34,280 --> 01:14:35,320
It's really similar.

1460
01:14:36,280 --> 01:14:36,920
Wow.

1461
01:14:36,920 --> 01:14:44,600
Wow. Okay. So as, as we're wrapping up the stories of everybody, like what did the,

1462
01:14:44,600 --> 01:14:46,920
what did the dive team go on to do?

1463
01:14:46,920 --> 01:14:50,280
Here's this little clip from a Las Vegas news station.

1464
01:14:51,240 --> 01:14:51,480
Yeah.

1465
01:14:54,120 --> 01:14:54,840
Might take a sec.

1466
01:14:57,640 --> 01:14:59,000
Wonky news site again.

1467
01:15:00,280 --> 01:15:05,080
So where's dive today? It was the second location. The first had been in LA with plans to eventually

1468
01:15:05,080 --> 01:15:10,440
open about 60, but the intense atmosphere actually seemed to be too much stimulation for dining.

1469
01:15:10,440 --> 01:15:14,760
LA closed in 1999 in Las Vegas. A couple of years later, there were no more.

1470
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:18,360
Steve Wynn opened a couple of more hotels, but was eventually forced out of the industry

1471
01:15:18,360 --> 01:15:22,360
amidst allegations of sexual harassment. Spielberg kept directing and Katzenberg

1472
01:15:22,360 --> 01:15:25,080
now runs a video streaming platform called QB.

1473
01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:32,840
That's the company started after Quibi went under.

1474
01:15:34,600 --> 01:15:38,200
Here's what we'll do. It's fine. It's fine. Everybody just moving it to QB.

1475
01:15:39,240 --> 01:15:43,560
Does feel like a lot like we be, they feel so of a piece.

1476
01:15:43,560 --> 01:15:44,440
Yeah. Yeah.

1477
01:15:45,720 --> 01:15:48,120
That still wasn't right. Also, it's the auto quib.

1478
01:15:48,120 --> 01:15:52,440
It's a quibi, right? Even though it's spelled quit.

1479
01:15:52,440 --> 01:15:54,200
I think it's for quick bites. Yeah.

1480
01:15:54,200 --> 01:15:58,200
But it's, but, but that was the thing about it is that quick bites should be quibi.

1481
01:15:59,320 --> 01:16:01,400
Right. It was a shortening of, of bite.

1482
01:16:01,400 --> 01:16:04,200
Sounds like a dune race of people.

1483
01:16:08,440 --> 01:16:14,360
There were some problems with that site. Yes. And with his submarine restaurant,

1484
01:16:14,360 --> 01:16:19,400
this might've been a clue or the clue long before that, that he said, cut the

1485
01:16:19,400 --> 01:16:22,280
song from Little Mermaid that saved the entire company.

1486
01:16:23,640 --> 01:16:26,040
Part of your world. He's had so many, I need to,

1487
01:16:26,040 --> 01:16:29,080
I actually don't know very much about his life, but I was just reading the

1488
01:16:29,080 --> 01:16:35,400
Wiki of the original Toy Story movie. And that's also a very crazy winding story that almost wound

1489
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:39,880
up, was almost falling apart. It was way over budget was almost killed a lot of times, but

1490
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:45,400
he's a real character in there where I probably remember this one, but just read, read that.

1491
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:49,640
His opinions are fascinating considering what it became. I think all his notes were just like,

1492
01:16:49,640 --> 01:16:50,680
make Woody meaner.

1493
01:16:54,280 --> 01:16:58,920
I mean, that's why it almost died is that he was so unpleasant and they got a lot of it out of

1494
01:16:58,920 --> 01:17:03,320
there. But when you do watch the first, because I'm watching these movies every day with my kid.

1495
01:17:03,320 --> 01:17:05,480
Yeah, me too. Okay. Yeah. We're both, we haven't both

1496
01:17:05,480 --> 01:17:09,720
met. Right. The world is so much more caustic than all the rest. Woody is like, is

1497
01:17:09,880 --> 01:17:15,640
still really hard edge. Well, there's that Wiki when you can. It's like he is we're just like,

1498
01:17:15,640 --> 01:17:20,680
well, he has to, he's obviously had a tremendous amount of success, but also, and it's probably

1499
01:17:20,680 --> 01:17:24,760
because of this quality of just like having a weird crazy idea that no one else had and then

1500
01:17:24,760 --> 01:17:29,720
just hanging onto it. And enough times it's like that worked. And then yeah, there are these other

1501
01:17:29,720 --> 01:17:34,840
times where it's like, no, that just seems so crazy and misguided. Yeah. Would not work.

1502
01:17:35,480 --> 01:17:39,160
The, uh, what was the thing with the other name of quivy? There was going to be called

1503
01:17:41,160 --> 01:17:45,720
which is a term for expensive sushi. Yeah. Like little bunches of little

1504
01:17:45,720 --> 01:17:50,280
sushis that costs like $500. It costs as much as one special edition jacket.

1505
01:17:52,360 --> 01:17:54,440
Something middle America could really relate to.

1506
01:17:55,160 --> 01:18:00,120
Middle America, 19 year olds all know what Omakase is.

1507
01:18:00,120 --> 01:18:05,160
Look, just go down to your local Omakase place in any town, USA. You'll get an idea.

1508
01:18:05,160 --> 01:18:11,160
What are websites going to be? He needs to start an Omakase restaurant. I don't know what the theme

1509
01:18:11,720 --> 01:18:17,640
is of that, but I mean, if there's any other food that he's does, you know, dying to yeah.

1510
01:18:17,640 --> 01:18:22,360
I'm sure he's still got a few tricks up his old sleeve. Right? We haven't heard the last

1511
01:18:22,360 --> 01:18:28,200
of Jeffrey Kassenberg. No way. Is there a dive cookbook or dive recipes published anywhere?

1512
01:18:28,200 --> 01:18:32,680
Cause CPK put out a cookbook around that time. CPK is a very successful chain.

1513
01:18:35,960 --> 01:18:43,480
There is some, uh, I feel like I found some sauce that was determined good enough to try to

1514
01:18:44,040 --> 01:18:49,400
hold on to. Let me see if I can find it from a website, top secret recipes.com.

1515
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:54,520
Oh yeah. There's like, that's like a, like copycat recipes. Yeah. Yeah.

1516
01:18:55,240 --> 01:19:01,480
I'd like to make a dive sub for dinner tonight. Um, the dive, uh, Sicilian sub rosa after mentioned,

1517
01:19:01,480 --> 01:19:08,040
there's a recipe for, um, there's, you can make dive carrot chips. You could make a dive brick

1518
01:19:08,040 --> 01:19:15,880
oven mushroom and Turkey. Okay. All right. Um, and that's, I mean, I don't know. Uh, uh, and then

1519
01:19:15,880 --> 01:19:21,160
s'mores dive s'more. They kind of just look like s'mores to me. I'll see how, how you make,

1520
01:19:21,160 --> 01:19:29,960
make it wet. You can just go to subway and buy something and soak it overnight.

1521
01:19:38,840 --> 01:19:45,000
One thing we haven't, uh, I, I would like everyone to guess now how much to build the first, the dive

1522
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:50,440
in, uh, Los Angeles, how much was the budget? Scott, you have a guess. I have this reference

1523
01:19:51,320 --> 01:19:57,640
Jason was like 9 million Eva. I'll say 10 million. I'm trying to remember. I saw a figure

1524
01:19:57,640 --> 01:20:03,320
and it was 7 million, but it was that which is Spielberg invested. I saw, I saw 7 million.

1525
01:20:03,320 --> 01:20:07,800
I saw that was, I thought that was to build. Yeah. You probably right. But now, but I'm

1526
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:13,960
now I'm seeing all separately that Vegas cost 15. Okay. So that seems to be, it would be more,

1527
01:20:13,960 --> 01:20:18,680
it would be less. You would think they did it once. I think they went a little harder on Vegas.

1528
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:22,840
They up the design on Vegas because it's got so much competition. Although some of the Vegas

1529
01:20:22,840 --> 01:20:27,800
pictures are very funny because it's still in that transitional period between old Vegas and

1530
01:20:27,800 --> 01:20:32,760
theme park Vegas. So you can see like the dirty old sign for the frontier casino in the background.

1531
01:20:33,560 --> 01:20:39,240
Century city mall is cool. Now I like it. Am I, am I, uh, underrating it? Well, they have a lot of,

1532
01:20:39,240 --> 01:20:45,960
uh, uh, interesting Asian chain restaurants that don't exist to other places. Very good hot pot

1533
01:20:45,960 --> 01:20:52,520
place. There's a brand of a Colt ramen place that just opened. And they also have a, um,

1534
01:20:52,520 --> 01:20:55,720
what's the dumpling place we went to? Uh, didn't I find it? Yeah. They have a Dintay fun.

1535
01:20:55,720 --> 01:21:01,240
Oh, yeah. He's there. Yeah. Maybe I'm being great. He is great. They have a container store there.

1536
01:21:01,240 --> 01:21:07,560
Which I worked at when I was younger. So you gotta go and feel, feel the old gals. That's

1537
01:21:07,560 --> 01:21:13,160
right. The old GS 22. I don't know what your containers were called. I walk around and listen

1538
01:21:13,160 --> 01:21:18,120
to people planning clauses and I go, he's not doing it right. Um, does anyone know what,

1539
01:21:18,120 --> 01:21:22,840
like did the Vegas, I'm just picturing, did they, do they have to do a demolition of the Vegas

1540
01:21:22,840 --> 01:21:29,720
location? Presumably. Oh wow. I think I found demolition photos of the Hollywood one. I,

1541
01:21:29,720 --> 01:21:34,680
like, I think I have photos of just the frame and they've taken all the yellow off of it.

1542
01:21:34,680 --> 01:21:37,640
They don't Vegas. I don't really know. They don't blow up small buildings.

1543
01:21:37,640 --> 01:21:44,920
Do they? Oh, you're one of them. They just closed in Vegas. They have to implode it in slow motion.

1544
01:21:46,200 --> 01:21:53,320
Dive, dive, implode, implode. We're going to close the Arby's. Let's load it up with explosives.

1545
01:21:54,280 --> 01:21:59,320
The location of the Los Angeles one probably wasn't doing itself any favors because century

1546
01:21:59,320 --> 01:22:05,800
city is not like, yeah, it's a lot of offices and like talent agencies. Like it's not people like,

1547
01:22:05,880 --> 01:22:11,640
oh, we got to see the century city neighborhood. Sure. If anything, my memory of century city is

1548
01:22:11,640 --> 01:22:18,040
like, yeah, the parking situation is atrocious. Since they redid them all, it is like, uh, my

1549
01:22:18,040 --> 01:22:21,400
teen stepdaughter loves it. Like that's where she likes to go and hang out with her friends

1550
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:27,480
because she can go shopping and see a movie and stuff. Okay. But, um, yeah, the parking's okay

1551
01:22:27,480 --> 01:22:32,600
there. I feel like it's bad. It's all got better. I just feel like, cause when I was in college at USC

1552
01:22:33,320 --> 01:22:37,000
around this time, which I think is when dive was open, but I never went, but we would go to that

1553
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:42,040
movie theater a lot. And then everything at century city mall closed for like a decade.

1554
01:22:42,040 --> 01:22:45,240
Like it was, it was always under construction. It was mostly gutted.

1555
01:22:45,800 --> 01:22:47,320
Dead except for the movie theater.

1556
01:22:47,320 --> 01:22:52,440
Except for the movie theater. So also like there's no, it was a really hostile environment to like,

1557
01:22:52,440 --> 01:22:57,880
it wasn't a good mall. Like there was, it was mostly just gone. Um, so I don't know.

1558
01:22:58,280 --> 01:23:03,480
The dive site not filled. I don't think, I think there is nothing there currently.

1559
01:23:03,480 --> 01:23:06,280
Oh, wow. Nobody could fill the shoes.

1560
01:23:06,280 --> 01:23:08,040
There's no building. It's just, it's a lot.

1561
01:23:08,040 --> 01:23:13,000
No, no, no. It's, it's an empty storefront. I think there's just no, there's no, cause it's massive.

1562
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:17,640
I think the two story is maybe the issue. Like there's, there's too many ideas going on here,

1563
01:23:17,640 --> 01:23:24,520
right? Like bringing back sub sandwiches is one, but a 300 seat, $15 million restaurant that has

1564
01:23:24,520 --> 01:23:29,320
entertainment and $500 merchandise. That's an entire other thing.

1565
01:23:29,320 --> 01:23:32,520
We've complained about before about this Margaritaville at city walk because it's

1566
01:23:32,520 --> 01:23:37,560
not two stories, but maybe that maybe it not being two stories will allow it to exist longer.

1567
01:23:39,560 --> 01:23:40,440
It ain't looking great.

1568
01:23:42,440 --> 01:23:46,520
Wait, they haven't, they never opened that chocolate place that was going to go where the hard

1569
01:23:46,520 --> 01:23:48,200
rock. They haven't even started on it.

1570
01:23:48,200 --> 01:23:48,840
They're working.

1571
01:23:48,840 --> 01:23:50,120
I'm ready. Don't yell at me.

1572
01:23:50,120 --> 01:23:52,120
I'm mad at them, not you.

1573
01:23:52,120 --> 01:23:54,200
I'm mad at you too for bringing it up.

1574
01:23:55,480 --> 01:23:59,240
I was excited. One of those in Florida, what is it called?

1575
01:23:59,240 --> 01:24:03,000
Professor Toothsome Chocolate Emporium.

1576
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:04,200
Savoury treat.

1577
01:24:04,200 --> 01:24:04,440
Yeah.

1578
01:24:07,080 --> 01:24:08,760
Chocolate Emporium Savoury Treat.

1579
01:24:08,760 --> 01:24:10,760
They've got characters. They've got original characters.

1580
01:24:10,760 --> 01:24:11,080
I know.

1581
01:24:11,080 --> 01:24:12,680
I want to go to that.

1582
01:24:12,680 --> 01:24:14,040
It smells disgusting inside.

1583
01:24:14,040 --> 01:24:16,120
It smells like the M&M's store in Vegas.

1584
01:24:16,120 --> 01:24:17,000
But you've been there.

1585
01:24:18,120 --> 01:24:23,720
I got a Sunday to go at the Florida one and half the restaurant smells like chocolate and

1586
01:24:23,720 --> 01:24:25,560
the other half smells like.

1587
01:24:25,560 --> 01:24:26,280
Plastic.

1588
01:24:26,280 --> 01:24:27,400
Fries and plastic.

1589
01:24:28,280 --> 01:24:30,280
It's just kind of an overwhelming sensory experience.

1590
01:24:30,280 --> 01:24:32,600
They got sued by whoever owns Willy Wonka.

1591
01:24:35,720 --> 01:24:36,920
Which is actually Netflix.

1592
01:24:37,720 --> 01:24:38,120
Is that right?

1593
01:24:38,120 --> 01:24:42,440
Yeah. Netflix bought the Roald Dahl Extended Universe and they're going to be themed.

1594
01:24:42,440 --> 01:24:43,240
Multiple shows.

1595
01:24:43,240 --> 01:24:46,920
They're going to make a themed Willy Wonka environment they announced.

1596
01:24:46,920 --> 01:24:47,480
A place?

1597
01:24:47,480 --> 01:24:48,440
A place. Yeah.

1598
01:24:48,440 --> 01:24:50,200
Okay. Well, that's a good idea.

1599
01:24:50,760 --> 01:24:55,320
The official name the Toothsome Chocolate Emporium and Savoury Feast Kitchen.

1600
01:24:55,320 --> 01:24:56,600
Who is what character?

1601
01:24:57,400 --> 01:24:58,520
What is the character Jacques?

1602
01:24:59,240 --> 01:25:00,120
Is Jacques the dog?

1603
01:25:00,120 --> 01:25:01,880
Jacques might be like the TikTok man.

1604
01:25:01,880 --> 01:25:02,920
Like the gear man.

1605
01:25:02,920 --> 01:25:05,560
Because there's like a steampunk robot gear man.

1606
01:25:05,560 --> 01:25:06,920
But then there's also a dog.

1607
01:25:06,920 --> 01:25:07,800
Oh my God.

1608
01:25:07,800 --> 01:25:09,560
There's a dog and I can't remember the name of him already.

1609
01:25:09,560 --> 01:25:13,160
The dog is the Boston Dynamics is it the company?

1610
01:25:13,160 --> 01:25:17,320
The dogs that they're like retrofitting to be police like digital police.

1611
01:25:17,320 --> 01:25:17,640
The dog?

1612
01:25:17,640 --> 01:25:22,280
Yeah, it's like that black mirror like killer dog robot thing.

1613
01:25:22,280 --> 01:25:25,240
The dog can either bring you a sundae in its mouth or murder you.

1614
01:25:27,880 --> 01:25:29,880
But he has a cute name. Look up his cute name.

1615
01:25:29,880 --> 01:25:30,360
Yeah.

1616
01:25:30,360 --> 01:25:31,400
Oh man my phone died.

1617
01:25:31,400 --> 01:25:33,960
How could you only get something to go from this place?

1618
01:25:34,600 --> 01:25:35,560
Well, it was crowded.

1619
01:25:35,560 --> 01:25:36,840
When we were there it was crowded.

1620
01:25:36,840 --> 01:25:40,520
We went up to the bar because that was the only place you couldn't even just like get a table.

1621
01:25:40,520 --> 01:25:40,760
Wow.

1622
01:25:40,760 --> 01:25:41,320
They have a bar?

1623
01:25:41,320 --> 01:25:42,120
Yeah, not surprised.

1624
01:25:42,120 --> 01:25:43,240
You can do shots there.

1625
01:25:43,240 --> 01:25:45,960
Wait, maybe there's hope for themed restaurants.

1626
01:25:45,960 --> 01:25:48,280
I want to go to this place more than anything.

1627
01:25:48,280 --> 01:25:54,520
Well, that's in Orlando and if either of you guys want to join us on a maybe Orlando adventure that

1628
01:25:54,520 --> 01:25:56,680
we're thinking about doing.

1629
01:25:56,680 --> 01:25:57,800
Yeah, let me know.

1630
01:25:57,800 --> 01:26:01,240
If the virus keeps not killing everybody.

1631
01:26:01,960 --> 01:26:05,640
There'll be a window, there'll be like a week where there'll be like low level virus and we'll go,

1632
01:26:05,640 --> 01:26:06,520
we're doing it now.

1633
01:26:07,160 --> 01:26:09,080
We've learned that's how it has to work.

1634
01:26:09,080 --> 01:26:10,200
We have pounds now.

1635
01:26:10,200 --> 01:26:14,680
If things are okay for three days, we act as if the world is literally,

1636
01:26:14,680 --> 01:26:16,440
we act as if the rapture is coming.

1637
01:26:16,440 --> 01:26:17,000
Yep.

1638
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:23,400
Okay, the robot dog at Tucson Chocolate Factory is latte.

1639
01:26:23,400 --> 01:26:24,600
Yes, latte.

1640
01:26:24,600 --> 01:26:25,960
It is latte.

1641
01:26:25,960 --> 01:26:28,200
So are we getting one of these in LA?

1642
01:26:28,200 --> 01:26:28,440
Yes.

1643
01:26:28,440 --> 01:26:29,800
We are getting one of these in LA.

1644
01:26:29,800 --> 01:26:32,520
In theory, but they haven't done anything yet.

1645
01:26:32,520 --> 01:26:34,440
They've been closed for two years.

1646
01:26:34,440 --> 01:26:37,480
This could save CityWalk as we know it.

1647
01:26:37,480 --> 01:26:41,720
I'm telling you, there were surveyors up there standing in front of it.

1648
01:26:41,800 --> 01:26:46,120
When I went off to get a COVID test where I got the results nine days later.

1649
01:26:49,960 --> 01:26:51,400
These things aren't related.

1650
01:26:51,400 --> 01:26:53,160
That classic CityWalk scene.

1651
01:26:53,160 --> 01:26:57,960
The same people who were doing this test were surveying the old hard rock to put the retrofit

1652
01:26:57,960 --> 01:26:59,560
for the new Tucson.

1653
01:26:59,560 --> 01:27:01,800
They put the chocolate swab in your nose.

1654
01:27:03,240 --> 01:27:06,680
And then they had a like two o'clock shift to be Bob the minion in the park.

1655
01:27:09,560 --> 01:27:10,280
There's so much.

1656
01:27:11,080 --> 01:27:12,040
One more thing before we wind it down.

1657
01:27:12,040 --> 01:27:13,640
We haven't talked about the periscope.

1658
01:27:13,640 --> 01:27:18,920
There was a working periscope where you could actually spy on people on Santa Monica Boulevard.

1659
01:27:19,800 --> 01:27:24,840
It actually did work and you could stare at a specific conversation for a while if you wanted to.

1660
01:27:24,840 --> 01:27:27,320
That is the two-way mirror of dive.

1661
01:27:27,320 --> 01:27:29,320
Yeah, a lot of voyeurs working at this restaurant.

1662
01:27:30,200 --> 01:27:31,880
So they did have crazy urinals.

1663
01:27:32,600 --> 01:27:35,560
Why do these people think that people just want to spy on people?

1664
01:27:36,360 --> 01:27:37,800
There's so much of that.

1665
01:27:38,040 --> 01:27:40,200
You don't want to see what other people live like.

1666
01:27:41,960 --> 01:27:46,680
Imagine yourself living their lives, wearing their clothes, living in their homes, you know, normal stuff.

1667
01:27:47,480 --> 01:27:52,840
You got to make sure your partners and your business aren't talking smack about you.

1668
01:27:52,840 --> 01:27:55,560
So you can you don't end up in a lawsuit.

1669
01:27:55,560 --> 01:27:57,160
So sometimes you got to bug their office.

1670
01:27:58,520 --> 01:28:02,520
This is how the Levi restaurant group does their business famously.

1671
01:28:04,120 --> 01:28:06,600
So look, this is a crazy place.

1672
01:28:06,600 --> 01:28:14,440
I guess here's a question because I like asking if and meditating on if do we think that the place

1673
01:28:15,720 --> 01:28:22,360
had the essence of the man and Katzenberg we know less about but Spielberg we know him.

1674
01:28:22,360 --> 01:28:23,640
We know his movies so well.

1675
01:28:23,640 --> 01:28:27,080
Do we think this is the ultimate iteration of a Spielberg restaurant?

1676
01:28:27,080 --> 01:28:28,600
Was it Spielberg enough?

1677
01:28:30,360 --> 01:28:34,680
I was thinking like, man, right now I'm like on a real Spielberg high because

1678
01:28:34,680 --> 01:28:36,040
West Side Story is so good.

1679
01:28:36,680 --> 01:28:39,400
But fucking guy made Ready Player One.

1680
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:42,120
So my answer is yes.

1681
01:28:44,120 --> 01:28:45,720
You call this equivalent to Ready Player One.

1682
01:28:45,720 --> 01:28:50,840
Most Spielberg stuff in the last 20 years is like dive level.

1683
01:28:51,640 --> 01:28:54,040
Dive has has BFG energy.

1684
01:28:56,760 --> 01:28:59,640
Do you think dive caused an artistic dive?

1685
01:28:59,640 --> 01:29:04,760
Did it like make him distracted and he maybe could have sustained the Schindler's Jurassic

1686
01:29:04,760 --> 01:29:09,720
Peak for longer if he hadn't gotten into the business of soggy bread?

1687
01:29:09,720 --> 01:29:12,120
Didn't he make Saving Private Ryan?

1688
01:29:14,120 --> 01:29:15,720
He made a few good movies after that.

1689
01:29:16,520 --> 01:29:19,640
It's a more convenient narrative that dive destroyed Steven Spielberg.

1690
01:29:19,640 --> 01:29:20,440
Isn't that more fun?

1691
01:29:22,040 --> 01:29:24,920
That did become his full-time job in his own heart.

1692
01:29:26,920 --> 01:29:28,280
He was doing too much dipping.

1693
01:29:29,960 --> 01:29:31,080
We're out of bath this year.

1694
01:29:31,080 --> 01:29:33,560
We need to put the New England Glam Jowder in something.

1695
01:29:33,560 --> 01:29:35,000
We're out of bread bath this year.

1696
01:29:39,960 --> 01:29:41,720
I feel like there's too much.

1697
01:29:43,240 --> 01:29:49,880
There's too much tacky shit still to really feel like that quintessential 90s Spielberg.

1698
01:29:50,920 --> 01:29:54,600
And I don't know, maybe he was led astray by certain people, certain operators,

1699
01:29:55,240 --> 01:29:57,160
where he thought, oh, that sounds like a fun idea.

1700
01:29:57,160 --> 01:29:58,040
But he wasn't.

1701
01:29:58,040 --> 01:29:58,520
I don't know.

1702
01:29:58,520 --> 01:30:04,360
I think maybe he was spread too thin and he couldn't assess all the parts of the restaurant.

1703
01:30:05,080 --> 01:30:07,320
I feel like look at the E.T. ride.

1704
01:30:07,320 --> 01:30:09,800
Look at other theme-y things he's done.

1705
01:30:09,800 --> 01:30:12,840
I feel like he wasn't really involved in it.

1706
01:30:12,840 --> 01:30:13,160
I don't know.

1707
01:30:13,160 --> 01:30:17,720
This just feels like not something he spent a ton of time on.

1708
01:30:18,600 --> 01:30:20,760
But what about Katzenberg?

1709
01:30:21,880 --> 01:30:22,840
In a way, I guess.

1710
01:30:22,840 --> 01:30:24,840
No, it feels more Katzenberg than Spielberg to me.

1711
01:30:25,400 --> 01:30:30,920
The timing works out where Katzenberg could have had early meetings with Siegfried and Roy

1712
01:30:30,920 --> 01:30:35,000
about Father of the Pride and taking them to Las Vegas Dive.

1713
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:35,800
Oh, you're right.

1714
01:30:35,800 --> 01:30:37,480
It's really close to the Mirage.

1715
01:30:37,480 --> 01:30:38,360
It's where they work.

1716
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,160
Do you think that's where it was born?

1717
01:30:41,160 --> 01:30:42,520
They workshopped ideas.

1718
01:30:44,120 --> 01:30:45,560
I'm just saying it's not impossible.

1719
01:30:45,560 --> 01:30:46,840
Jason's just asking questions.

1720
01:30:46,840 --> 01:30:48,360
I'm just asking questions.

1721
01:30:48,360 --> 01:30:49,160
I'm doing my own research.

1722
01:30:49,160 --> 01:30:50,280
Like Lynn Wood.

1723
01:30:50,280 --> 01:30:50,600
Yeah.

1724
01:30:50,600 --> 01:30:51,720
Just asking questions.

1725
01:30:51,720 --> 01:30:52,280
Siegfried.

1726
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:55,880
There was an old racist guy who worked in the bar.

1727
01:30:57,720 --> 01:30:58,840
And the grandpa racist.

1728
01:30:58,840 --> 01:30:59,880
And he could be in there.

1729
01:30:59,880 --> 01:31:00,840
That's Sarmody.

1730
01:31:00,840 --> 01:31:01,880
Oh, Sarmody.

1731
01:31:01,880 --> 01:31:02,280
Yeah.

1732
01:31:02,280 --> 01:31:03,480
That's our Sarmody.

1733
01:31:04,040 --> 01:31:05,800
Our least favorite character in fiction.

1734
01:31:05,800 --> 01:31:06,760
I think so.

1735
01:31:06,760 --> 01:31:07,000
Yeah.

1736
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:07,640
That's about it.

1737
01:31:07,640 --> 01:31:08,280
Oh, no.

1738
01:31:08,280 --> 01:31:11,160
Someone else ordered the cappuccino mixed with the punch again.

1739
01:31:12,920 --> 01:31:15,320
So it is the Katzenberg of restaurants.

1740
01:31:15,320 --> 01:31:16,280
We can maybe agree.

1741
01:31:16,440 --> 01:31:25,960
I guess the final question is if it was around right now, LA or Vegas, would you go?

1742
01:31:25,960 --> 01:31:26,680
Would you be excited to go?

1743
01:31:26,680 --> 01:31:27,240
Yeah, of course.

1744
01:31:29,240 --> 01:31:30,200
I'd go a lot.

1745
01:31:30,840 --> 01:31:31,160
Yes.

1746
01:31:31,160 --> 01:31:32,360
I'd go all the time.

1747
01:31:35,480 --> 01:31:36,040
Yeah.

1748
01:31:36,040 --> 01:31:36,360
God.

1749
01:31:37,320 --> 01:31:42,360
If only we could leave here right now and all go do shots at that sitting on a torpedo.

1750
01:31:42,360 --> 01:31:42,680
Sure.

1751
01:31:43,320 --> 01:31:45,720
I would say real quick, we're like a plus it up.

1752
01:31:45,720 --> 01:31:49,240
Everyone shared their ideas real quick, but I feel like maybe it was just what we were

1753
01:31:49,240 --> 01:31:51,640
talking about size too big.

1754
01:31:51,640 --> 01:31:56,040
What if it was like a 25 seat place and it was like a real, it was like the sub on the

1755
01:31:56,680 --> 01:32:03,240
20,000 leagues ride at Disney and you ate in like a tiny little immersive area of experience.

1756
01:32:04,200 --> 01:32:06,200
Would that be more, I mean, I think.

1757
01:32:06,200 --> 01:32:06,760
Intimate.

1758
01:32:06,760 --> 01:32:12,760
That's what I was thinking in terms of, yeah, like to bring more of what it's like on a real

1759
01:32:12,760 --> 01:32:14,520
submarine to the experience.

1760
01:32:14,520 --> 01:32:17,560
I was, I actually did, I looked up some facts about life on a submarine.

1761
01:32:20,200 --> 01:32:24,360
You basically, I mean, you go out for hundreds of days a year.

1762
01:32:24,360 --> 01:32:24,600
Right.

1763
01:32:24,600 --> 01:32:25,560
Very cramped.

1764
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,800
Life is divided into three, six hour segments.

1765
01:32:29,800 --> 01:32:31,320
So there's no like days and nights.

1766
01:32:31,320 --> 01:32:32,360
There's no sunlight.

1767
01:32:33,320 --> 01:32:37,560
You sleep in coffin size racks in a manner they call hot racking,

1768
01:32:37,560 --> 01:32:39,960
which is three guys to every two beds.

1769
01:32:39,960 --> 01:32:41,080
It's like the Star Wars hotel.

1770
01:32:44,840 --> 01:32:50,200
I read an interview with Walter Lyon, who was a Navy diver and a fire control technician who said,

1771
01:32:50,200 --> 01:32:54,840
if the curtains rocking don't come a knocking, which was I think a reference to masturbation,

1772
01:32:55,400 --> 01:32:58,120
I don't know how this would have been incorporated in the restaurant.

1773
01:33:01,880 --> 01:33:07,640
They should have allowed you to go have a casual sub there, but also rent it out as a jerk off motel.

1774
01:33:07,640 --> 01:33:08,120
Yeah.

1775
01:33:08,120 --> 01:33:08,360
Yeah.

1776
01:33:08,360 --> 01:33:11,880
Make sure to try the hot, you know, the hot cookie with ice cream afterwards.

1777
01:33:11,880 --> 01:33:13,720
And that's the jack off rack.

1778
01:33:14,920 --> 01:33:17,800
You're on a date and it's not going well where it is going well.

1779
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:24,280
That's a, they asked this guy, are there, this was like a military magazine website, Navy website.

1780
01:33:24,280 --> 01:33:26,360
Are there any interesting submarine rituals?

1781
01:33:27,080 --> 01:33:31,400
He said, whenever you have a major accomplishment in the maritime community,

1782
01:33:31,400 --> 01:33:33,320
you have this big ceremony.

1783
01:33:33,320 --> 01:33:37,880
Like when we cross the equator, we have a ceremony, which basically culminates in us singing songs,

1784
01:33:37,880 --> 01:33:43,000
crawling around on our bellies, swimming in urine and eating M&Ms out of a fat person's belly button.

1785
01:33:43,560 --> 01:33:48,120
Typically the biggest fattest guy is dressed like a baby who wears a diaper and gets covered in

1786
01:33:48,120 --> 01:33:50,600
whipped cream, malt vinegar, mayonnaise and mustard.

1787
01:33:50,600 --> 01:33:53,880
You gotta do what you gotta do to have some fun.

1788
01:33:53,880 --> 01:33:57,400
So maybe something like that would have made the restaurant more fun.

1789
01:33:58,360 --> 01:34:03,000
So like full on insanity, full on Sodom and Gomorrah level debauchery.

1790
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:07,000
You're mind rotting for being under the sea for too long.

1791
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,320
Going inside from cabin fever.

1792
01:34:09,320 --> 01:34:11,000
This is an official Navy magazine.

1793
01:34:13,080 --> 01:34:13,580
Yes.

1794
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:18,840
Very cool that many of these subs are armed with nuclear weapons.

1795
01:34:19,640 --> 01:34:20,440
Very cool.

1796
01:34:21,480 --> 01:34:22,360
Oh my goodness.

1797
01:34:23,240 --> 01:34:32,360
So the, the, where they went wrong was that they had substantial desserts, but that you didn't whip,

1798
01:34:32,360 --> 01:34:39,320
lick whipped cream out of the belly of the heaviest person on your, in the restaurant,

1799
01:34:40,120 --> 01:34:41,480
of the 300 possible diners.

1800
01:34:41,480 --> 01:34:44,120
I guess they would have to weigh everyone who came to eat there.

1801
01:34:44,120 --> 01:34:44,840
It's George.

1802
01:34:46,840 --> 01:34:48,440
That is what I recall about George.

1803
01:34:49,720 --> 01:34:50,440
George passed away.

1804
01:34:52,120 --> 01:35:01,000
And on that note, wow, Jason Waller, you survived podcast the ride, the first celebrity edition.

1805
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:01,960
It's an honor.

1806
01:35:01,960 --> 01:35:02,520
Thank you so much.

1807
01:35:02,520 --> 01:35:03,240
That was such a blast.

1808
01:35:03,240 --> 01:35:08,120
Thank you for learning about dive, for coming in with research, for coming in with submarine

1809
01:35:08,200 --> 01:35:11,960
knowledge that we will never escape our brains.

1810
01:35:11,960 --> 01:35:13,720
That'll haunt us forever.

1811
01:35:14,680 --> 01:35:16,760
Let's exit through the really expensive gift shop.

1812
01:35:16,760 --> 01:35:18,600
Is there anything you'd like to plug?

1813
01:35:18,600 --> 01:35:19,320
Oh geez.

1814
01:35:20,600 --> 01:35:21,560
No, no.

1815
01:35:21,560 --> 01:35:23,080
A Mystica by Chris Angel.

1816
01:35:24,520 --> 01:35:26,280
Previews beginning March 11th.

1817
01:35:26,280 --> 01:35:26,680
All right.

1818
01:35:26,680 --> 01:35:27,000
Okay.

1819
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:30,040
Check out wherever tickets are sold for a Mystica.

1820
01:35:30,040 --> 01:35:32,920
Eva Anderson, you also survived podcast the ride, but you'll be back.

1821
01:35:32,920 --> 01:35:33,560
I'll be back.

1822
01:35:33,560 --> 01:35:34,600
You'll see me soon.

1823
01:35:34,600 --> 01:35:34,920
There's more.

1824
01:35:34,920 --> 01:35:35,720
Hear me soon.

1825
01:35:36,040 --> 01:35:38,040
I'm more even to come.

1826
01:35:38,040 --> 01:35:39,080
We're so happy about that.

1827
01:35:39,080 --> 01:35:44,920
And as for all the celebrity happenings, find us on the socials at podcast, the ride

1828
01:35:44,920 --> 01:35:49,000
merch is available in our T public store, which I feel like we should jack up the cost

1829
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:50,120
of just for this month.

1830
01:35:50,120 --> 01:35:54,840
Can we get a lot to say you spent $600 on the usual on our regular shirt.

1831
01:35:54,840 --> 01:35:59,000
But does T public, do they allow you to put our logo on a heavy leather jacket?

1832
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:01,720
Like a leather bomber jacket with a Spielberg arms?

1833
01:36:01,720 --> 01:36:02,840
Like an eight ball.

1834
01:36:02,840 --> 01:36:03,340
Yeah.

1835
01:36:03,800 --> 01:36:04,300
Actually.

1836
01:36:06,200 --> 01:36:07,480
We might move a lot of those.

1837
01:36:07,480 --> 01:36:11,240
Purple and white, like, or why maybe white or like purple arms?

1838
01:36:11,240 --> 01:36:11,960
What do you think?

1839
01:36:11,960 --> 01:36:12,440
What color?

1840
01:36:12,440 --> 01:36:13,160
White.

1841
01:36:13,160 --> 01:36:14,920
Usually the canvas part is white.

1842
01:36:14,920 --> 01:36:15,720
Canvas or white.

1843
01:36:15,720 --> 01:36:16,360
Arms are purple.

1844
01:36:16,360 --> 01:36:18,840
Purple arms with a big logo on the back.

1845
01:36:18,840 --> 01:36:24,520
Take the colors of one of the cocktails at dive and the colors of another one of the

1846
01:36:24,520 --> 01:36:30,360
cocktails that dive, split it down the middle and it's both seven different shades on each

1847
01:36:30,360 --> 01:36:31,400
half of the jacket.

1848
01:36:31,400 --> 01:36:32,280
We should do that.

1849
01:36:32,280 --> 01:36:33,800
God, I want that really bad.

1850
01:36:33,800 --> 01:36:34,520
Just make one.

1851
01:36:35,400 --> 01:36:37,800
And everybody can share and we, yeah, you're right.

1852
01:36:37,800 --> 01:36:43,240
And we send it to a special fan who will then send it from fan to fan.

1853
01:36:43,240 --> 01:36:45,880
That's sisterhood of the traveling pants scenario, if you will.

1854
01:36:45,880 --> 01:36:46,600
Yeah.

1855
01:36:46,600 --> 01:36:47,080
Yeah.

1856
01:36:47,080 --> 01:36:49,320
Everybody's going to feel so bonded by the end of that.

1857
01:36:49,320 --> 01:36:50,440
That's beautiful.

1858
01:36:50,440 --> 01:36:50,920
Okay.

1859
01:36:50,920 --> 01:36:55,640
Well, we'll do that and find us on the second gate at patreon.com slash podcast,

1860
01:36:55,640 --> 01:36:58,200
the ride where there's a bunch of celebrity fun.

1861
01:36:58,920 --> 01:36:59,480
Yeah.

1862
01:36:59,480 --> 01:37:01,000
Set your bar at Spielberg.

1863
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:02,600
Just calibrate it right there.

1864
01:37:02,600 --> 01:37:06,280
And then just imagine not submerging like submarines going up, up, up.

1865
01:37:06,280 --> 01:37:11,560
And that's who's coming next week on the second gate, bigger than Spielberg.

1866
01:37:11,560 --> 01:37:13,240
Dream as big as you can dream.

1867
01:37:13,240 --> 01:37:14,120
Get ready for it.

1868
01:37:14,120 --> 01:37:15,240
Happy celebrity.

1869
