1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Forever!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Dog!

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Warning! The following haunt cast is part...

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Playful Spooks have interrupted our yearly tour.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
A pranky spirit has detained us and demanded an entire episode to himself.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Kindly remain subscribed as we explore his legend, his triumphant return, his hat,

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and an even spookier ghoul named Jared Leto.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Please enjoy your two-hour intimate look at the Hat Box Ghost.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:56,000
It's Haunted Mansion 5 on Haunt Cast The Fright!

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Does everyone know what to do?

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
You fucking don't, you don't again, I'll do it.

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Seven weeks! No one did, I'm the only one who does the assignments.

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I remember what we're supposed to do at the top of the episodes, and this one's important, guys.

14
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I think you really let JC down, not Jesus Christ, James Cameron.

15
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Because we need to honor that it is seven weeks until Avatar, The Way of Water.

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
And...

17
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Here's what I'll tell you, I got in the car and I said, you know what you're gonna do?

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I swear I'll listen to the end of the episode. I swear this is true.

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I got in the car and I go, I'm listening to the end of the episode.

20
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I got distracted by something, I started driving, I said, oh, Chromio has a new song.

21
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
And I completely forgot to listen to the end of the episode.

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
You'd rather listen to that than your own voice, definitely.

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,000
No, I understand in general, but I was leaving and I go, the last thing you have to do for research for the episode is listen to the end of the episode.

24
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Completely lost it. Listen to the new Chromio song, which is good.

25
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Great.

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
And then I fucked up. This is what happened. My name is Michael Carlson.

27
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Well, no, it's not. It's Michael Norrell.

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Michael Madson.

29
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
There, I gave it the oomph.

30
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Thank you.

31
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I'm Scott Grave Digner.

32
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Yeah.

33
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Oh, there's Jason Skeleton.

34
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Yeah, I'm here. I was just mostly focused on like, all right, leave a little early so you can get a cup of hot coffee.

35
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
It's too cold. Too cold this morning for iced coffee.

36
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
So, you have iced coffee in the fridge, but you gotta go somewhere for hot coffee.

37
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I've been thinking about this for seven weeks.

38
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Yes, and partially because I think in the time since we, since the last episode, and this is our yearly Haunted Mansion episode, or will become that after some Avatar bullshit.

39
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:48,000
But last year we were just like, well, with the yearly nature of this podcast, like that's a year is a long time for stuff to happen, for seismic shifts to happen.

40
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
And it's been a long, long wait for Avatar 2, for any of these avatars to come out.

41
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,000
It's the only franchise that moves slower than our yearly Haunted Mansion podcast.

42
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Right.

43
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,000
And, you know, in that year, I think I've, I think I got blue-pilled.

44
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Really?

45
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I got Avatar-pilled. I think much more so than I had been. I think I was starting to go that way, because that's my thing with the whole thing is like, I think the people, I think the people choosing Avatar and choosing to want to enjoy Avatar are the people choosing fun.

46
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
It seems like more fun on that side. And Mike, you were ahead on the curve.

47
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Yeah, thank you.

48
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
With this. You were the only, you were the first one, I'd say, on this show.

49
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
On the show, yeah.

50
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:37,000
We thought it was inexplicable that you had the reverence for the mighty Akron.

51
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
You invented this phrase to tribute this franchise.

52
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
And that you brought the spirit of Civico.

53
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:55,000
And you never lost it, and that includes last year when we said, do we think it will be coming out? We were within weeks of this episode. You kept the faith. I thought there'd be a delay.

54
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Right, because it's been delayed, what, a decade at this point? Avatar 2?

55
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
2009 was the first one.

56
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Yeah.

57
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Yes.

58
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:09,000
So thank you for that. That's a badge of honor, I guess, in a lot of ways for me to wear.

59
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I believed.

60
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I thought this was the year for sure, and it is. I mean, there's no way it's delayed at this point, right?

61
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
At this point, no, it's the big, like, Christmas release.

62
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:30,000
They made Tony the Tiger that I saw Frosted Flakes still. I haven't found the actual serial yet, but they wouldn't put out a serial with a tie-in to Avatar unless the movie was coming out.

63
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Yeah, unless they were pretty certain.

64
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
And then, someone-

65
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
You can't reel that back. There's no way to pull that back.

66
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,000
We've gotten multiple pictures of it at this point, because, like, the first one we were, like, briefly-

67
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
We thought it might be a joke, yeah.

68
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:51,000
It's real, it's a Photoshop, but then someone sent the big display from, like, Sam's Club or Big Lots or something, and it's like, oh, that's real. That's in real life.

69
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Yeah, confirmed.

70
00:04:52,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Tony the Tiger Avatar box. That's so- there's no going back now. We are full speed ahead to Avatar the Way of Water, and thus, we, as a unit, as a podcast, need to act, and so we are, and that is why this December, Podcast the Ride will present Feliz Navidad, The Way of Winter, a Yuletide celebration of all things Avatar.

71
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:32,000
We're figuring out what that's going to be exactly, but we're going to- there'll be at least several things celebrating Avatar, Pandora, the world of Avatar, at Animal Kingdom, and anything else that seems relevant.

72
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I think we're open to ideas, if there's sub-sex of Pandora world, if there's things- look, I think we've all spent, regrettably, little time in Pandora.

73
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
At least I have. I've only been there once. Mike, a couple times. Jason, I forget.

74
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Twice?

75
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:54,000
No, I was there, I think the first time with you guys, and then I was there with my family around this time last year.

76
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Okay.

77
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Yeah.

78
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Well, if there's- I mean, you know, there's big stuff we got to cover, but other- maybe- and you guys might even know, are there little elements of that Pandora culture that we have not hit?

79
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
There's the bowls.

80
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
The bowls.

81
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Yeah.

82
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
It's a Thule Canteen.

83
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
That's right.

84
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Well, that could be it.

85
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
We could talk about the bowls, because I've had a couple bowls.

86
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
The popping, popping bubble, the boba?

87
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I'm not a big fan of it, but we can talk about it.

88
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Okay.

89
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I tried it, yeah.

90
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
The popping, the popping bubbles.

91
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,000
We can talk about the floor, like the floor, or the- I should say the ground with the colors in it.

92
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Yeah.

93
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:35,000
You know what I'm talking about? At night, it gets supposedly, like, gets very colorful. It doesn't get as colorful as I kind of said it would, but it's still interesting.

94
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I haven't been there at night.

95
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
What?

96
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
The timing has never worked out for me to be there at night.

97
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
So I'm missing a big part of it.

98
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
You simply must go at night.

99
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Let's not forget the other big part of it.

100
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
The bathrooms halfway through the line of Flight of Passage.

101
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Oh yeah, good point.

102
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
And we've only done the line.

103
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
The episode we did about the ride was not about the ride.

104
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
That's true.

105
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
It's just about the line.

106
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
So we could still discuss the actual ride of Flight of Passage.

107
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I mean, I don't know.

108
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
It seems to me like bathrooms is going to take precedence over the ride.

109
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Well, that's, you know-

110
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
People know us.

111
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:11,000
You could make an argument that we should have done just the office with the big tank.

112
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
That should be its own episode.

113
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Sure, yeah.

114
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
With the Unobtanium and the little, whatever, that little illusion or what?

115
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
That's not an illusion.

116
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Is it floating like on Parker Selfridge's desk?

117
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Is that a blue pill?

118
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
It is Parker Selfridge.

119
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
It is Parker Selfridge.

120
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I believe it's his desk.

121
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
No, I don't think it is.

122
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
No, it's not his desk.

123
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
No, it's set way after.

124
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,000
In the time when Parker Selfridge was alive and on Pandora, we don't know what's going

125
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
to become of him in way of water and seed bearer.

126
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
But it's like that little illusion where there's like a magnet or something, I think, under

127
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
it's making the Unobtanium sort of move around or a different-

128
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
It's maybe just not even Unobtanium.

129
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Maybe it's some sort of a disease or it's a COVID disease or something.

130
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Something.

131
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
It's in a little jar.

132
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
That was the initiative.

133
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
So it got released from a lab on Pandora.

134
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
It's possible that COVID came from a lab on Pandora.

135
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
It's like when you're-

136
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Dr. Augustine's lab is where the origin-

137
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Not enough people are going after Dr. Augustine.

138
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
People didn't realize that that's actually the place.

139
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
That's the lab theory.

140
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
That's my lab theory.

141
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
No kidding.

142
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I don't remember if Dr. Augustine, now I don't remember.

143
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Actually, I think I forgot too.

144
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Dr. Augustine's Sigourney Weaver, right?

145
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Yeah.

146
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
And Dr. Ogden is the right exclusive.

147
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
All right.

148
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
We're embarrassing ourselves again here.

149
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
It's Dr. Ogden is the office in the line.

150
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Flight of Passage could be the first ride where we do Flight of Passage 2.

151
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Like in big fights, in boxing or wrestling where it's like two people meet again.

152
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Yes.

153
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Well, I still think we-

154
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
See, you guys are salivating for twos.

155
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Let me tell you behind the scenes-

156
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Oh, I wanted to say-

157
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I always want twos more than anything in the world.

158
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Indiana Jones and E.T. too.

159
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Indiana Jones too.

160
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I'm waiting for-

161
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I'm so excited to do twos for things.

162
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
But yes.

163
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I feel like Scott is the lone holdout of one.

164
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I want to do twos yet.

165
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Seems to say, new things are fun.

166
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Aren't these new?

167
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
New things are good too.

168
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Battle with Ogden and Mansions.

169
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
New things are good too.

170
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
We ride these things for a reason because it feels good to go home.

171
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Nothing else to do also.

172
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
And we haven't even talked about three.

173
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Sometimes the rubber match is the most exciting one.

174
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
That's true.

175
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
You're right about that.

176
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
That's right.

177
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
So we'll brush up.

178
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
We'll make sure we get the right names for whose lab is which.

179
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Well absolutely.

180
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
It's been a long time.

181
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
We will get our act together.

182
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:38,000
But truly listeners, if there is some subsect of Avatar, Pandoran culture that we need to hit, let us know.

183
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Because Feliz Navidad will be here before we know it.

184
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Okay, great.

185
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
That's very exciting.

186
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Yes, Jason?

187
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Let me ask you a question.

188
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
All right.

189
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
And I don't want to spoil if a picture is coming.

190
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
But you sent us the Disney shop.

191
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I didn't buy it.

192
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
You didn't buy it yet.

193
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
What are you talking about before you answer the question?

194
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Someone finish the sentence.

195
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
The baby Navi Halloween costume.

196
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
There's a Navi baby costume I found on Shop Disney.

197
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
And I realized you've moved.

198
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I don't have your new address.

199
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
And I was like, oh, I should buy it and send it to him.

200
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
And then I was like, oh, will it arrive for Halloween?

201
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I think it was for a bigger baby.

202
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
So I was waiting because it wouldn't be ready for Halloween.

203
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Okay.

204
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,000
So yeah, maybe next year when everyone says like Avatar,

205
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
like Double Fever or something,

206
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
because we're going to be so jacked up after a wave of water.

207
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
They're going to be ready for the Seed Bearer.

208
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
What's the next one?

209
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Seed Bearer is the next.

210
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Yes.

211
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Is that right?

212
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
And we will be addressing in 2024.

213
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
That's in two years time.

214
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I was thinking how with these yearly episodes,

215
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
it's funny how by it being at the very end of October,

216
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:53,000
we are now I think perpetually tied into a couple things.

217
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Election fears.

218
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Oh yeah.

219
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
We got midterms this year and we want this to go well.

220
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
We want Herschel to get in.

221
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Very nervous that our boy isn't going to take it all the way like he did on the football field.

222
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
We are.

223
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Yeah.

224
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
And we're rooting for Dr. Oz.

225
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
We are also agents.

226
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Yes.

227
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Memet.

228
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
What's his name?

229
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Yes.

230
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Memet.

231
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
We are also on the payroll of Turkey.

232
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
We are also secret.

233
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
We are agents of influence from Erdogan.

234
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
President Erdogan.

235
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
You stumped me.

236
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I, I, Memet Oz has like very close relations with the country of Turkey and everyone's like,

237
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,000
that's not great for senators to be super close with other countries.

238
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
It's fun.

239
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Look, I've only just learned about this man in the last six months.

240
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I don't know about any of his previous dealings or I've heard something about a television show he had.

241
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I don't know.

242
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:57,000
All I know is that he's a salt of the earth, Pennsylvania guy, just a real, the most regular Pennsylvania boy, which you should root for.

243
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I am rooting.

244
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I'm hoping he shows up at the world series.

245
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
My beloved Phillies go into the world series.

246
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Oh, that's right.

247
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Oh, that'll happen between now, right at the beginning of the year before next year.

248
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Congratulations.

249
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
The day this comes out.

250
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Okay.

251
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
The day this comes out.

252
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Yeah.

253
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
So, so there's a lot.

254
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Yeah.

255
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Would you finish your thought?

256
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
We also have to, we're locked into haunts.

257
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
We're locked in a haunts recap every year now.

258
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I'm just saying there's always, I think there's, there's some stuff coloring these haunted mansion episodes.

259
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Yes, that's true.

260
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
There are fears about how elections are going to go.

261
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,000
And in 2024, God knows what the fuck will be happening then in terms of the big election.

262
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:39,000
And we're also going to be really nervous about is the seed bearer of the same high watermark as the way of water.

263
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
That's a good point.

264
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Yeah.

265
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
It's going to be a rough episode.

266
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I'm happy we got a minute.

267
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Like, you know, cause this fit, like, like, remember how we felt in 2020.

268
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
That was crazy.

269
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Yeah.

270
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:58,000
This, this one feels like at least, you know, there's, there's bad stuff going on, but like, at least we can take a breather on all that seed bearer stress.

271
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Exactly.

272
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Yeah.

273
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
The seed bearer that we can call.

274
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
And we know way of water is going to rule.

275
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
So we actually, we should take a nice deep breath, nice deep breath of water.

276
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Let's all breathe in some water.

277
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Breathe in some water.

278
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Speaking of, there's someone here who that last year, this title could not apply to you, but this year it can.

279
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
We have our very own seed bearer.

280
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Carlson, the seed bearer.

281
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
We say seed bearer.

282
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Does that mean that you had a child?

283
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I think so.

284
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I don't know what it does in the film, but doesn't it?

285
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I mean, it makes, you know what I was talking about.

286
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I do.

287
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I'm a father now, a seed bearer, if you will.

288
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
What should the woman be?

289
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I was going to say the woman's probably the one who has the uterus is the seed bearer.

290
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,000
She bears, Lindsay is the seed bearer in this instance.

291
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
She'll be thrilled to have that title applied to her.

292
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Yeah.

293
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
You're the seed bank?

294
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
The seed bank?

295
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
The seed shooter.

296
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Is that the Prince song seed shooter?

297
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Or no, it's a, oh yeah, he wrote it, sex shooter, but it's, that's a, is it Vanity or is it?

298
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Apollonia 6.

299
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Apollonia 6, thank you.

300
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Yes, so that's true.

301
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
That's a difference from last year.

302
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
More of like a seed factory, I think.

303
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Yeah, that's, yeah.

304
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Oh man, yes.

305
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I mean, I guess it's all student.

306
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
If you're lucky, you're a seed factory.

307
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Yeah, yeah.

308
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
And you're a salt of the earth.

309
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I'm a lot like, who's called a factory guy?

310
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Dr. Oz is, yeah.

311
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Look, I'm just a humble man with a seed factory.

312
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I'm just trying to keep my seed factory in order and Brandon gets in the way.

313
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Brandon wants to shut down the factory.

314
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
But anyway, big, big jumps.

315
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
These, I just think we need to track some of these things.

316
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
There's one other thing in the re-listen, and I'm sad you guys didn't get to hear this,

317
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:55,000
in checking out Haunted Mansion 4, something strange happens in it, which it is the first,

318
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:02,000
not the first time, but it is the first reprise of the endless Lake Nona argument.

319
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
There was the initial time that it came up and Jason was mad about Lake Nona,

320
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:12,000
and then it comes up in Haunted Mansion 4, and the strangest thing is it is clear as day.

321
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
You fully say, oh yeah, I got confused.

322
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I confused the housing development, I confused the city with what Disney's trying to do,

323
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
and actually misspoke and I apologize.

324
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
You're saying it's resolved completely.

325
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Completely resolved.

326
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I admit my, yeah.

327
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:32,000
And then in May, it became the biggest argument in the history of the show.

328
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I don't know what happened between October and...

329
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I don't know, yeah.

330
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
God knows, God knows.

331
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I'm just lost at this point.

332
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Yeah, I initially thought it was just like when a real estate agent makes up, you know,

333
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,000
this is the cool new neighbor, oh well, everyone's moving to Franklin Village in Los Angeles,

334
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
you know, just makes up...

335
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Well, that's not a new, that's been around for...

336
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
He's saying it as an example of his name.

337
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
As an example of marketing.

338
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Yeah, it was around for a while, so I thought, I didn't realize there actually was a Lake Nona...

339
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
A thriving community where many listeners live.

340
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Apparently.

341
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I have...

342
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Numerous wrestlers who can hit me with chairs.

343
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I think if we wait a couple months, maybe we can get it going again.

344
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
We can just turn it over?

345
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Think if a couple months go by, we can wait and do it again.

346
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
We forget all these things, we forgot Augustine and Ogden and we'll forget.

347
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
So embarrassing.

348
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
So that we can reprise...

349
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:40,000
This is somehow I'm less into doing part twos of episodes and more into just the arguments coming back.

350
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Oh yeah, full argument episodes, yeah.

351
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
That's a good idea.

352
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Man, people are probably wondering when we started actually talking about it,

353
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
about the mansion that is, I have some ideas, let's do it at the end now that I'm thinking about it.

354
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Sorry.

355
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Yeah, yeah.

356
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I have a couple things I want...

357
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Like different anger mating threats for all of us?

358
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
No, no, no, no, it's more mansion related.

359
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
It's you and I being punished if we don't do things right.

360
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Interesting.

361
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
So we'll do it at the end, we'll do it at the end.

362
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Oh tantalizing.

363
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Okay, well you know, you're right.

364
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Let's move things along and let's officially get into Haunted Mansion 5.

365
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Here we go.

366
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:20,000
And folks, if it wasn't clear already, this is like when the ride stalls.

367
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:26,000
This is like when you get stuck and you hear the announcement about playful spooks have interrupted your tour.

368
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
And we are stopping in the place where you the most want to stop.

369
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:38,000
In a ride that stops on almost every time you're on it, what would the Omni Mover, it all has to stop if there's any issue in the load or the unload.

370
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,000
And we are stopping our tour right in front of the Hatbox Ghost.

371
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Oh baby, here we are.

372
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
It's all Hatbox Ghost.

373
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:58,000
This is the app we, yeah, when we negotiated the terms of these episodes, this was very important I think to us to have an episode just about...

374
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
To you.

375
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
To me specifically.

376
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Well, Jason, what about Jason?

377
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Well, I remember there was a lot of hubbub about the Hatbox Ghost when he returned and they were kind of like, you know, really ramping up like the mystery.

378
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
What happened?

379
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Was he really there?

380
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Was he removed?

381
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:20,000
He's in the children's record about the Haunted Mansion and these drawings.

382
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Did anyone see him?

383
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:28,000
And then like, so yeah, I think I agreed that like, yeah, we can dedicate to this guy.

384
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
The most popular ghost, I think.

385
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
The most popular happy haunt.

386
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Yes, on the ride.

387
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Could be.

388
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
There's the most story to it.

389
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,000
And hey, look, I mean, I had to wrap my head around it.

390
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I had to like, K, I guess.

391
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
But you know what?

392
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,000
We've done, we've certainly done tributes to single characters.

393
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
You know, we've done botanicus.

394
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,000
We've done the dirty footed pirate only from Pirates of the Caribbean.

395
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:02,000
And, you know, if anybody deserves it, it's the Hatbox Ghost.

396
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Yeah, sure.

397
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
It's Hattie, which I've seen.

398
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I saw a number of places just referring to him as Hattie.

399
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I'm anti Hattie.

400
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
When I started hearing that, I was like, that is cutesy.

401
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I don't like the sense.

402
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
You know, I guess tell today we're talking about old Hattie.

403
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
It's a little familiar.

404
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
It's a little presumptuous.

405
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Old Hattie.

406
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I am not a fan of calling him old Hattie.

407
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Thank you.

408
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I don't like that.

409
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I mean, I think this would come up and then I would just get like,

410
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Oh, right.

411
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
What?

412
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
What do you mean?

413
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Hattie over and over.

414
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I mean, I'll call him Hattie on the episode because we're going to say his name a lot,

415
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I think, just for variation.

416
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Short hand.

417
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Yeah.

418
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
But yeah, no, it's not my hatbox ghost is the way I like to refer to him.

419
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
The proper, the full, full formal name.

420
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:48,000
And look, I also, you know, I've had my issues in years past where there has not been like

421
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
maybe the momentum that we needed to actually start talking about things on the ride.

422
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Yeah.

423
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
But I think that's the thing on the ride.

424
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
And I, by stopping and focusing on just one character, this is now,

425
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,000
we're now at the least in the realm of the thing that I'm fearing on these episodes always,

426
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
which is no, no, no, stop, stop, stop.

427
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Right.

428
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Like, well, there's no way.

429
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Look, we're stopped.

430
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I assume we, this will be, unless you're talking about twos,

431
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
we might fall right into hatbox ghost two before you,

432
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
but the sooner we get to it, I guess.

433
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Well, I don't, I will say a lot of the mystery has since been said.

434
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
The mystery has since been solved.

435
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Like a lot of like, what is he, what happened?

436
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
And he's been back for like seven years now.

437
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
And so I think we're, we're good.

438
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
You know, I think a lot of the young men is that do you not?

439
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Jason, no, no, no, I've got plenty of Jason.

440
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Are you feverish?

441
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
What are you talking about?

442
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
What do you mean?

443
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Enough has been said.

444
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
We haven't even done the episode.

445
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
We don't know how much we discussed.

446
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
We could do a second one.

447
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Are you crazy?

448
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Well, I, I, this was the, the, I want to imagine year where I'm like,

449
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
well, this is kind of an open shop case fellas.

450
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
But I want to explain the case.

451
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I want to talk about the case.

452
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Yeah.

453
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
There's a, well, there, there's a bunch here.

454
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Chronologically, where we have finished last year, we exited the attic.

455
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:11,000
And that is the point where in today's times you enter sort of a,

456
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:17,000
you know, kind of a void, kind of a like amorphous zone.

457
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
That's not like a clear.

458
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
It's basically exiting the mansion.

459
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
You're falling out of the mansion.

460
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Yeah.

461
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Well, technically not yet because the ghost is right before,

462
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
right before you fall the turn away.

463
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
And we were not going to talk about the turn that the, the turn.

464
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Well, no, we can talk about when it turns to face the ghost.

465
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
We can talk about the, yeah, the doom buggy turning to face.

466
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
And I guess some of the, cause you can see them for some of the descent,

467
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
but only some as soon as you can't see the ghost anymore,

468
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
that is next year's territory.

469
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,000
But just chronologically it's we've exited the attic, but,

470
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
and that's, and we,

471
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
so we're in the zone where the hat box goes lives today.

472
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
And as Jason said, has since 2015,

473
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
since this legendary character was brought back,

474
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:06,000
but his place in the ride itself or so people believe,

475
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,000
and it's all a little ambiguous, the history of,

476
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
but like presumably he was in the attic.

477
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
He was where the bride was.

478
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Okay. Yeah.

479
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:21,000
And the bride was over where the piano was the harpsichord or,

480
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Oh, that's what it is. The bride was in a different place.

481
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Yes.

482
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Okay.

483
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Because you kind of, you rotate,

484
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I believe Tony Baxter was the one who said you for years,

485
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
you would rotate towards nothing for a second,

486
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:39,000
because that was where he was where the bride would like,

487
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,000
put your focus onto where a certain item was,

488
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
but there wasn't really any.

489
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Yeah.

490
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
And now the harpsichord I believe is there.

491
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Is it a harpsichord or a piano?

492
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I saw it referred to as a harpsichord, but it could be.

493
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
I think it's a piano.

494
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
There's a piano earlier in the ride. Isn't there?

495
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Yeah. Well, there's a, there's an organ earlier in the ride.

496
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Victor Geist is playing the organ earlier.

497
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Are you talking about someone else?

498
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Isn't there another piano?

499
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Probably another piano.

500
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Okay.

501
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
But there, you know,

502
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
what do you think of it as a piano in the attic?

503
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
The one that the shadow is playing?

504
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Yeah.

505
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
I would, I, I want to say that that is, I don't know for sure,

506
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
but I would want to say that that's like a tack piano,

507
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
which, which, which is the like jangly.

508
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Yeah.

509
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I forget how you give it the tack effect, but like it's, it's very,

510
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
it's very specific type of noise.

511
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Like, yeah.

512
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
So yeah, that's where the bride was.

513
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
And he was, yeah, he was in the, he used to be in the attic.

514
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Yeah. And the assumption being that that's the bride.

515
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
That's the groom.

516
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Yes.

517
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
And his head is set.

518
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,000
The way the effects should have worked was that when her heart beats,

519
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
his head disappears.

520
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
And then reappears on the next.

521
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Is that right?

522
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Yeah.

523
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
They were like a kind of a.

524
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
It was supposed to be synced.

525
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Wow.

526
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
With the heartbeat.

527
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Oh, interesting.

528
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Wait, and just to fully, I mean, I think listeners know,

529
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,000
but the intrigue in what was cool about this character and is cool about this

530
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
character.

531
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
He is a, a ghoulish figure.

532
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Who, depending on when you see him, but possibly.

533
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
He's got a skeleton like head.

534
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
On the, in the place where a head should be.

535
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,000
And then there is a magical vanish and his head.

536
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Moves magically down to his hat box,

537
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:27,000
leaving nothing where his head should be.

538
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
And this happens back and forth, back and forth for as long as you're,

539
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
you're looking at him.

540
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
And it's just a cool idea.

541
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
It's a cool, it's a very cool.

542
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Illusion as it's done now and probably was intended to be a very cool illusion,

543
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
but it didn't quite work out.

544
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
It worked.

545
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
They said it worked in Imagineering with like controlled space,

546
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
but then when it was in like an open, a little more open area,

547
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
it just didn't work.

548
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
You could see both heads, I think at the same time, or it was just,

549
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
it just didn't look as cool as it did when it was in Imagineering.

550
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
It did not cool on site.

551
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
They build these things.

552
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:04,000
It was, it was built at the Glendale facilities and they build,

553
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
they make these things in these little cubbies and with like curtains that you

554
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
can pull on and like really control the environment.

555
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
But then everything else gets installed and you see it in context.

556
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
And I think you were also,

557
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:19,000
I think maybe the guests were so close to it that you could very easily see the,

558
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
the shifting of the lights and wow,

559
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
wherever they were actually doing that effect.

560
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,000
This is, there's a picture of Yale, Gracie, like fiddling with it.

561
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:35,000
And one Imagineer who kind of researched the Haunted Mansion said like,

562
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
oh, that's a test model.

563
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
That's not in the mansion.

564
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:43,000
This is supposedly the lone picture of it in the mansion that Doombuggy's found

565
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
this a while ago.

566
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
This is re, but a recent uncovering.

567
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Recent uncovering.

568
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
And there's some very grainy.

569
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Also recent.

570
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Recent like super eight or 16 millimeter footage.

571
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Yeah, there was a debate whether the ghost figure was actually on the ride or

572
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
not for decades.

573
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Yes.

574
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
This is the lore that we're getting why there's a little more here than just,

575
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,000
he's a cool animatronic is that it became like, you know,

576
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:13,000
essentially almost at any point that you'd went on this ride from 69 to 2015,

577
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
when they did a new version of it,

578
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,000
you did not see this character that have boxed ghost unless well,

579
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
this is what was murky.

580
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,000
And I didn't, I never knew any of this or tracked any of it that like, no,

581
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
sometimes you hear, no, it was gone before the ride even opened.

582
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,000
But then internet discussion starts in the nineties and people are like, no,

583
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
I saw it.

584
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
I swear I saw it.

585
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
And other people say that's impossible in the chronology.

586
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
But, but people had, so it became like, well,

587
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,000
is this a Mandela affected situation or not?

588
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Did people see it or not?

589
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
And I think it was pretty not, you couldn't track easily.

590
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Tony Baxter claimed to have seen it. Right.

591
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Tony was like there in the first week and he claims he saw it for sure.

592
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
And people, they ran through the mansion.

593
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
He said there's a video where he's going through the mansion.

594
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
I'm sure you've seen part of it. At least he's talking about like,

595
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,000
they got to go on it like for two straight hours when it opened.

596
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Yeah. Hours and hours worked at Disneyland.

597
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:10,000
He's an employee and now legendary imagineer was a, an employee doing,

598
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
I don't know what, at that point,

599
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
I think he was not ice cream scooper.

600
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
I think he moved up from that at that point,

601
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
but he was something else. I don't know where he was in the park at that point.

602
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Yeah. And so it seemed eventually confirmed.

603
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,000
It was there for cast member previews, maybe some soft openings,

604
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,000
but like a month or less it was there. And, um,

605
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
well, you know what? Hang out. We're, we're jumping to like,

606
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:38,000
this is the like, the, the like sleepy real stuff about it. Yeah.

607
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:44,000
The legend really, what was propagated for a long time was the idea that

608
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:49,000
this figure was so scary. Yes. This effect, uh,

609
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:55,000
so like shocking and important that it was too scary for the ride and had to be

610
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:00,000
pulled before really guests started to get to go to letters about this and

611
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,000
complaints at city hall. And they were like, we got to yank this.

612
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
It's far too terrifying. Even though, uh, I,

613
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
I saw something where it's like, well,

614
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:14,000
that head sculpt is also used a version of it is used on the hitch,

615
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,000
the one hitchhiking ghost, one of the hitchhiking ghosts essentially has the

616
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,000
same. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. So it's a very familiar looking character. Um,

617
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:28,000
but this, so anyway, you've got competing lore of like, oh no,

618
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:33,000
I think it just maybe didn't work out right versus no, no, no.

619
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:38,000
This was the scariest thing you ever could have seen. And, uh,

620
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,000
which is, you know, more exciting mythology, but also how, you know, look,

621
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:47,000
it's a, it's a scary effect. It's certainly very creepy and very off

622
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
putting, but like how could,

623
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:53,000
what version of that is so scary that guests are that adults are just like

624
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,000
scarred. They have to go lie down as soon as the rides over.

625
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
It's like terrifier too. Uh, right now it's just happening.

626
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,000
There's a grossest core movie with a clown. You know what I'm talking about?

627
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,000
No, I don't know. There's a indie clown movie. That's the,

628
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,000
the sequel to a movie called terrifier. And it's a really scary clown.

629
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:17,000
And it's making people throw up and pass out in the theaters. Oh, it's so gross.

630
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:21,000
And it just, I always get like, I watched a clip, someone posted of it.

631
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,000
And it is, it's scary when the clown knifes you in the face,

632
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:29,000
but like does a vertical slash on the face. That is kind of scary.

633
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
But then like the further shots, it's like, well,

634
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
you can tell that's not a hand. You can tell that he's ripping apart.

635
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:39,000
I think you should watch it and report back. Oh, I should. Yeah. Is it strange?

636
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
I haven't seen it. The first one is, but the second one's in theaters and it's

637
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,000
cleaning up. People want to go see this and pass out. Oh, okay. Yeah.

638
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,000
So I mean, that's probably also partly legend of it. Yeah. Like, oh my God,

639
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,000
if people are dying watching the movie, but also I do think it's super gross.

640
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:57,000
From what I hear like fifties kind of like the tingler type. Yeah.

641
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Gimmickry that imagine a film so scary. Yep. Which is so this can't be.

642
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
That's the hat box ghost in 19. That's the hat box ghost.

643
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Maybe times were different. Maybe somehow this was so, and after all the,

644
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:13,000
all the buildup, which we went over that this like there's legend kicked into

645
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:18,000
this ride before it even opens that years pass and that meant that building is

646
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,000
standing there with no label, with no sense of what it is.

647
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Like what, and then like, is the, is the ride itself so scary that they refuse

648
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,000
to even open it? Yeah. Or is the building haunted? Like have people died working

649
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:36,000
on it? There is all this crazy lore and I think it all really crystallizes in

650
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:41,000
this character. It's an accidental perfect situation of like lore and then

651
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:45,000
it all converging like probably in the night, like yeah, nineties or something.

652
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Yeah. I don't think there, I don't think there was a place for the, the myths

653
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:56,000
and the legends to gather pre internet. No, no. Like this must've been way less

654
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
of a thing in the, in the seventies, eighties. Yeah. You would have to talk to

655
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:04,000
a bunch of weirdos in person to get this stuff. Yeah. The letter column of E

656
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:09,000
ticket magazine was only so big, you know? Yeah. I do want to give credit to,

657
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:15,000
I think, you know, with the technology they had in the later sixties trying to

658
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:20,000
sequence a beating heart effect with like a black light coming up on a face and

659
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:27,000
then a tiny spotlight coming up in a hat box is an audacious idea. Like it is

660
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:32,000
crazy at that. I'm sure would be difficult, a little less difficult with

661
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:37,000
technology now, but like that is a crazy effect to try and do. And I think it

662
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:41,000
wasn't just people were so close. There was just too much ambient light in the

663
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:47,000
attic that it didn't get dark enough in the way that in a room full of blackout

664
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:54,000
curtains, it probably was dark enough for the effect to work. And I, it's so,

665
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:59,000
it's crazy that it is back now where I feel like the attic is only brighter. It

666
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,000
has only gotten brighter as technology has made lights brighter, but they're

667
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:07,000
doing it in a different way. Like you have to, I mean, this, like from the

668
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:11,000
photos that you can see of this Imagineer, you know, Gracie working on it,

669
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:17,000
it is like, it feels very much like the ballroom dancers, the, the, the ghosts

670
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:24,000
who are very like, yeah, right. Like the figure seems delicate to me, right?

671
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Whereas now it's sort of this digitally lit, you know, you have the, the control

672
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,000
over it in the way you would the stages where they shoot the Mandalorian, you

673
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,000
know, you can like really accurately dial in level of brightness, but it's just

674
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,000
dim enough and it is kind of impossible to do in this analog way.

675
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Here, by the way, this is actually, I think more terrifying. These are the

676
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
schematics of the original guy.

677
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:54,000
And now what you're showing us is like, this was some proof that it did exist

678
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,000
because there's also the question of was it ever there at all? And this is like

679
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:03,000
from a manual that proves, no, no, no, here's the framework of it. Like they

680
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,000
made blueprints with like really, you know, super detailed of what all the

681
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
parts of it are.

682
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Yeah. And I, I, there was also a rumor. I hadn't heard this before, but in some

683
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Jim Hill podcast or article that the link doesn't work anymore. He said that

684
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Mark Davis said that I think the hat box ghosts became one of the Eagles in

685
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:34,000
America sings. I think the actual animatronic became this. And then other

686
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,000
people in line were like, I'm sorry, I'm afraid that's not probably not right

687
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:43,000
because he's just a bunch of tubes and a head, like tubes and metal rods in a

688
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:47,000
head, which makes the drawing that you're showing us very unsettling, but

689
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:51,000
because it's very, it looks very Mars attack alien where there's a creepy

690
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:56,000
skull. And then the only thing he's, he's just, he's skeletal. It's like, he's

691
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:01,000
just a tube man. It's those are incredible drawings or schematics.

692
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:08,000
I mean, this on its own unintentionally is like an awesome piece of art. Yeah.

693
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Yeah. It looks like an old, like a, like a 1800s, uh, weird outdated medical

694
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:18,000
textbook. Yeah, for sure. It's this I, I'm trying to think when I learned of

695
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,000
this, it's probably it's at least I really only learned about it maybe a

696
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,000
decade ago. I think, did you know about this when you were younger? Cause you

697
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:29,000
were a little more into the magazine stuff. Not really. No, no. Yeah. This,

698
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:34,000
this kind of snuck up on me. So this I think is a perfect story because people

699
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:42,000
want to imagine Disneyland is real and alive and it's a fun thing to say that

700
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:47,000
there's some like actual mystery when it comes to this place and it's the best

701
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:52,000
version. I can't think of another story like this. That's as fun as this, like

702
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,000
there's all the different rumors you hear about Disney, the dark ones, uh, nobody

703
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,000
dies on property, whatever that stuff. But like, this is like the most fun

704
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:05,000
version of like, well, I don't know. Maybe it's blah, blah, blah. Maybe it's

705
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:09,000
this. Maybe it's like, this is the most fun before they brought it back and

706
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:13,000
before it was sort of recorded history. Like the most fun way to like speculate

707
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:18,000
of like some little fun, real, maybe it's real. Maybe he went away. Who knows?

708
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,000
You're saying this is more fun than the lamp. The lamp in our house. Well, the

709
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,000
lamp is the new hat box ghost is what I think now we can discuss the lamp and

710
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,000
did the lamp change overnight and didn't Walt actually ever see this lamp? It was

711
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
the idea. Did he ever enter it? Was it a type of lamp that they made when Walt

712
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:39,000
was alive? Right. Yeah. It's magic lamp that kept burning through the pandemic.

713
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Walt said, if there's ever a pandemic, give people the lamp. They need hope.

714
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Then the lamp. Yeah. So the lamp is the new ghost. But in a pre lamp era when we

715
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:56,000
needed some excitement. Because yeah, I mean, I never had actually tracked. In my

716
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,000
head, it was just, yeah, nobody's really sure if it was there or not. So before I

717
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:07,000
knew the timeline, which was interesting. And some of the lore and the

718
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:12,000
mythos comes out of the fact that, like I said, as soon as, you know, by

719
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:19,000
September 1969, like the second month of operation, for sure you go on this ride

720
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:24,000
and there is no hat box ghost. But if you were a nerd for this stuff, following

721
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:28,000
this stuff, looking at any ancillary media, you might have been like, where's

722
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:33,000
that ghost? Yeah, sure. They used the ghost. The ghost was by I saw an

723
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:37,000
advertisement with a cool like line drawing of him. And then there was this

724
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:43,000
record slash book. Like the record is a reading of the book and the hat box

725
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:49,000
ghost is in that. So he's in materials that exist outside of the right, which

726
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:53,000
might might have made people think he was in it. Like, no, I remember him

727
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:58,000
because there's that hitchhiking ghost that looks similar or he's in the record

728
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,000
or whatever. Like in my head, it was possible that it was never available to

729
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:07,000
the public to see and people were just conflating all of the stuff. Yes. And I

730
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:11,000
think like there's a lot of interview before when it was just like a Guillermo

731
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:16,000
del Toro is going to do a new non Eddie Murphy Haunted Mansion. He was the one, I

732
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,000
think, who really sort of brought up a lot of like, oh, it's about the hat box

733
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:23,000
ghost. If you don't know what that is, that's this thing. And he probably had

734
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:27,000
the record. He probably had all of it because he's got a house full of concept

735
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,000
art. Yeah, but he's got him saying he has probably a house full of like old

736
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,000
shit. I mean, he does have a house full of shape. He probably like has the record

737
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:40,000
and stuff enough to like have found the still kind of seldom examples of hatbox

738
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,000
ghost being talked about. Here's a quick clip just to play it of which I'm mainly

739
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,000
playing because it's Thorol Ravenscroft, my favorite voice, who's also one of the

740
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:52,000
singing bus. This is just his quick his mention in this storybook slash record.

741
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:59,000
He was a cloaked figure with an evil grinning face. A hatbox hung from his

742
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:07,000
hand. That's that. OK, it's not much, but if you're like that could the with the

743
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:11,000
attached image that could linger with you as a kid. And you might be like

744
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:15,000
somebody might have heard this in 1970 and then not gone to Disneyland until the

745
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:19,000
80s and thought, where's that go? Where's that hatbox guy? Well, it brings up a

746
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:24,000
good question to me. Is he the most popular ghost if he's he never got

747
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:30,000
removed? Is it is so much of the fun of him? Is it because it was decades of

748
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:36,000
being holding of withholding the ghost? You think he is now for sure? I know

749
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:41,000
legend. There was no legend. Do people care about this? Is does he become

750
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,000
because I was wondering, is there some world where he's sort of like the mascot

751
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:49,000
of the ride in a way ahead of the hitchhiking ghosts who now sort of if you

752
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,000
need to like represent it abstractly, who are you going to meet in there? It's

753
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:59,000
the hitchhikers. Maybe Lyoda. Yeah, I guess Lyoda is after the hitchhikers. But

754
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:03,000
yeah, hatbox ghosts might be taking the lead. But I'm saying does he take the

755
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:07,000
lead if they just use that original robot that when those pictures and it's a cool

756
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:11,000
effect and it works. But does he just become another one of the of the ghosts

757
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:15,000
and hitchhiking ghosts still are like kind of the big thing because people are

758
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:19,000
like they followed me home. They were in the mirror and interesting. You know what

759
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:23,000
I'm saying? Like he doesn't now he's been so showcased and now his robot is much

760
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:27,000
better than the other robots and he looks very cool. The only one who got one made

761
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:34,000
got a very cool robot and legend. He's a legend now because of that. Yeah. Is he

762
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,000
the legendary? Does he have his own podcast? The ride Haunted Mansion episode?

763
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:44,000
I don't think he does. Yeah, I think part of the story is important context

764
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,000
because it wouldn't have been as cool even if that if they're sort of like if

765
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:53,000
they'd figured out whatever the 60s jankiness was it probably would just be

766
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:58,000
as fine as the some of the stuff in the ballroom. So he would I'm sure

767
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,000
people would like him but I didn't have a few decades of like Chinese democracy

768
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:08,000
buildup. Very good comparison. Guns and Roses a long-waited. I think hatbox ghosts

769
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,000
delivered a little better than the eventual release of Chinese democracy. I think that's right.

770
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Guns and Roses that has been out for 10 years I think. That's right. Yeah. 10

771
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:22,000
glorious. We all we revisit it each each Christmas season with our loved ones.

772
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,000
You know what it really if I could do another pop culture analog because it's a

773
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:33,000
character in a highly anticipated property who's it was far enough into the

774
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:39,000
like as far as anybody knew this guy's in it so he's in the artwork in the case in

775
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,000
the metaphor I will make that I'm talking about a character who there were

776
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:47,000
toys made of like this guy get ready to like this guy I think the hatbox ghost

777
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:54,000
is the constable Zuvio. Yes. Haunted Mansion. You don't know if you maybe we

778
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:58,000
should still do a glossary of Deep Star is Curious but this is who was supposed

779
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:03,000
to be in the initial in Force Awakens. In the first line of Force Awakens toys

780
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:09,000
that came out before the movie one of the characters was Constable Zuvio. A very

781
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:15,000
intriguing name like hatbox ghost. Yes. Like a constable. He's maybe in a trailer

782
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:19,000
I forget but people were there was a lot of constables Zuvio buzz before that

783
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:24,000
movie came out and then if you saw Force Awakens he's not in the movie. Don't

784
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:30,000
know where my friends friends of mine such as Buzz Buzz made a video for

785
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Funny or Die that I liked which was like let's make something about everything

786
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,000
like everything that's going to we think is going to be on Star Wars based on the

787
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:42,000
seven things they've said and the great Josh Fadim plays Constable Zuvio maybe

788
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:49,000
the only on screen constable Zuvio. Oh wow good point. I think so. I mean he played

789
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:56,000
he's like kind of a high jinky guy falls over a classic Zuvio lie which I if his

790
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Zuvio was in the movie I might like the movie more. Dave Filoni come on get Josh

791
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:08,000
to play Zuvio on one of these. Yeah. Josh Fadim not Josh Gad. No no Josh Fadim yeah.

792
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Has Gad not had enough. Yeah no I mean I wasn't but you put Gad somewhere else I'm

793
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:18,000
just saying for Zuvio. I was just wondering when you talk about casting and nerdy properties

794
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:24,000
and you say Josh I go right to one place. I hear you. Make Josh Gad a different constable.

795
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:30,000
A new constable. That's what we want. Fadim is Zuvio. A bunch of brothers who are constables. Yeah they can be in the same

796
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:36,000
scenes together. There's a historic precedence with that with Star Wars 2 because the lead up to

797
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:44,000
episode 1 there were two two big lead ups one was Samuel Jackson is a character named Mace Windu

798
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:51,000
and I think he has less than 10 minutes of screen time in episode 1. That's true. And then the other character

799
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:58,000
who I think you could send proof of purchase away for and get it. I Mike you might know his name he has

800
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:06,000
like a cone head kind of head. He's on the Jedi Council. He's in it right. Yeah he's in it.

801
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Why can't I think of this guy. He has a cone head. You could send away for this action figure and they were Dark Horse

802
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:17,000
comics also had like a four issue series so everyone was trying to read the key. Ki-Adi. Ki-Adi. Yeah.

803
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:25,000
I'm sorry Ki-Adi Mundi. Is that right. Is it. Is this guy's name Mundi. Oh wow. You're right.

804
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Is it Mundi. I don't know. I've never heard it pronounced. I'm going to say this is wow. Star Wars is a Mundi.

805
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Maybe there's a Clone Wars episode where somebody says his last name or his full name. Not as disappeared as Constable Zufio

806
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:43,000
but him and Mace Windu like leading up to episode 1 those who are the little like and these guys are coming get excited

807
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:52,000
and they're barely in the movie. The whole Jedi Council is doesn't have much to do. The whole Jedi Council Mace Windu gets much more action in the second and third.

808
00:43:52,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Yeah and he gets to talk to Yoda at least. Yes. He gets like one on ones with Yoda at the very least but yeah Mundi doesn't get to talk to Yoda.

809
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:07,000
Oh man they don't give Mundi anything to do. Poor Mundi. Yeah at all is not. Oh man. Hey it's the light side and dark side at the World Series this year.

810
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:13,000
The Phillies versus the Astros. That's right. Jason versus Mundi. I don't know who to root should we even know. You know what actually I do.

811
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:19,000
I had no opinion on the matter until last night seeing Ted Cruz front and center. That's right. By no one played.

812
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:29,000
So I'm going Phillies for that reason. And who was front and center at the Phillies game? Star of Top Gun Maverick, Miles Teller from Downing Town, PA.

813
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Everyone had a great time at the Maverick. Miles Teller, someone who I've tolerated for at least three weeks. And he's Jason's guy now.

814
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:46,000
He's my guy now. We were talking about like I don't know he was pretty chariot. Top Gun Maverick at SNL. Then he's at the Phillies game.

815
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Yeah I know. He's kind of good on SNL. I can't believe I'm saying this. So Avatar and Miles Teller you've come around to.

816
00:44:53,000 --> 00:45:06,000
I'm Miles Pilled. I haven't watched the Godfather TV show. That looks excellent. I love the scene chewing. I love Feud, Betty versus Joan.

817
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:17,000
That mini series is so great. I don't think those are comparable though. I don't think it's as good. I mean yeah I don't think he's it's probably delivering like Jessica Lange, Susan Sarandon facing off.

818
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Yeah yeah we'll see. We'll come. You know in three years that'll be all we talk about is Teller on the offer.

819
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:33,000
But anyway back to the Zuvio of the mansion, the Hatbox Ghost. Here let's talk a little before we get even dive back into legend.

820
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:42,000
There's things about this character that exist regardless of form, regardless of if he's drawn on a book or in a figure that got removed or the figure today.

821
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:51,000
I mean just that the effect is cool. The box is cool. That he's like hunched over. There's a lot of character just to the way that he that he holds it.

822
00:45:51,000 --> 00:46:05,000
Like he's holding it in a mischievous manner like I got something here and we know that he's maybe not the best with walking. He's got his his his like crooked cane which has a more specific term but I'm not because shalali.

823
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:12,000
Is that right? Well that's like a claw like that's a thing you beat someone with. I guess you would use a shalali if it's big enough as a walking stick.

824
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:25,000
I think I saw that word applied to unless I'm crazy. But you know it's at least a cane. He's got a gold tooth. That's a distinct facet of him.

825
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:36,000
He does seem to have more person that I will give it to. I didn't want to completely take away what is interesting about him but he does seem to have some interesting things about him that really stick out more than some of the other ghosts.

826
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Yeah. The kind of his is like asymmetrical eyes which maybe they aren't exactly but it's just the way the pose is where one is wide and kind of frightful but the other one's more furrowed and shriveled up like it's a you know it's an off putting facial pose for sure.

827
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Yeah. The doodles of him for the kids records and kid stuff can also you can make him cute. Like he's cute. He is cute. He's pretty cuddly and he's got kind of like a shock of fuzzy hair. He looks like kind of a Hanna Barbera guy in that version.

828
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Oh yeah almost. Do you think even before we start talking about like what we think do we think we should maybe get into sort of this history of hats in general?

829
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Because I looked up some interesting stuff about you actually did. Yeah just a little bit. I mean I did. I didn't listen to you. You were going to find a way to screw me. Well I just don't screw. I mean I didn't listen to the episode but I did look at I did watch a video called World Hat Story 101 about the top hat.

830
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:51,000
Well I guess we better. Hat of the modern man. Oh. I mean Jason do you know anything about the top hat? Um I know it used to be very labor intensive and the phrase man as a hatter comes from like mercury used to be used in the blocking process.

831
00:47:51,000 --> 00:48:03,000
That's interesting. I know you're doing this to needle me but that is interesting. Well people hadders had mercury heads. It's also interesting the top hat sort of replaced the sugar loaf hat you know because that's more of like kind of a pilgrim hat type hat.

832
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Which would you prefer Jason? Sugar loaf? I just need to I'm going to double check a sugar loaf hat before I make a decision. I can't picture that off hand myself either. Just Google sugar loaf. Um but then also yeah there's obviously it didn't completely. Should he not put hat in? Just sugar loaf will do it? Sugar loaf.

833
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:38,000
What is it? We can talk about sugar loaves too. That might be for its own episode about sugar loaves. Sugar loaf seems like the transitional point between like pilgrim hat and like 10 gallon cowboy hat. Yeah yeah. It's kind of man in the yellow hat. Yes exactly. So he was sort of a throwback as well.

834
00:48:38,000 --> 00:49:02,000
The top hat John Heatherington is the presumed creator of the top hat who was an English haberdasher. And it was first worn in public in January 1797. Wow. So it's an old thing. This is what folks this is the Met Gala of its time. People were like are you crazy? You're not wearing a sugar loaf hat?

835
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:17,000
But soon enough it becomes the norm. That's right. And it was still it was like a wealthy thing. You know this is a it's always been a fancy hat you know. Mr. Monopoly wears it and I think people like the Mr. Monopoly of the 1800s would wear it as well.

836
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:41,000
So this suggests again we need this history because it suggests something about the character of of the hat box goes to be able to analyze him thoroughly. Are you are you saying like in a socio economic fashion by him wearing a top hat and by even you know what by having a hat box because that's a whole I don't know if anyone has the history of the hat box.

837
00:49:41,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Well God forbid. But you know because that's I was thinking like do you guys anticipate in your life ever owning a hat box. I could see Jason having a hat box. I was I did write down like do people know about in the modern age you people learn about hat boxes from this character this attraction.

838
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:23,000
You know because I think you know upscale if you're buying like a real hat like a blocked hat men or women's hat you still get a hat box. But like how often do you do that in your life nowadays. Once or twice for some people if ever. You know has anyone ever gotten a purchase a hat not that not like a cap right.

839
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:52,000
A hat that requires I've never I don't think I will ever be commissioning a hat to be made to my specifications. Right. Yeah I think if you are going to a place where you're getting like a fully from scratch like made fedora or cowboy had 10 gallon hat you might still be getting or like high fashion like if you're going to Neiman's or Bergdorf's or stuff you might be buying something that comes in and because the pair of hats is a hat box.

840
00:50:52,000 --> 00:51:08,000
Comes in and because the packaging is part of the luxury. You know Bergdorf's a regional inner heard Bergdorf. That was the place that that's the fancy department store whose restroom used in New York. Bergdorf Goodman's. It's next to the Plaza and Central Park.

841
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:22,000
Is this like a am I supposed to know that when you used the restroom that story. I told this story when we were in New York because I went in the Plaza we wanted to see the lobby of the Plaza Hotel and most of it is like blocked off for non hotel guests or if you don't have a reservation.

842
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:36,000
There's so many people trying to retrace the steps of Trump. Yes. That's right. Like we can't so many people they're trying to recreate people are getting down on their knees and a little knit cap and another guy in a big coat pointing the way to go. Yeah.

843
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:49,000
Yeah. So if you are you never owned a top hat in a serious manner. Right. No. No. No. Not nor have I though I do kind of want when I turn like 40 I'd like to start wearing a cowboy hat but I think it might be too much.

844
00:51:49,000 --> 00:52:08,000
Can I actually looked up the I can't believe I'm staying on inventor of the top hat but I looked at John Heatherington is just such a name I wanted to see more and this is I'm confused by what I'm reading this is Wikipedia and I don't know if what we're talking about is the top hat but there was an incident with this guy.

845
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:34,000
Oh yeah yeah I saw this yes in 1797 he was charged with breach of the peace and inciting a riot. Yes because he'd appeared on the public highway wearing upon his head what he called a silk hat which was shiny luster and calculated to frighten timid people and the officers of the crown stated that several women fainted at the unusual site while children screamed dogs yelped and a younger son of cord wiener Thomas no not core.

846
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:48,000
Poor son has he not had a difficult road enough. It was thrown down by the crowd which collected and had his right arm broken. So there is a this is I thought this was interesting because this is like the legend of the half box goes.

847
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:56,000
This seems like bullshit doesn't it. A guy wore an experimental hat that made women shriek dogs yelp and it was as bad as arm broke.

848
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:07,000
It was a hat that was a few inches taller than a normal hat and it's slightly different just slightly different shape and it caused a panic and a riot. This seems like a made up story does it not.

849
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:22,000
In a time where people. Yeah it's also look Wikipedia is saying oh look in the Wikipedia the common form of the story has reproduced in many then subtitled put in by Wikipedia which books many which books.

850
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:37,000
Yeah it seems great and also like a slightly taller hats wear a powdered wig like a normal sane person kill him kill the demon kill the boy and the younger cord wiener Thomas.

851
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:53,000
It's so this is yeah this is exactly like the half box was the legend of the top hat is filled with like oh was it the scariest moment when people saw it to a people not able to handle a hat that was double the size of normal.

852
00:53:53,000 --> 00:54:07,000
Specifically when I look up silk hat it looks like the hats you know that opening shot in the prestige with all the hats just kind of like and you don't know what you're seeing but it pays off later. Oh right.

853
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:23,000
Could you show just that like one minute of film to someone from the past and they would just lose their minds. Look at all those hats look at all those tawdry hats. Yes they got to be institutionalized.

854
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Also I according to that YouTube channel or initially it was usually like beaver fur was used to make a top hat until the decline of the beaver industry. Hmm. So then it was probably what a fine industry that must have while Trump said he was going to bring back the beaver industry but he didn't.

855
00:54:43,000 --> 00:55:00,000
I believe beautiful beavers. We love them they're making dams we can make hats out of their fur. He if he went on TV was talking about beautiful beaver. That's the way the late night hosts would have a field day and it would have sunk his career certainly for a presidential candidate to be so

856
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:23,000
wanting to see beautiful beavers. Yeah no that would have sunk him for sure. I think became very popular be some sort of fur or pelts that were easily acquired in America became very popular in France to wear beaver to wear like yeah items maybe of beaver and and so like an influx of money into the early America.

857
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Yeah America's founded on the beaver industry. Yeah I wish we were like grinding up beaver bodies but it was yeah it was it was really awful whatever it was without knowing any details. Look back in the past you were either being scared of hats or you were grinding up beavers.

858
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:55,000
Yeah the truth one or the other. It sucked. What kind of man are you? Beaver grinder beaver or a hat shrieker. 50 percent of the food you eat it's got bugs in it and they're not supposed to be there.

859
00:55:55,000 --> 00:56:12,000
Some people you can call a top hat a high hat or a topper which I like that. I think that's a cute way to call it. I got my topper here. Topper. Yeah. So I think this is all important context for the character of the hat box ghost to know where he comes from and what he's all about.

860
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:28,000
I don't I should disagree with you and yet I think maybe it does. I think it does. Yeah because if he's dealing in it just implies he is a fancy ghost and this is a ride full of fancy ghosts. That's maybe it. There's some status throughout this.

861
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:45,000
There's also speaking of Wikipedia like barely sourced things. Some one of these Disney fandoms which are always pretty shade Disney dot fandom dot com had the the tidbit of info. He was a milliner though this has yet to be clear in the attraction itself.

862
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:59,000
Okay so he's not then. So you made that up. So it's bullshit then. There's a lot of that on these Wikipedia. Well here it says he's this and here it says he's like it's it's not really until we see the Jared Leto movie which was will be definitively what the hat box.

863
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:10,000
He's playing the hat box ghost in a movie next year which I guess that's a big thing between the years. What you what what date does that come out. I'm sure it's before.

864
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:26,000
No let me throw this out. Should we delay next year's Haunted Mansion episode to fully just talk about the Haunted Mansion movie. Oh man. I'm not saying we do. I'm just throwing it out. No by precedent by precedent. Okay. We have we did the Eddie Murphy movie.

865
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:43,000
On the second day and sit alongside these are not the same track. Okay. I cite precedent to say please can we not. Okay we only do a beleaguered second. I'm imagining you wearing a beaver top hat when you're saying this because you're saying precedent like an old timey judge or something.

866
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:59,000
I say precedent. Hmm. August 11th 2023. Hmm. Interesting release date early. Yeah. A little early trying to make early for Halloween but like just the tail end of like summer started to taper off like August was very grim for movies.

867
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:26,000
Well past summer you can make an argument though that people are starting the Halloween season earlier and earlier every year. So that's appropriate. Well in Christmas I saw some Christmas is already here Jason. I saw a post about like oh Universal Studios Hollywood when you walk in the entry where there's already garland on the fake New York like for Halloween and there's a week left of horror nights and they've got like Christmas decorations.

868
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:55,000
The snow is on the castle at Disneyland. Yeah. Yeah. And oh I never mind. I won't talk about that. That's about my annual pass that I can't renew now. Oh you probably can't either. Oh I can't. Yeah. Unless you did it. No Jason did it. Jason's the only one who has a magic key right now. Didn't you have like a there's no grace period. There wasn't a 30 day. I don't believe so. And I might have been past that as well. We're locked out until they decide they allow us to buy another one. So fine with all this bullshit. I'm fine. I mean I'm annoyed.

869
00:58:55,000 --> 00:59:25,000
Yeah. Yeah. I'm annoyed. It's been annoying there. It's just annoying to me if they never release them again. And like well again they did last fall knows what they're going to do. Yeah. It's all over the place. Next year. We'll know. We'll have such a pile of new frustrations and confusing kids. It's a it's a not it's not a magic key anymore. It's a pixie dust pouch. So make sure you have your pixie pouch. I'm sorry you don't have enough dust in it today. You can't get in. Well when pixie pouches are

870
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:55,000
announced at least that'll give us a chance maybe on the ground floor again. So I'm all for that scenario. Yeah. As long as we can be opening day of I I'm not sure which way to go if we because there's stuff to talk about with the movie with the movie. But do we stay on kind of legend. Sure. Well should we talk about the return or do you want more? I've got a little stuff on what actually happened. So look you know let's

871
00:59:55,000 --> 01:00:25,000
go back to the legend surrounding it. Did they pull it because it's too scary. Did actual guests get to see it. And what seems to have been pieced together is it was around for employee previews where Tony Baxter saw. He was like one of the only sources on any of this. Yeah. A little while. And he says well it's very possible that they could have also been like soft opening previewing it for guests and guests saw it then. But there's only this very mild window where it could have happened. And over the years through the 90s as the story is coming like it took forever. But this site doom buggies

872
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:41,000
tracked it and a picture was found of it in context and a brief as a pruder esque video. Yes. Or you got to really know what you're looking for to see it. But so this there is proof that it was around for guests for a couple weeks.

873
01:00:41,000 --> 01:01:11,000
So then what why did they what a weird like not clean way to pull it's around for guests a little bit. The true story here I looked a little further into Yale Gracie who I'm sure we talked about in the first year or two. But I had to as with Dr. Augustine and Dr. Ogden I had to refresh my memory. And I'm sure we talked about him in the context of what he did for the mansion. But all their Disneyland stuff he basically he was the special guest.

874
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:28,400
Special effects guy. And that's a really particular thing to be the special effects guy in the 1950s and 60s. That's where you're using like weird Houdini magic. Yeah. Houdini magic to like it's it's all like it's it's practical effects to like the popularization of Pepper's Ghost.

875
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:46,080
Of anywhere in the mansion but still used today and raise the resistance and other stuff. And then comes from this guy because he was looking for theatrical effects that could have worked you know 100 years ago. Yeah. And they can still wow people in the park today. The let's see he worked on the lava in Peter Pan's flight.

876
01:01:46,080 --> 01:02:00,360
A little subtle touch that had to be cool and look real and be done on the cheap. We were just talking to the doughboys about the Blue Bayou restaurant and something we really lit up at. So it's such a big part of the ambiance there are the fireflies.

877
01:02:00,360 --> 01:02:15,840
Fireflies. Yeah. Bye. That's this guy. Wow. He did those which is like still what a huge part of being. That's like what you that's why the hassle of getting into the Blue Bayou is this subtle thing. And he used to guy used to complain about like

878
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:28,920
People trying to recreate stuff he wanted to do in with new fangled ways of doing things. And he's like no there's one way to do it. There's one way to do these fireflies whenever they try they mess it up. He was very particular. And I think people

879
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:35,280
Imaginers today are still like oh yeah this guy was he was right on the money but everything. He was a genius. Yeah.

880
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:50,240
Fire in pirates is this guy. And there's a really cool photo of him holding a pipe behind the fire. Oh wow. Like looking real like just like cool villain with the awesome orange lighting hitting him from behind.

881
01:02:50,240 --> 01:03:17,680
So anyway guy truly pioneering like so important to the history of theme parks and he's working in spaces nobody's worked in before. So he's not always going to get it right. And this is a thing that he didn't quite get right. As we said it worked in one environment but not in another. And the reason it got pulled is because he said I'm pulling it like it's not like anyone. There was no superior saying yeah you screwed up. Yank the hat box goes.

882
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:47,040
He was not happy. It drove him mad. He pulled it out himself. It was like Axl Rose hearing the first go at Chinese democracy and saying this these songs aren't good enough. I have a standard. Yeah. I need them to be as good as appetite for destruction. Yes. And then and he then he held to that standard and we can all we're all humming them in our we all we all know that's right. We needn't do it on microphone. He just couldn't take it anymore. And it stayed on the table. It was a very good song.

883
01:03:47,680 --> 01:04:07,840
But on site he had like kind of a sort of a bungalow office at Disneyland and it was just sitting in his office like taunting him like the raven. This kind of adds to it too. I never heard any of this. And it just really bugged him. And then it started getting stripped for parts not Jason as he said it's been debunked that he became the eagle in America sings.

884
01:04:07,840 --> 01:04:29,480
But he did like because it's translucent parts and like it got like robbed for various parts for the graveyard scene and for different characters in that. So that box goes really like disintegrated. It's like became you know parts of 12 characters essentially. And and it bugged Yale Gracie and he wanted to get it right. He never got it right.

885
01:04:29,480 --> 01:04:45,720
I say also you're Gracie sounds like a great guy quote Mark Davis great engineer. He was a great guy. I never drink a Manhattan without saying and his wife Alice and I agree on this. Here's to Yale because that's all he drink. Love it man. My favorite is a man and guy.

886
01:04:45,720 --> 01:05:15,640
I think he also did like martini lunches like on the Disney line 24 7. Awesome. Great. Drunk magic man. He was a perfectionist who didn't want to put stuff in the park. He didn't believe in. So that's how great. So really what happened is the guy who really wanted to bring this illusion of life couldn't do it which makes the 2015 reprisal so much more dramatic that it was like piecing together the dream of this this cool Manhattan drinking pipe smoking guy.

887
01:05:15,720 --> 01:05:40,240
Wow. Yeah. So it's almost like thinking of I mean it's not quite the same because the Yeti is still in Expedition Everest and it's not working but Joe Rody has left the company at this point but he had vowed for years he's going to fix it going to fix it now he's gone. Whatever happened he's with Richard Branson in space now. But maybe like somebody will have to do it in 30 years and finally fulfill. Yeah. His wish is to make that move again.

888
01:05:40,240 --> 01:06:10,160
They have to know that it's not going to move the needle attendance wise but if they can ever crack it all the nerds like us will be so oh my god the Eddie were it will be like in a certain subset it'll just like be a real like wave of excitement. The imagineers know that now. Well we ever have somebody who would rubber stamp green light that project for money again who wants to do something just because it's fun for that for the park and not because it's going to move the bottom. Well isn't this. Hey look isn't the 2015 have us.

889
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:24,760
Ghost and a lot of other things they were doing back then kind of a sign of sign of the times of those times in a good way. It's not shape back era where like I don't know what's more. Let's do bands here like what more what money adders can we throw in.

890
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:34,640
Right. You know this is like when that box goes got to come back it was such an era of like we don't need to do this but it'd be cool if we did it and it would make everybody happy if we did it. Yeah.

891
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:59,080
And it's funny because the 60th anniversary that 2015 it's fun when companies like this contradict themselves because there was a video about it like he's back on the Disney parks blog and they made a they did a post and they had a little video talking to a bunch of imagineers and they're like we thought it'd be cool to bring back for Disney's diamond anniversary you know diamond celebration.

892
01:06:59,080 --> 01:07:17,360
That was what they called the 60th and you know you've taught me guys I know the diamond but there's also a USA Today article from that time where the like lead on the project was like yes it's just kind of happy coincidence that it's lining up with the anniversary.

893
01:07:17,360 --> 01:07:33,120
We didn't do that on purpose but then there's also a video with a different imagineer going like as part of the diamond anniversary. So they have to fit the narrative the narrative fits whatever it fits. They didn't mention the narrative that is like well they didn't really do a bunch of new stuff for that time.

894
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:55,200
The anniversary pretty much just I'm with you I'm haunted by that anniversary not doing as much as we wanted it to do. Yeah there were supposedly so many things going to be announced didn't happen didn't happen. Yeah. As far for the course. Yeah point. That's true. But so yeah 2015 it comes back. I tried I learned a little about why that happened.

895
01:07:55,200 --> 01:08:11,200
Like as a yeah I think it got grouped into the diamond celebration of course but OK there is a podcast called Tomorrow Society with very good interviews with imagineers about their craft the stuff we don't we don't know about.

896
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:32,320
But yeah we don't have to be funny but like this guy talks to a couple of people who are part of this project. Daniel Joseph is one and Ray Spencer is another and I especially enjoyed listening to Ray Spencer. This is imagineers name. I don't know. We tend to only talk about like it's hard to find even like you got to be really prominent like a Joe roadie for a Steven.

897
01:08:32,320 --> 01:08:50,840
Know the name but Ray Spencer at the same at the very same time he had three projects going on. One was the redo of the Matterhorn. So like those screens on the lift hill now and the redo of the robots. Yeah very similar to this just like atmospheric didn't have to do it but the ride so much cooler because they did it.

898
01:08:50,840 --> 01:09:08,000
Yeah it's it's modern and digital but it feels it's not out of place in an old ride. And then he also did the redo of Condor flats the Soren era area into Grizzly Peak airfield. Also very charming. Also a like just they didn't have to but better that they did it right.

899
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:27,400
It makes the toppings bar more fun. Jason knows sure in a better mood and maybe end up loading up on more toppings. This guy also probably the ultimate. They didn't have to do it but thank God they did it. Buena Vista Street. That was his big project and the red car trolley. He was very passionate about trolley.

900
01:09:27,400 --> 01:09:47,160
Jason needs to know this. I mean I like this guy. Say his name again. Ray Spencer. Ray Spencer. Is the guy. His interview at tomorrow society was great. And you might think why can't picture this man. I've never seen him but you may have because if you go to California Adventure there is a place called Big Top Toys on Buena Vista Street.

901
01:09:47,160 --> 01:10:05,080
And as soon as you enter there is a conductor. Have you ever passed by this. A guy in a red jacket and a top hat. And that is this guy. And like the old cone. The shouting cone like an old director would use. We talked about him. We must have at some point.

902
01:10:05,080 --> 01:10:26,920
Yeah. Well come on. It might have been because my friends Tyler and Kia were at the park and they were like hey the park fan who's this. And I said I don't know but I'll find out. And I was happy to report that is an Imagineer who likes the circus and like strolls and did Buena Vista Street. And now I know he's part of that box goes to. So I got a good feeling about this guy.

903
01:10:26,920 --> 01:10:56,880
Does he still work there or is he done. Fired probably like everyone else. I'm not sure. It might be like a consulting. He does stuff sometimes. I think he might like do stuff for Universal. Yeah. Anyway he brought up interesting interview. I won't just like recite things from the interview. But a couple of interesting things about the product. It was not just we're going to make the hat box ghost again and plop him back in. There's some stuff we got to be concerned with. There was not a natural decision of where to put it because do we like evict a preview.

904
01:10:56,920 --> 01:11:26,920
This character and put it in the attic like it was. Or maybe we'll have the same problem. It won't really fit. And then they ended up carving out this little kind of cubby which I love. I love his spot. They also had to change the track slightly. That's something I didn't know about this. It is no they didn't just put a figure in because I'd never thought about this that the doom buggies it's not like it's a digital system. Right. Right. Pointing it from place to place. There's on the track itself there's some

905
01:11:26,920 --> 01:11:56,920
mechanism nudging your car turning it for the way that they want you to look. And that spot did not exist for that box goes previously. So they had to reroute the track and change it to make you to see you get to stare at it for longer as we're doing with this episode. Sure. Yeah. And they did it. I think they change and correct me if I'm wrong. They changed it. There was a point where they were teasing the hat box ghost where they sort of just put up kind of like a flat with like a window or something. It was like a window and like hiding. That was a

906
01:11:56,920 --> 01:12:26,920
It was up for a while. It was up for a while. I think they changed the track before but I could be wrong. I'm not sure if that's actually maybe they had maybe they did made it part of a bigger overhaul. Yeah. Just like one day. We'll just put that. We'll take the wall away and he'll be there. Oh that must be it. Yeah. Yeah. That's what happened. So correct me if somebody was kind of a digital window. I saw something about it's sort of a digital looking window and then it had one of this the owl stanchions from the line. Oh maybe. I don't remember. And then maybe something like it flies away or something. I think I've

907
01:12:26,920 --> 01:12:56,920
been going a lot around. We were going and I remember seeing the window and we we were talking about like when is that going to come. It's got to be here. It's got to be the hat box because they didn't say who it was but they said something's coming to the Haunted Mansion which is really that was awesome. There was a tease on the ride. Oh really. Like that I'm saying this was a tease on the ride. Okay. Versus like oh they're putting a thing on a ride and then it's just there. This was like something's coming to the mansion. There's a different thing now when you would go on it like that was teasing it in the right. Like I don't

908
01:12:56,920 --> 01:13:26,920
know. I can't think of a good example of like something new is coming to a ride but there's something there to suggest exactly where the new thing will be. I don't know. It's very it was very cool. It was like a trailer almost like you know things going to be. Yeah. It was like a real tease short teaser trailer and they they announced they did announce like a month before like the hat box goes back. Yeah. But it was before that where they were teasing some things here. Now it's new and neat. That's neat. Yeah. And yeah I remember

909
01:13:26,920 --> 01:13:56,920
it's interesting because sometimes when you try to find like when did this start what's the opening date it's like well this was the previews for cast members and friends and family and that's this was soft opening and this is the official record day. This one it's pretty definitive on all the Disney like blogs and stuff. The company websites like May 9th 2015 he's back. You can look at him you see him on the ride. Gotcha. It's here. Yeah it was like yeah you're right Scott. It's the it was this

910
01:13:56,920 --> 01:14:26,920
window if you can see that that's kind of yeah. Remember this. There's something with that owl. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But yeah it was like for sure you knew it was new when you went on the ride for the after like a refurb. I don't think I ever saw it in that era. That is pretty neat. What I remember now that we've talked about the kind of the how they put it together in the project just emotionally let me say I really I strongly remember seeing it for the first time. And when I say that I love the space that we

911
01:14:26,920 --> 01:14:56,920
have where he exists in the little space they carved out for him. What I love is that it so well utilizes the high backs of the doom buggies where you're heading to something and maybe you see a little bit of glow but you don't know what and then suddenly it just kind of like whips you there and now you're very very close to this character with who has this whole mythos and is just cool regardless of any of that. It's a good reveal. Yeah. Because a lot of it is you're like a lot of the

912
01:14:56,920 --> 01:15:26,920
pictures just looking at big rooms and you have to. Oh that's cool. That's cool. And you're looking at a million things at once. This is one of the only times with the intimacy. Exactly. That you want. This is that maybe the ultimate moment of intimacy because you only have one thing to look at the ultimate moment of intimacy like you can have as a person. Well that depends on who you are and what you're all about. You're not a seed factory. Well for me I am the seed. I am the seed. Like said like Walter

913
01:15:26,920 --> 01:15:56,920
White. I am the seed factory. He's nervously riffing because he knows it was artificial. Too intimate. Too intimate. No not artificial. Yeah I'm trying to think is there any other than maybe the hallway but that's the thing you're moving pretty fast through there and there's no like real face to face with a ghost in the hallway. Yeah. Yeah. There's like there's a pivot point. You know what it's like is the the trolls in the maelstrom where you

914
01:15:56,920 --> 01:16:26,920
head towards the trolls and then you turn from the central. Yeah. That you get to stare at him for a little while and then you go backwards away from. I guess that's Elsa also in the new but it'll always be the trolls in my heart. Sure. Yeah. Sure. The hit three edit troll three. Yeah. That's the three edit troll. Yeah. And then sorry if I'm good. I haven't done my maelstrom research over the fall. We'll get to that. We'll get to that before. But we'll do Indiana Jones to before maelstrom. No. No one wants that. They all want it. It's great.

915
01:16:26,920 --> 01:16:56,920
They all want it. So yeah. So it is it is cool like it's whether you know any of the lore or not it is a cool reveal because you really can't see it coming. Yeah. It's hard unless you really are craning your neck around. Yeah. You cannot see it coming. And also you're in front of this now much newer looking robot that has a very cool effect. And I would I would be interested. I haven't pulled somebody who doesn't know anything about it but I would imagine you would that would be one of the memorable parts of the ride if it was your first time going on it.

916
01:16:56,920 --> 01:17:13,840
Go like oh that was a cool ghost with the head. Probably. Now also digital newer. Last year my complaints were about the attic feeling too digital and current and I don't have those complaints about this. It's kind of like the the matter on redo or there's something about they just didn't.

917
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:34,120
It's like something about the like the dimness and the lighting and maybe I'm just influenced by listening to this guy Ray Spencer because another thing he said was they they were like we need to make the him special because he is special but not so special that he distracts like it is not like an aura of heavenly light on this character.

918
01:17:34,120 --> 01:17:58,560
And that goes because that would be out of place. It is I think the dimness it's it like you don't feel the digital nature of it so much because it's done in this realistic moody fashion. I know it's not the same thing but it almost in the same way that like I feel like if they had made the Harry Potter queue with the paintings coming to life 10 years earlier those would have looked like screens.

919
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:26,040
Yeah like there's a perfect those absolute they look awesome and they still look great. Those those paintings come to life. If you look at them and they're static you think it's a painting like I was on it not long ago and it's like it looks great. Yeah. And like the same thing with this it's like within just a couple of years stuff like this can make the difference for how good the technology is and how timeless then it can feel because like the bride is dated. It's digital.

920
01:18:26,040 --> 01:18:42,960
Hmm. What would you kind of feels 90s and it feels very 90s and I don't I feel like this thing could last for maybe the technology would get so good it would feel dated but this thing feels like it could last for 50 years and it wouldn't be you wouldn't go oh I know when that era what era that was made in. Yeah.

921
01:18:42,960 --> 01:19:11,080
I mean I think you bring up a good point about the moodiness. He there is not a lot of I mean Leota talks she kind of has her own soundtrack and sound effects and such. But the hat box goes he's kind of like sinister sinisterly laughing at you and there's that like poof sound effect kind of when the hat the head for the transition between the hat box and that and the head.

922
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:31,280
Yeah. And it feels like copacetic with everything around it. It feels of the piece. Yes. Because you can by that point you can probably hear you know just you can hear a little bit of what's going on in the attic and a little bit of the graveyard that's coming up. So all these things just need to be ambient and fit next to each other and not be so overwhelming about other elements.

923
01:19:31,280 --> 01:19:52,000
The other thing is you're looking at him for a while long enough like as you tilt towards him and then when you go backwards you're kind of guaranteed at least one disappearing reappearing. Oh yeah. They time it so you get. Yeah absolutely. And if it stops or if it slows down you could see it happen a couple of times. You know.

924
01:19:52,000 --> 01:20:21,160
Yeah. Yeah. When you get stuck in front of him. Oh what a dream. The best spot. Yes. Yeah. That's where that's where you want to be. Never. I always kind of like when that ride gets stuck kind of wherever you are. There's no part where I like bummed or anything to like go this boring. Like I kind of look forward to the and I like the little playful spooks. I bet it's part of it to me. Yes. And it's not like getting stuck on Harry Potter where I start to get a little nervous. Sure. Yes.

925
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:38,000
I go we can be up here for a while. Yeah. Depending on where you are. That's that's happened a few times. I got stuck in front of one of those mentors. No thank you. Spooky. How many stories. How many stories up are you at that point. A couple. Yeah. Yeah.

926
01:20:38,000 --> 01:21:07,920
At least two. Yeah. So if you get it if you're stuck in front of it for a while you maybe get a chance to stare at it and try to figure out how does this effect work. As we said Yale Gracie could not figure it out in just in a way just with lighting. I forget how much we said it was like essentially the idea. It's it's scrims. It's it was going to be some version of that. It's like the carousel of progress is an example where it seems like a wall but then the lighting changes or it's it's you know.

927
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:38,000
Transparent somewhat. And when you when you put a light in there now what seems like a hard surface was actually just partially transparent. You could look through it. It was something like that. Yeah. Yeah. They use it everywhere on stuff. They used it a couple of years ago at nots paranormal activity maze like where I'd be walking down a normal well lit hallway and then scrims they change the lighting on it and like it was hell. There were tons of characters. Yeah. Yeah. And you were like it was like such a great effect that still works. Right. It went from like a wall to like a wall.

928
01:21:38,000 --> 01:22:08,000
From a boring hospital hallway to see the depths of hell. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Really cool. It's cool that you know grazing might be behind the use of that anywhere in theme but you might as far as I know you might be the first. So that was the idea was going to be a mini version of that. But it's so lighting dependent doesn't quite work. That's not really what it is today. Do you guys know how they do it. This is not there's not even really like debunkers or people really trying to say I figured out the hat box. Did you. Does it say in the interview because I did not

929
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:38,000
listen to this interview. No. And I don't think they like make up. I don't think they're dying for it to be said and figured out. I have theories based on my idiot brain. I have. Well and then what I have is like somebody's guess on Reddit. OK. Which take that with a grain of salt. But it might be. So I maybe have a solution if you don't want to know. Skip ahead. But Mike. Well I think it's all like sort of like L.E.D. based where like it

930
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:54,000
can like things can like literally like a screen can turn on and off. And the way that they've done it and I am not smart enough to know almost in the same way like Harry Potter where like something on the figure itself just looks better than like it masks that it's a screen.

931
01:22:54,000 --> 01:23:07,000
It can turn on and off. This is my dumb opinion. I think it's something like that. Yeah. But then it's also like you are you have to really stare at it to register. Oh now there's nothing. Right. It doesn't look like anything.

932
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:16,000
That's why that's why I think it has to be turned on and off a bowl because you really I've looked you can't see it in the hat box when it's not there.

933
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:31,000
Well I think I think I watched the B roll of them like you know where they do that. They take footage of people programming it you know and they're narrating over it in that short video about the hotbox ghost being back.

934
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:48,000
And I think what my guess was from what I could figure out from this video the the head on the body that is a practical head. But it's like very basic and the head is the fate it's projected on it.

935
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:57,000
And then there's is there nothing in the hotbox. Is there just a screen in there. I think that's right. Yeah. Yeah. Because the other thing yeah the face obviously is blinking.

936
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:14,000
There's not that's not a robot blinking. We know that there's a projection of some kind or it's some sort of screen in it. So it has to be either or I think so you're saying you think Jason that there's some sort of like maybe black featureless head shaped item.

937
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:20,000
Well no it's white like imagine movie screen wrapped around like a mannequin face like your white movie screen.

938
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:35,000
So good to be a projection. That's the only reason why I'm like is it some like screen inside him that I'm not. But maybe yeah maybe projection is just can be so precise now that I never like sort of because I know other projection things you can kind of see a little.

939
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:46,000
Yeah. Once in a while it's kind of weird. Here's and skip ahead listener if you just want this to be magical and not here and this could be totally wrong because again I found it on Reddit but it makes sense to me.

940
01:24:46,000 --> 01:25:07,000
Yeah. Thinking it through. I think Jason you're correct that there is nothing in the box and that that's maybe a subtle 45 degree pepper's ghost sort of like there is a little projector in the at the top of the box that's shooting this image of a face down at a weird angle that then conforms correctly to a weirdly angled screen.

941
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:19,000
The the head on the body. I this somebody believes I'll just read what they wrote and the use I forget the user it had the word wookie in it. Okay great. That's not full credit but it's something.

942
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:37,000
There's a thin piece of opaque material that gets pulled into his chest. So interesting. There's so it's a really it's a very light screen that like furls and unfurls and gets sucked back and then put back like back and forth.

943
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:52,000
Wow. It doesn't not make sense to me and that so it's saying it is a projection but it's just that the the screen pulls down and up. Yes when like arrives right on time like to the millisecond.

944
01:25:52,000 --> 01:26:08,000
How interesting or the face to appear on it. So yeah. So yeah. Okay. So the way to project something would it have it would have to be a white screen because it wouldn't project on the face is gone and white but maybe it's more like it's it's a really neutral gray like a darker.

945
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:14,000
Right. So yeah that would have to be down obviously when it looks like he just has black.

946
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:25,000
There's a shadow like an empty space where his head was that's the effect. I think it's like it's a screen getting yanked. That's crazy. It feels like a cousin to me of that really cool effect in Tower of Terror Tokyo. Yes.

947
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:39,000
I was thinking when appearing and disappear where like you cannot be off by half a second. That was also shocking to learn how that was done because there's something that like disappears and I thought for sure it was some sort of projection trick but it literally shoots down into the ground.

948
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:53,000
Yeah. Yeah. Like just fat. It's like a fast thing. You can't gravity. Yeah. Fast. You can't see. So interesting. Regardless of what's happening. Even if this user is wrong about that. I think they're dead on about this.

949
01:26:53,000 --> 01:27:09,000
The next part which is the subtle blue light that represents his head moving from his neck down his body is meant to draw your eye away from the rapidly disappearing screen for the projection and this interview with the with the imaginary I heard another piece of like something on YouTube.

950
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:14,000
They seem to be hinting at this that like it's happening right before your eyes and that it's distraction.

951
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:28,000
It's like a prestige. It's a magic trick. So if you're following his his soul or his essence which you're going to say that looks cool. This whatever like magical ambient light is moving. Look at that is the stress.

952
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:34,000
So if you go on it if you and you want to crack it you might just want to stare right at that head and don't look away.

953
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:50,000
Wow. I mean that is what I was trying to do when he first when I first wrote it in like 2015 but the theme marketing did work of like the hotbox goes back because the lines for Haunted Mansion massive to see this.

954
01:27:50,000 --> 01:28:01,000
Yeah. Yeah. You trying to crack it. I'm looking at it now. Yeah. And I'm trying to see if I can see the top. You know what the lighting is on its side even for like watching a video of it because can't.

955
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:14,000
Yeah. It being in this dim spot and it's dim like even if I bet with all the lights on you go. Oh got it. But yeah I guess I'm wrong. I guess it probably is still a projection and there's not a screen in it but I can't really.

956
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:24,000
I guess there is sort of some movement on the head when it transfers. So yeah maybe. Yeah. It's still hard to tell even if you're staring at the head but it obviously is a video.

957
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:39,000
So maybe maybe you can tell more but it's a really great effect regardless. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's so cool. The fact that we don't really know and they have not really Lee and the people are not even dying to like catch them and like I know what they did.

958
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:52,000
It's really cool. And I'm not even sure but that seems like a start and amazing. They really pull off. It is one of the I think it is one of the neatest things you can see in Disneyland at this point within the rights just.

959
01:28:52,000 --> 01:29:13,000
Yeah. It's really cool. It's really cool. And I've said I think I said this on one of the mansions or maybe everyone I'm not sure is that if they ever again this is never going to happen now because of the way decisions are made but I would love to see an overhaul of almost all the ghosts in this style because it still looks kind of old school to me but also it's so much more clear.

960
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:33,000
It still maintains this sort of spooky nature of the ghost but it's a lot easier to see and a lot easier to see the effects. So if you put the graveyard full of at least a few more prominent ghosts because I've said this before it's like the graveyard is awesome but I wish that if they would apply the new technology to some of the ghosts and really like spruce things up overall in the mansion.

961
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:47,000
Yeah. Maybe like spots here and there. I don't know if it needs to be addressed but there's some that are just kind of hazy. Yeah and I know like it's fun to kind of go like like squint and go oh I think this person doing this but like some of the some of the more marketable ghosts.

962
01:29:47,000 --> 01:30:10,000
Victor Geist's your Constance Hatchaways you know. Yeah. Who what's the chandelier ghost. Pickwick. Pickwick. Thank you. Pickwick deserves an upgrade is what I'm saying. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So well there are you know that look there's upgrades come into mansions here and there.

963
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:26,000
I'm not happy about it. Yes. Well we talked about this when we talked about D23 news the Hatchbox ghost is coming to Disney World and Mike took the hard stance. Oh you don't want it. Not. They don't. They should. Not an unpopular opinion.

964
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:42,000
You think so. That's what I've been reading. I mean at least in our audience I don't think at the very least it's 50 50 if not more in tilted in favor of this opinion. It is kind of just like we put a seven year old animatronic we put a seven year old edition into the

965
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:58,000
Florida one which that that that is one of the best pieces of news they had. Right. That is a real sign of the times. We're putting an old thing in a place. Yes. And really done because of the movie I think they're presenting it as a thing. Oh look the Disney history finally coming to Florida.

966
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:27,000
But really it's like we're hoping this on a mansion movies a big franchise Jared Leto big star big character. He's the Hatchbox ghost. Let's get him in there because people are going to want to see that character once they see this movie. That's my cynical take is that they're presenting it as something for the fans when in fact they're like we got to have this with the movie before the movies out or who knows when they're going to put it in. So but you're you don't want you're not wanting to just like leave an empty space. Your argument is also I want to leave a seat at the table.

967
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:56,000
I want to see the table for the ghost but I don't want him sitting there. You want you're you're thinking you want them to get something that they don't they get their own version. Yes. I think that's more fun. I think that the lore of new character Disneyland Hatchbox ghost is fun. And I think it's I like that again we I think mostly in agreement that we like it being there's stuff that's unique to the parks on both coasts. Yeah. And I feel like this is what's more specific to do.

968
01:31:56,000 --> 01:32:25,000
Disneyland and the legend of this character. Sure sure. So it feels to me like you know they're putting a hat box ghost over there. So you want the Florida Hatchbox ghost to have like a patchy beard and long greasy hair. You want the full 30 seconds to Mars. Look. Well now. Okay. Okay. You're making a little joke I think but I actually would. I am making a little joke. I think I would be more in favor of them modeling it after Jared Leto. No. Because it will be different. No. What?

969
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:55,000
That logic makes sense. But what. Come on. Because then it's different. If that just happened you would hate it. If it happened here. If it had like. We don't know what it looks like. If it wasn't this back and forth already established. I'm just saying I'm if you if there were two buttons one button is put the old the same thing that from Disneyland and what put the Leto one in. I'm putting the Leto one in every time in Florida. And I would do it without it with a clear conscience. Just with taking your daughter for the first time and going like and that's that's the answer.

970
01:32:55,000 --> 01:33:25,000
That's not Dr. Michael Morpheus. Right. This is not a clear. This is not the fail son from House of Gucci. That's right. No. That's not a Gucci. Is it. It's wild that performance. It is. I like the performance. The movies should have been more nuts. That's my only complaint. Every character should have been like. My complaint is like everybody still do the voices they're doing and make the movie a full on comedy and I'm there. But it's not it's not as crazy as the

971
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:55,000
performances would suggest. Yeah. I you know it's as you say this that you would willingly give Florida the the letter letter. I would I'll tell you why this occurred to me. Well I mean I'll just say my my thought I was thinking about Leto stuff and I was thinking about 30 seconds to Mars and I was like you know if there wasn't Leto baggage and if and how about this if you had grown up with it I think you would love 30 seconds to Mars. That's an interesting thing. And when you say grown up.

972
01:33:55,000 --> 01:34:12,000
How old if it had come out in the late 90s where you were all that shit you revere heard it then I disagree with that I think because I was OK. Believe it or not a couple of weeks ago I was listening to some of the sequel single excuse me singles of 30 seconds to Mars to refresh myself.

973
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:32,000
OK. This was I was on a run sometimes I'm all this is going to seem like I'm I'm complaining I'm allowed control of the YouTube once in a while when things are going on when things people are like wanting to focus on the TV. People were over Lindsay's family was over and like people are cleaning up or somebody's in the kitchen and whatever.

974
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:55,000
I'm I can then wield the YouTube. Hang on. What in the world you're so when everyone's distracted and chores are being done. Well I'm you get from all right Mike gets. I'm not trying to act like I'm I'm being persecuted or something. I'm just saying once in a while when like stuff is sort of going on and people don't want to watch a movie. Let Mike control the YouTube and it can be whatever we want.

975
01:34:55,000 --> 01:35:25,000
Well mom is putting stuff in the garbage. Mike gets the YouTube. It's yes and I understand it because people like to watch TV they like to watch a specific thing. People don't necessarily like to go down YouTube rabbit holes like maybe we do. Maybe the three of us are now look I'm entirely YouTube rabbit hole. Yeah that's my favorite show. My favorite show is YouTube rabbit holes. Of course yes. And look you know I'm sure there'd be things you would see in my history and go you watched that. The one that I always think about is that YouTube

976
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:54,960
provided as the entertainment for Lindsay and her mom multiple versions of Sammy Davis Jr. singing Mr. Bojangles. Mr. Bojangles. I've thought about that ever since. Yeah I'm like how did multiple you finished one and then you were like no you should probably see this one from three years prior. I want to actually legitimately I want to hear exactly how that played out. God I don't even really remember exactly how it played out. I will go back there. I'm trying to think. You must. I have to know. I'm trying to think is like I'm sure we were watching some sometimes I

977
01:35:54,960 --> 01:36:24,960
like. OK here's here's my strategy sometimes with when I'm YouTube rabbit holeing with a bunch of other people is I will try to at least get adjacent to some other people's interests. Very much like sometimes sometimes. Lindsay likes old standard. She likes the old crooner. She likes the old time music. She likes newer music as well. So she doesn't like so much like the 70 year old man in a dingy basement complaining about the woke belief. No she does not like that. Whatever you're

978
01:36:24,960 --> 01:36:50,400
talking about she doesn't like it. No she likes those soundscapes that I like where it's like a Halloween party going on downstairs oldies playing from another room. You do. No I put that on if I'm like you know working on something or cleaning or stuff. It's like there's a whole YouTube channel of it and it's just like a still image and it's just playing like audio.

979
01:36:50,400 --> 01:37:08,120
Mm hmm. So I believe this happened because I started putting on some old like old old crooner types and then we got into Sammy Davis and I was like you know what I actually don't know a lot of like what was the song. What were Sammy Davis song you know Sinatra's you know a little bit of Dean.

980
01:37:08,120 --> 01:37:25,080
This was discovery. This was not like yeah I know the 76 Mr. Bojangles is the best Mr. Bojangles. Right. This was a little bit more discovery and like Sammy Davis did the Candyman and he did Mr. Bojangles which is a 70 song and I forget the band that did it.

981
01:37:25,080 --> 01:37:44,080
It's not like an old standard but he like did it in a sort of an old style and I think he did it every show from that point on. So I was on a Sammy Davis kick at that point and I don't remember exactly why I ended up with multiple Mr. Bojangles performances.

982
01:37:44,080 --> 01:37:58,080
You know it actually helps me to learn what I found that you were you were trying to learn about it. I found it so strange that you were like you had you've done one and then you got to do two more. It's really like sat in my head like a rock for years.

983
01:37:59,080 --> 01:38:10,080
I don't know there could have been something more strange at play. I'm not ruling that out. Will you for the listeners rank. You don't have to do it now but at least on Twitter for anyone who's interested rank the Mr. Bojangles performances.

984
01:38:10,080 --> 01:38:30,080
You know what a song I like there's a song that Sammy Davis does and Bobby Sherman. They both called Sweet Gingerbread Man which I really I'm a big fan of both versions of it. One of the credits and one of the Hawkeye Disney Plus's they have Sammy Davis I think singing Sweet Gingerbread Man.

985
01:38:30,080 --> 01:38:45,080
Wow. One of the one of the that's an oddly relevant right. It takes place at Christmas. Yes. It's like fresh shot of the pan sweet gingerbread man. It's a very cheesy song but I like it a lot. It's nice. It is nice.

986
01:38:45,080 --> 01:39:11,080
Can I tell you why I thought 30 seconds to Mars. Yeah go ahead. Because their most recent album is called America. I'm like that's like fucking all your like American American Wasteland. American. OK so here's my argument for why I don't think I would have been because 30 seconds I was listening to the singles and I was like oh this song. Yeah this is an unpleasant song like I don't know what it's like.

987
01:39:11,080 --> 01:39:29,080
It's like very moody versus like something like My Chemical Romance which was the Black Parade. You know do you like any of that. No I'm talking about. No you don't know I'm talking about. I know a little. There's like a very like inspired by American Idiot album I think. And you're asking me if I know.

988
01:39:29,080 --> 01:39:58,080
Well I don't maybe it's possible. You avoided it like the play. So this was more when I was older when I was 20 early 20s mid 20s and there I like I like those My Chemical Romance songs pretty good. OK. And I was going back through all of this stuff and go yeah what were 30 seconds to Mars songs and I was going through a couple of them like oh this is unpleasant. These songs are unpleasant. OK. And don't even have like a fun upbeat sort of pop punk thing. It's a little more screamo kind of thing.

989
01:39:59,080 --> 01:40:18,080
You know very like kind of labored and like more intense and not as much fun. So I don't think so. That's a good question. You know what I say that not really knowing what the music's like at all. I'm not as big into like that screamo emo stuff from around that point and especially the singles which I still don't like.

990
01:40:18,080 --> 01:40:34,080
I don't. Seems like not fun. They were on Conan one time when I worked there and I was like this is the worst performance I've ever. It's like they were like they were like six guys with giant drums who like with different color face paint swiped on. And it was one of those like oh Oh Oh oh oh oh.

991
01:40:35,080 --> 01:40:47,080
One of those fucking chants that would leave you for like 15 years. I think maybe we're finally a little bit out of chance. Oh yeah. The Tejo. I was truly watching it on the monitors like oh people like the five we can play five to ten seconds of this.

992
01:40:47,080 --> 01:40:55,960
this I think right before Jared Leto sues us. It's like really like no fun.

993
01:41:01,560 --> 01:41:05,480
It's just really yeah there's just it's sort of I remember being on the radio and never

994
01:41:06,200 --> 01:41:11,000
getting into it like you know an all-american rejects where I'd be like well this is a pretty

995
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:17,240
fun pop punk the ataris and anything where I would casually like it. I wasn't a big fan of either

996
01:41:17,240 --> 01:41:21,160
those bands. You want some melody. What's a melody and I want a little the upbeatness and.

997
01:41:21,960 --> 01:41:26,760
Well here to not stay in tangent land for too long you know this is all being said because of

998
01:41:26,760 --> 01:41:31,560
Jared Leto. Well ultimately the character we're talking about this year will be portrayed on

999
01:41:31,560 --> 01:41:36,760
screen by next year we will know. We will know what it was we will know how it went. Yeah. What are our

1000
01:41:36,760 --> 01:41:41,640
fears. I'm going to say fears. What do we think this movie is going to be like this this finally

1001
01:41:41,640 --> 01:41:49,640
we get boy. That's a good question. I don't I don't really know. I'm not sure. I'm more my concern is

1002
01:41:49,640 --> 01:41:57,160
that it's not going to be like as scary and moody as I would want it and that's not really a few.

1003
01:41:57,160 --> 01:42:03,560
A little concerning because it's very comedy stacked. Yeah. Owen Wilson Tiffany Haddish. I

1004
01:42:03,560 --> 01:42:09,720
mean I like this is a good cat. Look yeah I know I that is nothing but a tone wise. I'm thinking

1005
01:42:09,720 --> 01:42:15,000
they're going to lean more toward the graveyard and less toward the hallway if you know what I mean.

1006
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:20,200
Tone wise I'm a little concerned they're going to burn off a lot of time like the Eddie Murphy one

1007
01:42:20,200 --> 01:42:26,360
did where it's like well I'm a real estate dad and I'm not around a lot because I got to sell these

1008
01:42:26,360 --> 01:42:31,720
houses but we're moving into one of that because this one already they're like OK the premise is

1009
01:42:31,720 --> 01:42:37,080
it's a single mother and her child. OK. And they move into this. It's like I don't I do not care.

1010
01:42:37,080 --> 01:42:42,360
Just show me this. I want to monster. I want a ghost party. Well look even the Muppets had to

1011
01:42:42,360 --> 01:42:49,240
reckon with how why are you in a haunted mansion. Yeah. This question has to be sure. That's true.

1012
01:42:49,240 --> 01:42:56,200
So yeah I would say that my my concern is like it we're still leaning we're going to lean toward

1013
01:42:56,200 --> 01:43:02,040
like family friendly not that it shouldn't be family friendly but it's going to be less like

1014
01:43:02,040 --> 01:43:07,240
atmospheric and there's going to be less of a tone like a cool creepy tone and mood possibly.

1015
01:43:07,240 --> 01:43:13,240
Well especially given that as was said earlier Guillermo del Toro was maybe was like for sure

1016
01:43:13,240 --> 01:43:18,200
was deep into development of it and who knows what happened or why that one didn't work out.

1017
01:43:18,200 --> 01:43:23,800
But I know that people were pained to discover that Jared Leto comes with a lot of

1018
01:43:23,800 --> 01:43:29,160
bad and maybe like there's been highly anticipated characters he's played before

1019
01:43:29,160 --> 01:43:35,560
where then what he did was kind of annoying or nothing. Michael Michael Michael Michael.

1020
01:43:35,560 --> 01:43:43,480
We all had so many hopes for what Morbius was going to be. But the like well so you know what

1021
01:43:43,480 --> 01:43:48,600
I had not put together is that this isn't so surprising but Doug Jones not our friend

1022
01:43:48,600 --> 01:43:53,160
Jones but actor Doug Jones was going to be Hapox. So I think that's a good point.

1023
01:43:53,160 --> 01:44:00,040
Hapox ghost in that version and everybody loves him as a creature in character. That's the next

1024
01:44:00,040 --> 01:44:08,120
out of the park anytime from from Mack tonight on. And so that that does feel like oh boy they go

1025
01:44:08,120 --> 01:44:18,600
from like culty always cool to uh to like a guy who runs a cult. Well who is a cult leader.

1026
01:44:18,600 --> 01:44:27,240
Uh huh. That's true. All that stuff is true. And if that is all the cult stuff aside you know I do

1027
01:44:27,240 --> 01:44:36,280
think I like his Mario voice in House of Gucci. I think there's a realm Mario voice. He's a very

1028
01:44:36,280 --> 01:44:41,560
nice guy in House of Gucci. I didn't know that. OK. He's you should at least watch some scenes from

1029
01:44:41,560 --> 01:44:45,080
House of Gucci. I think you'll know what I'm saying where you're like man this is right on the edge

1030
01:44:45,080 --> 01:44:50,360
of being something like I'd like to watch. I you know I like them in We Crash the show we've

1031
01:44:50,360 --> 01:44:55,960
worked on. Sure. I yeah I thought he was a lot of fun in that. But yeah it feels like I don't know.

1032
01:44:56,840 --> 01:45:02,680
Also I want to say I have mixed feelings about both of these people but like a road trip comedy

1033
01:45:02,680 --> 01:45:10,920
that pairs up Jared Leto's Adam Newman and James Franco's Tommy Wiseau. I just want to put let's

1034
01:45:10,920 --> 01:45:16,760
like merge together. Sure. Let's write a fictional adventure. Right. People can play them as long as

1035
01:45:16,760 --> 01:45:23,800
they play them exactly like those ambiguously foreign and strange positive oddballs you know.

1036
01:45:23,800 --> 01:45:31,160
They can pick up Joseph Gordon Levitt's Travis Kalnick because that is the Uber guy. The very

1037
01:45:31,160 --> 01:45:37,720
aggressive Uber guy. You would put him over Don John. Huh. In there. Oh yeah. If I could only put

1038
01:45:37,720 --> 01:45:45,160
one or Jiminy. If you can only put one Joe Galev on the boat. Yeah. I'm going Don John. Look you're

1039
01:45:45,160 --> 01:45:49,480
neither you are wrong. I was just trying to keep it in the realm of tech guy. I see I see you're

1040
01:45:49,480 --> 01:45:54,440
right. You're right. Well the only thing Wiseau already isn't and you know who you might want to

1041
01:45:54,440 --> 01:46:01,560
put in there is like an artist like the tightrope walker because he's like you know like let me show

1042
01:46:01,560 --> 01:46:09,240
you a world of fantasy. That's like a duel then like to sketch comedy characters. Leto and Levitt's

1043
01:46:10,680 --> 01:46:17,480
accent characters thrown together. I think one thing I if I was making a Haunted Mansion movie

1044
01:46:17,480 --> 01:46:23,640
this seems like an easy go to that I think no filmmaker would consider is trying to mirror

1045
01:46:24,200 --> 01:46:29,240
in the arc of the movie make the first half like the Claude Cote segments and then make the second

1046
01:46:29,240 --> 01:46:35,080
half of the movie like the Mark Davis segments. Sure yeah. Keep it dark and then make it silly and

1047
01:46:35,080 --> 01:46:41,960
yeah yeah. It seems like an interesting way to like get the tones the various tones of the ride

1048
01:46:41,960 --> 01:46:47,240
in there. Sure. But who knows if anyone's considering that you know. Yeah I think with

1049
01:46:48,520 --> 01:46:53,560
I think the answer with Leto you never know what you're gonna get so sure it's almost impossible

1050
01:46:53,560 --> 01:46:58,840
to tell. You might get a surprisingly fun performance or you might get a used condom in

1051
01:46:58,840 --> 01:47:03,400
the mail. I was gonna say for sure you're gonna use condom in the mail. That's for sure. He's gonna do

1052
01:47:04,200 --> 01:47:09,640
he's gonna have heads in a hat box. He's definitely handed out a bunch of hat box full of some kind of

1053
01:47:09,640 --> 01:47:16,360
animals heads to the cast. Oh yeah. I know that has happened. Yeah yeah yeah. Danny DeVito got a

1054
01:47:16,360 --> 01:47:22,920
fucking hat box with a head of a raccoon in it or something. Yeah that's so nice wow a hat box. Boy

1055
01:47:22,920 --> 01:47:30,360
Jared is a great guy but can't wait to work. Oh no. He's been he's made big strides in the actors

1056
01:47:30,360 --> 01:47:36,040
labor issues because now the animal heads and the use condoms that's been worked into the latest

1057
01:47:36,040 --> 01:47:42,120
sag contracts. The latest screen actor contracts. That you wait that you that you get them just for

1058
01:47:42,120 --> 01:47:47,160
participating. It's sort of like guaranteed now like you have to be paid to go do the pre-shoot

1059
01:47:47,160 --> 01:47:53,080
covid tests. Like you have to make sure you're getting you know something absurd in the mail.

1060
01:47:53,720 --> 01:47:58,680
It's gonna help with performance. Like you you're gonna give it a different bent if you're if

1061
01:47:58,680 --> 01:48:07,080
there's a real a dirty adult diaper sent to your home. A full diaper. Adult diaper. I forgot what

1062
01:48:07,080 --> 01:48:12,040
the things were. I was like what was this story again? And my I completely content wearing content

1063
01:48:12,040 --> 01:48:18,760
wearing. I completely went to used condoms. I forgot that right alongside this was anal beads.

1064
01:48:19,320 --> 01:48:26,280
Oh yeah. We sent people anal. Was this on Will Smith. On Suicide Squad. That's what this was I think.

1065
01:48:26,280 --> 01:48:30,920
Not Justice League. Because the Joker because something we know the Joker and something the

1066
01:48:30,920 --> 01:48:36,360
Joker would do would send anal beads in the mail. Yeah that's right. That's a good point. He would

1067
01:48:36,360 --> 01:48:46,120
serve as a just like a voluntary Spencer's Gifts sex toy employee. Right yes. He went into a

1068
01:48:46,120 --> 01:48:50,840
Spencer's and was like I know what I'll get. What are the most twisted items?

1069
01:48:54,200 --> 01:49:04,120
Yeah yeah. Culticide. His Joker is fine. I would say it was not worth the hassle. It was not worth

1070
01:49:04,120 --> 01:49:09,640
the anal beads. But it's fine. I mean I'm glad the anal bead industry was propped up for that

1071
01:49:09,640 --> 01:49:14,200
amount of time. I want to see the two Snyder movies. I want to see Justice League 2 and 3. I would

1072
01:49:14,200 --> 01:49:19,800
like them to make those. And 3 is the teased at the end of the first Justice League and is the desert

1073
01:49:19,800 --> 01:49:26,920
nightmare apocalypse. Yeah where Batman is in the big coat which is I think cool but makes no sense.

1074
01:49:26,920 --> 01:49:32,600
Batman's wearing a thick coat over his shirt over his Batman outfit. All right. And he's got goggles

1075
01:49:32,600 --> 01:49:36,360
on for some reason. Doesn't make any sense really I guess. He should just have goggles in his cowl.

1076
01:49:37,080 --> 01:49:41,960
But then maybe. Yeah but then Joker is there with him so they have to like sort of team up in this

1077
01:49:41,960 --> 01:49:46,520
in this future world. Sorry is this happening or is it. No there's still people are still

1078
01:49:46,520 --> 01:49:51,960
banging the drum on this. Which probably I guess won't happen but. It's the most unpleasant drum

1079
01:49:51,960 --> 01:49:58,760
sounds I've ever heard in my life. The Justice League movie is good though. The Snyder cut's good.

1080
01:49:58,760 --> 01:50:06,040
These all fall into like fell asleep before the ending for me. Suicide Squad, Justice League.

1081
01:50:06,040 --> 01:50:15,160
Well Suicide Squad. We have to cut this off. Suicide Squad the first movie is not good.

1082
01:50:15,160 --> 01:50:20,680
Yeah. OK sure. Yeah. Yeah. I don't doubt that someone who has any interest in any of it would

1083
01:50:20,680 --> 01:50:27,400
like the Snyder cut. I like Jason fell asleep very quickly but I do in any and all things. So

1084
01:50:27,400 --> 01:50:33,240
I've been a parent for a while now. As you've. Sure. The years have gone by with these podcasts.

1085
01:50:33,240 --> 01:50:37,320
No Baby when we started. There were no what? Childless Men when we started. Right. Two now.

1086
01:50:38,440 --> 01:50:44,920
And we're making our way out the window. The fall into the graveyard will begin soon. One bit of you

1087
01:50:44,920 --> 01:50:51,560
know what though Jared Leto this casting information gives us one crucial piece of information about

1088
01:50:51,560 --> 01:50:57,640
this character and maybe a good thing as we wrap up. The name. I don't think I knew the name and

1089
01:50:57,640 --> 01:51:02,520
maybe the name is purely an invention of the movie but it will become the name canonically

1090
01:51:02,520 --> 01:51:07,560
because there wasn't one before. The Hapbox Ghost. Do you guys know offhand? I'm looking through. I

1091
01:51:07,560 --> 01:51:12,280
have it here somewhere. Just you say it. I have it. The Hapbox Ghost's name is Alastair Crump.

1092
01:51:13,560 --> 01:51:18,520
Alastair Crump. I don't know if you want to say Alastair. Probably not. Alastair Crump.

1093
01:51:18,520 --> 01:51:23,960
Right. Crump presumably a reference to Raleigh Crump. An engineer. Which is confusing because

1094
01:51:23,960 --> 01:51:29,800
other things have called the Caretaker who is a character we'll meet soon next year. He's the

1095
01:51:29,800 --> 01:51:34,600
wobbly knee guy at the bottom of the hill. I don't think I realized that was the Caretaker.

1096
01:51:34,600 --> 01:51:39,640
He has been defined as being Silas Crump. So they're trying and I think the Haunted Mansion

1097
01:51:39,640 --> 01:51:45,080
movie the Eddie Murphy one had Master Gracie as a character and we've talked about Yale Gracie but

1098
01:51:45,080 --> 01:51:51,240
they're trying to get these guys names in wherever they can but a little confusing if there's already

1099
01:51:51,240 --> 01:51:56,600
a Crump unless they're tying it together. Unless the Caretaker is related to the Hapbox Ghost.

1100
01:51:56,600 --> 01:52:00,520
You know we should real quick because there's so many different versions of like yes the Hapbox

1101
01:52:00,520 --> 01:52:06,760
Ghost initially was the husband of the bride. Yes. Oh right. Because it's like and there's some

1102
01:52:06,760 --> 01:52:11,560
people that are like oh well he lost his head and the bride killed he's not the husband. She has the

1103
01:52:11,560 --> 01:52:16,760
head. But she was a victim of the bride and yes also maybe all of it because he has a lot of

1104
01:52:16,760 --> 01:52:23,240
hat boxes also. He's traveling with a lot of luggage. So it's like does he have other heads?

1105
01:52:24,040 --> 01:52:29,720
Is he maybe like the the sidekick of the bride in some way? He's been killed by the bride but also

1106
01:52:29,720 --> 01:52:33,560
now he's sort of teamed up with her and he's keeping all the heads of the headless people

1107
01:52:33,560 --> 01:52:39,160
that she's killed in these boxes. I would love kind of a characterization as like yes dear anything

1108
01:52:39,160 --> 01:52:44,280
you say dear. Exactly. Trailing behind her dropping the thing his head's falling off. So maybe that's

1109
01:52:44,280 --> 01:52:50,520
what it is and that's a fun idea. Huh. To to because because yeah there's different like comics

1110
01:52:50,520 --> 01:52:55,560
and things and everybody made up their own slight origin and again the Imagineers didn't put two

1111
01:52:56,680 --> 01:53:02,520
thoughts other than that looks cool put it in. Like we said all of pop culture today is adding

1112
01:53:02,520 --> 01:53:07,720
a bunch of shit to things that people did not think about in the 50s or 70s. Yeah. They thought

1113
01:53:07,720 --> 01:53:12,040
about their Minhatans and their martinis. Yep just like that was cool that's cool let's go to lunch

1114
01:53:12,040 --> 01:53:23,160
and get hammered. It hammered. Yeah. I one thing I didn't mention I was looking at the Jason Sorrell

1115
01:53:23,160 --> 01:53:32,040
book about the haunted mansion and the version I was looking at is an older printing 2004 2006.

1116
01:53:32,040 --> 01:53:36,120
So there's a lot about the Eddie Murphy movie in it and I was combing through the whole book trying

1117
01:53:36,120 --> 01:53:43,000
to find stuff on the half box goes and it gets one page and again this is 2004 let's say

1118
01:53:44,280 --> 01:53:50,760
and it just has the answer to the mystery like it's all there it just says like it's got the

1119
01:53:50,760 --> 01:53:57,240
Tony Baxter quotes he's the one who said like yeah you you would rotate you towards what is now the

1120
01:53:57,240 --> 01:54:04,680
harpsichord he says harpsichord that's where I came up. Oh god. Harpsichord from. Yeah. But he's like

1121
01:54:04,680 --> 01:54:09,960
yeah it didn't the effect didn't work because it was too much ambient light and you were too close

1122
01:54:09,960 --> 01:54:16,280
to it and it's pretty definitive in this book and this book is published by one of Disney's

1123
01:54:16,280 --> 01:54:21,400
publishing things and they bring Sorrell back to update it every few years I think the last time

1124
01:54:21,400 --> 01:54:30,280
was around 2015 2016. So I do want to get a hold of the newer one and see like oh have they expanded

1125
01:54:30,280 --> 01:54:38,040
it now. Yeah. Maybe no. Maybe not. Maybe no. Maybe they kept it a page as opposed to us who did two

1126
01:54:38,040 --> 01:54:44,520
hours this was a two hour about just the half box ghost and you know what we weren't wrong you weren't

1127
01:54:44,520 --> 01:54:51,000
wrong you were I never I don't think I ever said you could be wrong but I I you know this was the

1128
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:56,440
right thing to do I'm glad playful spooks interrupted our tour and we stopped here for a while and hung

1129
01:54:56,440 --> 01:55:04,040
out with Alistair Crump Alistair Crump the half box ghost who we will see. We'll have a lot more to

1130
01:55:04,040 --> 01:55:10,120
talk about in regards to this character the grand marshal of the black parade. No no don't say that

1131
01:55:10,120 --> 01:55:18,440
he's not the black parade. Gerard Way. Oh excuse me. DC Comics editor. Oh yes. DC Comics writer and

1132
01:55:18,440 --> 01:55:23,880
editor. The music superstar who parlayed that into a career writing comic books. Yeah hey good for him.

1133
01:55:23,880 --> 01:55:29,080
Good for him. You know they played they played the we are young festival yesterday wearing their

1134
01:55:29,080 --> 01:55:35,720
black parade outfits and old men masks. Oh I saw that yesterday. Maybe they were just afraid the

1135
01:55:35,720 --> 01:55:39,640
winds were gonna kick back up. I think they're aware of it being like a nostalgia festival and

1136
01:55:39,640 --> 01:55:45,720
they wanted to comment on it somehow. That's actually a solid bit. Sounds also unpleasant to

1137
01:55:45,720 --> 01:55:50,600
play music wearing a thick rubber mask. Yeah. Although I guess like slipknot. Up there playing

1138
01:55:50,600 --> 01:55:56,360
the black parade dress like Carl Havoc you know. Who's Carl Havoc? Oh from I think you should leave.

1139
01:55:56,360 --> 01:56:01,320
They quote all the make up. Oh yeah yeah yeah of course of course. Speaking of obscure names. Yeah wow.

1140
01:56:01,320 --> 01:56:05,640
These are our characters. Yeah you pulled that out real quick. Carl Havoc. I know what that is.

1141
01:56:07,720 --> 01:56:11,720
Well you know and now we reach any predictions about next year. One I have is that because

1142
01:56:11,720 --> 01:56:17,080
it was said once how many more times will Gerard Way and the black parade be mentioned

1143
01:56:17,080 --> 01:56:24,280
between now and next Halloween. I have my fears. Do you want to get how here rate on a scale of

1144
01:56:24,280 --> 01:56:31,480
one to ten skulls. How what do you think you will give the haunted mansion 2023.

1145
01:56:32,360 --> 01:56:37,560
Oh my liking of it. Yeah and then we'll say our actual scores. Oh my goodness that's a really.

1146
01:56:39,400 --> 01:56:46,360
Should I be optimistic right now? I'm not. Three point three and a half. I'm gonna say six and a

1147
01:56:46,360 --> 01:56:52,200
half. Okay I'm gonna be optimistic. Are you going out of ten? That's what he said. Ten. Oh okay I

1148
01:56:52,200 --> 01:56:57,320
was gonna say three and a half out of five. That's not bad. Yeah that's a pretty good deal. Uh uh

1149
01:56:57,880 --> 01:57:04,440
hmm out of ten. I'll go eight. I'll go optimistic. Wow that's very high. You might really like the

1150
01:57:04,440 --> 01:57:11,000
haunted mansion. I might really like the haunted mansion. I mean precedent is if we're going off

1151
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:17,880
most recent Jungle Cruise is not up there but like I have I have high hopes. I don't why. I can't

1152
01:57:17,880 --> 01:57:23,880
tell. Everything Disney makes is shit. I like Owen Wilson. I know it won't be a Pinocchio but.

1153
01:57:23,880 --> 01:57:29,800
I like Owen Wilson. It's kind of an oddball cast. You should say Danny DeVito. Danny DeVito should

1154
01:57:29,800 --> 01:57:36,040
play Pickwick. Maybe he is. Maybe he is. Oh man. Jamie Lee Curtis is Madame Leota. That's fun. I

1155
01:57:36,040 --> 01:57:42,760
mean that's great. She I feel like she's on a real run right now. Owen Wilson has had some fun stuff.

1156
01:57:42,760 --> 01:57:52,120
You're right. He's been fun. So I don't know. I'm going out on a limb. I recent movies I've not been

1157
01:57:52,120 --> 01:57:57,560
very fond of anything really. Yeah that's my biggest look. Even these little things are enticing but

1158
01:57:57,560 --> 01:58:05,080
remember it is a movie that the Disney company is releasing in the 2020s. And that is why I put a

1159
01:58:05,080 --> 01:58:11,240
three point five. It's not the heyday of live action like the million dollar million dollar duck days.

1160
01:58:12,120 --> 01:58:21,080
A brutal movie. Yeah. It's it's interesting. Jason though Jason I sometimes when you're your review

1161
01:58:21,080 --> 01:58:26,520
of a movie I feel like depends on just how your day had been. Because like sometimes you'll come

1162
01:58:26,520 --> 01:58:32,280
out hot with that Country Bear take and I was like are we watching the same movie. I was not having

1163
01:58:32,280 --> 01:58:36,440
good time during the country. I think you need to watch that when you're feeling better and you can

1164
01:58:36,440 --> 01:58:41,800
reassess it. I feel like I was in a pretty good mood when I went in. I just think that that still

1165
01:58:41,800 --> 01:58:45,720
to this day I'm still like what movie did he watch. The Country Bears is pretty good.

1166
01:58:46,440 --> 01:58:50,520
Well you need to get some real good little real good windfall something when something great

1167
01:58:50,520 --> 01:58:59,640
happens to you celebrate by rewatching. That's right. Is there a playlist of just two thousands

1168
01:58:59,640 --> 01:59:04,280
like going to bang out Brother Bear. We're going to bring out home on the range. Confessions of a

1169
01:59:04,280 --> 01:59:10,360
teenage drama queen. Confessions of I mean that's look that was never for me. Like I can't judge

1170
01:59:10,360 --> 01:59:14,520
that one too harshly. You never know certain ones you're like this is a movie I never cared about

1171
01:59:14,520 --> 01:59:18,840
and assumed was bad at the time and I've watched it now and it was better than any movie released

1172
01:59:18,840 --> 01:59:25,240
in the west. I mean that was during the pandemic we went back and watched a lot of like late 90s

1173
01:59:25,240 --> 01:59:33,320
mid 90s like high school movies. Oh yeah. And you realize how many like either journeymen directors

1174
01:59:33,320 --> 01:59:38,760
or writers or like really good sketch comedy ringers were writing and it's just like wow this

1175
01:59:38,760 --> 01:59:44,760
is pretty good. Someone solid was involved. Yeah. Well we will see that's maybe that's the big thing.

1176
01:59:44,760 --> 01:59:49,880
I can think of nothing bigger coming in the next calendar year than determining the quality of the

1177
01:59:49,880 --> 01:59:54,760
Haunted Mansion film. But Alistair Crump we'll see you soon. It was great to hang out with you for a

1183
02:00:21,400 --> 02:00:25,240
I have an idea. I want to real quick and we have to do this quickly because I don't want it to

1184
02:00:25,240 --> 02:00:30,840
linger in our minds too long. Yeah. Maybe Scott it's your job. I task you with it. You need to

1185
02:00:30,840 --> 02:00:35,880
give Jason and I an assignment for next year maybe even the following year very specific very detailed

1186
02:00:35,880 --> 02:00:39,960
of what we need to do when the episode starts and if we do not do it we will be punished in some way.

1187
02:00:39,960 --> 02:00:44,520
Oh. We need clothing we need to wear. Things we need to say at the top of the episode and if it

1188
02:00:44,520 --> 02:00:49,160
does not happen next year we get punished and so we get put in the penalty box perhaps. We drink

1189
02:00:49,160 --> 02:00:54,280
the year old Donald Duck orange juice that Andrew Gressom. I mean I don't know about that one but I

1190
02:00:54,280 --> 02:01:02,760
would say I don't know. Bring to me these items three. Yes. So so uh off the top of your head what

1191
02:01:02,760 --> 02:01:06,360
clothing do you want us to have to wear when this recording starts and what do you want us to start

1192
02:01:06,360 --> 02:01:13,240
the episode off with and if we don't do it uh the punishment will be let's see um we have to listen

1193
02:01:13,240 --> 02:01:19,240
and review solo on the Patreon full 30 seconds to Mars album. You will have to listen to the full

1194
02:01:19,240 --> 02:01:25,560
one and then solo record 60 minutes by yourself. This is your you're charting a guaranteed path

1195
02:01:25,560 --> 02:01:30,440
to where you end up at the end going 30 seconds Mars. Kind of like it. It's possible but I'm

1196
02:01:30,440 --> 02:01:34,520
gonna not. You're trying to invent a rationale to get where you want to get. I don't I'd rather

1197
02:01:34,520 --> 02:01:39,960
review other things and say you know what I like this um and also it's probably not a good thing

1198
02:01:39,960 --> 02:01:43,880
to be like Jared. That's pretty good actually. Did you know he actually is good. I like him a lot.

1199
02:01:44,520 --> 02:01:50,440
Yeah yeah right yes. So only worst things. But maybe on the Patreon I will say yeah I can say it but.

1200
02:01:50,440 --> 02:01:56,280
Uh um here's well here's this is where the stakes enter. All right please add to what I just said.

1201
02:01:56,280 --> 02:02:06,600
If the if the task is not completed. Yeah. With each one a a cluster of robots becomes eliminated

1202
02:02:06,600 --> 02:02:12,360
from discussion in the graveyard. Now here we go. We cannot even talk about it. Real stakes. Oh no.

1203
02:02:12,360 --> 02:02:16,680
No this is but these are stakes Jason. Yes because I know you're gonna want to talk about it. And we

1204
02:02:16,680 --> 02:02:21,480
by the way both have to do it. Yeah. We both have to remember next year to do this thing.

1205
02:02:22,280 --> 02:02:26,520
Um and it can be a couple things. It could be sure like like we have to wear blue in the honor

1206
02:02:26,520 --> 02:02:33,960
of Avatar. We have to wear. I think it needs to be complicated. Uh um okay. I think the wearing uh

1207
02:02:33,960 --> 02:02:39,000
blue and I'm not just saying that because uh half my wardrobe is the color blue. Uh all right now

1208
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:45,240
you know not to say blue. It won't be blue. That's not yeah yeah yeah. Um okay how about this. Yeah

1209
02:02:46,120 --> 02:02:52,760
it's it's two parts. It is a uh there's there's two reveals involved and I think I'm thinking

1210
02:02:52,760 --> 02:02:58,120
clothes because you sent me down that path. Okay. Uh this I'm giving you like go get these clothing

1211
02:02:58,120 --> 02:03:07,720
items like the dogs at the animal actors show. Um okay you you need to wear a hoodie like Jason

1212
02:03:07,720 --> 02:03:11,880
you're wearing now and that can be anything but at some point probably let's say right at the top.

1213
02:03:11,880 --> 02:03:17,880
You need to unzip it and and on your shirt whether that's written on your shirt itself or like a my

1214
02:03:17,880 --> 02:03:24,200
name is tag there needs to be written your favorite character from Avatar the way of water

1215
02:03:24,200 --> 02:03:33,160
in blue ink okay blue ink right right uh marker does matter that's it that's up to you. Yeah I'll

1216
02:03:33,160 --> 02:03:39,240
just make it like a ballot uh but but it has to be blue um and since we're talking about the hat box

1217
02:03:39,240 --> 02:03:49,720
ghost uh just bring a box of any kind and open it up and there should be a type of hat in it okay that

1218
02:03:49,720 --> 02:03:57,000
would be surprising maybe not that would provoke shrieks or that would break a young child's arm

1219
02:03:57,000 --> 02:04:00,920
okay but like you know because a filly's hat is not going to do it I know you might have a filly's

1220
02:04:00,920 --> 02:04:07,480
hat right um and uh unless you're so ashamed of how they do in the world series I mean just look

1221
02:04:07,480 --> 02:04:12,120
we're just proud they got there you know yeah it's a miracle I'm rooting for you as I said I'm on

1222
02:04:12,120 --> 02:04:19,800
your side due to Ted Cruz uh um so but yes like a where when it when the hat when the box opens

1223
02:04:20,520 --> 02:04:28,360
there is a hat where I'm like whoa okay yeah an unusual hat and uh the name of your favorite

1224
02:04:28,360 --> 02:04:32,440
avatar character in blue ink okay and this is when we start how you hit record on the podcast this

1225
02:04:32,440 --> 02:04:38,440
all happens yes welcome welcome to podcast the ride you do the whole intro and then you go and

1226
02:04:38,440 --> 02:04:43,480
here we go yeah yeah mm-hmm right and I'll say your names right and then you have a little

1227
02:04:43,480 --> 02:04:48,280
presentation to give all right okay fair enough and if not we loot we are not allowed to talk

1228
02:04:48,280 --> 02:04:56,920
about the hitchhiking ghosts oh my god instead of two high stakes that's pretty good good there also

1229
02:04:56,920 --> 02:05:01,160
though is the question of what even are we going to get to because I don't think we know now we're

1230
02:05:01,160 --> 02:05:05,240
back to we don't know the we don't the dividing markers we don't quite know where the haunted

1231
02:05:05,240 --> 02:05:10,040
mansion series goes so that's you know maybe we wouldn't even get to them anyway but still then

1232
02:05:10,040 --> 02:05:13,480
the next year we are not allowed to talk about you don't get to talk at all about the hitchhiking

1233
02:05:13,480 --> 02:05:20,840
ghosts that's pretty huge that's pretty okay well a big assignment then for next year listeners of

1234
02:05:20,840 --> 02:05:31,240
