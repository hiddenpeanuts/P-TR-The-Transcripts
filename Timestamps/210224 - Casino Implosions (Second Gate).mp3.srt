1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Three, two, fire one.

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
On Podcast The Ride, the Second Gate Casino Implosions!

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Exclamation point, this should be a dynamic episode,

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
a dynamite episode, if you will,

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
and we've got round the clock coverage

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
from going from all around the Valley Burbank area.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm Scott Gardner, and joined by,

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I mean, everybody's a sudden implosion expert, I think,

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
in preparation for this.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
So yeah, sure, implosion expert Mike Carlson.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Yes, I am here.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I'd also like to say I am an emotional implosion expert.

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Sometimes my self-confidence can just be destroyed

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
within a matter of moments.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
It depends, you know, I can def-

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I am self-defeating as well.

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
So I can analyze from a different,

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
a variety of ways is what I'm saying.

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
And potentially an expert in all the kinds of implosions

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
we're talking about and more, Jason Sheridan.

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Just keep tamping it down, like gunpowder

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
and explosive too, you know,

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
for a beautiful fireworks display.

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
That's right.

26
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
What an exciting episode today.

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I was saying before the show,

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
just a wonderful parade of scum bags

29
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,000
and beautiful human, human just, yeah, implosions,

30
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
explosions, fireworks, fireballs.

31
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
People who should be caught in implosion,

32
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
who like should be in the building as it is imploded,

33
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
if there was any justice.

34
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Yeah.

35
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
If you were, yes, if you were Judge Dredd,

36
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
you would say, you would sentence them

37
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
to be imploded in their own building.

38
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
In their own building,

39
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
if you were doing ironic sentencing, yeah.

40
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Yeah.

41
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
It's implosions, it's casino implosions mainly

42
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
is the way we're tying it together.

43
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
You know, buildings implode all the time.

44
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
This happens, this is a fact of life.

45
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
It's always impressive.

46
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
It's always a big show of the might of man.

47
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
So they're never not impressive,

48
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
but why do it on this theme park podcast?

49
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Well, I think mainly because in the 90s and 2000s,

50
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Las Vegas began this trend of imploding buildings,

51
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
not just quietly in the middle of the night,

52
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
but in a big, stupid theme parky way

53
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
with a huge spectacle and fireworks and lasers

54
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
and projections on buildings sometimes

55
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
and music and celebrities and actors

56
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
and maybe a movie being filmed is part of it.

57
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
It's just, I'm not even sure how many of these

58
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
there have been all told, but you know,

59
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
a handful, like at least 10 or so.

60
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
And some of the details and culture surrounding these things

61
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
are just so silly and so fun.

62
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
And it is such a like a satisfying story

63
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
line of like New Vegas, theme park Vegas,

64
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
killing old Vegas, killing mafia Vegas,

65
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
like in giant, giant explosions, like giant fireballs.

66
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
And then eventually in a sadder turn of events,

67
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
theme park Vegas just kind of collapses in on itself.

68
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
In slow motion, yes.

69
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
In not an exciting way.

70
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Yes, not in an exciting way at all

71
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
because none of these attractions,

72
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
which there is so many wonderful theme parky Vegas

73
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
sort of stuff, most of which isn't around anymore,

74
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
but they were not in it for the long haul.

75
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
They were not in it for like,

76
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
you have to give this 10 years to pick up some steam.

77
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
They were like, as soon as it opened,

78
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
some of that stuff was just like, oh, we're done with you.

79
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Yeah, there is a chance.

80
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I mean, we've talked about this on the show before.

81
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
They were going to build a replica, an accurate,

82
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Star Trek Starship Enterprise in Vegas as a hotel casino.

83
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
There's a chance they would have imploded it by now

84
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
that there would have been on TV and X enterprise exploding

85
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
because it was unprofitable.

86
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
If they made it either, okay, you could do it in universe

87
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
and like a Klingon ship blows it up

88
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,000
or just like a different pop culture IP entirely.

89
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I don't know, like the blue man group bangs a drum

90
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
and then the enterprise goes down.

91
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
They've blown up the enterprise a few times in the movies.

92
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
They're different enterprises.

93
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
They enterprise the original, then the enterprise A,

94
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
and it goes through whatever it is at this point.

95
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
But Kirk blows up the ship at the end of Star Trek III,

96
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
which he's battling, forgive me, I think Klingons.

97
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
So you could have William Shatner come back to the hotel

98
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
and just lazily run through the scenes

99
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
where he starts like the self-destruct on the ship.

100
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
And then like you see William Shatner have to like run away

101
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,000
from the hotel before it falls and collapses in on itself.

102
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
That sounds so cool.

103
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
If only Star Trek III live broadcast live on TV.

104
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Oh man.

105
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I mean, nothing that silly happened, I guess,

106
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
but there's some pretty silly stuff.

107
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Oh yeah.

108
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Actors involved, movies involved,

109
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
and maybe the thing to say at the top,

110
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
and we'll kind of culminate in this

111
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
and revisit this at the end,

112
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
but this is something that's been on our list of stuff

113
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
to talk about for a while,

114
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
but it's been made newly relevant because this very week,

115
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I think a week ago as this is coming out,

116
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:59,000
there was a big implosion of a Trump property in Atlantic City,

117
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Trump Plaza, which has been decaying for,

118
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I mean, since it was built basically,

119
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
but it's been completely unoccupied for I think five years

120
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
and was considered an eyesore and debris

121
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
was hurting people and businesses.

122
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
So they blew up a Trump building this week if you didn't see it.

123
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
And so we were like, okay,

124
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
we can't do implosions until that happens so we can,

125
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
you know, see what a 2021 implosion looks like.

126
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Yes.

127
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
And the answer is less good than others.

128
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
But surprisingly beautiful.

129
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Like very like, oh, a little elegant almost.

130
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Just like...

131
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Well, there is something interesting and, I don't know,

132
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
beautiful, artistic about a nice implosion.

133
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Yeah.

134
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
If we're really judging them aesthetically,

135
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
if we're really trying to judge, like put on our theme park hats

136
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
as far as what an experience is like and what it makes us feel,

137
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I do agree.

138
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I do agree.

139
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
There is, you could find something nice in any implosion.

140
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I will agree with you there.

141
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
It was also nice at the Sheridan household to like see Atlantic City

142
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
and the big, in the news, you know,

143
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
there are a lot of Sheridan ties back to the city.

144
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
And just growing up,

145
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
growing up, spending time down the shore,

146
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
having relatives like right outside the city.

147
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,000
As a young boy, I ended up with a lot of detritus from these casinos.

148
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Like the big cups, if you remember slot machines

149
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
when they used to spit out tokens, there'd be big plastic cups everywhere.

150
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Oh, right.

151
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
And those were fun, free marketing if you just took them out with you.

152
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
But at the beach, they were great for building sandcastles.

153
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
So I feel like I had those,

154
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I had a lot of dirty, like one cent slot machine tokens.

155
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
And then we always had like dead decks of cards.

156
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
If you know a dead deck or a canceled deck,

157
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
it has a hole punched in the middle of it.

158
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
If you've ever seen that.

159
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Casinos usually give those away or sell them for free in the gift shop

160
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
or give them away for free.

161
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Right. So do you think maybe,

162
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
obviously it didn't happen here,

163
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
but do you think because like if any of these implosions happen in the future

164
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
around where you grew up,

165
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:14,000
you should be the one to push down on that TNT box on the classic Wile E. Coyote implosion?

166
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Like that would be an honor to do,

167
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
but also it feels like, you know,

168
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
it's a personal relationship you have with these places.

169
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Well, sure. And that we'll get to that because there is a Trump Plaza specific

170
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:31,000
about pushing the button that was like very exciting and then kind of,

171
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
you know, kind of not as exciting.

172
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Brought into realistic terms.

173
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Yeah.

174
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I don't want to get us completely off tangent here,

175
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:45,000
but if there is a building that you guys feel you are the most like,

176
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
what's the building in your life you feel like you have the most ownership over

177
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
that you feel like it would be best if I was the one to blow it up?

178
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
That's a tough question because I would hate,

179
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
it would have to be like there is no other choice but to blow this up.

180
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
And that's the scenario. That's the hypothetical, I think.

181
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Because I flash to two, the Burbank Holiday Inn,

182
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
which could be a candidate for all of this potentially.

183
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
And then the Weston Bonaventure,

184
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
which I'm looking at a mug of,

185
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
which is the like future pod hotel in downtown LA.

186
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,000
But geez, I would feel it would wreck me legitimately to see it come down.

187
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I don't know if I could.

188
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
It's almost like it has to be one that's more of a novelty, right?

189
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Like, yeah, it's fine.

190
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I don't know if I could blow up a building I love.

191
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Interesting.

192
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I mean, I think I consider it's like sort of an oldie-eller situation,

193
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
you know, where you would, it should be you to do it.

194
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I would say, and they didn't actually blow this building up,

195
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
but the Toys R Us on Gulf Road in Chambers, Illinois,

196
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I do believe if they were going to implode it,

197
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I should be the one to hit the TNT box.

198
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
If they do, I mean, it's been replaced at this point,

199
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
so it's not going to happen, but I'll blow up whatever's there.

200
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Yeah.

201
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I'm willing to do it.

202
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Jason, do you have one?

203
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Well, I think it already got blown up

204
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
and was supposed to be blown up in a grander fashion,

205
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
but I was going to say the Granite Run Mall in Media, Pennsylvania,

206
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
which was my childhood mall,

207
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
and slowly, you know, as malls started to fall on tough times,

208
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
a lot of the stores closed,

209
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:23,000
and it is still like there's a plan to build a more Americana thing.

210
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I think they kept a couple of the department stores,

211
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
and then in between they sort of built up a more shopping center,

212
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,000
put a Chipotle or a World Home Goods or a World Market sort of thing,

213
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,000
but it does not look like the classic indoor fountain mall anymore,

214
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:46,000
but that was supposed to be blown up by one Mr. Kevin Smith in his mall.

215
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Oh, interesting.

216
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Mall Rats sequel slash thing,

217
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
and then the Exton Mall, which is still an operating mall in Pennsylvania,

218
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
was where they were going to shoot.

219
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
They were like, okay, well, we're not going to be able to do it in time,

220
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
so they have to bulldoze the Granite Run Mall.

221
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
And the Exton Mall has some empty wings,

222
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
and they were going to shoot there, and they weren't going to blow that up,

223
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
but I have less affection for that one.

224
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
So probably the Granite Run Mall I would have liked to have.

225
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Interesting.

226
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I mean, I was going to say, let's throw it out to the listeners,

227
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
but I don't know that we want on our Twitter,

228
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
which building do you want to blow up?

229
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I think maybe that's out of context, that might seem odd.

230
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
It's an edgy time.

231
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Yeah.

232
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Well, you're the edge.

233
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
You're the edge lord.

234
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Oh, hey, but it's the edge lord.

235
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I can activate every now suddenly everybody's an edge lord.

236
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Yeah.

237
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
You get what you fucking deserve.

238
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
You know, that is such a funny one.

239
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Words have lost so much of their meaning on the internet,

240
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
and that's such a silly one to re-click.

241
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
It's just like, it doesn't mean anything anymore.

242
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
So yeah, Scott the edge lord is so funny.

243
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Yeah, I've been loving it.

244
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I've been basking in it now that this new identity is out.

245
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I'm thrilled.

246
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Let's talk about these actual things.

247
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I mean, we could go in chronological order,

248
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
but I feel like we almost have to build to the one that started at all,

249
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
which is kind of the craziest one.

250
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:21,000
So maybe we save it, and we don't even have to do so chronologically.

251
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,000
You know, we could jump around, but there's, you know,

252
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,000
yeah, like Jason said, in the nineties, it was a real turnover in Las Vegas.

253
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:37,000
We're going from mob run Vegas to a new nineties era of scumbag.

254
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Yes.

255
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Which in many cases is Steve Wynn.

256
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I feel like a number of these are, end up being Steve Wynn properties,

257
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
and he'll factor into the episode.

258
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Yeah. And again, I cannot stress so many of these men.

259
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
It's like the league.

260
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
It's like Kevin Spacey assembled the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.

261
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
It's like so sleazy.

262
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Yeah.

263
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Every owner has had a feud with Girls Gone Wild mogul Joe Francis.

264
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I'm assuming.

265
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Yeah.

266
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:17,000
They despise the labor unions that keep their casinos running.

267
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Most of them have sexual misconduct allegations.

268
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:31,000
One that is only kind of tangentially related, funneled 500 million over 10 years into the Republican Party.

269
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
That's the 2010 to 2020 Republican Party.

270
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
So super villain level.

271
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Yeah.

272
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
That's the worst thing to funnel money into. Sure.

273
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Yeah. And then one was the former president of the United States.

274
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
And we all saw how that went.

275
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
He had to have had a tussle with Joe Francis at some point.

276
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
We have to look into that.

277
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
There had to have been like some angry phone call on some radio show in the 90s.

278
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
The girls are good.

279
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
The girls don't even go wild.

280
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I don't know what this tape is.

281
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
He's calling them wild.

282
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
They got to take the word off.

283
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I'm buying the word wild so they can't use it anymore.

284
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
They lost the right.

285
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
A tape.

286
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I mean, Trump is such a scumbag.

287
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I'm surprised he didn't market his own tape where women that were drunk and 18 took off their shirts.

288
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
That feels right, doesn't it?

289
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
That feels like a market he would have gotten into maybe at a certain point.

290
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Yeah.

291
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Yeah. Unless, well, he doesn't drink though.

292
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Maybe that's where he draws the line.

293
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
You're right. That's a good point.

294
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
He's offended on that level.

295
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Like, yeah, underage boobs, no problem.

296
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
But yeah.

297
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Yeah.

298
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:39,000
There's one that is maybe one of my favorites that I think was like the second big one.

299
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
And I don't, Jason, you can correct me.

300
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I don't see the scumbagginess in this, but I might be missing one.

301
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I'm not sure.

302
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
But so, yeah, we start blowing stuff up.

303
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
And I think 93 is the first one, which we'll come back to.

304
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
1995 is a really cool one.

305
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
They blew up a hotel called The Landmark.

306
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
And this was this.

307
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Now, if you watch a compilation, and you should, I mean, we'll recommend a lot of videos in this episode.

308
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:11,000
But if you watch a compilation of Vegas implosions, this is the one that looks like a mini space needle.

309
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
It's kind of a 60s sci-fi.

310
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
So I love the build.

311
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
This is certainly one that I would love to blow up.

312
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,000
But yeah, it's sort of like I saw it described as having a Jetsons vibe.

313
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,000
And I like any building like that where it's narrow and then the big thing up at the top.

314
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
And I forget what's here now.

315
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I think it's just a parking lot for the convention center.

316
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
This one wasn't replaced by anything too cool.

317
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I guess you got one scumbag.

318
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I think this was a Howard Hughes property.

319
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
It's weird to lump him.

320
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I mean, you'd call him that, but he's a different.

321
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
He's more fascinating.

322
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Too fascinating to call him a scumbag, I guess.

323
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Yeah, I don't think you can.

324
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I think he's too complicated.

325
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
He's not like an Iken or a Wynn or a Trump or an Adelson.

326
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I don't know.

327
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I guess we'll get to that.

328
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Oh, you will.

329
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
You will.

330
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,000
This landmark, this might be my favorite, honestly.

331
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Yeah.

332
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Yeah.

333
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I think it is the actual implosion.

334
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I think it is my favorite because they're all done in different ways.

335
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
It really depends on the architecture of the building.

336
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Most of these are done by a company called Controlled Demolition, and they're true geniuses.

337
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I mean, the one that just to the Trump one was done by the same company that did these 90s ones.

338
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:38,000
And in all cases, just knowing the pressure points and being able to make these things happen in just a matter of seconds.

339
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
And often, as we said, the shape can be very beautiful.

340
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
But this one, I think, is really cool because it splits down the middle.

341
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
It's such a strange, striking...

342
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I don't know what made them determine that it had to be done that way, but there's this odd...

343
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:58,000
It takes longer than other ones, I feel like, where it is up in the air for a while, and one side goes down,

344
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
and the other one's going slower, and then finally it all implodes in on itself.

345
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Was that an accident?

346
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Maybe.

347
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,000
It does look a little wonky, right?

348
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
It's not symmetrical.

349
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
The timing is off.

350
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Yeah.

351
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
So I don't know.

352
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I'm not actually sure.

353
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
This is Mars Attacks, right?

354
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
This is the Mars Attacks one, which I think is one of the coolest things.

355
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,000
So there's a number of implosions that happened in real life, ended up in movies.

356
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:36,000
And I'm sure things have been used as like stock footage, but this one's so recognizable, the 60s sci-fi vibe,

357
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
which is the vibe of Mars Attacks.

358
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
And it was certainly not an accident.

359
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Let's just go film anything that's imploding.

360
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Tim Burton loved this building.

361
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
He was really obsessed with this hotel, stayed in it several times.

362
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
When he heard they were tearing it down, he was really upset.

363
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:58,000
And there's quotes from him saying, like, there's got to be a way we can restore these things

364
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,000
and not just tear them to the ground, because this is like architecture history.

365
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
This is an icon to me.

366
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
But if they're going to do something with it, I want it to be in my movie.

367
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Right.

368
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Yeah.

369
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
And yes, it's perfect for the movie.

370
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Did Tim pay off some of the explosive guys and be like, make it look a little cooler than the average one?

371
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Possibly.

372
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I mean, one thing that did happen for sure that I think is cool,

373
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I love that the city has to coordinate with the old owner and the new owner or whoever it is.

374
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
There's so much involved.

375
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
And the demolition company, there's so much logistics involved.

376
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:40,000
In this case, Tim Burton is dictating terms of it a little bit, and they pushed it.

377
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,000
They made it happen later in the day so that it could happen kind of at magic hour.

378
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
He was trying to make it happen at sunset.

379
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:55,000
And it's like even the like disaffected, like the not filmy news camera version of it looks amazing.

380
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
There's this purple desert hue.

381
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I think this is the most beautiful implosion easily.

382
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Yeah, I completely agree.

383
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
And it's the coolest building of all the buildings.

384
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
The smoke is good.

385
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I mean, if we're judging the like as far as like the smoke looks cool, I don't know.

386
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I totally agree.

387
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Yeah, it like runs off in a fun way.

388
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:23,000
If you watch it in the in sequence in Mars Attacks, which I really love in general, Mars Attacks is so great.

389
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
It's like Jack Nicholson.

390
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
It's his hotel.

391
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,000
It's the second character he plays, the crazier character.

392
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
And he's up in whatever like lounges up in the top of the thing.

393
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:41,000
And they like they made all this other stuff happen, like a big globe dislodges and falls out and they added that and CG.

394
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:52,000
But yeah, like a UFO blows it up from the center, fires lasers at it, and then they send people running after like they involve it in the scene really organically and wonderfully.

395
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
And I think they account for the weird split in half.

396
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I think they have the aliens fire a second round because there was the weird lag.

397
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Right.

398
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
That works.

399
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

400
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
It just ties into the narrative.

401
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Great.

402
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:14,000
You know, one thing that I think is interesting to me about 90s Vegas is the transitional phase.

403
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Like even the first time I went to Vegas and like the mid 2000s, there's sections of the strip that are just empty lots or like just a McDonald's and a Ross or something, which now it's kind of you mentioned Star Trek earlier.

404
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
It's kind of like the Borg.

405
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
It's just the strip.

406
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
It's just one long thing.

407
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
One building blends into the other.

408
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
None of it architecturally.

409
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:44,000
None of it makes sense, but it's the excess is certainly there.

410
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:50,000
But there's some great footage on YouTube called like driving around the Vegas strip 1994.

411
00:20:50,000 --> 00:21:00,000
And it is very fascinating to see the old Vegas next to the what are they called the mega resorts, your Mirage, your MGM Grand.

412
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:08,000
And then there's just a McDonald's and that that it's just it's very interesting to me because now even a McDonald's would be elevated.

413
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
It would be like a big crazy neon McDonald's.

414
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
But yeah, back then they didn't necessarily fancy it all up.

415
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
No.

416
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Yeah, and there's those you can still like there's this little pieces of the strip left for like stores that are holding out.

417
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,000
And I don't know that like, you know, there's like a weird t-shirt store on the strip still.

418
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Yeah.

419
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:31,000
And that like these like out these like strip malls that still exist in between some of the casinos.

420
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:42,000
But most of the real estate, as you're saying, is like turned into the gaudiest, most eye catching anything, whether it's the Taco Bell or it's, you know, the Toby Keith.

421
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
I love this bar.

422
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Is that on the strip?

423
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I forget.

424
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Yeah, yeah.

425
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Or it was.

426
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
It's down a ways.

427
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
That closed.

428
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I think it used to be by the senior frogs and they might have been cutting into each other's bottom line and one of them had to close.

429
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Sure.

430
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
The Cabo Wabo is at the Planet Hollywood or something like that's all.

431
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
The last resort is at Excalibur.

432
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,000
So there's plenty of room between the crude body.

433
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
They'll make fun of you.

434
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
The waitress might have cleavage kind of.

435
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Yes, and there's twin peaks over by the Taco Bell.

436
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Oh, right.

437
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
A different restaurant.

438
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,000
That's in that one where it's like a hard rock and a Bubba Gump and a rain.

439
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I forget what they're all stacked on top of each other.

440
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
It's just a big stack of shit.

441
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
And you can climb.

442
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:36,000
You can you can battle a waitress and on a climbing wall in that restaurant.

443
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
A twin.

444
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Really?

445
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Yes.

446
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
My friends wanted to go.

447
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
I swear I'm not a little.

448
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
We went.

449
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
It's not it's nothing obviously like any of those restaurants.

450
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,000
But then I was like, all right, I guess I'll try to climb the wall.

451
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
And I was just humiliated.

452
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
I could not do it.

453
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Yeah, I got up.

454
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I got up like three things because they're doing it all the time.

455
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Well, right.

456
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I'm just saying I'm not even saying of course I expect them to be good at it because they've done it a lot.

457
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
I was so bad at it.

458
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I was shocked.

459
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,000
I was just I was like, well, maybe I'll get up like halfway and then I'll kind of fall.

460
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
No, I could I couldn't get up.

461
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
I couldn't get five feet off the ground.

462
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
It was humiliating.

463
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Wow. I didn't know about this one.

464
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Yes. Yeah.

465
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Climbing spreader got to be a lot harder than it looks.

466
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
I would imagine.

467
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
And I didn't I didn't want to do it.

468
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
But I was like, well, you know, I don't want to do it.

469
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
But I'm going to really I'm going to get up there and they're going to be like, wow, look at this guy.

470
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
How did he climb so well for being a first timer?

471
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
But no, no, I was a pathetic.

472
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
And this is like years.

473
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,000
I mean, even I'm in at least my like early 30s in this story.

474
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Well, 3030, why?

475
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
I'm for God's sake.

476
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Prime climb time.

477
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Yeah, that's the perfect time to climb.

478
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Taco Bell Cantina drinks Baja Blast with a shot of Stoli coursing through your veins, which we did.

479
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
I did go we did go to the Taco Bell Cantina.

480
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,000
This comes out like on the one year anniversary of when I was last in Vegas.

481
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:01,000
And I think the thing that I missed that I was like, I can't believe I can't believe I was there.

482
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
I didn't do it was the Twilight Zone mini golf.

483
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
I think I was.

484
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Yeah, I did.

485
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
I buy a good.

486
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Yeah, it's really fun.

487
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Yeah.

488
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,000
And the other one there with the kiss one, I forget if it's still there, if it moved or something.

489
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
But it's coming.

490
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
It's great.

491
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:20,000
I think that's at the Rio now, which is the OK, one of the ones.

492
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:26,000
You know what I think might still be a holdover from old Vegas is the circus circus block.

493
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,000
I haven't been down there and I have a feeling it kind of falls apart around there.

494
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,000
It gets shadier circus circus is kind of scary in general.

495
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
They've got this.

496
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Has anybody been to the pepper mill?

497
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
The diner that no, no, no, I hear that's fun, though.

498
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
It's like my wet dream.

499
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
It's like perverse how perfect the pepper mill looks.

500
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:56,000
It's just like bright neon purple pink brass like indoor like mini golf fountains indoors.

501
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Pepper mill is beautiful.

502
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Maybe I'd want to blow up the pepper mill if but I oh, God, I hope nothing ever happens to it.

503
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:08,000
I believe Penn Jillette has a mini pepper mill inside his house is what I read.

504
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Oh, wow. Yeah, yeah.

505
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Which is certainly what I would do if I had Penn Jillette money.

506
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Yeah.

507
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
So yeah, it gets weird and sloppy down there, though.

508
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,000
And there's a big blank area like where nothing has been built.

509
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
And is that oh, no, it's not the next.

510
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,000
That's well, you know, I might as well say we're going a little out of order.

511
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:35,000
I don't have a lot to say about this one in 2007, the Stardust, but that's like that's been blank for a long time,

512
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:40,000
even though they blew up the Stardust, which is like an iconic original Vegas one.

513
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:48,000
But I learned this morning that friend of the show, Matt Mazzani was there for the implosion.

514
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,000
He was just passing through Vegas and it happened to be that day.

515
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:59,000
And he watched it happen. He said it was spectacular and that there was essentially like a tailgate going on,

516
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:04,000
like so many people were there and partying and just passing beer around.

517
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:12,000
So he just got free beer in general from the crowd as everybody cheered a building imploding.

518
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:17,000
So I'm very jealous of Matt that he got to experience one of these in person because I have not.

519
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,000
But I bring some of that up to say because that is the area we're talking about.

520
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,000
It's right next to Circus Circus and the Riviera, which is recently blown up.

521
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:34,000
And that for so long has just been a blank zone where they're supposed to be building something called Resorts World.

522
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:44,000
And Resorts World is part of Genting Group. Genting, which came up a long time ago with Fox Studios Malaysia.

523
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,000
And one of your favorite so many nefarious characters are coming back.

524
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:54,000
One of yours, Jason's favorite guy, Mercurial Casino Chairman Lim Cock Thay.

525
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Lim Cock Thay. One of these now imploded sites.

526
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:06,000
I don't know. I don't know what sort of sinister shit casino magnets across the world get into.

527
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:11,000
But compared to the American, I don't know, maybe Lim Cock Thay is a saint.

528
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Who knows? He's Mercurial. He's a mystery.

529
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Mercurial doesn't mean you're bad. It could mean you're good and you're embarrassed how good you are.

530
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Yeah. Right. So I thought I was going to be embarrassed how good I was at rock climbing against a waitress.

531
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Yeah. I was not.

532
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
The Resorts World project is fascinating.

533
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:42,000
It's so many of these Vegas things just take years and years and there's bankruptcies and economic downturns, the pandemic now.

534
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:50,000
So much goes on to actually get these massive mega resorts open.

535
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:55,000
I think that's pretty far along at this point, but it's still taking years and years.

536
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:05,000
There's one of the first major implosion was in order to build the Bellagio.

537
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:10,000
And that was four years, all told, which is like, I think that's gunning it.

538
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:15,000
And especially for such a giant and impressive casino.

539
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:20,000
I think you're not usually that lucky to just have it done in four.

540
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Yeah.

541
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Yeah, that's like Universal Studios building.

542
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Oh, yeah.

543
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Or they just crank their crank and stuff out at this point.

544
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Crank to get that Cinderella Man screen ride open.

545
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,000
You know, they're grinding, you know, right on time.

546
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Yes.

547
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:44,000
They got to get it open for the canceled Cinderella Man 2. Back to the ball.

548
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:50,000
What do you like? Do you punch along with him like the Spider-Man ride? Like it tracks your fists.

549
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Well, that went away after much like a Vegas amusement attraction that within a month, they're like, all right, we're taking this out.

550
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:05,000
The punching along stopped being interactive after about three weeks because it was just too hard to work.

551
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:10,000
The whole land teaches you, like it trains you to be a boxer. You are the boxer.

552
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Yes.

553
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
You know, that's what it's about.

554
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Yeah, yeah.

555
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
You're certified by the end.

556
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Right.

557
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:22,000
I pulled up the Stardust Implosion and this, I think, is the first one.

558
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Maybe I just saw an abbreviated landmark one, but this one especially, the theme park connection that struck me the most in a lot of these is there is a grand nighttime spectacular of coordinated multicolored fireworks before the controlled demolition.

559
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,000
And that if that isn't theme park, I don't know what is, you know?

560
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Yeah, there's like long fireworks shows before some of these.

561
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Yes. Yeah.

562
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
And this one, I'm losing track of my.

563
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Yeah, this one has the numbers, of course, the countdown.

564
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Oh, that's really cool.

565
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Yes. Like flames go off in the windows that take so many to take you all the way from 10 to one.

566
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Yeah. So like the whole front of the building has big like old school alarm clock digital letters, essentially.

567
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Like that's how they they're not like nice, cool cursive or anything.

568
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
It's just like these straight lines.

569
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,000
They did their best that time. I'm not. I sounds like I'm shitting on them. But yes, I like.

570
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
It's cool as hell. It's great.

571
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Yeah, it's weird. It's cool and weird. It's I don't know. It's like.

572
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Yeah, you turned. It's like I'm trying to think it's like you turned.

573
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:48,000
It's like if it's like the early version of maybe how Disney does like mapping park mapping now, how you can put different textures on the front of the castle or the Tower of Terror.

574
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:53,000
But this one is just like, well, we'll turn we'll get some of the lights on and there'll be some straight lines and we'll do our best.

575
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
And you got to admire it. You got to love it.

576
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Yeah, there's not so many that you can.

577
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:06,000
There's not so many options in terms of decorating the building, so you got to be impressed when they they can figure something out.

578
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Another one I don't have a lot to say about it.

579
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:13,000
I don't even know the year, but there's there's one the frontier and that one has a three, two, one.

580
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:18,000
And then also the detonator machine, also the loony tunes.

581
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:23,000
They make the box and the lever and it goes down and then the building goes down.

582
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:29,000
So that's pretty I shouldn't throw the frontier under the bus because having the living detonator is pretty great.

583
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Yeah, I mean, you can you can find something.

584
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,000
I like how everybody wants. They're like, let's make this implosion our own.

585
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Let's let's give a little something unique in each one.

586
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:41,000
And the in the box is a very nice touch because you wouldn't know they're not.

587
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:46,000
It's not like you get a program when you go to an implosion and says, OK, well, the first will be the fireworks show, then the countdown.

588
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
And then you'll see the box and the box will go down.

589
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:57,000
So I feel like you would be a nice surprise if you were waiting there all day tailgating and you get to yeah, you get to have fun with that little Easter egg.

590
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:03,000
That's like the Tupac hologram coming out at least weekend one where they didn't know it was going to happen.

591
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Right. At this point, there should be like a hologram for these implosions.

592
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:16,000
I mean, I think I'm sure we'll sum up at the end, but like I want to get to a place back where we're thinking ambitious again.

593
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Vaccines are out. The world has opened up again.

594
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Let's think about getting ambitious with these with these implosions.

595
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Yeah, they got to get stupid again, because I do think we lost our way a little bit.

596
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:41,000
So if we're if we're back in the chronological order, the next big one that I have is the Sands, which was in 1996.

597
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000
It is this is the spot that is now the Venetian.

598
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:54,000
This is a bit of a big rat pack kind of spot to get for the old generation of scumbags giving way to the new.

599
00:32:54,000 --> 00:33:00,000
The this one, there's no movie involved in the making of this one.

600
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:09,000
But really recently, I think when maybe in the time that the Sands have been closed, they did shoot the finale of Con Air in front of this.

601
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Well, like the Con Air plane screeches to a halt in the lobby of like where the cars park basically.

602
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:24,000
And then the news footage that I saw like shows that practically happening.

603
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
The movie I don't think was out yet.

604
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,000
And everybody's a lot of anticipation for Con Air.

605
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:33,000
They were right. Con Air is pretty pretty dumb and fun.

606
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Yeah, yeah, for sure.

607
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Yeah, this one is this one's good.

608
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
It's kind of like just like a little cake collapsing.

609
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:48,000
It's just like like somebody put a big straw in a cake and sucked out all the insides from the cake and then the cake just sort of collapsed in on itself.

610
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
It's nice, it's simple.

611
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Well, yeah, you know, the actual implosion itself, there's not a lot to write home about.

612
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,000
But here's what I like about this one.

613
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
This is where we start getting into.

614
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:06,000
This is the after I think the success of the first of the dunes in 93, which we'll get to the.

615
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Local news starts realizing that this can be a thing.

616
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:17,000
We can squeeze a lot of juice out of an implosion happening live on TV.

617
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:27,000
And especially the mother might have been multiple channels, but the one that jumps out and that is archived really nicely on YouTube is News 13.

618
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:32,000
And the good people at News 13 put on such a good show every year.

619
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Every year. This is kind of why I've been obsessed with this for a little while, because a YouTube user named access Vegas dot com.

620
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:44,000
And I will give him credit because it's amazing they post all this great Vegas nonsense.

621
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:54,000
They they're just there's these full hour long specials showing an implosion happening live that are such wonderful exercises in time killing.

622
00:34:54,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Just like how much for something that unfolds in a matter of 10 seconds, basically, how much other crap can we put at the beginning and the end?

623
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
How many reporters can we have down there?

624
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,000
How many cameras can we set up?

625
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:14,000
And I'll play a little clip here that kind of illustrates the vibe that I like about this.

626
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Here is a little bit of News 13's coverage of the implosion of the sands.

627
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:25,000
I'm Steve Kruppi. We're getting ready for another heavyweight knockdown in Las Vegas.

628
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,000
You'll see all the angles right here.

629
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:35,000
I'm Mark Martinez, soaring above the sands in live Chopper 13 where the view of the implosion promises to be spectacular.

630
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,000
I'm Mark Sayer inside the blast zone. We are as close as any human is going to get to this.

631
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
We're expecting a huge dust cloud. We're ready for it.

632
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
And we'll have the play by play.

633
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:48,000
I'm Robin Berg, three stories up, giving you yet another view of 18 stories.

634
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Yet another. And I'm Michael Gieser, street side.

635
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,000
This is where the public will gather to witness history.

636
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,000
This is a News 13 special report.

637
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Love it so much. Love the music. Love the names.

638
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Michael Gieser. These people are all awesome. They did such great work.

639
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:15,000
And that's not at first. I thought they were like actually winking a little bit.

640
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
And then I realized, no, they're not.

641
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Yeah, no, I don't think so. I think they're all in.

642
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,000
I think they're there. It's the celebrity that you have.

643
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:29,000
If you're a local news anchor, especially at this time with less channels and everything, this is this is prime time for them.

644
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,000
This is everybody's chance to shine. And they're they're psyched.

645
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:41,000
I like that he says play by play as if he's going to be like counting down the room numbers as the each room collapses, like as if there's time for any sort of play by play.

646
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Like the gym, the hotel gym has collapsed.

647
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,000
The the free weights have disintegrated into dust.

648
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,000
They left them in there for some reason. I'm not sure why.

649
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:57,000
There goes the meeting rooms on floor three.

650
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:02,000
A salesman who went to an expo there. You won't again.

651
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Yeah, there's no time play by play.

652
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Is he talking about? Yeah, what what they do instead is just kill a lot of time with like setting up all of the cameras that are going to be there.

653
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,000
And this is the one where I think it really gets going. I wrote down a bunch.

654
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:27,000
They just like there's people in the studio and then some of the reporters are with the cameras, but some of the cameras nobody is with because it's going to be right in the blast zone.

655
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Like something bad is going to happen to the cameras is the only way to get this perspective.

656
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,000
So they introduce all the cameras one by one.

657
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:39,000
You got the balcony cam and that's like out on that's like up on one of the top penthouses.

658
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:43,000
And something they say with that a lot is like we're going to write it down.

659
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:54,000
We're going to ride the building all the way to the ground and then the zoom cam and the hallway cam and the roof cam and the the I don't even capture cam.

660
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,000
That can't be right. I must have written the wrong word.

661
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Copter is probably what it's probably open.

662
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Or the collapse cam or the blast cam and the blast cam is the best one because this keeps factoring into them where this now is a veteran.

663
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:17,000
We've used this in implosion after implosion and that's set up so that the building falls right on it.

664
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:23,000
It's right in the path. We've tried to kill it in the past and it didn't go down and we're going to try to kill it again tonight.

665
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Let's see if the blast cam survives.

666
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:32,000
So are they getting a feed off that or they're then like they have to go retrieve it later on.

667
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
It's got to be a feed. Yeah, it's got to be a feed.

668
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
They were thinking they would be blown up. It had to be a live feed.

669
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Yeah, because there's no way if they said it didn't get killed last like they must just be like let's punish this camera.

670
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:50,000
And it's just on a long rope that they just like once the implosion is done, they just got to pull it out from the rubble.

671
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,000
All right, buddy. Yank you back in. Thanks again.

672
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Yeah, I think so because they get the footage back real fast.

673
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:01,000
And then of course, the second half of the broadcast is just let's see that again.

674
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Now let's see it again from the roof cam.

675
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Now let's see it again from the balcony cam.

676
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:12,000
And it turns out the blast cam made it and I even hear some of the spectators are pointing at the camera and saying how did the camera make it?

677
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Well, it just because it has stamina. It's the blast cam and it's a veteran of many implosions.

678
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Wow, many.

679
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Yeah, this is the blast cam made it through like six or something.

680
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
It is pretty amazing. That's a feat.

681
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Wow, this is like the toughest camera that's ever been invented.

682
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Why don't they know if it ever went down the whole plane out of the blast cam?

683
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Yeah, I will. This blast cam.

684
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Is it in a museum? It should be in a museum somewhere at this point.

685
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:51,000
And then people should be able to pay and take to take shots at it to see if they can take it down.

686
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Can you climb up with the blast cam to the top of rock climbing wall and throw it with all your might?

687
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
And can you break it? Oh, yeah.

688
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Where the waitress does or Vegas has those firing ranges where you can fire a fully automatic like machine gun.

689
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:12,000
If you could just open up like on the blast cam, the blast cam, the standard definition.

690
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:18,000
The standard footage, you know that there's no HD cameras are to set like to they're not made sturdy enough.

691
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,000
You know, they're not going to survive like the blast cam did.

692
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Yeah, these are tanks. Absolutely.

693
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Yeah, but also the blast cam. If you sign the waiver, it can take a shot at you. So be careful.

694
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:32,000
I'd be honored to get clipped by the blast cam.

695
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
I lost a toe to the blast cam.

696
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Yeah, Jason, Jason, you realize Jason Sheridan gunned down by the blast cam in the desert of Vegas.

697
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Throw my corpse off the top of the stratosphere.

698
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,000
He always loved. He always loved heights.

699
00:40:53,000 --> 00:41:01,000
It's a shame he could not ride the was it the high roller was that the roller coaster they tore down piece by piece in the elevator.

700
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Oh, I got to really like take it out piece by piece.

701
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:12,000
You know what? I don't want to spoil it forever. Go to there's a playlist expedition theme park.

702
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
I'm sure people are familiar with these videos.

703
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:26,000
They have a playlist of how the like a lot of the 90s Vegas attractions and the roller coaster that used to circle the top of the stratosphere has a really good one.

704
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:35,000
That and the Prim attractions and the the MGM, which is that's a big one we haven't done yet is the MGM.

705
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Oh, yeah. Park that they really see it like they cut the ribbon and they were like, oh, we hate this.

706
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
We were going to let this rot.

707
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:51,000
We want pool parties here. We want gross pool parties as fast as they could possibly have.

708
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Yeah, yeah.

709
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,000
There's like I feel like there's a year of podcasts, the ride content from Vegas.

710
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,000
We've done it slowly. I feel like how many Vegas related episodes have we done?

711
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Is this the fourth? I don't know.

712
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Something like, yeah, not too many.

713
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
There's a lot. There's so much more.

714
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:15,000
And it's like all from the 90s. Also, it was all that this one big explosion that required lots of implosions.

715
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:23,000
I think we were I tossed out the there's the special about the Luxor, the interconnected Luxor attractions.

716
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:30,000
And then every I think it got I totally forgot about it because everything went into quarantine.

717
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,000
But like right around the start of that, I saw the Luxors.

718
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:40,000
But I was like, I can't believe they attempted this like no Disney or Universal would have kept that going.

719
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Like it was so complicated.

720
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:47,000
It's three attractions that are all kind of of the same world and plot line.

721
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:52,000
But one's a Back to the Future ride type thing made by that director, Doug Trumbull.

722
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,000
And another is like a talk show.

723
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:02,000
You're watching a live talk show happen that involves the events of the simulator ride.

724
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
I think I'm not making this up.

725
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:10,000
No, you're not. And the actors, you would need the actors like it's basically like a residency

726
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:16,000
or like a Broadway show run where it's like, oh, the actors in this are the actors in the talk show.

727
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,000
And that's wild. Wow.

728
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Yeah, I say I don't know how to parse out Vegas if you do a theme month or do you just like spread it through the show?

729
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Because we have to do one once a month to keep up pace.

730
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:37,000
There's so much Vegas nonsense. I mean, maybe a Vegas month in the future is a good idea to get a bunch of some of the big stuff out of the way.

731
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
And then we can keep. Yeah.

732
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:46,000
I mean, obviously we have to return to the David Copperfield theater also and see how the show is doing and how they've updated it.

733
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:51,000
They've updated it. Tickets on sale March 15th. Who knows what they're going up.

734
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:55,000
I wouldn't say go yet, but yeah, eventually when it's good, when you're good.

735
00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:01,000
You know, since we're jumping around a little along with the main timeline,

736
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:12,000
friend of the show, Andrew Grissom reminded me that David Copperfield did an illusion involving a building implosion.

737
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Does anyone remember this? Have you seen this? I have seen this, but I did not refresh myself before this episode.

738
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:23,000
It's you know, it's just a really good one. I can't even exactly.

739
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:27,000
There's nothing like blue to snark on. It just is great.

740
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:33,000
He he gets locked in a safe in a building that's getting imploded in Charlotte, North Carolina,

741
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,000
and he has two and a half minutes to get out.

742
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:45,000
And one camera follows like the police officers who handcuff him and then all of the safety workers who all run out together

743
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:51,000
and another camera stays trained on the lock to see if it moves or if anything happens.

744
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:55,000
And I don't want to give it away, but it's it's just great.

745
00:44:55,000 --> 00:45:00,000
You've like, boy, he was good at that. Those 90s specials are fantastic.

746
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Yeah. Oh, yeah, I got it. I'll check. I'll check back in on that.

747
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Well, we can we can revisit it when we go back to the Copperfield Theatre to see how the show is doing.

748
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:13,000
We could just watch a bunch of those old one. I mean, yeah, there's a ton there.

749
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:19,000
But isn't it what is it? What is it with this episode where so many of our favorite characters are returning?

750
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:24,000
We've had the Mercurial Chairman, we've had Copperfield, Steve Winfrey,

751
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Steve Wynn comes in and out. It's like we just did an episode about Mickey's house and Toontown.

752
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:34,000
And it is like Vegas is Toontown for some of our favorite characters.

753
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:43,000
You know, they live in these places, stuff we people Steve Wynn, David Copperfield, Jimmy Buffett, Margaritaville.

754
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:50,000
I mean, there's so many Sammy Hagar Hagar there who I just learned wrote the I thought Rick Springfield wrote the song.

755
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,000
I would do anything. I've done everything for you.

756
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,000
But Sammy Hagar wrote that song. How about that?

757
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Who does the song? Who's the singer of it?

758
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:02,000
Rick Springfield's like, I've done everything for you.

759
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,000
You've done nothing for me. I thought it was Rick Springfield written song.

760
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
It's not. It's Sammy Hagar, the man himself.

761
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:12,000
Wow. The legend. Shocked. He stumped me though. I don't know that song.

762
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:16,000
I think you've heard it. It's in a movie. Is it in Wet Hot American Summer?

763
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
No, that's Love Is Alright Tonight.

764
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,000
That's Love Is Alright Tonight. It's something else then. Sorry.

765
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
Wonderful song. Great song.

766
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:27,000
The OK, so you're getting back on the trajectory.

767
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Oh, and actually, because here's what I'm starting to as I'm going through these specials and I've been like, this has been a great excuse to why I've watched these years ago.

768
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:39,000
But Aaron and I have been watching them together again.

769
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:44,000
We spent Valentine's Day watching an implosion special with a bottle of wine.

770
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:50,000
And I regret nothing. In quarantine times, that's about as great of a Valentine's Day as you're going to get.

771
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:56,000
So revisiting all these, especially via the News 13 coverage, I'm starting to fall in love with these people.

772
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:01,000
I think all of these anchors are great. And then you see kind of some push and pull.

773
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Like people rise up in the ranks. There's somebody who's like, you know, I've been stuck in the studio for the implosions most years.

774
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:14,000
This is actually the first one that I've seen in person and I have to say in person, it's amazing.

775
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:19,000
You really feel the rumble. It's just, you know, nothing can describe it.

776
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Then another guy will say, oh, this is actually my sixth.

777
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,000
So when you make it up to six, you'll really know the ins and outs.

778
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Like they're kind of like one upping each other in terms of implosion counts.

779
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:39,000
I love it. These people, like I want to I want to hang out with the News 13 gang.

780
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:49,000
I want to I would love to I was thinking how I would like to moderate a panel reuniting the many years running implosion crew

781
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:56,000
and just like see if they've kept up and perspective they have on implosions that they didn't 25 years ago.

782
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:02,000
I mean, this is this is one of those hypothetical projects that would be really great if you spent a ton of time on it.

783
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Yeah, yeah. If I just like poured lots and lots of all the time that I have,

784
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:15,000
if I if I stunted my own career that I'm trying to keep vaguely on track, if I just.

785
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
All right. Screw all that. Let's implode it.

786
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:25,000
And instead, let's go talk to let's go see if I can track down Steve Kruppi.

787
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Let's get the reunion zoom going.

788
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:33,000
Well, Robin Burke said yes, we got Rob.

789
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:37,000
Then you're filming a documentary about the making of the documentary where like she says yes.

790
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:40,000
Yes, we got Robin Burke. There's a big celebration and champagne.

791
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,000
We got Robin. We got Robin.

792
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:47,000
I as I put down the phone, there's no one else in the room.

793
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:53,000
There's just a mirror, a dirty mirror that you're looking at.

794
00:48:54,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Dirty from kisses like you got Michael Gieser, you sharp son of a bitch.

795
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
I believe in you and I always have.

796
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
And then like it cuts to the mirror and it's you.

797
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:13,000
But in a different like you've lost your mind and you're like, have you been it's the last time you saw your son?

798
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
This documentary is your son now, isn't it? Yes.

799
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:19,000
And what's wrong with that? What's wrong with that? Me?

800
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:22,000
I'm the edge lord now. I don't need you.

801
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
I mean, I've punched the mirror.

802
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:28,000
I slice myself with one of the shards in the face.

803
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
Now I have a cool scar. I live here.

804
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:36,000
I live here in the Riviera stripped, stripped everything sold every item liquidated.

805
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:44,000
But still it has the aura of cigarette smoke and the grease, everything covered as if it was rubbed with ham.

806
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:57,000
So I'm living in the like the remains of the Riviera, just like finding expired Wendy's patties that were somewhere in the fire.

807
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:05,000
I have a summer home. I have a summer home in the remains of Speed the Ride sitting unattended in an empty lot by Bandolier Bay.

808
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:11,000
If if if Covid were to stretch into 2022, I don't think this scenario is unlikely.

809
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:15,000
No, we've all just made mine for all for all for all of us.

810
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:20,000
For all of us. We've all made mind palaces of extinct, disgusting casinos.

811
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:27,000
My version, my version is like I look at the mirror and I'm like, have you gotten all four punk frog side characters from the new Ninja Turtle neck a line?

812
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,000
No, you haven't found them. Why not?

813
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,000
It's like, well, when was the last time you talked to your parents?

814
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:40,000
A year, but it doesn't matter because I need to get Rasputin the Mad Frog, my favorite of the four frog friends.

815
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:45,000
If I'd been raised by Rasputin, none of this would have happened.

816
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:49,000
I need to start dressing like him with his Hawaiian shirt and his little shorts.

817
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
I am that Rasputin now.

818
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:59,000
I've built little beds for all four of them. All they need to do is arrive at my door.

819
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:04,000
They look like lily pads. They sleep on lily pads made out of napkins.

820
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:10,000
I've tracked the ley lines of Las Vegas with the Krispy Kreme donut locations.

821
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:14,000
They seem to be everywhere. People want excess. People want indulgences.

822
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:19,000
And I think Anton Levese's works probably have something to say about this.

823
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Jason is like, if I build the world's largest glass, I can dunk myself in.

824
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,000
I will become the cookie.

825
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:32,000
Yeah, the Church of Satan, you know, the rules do no harm, but do what thou wilt.

826
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,000
So, you know, that's the first part of the saying.

827
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Jason Sheridan died today, drowned in a giant glass of milk.

828
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Requested that his doomsday say, Jason Sheridan, a great cookie.

829
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:50,000
If it goes longer, that's where we're at.

830
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,000
Yeah, maybe like end of April.

831
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,000
We know it's going to be going then. Just how mad will we be?

832
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,000
Yeah, also, by the way, the right amount.

833
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,000
Mine was, by the way, the closest to actually what's happening.

834
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
Oh, yeah.

835
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:09,000
I have a dry one with a little bit of a dry one.

836
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:12,000
I have a dry one with a little bit of a dry one.

837
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:15,000
I have a dry one with a little bit of a dry one.

838
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,000
I have a dry one with a little bit of a dry one.

839
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:30,000
This is sort of will be good for content, but I'm surrounded by so many books written by Martin Pegler that are all like just like this one's called storefronts and facades.

840
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,000
I've been collecting these during the pandemic.

841
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:41,000
It'll just be like photos of the front of, you know, a Dave and Buster's or a Planet Hollywood retail store.

842
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:45,000
It is the I mean, we'll get content out of this for sure.

843
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:53,000
But like, here's like really artful photos of like a footlocker, like a really fancy footlocker.

844
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
There actually is good stuff in it.

845
00:52:55,000 --> 00:53:03,000
Did you know, Mike, that there was a not a Planet Hollywood in the Schomburg Mall, but just a Planet Hollywood store?

846
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
They were trying to do stores without the restaurant.

847
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
Oh, that is familiar.

848
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
I would not. I don't know.

849
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
Do you know how when it was there?

850
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:14,000
I'd have to study my Martin Pegler books a little more.

851
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:19,000
I'm not sure if it's in storefronts and facades or retail experiences.

852
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,000
Number three.

853
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
I feel like it was brief.

854
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:25,000
Because you know, there's that period where I did not go to Mars and Woodfield.

855
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:30,000
So there was a period where I was apparently not enjoying garbage, like garbage, kitschy bullshit.

856
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,000
Man. Yeah.

857
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
Well, we all have that dark period in our lives.

858
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
Mine was college.

859
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
I was trying to, you know, expand my horizons and date.

860
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
What a fool I was.

861
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,000
Now I'm back on track.

862
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
Yuck is all I can say.

863
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:52,000
The most famous in the theme park world, free standing Planet Hollywood store at Disney MGM Studios, right on the Sunset Boulevard extension.

864
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,000
There was just.

865
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
Oh, it was its own? Really?

866
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Yep. Right in the middle on the way to Tarotary.

867
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,000
You pop in.

868
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
You look at Planet Hollywood shirts.

869
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:04,000
You know, you've already looked at them at downtown Disney.

870
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,000
You know, that's bizarre.

871
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:11,000
Another one of these I have in front of me is just called streetscapes.

872
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:16,000
And this is like a nice coffee table book that's just a photo of City Walk on the front.

873
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Perfect.

874
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
There's Crab Tree in Evelyn.

875
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
There's the Nature Company.

876
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,000
Wow.

877
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:26,000
So I don't I don't I guess I can't say I have any regrets.

878
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,000
No.

879
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:31,000
Yeah. Well, content will be coming your way from streetscapes.

880
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Is there.

881
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Back to the madness at hand.

882
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Yeah.

883
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:41,000
I think what I was trying to say about these anchors, here's just a quick clip of which which guy is this?

884
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:44,000
I think this is Mark Sayers.

885
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:48,000
He's kind of the one who's the most braggy about how many he's been part of.

886
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:53,000
And this is just an example of the great like, all right, I am surrounded by smoke.

887
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:57,000
And how can I kill time on camera for six straight minutes?

888
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:01,000
And he ended up just rambling to eat till you get to this.

889
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:04,000
I hope you I hope you can see this in front of me.

890
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:11,000
We literally have just turned in, turned night into additional night to more night to additional blackness.

891
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:14,000
It is really quite an experience.

892
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:18,000
Just now the night has become more night.

893
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
It is almost double night.

894
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,000
It's I did not know night could be so nighty.

895
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:26,000
But that is what implosions have taught us.

896
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:31,000
And that's why it's important to see them and support them.

897
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,000
He that is off.

898
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:36,000
He does not report on levels of darkness very often.

899
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:40,000
I can tell that is not something that he has in his in his brain.

900
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:43,000
I will also say it really made me uncomfortable because he was not wearing an N95.

901
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:49,000
He was wearing a really flimsy mask that you might wear when you're like doing some woodwork or something.

902
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:52,000
Yeah, no goggles, no safety glasses.

903
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,000
He had his goggles off too.

904
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:56,000
So I was like, oh, he's breathing in some bad crap.

905
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,000
Yeah, we're so mask conscious at this point.

906
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:04,000
It is funny what like that they go out of their way to say, and I even brought a mask.

907
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:07,000
It's like very chilling to watch in our current environment.

908
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:14,000
And yeah, knowing that like, yeah, that's not going to do anything for he's talking about like I can really smell that acrid smell.

909
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
Oh, no way.

910
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:20,000
Then this is one thing that has come up as Aaron and I've been watching these.

911
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:24,000
I said, like, God, I really, man, I want to go to an implosion one day.

912
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:31,000
And she's like, yeah, you want to go like breathe in just like concentrated asbestos?

913
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:36,000
Yeah, it was like, how much can I have in one sitting?

914
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
Now, there's a good point.

915
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:50,000
Yeah, there's a short documentary I watched a while back and I think it was I don't know if then this is later chronologically, but the Riviera, there was concern when that was coming down to there was a bunch of asbestos in it.

916
00:56:50,000 --> 00:57:00,000
They're like, we think we got it all out and they imploded part of it and immediately they discovered it's like we have set asbestos particles into the air.

917
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,000
No. Yeah.

918
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:10,000
And so like, you know, this is the one thing we didn't want to happen immediately happened like, yeah.

919
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,000
Yes.

920
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:17,000
There's a process in all these, I think, where I like Aaron about the dunes one that before any of it, they had to go.

921
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:20,000
It cost $800,000 to do asbestos removal.

922
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:24,000
So that's a whole step and you try to get it out before you blow it into the air.

923
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:27,000
Yeah, but they can't get all of it.

924
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:30,000
They can't get all the way or they think they got all of it.

925
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:33,000
And it's like, oh, we forgot that floor.

926
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:40,000
So I whoopsie whoopsie whoops whoops again.

927
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:49,000
The quoting last episode, the yeah, these that's one funny thing about these like and there goes smoke just all over.

928
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:52,000
I've been watching the Trump one was funny with that, too.

929
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:57,000
I like yeah, it can't be good to be in the vicinity of these.

930
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,000
It can't be good for that.

931
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,000
I don't know what else you do.

932
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
I don't know how you take these down otherwise.

933
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:06,000
But but yeah, maybe don't be close, close by.

934
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,000
Yeah.

935
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
Maybe get far away for a while.

936
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:12,000
Yeah, that would be my unless you like.

937
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
I don't think you can't tent it or anything.

938
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
You can't tent it, then blow it up.

939
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,000
There's one that I watched.

940
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:26,000
I think the Aladdin that had VIP tent and the reporter was saying how this is as close to the blast zone as you could be.

941
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:29,000
But you also know that that tense just going to just be like poof.

942
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:32,000
And then it's just covered in dust and you can't see it anymore.

943
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:35,000
At the very least to N95 if you're going to do it.

944
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:36,000
That's what I would say.

945
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,000
Yeah.

946
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,000
Yeah.

947
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:43,000
There are plenty of those around this time in the 2021 implosion.

948
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:59,000
I guess here we keep moving to the this was just an implosion horrific time in Vegas because right after the sands just a few months later, they blew up one called the Hacienda and the Hacienda.

949
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:05,000
They made this happen on New Year's Eve 1996.

950
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
Big old fireworks show.

951
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:12,000
They seem to be playing the Mission Impossible theme along with it, which is really good.

952
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,000
Perfect.

953
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
And I didn't have a lot of info about this one.

954
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
I couldn't even find the local news coverage.

955
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
I'm like, was this kind of a quieter one?

956
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:33,000
I guess maybe this and then late breaking right before we started recording, I found that I think maybe maybe the networks saw News 13 and Steve Kruppie and all their great work.

957
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
And they're like, we need a piece of this action.

958
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:38,000
We got to bring this to the big leagues.

959
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:53,000
So Fox in 1996 for their New Year's Eve coverage not only covered the implosion live, but made it the centerpiece of their entire thing because there's Dick Clark's Rockin' Eve.

960
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:54,000
And that's still what they do.

961
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:59,000
But they wanted to start a new New Year's franchise.

962
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:04,000
And here I'll reveal this title within the clip itself.

963
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:11,000
Hell yes.

964
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
The best graphics I've ever seen.

965
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,000
Starring the Doobie Brothers.

966
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
Coo-dee-la-maw Fish.

967
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:17,000
Salt and Pepper.

968
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,000
Siegfried and Roy.

969
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,000
The Treasure Island.

970
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,000
Buckethead Bay Pirates.

971
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,000
Cirque du Soleil.

972
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:28,000
And the live implosion of the Hacienda Hotel.

973
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:37,000
And then Sinbad does stand up and he makes fun of people's yard drinks.

974
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:40,000
It's just a great block of television.

975
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
It's so fun.

976
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:43,000
It rules.

977
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:47,000
Yeah, Jason, as you said, amazing graphics.

978
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:53,000
It's like clock spinning and unreadable fonts and unnecessary capitalizations.

979
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:56,000
They do the N and the B in Sinbad.

980
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,000
That doesn't make sense.

981
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
No, it doesn't.

982
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:07,000
Hootie and the Blowfish and Cirque du Soleil and Doobie Brothers.

983
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:10,000
I mean, we might have to put that on one of the Ampersand shirts.

984
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:13,000
We might have to sell that one.

985
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:17,000
The greatest group ever and the Hacienda explosion.

986
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:21,000
And there's one celebrity that I have not mentioned.

987
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:26,000
They got a celebrity involved in the implosion part itself.

988
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
I don't have the time code.

989
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,000
I don't want to spoil it.

990
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:30,000
Robert Blake.

991
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
This might be like the best.

992
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:41,000
This might be the pull quote of all pull quotes.

993
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
And now you guys are seeing them.

994
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
Let me find the moment.

995
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
And I might not have it timed out right.

996
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
There might be a little extra lead time.

997
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:53,000
But this might be the best thing ever said during implosion coverage.

998
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
By 96.

999
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
Welcome 97.

1000
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:01,000
Let's get ready to crumble.

1001
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:08,000
Let's get ready to crumble.

1002
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
Did you know where it was going?

1003
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
Is anybody like I'm ahead of it?

1004
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
I know what it's going to be instead of rumble.

1005
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:17,000
Or did you think it was just going to be rumble?

1006
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
You know, I didn't even think that far ahead.

1007
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:23,000
I guess I assumed it would be rumble or rubble.

1008
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
Rubble would be good.

1009
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
Yeah, pretty good.

1010
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:30,000
Get ready for rubble.

1011
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
Let's get ready for rubble.

1012
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,000
Yeah, that would be good.

1013
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,000
I feel stupid.

1014
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
Was that Vince?

1015
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,000
Who was that?

1016
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,000
That's Michael Buffer.

1017
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,000
Michael Buffer.

1018
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:40,000
Michael Buffer.

1019
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,000
Okay, I could not place his name.

1020
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
You thought it was Vince McMahon?

1021
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:48,000
Well, young Vince, I keep watching older WWE stuff.

1022
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:52,000
And it is crazy what Vince McMahon looks like now compared to...

1023
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
He wasn't that young in the 90s.

1024
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
But I was like 50.

1025
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,000
Yeah.

1026
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
I mean, there's a similar vibe.

1027
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:00,000
There's a little, yeah.

1028
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:04,000
The pompadour, the poof, I think, was doing a lot of work when I was looking at...

1029
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
Big meaty cheekbones.

1030
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:09,000
Vince wasn't white haired though back then.

1031
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:10,000
Yes, that's true.

1032
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
Yeah, that's the only difference.

1033
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,000
They really should have...

1034
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:16,000
Like some wrestling interaction with implosion.

1035
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:19,000
I mean, that'd be a good way to...

1036
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:25,000
Just like, I don't know, having one of them do it or like a fight is happening in the minutes before...

1037
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:28,000
Like they got to wrap it up before the countdown starts.

1038
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
They really should have done something.

1039
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:34,000
You mean like two guys are battling in a building that's about to be imploded?

1040
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
Yes. Yeah. Yeah.

1041
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:39,000
And they have to get to some resolution here or they both die.

1042
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
Mm-hmm. That's pretty good.

1043
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:42,000
Yeah.

1044
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:46,000
That's shocking that didn't happen in the 90s.

1045
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
Like some of those 90s that...

1046
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:56,000
I was watching like the 98 or 99 Royal Rumble and just immediately share shots to the head within minutes.

1047
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:00,000
And it's just like, oh no. Oh no.

1048
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,000
Oh yeah, yeah.

1049
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:05,000
You're saying that shocked you as much as a match about guys getting blown up.

1050
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
Vince got blown up in a limo.

1051
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
Well, I remember the limo. Yes.

1052
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
Our ex-president thought it was real.

1053
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:12,000
Yes.

1054
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
Oh, he called him to check in.

1055
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:15,000
He called him to check in.

1056
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:16,000
Yeah.

1057
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:21,000
Trump saw Vince's limo blow up on Monday Night Raw and called to make sure Vince was okay.

1058
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:24,000
You know what's a trip to watch that I caught?

1059
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:35,000
A couple of them recently is the Rock hosting in 2000 and 2002, his monologues and like just what was going on in the world in 2002.

1060
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:39,000
The first two sketches are about a rash of suicide bombings in the Middle East.

1061
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
And you're like, wow.

1062
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:42,000
With the SNLs?

1063
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:46,000
Yeah, the SNLs. It's like, wow, coming out swinging.

1064
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:51,000
Wait, I guess that's... Yeah, wait. Did he host sort of soon after 9-11? Was it...

1065
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:56,000
Yeah, I think it was 2002, but there wasn't a lot of 9-11 stuff in that one.

1066
01:04:56,000 --> 01:05:05,000
But in 2000, that was the one where Vince is backstage with Lorne, big show, Triple H, Foley and the audience coming down.

1067
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
They jumped down from the bleachers and it's the best.

1068
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:14,000
And just in the sleaziest leather jackets, the grungiest looking hair. And it's just like, oh yeah, wow, wow, wow.

1069
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:17,000
Vince did a really good live from...

1070
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:22,000
And you know he can't let people down. He's got to do that great.

1071
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:28,000
He might be one of the best ever. Just how much did he bring to that phrase that's been said so many times?

1072
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,000
Yeah.

1073
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
Vince and Lorne together.

1074
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:36,000
Yeah, I know, just that. I want to see them again. He's got to come back.

1075
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:39,000
Oh yeah, I'd like to see several episodes.

1076
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:46,000
Lorne is like playing along with the character. He's like, your men better behave themselves, McMahon.

1077
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:50,000
Your boys. Your boys aren't going to... It's so good.

1078
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:51,000
It's great.

1079
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:57,000
Written by Tommy Blacha, my showrunner.

1080
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:58,000
Oh yeah.

1081
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:06,000
Because he was a wrestling writer, so he did the like, stitched together the story with the... And let's make it comedy as well.

1082
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:07,000
Wow.

1083
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:08,000
That's great.

1084
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:21,000
Also, with Moonbeam City, so much of I loved Implosions that in season two of Moonbeam City, there was going to be an episode that all took place during a live Implosion special being covered on the local news.

1085
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:31,000
So yeah, this has been a long running... I was going to use all the cams. Like, can we like... And like all the scenes happen via balcony cams, hallway cams, all that shit.

1086
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:37,000
If only. We would have had fun. Until the show, until the Comedy Central imploded the show.

1087
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:40,000
Without warning.

1088
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:43,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, we didn't have time to get out.

1089
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:44,000
Yeah.

1090
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:59,000
The Aladdin in 1998. I don't have a lot about this one. It's just another solid... Like, the news crew again, they are just firing on all cylinders. They're so great.

1091
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:09,000
The blast cam is back. They're going to try to kill it again, but it doesn't die. Never does. It's becoming a family at this point. They have 22 cameras to cover.

1092
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:21,000
And that keeps... We have all the angles and the angles you're only going to see on News 13. Like, I think they really had to muscle out. Maybe they were still working with the mafia.

1093
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:26,000
Like, we got to make sure no other news station is anywhere close. They get one camera tops.

1094
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:31,000
Yeah. It's... Aladdin is fine. It's a fine implosion.

1095
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:39,000
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's a great special. I recommend all the specials and we'll post clips of all this stuff.

1096
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:52,000
We can make it over to the first one, but I want to name check a couple other. Because as I said, like, if movies can be involved in implosions, now we're really tied. This is the best that these things can be.

1097
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:56,000
Did you guys find anything about the lethal weapon implosion?

1098
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:57,000
No.

1099
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:58,000
Oh, wow.

1100
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:11,000
Never heard about this. Number of good implosions in Orlando. Amway Arena blew up and that's just like, that's so much there to like cave in on it. So that's a really cool one to watch.

1101
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:26,000
But they blew up a city hall and what happened was they started building the new city hall behind the old city hall and like, like feed away, like as close as a house is to its next door neighbor.

1102
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:37,000
So and I don't think they necessarily, it's not that they didn't have a plan. It was like, this has to be the most top of the line implosion or else like the mayor is going to be in trouble.

1103
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:45,000
The mayor is like, if there's any debris and I mess up both buildings and we have nowhere to work, we spent all this money on it. I'm screwed.

1104
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:55,000
So they didn't have the money to do the implosion right? And they started realizing what if we had, what if we auction off the rights to a movie? Could we sell the movie rights to an implosion?

1105
01:08:55,000 --> 01:09:07,000
And they reached out to Joel Silver, Hollywood mega producer Joel Silver, who ended up paying $50,000 to use this implosion in lethal weapon three.

1106
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:14,000
And and there's great footage you can watch of this of they don't run out before the actual building implodes.

1107
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:21,000
There's kind of like a pre step or they do like fire off a bunch of explosions as they're running out and then they went and did the real thing.

1108
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:28,000
But Mel Gibson and Danny Glover went down to do it. So they run out of a building that's going to be imploded real soon.

1109
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:34,000
And then the mayor of Orlando was awarded with a rewarded with a movie role. He's in the movie.

1110
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:43,000
He has one line and I'll tell you it it blows all of fucking Garcetti's cameos out of the water.

1111
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:51,000
That's a that's a movie cameo that you earned by engineering a great masterpiece of implosion.

1112
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:55,000
So that that's all really cool. That's a good one.

1113
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:59,000
And then you got to bring up the Dark Knight.

1114
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:04,000
Dark Knight was a great movie implosion where it was a candy factory.

1115
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:10,000
It was an abandoned candy factory. The Brock's the Brock's administration building.

1116
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:13,000
Oh, it wasn't a factory. It was just where they worked.

1117
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:19,000
I'm actually not sure if they actually did any fact. I just know that it was called where I have it here.

1118
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:22,000
Yeah, it's sorry. Sorry.

1119
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:25,000
I'm looking through. Yeah, Brock's. Can you spell that?

1120
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:32,000
They call they say Brock's candy. B R A C C H. Isn't that a brax? Is it Brock's?

1121
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:37,000
I don't know. I figured this would come up. Right. Yeah. Yeah.

1122
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:40,000
I believe it's Brock's. That's all I've always. I mean, I could be wrong.

1123
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:45,000
Well, they make a quality product. It's called. Yeah, it's called Brock's administration building.

1124
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:49,000
But I think it might be also the factory. OK.

1125
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:55,000
But they dressed it as Gotham Hospital and the Joker blows it up.

1126
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:58,000
And that's funny. That's another one. You know what I love in all of these things?

1127
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:03,000
I mean, this is true with a lot of stuff in Dark Knight where you know it's going to look cool in the movie.

1128
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:10,000
But when people just go film it from wherever vantage point they can get to and it looks cool before it's even in a movie,

1129
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:16,000
you know, it's going to be a great scene. That that sequence is so awesome.

1130
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:22,000
I mean, of course, I love it because I'm an edge lord, but for us and he's your guy, your guys in the scene.

1131
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:26,000
Yeah, yeah. All the jokers are my guys. That's right.

1132
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:31,000
You have that. You have one of those T-shirts where they're all playing poker, you know. Yeah. Yeah.

1133
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:37,000
Yeah. I have a number. They all have. I have different ones where they're all in different positions like. Yeah.

1134
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:43,000
Who is winning? Who didn't get to sit because it was too crowded.

1135
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:51,000
Yeah, it's really good. The Dark Knight is so good and is is stupid that there's so much garbage culture around that movie.

1136
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:54,000
Doesn't it feel lame to say you like the Dark Knight now?

1137
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:59,000
Well, it happens with all the things that are end up being like cultural phenomenon.

1138
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:05,000
Nominance. So, yeah, I hear. I mean, yeah, there's plenty of stuff where you go.

1139
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:10,000
It feels lame to like this now, but it is good. And Dark Knight certainly falls into that category.

1140
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:16,000
Why so serious? That feels like now it's just on like shirts at the boardwalk.

1141
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:19,000
Yeah, but I mean, the performance on its own.

1142
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:26,000
I mean, some of the surveillance storyline stuff with the cell phones making the radar like that is such a thing of its time.

1143
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:30,000
But it's like, yeah, you kind of you can't beat Christian Bale or Christian Bale.

1144
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:34,000
He's a ledger. I like Christian Nolan.

1145
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:37,000
There's some Nolan. There's some Nolan bullshit in those movies.

1146
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:43,000
But ultimately, you just say you want to see him kill that guy with a pencil. Yeah. Yeah. That's cool.

1147
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:58,000
And so good. And also really tying it together, the finale of that movie and the Joker hanging from the side of the that is filmed in Chicago in an under the opposite, an under construction Trump Tower.

1148
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:02,000
They were still. Yeah, that's a Trump building. I forgot about that.

1149
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:15,000
The they call the the Brock's administration implosion, the implosion slash explosion because it does have exterior blasts as well to make it more spectacular.

1150
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:19,000
Yeah. And then it's a little CGI a fight in the mood like they add.

1151
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:23,000
If they add some extra extra oomph to the explosion.

1152
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:27,000
So is it a true implosion? I think maybe it's both. It's half and half.

1153
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:30,000
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Little mix.

1154
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:37,000
Do we miss any other good ones before we take it to the high seas?

1155
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:42,000
Yeah, I mean, well, that one that one is is such a behemoth.

1156
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:47,000
And that one I was watching, I felt very silly. I was like the one we're about to talk about.

1157
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:51,000
I was like, man, this looks cinematic. Were those fireballs?

1158
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:59,000
And there was good reason because it was purposely cinematic because they used it in a movie, TV.

1159
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:10,000
Yeah, yes. And I this must be why any of this came up before, because the big one, the one that started it all, the dunes in 1993.

1160
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:16,000
And this, I believe, is one of the greatest events in the history of mankind.

1161
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:24,000
I think this rules so much because this so it's the site where they were going to build the Bellagio.

1162
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:29,000
And right next door to that is the newly opened Treasure Island.

1163
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:34,000
I found out that it opened on the day that the implosion happens.

1164
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:45,000
This is the first day ever of operation of Treasure Island and Treasure Island, I think, still does this pirate show outside with a big pirate ship.

1165
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:55,000
And if you're going to have an implosion, why not tie it all together and have the pirates blow up the building with a cannon?

1166
01:14:55,000 --> 01:15:08,000
I remember I remember the room I was in when my dad with something of this was on TV and my dad explaining to me, oh, yeah, they did this thing where the pirates blew up the casino.

1167
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:14,000
And I was just never stopped thinking about I thought that was the coolest thing I'd ever heard.

1168
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
I think I was eight at the time.

1169
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:19,000
And it's never the feeling is not diminished.

1170
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:24,000
I wouldn't say so. No, I'm still just as excited about it.

1171
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:31,000
It rules. It's so great to talk about some of what Jason was saying.

1172
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:32,000
This is like really the big one.

1173
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:37,000
I think I didn't know any of the context of this where the dunes was a super mafia hotel.

1174
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:46,000
So blowing up the dunes is completely we're saying goodbye to that era and to the end of mafia control of Las Vegas.

1175
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:52,000
It's the end of an era and to help celebrate it, pirates are there.

1176
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:56,000
No, goodbye, mafia. Hello, pirates.

1177
01:15:56,000 --> 01:16:01,000
The pirates are commanded to buy sea wood.

1178
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
I have the clip.

1179
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:04,000
Please do.

1180
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:05,000
The clip is so good.

1181
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:06,000
Please.

1182
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:07,000
All right.

1183
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
And here's Mr.

1184
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:17,000
When the captain of the Britannia, are you ready, sir?

1185
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:18,000
Prepare.

1186
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
Ready.

1187
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
Fire.

1188
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:23,000
Fire.

1189
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:29,000
And then they're just watching the listener can't see this.

1190
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:32,000
But holy shit, this is it's fireballs.

1191
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
They don't need to do any of this.

1192
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:35,000
Yes.

1193
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:38,000
None of this is helping the building.

1194
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:39,000
Exterior fire.

1195
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:42,000
The sign is lit up.

1196
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
It says no vacancy.

1197
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:45,000
All right.

1198
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:46,000
Oh, good detail.

1199
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:47,000
Yeah.

1200
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:48,000
The sign.

1201
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:49,000
They blow up the sign.

1202
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:50,000
They blow up the sign.

1203
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:54,000
And then just a massive fireball.

1204
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:58,000
And then it's just on fire for a while before it goes down.

1205
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:01,000
Oh, my God.

1206
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:02,000
It looks like hell.

1207
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:06,000
It looks like hell has opened up and swallows the building whole.

1208
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:13,000
It is so scary looking because of the fact that it's on fire and then it falls down.

1209
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:20,000
I mean, it has to be so much worse for the air than even a normal implosion to do all that.

1210
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:21,000
Yeah.

1211
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:24,000
I think to me, that is some of the joy of these things in general.

1212
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:30,000
When you think about other scenarios where buildings collapse, I mean, there's just there's

1213
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
you really think of a big one.

1214
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:33,000
Obviously, September 11th.

1215
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:34,000
Horrible, horrible.

1216
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
We're all scarred from it forever.

1217
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:41,000
So, like the idea of that, like, oh, my God, that building is on fire and then you watch it fall.

1218
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
Like, what gives you a pit in your stomach?

1219
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:44,000
What's scarier than that?

1220
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:50,000
So, to have all these things where we did it on purpose and pirates did it and it's fun

1221
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:56,000
and we're harnessing this power for good and for change and kids are going to laugh about it

1222
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
and people are going to tailgate with it.

1223
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:04,000
It's so silly to me, like making a building falling down the funnest thing ever.

1224
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:05,000
Yeah.

1225
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:06,000
That's what Jane was like.

1226
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:07,000
Isn't it weird?

1227
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:11,000
They made these exploding buildings into entertainment and I'm like, yeah, 100%.

1228
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:12,000
It's weird.

1229
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:13,000
But casinos are weird.

1230
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:22,000
It's like luxury, like nice hotel rooms, spas, fine dining next to gamble and next to abject

1231
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
human misery.

1232
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:27,000
Just so much money changing hands.

1233
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:31,000
Like, and just people leaving fortunes up to fate.

1234
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:32,000
It's absurd.

1235
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:37,000
We should blow up a monument every year on like 4th of July.

1236
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:41,000
We should just blow up the Statue of Liberty or the Washington Monument.

1237
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
I think that would be so exciting.

1238
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:51,000
It's fun to see big things as long as it's obviously not in some horrible, as long as people aren't dying.

1239
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:57,000
It is fun and it's strange to see something so large blow up.

1240
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:00,000
We haven't talked about like the Disney context of that.

1241
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:05,000
Like, would you, if there was like an idea to, we're going to build Cinderella's castle bigger and better,

1242
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:14,000
and then we're going to blow up the current Cinderella castle, would you like that or would that be bizarre and like scary?

1243
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:20,000
Well, we've talked about dystopian Disneyland and Disney World seems very scary.

1244
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:28,000
There's, if you could find those videos of the knockoff theme parks overseas that are abandoned and you can get a taste of what it would be like.

1245
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:32,000
And it is like, it is a nightmare.

1246
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:33,000
It is a huge nightmare.

1247
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:39,000
So I imagine if seeing like one of the castles implode would be a little traumatizing.

1248
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:40,000
I would, I would guess.

1249
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:41,000
Yeah.

1250
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:44,000
But if they made it fun and Mickey detonated it.

1251
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:48,000
Or like Goofy sat on the wrong lever or something.

1252
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:49,000
Oh, that's good.

1253
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:50,000
You can screw it up.

1254
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:57,000
Now they do, you know what they do in that, in that Hogwarts show they had been doing.

1255
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:02,000
They do have projection to make Hogwarts castle fall apart, which is cool.

1256
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:03,000
Oh yeah.

1257
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:04,000
That's true.

1258
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
So like you can see it gets like pieces fall off.

1259
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:07,000
It's exposed.

1260
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:08,000
You can see inside of it.

1261
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:12,000
And then obviously they fix it or Dumbledore fixes it at the end.

1262
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:17,000
So you could do like a cute version like that as opposed to actually putting dynamite into

1263
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:18,000
Sleeping Beauty's castle.

1264
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
I'll tell you what they should have blown up.

1265
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:23,000
They should have blown up the not that it's good.

1266
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:32,000
I mean, it's sad that it closed, but horizons, the closure of horizons was so painfully stretched out and anticlimactic.

1267
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:41,000
But if every, if they had been like the future begins January 1st, 2000 and it blown up that build it like

1268
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:46,000
That is sad, but also kind of awesome.

1269
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:50,000
Robot butler's head lands in somebody's lap.

1270
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:51,000
Yes.

1271
01:20:51,000 --> 01:21:03,000
I should say Scott, because you mentioned the yeah, treasure island was newly opened and that was a real new Vegas conquering old Vegas with the dunes being exploded.

1272
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:14,000
I know the strip was less built up at the time, but if you look at a map of the strip, you can see that they're not exactly close.

1273
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
Here's treasure island.

1274
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:22,000
And then here is the Bellagio and there is Caesar's palace in between.

1275
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
Oh, I thought they were next door.

1276
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:25,000
I thought that's why it happened.

1277
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:26,000
Wow.

1278
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:27,000
That's yeah, that's nowhere close.

1279
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:28,000
That's a lot in between.

1280
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:32,000
And I think, well, I, I, the, the ownership is, I think it is.

1281
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:44,000
Like, because when sold off the Mirage casinos to before he well before he built the win in the encore, he sold off the Mirage and treasure, not treasure island.

1282
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
Or did he sell off treasure island?

1283
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:52,000
Treasure island, I don't think it's part of MGM now, but he sold off a grip of them to MGM.

1284
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:53,000
Resort.

1285
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
Which I believe the Mirage owns now.

1286
01:21:55,000 --> 01:22:01,000
And that's how you end up with like monorails connecting a lot of just the ones that are in the back.

1287
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,000
Oh, just the ones that are in that system.

1288
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:11,000
That map you were just showing also right next to that is the fashion show mall, which had a dive restaurant, the submarine restaurant.

1289
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:15,000
The submarine restaurant was right next to the pirate show.

1290
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
This is just such a good time.

1291
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:23,000
It all makes me wish I grew up in Las Vegas, although maybe not because maybe there's weirdness to that too.

1292
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:29,000
But I, or I just that I'd visited, you know, several times a year.

1293
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:38,000
You would be like the guy who you wouldn't have a this career you would have be the guy who controls Blue's mouth at the Copperfield show.

1294
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:41,000
And I pick which Rob Paulson clips to play.

1295
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:44,000
Well, David will scream at you after each show.

1296
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:47,000
But yes, you can make one error.

1297
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,000
Yeah, right.

1298
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:56,000
But I get but at least I get to like walk around with like my children from a book, a bunch of marriages.

1299
01:22:56,000 --> 01:23:02,000
And I get them all together and say like there used to be a submarine in there and they'll say, shut up.

1300
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:05,000
Take us to that one little lettuce drink.

1301
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,000
But you're twelve.

1302
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,000
Shut up.

1303
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:10,000
I'm part of shut up.

1304
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
Did you not get dad?

1305
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
I mean, I don't know.

1306
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
There's probably some joy in that life.

1307
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:17,000
I think so.

1308
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:25,000
I believe suburban, you know, Vegas Vegas, suburban Vegas, one of the most quickest expanding residential areas in the world.

1309
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,000
Yeah, that's what I understand.

1310
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
Yeah, because I think it's affordable to live.

1311
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,000
There's no income tax.

1312
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
There's some something like that.

1313
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:37,000
So what Jason is saying, Scott, is it's not too late.

1314
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:38,000
It's not too late.

1315
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:39,000
Yeah.

1316
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:40,000
Yeah.

1317
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:43,000
And then you just have to deal with that for a while every year.

1318
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:46,000
It is one hundred and fifty degrees.

1319
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:47,000
That's right.

1320
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
As long as you can make it through that part.

1321
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:54,000
But you can go to like the rehab pool party on Sunday.

1322
01:23:54,000 --> 01:24:01,000
On Sundays and listen to loud music and be with a bunch of people and then you can cool off and you can hit up.

1323
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,000
I'm realizing in this version.

1324
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:04,000
What's that?

1325
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:08,000
Well, you can add up the locals casinos like Sam's town.

1326
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:21,000
Well, that's what I'm what I'm realizing is I think in this version, like this version of Scott ends up I'm acting in the movie Billy Toppet alongside Lance Burton.

1327
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:27,000
I have I have dyed hair for some reason, even though I'm not gray yet, I still just go overboard.

1328
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,000
I have jet black hair.

1329
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:34,000
I'm considered the young gun of the magician crew at 32.

1330
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
I'm the youngest person they know.

1331
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:41,000
You are padlocking him into the desperado track.

1332
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:42,000
Into the wait.

1333
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:43,000
The roller coaster.

1334
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:44,000
You are padlocking him.

1335
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
Oh, and he's strapped to the roller coaster.

1336
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:47,000
Right.

1337
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:52,000
So I'm Lance Burton's assistant in this world.

1338
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:53,000
I've been married four times.

1339
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:54,000
Yeah.

1340
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
He keeps saying like, well, I'll give you an opening spot.

1341
01:24:56,000 --> 01:25:00,000
I'll give you an opening spot and just string in your ass at log.

1342
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:05,000
Lance says one day now I know Lance isn't playing anywhere right now.

1343
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:06,000
They've blown up.

1344
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:09,000
They've imploded several of the places where he did residencies.

1345
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:13,000
But if he finds another one, I could be hitting up Sam's land.

1346
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:14,000
What was the one?

1347
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:15,000
Sam's town.

1348
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,000
The one that the killer's album was named after.

1349
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:18,000
Yeah, that's right.

1350
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:22,000
And then like tape face comes to town and Scott gets so mad because he like,

1351
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:25,000
he was up for that slot and tape face got it.

1352
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,000
I didn't get blue man.

1353
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,000
I didn't get puppetry of the penis.

1354
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,000
They aren't letting me in anything.

1355
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,000
Tony and Tina's wedding.

1356
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:34,000
Yeah.

1357
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
Couldn't even get a slot.

1358
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:39,000
I passed that audition with flying colors.

1359
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:44,000
Couldn't even get a slot at the dollar hot dog one at the best Western with the

1360
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:48,000
casino with the cheapest with $5 blackjack buy in.

1361
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:53,000
Scott can't even get a dish watching job at twin peaks.

1362
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:54,000
So sad.

1363
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
You can't climb the rock wall at all.

1364
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:59,000
That's the so you want to wash dishes here, huh?

1365
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,000
Why don't you try climbing that wall?

1366
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:02,000
I got it.

1367
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
No problem.

1368
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:07,000
Oh man, I fell off.

1369
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:12,000
I fell off three feet in and all my children laughed at me.

1370
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:18,000
The okay, so we're missing one big component of this.

1371
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:23,000
So the the the pirates of Buccaneer Bay and we'll we will cover all this someday

1372
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:24,000
down the line.

1373
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
I just love that this thing happens.

1374
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:31,000
They shooting a cannon at a I like thinking that that happened that like a

1375
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:35,000
cannon fires one ball and then an entire building goes down.

1376
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:36,000
It's like the death.

1377
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:37,000
So we lit on fire.

1378
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:38,000
Oh, yeah.

1379
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:44,000
You know, a ragtag group, an unlikely group, right, brings down the great

1380
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:45,000
evil.

1381
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,000
And this is cool.

1382
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:48,000
It's cool.

1383
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:49,000
It's cool to watch it on the news.

1384
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:50,000
I love that it happened.

1385
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:54,000
But then what I didn't know until a couple of years ago, and I think a fan of the

1386
01:26:54,000 --> 01:27:00,000
show mentioned this, that this was all filmed for a movie for a feature film for

1387
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
the now classic Treasure Island.

1388
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
The adventure begins.

1389
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:12,000
They film starring Steve Wynn as Steve Wynn that aired on NBC and then just was

1390
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:16,000
shown in the Treasure Island Hotel on a loop all day every day.

1391
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:17,000
Yeah.

1392
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:20,000
And that's we can't we'll get to it.

1393
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:21,000
Yeah.

1394
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:22,000
Yes.

1395
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:23,000
This it is.

1396
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:24,000
It is.

1397
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:25,000
It is as wild as it sounds.

1398
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,000
It's as weird as it sounds.

1399
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,000
It's I don't know.

1400
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:30,000
There's more.

1401
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:31,000
There's more.

1402
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:35,000
There's definitely some big movies made as marketing devices.

1403
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:42,000
But this one, like a movie to commemorate the opening of a new casino that aired on

1404
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:45,000
TV, it's like 45 minutes long without commercials.

1405
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:48,000
So with commercials, I guess it's probably like 90 minutes.

1406
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:49,000
It's like prime time.

1407
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:50,000
It was.

1408
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:51,000
It was prime time.

1409
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:55,000
And I found out a little bit about the airing of it from a newspaper article.

1410
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,000
It was in like the Washington Post.

1411
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,000
It was like, what the fuck was this?

1412
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:02,000
This is the worst thing I've ever seen on TV.

1413
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
And it turned it was aired.

1414
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:05,000
Yeah.

1415
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:08,000
In prime time, it was one of the lowest rated things of the week easily.

1416
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:14,000
And the person who greenlit it and said, yeah, let's do it, was an NBC executive

1417
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:19,000
named Don Ohlmeyer, perhaps best known for firing Norm McDonald from Weekend

1418
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:24,000
Update, one of the great boneheads in executive history.

1419
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:30,000
Good personal friend of OJ Simpson, fire of Norm McDonald and green lighter of

1420
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:31,000
Treasure Island.

1421
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:32,000
The adventure begins.

1422
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:36,000
We need to get there.

1423
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:40,000
He's on some specials from SNL specials, but I would love to really know exactly

1424
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:41,000
the making of this.

1425
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:43,000
This is more interesting.

1426
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:44,000
I want to know everything.

1427
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:45,000
Yeah.

1428
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:49,000
And when you think about the coordination, because I mean, in general, anything that's

1429
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:53,000
like we're filming this for multiple different things, but I just love that.

1430
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:58,000
So what we just saw where Steve Wynn says, captain of the Britannia, then right after

1431
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:05,000
this, he had to move positions and go like arm and arm with a fake family with an actor

1432
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:08,000
family, because that's how you see it in the movie.

1433
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:15,000
The camera swoops up behind them and he's like you do how you go on a vacation with

1434
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:19,000
your family and then end up with the owner of the casino, like hugging him.

1435
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:23,000
They're all arm and arm watching the beautiful implosion again.

1436
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:26,000
I believe the kid was like he was in the building.

1437
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:27,000
Yes.

1438
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:31,000
Blackbeard or something with a count with pirates with a countdown going because, you

1439
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:34,000
know, the family has just come to Vegas to see all that the Treasure Island, you know,

1440
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:38,000
the brand new Treasure Island casino has to offer, you know, the amenities, all the cool

1441
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:41,000
features and so many stores.

1442
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:46,000
Mom loves those, you know, as in 90 percent of movies in the 90s.

1443
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:51,000
Everyday life gets a little bit more interesting when you get scooped up into the arms of

1444
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:54,000
Lady Adventure, you know.

1445
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,000
I do know.

1446
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,000
That's Robert McKee.

1447
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:02,000
So make sure that your story has Lady Adventure in it.

1448
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:03,000
Yes.

1449
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:06,000
Answer Lady Adventure's call by the end of the first act.

1450
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:07,000
Are you stuck?

1451
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:10,000
Thrust your characters into the arms of Lady Adventure.

1452
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:11,000
Lady Adventure.

1453
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:15,000
You know, it's not enough to just have dinosaurs back in Central Park.

1454
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:17,000
You know, you have to have more.

1455
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:20,000
Of course.

1456
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:23,000
Yeah. Wait, did he write We're Back a Dinosaur story?

1457
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:27,000
No, I was just thinking what is the most 90s movie besides this movie?

1458
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:30,000
What else is very 90s and we're back.

1459
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:31,000
Yeah.

1460
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:36,000
I was just hoping like because I like I love when there's some like snooty screenwriter

1461
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:41,000
guy and then what's the credit like how there's a book called Screenwriting for Dummies and

1462
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:46,000
it's written by the guy who wrote the movie Miss Castaway, which is a parody of Miss

1463
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:49,000
Congeniality and Castaway starring Michael Jackson.

1464
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:50,000
Mm hmm.

1465
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
Ah, yeah, you know that.

1466
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
I'm not saying I'm not saying he doesn't know.

1467
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:55,000
Maybe he's good.

1468
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:56,000
He's never got anything made.

1469
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:59,000
I'm not saying this isn't about him what I'm about to say, but it's almost as if you

1470
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:03,000
could teach classes on things and not be very good at them.

1471
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,000
I bet can't be true.

1472
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:10,000
There's a program that I've I've paid for many of these.

1473
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:15,000
There's a program called Master Class and all of those are with the top, very top person

1474
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:16,000
in their field.

1475
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:21,000
Any number of people on the flight logs of those master classes.

1476
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:26,000
They shot them on Little St. James from what I understand.

1477
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,000
There's a studio there.

1478
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:30,000
Oh, that's where the class is.

1479
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:31,000
Yeah.

1480
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:38,000
I am listening to the audio book of David Lynch's memoir and he was in the first like

1481
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:44,000
graduating class or first class of like fellows at AFI and offhandedly they mentioned one

1482
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:50,000
of the faculty members who taught like Lynch and Terrence Malick and stuff had a screenwriting

1483
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:53,000
technique and I wrote it down because I forget what it's called.

1484
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,000
I don't have the paper in front of me.

1485
01:31:55,000 --> 01:32:01,000
That involves writing down 70 elements of a screen of let's story onto index cards and

1486
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:05,000
then you turn that into a screenplay and I'm like I have never heard of this technique

1487
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:06,000
before.

1488
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:09,000
I have to know everything about this 70 items.

1489
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:11,000
70 items.

1490
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,000
I don't know anything about the 70 items.

1491
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:18,000
And then but unless one of them is Lady Adventure and then it's not going to work.

1492
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:23,000
I'm really enjoying the book but I did get very excited for show reasons because they

1493
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:28,000
said and then Lynch was able to get with Mel Brooks attached as producer.

1494
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:32,000
The elephant man was picked up by Paramount where Michael Eisner and Jeffrey Katzenberg

1495
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:35,000
were running the studio and I was like and.

1496
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:36,000
Yes.

1497
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:41,000
Mel it seemed like the long and short of it was Mel Brooks ran was so confident in him

1498
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:45,000
and ran so much interference he didn't have a lot of notes from the studio and the outfit

1499
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:50,000
man was nominated for eight Oscars but I was like oh my god is this about to be a Katzenberg

1500
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:54,000
Eisner thing and like no it just had happy ending that the movie did very well and put

1501
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:55,000
him on the map.

1502
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:56,000
Okay.

1503
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:57,000
Oh man.

1504
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:58,000
Almost.

1505
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:01,000
And no ride ever made out of the elephant man.

1506
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:06,000
No no heartwarming tale of a Victorian doctor.

1507
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:07,000
If only.

1508
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:08,000
Yeah.

1509
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:09,000
I mean yeah.

1510
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:14,000
Trails Around the Adventures begins a an amazing film one of the great films from the

1511
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
director of Totally Mini by the way.

1512
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:17,000
So we got a.

1513
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:18,000
Wow.

1514
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:19,000
We'll cover this.

1515
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:20,000
This is I'm excited to watch this.

1516
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:23,000
Probably his whole filmography we got to do.

1517
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:24,000
I don't know.

1518
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
I mean that taps me out in terms of what to say about the dunes.

1519
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:27,000
I just I love it.

1520
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:28,000
It's so cool.

1521
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:29,000
What a good idea.

1522
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:35,000
Steve Wynn is clearly a bad man but you know what a what a good idea.

1523
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:36,000
A bad man with a good idea.

1524
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:41,000
Him realizing he could coordinate all this and make pirates blow up a building.

1525
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:47,000
I would like boy we need something this cool to happen in this in this bad year in this

1526
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:51,000
bad stretch that would unite everybody if something this stupid happened.

1527
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:55,000
I was trying to think of like how you could top it and it's like is there a way like

1528
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:57,000
Godzilla versus Kong is coming out.

1529
01:33:57,000 --> 01:34:01,000
I guess you'd have to do CGI but I mean I guess you could do it if you map CGI over

1530
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:05,000
a building and make it look like maybe Godzilla had destroyed a building and it was a controlled

1531
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:08,000
demolition like something along these lines.

1532
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:12,000
I like it practical of course but I'm just trying to innovate in the space.

1533
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:18,000
I think there's a way to do it you know that can bring new excitement to watching a building

1534
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:19,000
fall down.

1535
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:20,000
Well.

1536
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:21,000
It's cool.

1537
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:25,000
What you do is you finally figure out the physics of the one of the best unbuilt Vegas

1538
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:31,000
attractions the full sized King Kong that you would ride in that was going to climb

1539
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:34,000
the stratosphere every day.

1540
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:35,000
What.

1541
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:36,000
Yeah.

1542
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:37,000
Whoa.

1543
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:38,000
Yeah.

1544
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:39,000
That one's news to me.

1545
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:41,000
I'll send you I'll send you a video.

1546
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:42,000
It's in the right.

1547
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:47,000
It's stratosphere Expedition theme park and it's like you would enter you would enter

1548
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:54,000
where on you would sit in his chest and it could go down the building.

1549
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:57,000
You know I was hoping you would climb into his urethra.

1550
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:59,000
I don't know how you enter.

1551
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:02,000
I don't maybe climb in the very spacious plenty of rooms.

1552
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:03,000
Yeah.

1553
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:04,000
Well where else.

1554
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:05,000
What other hole is there.

1555
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:06,000
It'd be.

1556
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:07,000
Than his butt.

1557
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:10,000
I mean that's why if it folded down a stairway up from his butt.

1558
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
But like I guess his anus.

1559
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:13,000
Yeah.

1560
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:14,000
Would be bigger.

1561
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
I think what kind of like giggles when you got in.

1562
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:17,000
Yeah.

1563
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:23,000
I think what happened was they found out this would be mechanically impossible to create

1564
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:26,000
and build to run every day.

1565
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
Oh that's quitter talk.

1566
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:29,000
Yeah.

1567
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:30,000
Yeah.

1568
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
Man that's so cool.

1569
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:33,000
Oh God.

1570
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,000
I want to know everything about that.

1571
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:36,000
I can't wait to watch that video.

1572
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:39,000
You know you should have gotten into he should have been wearing like a little barrel around

1573
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:43,000
his neck like a Saint Bernard saving people in like the Arctic.

1574
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:48,000
And then you got into the barrel and you could see there's like a window in the barrel.

1575
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:52,000
The post being inside here in his body.

1576
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:53,000
Yeah.

1577
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:54,000
It's like crazy.

1578
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:55,000
Yeah.

1579
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:57,000
Why does he have a weird like a window on his chest.

1580
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:58,000
Yeah.

1581
01:35:58,000 --> 01:35:59,000
Yeah.

1582
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:02,000
There's no real justification of a translucent part of your chest.

1583
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:03,000
No one should have that.

1584
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:04,000
Right.

1585
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:05,000
So we'll look into this more.

1586
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:08,000
I'm obsessed with the movie where King Kong gets a heart transplant.

1587
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:13,000
So if you were inside his mechanical heart which is shoved into his chest.

1588
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:14,000
Oh yeah.

1589
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:15,000
I would allow.

1590
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:17,000
You could help beat like make it beat.

1591
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:18,000
Oh yeah.

1592
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:19,000
Oh you have to like operate.

1593
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,000
You got to like pull levers and yeah.

1594
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:22,000
Pedal a bicycle.

1595
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:23,000
That's your keeping key.

1596
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:25,000
You're keeping King Kong alive.

1597
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:28,000
That would be the most stressful thing for me as a kid.

1598
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:30,000
He's going to die.

1599
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:31,000
My God.

1600
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:33,000
Dad you're not doing it.

1601
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:35,000
You're not doing it enough.

1602
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:36,000
You're killing him.

1603
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:37,000
Daddy.

1604
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:39,000
Blood is on your hands.

1605
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:43,000
Well if you want to kill the beast.

1606
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:48,000
If he wanted to be faithful you'd have to have him get to the top and then like a plane

1607
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:56,000
or a helicopter on a pole would have to come around shoot him and have him fall off the

1608
01:36:56,000 --> 01:37:00,000
stratosphere like a drop ride and that's how you get back to the ground.

1609
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:01,000
But then.

1610
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:02,000
Sure.

1611
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:06,000
That would be true to the films but then you would be getting off a dead King Kong.

1612
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
The greatest thing ever.

1613
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:11,000
Oh my God.

1614
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:13,000
I have any version of this.

1615
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:14,000
Yeah.

1616
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:15,000
And so bad.

1617
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:20,000
We just wind it down because we still haven't even talked about the one that just happened.

1618
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:21,000
Yes.

1619
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:26,000
And it says you know it's an unfair comparison to go from but maybe not unfair because this

1620
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
should have been cooler I think.

1621
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:34,000
To go from the best one the pirate one to the one that just happened Trump Plaza in Atlantic

1622
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:35,000
City.

1623
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:39,000
Jason I know both woke up to to watch it.

1624
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:44,000
Which was nice and fun but you know there were there wasn't the spectacle.

1625
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
It was a very good implosion.

1626
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:47,000
I'm not arguing that.

1627
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:48,000
Yes.

1628
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:54,000
Yeah this was I mean it was built in the mid 80s Trump Plaza.

1629
01:37:54,000 --> 01:38:01,000
They marketed it as Atlantic City centerpiece which is kind of a trick because they're trying

1630
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:08,000
to you know like centerpiece beautiful elegant luxurious in-ringed and it's a very cool

1631
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:13,000
luxurious in reality it is kind of smack in the center of the boardwalk.

1632
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:16,000
It's smack in the center of the of the city.

1633
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:26,000
So that is both literal and metaphorical the centerpiece thing and it it was sold like

1634
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:33,000
Trump ate it in Atlantic City in the 2000s Trump Plaza Trump Toshima Hall Trump Marina

1635
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:35,000
all closed.

1636
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:43,000
Carl I can the Raider capitalist bought it and just shut it down like he didn't redo

1637
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:50,000
it he didn't keep it going it was just empty for years and pieces started to fall off it

1638
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:54,000
onto the historical Atlantic City boardwalk.

1639
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:58,000
God did anyone get hurt by the building.

1640
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:04,000
I think people were OK but they're like we got to do something about this and should

1641
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:12,000
say this was this was the main tower of it is not the whole there's still pieces like

1642
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:19,000
for example the smaller building that the Rainforest Cafe that consistently survives

1643
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:23,000
the financial difficulties of Trump Plaza still going strong.

1644
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:29,000
They like sued their way into being able to still operate because I didn't understand

1645
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:33,000
the I was picturing like it's in the basement of a collapsing building.

1646
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:37,000
Why would you keep this going but now that I've seen now I've seen the geography and

1647
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:42,000
it's really removed it is next to that bad other building with like a like this like

1648
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:46,000
red triangle that's just been rusting away since Trump got out of there.

1649
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:51,000
But yeah it's very distant of course it could keep operating but it's it's close on one

1650
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:57,000
side to Caesar's Palace which is not as massive as the Vegas one but significantly large and

1651
01:39:57,000 --> 01:40:00,000
that's where a lot of the press watch the implosion.

1652
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:05,000
You could pay ten dollars to park and watch from your car in a safe distance away in a

1653
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:11,000
parking lot due to city ordinances that say all city events have to charge ten dollars

1654
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:13,000
for parking which I thought was very funny.

1655
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:20,000
The other side of Trump Plaza is the historic now called Boardwalk Hall which used to be

1656
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
called the Atlantic City Convention Center.

1657
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:28,000
And that was notable for holding the Miss America pageant for decades and decades.

1658
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:31,000
Where all the villains hung out.

1659
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:37,000
Yes and more and of course WrestleMania 4 and 5.

1660
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
Yes I believe that's right.

1661
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,000
Sponsored by Trump Plaza.

1662
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:46,000
So in the broadcast it's announced as coming to you from Trump Plaza.

1663
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:48,000
But it's not.

1664
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000
It's yet another one of those little lies.

1665
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:51,000
It's technically next door.

1666
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:52,000
Yes.

1667
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:53,000
Yes.

1668
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:54,000
That's right.

1669
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:59,000
So that is a historical landmark that they had to make sure was not damaged by a massive

1670
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:00,000
implosion.

1671
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:02,000
Oh that's right there.

1672
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:03,000
Yeah.

1673
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:08,000
That was also that I believe that that was the venue for I mean a couple of big boxing

1674
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:14,000
matches but Mike Tyson fight where this group hung out.

1675
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:15,000
Look at this photo.

1676
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:16,000
Let's go down the line.

1677
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:23,000
Nicholson, Beatty, Larry King, Donald Trump deep in conversation with or perhaps Paul

1678
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:32,000
Simon all at the same table and just off running around somewhere with his little growth to

1679
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:36,000
to gross toothy mouth is old Donald Trump Jr.

1680
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:43,000
Yeah it's what a what a array of idiots.

1681
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:45,000
I mean some of these people are cool.

1682
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:48,000
I like a couple of them but RIP Larry.

1683
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:51,000
But what a lineup like the history of this place.

1684
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:57,000
I also didn't just to throw in another Trump Plaza thing.

1685
01:41:57,000 --> 01:42:02,000
I didn't know that it whenever it opened up it opened up at 2 p.m.

1686
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:07,000
on a certain day and at 2 40 an alarm went off and the building had to be evacuated.

1687
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:11,000
So it survived 40 minutes of operation.

1688
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:16,000
And just the beginning of a long bizarre legacy.

1689
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:23,000
Yeah there's a crazy story about like a professional gambler who took them for a ride like who

1690
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:28,000
was just playing like he was just racking up the winds at Trump Plaza and they were

1691
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,000
like we got to do something about this guy.

1692
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:35,000
And it's so funny it happened early on because there was a lot of pop in circumstance when

1693
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:38,000
this this one opened it was pretty sizable.

1694
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:41,000
Again it's very centrally located.

1695
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:47,000
If you if you come in through one bridge of Atlantic City you pretty much go smack into

1696
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:54,000
like Caesars and Trump Plaza area and it was just a high sore for years and years and

1697
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,000
yes started crumbling.

1698
01:42:56,000 --> 01:43:00,000
So there I was to say Jason you have your personal relationship with this place at

1699
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
anything you have anything.

1700
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,000
I I don't have a lot.

1701
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
I've been to a lot of places.

1702
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:07,000
I don't have a lot.

1703
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:10,000
I've been to that rainforest cafe for sure.

1704
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:16,000
I know that we were more of a Caesars family because that's where Plan Hollywood was and

1705
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:17,000
we like to go there.

1706
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:19,000
What a place man.

1707
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:24,000
Occasionally we would check down to the Trump Taj Mahal which even as a preteen I knew I

1708
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:29,000
was like I don't know are you so this is uncomfortable.

1709
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:31,000
It was like gross right.

1710
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:35,000
Yeah it looks like shit like Donald Trump like the Golden Toilet.

1711
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:45,000
Like trying to replicate Indian design and culture and like a massive land world landmark.

1712
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:52,000
But with the Trump aesthetic and then you have to walk through this to get to the Hardrock

1713
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:55,000
Cafe on the word.

1714
01:43:55,000 --> 01:44:00,000
The Trump Taj Mahal was taken over by the Hardrock people.

1715
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:05,000
That is like the newest casino in the land city the Hardrock casino.

1716
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:06,000
And I didn't know.

1717
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:11,000
All right here comes just a big like here comes the Expendables.

1718
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:17,000
I didn't know the history of what started as Trump Castle one of the stupidest names ever

1719
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:23,000
then became Trump Marina and then it just you know languished for a while as all of them

1720
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:29,000
did and then it was almost bought by Hardrock then almost bought by Buffett almost made

1721
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:36,000
into a Margaritaville hotel but eventually finally turned into a Golden Nugget after

1722
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:44,000
it was bought by Landry's and our friend Mr. Boot in the Ass himself Tillman Fertitta.

1723
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:50,000
All of everybody every character from the show comes to play when it's implosion time.

1724
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:55,000
And that I have characters I've been to Trump Marina now Golden Nugget that is on the that

1725
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:57,000
is on the Bay that is by.

1726
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:58,000
That's removed.

1727
01:44:58,000 --> 01:44:59,000
Yeah that's removed.

1728
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:05,000
That's by the Borgata which is like the nicest casino which is an MGM casino.

1729
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:11,000
Steve Wynn tried to get a Le Jardin I think was called he tried to get a different project

1730
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:17,000
off the ground convinced the city to build like a road going to it and then backed out

1731
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:23,000
of it eventually MGM would come in and build the Borgata which is very nice.

1732
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:29,000
And then the Golden Nugget is kind of it is smaller but I think I ate at the the Chart

1733
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:34,000
House at the Golden Nugget and there's another there's a Landry's restaurant another land

1734
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:39,000
restaurant and there's like a an Italian place in there I ate there like right before we

1735
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:43,000
started doing the show or like right after we had started doing the show before we discovered

1736
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:45,000
all these characters.

1737
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:50,000
Wow knowing that we cared about Landry's yeah I think we found it all together.

1738
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:55,000
But I know you guys you've never been to Atlantic City of course right.

1739
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:57,000
No no I want to now.

1740
01:45:57,000 --> 01:46:01,000
I didn't I when I dropped off your Christmas gifts I dropped off some envelopes for you

1741
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:02,000
to open.

1742
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:03,000
Oh yes oh my god yeah.

1743
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:06,000
So there's been an envelope sitting in front of Mike and I this whole time.

1744
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:09,000
If you want to open it to give you the full experience.

1745
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:10,000
Oh boy.

1746
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:13,000
All right I'm gonna make I'm gonna let everyone hear it yeah yeah.

1747
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:15,000
This is binaural audio.

1748
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:16,000
Creepy.

1749
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,000
It's relaxing like ASMR.

1750
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:19,000
That's right.

1751
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:24,000
It you know I didn't want it to be the only remnant of the building to just be an eight

1752
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:30,000
story pile of rubble that it will take June to clear take until June to clear out.

1753
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:38,000
So I went digging and found there's a large market of casino detritus on eBay.

1754
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:45,000
Ah we got some the aforementioned what's the variety what do they call the cards.

1755
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:46,000
The cancel deck.

1756
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:49,000
Cancel deck we have a Trump plot.

1757
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:50,000
Oh my god.

1758
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:53,000
I mean Jason I this is so thoughtful thank you.

1759
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:56,000
Have you just put a curse on Scott and I's apartment.

1760
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:57,000
But no that's okay.

1761
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:59,000
I've got one too.

1762
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:01,000
Okay all three of us.

1763
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:03,000
Anything that says Trump in it.

1764
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:09,000
I you have Trump Plaza canceled decks and it came in a pack and I have one too.

1765
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:11,000
And and postcards.

1766
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:12,000
Mike.

1767
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:14,000
Wow it's an old school postcard too.

1768
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:21,000
Yeah and Mike your postcard I believe is just the you can just see the how gray much of Trump Plaza was.

1769
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:27,000
But Scott yours has the Trump Plaza and the Trump Taj Mahal in early 90s Photoshop.

1770
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:29,000
It's just laid on top of each other.

1771
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:36,000
Those buildings could not come together in an impossible way in an impossible way and those buildings could not be farther apart.

1772
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:38,000
So they are nowhere near each other.

1773
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:40,000
Wow.

1774
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:46,000
There's also an ad for a draping down the side for Cirque du Soleil show called Cirque Dreams Jungle Fantasy.

1775
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,000
That's DCA level fonts.

1776
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:49,000
Boy that is hideous.

1777
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:51,000
This is a really big elephant.

1778
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:53,000
This is just a terrible item.

1779
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:55,000
I'm very happy to have it.

1780
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:56,000
Yeah.

1781
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:58,000
Wow thank you Jason.

1782
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:02,000
Cursed objects for everyone.

1783
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:03,000
Yeah.

1784
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:04,000
Geez.

1785
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,000
Piece of history now.

1786
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:09,000
It's now ash as the news anchors would say.

1787
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:10,000
I.

1788
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:11,000
Yeah.

1789
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:13,000
This seems like a garbage place like this.

1790
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:15,000
This must have been a bummer to be in here.

1791
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:18,000
I'd imagine even when it was at its height.

1792
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:19,000
Yeah.

1793
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:26,000
Are you saying the guy whose name on the building maybe didn't pay any attention to something after he built it or take care of it or let it decay.

1794
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:28,000
Is that what you're insinuating.

1795
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:36,000
Wanted to make a big PR splash and then not really have to deal with any of the problems that happen.

1796
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:39,000
I have the stamina for anything.

1797
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:55,000
Well he did go out of his way to sue an old lady to get her out of her house because this is an up esc scenario where there's a woman who had like a three story building that's been that had been there since before the 50s and she had to go to the

1798
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:59,000
And Trump was trying to get this he was claiming was dilapidated and you look at it and like it's fine.

1799
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:01,000
It's like old but who cares.

1800
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:08,000
And he was trying to sue so that he could demolish it and build a parking lot for limousines.

1801
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:12,000
What an idiot.

1802
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:16,000
There's not one story about this man that isn't annoying.

1803
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:20,000
And then there's you can watch a lot of the stuff that's going on in the back of the car.

1804
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:23,000
There's a story about this man that isn't annoying.

1805
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:31,000
And then there's a you can watch an old news report where he's actually being challenged on this a little bit like well why you know she has the right to be there.

1806
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:48,000
You can't just have people come in and say you have to leave your and he's going on about like what Jason said there's a road there's a road that takes you right into the heart of Atlantic City and they drive in and they see this ugly buildings hideous building when they could instead be seeing a beautiful fountain or beautiful.

1807
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:51,000
Other things which would be good.

1808
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:55,000
This is a quote from the man who would be president.

1809
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:57,000
I don't believe it doesn't sound like him.

1810
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:59,000
Beautiful other things that would be good.

1811
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:01,000
Well, he's more.

1812
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:02,000
Yeah, he got way more.

1813
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:04,000
Yeah, well, I'll tell you.

1814
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:05,000
Orator.

1815
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:08,000
I went looking for this because it's headed unfortunately sold.

1816
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:10,000
I'll tell you what you see.

1817
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:13,000
You see a giant emblem.

1818
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:17,000
This Trump Plaza this ugly stamp like it's a fake.

1819
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:25,000
Royal stamp you would see a fake presidential seal now that he sent the tag letter on that's like a made up that's nothing.

1820
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:30,000
Yeah, you would see that three stories high on the side of this gray building.

1821
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:36,000
That said, I'm sure if you saw Liza the one and only I'm sure this residency was good because she was.

1822
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:41,000
I would love I would love to see Liza the one and only I've been in a big Liza phase lately.

1823
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,000
Very much love to also.

1824
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:54,000
I think listeners you will be heartened to know that a lot of the casino detritus online buttons postcards decks.

1825
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:55,000
Don't worry.

1826
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:59,000
The Trump stuff did not go up in value.

1827
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:02,000
It's good news.

1828
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:03,000
Good.

1829
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:11,000
Well, that's it's going to go way down when I go through every single one of these cards and on the four mentions of Trump Trump's name on each one.

1830
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:14,000
I put an asterisk instead of the you.

1831
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:16,000
Well, you know, show him.

1832
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:18,000
I understand why people are doing this.

1833
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:21,000
I don't even say I don't even say his name.

1834
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:24,000
I usually just say 45 and I think that's pretty cool.

1835
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:25,000
Good for you.

1836
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:26,000
You know what?

1837
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:27,000
Good for you.

1838
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:28,000
For me.

1839
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:38,000
This, you know, if you are looking for Trump revenge in some mild way, I mean, this is pretty great.

1840
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:48,000
Like if this is like if you're mad at him, then seeing like this this albatross of a bad hotel he built go down and smoke.

1841
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,000
It's pretty great.

1842
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:51,000
I don't you know, I mean, it's hollow.

1843
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:52,000
I don't know if he cares.

1844
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:58,000
Although maybe he probably was watching this live and grumbling at it.

1845
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:01,000
And, you know, we know he's up early.

1846
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:04,000
First of all, yeah, this guy doesn't sleep.

1847
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,000
So he probably did watch it and was mad.

1848
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:07,000
I shouldn't discount that.

1849
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:08,000
He's very petty.

1850
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:21,000
Not well liked in Atlantic City, not well liked by the hundreds, if not thousands who were employed at these casinos that all suddenly closed during the economic downturn.

1851
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:23,000
I should add or right afterwards.

1852
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:29,000
And Carl Icahn, of course, did not keep them employed or did not take care of them.

1853
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:32,000
I believe just canceled union contracts outright.

1854
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,000
Real shady stuff.

1855
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:38,000
I don't know how this all I'm not a smart person.

1856
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:48,000
But I is generally the story that he put his own personal debts onto the casinos, which made them fail.

1857
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:53,000
But his brand was able to like narrowly escape out of the rubble.

1858
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:58,000
Like Donald Trump never went bankrupt, but Trump, the organization did.

1859
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:01,000
So he technically could say I didn't go bankrupt.

1860
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:03,000
It's it's something like that.

1861
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:04,000
Like he put too much.

1862
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,000
He made the casinos fail, basically.

1863
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,000
I believe that's correct.

1864
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:13,000
Yeah, it's that thing where it's like people buy debt and somehow make money.

1865
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:17,000
And like I don't I for one don't understand it, but it seems insane.

1866
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:19,000
Shell shell game, big shell game.

1867
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:20,000
Yeah.

1868
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:22,000
No one suffers any consequences for anything.

1869
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:24,000
They lose 400 million dollars.

1870
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:25,000
It doesn't matter.

1871
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:26,000
But I don't care.

1872
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:28,000
I remember meeting a waiter.

1873
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:29,000
I think I was at Harrah.

1874
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:34,000
I think I was at the Guy Fieri steakhouse at Harrah and just hearing this like it is a company town.

1875
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:37,000
It's like an entertainment town like Orlando or Vega.

1876
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:39,000
And he had just worked.

1877
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:40,000
Oh, I was a cater waiter.

1878
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:41,000
I was a room service waiter.

1879
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:53,000
It's just all over the island at all the different casinos and like really hit hard when like a third of the casinos closed and the Trump ones kind of were around then or followed then.

1880
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:59,000
Was he had so many that he would be if all of those go down and every like the whole thing.

1881
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:04,000
And oh my God, he had all his other like failed shit.

1882
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:13,000
I didn't know any of this that he he owned the pier at one point in time and he let's keep bringing in things we like.

1883
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:19,000
There was a point in time where he claimed he'd made a deal with Six Flags and that they were going to do a little mini Six Flags on the pier.

1884
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:23,000
Trump Six Flags over Trump Pier.

1885
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:25,000
I don't know if that was going to be the name, but maybe.

1886
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:29,000
And then he claimed Sega was going to do something and none of it happened.

1887
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:31,000
So yeah, casinos fail.

1888
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:33,000
Pier project still is.

1889
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:35,000
It's not really anything there, right?

1890
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:37,000
Well, anything on the Six Flags.

1891
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:40,000
The Six Flags deal fell apart because he wanted all six to be Confederate flags.

1892
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:46,000
I believe that the pier in question, the one you can look out and look, you could stand on the third floor.

1893
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:50,000
It's a they turn it into an upscale mall.

1894
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,000
If we're talking about the same pier.

1895
01:54:53,000 --> 01:55:06,000
And you could stand on the third floor and look down at the Rainforest Cafe, which I believe I did explaining like, yeah, so Trump Plaza closed, but this Rainforest Cafe got a contract to get their own utility line so they could stay open.

1896
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:10,000
That is owned by Caesars.

1897
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:13,000
I think Caesars owned it, sold it.

1898
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:15,000
It was like a dirt mall for years.

1899
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:23,000
It was like a just a mall of like beach supplies and like newspapers, newspapers, cigarettes, books, paperback books, newspapers.

1900
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:27,000
And then eventually it tried to go upscale.

1901
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:29,000
It got a Apple Store.

1902
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:34,000
I believe that is the first it sugar in that location.

1903
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:36,000
Oh, that was the flagship.

1904
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:38,000
Yeah.

1905
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:40,000
So but it fell on hard times, too.

1906
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:48,000
They tried to turn it into like Pleasure Island, like a bunch of little bars with different themes and they'd all be fun.

1907
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:53,000
And I went the opening summer, my family went and we're like, no one's here.

1908
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:59,000
It's it's it's like 8 p.m. on a Thursday night in July.

1909
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:02,000
This place should be packed and no one was there.

1910
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:04,000
Man.

1911
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:05,000
Yikes. Tragic.

1912
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:06,000
Yeah.

1913
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:08,000
He just blew up the whole thing.

1914
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:15,000
And if it is considered the center of Atlantic City and the center goes down, then yeah, what do you what do you have?

1915
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:24,000
So it seems like to take this place out, it like I read that the mayor, the guy who is now the mayor made it one of his promises.

1916
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:30,000
We will implode this building, which just signifies because we could put so they don't know what they're putting there yet.

1917
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:37,000
But we can put something that serves as like a beacon for what will come in Atlantic City instead of this rotting.

1918
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:38,000
Yeah.

1919
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:40,000
Remember a thing from the past?

1920
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:48,000
He was I believe he was putting up like images on social media of like a movie poster for this Trump Plaza Plaza explosion.

1921
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:49,000
I like that.

1922
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:50,000
That's spectacle.

1923
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:52,000
And I could not find them.

1924
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:55,000
I'll try to locate see if we can locate them.

1925
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:59,000
But yeah, I mean, it's a resilience and it's had a lot of different transformations.

1926
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:07,000
Like my parents, my grandparents on my mom's side had their honeymoon in Atlantic City in the 40s when he was on leave from the war.

1927
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:21,000
And and so it's had a lot of transformations from like the Victorian seaside kind of town to the gambling comes in in the 70s and stuff and has its ups and downs and was on an upswing.

1928
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:23,000
That hard rock was a big deal.

1929
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:27,000
And then coronavirus, I'm sure, is not helping matters for the city.

1930
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:32,000
But yeah, can I propose let's build the Starship Enterprise there?

1931
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:38,000
But King Kong is sleeping on top of it.

1932
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:45,000
Oh, and you get to climb in his asshole and shockingly brazen for you, Mike.

1933
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:47,000
Mike, I love it.

1934
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:50,000
Hey, I said after 90 minutes on these, I get punchy.

1935
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:51,000
Yeah.

1936
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:59,000
You know what? Right past the end of the one end of the boardwalk, there is a huge plot of seaside land that would be perfect for it.

1937
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:05,000
You just got have to get it out of the hands of its owner, which checking my notes is Jared Kushner.

1938
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:07,000
OK, great.

1939
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:11,000
No, no, no.

1940
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:17,000
Here's the deal. I could sell Jared Kushner on people climbing into King Kong's asshole in 10 minutes.

1941
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:21,000
Give me 10 minutes with Kushner and I could sell him on this idea.

1942
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:25,000
Starship Enterprise, King Kong, put them together.

1943
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:28,000
Wait, so he's sleeping on it so you don't go into the enterprise.

1944
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:30,000
Maybe you can go into both.

1945
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:32,000
I can go into both.

1946
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:34,000
It's probably you have to walk.

1947
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:40,000
You have to get to the bridge on the Enterprise and then there's some way out the top of the Enterprise and that's where Kong is.

1948
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:43,000
You can slide out of his drool down into the cockpit.

1949
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:45,000
That's good too.

1950
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:47,000
I mean, there's multiple ways in, I think.

1951
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:49,000
You can go in his nostrils.

1952
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:51,000
You can go in his urethra.

1953
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:55,000
There's plenty of ways. Ears.

1954
01:58:55,000 --> 01:59:00,000
This is the future. This is where Atlantis, yeah, no more of this disgusting building.

1955
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:02,000
Let's put in something with class.

1956
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:09,000
Something with class and revisit a couple old ideas and we can freshen them both up and add them.

1957
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:11,000
That's what I think is good.

1958
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:13,000
This sounds great. This sounds really good.

1959
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:18,000
What do we think of the implosion in general?

1960
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:21,000
I think we're all agreed that we just don't...

1961
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:24,000
There wasn't even, I don't think, the news 13 level of...

1962
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:31,000
I woke up early thinking I'd find some news anchors having fun or maybe my old friends, Steve Krupke or whatever.

1963
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:34,000
It was just a bunch of silent cameras.

1964
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:35,000
Well, I found...

1965
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:36,000
It's back to basics.

1966
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:47,000
NBC 10, the Philadelphia affiliate, had a helicopter over the water, over the ocean, and they caught it from a certain angle.

1967
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:49,000
I think there's a roundup of that.

1968
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:51,000
I did catch the tail end of it.

1969
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:54,000
I was trying to video capture it and then the broadcast ended.

1970
01:59:54,000 --> 02:00:00,000
But there was one news anchor and I didn't get her exact wording, but what she said was something like,

1971
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:04,000
You know, I'm just a lay person, but that looked great.

1972
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:07,000
I like that. Yeah.

1973
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:09,000
And I agree. It was awesome.

1974
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:12,000
It kind of did this little swirl as it went down.

1975
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:15,000
It was very fast. It felt faster than any of these.

1976
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:17,000
They did an amazing job.

1977
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:18,000
Yeah.

1978
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:19,000
It's like back... Here's what I think.

1979
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:20,000
It's back to basics.

1980
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:27,000
It's like YouTube, beautiful day, back to what started this whole thing.

1981
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:29,000
And then now we can go forward to try it.

1982
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:31,000
YouTube's a bad comparison because they never went forward.

1983
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:33,000
They just kept trying to do the same thing.

1984
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:36,000
But back to basics, then we can sort of now innovate.

1985
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:40,000
So it's like it's a good fun thing to watch.

1986
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:43,000
But yes, after we're doing some research on these other ones, how can you even...

1987
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:46,000
How can you be satisfied after a pirate was involved?

1988
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:51,000
Yeah. I mean, they did it at 9.07 in the morning East Coast time.

1989
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:52,000
Yeah.

1990
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:55,000
Morning time, tougher for the West Coast.

1991
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:56,000
Yeah. But granted...

1992
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:57,000
With all of the...

1993
02:00:57,000 --> 02:00:59,000
It was 27 degrees outside.

1994
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:02,000
So I don't know if they could have gotten as much as the Vegas crowds,

1995
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:04,000
a more temperate climate Vegas.

1996
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:06,000
Right. Oof.

1997
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:11,000
You know, with so much Trump animosity also, you'd think that there would be like...

1998
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:14,000
They didn't want to make it political, but you can't help but feel that way.

1999
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:18,000
And it's a metaphor for the crumbling of the empire.

2000
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:22,000
Just as his building crumbles, so does his presidency.

2001
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:25,000
Cut to him winning in 2024 easily.

2002
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:27,000
We're all fucking under his thumb again.

2003
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:32,000
But I don't know. It did feel good in that moment.

2004
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:33,000
Like it is symbolic.

2005
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:38,000
So like what could they have done that would have been satisfying to like...

2006
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:42,000
To what we're all kind of feeling about him in the end of the run?

2007
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:45,000
Or just something cool that doesn't have anything to do with Donald Trump?

2008
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:51,000
Well, there's some real dark things I could think of that I don't even want to say out loud.

2009
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:53,000
And I won't say it, but let's think of some more...

2010
02:01:53,000 --> 02:02:01,000
King Kong takes a big dump, like a really fast dump that shoots out and hits the building in the base.

2011
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:06,000
King Kong takes Donald Trump and shoves him inside of his butt.

2012
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:09,000
And then farts him out?

2013
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:13,000
And farts Trump out at the building, knocking the building down.

2014
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:17,000
Yes, perfect.

2015
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:22,000
Man, Ben Shapiro would really hate our podcast if he's been a fan of it up until now.

2016
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:24,000
Oh, sorry, Ben.

2017
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:25,000
We're not getting him.

2018
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:26,000
That was too lewd.

2019
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:30,000
He liked how good we were on the main feed and now he's not liking me.

2020
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:34,000
He loves seat. Ben Shapiro says the word seat all the time.

2021
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:42,000
I think like the end of Dark Knight, you let him fall a little much like the Joker, but then you throw a batarang.

2022
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:45,000
Like someone catches you, because you're better than him.

2023
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:48,000
Justice was done correctly.

2024
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:52,000
Because you need to think about what you've done.

2025
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:54,000
It's too easy to just let you fall.

2026
02:02:54,000 --> 02:03:06,000
I think it would be good if they had projected all the famous people that he was like casually acquainted with that he thought he was good friends with on the building saying they hate him.

2027
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:10,000
Because those are the people he cares about the most, are like famous people.

2028
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:17,000
He's so mad at Hollywood because he's like desperate for like their attention and their love, which he can truly not get now.

2029
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:20,000
Nicholson Beatty, everyone in that photo.

2030
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:23,000
Larry King, one of the last pieces of footage of Larry King.

2031
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:24,000
Fuck you, Donald.

2032
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:27,000
Yeah, if you get like people like that.

2033
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:29,000
I mean, it's probably like Nicholson.

2034
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:31,000
He probably had never seen a Jack Nicholson movie.

2035
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:32,000
Let's be honest.

2036
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:35,000
He just Trump like Stephen Seagal movies and that's about the top.

2037
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:37,000
That's about as sophisticated as he gets.

2038
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:39,000
But like even if you do, are you an actor?

2039
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:41,000
Stephen Seagal, I'm sure still supported him.

2040
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:46,000
But if you just paid Stephen Seagal, say like a hundred bucks, he would be like, you just say like, fuck you, Trump.

2041
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:47,000
You're dead to me.

2042
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:52,000
And then like projected on the building and then you get like 50 of them and then you take the thing down.

2043
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:58,000
Well, I think you do get some justice for Atlantic City as an option.

2044
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:05,000
And as I described that pier with them all, the pier he might have owned might have been I think what is now Steel Pier.

2045
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:10,000
There's a pier right by what was Trump Taj Mahal with amusement attractions.

2046
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:15,000
And I could see him lying his way of like these old roller coasters, these old shitty rides.

2047
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:17,000
You know, yes, six flags will come in and fix these right up.

2048
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:26,000
But I believe on one of those peers or maybe one that's been since demolished, the original Steel Pier had a high diving course,

2049
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:34,000
which would was a horse that would climb a ladder to a high dive board and dive into a pool.

2050
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:39,000
And so I think you make him climb the ladder.

2051
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:51,000
You rebuild this platform in the pool and you let the residents throw some Jersey fresh tomatoes up until he goes off the end of the high dive into the horse pool.

2052
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:56,000
Trump in the horse pool is pretty good. Yeah.

2053
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:58,000
Wait, does that trigger the explosion somehow?

2054
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:06,000
Like is there is that like then a mousetrap situation where like then the water from the pool, the tank runs a lot like hits a wire and then.

2055
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:08,000
Oh, yeah, I guess that should probably explode something.

2056
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:13,000
Well, I think there's another Trump Plaza tower where there's another building.

2057
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:15,000
You know, there's still some ancillary buildings.

2058
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:17,000
I'm like almost going backwards.

2059
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:20,000
Like if they would, you're right, there will be other ones to blow up.

2060
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:23,000
Yeah, I'm just saying what they could have done to this one.

2061
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:24,000
Oh, to this one. Yeah.

2062
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:25,000
And that triggers the explosion.

2063
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:29,000
And you just you don't tell that that they're actually very far apart.

2064
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:34,000
You cheat it like the magic of, you know, the Treasure Island cannonballs, the postcard.

2065
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:41,000
Well, maybe I kind of want to flash back to the to the Treasure Island implosion.

2066
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:44,000
Steve Wynn, an enemy of Trump's.

2067
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:53,000
So for him to be proven the winner, Steve, Steve, you win everything.

2068
02:05:53,000 --> 02:05:55,000
You're great. Nothing to worry about here.

2069
02:05:55,000 --> 02:06:02,000
So you let Steve come back in with a pirate ship is it's all along the water is all on the beach.

2070
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:11,000
So he pulls up and then he nods to somebody in a pirate hat and he announces with a bullhorn

2071
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:16,000
Captain of Captain of the Clintonia.

2072
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:18,000
Are you ready, ma'am?

2073
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:23,000
And then it's Hillary and Hillary fires the cannon.

2074
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:28,000
And was there was there a good Hillary fray?

2075
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:31,000
Nevertheless, I resisted.

2076
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:33,000
And then what is there?

2077
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:34,000
What was her friend?

2078
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:36,000
What's a good Hillary phrase to?

2079
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:38,000
Well, oh, shoot.

2080
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:42,000
What was the I'm just chilling on the Britannia.

2081
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:48,000
Stronger together, stronger together.

2082
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:52,000
Pokemon go into the building.

2083
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:55,000
Yeah, that's good.

2084
02:06:55,000 --> 02:06:59,000
I mean, if the Pots of America guys could be involved to to help with all that stuff, I think that's a great.

2085
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:00,000
They're going to write.

2086
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:02,000
Oh, yeah. Great zingers.

2087
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:06,000
Make more money than we've ever seen in our lives.

2088
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:16,000
Yeah, I this the win connection would be fitting because the you know, the war for the shore, I think it's the book is called Trump brand.

2089
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:24,000
Steve pretty much ran Trump won Trump ran Steve went out of town basically, you know, in the casino wars of the 70s and 80s.

2090
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:31,000
Wow. So he comes back on the boat, one of his rivals, maybe everybody who kind of feuded with Kathy Griffin.

2091
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:34,000
It's not there. OK, great, great. Yeah.

2092
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:44,000
Who was who did Trump make an enemy of General Mattis, General Mattis, Matt Dogg Mattis, Kristen Stewart's on there.

2093
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:46,000
Oh, you're right. Yes.

2094
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:53,000
Oh, that middler, that middler, John Bolton, you know, all the enemies.

2095
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:56,000
Yeah. Scaramouche.

2096
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:58,000
That's great. Oh, yeah.

2097
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:01,000
Dancing the dancing potato.

2098
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:07,000
What was that idiot's name? The one on Dancing with the Stars is just like on Spicer Spicer.

2099
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:15,000
Yes. I was pretty sure there was maybe like a potato spokesman I had forgotten about in the four years when you said that.

2100
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:22,000
I mean, he could have taken some shots at like an Uraida mascot or like Mr. Mr. Peanut.

2101
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:27,000
There's a windmill. There's a dancing windmill that comes on because he hates windmills.

2102
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:33,000
So just a I think a pirate ship of his enemies blowing up the boat. How did they miss this?

2103
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:35,000
This should have been done. Yeah. Yeah.

2104
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:39,000
Yeah. If only I think but I think also I think just do all of them.

2105
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:47,000
I think I'll then also have the horse falling and then of course replace it with King Kong sleeping on Enterprise.

2106
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:49,000
Yeah, I think that's great.

2107
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:58,000
Put your makeup on, fix your hair up pretty and meet me tonight at the Trump Plaza of Explosion Viewing Area.

2108
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:08,000
Well, that's been the commercial. Yeah, that should have been a Jeep commercial.

2109
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:16,000
And this should. Yeah, true. With that song at the beginning with Sinbad hosting and with appearances from my favorite news crew,

2110
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:22,000
Mark Sayers and Steve Kruppi and Ted Tester and Michael Gieser.

2111
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:25,000
And they all we all blow this up. We blow this up for them.

2112
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:31,000
This should have been and it should have they should have done this instead of that inauguration with Tom Hanks and Katy Perry.

2113
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:34,000
Oh, yeah. Yeah. The inauguration should have been.

2114
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:37,000
Wait, what is this? What do you know?

2115
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:41,000
You know, they did the inauguration special with Katy Perry and Biden.

2116
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:47,000
Yeah, Biden. Yeah, Biden and an empty Lincoln Memorial and the new radicals.

2117
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:50,000
I didn't know the new radical. I knew about the new radicals. Yeah.

2118
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:54,000
Mm hmm. Yeah. Well, yes, everybody did. So, yeah, this should have been it.

2119
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:59,000
We could have planned this thing, taken everything back to its 90s roots.

2120
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:07,000
Next time, let us Biden. If you get reelected, blow up another Trump building of your choice and bring us on to do it.

2121
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:10,000
Yeah, we're ready. We're ready.

2122
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:12,000
That just like the captain of the Britannia.

2123
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:19,000
And well, that was wonderful. We survived podcast, the ride casino implosions.

2124
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:25,000
Boy, oh, boy. So nice to see so many great old friends and enemies again.

2125
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:30,000
A topic with so much that we actually went as long as we used to have the energy to in person.

2126
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:33,000
That's right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

2127
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:40,000
But we go along because we love you implosions. Thanks for everything. We hope you maintain through the next century.

2128
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:50,000
And when the podcast is done, when we decide that we're done, we should build the thing in our logo as a literal item, like 3D printed.

2129
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:54,000
And we should implode it. And that's how I guess the ride ends.

2130
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:59,000
And it'll be a whole celebration. Yeah, I have a feeling King Kong will be involved.

2131
02:10:59,000 --> 02:11:06,000
You sure will. Well, whenever that happens, let's get ready to crumble.

2132
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:15,000
And you please let's get ready to stay subscribed for more stuff like this coming next month. So long, everybody. Bye bye.
