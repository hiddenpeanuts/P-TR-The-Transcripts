1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Forever!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Dog!

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Warning! The following haunt cast features live theme park rock and roll,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
self-defeating thoughts,

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
a somber monster fact correction,

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
and actors waving their arms wildly.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
All this, plus a peek at Southern California Haunt Season.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
It's Mike Loves Haunts

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
on Haunt Cast the Fright.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Welcome to Haunt Cast the Fright,

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
the scary theme park podcast where sometimes

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
scary haunts go well and sometimes scary haunts

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
go very badly. My name is Mike Carlson,

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
joining me as always, Jason Sheridan.

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm so intrigued, I mean I've been intrigued for days

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
about this episode.

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I'll bring Scott Garner in here real quick.

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Yeah, geez, I truly don't know.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
We're all on the edge of our seats.

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I feel like I've hyped this up, so real quick,

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'd like to just, we'll tease this right now,

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
and then we'll do a little just general Halloween discussion,

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
but my journey, my personal journey on this podcast,

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
this theme park podcast, is starting out as a scared kid.

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Scared of Halloween stuff, scared of haunted houses.

26
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Did anything happen? Did anything change?

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I'm walking through, in case maybe this is your first episode,

28
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
something did change, and all of a sudden I became

29
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
the undisputed king of California haunts,

30
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Southern California haunts. I think I called myself that.

31
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
A bit of a, I was being a bit facetious, but I did.

32
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
But then it took, and everyone's been saying it.

33
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Everyone says it. Not a joke anymore.

34
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
They're honking their horn, they yell it out the window.

35
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Undisputed king of Southern haunts!

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
That's right, Leno drove by in the Munster's car,

37
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
which I have been, by the way, I have to stop this real quick.

38
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Yeah. Did you see this? I saw this, I saw this.

39
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
This is shocking. You have been publicly griped.

40
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I gotta look up, I forgot.

41
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Everybody keeps falling into it with the 60s TV shows.

42
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
He's throwing out there. Yes.

43
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
So regularly, Scott pointed out, I think about two weeks ago,

44
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
that, or maybe last week. Several occasions.

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Several occasions he'll say something about the Munster's car,

46
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
and before the sentence is even finished, I will say,

47
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Dracula.

48
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
It gets Dracula, it gets Dracula.

49
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Now someone has pointed out, and I should find out who this gentleman is,

50
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
somebody pointed out that on our Facebook group,

51
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
somebody has corrected me, and that the Munster's car is called

52
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
the Munster's Coach, and the Dracula is actually

53
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Grandpa's car, that it's a different looking car

54
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
than the regular Munster's car.

55
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Which is, now hang on, the Munster's Coach,

56
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
that's like a more hearse looking.

57
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Yes, a bigger car for the whole family, and it looks like a hearse.

58
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Grandpa's car is more of like a coffin in the front,

59
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
sort of a roadster coffin thing.

60
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And this is part of the film that I know that you were fond of.

61
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Yes. What's the film called?

62
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Munsters Go Home?

63
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Yeah, that's what you're talking about.

64
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Yes, and the confusion comes from, and this person points out in the Facebook,

65
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
and I will find the name, that Rob Zombie,

66
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
in the video for Dracula, the song Dracula that he has,

67
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,000
he uses the regular Munster's car, and not Grandpa Munster's Dracula.

68
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
So this is where the confusion now has stemmed from for years,

69
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
and now this is the guy directing the Munster's movie, the new Munster's movie.

70
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Having already made a fatal error.

71
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Yes, a fatal error. Mr. Robert Zombie.

72
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I assume somebody heard that this happened and had a heart attack.

73
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
It might be happening right now. Sorry listener, get some help.

74
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Don't make this a fatal mistake.

75
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
But yeah, Rob fucked up, and now he still gets the keys to the kingdom?

76
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Yeah, I guess.

77
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
They only give the best of the best to the Munster's franchise

78
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
once every three years for some unviewed, unwatchable pilot.

79
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,000
It is a prestige property. Nothing but hits since the first show came out.

80
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
And the last time, they didn't even make a full pilot,

81
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
they just made that fallout boy song Uma Thurman that samples the Munster song.

82
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
That's true. Nothing but the best for this property.

83
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
The finest art has existed in the Munsterverse.

84
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
This gentleman, Matt Carr, pointed this out.

85
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Well, you know why he knows it. He knows his cars.

86
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Very good.

87
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
He's always driving his classic cars all around.

88
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
So I'd like to formally apologize to the listeners here.

89
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
There's going to be a lot of me humbling myself on today's episode,

90
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
and it starts here by humbling myself by saying that I have been incorrectly

91
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:16,000
calling the Munster's car the Dragulome, and it is the Munster's coach, not the Dragulome.

92
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
So we're answering kind of a spooky gripe, I guess.

93
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I don't know what you call a graveyard gripe.

94
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
A graveyard gripe is good.

95
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
So yeah, we're taking care of that up front, but we're going to discuss sort of,

96
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
what does Southern California haunts, what do they look like this year?

97
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I have no clue what's coming.

98
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Yeah, I want to overhype it, and it's nothing like serious.

99
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
It's nothing like I got stabbed or something.

100
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I mean, you wouldn't be talking about it on the show, I guess,

101
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
but there's no scenario where you and three other people killed somebody,

102
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
and you had to enter some pact, and then you had to go to the police,

103
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
and you had to go to the police, and you had to go to the police, and you had to go to the police,

104
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
And then there's some, you know, there's some, three other people killed somebody,

105
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000
and you had to enter some pact, and there's some farce where you buried the body,

106
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
but then it got worse, and you got found out.

107
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Yeah, I don't think I would say anything.

108
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
That would be for off mic.

109
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I would tell you guys off mic, and then say,

110
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Hey, don't bring it up that I had to disappear a body.

111
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
You've got to!

112
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
You have to be honest on this show.

113
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
This is honest podcasting.

114
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
No matter what, even if you get sent to jail.

115
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I don't know if I committed homicide, but right now I'm not feeling comfortable enough to admit something like that.

116
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
So the stakes are a lot lower.

117
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
But in the context of me growing and going to haunts,

118
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,000
and oh, look at what you're doing now at age whatever when I started 35.

119
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Look how brave you are, you man in his middle 30s.

120
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:57,000
It was really, really defeating and stayed with me for days.

121
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Oh man.

122
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
And after a year where you weren't allowed to grow,

123
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:08,000
where we were all stuck in any, nobody really got to grow in any way in 2020.

124
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Sure.

125
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
And now, so you're raring to get back out there.

126
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Yes, I was.

127
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Before this, I asked already, but just to make sure.

128
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Have you guys done any fun?

129
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Have you seen the Halloween decorations?

130
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I see you dressed up the front lawn a little bit.

131
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
It's a great little...

132
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Oh, thank you.

133
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I've got a little skeleton scene happening in the front.

134
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
What a dream.

135
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I'm so happy to have a place where I can make a little skeleton scene happen.

136
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
That's fantastic.

137
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:42,000
That and a couple pumpkin patches.

138
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
This is my first year with the kid understanding Halloween.

139
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,000
So we're like, boy, the hype was correct.

140
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I have heard that little kids love pumpkins, and they sure do.

141
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:02,000
He went around and gave a high five to every weird scarecrow at this one that we went to

142
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:09,000
who all had rubber Halloween masks that seemed to be either Hillary Clinton or Mitt Romney.

143
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Multiples of both, I believe.

144
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,000
So yeah, my son's high fiveing undead Mitt Romney's left and right.

145
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
We're having a great time.

146
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
But other than that, you would not think to call that a haunt.

147
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:29,000
He's going to be running the register at one of Burbank's two year-round Halloween stores soon enough

148
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:35,000
or any of the number of horror-focused memorabilia and DVD bookstores.

149
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
It's a real district.

150
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
You bring up a really good point.

151
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I haven't really thought of it.

152
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
It's all on the street in Burbank called Magnolia, named Magnolia,

153
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
which is what the Paul Thomas Anderson movie is named after, that street.

154
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Which I think factors into, I think some of it is set on, but not that stretch of Magnolia,

155
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
but Magnolia runs through the whole valley.

156
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
And he loves the valleys, we know.

157
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
We know that.

158
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
We've got a whole new valley coming out.

159
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Yes, but it's full of kitschy nonsense.

160
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Yeah, Magnolia Park.

161
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Old toy stores on Magnolia.

162
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Toy stores, a lot of vintage stuff, a lot of antique shops, a lot of little coffee shops.

163
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
And I was like, oh yeah, that's also why I like Burbank.

164
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I had that thought driving down Magnolia.

165
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I'm like, oh yeah, it's all right here.

166
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Car specific bookstores where you might just be suddenly biking around with your kid and run into Jay Leno.

167
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Of course.

168
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
It's magic.

169
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Burbank is magic.

170
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Model train shop.

171
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Very specific stuff.

172
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
That kind of stuff.

173
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Where you ask, are there tangible locations for things like this?

174
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
And again, we're not talking Spirit Halloween.

175
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:50,000
We're not talking these fly by night operations that come and go, although they're around too.

176
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
But yeah, year round Halloween stores.

177
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
That is where I think.

178
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Yeah, highly themed rooms that say like, don't take photos in here.

179
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Haunted Mansion stuff.

180
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Yeah.

181
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Disney stuff.

182
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Yeah.

183
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
So yeah, that's fun.

184
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
So you just did a few pumpkin patches.

185
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
That's been there thus far.

186
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Jason pumpkin patches.

187
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Anything Halloween?

188
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Well, I finished that book ghost story and I started a spooky Ray Bradbury book.

189
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,000
You're a reader is what we discovered about you last year.

190
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I am a reader.

191
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
So you read interesting.

192
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
He lords that over us because Scott and I can't read a book.

193
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
That is one of my little quirks.

194
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I'm trying to watch more horror movies for when I eventually become a big brave boy.

195
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Right, because that was supposed to be.

196
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
We scheduled you to become brave last year.

197
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Last year.

198
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Right.

199
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
And I was brave.

200
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I came out.

201
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Yeah, I was.

202
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
We all were brave.

203
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
And because yeah, you were citing some physical problems.

204
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Like this year you said, OK, I can't be brave this year.

205
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
So can we schedule you to be brave next year?

206
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I sure hope I'm like, you know, the physical therapy seems to be slowly working.

207
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
OK.

208
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Yeah.

209
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
So walking distances is getting a little easier.

210
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
So will pencil you being brave now?

211
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Can you declare?

212
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Will it just be horror nights next year or would you be willing to go to Fright Fest and

213
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
not scary farm?

214
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I think I would start with horror nights because my impression has always been it's the most

215
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
polished.

216
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
It's a good you want a good show.

217
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Well, I love a good show.

218
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
But also like, oh, I a little more predictable.

219
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
You are right about that.

220
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
It is the most predictable.

221
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
They do a very similar scare each time.

222
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Yeah.

223
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,000
You will be getting a rhythm of getting yelled at or not yelled at, just like arms.

224
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Basically, all you do is you walk through a little hallway and somebody flails their

225
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
arms at you.

226
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Yes.

227
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Unexpectedly while allowed sting plays.

228
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Now, I did.

229
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I was telling you beforehand, I watched a lot of the house walkthroughs at horror nights

230
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
and I walked some live streams, the opening night of horror nights, which in Orlando was

231
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:01,000
very funny because it started before the sunset.

232
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Sun still pretty out and then a massive thunderstorm blew through.

233
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
So everyone scattered.

234
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Yes.

235
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
And there really wasn't a ton to do outside.

236
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
You either got in line for a house or you tried to eat limited run food.

237
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,000
And the live streams were mostly vloggers saying hi to other vloggers who were also

238
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
vlogging.

239
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
And if you jumped back and forth between them, you could you could figure out spatially where

240
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
everyone was.

241
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
This was kind of a fun, John.

242
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
But I bring this up.

243
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I mean, I think the depression watching videos of a lot of the events and reading about,

244
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:41,000
you know, the the vases and scares, it feels like a very meat and potato.

245
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Like there were we're playing the hits.

246
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Yeah.

247
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
People are we know people are hungry to come back.

248
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
None of us are cash rich right now.

249
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
But we want to put on a good show.

250
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
We want to have some big houses.

251
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Yeah.

252
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
In Universal's case, some very recognizable names.

253
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Sure.

254
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:04,000
But like I didn't get as much of the impression like 2019 people felt like they were

255
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
going between the house and the Ghostbusters house.

256
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
It felt like it was definitely lower key this year.

257
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
So we will get to the end.

258
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,000
And I guess it'll be a little bit like the story will be a little earlier because we will just talk

259
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:20,000
about just generally the Hollywood Horror Nights houses and some of the stuff that I did get to

260
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
do.

261
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
So that will be in the episode as well.

262
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
But I'm going to weave a tale, I guess, for everyone here.

263
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Please.

264
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Yeah.

265
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
So yeah, let's just let's start this.

266
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Should we turn the lights off and get some flashlights?

267
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I was feeling anxious even about telling.

268
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I have told the story, but I am feeling anxious about telling.

269
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Sorry.

270
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
But if you guys want, I'll do it in the dark.

271
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I can handle it.

272
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I'm still I'm still brave.

273
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Well, can I just say I so you you I don't want to give anything away.

274
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Maybe you had a way to get to that.

275
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
But you you did not make it to Fright Fest this year.

276
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Correct.

277
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I did not make it to Fright Fest.

278
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Hopefully next year, we remind which one because I know.

279
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I'm sorry.

280
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Fright Fest is six flags in Magic Mountain.

281
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Magic Mountain.

282
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
That's if you've heard the show.

283
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Anthony Geo was on that.

284
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:14,000
And I like Anthony Geo schedule to free up to be to be able to go again so we can do a good

285
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Fright Fest to do without him.

286
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Can't do without him at this point.

287
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I love all of us to go so we can all go to the full throttle lounge beforehand.

288
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Oh, sure.

289
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Book a book a block of rooms at the Hilton Garden.

290
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Ain't out there or something.

291
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Block of rooms.

292
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Go to the Wendy's next to the decrepit rotting six flags.

293
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Greeting like visitor center that does a former gift shop in the base of a gift shop in a sign in a Wendy's parking lot.

294
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I don't think so weird.

295
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
More expensive Wendy's.

296
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Wendy's where they like bump the prices a little more.

297
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Wow.

298
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
They would get people.

299
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I don't think even Scott, like I don't even think like I wouldn't even pressure you to do anything.

300
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:00,000
You literally maybe like we just tell you sit outside full throttle lounge and watch the teens and see what they do.

301
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
If I'm allowed to mainly stay in full thru.

302
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
But full thru our lounge is closed at least regular.

303
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Yeah.

304
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
There's no full thru our lounge then.

305
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Then I if there's I demand full thru our lounge and I demand Anthony Geo.

306
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Yeah.

307
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
These are my demands.

308
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
So maybe we can all go and we all have different beats.

309
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
It's all different.

310
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Like we all report on different things.

311
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
But we all have a nice idea.

312
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,000
We all go to the running of the scare actors at the start where they all run out into the audience and everyone shrieks.

313
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:40,000
So I bring this up because I was wondering if you had at least glanced at the website to learn that the Willoughby's resurrected house, a house that you in 2018 spoke pretty highly of this year is brought to you by Discovery Plus's Ghosttober event.

314
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Discovery Plus Ghosttober presents Willoughby's resurrected.

315
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Mike seems exceedingly sure what you're talking about.

316
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
It was like, is that the one with the pile of shit?

317
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:57,000
There was one was like supposed to be in the sewer and there was like a giant thing that was supposed to represent a big pile of shit that a man made.

318
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
No, this was like an old mansion.

319
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Like, oh, I know.

320
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Oh, yeah, I do know.

321
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I do know.

322
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I know.

323
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
That one actually was pretty good.

324
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
That was like their own version of the haunted mansion.

325
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
OK. Willoughby.

326
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I remember Mr. Willoughby.

327
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
There were original characters.

328
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Sorry.

329
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I, you know, Mike loves haunts and he remembers haunts.

330
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:23,000
And some of the one fright fest means we had to wear 3D glasses while walking through it to completely my memory is totally gone.

331
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I think that might have been the shit one, though.

332
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
And all I remember was the shit.

333
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Ghostober also kind of the sister event to another streaming event this October.

334
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Peacocks has a lot of horror movies for October, and they're calling it Peacocktober.

335
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
OK.

336
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
All right.

337
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Peacocktober.

338
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
All right.

339
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Got it.

340
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Got it.

341
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Thank you.

342
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
So I'm excited to see how much they have.

343
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Great.

344
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Anyway, on to your story.

345
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Of course.

346
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
So last week, we were talking about what's this because we have a couple other episodes planned.

347
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
You can guess one of them, obviously.

348
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
And I was like, what's this episode going to be?

349
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
And I have an ambitious idea.

350
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I would also say next year, Fright Fest 2, Jason becomes brave and the other two episodes are going to be the same.

351
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
So next year, Fright Fest 2, Jason becomes brave.

352
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
And then this ambitious idea I had that scheduling wise did not quite work out.

353
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
But it's a very good idea and we will do it next year.

354
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:24,000
So I was thinking, OK, I want to make sure when we go and do a haunt report that I do a couple things and maybe a thing that I've never done.

355
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,000
And Wednesday morning, something fell into my lap that was unexpected.

356
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I got a text.

357
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Physically?

358
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
No, no.

359
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Did you get crushed?

360
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
No, no.

361
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Figuratively.

362
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Edwin, what are you doing?

363
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Edwin, you've crushed my genitals like the twisted Colossus roller coaster at Six Flags Magic Mountain.

364
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Getting you ready.

365
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Woof woof.

366
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Woof woof.

367
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Happy Halloween.

368
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:53,000
So I got a text from friends of the show, Eva Anderson and Jason Woolner.

369
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Oh boy.

370
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:01,000
They on the text chain invited me to something called Project Minotaur.

371
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I was invited to Project Minotaur.

372
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
And I remember I looked at it.

373
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I'm like, what is this?

374
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Project Minotaur.

375
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Now I have done, I should say this, I've done a couple of these other like smaller haunt scary things with them.

376
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
We've gone to a place called Zombie Joe's.

377
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I saw a show there and I did like a basically like a simulated dark ride.

378
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
It's over on Lancashire.

379
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:26,000
And I was like, that's one of those where you have to like sign a waiver and then they can touch you and stuff, which is weird.

380
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Yeah.

381
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
But I actually found that pretty cool.

382
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Not the touching part.

383
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I mean the actual overall experience.

384
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
You felt free for the first time in your life.

385
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I didn't like touch.

386
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I didn't like be touched by strangers.

387
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
That's not a weird kink I have.

388
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
No, don't look into that anymore.

389
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
So I've done a couple of these things.

390
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:50,000
We have done Delirium with Eva, which is a little more of like an adventure.

391
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
An immersive, immersive play.

392
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Very long.

393
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
That was great.

394
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Which is really cool.

395
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
And it was a little, there was a little, you know, scary part, but nothing like it's not a, it was not a horror.

396
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Based thing where they throw you in a, I heard they like throw you in a coffin and other ones.

397
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I think they're coming back and I think it is a straight haunted house.

398
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Yes, that is correct.

399
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
A friend of the show, Andrew Grissom did it.

400
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
And he said that is the case.

401
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
It is a horror theme this year.

402
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Is that a company you're saying?

403
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Yes, they do a show or I think it may be one.

404
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I mean, obviously a lot of people put it on, but I think there's one man in charge.

405
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I could be wrong.

406
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Don't quote me.

407
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Okay.

408
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:32,000
They invite me to Project Minotaur, which is a horror themed escape room.

409
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
And I go, oh, okay.

410
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,000
And I'm like, I guess I've never really, I've never actually done an escape room.

411
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I don't know. Have you guys done an escape room?

412
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
I've not. You know, we have not touched on this area at all.

413
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
And it's almost weird we haven't gotten there.

414
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Yes, it is weird.

415
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Because like that's, that's, you know, a themed experience that's pretty popular.

416
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
There's a ton of them.

417
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Yeah. And like many cities across the country, not just here.

418
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I did one.

419
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Oh, you did.

420
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
You were out, I think for Zach Reno's bachelor party.

421
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
You were out of town, I think.

422
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I was out of town.

423
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
It was cool.

424
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,000
And I'm not particularly good with puzzles.

425
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
So I was just kind of admiring the theatricality of it.

426
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I forget the name.

427
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I think it was like escape room LA somewhere downtown.

428
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
And yeah, I thought it was pretty.

429
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Yeah, that was pretty neat.

430
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Sure.

431
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Which I assume.

432
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Yeah, I was like, okay, it's Halloween.

433
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I go, I go, well, you know, this is perfect because this is exactly what I wanted to do.

434
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Because, well, I'll have material because as you guys know, you're living your life for this show.

435
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
This is your life is now content.

436
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Every show, it's disappointing when you're sleeping and you're not.

437
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Unless the dream counts as a themed experience.

438
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
But yeah, that was one episode at a time.

439
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Yeah, exactly.

440
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
So I go, OK, this is perfect for the show.

441
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I'm a little like it's like a kind of an enclosed space.

442
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
It's still a covid situation.

443
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
But then I'm looking at the website and it's like you're just with the group you come with.

444
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
There's maybe like one or two performers and you got like a mask.

445
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I go, I'll just bring the good like mask.

446
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:12,000
The N95 mask I have that I wore on the plane and stuff, which is like a heavier duty.

447
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
It's not my target, you know, it's not my breezy target mask.

448
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:20,000
It's like, OK, this is like a legit like I can feel my breathing being restricted from this.

449
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
So I go, OK, sure, sure.

450
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:28,000
So it's down on like Santa Monica and it's part a part of like it's not in Santa Monica.

451
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
It's on Santa Monica and like what you call East Hollywood, I guess.

452
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,000
And it's one of those places where you cannot park anywhere.

453
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
There's just nowhere to park.

454
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:42,000
So I'm early, but very quickly I am not early.

455
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
It's one of those situations where I'm like, oh, good, I'm here 15 minutes early.

456
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Do do do. Let's take my time to find a spot.

457
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
La la la la la la la. Oh, my God.

458
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,000
It's three minutes till we're supposed to that we have the time that we're supposed to check in.

459
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:00,000
So I'm like, shit, and everybody is like Eva and Jason are both like, there's nowhere to park.

460
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,000
OK, I'm like, at least I'm not like, you know, like really holding everyone up.

461
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
But I was they all seem to be there before me.

462
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,000
So I end up parking like seven blocks away or something.

463
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
And I'm like jogging. Oh, God. Oh, God. OK, OK.

464
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I get there. We were talking. There's a couple other people.

465
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:23,000
There's going to be six total people, a couple or one person I met for the first time.

466
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
This other guy, Landon, who we met before.

467
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I've done a couple. He's a great guy. I haven't seen him in forever.

468
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
I took him to wrestling, blah, blah, blah.

469
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
And I haven't seen him like, hey, good to see you.

470
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Whatever Amy Nicholson shows up.

471
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
I haven't seen her in like God.

472
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Maybe we saw her at Comic Con two or three years ago.

473
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Ages ago. At this point.

474
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
That's the last time I saw her. Hey, this is great or whatever.

475
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:50,000
So we go in and it's a very I've heard like they're all talking because they're all in this scene.

476
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I get invited once in a while to the scene, but they all know the I mean like deep into immersive.

477
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Yes. The actual experience.

478
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,000
The actual experience. Eva, Walner and Landon are all like experts on this scene.

479
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Yeah. You have to be in the scene seemingly like it's it's it's close niche in these.

480
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Yes. And they get really enveloped in them.

481
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Yes. Yes. And that's a whole nother like, yeah, they know like names of performers and what's happening in that scene,

482
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,000
which I can appreciate because I love a niche scene as you know,

483
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:31,000
when we talk about any like theme park media people, I love I love people that no one else has heard of that.

484
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
There's 30 people that have heard of.

485
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,000
You know, so so yeah, they're talking about like, oh, you know, we did this escape room.

486
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,000
I did because there's like this place is it's called Quest Room and they do multiple different escape rooms.

487
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
So they're talking. Oh, we did this one. Whatever.

488
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:50,000
We did this. So we get in there and it's a pretty small like I don't want to say Ricky.

489
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:55,000
I don't want to make it sound like it's it's obviously like a good one if they all like this company.

490
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,000
But it's like a pretty small like even like doctors waiting room.

491
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:06,000
So I'm sort of like pacing around and then the guy comes out and he's kind of like he's a little theatrical, of course,

492
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
because, you know, an escape room.

493
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
And he explains now that we have to get in jumpsuits.

494
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
We have to all wear jumpsuits. Well, I'm like, OK.

495
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:18,000
And then he's like, we have to wear knee pads as well because there'll be some crawling and there'll be some this.

496
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
And they're like, and that was all I think in the disclaimer.

497
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:27,000
So we're putting it on. And all of a sudden I realize I'm getting anxious.

498
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,000
And I'm and I'm I'm like, oh, hmm.

499
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Now, at this point, I'm sure we all have had this in the past.

500
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:41,000
My brain decides it wants to sabotage me.

501
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:46,000
And it's sometimes hard to get out of a weird like feedback loop in your brain.

502
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
I'm sure we've all had versions of this.

503
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

504
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
You're speaking my language.

505
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
I've never felt closer to you at this moment.

506
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:06,000
So I all of a sudden go, oh, no, because he's explaining like, you know, tight corridors,

507
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,000
90 minutes to two hour long experience.

508
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
And all of a sudden I didn't even think of this.

509
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
This wasn't even on my radar.

510
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,000
All of a sudden I'm doing like paper bat like like.

511
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:23,000
And now the mask, I'm hearing my own breath in the mask in the heavy and 95 mask.

512
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:29,000
I'm going. And I'm going, oh, my God, is this?

513
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,000
No. And then I remember when I was when I was on a plane a few weeks ago,

514
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:39,000
I sat down on the plane and for like a couple minutes I had kind of the same feeling like, oh, I'm stuck here.

515
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:45,000
And then I remember I have like facial claustrophobia, which I don't know.

516
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,000
I don't know what the term is, but I think I've said this before.

517
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:53,000
They were putting like a fat suit on me at Conan and it got stuck on my head.

518
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
And I had like a mini anxiety attack.

519
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
That's like a horror show.

520
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:03,000
There was a funnier die video with Jeremy Piven that I was in where I played an anonymous race car driver.

521
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
And I had to put a big like, you know, that race.

522
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
That was a branded. They were like the Honda.

523
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:14,000
I was I was I was a hot wheel racer.

524
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Yes, Hot Wheels racers.

525
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:22,000
And Jeremy Piven was there and he had nothing to do with my anxiety that day.

526
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
I don't know if that was the case for everybody.

527
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:30,000
I don't know if that was the case for everybody, but I had to wear a helmet and those race car driving.

528
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Like you have to really cram them on your head.

529
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
And I remember having the same thing.

530
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
So now I'm reliving all of this.

531
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Like I'm going I'm like kind of like just trying to like get all this bad stuff out of my head.

532
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,000
So I go over there's like a water cooler and I must have looked completely crazy.

533
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
I'm like pulling the mask down and I'm like, OK, I'm drinking water.

534
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,000
I'm like, and the guy is like doing his whole show.

535
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Now the theatricality has really started.

536
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
The lights go down in the like in the waiting room.

537
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Now he's kind of doing like now what I must tell you.

538
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:12,000
And he's like he's like so you will be he's like you will be you know groups of three and three and then you will go through the corridor and you must be aware of the Minotaur or whatever.

539
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
He's talking about the Minotaur because it's project Minotaur.

540
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:22,000
If the Minotaur catches you, you will be taken and you will be put in a jail cell and you will not be able to answer the he's doing this whole thing.

541
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
And I'm just like, mm hmm.

542
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:29,000
And I go, hey, he's like, does anyone have any questions?

543
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:35,000
I was like, hey, if you have to like get out of the game or anything like what what happens?

544
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
How do you do it? He goes, ah, yes.

545
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Well, you have to put up the X, which is a professional wrestling sign for a guy is hurt for real.

546
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
OK, and I go, OK, all right, got it.

547
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,000
All right. And he tells like, ah, yes, the great question or whatever.

548
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
And I'm like, OK, great.

549
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:57,000
So I'm sitting there and everybody's like we've like on three and three or whatever.

550
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
And I go, OK, that made me feel a lot better.

551
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
I take a big deep breath.

552
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
I'm not perfect, but it's fine.

553
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Everything's fine. Like it's so stupid.

554
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
I'm so mad.

555
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Like I'm mad, too, which I'm sure everyone has.

556
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
If you ever had like an anxiety attack like this, you're just like mad.

557
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
You're like, you're my wife is happening.

558
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Just this. This is what's doing.

559
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:23,000
But you do have, you know, look, we're like, every different covid comfort levels, but being in a group, you know, like headquarters.

560
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:27,000
I don't even know if it has anything that part has anything to do with covid, but maybe it does.

561
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Maybe it's sort of a left over like some like even the mildest percentage, the kick show.

562
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Yeah. Yeah.

563
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
So so I go, Jesus, fine or whatever.

564
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:39,000
So I kind of like I kind of get my bearings a little bit.

565
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
And then he goes, all right, we're all ready.

566
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:49,000
He goes here, place these hoods over all of your heads.

567
00:28:50,000 --> 00:29:05,000
And I go, oh, and here is where I turn into a third grader and I go, I think I'm going to need I'm having and I think what I said was a mask like based anxiety attack.

568
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:10,000
I need to I'm going to I'm going to he goes, are you like drugs character?

569
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,000
He's like, are you are you going to what's up, man?

570
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Tap out. Are you tapping out?

571
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,000
And I was like, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm tapping out.

572
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Everyone in the group turns to look at me like, is it like good?

573
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Oh, good. Like, is it just like screamed or something?

574
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
And they're like, oh, oh, like, everyone's nice.

575
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,000
And like, I'm like, and of course, now I'm trying to get ahead of the humiliation.

576
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Oh, no, it's fine, everybody.

577
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
You go ahead.

578
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Like, I'm just yelling stuff and I'm like, stop talking.

579
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
I keep telling myself, stop talking.

580
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
You're only making it worse.

581
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,000
I'm like, no, everything it's have a good time.

582
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
You go in.

583
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Everything's fine.

584
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
No, you go or whatever.

585
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:59,000
And I go and sit like on a booth and then they just like, oh, OK, well, and everybody goes inside and I'm just like, oh, fuck.

586
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
And I'm sitting on a booth.

587
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:09,000
And again, it's like I'm a third like in third whatever that the worst memory you've ever had about being like left out or being too scared.

588
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:13,000
I immediately just regress everything.

589
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Every bad feeling I've ever had comes up and I'm just sitting on this like Charlie Brown on this fucking bench in this stupid little room.

590
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,000
And I'm like, what? Oh, God, why?

591
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,000
And then like because after five minutes or whatever, even less, I'm just like, it's fine.

592
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
I'm fine.

593
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:36,000
I wasn't even it was never like a major like crazy anxiety attack.

594
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:45,000
I was just having this weird, as I was saying, feedback loop of like you're going to get stuck in a little place and you're going to be breathing like it's going to be weird.

595
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Like that's not a voice came up like, hey, it's Beetlejuice.

596
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Oh, geez.

597
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:56,000
You're going to get a tiny little space and you're going to flip out and embarrass yourself.

598
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
It's also like a morning DJ.

599
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Mr. Really freaked you out when you met Bugman.

600
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
You are the evil voice in my head.

601
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
You're a real person.

602
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
I'm meeting.

603
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
You're going to embarrass yourself.

604
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:12,000
And also attack of the clones is good.

605
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Yeah.

606
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:21,000
So I sit down and I'm just all I have not been embarrassed on this level in years.

607
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
I have not humiliated myself.

608
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Everyone was so nice and that would be continued to be nice later.

609
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000
So I'm sitting here and I'm just like, fuck.

610
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:39,000
And to make things worse, I had sort of even a vision of like this is some sort of expansive building past where I can see.

611
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Not really.

612
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Everything's happening just past the door.

613
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
I'm hearing muffled.

614
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Oh, the minute.

615
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Like I'm hearing like dialogue as if I'm literally standing next to everybody.

616
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
I'm like, it's right off the fucking door.

617
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,000
It's not even like it's some deep cavern where you're going underground.

618
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
It's right over there.

619
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Oh, no.

620
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Scary.

621
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Oh, but it's turning out to be a rewarding experience.

622
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Actually, the most fun I've had in a long time.

623
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Yeah, this cathartic.

624
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Yeah.

625
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:11,000
And I hear like I hear Eva like she's like, help, help, help.

626
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,000
And I'm like, that sounds like not real help, which it was not.

627
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Of course, it's part of the thing.

628
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,000
She got captured by the Minotaur and she was put in a jail cell.

629
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Eva, no.

630
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
She was captured and I was like, it's like when she went to the underworld with us.

631
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
It's exactly the same thing.

632
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:29,000
So I was also like, should I burst in with that being appropriate?

633
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
If I go into the game now, probably not.

634
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
They probably wouldn't like that.

635
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Now, the guy who kind of took everyone in never came back out.

636
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:41,000
I was I was expecting him to sort of come back out, but I would later learn he's part of the show.

637
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
So a different escape room is going on.

638
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
And then that lets out.

639
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
They like two people come out just elated.

640
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
So happy.

641
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Everything was so fun.

642
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:53,000
The guy who was helping them out, he comes out and he looks over and he goes, whoa, whoa.

643
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
He's like freaked out that there's a guy in here.

644
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
He's like, whoa, are you are you are you OK?

645
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
And I go, yeah, yeah, no, I'm fine.

646
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
He goes, well, if you need anything.

647
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:06,000
He's really like he's never seen a person in the waiting room who's tapped out.

648
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Like it's as if he's never I mean, I'm projecting a little bit here, but it's as if he's never seen this before.

649
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,000
He wasn't just like, oh, yeah, you know, you had to tap out, huh?

650
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
It was like, oh, God, do you need anything?

651
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,000
What do you need? Do we have to call the ambulance or are you pathetic now?

652
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Are you're pathetic now, aren't you?

653
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
So I'm like, no, no, no, it's fine.

654
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
I had this weird like breathing.

655
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Have I fine.

656
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
I'm fine.

657
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Everything's fine.

658
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
He's like, all right, well, if you need anything, let me know.

659
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Bro, dude, hey, don't worry about it.

660
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Now, what's funny about this, I'll say this part of the story because I don't think it matters.

661
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:44,000
When we were asked when somebody was asking him about like a location for like a bar or restaurant around here, he goes, oh, you know what?

662
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
I don't know.

663
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
I don't know.

664
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
I'm 19.

665
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Oh, great.

666
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
East Hollywood teams are factoring in this year.

667
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
I love it.

668
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Yeah.

669
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:02,000
So I'm sitting on the so I'm sitting on this this cushion or whatever this bench and I'm sitting and now I have an important decision to make.

670
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Do I leave or do I stay to try to save face?

671
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Do I try to say, hey, look at me.

672
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:16,000
I'm OK because there's people like, first of all, obviously, everybody wants to be liked.

673
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
I like all these people.

674
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:27,000
I want them to not like the first thing of seeing me in years is not to be like, oh, yeah, that guy that chickened out before he met the Minotaur in a tiny little space.

675
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Them having already built you up as the undisputed king.

676
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
So you're going to go from there down to this.

677
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Heavy is the head that wears the crown.

678
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Scott, obviously, you never even look at the crown.

679
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,000
You don't even even investigate if there is a real crown.

680
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
That's how we play it.

681
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:52,000
I'm like a like a Icarus, haunted Icarus, spooky Icarus who flew too close.

682
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Spooker is spooker is who flew too close to the haunted sun.

683
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Moon, the whole moon, the moon brought to you by Snickers.

684
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:08,000
The moon melted my wings with its light, with its ghastly light.

685
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,000
So I decide, you know, OK, maybe people people go out afterward.

686
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
I can, you know, save some face.

687
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
But you said this is a 90 minutes to two hour.

688
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Well, I sat like kicking myself mentally for about a half hour.

689
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
That's some of it down the drain.

690
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Self abuse. Exactly.

691
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
And then I said, you should just leave. You're pathetic.

692
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:31,000
You should just leave. And then I go, no, I go, stay, stay.

693
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Because if everyone's going to go hang out, then at least you can feel a little bit better about this,

694
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:41,000
because at least people will again will see that you didn't like just curl up in a ball in the corner of the room.

695
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:45,000
So I do. I wait. Everybody gets done.

696
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
They come out. They're all surprised.

697
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Everyone's like, hey, Carlson, still here. Look at that.

698
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Whatever. And then one of these guys comes out and he's like dressed as like the doctor, the mad scientist.

699
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,000
It's not a different guy than the guy who did our intro.

700
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,000
So he goes, hey, you guys did great. Everyone's talking.

701
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,000
There's like a big like wrap up every, you know, everyone went to the school dance, except for me.

702
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
This is what it feels like.

703
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Although I never know. I missed one dance.

704
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Whatever that didn't. I'm just saying that's the vibe of it.

705
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:16,000
So he goes, hey, he goes, hey, let's get back in there and we'll take a photo inside.

706
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,000
And wait, I saw the I saw the photo too.

707
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Yes. Yes. You did stolen valor for the escape room.

708
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Well, that's yes, that is true. I didn't think about it like that for a group hang.

709
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
You were part of the group hang. Well, right.

710
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:36,000
So take that away from you. So I go, ah, you guys go ahead and they go, no, come on.

711
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,000
I go, well, I'm out of the costume. I'm out of the fucking jumpsuit or whatever.

712
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
They're like, doesn't matter. Come on.

713
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:50,000
So now we go through and it's basically looks like an aisle at a party city with like just, you know,

714
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,000
not that I was scared of the actual idea. It was just more of like the enclosed spaces.

715
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,000
I was not scared of being attacked by a minute.

716
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:04,000
I swear that is not actually what it was, but it makes you feel even dumber when the lights are on.

717
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,000
There's a tiny like two room building.

718
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:11,000
It's got like wallpaper with brick, like just cheap looking wallpaper with brick.

719
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:18,000
And then a guy who is apparently our original guide wearing just a fucking shitty Minotaur costume, just standing there.

720
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:24,000
And then we go over by like this, like operating like, you know, bride of Frankenstein operating table and take a photo.

721
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,000
And I'm just like, this is this is what your brain kept you from this.

722
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:33,000
These two dumb little shit rooms, which again, I'm sure it was middle school Halloween.

723
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Seemingly well done. Very well done.

724
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:40,000
I just mean like when you see it with the lights on, you go, what is wrong with you?

725
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,000
So imagined fears, I guess.

726
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,000
I mean, I'm sure there's a lot of stuff going on subconsciously, too.

727
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:54,000
But I really I guess just sort of just a general nervousness mixed with whatever that weird face thing I have

728
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:59,000
where I get like weird. And if I am, I'm feeling anxious and I have something on my head.

729
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
You know, this is an insane.

730
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:09,000
What's what's what's so weird about this is how it's like it's it's it's such a specific phobia that I haven't heard of.

731
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,000
And it is provoked like these these serious situations for you.

732
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
But every one of them involves something stupid.

733
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:19,000
One, you're in a bunch of like floppy fake flab prosthetics.

734
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:23,000
One, you're in a race car helmet with Jeremy Piven and another you turn out.

735
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:27,000
You find like a guy in a cheap Minotaur costume.

736
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Every one of them is something really silly to contrast with the very not silly feelings you're feeling.

737
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:38,000
I definitely know what you're talking about with the race car helmet, though, because I in here in beautiful Burbank,

738
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:48,000
there is a indoor go kart like warehouse and go karts go to like their normal size go karts,

739
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,000
but they can get up to like 40 miles per hour.

740
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:55,000
And they put you in a race car helmet and then they're like, and here's your neck brace.

741
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
And I'm like, excuse me.

742
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:02,000
So it's like a padding that goes around your neck to supplement the race car helmet.

743
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:07,000
And no one it was fine because you're just kind of going like in, you know,

744
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:12,000
slightly more complicated in the circles basically than and you get hang of it.

745
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:16,000
You do like 10 laps and after the first lap or two, everyone kind of gets it.

746
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:21,000
But like one or two people were suddenly perpendicular in the track.

747
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,000
So I get why there are helmets.

748
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:29,000
But similarly, yeah, you do it with your I was on Jeremy Piven popped up in your story, too, though.

749
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Yeah, Jeremy Pivens. Yeah, you ran it.

750
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:38,000
I put I started pinball and I dropped my keys and when I popped up, he was playing my pinball game.

751
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Well, that's a real nightmare. He steals quarters. Yeah.

752
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Who's in a California role? Well, he did it, too.

753
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:51,000
He knows that makes you sick. That is that joke is at what?

754
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Ten years old. That is pretty neat. Yes.

755
00:39:53,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Jeremy Piven claimed he had mercury poisoning from eating too much sushi while doing a production of David Mamet's speed the plow on Broadway.

756
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:07,000
But it was like maybe just to get out of doing it. Yeah, he said he was good.

757
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:13,000
He said he had mercury poisoning because he ate sushi like every day and the other three to it's only a three person play.

758
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:18,000
The other two people were Elizabeth Moss and Bobby Cannavale, I think.

759
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Like like actor like real. Sure. Yeah.

760
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:28,000
A actors and your do you don't include Mr. Piven in this list?

761
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
No further comment. That's right.

762
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,000
So look, again, I don't want to say like something.

763
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,000
It's crazy. It's obviously just a funny, dumb thing that happened.

764
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
You know, we went out everything I say.

765
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
I think I saved face.

766
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:50,000
I entered the night by telling Amy Nicholson about the John Travolta Pitbull video three to tango that I'm very fond of.

767
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:55,000
And I think I also I sent her every little step as well from old dogs. Oh, great.

768
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Which you had not seen before covering all those on unspooled.

769
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Now, exactly. They're all they they're inserting them in the top hundred films of all time.

770
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:12,000
I told the anecdote about Pitbull inspiring John Travolta to take the to pay off, which I love is a real fact.

771
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,000
So anyway, so everything is everything is fine.

772
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,000
I think I saved faces that you told this story to someone. Yes.

773
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,000
So it was a happy and happy ending.

774
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Ultimately, I mean, I don't know what they're saying, you know, on their own text chains.

775
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,000
So at the end of the day, I've still the damage is done.

776
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:41,000
I do need to go back to, I guess, conquer the Minotaur at a certain point, but I was not prepared to do it in the days following because the feeling had would linger.

777
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,000
The next day I went to I went to try acupuncture for the first time.

778
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Oh, and you're so afraid of hell.

779
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,000
I made a joke about hell.

780
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:55,000
I was like hell raiser, but it was in my Achilles tendons.

781
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:00,000
I can feel razor was all the pins were just in your your feet after the previous night.

782
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,000
The spirit is you're like, I want to I want to go somewhere beyond pleasure and pain.

783
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,000
OK, yes.

784
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:15,000
So I was in there and while the guys talking to me about everything, I had a like weird like memory like flashback to it.

785
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
And I was like, oh, because I was wearing the mask in there.

786
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,000
I was like, oh, it's a tiny room. I'm going to be on a table.

787
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
I'm going to be stuck there with pins in me for like 30 minutes.

788
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Oh, shit. And then I like recovered and it's fine.

789
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
And, you know, everything's fine.

790
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,000
But then I was like, oh, God, this is is this story enough for an episode?

791
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,000
I go, I need to at least go to I need to do horror nights.

792
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,000
I need to do something to at least redeem myself.

793
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,000
And that was the plan was to go to at least horror nights again.

794
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:42,000
As Jason said, a dependable haunt, you know, something that's not it's what did you call it?

795
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,000
You called it. Oh, I called it meat and potatoes and meat and potatoes.

796
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
I was very polished.

797
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Like, yeah, I I think, yeah, it's a lot of Hollywood, especially Orlando,

798
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Universal Orlando has a lot of original, you know, houses, mazes out here.

799
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:04,000
It's a lot of, you know, the big horror characters, Leatherface, Jason Voorhees,

800
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Michael Myers, Michael Myers, Haunting of Hill House was the big new one on both coasts this year.

801
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Yes, yes. Haunted Haunting of Hill House.

802
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:15,000
So so, yeah, so I was like, OK, I'll do horror nights.

803
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,000
But there was a doubt in my mind.

804
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,000
I had there was a doubt in my mind.

805
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Like, am I going to I don't think so.

806
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,000
You're walking through and I'm not going to get stuck in there.

807
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,000
But I definitely was like, is this going to be weird?

808
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Am I going to be weird when I get there?

809
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,000
So I was pretty like anxious leading up to it.

810
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Now I invited a friend, Jason and Jason, a guy named Tim, Tim Chang to go with me

811
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,000
who works on the show Grand Cru.

812
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:53,000
And I don't want to say I made a mistake, but he immediately was like an hour late or so to meet.

813
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:58,000
So like I was at Anahito's at City Walk like for a while.

814
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
I scarcely see the problem.

815
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
I was good. I love Anahito's.

816
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Yeah, I love Anahito's.

817
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:10,000
And the bar was closing really like I had gotten there and the bar was like I ended up sitting there after close for a while

818
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,000
and the bar was closing and he's like, hey, yeah, you got to order like right now.

819
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
I go, OK.

820
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,000
And I pointed at what I thought was like a margarita flight.

821
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:21,000
It was just three tequila shots.

822
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:25,000
And again, I this was I'm not I did not do that for the show.

823
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
I just literally was like, oh, right.

824
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
This thing is good. Eighteen dollars.

825
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Three things. That's the margarita flight.

826
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
All right. I didn't say that, but I pointed it and he goes, yeah.

827
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
And he comes over. He goes, I want limes with that.

828
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:39,000
And I go, yes. And then I went, oh, all right.

829
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
All right. So I.

830
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:47,000
You're also you're describing the way 95 percent of the people do Halloween Horror Nights.

831
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
It's a good point. Yes.

832
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:57,000
But and I would have preferred if it were like, you know, sipping a cocktail or two before not downing three in a row is pretty.

833
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Yeah, I had a little because I kind of was waiting for Tim.

834
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
I was waiting for a little while.

835
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
So like there was some space in between.

836
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:09,000
OK, but I'm certainly not in tequila shop practice.

837
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
I also just had a beer there.

838
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
I could go in back and forth between.

839
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
You got to get practicing.

840
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
I get in shape at home every night.

841
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Right. At least that anahito's I could get in shape, which is a great establishment.

842
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Let's go get him. I'll go get in shape right now.

843
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,000
OK. Yeah.

844
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Although it was I think it was 10 o'clock is when they stopped serving.

845
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
So we're getting close nightmare.

846
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Yeah. But we can go back.

847
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
I'm willing to go back.

848
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:40,000
So yeah, Tim finally got there and my stomach hurt a little bit from it.

849
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
So we're down. We're at a handicap.

850
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
All right. At the top.

851
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Yeah. And I will say, you know, we're spoiled on this podcast often when we get invited to press events.

852
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
This was not a press event.

853
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,000
This was not this was just, you know, buying a ticket.

854
00:45:54,000 --> 00:46:00,000
And if you don't buy front of the line passes, which are very expensive, the lines are two hours.

855
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Yes. Like 90 minutes, two hours.

856
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:08,000
So we were like, oh, we're going to get in like two houses because it's late already.

857
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:16,000
And then we're like, OK, so if we really don't get anything done, we can get like a frequent fear pass for an extra like seventy five dollars.

858
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
We can come to more nights or whatever.

859
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:24,000
So if we don't get if we don't get all like a lot of stuff done, we can we can do that.

860
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:29,000
But actually, towards the end of the night, we made up a ton of time as people left.

861
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Like our first maze, we waited probably an hour for and then the last three or four, we waited like 20 minutes total for all of them.

862
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Wow. So we ended up doing like everything basically.

863
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
OK. And yeah, I did.

864
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:45,000
I did all of it and I walked through and it was fine.

865
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
I'm fine. OK.

866
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
I'm again, I'm humble.

867
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,000
I'm your humble king of Southern California haunts.

868
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:59,000
Now I've I've learned that hubris is not the way when it comes to bragging about going to haunts and scary things.

869
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
But leaders need to be shaken.

870
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Vulnerability is what makes a great.

871
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:11,000
Yes, it was Trump's great flaw that he refused to admit culpability for thin admit vulnerability.

872
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
That's you know, you're no Trump.

873
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
You're not a king as he aimed to be.

874
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
I have learned a lot from Trump.

875
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,000
Humble king.

876
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Now, when it comes to bragging about haunts, Southern California haunts, I was going to say you were getting surreal, real Trumpy.

877
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,000
Oh, yeah.

878
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,000
No, I know.

879
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Kept away. Kept saying, I know I'm I'm never scared.

880
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Believe me.

881
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Yeah. Oh, you know what?

882
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
I forgot. I'll post a photo of this.

883
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:39,000
I have been wearing this Fitbit for the last month or so.

884
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,000
I noticed that.

885
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:45,000
And the Fitbit, you know, it tracks all the stuff that a Fitbit tracks and attracts your heart rate.

886
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:50,000
And last Wednesday before the Minotaur, I took a look and boy, was that thing high.

887
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Boy, was that in the yellow.

888
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:59,000
It was not quite as high as when I was running, but boy, it had spiked because I wanted to see if I would be like, was it really that bad?

889
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
Oh, yeah, it was.

890
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Formed a little skull shape.

891
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Yes.

892
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Skull and crossbones on my heart rate monitor.

893
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:10,000
And I actually haven't checked it at Horror Nights.

894
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:14,000
I don't think it was nearly like that, but I wonder maybe if it was like going in.

895
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,000
That's an interest.

896
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:18,000
I'll take a look and I'll post that.

897
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:28,000
I was wondering is if you were going to like you, you get there, you take the shots, you're thinking about what happened a few days prior and just the person like checking you in.

898
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
All right.

899
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
So one.

900
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:34,000
And then you just yell, you dirty Minotaur and sock him in the face.

901
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:38,000
I might just be saying until they bleed and then you're kicked out of the park.

902
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,000
That might just be like what happens to like a target employee.

903
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
I just see the Minotaur everywhere.

904
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
It might happen next week.

905
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:48,000
It might happen in 12 years, but everyone be careful.

906
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,000
I'm like for a while it is for several decades.

907
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:56,000
It is interesting that you bring it up because like the trauma of the Minotaur is now with me forever.

908
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,000
You're right.

909
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Like you're right.

910
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:05,000
On some level, maybe it just comes out in like the nursing home and like when I'm like 89 and I'm like, oh, like, whatever.

911
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Are you the Minotaur dear?

912
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,000
And she's like, oh, Michael is talking about the Minotaur again.

913
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Get the get that syringe of sedatives ready because he really can get wild when the Minotaur comes out, when he thinks he sees the Minotaur.

914
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:24,000
I just I don't want to look like a fool in front of people.

915
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,000
I don't know.

916
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,000
It's OK.

917
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,000
You don't look like a fool.

918
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Yeah.

919
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,000
No, the minutes.

920
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Ah, like and then they just have to get on like three people have to get on top of me.

921
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
And then it's a whole thing.

922
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
Mr. Carlson isn't allowed to watch.

923
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
He's not allowed to be in the TV room anymore.

924
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Right.

925
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:44,000
And he thinks he thinks he thinks Wheel of Fortune is all Minotaur's.

926
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,000
He is every letter is a new Minotaur.

927
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:53,000
There's like kids come in to like cheer the old people up wearing costumes and one child is dressed as a Minotaur.

928
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Like a pistol.

929
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
Like I start shooting in the air.

930
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,000
Get out of here.

931
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Minotaur.

932
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,000
You said you were going to screen the costumes.

933
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
That's precisely why I warned you.

934
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:10,000
Yeah, no, it's it's it will rear its head some way.

935
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,000
That is true.

936
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
Don't watch the Shining.

937
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:27,000
That's one of the theories of secret messages in the Shining in that Room 237 documentary is there's a lot of like nods to the you know, history of the Minotaur.

938
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:34,000
There's a poster Jack Torrance essentially becomes the Minotaur going through the hunting Danny at the end of the movie.

939
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Yeah.

940
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,000
Yeah.

941
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,000
All right.

942
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:40,000
Well, that movies, although I've seen it movie, but no rewatching.

943
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,000
No rewatch.

944
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,000
Yeah.

945
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:45,000
You've got your your senses out for Minotaur.

946
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:51,000
Although I will say seeing the Minotaur in regular light, it does take some of the scariness.

947
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Well, can we just to backtrack?

948
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,000
Yeah.

949
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:59,000
I would say what what did it look like in person and in the light?

950
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:05,000
And then maybe how does that contrast with what you pictured in your mind?

951
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
A higher end Minotaur.

952
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,000
I truly I you'll have to believe me when I say I was not picture.

953
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Believe me like Trump.

954
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,000
Folks believe me.

955
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
I wasn't that's and believe me.

956
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:21,000
Like that's the that is what the liar says before he lies.

957
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
So I guess I should not have said believe me.

958
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:28,000
I'm friends with many Minotaur is you'll never find anyone who likes Minotaur is more than believe me.

959
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,000
Believe me.

960
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Believe me.

961
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,000
Believe me.

962
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,000
No.

963
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,000
OK.

964
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,000
Scratch the part where I say believe me.

965
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,000
I did not have an image of what the Minotaur was.

966
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:43,000
I don't think I even am a little like is like he's got like his head's got like a hammerhead shark.

967
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,000
He's got like horns.

968
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,000
Yeah.

969
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,000
I imagine that.

970
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:56,000
Honestly, I imagine the Minotaur sort of being like maybe my height and like just like sort of a bigger guy, big in stature and just sort of imposing.

971
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:01,000
I think the Minotaur was maybe like 511 skinnier than me.

972
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
Damn Minotaur.

973
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
Minotaur working out.

974
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
The Minotaur was in great shape.

975
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
Very.

976
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,000
Yeah.

977
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
Probably could run pretty fast.

978
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,000
Minotaur is a vegan.

979
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,000
Yeah.

980
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
It was a very healthy healthy Minotaur.

981
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
I would say it looked like a health conscious.

982
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
Lean is the perfect word for the Minotaur.

983
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Jason, thank you.

984
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:26,000
So yeah, I didn't really have a vision of the minister.

985
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:34,000
Eva said that when this is also any all this all the details make me feel just even more silly.

986
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:43,000
She said like when the Minotaur would catch you, you would go like, ah, and then he would like lightly touch your shoulders and like turn you around just kind of like nudge you toward where you're supposed to be.

987
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:46,000
You toward where you're supposed to go.

988
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
Oh my God, the Minotaur is here.

989
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:54,000
He's like tapping you and he like suggests the direction in which you will go up a more degrees.

990
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,000
Thank you.

991
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,000
Okay.

992
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:00,000
Which is really what happens when like going to any of these things after a while.

993
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,000
You're like, oh yeah, they're just going to like come up to me and go.

994
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
And you go, yeah, okay.

995
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:11,000
Well, that's why I'm kind of interested because like clearly if they're gently like, all right, now you're out.

996
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:18,000
You go in the cage, you know, they understand the concept of liability and like, well, you can't manhandle them into wall.

997
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:25,000
So I'm surprised they didn't have like a procedure in place for like what happens if someone has a panic attack?

998
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
Can you take them out and bring them back in?

999
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:30,000
I mean, they have they have the X, the X, I got the X.

1000
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,000
They have the X.

1001
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Oh, yeah.

1002
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,000
Okay.

1003
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,000
But they don't.

1004
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:39,000
Yeah, they don't have like a way to integrate them back into society or something like into the group.

1005
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,000
Yes.

1006
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:44,000
This theatrical companies can't help you process what you're going through now.

1007
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,000
There's a okay.

1008
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:50,000
So what they should have done is the guy playing the doctor comes out and he kind of does like a therapy session with me real quick.

1009
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,000
Like, what's the root of this?

1010
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Do you think?

1011
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
And then we get to the bottom of it.

1012
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,000
I solve it.

1013
00:53:55,000 --> 00:54:01,000
And then I go back in now with with the tools to to attack the minutes are let's do the worksheet.

1014
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Is this likely to happen?

1015
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:06,000
Is it possible that it's going to happen or is it the worst case scenario?

1016
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,000
Yeah.

1017
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,000
Yeah.

1018
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:12,000
So do you think is there a childhood thing on your face?

1019
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,000
What do you mean?

1020
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Was there like, I don't know, like what's flashing through my mind is like I wanted to be Batman for Halloween.

1021
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:22,000
And then it's like, but your parents put on the mask backwards.

1022
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:25,000
So for a minute you didn't have your cowl with the big hole in it.

1023
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:30,000
Or was there something worse like a big octopus like jumped on your face?

1024
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,000
I don't know.

1025
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,000
An ocean trip.

1026
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:36,000
Well, like a starro type alien.

1027
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Yeah.

1028
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,000
Yeah.

1029
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
To my face and controlled controlled me for a couple of weeks.

1030
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:43,000
I'm worried that's what you're going to dream about tonight.

1031
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,000
Now I hope not.

1032
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,000
I can't.

1033
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:48,000
I'm glad I watched Suicide Squad before doing this.

1034
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:56,000
Is there a thing like a starro starro is a DC Comics villain and it's a big starfish like shoots little starfish and they attach themselves to your face.

1035
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,000
Oh God.

1036
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:01,000
And then they control you or starro does, I guess.

1037
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,000
That's a good question.

1038
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:16,000
I don't as far as like Halloween costumes as a kid, I always wanted like more stuff on my I feel like I when I was Darkwing Duck, I was really dissatisfied with the homemade like duck beak we made because it was just a flat piece of cardboard.

1039
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:19,000
It was not some three dimensional duck bill.

1040
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:24,000
So I feel like it was always like I was always upset that there weren't more things on my face in general.

1041
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:30,000
I remember I was like the Ninja Turtle and you'd have like the mask with the little plastic like snout the turtle snout.

1042
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
Yeah, yeah, those were just okay.

1043
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,000
But they were fine.

1044
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:36,000
And like there was a kid I think I'm sure I've said this before a kid in my classes.

1045
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:44,000
He's like mom so these like immaculate turtle costumes for second graders with like the full head on his head.

1046
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
And I was like, what the hell?

1047
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
I look like shit.

1048
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:51,000
Like, like it would be so funny because that would have that would be a common thing in Halloween.

1049
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
You're like, I look like shit.

1050
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
And this kid looks fantastic.

1051
00:55:55,000 --> 00:56:06,000
When you said Darkwing Duck, I did flash to having a friend with an immaculate Darkwing Duck costume and how how sad it made me feel that there's just no way was going to I knew I of course I'm never getting anywhere close.

1052
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:12,000
Yeah, I mean the best honestly the best costume I ever wore, maybe the most accurate one.

1053
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,000
It's between two.

1054
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:17,000
It's I was the Mad Hatter from the Batman animated series, which is pretty easy.

1055
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,000
Blue coat, big hat.

1056
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
You can make that easily.

1057
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:27,000
The other one is I think in junior high I was Chris Kattan's famous character as rail abyss the Prince of sorrow from goth talk.

1058
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:32,000
And I look exactly like Chris Kattan in these pictures.

1059
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:35,000
I should find now sketches written by Dennis McNicholas.

1060
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,000
I believe is that right?

1061
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,000
Yeah.

1062
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,000
Wow.

1063
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,000
I think he was a little Florida gothie.

1064
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,000
Wow.

1065
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:44,000
I'm pretty sure that's a great tip for Pete for Halloween.

1066
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
You pick something achievable.

1067
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,000
Yes.

1068
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:51,000
Well, because because everything when you're a kid is like I want to look exactly like this cartoon character.

1069
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:55,000
And it's like that is not going to fly or a cartoon.

1070
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,000
Yeah.

1071
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:00,000
Like we buy my sister and I were Fred Flintstone in Pebbles one year, which was like, you know, fun felt thing.

1072
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
And you can make that outfit pretty easily.

1073
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:08,000
But like I was like kind of looking at my I'm like I don't my face doesn't appear to be like Fred's face.

1074
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
I would I would like to look more like Fred.

1075
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:14,000
And I wish we had like my sister really should have been the great zoo.

1076
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,000
Let's be honest.

1077
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:18,000
See, I would pick a thing and stick with it for like two or three years.

1078
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:23,000
I mean, I think the best one I had was like the Ghostbusters jumpsuit because I already had the toy proton pack.

1079
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,000
That's easy.

1080
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,000
Yeah.

1081
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:29,000
Jumpsuits were sold everywhere like kids like onesie jumpsuit kind of things.

1082
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
And then Ninja Turtles.

1083
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:36,000
I think I was practically wearing Ninja Turtle pajamas and like a felt mask.

1084
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,000
Which which turtle?

1085
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,000
Michelangelo.

1086
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,000
OK.

1087
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,000
And then Ninja Turtle.

1088
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:44,000
God, I feel like I was, but I can't maybe I wasn't.

1089
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,000
I don't know.

1090
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
I was I was two years in a row.

1091
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
I was Michelangelo and I was Rafael the next year.

1092
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:55,000
I think I did a Ninja Turtle face paint at something where I had a lot of pictures taken.

1093
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
But I think maybe not the full physical costume.

1094
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,000
Yeah.

1095
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
Then when I was older, I was getting fucking lazy.

1096
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:03,000
I was like we got a man had her had it up like family party.

1097
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:07,000
I'm wearing this with an old sport coat of my dad's.

1098
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:24,000
And then the next year I was like sport coat and the Frankenstein mask that's been in the garage since the late 80s that my dad when we were kids, he came out wearing once and he went, ah, and we went just started screaming like just started like, ah, and I was like, I'm going to use that.

1099
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:31,000
And then in college, I was the super exhausting guy and I was not the only one at parties dressed like Hunter Thompson.

1100
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,000
But that was a very easy.

1101
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:35,000
You just needed a bucket hat, an aviators and a cigarette.

1102
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:39,000
And I encountered numerous other Hawaiian shirt.

1103
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
Hunter Thompson, I think you're bringing this up.

1104
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
Call you bring this memory back up.

1105
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:49,000
I'm pretty sure there's a picture of me that I have where I said my costume was Ari Gold from on.

1106
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:53,000
Whoa, pretty sure all ties together.

1107
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
So it all ties together.

1108
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
I'll tell you this easy steer men in black.

1109
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,000
Easy.

1110
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,000
Oh, that's yeah, that's easy.

1111
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Old suit.

1112
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,000
Got it.

1113
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,000
Sunglasses done.

1114
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
I like suit with the black Ray Bans on.

1115
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,000
Yeah.

1116
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,000
Yeah.

1117
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,000
Nod your nod your head.

1118
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
Everyone was nodding their head.

1119
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:16,000
Your head and then the superior song to according to Jason, obviously, the man according to the world now.

1120
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,000
Yeah.

1121
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,000
Yeah.

1122
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:25,000
I don't have we in all these haunt cast years, have we not just posted old Halloween photos?

1123
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,000
Maybe not.

1124
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:42,000
That seems like pretty basic and we should because and I'll I'll go find my it was certainly not my best costume, but I was it was my favorite was this when I was Indiana Jones one year and it was there was entirely off of the ride.

1125
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
It was the year that the ride was.

1126
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:47,000
I was obsessed with the ride.

1127
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:56,000
Despite being like so so wimpy to go on at the first screaming the entire ride.

1128
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:01,000
I'm having a Minotaur moment or a Lindsay on the tower.

1129
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:07,000
It's really I was always embarrassed to the point where my dad is like you have to not OK.

1130
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
Do you want to like 10 11?

1131
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:10,000
OK.

1132
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:15,000
Too old for that and like why are he's just a why are we waiting for hours and you're going to do this?

1133
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:28,000
I like so bad so wimpy but then you know loved it obviously and then I got to be Indiana Jones this year and I think that I didn't even try to find a brown jacket.

1134
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:32,000
I think I think it was like a like a Navy green basically.

1135
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:49,000
The color is not even right and then it's just kind of like a regular fedora just like you know should be in a school guys and dolls production and it's so that's the costume and then I think I had a rubber snake and that I just I don't know what would I why would I have that?

1136
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:50,000
You don't want this.

1137
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,000
I want to be anywhere.

1138
01:00:51,000 --> 01:01:01,000
The last thing I should be holding right from Indiana Jones and then I just kind of put like soot on my face a little like I got like like banged up or was you know going through a cave or something and this.

1139
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:17,000
I'll try to find this photo because what what I think I look like at this age versus what I look I'm doing this face that's like like I think I'm a minotaur and then like I am just the reddest little cherub.

1140
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:24,000
It is like it is the least tough photo ever taken and it was ride based.

1141
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:31,000
Yeah, because I think I probably had seen one of the movies but then I was after that then I like plowed through.

1142
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:38,000
Yeah, that's interesting because I never I mean I never even thought of it as a kid to go ride based for a costume.

1143
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
That's pretty deep.

1144
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:43,000
I mean even that is not you know it's that's on the line.

1145
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:44,000
It's movies too.

1146
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,000
Sure, that's true.

1147
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:55,000
I think you got to be pretty we I think we were all into the parks early on but I think to be like I'm dream finder and you're eight is that's pretty quick to the chase.

1148
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,000
That's true.

1149
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
Did you ever do a parks costume?

1150
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:59,000
No, never.

1151
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:14,000
I mean the the parks were things that I did with my family's like we went this summer and then I came back and I'm like well can I have to cherish these memories and souvenirs for a few more years until we go back again and speak of it to no one and speak.

1152
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
I'll never know anyone who likes any of this.

1153
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:34,000
I remember one time I ran into someone I went to school with in Florida at a park and I thought we I think everyone had the like oh hello hi and then we just kind of went on our way like it wasn't it wasn't a person I was very close with but yeah I didn't I didn't talk about it at all.

1154
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:39,000
I think you both were in some seedy environment you didn't want to even talk and like acknowledge each other.

1155
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:42,000
Yes.

1156
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:49,000
Like all right don't tell my wife if you don't tell your like just keep this quiet if you know what I'm saying here.

1157
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:54,000
We still haven't nobody's done parks based costume oh well I was Captain EO one year.

1158
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,000
Uh huh.

1159
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:56,000
Sure.

1160
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,000
So that counts I guess.

1161
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
Yeah I'm trying to I don't know I haven't really done too much.

1162
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:05,000
I have been a Ninja Turtle in my adult years and I looked even shittier than when I did as a child.

1163
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:12,000
Wait this let me bring it back around I have the theory of when you were saying all that you couldn't get enough stuff on my face.

1164
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,000
Is that the root of it.

1165
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:27,000
Oh is it bringing me is it this inverse shame of like that you wanted to have as much stuff on your face as possible to complete an illusion and it brings you back to the shame of not being able to and now you don't want to get anywhere near it you don't want anything.

1166
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
Anything at all on your face.

1167
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:32,000
Yeah do you have a third act resolution to your trauma.

1168
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
We got to solve it during this podcast length.

1169
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:42,000
I mean I really if I'm trying to psychoanalyze myself I don't think it's I don't think it's that I just want so much stuff on my face all the time.

1170
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,000
Doesn't seem right.

1171
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:44,000
Doesn't seem right.

1172
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,000
Doesn't seem like something anyone would want.

1173
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:59,000
If I was like maybe like Johnny Depp and I had like six ear piercing and earrings and like Steve Scarf like Steven Tyler's scarves and like uh like Bono sunglasses like a combination of all my favorite people on the planet.

1174
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:00,000
Yeah.

1175
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,000
Coolest best people.

1176
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:02,000
The coolest guys.

1177
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:09,000
Sunglasses and then like I don't know like a little Steven sort of like babushka that he wears.

1178
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:13,000
Maybe then I think that would be right but I don't think so.

1179
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:14,000
I don't have a lot of stuff.

1180
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:17,000
I'm wearing headphones now but that's just now you have to.

1181
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:18,000
It's practical.

1182
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:28,000
I got a like we're in my garage and I got like my like costume crates up there you know from various videos or sketches or whatever it is.

1183
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:31,000
I just start putting let's just conquer it now.

1184
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
I'll just start spirit gumming everything I got.

1185
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:36,000
It doesn't even have to like line up to wear a mustache.

1186
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:40,000
You already got facial hair so let's just like put mustaches willy nilly all over your cheeks.

1187
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
And then you have to set me covering your eyes.

1188
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
Then set me loose in your dark house.

1189
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
That I think is the extra element to it.

1190
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:51,000
Is that I have to be set loose in a place that I don't know exactly where I am and the layout is.

1191
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
Find a way out.

1192
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:54,000
Yeah.

1193
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
To try not to wake a child.

1194
01:04:56,000 --> 01:05:06,000
Well I guess I should have known this was a path to having my family murdered while a die minotaur was screamed.

1195
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:10,000
I could have guessed that from miles away and yet I let it happen.

1196
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
So it's eggs on my face.

1197
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,000
Yeah.

1198
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:14,000
No it's your fault.

1199
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:15,000
So we can quit.

1200
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:16,000
What's that?

1201
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
Oh I was going to say so highlights of Horror Nights.

1202
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,000
Oh sure.

1203
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:20,000
What did you enjoy?

1204
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,000
Yeah.

1205
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:24,000
Horror Nights is yeah you were saying Horror Nights is very much kind of like standard like not sticks.

1206
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,000
Obviously they have original IP.

1207
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:28,000
They get a little more license to do stuff.

1208
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:39,000
I'd also say like they I don't know why I'm starting out by criticizing Universal again but they get they just have some different like stuff that surprises me more than Universal.

1209
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:44,000
Now Universal has a couple things like what's the Pandora's Box maze.

1210
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,000
That's an original thing.

1211
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
And I feel like that one's the best.

1212
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,000
You watched all these as well.

1213
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
I yeah I believe I saw that one.

1214
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:55,000
Yeah they have been dabbling the last few years in like one or two original mazes.

1215
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
Yeah and that one is like really kind of stark.

1216
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:03,000
There's like a lot of neon paint and like you're going through ruins and there's like skeleton people reaching out at you.

1217
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:16,000
And then there's like some sort of like I don't know what the legend is but some sort of God and he's a man he's kind of like a lot of the you know gags or whatever you call it or like is that a real person or is that a statue.

1218
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:26,000
And there's a man like kind of sitting on a throne and he's very very still and he stands up and he's wearing stilts so he's giant all of it like you don't even kind of realize it.

1219
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
You think like OK maybe that's just like a dummy.

1220
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,000
Oh wait he stood up.

1221
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:37,000
He is eight feet tall and now he is like like waving his arms at me and I kind of run past him.

1222
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:45,000
Yeah so like that one I think might have been our both of our favorites going through it because it was a little unexpected because they sometimes like with Exorcist.

1223
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
And we had just watched or rewatched it.

1224
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:48,000
Have you guys seen Exorcist.

1225
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,000
I've never seen it.

1226
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:50,000
A long time ago.

1227
01:06:50,000 --> 01:07:07,000
They kind of do a thing with Exorcist where the maze where it's basically doing like it's progressing through the movie because so much of the movie or the climax of the movie is the little girl in the bed just going through this transformation.

1228
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:10,000
The priest comes he tries to perform the exorcism.

1229
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
Spoiler alert people die.

1230
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:14,000
She's vomiting.

1231
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,000
She's twisting her head around.

1232
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:16,000
There's all this different crazy stuff.

1233
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:21,000
So you kind of go and see four different versions of the bedroom scene.

1234
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:32,000
So you go in and she's just in there once you go through this like hallway where like spirits are like you know again like throwing their arms at you and then you go into the bedroom now she's even more possessed even more.

1235
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:35,000
And then like the fourth scene is like the priest is dead on the bed.

1236
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
She's screaming at you.

1237
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:40,000
There's some one really like giving all their energy.

1238
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
So like that's cool.

1239
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:46,000
That's that's cool for different especially if you're like an Exorcist fan.

1240
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:50,000
But it's like not as surprising I guess.

1241
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:51,000
Yeah.

1242
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
As some as like an original thing.

1243
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:57,000
They had Halloween for which I have not seen.

1244
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
I've only seen the first two Halloween.

1245
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:00,000
Have you seen Halloween?

1246
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:01,000
Yeah.

1247
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:08,000
Last year we watched the David Gordon Green one and then we watched the original one and then we watched the original one.

1248
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:18,000
And then we watched the original one and then Halloween to this the Wes Craven sequel Halloween three is season of the witch where there is no Michael.

1249
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:19,000
Yeah right.

1250
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
Michael Halloween four is when Michael's back.

1251
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:22,000
Yes.

1252
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:31,000
And I just I was just talking to this friend or this could sidetrack us which is fine I'm sure because Michael Myers mask is a William Shatner mask.

1253
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:32,000
Oh yeah.

1254
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:33,000
Which I was like oh you.

1255
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
Does he mad about that.

1256
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:36,000
I'm just looking up and it seems like he is.

1257
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:37,000
I think he is mad.

1258
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:38,000
He's never got any money from that.

1259
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:46,000
It's like I was driving down Lancashire to Horror Nights and there's a big poster for the new Halloween and I'm looking at them like it is just William Shatner space.

1260
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
Never stared at it with that thought.

1261
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:49,000
I always forget who it is.

1262
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:53,000
I know it's when you think about it you will never not see it ever again.

1263
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:57,000
It's William Shatner who is going into space when this comes out he will have already been back.

1264
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
He's going to space tomorrow.

1265
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:00,000
I'm sure he's going to space tomorrow.

1266
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:05,000
He's going on Jeff Bezos is Blue Origin spaceship tomorrow at like 5 a.m.

1267
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:06,000
He's 90 years old.

1268
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:07,000
Oh my God.

1269
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:10,000
He is going into space for 15 minutes tomorrow.

1270
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
Will have happened.

1271
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:13,000
Will have happened.

1272
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:18,000
This is you were describing we've talked about our desire to not kill.

1273
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:21,000
This is the worst recipe for.

1274
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:22,000
Oh no.

1275
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:25,000
Elderly man in space.

1276
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
Here's the thing though you guys enjoy.

1277
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:28,000
You guys will never hear this.

1278
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,000
If something bad happens.

1279
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:30,000
Fastest cut.

1280
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,000
This will be cut.

1281
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:34,000
Well I can't wait for him to land safely so you can hear this.

1282
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:35,000
Yes.

1283
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:36,000
He must.

1284
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:37,000
He will.

1285
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:38,000
He will love it.

1286
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:39,000
So yeah.

1287
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
Halloween for Michael Myers is scare.

1288
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:44,000
I am pretty scared of Michael Myers I think in general.

1289
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:51,000
I think like like what you say you're more scared of Michael Myers or Freddy Krueger because I think Michael Myers even though Freddy Krueger is grosser.

1290
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
He's still like more like silly.

1291
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:54,000
He's affable you know.

1292
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:55,000
I think.

1293
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:56,000
It might be Michael.

1294
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:59,000
I haven't watched a lot of the nightmare on Elm Street.

1295
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:02,000
I don't know what show the fine streaming services have them right now.

1296
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:05,000
But HBO Max has the Freddy movies.

1297
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
And Peacock has Halloween.

1298
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:08,000
No it's Peacock.

1299
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:14,000
The Halloween movies at least the early ones might be buoyed by just Wes Craven is so good.

1300
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,000
The music is so good.

1301
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:16,000
Yeah.

1302
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:20,000
He's such a good director especially that first one where he's doing so much with so little.

1303
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:21,000
I watch Nightmare on Elm Street.

1304
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:22,000
I watch it.

1305
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
And I was like this is a pretty good movie too.

1306
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:27,000
Like this is a good like the music is pretty cool.

1307
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:30,000
I like a lot of those silly early ones.

1308
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:33,000
And they're like synthy soundtracks like which are fun.

1309
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:37,000
And yeah it's like got some scares and it's gross and whatever.

1310
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:46,000
And yeah so but I think I'm more scared of Michael Myers although I guess if it was like a Freddy Krueger maze maybe I would be more grossed out by Freddy Krueger.

1311
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:48,000
Because he's grosser.

1312
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
Freddy versus Michael versus Minotaur.

1313
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:54,000
Freddy versus Michael Carlson versus Minotaur.

1314
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:58,000
Yeah no that is that'll be my nightmare tonight.

1315
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:02,000
It will not be out how Freddy Krueger can attack you in his dreams.

1316
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:05,000
Minotaur can attack me in my dreams.

1317
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:10,000
The Minotaur will be haunting me and I will have to like trap it and bring it to the real world.

1318
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:14,000
So if I see a slain Minotaur on my porch tomorrow.

1319
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:15,000
Yeah you'll know.

1320
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:18,000
Well alright well good for Mike.

1321
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:22,000
Wish me luck because I got to go in the dream world.

1322
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:26,000
I got to go in the void and kill a fucking Minotaur.

1323
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
Okay fun.

1324
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:33,000
So Michael Myers they they they they they they they they they have a lot of fun.

1325
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:37,000
I mean like they're like a good little group of people.

1326
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:38,000
Okay fun.

1327
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:47,000
The so Michael Myers they they it is really it is unnerving to see Michael Myers like just waving the knife at you.

1328
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:55,000
And they do a thing and it's kind of they do the same gag or I keep calling him gags whatever trick or same kind of type scares.

1329
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
Thank you.

1330
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:03,000
Where you know there's a lot of again static figures and I think I said this on one of the other Haunt episodes.

1331
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:15,000
Nothing actually freaks my brain out more than when I step into a room and I see like five static figures and I'm just I'm like so fast trying to figure out who's a person.

1332
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:16,000
Yeah.

1333
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:27,000
And I go oh god like I'm like I'm trying to figure out immediately and they do this trick at the end of the Halloween four maze and it's it all of a sudden we turn and we're in like a hall of mirrors.

1334
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:31,000
And I go oh no.

1335
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:35,000
So I'm like seeing Michael Myers here and there or whatever.

1336
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:49,000
And then you turn down a corridor and there are five of them or five Michael Myers and I'm walking through and to answer the question I immediately had of how many of them are real.

1337
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
All five of them are real.

1338
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:52,000
Oh.

1339
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:59,000
They all come to life right at the end waving their arms at you like ah like run right out and I'm in the exit.

1340
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:02,000
And I was like all right that was pretty good at the end.

1341
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
And they have a similar one.

1342
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:20,000
I forget which one they do a similar thing only with like characters in paintings where all of a sudden there's five people in this little tiny space lunging their arms at you right at the very end before it which leaves you going oh good.

1343
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:28,000
You're feeling these like you're getting the jolts you're getting the that you're getting what you had in 2019.

1344
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:29,000
Yes.

1345
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:32,000
If you're asking did I get my mojo back a little bit.

1346
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:33,000
Yes.

1347
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:38,000
Like Austin Powers I did feel my mojo coming back.

1348
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:39,000
Not fully.

1349
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
Did you pop?

1350
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:42,000
Did they make you pop?

1351
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,000
Did the monsters make you pop?

1352
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:46,000
I popped for the end of that Halloween maze.

1353
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:50,000
I popped for the stilt man on Pandora's box.

1354
01:13:50,000 --> 01:14:00,000
I popped for like the really like rock and roll Bride of Frankenstein lives like soundtrack like the slash like the whole time you're in there.

1355
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,000
I was like this is good.

1356
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:02,000
I like this.

1357
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:05,000
There's a tall man in Hill House too.

1358
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:06,000
Yes.

1359
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:14,000
There is a tall man and then Frankenstein Frankenstein's monster makes an appearance at the very end of the the Bride of Frankenstein lives.

1360
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:19,000
And he is very tall as well and lunged at me and I was disappointed that he didn't lunge at me more.

1361
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
I was like I like Frankenstein.

1362
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
I'm such a Frankenstein mark.

1363
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,000
Yeah.

1364
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:28,000
I popped for Frankenstein at the end is what I'm saying.

1365
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:29,000
Yes.

1366
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:33,000
But there's a tall man in Hill House and I did not watch I watched a little of you saw the whole Netflix.

1367
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:38,000
I watched the whole thing and I and read the book right around the same time.

1368
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:39,000
Yeah.

1369
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:42,000
Because Lindsay and I were talking in an episode about the book and I sent her.

1370
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:43,000
Yeah.

1371
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
We know you read guys.

1372
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:46,000
La la la.

1373
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
Push those glasses up Dexter.

1374
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:49,000
I did.

1375
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:50,000
To be fair Jason did.

1376
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:51,000
These are really aging.

1377
01:14:51,000 --> 01:15:06,000
I sent this tweet to her because at the Universal Orlando there is a tent called Nell's Tea Party Sandwiches which is very funny in the context of Hill House because the show is this very like long drawn out.

1378
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:07,000
Right.

1379
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:08,000
Yes.

1380
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:09,000
Creepy.

1381
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:13,000
The books even more like long generational trauma.

1382
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:16,000
The ghosts are like bad memories and stuff.

1383
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:20,000
And then the very first thing on the menu stuffed brisket.

1384
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:25,000
And then the last thing on the menu Luke's grilled cheese traditional grilled cheese.

1385
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:28,000
So kind of runs the gamut.

1386
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:29,000
Right.

1387
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:35,000
Was there what item you would have preferred if you had gone.

1388
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:42,000
Like like if you could make like a cucumber sandwich of misery.

1389
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
Cucumber sandwich and they asked you.

1390
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
You're inventing one.

1391
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:47,000
Yeah.

1392
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
I mean I probably the tempeh Reuben.

1393
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:50,000
I like tempeh.

1394
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
Is there is is.

1395
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:55,000
If you're asking what's on the menu I probably would have gone with the tempeh Reuben.

1396
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
I don't really like barbecue and beef.

1397
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
If you bring now that you bring it up though from watching Hill House.

1398
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:00,000
Yeah.

1399
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:01,000
Is there is like the blue milk.

1400
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:06,000
Is there a Hill House delicacy that you were just dreaming of trying like heroin.

1401
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:09,000
I mean I guess they do heroin.

1402
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:10,000
The one guy.

1403
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:11,000
Yeah.

1404
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:12,000
The one guy used to do heroin.

1405
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:17,000
I mean that's what was funny to me about watching the Hill House footage is that the show is

1406
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:24,000
like long takes monologues creeping music and then occasionally like a ghoul.

1407
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:31,000
And then the haunted house like has a pretty cool facade inside but immediately blasting

1408
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:36,000
you with music and screams and loud voices because that's one of the tricks of these

1409
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:40,000
mazes is that they throw you off the guard with a sonic assault right at the beginning.

1410
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:41,000
Right.

1411
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:42,000
Yeah.

1412
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:46,000
Well they all all the especially horror nights all of the scares and I'm probably repeating

1413
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:51,000
myself from two years ago all the scares are punctuated by and I believe we figured out

1414
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:54,000
I think that they're controlled by the scare actors.

1415
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:58,000
So and I think we noticed there was at least for a few people there was like a little maybe

1416
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:02,000
monitor like maybe a infrared or not or no what do you call it.

1417
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:03,000
Yeah.

1418
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:04,000
Infrared night vision night vision.

1419
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:05,000
Thank you.

1420
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:10,000
Where you they could see in the dark who was coming because like certain people if you're

1421
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:14,000
in a little window you're going to be throwing your arms out and you can't hit someone in

1422
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:15,000
the head.

1423
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:20,000
So you have to kind of be able to see in the dark that no one's in front of you to be able

1424
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
to throw your arms out there.

1425
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:29,000
And then I think also self cue the very loud like string hit and maybe a scream and then

1426
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:32,000
turn the light on so they can see you.

1427
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:38,000
So they're kind of like doing this little like they're kind of like working working

1428
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:41,000
like equipment kind of in a V booth.

1429
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:42,000
Exactly.

1430
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:46,000
So yeah if you're if they're doing one of those jump scares in a hallway or something

1431
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:51,000
they have to do more than just the people walking around like playing the priest or

1432
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:56,000
playing you know like the Bride of Frankenstein who's just like in a crazy like room and like

1433
01:17:56,000 --> 01:18:02,000
reacting to the electricity and then like waving scissors at my neck like she doesn't

1434
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:06,000
have to work a button I don't think.

1435
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
But yeah yeah that's that's a big part of it.

1436
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:15,000
I should say this and this was very well I guess not very exciting but good to get to

1437
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:21,000
the Halloween for maze you have to walk through an empty water world theater.

1438
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
Oh yeah.

1439
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:27,000
So you walk all the way around it and then you walk all the way kind of through it and

1440
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:33,000
it's completely empty and desolate and then you get to the Halloween for entrance which

1441
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:38,000
thematically I don't know by the employee break through the office building where you

1442
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:39,000
do H.R.

1443
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:44,000
Yeah like the H.R. people had to go to a different building and then.

1444
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:49,000
And then yeah so so it is fun to see where all the different things are positioned because

1445
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:56,000
like they open up the like they open up the area behind Hogsmeade in the Harry Potter

1446
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
land for a bunch of mazes.

1447
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:03,000
You walk straight back there and I don't even know the geography it's obviously somewhere

1448
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:07,000
on the back lot behind City Walk but like the bunch of mazes over there there's a maze

1449
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:13,000
over by Waterworld there's a maze by like the French like street that's where the Bride

1450
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:16,000
of Frankenstein lives is and all that junk over there.

1451
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:19,000
Yeah well they have secret life pets not far from there now.

1452
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:25,000
No that part's not yeah yeah but there's like a weird unfocused like uh huh.

1453
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
Well there was like the world area with nothing to do.

1454
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:31,000
Yeah exactly so like but there were like they sort of had like evil Cirque du Soleil

1455
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:36,000
performers walking around so I was like you know this is actually kind of on point.

1456
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
I actually appreciate this.

1457
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:43,000
So yeah I mean it was good I felt I felt at the end I go okay all right you're not you

1458
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000
haven't totally lost it.

1459
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
Yeah doesn't seem like it.

1460
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:53,000
And it is fun there's a lot of there's a lot of dubstep going on outside loud dubstep.

1461
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:54,000
Great good.

1462
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:59,000
Which I do like again I like a douchey pool party in Las Vegas so hearing loud dubstep

1463
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:00,000
makes me happy.

1464
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:04,000
I'm confused by that one I don't know what's what makes you like that.

1465
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:08,000
I mean it depends I mean there's there's better versions of it than others but I don't

1466
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:15,000
know I like sipping a cocktail and being like just pummeled with music and in the water.

1467
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
I like that I don't know why.

1468
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:20,000
You don't want to relax.

1469
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:21,000
I like that too.

1470
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:22,000
Okay okay.

1471
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:26,000
I like that too yeah but it all depends if it's like crazy.

1472
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
I also like a crazy looking scene.

1473
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:33,000
I think I do like I enjoy like watching a weird scene like that.

1474
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:39,000
Well I I had the experience in the summer at a Vegas pool like I went down once in the

1475
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:44,000
afternoon and they were playing like yeah Bruno Mars or whatever like very loud and

1476
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:48,000
then I went the next day at like eight or nine in the morning it was just very like

1477
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
quiet jazz.

1478
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:54,000
Like they have different playlists for like different types of day and I'm like oh that's

1479
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:57,000
really smart.

1480
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:02,000
So so yeah I would if yeah if you're on the fence horror nights they got the vaccine

1481
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:07,000
mandates you got to show you now look is this a foolproof system.

1482
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:08,000
I don't think so.

1483
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:11,000
I flashed my phone at someone and they went huh yeah okay.

1484
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:14,000
There wasn't exactly like a background search.

1485
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:17,000
They didn't test my blood to see.

1486
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
Oh Moderna yeah okay go through.

1487
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:20,000
They scanned you.

1488
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:21,000
Yeah they did.

1489
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:24,000
All right he's got the Moderna chips in his system.

1490
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:25,000
Yeah yeah.

1491
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
He's got the Johnson and Johnson government.

1492
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:31,000
The trackers says let him through.

1493
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:35,000
Yeah yeah I can see that his blood is a bit cowardly tonight.

1494
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,000
But other than that he's vaccinated.

1495
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:42,000
You know one of those shitty right wing theme park Twitter accounts was just saying like

1496
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:46,000
universal attendance plummets in wake of vaccine.

1497
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:49,000
Guys what are you trying to do.

1498
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:50,000
What.

1499
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:51,000
Why.

1500
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:54,000
What is the end game of combining right wing politics.

1501
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:55,000
With theme park.

1502
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:59,000
Maybe these things aren't supposed to go together.

1503
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
Walter not.

1504
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,000
And no it's not supposed to go together.

1505
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:06,000
But he got what because he took care of it 50 years.

1506
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:07,000
Yeah yeah yeah.

1507
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:08,000
And Walter Disney.

1508
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:11,000
Yeah yeah yeah.

1509
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
He just you know subtly.

1510
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,000
But he didn't have a freedom center.

1511
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:21,000
It's what they managed to take time out of their busy schedule of eight Johnny Depp posts

1512
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:27,000
a day to trade about how universal is effectively killed their entire theme park business with

1513
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:30,000
a vaccine mandate that they don't really enforce.

1514
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:34,000
I will say I will say universal's Horror Nights was sold out.

1515
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:37,000
It was hacked of course.

1516
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:40,000
There was no problem as far as I could tell of them selling.

1517
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:45,000
I have I have been struggling with like going to theme parks and like oh that's right.

1518
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:48,000
This is what full attendance feels like.

1519
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:49,000
This keeps happening.

1520
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:50,000
I love it.

1521
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
Like SeaWorld was so crowded.

1522
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:57,000
I'm like oh God I really miss these like the cramped only 30 percent allowed.

1523
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:00,000
Not even for like health and safety reasons.

1524
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:03,000
Just like oh man I hate the crowd so much.

1525
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:07,000
We try you know we actually inquired at the start we were like oh how much is that front of the line pass.

1526
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,000
They were like we are sold out of that.

1527
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:10,000
We can not give you one.

1528
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:11,000
Oh wow.

1529
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:12,000
OK.

1530
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:13,000
Fuck you for asking.

1531
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:14,000
Don't even look at us.

1532
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:15,000
They were upset.

1533
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:16,000
But we can't.

1534
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:17,000
We should really wrap up here.

1535
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:22,000
But yeah Disneyland is getting crazy and everyone said like oh and fast pass goes away.

1536
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:25,000
It's actually going to be better because the lines are going to be not long anymore.

1537
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,000
So that's bullshit right.

1538
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:33,000
Well I know there were people complaining a week or two ago that it's like there were no reservations available.

1539
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
And I went to bed.

1540
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
I didn't find October was mostly booked for me.

1541
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:38,000
I went to bed.

1542
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:39,000
I woke up.

1543
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:40,000
There was a bunch of open days.

1544
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:41,000
So I took it.

1545
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:44,000
And then the next day there were even more open days.

1546
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:45,000
And I am down there.

1547
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:46,000
Yeah I was complaining.

1548
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:47,000
All right.

1549
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:48,000
I was down there.

1550
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
It was like the most crowded day I had seen in years.

1551
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:53,000
And I'm like take reservation like make the pool smaller.

1552
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:54,000
What are you doing.

1553
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:55,000
Don't know.

1554
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:56,000
Don't add more availability.

1555
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:57,000
It's not working.

1556
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:58,000
Whatever the current availability.

1557
01:23:58,000 --> 01:23:59,000
Yeah.

1558
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:00,000
I mean I have a lot of thoughts about it.

1559
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:01,000
But we'll do that somewhere else.

1560
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:02,000
I do want to say OK I want to wrap up here.

1561
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:03,000
I do want to say next year we already talked a little bit.

1562
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:04,000
Next year we're going to have a lot of people coming in.

1563
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:05,000
We're going to have a lot of people coming in.

1564
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:06,000
We're going to have a lot of people coming in.

1565
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:07,000
We're going to have a lot of people coming in.

1566
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:08,000
We're going to have a lot of people coming in.

1567
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,000
I do want to say OK I want to wrap up here.

1568
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:14,000
I do want to say next year we already talked a little bit next year.

1569
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:21,000
Secret episode secret ambitious episode Jason getting brave fright fest 2.

And I will I would like to conquer a minute are somewhere.

1571
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
I don't know if it's a different escape room.

1572
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:29,000
Maybe it doesn't even happen.

1573
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,000
I'll maybe happens before.

1574
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:37,000
But I will conquer the minotaur whether it's a literal minotaur or just the minotaur of a horror escape room.

1575
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,000
Beating up a high school football team.

1576
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:43,000
I'm going to be the minotaurs beating up the minotaur.

1577
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:48,000
I drive my car or the football field beat up a high school football mascot.

1578
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,000
That's funny.

1579
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:52,000
The Smiths like a clip show or something.

1580
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:56,000
That's like a viral video of like mascot fight.

1581
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:57,000
Yeah.

1582
01:24:57,000 --> 01:25:00,000
Drunken fan punches mascot.

1583
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:06,000
If you don't want to victimize anybody in particular you could just get like get a big fight.

1584
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:09,000
Get a minotaur costume.

1585
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:13,000
Fill it up with fluff and garbage and then like tackle it.

1586
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:14,000
OK.

1587
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:18,000
You know well I could be that's that seems like great live show material to me.

1588
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:19,000
Everybody cheers you on.

1589
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:22,000
Well you point to demolish a minotaur.

1590
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
We can fill it with blood bags.

1591
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:29,000
Also we will fill whatever menu this is.

1592
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,000
And Largo's stage will run right.

1593
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,000
This is a Largo.

1594
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:34,000
Yeah.

1595
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
Here's the show.

1596
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:39,000
How is scary farm.

1597
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:40,000
Oh that's good.

1598
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:41,000
We didn't do a ton there.

1599
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,000
We honestly we spent so much time.

1600
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:44,000
That was not.

1601
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:48,000
I should mention more of nots because that's what it's always nice enough to invite us.

1602
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:57,000
And they had a big dubstep but also like 90s pop music loud outdoor like have fun and food and drink.

1603
01:25:57,000 --> 01:26:01,000
And we spent most of our time there.

1604
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:04,000
We were we certainly had a few scares there but we were like this is great.

1605
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:07,000
We're having a really good time listening to loud music.

1606
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:10,000
I didn't even it's over like kind of that.

1607
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:18,000
I mean there's a lot of corners of nots where you're like I don't know really where we are but it was like deep in the corner like when you come and go to the right.

1608
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:19,000
Yeah.

1609
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:20,000
Nots was fun.

1610
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:23,000
We did so many the maze were the same and we were still like I don't know.

1611
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,000
No one's wearing a mask in these mazes.

1612
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:28,000
We were like well let's not do a ton of things.

1613
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:34,000
But we got scared by people on this like there were still tons of scare actors out as you go through those like scare zones.

1614
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:38,000
We did of course our beloved Halloween version.

1615
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:43,000
I think Scott you did this as well of the log flume of the name of it.

1616
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,000
I don't think Timber Mountain log.

1617
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:46,000
Timber Mountain.

1618
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:47,000
Thank you.

1619
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:48,000
My brain shot.

1620
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
The bear did not say trick or treat to us.

1621
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:53,000
Did he say it to you.

1622
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:54,000
I did.

1623
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:55,000
Why didn't do it this year.

1624
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:56,000
Oh you didn't.

1625
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:57,000
So I couldn't tell you.

1626
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:03,000
The bear I don't know if he was broken but as we said a couple of years ago we love this bear who says trick or treat.

1627
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,000
The opposite of the Minotaur.

1628
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:06,000
Yeah.

1629
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:07,000
So that was great.

1630
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:08,000
And nots is fun.

1631
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:16,000
We also saw and oh man we're running over here but we also saw the new version of the man tea party.

1632
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
Now what is this like a literal band.

1633
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:19,000
It's the band.

1634
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:20,000
Yes it is.

1635
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:25,000
And I totally was not prepared to talk about this but I'm trying and I'm trying to remember the name of the band.

1636
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,000
But they did like enter saying yeah look it up.

1637
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:32,000
They did like enter saying they did some old mad tea party favorites like enter Sandman.

1638
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:33,000
Like the chicken dance.

1639
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:34,000
They did.

1640
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:35,000
YMCA.

1641
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,000
They're not a wedding band.

1642
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:38,000
Of a Nagila.

1643
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:39,000
No no.

1644
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:40,000
They're cool.

1645
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:41,000
They play cool music.

1646
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:45,000
They played rhythm nation remember and you were impressed by that when we did it.

1647
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:48,000
Like you're a little overstating how impressed.

1648
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:51,000
You were clicking on to any any positive reaction.

1649
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:54,000
You were blown away when I said they did rhythm nation.

1650
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
Skr song rhythm nation.

1651
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:57,000
Yeah they did.

1652
01:27:57,000 --> 01:28:00,000
Let's let's go crazy.

1653
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:03,000
No they did not play that at Nats but they were doing darker.

1654
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:07,000
They were doing darker songs you know like the Foo Fighters the Pretender.

1655
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:12,000
Which is like that's a song about a costume heavier song.

1656
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
Anyone wearing a costume is a pretender.

1657
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:18,000
That's a very good point and that's probably the thought process behind it.

1658
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:19,000
Jason have you found it.

1659
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:20,000
Yes.

1660
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
Carnival do grotesque featuring hiatus.

1661
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:23,000
Yes.

1662
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:24,000
The name of the band hiatus.

1663
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:29,000
I believe on the big main stage it is Carnival did grotesque.

1664
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:30,000
Is that what it is.

1665
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:31,000
Yes.

1666
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,000
Featuring the band hiatus.

1667
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:39,000
So I don't know if it's every single member of the Mad Tea Party but I believe it's definitely Alice and the Mad Hatter.

1668
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:44,000
They are now in like you know they're not wearing those clothes but they they have the old chemistry.

1669
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
The band sounds good.

1670
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:52,000
I was just I was so pleased to hear live music again as well.

1671
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
Just going like oh wow.

1672
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
I guess if that's the bar.

1673
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:57,000
Yeah.

1674
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,000
They are playing live music.

1675
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,000
I have some video I should post that as well really.

1676
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,000
I totally forgot that I should have been talking a lot more about that.

1677
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,000
You already did post that.

1678
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:06,000
You're going to post more.

1679
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:07,000
I have more yeah I have more.

1680
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:08,000
Yeah.

1681
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:14,000
But we hadn't discussed it on the show so more content because people obviously now they thought we were at the end.

1682
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
Now it's a little a little surprise treat.

1683
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:22,000
They're like oh hiatus the band that used to play at California Adventure during the outdoor festival the Mad Tea Party.

1684
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:27,000
I was thinking weeks ago that Mike did not get his point across with a single clip.

1685
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:35,000
When is Mike going to post more carnival de grotesque featuring hiatus.

1686
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:36,000
They've all been tweeting this.

1687
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
This is like five Mike Myers.

1688
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:42,000
You know it's a final little touch at the end.

1689
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:43,000
We almost buried the lead.

1690
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:46,000
By the way if you don't know we're talking about there was a second game.

1691
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:47,000
A lot of this is on the second game.

1692
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:54,000
We talked about this thing that happened and there's some disagreement about how good quality of the thing.

1693
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:58,000
Some of us thought it was really good and then somebody else thought it was just good.

1694
01:29:58,000 --> 01:29:59,000
I won't say who.

1695
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,000
Something like that.

1696
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:09,000
I will say at Knott's they have a new area over by the the Berry Tales that's kind of like a roaring like ghosts of the roaring 20s.

1697
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:12,000
And they have like a big band that sounded really cool.

1698
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:16,000
And then there's like hey look at that like guys all doing the voice.

1699
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:20,000
Which I was like this is a right up Jason's alley like you would have loved this.

1700
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:28,000
And now yeah there's a lot of cool stuff at Knott's even if you're not going to go in the scare zones and are in the actual mazes.

1701
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:34,000
Like they really seem like I would say Horror Nights definitely felt like smaller than it did two years ago.

1702
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:37,000
Where it was like Ghostbusters and that felt like really big and ambitious.

1703
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:44,000
This one felt a little bit smaller but Knott's felt like they were going bigger and doing different stuff too.

1704
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
In addition to just a lot of the same mazes.

1705
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:52,000
But it like felt like they were even flushing more of their like I don't know Knott's IP out into the park too.

1706
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
So that's highly recommended.

1707
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:58,000
I might I might go back to Knott's in the next week or two.

1708
01:30:58,000 --> 01:30:59,000
It was fun.

1709
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:04,000
So if there's any Minotaurs hiding at Knott's.

1710
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:05,000
I don't think there's a minute.

1711
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,000
Watch your asses out.

1712
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:10,000
Watch your horned asses out.

1713
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:14,000
I assume the Minotaurs also have horns coming out of their butts.

1714
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:15,000
Yeah they have horns.

1715
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:19,000
Any orifice on a Minotaur there's a horn protruding.

1716
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:22,000
Their urethra, their anus.

1717
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
That's why they're so mad.

1718
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
They can't poop or pee.

1719
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:32,000
If you had horns coming out of your pee hole you would be very upset all the time.

1720
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:35,000
I don't think I mean look is there a Minotaur at Knott's?

1721
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:39,000
But the Minotaur is my I guess is my mortal enemy now.

1722
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:42,000
So it will follow me everywhere.

1723
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:45,000
It's almost like some sort of beast who hunts you through the maze of life.

1724
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,000
As if it was some sort of Minotaur.

1725
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,000
Well I guess that doesn't work.

1726
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:50,000
Oh well.

1727
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:51,000
Yeah.

1728
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:54,000
Oh I think there might be a Minotaur in a new one of these new mazes.

1729
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:55,000
There is.

1730
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:57,000
There's maybe a Minotaur at Knott's.

1731
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:58,000
I got it.

1732
01:31:58,000 --> 01:31:59,000
I got to double check.

1733
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:00,000
I think I saw the Delusion.

1734
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:05,000
If you recall on the Delusion show we saw like a stack of rocks suddenly came to life.

1735
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:07,000
Oh yeah there was a rock man.

1736
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:08,000
A giant rock monster.

1737
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:09,000
Yeah yeah yeah.

1738
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:13,000
So I will conquer it maybe multiple times.

1739
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:21,000
Maybe I'll just take it on the road as Scott's saying and I will destroy or bloody every stage from now on every time we do a live show.

1740
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:25,000
Oh wait this is upgraded from once to every performance.

1741
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:26,000
It's like a Gallagher.

1742
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:27,000
Every live show.

1743
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:28,000
It's a Gallagher kind of a thing now.

1744
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:31,000
Let's bring out the Minotaur.

1745
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,000
Everybody puts their tarps up.

1746
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:34,000
Yeah yeah yeah yeah.

1747
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:41,000
And then I take a big sledgehammer and I smash the Minotaur's head and everybody gets bloody.

1748
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:42,000
It's fun.

1749
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:46,000
I'll be honest that sounds like the best touring spectacle that exists.

1750
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
That is straight to the front of the line.

1751
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:49,000
It's a show.

1752
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:54,000
We get to we leisurely talk about theme parks for a while and then there's a live Minotaur fight.

1753
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:55,000
Extra bloody.

1754
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:58,000
Oh man if I could have like a wrestling match with the Minotaur.

1755
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:01,000
Somebody's got to play him though I guess.

1756
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:02,000
I suppose so.

1757
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:03,000
Yeah all right well.

1758
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:10,000
If you're if you're brave enough do you accept the challenge to play the ultimate role of the Minotaur.

1759
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:15,000
We just learned about the boxing or wrestling dinosaurs show.

1760
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:16,000
Oh shit yeah we did.

1761
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:21,000
You could probably fight a Minotaur two dinosaurs can fight in a wrestling ring.

1762
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:22,000
That's true.

1763
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
So all right well I'll work on it.

1764
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:33,000
Be on the lookout in future every live in every single live show and until then you survived haunt cast the fright.

1765
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:39,000
Hey we got to follow us on all the socials and I don't know my notes in front of me.

1766
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:45,000
What's the stuff go to our public where there's merch and there's three bonus episodes every month.

1767
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:53,000
And this month it is behind the cemetery gate haunt cast the cemetery gate at Patreon.com slash podcast the ride.

1768
01:33:53,000 --> 01:34:00,000
We just covered up its haunted mansion with Griffin Newman which was fun and more spooky stuff coming over there.

1769
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:05,000
And I'd like to just say that I'm getting my mojo back baby.

1770
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:08,000
Swing swing.

1771
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:09,000
Well good night.

1772
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:12,000
