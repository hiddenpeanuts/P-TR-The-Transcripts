1
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:02,580
Forever.

2
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:03,300
Dog.

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:10,600
Warning, the following episode is a street fight of polite but intense theme park conversation.

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:17,040
It's park versus park, Orlando, Florida versus all other cities and one company's vinyl collectibles

5
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:20,360
versus another company's vinyl collectibles.

6
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:25,940
Zach Ryder joins us to talk theme park toys on today's Podcast the Ride.

7
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:52,560
The theme park podcast hosted by three men who all, last night, spent 15 minutes texting

8
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,800
each other Google Map overheads of Disneyland.

9
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,080
That is true.

10
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:59,380
I think actually now that I think about it, I wrote that, but I think I was the one primarily

11
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:00,320
sending the overheads.

12
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,020
But we were all discussing sort of the breakdown of Disneyland.

13
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,300
By the way, my name is Mike Carlson.

14
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:07,580
I'm joined by Jason Sheridan and Scott Caradon.

15
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:14,280
And you were right, but what, yeah, you sent a map because this was based on the idea of

16
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:20,320
can the Tron coaster fit somewhere into Disneyland?

17
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:28,060
And I believe I told you I had previously done map comparisons to like, and sort of

18
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:29,400
like eyeballed.

19
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:33,240
All right, so at this scale, the coaster is an inch.

20
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:40,320
And so if you move this inch from Shanghai on top of, you know, on top of the Autopia,

21
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:46,760
if you were to get rid of something that is unnecessary in Disneyland, such as the Autopia

22
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:49,320
or the submarines, there I set it.

23
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,020
Yeah, sure.

24
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,600
You know, would it fit?

25
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:59,420
I think, but what we agreed on essentially is that, you know, I think, I think gut almost

26
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:02,080
anything in Tomorrowland to get that Tron ride in.

27
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:05,600
Just save Space Mountain and everything else can go.

28
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:06,420
Everything else can go.

29
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:11,000
Because I looked at it and we were talking about because the space Autopia and the subs

30
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,160
take up, it's massive.

31
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:16,040
Like you could fit what looks like seven space mountains in that.

32
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,400
I could be well, that's not exact.

33
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,800
But when you really see it overhead, you go, look at all the land that is just wasted here

34
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,360
on two rides that I never go on.

35
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:28,660
Yeah. And as we discussed last week, the monorail track in Disneyland, especially has been

36
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,260
changed and reconfigured so much.

37
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,140
It's not an alien idea to that.

38
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:36,200
They can they can rejigger that however they want.

39
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:40,660
We started talking about we're going to get to an interview, by the way, with WWE

40
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:45,740
superstar and podcaster Zack Ryder, aka Matt Cordona, just a little bit.

41
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:53,740
Oh, my God. A superstar from another avenue from Orlando, from paradise.

42
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:58,580
He will be taking away some of his precious paradise time to join us.

43
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:00,320
Right. He's won an Intercontinental title.

44
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:01,780
He's won a US title. But we don't care.

45
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,840
We're more impressed that he's living in Orlando.

46
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:06,200
That's the thing that we care so much.

47
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,440
We want to ask him about that.

48
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:09,580
We're going to ask him about theme park toys.

49
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,680
We could, I guess, just talk to any Orlando resident.

50
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:15,620
I'm glad if we're going to talk to anyone that it is a WWE superstar.

51
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:20,320
But some of some of his questions were we're going to ask him almost anybody.

52
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:25,180
And I'm excited because oftentimes we reach consensus or at least like, well, I

53
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:27,940
I don't agree with you, but I understand where you're coming from.

54
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:30,260
But Matt has some real hot takes.

55
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:33,080
And, yeah, it's good we have.

56
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,100
It's good to have opposite opinions on the show.

57
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:38,440
Will we be flustered? Will we be alarmed? Will we agree?

58
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:39,900
We are always flustered.

59
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:41,860
I mean, I think that's clear in our lives.

60
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,800
Sure. So, yeah, just to go circle back to what we were talking about.

61
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,180
I think that we started talking about Disneyland and the layout and where stuff

62
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:53,840
could go is because we saw this video that is sweeping theme park Twitter

63
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,160
and everything, every social media.

64
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:00,300
This beauty and the beast ride coming to Tokyo Disney.

65
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,600
Disney Sea? No, it's Disney, right?

66
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,180
This is Disneyland. OK. Yes.

67
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,600
That is am I wrong?

68
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:10,020
I'm not even sure where is I think it is.

69
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:11,700
I think you're right. I think it's Disneyland because they're doing

70
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:15,120
the Disney Sea expansion with that's in twenty twenty two.

71
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:18,660
And it's going to have Peter Pan and there's a frozen thing.

72
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,760
And that's all there, I believe. OK.

73
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,300
So, yeah, Tokyo Disneyland.

74
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:29,000
And it's three minutes long and it shows off robots like they show so much in this.

75
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,860
Yeah. And the primary thing, I mean, you see robots.

76
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,180
Look, they're they're all great.

77
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:42,620
But you essentially you see robots of the beast of Bell's horse,

78
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:46,000
Philippe, as all the Philippe fans get ready.

79
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:49,920
You're finally going to see a fully rendered Philippe, but also

80
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,160
the Bell, several animatronics of Bell.

81
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:55,520
And I don't want to speak for you guys, but to me, the Bell

82
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,840
animatronics, the most mind blowing.

83
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:04,460
Absolutely. It is like so alive and has the texture of a cartoon character.

84
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,480
All of the oddity that you feel with I think I think that Ariel

85
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:12,680
animatronic ended up pretty good, but I think there were probably like errors

86
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,700
on the way and your hair was weird at a certain point.

87
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:19,680
The the Bell animatronic is so crazy out of the gate.

88
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:24,040
It is just it is a living toy or something.

89
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:26,640
Her moving is, I think, what everybody's responding to.

90
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:31,020
And I think initially I thought because I saw a thumbnail of that,

91
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,380
like when she's got I think she has like the lantern, like I don't know

92
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:34,320
what scene that's from.

93
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,280
Maybe it's I think it's in the winter when she's like looking for something

94
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,900
or the beast. I can't remember exactly.

95
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,160
I could be wrong now. Now that I'm thinking about it, she's not wearing a winter coat.

96
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:44,540
So don't crucify me on Twitter for this.

97
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:46,220
And maybe they'll give her they'll give her the coat later.

98
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:47,020
They bought the coat.

99
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:49,280
Maybe the coat is not there yet, but she's walking.

100
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,680
And it basically is the important part.

101
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:53,800
And I saw a thumbnail of it and I thought it was a cartoon.

102
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,700
And I showed the whole thing to my girlfriend, Lindsey.

103
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:00,320
And she I had to tell her that is a robot because she goes,

104
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:02,640
Oh, I thought that was just a CGI Bell.

105
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:06,060
It looks if you haven't watched this and please look it up.

106
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:09,900
Although I think the name of the video is is in Japanese.

107
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:13,200
So learn Japanese and then look up the video.

108
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:19,120
But yeah, it looks absolutely like very well rendered 3D animation.

109
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:22,340
But it is a physical thing in some warehouse somewhere

110
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,880
that will soon be in the parks in Japan.

111
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:28,600
But it moves not just like smooth movement or life like.

112
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:33,120
But Scott, you said movement like the animation movement.

113
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:35,080
And they said they worked with the animation studio,

114
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,040
but they always say we worked hand in hand with this.

115
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:40,900
But in this case, it's this case and like the lantern dangle.

116
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:44,420
Like you can see the lantern moving like if you were holding a lantern.

117
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:49,100
Like it's it's so crazy, not just they could make it look so natural,

118
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:52,780
but look natural in a style of animate.

119
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:57,080
Like it's wild. Yeah, it's it's it reminded me of the frozen right

120
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:00,460
because the frozen right is really great animatronics and they move,

121
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:02,160
you know, a good amount.

122
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,880
And everybody always talks about the Olaf animatronic

123
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,540
because he kind of follows you around.

124
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:08,580
He walks and he like looks at you.

125
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:11,060
But, you know, he just don't he's like a snowman.

126
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:13,700
He doesn't have to, you know, move like a human or whatever.

127
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,620
I don't have to move anyway.

128
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:17,080
You don't want me to.

129
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,700
My limbs don't work like human limbs.

130
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,660
I'm a little cartoon guy.

131
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,820
I'm a cartoon snowman.

132
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:27,680
Nothing says Christmas morning like Pillsbury Crescent Rolls.

133
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,080
It does sound like my Pillsbury doughboy voice, which I've done for many years.

134
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,000
But it is the similar voice.

135
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:36,300
I'm a little I'm a little snowy doughy boy.

136
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,620
Yeah, that's what he says.

137
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:42,260
Like we were just kind of loosely quoting him on the right.

138
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,320
He says basically all that stuff. Yeah.

139
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:46,420
We're born. So, yeah.

140
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:50,420
But like he moves and that's the most impressive, impressive animatronic on that right.

141
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:54,480
But it looks like they took the moving part of it and they put it on the humans characters.

142
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:57,600
And that's the really thing that's going to blow people's minds.

143
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:02,800
I think it's this weird, this odd step between there are the very humany characters,

144
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:07,820
like the all of presidents and like Benjamin Franklin Climbing the Stairs.

145
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:12,180
And then there's pure cartoon characters, which seem like in some

146
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:16,680
you know, it's all very difficult to do, but maybe easier to render a cartoon character.

147
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:21,720
And this is this in between a cartoon of a human that moves

148
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:27,740
so fluidly and so realistically, it is it does feel like a just new type of animatronic entirely.

149
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:32,480
Yeah, it's it's like between this and then those like stunt tronics.

150
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:35,160
Is that what they were called? The Marvel? Oh, yeah.

151
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:38,600
The flipping ones. Yeah, they were like they may be called stunt tronics.

152
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:43,840
And it was like they're going to be able to do a stunt show and robots will be able to do stunts

153
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,040
and the robots will probably be dressed like Iron Man or something.

154
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:51,300
But you'll have be able to have Iron Man fly through the air during a stunt show.

155
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:55,740
So between these two, like all the robots are going to get way more realistic,

156
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,660
from hopefully from now on.

157
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:58,980
And it's going to be awesome.

158
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:02,080
Hopefully not scary. Hopefully not some sort of Skynet thing.

159
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,380
We're inching closer and closer to the itching scratchy land episode.

160
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,060
But those are clunky robots.

161
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,000
I guess so.

162
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,740
Those are a good time to prepare for an attack by those clunky, itching, scratchy robots.

163
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,500
We're heading closer and closer to Westworld.

164
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:20,540
And it's finally by the end of our lifetimes, we will be able to engage

165
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:24,280
in sexual relations with the Avengers.

166
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,480
With the Avengers.

167
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:29,120
You know, I don't know who's in that Iron Man suit.

168
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:32,880
Maybe it's a hot lady or it's just doesn't matter to me.

169
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:36,100
That is the comic book equivalent of an eyes wide shut mask.

170
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,700
Oh, yeah.

171
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:41,540
Where the Iron Man and anonymity?

172
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:42,980
Maybe I'm in there.

173
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,920
Maybe you're not in the suit.

174
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:49,200
Oh, man. You know, this makes me really happy about thinking about kissing Olaf.

175
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,140
Yes. Dressed as Iron Man.

176
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:52,580
Dressed as Iron Man.

177
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,620
Uh, this I'm melting in this suit.

178
00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:00,100
This this makes me think of Independence Day resurgence,

179
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,140
which is a phrase no one has ever said before.

180
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:08,460
But, you know, we had 20 plus years to prepare and we're not ready.

181
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:13,500
20 plus years to protect, prepare for a robot sex at Disneyland.

182
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:17,920
Yeah. I never thought it would happen to me.

183
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:18,920
Big Al.

184
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:24,460
He's a big he's a thick boy, you know,

185
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:28,540
takes a real man to take a big Al down.

186
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,680
Yeah. Well, we finally outed ourselves.

187
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,680
What this podcast has really always been all about.

188
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:37,560
Kiss Eyes Queens, Iron Man, Kissing Iron Man.

189
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:43,540
And I'm sure our our guest will be very happy to have this discussion

190
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:44,880
as his introduction.

191
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,020
Yeah. So what a beautiful red carpet we just laid for him.

192
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:51,180
Yeah. So we'll take a break and collect ourselves,

193
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:52,360
because now we're all heated up.

194
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,240
We're all flustered.

195
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:56,360
And we'll be right back with our guest, W.W.

196
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:58,400
Zach Ryder, aka Matt Cardona.

197
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,220
All right, folks, welcome.

198
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,720
We'd like to welcome our very special guest.

199
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:09,800
You know him from the WWE and his podcast, the Major Wrestling Figure podcast.

200
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,140
He's the Michael Jordan of wrestling figure collecting.

201
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:16,240
Matt Cardona, aka Zach Ryder.

202
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:20,540
Welcome to the show, Matt or Zach or however we're going to whatever we'll say.

203
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:22,140
Like, do you prefer whatever?

204
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,840
It doesn't really matter to me.

205
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:27,420
I think at this point in my life, most people call me Zach, even my dad,

206
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:29,440
even though my real name is Matt.

207
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,480
That's funny. So so.

208
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,160
Very. So, yeah.

209
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:36,640
So you for personal, like close friends, they call you Matt.

210
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,840
Yeah. My real name is Matt Cardona on the wrestling figure podcast.

211
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:43,120
I'm Matt Cardona, aka Zach Ryder.

212
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,100
But most people, they know me as Zach Ryder.

213
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:46,620
Nobody knows who Matt Cardona is.

214
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,580
You know, right, right. Well, we can do that.

215
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:51,120
We can try to get the word out that you are Matt.

216
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,640
Either or, you know, either or.

217
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:58,200
I try to do both on the podcast, you know, so I can create my real identity.

218
00:11:58,380 --> 00:11:59,480
You know what I'm saying? Sure.

219
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:03,020
But what would you get stitched into Mickey Ears?

220
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,180
Ooh, I mean, I would definitely.

221
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:08,880
I think I would definitely get the whole give of all the Zach Ryder stuff, everything.

222
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,700
All right. That makes sense. That's the way to go. Sure.

223
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,560
Do you think they could fit Woo Woo Woo onto the back of Mickey Ears?

224
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:16,760
Is there enough room?

225
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,540
I'm sure they could do it, but I would not do that.

226
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:20,460
OK, I wouldn't get.

227
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,360
No, that's where that's that's across the line.

228
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:28,040
That's a little too aggressive of a brand, you know, branding.

229
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:31,660
Right. A little too much like like I listen.

230
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:35,620
Right now I'm in my I can't really see what I'm doing, but quote unquote office.

231
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:36,880
I'm doing like the figure quotes.

232
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,880
I say office, but there's a computer here and a bunch of like toys and stuff.

233
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:44,820
But there's a Zach Ryder cardboard cut out with a Darth Vader

234
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,820
slash Mickey Mouse helmet on it.

235
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:50,360
So you guys are missing that right now. Hey, that sounds great.

236
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:54,480
Yeah. For those of you who do not know, Matt is

237
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,940
can I say an insane toy collector?

238
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:00,220
Is that OK? Sure. Sure.

239
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,540
If you want to say insane, I just say I'm a toy collector.

240
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:05,100
Like you said, the Michael Jordan of wrestling collecting.

241
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,460
But he's an insane basketball player, I would call him, though,

242
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:10,220
because he's like so good.

243
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:12,540
He does it so well. Oh, insane is a compliment.

244
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:13,860
I'm using it as a compliment.

245
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:16,060
No, no, no, no. For sure. For sure. For sure.

246
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:19,760
So, yeah, we're going to talk like theme park merch, toys,

247
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:21,720
general theme park stuff.

248
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,860
But before we start, I do.

249
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,360
I don't know if you remember this.

250
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,360
You've actually talked theme parks with with one of us being me.

251
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:30,800
The one person being me.

252
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:34,080
We were at a mutual friend's wedding over the summer.

253
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:36,060
I don't know if this jogs your memory.

254
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:39,360
I do remember that at John Morrison's wedding.

255
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,160
So you know what I'm talking about?

256
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:44,160
We had a little we had a little argument, right?

257
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:49,120
Yes, we did. So so this is this is before I heard the podcast.

258
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,420
Now I listen all the time. Sure. I apologize.

259
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,680
No, it's OK. I wasn't calling you on it.

260
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:54,660
I thought it was great.

261
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:58,300
But did you know once you started listening to the podcast that that was me?

262
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:04,320
I kind of put two and two together and I never was 100 percent certain until just now.

263
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,680
Sure. Can either side of this give your side of the events?

264
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:12,020
Yeah, yeah. My recollection of it was that John

265
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:15,640
John Hennigan, John Morrison, Johnny Mundo, he has many names.

266
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:17,100
He was just on Survivor.

267
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,780
He's everywhere. His wedding.

268
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:23,100
And he said, hey, bro, this is my buddy, Mike.

269
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,920
He has a theme park podcast.

270
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:28,140
And my recollection is that you immediately started quizzing me

271
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:30,480
like pretty hardcore about theme parks.

272
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,360
I think your first question was, what's the best ride in Magic Kingdom?

273
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,760
And it was like, I was like, whoa, whoa, wait, what?

274
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:40,820
And I was like, well, did you and I think I said, well, when you say Magic Kingdom,

275
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,100
you mean obviously Florida because Magic Kingdom and you were like, well,

276
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,360
there's that's the only Magic Kingdom.

277
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:48,680
And I said, well, they call the you know, they call Disneyland

278
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:51,000
sometimes Walt Disney's Magic Kingdom in videos.

279
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,520
And I think you said then it's Space Mountain.

280
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,940
The answer is Space Mountain.

281
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,760
So that's my that's

282
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,420
that's my recollection of the start of it, at least.

283
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,180
And I think people were like standing around and I think it turned into like

284
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:06,780
kind of like a rap battle of some where people would be like, oh, like

285
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:10,380
once like somebody said a good thing or I was like, well,

286
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:12,060
have you ever been in Walt's apartment?

287
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:13,880
And then I think someone's like, whoa.

288
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:18,100
Yeah, I mean, to be honest, I had a couple couple of drinks that day.

289
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,060
I don't really remember every little detail.

290
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:24,440
Sure. But what's funny is that I was quizzing you and now listening to your podcast.

291
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,280
I realized I don't know anything in compared to you guys.

292
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:30,860
I guess that's what I was talking about on Twitter about.

293
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,820
Like, I can't do like a whole topic.

294
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:35,580
Like, you guys know, like the voices and rise.

295
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:36,860
I thought I was a diehard.

296
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,540
You guys put me to shame.

297
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:42,080
Well, you've pursued other interests in a successful career.

298
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:45,400
We have nothing better to do than know who Thorol Ravenscroft is.

299
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,120
OK, see, there you go.

300
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,720
But I mean, I like all my friends.

301
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:52,420
They think I'm like this diehard Disney freak.

302
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:53,360
They think I'm obsessed.

303
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:56,260
They think I'm nuts because I I have an annual pass in Orlando.

304
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:57,040
I live in Orlando.

305
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:58,720
So I go a couple of times a month.

306
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:03,000
And, you know, some people, they just don't get it, you know, at all.

307
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,260
And you guys like the opposite.

308
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,600
You guys totally get it.

309
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:06,200
You know what I'm saying?

310
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:11,080
Well, we get like, yeah, for a normal person, like you are unusual.

311
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:14,260
But like when you look at us for knowing

312
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:19,120
like some 60 year old character, character actor doing voices of robots.

313
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,360
Yeah, like then that makes you look normal versus like

314
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,400
so there's a whole spectrum.

315
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:24,580
That was what I'm trying to say.

316
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:28,080
But like we're all absolutely all four of us are strange

317
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,800
compared to the normal person in the world.

318
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:32,240
That's what we're all.

319
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,560
For sure. Yeah, absolutely.

320
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:38,600
Matt, I do want to commend you for immediately going to get the upper hand

321
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:42,020
on Mike, because he will just you can just tell by his voice.

322
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:46,560
He will run rough shot over you if you don't establish dominance.

323
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,480
Oh, OK. Yeah.

324
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,020
All right. Now I know Jason is Jason is happy that that's

325
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:52,900
what everything went down.

326
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:56,600
No, I honestly out of that interaction, I was like, that was the greatest thing.

327
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:58,820
That could have the best thing that could have happened was that

328
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:02,620
like I got to talk theme parks in a very funny way.

329
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,240
So do you stand you stand by that space mountain?

330
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,200
Would that be your assessment today?

331
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:12,280
For me? Oh, yeah, for sure.

332
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:13,640
Space is my favorite.

333
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:15,980
I know, like, OK.

334
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:19,780
Pirates of the Caribbean, Haunted Mansion, like I get their classics,

335
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:22,680
but oh, man, there's no way I could ride those every day.

336
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:27,100
So, yeah, so so I was listening to your interview with Kevin Perger,

337
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:30,200
who does defunct land, and you were.

338
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,900
Yeah, for those of you who don't know, we're talking about

339
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:34,780
we've mentioned many times he does these great videos about the history

340
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:38,720
of different rides, stuff that's not there, stuff that's not in the parks anymore.

341
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:40,860
And he also has a podcast and interviewed you.

342
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,240
And you kept giving him heart attacks because he would bring up

343
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,260
like classic rides and you would be like, yeah, boring.

344
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:53,040
Got to go. I would like to burn that down to like you didn't.

345
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:55,480
You said, I think Carousel Progress.

346
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:58,020
Correct me if I'm wrong. Carousel Progress.

347
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,060
No, gone boring ride.

348
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:04,220
I think you said it about I think you even kind of soft said it about pirates.

349
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,060
Like, no, no, no, listen, I was pirates.

350
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:10,000
I get it. I respect it. I respect its history.

351
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:13,360
You know, like every once in a while, I'll do it just to say I did it.

352
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,900
But I think even as a kid, I thought it was boring.

353
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,700
OK, so that was just boring.

354
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:22,740
That was not Carousel Progress needs to go 100 percent.

355
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:27,340
Shots fired shots fired because the classic fans, you know, they like

356
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:29,520
that's the history of Disney.

357
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:34,400
And so would you would you even want to plus that up or was it just like gone?

358
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:35,920
Let's have a fun new ride.

359
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:39,080
Now, if you want to plus it up and update it, go ahead.

360
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,540
But when's the last time it was updated?

361
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,420
Oh, I don't know. 20 years ago.

362
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:45,760
Oh, even more because they still have 90s virtual reality.

363
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:48,120
Like grandma's playing like a fighter game.

364
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:50,420
It's like one step above F zero.

365
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:53,360
Just barely. That's zero point five.

366
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:56,440
A few years ago, they swapped out like a furniture

367
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,900
sized big screen TV

368
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:05,440
with the, you know, big two part behind it for a modern flat screen TV.

369
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,240
And that was the last update I noticed.

370
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,900
So the answer is they haven't really touched it in a while.

371
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:16,880
Yeah, we're proving the nerd dim here that Jason knew that the TV had been changed

372
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,220
in the final scene of Carousel of Progress.

373
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,240
That doesn't count. That's not enough for you.

374
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:26,480
Yeah. So my mom, my mom came to our parents came to Orlando about a year ago

375
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,060
and she really wanted to do Carousel of Progress and I did not.

376
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:31,960
But I went on because she's my mom and, you know, give her a good time.

377
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,940
And I was asleep. I can't wait through it.

378
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:37,520
Do you do you even like the song?

379
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:39,560
Like, is there any element of it you would like?

380
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,580
Like, do you like the song? Is it charming at all to you?

381
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,540
Do you like the songs in general on the rides?

382
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:46,100
The famous songs like Yo Ho Pirates Life?

383
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,860
No, no, listen, I shouldn't.

384
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:50,540
Let me take it back. I don't hate pirates.

385
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,380
I understand its place in history.

386
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,980
It's OK. And it's cool.

387
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:57,120
But like, if I was going to take someone who's never been to Disney

388
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,020
World to Disney World or Disneyland, I would take him to Pirates

389
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:01,920
because it's history. It's classic. Right.

390
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,660
But for me, I'm an annual passholder.

391
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:06,900
If I'm going to go tomorrow, I'm not going to go on Pirates.

392
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:08,400
Gotcha. All right.

393
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:10,940
But when I would come, when I would come every couple of years, of course,

394
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:13,080
you have to hit Pirates. Right now.

395
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,540
Not in every time.

396
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:20,060
Are there any of the are there any rides that, you know, are

397
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:26,100
are kind of boring or dry, but that you do you are fond enough of it to

398
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,720
to put up with it?

399
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:32,740
I mean, Haunted Mansion, like, I love it, but it's the more you ride it.

400
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:36,000
You're like, oh, for me, it's like, OK, I did it.

401
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:36,760
I did it the other night.

402
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,760
I was like, oh, man, there we go again.

403
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:42,240
I'll imagine you just feel like it feels like a profession.

404
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:43,300
It's like a job.

405
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,900
Yeah, I think I almost spoil myself, you know,

406
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:49,420
because I have this annual pass and I don't go all the time.

407
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,260
I go enough.

408
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:52,900
And like every time someone comes to visit me in Orlando,

409
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,200
they want to go to the theme parks.

410
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,600
I want to go to Disney Universal. So.

411
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:58,880
I kind of ruin it for myself.

412
00:20:59,100 --> 00:20:59,840
Yeah, I get that.

413
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:02,380
I mean, there are rides that we don't go on at every time.

414
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:04,520
Like, for instance, like great moments with Mr.

415
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:08,740
Lincoln, which I imagine you would be OK with if it burned to the ground.

416
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,480
I'm just guessing.

417
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:14,560
Do you? I've never I've never done that or Hall of Presidents.

418
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:16,660
Really? Never done it at all.

419
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:19,760
I mean, they're both dry history lessons.

420
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:24,580
My parents might have took me to the Hall of Presidents

421
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:26,480
when I was like a little kid that I don't remember.

422
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:30,540
But like teenage and up, there's no way I was ever in there.

423
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:35,840
OK, well, yeah, like like a ride like that is like a once a year ride for me.

424
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:36,800
Like, right.

425
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:40,180
Lincoln is like a once a year ride, but it is nice that there is a robot

426
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:43,740
Abraham Lincoln that I can go and hear about the Civil War.

427
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:45,300
But once a year. Yeah.

428
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:48,620
I keep telling myself that one of these days I'm going to go to Magic Kingdom

429
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:52,060
and do all the things that I haven't done or hate.

430
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:53,960
And just like get it over with. I never do it again.

431
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:57,200
But the problem is, like, I can't do that with somebody.

432
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:58,200
They'll they'll never do it.

433
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,800
And then I can't go to the parks by myself, because it's kind of weird.

434
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,920
Unless you guys do that, then it's not weird. Sorry, guys.

435
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,880
But we're for me. We've been alone.

436
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,800
I've come to terms with it.

437
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,960
Much more common in Anaheim, much more common in Disneyland, I feel like.

438
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:19,420
Yes. And when you're often unemployed actors or writers or whatever we all are

439
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:22,120
and you've got a day to fill, let's let's head down.

440
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,220
And I'm perfect way to fill it up.

441
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,960
Yeah, nothing weird about it.

442
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:27,580
No, not not remotely.

443
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:29,360
Mike, you've told this one.

444
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:32,640
Sure, Mike, you've told this one on the show before,

445
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:36,080
but I kind of want Zach to hear it, which is that you went down

446
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,340
to see Dick Van Dyke in a parade.

447
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:41,160
Yeah, this is you're going to make fun of me for this

448
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:43,840
because I didn't go down even to go on a ride.

449
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:48,220
I went down because the real man, Dick Van Dyke, was going to be in a parade

450
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:50,300
at Disneyland because he had his 90th birthday.

451
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,980
No one would go with me.

452
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:52,920
And I was frustrated.

453
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:54,480
So I said, well, you know what? I'm going alone.

454
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:58,680
I went down for literally an hour and watched a 90 year old man

455
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,420
driving a little car down Main Street.

456
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:02,660
And then I went back up to Los Angeles.

457
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:05,720
So, you know, we all do.

458
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:07,880
It's like a good it's not a good hour and a half drive, right?

459
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,840
Or a little hour, hour and a half.

460
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,660
Yeah, hour, hour and a half.

461
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:15,700
Sure. Spent more time in the car than watching the old man in the little car.

462
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,940
So did you get to wave at him, at least?

463
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,060
Did I get what? Did you get to wave? Did he wave at you?

464
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:24,280
Oh, yeah, I got a picture of him waving in my general direction.

465
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,700
OK, that counts. All right. OK.

466
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:29,660
But like if we say you were an unemployed actor

467
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:32,380
and you maybe didn't have too much going on that day, but I said,

468
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,820
would you go with me to Anaheim to watch an old man in a parade for an hour?

469
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:38,280
Would you have said no or yes?

470
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:42,520
I mean, it depends who it is for Dick Van Dyke, probably not.

471
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,040
So like Michael J. Fox, maybe if he was like at Universal or DeLorean.

472
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:48,980
Oh, yeah. Yeah, maybe I do that.

473
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:53,100
He has been he opened back to the future of the ride down in Florida,

474
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:57,740
I think, along with Thomas Wilson and maybe maybe his Zemeckis appearance.

475
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:59,280
So he's he's been down.

476
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,040
He knows what it's like down there.

477
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,900
Oh, that DeLorean and Universal Orlando.

478
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,540
It's it's it's embarrassing.

479
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,400
It's it don't get me started on that.

480
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:12,720
Oh, yeah. I listened to you on on Jericho's podcast with Cody Rhodes and

481
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:17,460
got a big laugh at describing sad DeLorean next to a bush.

482
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:21,260
Yeah, it's like it's next to the bushes and a taco stand.

483
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:25,000
It has no it's like there should be like a spotlight on it.

484
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:26,020
It should be right in the middle.

485
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:29,220
Yeah, it is just that it's hidden by some bushes.

486
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:32,400
Tossed off after after the Simpsons.

487
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:35,580
Another thing that came up on that show that I definitely agree with

488
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:40,040
is that Universal has pretty much no sense of nostalgia

489
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:44,340
in the way Disney Universal will just build new rides left and right.

490
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,440
Right. There's no way the castle progress would be standing at Universal Studios.

491
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,620
No, no. Good point. Yes.

492
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:53,500
No way. Which ends up being a real pain for us, because like researching

493
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:57,900
universal researching Disney stuff is pretty but like finding weird

494
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:01,720
deep cut universal stuff, you're really like scraping the Internet archive

495
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,680
to find remnants of it.

496
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:05,040
Was your favorite?

497
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,840
I'd listen to that interview, too.

498
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:10,520
But I forget if it was back to the future, like your favorite ride of all time

499
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,320
when you were younger or now still.

500
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:14,820
When I was younger, I loved it.

501
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:17,480
And even now, I still consider one of my favorites of all time.

502
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:21,000
And that and as a kid, I wasn't even that really

503
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,080
I wasn't really that big of a back to the future fan.

504
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:26,660
Like now I'm like a diehard as I've grown older.

505
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:29,320
Come to appreciate more and watch it way more times.

506
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:32,840
So I would love to ride it now, like as an adult,

507
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:37,080
because like my last memory of it, I think I'm like in sixth grade.

508
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:41,040
So I don't really have vivid memories of it.

509
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:43,740
Well, you got to get there's a DVD re-release.

510
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,120
I got the DVD.

511
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:48,740
The ride is on the DVD. It's preserved.

512
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:52,520
And if you just kind of shake around in a chair, it approximates

513
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:53,720
what it's like to go on the ride.

514
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:56,280
I don't mind the Simpsons.

515
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,420
Simpsons is OK.

516
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:02,180
But, you know, I wish it didn't take the place of Back to the Future.

517
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,780
Yeah, that is the one that is the one that should still be there.

518
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,480
But I was like I was so worried around that time that they were going to

519
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,220
I knew about the future was going to be torn out.

520
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:15,280
But with NBC's awful synergy,

521
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:19,420
I was ready to be replaced by like a ride of The Voice or something.

522
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,860
I think so.

523
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,060
Bottom of the barrel.

524
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,940
I don't think that's out of the world.

525
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:27,140
One thing that, yeah, one thing that Universal still has

526
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:30,180
standard is that Fear Factor Live, nothing needs to go.

527
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,460
It's perplexing.

528
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:34,520
It's wild that it's still going.

529
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,020
Do they even run it, really?

530
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:39,360
Like occasionally during high traffic times, I think, right?

531
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:42,680
I haven't been in there in years.

532
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,100
I have never seen that show.

533
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,580
That's a theme park area.

534
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:47,700
I didn't see it in Hollywood.

535
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:50,120
I never saw it in Orlando. Skipped.

536
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:51,760
That's my burn it to the ground.

537
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,600
Yeah, I've never seen it either.

538
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:55,220
Did you? Bizarre.

539
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:59,040
And I said this before on the show, it's like the most valuable theme park reel.

540
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,220
It's just a huge it's like a block long.

541
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,520
So big. It's so big.

542
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,260
Yeah. I mean, Jaws has to go.

543
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:06,680
Jaws is torn out.

544
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:10,240
And yet Fear Factor is not forever tenant.

545
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:15,220
Yeah. I heard on that on that interview you had done with Jericho,

546
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:18,760
you were talking about like you're down on the animal actor show as well.

547
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,620
Yeah, that is true. Yeah.

548
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:26,660
I think I think the way Cody phrased it is that you guys were like backstage

549
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:30,640
because you got to do some cool tour or something and that you got to meet

550
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,000
the dog from the show.

551
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,680
And Cody said that you right.

552
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:37,620
Cody said that you buried the dog five minutes away, like five minutes

553
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:39,460
or five, excuse me, five feet away.

554
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:40,680
This is what this is what happened.

555
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:44,300
We had done one of those those VIP tours. Right.

556
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:47,640
So the last thing we like, you know, I don't know, half hour,

557
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,840
four minutes left and like I want to get some more rise in.

558
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:52,820
Cody's wife really wanted to do this animal actor show.

559
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,640
Like this is what we're going to waste our time with.

560
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:55,840
It's an actor show.

561
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:58,340
We can be cutting like lines right now.

562
00:27:58,540 --> 00:27:59,660
So I was already pissed.

563
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,500
You know, so we watched the show.

564
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,460
And of course, like nothing goes according to plan.

565
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,920
The dogs, they all mess up.

566
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:06,940
The birds fly the wrong way, all that stuff.

567
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:11,640
And then they say, hey, you could stay after and meet some of the animals.

568
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:15,140
Something like, OK, maybe we'll meet like the pug for Men in Black

569
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:16,600
or something like that, you know.

570
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:20,040
But we'd be like, just like a dog, a golden retriever.

571
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:21,620
Like, what is it?

572
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:22,980
Just the regular dog.

573
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:26,220
We can't be like big, big or something like that.

574
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:29,540
Oh, yeah, that is a little bit like that's not a famous dog.

575
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:32,380
You wouldn't want to have met one of the famous animals from the properties.

576
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:34,140
Yeah, that makes sense.

577
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:39,200
It's a bird that could hypothetically be in a film if a camera was pointed at it.

578
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,840
Yeah. Right.

579
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,420
So you live in Orlando.

580
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,420
You when did you move there a couple of years ago?

581
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:48,580
I moved just over two years ago.

582
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:52,380
OK, did was a big part of it that you would be close to the theme parks?

583
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,460
Yes, actually, it was.

584
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:57,600
Hey, that's OK. We dream about it every day.

585
00:28:57,660 --> 00:29:00,040
Every day we think about, hey, maybe we just quit this whole thing

586
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:00,980
and go down to Orlando.

587
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:02,940
We do. And I don't know.

588
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,840
You're going to have a different perspective because you have things going on.

589
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:10,260
But how do you like how do you feel about the Orlando situation?

590
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:11,680
And would you recommend it to others?

591
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:14,200
I love Orlando.

592
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,540
Oh, I love it.

593
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:19,800
Every so I fly out, you know, I've wrestling shows every week,

594
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:23,000
but every week when I fly home and I step foot on that,

595
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:26,500
that ugly carpet in the Orlando airport, I tell myself, I'm on vacation.

596
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:27,620
It's it's great.

597
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,040
You know, you go to the parks whenever you want.

598
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:32,120
There's always something going on because it's like this this tourist trap.

599
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:33,560
But I don't live like in the center.

600
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,000
I don't live like at the Magic Kingdom.

601
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:38,080
You know what I'm saying? I live like 45 minutes away from Disney.

602
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:41,360
So I live 10 minutes from the airport.

603
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,180
It's great. The airport's super easy.

604
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:47,240
I mean, I like the TSA pre if you didn't have that,

605
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,880
you'd be waiting on these crazy long lines.

606
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:52,300
But I love it. And the weather right now, it's December.

607
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:55,640
I'm in shorts at a tank top. New York, where I'm from.

608
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:58,560
It's it's always snowy. It's cold. It's expensive.

609
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,300
I don't know. I don't know. Everly will. I love it.

610
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:05,440
I didn't even think about that because you are on the road a lot of the year.

611
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:09,840
But every time you get back to Orlando, you get to ride that airport monorail.

612
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:12,380
Yes, every week, every week.

613
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:15,240
It's a ride. Yeah, you get to go on that ride every time.

614
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:20,540
And the TSA pre is sort of the fast pass of commuter travel.

615
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,080
So I even have something called clear.

616
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,600
So I passed the TSA pre.

617
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:28,320
So it's like people are saying like Orlando airport's nuts.

618
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:30,160
So we go, yeah, I don't wait on the lines.

619
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:31,860
Wow, that's great.

620
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:33,420
But I fly I fly every week.

621
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,340
So it's worth it for me.

622
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:36,640
I think it's like one hundred fifty dollars a year or something like that.

623
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,360
But it's saved so much time.

624
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,220
Yeah, that makes sense.

625
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:43,680
Would you be willing to help with the sales pitch to our respective wives

626
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:46,940
slash girlfriends to make the move to Orlando?

627
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:48,960
I mean, absolutely.

628
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:53,320
I mean, my my my mortgage is one hundred dollars more than my rent

629
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,880
was from an apartment in New York.

630
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,180
It's cheap down here.

631
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,120
That's really attractive.

632
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,540
That's all you had to say.

633
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,740
That's the only fact that matters.

634
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:03,940
Brand new house. No one ever sat on the toilet before. Brand new.

635
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:07,300
OK, that's another strike in the good.

636
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:09,540
I'm telling you, they're building all these communities all over.

637
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:12,460
Like where I live is like a new community every every like,

638
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:14,460
you know, a couple of months to build a new community.

639
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:15,800
Got to move down.

640
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:18,600
She's all right. Maybe we just have a cul-de-sac to yourself.

641
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,060
I mean, the houses are a little close together.

642
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,860
They're like 10 feet apart, but that's OK.

643
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:26,300
That's all right. Everything's we're in apartments.

644
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:30,100
Yeah. So my whole life or like my whole adult life,

645
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:32,380
I always live in apartment apartment apartment in New York.

646
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:36,820
All my stuff in stores, paying all this money, shoveling snow, all this BS.

647
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:38,960
Now I live in Orlando, go to Disney World.

648
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:40,160
Oh, it's the best.

649
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:41,620
Palm trees.

650
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:44,540
The Denny's by the airport has palm trees. Oh, it's beautiful.

651
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:47,380
Well, if you could see us, we're all like wistfully looking off

652
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:49,440
into the distance, imagining this life here.

653
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,880
You're painting for us.

654
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,600
We love it.

655
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:58,080
We're in the middle of the one of the few stretches of when it rains in L.A.

656
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:01,240
and everything just falls apart when that happens.

657
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,480
Like it rains every day.

658
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:05,560
You almost did Orlando and everyone's fine out here.

659
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,400
It's like the end of the world.

660
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:11,580
Yeah. So when you're in Orlando, what are your theme park habits like?

661
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:13,000
How many times do you go in a month?

662
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:14,640
Do you have a universal pass?

663
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:17,400
Like what do you have a strategy or is it sort of spur of the moment?

664
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:22,700
So I had a universal pass the first year I moved down, but I didn't use it.

665
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:26,220
I mean, I paid for it with the amount of times I went, but I didn't use it that much.

666
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:29,940
So now, like when I go, I only go with like people come and visit

667
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:33,180
or if it's like Halloween or nice, because I feel like it sounds weird.

668
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:35,180
But Disney is a whole world, you know, and Universal

669
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:39,440
those two parks and I love Universal, but I can get old quick, I think.

670
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:43,280
And Disney, you can really spread out like with Disney.

671
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,660
Disney has all the hotels and the resorts.

672
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:48,840
You go eat somewhere in one of those hotels and go to the Disney Springs area.

673
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:51,280
It's phenomenal. They've really redone that.

674
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:54,460
It's my favorite thing to do in Orlando is go to Disney Springs.

675
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:55,800
Oh, wow. Yeah.

676
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:59,940
So have you gone to like every restaurant there is to go on the Disney World property?

677
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:01,620
No, not even close.

678
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:02,860
And that's what I love about it.

679
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:06,900
I wouldn't even say like less than half, probably a third, if that.

680
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:09,840
OK, so we're talking restaurants in a Disney World area.

681
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:12,960
What are your top couple, top three?

682
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:16,640
Top three California Grill at the contemporary.

683
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:17,920
Yeah. Right.

684
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:23,440
I was just there two nights ago in Disney Springs, some called the Boathouse.

685
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:24,400
I love the Boathouse.

686
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:25,620
I love this Boathouse.

687
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:28,700
I went once two years ago. It's the greatest.

688
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:30,880
So good. The food's good.

689
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:32,360
The view is good. The atmosphere is good.

690
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,200
Really, really love it.

691
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:37,540
And then what else?

692
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,220
And there's so many good ones.

693
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:43,540
Let's say Gico and Animal Kingdom, the Animal Kingdom.

694
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:45,260
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

695
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,200
That was called. I got to do that once.

696
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,820
Yeah, that's that's fancy as hell.

697
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:51,520
And like, yeah, like odd food you wouldn't get elsewhere.

698
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:52,500
Yeah, really cool.

699
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:53,500
And so like deep.

700
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:55,740
And don't get me wrong, I'm not going to these places every night.

701
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:57,000
You know what I'm saying? Sure. Sure.

702
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,240
And that's OK. If you were.

703
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:00,280
We wouldn't have a problem if you were.

704
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:03,000
Every lunch at Gico.

705
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,580
So, yeah. So so how often are you going to one of the four Disney parks a month?

706
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:11,760
I would say once or twice a month.

707
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:15,960
It's not it's not crazy excessive, you know, for instance, the other night

708
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:19,480
I went to the Mickey's very, very Christmas party

709
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:24,660
and I might go to I might try to go to Hollywood Studios next week.

710
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:26,900
So that'd be two times this month. Sure.

711
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:30,160
So you hit events and stuff, it seems like special things.

712
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:33,320
Yeah, I've got my favorite.

713
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:35,940
So I go to Epcot a lot. Yeah. Yeah.

714
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,140
What's the world showcase like?

715
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:39,380
I saw some Instagram pictures of you.

716
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:42,180
I think John was with you guys a while, a while ago, but like

717
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:44,560
going up and down, I assume drinking around the world.

718
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,420
Oh, yeah, for sure.

719
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,760
As a kid, I hated Epcot.

720
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:50,840
If my parents would take me there, I was so mad.

721
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,220
I didn't want to waste the day at Epcot.

722
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:54,220
But now, oh, it's my favorite.

723
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:57,200
I would go I would go to Epcot every week, for sure.

724
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,980
Is there do you have a favorite Epcot country?

725
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:02,640
Oh, Mexico, for sure.

726
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,740
Oh, yeah, that's a kilobar inside.

727
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:07,140
Oh, my God, the best.

728
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,660
And that ride, you are guaranteed no wait.

729
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:13,540
You will never wait for the Mexico boat ride.

730
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:15,520
Interest in it has never gone up.

731
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:18,100
It's just you could always jump right on that thing.

732
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,720
I think there's a reason for that.

733
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:24,200
All right. So you want to burn that one to the ground as well.

734
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,280
No, it's cute. It's in there.

735
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:27,340
It's like in the restaurant.

736
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,640
I don't really count that as a ride. Keep it.

737
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:30,720
Oh, OK.

738
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:34,060
But what if I what if our idea was to like drain that

739
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:37,340
and then just make it overflow for that to kilobar?

740
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:39,380
Oh, OK. I like that.

741
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:41,960
OK, maybe that's the way. Maybe that's what we should do.

742
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:45,580
And if those if those animatronics, if the three capoeiras serve you drinks,

743
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:49,800
they're poor. Yeah, if they're operating the taps, that's the way.

744
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:53,920
Yeah. When so when you were a kid, like how did you go a lot as a kid

745
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,920
to these places was?

746
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:59,880
No, I probably went like every like five years or so.

747
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:04,960
So maybe like four times in my life until I became like an adult.

748
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:09,180
There's a little, little kid I went and when I don't even remember,

749
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:11,780
it's like third grade, sixth grade, like 11th grade.

750
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:14,020
So like four times. Yeah, you.

751
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:16,660
You loved it.

752
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:20,520
You tweeted us a photo of you at like a 20th anniversary event

753
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,560
at Star Wars in 1997.

754
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:24,360
And I think we're all.

755
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:25,520
I was. Yeah.

756
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:30,960
And it made me realize like, wait, was I at that too?

757
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,960
Like, because I ended up down there.

758
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:36,980
One one of the times when I was down there with my family,

759
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:40,160
it would have been like one of the first Star Wars, like weekends

760
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,860
or Star Wars anniversary things,

761
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:45,840
which was like very fun and different at the time.

762
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:48,820
And now it's it's always Star Wars time.

763
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:53,820
Yeah, luckily, I love Star Wars, so I'm OK with it. Yeah.

764
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:59,260
You psyched for for later in the year for the the grand unveiling of Galaxy?

765
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:02,940
I'm a little nervous, but yeah, I definitely psyched.

766
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:03,700
Yeah, yeah.

767
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:06,600
Do we I don't think we've recorded an episode since we saw the

768
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:09,180
there was a news story going around about how people are expecting

769
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:13,000
200,000 visitors on the day the thing opens,

770
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:15,340
which is a tad imposing.

771
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:17,920
Maybe that you guys are.

772
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,980
OK, you guys are getting away before us, right?

773
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,500
Yeah, that's what they're saying.

774
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:25,400
Like months before, possibly six months to longer.

775
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,340
So that means I got to come to Disneyland.

776
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,300
Yeah, I was going to say, like, you will.

777
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:32,520
You have to make that stop then.

778
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:33,740
Oh, 100 percent.

779
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:37,100
I I mean, maybe because I've been to Disney World so many times

780
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:42,020
and because it's in my own backyard, but I prefer Disneyland over Disney World.

781
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:47,000
Yeah, we've had that debate on the on the on the podcast before.

782
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:49,940
But I think when you just the amount of rides

783
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:52,880
and amount of things you can just do in Disneyland versus Magic Kingdom,

784
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:55,080
I still think you got to give it to Disneyland.

785
00:37:56,980 --> 00:38:01,020
I mean, I guess for one or two day experience, I would say Disneyland.

786
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:04,200
But for a whole week, it's it really depends on what you're

787
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,460
what you're talking about. Right.

788
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:08,360
But there's no boathouse in Anaheim, though, which is one of the.

789
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:10,720
That is true. The downtown Disney.

790
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,160
I'm not a big fan of that.

791
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:13,180
Well, it's getting better.

792
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:16,840
We've got the cool bowling alley now and we've got some ice cream.

793
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:18,560
So let's go. Yeah.

794
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:20,000
Splits. Oh, we have that.

795
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,720
I'm next. Next time you're out, I vote yes on Splitsville.

796
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,380
I haven't bowled there, but I've eaten there.

797
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,900
There is a splice fill in Orlando. Oh, that's right.

798
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:29,380
Oh, how's the splice fill in Orlando?

799
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:32,440
It's OK. Overpriced bowling. Yeah.

800
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:33,920
Yeah. Overpriced food, too.

801
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:37,540
But, you know, decent food is in short supply in the Disneyland resort.

802
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:42,340
So I'll take what I can get and I'll pay 30 percent too much for it.

803
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:45,700
I actually think the food's like the better at Disneyland in Disney World.

804
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,040
It is better. Yeah.

805
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:49,220
Well, you got like quick service food.

806
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:51,740
Yeah, yeah. There's a little more variety.

807
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:55,720
Yeah. Florida quick service food is still a lot of burgers

808
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:58,640
and and pizza and stuff for the tourists.

809
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:04,200
We when you search your name and theme parks, I forgot all about this.

810
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:08,120
If I ever if I maybe didn't even know it at all, is that like last year

811
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:12,900
you did all six parks in like 48 hours. Is that right?

812
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:16,840
Yeah, yeah. Less than 48 hours. Yeah. So pretty wild.

813
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,220
How many hours I would recommend?

814
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:20,600
I would recommend doing it.

815
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:25,740
No, maybe it was maybe it was like so I started off at

816
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:30,820
California Adventure Disneyland and then I took a red eye back to Orlando

817
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:35,400
and I slept on the plane, went to my house, took a shower

818
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,880
and then did the four parks.

819
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:40,580
So it was like just under two days. Right. Right. Wow.

820
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:41,660
Then did you got it done?

821
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,540
Then how many rides per park?

822
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:45,860
I would say a decent amount.

823
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,260
I didn't write everything down.

824
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:50,200
I was obviously I didn't everything, but enough where it was like

825
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,860
I didn't just walk in and leave, you know, and I made sure I did

826
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:54,520
like the heavy hitters in each park.

827
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:58,580
A substantial. How did you get from even just the single day

828
00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:02,120
at Disney World is imposing doing four parks in a single day.

829
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,860
How did you make it from park to park?

830
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:07,060
For a couple of months, they had this thing that it's not there anymore.

831
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:10,780
And I think it's not there because one of my theories is

832
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:12,000
because they didn't really advertise it.

833
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,300
It was this this bus that you just I think was like thirty dollars

834
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:16,020
for the day.

835
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:18,520
And you went to these secret locations around the park

836
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:21,860
and you would take this bus just right to the back entrance of park

837
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:22,620
to park to park.

838
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,960
And it was like twenty five, thirty bucks a day.

839
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:25,840
I forgot what it was called.

840
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:27,800
Yeah, it was only around for like six months.

841
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:30,200
They were trying that for a while where like the load

842
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:33,260
and unload areas were technically backstage.

843
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:35,300
But like anyone could sign up for it.

844
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:39,000
But it seemed like, yeah, it seemed like they wanted people to do it.

845
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,360
But like you said, they did not advertise it.

846
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,220
And then I think they shift.

847
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,280
Like it wasn't even at the ticket window.

848
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,600
You had to ask for it.

849
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:49,520
Yeah. And now I think they're trying to push people into that mini vans

850
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:50,920
service they're doing with the lift.

851
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:53,020
Right. That what a what a what a scam.

852
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:54,740
Oh, it's incredible.

853
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:56,400
Oh, what a scam.

854
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:59,360
Have you done it yet? Have you been in one of the mini vans?

855
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:00,640
I refuse. What's the point?

856
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:02,060
I could just use an Uber or a lift.

857
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:06,180
Why why pay double or triple the price because it has many

858
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:07,840
mouse like dots on it.

859
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:10,020
Yeah, no, I think we talked about on the show.

860
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:13,500
I think we said like if if like many was driving, that would be worth it.

861
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:16,940
Sure. But if it's just a regular person, then who cares?

862
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:21,400
Now, with that being said, I also refuse to take Disney buses

863
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,700
and I Uber everywhere. Oh, wow.

864
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:24,580
From park to park.

865
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:27,560
I refuse. The buses suck. I refuse to do it.

866
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:28,700
Huh? I didn't know.

867
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:30,020
They're never on time. They're crowded.

868
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:31,580
They stop too many places.

869
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:33,600
Yeah. Not for me.

870
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:35,520
And haven't been updated in a long time.

871
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:38,920
I don't think I realized you could Uber from park to park.

872
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:41,500
I haven't been down there in the age of Uber,

873
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:43,640
but that's pretty comfortable and easy.

874
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:45,640
Uber, it's so easy.

875
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:48,240
You can Uber from everywhere from hotel to hotel,

876
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:50,140
hotel, park to Disney Springs.

877
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:54,100
I didn't know if they cut down on that, like in the way an airport does,

878
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:56,320
but I guess not. That's that's cool.

879
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,860
Wow. Huh. You got it figured out.

880
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,600
I would say I've it all figured out.

881
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:03,500
But what works for me, you know? Sure.

882
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:08,200
Was there was there a particular highlight of the of the two day marathon?

883
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:11,800
Just that I survived, really.

884
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:14,880
Yeah, sure.

885
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:16,400
It was a lot of fun.

886
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:19,180
And like I said, like I don't go to Disneyland that often.

887
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:21,900
So even when I go now,

888
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:25,960
it's I still use like the map, you know, I don't really know where everything is.

889
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,280
And I like that.

890
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:30,120
Yeah, it reminds me of like going on vacation as a kid.

891
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:32,760
Like you're discovering you can discover some around the corner.

892
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:35,560
But you've been on like you go like once a year, maybe Disneyland.

893
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:39,000
Yeah, the past few years I've gone at least once a year.

894
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,300
Yeah, for sure. Right.

895
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:42,780
So you've done like Guardians of the Galaxy and.

896
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:43,400
Yeah, done.

897
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:46,940
Guardian is Cars Land, all that stuff. Right.

898
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:51,020
Do you have a favorite robot in all six parks?

899
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:53,020
Favorite robot?

900
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:53,440
Oh, yeah.

901
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,920
Animatronic on a ride or even even like Sunny.

902
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:56,660
Oh, OK.

903
00:42:58,060 --> 00:43:00,900
So I like Sunny Eclipse, but.

904
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:03,680
Huh, I never really thought about that.

905
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:04,760
Nice.

906
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:06,760
We think about it too much.

907
00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:09,700
Uh.

908
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:13,780
Huh, I like that Sunny Eclipse answer, actually.

909
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:14,440
It's pretty good.

910
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:18,300
Sure. I'm glad that's not on your list of stuff to tear out of there.

911
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:21,140
I'm glad you're the Sunnyside Preservation Society.

912
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:24,200
When I was a kid, like with my family, like

913
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:25,940
I didn't know there was like

914
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:28,620
like four star like dining on Disney property.

915
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:30,940
I know there's real restaurants, you know, we would go to,

916
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:32,880
you know, to go eat at like whatever that.

917
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:35,540
I don't even know what it's called, where Sunny Eclipse is playing.

918
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:38,160
Cosmic Ray Starlight Cafe.

919
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:39,820
Right, right.

920
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:41,820
So like that was like that is like what I remember.

921
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:43,180
Like my parents are going to treat us.

922
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:44,560
We're going to Cosmic Ray's.

923
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:46,700
So like I used to love going there as a kid.

924
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:50,300
Which is the most like hamburger hot dog chicken finger.

925
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:51,380
Exactly.

926
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:55,240
I remember just squirting copious piles of ketchup and mustard

927
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:56,980
onto the most basic burger.

928
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:00,800
No vegetables, nothing like additive to it.

929
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:05,140
Just just just pure crap hot dog and watching a robot for a while.

930
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:05,700
Paradise.

931
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:09,240
My family always liked Cosmic Ray's.

932
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:12,280
Like my parents were would always acquiesce to eating there

933
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:15,920
because there was at least a toppings bar with like

934
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:18,840
fried mushroom fried on it like and cheese sauce.

935
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:22,440
So you could at least dress up like the standard Disney burger,

936
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:24,200
like a Fuddruckers almost.

937
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:26,300
But not as good as Fuddruckers.

938
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:27,600
No, not as good.

939
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:29,920
We're really selling this restaurant.

940
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:33,660
Not as good as Fuddruckers and less robots than Chuck E. Cheese.

941
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:36,380
What's the Disneyland equivalent called?

942
00:44:38,020 --> 00:44:40,460
It's like without the outside seating in Tomorrowland.

943
00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:41,540
This is like the burgers and stuff.

944
00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:44,040
What's that called? Oh, the Tomorrowland Terrace.

945
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:46,400
Yeah, I actually like I like those burgers a lot.

946
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:49,000
I was just there, I think, in February and I got some some burger.

947
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:49,900
It was delicious.

948
00:44:50,860 --> 00:44:53,020
Yeah, it's certainly like

949
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:55,760
I haven't had a burger in a while there, but last time I had it,

950
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:56,700
I was like, oh, pretty good.

951
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:58,920
And then the last time I think I ate at Cosmic Ray's, I was like,

952
00:44:58,920 --> 00:44:59,760
this is terrible.

953
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:04,500
So, yeah, I think that that's a terrace is better for sure than Ray's,

954
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:07,140
but doesn't have a robot. So it's, you know, that's true.

955
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:11,860
If you ever do Paris, do not do the Tomorrowland restaurant

956
00:45:11,860 --> 00:45:14,120
or the Discoveryland restaurant.

957
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:17,820
I had just a basic burger there and that was garbage.

958
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:20,860
That was the worst meal of a two week Europe vacation.

959
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:23,720
I've only done the domestic parks.

960
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:27,480
I can't wait to do the other the other Disney parks.

961
00:45:27,740 --> 00:45:29,460
Yeah, like bucket list for me.

962
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:33,080
Sure. Yeah. I just did Tokyo and it is as good as people say.

963
00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:35,420
That's awesome. Yeah.

964
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:37,360
So let's see.

965
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:41,040
I was listening to the interview with Jericho and you were

966
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:44,520
or Cody was talking about how you have rules for like theme parks.

967
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:47,580
And I was wondering, he

968
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:49,720
mentioned specifically, like if you're at Universal

969
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:52,660
and you see somebody wearing a Disney shirt, you will be like, hey,

970
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:53,920
wrong park or something.

971
00:45:54,220 --> 00:45:55,660
That is true. Yes, that is true.

972
00:45:55,660 --> 00:45:59,480
Are there other like sort of feelings you have about like just, you know,

973
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:03,220
what the outfit you should wear at theme parks is or what like

974
00:46:03,220 --> 00:46:07,320
like we had a guest on Jessica McKenna who said like, some people wear

975
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:12,120
like the gaudiest like theme park stuff and then and she's not kind of cool with it.

976
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:14,980
Or if somebody's dressed as Captain Jack Sparrow, that's lame.

977
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:18,900
Like when somebody's got the full like wig on that makes them look like

978
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:19,840
the Johnny Depp character.

979
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:22,480
But like, do you have any feelings about that, how you should dress,

980
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:23,360
how you should act?

981
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:27,920
Well, see, when I did that interview with Cody and Jericho,

982
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,620
I was at a different time in my life.

983
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:31,180
I wasn't living in Orlando.

984
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:35,020
So Cody and I, we would go to the parks every couple of months together.

985
00:46:35,020 --> 00:46:39,100
And I just hated his style because he was a big like sit on bench guy.

986
00:46:39,180 --> 00:46:40,660
Like get a beer, just sit on the bench.

987
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:42,880
And like I was like, no, no, no, we got to hit every single ride.

988
00:46:43,060 --> 00:46:45,600
I had like I had a, you know, like a map in my head.

989
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:48,080
We got to do this, this, this and this, you know, a whole like checklist

990
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:49,120
of all these things we need to do.

991
00:46:49,220 --> 00:46:52,880
But now that I live here and I can take my time, like now I'm like

992
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:55,800
I'm like Cody, like, oh, if we don't do Space Mountain this time,

993
00:46:55,860 --> 00:46:56,760
we'll do it next time.

994
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:57,420
You know what I'm saying?

995
00:46:57,740 --> 00:46:59,740
Right. Before I needed to hit everything.

996
00:47:00,140 --> 00:47:03,700
Like I needed to be there at rope drop and stay till the very end.

997
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:05,500
But now I'll go whenever I want.

998
00:47:05,580 --> 00:47:07,740
Going for a couple of rides, get something to eat, I'll leave.

999
00:47:07,820 --> 00:47:09,700
But that's because I'm spoiled and I live here.

1000
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:13,380
Sure. So you've so you've loosened up even on the dress situation.

1001
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:15,780
Like somebody dressed like.

1002
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:18,720
I used to be very like I used to be very bad.

1003
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:20,780
We're like you could only wear a Disney shirt

1004
00:47:20,780 --> 00:47:22,940
if it's like a Disney parks official shirt.

1005
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:24,680
You couldn't wear a Target Disney shirt.

1006
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:25,660
Oh, interesting.

1007
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:29,200
But I've since I've relaxed on that.

1008
00:47:29,340 --> 00:47:31,980
I myself have like, you know, there's cool Disney shirts all over the Internet.

1009
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:34,220
Target has great stuff. Very soft shirts.

1010
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:36,140
Sure. Oh, I love. Yeah.

1011
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:37,400
I love Target stuff.

1012
00:47:37,620 --> 00:47:39,340
I agree with you. I have a couple of them.

1013
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:43,020
But one of my Mickey shirts is like so like it's like it feels like it's wilting.

1014
00:47:43,100 --> 00:47:44,320
Like it's it's so thin.

1015
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:46,420
It's about to like I had to make it a sleep shirt.

1016
00:47:46,660 --> 00:47:47,960
And now I think I just have to throw it away.

1017
00:47:48,220 --> 00:47:49,420
But I love how soft it was.

1018
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:50,580
So I agree. Totally. Right.

1019
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:56,320
That a unit in Disney Springs just has tons of like cool oddball stuff

1020
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:59,800
for like a third of the price of the actual park shirts.

1021
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:01,240
Yes, yes.

1022
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:02,880
This is the best I've done.

1023
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:04,420
Yeah, I would.

1024
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:06,340
I was there for a little bit and I loved it.

1025
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:11,460
Do you have a lot of clothing like you have a lot of toys and stuff like that?

1026
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:13,320
But you have do you collect shirts and stuff?

1027
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:15,880
Because I'm I'm I'm a decent toy collector.

1028
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:19,560
I have a like for again, for a regular civilian,

1029
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:24,140
I have too many toys in time, but I collect a lot of shirts, too.

1030
00:48:24,140 --> 00:48:26,460
So I feel like I have maybe like something crazy,

1031
00:48:26,460 --> 00:48:29,240
like 60 shirts that have things on it.

1032
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:32,740
Oh, wow. I don't collect Disney shirts.

1033
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:37,460
I do have a lot, but I'm someone where like after where like for

1034
00:48:37,460 --> 00:48:39,640
I don't know if I have for a year or two, I'll give it to like Goodwill or something.

1035
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:42,520
I'm not keeping it forever. Right. Sure. Sure.

1036
00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:45,160
And I love to rotate it out of my collection.

1037
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:47,120
I just got it's a collection or anything.

1038
00:48:47,140 --> 00:48:51,500
Right. I just got an Oliver and Company shirt from Hot Topic on Black Friday.

1039
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:54,000
Well, wait a minute. What? Yeah.

1040
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,760
The movie Oliver and Company.

1041
00:48:55,980 --> 00:49:00,080
No, I know. It's my favorite favorite Disney movie that gets no respect.

1042
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:02,540
No love. Yeah. No respect and good songs in it.

1043
00:49:02,540 --> 00:49:04,520
We were just talking about this the other day, too.

1044
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:06,460
Oliver. I'm busy.

1045
00:49:07,220 --> 00:49:11,460
So there's like there's like two or three new Hot Topic Oliver

1046
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:14,220
and Company shirts, and then I found I need to go.

1047
00:49:14,220 --> 00:49:15,700
I need to go to Hot Topic tomorrow.

1048
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:21,240
I got joking. Yeah, no, there's a bunch of like there's like rescuer shirts now.

1049
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:25,720
I saw they're doing a whole line of these for like we're all around the same age.

1050
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:28,560
I think so. We all had the same references when we were a kid.

1051
00:49:28,940 --> 00:49:31,680
So they're doing they're like catering right to us now.

1052
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:33,540
So I did not get all of them.

1053
00:49:33,540 --> 00:49:38,260
I was very, you know, I was conservative and only got one of the Oliver and Company shirts.

1054
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:41,580
But yeah, they're they're doing it right over there at Hot Topic.

1055
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:43,120
Like what a world we live in now.

1056
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:47,100
If I was a little kid and my dad was like in his mid 30s

1057
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:51,860
wearing a Disney like shirt and brag about it, he was like a weird dude.

1058
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:55,900
Yeah, no, he'd be locked up, be sent away.

1059
00:49:56,980 --> 00:49:59,760
But now, I mean, I'm going to go to Hot Topic tomorrow and get that shirt.

1060
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:04,080
Yeah, I hope they have it because I had ordered online and the woman when she

1061
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:06,920
when the online order came, she was like shocked to see it.

1062
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:10,740
So I would I would maybe call ahead to make sure they have it in store.

1063
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,100
And if not, obviously, you have to order it online.

1064
00:50:13,860 --> 00:50:16,520
So, yeah, no, the world has changed a lot.

1065
00:50:16,740 --> 00:50:23,040
And what being in your mid 30s means is a lot different than it was 30 years ago.

1066
00:50:23,340 --> 00:50:25,800
Right. Which in your case, toys.

1067
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:29,020
Oh, yeah. Let's let's talk about this.

1068
00:50:29,140 --> 00:50:30,400
What what do you like?

1069
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:34,840
What's going on in the collection in terms of Disney, in terms of

1070
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:37,840
park affiliated toy business?

1071
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:42,200
Yeah, so I have a a whole room.

1072
00:50:42,380 --> 00:50:43,520
It's just my toy room.

1073
00:50:43,580 --> 00:50:45,460
It's all these toys on display.

1074
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:48,880
And the room isn't super duper big, but it's a decent sized room.

1075
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:53,040
And I do have two cases full of Disney stuff.

1076
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:57,860
You know, I I really was into as a kid, remember those ceramic

1077
00:50:57,860 --> 00:51:01,160
like glass figurines they would sell at the parks? Yeah.

1078
00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:04,520
They make like every character like imaginable.

1079
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:06,920
They will sell like the Disney store and stuff like that.

1080
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:08,160
They don't they don't make them anymore.

1081
00:51:08,420 --> 00:51:13,180
But I had them as a kid and I went back and I got the ones I was missing.

1082
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:14,420
And my mom's been going crazy.

1083
00:51:14,460 --> 00:51:17,920
And she's been like, I told her I wanted a couple of them like every couple of weeks.

1084
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:21,680
I'll be like, oh, here's a box of the, you know, the beauty of the beast ceramic figures.

1085
00:51:21,740 --> 00:51:23,420
Like, oh, well, thanks, mom. I don't really have room for all this.

1086
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:25,360
But thank you. You know.

1087
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:27,980
So, yeah, I have a lot of Disney stuff.

1088
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:32,340
And now this this company, I'm sure you know, Funko.

1089
00:51:32,540 --> 00:51:33,480
Oh, yeah, sure. Yeah.

1090
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:36,300
Funko pops. So they have tons of Disney.

1091
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:38,060
Funko pops.

1092
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:41,700
And they have a lot of park exclusives, which are real pain in the ass to get.

1093
00:51:41,780 --> 00:51:43,180
Oh, we know. Oh, yeah.

1094
00:51:43,580 --> 00:51:45,660
That's a story I had a few months ago.

1095
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:50,760
I was down at the park and I happened to open Twitter and a theme park news

1096
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:56,440
site had said a store in downtown Disney has the Splash Mountain ones in stock.

1097
00:51:56,500 --> 00:52:00,620
And I texted Mike and I've never gotten a reply so fast as him going,

1098
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:02,320
get me two of them.

1099
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:06,560
And I walked in and I did get to they had about

1100
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:08,720
like 15 and 12 in stock.

1101
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:09,720
I bought two.

1102
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:12,620
And when I walked by at the end of the day, they were all gone.

1103
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:17,020
Yeah, I mean, I love those things.

1104
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:20,040
So did you did you get the Splash Mountain one?

1105
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:21,700
I had the Splash Mountain one.

1106
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:24,200
I didn't get it. I had to get it off someone on the Internet.

1107
00:52:24,260 --> 00:52:26,020
Do a little trade. Sure.

1108
00:52:26,580 --> 00:52:27,860
Do you are. Yeah.

1109
00:52:27,860 --> 00:52:32,300
Is there a criteria like when you're looking for Disney stuff, is the criteria

1110
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:36,460
it has to be sort of theme park specific because I think that's my general

1111
00:52:36,460 --> 00:52:41,080
criteria with collecting like I like characters from the park specifically.

1112
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:45,720
Well, for me, you know, Disney World and Disney in general,

1113
00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:47,620
the merchandise isn't going to run out.

1114
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:48,880
It's never ending.

1115
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:53,900
So I need to be very, very, very specific. Right. So

1116
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:55,620
we were just talking about Oliver Company.

1117
00:52:55,700 --> 00:52:59,540
I have the McDonald's Oliver and Company, like Happy Meal Toys.

1118
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:00,960
Yeah, I have those in my collection.

1119
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:02,520
I think I got those. That's great.

1120
00:53:02,620 --> 00:53:04,040
I remember the ads. Yeah.

1121
00:53:04,060 --> 00:53:06,180
Heartwarming McDonald's ads from the 80s.

1122
00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:09,040
Yes. I also got the McDonald's.

1123
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:13,340
They made like Epcot, like all the different countries toys.

1124
00:53:13,540 --> 00:53:17,780
Oh, so it's like Mickey Mouse, Mickey Mouse, like red, white, blue Mickey Mouse.

1125
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:18,880
You know. Oh, OK.

1126
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:23,620
So like he's got like a sweater with the French flag on it or something.

1127
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:27,340
No, you got to throw it in your Google machine and pick these up.

1128
00:53:27,460 --> 00:53:28,200
They're incredible.

1129
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:32,520
Are any of them, you know, racially questionable?

1130
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:35,600
Oh, I don't think so.

1131
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:38,880
Nobody's in like a hat that they shouldn't be in.

1132
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:40,880
Nothing. No funny business.

1133
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:43,080
No, I don't think so.

1134
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:46,660
No, I think it'd be offensive to the Norwegian people.

1135
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:48,800
No, I think I mean.

1136
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:50,660
I think it's OK.

1137
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:52,520
All right. Well, then I must be fine.

1138
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:56,140
Yes. So are those plush or are those like plastic?

1139
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:58,720
It's just little plastic like Happy Bill toys.

1140
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:00,780
OK, I'm looking through.

1141
00:54:00,980 --> 00:54:02,920
I see plush. I see plush.

1142
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:04,440
When I Google.

1143
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:06,780
We'll find it later.

1144
00:54:07,180 --> 00:54:08,260
I'm sure there's plastics.

1145
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:13,840
I know this is this is tangential, but I'm just I'm very proud of my

1146
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:18,120
full set of Mac tonight, riding different little vehicles

1147
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:23,080
like this kind of like a 50s Cadillac and a little little biplane

1148
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:27,600
and a scooter, like every type of car somebody can operate.

1149
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:32,460
And my beloved McDonald's Moon Man Mac tonight is piloting them all.

1150
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:34,500
That's that's a fun set.

1151
00:54:34,620 --> 00:54:37,620
I recommend that one if you have any Mac tonight interest.

1152
00:54:39,060 --> 00:54:43,220
Matt, were you a fan of Mac tonight, the Moon Man from McDonald's?

1153
00:54:43,260 --> 00:54:45,840
I remember it. I had some of those toys, too,

1154
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:47,880
but I don't have them currently in my collection.

1155
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:52,000
No. Oh, you ever been to the the world's largest McDonald's down there in Orlando?

1156
00:54:53,620 --> 00:54:55,220
I don't think so. Where's that?

1157
00:54:55,220 --> 00:54:56,240
Oh, look it up.

1158
00:54:56,260 --> 00:54:59,580
Now, I can't attest to what it's like now, but

1159
00:54:59,580 --> 00:55:01,780
this is a this is a case.

1160
00:55:01,940 --> 00:55:06,160
It was a case where I just I was talking to somebody who I'd never met.

1161
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:07,380
A stranger has stuck up.

1162
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:11,020
I had a conversation with on a set and he's like, you know, like in Orlando,

1163
00:55:11,020 --> 00:55:14,820
there's this big old it's a two story McDonald's and there's pizza

1164
00:55:14,820 --> 00:55:18,060
and ice cream and a record your own karaoke booth

1165
00:55:18,060 --> 00:55:21,900
and a Mac tonight robot in the restaurant.

1166
00:55:22,100 --> 00:55:23,700
And that's all I needed to hear.

1167
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:26,700
And I booked a trip to Orlando several days later.

1168
00:55:27,260 --> 00:55:28,220
How about to be there?

1169
00:55:28,420 --> 00:55:30,880
I could not let I could not let a lot of weeks pass.

1170
00:55:31,060 --> 00:55:33,800
And I don't know if the Mac is still there,

1171
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:39,180
but it still is a gigantic, gaudy, like awful to look at McDonald's.

1172
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:40,340
And it is in your area.

1173
00:55:40,340 --> 00:55:42,400
I think it's in the I drive zone.

1174
00:55:43,580 --> 00:55:45,840
OK, that's like probably a half hour or so for me.

1175
00:55:45,940 --> 00:55:47,420
That's that's where all the tourist stuff is.

1176
00:55:47,420 --> 00:55:49,040
So that makes sense. Sure, sure.

1177
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:51,660
It's over by where the American Gladiators

1178
00:55:51,660 --> 00:55:54,700
theater used to be that now is a mega church.

1179
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:57,660
The American Gladiators theater was this.

1180
00:55:57,760 --> 00:55:58,620
I don't remember that.

1181
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:05,020
There was kind of a medieval times dinner theater situation in Orlando.

1182
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:08,020
But that what that was for American Gladiators.

1183
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:10,460
And they got gladiators from the show.

1184
00:56:10,460 --> 00:56:13,020
But also, like tourists would compete.

1185
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:17,060
But like, how did they possibly have people every week to like

1186
00:56:17,060 --> 00:56:19,280
you could tape a TV show every week.

1187
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:22,560
But how do you have enough tourists who are like physically capable of going

1188
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:24,760
against the gladiators? I don't know.

1189
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:26,800
I think it was only open for like two years and it closed.

1190
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:29,340
And it's a church now like a big Baptist church.

1191
00:56:29,340 --> 00:56:31,780
I was a big American Gladiators fan.

1192
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:34,040
Oh, geez. Yeah, yeah, I bet.

1193
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:37,860
Anyone that you admired in particular?

1194
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:41,740
I think like Nitro, is that one of them?

1195
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:44,860
I assume it sounds like one. Yeah.

1196
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:50,440
When I was a kid, I had an American Gladiators birthday party in my backyard.

1197
00:56:51,100 --> 00:56:55,160
And it was my dad used to own these bodybuilding gyms and some jacked up guy.

1198
00:56:56,260 --> 00:57:00,020
He was the American Gladiator and he was all dressed up and everything like that.

1199
00:57:00,020 --> 00:57:00,800
So it was fun.

1200
00:57:01,660 --> 00:57:05,900
Wow. If you had to choose between if you if you were like

1201
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:11,440
actively seeking employment in the Orlando area as like a medieval nights

1202
00:57:12,620 --> 00:57:13,740
jouster or times.

1203
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:17,360
Oh, yeah. Medieval times rather medieval times like Jouster guy

1204
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:23,280
or a pirate's dinner adventure, a swashbuckler swinging around on a rope.

1205
00:57:23,580 --> 00:57:27,400
Or let's say gladiators is there still or I might be missing one.

1206
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:31,160
But if you were going to be in you were going to hit the Orlando

1207
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:34,440
dinner theater scene, what would you choose?

1208
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:39,100
I think I'd rather be like Tigger, like a character breakfast.

1209
00:57:41,140 --> 00:57:42,360
That's a lot easier.

1210
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:44,300
It's less physically taxing.

1211
00:57:44,460 --> 00:57:45,860
Oh, I'm a big fan.

1212
00:57:45,860 --> 00:57:47,700
I'm a sucker for a character breakfast.

1213
00:57:48,380 --> 00:57:50,860
Really? So do you still do the character breakfast now once in a while?

1214
00:57:51,740 --> 00:57:53,340
Every once in a while, I'll do it.

1215
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:55,440
100 percent. Yeah, I love a lot.

1216
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:57,280
A lot of people, even if they're big theme

1217
00:57:57,280 --> 00:58:00,860
partners, sometimes they are they look at me strangely because I do want to take

1218
00:58:00,860 --> 00:58:02,900
photos with the characters like I think I've taken.

1219
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:04,580
You got you got to do it.

1220
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:06,240
I agree. Yeah, I understand.

1221
00:58:06,660 --> 00:58:09,640
You know, I'm not going to be the same character every single time I go,

1222
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:12,600
but you got to go and, you know, I just met Mickey the other night,

1223
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:15,020
which I'm very upset because now

1224
00:58:15,020 --> 00:58:18,280
Mickey doesn't talk anymore, but he used to talk in Magic Kingdom.

1225
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:19,960
They took that away.

1226
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:21,140
Yeah, that's sad.

1227
00:58:21,580 --> 00:58:25,480
They when I was there last, like a year ago, we went in

1228
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:28,260
and we knew he was talking, but we went into a room and he wasn't talking.

1229
00:58:28,260 --> 00:58:31,160
And then I went up to like town hall to complain.

1230
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:33,960
And they were like, well, you know, he's not always guaranteed

1231
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:35,800
to be doing something like that.

1232
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:38,080
And they go, you can go back and you can ask somebody

1233
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:40,000
if Mickey is feeling talkative today.

1234
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,240
And they like winked at me.

1235
00:58:41,660 --> 00:58:42,940
And then we did it again.

1236
00:58:42,940 --> 00:58:45,640
And he talked and it was all it was like amazing.

1237
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:47,820
But it's so good, right? It's so good.

1238
00:58:48,140 --> 00:58:50,840
You've seen the video where he speaks Japanese to some tourists.

1239
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:52,600
I have not seen that.

1240
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:56,680
So Mickey was speaking Japanese to tourists like he was doing the impossible.

1241
00:58:56,680 --> 00:58:57,580
And now it's gone.

1242
00:58:57,640 --> 00:58:58,340
And I don't know why.

1243
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:00,500
I think the head was malfunctioning or something.

1244
00:59:00,840 --> 00:59:03,840
I heard and who knows that this is true, that, you know,

1245
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:06,440
people were complaining that he wasn't talking everywhere.

1246
00:59:06,820 --> 00:59:07,800
Oh, interesting.

1247
00:59:08,940 --> 00:59:12,720
So until the technology gets cheaper, they won't have one Mickey that talks.

1248
00:59:13,540 --> 00:59:14,340
I mean, who knows?

1249
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:16,100
I thought I thought it was great.

1250
00:59:16,260 --> 00:59:18,320
I thought it was special that in the front, he would talk.

1251
00:59:18,660 --> 00:59:19,440
I agree.

1252
00:59:19,660 --> 00:59:23,560
Can I just back up and say, Mike, you went to City Hall to complain

1253
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:25,940
about a Mickey related issue.

1254
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:29,740
Yes, I we had a fast pass, one of our precious fast passes

1255
00:59:29,740 --> 00:59:31,660
for that Mickey meet and greet.

1256
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:34,400
And I was telling my girlfriend, Lindsay, over and over,

1257
00:59:34,420 --> 00:59:35,640
I go, Mickey's going to talk to us.

1258
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:37,080
Mickey's going to say something.

1259
00:59:37,540 --> 00:59:39,280
And I'm like, I was very excited about it.

1260
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:42,160
And then you get in the room and Mickey Mickey keeps his mouth shut.

1261
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:43,720
And I was upset about it.

1262
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:47,060
So we went across the street and I was like, hey, I've seen online

1263
00:59:47,060 --> 00:59:50,200
that Mickey talks and they were like they were weird

1264
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:53,240
because they wouldn't confirm that he talks either, which I found very

1265
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:56,220
like weird and suspicious, but obviously they don't want to promise things.

1266
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:59,900
That's why there was never anything like come see Mickey, have him talk to you,

1267
01:00:00,100 --> 01:00:01,140
hear him speak Japanese.

1268
01:00:01,140 --> 01:00:02,520
They wouldn't say that.

1269
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:04,760
So they gave me another fast pass.

1270
01:00:04,980 --> 01:00:08,100
But I mean, it was like such a big part of my excitement to go to Magic Kingdom

1271
01:00:08,100 --> 01:00:11,220
is to hear Mickey say hello.

1272
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:15,600
Hmm. Was it equally exciting, though, to lodge a complaint

1273
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:17,920
at the formal establishment City Hall?

1274
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:22,340
Well, look, I don't like I feel like Jason is better at like lodging complaints

1275
01:00:22,340 --> 01:00:23,920
than I am in general.

1276
01:00:23,940 --> 01:00:27,640
So I look I wasn't happy to do it, but it was necessary is what I'm saying.

1277
01:00:28,520 --> 01:00:29,660
I needed to do this.

1278
01:00:29,660 --> 01:00:31,660
I needed to complain for you. Yes.

1279
01:00:31,880 --> 01:00:34,320
Matt, do you complain once in a while at these parks?

1280
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:38,560
I was about to say I don't think I've ever complained at the parks.

1281
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:42,540
I don't I honestly I'm trying to think of another time I did.

1282
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:45,220
I cannot think of another instance where I complained.

1283
01:00:45,220 --> 01:00:50,080
But this one, I was very I was adamant that we needed to get to talking Mickey.

1284
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:54,700
Yeah, there are there are people I know that are like like complaining and like

1285
01:00:54,700 --> 01:00:58,680
getting free stuff, but I'm much more of like I would send an email later.

1286
01:00:58,680 --> 01:00:59,720
I'm not a confrontation.

1287
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:03,480
Yeah, OK. I would do like a public tweet and bash them.

1288
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:04,280
Oh, yeah.

1289
01:01:04,540 --> 01:01:09,100
I mean, that's the fastest way for you. Yeah.

1290
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:13,200
You have a lot of followers, so that would certainly get their attention.

1291
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:14,540
The most damage once.

1292
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:16,180
Yes. Just kidding. I'm just kidding.

1293
01:01:16,380 --> 01:01:18,480
You wouldn't do that to Disney.

1294
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:19,940
You would do it to some other park.

1295
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:23,320
You would publicly bash SeaWorld on Twitter.

1296
01:01:26,940 --> 01:01:31,500
If it came to that, if it came to that, if it came to the Hilton company can take it.

1297
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:32,140
Yeah.

1298
01:01:32,140 --> 01:01:35,160
Oh, yes, Mike, a couple.

1299
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:38,980
Yes. On your podcast, which is very good, I recommend everybody if they like figures,

1300
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:42,800
if they like if they like another podcast about people in their 30s

1301
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:47,200
with a very specific interest, I highly recommend your podcast.

1302
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:51,720
You were talking about looking for these specific parks toys,

1303
01:01:51,720 --> 01:01:56,380
which I never I didn't know they existed, but they look like the characters

1304
01:01:56,380 --> 01:01:57,620
in costume specifically.

1305
01:01:57,760 --> 01:02:00,200
So it's Mickey, Minnie, Donald, Goofy and Daisy.

1306
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:04,600
But they look specifically like human beings might be inside them.

1307
01:02:04,740 --> 01:02:07,120
Like you would see them in the parks.

1308
01:02:07,260 --> 01:02:08,540
Oh, I see what you're saying. Yes.

1309
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:11,100
These look exactly they don't look like cartoon characters.

1310
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:12,740
They look like human proportions.

1311
01:02:12,760 --> 01:02:14,340
Daisy and Donald and whatever.

1312
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:15,720
And I just like it.

1313
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:17,680
Maybe I missed it on the show. But is there an update?

1314
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:19,360
Did you finally track these down?

1315
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:21,980
You were looking for a very specific type of them, too.

1316
01:02:22,580 --> 01:02:24,760
So I'm looking for the Minnie Mouse.

1317
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:26,220
I do have the rest of them.

1318
01:02:26,300 --> 01:02:27,420
The Minnie I don't have.

1319
01:02:27,640 --> 01:02:28,680
And I thought I got lucky.

1320
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:34,200
I found the the Tokyo Disneyland version of Minnie, but she's not the same.

1321
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:37,740
It looked exactly the same, but she's on a Tokyo Disneyland stand.

1322
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:39,400
She she's like glued to it.

1323
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:40,360
She won't come off it.

1324
01:02:40,360 --> 01:02:41,760
So I can't use that.

1325
01:02:41,980 --> 01:02:43,860
I need the the US one.

1326
01:02:44,220 --> 01:02:48,980
OK, so you have everyone but Minnie and it's a US specific stand for her.

1327
01:02:48,980 --> 01:02:51,420
She's in that same pose where she's got like one leg in the right.

1328
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:52,680
And she's holding her figure.

1329
01:02:52,680 --> 01:02:54,260
The figurine is exactly the same.

1330
01:02:54,420 --> 01:02:57,340
But on the US ones, they're able to come off their stands.

1331
01:02:57,340 --> 01:03:00,740
But on the Tokyo ones, they're they're glued in.

1332
01:03:01,140 --> 01:03:03,940
But not only they glued in there, there's like an extra piece

1333
01:03:03,940 --> 01:03:06,780
that's like gets them stuck into the stand.

1334
01:03:06,820 --> 01:03:08,800
So you couldn't even just like rip it off.

1335
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:11,580
I see because there's like an extra little square peg or something.

1336
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:16,120
So it's really it's really pissed me off because I can't find it.

1337
01:03:16,300 --> 01:03:19,380
Matt, I was going to ask, do you have you gone looking for toys

1338
01:03:19,380 --> 01:03:21,260
at the Disney character warehouse?

1339
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:22,680
Do you know what those are?

1340
01:03:23,660 --> 01:03:25,240
I have not been to that. What is that?

1341
01:03:25,320 --> 01:03:27,680
Those are there's two of them in Orlando,

1342
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:31,200
and they are essentially Disney Parks merch outlet malls.

1343
01:03:31,300 --> 01:03:33,640
So stuff merch you would find in the parks,

1344
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:38,840
but like heavily discounted and stuff, oddly enough,

1345
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:41,960
not just from the Orlando parks, but like from all over the world.

1346
01:03:42,060 --> 01:03:44,940
And when I was reading about it today,

1347
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:49,120
the website Touring Plans does like regular runs

1348
01:03:49,120 --> 01:03:51,100
and takes pictures of what is there.

1349
01:03:51,100 --> 01:03:53,300
And I'll post this on our Twitter account.

1350
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:56,660
But they were selling some of I like when these come out,

1351
01:03:56,780 --> 01:03:59,520
these Disney does like mashup stuff sometimes.

1352
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:04,600
So these are this is goofy as Davey Jones from Pirates of the Caribbean.

1353
01:04:05,340 --> 01:04:06,340
And oh, wow. OK.

1354
01:04:06,520 --> 01:04:09,700
Donald as Will Turner from Pirates of the Caribbean,

1355
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:12,620
which is Orlando Bloom's character.

1356
01:04:13,240 --> 01:04:14,680
And they found them.

1357
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:19,120
They they found at this outlet, they found goofy from the American parks

1358
01:04:19,120 --> 01:04:21,820
and then the one they would have sold in either.

1359
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:24,580
I think it they sold in Shanghai.

1360
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:29,380
So you can find some weird stuff at those outlet malls.

1361
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:33,120
It sounds like that's going to be a scary place for your bank account.

1362
01:04:33,260 --> 01:04:34,280
If you go there, Matt.

1363
01:04:35,040 --> 01:04:37,440
Yeah. See, luckily, I'm very specific when it comes to like,

1364
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:39,260
I can't just get random things.

1365
01:04:39,300 --> 01:04:43,780
So if I'm not really looking for something, I might have to just pass on it.

1366
01:04:44,100 --> 01:04:47,440
Did you ever did you do you have any of the they haven't made them

1367
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:49,800
in a couple of years, but they're called Park Stars.

1368
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:53,860
I'm not sure. No, I don't have any. What are those exactly?

1369
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,620
They're like vinyl mation. I could send you a photo of them.

1370
01:04:56,980 --> 01:04:58,440
Oh, I don't do that. I don't do that.

1371
01:04:58,560 --> 01:05:00,780
All right. But hold on. Hold on. Hold on.

1372
01:05:00,900 --> 01:05:02,900
I know you're thinking you're saying vinyl mation.

1373
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:07,280
I don't like that makeup design with the ears and it painted on because I totally agree.

1374
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:10,200
These are vinyl mation, but they are not the Mickey design.

1375
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:14,140
They are their own unique design, but they're all park specific characters.

1376
01:05:14,140 --> 01:05:16,580
And I have six different lines of them.

1377
01:05:16,580 --> 01:05:19,660
I'll send you a picture of them to see if there's something

1378
01:05:19,660 --> 01:05:21,320
like that you would be interested in.

1379
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:23,720
But I was like kind of down on the vinyl mation in general

1380
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:28,080
because I felt like it was sort of a, you know, it just kind of like

1381
01:05:28,080 --> 01:05:30,280
it looked cheap to me here.

1382
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:32,180
I'm sending you on Twitter right now.

1383
01:05:32,180 --> 01:05:36,240
I don't know if you can see this is my collection of Park Stars.

1384
01:05:37,700 --> 01:05:41,380
But we're talking you got Sunny Eclipse, you got Hitchhiking Ghost.

1385
01:05:41,700 --> 01:05:45,400
Oh, wow. You got a Bonable Snowman.

1386
01:05:45,580 --> 01:05:48,000
Yeah, this is like this is all the hits.

1387
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:50,180
This is all killer. No filler. Yeah, exactly.

1388
01:05:50,360 --> 01:05:51,040
So like orange version.

1389
01:05:51,040 --> 01:05:54,940
Cool. Like these I was obsessed with these and it looks like they're not making them anymore,

1390
01:05:54,940 --> 01:05:57,520
which is shocking because we haven't gotten some of the classic characters.

1391
01:05:57,520 --> 01:06:01,620
I was hoping we'd get John from the Carousel of Progress by the time this whole line was done.

1392
01:06:01,640 --> 01:06:04,980
But it looks like they're going to they're going to break my heart and keep it here.

1393
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,260
But they obviously from looking at the photo, like you can see,

1394
01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:11,220
they got they hit a ton of very ride specific characters.

1395
01:06:11,220 --> 01:06:13,360
Carnival, Barker, Potato Head.

1396
01:06:14,120 --> 01:06:15,000
You like which one, sorry?

1397
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:18,440
Figment. Oh, yeah. Figment, the Dreamfinder back there.

1398
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:21,060
Yeah, no, it's so I was obsessed with these.

1399
01:06:21,980 --> 01:06:25,620
But I yeah, I should stop sending you photos of other toys that you could possibly collect.

1400
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,140
I don't I don't. I don't need to do this to you.

1401
01:06:28,820 --> 01:06:31,000
I have my girlfriend wants to kill me. I get way too much stuff.

1402
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:36,680
I have pictures. My favorite theme park toy I own, Zachy or Matt.

1403
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:38,400
Whatever we're calling you.

1404
01:06:38,940 --> 01:06:42,320
Right. I did.

1405
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:46,220
Do you remember the ride Alien Encounter that used to be at the entrance of Tomorrowland?

1406
01:06:46,220 --> 01:06:47,840
Yeah, I loved it.

1407
01:06:48,180 --> 01:06:50,780
Yeah, they they sold for a little while.

1408
01:06:50,860 --> 01:06:53,740
And my mom surprised me one Christmas with them.

1409
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:56,860
They had action figures of Skippy,

1410
01:06:57,280 --> 01:06:59,660
Sir, the robot voice by Tim Curry,

1411
01:06:59,660 --> 01:07:02,840
and then Skippy after he was all crisped up.

1412
01:07:02,840 --> 01:07:06,120
And and then they had one of the alien of the monster.

1413
01:07:06,120 --> 01:07:10,240
And they they came in like tubes like in the ride.

1414
01:07:11,240 --> 01:07:12,420
Wow, that is pretty cool.

1415
01:07:12,660 --> 01:07:15,260
And I mean, they pop up on eBay every now and then.

1416
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:19,060
But they're like for the time for like late night, they're really detailed.

1417
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:22,020
But they're like to packaging.

1418
01:07:22,220 --> 01:07:26,100
I mean, I've taken them out before, but I don't.

1419
01:07:26,260 --> 01:07:29,100
They're still at my parents house.

1420
01:07:29,120 --> 01:07:32,200
And I never like I'm like, I want to bring them back,

1421
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:36,340
but I don't want to damage getting them back across the country.

1422
01:07:37,140 --> 01:07:38,900
Oh, yeah. Do you have any advice for transporting?

1423
01:07:38,900 --> 01:07:41,980
Yeah, because you're doing that a lot when you're going to these places

1424
01:07:41,980 --> 01:07:44,540
because you go to a lot of different toy stores across the country.

1425
01:07:44,540 --> 01:07:46,240
And obviously, you have to ship them back to Orlando.

1426
01:07:47,180 --> 01:07:50,620
Right. Well, you might think I'm crazy, but I don't collect things in the box

1427
01:07:50,620 --> 01:07:52,940
in the packaging, so I take things out of the box.

1428
01:07:52,940 --> 01:07:56,700
So if the package gets damaged, it doesn't bother me.

1429
01:07:56,760 --> 01:07:58,220
That's that's the big thing on our podcast.

1430
01:07:58,360 --> 01:07:59,240
We say, let them breathe.

1431
01:07:59,320 --> 01:08:00,740
We just open them up. Let them.

1432
01:08:00,740 --> 01:08:01,800
You get real pissed.

1433
01:08:02,280 --> 01:08:02,920
I heard that.

1434
01:08:03,420 --> 01:08:06,500
And that as a I have always opened up my toy.

1435
01:08:06,620 --> 01:08:09,580
I don't like when I get toys, I don't leave them in the packaging.

1436
01:08:09,780 --> 01:08:12,920
But like this one, I'm like, at least this one's kind of cool.

1437
01:08:13,100 --> 01:08:17,220
It's kind of like, you know, it is like a base or something. So

1438
01:08:17,220 --> 01:08:22,280
is there are there any things you are park specific that you are looking for

1439
01:08:22,280 --> 01:08:24,920
other than that many that maybe our listeners might know?

1440
01:08:24,920 --> 01:08:26,760
Like why? Because you always talk about certain things

1441
01:08:26,760 --> 01:08:28,520
like wrestling wise that you're looking for.

1442
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:31,640
But are there any other sort of like white whales

1443
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:33,760
in the theme park area that you're looking for?

1444
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:36,800
I think right now it's just that that many.

1445
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:40,060
And then, like I said, some of those ceramic figurines,

1446
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:44,460
like I'm always like I found like the the rare rabbit from Splash Mountain.

1447
01:08:45,180 --> 01:08:48,800
So I don't know if they made all the other characters or what,

1448
01:08:48,840 --> 01:08:50,240
because like eBay is very hit or miss.

1449
01:08:50,260 --> 01:08:53,320
Like it's really just what someone wants to put up that week, you know.

1450
01:08:53,700 --> 01:08:57,380
So there's no official checklist of every ceramic character.

1451
01:08:57,380 --> 01:08:59,280
All the Disney parks made. Right.

1452
01:08:59,460 --> 01:09:01,660
So that's I know of at least.

1453
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:05,000
So I'm always interested to find like some obscure

1454
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:10,240
like ceramic characters, because now like I just wanted to have like the Fab Five.

1455
01:09:10,300 --> 01:09:14,960
And my mom's she's got me so many that now I'm all in, you know. Sure.

1456
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:17,400
How many do you know about? How many you have?

1457
01:09:17,700 --> 01:09:20,480
Probably like 50. Oh, wow. Really?

1458
01:09:20,920 --> 01:09:24,040
And luckily, like they're not that expensive on eBay.

1459
01:09:24,060 --> 01:09:26,540
They're probably like, you know, the same price they were at the time,

1460
01:09:26,540 --> 01:09:28,020
you know, like less than 10 bucks each.

1461
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:29,860
Unless there's like one super duper hard one.

1462
01:09:30,280 --> 01:09:32,920
But everything that I found, I found a good price on eBay.

1463
01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:36,700
The problem is, is that they're so delicate and that you got that for that.

1464
01:09:36,820 --> 01:09:39,500
You have to make sure that they pack it carefully when they're sending it to you.

1465
01:09:39,500 --> 01:09:41,240
Right. I had a Jafar come in.

1466
01:09:41,240 --> 01:09:43,500
The whole back was cracked off and broke my heart.

1467
01:09:43,800 --> 01:09:45,400
Oh, wow. That's sad.

1468
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,860
Because like, yeah, those are who knows how many.

1469
01:09:49,280 --> 01:09:52,620
A lot of this stuff is not documented on the Internet of what exists.

1470
01:09:53,100 --> 01:09:55,660
Like, and I think we didn't talk about this earlier, but

1471
01:09:55,660 --> 01:09:59,660
well, the only thing that that I was upset about from your defunct land

1472
01:09:59,660 --> 01:10:03,260
interview was that you said you would be OK if the country bears closed forever.

1473
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:06,940
Everything else. OK.

1474
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:11,160
Well, honestly, if pirates closed, I would be upset, but I wouldn't be that upset.

1475
01:10:11,680 --> 01:10:14,600
If country bears closed, I would like pick it, I think outside.

1476
01:10:15,700 --> 01:10:18,640
Country bears, I'm with because like what's going to take its place?

1477
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:21,060
Just, you know, it's so right, right.

1478
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:22,080
You're throwing me.

1479
01:10:22,080 --> 01:10:25,300
Why can't they fix like the clicking noises?

1480
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:27,460
Mm hmm. Good question.

1481
01:10:27,480 --> 01:10:28,560
Or is that part of the charge?

1482
01:10:29,340 --> 01:10:31,060
Mike, would you be upset if there was no more clicking?

1483
01:10:31,180 --> 01:10:33,900
No. Well, you know, this will be interesting because when you finally go to Tokyo,

1484
01:10:33,900 --> 01:10:37,860
they have the country bears in Tokyo, but the animatronics are much newer

1485
01:10:37,860 --> 01:10:38,960
and cleaner looking.

1486
01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:41,000
So there's not the clicking.

1487
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:43,240
There's not there's not a rundown feeling.

1488
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:46,620
Also, the audience is happy to be there as opposed to an Orlando

1489
01:10:46,620 --> 01:10:52,600
where they seem like they're like, OK, this will get us out of the hot sun for a while.

1490
01:10:53,340 --> 01:10:57,060
But I did one of those after hours events a couple of months ago.

1491
01:10:57,060 --> 01:11:01,060
Yeah. And there's not one person in the country, which Embry,

1492
01:11:01,080 --> 01:11:04,540
the poor guy outside the podcast members like waving people in.

1493
01:11:04,720 --> 01:11:06,980
But nobody wanted to come in to see the show.

1494
01:11:07,020 --> 01:11:10,620
He was like a sign spinner, desperately trying to.

1495
01:11:10,740 --> 01:11:12,220
Yeah, I felt really bad.

1496
01:11:13,020 --> 01:11:14,240
Geez. Yeah.

1497
01:11:14,300 --> 01:11:18,620
So so like for the country bears, like, would you still collect country bear toys?

1498
01:11:18,720 --> 01:11:22,020
Like, you still like the characters, even though you find the right little rundown?

1499
01:11:22,680 --> 01:11:26,800
Yeah, like for instance, if Funko made country bear pops, I'd get him in a heartbeat.

1500
01:11:26,860 --> 01:11:28,000
OK, well, that's good.

1501
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:31,880
So you like just you want a newer, hipper country bears.

1502
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:34,120
Just updated a little bit.

1503
01:11:34,360 --> 01:11:34,880
You know what I'm saying?

1504
01:11:35,100 --> 01:11:36,160
Like, I hear you.

1505
01:11:36,160 --> 01:11:38,700
I'm not saying you have to make a whole new show, but like,

1506
01:11:38,720 --> 01:11:41,100
get rid of that clicking, like make sure everything's working properly.

1507
01:11:41,540 --> 01:11:43,200
No, I don't disagree with that.

1508
01:11:43,340 --> 01:11:45,020
Certainly. There's no not taking it out.

1509
01:11:45,020 --> 01:11:46,300
You just want to add oil.

1510
01:11:46,860 --> 01:11:48,660
Yeah, it's fixed up a little bit.

1511
01:11:48,820 --> 01:11:50,920
Yeah, no, I agree with that.

1512
01:11:51,020 --> 01:11:55,180
Wait, I have a question, which I'm confused by the difference between

1513
01:11:55,180 --> 01:11:58,880
you're into Funko, but you're not into vinylmation.

1514
01:12:00,620 --> 01:12:03,420
How what's how do you how do you explain that difference?

1515
01:12:03,420 --> 01:12:05,980
Why is why does Funko work and not found a mission for you?

1516
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:09,040
Well, like like the vinylmation, they're all like the Mickey

1517
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:11,020
Head, which I don't like, first of all.

1518
01:12:11,020 --> 01:12:12,820
And I like the Funko pop.

1519
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:16,000
No, no, no. The Funko pops with what really

1520
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:19,700
well, that when I first realized what they were, I'm a big Ghostbuster collector.

1521
01:12:19,780 --> 01:12:22,980
So I found these Ghostbuster toys, which happen to be Funko.

1522
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:24,000
Oh, these are pretty cool.

1523
01:12:24,100 --> 01:12:26,600
I mean, look up, you know, who makes these blah blah blah.

1524
01:12:26,680 --> 01:12:29,880
And I'm like, oh, this company makes Star Wars and they make Ninja Turtles.

1525
01:12:30,180 --> 01:12:31,380
And it turns out they make everything.

1526
01:12:31,420 --> 01:12:32,380
This was like five years ago.

1527
01:12:32,480 --> 01:12:36,200
Now they really make everything and everything that you like, you can collect.

1528
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:39,120
And it's all as one, you know, it's all as one line.

1529
01:12:39,180 --> 01:12:41,320
It's not like you have like the Ninja Turtle action figure

1530
01:12:41,320 --> 01:12:43,980
and your Ghostbuster was a little bit taller, a little skinnier.

1531
01:12:44,100 --> 01:12:46,020
You know, it's everything is uniform.

1532
01:12:46,120 --> 01:12:48,980
And I love that. Oh, sure. Got you. Got you.

1533
01:12:48,980 --> 01:12:50,080
Were you a fan of that?

1534
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:53,540
Did you get to do that Ghostbusters show in Orlando when you were a kid?

1535
01:12:54,060 --> 01:12:55,360
Oh, I loved it.

1536
01:12:55,520 --> 01:12:57,920
Ghostbusters is my absolute favorite movie of all time.

1537
01:12:57,940 --> 01:12:58,700
And I love that show.

1538
01:12:58,720 --> 01:13:01,100
And I still think if you watch it, the YouTube video of the show,

1539
01:13:01,300 --> 01:13:03,500
I still think it holds up.

1540
01:13:03,860 --> 01:13:07,440
Potentially better than what that's been a weird spot with Twister

1541
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:09,580
and Jimmy Fallon, like they might.

1542
01:13:09,640 --> 01:13:13,980
Oh, it might not be crazy to to say maybe they should have left

1543
01:13:13,980 --> 01:13:17,060
Ghostbusters as is or kept plus in it up.

1544
01:13:17,720 --> 01:13:18,940
Jimmy Fallon sucks.

1545
01:13:20,660 --> 01:13:23,660
Yeah. Well, as you know, our Jimmy Fallon policy.

1546
01:13:23,660 --> 01:13:24,660
Not the person. Not the person.

1547
01:13:24,660 --> 01:13:28,060
No, no, no. That's exactly our Jimmy Fallon policy is because

1548
01:13:28,060 --> 01:13:32,100
politically, as we work in the comedy world, we feel as though we should not say

1549
01:13:32,100 --> 01:13:36,880
that ride is odd and dumb and bad and relies on the same universal tricks

1550
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:38,040
that they use on every ride.

1551
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:40,120
We don't say that. Right.

1552
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:42,680
I hate it.

1553
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:45,840
I refuse to do it.

1554
01:13:46,160 --> 01:13:48,660
I have to say this.

1555
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:50,580
Yeah, you have less to lose.

1556
01:13:51,100 --> 01:13:53,660
So yes, please, please say please say it.

1557
01:13:54,260 --> 01:13:56,820
All right. So, Matt, usually to wrap up sometimes when we're doing

1558
01:13:56,820 --> 01:14:01,660
like a specific ride, we'll ask the guest what they think on a scale of

1559
01:14:01,660 --> 01:14:03,840
should we keep a ride at same as is.

1560
01:14:03,900 --> 01:14:05,920
Should we plus it up or should we burn it to the ground?

1561
01:14:05,960 --> 01:14:10,140
But since we didn't do a specific one, I was thinking we could do a lightning round

1562
01:14:10,140 --> 01:14:13,160
with Magic Kingdom rides with you.

1563
01:14:13,200 --> 01:14:15,280
Yeah. And we're going to rip through them.

1564
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:16,980
So there's three choices for all the us.

1565
01:14:16,980 --> 01:14:19,840
I'll just list the Magic Kingdom rides and you will basically just say,

1566
01:14:20,360 --> 01:14:23,860
keep as is, plus it up or burn it to the ground for insurance money.

1567
01:14:23,860 --> 01:14:25,400
And you can shorten all of those.

1568
01:14:25,460 --> 01:14:26,740
So there's three choices.

1569
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:28,680
OK, so we got the game.

1570
01:14:29,460 --> 01:14:33,000
I got it. So I'm just going to rip through all the attractions

1571
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:34,840
at Walt Disney World's Magic Kingdom.

1572
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:35,580
Astral Orbiter.

1573
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:38,480
So are you going to burn it to the ground?

1574
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:40,380
All right. Burn it to the ground. Got it.

1575
01:14:40,380 --> 01:14:43,520
The Barnstormer. Burn it to the ground.

1576
01:14:43,780 --> 01:14:46,200
Big Thunder Mountain Railroad.

1577
01:14:47,640 --> 01:14:50,360
Uh, keep it as you know what? Spice up a little bit.

1578
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:53,160
OK, plus it up. Plus it up, plus it up, plus it up.

1579
01:14:53,380 --> 01:14:54,720
But I still like it. I still like it a lot.

1580
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:58,180
I hear you. Buzz Lightyear Space Rangers spin.

1581
01:14:59,580 --> 01:15:02,060
Ah, maybe I plus it up a little bit.

1582
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:03,760
It's still cool, but I think it needs some updating.

1583
01:15:04,140 --> 01:15:04,940
OK, I agree.

1584
01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:07,440
Casey Junior Splash and Soak Station.

1585
01:15:08,500 --> 01:15:09,960
I don't even know what that is. I don't either.

1586
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:12,800
Keep moving. Pass, pass.

1587
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:15,380
Country Bear Jamboree.

1588
01:15:15,420 --> 01:15:18,780
Plus it up. OK, Dumbo, the Flying Elephant.

1589
01:15:19,060 --> 01:15:20,100
Keep it as is. OK.

1590
01:15:21,480 --> 01:15:22,940
The Hall of Presidents.

1591
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:24,600
Burn to the ground.

1592
01:15:25,680 --> 01:15:27,140
Those are fighting where people are going to come

1593
01:15:27,140 --> 01:15:30,100
after you on Twitter now. Haunted Mansion.

1594
01:15:31,340 --> 01:15:34,640
Plus it up just a little bit. OK, it's a small world.

1595
01:15:35,580 --> 01:15:37,000
Let me just let me backtrack for a second.

1596
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:38,420
OK, sure. For Haunted Mansion.

1597
01:15:39,400 --> 01:15:41,960
So like when they added all like the

1598
01:15:41,960 --> 01:15:45,180
like the animated faces on like a lot of the characters

1599
01:15:45,180 --> 01:15:47,860
and stuff like that, the tombstone, you know, I'm talking about. Yeah, yeah.

1600
01:15:48,900 --> 01:15:52,720
It's it's like so like 2000 ish bad CGI.

1601
01:15:53,320 --> 01:15:56,220
Right, you know, they need to fix it up a little bit.

1602
01:15:56,280 --> 01:15:59,080
It looks dated. A dicey time for theme parks.

1603
01:15:59,720 --> 01:16:02,720
No theme park should have done anything in the early 2000s

1604
01:16:02,720 --> 01:16:04,240
because it's all it's all bad now.

1605
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:05,740
Anything that was done in that era.

1606
01:16:06,320 --> 01:16:07,540
You know exactly what I'm talking about.

1607
01:16:07,540 --> 01:16:09,700
I'm not crazy, right? No, no, we get it.

1608
01:16:09,700 --> 01:16:13,620
It doesn't age 90s CGI is better than 2000 CGI.

1609
01:16:14,360 --> 01:16:15,700
Right, right. Yeah. OK, good.

1610
01:16:15,880 --> 01:16:17,360
OK, Jungle Cruise.

1611
01:16:19,280 --> 01:16:21,660
Oh, boy. Plus it up.

1612
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:23,600
OK, Mad Tea Party.

1613
01:16:23,880 --> 01:16:24,720
This tea cups.

1614
01:16:25,860 --> 01:16:28,680
Let's keep it. Sure. Hey, wait, Jungle Cruise, are you into

1615
01:16:28,680 --> 01:16:31,160
there's rumors of like the rock is on the ride.

1616
01:16:31,360 --> 01:16:33,300
Is that a good idea or bad idea to you?

1617
01:16:34,160 --> 01:16:37,080
I mean, I just did Jingle Cruise the other night

1618
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:40,900
and I trust me, I love like the skippers and I love like the jokes.

1619
01:16:41,080 --> 01:16:44,800
And I love like some of the stuff is just so like the animatronics

1620
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:48,340
are so old and oh, man, but I get it. It's a classic.

1621
01:16:48,440 --> 01:16:48,960
It's a classic.

1622
01:16:49,100 --> 01:16:50,740
So they're going to plus it up a little bit.

1623
01:16:50,840 --> 01:16:52,980
I'd be I'd be interested in seeing what they did.

1624
01:16:53,100 --> 01:16:56,340
So maybe some scary animatronics like they actually seem like they're

1625
01:16:56,340 --> 01:16:59,260
lunging at you or there's there's threats in the jungle.

1626
01:17:00,080 --> 01:17:01,960
Well, I mean, I did it the other it was at night.

1627
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:03,940
But like you could barely see anything in the dark.

1628
01:17:04,140 --> 01:17:06,180
I think they just need to like and better lighting.

1629
01:17:06,220 --> 01:17:07,760
Or they can fix it.

1630
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:09,560
Yeah, I don't I don't disagree with that.

1631
01:17:09,680 --> 01:17:11,120
Yeah, no, I'm on board with this.

1632
01:17:11,220 --> 01:17:12,560
All these opinions thus far.

1633
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:14,120
All right. Back to the game.

1634
01:17:14,340 --> 01:17:16,540
Many adventures of Winnie the Pooh.

1635
01:17:16,840 --> 01:17:18,120
Keep it. All right.

1636
01:17:18,120 --> 01:17:18,840
We're at the end.

1637
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:20,700
I'm going to go put on a cup of coffee.

1638
01:17:22,360 --> 01:17:23,540
No, no, there's only a few left.

1639
01:17:23,560 --> 01:17:26,140
I hope there's not a lot of Z's.

1640
01:17:26,540 --> 01:17:27,960
Mickey's PhilharMagic.

1641
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:32,360
I haven't seen it in a while, but I can only assume that it is outdated.

1642
01:17:32,840 --> 01:17:35,060
So plus it up or burn to the ground.

1643
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:37,140
I'll say I'll touch you and judge on that.

1644
01:17:37,140 --> 01:17:38,120
I'm going to say plus it up.

1645
01:17:38,120 --> 01:17:42,580
But the screen is so dim, like, come on, like brighten the screen up for that 3D.

1646
01:17:42,580 --> 01:17:44,480
It hurts the eyes if it's not that bright.

1647
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:46,880
That's me, though.

1648
01:17:47,200 --> 01:17:48,640
Monsters, Inc. Laugh floor.

1649
01:17:48,640 --> 01:17:50,500
I just did it the other night.

1650
01:17:50,760 --> 01:17:52,080
Amazing. Really?

1651
01:17:52,300 --> 01:17:53,860
What? I've never.

1652
01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:54,740
I don't know anything.

1653
01:17:54,760 --> 01:17:56,940
I've never heard like a strong opinion either way.

1654
01:17:56,940 --> 01:17:58,040
They say that this that one's bad.

1655
01:17:58,120 --> 01:17:59,280
I don't think I've done it in a long time.

1656
01:17:59,280 --> 01:18:01,640
I feel like I've done it twice in my life.

1657
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:04,760
And like I did it once and I I really, really liked it.

1658
01:18:04,760 --> 01:18:06,520
I did it again like two nights ago.

1659
01:18:07,300 --> 01:18:08,540
It's amazing.

1660
01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:10,180
So keep as is.

1661
01:18:10,760 --> 01:18:14,020
Listeners told us to like you got to reconsider Monsters Inc.

1662
01:18:14,220 --> 01:18:15,960
life. All right. We got to reconsider that.

1663
01:18:16,140 --> 01:18:16,660
Peter Pan.

1664
01:18:17,380 --> 01:18:20,800
They're like real, like real jokes and like they interact with the audience.

1665
01:18:20,920 --> 01:18:21,820
And it's great.

1666
01:18:22,060 --> 01:18:24,420
You didn't get like roasted by a monster, did you?

1667
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:25,900
No, I did not.

1668
01:18:25,940 --> 01:18:27,500
But now I know where to sit to get right.

1669
01:18:27,620 --> 01:18:30,240
I realize they're only picking people like in the middle, like.

1670
01:18:30,780 --> 01:18:32,880
So I got to I got to make a better seat.

1671
01:18:33,080 --> 01:18:34,000
Gotcha. Good tip.

1672
01:18:34,280 --> 01:18:36,220
All right, Peter Pan.

1673
01:18:36,220 --> 01:18:38,780
I keep it as a classic. Sure.

1674
01:18:38,780 --> 01:18:40,700
Pirates.

1675
01:18:40,700 --> 01:18:42,860
Oh, yeah.

1676
01:18:44,120 --> 01:18:47,140
I see. Oh, I'm not.

1677
01:18:47,420 --> 01:18:48,800
I would never say burn it down.

1678
01:18:49,240 --> 01:18:51,160
Maybe maybe plus it up a little bit.

1679
01:18:51,160 --> 01:18:52,620
OK, sure. Seven.

1680
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:54,520
Maybe you guys can help me with this.

1681
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:56,000
I don't know. There's a lot of people.

1682
01:18:56,240 --> 01:18:58,900
There was all the story of pirates is this story of pirates is that.

1683
01:18:59,280 --> 01:19:02,460
I've been on that ride probably 50 times my throughout my life.

1684
01:19:02,500 --> 01:19:04,160
I don't know what's going on.

1685
01:19:04,160 --> 01:19:05,560
What's the story here? OK.

1686
01:19:05,740 --> 01:19:08,900
So here's they've done a thing at Disneyland recently.

1687
01:19:08,920 --> 01:19:13,120
They took out the mist and that bad like projection on the mist

1688
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:14,400
to tie in with the pirates.

1689
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:16,420
And they've done a really interesting thing.

1690
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:19,700
I feel like they've put a little it's stationary,

1691
01:19:19,700 --> 01:19:23,040
but it's like a skeleton slash human like man.

1692
01:19:23,040 --> 01:19:26,080
So when you're going through the skeleton part with all the pirates

1693
01:19:26,080 --> 01:19:30,100
have their riches, you go by this like figure and it first looks like

1694
01:19:30,100 --> 01:19:30,820
it's a skeleton.

1695
01:19:31,080 --> 01:19:34,640
But as you go, like it kind of turns into a man.

1696
01:19:34,660 --> 01:19:36,620
And then you're out in the place with the ships

1697
01:19:36,620 --> 01:19:38,360
and shooting cannonballs at each other.

1698
01:19:38,660 --> 01:19:42,740
So I feel like it's trying to transition and say, hey, look at all these pirates.

1699
01:19:43,080 --> 01:19:45,360
Look what they look what they did and look what they stole.

1700
01:19:45,560 --> 01:19:49,040
And they all died just like, you know, scared or like worried

1701
01:19:49,040 --> 01:19:50,500
that their treasure was going to get taken.

1702
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:53,740
Now we'll see what they were like in the hit and like back in time.

1703
01:19:53,780 --> 01:19:55,240
This is what started all of this.

1704
01:19:55,480 --> 01:19:58,540
So it's not like a very strong story, but they're trying to like

1705
01:19:58,540 --> 01:20:01,120
paint a picture of like we're going back in time.

1706
01:20:01,120 --> 01:20:04,320
And it's much clearer now, I feel like, at Disneyland than it is at Disney World.

1707
01:20:05,800 --> 01:20:07,660
OK, then I'll have to check it out next time.

1708
01:20:07,780 --> 01:20:09,400
You want to? That covers it.

1709
01:20:10,300 --> 01:20:12,840
I mean, also, though, there's like pirates and they're hammered

1710
01:20:12,840 --> 01:20:16,080
and they're chasing women and burning a city down the city.

1711
01:20:16,240 --> 01:20:18,060
This story isn't like so strong.

1712
01:20:19,480 --> 01:20:20,840
But I don't know.

1713
01:20:21,620 --> 01:20:25,000
And then they just put Johnny Depp in there whenever they could, right?

1714
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:27,380
Well, yeah, and then I think they fucked up the story

1715
01:20:27,380 --> 01:20:29,000
probably by adding Captain Jack Sparrow,

1716
01:20:30,020 --> 01:20:31,720
because now it doesn't really make any sense.

1717
01:20:31,940 --> 01:20:34,160
Well, because that's what Disneyland, they got rid of the mist,

1718
01:20:34,200 --> 01:20:37,080
because I think they were trying to get rid of some of the movie stuff.

1719
01:20:38,760 --> 01:20:40,200
I don't know. I never saw the movie, so.

1720
01:20:40,680 --> 01:20:41,120
No. Yeah.

1721
01:20:41,260 --> 01:20:45,820
Jack Sparrow's in a bucket and then he's leaning out from behind a post.

1722
01:20:45,840 --> 01:20:48,480
And then he has all the world's treasure.

1723
01:20:48,580 --> 01:20:49,960
Very clear story.

1724
01:20:50,260 --> 01:20:53,240
It is funny that there are like all of these animatronics

1725
01:20:53,240 --> 01:20:55,180
concerned with plundering and pillaging.

1726
01:20:55,180 --> 01:20:58,780
And then there's like two next to Johnny Depp who are like,

1727
01:20:58,980 --> 01:21:01,460
I'm concerned about Captain Jack Sparrow.

1728
01:21:02,080 --> 01:21:05,020
Only some of the characters know who he is.

1729
01:21:05,380 --> 01:21:07,640
Yeah, he hasn't gotten he hasn't met everybody in town. Right.

1730
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:09,660
He's working his way around.

1731
01:21:10,160 --> 01:21:11,360
Yeah. All right.

1732
01:21:11,440 --> 01:21:13,240
Back to the game. Seven Dwarfs, Mind Train.

1733
01:21:14,500 --> 01:21:16,320
Oh, keep it as is. I love it.

1734
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:19,480
Yeah, that's good. Space Mountain.

1735
01:21:20,180 --> 01:21:23,440
Man, I wish it was

1736
01:21:23,640 --> 01:21:25,580
the Disneyland one is way better.

1737
01:21:25,640 --> 01:21:27,620
I wish it would spice up a little bit.

1738
01:21:27,700 --> 01:21:29,220
OK, plus it up. Splash Mountain.

1739
01:21:29,580 --> 01:21:30,540
Is it?

1740
01:21:30,640 --> 01:21:34,520
Maybe just clean up the animatronics a little bit.

1741
01:21:34,640 --> 01:21:35,380
So plus it up.

1742
01:21:35,860 --> 01:21:38,380
OK. Swiss Family Treehouse.

1743
01:21:39,220 --> 01:21:40,780
God, get rid of it. Burn it to the ground.

1744
01:21:41,660 --> 01:21:42,600
Tomorrowland Speedway.

1745
01:21:43,660 --> 01:21:45,720
Burn it to the ground. Oh, yeah.

1746
01:21:46,100 --> 01:21:47,720
And what a space waster.

1747
01:21:48,020 --> 01:21:49,540
Exactly. Yes. Love this.

1748
01:21:49,700 --> 01:21:51,160
I'm very curious about this one.

1749
01:21:51,420 --> 01:21:53,700
Tomorrowland Transit Authority People Mover.

1750
01:21:53,700 --> 01:21:56,340
I love it. Keep it. Oh, nice.

1751
01:21:56,340 --> 01:21:57,100
Good answer.

1752
01:21:57,420 --> 01:21:59,200
A little journey of the Little Mermaid.

1753
01:22:00,220 --> 01:22:01,320
Love it. Keep it.

1754
01:22:01,540 --> 01:22:02,460
Carousel Progress.

1755
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:04,660
Burn it. Get out of here.

1756
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
Oh, finally, you lost me. Tiki Room.

1757
01:22:08,600 --> 01:22:09,300
You know what?

1758
01:22:09,360 --> 01:22:12,360
I don't think I've done it in either park, so I don't know.

1759
01:22:12,680 --> 01:22:13,220
Oh, OK.

1760
01:22:13,660 --> 01:22:15,520
I just know it's a lot of clicking birds.

1761
01:22:15,980 --> 01:22:20,180
And then the last thing I'll ask, Liberty Square River Boat.

1762
01:22:21,540 --> 01:22:22,880
You ever got a boat?

1763
01:22:23,620 --> 01:22:25,020
I've never I've never done it.

1764
01:22:25,020 --> 01:22:27,980
So, OK, it seems silly to burn the boat.

1765
01:22:27,980 --> 01:22:30,320
That's the way it looks. Nice.

1766
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:31,480
It looks nice. Yeah.

1767
01:22:31,580 --> 01:22:32,000
Yeah. You keep it.

1768
01:22:32,020 --> 01:22:33,540
It's not it's not hurting anybody.

1769
01:22:33,800 --> 01:22:37,260
Hey, how about in advance the Tron coaster?

1770
01:22:38,040 --> 01:22:40,340
Oh, man, I don't know.

1771
01:22:40,600 --> 01:22:42,040
Oh, really? Skeptical.

1772
01:22:42,780 --> 01:22:47,100
I'm not super excited about a ride that's already somewhere else.

1773
01:22:47,100 --> 01:22:49,900
So it's already outdated about a movie I've never seen.

1774
01:22:50,060 --> 01:22:51,980
It's not popular in the United States.

1775
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:52,620
I don't know.

1776
01:22:52,620 --> 01:22:57,700
That's a film with like the the the plot is even thinner than the ride.

1777
01:22:57,700 --> 01:22:58,780
Pirates of the Caribbean.

1778
01:22:58,840 --> 01:23:01,020
I don't think you need to know the story of Tron.

1779
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:03,340
It's pretty lights. It's neon.

1780
01:23:03,340 --> 01:23:05,040
It looks cool to me. Yeah, it looks cool.

1781
01:23:05,160 --> 01:23:06,480
I think it'll be great. I think you'll dig it.

1782
01:23:06,520 --> 01:23:10,740
I think it but that train shut down for a while because of the coaster.

1783
01:23:10,860 --> 01:23:13,280
So no, no train rides for you in the near future.

1784
01:23:14,340 --> 01:23:17,340
Well, I mean, listen, the train ride is boring, first of all.

1785
01:23:18,140 --> 01:23:20,220
So what it is, you have to look at.

1786
01:23:20,660 --> 01:23:22,180
Yeah. Yeah, that's true.

1787
01:23:22,940 --> 01:23:25,120
But like this Tron, this this goes is coming in.

1788
01:23:25,180 --> 01:23:28,660
Like I said, it's going to be outdated already while Universal's

1789
01:23:28,660 --> 01:23:31,120
building this like state of the art, you know, Harry Potter coaster.

1790
01:23:31,120 --> 01:23:32,880
It's going to blow it away.

1791
01:23:32,920 --> 01:23:35,800
Hmm. I don't know.

1792
01:23:35,900 --> 01:23:38,460
We'll see. I think there's going to be more robots on the Harry Potter one.

1793
01:23:38,500 --> 01:23:41,340
So I will have an edge maybe in that area. That's better.

1794
01:23:41,380 --> 01:23:42,920
So I guess you probably are onto something there.

1795
01:23:42,920 --> 01:23:44,560
But I think you're underestimating Tron.

1796
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:46,760
Have you watched the ride through video of it, though?

1797
01:23:46,760 --> 01:23:47,400
It looks great.

1798
01:23:48,620 --> 01:23:49,620
I'm not saying it's not good.

1799
01:23:49,660 --> 01:23:53,620
I'm just saying by the time it gets here, like I think it'll be a little outdated.

1800
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:56,640
Well, we'll see. Yeah, we will.

1801
01:23:56,640 --> 01:23:59,880
I mean, even if it was in the park today, it's an old ride.

1802
01:24:00,040 --> 01:24:01,380
It's already a couple of years old.

1803
01:24:01,640 --> 01:24:03,980
Well, but maybe it's a newer version. We don't know.

1804
01:24:04,140 --> 01:24:06,800
We don't know if they've updated it for we don't know what they've.

1805
01:24:06,820 --> 01:24:10,140
Supposedly that Ratatouille ride going in Epcot is going to be like a slightly

1806
01:24:10,140 --> 01:24:13,140
newer version of the one that's in Paris. So who knows?

1807
01:24:13,280 --> 01:24:14,560
I hope so. All right.

1808
01:24:14,580 --> 01:24:19,500
We want Tron in California and we want Autopia gone.

1809
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:22,620
We want maybe submarines go whatever it takes.

1810
01:24:23,020 --> 01:24:24,360
We're like submarines got to go.

1811
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:27,740
Yeah, we are on the same page.

1812
01:24:28,200 --> 01:24:28,900
Totally agree.

1813
01:24:29,160 --> 01:24:33,400
Maybe easier for, you know, people in their 30s to say.

1814
01:24:33,860 --> 01:24:37,660
But I don't know what kids are that into the submarine or the Autopia.

1815
01:24:37,780 --> 01:24:40,600
I mean, I love Nemo, but that's it sucks.

1816
01:24:40,840 --> 01:24:42,080
That submarine thing is the worst.

1817
01:24:42,080 --> 01:24:44,040
It just takes so much time.

1818
01:24:44,620 --> 01:24:45,980
You're so crammed in there.

1819
01:24:45,980 --> 01:24:47,660
Oh, forget it. Yeah, forget it.

1820
01:24:47,660 --> 01:24:49,380
Burn it to the ground. All right.

1821
01:24:49,440 --> 01:24:56,080
Well, with that, Matt Cordona, Zach Ryder, you've survived podcast the ride.

1822
01:24:56,640 --> 01:24:58,080
Yeah, I made it.

1823
01:24:58,300 --> 01:25:01,220
Hey, what plug away your podcast.

1824
01:25:01,340 --> 01:25:02,600
Anything else you want to talk about?

1825
01:25:02,620 --> 01:25:04,940
You guys are doing a toy drive, I believe, for the holidays.

1826
01:25:05,740 --> 01:25:08,840
Oh, yeah. So we're doing a first major

1827
01:25:09,240 --> 01:25:12,200
wrestling podcast jobs every Friday, wherever you get your podcast.

1828
01:25:12,780 --> 01:25:15,000
We're doing this major recipe or toy drive.

1829
01:25:15,240 --> 01:25:18,500
It actually ends this Tuesday, December 11th.

1830
01:25:18,500 --> 01:25:20,360
But you can still order it whenever you want.

1831
01:25:20,440 --> 01:25:24,180
Any wrestling toy from ringside collectibles.com and just use the

1832
01:25:24,180 --> 01:25:28,260
I don't have the address that I need to put in here, but it's like Google it.

1833
01:25:28,260 --> 01:25:31,620
Do it on Google, the creative pro wrestling address, and they will void the shipping.

1834
01:25:31,640 --> 01:25:33,000
And that's Kurt Hawkins.

1835
01:25:33,220 --> 01:25:34,700
My partner is wrestling school.

1836
01:25:34,860 --> 01:25:36,560
And we'll just pick up the toys. We'll donate them.

1837
01:25:36,580 --> 01:25:38,480
So you don't have to go to the post office or mail.

1838
01:25:38,840 --> 01:25:42,680
Yeah. So, yeah, just just listen to the major recipe podcast on Twitter.

1839
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:45,100
At Zach Ryder, Instagram, Z Ryder, 85.

1840
01:25:45,280 --> 01:25:47,060
You'll find me, I guess.

1841
01:25:47,660 --> 01:25:48,100
You know what?

1842
01:25:48,240 --> 01:25:48,960
You'll find me.

1843
01:25:49,040 --> 01:25:49,580
Yeah.

1844
01:25:49,740 --> 01:25:54,620
If you like toys and you're constantly I feel like I was looking at your live

1845
01:25:54,620 --> 01:25:58,120
Instagram story and you were at the parade, I believe, what a couple of days ago.

1846
01:25:58,940 --> 01:25:59,560
Yes, yes.

1847
01:25:59,680 --> 01:26:02,540
So, yeah, if you like theme park content, follow this man.

1848
01:26:02,620 --> 01:26:03,920
Follow all of his accounts.

1849
01:26:04,480 --> 01:26:04,740
Yeah.

1850
01:26:04,780 --> 01:26:08,060
And I just like to say, having talked to you for a bit, I'm so

1851
01:26:08,060 --> 01:26:10,780
the fact that I don't know what you will end up doing tomorrow.

1852
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:15,720
But if, in fact, you go to a hot topic to get an Oliver and Company toy and that you

1853
01:26:15,720 --> 01:26:21,120
could potentially go to the world's largest McDonald's or that toy warehouse

1854
01:26:21,120 --> 01:26:25,340
that Jason talked about and then you could go to Disney Springs, you could go to the

1855
01:26:25,340 --> 01:26:30,720
boathouse, you could hit all the parks in a day just Ubering all the way.

1856
01:26:30,920 --> 01:26:32,940
You've made me very jealous of your life,

1857
01:26:33,040 --> 01:26:36,380
of the possible day you could wake up and have tomorrow.

1858
01:26:36,380 --> 01:26:40,360
And I just want to say Godspeed and enjoy that Orlando life.

1859
01:26:40,940 --> 01:26:42,020
Thank you very much.

1860
01:26:42,140 --> 01:26:45,920
I know you guys are the kind of guys I would love to do a park day with,

1861
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,100
because when I go, I'm always like the tour guide.

1862
01:26:48,140 --> 01:26:50,460
I'm always the guy dropping knowledge on people.

1863
01:26:50,460 --> 01:26:52,320
I would love to follow someone around,

1864
01:26:52,480 --> 01:26:54,880
follow their schedule and have someone point things out to me.

1865
01:26:55,120 --> 01:26:55,620
You know, sure.

1866
01:26:55,800 --> 01:26:57,740
Maybe one day we'll do that.

1867
01:26:57,960 --> 01:26:58,740
Yeah, that'd be great.

1868
01:26:58,940 --> 01:26:59,980
Yeah, we'll go out here.

1869
01:27:00,020 --> 01:27:02,300
Yeah, we'll go to Carthay Circle Lounge.

1870
01:27:02,460 --> 01:27:03,960
We'll do the best.

1871
01:27:03,960 --> 01:27:08,480
You got to get one of those like the rainbow shot at the Carthay Circle.

1872
01:27:08,680 --> 01:27:09,900
I have not done the shot.

1873
01:27:09,940 --> 01:27:14,040
I've done the Mickey's Funwheel drink at the Cove Bar, but that's not a shot.

1874
01:27:14,080 --> 01:27:15,900
But it is like a big rainbow drink.

1875
01:27:15,960 --> 01:27:17,380
But I think you're talking about something different.

1876
01:27:18,260 --> 01:27:22,980
It's like it's like a row of shots and it's like all different colors of the rainbow.

1877
01:27:23,200 --> 01:27:25,320
Oh, wow. I will do that.

1878
01:27:25,420 --> 01:27:26,200
This is my dream.

1879
01:27:26,220 --> 01:27:28,500
I'm the rainbow drink guy of the three of us.

1880
01:27:28,540 --> 01:27:30,500
Yeah, I don't know exactly what it's called,

1881
01:27:30,500 --> 01:27:33,260
but I've gotten it at the Carthay Circle a couple of times.

1882
01:27:33,260 --> 01:27:34,620
Yeah, OK, I got to do that.

1883
01:27:34,680 --> 01:27:39,940
Yeah, I have the transformer at the Sheridan Bar at Universal, which is multicolored.

1884
01:27:39,960 --> 01:27:41,620
So any time it's multicolored, I'm in.

1885
01:27:42,140 --> 01:27:46,760
So we will you'll come out here and we will all do multicolored shots at Carthay.

1886
01:27:46,840 --> 01:27:48,020
I love it.

1887
01:27:48,020 --> 01:27:48,980
Incredible. Great.

1888
01:27:50,140 --> 01:27:52,340
So, yeah, thank you again for doing this.

1889
01:27:52,780 --> 01:27:54,340
And I appreciate it.

1890
01:27:54,340 --> 01:27:55,000
Yeah, we'll see.

1891
01:27:55,180 --> 01:27:56,020
We'll we'll see you later.

1892
01:27:56,060 --> 01:27:57,880
We'll see you out here, I guess, in Anaheim.

1893
01:27:57,880 --> 01:27:59,880
All right. Take around the rainbow.

1894
01:28:00,940 --> 01:28:02,260
Let's do it.

1895
01:28:02,840 --> 01:28:03,860
Thanks so much.

1896
01:28:03,860 --> 01:28:04,860
Thanks. All right.

1897
01:28:04,860 --> 01:28:05,560
Thank you.

1898
01:28:05,560 --> 01:28:05,880
Right.

1899
01:28:06,140 --> 01:28:10,940
OK, and there you have it.

1900
01:28:10,940 --> 01:28:13,160
Zach Ryder, that was blessed.

1901
01:28:13,640 --> 01:28:17,920
Not as controversial really as we were like he really falls in line more.

1902
01:28:18,120 --> 01:28:21,300
He's just honestly he really all it comes down to is that it's like

1903
01:28:21,300 --> 01:28:25,660
he wants the robots to be new and fresh and he wants the park to be up

1904
01:28:25,660 --> 01:28:27,720
like a lot more upkeep in the name.

1905
01:28:27,820 --> 01:28:29,140
How can disagree with that?

1906
01:28:29,220 --> 01:28:31,620
Yeah, I mean, they do let Orlando, you know,

1907
01:28:31,700 --> 01:28:35,880
it takes a while to for stuff to change there because the majority of people

1908
01:28:35,880 --> 01:28:41,340
are going maybe every year, every other year, every 10 years.

1909
01:28:41,360 --> 01:28:43,640
So like you can let it go a little longer.

1910
01:28:43,800 --> 01:28:47,380
Just oil big, I'll snout a little more is what basically we're getting to,

1911
01:28:47,480 --> 01:28:50,420
which Jason wouldn't want big, I'll snout when I bring that up.

1912
01:28:50,540 --> 01:28:51,900
Oh, sure. No, he's big boy.

1913
01:28:52,120 --> 01:28:53,580
Do it as much as you want.

1914
01:28:53,660 --> 01:28:54,840
Oil that snout up.

1915
01:28:55,600 --> 01:28:56,720
That's weird.

1916
01:28:57,720 --> 01:28:59,480
