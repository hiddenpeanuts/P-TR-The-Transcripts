00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,000
A vast team, mateys. Beware, for today we be swashbucklin' our way through the greatest pirate-themed attraction in Southern California. Pirates' dinner adventure in Buena Park sets sail for thrills, chills, and multiple desserts. It's Podcast Ye Ride.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, the theme park podcast hosted by three men who'd rather interview the person that hits the go button on Space Mountain than an actual astronaut.

3
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
My name is Mike Carlson. Joining me as always, Scott Gairdner.

4
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Hi.

5
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
And Jason Sheridan.

6
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I have a lot of thoughts about that go button. What color it is. Likely green, but I'm happy to be surprised.

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Do you think it's green? I always picture it as red.

8
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Maybe it turns when it is hit.

9
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Oh, possibly. Yeah.

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
That's why we gotta have him on.

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
We gotta have this guy on.

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
We assume it's been one guy since the 70s?

13
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Yeah, it's like an old man in a short-sleeve dress shirt that just goes ahhh and hits it. And then we're off to space.

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
You get to start to get into a real discussion of symbol, of semiotics, use of language and symbols.

15
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Because a big red button, you know you hit the big red button to start. But red also means stop, so should it be a big green button?

16
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
These are the questions we have for this anonymous man.

17
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Yeah, well, whoever you are, please contact us on Podcast The Ride at Gmail or on our Instagram. You can DM on Instagram.

18
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:53,000
You the one man and certainly not a cycle of Anaheim college students. Right, from ages 19 to 23.

19
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:00,000
So, yeah, today's episode, we're just kind of playing a little loose. We were talking Pirates Dinner Adventure.

20
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Yeah, we all had a shared experience down in Buena Park at something called Pirates Dinner Adventure.

21
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:16,000
We thought there was enough meat on that bone to talk about. More meat than there was on the chicken bone during the meal.

22
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
At the thing. And we were there for Mike's birthday. It was a surprise.

23
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Yes, it was a surprise. I didn't know where we were. I was in the shower and my girlfriend was like,

24
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
we're going somewhere, I'm not going to tell you where it is. And I was in the shower and I was like,

25
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
well, what is some kitschy bullshit that she would take me to that I haven't been to?

26
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
And I went, oh, I wonder if we're going to go to that Pirates Dinner Adventure in Buena Park.

27
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:43,000
And sure enough, an hour later, we were on our way and you guys surprised me outside the apartment,

28
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
which very much felt like we were recording a podcast again.

29
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
There was a whole one in the car. Yeah, we did.

30
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
It is like kind of like they talk about like, you know, your Jerry Seinfeld talks about, you know, he's always working on material.

31
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
He's always just is all for the act.

32
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
And now I feel like we have a similar thing where it's like, this is going into the podcast, you know,

33
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
we're just we're doing this for the podcast. We're going to do a review.

34
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,000
So, you know, it's kind of consuming our lives much like stand up consumes the life of Jerry Seinfeld.

35
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:21,000
We got to go up. And by going up, we have to talk about parking prices more often than we used to already.

36
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Yeah. Yeah. Podcast is slowly jockeying with stand up as the most pure art form,

37
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
like the golden, you know, standard that all other art is is joined by.

38
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Oh, yeah, that's true. It's honorable. It's noble, you know.

39
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Yeah, we tell the truth. We're truth tellers. Yeah.

40
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
About the quality of the meals at the Pirates Dinner adventure.

41
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I hope one day we get to be the mentors to an Ornie Adams, an up and coming theme park podcaster.

42
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I guess it would have to be three. I like how cool would it be to get to usher in a new era,

43
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:04,000
like talk to the young guys, a new set of three theme park dorks and, you know, kind of take them under the wing and

44
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:12,000
show them the ropes of having Miranda Sings on to talk about the Bing Bong Candy Store.

45
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
The record Miranda Sings was on.

46
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Well, the reference is the comedian of the car. Yeah. You got to walk around to get to that.

47
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Yeah, that's a lot of details in that.

48
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I think I'm only aware. This is not theme park related, but I think I'm only aware of the outliers on comedians in cars.

49
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Like I haven't seen the primary episode. I haven't seen him talk to Carl Reiner or whatever it is,

50
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
but I have seen I haven't seen that.

51
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
But I've seen when he he has Michael Richards on as a character who's Mr.

52
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Crackle, which is probably cut from the Netflix versions because it's not on crack.

53
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Yeah, yeah. But yeah, he has Michael Richards play a kooky character on Crackle and Mr. Crackle.

54
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:57,000
And what about Snack? What about Snap and Pop? Famous for his solo character work Michael Richards.

55
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Well, it's kind of a throwback to many UHF fans out there.

56
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Yeah, he was good at playing those. Oh, this kind of like psychopath broad characters like that on run on Fridays or whatever.

57
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
But that and then there's one with Patton Oswalt where they drive around in a DeLorean.

58
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:21,000
And then at the end is a little treat for the audience of the DeLorean takes off into the air and does a full U-turn, does not disappear into lightning.

59
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:30,000
There's a lightning flash from the sky and then the DeLorean lifts off, turns towards us and like and the lightning bolt freezes.

60
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,000
It stays in place and is not related to the DeLorean. Watch the Patton Oswalt episode go straight to the end.

61
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,000
This is the strangest moment designed to appeal to Back to the Future fans.

62
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:48,000
But in five seconds, there's like 14 things to pick apart about how they did the effect.

63
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Wow. I do remember that. I did not have such an effect. I did not remember it. I'll tell you that.

64
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Stuck with me.

65
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:06,000
You know, I like the one where Bob Einstein is like it just talks with his voice, his funny voice.

66
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
That's the one I like.

67
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Well, that's a more pure way.

68
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:17,000
It'd be fun to see. How about a theme park crossover? It'd be fun to see a good comedian in the cars ride.

69
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
That would be great.

70
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Getting coffee at the park at the diner.

71
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Jerry, how about one of us on the Autopia with you? OK, wouldn't that be great?

72
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Oh boy, yeah.

73
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
You don't seem excited.

74
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Wouldn't that elevate your show, Jerry?

75
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Well, we couldn't all fit in one, so we'd have to choose one of us.

76
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
One of us would have to tailgate the other car behind it.

77
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,000
So it would be one in the car and then a car right close behind it constantly accidentally bumping.

78
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
And another car in front doing the filming.

79
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Yeah, of course.

80
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,000
So there'd be a little parade of Autopia cars. And the episode would only be four minutes long.

81
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I guess it would be better if he did Radiator Springs Racer because then he could talk about the car.

82
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Because a big part of comedians in cars getting coffee is he talks about the car and why he chose it.

83
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,000
So then he would be like, you know, I've chosen this old, this rusty old pickup truck.

84
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
You know, it was made in 1965 and it has a country accent.

85
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Larry the Cable Guy.

86
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Unlike most cars, it can speak.

87
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
And then you go to Flo's and have a cup of coffee and you just sit there going like,

88
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Yeah, you know what? What is Al? Disney's still not gotten the coffee. What the fuck?

89
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Well, they never disparage the coffee, do they or do they on the show?

90
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Seemingly not. I think they have no coffee taste. This is an issue I have.

91
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
He doesn't pursue like good coffee. He'll take any shitty coffee.

92
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,000
And then you have the one with Jay Leno where he reveals he's never had coffee in his life.

93
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,000
And he also reveals he's never worn sunglasses because he doesn't trust the world outside the sunglasses.

94
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
And that is a fact. He said that. That's not a joke that I made up.

95
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,000
That guy doesn't trust them with any sunglasses, you know? I want to see what the world looked like without him.

96
00:07:53,000 --> 00:08:00,000
He thinks that sunglasses obfuscate the world and he doesn't know what it's really...

97
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
That is, yeah, you're right. That's a stranger detail than any of this.

98
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Because I don't drink much coffee. You know what? I actually, here I'll tell you this.

99
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Never had a cup of coffee.

100
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
What? You haven't?

101
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I've never had a cup of coffee. That's true.

102
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Strange.

103
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I started out, first of all, this episode is going to be all about me because it's about my birthday.

104
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,000
We're going to talk a little bit about my trip. So I may as well just get into like ailments and problems I've had.

105
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
It's a birthday. What a great gift for you post your birthday to just take one over.

106
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I have a thing called mitral valve prolapse, which means there's a valve in my heart that goes the wrong way.

107
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:38,000
And while I was playing basketball in seventh or eighth grade, my heart starts racing real fast.

108
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,000
And then they diagnose me. It's not a big deal. But that happens sometimes.

109
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,000
So they're like, maybe don't drink so much caffeine. So for like 10, 15 years, I didn't have any chocolate or caffeine.

110
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:54,000
At a certain point, most medical professionals feel like this doesn't really fuck. Who gives a shit? You can do whatever you want.

111
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
So I'm like drinking a little caffeine. So I could have a cup of coffee.

112
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Uh huh.

113
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
But I really have-

114
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Let's have some coffee! Let's have some coffee!

115
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:12,000
What if they had told you, you know, just stay away from chocolate, stay away from caffeine, stay away from roller coasters, from rides, from exciting themed experiences.

116
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:19,000
That's a good point. I probably would have done it because especially when I was in seventh and eighth grade, I'd be like, oh god, I don't want to die. I'm going to die.

117
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
An excuse. An excuse to avoid the fear.

118
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Yeah, I thought I would have taken it.

119
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I thought I was going to, I thought everything was going to kill me. I was raised to think that most things were going to kill me.

120
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:39,000
As a matter of time, walking home at night would kill me. Having a Hershey bar would kill me. That's how I was raised.

121
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,000
So I would probably have stayed away for, I would probably have just gotten back on a roller coaster like a year ago.

122
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:55,000
When did you feel like you, when did this turn a corner? Did you move to Los Angeles and feel free and like you left your fraidy cat skin back in Chicago?

123
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:11,000
College probably. I remember getting to college and then just feeling like, oh, I'm a person and I can do whatever I want. Oh, it felt like a water, just like washing my face. I was cleansed.

124
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I was a free noob.

125
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I can have two shots of grog at the pirate's dinner adventure. My mom can't tell me no.

126
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:29,000
If there was a pirate's dinner adventure in Bloomington-Normal, Illinois, I would have gone every night, but there was not. But there was a grocery store called the Kroger and that was about it.

127
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
That was the closest thing to an attraction?

128
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Yeah.

129
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Were there rides outside of it? Would there be like an Elmo in a fire engine that would take you around?

130
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I don't recall. I don't think so, but they will sell you a Jake's Pizza for $2.

131
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Well, that's what the theme of Kroger is, is great value.

132
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Well, that's true. First time Jason chimed in on this part of the conversation was about a grocery store.

133
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
It's about saving money.

134
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Kroger owns Ralph's, my favorite grocery store, which Mike clowns on me.

135
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Ralph's is just such an odd choice to me. Ralph's is fine, but like, why would you, why would it be your favorite?

136
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Everybody's doing just indulgence, the non-details. You're talking about your favorite grocery store. I might as well throw in that I went to Tender Greens yesterday and I ended up getting the meal comped because there was a bug in it.

137
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Oh, this is not the first time I've heard of bugs at Tender Greens.

138
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Oh, no, really?

139
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Well, I think it's because they are actually using fresh, it was in the greens, right? So if you get really fresh greens that are organic or from a farm, like...

140
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Because they aren't full of pesticides and bad stuff that would keep the bugs up, but the flip side of that is you might end up, and it was pretty gross, I'll say that.

141
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I wanted it gone, just like the bugs from Disney's California Adventure, which we've just learned, of Bugsland.

142
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I mean, we'll have thoughts about this, I'm sure, as time goes on, but we have learned that the bugs are being exterminated at Disney's California Adventure, so bye-bye Heimlich's Choo Choo Train.

143
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,000
The bugs are off to yesterland, also known as hell. The bugs are off to hell.

144
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Yeah, along with Superstar Limo, all the classic attractions.

145
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Yester California Adventure is one of the saddest places, with the thing that preceded Bugsland, Bountiful Valley Farm.

146
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Although, maybe you might disagree, because he was an opponent of the California Adventure, but imagine if a physical place was just what's been removed from California Adventure, what a bizarre place that would be.

147
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I think I saw the end, and I remember hunting once for trying to find, like, I really want a milkshake, where is that San Andreas Shake Stand? And that went pretty quick.

148
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:06,000
You're right, Date Shakes, a California staple, I remember looking forward to that when I started going to California Adventure, and they were pretty solid. Hey, you just dug one up, that is a thing they should bring back.

149
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:18,000
But I forgot, like, I was like, well, Schmoozie's still here, and Award Wieners is still here, so that's probably still here, but no, that closed pretty quickly once they started destroying stuff.

150
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:41,000
We saw Imagineer Joe Rode in an Instagram post, he's a great Imagineer behind Avatar, and a graduate of my high school, I was reminded, went to Chaminade, like me, but he'll post photos of things from the Disney parks, and then do kind of a paragraph worth of analysis of it, and he did a long discussion of Award Wieners.

151
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:53,000
It was sort of just padding himself or other Imagineers on the back for a hell of a joke. For a hell of a, like, it was just like, I'm still, like, chuckles, I'm still amused by this after all these years.

152
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Award Wieners, you know, the phrase is actually winners.

153
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:14,000
He broke it down. Well, this is the episode, it's Jerry Seinfeld in the Cars ride with Joe Rode, breaking down the perfect joke award. Now when you think of a joke, it's kind of like me and the lost socks.

154
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Why is that funny?

155
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Why is that funny to you?

156
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Leno kind of crept into that.

157
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Yeah, a little bit. Yeah, they're all merging. I don't know, my impressions can only go sort of three general directions, and Seinfeld and Leno are in the same bucket.

158
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Yeah, I get that.

159
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Joe Rode, I don't know how to do.

160
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I don't have a good Rode either. Jason, do you have a good Rode?

161
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I don't have a Rode, no.

162
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Okay, well, we got to work on that.

163
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Letting the audience down. What else did we say we were going to talk about? Oh, Mike, you've just been, you've returned from MECHA.

164
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Yes.

165
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
You were just, we're in, for the second time, we haven't been doing this.

166
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
In six months.

167
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Yeah, we haven't been doing this podcast for that long. You've been to Disney World twice.

168
00:14:52,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Okay, all right. So let me explain why, yeah. So I went to Orlando with a couple friends. I have what's called the Premier Pass.

169
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Okay, this means that I have a pass that can get me into Disneyland and Disney World anytime I want, any of the parks, for a full year.

170
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Now, let me explain, I am a crazy person, but why I have this pass is that my girlfriend and I went to Disney World last September, I forget, August or September.

171
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:29,000
And when you add up the fact that we already have crazy Disneyland passes, when you add up the amount of money you were going to pay for just like five or six days at Disney World, you may as well just tack it on and upgrade your pass to Premier.

172
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:35,000
So that is what I did. She didn't do that, but I did.

173
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Because I was saying, well, look, if there's even a chance I'm going to go to Orlando within the next calendar year, I got to do it. And she was like, that's fine, because we're going to go to Tokyo Disney and she can't necessarily get off that many weeks from her job.

174
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:54,000
So I said, I'll probably, you know, I'll ask some friends if we want to go. So I asked you guys, you guys said no.

175
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
We said no.

176
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Yeah, you guys said no. I offered to buy a hotel room and you were like, nah, I don't think so.

177
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,000
You were going to just pay for the hotel room?

178
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Yeah, well, you're going to have to stay with me though. It wasn't like I'm going to pay for a separate room, but you could have stayed in the next bed. I told you that.

179
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Or the same bed.

180
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Could have been the same bed.

181
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
You would have given us the option, I would hope.

182
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:30,000
So I went, so you guys said no. I asked a couple other people. And then I asked some friends of mine, some people I know, my one friend who I've known since third grade and who I've been, years I've been saying, come to Disneyland.

183
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
You got to do Disneyland. And they're always like, oh, we're busy. You know, we don't know. And for whatever reason,

184
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
We do our other things in our lives.

185
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:42,000
For whatever reason, I was having coffee with him and I go, yeah, yeah, I'm trying to get somebody to go with me to Disney World. He goes, oh, we've been talking about that. Maybe we'll go.

186
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,000
And I was like, yeah, bullshit. And then it turns out they went. We went to Disney World together.

187
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:54,000
So you hadn't been able to get them to Anaheim, but you got them to Orlando on like a two and a half week notice.

188
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Yes, it was crazy. And so, yeah, it was me, my friend and his wife and who's also my friend, but it was a weird trio.

189
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
But yeah, it's you and a married couple.

190
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Me and a married couple. Not my girlfriend.

191
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Can we shout, I feel like we should shout him out because he is a thing on, Luke Clattoo.

192
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Calto.

193
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Calto.

194
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Clattoo.

195
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
He's an original member of.

196
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Wait, how did you say his last name?

197
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
He's a Lovecraft monster.

198
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
An original member of 70s space themed band, Clattoo.

199
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
His name is Luke Calto.

200
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
And he is a writer on Krypton, which is on the air right now.

201
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Sure, we'll give him a plug for everything.

202
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Okay, here, let's go through his IMDB.

203
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Krypton's going to get that sweet podcast ride, though.

204
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,000
He works on Krypton. He works on Asher for his Evil Dead, which just is coming out too.

205
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
And he also had some early work on the New Pacific Rim.

206
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Oh, interesting.

207
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
So he wasn't some idiot asshole who's not in the biz.

208
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Yeah, yeah.

209
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
He's got a car.

210
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
But I went to elementary school through high school with him.

211
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Cool.

212
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
We grew up in Schaumburg, Illinois together.

213
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
That is wonderful.

214
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Did you go with him to the Little Caesars Pizza place?

215
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
That's a good question.

216
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Any local Schaumburg attractions?

217
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Probably for birthdays.

218
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I'm sure he was there for something.

219
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Chuck E. Cheese.

220
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Chuck E. Cheese on Barrington Road.

221
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Oh, yeah.

222
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Did you go buy giant Taz shirts together at the Warner Brothers Studio Store?

223
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I don't think we bought them together.

224
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Well, we both certainly had different Taz t-shirts.

225
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Well, that's the way you knew who was cool in elementary school.

226
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Because he was the coolest.

227
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Good way to eliminate people you don't need to waste your time with.

228
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Yeah.

229
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
So anyway, so I went with them.

230
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
So we went on the plane.

231
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
We went down there.

232
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:41,000
And the trip started off a little strangely because I got up to the thing where you're supposed to give your ID and you show the ticket.

233
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
And the guy takes my driver's license and he goes,

234
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Oh, uh, your driver's license is expired.

235
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
And I went, what?

236
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
And he's like, yeah, it's expired on your birthday two days ago.

237
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
No.

238
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
And I went, oh my God.

239
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
And here's the thing that happens when you have an expired driver's license at the airport.

240
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Nothing.

241
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
They let you go through.

242
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
It doesn't matter.

243
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Oh.

244
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Because I flew on three different plane flights in the last two weeks.

245
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
And the other two times I went to the airport, they didn't even care.

246
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
They looked at it and they went, all right, here you go.

247
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Did they pat you down?

248
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Well, everybody gets patted.

249
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Everybody goes through the thing.

250
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Well, I just, my brother did that a few years ago.

251
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Like also similar thing happened where his license was expired by a week or so.

252
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,000
And they were just like, all right, we're going to send you through secondary screening.

253
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
And they just like, no secondary screening.

254
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
It didn't matter.

255
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I started sweating like I was going to get arrested because I, you know, me, I'm a good boy.

256
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I don't do things like this all the time.

257
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I'm like, oh no, I'm so sorry.

258
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I'm apologizing.

259
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I'm surprising you.

260
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I'm surprised you let that lapse.

261
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Okay.

262
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
You are a good boy, but you did just move so I could see.

263
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Yeah.

264
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
A good boy who breaks the law.

265
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
How good are you?

266
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
You missed your due.

267
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
But no, there was no letter.

268
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
And how often do you look at your license and you were reminded that.

269
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Oh, well, there should have been a letter.

270
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
The state of California dropped the letter.

271
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I did not get a letter.

272
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
So I even said to the guy, I go, oh no, what, like, what does this mean?

273
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
And he goes, well, you just got to get it renewed.

274
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
And then he's like, cause I thought like I was going to have to do what you're saying.

275
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I'm going to go through a pat down of some kind, but he's like, yeah, you just go get

276
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
it renewed.

277
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
And I was like, oh, okay.

278
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
And then he like waved me through.

279
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,000
The guy didn't like turn giant in his perspective as if you're in a kid's nightmare and then

280
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
sorry, you can't go to Disney World.

281
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
That's what I thought.

282
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
So then I was, then I was like, okay, so this isn't going to be that big of a problem.

283
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:36,000
What will become a problem though, is that being served in Orlando with an expired driver's

284
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
license is almost impossible at Disney World.

285
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:44,000
We get to Trader Sam's that first night we went to, we ate a BR guests, which is great.

286
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I had some quinoa.

287
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
We get to Trader Sam's.

288
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I'm like, you guys are going to love Trader Sam's at the Polynesian.

289
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
We get to the door, I give them my ID and she goes, oh, you're not going to get any,

290
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
you'd be able to get any drinks in here.

291
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
And I was like, huh?

292
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,000
And then they're like, yeah, this is, and then cause she's watching too.

293
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:04,000
So I go up to the bar and I'm like trying to like, I slide the license to like the bartender

294
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
and he's like, oh, this is expired.

295
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
And I'm like, what?

296
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
So it's like that's that Trader Sam's is such a small place.

297
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
It's very hard to like fool anyone.

298
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:18,000
You can't go like around the bar or you can't trade off drinks necessarily so easily because

299
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
it's such a small space.

300
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
So I'm bargaining with the bartender.

301
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I'm a 34 year old man at a Disney park begging to get like a very watered down tropical drink

302
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
at like midnight.

303
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,000
In between bursts of false volcanoes going off.

304
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Yes, indoor lightning.

305
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
And he he's like, well, do you have like a passport?

306
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:44,000
And I was like, well, I have a photo of my passport and he's like, all right, well, let's

307
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
let's see that.

308
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
So I'm like looking at my phone, trying to find this picture of my passport that I had

309
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:53,000
to send to some like commercial director or some commercial agency like five years ago

310
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
at a W9 or something.

311
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Uh huh.

312
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:00,000
And I find it and I give it to him and he goes, all right, I'll give you one drink.

313
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
And I go, oh, thank you so much.

314
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Like I was like so pathetic.

315
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Thank you so much.

316
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Did you plan ahead to and it's like, yes, I will have the bowl.

317
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I will have the bowl that's shaped like Iago, please.

318
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Uh, uh, first of all, I wish they carried a ceramic Iago there, but they don't.

319
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Uh, there's a different, uh, there's a Nautilus, which I have over on the mantle here, which

320
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,000
is a giant, uh, uh, thing here.

321
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
If we've been recording next to this the whole time.

322
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
No, that's been there since our last trip.

323
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Uh, that's a big, uh, like old submarine you can drink liquor out of.

324
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
It's exclusive to Orlando, not to our Trader Sam's out here at Disneyland.

325
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:47,000
We should Graham your, our tweet, your wall of, uh, theme parks, ceramics, and also the

326
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
book tales from Margaritaville.

327
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Jimmy Buffett novel and the one that you elevated above the other Jimmy Buffett novels.

328
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Well, I believe Tales from Margaritaville is a collection.

329
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I believe it's a collection of short stories because it's tales.

330
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
It was all his McSweeney's.

331
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
It was his McSweeney's stuff.

332
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Yeah, some, some stuff about Tully Mars.

333
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
There's some Tully Mars in there.

334
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
There's a, a group of guys known as the Breakfast Boys.

335
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:18,000
He talks about it, which are not to be confused with the Birthday Boys, the sketch group, the

336
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Birthday Boys.

337
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
These are the Breakfast Boys and they're like a gang.

338
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
They're much funnier.

339
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
They're so funny.

340
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:29,000
All right, we'll get this photo.

341
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
We'll get this.

342
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Also a picture of you and your girlfriend among all this, uh, shit.

343
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Oh yeah, yeah.

344
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Next to Sam Eagle in a colonial soldier's outfit.

345
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
The people you cherish the most.

346
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Your girlfriend, Jimmy Buffett and Sam the Eagle.

347
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Muppet, Sam the Eagle, not the many other Sam the Eagles.

348
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Every Eagle is named Sam in all of pop culture.

349
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,000
The, uh, the Olympics mascot from 1984.

350
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
I want to say there's another one and I'm not naming it.

351
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
I'm disproving my point.

352
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
There are two Sam Eagles is what I'm saying.

353
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Uh, if you know another Sam Eagle, I feel like there's another one though.

354
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Maybe I'll come up with it.

355
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Um, so basically the whole, almost the whole trip I was getting drinks bought for me by

356
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
my two friends and then snuck to me.

357
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
So as we went through the World Showcase, they'd be like, oh, do you want something

358
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
over here?

359
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Can you get me a, and then like I'll have that logger at the, at the American pavilion,

360
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
please.

361
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,400
So I was like, I was 15 or something and my older brother was buying me liquor the whole

362
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,000
trip and I'm 34 year old man.

363
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Most pathetic thing.

364
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
It's the, it's the baddest ass thing you've ever done.

365
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
I think the most flagrant rule breaking.

366
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
The fact that Disney is a stricter than the TSA.

367
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Yes.

368
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Very universal.

369
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
I think is even stricter.

370
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:52,000
I disagree with you because I get to, so I get to city walk Tuesday night to go eat a

371
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,000
margaritaville and they have an outside margaritaville, like a little booth where you can get margaritas

372
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
and I go, you know what, I'm going to try it.

373
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:04,000
And I go up there and I hand her my, my ID and she goes, oh, this is expired.

374
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:09,000
And I go, yeah, I go, but I go here, I have a picture of my passport and she's like, okay.

375
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
She's like, she's like, yeah, if you were like born, like looks like you were born in

376
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,000
like 96 I would have said no, but yeah, it's fine.

377
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
So no, they were a little lax, a little lax there.

378
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
I guess it's out here.

379
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Cause, cause we've experienced at the margaritaville in city walk Hollywood, uh, you can buy one

380
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
drink.

381
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Yeah.

382
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Well, you can't walk around like Vegas out here at the city walk out here, but you can

383
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
in Orlando.

384
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,000
In Orlando there's like fat Tuesday stalls with like liquor slush.

385
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Yeah, you can load up on liquor slush in Orlando, but not here.

386
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,000
This is all, it's kind of a sidetracky episode, but I've been wanting to address this with

387
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:50,000
you that Jimmy Buffett was just on a Fallon promoting the escape from margaritaville, the

388
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
musical.

389
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:57,000
And I'm, I've been thinking about it ever since the discussion that the, the, it indicates

390
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:02,000
what, what kind of show this is, that it's the only Broadway show in history to run out

391
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
of triple sec on its preview night.

392
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,000
We ran out of triple sec and then we got more triple sec.

393
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
We ran out of that the next night.

394
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Don't worry, we fixed it.

395
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
You come on down, you got plenty of triple sec.

396
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Jimmy was talking, so yeah, Jimmy has a show on Broadway and he's very proud of the fact

397
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
that it's like a fuck around and it's a fuck around in the audience too.

398
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,000
He's like, you know, most, most shows, they don't want you taking your phone out or yelling

399
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
stuff.

400
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
He's like, but not our show.

401
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
And it's like, this ain't Les Miserables.

402
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
This ain't Les Miserables.

403
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
We're having fun here.

404
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,000
He, so yeah, I guess if you go there, you just get fucking hammered and then you can

405
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
shout stuff out during the show.

406
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Well, and you get, uh, you are getting hammered with, um, the fine Broadway, uh, tradition

407
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,000
of like drinks, drinks you take in the theater.

408
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:57,000
They, they give you in like a travel mug, like a travel plastic travel coffee mug so

409
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,000
that you're not like spilling your frozen margarita.

410
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
We're allowing spilling.

411
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
I want to change the color of that carpet in the theater.

412
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Enjoy your margarita out of a fucking Thomas tumbler.

413
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
It's going to be piss green by the time we're done.

414
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,000
He, he was also real proud that he went up to in the hook cause wherever I forget which

415
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:21,000
theater it is, but he went up to the Marriott Marquis, which is built in to a hotel, which

416
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,000
is, and is the, uh, me and my fetishization, it's the same type of hotel as the Western

417
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Bonaventure, which I used in the design of Moonbeam city.

418
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:34,000
It's these like crazy rotating bar hotels with the, with the pod elevators.

419
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,000
I've stayed at that hotel when my family has gone to New York and that's, we stayed at

420
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
the Marriott Marquis and it's very cool.

421
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

422
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Those elevators, those like create those cavernous, bizarre indoor, uh, atriums and a revolving

423
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
restaurant at the top.

424
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
And yeah, you start, you go get drinks.

425
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,000
This is a perfect, like what better night for the two of us if we ever make it to New

426
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:00,000
York, started a revolving restaurant, stumbled down to the, which is, which Jimmy was saying,

427
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:05,000
like, you know, at my concerts we tailgate so we can tell everybody get a hotel room,

428
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
you can get drunk in your room, stumble on down to the show.

429
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:13,000
And he also was big on the fact that he had gone up and like got all the bartenders to

430
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
see the show.

431
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
He's like, I got all the bartenders to see the show.

432
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,000
So they tell the customers to go see it cause I want them to know, I don't want to mask

433
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
and as Margaritaville musical, they say, I don't know.

434
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
No, they should say it's a great old time.

435
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Got to head down, got to stumble on down there.

436
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
I want people to have a good time.

437
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
It costs $50 an hour to park in New York city.

438
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
So I want them to get their money's worth.

439
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,000
We got to go really that's a must go.

440
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
That's justifiable.

441
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Springsteen on Broadway just extended to December too.

442
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,000
And I would like to see that as well cause that would be the last, that's about $500

443
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
a ticket though.

444
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
If you can get the ticket.

445
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Really look, you see the matinee of one, you see the evening performance of the other and

446
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:56,000
you stumble out and there's a junior's cheesecake now right across from the Marriott market

447
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,000
that's open late and they serve burgers and big pastrami sandwiches and those delicious

448
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
slices of famous junior's cheesecake.

449
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Wow, what an ad.

450
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
We have now fun with the third piece.

451
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
We've now made it a perfect night for all three of us.

452
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Do you think we've all got something to look forward to?

453
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
How the cheesecake is involved.

454
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Do you think the Springsteen, does Springsteen have a specific liquor at that show?

455
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Like Jimmy has the margaritas.

456
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Like can you drink like a can of old style or what would be the Springsteen beer?

457
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
It's got like drip soil in it.

458
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,000
When you're like, you're drinking while you're working under a car.

459
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
You're slaving away.

460
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Have oil, have beer.

461
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,000
I'm trying to think, is there like an official liquor or beer of New Jersey?

462
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
I guess like, I mean, Yengling's from Pennsylvania.

463
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
You would know.

464
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Yeah, I'm trying to, I can't really.

465
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Or is there a particular alcohol name checked in a song?

466
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
I wouldn't know.

467
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Hmm.

468
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
I don't know.

469
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000
I don't think he says like a brand, like Jimmy would just throw a brand name in to make an

470
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
easy million dollars.

471
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
He's probably covered almost every type of alcohol.

472
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Yeah.

473
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
He used to, and now he just sells it himself.

474
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Now you got Margaritaville tequila, Margaritaville rum.

475
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
What's the beer called?

476
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Landshark lager.

477
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Landshark lager is pretty good.

478
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Yeah.

479
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:09,000
But Springsteen, there was never a song where he was like, and the Anheuser Busch factory

480
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
closed down.

481
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:15,000
No, there is a giant Anheuser Busch factory in like right outside of Newark.

482
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Like you could see it from the airport.

483
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Well, the Springsteen show is probably a lot less fun.

484
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Let's be honest.

485
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
He doesn't want you just yelling shit during the show.

486
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,640
If it is, it's just him.

487
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,640
What is the show?

488
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:31,000
It's him and it's his wife for a couple songs.

489
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:36,000
It's like his, it's just going through his life from kind of like his book.

490
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,480
Like he tells stories and then he plays and everybody describes it as like being a transformative

491
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,740
show to see.

492
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:42,740
Like it's incredible.

493
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:45,520
And it's a smaller, you know, you're in Mr. Theater.

494
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,520
What's the theater he's playing?

495
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:47,520
It's very small.

496
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,520
I forget.

497
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:50,480
I think it's supposed to be pretty intimate.

498
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,480
Yeah.

499
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,440
Because it's storytelling too, right?

500
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,320
Little stories and songs and stories and songs.

501
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:58,560
He does the thing where he like, yeah, I think he like strums like the C chord for a while

502
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:01,960
and he goes, I need, I need a little quiet in here.

503
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,960
Like he does during the show and then he does a couple minutes.

504
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:08,720
Well, unless it's a, unless it's a Broadway show that's a parody of all other Broadway

505
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,520
shows, I'm not interested.

506
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,920
Count me out.

507
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:16,000
Wood for Forbidden Broadway has to send up the Springsteen show and Mark Read-a-ville.

508
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,480
Yeah, they've got a lot to cover at this point.

509
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,480
Yeah.

510
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,480
Yeah.

511
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:25,080
Like what would be the Forbidden Broadway would be like, welcome to like, it's lame,

512
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:26,080
right?

513
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,080
It's like, like Drunkenville or something.

514
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,080
Would it be something like?

515
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,920
Yeah, they would just comment on, yeah, yeah.

516
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:33,600
In, in, yeah, vomit.

517
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,600
Escape to Pukeville.

518
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,600
Puke-arita-ville.

519
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,600
Yeah.

520
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:43,200
And, and all the, yeah, they'd, they'd come, they'd have ushers come out in puke stained

521
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,600
vests and what have you.

522
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,000
Oh man, they'd get him.

523
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:51,560
And Bruce, would it like be, probably their commentary would be like that he's, he's too

524
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:52,560
mumbly.

525
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:53,560
I can't hear him.

526
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:57,200
That's about the level of, yeah.

527
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,760
But you, but you did not go to New York.

528
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,240
No, no, no, no, no, no.

529
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:03,960
We have not seen, no, we're talking about hypothetical trips.

530
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:06,400
Yeah, I was in Orlando, Florida.

531
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,400
Yeah.

532
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,880
So, did you see any shows there?

533
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:15,000
I saw the Little Mermaid show at Disney, at Hollywood Studios, which has not changed since

534
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,800
I saw it when I opened in 1990 or whatever.

535
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,800
That one, the indoor and the small theater voyage.

536
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:22,000
It's 20 minutes, it's like an incredibly abridged show.

537
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
I forgot that was there.

538
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
It's very strange.

539
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
There's some cool stuff in it, but it's odd.

540
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,760
Kind of day-glo lighting and stuff.

541
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:27,760
A lot of lasers.

542
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,600
A lot of 90s lasers, which are cool.

543
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,600
Cool.

544
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:31,600
Did you see Florida's Fantasmic?

545
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,760
I didn't.

546
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:33,760
It's crazy.

547
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:36,360
It's, it's most, it's still mostly Pocahontas.

548
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,360
Wow.

549
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,800
And it's, it's so long.

550
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:40,800
I have forgotten.

551
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:44,600
Like every now, the, the last couple of times I went to Florida, I would, there's stuff

552
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:48,240
that hasn't changed since I was like in middle school and stuff.

553
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,240
And I would just forget about it.

554
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:53,720
Like Fantasmic or as we talked about, like watching the American Adventure after not

555
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:58,360
having seen it in like six or seven years and going like, oh, I forgot what this is.

556
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:59,360
Yeah.

557
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,760
We didn't see a lot of shows.

558
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:04,480
It's hard because they were, they hadn't been there in so long since we were, so we were

559
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:09,440
doing mostly the rides because the shows are long and take up a lot and it's hard to, you

560
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:12,720
know, it's hard to do everything.

561
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,040
We did, we did the big stuff we did.

562
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,240
We did, you know, Tower of Terror.

563
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,920
We did Rockin' Roller Coaster.

564
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:20,960
We're going to get to Rockin' Roller Coaster soon on this podcast.

565
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,160
Yes, true.

566
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:25,640
We may have already recorded the episode, but here's something that we, I think we left

567
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:29,040
out of the episode that I noticed that there's two things actually.

568
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:32,560
Number one, they're using a technology when you're in the line that where they have like

569
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:34,840
posters like of musicians and stuff.

570
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:39,360
And then all of a sudden it'll say like Michael at the something.

571
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,160
So I didn't know about this.

572
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,160
Yeah.

573
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:45,760
I'm in line and it said like, you know, blues singer Michael and whatever.

574
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,800
I'm looking at it and I think it's real for a second.

575
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:48,960
I'm like, who's Michael?

576
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:52,880
And I'm, and then I'm like, I'm looking at the, the magic band I have, which is, you

577
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:56,080
know, RF whatever, I would ID chip.

578
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:58,960
And I'm looking, I'm like, holy shit, they're doing this.

579
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:02,120
And then like you can see on the other side, they're like cycling people's names with different

580
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:07,000
posters and it's clear they've like figured out a technology to like make specific posters

581
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,240
for people that are in the line, which is pretty crazy.

582
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:11,240
Whoa.

583
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:15,480
That's a neat little plus up that was not there in 1999 when it opened.

584
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,480
Yes.

585
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:20,080
And we did not, that was not a plus up idea we had on the episode.

586
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,080
We dropped the ball.

587
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:24,120
And then, and then the other thing is that there's a piece of dialogue, which I don't

588
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:28,200
think we said, if we did, I will edit this out and you guys will never hear this.

589
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:31,640
Is that when you're in one of the different, there's some different dialogue that can play

590
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:34,880
while you're waiting to shoot off on the rock and roller coaster.

591
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:38,480
The one I got, which really delighted me is there's like a radio announcer who's like,

592
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,120
Aerosmith is tuning up.

593
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:42,440
Hey, check out Steven Tyler's hat.

594
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:44,960
And I was like, what?

595
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:45,960
Huh?

596
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,880
Not a man known for his hat.

597
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:48,880
No, I know.

598
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:51,520
Oh, his scarves maybe like check his scarves out.

599
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:54,080
Like people know the scarves hang off, but his hat.

600
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,080
Yeah.

601
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:59,040
Would he wear like demented Mad Hatter hats at any point?

602
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,120
You can buy those.

603
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:04,720
I think he does wear a Mad Hatter hat maybe in some video, but I'm maybe just thinking

604
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,880
of Tom Petty's don't come around here.

605
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,240
Well those countdown, those like three, two, one countdowns are kind of different.

606
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,040
They change, uh, uh, yeah.

607
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,740
There's a couple of different ones.

608
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:15,640
One Steven Tyler counts you down.

609
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:16,640
And they, they trick you.

610
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:19,440
They say three, two, and then just launch you at one.

611
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,800
They don't get to one.

612
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,000
Like I went on it.

613
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,240
I went on that three times and I love it.

614
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:27,360
I do love it.

615
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,080
It's uh, it's very fun.

616
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:31,800
Um, Tom Hamilton just had a mole removed.

617
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:34,080
He's looking good.

618
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:36,200
Enjoy your sixties, Tom.

619
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:39,480
Joey Kramer, just relay some boots.

620
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,480
Check them out.

621
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,480
Huh?

622
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,800
Um, yeah.

623
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:47,440
Uh, the fast, the fast pass thing.

624
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,840
Um, they have a thing.

625
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:50,840
This is too much.

626
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:52,960
This is too dry to really get into.

627
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,920
They have a whole different fast pass system there than they do out here, but it's very

628
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:56,920
similar.

629
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:57,920
You can make them on your phone.

630
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:02,320
So what you can do is you can like kind of surface, you go and try to find fast passes.

631
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:07,200
So I, we were in line at spaceship earth and I found a fast pass for right the moment we

632
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,920
were in line and I was like, we got to get out of the regular line and get in the fast

633
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,120
pass line.

634
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:15,640
And like I, this for me, Scott is making a face like this is just hell for him.

635
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:16,640
I love this.

636
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:21,920
This is what I'm thinking is that I know that you're a, you're a big stub hub.

637
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:22,920
Yes.

638
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:23,920
I like checking.

639
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:24,920
I like checking is what I like.

640
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,360
So this is a chance.

641
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:30,920
This is, you are now merging your love of Disney parks with your love of checking.

642
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,400
Yes.

643
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:38,480
And our friend Nick Mundy, who will eventually will do this podcast if he can make some time.

644
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,480
Maybe.

645
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:43,560
He went to Disneyland and he called me up and he's like, this fast pass thing is great.

646
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:44,560
This is great.

647
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:45,560
And I was like, Oh, were you checking all day?

648
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:46,560
He goes, yeah, I love it.

649
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:47,560
And I was like, yeah, I love it too.

650
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:49,280
I love checking too.

651
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,600
So other people like checking.

652
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:51,600
All right.

653
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,680
You're not the only, uh, the only checker out there.

654
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,320
I, it gives me such a high.

655
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,760
I found it and I was like, I'm the girl.

656
00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:02,200
Like I started yelling about how good I am and then I saw the phenomenon happen to families

657
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,200
as well.

658
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:07,200
Like a 14 year old girl in line at the rock and roller coaster was like, I am the greatest.

659
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,200
Look at the line.

660
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,200
Look at what I did for us.

661
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,200
She's like going nuts.

662
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,280
And I was like, I recognize that behavior.

663
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:16,360
She just found this fast pass like the last second and she's like rubbing it in her parents

664
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,120
face and they're like, yeah, whatever.

665
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,120
Thank you.

666
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,120
Okay.

667
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,120
Is this too much of a can of worms?

668
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:25,720
This might be too long of a thing, but you, because we went to the event desert trip at

669
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:32,320
Coachella, the thing where they have Coachella, which was referred to as old Chella, which

670
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:36,920
was a weekend with the rolling stones and Bob Dylan and Paul McCartney and Neil Young.

671
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:42,040
And uh, as your, well, I mean, I have your checking to thank for us even getting into

672
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:44,560
that at all and not like spending our life savings on it.

673
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:47,400
This is a debacle though is what you're about to describe.

674
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:52,560
We ended up through various means getting into the, the pit, uh, having the best possible

675
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:56,720
seats for the rolling stones and then you got a taste for it.

676
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:04,000
And the next night had a courier bring VIP wristbands to the Coachella grounds.

677
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,880
But it went wrong because they had mislabeled what they were.

678
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,720
So they were not enough wristbands for everyone.

679
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:13,640
But yes, I got obsessed with being in the pit and let's, let's be full disclosure.

680
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:17,720
The reason we were in the pit is because we were bad boys.

681
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:18,720
Yes.

682
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:19,720
Let's be honest.

683
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:20,720
We broke rules.

684
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:21,720
We broke rules.

685
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:28,760
I don't mean to, uh, I think I'm only like, uh, I'm 1.5% more of a bad boy than you are,

686
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:32,680
which was, uh, it's not, it's infinitesimal, but it was enough to where when the, it was

687
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:37,760
so easy, like three rounds of barricades coming down had happened and I'm like, all right,

688
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,400
I'm just gonna, I'm going to do it.

689
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,280
But you didn't quite make it in, but you ended up sneaking in.

690
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:45,400
You looked at me, you went, ah, ah, ah, and then you ran and I paused and then I was so

691
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:48,520
mad and you were in there and they put the barricade back up and then I was like, I'm

692
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:50,480
getting in this shit.

693
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:54,800
And then I scoped it out for like five, six, seven songs to try to figure out like as if

694
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,320
it was goldeneye.

695
00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:00,600
And I was like watching the guards like, okay, this is the pattern that going, I got it.

696
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:04,680
And I, and I knew the pattern and I saw my opening, I walked right through.

697
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:05,960
No one stopped me and I was fine.

698
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:06,960
It was great.

699
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:07,960
You cracked the code.

700
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:11,440
You actually like, uh, like a heist situation.

701
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:15,000
You learned when the people take their lunch breaks essentially.

702
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,280
And uh, and then I had left the pit and I made it back in as well.

703
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:24,240
I also cracked the code, but this all, this was all so, but the, the, the fact that you,

704
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:29,720
I see what you're saying because that all made it the most fun concert ever.

705
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:33,320
It was not just that it was a very good Rolling Stone show.

706
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:37,320
Like the fact that there was code cracking and checking to be done, but that you, I'm

707
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:44,080
still, the fact that you had a courier come to the busiest site in the, in the state.

708
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:46,200
I get very obsessed sometimes.

709
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,760
Mike's taking out his monocle.

710
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:48,760
Wherein.

711
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:54,360
His two Disney World trips, his current VIP courier.

712
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:58,520
Jason is basically, I've described Jason before as the, is your neighbor who takes a look

713
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:03,800
over your fence and goes, Oh, you got a new car over there, huh?

714
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:04,800
How much fun are you guys?

715
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:05,800
You know, the Henderson's.

716
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:09,680
I was doing that because you were showing us your, uh, your fast pass reservations and

717
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:10,680
stuff.

718
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:12,640
I was like, you have four boathouse reservations on here.

719
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:13,840
Well, you didn't understand.

720
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:16,840
You were being very weird because I explained to you that I made multiple reservations and

721
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:19,480
was going to cancel later because I didn't know what the schedule would be.

722
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:23,960
And you're like, well, you shouldn't be irresponsible with reservations, Michael.

723
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:28,760
And I was like, I was also concerned you were going to fuck one up and get charged.

724
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:29,760
Get charged.

725
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,400
They charge you if you don't cancel.

726
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,360
This is on the way.

727
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:38,240
I'm driving the whole group and, uh, and Erin, my wife and Lindsay, your girlfriend, down

728
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:40,720
to pirates dinner adventure.

729
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:46,360
And uh, there's this odd little bicker happening in the back seat involving like this passive

730
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,360
aggressive.

731
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:50,520
I don't, I don't want you to miss out and I don't want you to get an extra charge.

732
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:52,440
Jason, don't worry about it.

733
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:54,080
Lindsay's chiming in like, what are you talking about?

734
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:55,240
He said he's going to cancel them.

735
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:56,240
Well, I don't know.

736
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,920
And like, I was like, what do you want?

737
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,360
I canceled the reservations.

738
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:04,940
Uh, and of course, and then we did, this is also what happens to us doing this podcast

739
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:11,160
is that we talk about very dry, thin topics about ticket entries and reservations.

740
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:14,920
And then we repeat the conversation a second time.

741
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:17,520
Uh, Erin has to hear Erin listens to the podcast.

742
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:21,800
She ends up hearing all of these things twice, perhaps a third time if I'm testing material

743
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,480
on her for the podcast.

744
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:25,840
Uh, she like, boy, lucky her, huh?

745
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:28,240
She gets every podcast three times.

746
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:29,240
Poor Erin.

747
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:33,720
Um, so yeah, I had a, so I found these tickets and we were in the middle of the desert and

748
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:35,920
I was like, there's no way we don't have car.

749
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,120
Like I don't have my car here.

750
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:39,000
How am I going to get it to the festival?

751
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:43,840
And I was looking up curriers and it's like a Saturday at like six 30 and I found no notice

752
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:44,840
with no notice.

753
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:48,160
I was going through Yelp, the phone, the network wasn't working very well.

754
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:53,360
And I found a desert courier that was willing to go to this hotel, get them and then bring

755
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,360
them back.

756
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:57,540
This is like a, like a Breaking Bad fixer kind of guy.

757
00:41:57,540 --> 00:41:58,540
Like Mike Ehrman.

758
00:41:58,540 --> 00:42:00,800
Yeah, yeah, I could do it.

759
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:01,800
I could do your job.

760
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:02,800
I got your tickets, VIP tickets.

761
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,800
And I had to meet him at the side of the road.

762
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:06,800
It was dark.

763
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:07,800
It's just you guys.

764
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:08,800
Yep.

765
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:09,800
He could have killed me.

766
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:12,400
He could have done anything to me.

767
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:17,840
Instead of what other people are doing at Desert Trip, which is like getting high, playing

768
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:21,720
Cornell, going to the array of pinball machines they had.

769
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:26,200
Instead you were on your phone contacting a desert courier.

770
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:27,240
Yeah.

771
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:31,340
So that I, for whatever reason that weekend was extra like insane.

772
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:35,920
Like sometimes I can get really fixated on something like I got to find this, I got to

773
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:36,920
do it.

774
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:39,120
And that was like, that was a supercharged version of it.

775
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:45,960
Well there was this, I think between everybody there was a saved group value of like $4,000

776
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:46,960
because of all of this.

777
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,640
So I thank you for it.

778
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:53,680
We got tickets that were like $1,300 for like $250 or something, $300 or something crazy.

779
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,920
And now you can do this at the parks.

780
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,800
You can do this in sanity.

781
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:58,800
I love it.

782
00:42:58,800 --> 00:42:59,800
Yeah.

783
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:00,800
I love it.

784
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:03,800
I don't know why.

785
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:07,840
Any, any, what are the, any big highlight highlights and any big lowlights?

786
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:13,040
Oh, we've talked about this before, maybe not on the show, but for sure in real life.

787
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:17,760
The dinosaur ride at Animal Kingdom kind of a scary, always scared me when I went on it

788
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:18,760
as a kid.

789
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:19,760
It's kind of headache inducing.

790
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:20,840
There's a lot going on.

791
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:21,840
It's a lot going on.

792
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:24,840
So Luke's go, Luke, my buddy Luke goes, let's go on dinosaur.

793
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:27,240
And I was like, and then he's like, he's like, come on.

794
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:30,760
And I was like, well, and I was like, maybe I'm just scared of dinosaur.

795
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:33,200
Maybe that's, it's like some old childhood fear.

796
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:34,800
I can go on dinosaur.

797
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:38,120
It's the same track layout as Indiana Jones, which I love.

798
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:39,700
Come on, Michael, you'll be fine.

799
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:41,360
So we go on, we do the whole thing.

800
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:44,640
We go through the ride and I'm doing, I'm doing fine.

801
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:50,040
You know, I'm not scared of dinosaur or whatever, and I'm seeing it more for the first time.

802
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:51,680
Usually I have my eyes closed on it.

803
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:56,200
So I'm really seeing the ride and now I can tell, Oh, this turn is the skull room in Indiana

804
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:57,200
Jones.

805
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:59,000
So I'm really, I'm enjoying the ride more.

806
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,280
You've cracked the code of this.

807
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:03,760
So the ride gets, the ride is done and I'm like, yeah, pretty good or whatever.

808
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:05,720
I must've done really well.

809
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:09,720
I get the ride photo back and with the premiere press, I get all the photos for free.

810
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:11,700
I just want to let you know that.

811
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:17,520
So I get the ride photo from dinosaur back and I really should, should bring this up

812
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:19,720
for you right now.

813
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:23,580
I am cowering in fear.

814
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:24,580
We will post this on Instagram.

815
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:26,120
It is an intense ride.

816
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:27,120
It's very dark.

817
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:30,360
That's one of the complaints people have about it.

818
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:31,480
It's dark and loud.

819
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:32,480
I love it.

820
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:34,240
And I, even as a kid, I loved it.

821
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:39,360
And it is one where it's like the storytelling's good where they're like, you might die.

822
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:41,640
It's like, no, we got to get them out of there.

823
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:43,160
And it's like, no, the meteor is coming.

824
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:44,780
Like we're close to the dinosaur.

825
00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:46,480
We can get the dinosaur and get them out.

826
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:48,760
It's like, no, these people are going to die.

827
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:53,360
Like yeah, so if we cover this as an episode, we should keep it in that tone.

828
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:57,880
It should be screamed for a straight hour and a half.

829
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:01,600
And the pre-show with Wallace Langham I think still holds up.

830
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:02,840
So here's the fun to show you.

831
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:03,840
We'll put this on Twitter.

832
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:11,080
Uh, I everyone in the car, everyone in the car is enjoying the ride smiling.

833
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:13,400
I have my head down.

834
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:15,000
I don't remember doing this.

835
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,820
My memory of being on the ride was that I, I was a very brave man.

836
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:23,000
Three small children staring with no problem at a dinosaur.

837
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:26,200
I am wincing looking the wrong way.

838
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:27,200
It's insane.

839
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:31,480
I don't remember doing it, but apparently in a movie where the hero kid is about to

840
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:36,360
get hit by the bully and he like crunches up and then like something happens to the

841
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:38,640
bully where he doesn't end up swinging at him.

842
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:41,640
Yeah, it's, it was, I mean it's, the photo is shameful.

843
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:44,080
I will, I'll show it to you because it's funny.

844
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:45,280
Yeah, this is going right to the Twitter.

845
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:48,280
Yeah, part of the deal here is, uh, yeah, yeah.

846
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:53,560
Look, you've had your wins with your, uh, uh, you know, your, look, you're, you're a

847
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:56,400
manipulator of systems and a saver of money.

848
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:57,400
Yes.

849
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:59,920
Uh, you're also not a saver of dinosaurs apparently.

850
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:03,680
No, Icarus flying too close to the sun.

851
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:05,840
His hubris caught up with him.

852
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:08,560
You would have let the last dinosaur go extinct.

853
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:09,560
That's what it is, right?

854
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:13,480
You're trying to get a specific dinosaur and then they're shouting at you.

855
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:15,000
No, that's not it.

856
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,400
That's not it either.

857
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,280
It's like, I do not like this ride.

858
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:23,320
I will say I liked it more than I did, but it is, it is a lot.

859
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:25,480
This photo is you liking it more.

860
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:26,480
I did.

861
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:29,880
I thought I told you, I thought I took, I thought it was brave, but apparently the photo

862
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:30,880
says otherwise.

863
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:35,480
I don't know if we've talked about it on the show, but like any photo past photos of me

864
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:39,200
on rides, I have the same shitty dang grin on my face the whole time.

865
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:43,800
I'm just like, Oh, that's what it, uh, that's what I look like when I'm happy.

866
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:44,800
Huh?

867
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:47,600
And this is the only time you see this in photos.

868
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:49,160
It's me on rides.

869
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:50,160
Oh yeah.

870
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:53,080
Your pure joy, you feel looks embarrassing.

871
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:54,080
Yeah.

872
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:55,080
Right.

873
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:57,600
Um, uh, well I saw Trump.

874
00:46:57,600 --> 00:46:58,600
I mean, uh, oh yeah.

875
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:00,560
You saw the Trump Trump.

876
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:02,720
Uh, I got screaming at it.

877
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:05,800
I hope you did or you're not a true patriot.

878
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:07,800
Mr. Trump.

879
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:10,320
Excuse me, Mr. Trump.

880
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:13,660
Hey buddy, can you sit down and shut the fuck up?

881
00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:19,000
We paid $10,000 to do this fucking family reunion here.

882
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,000
There's a security.

883
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,520
I saw the security guard in there.

884
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:26,560
I ran in and was like, I was like being more like excited to see it.

885
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:29,160
I mean, not in like a horrifying way.

886
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:33,360
Um, and I had my phone out to take like, and I could tell the security guard, he switched

887
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:34,560
sides.

888
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:35,560
He saw where I was sitting.

889
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:40,160
I, this is a guess, but I think I had my phone out to try to figure out and he switched over

890
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:44,420
and all of a sudden he was like next to me and I was like, Oh man, is he gonna, does

891
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:46,360
this guy, does this kid think he's going viral?

892
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:47,760
He's got another thing coming.

893
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:50,180
He could have had his hand on his gun or something.

894
00:47:50,180 --> 00:47:52,400
Like I don't know.

895
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:57,280
We got an Antifa in a row.

896
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:58,280
I will say this.

897
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:00,120
We like hotel bars.

898
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:03,400
My favorite place now is the abracadab bar.

899
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:05,840
I don't know about the boardwalk on the boardwalk hotel.

900
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:06,840
Oh my goodness.

901
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:08,420
This is so great.

902
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:11,800
If there was an abracadab bar here, we would go every week.

903
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:12,800
It's it was fantastic.

904
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:14,640
The theme is magic, right?

905
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:16,580
Like it's tiny.

906
00:48:16,580 --> 00:48:17,580
It's great.

907
00:48:17,580 --> 00:48:19,100
It's on the, on the boardwalk.

908
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:23,300
Another good bar is the Martha's vineyard bar at yacht beach club, another tiny weird

909
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:25,680
bar in the hotel.

910
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:30,600
Loose bone fragments on the roof, but other than that, they might fall in your drink.

911
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:31,600
But yeah, yeah.

912
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:39,380
Other than that, I waited in line to meet Mickey, Minnie and Goofy alone, which is kind

913
00:48:39,380 --> 00:48:42,560
of an accident because I was trying to do stuff that I don't normally do when I was

914
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:43,560
alone at this point.

915
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:45,040
This is, well, this is a question.

916
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:50,580
Did the married couple, the couple they were on a vacation together, did they have to create

917
00:48:50,580 --> 00:48:52,120
a little space at some point?

918
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:55,280
I was very nice and I allowed them to have space.

919
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:57,360
I said, you guys can go do your own thing sometime.

920
00:48:57,360 --> 00:49:00,040
And they, that was one of the times when they were doing their own thing.

921
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:01,040
Have a free day.

922
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:02,780
Have a free day for me.

923
00:49:02,780 --> 00:49:06,680
And I was wandering around Epcot doing stuff that I, and it was like, oh, character meetup

924
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:07,680
spot or whatever.

925
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:09,980
And I was like, well, there's a fast pass for that right now.

926
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:11,720
Let me go see what that's all about.

927
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:12,720
So I get in line.

928
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:20,000
It's for three characters and I am, believe it or not, the only single man in the line

929
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,440
among a group of families.

930
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:28,600
So everyone is looking at me a little crook, like, okay.

931
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:32,680
I think there's some, like a tag got put on you at the beginning of this trip and never

932
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:33,680
stayed on.

933
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:34,680
He's here.

934
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:35,680
He's in Hall of Presidents.

935
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:37,720
He's trying to meet Minnie now.

936
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:42,640
I had the magic band on so they can track me very easily.

937
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:43,640
You were on the list.

938
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:45,440
You were on Mickey's list.

939
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:46,440
Yeah.

940
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:49,800
So I went in and I meet Mickey and Mickey wants nothing to do with me.

941
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:52,840
Mickey gets this photo op done like so fast.

942
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:56,440
We do like one or like one and a half photos and he's like onto the next thing.

943
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:58,840
Covers his face so you can't tell who he is.

944
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:01,760
Mickey did not want any part of this.

945
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:04,520
I go up to Goofy and I also, now I'm going, do I bail out?

946
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:05,640
Do I just get out of here?

947
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:06,840
Cause like, okay, I got with the Mickey.

948
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:07,840
Let me just run.

949
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:09,440
And I was like, nope, you're going to do all three.

950
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:10,440
Yeah, you're there.

951
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:11,440
You're there.

952
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:12,440
You may as well.

953
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:15,320
So, uh, Goofy wants the clown around.

954
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:18,500
And then I think I say something like as if I'm meeting a real, I go, Oh, you were my

955
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:20,840
favorite Goofy when I was a boy.

956
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:24,840
You got put on Mickey's deeper list with that.

957
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:25,840
Wow.

958
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:26,840
Goofy's like, wow.

959
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:31,320
And he gives me like a big hug and like we do some bits and then, uh, I don't remember.

960
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:33,800
You couldn't describe them.

961
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:34,840
They wouldn't be verbal.

962
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:36,240
So they wouldn't play on the podcast.

963
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:38,680
But feel free to act them out to us later.

964
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:40,200
And then I get too Minnie.

965
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:45,000
And let me just say, when you're in these costumes, you can take some liberties with

966
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,340
the guest.

967
00:50:46,340 --> 00:50:51,240
Minnie gives me an aggressive hug and I'm not like, this isn't like a brag.

968
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:54,240
I'm not trying to be like, you should have seen how Minnie hugged me or anything.

969
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:59,720
Minnie grabs me in tight and I'm like, ah, like, Oh, like if a friend of mine hugged

970
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:02,520
me like this, I would be like, Ooh, what's this about?

971
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:06,200
And then she's like doing a bit with me cause I have Mickey on my shirt and she's like pointing

972
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:08,120
at him, pointing at the Mickey over there.

973
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:10,160
And she's pointing at my shirt and I'm like, yeah, yeah.

974
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:11,480
He's a handsome man.

975
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:13,440
You're very lucky.

976
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:14,800
So she grabs my arm.

977
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:17,720
I posted this, this is already on the, uh, the Instagram.

978
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:18,720
Oh yes.

979
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:22,720
We had some, she like gets me in like on my, on like my arm, grabs me and like, we're going

980
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:26,040
to a school dance and then, and then we take photos.

981
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:29,600
Which is the only way you would have ever gone to a prom is if someone forced you.

982
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:30,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

983
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:33,360
And they were in a Minnie costume.

984
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:34,360
Yes.

985
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:36,600
That would have really helped.

986
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:42,280
Uh, and then gives me an even, even closer hug to leave.

987
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:45,560
So I get two hugs and then this has happened to me before.

988
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:50,100
Minnie leans her giant nose against me and you hear a smooch sound effect.

989
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:55,400
So the person in the costume has kissed me through the Minnie head.

990
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:56,400
Hmm.

991
00:51:56,400 --> 00:52:03,160
So you, you cuckolded Mickey Mouse while wearing a t-shirt with Mickey Mouse on it.

992
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:06,040
She was looking right at you and she didn't care.

993
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:07,040
Yes.

994
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:10,520
Uh, Mickey was too down, but yeah, he could see what was happening and he couldn't have

995
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:11,680
been pleased about it.

996
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:16,280
How rare is it for the person you're cheating with to have a shirt with your husband on

997
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:17,280
it?

998
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:18,280
That is what a dream.

999
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:20,280
What a requesting that ahead of time.

1000
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:21,280
Just happenstance.

1001
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:22,280
Why that's insane.

1002
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:23,640
Did it slow you down?

1003
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:25,000
No, didn't think so.

1004
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:32,040
Um, that's one of your Jason's fantasies on his Bumble account.

1005
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:33,040
Look them up ladies.

1006
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:37,080
You're in the area, you start pre printing photos of just people you know are married

1007
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:39,440
to have a t-shirt collection ready to go.

1008
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:40,440
Yeah, sure.

1009
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:44,080
In case I ever meet your wife.

1010
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:49,320
So what you're saying, um, I'm, I can't tell if this is positive or if you're upset, like

1011
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:52,840
the guy who got kissed by Katy Perry on American Idol.

1012
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:53,840
Oh, Oh.

1013
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:56,440
Who showed that guys can be harassed too.

1014
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:57,440
Huh?

1015
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:04,920
Because I was, I was thinking like this, I could report this if I want, if I didn't like

1016
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:11,240
it.

1017
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:16,960
I think that if there are like 12 levels of Disney list within just this podcast, you've

1018
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:18,720
ascended like six.

1019
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:19,720
Yeah.

1020
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:21,480
They will have an eye on you.

1021
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:22,480
Yes.

1022
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:26,080
They can't stop you from coming because you spend too much money, but they are just, you're

1023
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:27,840
going to be tailed every single time.

1024
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:28,840
Yeah, for sure.

1025
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:33,240
I think what, but I think the thing that you, some people were probably assuming either

1026
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:37,640
the costume characters or the handlers or stuff, they, they were actually probably thinking

1027
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:42,880
something different, which is like, Oh, this is a dad going back to the hotel to take a

1028
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:46,400
nap or like this is a dad wandering around on his own.

1029
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:50,520
And he's like, Oh yeah, why am I got a picture by myself or something?

1030
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:55,400
Let me ask you, do you think the three of us do people, if we, especially in Florida

1031
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:59,600
where it's a lot more uncommon to be, do you think they're like, Oh, these are dads.

1032
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:03,920
Cause I still don't think I look, I look like I dress too much like a 12 year old to look

1033
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:04,920
like a dad.

1034
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:06,720
That's my, that, but, but I might be delusional though.

1035
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:12,480
I think, uh, uh, older millennials who are starting to have kids do dress more casually

1036
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:17,680
than like their parents would do dress more like children.

1037
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:20,800
What I'm trying to say is, do you still think I have a going on?

1038
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:23,520
That's really what I'm asking.

1039
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:31,280
Or was this, was it, was many approaching you as a, as a single, hot to trot gentleman,

1040
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:34,320
or was she approaching you to like give, give some sugar to dad?

1041
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:36,240
She's probably having a sad trip.

1042
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:41,520
Are you concerned that you're, you're going into handsome young father territory or you're,

1043
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:43,200
you're aging into handsome young father territory?

1044
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:44,200
I don't know.

1045
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:47,520
I'm just wondering, cause I don't see myself like that even though I am, I'm old enough

1046
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:50,360
to have a 18 year old.

1047
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:51,360
Let's be honest.

1048
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:53,800
I'm not sure, I don't know.

1049
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:57,440
Should we pose, should we pose this to the audience in the most uncomfortable Twitter

1050
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:58,600
poll?

1051
00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:00,840
Does Mike have it going on?

1052
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:03,720
Still have it going on.

1053
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:05,360
If you have the answer came back, no.

1054
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:09,660
We'll pose it to Mike and I's shared agent to see if we can start get him out or more

1055
00:55:09,660 --> 00:55:11,760
young father roles.

1056
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:13,640
I'd like to get out at all, please.

1057
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:14,640
What's Mike's type?

1058
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:19,520
So, so the last thing I did on this trip was I dined the Liberty Tree Tavern.

1059
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:20,520
Do you know what this is?

1060
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:22,000
This is in Liberty Square.

1061
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,600
I was looking, I ate there last time.

1062
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:24,600
Yeah, I enjoyed it.

1063
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:25,600
Um, yeah.

1064
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:26,600
Near Trump, near the Trump robot.

1065
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:28,560
It is very near the Trump robot.

1066
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:33,840
And I had a reservation for three, but, uh, uh, the other two people in my party said,

1067
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:37,600
Hey, we'd rather go on a couple rides than go to this restaurant.

1068
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:39,800
And I said, well, I've never been to this restaurant before.

1069
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:40,800
I would like to try it.

1070
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:41,800
And they were like, that's fine.

1071
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:42,840
You can do whatever you want.

1072
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:47,360
In my mind, from childhood, this restaurant serves like sandwiches and apples.

1073
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:49,320
No, that's not correct.

1074
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:51,680
No, it's, it's a little more of a Thanksgiving dinner.

1075
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:52,680
Yes.

1076
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:54,520
They serve a lot of, of food.

1077
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:59,520
So, so basically, so what happens is, uh, I get there, we're supposed to get on a plane.

1078
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:03,200
I'm supposed to get on a plane at like six o'clock and it's about two o'clock and my

1079
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:04,680
reservations for two 15.

1080
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:09,360
So I'm thinking I get in there, I get seated in a couple of minutes, no problem.

1081
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:10,440
Everything will be fine.

1082
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:15,680
So I'm waiting in there for 30 minutes, 35 minutes for like 40 minutes.

1083
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:18,060
And my friends don't have a flight for like an hour or two after me.

1084
00:56:18,060 --> 00:56:19,680
So they're not in this time crunch.

1085
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:23,360
So I'm like, Oh God, I gotta, I gotta go, but I want to eat this meal.

1086
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:24,500
I want to have this meal.

1087
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:28,720
So I'm looking through the menu and I overhear, uh, somebody go, well, the thing to get is

1088
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:31,100
the all you can eat food.

1089
00:56:31,100 --> 00:56:33,440
And I go, well, I gotta get the all you can eat meal.

1090
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:34,440
You're alone.

1091
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:36,300
I am alone though.

1092
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:42,440
But I was like, the portions I had last time I was there and your time crunch and I'm getting

1093
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:43,440
nervous.

1094
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:44,440
I'm at, I'm in a time crunch.

1095
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:47,520
And you have a driver's license that is expensive.

1096
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:48,520
Yes.

1097
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:50,600
Which airport that is not in your state of residence.

1098
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:51,600
Right.

1099
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:53,920
So, so I'm, I'm standing and waiting there.

1100
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:56,940
And finally, uh, I am welcome to my seat.

1101
00:56:56,940 --> 00:57:03,160
And what happens is a person in a colon, like an old colonial outfit comes up and goes,

1102
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:08,040
here ye, here ye, the table is now ready for the blank party.

1103
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:12,400
So all, it's all families that are getting here ye, here ye'd and all of a sudden somebody

1104
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:16,600
comes and I have a video of it and I will post it here ye, here ye, the table is ready

1105
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:18,720
for the Carlson party.

1106
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:21,840
And I go, it's just me.

1107
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:23,600
She takes me over to the table.

1108
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:28,440
So now the crunch is on and I'm sitting down and I've ordered the all you can eat and it's

1109
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:30,940
like two 45 or something.

1110
00:57:30,940 --> 00:57:35,160
And I think that it's sort of like Ohana in the way Ohana is the restaurant, the Polynesian

1111
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:38,040
where they kind of bring stuff around and you can say yes or no.

1112
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:39,840
It is not like Ohana.

1113
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:42,840
They just bring you giant plates of food.

1114
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:43,840
Yeah.

1115
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:44,840
It's family style.

1116
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:45,840
It's family style.

1117
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:50,520
So I'm sitting there, they bring me a giant salad, just like the Disney world salad that's

1118
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:51,960
like caked in dressing.

1119
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:54,720
It's delicious, but there's no nutritional value whatsoever.

1120
00:57:54,720 --> 00:58:01,040
And they bring me four giant rolls and I'm eating this and going, Oh fuck, I have made

1121
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:02,480
a huge mistake.

1122
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:04,840
So I'm trying to get through this quickly and they're busy too.

1123
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:06,840
So they're not like so responsive.

1124
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:08,840
So it's taking a while to get the food.

1125
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:13,360
You're going to end up so fat that you don't look like you do on the driver's license.

1126
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:15,680
I don't really think you were forging it.

1127
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:17,000
So I eat like half the salad.

1128
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:20,680
I eat half of the rolls on like I push them and they're just bringing me diet cokes.

1129
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:24,480
I had like four giant diet cokes for this meal.

1130
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:26,440
So then they bring me this big plate.

1131
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:29,860
So your heart's working overtime for multiple reasons.

1132
00:58:29,860 --> 00:58:35,860
So the caffeine that I would discuss earlier, I'm just like mainlining caffeine right now.

1133
00:58:35,860 --> 00:58:43,200
So they bring me this plate of food that I can, it is, it is like three people's meal.

1134
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:44,200
This is lunch also.

1135
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:47,240
It's like roast turkey, meatloaf, hot roast, right?

1136
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:49,400
It is three different types of meat.

1137
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:50,960
Let me show it to you right now.

1138
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:56,920
It is this, there are mashed potatoes, there are green beans, there's stuffing, there's

1139
00:58:56,920 --> 00:58:59,080
turkey, there's like a big like juice.

1140
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:00,380
I don't even know what that is.

1141
00:59:00,380 --> 00:59:06,160
There is some kind like a buck, a bowl of gravy, a bowl of gravy, and then a giant macaroni

1142
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:08,420
and cheese bowl behind that.

1143
00:59:08,420 --> 00:59:16,400
So I am stressed out so bad because I have to go and you're staying off site, right?

1144
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:18,160
You're staying by Disney Springs.

1145
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:19,160
Yeah.

1146
00:59:19,160 --> 00:59:23,360
So we have to go, we have to go back to get, I mean it's sort of on the way, but we have

1147
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:27,180
to go back, get the luggage and then get to the airport.

1148
00:59:27,180 --> 00:59:32,120
So I am shoveling this food into the joylessly shoveling this food into my mouth.

1149
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:34,000
Man, you fucked up.

1150
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:37,640
And I am, there's a pain.

1151
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:43,000
You should have just eaten at like the burger place at Disney Springs that day.

1152
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,000
I know.

1153
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,720
I, so here, these are the texts I sent my girlfriend.

1154
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:51,400
So I'm like, I am insane for doing this, all this food.

1155
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:54,560
And yeah, it's, so I'm sending these photos.

1156
00:59:54,560 --> 01:00:00,320
So I'm eating and here, I hate to be gross, but I have to say this as part of the story.

1157
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:06,400
I am eating so much food in the middle of the meal, I have to go to the bathroom.

1158
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:10,460
So I have to go to the bathroom and then come back to eating.

1159
01:00:10,460 --> 01:00:15,880
And I had to like, leave my, Jason has taken his glasses off and is rubbing his face.

1160
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:19,200
It is, I am so stressed out at this point.

1161
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:22,800
And I can't finish all of it, but I'm like, I want to finish this macaroni.

1162
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:24,560
So I like finished the bowl of macaroni.

1163
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:26,000
I finished a lot of it.

1164
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:29,080
I should have taken a picture of what I did, but I'm in such a rush.

1165
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:35,880
Then they bring out, there is a giant pizookie like dessert that is last.

1166
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:40,440
There's a pizookie is like a cookie on top, like ice cream and it's heated and it's got

1167
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:43,440
these like delicious butterscotch like morsels.

1168
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:46,040
And I have a pain in the left side of my stomach.

1169
01:00:46,040 --> 01:00:47,520
There's a pain there.

1170
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:49,640
And I'm like, you can leave at any time.

1171
01:00:49,640 --> 01:00:51,280
No one is holding you.

1172
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:55,360
I paid for this thing and I want the experience that I want to be able to talk about.

1173
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:58,420
So I'm eating this and I do at that point, I have half of it.

1174
01:00:58,420 --> 01:01:00,520
And I go, you cannot eat this.

1175
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:01,620
You can't finish this.

1176
01:01:01,620 --> 01:01:03,640
You will throw up on the plane.

1177
01:01:03,640 --> 01:01:04,880
You are crazy if you do this.

1178
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:07,400
So then I just said, okay, that's it.

1179
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:08,480
I paid.

1180
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:12,400
I got up and then I just kind of limped my way out of the Magic Kingdom.

1181
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:16,420
That was my last experience in Orlando.

1182
01:01:16,420 --> 01:01:23,200
This is after the, I'm thinking about the film, The Florida Project, where all of the

1183
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:27,360
impoverished people live just outside the gates and their ultimate fantasy would be

1184
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:32,240
to go in just for a few minutes and hear you, I'm eating too much food.

1185
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:35,400
I got too much mac and cheese and pie.

1186
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:36,400
It's crazy.

1187
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:37,400
It's shameful.

1188
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:40,440
Here on my second Disney World trip in six months.

1189
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:44,160
The way I live is shameful.

1190
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:48,300
This is funny because a few years ago when I went, like I had the total opposite experience

1191
01:01:48,300 --> 01:01:50,960
where it's just like, oh, we've got a little bit of time.

1192
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:53,900
We were staying at the Bay Lake Tower at the contemporary.

1193
01:01:53,900 --> 01:01:57,800
So it's like, oh, we took them on a rail to Magic Kingdom and just did a couple of things

1194
01:01:57,800 --> 01:02:03,000
and then had a nice leisurely meal at the Wave in the contemporary and had the whole

1195
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:07,540
place to ourselves and checked out right there and oh, what a pleasant last day before we

1196
01:02:07,540 --> 01:02:08,540
had to get on the plane.

1197
01:02:08,540 --> 01:02:09,540
That's not how I roll, man.

1198
01:02:09,540 --> 01:02:10,540
It's the polar opposite.

1199
01:02:10,540 --> 01:02:14,040
You're on the other side of the proper heat.

1200
01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:16,280
I have to fit in as much fun.

1201
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:19,260
I have to cram as much fun into my mouth as possible.

1202
01:02:19,260 --> 01:02:21,840
I was eating like I was trying to win a contest.

1203
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:22,840
It was crazy.

1204
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:23,840
Yeah.

1205
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:25,880
Fortune favors the bold, Michael.

1206
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:26,880
Yeah.

1207
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:31,400
So as the French foreign legions say, I'll say this, though.

1208
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:32,400
The food was very good.

1209
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:33,400
Yeah, really good.

1210
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:34,400
It was nice.

1211
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:35,400
It was good.

1212
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:36,400
Delicious.

1213
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:37,920
It was like a nice Thanksgiving meal.

1214
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:42,620
The last thing I'll say about the trip is that and Scott, you may want to turn this

1215
01:02:42,620 --> 01:02:43,880
down and give it to Jason.

1216
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:50,560
I've brought you guys free gifts, single disposable towels from Disney's Contemporary Resort.

1217
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:53,720
You want to give the other one to Jason, feel free.

1218
01:02:53,720 --> 01:02:54,720
Why would I do that?

1219
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:55,720
All right.

1220
01:02:55,720 --> 01:02:57,120
This one is a little crinkled.

1221
01:02:57,120 --> 01:02:58,120
I'm sorry.

1222
01:02:58,120 --> 01:02:59,120
It's great.

1223
01:02:59,120 --> 01:03:00,120
Oh, boy.

1224
01:03:00,120 --> 01:03:01,120
I stayed there.

1225
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:02,120
Feel free to.

1226
01:03:02,120 --> 01:03:03,120
I went in and I went in the gift shop and I was like, hey, do you have anything with

1227
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:05,200
this with the contemporary logo on it?

1228
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:06,200
They went, no.

1229
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:09,840
Yeah, they don't have a lot of postcard or hotel merch.

1230
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:12,880
Maybe one contemporary logo, which is just handwriting.

1231
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:13,880
It says contemporary.

1232
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:14,880
Yeah.

1233
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:17,000
You just had to have this somewhere.

1234
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:21,640
There's a different variant of it, too, that has like a little monorail on it and stuff.

1235
01:03:21,640 --> 01:03:26,800
But the hotels in Florida are kind of crap shoots for hotel specific merch.

1236
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:27,800
Yeah.

1237
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:28,800
Yeah, true.

1238
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:30,500
I was like looking, oh, should I get them souvenirs?

1239
01:03:30,500 --> 01:03:31,760
But this is a whole other discussion.

1240
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:35,480
But everything's the same as Disneyland.

1241
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:37,960
It's all the same crap that we can buy at Disneyland.

1242
01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:41,800
So it's not like when I was looking through souvenirs, like, oh, what could I get people?

1243
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:43,200
It's all the same stuff that's in Anaheim.

1244
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:44,200
So I'm like, well.

1245
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:45,200
Well, you did.

1246
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:48,920
You sent me a picture of a shirt from the boathouse that said, Doc Boy on it.

1247
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:49,920
That's true.

1248
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:52,160
I sent you the shirt that said Doc Boy.

1249
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:54,640
I almost told you, like, get me a medium.

1250
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:56,200
Well, I'll then vote you.

1251
01:03:56,200 --> 01:03:57,760
Like, I kind of went with Doc Boy.

1252
01:03:57,760 --> 01:04:00,340
Well, on the Orlando trip, I take in three months.

1253
01:04:00,340 --> 01:04:02,600
I will get you the Doc Boy shirt.

1254
01:04:02,600 --> 01:04:03,600
Oh, boy.

1255
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:04,600
Yeah.

1256
01:04:04,600 --> 01:04:09,480
So this episode, I feel, has been like your meal with many courses.

1257
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:10,480
Yes.

1258
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:18,240
Trying to cram as much in as humanly, a disgusting amount of stories and content and topics.

1259
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:21,400
The listener now wants to throw up.

1260
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:27,720
I cannot have, I cannot listen to this part about the Pirates Dinner Adventure.

1261
01:04:27,720 --> 01:04:29,720
And you can't, you can stop.

1262
01:04:29,720 --> 01:04:32,520
Or if you want to get your full all you can eat value.

1263
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:35,280
Or you can go to the bathroom right now and come back.

1264
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:36,280
Yeah, yeah.

1265
01:04:36,280 --> 01:04:40,160
Take a break, because now we head down to Buena Park.

1266
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:42,060
Let's board this galleon.

1267
01:04:42,060 --> 01:04:43,920
Let's come aboard, Mayday.

1268
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:48,960
To talk about a different thing that we all went to that was where food, where shrimp

1269
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:50,960
skewers are being.

1270
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:51,960
Are we the enemy?

1271
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:54,040
Are we the bad, are we bad guys?

1272
01:04:54,040 --> 01:04:56,040
Are we, uh, Oh, are we food?

1273
01:04:56,040 --> 01:04:57,040
Yeah.

1274
01:04:57,040 --> 01:04:58,040
Oh, yeah.

1275
01:04:58,040 --> 01:04:59,040
Yeah.

1276
01:04:59,040 --> 01:05:00,040
Spending money.

1277
01:05:00,040 --> 01:05:01,040
Is this a privileged podcast?

1278
01:05:01,040 --> 01:05:02,040
Is this what we're proving?

1279
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:03,040
Yeah, for sure.

1280
01:05:03,040 --> 01:05:08,240
Is someone using this in like a college class to show how there's too much media from people

1281
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:12,360
who have unrelatable experiences to ramble about?

1282
01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:18,080
I mean, I thought the Pirates adventure was like pretty reasonable for what it is price

1283
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:19,080
wise.

1284
01:05:19,080 --> 01:05:20,160
There's not a lot indulgent there.

1285
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:23,400
It wasn't like, you know, the upper crust at this event.

1286
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:25,880
It was regular folk going out for a night now.

1287
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:27,880
And this is a great, I think this is a great place.

1288
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:32,080
If you were part of like a little league team or a boy scout troop or something.

1289
01:05:32,080 --> 01:05:33,080
Yeah.

1290
01:05:33,080 --> 01:05:37,560
Imagine the, you would treasure your night, you would treasure your night at Pirates Dinner

1291
01:05:37,560 --> 01:05:39,440
Adventure forever.

1292
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:45,960
So the Pirates Dinner Adventure, as we started to say, this was a birthday surprise for you.

1293
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:47,880
None of us had been, but we've passed by it.

1294
01:05:47,880 --> 01:05:51,120
It's very near Knott's Berry Farm.

1295
01:05:51,120 --> 01:05:55,960
It is also very near Medieval Times and Medieval Times is probably kind of a...

1296
01:05:55,960 --> 01:05:56,960
Comparable.

1297
01:05:56,960 --> 01:05:57,960
Yes.

1298
01:05:57,960 --> 01:06:02,120
And probably a precursor to this where there's a big show and a multi-course meal that comes

1299
01:06:02,120 --> 01:06:07,700
out while you eat the show, while you eat the show, while you watch the show.

1300
01:06:07,700 --> 01:06:13,040
So and it also, I'd like to say, I've talked about it before, but the area, this Buena

1301
01:06:13,040 --> 01:06:19,280
Park attraction zone, Beach Boulevard, is like, it's very Florida.

1302
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:24,120
It's like the most Florida thing in California.

1303
01:06:24,120 --> 01:06:28,880
In that it's, I Drive is the area in Florida where there's all these crazy attractions

1304
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:31,960
and buildings that look like a bunch of cartoon shit.

1305
01:06:31,960 --> 01:06:37,080
This area in Buena Park, this small, this little mile of road, has Knott's Berry Farm,

1306
01:06:37,080 --> 01:06:42,400
Medieval Times, Pirate's Dinner Adventure, Farrell's, which is an old-timey ice cream

1307
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:47,000
parlor, which we took a special trip to to see a bear that is important to Aaron and

1308
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:48,000
I.

1309
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,000
I know what that bear is.

1310
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:53,440
Yeah, which is mainly seen, Truffles the bear, who is mainly seen at the Rocky Mountain Chocolate

1311
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:57,920
Factory, if you go to that in your local mall, there's a big sad bear outside of it.

1312
01:06:57,920 --> 01:06:58,920
There's one in Glendale.

1313
01:06:58,920 --> 01:06:59,920
Yes, yeah, yeah.

1314
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:02,040
Oh, but there's not a Farrell's, is it?

1315
01:07:02,040 --> 01:07:04,120
I've always wanted to go to Farrell's.

1316
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:07,040
It shows up in pop culture, I feel like, as like a reference.

1317
01:07:07,040 --> 01:07:12,040
Yes, Farrell's was a, I think, a chain that my parents liked a lot.

1318
01:07:12,040 --> 01:07:16,160
There was like an old-timey, it felt like the 20s, and it's the kind of thing, I think

1319
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:20,560
the Simpsons has made fun of it in various guises, where like there's a sparkler in your

1320
01:07:20,560 --> 01:07:26,720
ice cream and everybody's wearing those like ragtime kind of bands around your arm and

1321
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:32,080
like an alarm goes off if somebody gets the giant sundae or whatever.

1322
01:07:32,080 --> 01:07:36,480
Farrell's is though a brand, it went away and it got brought back on the show The Prophet.

1323
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:37,480
Yes, I love The Prophet.

1324
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:40,880
I was going to say, I think one of them was on The Prophet.

1325
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:45,720
Oh boy, check it out on your CNBC app or Hulu or whatever.

1326
01:07:45,720 --> 01:07:48,480
Also, Marcus The Prophet, I love Marcus.

1327
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:50,480
Oh, me too, we haven't talked about The Prophet.

1328
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:52,480
I can't believe we didn't, oh man.

1329
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:53,480
Oh, The Prophet.

1330
01:07:53,480 --> 01:07:54,480
Oh, we're starting a profit cast.

1331
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:56,480
Yes, I would.

1332
01:07:56,480 --> 01:07:59,480
Every episode, checking in on how the business is doing, building to a Marcus appearance.

1333
01:07:59,480 --> 01:08:02,640
It's like a much less aggressive bar rescue.

1334
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:07,240
With a little bit of, it's like the interesting business acumen you pick up from Shark Tank,

1335
01:08:07,240 --> 01:08:10,440
but more like you see it out in the street in the moment.

1336
01:08:10,440 --> 01:08:15,080
Well Farrell's, they did a follow-up episode, checking in on the business, which had fallen

1337
01:08:15,080 --> 01:08:16,080
into disarray.

1338
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:17,080
Oh no, I'm nervous.

1339
01:08:17,080 --> 01:08:21,840
And weirdly, one of the owners of Farrell's, for some reason walking around with a broken

1340
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:23,320
arm that's never referenced.

1341
01:08:23,320 --> 01:08:28,760
Like the character Martha on Baskets is just like an extra element to make her extra sad,

1342
01:08:28,760 --> 01:08:30,240
never explain broken arm.

1343
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:32,760
But anyway, the business is in disarray.

1344
01:08:32,760 --> 01:08:36,160
And Marcus takes that personally because Marcus always wanted to have a candy store growing

1345
01:08:36,160 --> 01:08:37,160
up.

1346
01:08:37,160 --> 01:08:40,840
There's a couple candy store ones and you can see the joy in his eyes when he's like,

1347
01:08:40,840 --> 01:08:44,000
I own part of a candy store and he's eating candy.

1348
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:50,000
He clearly has kind of a fetish for the bag that you fill up with the, as you do Mike,

1349
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,360
which I had never done.

1350
01:08:51,360 --> 01:08:57,160
I went to Farrell's not long after and did the scooping up the candy into the bag.

1351
01:08:57,160 --> 01:08:58,160
I had a great time.

1352
01:08:58,160 --> 01:08:59,160
It's great margins on that.

1353
01:08:59,160 --> 01:09:00,880
Ah, good point.

1354
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:08,280
Well, they turned it, he combined one of his candy store properties, Sweet Pete's with

1355
01:09:08,280 --> 01:09:09,280
Farrell's.

1356
01:09:09,280 --> 01:09:13,360
So the Buena Park Farrell's is now Farrell's presented by Sweet Pete's.

1357
01:09:13,360 --> 01:09:14,520
Oh, I think I have seen that.

1358
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:16,160
So we had to go check in on it.

1359
01:09:16,160 --> 01:09:20,740
And also the bear who is typically seen in another candy store, but now he's in this

1360
01:09:20,740 --> 01:09:21,740
candy store.

1361
01:09:21,740 --> 01:09:27,000
We saw the bear, truffles the bear, most indulgent episode we've ever done.

1362
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:34,320
So anyways, this is just, but again, we got our last guest, Steve Anderson to go to this,

1363
01:09:34,320 --> 01:09:35,320
just go to Beach Boulevard.

1364
01:09:35,320 --> 01:09:36,320
You're going to have a blast.

1365
01:09:36,320 --> 01:09:39,960
There's also, I'll also think of, there's Rock and Brew's, the Kiss restaurant.

1366
01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:45,220
There's a McDonald's that inexplicably says McThriller because it used to have a flight

1367
01:09:45,220 --> 01:09:49,040
simulator in it, but no longer does, but still says McThriller.

1368
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:53,080
And they don't have this anymore, but I was reading about Buena Park history and they

1369
01:09:53,080 --> 01:09:58,980
used to have an alligator farm where the big attraction show was making a bunch of alligators

1370
01:09:58,980 --> 01:10:00,480
go down a slide.

1371
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:01,760
Whoa, wow.

1372
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:03,960
Pushing gators into a pool.

1373
01:10:03,960 --> 01:10:06,000
They did not want to do that, I bet.

1374
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:07,920
No, gators are so listless.

1375
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:11,360
They don't want to do anything except like attack something once in a while.

1376
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:13,960
This is not a good climate for gators.

1377
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:18,200
No, yeah, just the middle of just weird, dry Orange County.

1378
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:20,820
Yeah, Disneyland's never opened a zoo.

1379
01:10:20,820 --> 01:10:26,000
This isn't like, yeah, this has not been terribly popularized, thank God, in Orange County.

1380
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:31,200
So anyway, this area is insane and one of the big pieces of the insanity is Pirates

1381
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:36,400
Dinner Adventure, which we learned Justin Donaldson who was with us said he went there

1382
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:38,360
when it was a, was it a Western show?

1383
01:10:38,360 --> 01:10:41,040
Yeah, it was a Western cowboy dinner show.

1384
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:46,600
After the Pirates movies were popular, they decided to re-theme and seize on the popularity

1385
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:47,600
of Pirates.

1386
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:52,040
Yes, which had all said previously happened in Orlando because there's another location

1387
01:10:52,040 --> 01:10:57,400
of this in Orlando on iDrive, the insane attraction zone in Orlando.

1388
01:10:57,400 --> 01:11:01,480
As it tells you on the placemats at this restaurant, Buena Park and Orlando.

1389
01:11:01,480 --> 01:11:02,480
Oh yeah, okay.

1390
01:11:02,480 --> 01:11:03,480
It has the phone numbers for both.

1391
01:11:03,480 --> 01:11:06,240
It says, well the website says choose your port.

1392
01:11:06,240 --> 01:11:10,260
And that's which is the only choice I ever want to have in my life is am I going to Buena

1393
01:11:10,260 --> 01:11:11,640
Park or Orlando?

1394
01:11:11,640 --> 01:11:15,280
But before we get too far, because I think, you know, I imagine we might like, I had a

1395
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:16,280
good time at this thing.

1396
01:11:16,280 --> 01:11:19,960
I might rip on a couple components of it, but before we get too far, do you guys know,

1397
01:11:19,960 --> 01:11:24,800
did you catch that the Orlando one is struggling in the wake of Hurricane Irma?

1398
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:26,040
I was not aware of this.

1399
01:11:26,040 --> 01:11:27,040
Oh, it's roof, right?

1400
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:28,040
Yeah.

1401
01:11:28,040 --> 01:11:29,040
Like it's roof got damaged.

1402
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:34,200
The roof got tore off, not in the fun way that music artists want to happen in a concert,

1403
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:35,960
but in a literal way.

1404
01:11:35,960 --> 01:11:38,020
And it's, yeah, it's a bummer.

1405
01:11:38,020 --> 01:11:43,540
And I, so I feel bad, I'd like to apologize to the Orlando Pirates Dinner Adventure.

1406
01:11:43,540 --> 01:11:47,200
And apparently like nothing else in that zone really got damaged, but this was a weird custom

1407
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:52,600
roof that they built, a dome, and they should be up and running again sometime in 2018.

1408
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:56,760
I don't, hopefully they didn't have to like let a lot of people go, but that's a bummer.

1409
01:11:56,760 --> 01:12:01,200
Hope you, hope it gets back into, back into safe shape.

1410
01:12:01,200 --> 01:12:06,960
But anyway, that one's been there since probably early 2000s and then they moved it out here

1411
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:11,040
to Buena Park and then we went.

1412
01:12:11,040 --> 01:12:12,600
In 2018.

1413
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:14,880
Yeah, it took us, took us a while.

1414
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:17,960
I don't know, how do we, what do we cover?

1415
01:12:17,960 --> 01:12:19,840
It's, okay, I'll say this about the show.

1416
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:21,480
There's a lot going on.

1417
01:12:21,480 --> 01:12:22,480
Yeah.

1418
01:12:22,480 --> 01:12:25,200
There's a lot of, like there's a big set, the set is cool.

1419
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:31,640
As soon as we walked in the door, a man came up to us with a tray and said, fried pickles?

1420
01:12:31,640 --> 01:12:32,640
Would you like some fried pickles?

1421
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:33,640
Yeah, that's true.

1422
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:34,960
There's a whole pre-show, we should say that.

1423
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:36,680
There's a whole, there's a bar outside.

1424
01:12:36,680 --> 01:12:41,160
You can get like these just obnoxiously sweet drinks with rum in them.

1425
01:12:41,160 --> 01:12:42,540
And there's wandering app.

1426
01:12:42,540 --> 01:12:44,040
We got there pretty close to the end.

1427
01:12:44,040 --> 01:12:46,080
Did you just call it wandering app?

1428
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:47,080
Wandering app people.

1429
01:12:47,080 --> 01:12:49,920
Yeah, there are waiters wandering around giving out apps.

1430
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:51,640
Is that a term though?

1431
01:12:51,640 --> 01:12:55,440
I just, I thought it was the most efficient way to describe what was happening.

1432
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:56,440
No, you're right.

1433
01:12:56,440 --> 01:12:59,360
I just, you said it with the confidence of a restaurant industry insider.

1434
01:12:59,360 --> 01:13:00,360
Oh no.

1435
01:13:00,360 --> 01:13:04,800
Yeah, and you didn't put any like comedy, like a comedy stank on it.

1436
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:08,820
I don't know what, I mean, it's funny because they're mostly, they have to come through

1437
01:13:08,820 --> 01:13:09,820
the gift shop.

1438
01:13:09,820 --> 01:13:14,200
So like you could be looking at pirate necklaces and someone's like, do you want a mini meatball

1439
01:13:14,200 --> 01:13:15,200
sandwich?

1440
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:16,200
Yeah.

1441
01:13:16,200 --> 01:13:22,520
I'm going to post, we'll post a photo of us outside of the, that Aaron took, that's us

1442
01:13:22,520 --> 01:13:26,080
outside of the sign that explains the party packages that are available.

1443
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:29,080
Do you know offhand the package that Lindsay arranged?

1444
01:13:29,080 --> 01:13:32,280
She did a great job booking this event, I will say.

1445
01:13:32,280 --> 01:13:34,640
I can't remember what the name of the package was.

1446
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:37,040
The one that came with chocolate cake, I remember that.

1447
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:38,040
Ah, yes.

1448
01:13:38,040 --> 01:13:42,960
You got, you got the jolly pirate, which includes a slice of chocolate cake, pirate flag, bandana,

1449
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:46,760
and bearded, beaded necklace, bearded necklace.

1450
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:47,840
That sounds fun.

1451
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:52,480
There's also the, I can't read there, lots of boot.

1452
01:13:52,480 --> 01:13:56,080
It's too piratey, this font, privateer, full bounty.

1453
01:13:56,080 --> 01:14:00,320
I hope if I have to take a vision test, they don't do it, the letters in a pirate font.

1454
01:14:00,320 --> 01:14:05,080
But anyway, we did get chocolate cake as part of it, which was left in my car, as you might

1455
01:14:05,080 --> 01:14:06,640
know if you follow us on Twitter.

1456
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:07,640
I'm getting upset.

1457
01:14:07,640 --> 01:14:08,640
I don't want to talk about that.

1458
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:11,040
Jason, I'm sorry, I threw the cake away.

1459
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:13,040
You're out of your mind.

1460
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:15,040
They tricked leaving a cake out.

1461
01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:16,040
Here's the problem.

1462
01:14:16,040 --> 01:14:19,120
I would have killed, you must not be sweet tooth people.

1463
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:22,960
Well, I didn't want to, it was, it would have been sitting in the car for 12 hours.

1464
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:26,360
He doesn't give a shit about a cake in the car for 12 hours.

1465
01:14:26,360 --> 01:14:28,360
That thing could have been there for a week.

1466
01:14:28,360 --> 01:14:31,840
It's been like in the fifties, in the low fifties at night.

1467
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:32,840
It's just cake.

1468
01:14:32,840 --> 01:14:34,120
That's an acceptable cake temperature.

1469
01:14:34,120 --> 01:14:35,360
You're probably right.

1470
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:39,440
But also, I've been, your car was out of service, I've been driving you around a bunch anyway.

1471
01:14:39,440 --> 01:14:41,440
I would have had to deliver you the cake.

1472
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:42,440
Oh, you're right.

1473
01:14:42,440 --> 01:14:43,440
Yeah.

1474
01:14:43,440 --> 01:14:46,160
I would have had to make a trip to bring a cake to your house.

1475
01:14:46,160 --> 01:14:47,160
That is true.

1476
01:14:47,160 --> 01:14:48,600
He would be fine requesting that of you.

1477
01:14:48,600 --> 01:14:50,000
He doesn't care.

1478
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:55,680
If you'd paid me the like $7 that a Postmates guy would, I would have been your personal

1479
01:14:55,680 --> 01:14:56,880
Postmates person.

1480
01:14:56,880 --> 01:14:59,480
That's out of the question, I think.

1481
01:14:59,480 --> 01:15:04,120
The cake, they sort of trick you with the cake because they, she was like, Lindsay said

1482
01:15:04,120 --> 01:15:05,720
like they were like, well, do you want the cake as well?

1483
01:15:05,720 --> 01:15:07,100
And then she was like, oh yeah, yeah.

1484
01:15:07,100 --> 01:15:09,160
But they didn't tell her that it comes with dessert.

1485
01:15:09,160 --> 01:15:10,160
It comes with tres leches.

1486
01:15:10,160 --> 01:15:12,480
So we ended up getting two cakes.

1487
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:14,320
So she would not have gotten that cake.

1488
01:15:14,320 --> 01:15:15,320
Nothing wrong with that.

1489
01:15:15,320 --> 01:15:16,800
Which I thought was delightful.

1490
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:21,340
She was, it was an old pirate trick to get her to get two cakes for all of us.

1491
01:15:21,340 --> 01:15:22,340
We got her!

1492
01:15:22,340 --> 01:15:23,340
Arrrr!

1493
01:15:23,340 --> 01:15:24,920
Well, you made $15.

1494
01:15:24,920 --> 01:15:30,120
Because yeah, it was my birthday and they do a whole thing there.

1495
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:33,580
When I say a whole thing about the birthday, it means they just read from a list of people

1496
01:15:33,580 --> 01:15:36,320
in the audience whose birthday it is.

1497
01:15:36,320 --> 01:15:40,620
And it's Mrs. Robertson's seventh grade class here.

1498
01:15:40,620 --> 01:15:42,760
Good job on geometry exams.

1499
01:15:42,760 --> 01:15:44,960
Yeah, there was a lot of that.

1500
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:50,520
There was like, his way to Park High School here and the whole section, like cheers.

1501
01:15:50,520 --> 01:15:53,360
They go fucking nuts.

1502
01:15:53,360 --> 01:15:56,080
It's Kayden's birthday, you lay a love person.

1503
01:15:56,080 --> 01:15:57,080
Kayden?

1504
01:15:57,080 --> 01:16:01,040
Kayden and Jayden, the twins.

1505
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:05,080
So, so you're getting a great meal.

1506
01:16:05,080 --> 01:16:07,240
You're getting wandering apps right when you walk in.

1507
01:16:07,240 --> 01:16:08,800
Crudité.

1508
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:11,440
You can go get a shot of grog, which you guys did.

1509
01:16:11,440 --> 01:16:14,120
We ordered an entire bottle of wine.

1510
01:16:14,120 --> 01:16:15,120
Oh yeah.

1511
01:16:15,120 --> 01:16:19,420
Which was necessary to get through it, I believed.

1512
01:16:19,420 --> 01:16:20,760
But it made it fun.

1513
01:16:20,760 --> 01:16:27,960
The wine which was delivered to us at our eventual table in the lagoon.

1514
01:16:27,960 --> 01:16:35,480
And then, so you're, the little show starts that explains the story, which involves Captain

1515
01:16:35,480 --> 01:16:40,520
Sebastian the Black, who has been deposed.

1516
01:16:40,520 --> 01:16:44,040
Isn't there something like they think he's gone, but then he shows up in the show?

1517
01:16:44,040 --> 01:16:46,040
There's a lot of buildup to Captain Sebastian the Black.

1518
01:16:46,040 --> 01:16:47,040
Yeah, they think he's gone.

1519
01:16:47,040 --> 01:16:51,960
I'll be honest with you, my memory of the plot is not, it's a little fuzzy.

1520
01:16:51,960 --> 01:16:53,840
Yeah, I was hoping-

1521
01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:59,200
There's a princess that was going to get married to another prince who is like a fat old guy.

1522
01:16:59,200 --> 01:17:04,120
They seem to allude that her, who she's been arranged to marry is a fat old guy and then

1523
01:17:04,120 --> 01:17:06,200
pirates come and interrupt the show.

1524
01:17:06,200 --> 01:17:07,200
Yes.

1525
01:17:07,200 --> 01:17:13,880
And simultaneously there is like someone has brought a jewel for her as a gift and they

1526
01:17:13,880 --> 01:17:16,200
say this a lot.

1527
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:19,040
She is a quote, gypsy girl.

1528
01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:21,300
And boy, they say gypsy a lot.

1529
01:17:21,300 --> 01:17:24,000
A word that is on its way out, a word that-

1530
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:27,280
But isn't she literally a gypsy though?

1531
01:17:27,280 --> 01:17:32,000
Yeah, but I don't think you're supposed to be, I don't know that you're supposed to be

1532
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,440
tossing around that casually.

1533
01:17:34,440 --> 01:17:40,720
Also was more just kind of like a brave heart, was more kind of like just a zena girl, I

1534
01:17:40,720 --> 01:17:42,000
guess was a better description.

1535
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,200
Okay, so you took it as a slur.

1536
01:17:44,200 --> 01:17:48,480
There's a couple old, there's a couple things in the show that might be a bit problematic

1537
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:49,480
at this point.

1538
01:17:49,480 --> 01:17:54,760
Let me read this line relating to the flippancy regarding gypsies.

1539
01:17:54,760 --> 01:18:00,240
At some point, I was taking scattered notes during the show and among them my notes were,

1540
01:18:00,240 --> 01:18:02,640
hey, gypsy, are you a campfire?

1541
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:05,680
Because you're really hot and I want some more.

1542
01:18:05,680 --> 01:18:06,680
Some more.

1543
01:18:06,680 --> 01:18:10,080
So I guess he must have said some more.

1544
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:15,080
So that's not the most respectful thing to say, but it's a fair question.

1545
01:18:15,080 --> 01:18:21,920
And this continues the trend of women not faring super well in the stunt shows.

1546
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:25,380
Although the women in the show did get to do a lot of fun stuff.

1547
01:18:25,380 --> 01:18:27,580
They got to do some business.

1548
01:18:27,580 --> 01:18:33,800
Our pirate in particular sort of harassed the woman until she would finally go out with

1549
01:18:33,800 --> 01:18:34,800
him.

1550
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:35,800
Did you notice that?

1551
01:18:35,800 --> 01:18:38,860
His woman was like an aerial contortionist.

1552
01:18:38,860 --> 01:18:43,640
But early on she didn't want to be with him and he kept grabbing her by the wrist and

1553
01:18:43,640 --> 01:18:48,200
then she would float back in and then she'd push him away.

1554
01:18:48,200 --> 01:18:49,840
And you're like, come on, green pirate.

1555
01:18:49,840 --> 01:18:51,600
Come on, take a hint.

1556
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:54,200
But then they started doing the Cirque du Soleil shit.

1557
01:18:54,200 --> 01:18:58,200
Right, but that's like the old movie where you force a kiss on her and then she would

1558
01:18:58,200 --> 01:19:03,920
hit you for a while and then she'd go, wait a minute, I like this.

1559
01:19:03,920 --> 01:19:07,160
Well this is a current event issue.

1560
01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:12,160
We probably don't have time to get into it, but the pirate auction has just been changed.

1561
01:19:12,160 --> 01:19:17,680
It's a new world and we're trying to revise pirate history.

1562
01:19:17,680 --> 01:19:19,720
But you know, it was what it was.

1563
01:19:19,720 --> 01:19:25,040
Look, these shows have never portrayed literally what it was, which is too graphic.

1564
01:19:25,040 --> 01:19:28,160
I don't know, this is a problem that all pirates...

1565
01:19:28,160 --> 01:19:35,040
Yeah, look, women were not doing well in pirate times or even pirate stories written a long

1566
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:39,080
time ago.

1567
01:19:39,080 --> 01:19:47,280
Our pirate and the acrobat girl got really hot and heavy at the end.

1568
01:19:47,280 --> 01:19:48,600
Yeah, there is a scene.

1569
01:19:48,600 --> 01:19:53,240
So we're jumping around here, but there are so many different types of things going on

1570
01:19:53,240 --> 01:19:54,320
in the show.

1571
01:19:54,320 --> 01:19:57,560
There are fights, there are contests that are true contests.

1572
01:19:57,560 --> 01:20:03,040
Like you're having an audience member throw bean bags up at a pirate above us in the seating

1573
01:20:03,040 --> 01:20:07,920
area and then he has to swing over and put it in a bucket and whoever does that first

1574
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:09,760
wins some sort of pirate contest.

1575
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:13,040
There's a number of pirate contests.

1576
01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:17,160
Some of them are more predetermined than others.

1577
01:20:17,160 --> 01:20:23,720
There are, I'll say this, there's a lot of trampoline going on.

1578
01:20:23,720 --> 01:20:26,800
There's double dutch on the trampoline.

1579
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:31,040
There are songs, there are...

1580
01:20:31,040 --> 01:20:34,480
Like toasts, they teach you how to swing your grog back and forth.

1581
01:20:34,480 --> 01:20:36,000
There's a lot of swinging your cups.

1582
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,120
All the cups are plastic.

1583
01:20:38,120 --> 01:20:40,280
And then like beautiful, I don't even know what to call it.

1584
01:20:40,280 --> 01:20:41,280
What do you call it?

1585
01:20:41,280 --> 01:20:45,520
Like the gymnast stuff where there's like a long piece of cloth and they're like unraveling

1586
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:47,680
themselves from the ceiling.

1587
01:20:47,680 --> 01:20:48,680
That happens.

1588
01:20:48,680 --> 01:20:49,680
What's the actual term for that?

1589
01:20:49,680 --> 01:20:50,680
I don't know the name of it.

1590
01:20:50,680 --> 01:20:53,160
I wrote ribbon dancer, but that's not right.

1591
01:20:53,160 --> 01:20:56,880
Yeah, that Cirque du Soleil sort of like they're wrapping themselves in it and they're being

1592
01:20:56,880 --> 01:20:59,560
lifted up and then they spin all the way down.

1593
01:20:59,560 --> 01:21:00,560
Sensual gymnastry.

1594
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:02,740
It is so sensual.

1595
01:21:02,740 --> 01:21:09,120
Our pirate and this woman had this co-dance and they were unraveling themselves from the

1596
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:10,120
ceiling.

1597
01:21:10,120 --> 01:21:11,560
They clearly are a package.

1598
01:21:11,560 --> 01:21:13,280
They clearly are a duo.

1599
01:21:13,280 --> 01:21:14,640
And it's an erotic.

1600
01:21:14,640 --> 01:21:15,640
It's very erotic.

1601
01:21:15,640 --> 01:21:21,840
Well, they also, I should say that this is the night to this is the like, most of the

1602
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:26,280
time this is the show that the Pirates Dinner Adventure Venue is doing, but they also do

1603
01:21:26,280 --> 01:21:35,100
a show called Teatro Martini, which is for adults that is all body kind of, and I think

1604
01:21:35,100 --> 01:21:38,560
also involves zip lines and sensual.

1605
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:41,720
But is that in the main theater?

1606
01:21:41,720 --> 01:21:45,280
I thought that that looked like it was just like a cabaret in the pre-show.

1607
01:21:45,280 --> 01:21:46,280
I think you're right.

1608
01:21:46,280 --> 01:21:51,480
I think they take over the pre-show is enough room to do a show in and of itself to do a

1609
01:21:51,480 --> 01:21:55,640
burlesque bleacher madhouse kind of.

1610
01:21:55,640 --> 01:22:04,060
Because that in the pre-show, the gypsy girl does a full like there is a trapeze like sort

1611
01:22:04,060 --> 01:22:08,040
of bar that she's like swinging on directly above you.

1612
01:22:08,040 --> 01:22:10,960
Like there's a zip line over you too in that area.

1613
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:11,960
That's part's pretty exciting.

1614
01:22:11,960 --> 01:22:12,960
I may have run into the restroom.

1615
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:13,960
Wait a minute.

1616
01:22:13,960 --> 01:22:14,960
I may have been in the restroom.

1617
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:15,960
No, no.

1618
01:22:15,960 --> 01:22:16,960
You were standing right with us.

1619
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:17,960
What was the zip line?

1620
01:22:17,960 --> 01:22:18,960
Somebody goes right over you.

1621
01:22:18,960 --> 01:22:22,160
Jason, two pirates came over our head in zip line.

1622
01:22:22,160 --> 01:22:24,960
You, Lindsay and I were under them.

1623
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:26,040
I don't remember this.

1624
01:22:26,040 --> 01:22:29,120
So I was, I was sweating it out.

1625
01:22:29,120 --> 01:22:30,440
He's about to reveal.

1626
01:22:30,440 --> 01:22:31,440
Wait.

1627
01:22:31,440 --> 01:22:32,440
So I was a little stoned.

1628
01:22:32,440 --> 01:22:38,280
I didn't have any crazy drinks, but I was a little stoned and on the car ride down,

1629
01:22:38,280 --> 01:22:39,280
it was fine.

1630
01:22:39,280 --> 01:22:43,920
And then once the pirates started coming out and the wandering app people, I was like,

1631
01:22:43,920 --> 01:22:45,680
Oh God, there's a lot going on.

1632
01:22:45,680 --> 01:22:48,640
Wait, the apps were what broke you?

1633
01:22:48,640 --> 01:22:50,240
Well, also the time crunch.

1634
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:51,760
Cause like the app time was ending.

1635
01:22:51,760 --> 01:22:52,840
Like we called the tail.

1636
01:22:52,840 --> 01:22:54,120
I could have eaten more apps.

1637
01:22:54,120 --> 01:22:55,120
I'll say that.

1638
01:22:55,120 --> 01:23:01,160
This is the second nightmare revolving around consuming food quickly and getting your value.

1639
01:23:01,160 --> 01:23:06,440
But then also, also I was like, Oh no, how much participation is there in this?

1640
01:23:06,440 --> 01:23:10,920
Like uh, which was the answer ended up being a lot, but a reasonable amount.

1641
01:23:10,920 --> 01:23:14,560
But you were worried that we're going to make you get on stage and recite things.

1642
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:15,560
Yeah.

1643
01:23:15,560 --> 01:23:16,560
Uh huh.

1644
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:20,480
We're sending this video to your parents.

1645
01:23:20,480 --> 01:23:21,480
Don't be weird.

1646
01:23:21,480 --> 01:23:22,480
Don't be weird.

1647
01:23:22,480 --> 01:23:28,200
I do recall you saying this, this is too much and stepping away pretty briefly.

1648
01:23:28,200 --> 01:23:29,400
That's crazy though.

1649
01:23:29,400 --> 01:23:33,320
Two giant pirates over your head on a zip line.

1650
01:23:33,320 --> 01:23:34,320
I guess it's gone.

1651
01:23:34,320 --> 01:23:35,840
It's like a traumatic thing.

1652
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:37,760
You're blocking it out.

1653
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:41,960
You walked to the, I do remember you walking back to hang out with Scott, but yeah, we

1654
01:23:41,960 --> 01:23:45,040
were, we were chilling in the back.

1655
01:23:45,040 --> 01:23:48,480
You were by a fully stocked bar that it was not open.

1656
01:23:48,480 --> 01:23:50,160
You were by, it was a weekday.

1657
01:23:50,160 --> 01:23:53,960
Oh, which there was a sign that I was looking at photos from this later and the sign said

1658
01:23:53,960 --> 01:23:59,960
like the like, if we were closed, go to the other bar.

1659
01:23:59,960 --> 01:24:04,800
Like it just made, I literally was staring at it like, what is, oh, they meet.

1660
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:05,800
Yeah.

1661
01:24:05,800 --> 01:24:08,440
It doesn't, it works out loud, but not in print.

1662
01:24:08,440 --> 01:24:12,280
But like there, there's some, there are a little more fast at like you are eating that

1663
01:24:12,280 --> 01:24:17,640
you're eating vegetable soup and a pirate is swinging eight feet above you.

1664
01:24:17,640 --> 01:24:21,360
And bean bags are being thrown that might splash into your suit.

1665
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:22,480
Yeah, it is.

1666
01:24:22,480 --> 01:24:24,800
That's the show brings you into the action.

1667
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:25,920
That's what I'll say.

1668
01:24:25,920 --> 01:24:30,280
Medieval times, they have like a, a tent, a scroll, like a, a, like a screen in front

1669
01:24:30,280 --> 01:24:31,280
of the audience now.

1670
01:24:31,280 --> 01:24:32,680
So like no hockey game.

1671
01:24:32,680 --> 01:24:33,680
Yeah.

1672
01:24:33,680 --> 01:24:34,680
It's like a hockey game.

1673
01:24:34,680 --> 01:24:37,640
So you don't get like an ax that like flies.

1674
01:24:37,640 --> 01:24:39,360
This does not, this does not.

1675
01:24:39,360 --> 01:24:44,200
And I had, I have recently seen the medieval time show a couple of months ago for, there

1676
01:24:44,200 --> 01:24:47,680
was a group for the dough boys podcast and I was, they were lucky.

1677
01:24:47,680 --> 01:24:49,680
I was lucky enough to be invited along to that.

1678
01:24:49,680 --> 01:24:50,680
Oh boy.

1679
01:24:50,680 --> 01:24:52,600
So I can compare these two dinner shows.

1680
01:24:52,600 --> 01:24:55,160
Uh, medieval times, a lot more boring than the show.

1681
01:24:55,160 --> 01:24:56,640
The show has got a lot going on.

1682
01:24:56,640 --> 01:24:58,240
Oh, good for pirates.

1683
01:24:58,240 --> 01:25:02,440
Medieval times has like, uh, you know, there's some like, they do a lot of filler before

1684
01:25:02,440 --> 01:25:03,680
the actual fighting.

1685
01:25:03,680 --> 01:25:07,720
There's like a bird ceremony and they got a bird that flies all around and you're like,

1686
01:25:07,720 --> 01:25:08,720
okay, who cares?

1687
01:25:08,720 --> 01:25:13,200
And then there's, they have a lot of pageantry and if you'd like horses, that's nice, but

1688
01:25:13,200 --> 01:25:16,840
we didn't really get going with the show until they take the axes out and start swinging

1689
01:25:16,840 --> 01:25:17,840
them.

1690
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:18,840
This got you into it so quick.

1691
01:25:18,840 --> 01:25:23,040
They're like asking, like they're getting, once they get everyone in there, like as you're

1692
01:25:23,040 --> 01:25:26,360
getting people in the room, they're like, all right, and so uh, do you drinks, you want

1693
01:25:26,360 --> 01:25:27,440
soda?

1694
01:25:27,440 --> 01:25:31,000
And the like show is going on and they're like soup, super salad, super salad.

1695
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:32,480
Yeah, they're getting in and out.

1696
01:25:32,480 --> 01:25:36,680
Uh, by the way, what waggers probably like, I like the bird ceremony.

1697
01:25:36,680 --> 01:25:38,960
I wish they didn't fight.

1698
01:25:38,960 --> 01:25:40,960
The worst was the fighting.

1699
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:43,600
It was my jazz stick.

1700
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:48,200
I just wanted to pick soups for, uh, he listens.

1701
01:25:48,200 --> 01:25:49,680
So he will hear that.

1702
01:25:49,680 --> 01:25:50,680
Hey, sorry.

1703
01:25:50,680 --> 01:25:51,680
We love you.

1704
01:25:51,680 --> 01:25:52,680
Uh, yeah.

1705
01:25:52,680 --> 01:25:55,240
Uh, so there, there's a lot going on.

1706
01:25:55,240 --> 01:25:58,880
I might argue a little too much going on because it's confusing.

1707
01:25:58,880 --> 01:26:00,280
There's a medieval times.

1708
01:26:00,280 --> 01:26:01,280
Very simple.

1709
01:26:01,280 --> 01:26:05,200
It's like every section has a night and they have a color and you cheer for them and that's

1710
01:26:05,200 --> 01:26:06,200
it.

1711
01:26:06,200 --> 01:26:08,000
And whoever wins, you get, Oh yeah, they win.

1712
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:13,120
That is also happening in this show in addition to seven other subplots, you are cheering

1713
01:26:13,120 --> 01:26:15,720
for your pirate to be the head of the pirates.

1714
01:26:15,720 --> 01:26:16,720
Is that what it is?

1715
01:26:16,720 --> 01:26:17,720
I never knew.

1716
01:26:17,720 --> 01:26:18,760
And this is a problem I have.

1717
01:26:18,760 --> 01:26:22,840
Like this is a thing that I have difficulty with in comics sometimes when there's like

1718
01:26:22,840 --> 01:26:29,640
a Dr. Doom mini series or a king pig mini series is you, it's like the bad guy becomes

1719
01:26:29,640 --> 01:26:34,840
less bad for a little bit so you can follow it or so like, so you're like, Oh wait, I

1720
01:26:34,840 --> 01:26:39,640
want this pirate to win, but do I want him to be most evil or less evil?

1721
01:26:39,640 --> 01:26:44,960
Cause the good guy because the pirate, the captain's son, but then he kind of gets redeemed

1722
01:26:44,960 --> 01:26:46,880
at like half the pirates get redeemed.

1723
01:26:46,880 --> 01:26:47,880
You're right.

1724
01:26:47,880 --> 01:26:52,600
You follow this so much better than I did and you were apparently high as a kite.

1725
01:26:52,600 --> 01:26:54,760
I was coming down once I got some food in me.

1726
01:26:54,760 --> 01:26:58,720
Once I got some food, uh, uh, but focus on the story.

1727
01:26:58,720 --> 01:27:03,080
So I can focus on this story cause our pirate became a good guy cause he was, he was in

1728
01:27:03,080 --> 01:27:08,640
love with the girl and then there was another pirate who the, the young, the good other

1729
01:27:08,640 --> 01:27:11,600
good guy pirates spared his life in a duel.

1730
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:13,320
So then he became a good guy.

1731
01:27:13,320 --> 01:27:16,280
Um, yeah, I don't remember any of this.

1732
01:27:16,280 --> 01:27:17,280
I'm just shoveling dessert.

1733
01:27:17,280 --> 01:27:21,240
But then the pirates who don't become good are just still like jolly pirate.

1734
01:27:21,240 --> 01:27:22,680
I mean they're not bad.

1735
01:27:22,680 --> 01:27:26,200
They're they're bad, but they're just like goofy.

1736
01:27:26,200 --> 01:27:30,320
Like they're still, I, well, one thing that happened was that as I said, our bottle of

1737
01:27:30,320 --> 01:27:34,080
wine was taken from the bar and delivered to us.

1738
01:27:34,080 --> 01:27:40,440
And then the other, the, your, the pirates that are not your allotted pirate, uh, like

1739
01:27:40,440 --> 01:27:44,820
the red, the red pirate comes around like mocking the other groups and the red pirate

1740
01:27:44,820 --> 01:27:48,800
took our bottle of wine away and I was genuinely furious.

1741
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:51,200
Pretend it to drink it.

1742
01:27:51,200 --> 01:27:53,000
Put it pretty close to his mouth.

1743
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:54,000
Yeah.

1744
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:55,000
Dirty pirate mouth.

1745
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:56,000
Right.

1746
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:57,000
Which reminded Aaron.

1747
01:27:57,000 --> 01:28:02,320
Oh, Aaron went to a red Robin, which used to have a walk around red Robin character

1748
01:28:02,320 --> 01:28:04,160
at one point in time.

1749
01:28:04,160 --> 01:28:08,000
And the red Robin would like do little hijinks at the tables.

1750
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:11,480
And at one point it's like she, I don't know if it happened to her, she saw it happen to

1751
01:28:11,480 --> 01:28:14,400
somebody else that he like touched the food.

1752
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:20,600
Like this gross bird suit picked up a burger, like put his hands in the drink or something.

1753
01:28:20,600 --> 01:28:23,760
And I was worried it was going to be a repeat of that with the red pirate.

1754
01:28:23,760 --> 01:28:24,760
Thank God he brought it back.

1755
01:28:24,760 --> 01:28:30,360
I was like, I guess, I mean, I guess that's the idea is to agitate me, but like, I don't

1756
01:28:30,360 --> 01:28:31,480
know where this guy has been.

1757
01:28:31,480 --> 01:28:34,760
I don't know what part of Fullerton or Garden Grove he lives in.

1758
01:28:34,760 --> 01:28:36,080
I don't know what he's getting up to.

1759
01:28:36,080 --> 01:28:37,080
He did it to me too.

1760
01:28:37,080 --> 01:28:41,600
Cause he goes, cause I had a red drink and he goes, so he goes, ah, you know what red

1761
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:42,600
drinks?

1762
01:28:42,600 --> 01:28:43,600
That's mine.

1763
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:44,600
Right?

1764
01:28:44,600 --> 01:28:45,600
I get to keep anything that's red.

1765
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:47,080
And he took mine and I like, it makes you mad.

1766
01:28:47,080 --> 01:28:48,400
I mean, it's good heel work.

1767
01:28:48,400 --> 01:28:49,680
It's to use a wrestling term.

1768
01:28:49,680 --> 01:28:51,680
It's like, cause I legit me like this motherfucker.

1769
01:28:51,680 --> 01:28:53,000
I want this guy to lose.

1770
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:54,480
I want red to go down.

1771
01:28:54,480 --> 01:28:55,640
He touched my food.

1772
01:28:55,640 --> 01:29:00,120
That being said, I don't care for anyone, uh, fucking around with my food or drink.

1773
01:29:00,120 --> 01:29:01,480
I don't want any sanitary issues.

1774
01:29:01,480 --> 01:29:02,480
I like the bits.

1775
01:29:02,480 --> 01:29:06,640
Come over and do a bit and tell me you're gonna, you know, make me walk the plank.

1776
01:29:06,640 --> 01:29:07,640
That's all good fun.

1777
01:29:07,640 --> 01:29:08,640
Yeah.

1778
01:29:08,640 --> 01:29:09,640
Call me ugly or whatever.

1779
01:29:09,640 --> 01:29:10,640
Don't take my wine.

1780
01:29:10,640 --> 01:29:12,320
Don't take away the thing that's getting me through this.

1781
01:29:12,320 --> 01:29:18,200
Cause like, I don't, I, if somebody missed, like if a waiter mishandles a drink glass,

1782
01:29:18,200 --> 01:29:19,760
I will just like not drink it.

1783
01:29:19,760 --> 01:29:23,400
Like if they put, if their thumb is too close to the top where I might sip out of, I don't

1784
01:29:23,400 --> 01:29:24,400
like that.

1785
01:29:24,400 --> 01:29:27,080
So, uh, I'm thinking that it was your birthday and we had pre contact, we should have slipped

1786
01:29:27,080 --> 01:29:28,080
them info about you.

1787
01:29:28,080 --> 01:29:33,680
I hear you're scared of the dinosaur ride.

1788
01:29:33,680 --> 01:29:37,640
Your attention to ticket booking detail is all consuming.

1789
01:29:37,640 --> 01:29:40,200
It's a problem.

1790
01:29:40,200 --> 01:29:43,600
Here's a dry detail I noticed that I was fascinated by.

1791
01:29:43,600 --> 01:29:48,680
So, you know, in this place or like medieval times, there, there, the food you get is stuff

1792
01:29:48,680 --> 01:29:51,320
you can make in large quantities.

1793
01:29:51,320 --> 01:29:55,880
So, uh, uh, they started, they said like, do you want soup or salad?

1794
01:29:55,880 --> 01:29:57,680
And I think most of us went with soup.

1795
01:29:57,680 --> 01:30:00,000
Uh, you got salad?

1796
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:01,000
Soup.

1797
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:03,000
Oh, I misheard you.

1798
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:04,000
Nice.

1799
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:10,360
Uh, but so let's advertise our podcast with that section.

1800
01:30:10,360 --> 01:30:11,360
Jason.

1801
01:30:11,360 --> 01:30:12,360
Oh, thanks.

1802
01:30:12,360 --> 01:30:14,400
Uh, come down dude.

1803
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:17,520
Hey, we're here on earth, Mike.

1804
01:30:17,520 --> 01:30:22,680
They put down the empty bowls and then they just came around with like, like pictures

1805
01:30:22,680 --> 01:30:28,040
like, like you would have, uh, my mom has a bunch of these cause she just drinks coffee

1806
01:30:28,040 --> 01:30:29,040
all day long.

1807
01:30:29,040 --> 01:30:31,940
So she bores like coffee and the keys keeps it hot for awhile.

1808
01:30:31,940 --> 01:30:34,440
Like these crafts, but of soup.

1809
01:30:34,440 --> 01:30:38,960
So they were like pouring pitchers of soup coming around and I'm like, fast.

1810
01:30:38,960 --> 01:30:41,400
I'm like, Oh, that's, that's how they do it.

1811
01:30:41,400 --> 01:30:46,240
And similar to like when they came around, the magician secret revealed.

1812
01:30:46,240 --> 01:30:48,720
I mean, I was interested in how they make it.

1813
01:30:48,720 --> 01:30:51,320
And then they came around with the, the chicken.

1814
01:30:51,320 --> 01:30:53,700
Most of us had a chicken.

1815
01:30:53,700 --> 01:30:57,520
It was like chicken mashed potatoes and some mixed vegetables.

1816
01:30:57,520 --> 01:31:01,880
But there was a vegetarian, a vegetarian that we had a couple of vegetarians walk us through

1817
01:31:01,880 --> 01:31:03,120
the vegetarian dish.

1818
01:31:03,120 --> 01:31:07,420
Uh, it was squash ravioli, which in and of itself is fine.

1819
01:31:07,420 --> 01:31:14,600
It was in a cream sauce, which would not be, uh, Aaron or my preference, but, uh, fine.

1820
01:31:14,600 --> 01:31:16,360
We can do, we can deal with that.

1821
01:31:16,360 --> 01:31:21,480
But then like on top of it, there's like a, uh, it's the, she described it as like balsamic

1822
01:31:21,480 --> 01:31:28,600
vinaigrette, just like salad dressing put on top of the, she had to just scrape it all

1823
01:31:28,600 --> 01:31:29,600
off the top.

1824
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:32,380
It was the strangest kind of, and they brag about it on the site.

1825
01:31:32,380 --> 01:31:33,600
Two scoops of mashed potatoes.

1826
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:34,600
Oh, that's right.

1827
01:31:34,600 --> 01:31:35,600
Yeah.

1828
01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:36,600
Yeah.

1829
01:31:36,600 --> 01:31:37,600
Yeah.

1830
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:39,400
Mashed potatoes and ravioli with balsamic vinaigrette all over it.

1831
01:31:39,400 --> 01:31:44,480
I, and I don't mean for this to be, if, if this is my legitimate one, cause I think they

1832
01:31:44,480 --> 01:31:46,920
do a good job.

1833
01:31:46,920 --> 01:31:48,240
This is inexplicable.

1834
01:31:48,240 --> 01:31:52,460
Just change your, what is it doing for you to have this balsamic sauce and other people

1835
01:31:52,460 --> 01:31:55,140
about it, other people complained about it online.

1836
01:31:55,140 --> 01:31:56,140
It's not just us.

1837
01:31:56,140 --> 01:32:03,120
It seems like what, um, it was a good amount of food, but it seemed like what a well intentioned,

1838
01:32:03,120 --> 01:32:09,000
like if you, if you brought someone you were dating home for the first time, well intentioned

1839
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:11,320
mother was like, I hear you're a vegetarian.

1840
01:32:11,320 --> 01:32:14,040
So I made this special for you.

1841
01:32:14,040 --> 01:32:16,840
And it's like, okay, ravioli with cream sauce.

1842
01:32:16,840 --> 01:32:20,280
And I was making potatoes anyway, so you get double potatoes.

1843
01:32:20,280 --> 01:32:25,320
It is, I was going to say, it's like, say you were at the table and, and mom just learned

1844
01:32:25,320 --> 01:32:26,320
that this person was a vegetarian.

1845
01:32:26,320 --> 01:32:27,580
She's like, Oh, don't worry.

1846
01:32:27,580 --> 01:32:28,940
I'll be right back.

1847
01:32:28,940 --> 01:32:32,240
And like whatever she had in the kitchen, she was like, all right, what am I going to

1848
01:32:32,240 --> 01:32:33,240
do?

1849
01:32:33,240 --> 01:32:34,240
Okay.

1850
01:32:34,240 --> 01:32:35,240
Ravioli.

1851
01:32:35,240 --> 01:32:36,240
Oh, maybe I'll put this on it.

1852
01:32:36,240 --> 01:32:37,240
And just like, here we go.

1853
01:32:37,240 --> 01:32:40,720
And um, the shake and bake powder is not, does not have meat in it.

1854
01:32:40,720 --> 01:32:44,480
So, so let's sprinkle a little of that on there and maybe some captain crunch.

1855
01:32:44,480 --> 01:32:46,720
We'll put it, do we have a photo of this?

1856
01:32:46,720 --> 01:32:47,720
We have a photo of this, right?

1857
01:32:47,720 --> 01:32:48,720
Uh, we'll find it.

1858
01:32:48,720 --> 01:32:49,720
We'll figure it out.

1859
01:32:49,720 --> 01:32:50,720
Yeah.

1860
01:32:50,720 --> 01:32:52,760
Cause it looked bizarre as well.

1861
01:32:52,760 --> 01:32:58,520
So this honestly might be my only suggestion for this place in the, in the near future

1862
01:32:58,520 --> 01:33:00,360
is just get rid of that sauce.

1863
01:33:00,360 --> 01:33:01,760
Otherwise pretty good time.

1864
01:33:01,760 --> 01:33:02,760
Yeah.

1865
01:33:02,760 --> 01:33:05,080
And, and I liked the chicken and potatoes that I had.

1866
01:33:05,080 --> 01:33:06,080
I thought it was pretty good.

1867
01:33:06,080 --> 01:33:07,080
I liked it.

1868
01:33:07,080 --> 01:33:09,960
And then you get a second round, center round of shrimp skewers.

1869
01:33:09,960 --> 01:33:10,960
Yes.

1870
01:33:10,960 --> 01:33:13,840
Which was very funny because they set it up in the show.

1871
01:33:13,840 --> 01:33:15,560
They're like, we're missing something.

1872
01:33:15,560 --> 01:33:16,880
You're all missing.

1873
01:33:16,880 --> 01:33:19,320
Like he's, he lays it on really thick.

1874
01:33:19,320 --> 01:33:26,040
Like, but the pirates life is not complete without your shrimp skewer.

1875
01:33:26,040 --> 01:33:28,520
And at that point they announced, they announced the shrimp skewers.

1876
01:33:28,520 --> 01:33:30,960
Jason stood up and started applauding.

1877
01:33:30,960 --> 01:33:32,100
He was so excited.

1878
01:33:32,100 --> 01:33:33,840
This was his favorite part of the show.

1879
01:33:33,840 --> 01:33:39,920
I, oh, and then also too, they're coming around.

1880
01:33:39,920 --> 01:33:43,680
They're coming around with like the buffet tray, like the, the steamer trays they have

1881
01:33:43,680 --> 01:33:44,680
in buffet.

1882
01:33:44,680 --> 01:33:45,680
And they're like, you want more chicken?

1883
01:33:45,680 --> 01:33:46,680
It's like, right.

1884
01:33:46,680 --> 01:33:47,680
They were coming around.

1885
01:33:47,680 --> 01:33:49,320
I had a little more.

1886
01:33:49,320 --> 01:33:53,280
I honestly wanted more potatoes, but I was like, oh, this guy's got a lot going on.

1887
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:54,280
I don't want to fuck him.

1888
01:33:54,280 --> 01:33:58,040
I already like at some point like stopped and was like, Hey, could I get a glass of

1889
01:33:58,040 --> 01:33:59,040
water too?

1890
01:33:59,040 --> 01:34:01,880
And he's like, yeah, yeah, let me, uh, yeah.

1891
01:34:01,880 --> 01:34:02,880
And a few minutes.

1892
01:34:02,880 --> 01:34:04,680
And then cause they're like, they run it.

1893
01:34:04,680 --> 01:34:06,000
It's a military operation.

1894
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,800
Great job of getting all the food out.

1895
01:34:08,800 --> 01:34:13,140
But like the show is going on to, there are sword fights happening when they're getting

1896
01:34:13,140 --> 01:34:14,140
you sex.

1897
01:34:14,140 --> 01:34:17,240
Explosions, cannons are going off.

1898
01:34:17,240 --> 01:34:18,240
Which we aren't describing.

1899
01:34:18,240 --> 01:34:21,760
We're talking about the food and not, there's like a dragon that comes out.

1900
01:34:21,760 --> 01:34:22,760
But anyway, mashed potatoes.

1901
01:34:22,760 --> 01:34:23,760
I love the dragons.

1902
01:34:23,760 --> 01:34:24,760
My favorite.

1903
01:34:24,760 --> 01:34:25,760
The dragon was great.

1904
01:34:25,760 --> 01:34:31,460
I think we saw a dragon specific show that I saw described alternately as the jewel legend

1905
01:34:31,460 --> 01:34:34,560
of the Loch Ness monster or rise of the sea dragon.

1906
01:34:34,560 --> 01:34:36,040
That was one of the shows that we saw.

1907
01:34:36,040 --> 01:34:37,040
Okay.

1908
01:34:37,040 --> 01:34:38,040
Right.

1909
01:34:38,040 --> 01:34:41,160
So there's a jewel that's held in the sea, but then there's a curse jewel that summons

1910
01:34:41,160 --> 01:34:44,260
the Loch Ness monster, which is different.

1911
01:34:44,260 --> 01:34:45,260
This is Scottish.

1912
01:34:45,260 --> 01:34:47,040
This is a different mythology entirely.

1913
01:34:47,040 --> 01:34:52,880
It's Scottish in the pre-show seemed a little medieval, but then at the end there are red

1914
01:34:52,880 --> 01:34:55,440
coats in a very fun fashion.

1915
01:34:55,440 --> 01:34:57,000
Well that's a highlight.

1916
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:58,000
That's a highlight.

1917
01:34:58,000 --> 01:34:59,000
Yeah.

1918
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:00,880
Well that you might know this part.

1919
01:35:00,880 --> 01:35:03,720
You know, the phrase that I'm heading for probably another, my other favorite thing

1920
01:35:03,720 --> 01:35:06,460
that was shouted besides notes too.

1921
01:35:06,460 --> 01:35:09,720
Like Scott's lead over is like, I'm taking notes on this.

1922
01:35:09,720 --> 01:35:12,160
I think we got, I think we got an episode here.

1923
01:35:12,160 --> 01:35:13,160
Really you think?

1924
01:35:13,160 --> 01:35:16,640
You think we can talk for two rambling hours about this?

1925
01:35:16,640 --> 01:35:19,000
About a chicken on a plate?

1926
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:23,120
But the, uh, the shrimp skewers yell was very exciting, but also the way that they introduced

1927
01:35:23,120 --> 01:35:24,120
the red coats.

1928
01:35:24,120 --> 01:35:25,120
Yeah.

1929
01:35:25,120 --> 01:35:31,560
So, so when the day is saved by the good pirates and the ship is destroyed and there's explosions,

1930
01:35:31,560 --> 01:35:37,480
uh, they say, but let's hear it for the real heroes, your children.

1931
01:35:37,480 --> 01:35:41,400
And then all of these kids that they've snuck away that they've like, Hey, do you want to

1932
01:35:41,400 --> 01:35:43,440
come be a part of the show at the end?

1933
01:35:43,440 --> 01:35:47,040
And they put them in little outfits and given them little muskets.

1934
01:35:47,040 --> 01:35:49,880
So they're dressed like the red coat.

1935
01:35:49,880 --> 01:35:50,880
Yes.

1936
01:35:50,880 --> 01:35:55,280
They all got to fire at a ship and they all got to fire on this ship, but just the pirate,

1937
01:35:55,280 --> 01:35:56,440
the shrimp skewers thing.

1938
01:35:56,440 --> 01:36:02,840
And then him going, they're real heroes of the day, your children are my favorite.

1939
01:36:02,840 --> 01:36:03,840
That's the best line.

1940
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:04,840
Your children.

1941
01:36:04,840 --> 01:36:05,840
Your children.

1942
01:36:05,840 --> 01:36:08,200
Crucial article that makes that so funny.

1943
01:36:08,200 --> 01:36:11,920
Um, Hey, you know, who else was part of it?

1944
01:36:11,920 --> 01:36:15,520
Your podcast cohost, Mike Carlson.

1945
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:16,520
You were in the show.

1946
01:36:16,520 --> 01:36:19,760
At a certain point, the waiter, the waiter comes up to me and goes, you want to be in

1947
01:36:19,760 --> 01:36:21,040
the show?

1948
01:36:21,040 --> 01:36:22,040
And I go, Whoa, excuse me.

1949
01:36:22,040 --> 01:36:23,280
He goes, yeah, you want to be in the show?

1950
01:36:23,280 --> 01:36:24,280
It's your birthday.

1951
01:36:24,280 --> 01:36:25,280
You were identified, right?

1952
01:36:25,280 --> 01:36:26,480
I didn't have anything to do with my birthday.

1953
01:36:26,480 --> 01:36:29,960
I think he just like, they needed, here's what, here's what I figured out.

1954
01:36:29,960 --> 01:36:35,000
They needed who they thought had the best upper body strength in the arena.

1955
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:39,520
And that's how little choice they had.

1956
01:36:39,520 --> 01:36:44,200
Cause I looked at everybody picked and it was all like people, like men.

1957
01:36:44,200 --> 01:36:45,200
And I'm not being sexist.

1958
01:36:45,200 --> 01:36:46,200
What did you have to do?

1959
01:36:46,200 --> 01:36:48,120
Well, that's what I'm like, I'm like, yes.

1960
01:36:48,120 --> 01:36:49,920
And it's about the show was going on and I'm like, great.

1961
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:53,440
They're going to, cause they, at this point they had brought like groups of kids and people

1962
01:36:53,440 --> 01:36:54,440
on stage.

1963
01:36:54,440 --> 01:36:56,040
They do bits with them.

1964
01:36:56,040 --> 01:36:58,600
There's the whole segments of the show with audience participation.

1965
01:36:58,600 --> 01:36:59,600
I go, great.

1966
01:36:59,600 --> 01:37:04,520
I'm going to get on the ship and this is, I'm going to, this is going to be great.

1967
01:37:04,520 --> 01:37:09,880
So they bring me outside with a bunch of other dudes and I go, Oh, it's like all dudes.

1968
01:37:09,880 --> 01:37:11,920
And I'm like trying to figure out what the idea is here.

1969
01:37:11,920 --> 01:37:16,480
Cause there was no like younger people than everyone's probably like 18 and older.

1970
01:37:16,480 --> 01:37:18,880
They make me put on a little vest and a little hat.

1971
01:37:18,880 --> 01:37:23,300
And they go, when we give you the signal, we just want you to pull the rope and a flag

1972
01:37:23,300 --> 01:37:24,440
will go up.

1973
01:37:24,440 --> 01:37:25,840
And I was like, Oh, okay.

1974
01:37:25,840 --> 01:37:30,880
And I was like, there was a real, like the wind, the wind left my sails.

1975
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:35,720
So we walked down and I don't remember what the plot point in the story was, but they

1976
01:37:35,720 --> 01:37:41,320
go now, and then three dudes and I just pull on a big rope and a flag goes up and then

1977
01:37:41,320 --> 01:37:45,240
like the waiter hooks it to something and they go, all right, thanks.

1978
01:37:45,240 --> 01:37:46,240
That was it.

1979
01:37:46,240 --> 01:37:47,240
And I was like, Oh man.

1980
01:37:47,240 --> 01:37:49,860
You did a formal thing that they needed.

1981
01:37:49,860 --> 01:37:54,240
So yeah, they were just, there's probably an old pirates book that's just like any man

1982
01:37:54,240 --> 01:38:00,080
over 18 will be the one who go, you collected all the over 18 men and get them to hoist

1983
01:38:00,080 --> 01:38:01,080
the flags.

1984
01:38:01,080 --> 01:38:02,440
And it was a real let down.

1985
01:38:02,440 --> 01:38:05,200
I didn't get to like sass the pirate or anything.

1986
01:38:05,200 --> 01:38:06,920
I didn't get to have any fun like that.

1987
01:38:06,920 --> 01:38:10,600
It was just labor.

1988
01:38:10,600 --> 01:38:12,520
Can I just do this?

1989
01:38:12,520 --> 01:38:16,560
Like I don't want each of these to be a full individual conversation.

1990
01:38:16,560 --> 01:38:18,600
I just want to run through my bullet points.

1991
01:38:18,600 --> 01:38:23,320
Do you have the pop culture references written down?

1992
01:38:23,320 --> 01:38:24,320
Not necessarily.

1993
01:38:24,320 --> 01:38:25,320
Okay.

1994
01:38:25,320 --> 01:38:27,640
Let me just skim through like just notes that I took.

1995
01:38:27,640 --> 01:38:30,680
I wrote down in all caps, the tales are true.

1996
01:38:30,680 --> 01:38:32,600
That must get said at some point.

1997
01:38:32,600 --> 01:38:34,480
Ranch dressing ravioli covered that.

1998
01:38:34,480 --> 01:38:38,840
Uh, I wrote down the phrase shrimp and coffee because that's what I was mainlining.

1999
01:38:38,840 --> 01:38:42,520
I was alternating shrimp and coffee and wine.

2000
01:38:42,520 --> 01:38:47,480
Uh, uh, perhaps almost as disgusting as your Liberty Tavern.

2001
01:38:47,480 --> 01:38:51,480
I wish they had had, uh, that's a complaint about the food I had.

2002
01:38:51,480 --> 01:38:53,080
I wish there was some real creamer.

2003
01:38:53,080 --> 01:38:56,080
They just found a creamer available.

2004
01:38:56,080 --> 01:38:58,080
You asked for that and they pour in more of that balsamic.

2005
01:38:58,080 --> 01:39:01,280
I guess I could have asked because they must have had glasses of milk.

2006
01:39:01,280 --> 01:39:02,280
Shit.

2007
01:39:02,280 --> 01:39:06,360
I should have just said, can I have a glass of milk for a coffee?

2008
01:39:06,360 --> 01:39:09,400
Drinking milk and then like raising it like a toast.

2009
01:39:09,400 --> 01:39:10,400
Oh boy.

2010
01:39:10,400 --> 01:39:16,480
Let me see, I wrote down the phrase, the line, I won't let anything happen to you or your

2011
01:39:16,480 --> 01:39:17,960
gypsy friend.

2012
01:39:17,960 --> 01:39:25,280
Um, I wrote down the line, uh, the, there's something about like the, oh, uh, we're, we're

2013
01:39:25,280 --> 01:39:27,080
really going to summon the terrible beast.

2014
01:39:27,080 --> 01:39:28,480
Oh, you mean my mother-in-law?

2015
01:39:28,480 --> 01:39:29,880
Oh yeah.

2016
01:39:29,880 --> 01:39:31,320
That brought the house down.

2017
01:39:31,320 --> 01:39:32,320
That joke.

2018
01:39:32,320 --> 01:39:33,320
Yeah.

2019
01:39:33,320 --> 01:39:34,320
The audience loved that.

2020
01:39:34,320 --> 01:39:38,680
It's a thing I remember from driving school that the guy, the guy, the hosting driving

2021
01:39:38,680 --> 01:39:42,080
school was doing a lot of mother-in-law material.

2022
01:39:42,080 --> 01:39:44,440
Uh, uh, wait, wait.

2023
01:39:44,440 --> 01:39:45,720
In my driving school.

2024
01:39:45,720 --> 01:39:47,120
Your actual driver's ed.

2025
01:39:47,120 --> 01:39:50,840
They're doing that to 15 and 16 year olds who do not have mother-in-laws.

2026
01:39:50,840 --> 01:39:51,840
No.

2027
01:39:51,840 --> 01:39:52,840
Yeah.

2028
01:39:52,840 --> 01:39:53,840
They kind of ate shit.

2029
01:39:53,840 --> 01:39:54,840
That's a good point.

2030
01:39:54,840 --> 01:39:55,840
Yeah.

2031
01:39:55,840 --> 01:39:56,840
You had to be aware.

2032
01:39:56,840 --> 01:39:57,840
Yeah.

2033
01:39:57,840 --> 01:39:59,840
My mother, my knowledge of mother-in-laws is passed down from my mom.

2034
01:39:59,840 --> 01:40:05,760
Like it's on, like I have to, it's secondhand information that mother-in-laws are bad.

2035
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:10,440
The mother-in-law you would most likely know would have been your, one of your grandmas.

2036
01:40:10,440 --> 01:40:11,960
Who I am forced to love.

2037
01:40:11,960 --> 01:40:12,960
Yeah.

2038
01:40:12,960 --> 01:40:13,960
So I'm not going to, yeah.

2039
01:40:13,960 --> 01:40:18,680
Why am I, why am I the ideal audience for a mother-in-law skewering material?

2040
01:40:18,680 --> 01:40:21,880
Um, I wrote down the word dick play.

2041
01:40:21,880 --> 01:40:25,920
Many of the jokes involved people's dicks being in danger.

2042
01:40:25,920 --> 01:40:26,920
Yes.

2043
01:40:26,920 --> 01:40:28,800
The gun being pointed at, yes, yeah, yeah.

2044
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:33,080
The gun being pointed at the head and like, oh no, the gun going down slightly and like,

2045
01:40:33,080 --> 01:40:34,880
oh no, it'd be a much bigger problem.

2046
01:40:34,880 --> 01:40:35,880
Yeah.

2047
01:40:35,880 --> 01:40:36,880
There was a comedic relief pirate.

2048
01:40:36,880 --> 01:40:44,160
There was a goofy first mate who was stripped of his title but then not executed because

2049
01:40:44,160 --> 01:40:47,480
he was the only pirate who knew how to make rum.

2050
01:40:47,480 --> 01:40:49,520
Yeah, right.

2051
01:40:49,520 --> 01:40:51,240
Uh huh.

2052
01:40:51,240 --> 01:40:52,240
That's my main stuff.

2053
01:40:52,240 --> 01:40:57,600
I also read, at some point it was announced Andre Batiste and the Orange Crew, who I assume

2054
01:40:57,600 --> 01:41:00,320
is related to John Batiste and Stacey.

2055
01:41:00,320 --> 01:41:07,200
I believe I leaned over to you and said, he is the Steuacle various fan theater.

2056
01:41:07,200 --> 01:41:08,200
Thank you for that.

2057
01:41:08,200 --> 01:41:09,200
Oh, laude.

2058
01:41:09,200 --> 01:41:15,520
That's what he does.

2059
01:41:15,520 --> 01:41:17,280
Just turn John Batiste's mic off.

2060
01:41:17,280 --> 01:41:18,280
That's all I want.

2061
01:41:18,280 --> 01:41:21,880
I'm airing all my late night grievances on this.

2062
01:41:21,880 --> 01:41:26,540
I just started keeping a list of what pop culture references there were and there was

2063
01:41:26,540 --> 01:41:29,600
less than I thought there would be, but they were kind of all over the map.

2064
01:41:29,600 --> 01:41:31,560
They referenced the Lion King at some point.

2065
01:41:31,560 --> 01:41:36,640
I think they did the like, ah, the opening.

2066
01:41:36,640 --> 01:41:41,160
There was a Lady Marmalade sequence, right?

2067
01:41:41,160 --> 01:41:42,760
There was a Frozen joke.

2068
01:41:42,760 --> 01:41:43,760
Yep.

2069
01:41:43,760 --> 01:41:44,760
Like, was it like...

2070
01:41:44,760 --> 01:41:46,920
Do you want to see a Snoom?

2071
01:41:46,920 --> 01:41:48,920
Yeah, or something about Let It Go.

2072
01:41:48,920 --> 01:41:52,680
Maybe like, yeah, this song is still better than Let It Go.

2073
01:41:52,680 --> 01:41:57,180
Oh, so it's the new... that's taken over as it's from It's a Small World as the go-to

2074
01:41:57,180 --> 01:41:58,180
annoying song.

2075
01:41:58,180 --> 01:41:59,180
I think that's right.

2076
01:41:59,180 --> 01:42:01,720
There were parents who had to listen to it over and over.

2077
01:42:01,720 --> 01:42:07,440
There was a bit where they were teaching a kid how to be a pirate and they were like,

2078
01:42:07,440 --> 01:42:08,720
ah, you're good at thieving.

2079
01:42:08,720 --> 01:42:10,280
You'll make a great pirate.

2080
01:42:10,280 --> 01:42:12,080
Or a politician.

2081
01:42:12,080 --> 01:42:15,920
And all the adults laughed at that one.

2082
01:42:15,920 --> 01:42:19,480
And then there was definitely, I don't remember the context, but there was definitely a Dilly

2083
01:42:19,480 --> 01:42:21,340
Dilly joke.

2084
01:42:21,340 --> 01:42:22,340
What's Dilly Dilly?

2085
01:42:22,340 --> 01:42:26,120
Oh, it's this Bud Light campaign.

2086
01:42:26,120 --> 01:42:30,360
There are ads that are on the air right now with a king and his knights and people bringing

2087
01:42:30,360 --> 01:42:33,400
him Bud Light and he goes Dilly Dilly.

2088
01:42:33,400 --> 01:42:34,400
You guys not know what this is.

2089
01:42:34,400 --> 01:42:35,400
I don't know what you're talking about.

2090
01:42:35,400 --> 01:42:36,400
It's a huge hit.

2091
01:42:36,400 --> 01:42:37,400
Really?

2092
01:42:37,400 --> 01:42:38,400
It's like the newest Bud-Riser bug.

2093
01:42:38,400 --> 01:42:40,480
You're more up on current things though than we are.

2094
01:42:40,480 --> 01:42:41,480
Yeah.

2095
01:42:41,480 --> 01:42:42,480
I think you are.

2096
01:42:42,480 --> 01:42:44,200
Did you audition for that commercial?

2097
01:42:44,200 --> 01:42:45,200
No, I'm not.

2098
01:42:45,200 --> 01:42:46,200
Were you watching it bitterly?

2099
01:42:46,200 --> 01:42:50,040
I would kill to be in Dilly Dilly, but I've got a conflict right now.

2100
01:42:50,040 --> 01:42:52,200
Yeah, you're chasing in the Chris Pratt...

2101
01:42:52,200 --> 01:42:55,220
I stand for the fine Michelob Ultra brand.

2102
01:42:55,220 --> 01:42:57,200
We're covered in the beer area.

2103
01:42:57,200 --> 01:42:59,480
Yeah, until they release me.

2104
01:42:59,480 --> 01:43:02,800
But is non-alcoholic beer a conflict with beer?

2105
01:43:02,800 --> 01:43:03,800
What?

2106
01:43:03,800 --> 01:43:04,800
Michelob Ultra is alcohol.

2107
01:43:04,800 --> 01:43:05,800
Oh, I'm confused.

2108
01:43:05,800 --> 01:43:06,800
I was thinking it was the other one.

2109
01:43:06,800 --> 01:43:07,800
It's just a different light beer.

2110
01:43:07,800 --> 01:43:08,800
Oh, it is not O'Doul's.

2111
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:10,040
Does it have a great relaxing taste?

2112
01:43:10,040 --> 01:43:12,020
Yeah, and it's got low calories.

2113
01:43:12,020 --> 01:43:13,240
It's the fit beer.

2114
01:43:13,240 --> 01:43:18,000
There's a lot of complimentary ads of people exercising and then later on enjoying a Michelob

2115
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:19,000
Ultra.

2116
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:20,000
60 calories.

2117
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:25,920
So taken from the PA himself, from the Chris Pratt ad.

2118
01:43:25,920 --> 01:43:27,920
I have two other things.

2119
01:43:27,920 --> 01:43:33,140
There's a shots shots shots reference, the song, and then there's a reference to some

2120
01:43:33,140 --> 01:43:35,920
internet dance that only Jason knew.

2121
01:43:35,920 --> 01:43:37,560
There was some dance going on.

2122
01:43:37,560 --> 01:43:38,920
Oh God, what was it?

2123
01:43:38,920 --> 01:43:40,320
And I don't know what it was.

2124
01:43:40,320 --> 01:43:41,320
The Dougie.

2125
01:43:41,320 --> 01:43:42,320
The audience went nuts.

2126
01:43:42,320 --> 01:43:43,800
It wasn't the Harlem Shake.

2127
01:43:43,800 --> 01:43:46,080
The audience went nuts for it.

2128
01:43:46,080 --> 01:43:47,800
And I was just like, I don't know what this is.

2129
01:43:47,800 --> 01:43:49,340
Watch that Soulja Boy?

2130
01:43:49,340 --> 01:43:51,240
What dance are we talking about?

2131
01:43:51,240 --> 01:43:52,880
We'll figure it out.

2132
01:43:52,880 --> 01:43:53,880
It's along those lines.

2133
01:43:53,880 --> 01:43:54,880
I forget.

2134
01:43:54,880 --> 01:43:57,440
But people loved it.

2135
01:43:57,440 --> 01:44:00,720
I wrote down, he thinks he's Magic Mike.

2136
01:44:00,720 --> 01:44:02,240
He's a magic moron.

2137
01:44:02,240 --> 01:44:05,400
Right, because someone does a break dance.

2138
01:44:05,400 --> 01:44:06,400
That one.

2139
01:44:06,400 --> 01:44:07,400
Sexy break dance at some point.

2140
01:44:07,400 --> 01:44:11,740
I found, I was looking at YouTube and I found a clip of the show and I don't know what version

2141
01:44:11,740 --> 01:44:18,000
of the show this was from, but I was, here, I'll just read it before I comment on it.

2142
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:22,520
The pirate is talking to a kid and the pirate goes, do you have a gun or a knife or a weapon

2143
01:44:22,520 --> 01:44:24,080
on you of any kind?

2144
01:44:24,080 --> 01:44:25,080
And the little girl goes, no.

2145
01:44:25,080 --> 01:44:29,200
And then he goes, oh no, so you're not from LA then?

2146
01:44:29,200 --> 01:44:30,320
That was in our show too.

2147
01:44:30,320 --> 01:44:32,640
Was it in our show?

2148
01:44:32,640 --> 01:44:33,880
That's a weird joke.

2149
01:44:33,880 --> 01:44:36,600
Orange County, LA jab.

2150
01:44:36,600 --> 01:44:37,600
That's a weird joke, right?

2151
01:44:37,600 --> 01:44:40,320
Especially because there's like KKK in Orange County.

2152
01:44:40,320 --> 01:44:42,200
Why are we slagging on LA?

2153
01:44:42,200 --> 01:44:46,480
Orange County is the KKK capital of the West Coast.

2154
01:44:46,480 --> 01:44:51,880
So I was like, oh, that's a, what an odd slag.

2155
01:44:51,880 --> 01:44:52,880
Yeah.

2156
01:44:52,880 --> 01:44:55,160
Yeah, there's, that was in our show.

2157
01:44:55,160 --> 01:44:56,160
I forgot about that in our show.

2158
01:44:56,160 --> 01:44:58,160
I feel like it was in our show too.

2159
01:44:58,160 --> 01:44:59,160
That's probably got to come out.

2160
01:44:59,160 --> 01:45:00,160
How dare you.

2161
01:45:00,160 --> 01:45:01,160
That's got to come out, right?

2162
01:45:01,160 --> 01:45:02,160
That's got to.

2163
01:45:02,160 --> 01:45:06,120
There was some generic joke like that or the politician thing is just like broad enough

2164
01:45:06,120 --> 01:45:09,160
that it really hits.

2165
01:45:09,160 --> 01:45:15,360
There was an actual, like, I thought this was, this was a decent gag where like a pirate

2166
01:45:15,360 --> 01:45:21,040
turns around and does like hits, runs face first into a pole and like does a pratfall

2167
01:45:21,040 --> 01:45:24,280
and one of them yells, why did we put that there?

2168
01:45:24,280 --> 01:45:25,640
And I was like, oh, that's fun.

2169
01:45:25,640 --> 01:45:30,120
Like I've seen that in a lot of things and I do laugh at it when it's like, oh, why did

2170
01:45:30,120 --> 01:45:31,360
I leave that there?

2171
01:45:31,360 --> 01:45:32,360
You know, sure.

2172
01:45:32,360 --> 01:45:33,840
That's a solid joke.

2173
01:45:33,840 --> 01:45:35,880
The fighting, I'll say this about the fighting.

2174
01:45:35,880 --> 01:45:37,040
The fighting was okay.

2175
01:45:37,040 --> 01:45:43,280
And I probably am biased though because I am a big fan of professional wrestling and

2176
01:45:43,280 --> 01:45:47,640
I love a new Japan wrestling and it's strong style and they, they hit a little, they're,

2177
01:45:47,640 --> 01:45:49,400
they're kind of snug with the hits.

2178
01:45:49,400 --> 01:45:55,080
So I will say if some of these guys could maybe go and do a couple, a couple sessions

2179
01:45:55,080 --> 01:45:58,400
at a local pro wrestling school, I just want them to, you know, snug it up.

2180
01:45:58,400 --> 01:45:59,840
Let's, let's get the hits.

2181
01:45:59,840 --> 01:46:03,080
Let's get the fists a little closer to the head guys.

2182
01:46:03,080 --> 01:46:04,200
Let's get the clotheslines.

2183
01:46:04,200 --> 01:46:07,280
Let's really make it sword, sword and staff fight.

2184
01:46:07,280 --> 01:46:08,440
That was, that was good.

2185
01:46:08,440 --> 01:46:09,440
Yes.

2186
01:46:09,440 --> 01:46:10,440
Much easier to fake.

2187
01:46:10,440 --> 01:46:11,440
I feel.

2188
01:46:11,440 --> 01:46:12,440
Yes.

2189
01:46:12,440 --> 01:46:13,440
I think you're probably right about that.

2190
01:46:13,440 --> 01:46:16,320
And I think these guys all end up having to be jacks of all trades.

2191
01:46:16,320 --> 01:46:17,320
Oh yeah.

2192
01:46:17,320 --> 01:46:23,120
And, but which I'm, I am impressed by the like that, that they're doing acrobatics.

2193
01:46:23,120 --> 01:46:24,920
They're doing fight, they're doing sword fighting.

2194
01:46:24,920 --> 01:46:25,920
Some of them had to sing.

2195
01:46:25,920 --> 01:46:26,920
They're talking to the audience.

2196
01:46:26,920 --> 01:46:27,920
Yes.

2197
01:46:27,920 --> 01:46:28,920
Singing too.

2198
01:46:28,920 --> 01:46:32,560
There's such a wide gamut of, uh, tests that all these performers have to do.

2199
01:46:32,560 --> 01:46:33,960
And I think these are talented people.

2200
01:46:33,960 --> 01:46:34,960
Oh yeah.

2201
01:46:34,960 --> 01:46:38,240
There's a boat race at, there's a rowboat race at some point.

2202
01:46:38,240 --> 01:46:39,240
Oh that was fun.

2203
01:46:39,240 --> 01:46:42,760
They have to be pirates, but then they also have to be friendly to kids.

2204
01:46:42,760 --> 01:46:43,760
Like.

2205
01:46:43,760 --> 01:46:44,760
Yeah.

2206
01:46:44,760 --> 01:46:45,760
Take photos after.

2207
01:46:45,760 --> 01:46:46,760
Take photos.

2208
01:46:46,760 --> 01:46:47,760
Yeah.

2209
01:46:47,760 --> 01:46:48,760
They probably like bust the tables too.

2210
01:46:48,760 --> 01:46:53,640
I think there's a, there, I imagine if you're an Orange County performer, this is probably

2211
01:46:53,640 --> 01:46:54,640
a dream.

2212
01:46:54,640 --> 01:46:55,640
A good gig.

2213
01:46:55,640 --> 01:46:59,200
Uh, and one that leaves you some room to improvise and have fun with it.

2214
01:46:59,200 --> 01:47:02,200
And I hope they all, I hope it's a fun situation there at Pirates of the Caribbean.

2215
01:47:02,200 --> 01:47:03,200
Yeah.

2216
01:47:03,200 --> 01:47:06,680
I mean, I'm, look, I'm being a bit facetious when I want them to like really hit them,

2217
01:47:06,680 --> 01:47:09,320
hit each other during the fight.

2218
01:47:09,320 --> 01:47:13,800
Um, yeah, this is, I mean, what I'm saying is I think that they are stretched so thin

2219
01:47:13,800 --> 01:47:16,360
by the number of categories that they have to fall.

2220
01:47:16,360 --> 01:47:17,360
They're in great shape.

2221
01:47:17,360 --> 01:47:19,040
Our pirate was in great, oh my God.

2222
01:47:19,040 --> 01:47:20,040
Shout out to Jose.

2223
01:47:20,040 --> 01:47:26,040
I don't know his real name, but whoever Jose, whoever's the Wednesday Jose.

2224
01:47:26,040 --> 01:47:31,400
And the aerial work, like the, the, uh, trapeze style, the aerial work was, I didn't know

2225
01:47:31,400 --> 01:47:32,400
we were getting that.

2226
01:47:32,400 --> 01:47:34,000
That was very cool.

2227
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:40,360
And like just, it is a little out of nowhere, uh, in the show story wise, but it's like,

2228
01:47:40,360 --> 01:47:41,720
wow, this is kind of cool.

2229
01:47:41,720 --> 01:47:44,840
And like cool that they're like, man, people like to search us a lay stuff.

2230
01:47:44,840 --> 01:47:47,040
We should incorporate some of this into the show.

2231
01:47:47,040 --> 01:47:48,040
Yeah.

2232
01:47:48,040 --> 01:47:49,040
It's a lot.

2233
01:47:49,040 --> 01:47:50,040
I'll say it's a lot of show.

2234
01:47:50,040 --> 01:47:51,040
It's a ton of show.

2235
01:47:51,040 --> 01:47:52,040
It's a lot of show.

2236
01:47:52,040 --> 01:47:55,360
It doesn't feel like a, like a rip off for the price that you get.

2237
01:47:55,360 --> 01:47:58,360
We can, we have our palms about the food, but ultimately like food.

2238
01:47:58,360 --> 01:47:59,720
Yeah, it is a lot of food.

2239
01:47:59,720 --> 01:48:00,720
Much of it is fine.

2240
01:48:00,720 --> 01:48:05,080
So we got out, uh, uh, because of the nice booking, we got two pieces of cake.

2241
01:48:05,080 --> 01:48:09,600
Everyone in the building got Trace Laje's cake, but the extra birthday treat.

2242
01:48:09,600 --> 01:48:10,800
We got chocolate cake too.

2243
01:48:10,800 --> 01:48:12,280
And I was just like, oh, two cakes.

2244
01:48:12,280 --> 01:48:14,200
This is the best night of my life.

2245
01:48:14,200 --> 01:48:20,640
The way I robbed you of more cake, I'm as evil as that captain Sebastian the Black.

2246
01:48:20,640 --> 01:48:25,240
I absconded with it, uh, in me hybrid car.

2247
01:48:25,240 --> 01:48:30,600
Uh, look, that reminds me, I would have been eating that cake for breakfast the next day.

2248
01:48:30,600 --> 01:48:31,600
You'll seek revenge.

2249
01:48:31,600 --> 01:48:33,000
You better watch out.

2250
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:35,280
When you least expect it, there be...

2251
01:48:35,280 --> 01:48:41,060
Do not, I'll say this, do not leave a pie cooling on a windowsill anytime soon because

2252
01:48:41,060 --> 01:48:42,640
he will float up and take it.

2253
01:48:42,640 --> 01:48:46,600
No, and I will leave, like I will carve, uh, uh, some symbol.

2254
01:48:46,600 --> 01:48:53,120
I will carve like two lines and a half circle to let other wandering hobos know that there

2255
01:48:53,120 --> 01:48:55,440
may be a pie cooling on this.

2256
01:48:55,440 --> 01:48:57,400
They cool the pies on the windowsill here.

2257
01:48:57,400 --> 01:49:01,080
Uh, Jason Sheridan's hobo code.

2258
01:49:01,080 --> 01:49:05,240
You guys together as kind of a Yogi and Boo Boo vibe, I feel.

2259
01:49:05,240 --> 01:49:07,120
The pursuit of treats.

2260
01:49:07,120 --> 01:49:12,360
Um, we've talked about doing a show as Yogi and Boo Boo and Yogi and Peter Bogdanovich.

2261
01:49:12,360 --> 01:49:13,960
Yeah, we used to do a bit.

2262
01:49:13,960 --> 01:49:17,480
We never did it in shows, just around Friends.

2263
01:49:17,480 --> 01:49:19,960
Probably just, and I'm sure it was incredibly annoying to watch.

2264
01:49:19,960 --> 01:49:22,040
And I don't even think it's that good of a bit, but we did it.

2265
01:49:22,040 --> 01:49:23,040
No, it's not.

2266
01:49:23,040 --> 01:49:27,320
Where Mike would do a Yogi Bear impression and I would do a Peter Bogdanovich impression.

2267
01:49:27,320 --> 01:49:31,960
Just talking about hanging out with Robert Evans and filming Paper Moon.

2268
01:49:31,960 --> 01:49:32,960
Bizarre.

2269
01:49:32,960 --> 01:49:35,720
Being married to the Civil Shepherd.

2270
01:49:35,720 --> 01:49:38,160
We're not gonna do it.

2271
01:49:38,160 --> 01:49:40,640
That bit wouldn't play with the dinner theater crowd.

2272
01:49:40,640 --> 01:49:44,400
That one's going over the heads of the people who like the Magic Mike joke.

2273
01:49:44,400 --> 01:49:45,640
That's for Audience of One.

2274
01:49:45,640 --> 01:49:46,640
Ryan Perez.

2275
01:49:46,640 --> 01:49:48,640
Fast cast from Ryan Perez.

2276
01:49:48,640 --> 01:49:51,040
Shout out to Ryan, Buena Park.

2277
01:49:51,040 --> 01:49:53,040
Hello Ryan Perez.

2278
01:49:53,040 --> 01:49:55,920
Wow, special message from Ryan.

2279
01:49:55,920 --> 01:49:57,880
I can do booboo and Yogi.

2280
01:49:57,880 --> 01:49:58,880
I liked it.

2281
01:49:58,880 --> 01:50:01,000
Good impression, good voice.

2282
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:04,720
So a lot of impressions of our friends today.

2283
01:50:04,720 --> 01:50:09,480
I want to say one more thing, which is that there is, as I said, there's a show in Orlando,

2284
01:50:09,480 --> 01:50:10,720
which is not currently open.

2285
01:50:10,720 --> 01:50:15,600
And there's also a pirate show in my beloved, it's somewhere we're gonna have to go to Myrtle

2286
01:50:15,600 --> 01:50:16,960
Beach, South Carolina.

2287
01:50:16,960 --> 01:50:21,120
Well, Audience, we're taking you there soon for quite a journey.

2288
01:50:21,120 --> 01:50:26,360
We're gonna have to buy a drone and three pairs of wrap-around sunglasses so we can

2289
01:50:26,360 --> 01:50:29,880
explore the Hard Rock, the abandoned Hard Rock Park.

2290
01:50:29,880 --> 01:50:30,880
Oh yes indeed.

2291
01:50:30,880 --> 01:50:31,880
Three backpacks.

2292
01:50:31,880 --> 01:50:34,080
Oh my god, I can't believe we're here.

2293
01:50:34,080 --> 01:50:36,840
We're in a closed, abandoned Hard Rock Park.

2294
01:50:36,840 --> 01:50:37,840
Unbelievable.

2295
01:50:37,840 --> 01:50:40,040
It's like Free Stone music.

2296
01:50:40,040 --> 01:50:43,440
So there's another dinner theater that's very similar, called Pirate's Voyage.

2297
01:50:43,440 --> 01:50:45,280
It is a Dolly Parton company.

2298
01:50:45,280 --> 01:50:48,360
It's part of the Dolly Parton family of themed entertainment.

2299
01:50:48,360 --> 01:50:49,360
Opened in 2010.

2300
01:50:49,360 --> 01:50:53,320
Which was first, but there's a competitive pirate show.

2301
01:50:53,320 --> 01:50:56,400
It was, similarly, it was also a Western show before.

2302
01:50:56,400 --> 01:50:58,560
It was called Dixie Stampede.

2303
01:50:58,560 --> 01:51:03,080
And I watched a video where a man who works there, the general manager or something, describes

2304
01:51:03,080 --> 01:51:07,960
the switch from Dixie Stampede to Pirate's Voyage and clearly is not happy that the switch

2305
01:51:07,960 --> 01:51:13,400
occurred but understands that the march of progress must plow forward.

2306
01:51:13,400 --> 01:51:16,040
And this show, I mean, it seems very similar.

2307
01:51:16,040 --> 01:51:19,040
There's a big lagoon, maybe a bigger theater.

2308
01:51:19,040 --> 01:51:21,520
It seems otherwise similar.

2309
01:51:21,520 --> 01:51:24,720
Ends with two exploding rum barrels, which sounds like a lot of fun.

2310
01:51:24,720 --> 01:51:29,280
But I'd also like to say, and we have actually missed this, that this is true of the Buena

2311
01:51:29,280 --> 01:51:35,480
Park show as well, that if you go during the holiday times, that there is a Christmas-centric

2312
01:51:35,480 --> 01:51:39,440
version of the show in which the pirates kidnap Santa.

2313
01:51:39,440 --> 01:51:41,600
And I think in this case, you're not rooting for any of the pirates.

2314
01:51:41,600 --> 01:51:44,280
I think you are pro-Santa escaping.

2315
01:51:44,280 --> 01:51:47,360
Which I can only assume and wish and pray that he does.

2316
01:51:47,360 --> 01:51:53,520
But there's also a Santa show, a Christmas show at the Myrtle Beach one.

2317
01:51:53,520 --> 01:52:00,740
And this is, we'll post the promo of this, but this is the most like mashing up Christmas

2318
01:52:00,740 --> 01:52:02,040
shit I've ever seen.

2319
01:52:02,040 --> 01:52:07,760
I really want to see the Christmas show there because a narrator in the show at some point

2320
01:52:07,760 --> 01:52:11,800
or in the ad at some point says, travel through time with Captain Scrooge.

2321
01:52:11,800 --> 01:52:13,080
Whoa, what?

2322
01:52:13,080 --> 01:52:14,080
Yeah.

2323
01:52:14,080 --> 01:52:15,720
Whoa, Captain Scrooge.

2324
01:52:15,720 --> 01:52:19,760
And at that point they cut to like sort of a man on a mast.

2325
01:52:19,760 --> 01:52:24,160
He looks like a statue or a ghost who's attached to the mast of the ship.

2326
01:52:24,160 --> 01:52:25,160
Wow.

2327
01:52:25,160 --> 01:52:27,640
So I want to know the story with Captain Scrooge very much.

2328
01:52:27,640 --> 01:52:28,640
But then also...

2329
01:52:28,640 --> 01:52:32,800
Or if they're going to die, they should do it and decrease the surplus population.

2330
01:52:32,800 --> 01:52:33,800
Wow.

2331
01:52:33,800 --> 01:52:37,940
We gotta see that.

2332
01:52:37,940 --> 01:52:43,800
But then also, like five seconds after Captain Scrooge, you cut to a nativity scene.

2333
01:52:43,800 --> 01:52:48,080
And they say, and celebrate the real meaning of Christmas.

2334
01:52:48,080 --> 01:52:49,360
This is at the Way to Park one.

2335
01:52:49,360 --> 01:52:50,360
No, no.

2336
01:52:50,360 --> 01:52:53,080
Sorry, this is at the Myrtle Beach one, the Dolly one.

2337
01:52:53,080 --> 01:52:54,560
Okay, yeah.

2338
01:52:54,560 --> 01:52:59,400
Yeah, they gotta acknowledge the religious end of Christmas, the true meaning of Christmas.

2339
01:52:59,400 --> 01:53:03,900
But then also, by the time that sentence is over, you're looking at the nativity, you're

2340
01:53:03,900 --> 01:53:11,680
looking at Mary Ray's the baby Jesus, the real meaning of, cut to, at the word Christmas,

2341
01:53:11,680 --> 01:53:17,160
cut away from Virgin Mary to a sea lion catching a wreath on its neck.

2342
01:53:17,160 --> 01:53:18,160
Whoa.

2343
01:53:18,160 --> 01:53:19,160
Hell yes.

2344
01:53:19,160 --> 01:53:22,720
So that being the end of the sentence, the emphasis seems to be that the real meaning

2345
01:53:22,720 --> 01:53:24,640
of Christmas is sea lion tricks.

2346
01:53:24,640 --> 01:53:29,920
You know, until the sea lion stuff, this reminded me, have I talked about the Sight and Sound

2347
01:53:29,920 --> 01:53:31,320
Theater before in Pennsylvania?

2348
01:53:31,320 --> 01:53:32,320
No.

2349
01:53:32,320 --> 01:53:40,320
This is a very elaborate theater that does pretty much exclusively Christian-themed productions.

2350
01:53:40,320 --> 01:53:42,000
Love it.

2351
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:45,120
And are famous for using live animals.

2352
01:53:45,120 --> 01:53:48,720
So every year at Christmas time, they got the full nativity going.

2353
01:53:48,720 --> 01:53:52,640
They got camels in there, they got donkeys in there, they got everything else in there.

2354
01:53:52,640 --> 01:53:58,080
When I was passing through the area where it's located recently, they're like, and check

2355
01:53:58,080 --> 01:53:59,760
out our spring show.

2356
01:53:59,760 --> 01:54:03,000
And it was just either a cross or a crown of thorns.

2357
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:07,160
It was a very dramatic looking postcard and it just said, like, Jesus of Nazareth.

2358
01:54:07,160 --> 01:54:08,160
Wow.

2359
01:54:08,160 --> 01:54:11,960
Yeah, you're acting like this is new for this year.

2360
01:54:11,960 --> 01:54:14,400
New for spring 2018.

2361
01:54:14,400 --> 01:54:15,400
What if we did a show about Jesus?

2362
01:54:15,400 --> 01:54:16,400
We got a Jesus one.

2363
01:54:16,400 --> 01:54:19,120
Like, yeah, they're all Jesus ones.

2364
01:54:19,120 --> 01:54:21,680
We, by the way, this was suggested on Twitter.

2365
01:54:21,680 --> 01:54:23,560
I was gonna propose it to you guys.

2366
01:54:23,560 --> 01:54:25,280
A show all about religious experiences.

2367
01:54:25,280 --> 01:54:26,280
Oh yeah, yeah.

2368
01:54:26,280 --> 01:54:27,280
Great.

2369
01:54:27,280 --> 01:54:28,880
I think that's a fun one.

2370
01:54:28,880 --> 01:54:30,580
We'll get to that at some point in time.

2371
01:54:30,580 --> 01:54:34,680
But we should start heading out of port here.

2372
01:54:34,680 --> 01:54:37,560
Any further thoughts, final thoughts about?

2373
01:54:37,560 --> 01:54:39,920
Oh, I'm sorry, we should mention Vampirates.

2374
01:54:39,920 --> 01:54:40,920
This is a Halloween show.

2375
01:54:40,920 --> 01:54:42,400
Oh, I want to see that too.

2376
01:54:42,400 --> 01:54:46,560
Yeah, which seems to be the same show, but they all have, like, white makeup on their

2377
01:54:46,560 --> 01:54:47,560
faces.

2378
01:54:47,560 --> 01:54:49,120
Yeah, I mean, I think, you know, look.

2379
01:54:49,120 --> 01:54:50,120
It was your birthday.

2380
01:54:50,120 --> 01:54:51,120
Did you have a good time?

2381
01:54:51,120 --> 01:54:54,280
Yeah, I had a very good time.

2382
01:54:54,280 --> 01:54:58,520
I was just, if we're being, you know, critics or whatever, I would be in, like, maybe a

2383
01:54:58,520 --> 01:55:05,440
script doctor just to punch it up a little, you know, a Babalu, a Vandalto script doctor,

2384
01:55:05,440 --> 01:55:06,440
bring this.

2385
01:55:06,440 --> 01:55:10,320
Just a little, there's a couple things maybe to make it simplify or whatever, but other

2386
01:55:10,320 --> 01:55:11,320
than that.

2387
01:55:11,320 --> 01:55:13,560
A little bit clearer of a story.

2388
01:55:13,560 --> 01:55:14,560
Yeah.

2389
01:55:14,560 --> 01:55:16,560
Although Jason followed, you got to be high to follow the story.

2390
01:55:16,560 --> 01:55:18,560
Yeah, you got to be toke it up, I guess.

2391
01:55:18,560 --> 01:55:22,880
Some things I can focus on really well, but not people ziplining right above my head.

2392
01:55:22,880 --> 01:55:24,240
Every now and then I let stuff slide.

2393
01:55:24,240 --> 01:55:26,360
I got to plus it up for this one.

2394
01:55:26,360 --> 01:55:29,440
There was no bread service.

2395
01:55:29,440 --> 01:55:31,560
I wanted some cornbread or a biscuit.

2396
01:55:31,560 --> 01:55:32,920
I wanted a little bread.

2397
01:55:32,920 --> 01:55:34,000
I see what you're saying.

2398
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:36,400
They had, I think they have bread at medieval times and it was good.

2399
01:55:36,400 --> 01:55:40,520
I think Pirates Voyage, you're getting like barbecue, and anachronistically you're getting

2400
01:55:40,520 --> 01:55:46,160
like corn on the cob and like short ribs there be.

2401
01:55:46,160 --> 01:55:47,160
That's a good question.

2402
01:55:47,160 --> 01:55:49,440
Like pirate, how do you, like what is pirate food?

2403
01:55:49,440 --> 01:55:54,920
I think the Blue Bayou restaurant at Disneyland has this issue that what is, does it mean

2404
01:55:54,920 --> 01:55:55,920
Spanish food?

2405
01:55:55,920 --> 01:55:56,920
Like what do you call pirate food?

2406
01:55:56,920 --> 01:56:03,920
Well, they're really like, I mean, Disney is really, that New Orleans Square, like the

2407
01:56:03,920 --> 01:56:07,880
New Orleans food, Cajun food and Cajun, I guess.

2408
01:56:07,880 --> 01:56:13,280
And chalking on like, well, if you leave the port, if you leave, go into the Gulf and then

2409
01:56:13,280 --> 01:56:16,440
go into the Bahamas, that's where there's pirates.

2410
01:56:16,440 --> 01:56:17,440
Right?

2411
01:56:17,440 --> 01:56:18,440
Like that's the logic of it.

2412
01:56:18,440 --> 01:56:19,920
I think so.

2413
01:56:19,920 --> 01:56:21,320
Where were pirates actually?

2414
01:56:21,320 --> 01:56:22,560
Kind of all over the place.

2415
01:56:22,560 --> 01:56:23,560
All over.

2416
01:56:23,560 --> 01:56:24,560
Yeah.

2417
01:56:24,560 --> 01:56:26,560
Sailing the seven seas, I believe.

2418
01:56:26,560 --> 01:56:27,560
Somalia.

2419
01:56:27,560 --> 01:56:28,560
Sure.

2420
01:56:28,560 --> 01:56:31,840
There should be a newer Somali pirate version of this.

2421
01:56:31,840 --> 01:56:36,880
I am the captain now into the, I bet when that was more of a catchphrase, I'm at one

2422
01:56:36,880 --> 01:56:40,680
of these dinner theaters or they had missed a big opportunity if nobody said, I'm the

2423
01:56:40,680 --> 01:56:41,680
captain now.

2424
01:56:41,680 --> 01:56:45,600
I am pretty sure this is a whole episode, another episode, but the Disney's California

2425
01:56:45,600 --> 01:56:50,600
Adventure Aladdin show, Genie, who does a lot of topical references, absolutely, when

2426
01:56:50,600 --> 01:56:53,280
we saw it once said, I'm the captain now after that came out.

2427
01:56:53,280 --> 01:56:58,280
So if Genie was using it, it was 10 minutes away at the pirate show, they must've been

2428
01:56:58,280 --> 01:56:59,280
using it.

2429
01:56:59,280 --> 01:57:03,200
And it's still, it's so funny that that is a scary movie about a harrowing situation.

2430
01:57:03,200 --> 01:57:08,520
And I do think like I saw Barkhat Abdi and Conan talking about like, everybody loves

2431
01:57:08,520 --> 01:57:09,520
the phrase.

2432
01:57:09,520 --> 01:57:14,680
Everybody's saying it at your, oh yes, everywhere I go, I'm the captain now.

2433
01:57:14,680 --> 01:57:19,360
The captain of a plane brought him into the cockpit so he could tell him that, hey, I

2434
01:57:19,360 --> 01:57:20,880
am the captain now.

2435
01:57:20,880 --> 01:57:23,260
That's great.

2436
01:57:23,260 --> 01:57:26,800
It is a joyous phrase, even though the real life situation was.

2437
01:57:26,800 --> 01:57:27,800
Horrifying.

2438
01:57:27,800 --> 01:57:28,800
Terrible.

2439
01:57:28,800 --> 01:57:33,400
I think you got to see the real Captain Phillips if pirates captured Captain Phillips and Sully

2440
01:57:33,400 --> 01:57:37,760
and they had to get out.

2441
01:57:37,760 --> 01:57:38,760
That's a great, yeah.

2442
01:57:38,760 --> 01:57:39,760
That's my plus up.

2443
01:57:39,760 --> 01:57:40,760
There you go.

2444
01:57:40,760 --> 01:57:44,840
Real world characters to face the pirates.

2445
01:57:44,840 --> 01:57:47,560
Did you want to talk maybe other types of adventures?

2446
01:57:47,560 --> 01:57:49,280
Oh, that's a good point.

2447
01:57:49,280 --> 01:57:50,280
Yeah.

2448
01:57:50,280 --> 01:57:55,960
I was, I was sort of like scheming, like if you could come, if you came up with a dinner

2449
01:57:55,960 --> 01:58:02,840
theater experience yourself, just because my brain started wandering to, I was between

2450
01:58:02,840 --> 01:58:08,320
two titles, whether it's law and dinner or dinner in the court, but there being a trial

2451
01:58:08,320 --> 01:58:11,440
situation.

2452
01:58:11,440 --> 01:58:14,640
And obviously now it would start with kind of, maybe you would, maybe it would be like

2453
01:58:14,640 --> 01:58:19,440
a law and order episode where you're watching a crime get investigated and that's the pre-show.

2454
01:58:19,440 --> 01:58:29,160
And then in the second half you go into the giant courtroom theater and obviously you

2455
01:58:29,160 --> 01:58:35,120
would, it wouldn't just be opening arguments and whatever and the trial occur.

2456
01:58:35,120 --> 01:58:41,200
You would have to represent that metaphorically through trampolines and jumps and sword fighting

2457
01:58:41,200 --> 01:58:42,200
and dick play.

2458
01:58:42,200 --> 01:58:47,440
It would be like representing through stunts what lawyers do, how they do combat in the

2459
01:58:47,440 --> 01:58:48,480
courtroom.

2460
01:58:48,480 --> 01:58:52,720
And then, and then all of us together, we all make the decision at the end and we're

2461
01:58:52,720 --> 01:58:55,040
at what they call us the hungry jury.

2462
01:58:55,040 --> 01:58:56,600
Oh, that's good.

2463
01:58:56,600 --> 01:58:59,840
I've got a pitch for the cold open part.

2464
01:58:59,840 --> 01:59:04,100
In the pre-show someone is stacking crates and then someone else is like opening the

2465
01:59:04,100 --> 01:59:08,880
crates up and they're pulling out trays of apps and then they're going around with, you

2466
01:59:08,880 --> 01:59:12,080
know, your mozzarella sticks, your hot wings.

2467
01:59:12,080 --> 01:59:16,600
And then like that's, that's obviously like towards the end of it, they're like, all right,

2468
01:59:16,600 --> 01:59:19,880
we're almost done stacking these crates and that's when they find the body.

2469
01:59:19,880 --> 01:59:22,120
Uh oh.

2470
01:59:22,120 --> 01:59:23,120
Everybody good wandering apps?

2471
01:59:23,120 --> 01:59:24,560
Everybody got their wandering apps?

2472
01:59:24,560 --> 01:59:25,560
Great.

2473
01:59:25,560 --> 01:59:26,560
So yeah, go ahead.

2474
01:59:26,560 --> 01:59:29,680
I was just going to say, I don't know why there hasn't been like a Cirque show about

2475
01:59:29,680 --> 01:59:32,160
a famous trial yet.

2476
01:59:32,160 --> 01:59:34,680
Representing the, yeah, the Scopes Monkey trial or?

2477
01:59:34,680 --> 01:59:36,080
Yeah, oh, classic trial.

2478
01:59:36,080 --> 01:59:38,880
I was going to say the Simpson trial, OJ Simpson trial, but.

2479
01:59:38,880 --> 01:59:41,160
Hey, well there, yeah, there's theme park possibilities.

2480
01:59:41,160 --> 01:59:42,160
Yeah.

2481
01:59:42,160 --> 01:59:44,160
Eight people versus OJ Simpson.

2482
01:59:44,160 --> 01:59:45,160
Cirque de Soleil show.

2483
01:59:45,160 --> 01:59:54,200
Hey look, Ryan Murphy's going to be doing that for the money if Olivia Haviland takes

2484
01:59:54,200 --> 01:59:59,160
him for all his work.

2485
01:59:59,160 --> 02:00:00,760
If you guys had invented dinner theater.

2486
02:00:00,760 --> 02:00:04,400
I don't have anything that well thought out, but the first thing I thought is a mole people

2487
02:00:04,400 --> 02:00:05,400
dinner theater.

2488
02:00:05,400 --> 02:00:07,760
Uh, you know, yeah, mole people.

2489
02:00:07,760 --> 02:00:10,720
Cause like you're thinking, I was like trying to think of like, okay, there's Knights, there's

2490
02:00:10,720 --> 02:00:16,040
pirates, what is an unrepresented like fun group of people that we don't see that may

2491
02:00:16,040 --> 02:00:19,960
be a little mythological or, uh, and I thought mole people.

2492
02:00:19,960 --> 02:00:24,440
And I think it's gotta be like, you're just, it's gotta be the same kind of medieval times

2493
02:00:24,440 --> 02:00:27,840
set up of like, who's going to be the king or queen of the mole people.

2494
02:00:27,840 --> 02:00:31,720
In my pitch also, there's an equal number of men and women because all these shows are

2495
02:00:31,720 --> 02:00:32,800
always always just men.

2496
02:00:32,800 --> 02:00:33,800
It's mostly men.

2497
02:00:33,800 --> 02:00:36,280
Let's get some mole women, not just mole men.

2498
02:00:36,280 --> 02:00:40,720
Wait, you're putting mole people on the same level as Knights and pirates?

2499
02:00:40,720 --> 02:00:44,160
I'm saying they're, they could become as high up.

2500
02:00:44,160 --> 02:00:46,320
You're trying to elevate the mole people.

2501
02:00:46,320 --> 02:00:47,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2502
02:00:47,320 --> 02:00:49,920
Like what, like what Bright did for Orcs.

2503
02:00:49,920 --> 02:00:50,920
That's right.

2504
02:00:50,920 --> 02:00:55,080
To popularize mole people as more of a genre and not like a really specific category.

2505
02:00:55,080 --> 02:00:56,080
Yes.

2506
02:00:56,080 --> 02:00:57,080
Um, what do they look like?

2507
02:00:57,080 --> 02:00:58,720
How do you describe mole person?

2508
02:00:58,720 --> 02:01:01,440
Uh, well there's different varieties of mole people.

2509
02:01:01,440 --> 02:01:05,040
Uh, they just sort of, they have like, like kind of beady eyes cause there's not a lot

2510
02:01:05,040 --> 02:01:07,280
of sun or very little sun.

2511
02:01:07,280 --> 02:01:11,840
Um, there's, I mean, sometimes they look like naked mole rats, like kind of shriveled up.

2512
02:01:11,840 --> 02:01:12,840
Yeah.

2513
02:01:12,840 --> 02:01:16,560
I mean they're like versions kind of like the Morlocks in that one movie, the book that

2514
02:01:16,560 --> 02:01:17,560
I can't think of.

2515
02:01:17,560 --> 02:01:18,560
The Time Machine.

2516
02:01:18,560 --> 02:01:19,560
The Time Machine, thank you.

2517
02:01:19,560 --> 02:01:25,680
And they probably, to eat, they probably like, uh, subsist on shrimp skewers and all you

2518
02:01:25,680 --> 02:01:26,680
can eat chicken.

2519
02:01:26,680 --> 02:01:30,000
Yeah, yeah, chicken and a super salad.

2520
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:33,520
And if you want to pay extra, there's a chocolate cake that the mole people love.

2521
02:01:33,520 --> 02:01:34,520
Mole people are pretty.

2522
02:01:34,520 --> 02:01:35,520
That's generic enough.

2523
02:01:35,520 --> 02:01:36,520
That's public domain enough.

2524
02:01:36,520 --> 02:01:38,400
You can take it in a lot of directions.

2525
02:01:38,400 --> 02:01:39,400
So that's a plus.

2526
02:01:39,400 --> 02:01:44,800
Um, the fame, it was the most famous mole man, the mole man from Fantastic Four.

2527
02:01:44,800 --> 02:01:47,840
Is that what I'm or Hans mole man, I guess.

2528
02:01:47,840 --> 02:01:50,240
Hans mole man, we're the Fantastic Four villain.

2529
02:01:50,240 --> 02:01:54,400
Uh, I'll say this just cause I think it's like a valuable time cause I was trying to

2530
02:01:54,400 --> 02:01:57,760
think of like what's an Avengers one kind of food coming up.

2531
02:01:57,760 --> 02:02:02,600
But then that, that feels a little too, too, you know, forcing it.

2532
02:02:02,600 --> 02:02:07,480
But then I thought like what's a new attraction coming soon that could tie in and that has

2533
02:02:07,480 --> 02:02:12,640
a restaurant like restaurants around it and Universal in Orlando is opening that fast

2534
02:02:12,640 --> 02:02:15,720
and the furious ride soon.

2535
02:02:15,720 --> 02:02:24,840
And uh, if I could sit at the table with the Toretto family, if I could eat a family meal

2536
02:02:24,840 --> 02:02:31,280
with me, familia, family, respect, like when they're eaten on the roof in the last one

2537
02:02:31,280 --> 02:02:37,280
and he's toasting and he's holding his baby and I, if I could sit at the table like with

2538
02:02:37,280 --> 02:02:44,520
Mr Nobody or whatever Kurt Russell's weird name it, if there's like people as the family,

2539
02:02:44,520 --> 02:02:49,840
oh man, that would be, and then at the end you all get the necklaces that I only just

2540
02:02:49,840 --> 02:02:56,200
realizes are our crosses, but they look like a wrenches.

2541
02:02:56,200 --> 02:02:58,760
The wrenches made to look like, Oh wow.

2542
02:02:58,760 --> 02:03:02,760
Crosses I think are the net that cross necklaces he gives to all his members.

2543
02:03:02,760 --> 02:03:07,340
This is a, there's no group of characters in pop culture who value food more perhaps

2544
02:03:07,340 --> 02:03:10,360
other than the Avengers, Avengers and their shawarma.

2545
02:03:10,360 --> 02:03:13,320
But besides that, yeah, I think that that is a perfect time.

2546
02:03:13,320 --> 02:03:14,320
There's always a meal.

2547
02:03:14,320 --> 02:03:17,880
They're always having a barbecue and sitting around drinking beer and it looks like, I

2548
02:03:17,880 --> 02:03:21,760
think this is, can you imagine this is a premium show for one person.

2549
02:03:21,760 --> 02:03:25,640
You have to pay like a thousand dollars and you're the only person there other than the

2550
02:03:25,640 --> 02:03:27,680
family, the performers playing the family.

2551
02:03:27,680 --> 02:03:32,000
Well how about there's a bigger fast and furious show, but beforehand you can eat it like the

2552
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:34,920
chef's table with the, with the group.

2553
02:03:34,920 --> 02:03:35,920
That's good too.

2554
02:03:35,920 --> 02:03:36,920
That sounds good.

2555
02:03:36,920 --> 02:03:39,280
Kind of like a Benihana thing, but the guy playing Vin Diesel.

2556
02:03:39,280 --> 02:03:40,480
Yeah, yeah.

2557
02:03:40,480 --> 02:03:41,480
That's good.

2558
02:03:41,480 --> 02:03:42,480
Super salad.

2559
02:03:42,480 --> 02:03:48,200
What do you like Dom?

2560
02:03:48,200 --> 02:03:49,200
Chocolate cake.

2561
02:03:49,200 --> 02:03:52,080
Now I'll start with that.

2562
02:03:52,080 --> 02:03:56,280
The dressing on the salad's a little much.

2563
02:03:56,280 --> 02:03:59,240
Well, have we, is it time to leave port?

2564
02:03:59,240 --> 02:04:00,240
I think it is.

2565
02:04:00,240 --> 02:04:03,240
Let's head into the, yeah.

2566
02:04:03,240 --> 02:04:08,840
Hey, let's raise a toast to everyone involved at Pirate's Dinner Adventure.

2567
02:04:08,840 --> 02:04:12,720
And hey, if you're going to the Liberty Tavern, make sure you got plenty of time.

2568
02:04:12,720 --> 02:04:13,720
Oh my God, three hours.

2569
02:04:13,720 --> 02:04:14,720
You need at least three hours.

2570
02:04:14,720 --> 02:04:15,720
I need time for just eating your hotel.

2571
02:04:15,720 --> 02:04:16,720
My God.

2572
02:04:16,720 --> 02:04:18,440
I wanted to cram one last thing in.

2573
02:04:18,440 --> 02:04:19,440
I tried.

2574
02:04:19,440 --> 02:04:24,040
And if you're going on the dinosaur ride, be aware that there is a photo opportunity.

2575
02:04:24,040 --> 02:04:26,320
Yeah, and don't be a coward.

2576
02:04:26,320 --> 02:04:28,360
Don't be a lousy coward.

2577
02:04:28,360 --> 02:04:30,360
Ride or die, remember?

2578
02:04:30,360 --> 02:04:31,360
All right.

2579
02:04:31,360 --> 02:04:33,680

No.

2586

Keep the word out.

2587

Oh, no kidding.

2592
02:04:54,040 --> 02:04:55,840
It's over the moon.

2593
02:04:55,840 --> 02:04:56,840
Fantastic.

2594
02:04:56,840 --> 02:04:57,840
Over the moon.

2595
02:04:57,840 --> 02:04:58,840
Yeah, boy.

2596
02:04:58,840 --> 02:04:59,840
Yeah.
