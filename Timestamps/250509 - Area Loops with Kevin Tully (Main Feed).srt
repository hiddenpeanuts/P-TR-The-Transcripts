00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
FOREVER!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
DOG!

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Gentle Warning

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The following podcast

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
may contain soothing

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
melodies and shimmering

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
synths that transport you

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
beyond outer space on

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
the wings of a butterfly.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Today with musician Kevin Tully

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
we take a relaxing

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
journey through the background

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
music that gives theme parks

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
their atmosphere. It's

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Aerial Loops on podcast

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The Ride.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Welcome to podcast The Ride, a podcast which would be a perfect musical area loop for a theme park called Dorkland. I'm Scott Gardner, Genphi, my girl.

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Welcome to Dorkland. To all who come to this loserish place.

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Go fuck yourself.

20
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Jason Sheridan.

21
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
No lies detected

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
on my end.

23
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Great, great.

24
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Dorkland is your land.

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Here age

26
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
recalls, what the hell is all that shit?

27
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
He's phrasing it so weird.

28
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Could we prove the

29
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
dorkiness by how well do we know

30
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
the opening?

31
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Oh right, the plaque or whatever. Not the plaque, but the speech.

32
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Age recalls.

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
It's a nonsense phrase.

34
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I'm not going to be able to recall it.

35
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Age recalls fond memories of the past.

36
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
That's how people talked in the old days.

37
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Here's a question, was Walter

38
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
dork? He has all the trappings

39
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
of a real dork.

40
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Maybe by the standards of the

41
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
fifties.

42
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Being a man

43
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
with a job and a

44
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
parent who has any interests.

45
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
That's true.

46
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
That's something that he enjoys in his life.

47
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
That was the definition of dork.

48
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Other than sleeping or coming.

49
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Other than that,

50
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
you like things.

51
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
It's a problem.

52
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Tons of scotch pouring.

53
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Okay, liquor as well.

54
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I do think he is

55
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
a dork. I don't know, you can have a lot

56
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
of interests. Coming in the door, slamming it.

57
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Yelling behind.

58
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Creating the air

59
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
when you come home from work.

60
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Too angry to talk to.

61
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
So the kids know to keep their distance

62
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
and not go in that room.

63
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Eating some unseasoned food

64
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
while you enjoy a cigarette.

65
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
An unfiltered cigarette.

66
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Ashing and mashed potatoes.

67
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
These are all

68
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
the interests of a well rounded

69
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
fifties man.

70
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I'm just trying to think of what was a

71
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
fifties dork. What do they look like?

72
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Like a

73
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
poindexter, like George McFly.

74
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
So like just standard dork.

75
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
So Walt presented as traditionally

76
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
masculine, but he had secret

77
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
dork tendencies.

78
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
There may be an argument

79
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
to be made that he was the inventor

80
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
of the dork.

81
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
That's a good point.

82
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Whether that means him or that he set up

83
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
so much dorkiness.

84
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Which we are a part of that

85
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
tradition. He's a dork pioneer.

86
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
His interest in trains was just straight up masculine

87
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
at the time. Nothing weird about that.

88
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Now

89
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
it's a little weird.

90
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
But at the time that was just standard for like

91
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
a man of a certain age.

92
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Well if it got a bunch of

93
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
black goo

94
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
all over your face

95
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
and arms, then how could that ever be considered

96
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
dorky? If you were covered in soot after

97
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
dealing with your favorite hobby.

98
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Good to go. Covered in soot

99
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
you can read

100
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
science fiction, like dime store

101
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
novels. But you had to be

102
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
covered in soot to not be

103
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
considered a dork. Oh, if the books

104
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
had a bunch of soot. Yeah, well in your

105
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
face. It's spreading the soot on

106
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
each face that you touch. It's simple at smearing

107
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
some grease paint.

108
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
On your face or your arms. But now

109
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
performatively it has to happen organically.

110
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
It cannot be a performative gesture.

111
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Like you said, you can't smear it on yourself.

112
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
In the act of reading the books

113
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
you have to get covered in soot or some sort

114
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
of crap. Okay.

115
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
You don't agree with me? I'll fight you on this.

116
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Alright. I'm going to argue.

117
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I want to argue. What if it's performative

118
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
but you're enjoying black and white

119
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
scotch and like an unfilled

120
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Chesterfield while you do it?

121
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Okay, that's better. And if you're drinking

122
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
a glass of soot then you're

123
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
yes. Then you're really a proper

124
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
1950's man.

125
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Let's cut to the chase here

126
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
a little bit. Referred to in the opening

127
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
joke. Today's episode

128
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
is about areal loops.

129
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I'm so happy to say this

130
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
phrase. It's been said on the show

131
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
here and there. But to finally have

132
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
it be an

133
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
episode title. To be focused

134
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
on. To be fixated on.

135
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
This I feel like is long

136
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
overdue. Let me give the quick dictionary

137
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
definition at the top

138
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
just so we know what we're talking about. I think this is a

139
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
thing that a hardcore

140
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
theme park dork definitely is

141
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
aware of but for a lay person or a

142
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
slightly less invested person. Areal

143
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
loops are just basically, I mean there's

144
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
so much more than this. But the fundamental

145
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I would say is that it's the background music

146
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
in a particular land or area

147
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
in a theme park. It is the

148
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
musical soundtrack

149
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
to a theme park zone

150
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
that gives it it's auditory flavor

151
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
that sets the genre of what kind of

152
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
place you're in. What kind of

153
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
feeling you should be feeling in

154
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
this zone of a theme park.

155
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
And we're gonna

156
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
focus in on this and talk about

157
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
some of our favorites. Talk about what makes them

158
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
great. And I'm so

159
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
happy that this is coming to us courtesy

160
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
of our guest who is a very

161
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
musically minded person.

162
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
PTR listeners first met him as the

163
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
avatar which helped us transport

164
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Nick Weigert to the CityWalk Orlando

165
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
parking garage. But in real

166
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
life he is no mere blank

167
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
slate avatar just waiting

168
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
for Nick Weigert to fill him

169
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
why he leads a vast

170
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
creative life. Including as the

171
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
lead singer songwriter of a great band called Telethon

172
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
whose new album Suburban Electric

173
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
is available now. He also has

174
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
already performed a hell of a mic drop

175
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
right at the top of the show. He's made PTR

176
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
history because he is the first guest ever

177
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
to bring in his own version

178
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
of the theme song. You have

179
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
already heard this at the top of the show

180
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
so you have heard his work. Now you will hear

181
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
the man himself. Please welcome Kevin Tully.

182
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Hello. It's great

183
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
to be here. What is happening?

184
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I'm so happy to be here.

185
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
It's a pleasure

186
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
to have you particularly because

187
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
there's this phrase that is thrown around

188
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
friend of the show or friend

189
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
of the pod and you have certainly

190
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
become that and more.

191
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
It's been such a pleasure. Thank you.

192
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
For sure. I mean

193
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
from helping us out with a true

194
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
theme park podcast

195
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
pioneering move of

196
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
the Avatar program to

197
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
close out the saga but also just

198
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
like getting to know you just like

199
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
you know via

200
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
DMs and chats through the years

201
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Sending trash to you via text

202
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
message. Well it's

203
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
all I want. It's all I want to happen

204
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
and I'm so glad we have

205
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
that cooking. It's wonderful to share

206
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
be able to share crap with people

207
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
and have select

208
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
people to share

209
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
select crap with. Yes.

210
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
No it's really important

211
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
and you've like I think you've found

212
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
you have this relationship

213
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
certainly I think with Mike and I both

214
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I think you straddle a lot of

215
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Mike and Scott

216
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
interests. That's true yes.

217
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
We the hosts of the show who sometimes

218
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
cannot find common ground in certain

219
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
areas you are able to

220
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
be you cover the common

221
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
you become the common ground

222
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
because you're able to you know

223
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
and friends because now we've you know we've gotten

224
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
to hang out in Orlando a couple of times which has been wonderful

225
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
but you were like you will

226
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
both wander the

227
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
liminal spaces at the

228
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
at the Swan and Dolphin the locked in time

229
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
admire the

230
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
never changing carpet of the Dolphin

231
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Hotel but also

232
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
visit Jelly Rolls with Mike

233
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
and be enthusiastic at Jelly Rolls

234
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
with Mike. Yes and we should say you

235
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
were at Jelly Rolls with us one of the nights

236
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
that I went to Jelly Rolls for this recent trip

237
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
so yes you were doing a

238
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
lot you were doing both things. You will talk

239
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
to Scott about some sort of obscure

240
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I don't know session player but then also you'll

241
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
spend a long time talking to me about

242
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
when will Stephen Page rejoin the

243
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Bare Naked Ladies is it possible

244
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
are we going to have to deal with a

245
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Stephen Page less Bare Naked Ladies

246
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
forever. I think we are sadly

247
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
and I think you're right I think we are sadly

248
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I think we've come down to that

249
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
it seems like he's happy where he's at

250
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I hope that's true

251
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
and Ed is a good natured pilot who

252
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
used to write music we like. And we talk about Ed Robertson

253
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Ed in case you know Ed is the one who

254
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
raps on one week and Stephen was the one who

255
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
was playing and Stephen left the band many years ago

256
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
and Ed is still in the band with

257
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
everybody else. I feel like I always thought the drummer was an

258
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Ed. Is the drummer an Ed? That's Tyler

259
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Okay I've had him mixed up the entire

260
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
time. What's Ed's last name? Robertson

261
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Ed Robertson. Okay

262
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
It's like a game show here. It's like I knew that name

263
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
but I think I always slotted doesn't it I mean it sounds like

264
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
a drummer name a little bit. Ed Robertson

265
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
yeah a little bit. Tyler Stewart is

266
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
the name of the drummer he's the

267
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
silly one I would say as often the

268
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
drummers are. Yes

269
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Would you not say there are multiple silly ones

270
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
in the Bare Naked Ladies? Well

271
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
To some degree

272
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I would say that the ones in the band

273
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
currently are silly and

274
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
the one who has left the band was

275
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
a little bit less silly but still a little silly

276
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
This is a big question I have asked then

277
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I cut to the core with that question

278
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
You both did a

279
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
well like

280
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
This is painful to

281
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
real B&L heads

282
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Like a group mind meld

283
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
We've discussed like are there people

284
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
that go see Bare Naked Ladies that don't even realize Steven's

285
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
not there and I think the answer is yes

286
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
The answer is all touring band this is

287
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
always the case I can speak from

288
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Beach Boys fandom I think there's tons

289
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I think maybe 70%

290
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
of the audience at a Beach Boy at a current

291
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Beach Boys show don't know one

292
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
iota about they don't know who Brian

293
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Wilson is they don't know that

294
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
he's not there they don't know the

295
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
drama that occur they just think

296
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
wow it's them. Who are all of

297
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
those nine men must be the all

298
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
of the guys who sang Surfer Girl

299
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
in 1962

300
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
with no drama or changeover

301
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
And what percentage of those

302
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
people that go to current Beach Boys shows

303
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
are like the pitchfork

304
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
type people who are like Pet Sounds is

305
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
the greatest album of all time and

306
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
it's like like hipsters who appreciate

307
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
the genius

308
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I honestly think it might be

309
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
like a 1%

310
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I think there's an in between percentage

311
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
there has to be to well I'm not in the

312
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
1% because I don't go

313
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
that's the most elite

314
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I've never seen just pure

315
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
we have sorry we have an agreement

316
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
that I think if they're

317
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
still touring in a decade

318
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
as the Mike Love Beach Boys then you

319
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
will go see them I forgot that

320
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I made I don't know when when when did I make that

321
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
was that last year okay so nine

322
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
years we have nine years to go

323
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
until he has to go and

324
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
see them this is like the high

325
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
school or college friends are like if not married

326
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
by 35

327
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
marry each other

328
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
a lot like that yeah

329
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
so yes

330
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
much nerdier and in pursuit of by then

331
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
almost entirely AI

332
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
a 95

333
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
year old man right oh man

334
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
at those shows all the audience is like

335
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
hey does anyone have a lipid

336
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
tour that I can bump

337
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
so yeah Kevin

338
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
yeah we we you like the

339
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
90s crap you like a lot of mainstream

340
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
90s crap absolutely

341
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
and that's where we bond in

342
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
especially yeah that's how we initially

343
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
bonded yeah so

344
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
so it's yeah it's good it's good

345
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
to have somebody to talk about

346
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Adam Durwitz with and Stephen Jenkins

347
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
you keep saying Durwitz

348
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
my saying is wrong? Durwitz

349
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
yeah I knew that even I knew that but it's okay

350
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I do not know wait how many you've never known

351
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
it wasn't Durwitz don't feel embarrassed

352
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Jason?

353
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I feel like you texted it to me and I let

354
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
it slide the other day ah in

355
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
text you think it's text Durwitz too

356
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I'm actually I feel like that's one of those where

357
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
like I knew that was wrong at one

358
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
point and then I forgot because

359
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I said it without even thinking so

360
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
or I just never know it

361
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
even though I watched the full Rick Beato interview with

362
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
him well I should know it

363
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
another name that we used to say wrong

364
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
and I stand by that Rick

365
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Beato is a cool he's a musician he'd be

366
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
named Beato it would make sense and Robertson

367
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
sounds like a drummer's name Rick Beato

368
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
is the ultimate drummer's name Rick Beato is like

369
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
a Star Wars side characters

370
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
name like it would be in the cantina

371
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
and have an action

372
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
and to clarify a George

373
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
named Star Wars

374
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
character a new character would never

375
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
be named Rick Beato but George

376
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
would have named somebody that in 2005

377
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
no problem true

378
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
and you're right to your

379
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
joke Jason I think you need to start

380
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
it's only fair

381
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
that you start I think maybe

382
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
just practice it once asking a very leading

383
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
question of your co-host which is

384
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Adam what?

385
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
this is your chance to have

386
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
this is your chance to have a buka

387
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
a buka to what?

388
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Beppo

389
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
he got it

390
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Mike what is it?

391
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Durrits

392
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
now try it again in four months

393
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
without any prep or we'll see

394
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
if he resets

395
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Beppo got it

396
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Jason I need to find crap to share with you

397
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
now I have crap that I share

398
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
off mike you did share

399
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
something with him

400
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
you were asking if I'd seen Topsy Turvy

401
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
and I was like no I don't know if I've

402
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
seen any Mike Lee movies

403
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
but Topsy Turvy is

404
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
about Gilbert

405
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
and Sullivan

406
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
you were the first person I thought of when I

407
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
watched it

408
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I like this timing because

409
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
there is a

410
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
pirates music

411
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
like a reimagined

412
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Pirates of Penzance

413
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
musical on Broadway

414
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
and you know David Hyde Pierce

415
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
is playing the modern major general

416
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
is he?

417
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I love David Hyde Pierce

418
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I'll tie that into some Nerd to My Have

419
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
which is that like that's crazy

420
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
that he'd be doing that because he

421
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
sang that song during his SNL monologue

422
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
in 1995

423
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
with musical guest live

424
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
that's my guess

425
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
in a certain era I can typically name

426
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
the musical guest

427
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I didn't know that in the front of my mind

428
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
but I knew it in my bones

429
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
if you had to guess

430
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
or if you'd been a writer at the time and you had to write

431
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
a monologue for David Hyde Pierce that may be

432
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
where you would have gone

433
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
now I'm going to be upset if it's not

434
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
David Hyde Pierce and live

435
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I think so

436
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
yeah because I feel like

437
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
it's no the Mulaney pointed out

438
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Patrick Stewart's Salt and Pepper

439
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
but it's

440
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
it's always

441
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
good when you have the like

442
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
the more of the esteemed stage

443
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
actor saying ladies and gentlemen

444
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
live I do remember

445
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
that it is like very very well

446
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
delivered any feelings

447
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
about live either of you

448
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
you know what's the single

449
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
what's the live single

450
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Fire Alone or

451
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Lightning Crashes

452
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I like those fine I never got into it

453
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I'd be willing

454
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
to but I don't have too much

455
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
too many thoughts

456
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I listen to Throwing Copper

457
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
the album that has both of those songs like a lot

458
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
in about

459
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
2014 I don't know

460
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
why I was like

461
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
throwing the album art of that

462
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
album is exceedingly

463
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
ugly it's like really ugly

464
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
no this I gotta see

465
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
it's like a throwing oh my god

466
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
yes that's a great

467
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
it looks like kind of a like a

468
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
like the

469
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
art of a

470
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
actor that would be on a Brown Derby

471
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
type restaurant it looks like somebody was

472
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
trying to do that for Marlon Brando

473
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
and then it went horribly awry

474
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
it looks like AI art

475
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
it really does it really looks like weird AI

476
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
this time yeah yeah

477
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
produced by Jerry Harrison of Talking Heads

478
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
it's a good album it's the precursor

479
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
to like a lot like I think the sound

480
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
of Throwing Copper became

481
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
something really terrible

482
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
that we all like

483
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
you know like butt rock type

484
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
sure sure I think that

485
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
live was the precursor to that

486
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
a little bit but that that live

487
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
album actually holds up pretty

488
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
well transcends that where like your

489
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
your creeds you might say

490
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
kind of like started playing

491
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
in the gutter of this

492
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
perhaps diverging from the path

493
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
the righteous path of

494
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
butt rock and it's yeah so it's not live's fault

495
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
live did not live if

496
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
maybe only accidentally they created

497
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
butt rock yeah that guy had an interesting haircut

498
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
too but I think he's bald now

499
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I thought yeah I thought he just had no hair

500
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
perhaps like a pony like a

501
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
bald with maybe like a ponytail behind

502
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I might be thinking of somebody else oh my god

503
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
wow that's a rare one

504
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
how do you do that

505
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
science shouldn't allow it well that's good though

506
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Gilbert and Sullivan is a tie

507
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
well I feel like in terms of music

508
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I feel like it's either gotta be

509
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
it's like a

510
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
confident female rap that Jane listens

511
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
to and therefore Jason

512
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
so it's either Ice Spice or it's like

513
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Hello My Baby Hello My Ragtime Gal

514
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
it's a song Michigan J

515
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Frog would have sung

516
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
that's the Jason music well and I'm sitting

517
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
over here and I was trying to figure out

518
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
like wait did David

519
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Hyde Pierce sing Gilbert and Sullivan

520
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
the simpsons and I'm like no

521
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Sideshow Bob in the Cape Fear

522
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
episode sings some

523
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
quick hits of the HMAS

524
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
pinafore and then

525
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
David Hyde Pierce is

526
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Sideshow Mel

527
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Sideshow Mel is

528
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
the guy who's always around

529
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Sideshow Cecil

530
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Sideshow Cecil because Frazier

531
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
would have been humming at that point

532
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
did Gilbert and maybe this is

533
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
a spoiler alert for the movie did Gilbert and Sullivan

534
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
ever have a Robertson Page

535
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
style breakup there's a little

536
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
bit of that in the film but do you

537
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
just mean a breakup

538
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
well I mean not specifically to like a

539
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
drug arrest that led to some problems

540
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
and then the band sort of broke up after having

541
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
a children's album a Playhouse Disney cruise

542
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
gone awry

543
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
is that true

544
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
wait no so it is

545
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
applicable hang on what's the story

546
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
here we got a lot to get through but let's do a condensed

547
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
version of the story

548
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I don't think Gilbert and Sullivan had that

549
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
kind of breakup they definitely had TIFs

550
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
and if I'm forgetting a major plot point in the movie

551
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I apologize I've watched a lot of Mike Lee

552
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
movies the past two months so

553
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
there's an arrest

554
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
then they make the children's album

555
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I think they made it before that but then they're

556
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
supposed to go on like a tour and that kind of

557
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
gets derailed because it's kind of weird

558
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
that one of them got arrested blah blah blah

559
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
also don't feel like Stephen wanted to make that

560
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
children's album and

561
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
that's the whole thing then they do

562
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
do their bare naked ladies cruise

563
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
that they had done for a year or two before

564
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
that point

565
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
and this does feel related to Gilbert and Sullivan

566
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
in that big ships are involved

567
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
that's true much like the HMS Pinoff

568
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I believe the last song they

569
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
ever played together outside of the

570
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Canadian Hall of Fame induction is

571
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Call and Answer

572
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
which is a really it's a video I

573
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
watch every few months the final

574
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
performance which is a really

575
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
nice song and then I

576
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
think really the nail in the coffin is a lawsuit

577
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
over the Big Bang Theory theme

578
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
which Stephen feels he didn't

579
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
get the right amount of money for that

580
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
he is on the track

581
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I believe Ed says he wrote it himself

582
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
once that show becomes the biggest

583
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
show of the decade yeah you probably start thinking

584
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
that money no matter what you did on it

585
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
you need to get your residuals from the Big Bang

586
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Theory right yes if there are any to get

587
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
God knows I don't blame him

588
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
which I did I saw

589
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Big Bang Theory

590
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
not Big Bang Theory

591
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Baronade Ladies with my dad and brother

592
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
in Atlantic City in like 2013

593
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
2014 I yelled at you for not knowing

594
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Stephen was not there you were

595
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
very that was when you made that

596
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
KG joke you meant the guy

597
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
you're staring at that was the first

598
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
thing he said was like Stephen's not there

599
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
but the crowd obviously

600
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
first off my brother and I

601
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
were the youngest people in the audience by

602
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
many years and this was a very

603
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
seated concert this

604
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
was not people standing up

605
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
but they like real

606
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
quick transition from one song

607
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
to the next and did the Big Bang

608
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Theory theme and the crowd

609
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
went nuts yeah of course yeah so

610
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
anyway they're playing I have

611
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
much like you have not seen the Ed Robertson

612
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Baronade Ladies yeah you get it

613
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
all right all in 10 years there's a chance

614
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I will see it next month

615
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
though at the Greek Theater

616
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Fastball or Guster

617
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
opening for that one both of them I think

618
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
both?

619
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
goodness me

620
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
you're going to have to get back out here

621
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
really excited

622
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
that line up really excited my mother

623
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Mike is

624
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
reclaiming the phrase get him

625
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
to the Greek to be about him

626
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
going to see the Ed Robertson

627
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Baronade Ladies

628
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
and get them

629
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
him and his mom

630
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
that's sweet

631
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
in a reasonable amount of time

632
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
minus the extremely cursed

633
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
stars of the film

634
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
of the actual movie I shouldn't say

635
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
cursed that implies that they got

636
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
hit by a curse that caused what's

637
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
happening to them I think it was more

638
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
their decision making than a

639
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
curse but who knows I

640
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
don't know what happened I don't know what magic

641
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
amulets they're into

642
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
by curse you mean the power of Christ

643
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
oh you did bring us amulets

644
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
that's right you brought us

645
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
you're probably going to have some amulet talk today

646
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I feel like some of these

647
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
composers definitely wear some big

648
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
amulets either own them or

649
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
are interested in them or inspired by

650
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
the idea of them but

651
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I don't think possess any of the

652
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
toxic qualities of

653
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
musicians Diddy or Aldous Snow

654
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
we all

655
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
know as the star of

656
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
get him to the Greek

657
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
let's start heading into the

658
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
music loops direction and I'm

659
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
so glad you suggested this

660
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Kevin

661
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
you know you obviously

662
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
being a musician yourself as evidence

663
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
to thank you for that

664
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
you played us this before we started recording

665
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
that is a brand new this is a new

666
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
dimension to coming on the show putting

667
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
your own stamp on it and I love

668
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
that theme it's amazing what two

669
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
hours to kill at your Burbank

670
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Airbnb will do

671
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
for your productivity that's

672
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
a magical piece for being two

673
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
hours happy to do it speaks to your

674
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
talents but we were

675
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
I feel like we were talking about a lot of things

676
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
and we landed here and it did seem

677
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
like like the thing to do

678
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
maybe just a tiny bit more I mean I

679
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
think it's not like the headiest

680
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
concept but I do like that we're doing

681
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
kind of like an overview of area loops

682
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
before because what this does now is

683
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
free us up to maybe do an entire

684
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
episode about this loop oh yeah

685
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
or we do full we do a commentary

686
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
this might work for commentary

687
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
we could just play the music and talk

688
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
over it as opposed to a commentary

689
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
something where you need a video but basically

690
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
you know it's the background

691
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
music to a you know a land

692
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
or the entire

693
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
park or even an entrance plaza

694
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
or a hotel

695
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
or even a shuttle or a

696
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
bus it's just you know it's the background

697
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
music that plays in a theme park area

698
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
it's I feel like typically

699
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
they're around an hour

700
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
long and they just loop all day the

701
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
rest of the day although not always as

702
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
we've seen with recent

703
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
theme park fair

704
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
but it's really become this big area I feel

705
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
like in the YouTube era

706
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
because there are channels that allow you to

707
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
you know to check these out and archive

708
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
them there's hundreds and hundreds of these on

709
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
YouTube and we can we'll talk about them and

710
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
play some of them

711
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
but was there any particular

712
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
reason or philosophy why why have all the

713
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
topics to talk to us about why this

714
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
and not the reasons for the Bear

715
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Naked Ladies demise?

716
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Well it is

717
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
something that I feel

718
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
the area loops I believe are sort of

719
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
inside me at a well

720
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
at a deep level

721
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
it's my

722
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
blood and loins

723
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
no like ever since

724
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
I was a very

725
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
small boy like

726
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
nerding out on the internet

727
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
about Disney World

728
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
like these have loomed

729
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
really large and soundtracked

730
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
you know

731
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
much of my life

732
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
like and it used to be very hard to get

733
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
them

734
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
and now we're living in a golden

735
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
age of

736
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
YouTube availability

737
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
for these things. It's so insane

738
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
the importance that used to be placed

739
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
on a soundtrack

740
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
album that Disney would put out like

741
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
oh my god they did a 25th anniversary

742
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
of Disney World album

743
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
which means I can finally listen to

744
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
this track this track

745
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
whatever you know this Epcot

746
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
music the music from

747
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
you know Big Thunder

748
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
The Line whatever it is

749
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
and you were just waiting on those

750
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
morsels and I remember being a kid

751
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
thinking like if only there was a way now that we can

752
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
burn CDs why isn't

753
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
there like a way you can just go burn a CD

754
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
in the parks of any of the music

755
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
that I would want and now it's like

756
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
this is like more than

757
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
available to us for free

758
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
do you remember the kiosks where you

759
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
could burn CDs? Okay

760
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
as I was saying it I was thinking

761
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
am I not pulling this from whole cloth but rather

762
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
faintly recalling that there was

763
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
a thing of this nature. They were kiosks

764
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
whoa. Where?

765
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
I didn't know this. You know how they have

766
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
like the art of Disney kiosks in various

767
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
stores where you can like pick

768
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
a painting

769
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
and it will print for

770
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
you in any size. Is it Disneyana

771
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
in Disneyland?

772
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
When you first go in on the right. Yeah

773
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
yeah and that's where they have like statues and stuff

774
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
but then they also have a kiosk where you can basically like

775
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
order a print. Posters on demand.

776
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Yep exactly but they had

777
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
that I don't know exactly where they were but

778
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
they were kiosks

779
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
in various stores just

780
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
like that where you could hand select

781
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
tracks and the funny

782
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
thing is I

783
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
impossibly have not impossibly

784
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
very possible through the power of

785
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
BitTorrent but I have every

786
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
file that was ever available

787
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
on a folder

788
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
and there's some obscure stuff on there.

789
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Really? Stuff that is like beyond

790
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
what these YouTubers might find

791
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
and post? 100% it's like not and that

792
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
stuff's not really on there. Like

793
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
the stuff that we would want

794
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
probably is like a lot of it is not on there

795
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
but if you want like a

796
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
clip of

797
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
you know Ben Franklin and

798
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
the American Venture like

799
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
being like I assure you these

800
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
glasses are not rose colored like

801
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
you can get that sound bite

802
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
on a CD. Of course I do.

803
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
It's the least hamfisted

804
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
jamming of a fact into dialogue

805
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
I've ever heard. Send that to

806
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Jason Kevin that's what you're in

807
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
with him is. I'll send you the file. The folder.

808
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
I knew about the kiosk

809
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
a few

810
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
I learned about them a few years ago I never

811
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
saw them. I do

812
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
remember pulling stuff

813
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
on

814
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
my tunes in like local

815
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
college dorm networks

816
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
and I would like

817
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
flip out if there was theme park

818
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
stuff but I remember being

819
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Would you find theme park music in the

820
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
dorms? Yeah every well cause you

821
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
could see everyone's

822
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
audio

823
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
collections. Did you

824
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
not like just go straight to that

825
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
try to find the name go straight to their door

826
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
and if a woman asked to marry

827
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
them. Okay there

828
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
was I was at

829
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
a friend's dorm once

830
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
and it was just a bunch of us hanging

831
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
out and we were we were all fiddling

832
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
with that and looking at it cause not everyone

833
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
knew like there was a new version of it out

834
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
and there was one with

835
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
like tons of theme park stuff

836
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
and I was like trying to explain

837
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
to her I was like can you download

838
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
this stuff and burn it to CDs

839
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
for me? And the reaction was pretty

840
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
much no.

841
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Oh so rather the opposite

842
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
this became a wedge between you

843
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
and another as much of our theme park

844
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
fandom all was before meeting each other

845
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
before the vast wave of

846
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
theme park fandom that has grown

847
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
over the year now that we all together

848
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
live in dork land. I think this

849
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
is a particularly like

850
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
topic for the real theme park

851
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
heads to like

852
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
I don't really get

853
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
excited about hearing

854
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
it's a small world or something

855
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
like the songs from the

856
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
park. Do you know what I mean?

857
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
I don't mind them but I don't listen

858
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
to those almost every

859
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
you know couple times a week.

860
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
It's more

861
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
and not without giving away

862
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
some of what we want to talk about it is more

863
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
like okay there was this

864
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
track with just this odd

865
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
bubbly like

866
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
some bubbly synth

867
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
that was kind of like

868
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
a little bit cheesy and embarrassing but

869
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
like really did it for me when I was a kid

870
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
and it was probably like

871
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
track four of ten in the

872
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
queue of horizons or whatever.

873
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
That sort of thing. That's always

874
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
what we're after.

875
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
And some of the YouTube

876
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
loops

877
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
people have had to reconstruct

878
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
stuff or then some of the

879
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
stuff you're listening to and you're like

880
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
I think this is source audio

881
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
how did they get this?

882
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
That's a big question I have.

883
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Where did these all come from?

884
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
How is there so much of this on YouTube?

885
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
You gotta stick a microphone

886
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
in a bush or go into like the

887
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
bathroom and

888
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
You think that's what happened?

889
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
No I mean I know

890
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
that the speakers in the bush and

891
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
the speakers in the bathroom are like great

892
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
great ways to

893
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
mainline the

894
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
loops.

895
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
The last time we were in Orlando

896
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
I was like okay there's

897
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
original audio

898
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
in the port of entry restrooms

899
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
by Seuss Landing.

900
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
And I went in there to

901
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
use the bathroom and

902
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
I just heard what I thought

903
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
was an argument.

904
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
And I came out and I looked around

905
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
and no one was in there and I realized

906
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
like this is source

907
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
this is

908
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
original audio of

909
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
people arguing

910
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
but I didn't want to be a creep just

911
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
recording with my phone

912
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
like in a bathroom.

913
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
What was the argument about?

914
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Wouldn't it have been like a

915
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
very charactery type of argument?

916
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
It was charactery and I thought

917
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Like you will not be

918
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
voyaging today? What are you doing you crazy woman?

919
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
It is, it was

920
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
something like that and I was like

921
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
what is going on out there?

922
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
The seas are much too rough today.

923
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
That's why I shall use my flying machine

924
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
you see? Whether or not you believe it is

925
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
possible. Jason's like oh this couple's really having

926
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
a hard time getting along today. It started

927
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
innocuous and I thought

928
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
it was two people arguing and then I came out

929
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
and no one was in there and I didn't

930
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
want to just, I didn't know how long

931
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
it was but I

932
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
have not been able to find, listener

933
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
if you know what I'm talking about. The islands

934
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
of adventure port of entry

935
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
specifically the Seuss Landing side

936
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
confisco grill

937
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
and Seuss Landing I don't know if it's

938
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
the residents of port of entry or the

939
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
imaginary

940
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
cooks at confisco grill

941
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
arguing. Oh could be.

942
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
It could be a

943
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
soundtrack that is character

944
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
cooks from a restaurant

945
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
and that's something they made and pumped into

946
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
the bathroom. Is confisco a guy?

947
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Well I assume confisco is

948
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
the little statue, the deformed

949
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
man that's outside of

950
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
confisco grill. I always assume that

951
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
was confisco himself. I think so

952
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
and then you get a lot, you

953
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
this is you are a perfect guest for the show

954
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
the fact that you were referring to the little statue

955
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
of confisco. He has an oblong head. Something that has

956
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
stumped me, Jason is all

957
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
and again this is what you guys text about is

958
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
the ins and outs, every statue

959
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
port of entry. Well there's lots of good statues

960
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
there's the J. Jonah, Jameson

961
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
statue in the extended queue

962
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
for Spider-Man which I think they really

963
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
use these days. Dr. Doom's

964
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
throne, right?

965
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Yes, his empty throne.

966
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
I can't, what you have described is so obscure

967
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
I cannot find a photo of it. Look up

968
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
confisco grill entrance.

969
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
We gotta find this oblong

970
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
head man. Entrance. A lot

971
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
of the

972
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
confisco grill pictures outside

973
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
of it were, used to be that

974
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
giant Seagram's mural that is

975
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
gone now. Wait I see it

976
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
now, okay. There is a guy, it's like

977
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
a, alright he's like bending in an odd

978
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
way. Can I see? His, I

979
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
think. Can you turn that toward me? Well it's

980
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
one of a zillion photos on a big old

981
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
something called TheStylishFoodie.com

982
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Yeah, that

983
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
looks like, that looks like the guy. Does he not

984
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
have an oblong head? This guy?

985
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Is he holding up a menu?

986
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Yeah, and he has a

987
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
nose that I don't care for.

988
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
And does he get along with his wife?

989
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
That's my question. Does he yell at

990
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
his wife a lot? Yeah. Cause maybe

991
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
that's what you were hearing in the bathroom. He's got too

992
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
sweet of a smile, he can't be the fighter.

993
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Those are always the worst. Oh that's

994
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
true. A smile, right?

995
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Big phonies. The same, yeah yeah.

996
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Okay, but let's start

997
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
let's start digging in

998
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
a little bit. And this is, yeah, I know that

999
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
this is a big area for you and I get, and I,

1000
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
it's seemingly an influence on you

1001
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
as a musician. I imagine

1002
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
like, do you listen to these things

1003
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
when you're like, just working

1004
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
out and about trying to be inspired?

1005
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Yeah, I

1006
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
do. I mean, especially with

1007
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
so like, for the band

1008
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
stuff, Telethon, like that's

1009
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
more power pop, I find inspiration

1010
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
listening to

1011
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
power pop records. Sure. But

1012
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
for a long time, the area loops were good

1013
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
because they didn't remind me of anything

1014
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
that I would ever be able to create. They're

1015
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
like weird, they don't have the same

1016
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
sensibilities melodically

1017
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
as I like think in.

1018
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
So for people who haven't heard your band, it's not

1019
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
particularly the sound, it's not

1020
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
the sound isn't reminiscent of

1021
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
a banjo instrumental of the Davy

1022
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Crockett song. No, or like new

1023
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
age music, like our ambient type

1024
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
music, like

1025
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
the music

1026
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
I make is much more, I don't

1027
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
know, it's more structured and

1028
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
we don't find it

1029
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
comfortable to stay in one musical

1030
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
place for like a long time and like

1031
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
be meditative or whatever, like we don't do

1032
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
that at all, we're moving from place to

1033
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
place to place, so listening to new age

1034
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
music, as you might find on

1035
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
these area loops,

1036
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
not all of them, but many

1037
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
of them, like was always kind of nice

1038
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
for me to listen

1039
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
to music that doesn't remind me of anything I'd

1040
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
make. Now, I have

1041
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
dabbled a little bit in making more

1042
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
instrumental new age music recently.

1043
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
As you did in the show, yes. Yeah, yeah.

1044
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
And there's like a project I sort of

1045
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
have cooking up that may never get finished, but

1046
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
yeah, I'm kind of trying to do that

1047
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
with recreated synths from the

1048
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
80s and stuff, but

1049
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
I don't want to spill

1050
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
the secrets of your unfinished project, but you have

1051
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
described this as like that you're trying to do

1052
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
music for an imaginary Epcot

1053
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
pavilion. That's right, yeah, I've been

1054
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
privately, quietly

1055
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
working on that since

1056
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Thanksgiving

1057
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
last year, and

1058
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
I don't know, again, I don't know if it will ever get finished,

1059
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
but you heard it here first, yeah,

1060
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
I'm kind of trying to make like a sweet

1061
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
spot, like 19 minute

1062
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
movement of instrumental

1063
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
synth music, and I looked up like the

1064
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
synths that all the people on

1065
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
some loops we'll probably be talking about soon

1066
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
were using, and that

1067
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
they used on those albums, and I downloaded

1068
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
like the official recreations of them,

1069
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
and I've been just sort of messing around.

1070
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
So like that thing I created for

1071
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
this, that was in the

1072
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
tone palette of those

1073
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
recreated

1074
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
synths. An actual old school, because that

1075
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
was extremely, as we'll get into, and we

1076
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
bonded over this style, but it's very like

1077
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Epcot of that era, Tomorrowland

1078
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
of that era, and it's

1079
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
one of the, we've discussed kind of the like

1080
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
chicken or the egg

1081
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
of it all, like do we love

1082
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
this kind of music

1083
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
because we grew up going to theme

1084
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
parks, or

1085
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
is it like an inverse

1086
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
we, like we love that kind

1087
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
of music, and then it's like, it just deepens our theme

1088
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
park appreciation that that kind of music

1089
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
was around, it gives us like a new wave of

1090
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
theme park fandom, or is it really

1091
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
like, the, you heard this

1092
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
song when you were eight years old,

1093
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
and so it's drilled, and it affected your

1094
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
music taste forever

1095
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
in a way that's permanent. You never really know,

1096
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
you never fully know. You can't know.

1097
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
It's certainly part of it. Yeah, yeah. It's gotta

1098
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
be part of it. It's gotta be. And I for sure

1099
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
have like responded to pieces

1100
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
of music because I'm like, that

1101
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
feels like something that would have played at Epcot.

1102
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Yeah, yes, of course.

1103
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Yeah, yeah. It happens.

1104
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Yeah, I think, I think probably the

1105
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
average person that goes to these places don't

1106
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
realize how much that is

1107
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
I mean, they don't notice a

1108
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
lot of it, just like how much it's

1109
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
actually adding to the mood of it.

1110
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Just because, I mean, some of the

1111
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
stuff I'm gonna play probably is more like

1112
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
a real, like a traditional song

1113
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
that's three minutes or whatever, but still

1114
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
some of it, very background music-ish.

1115
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
And if it wasn't playing, or if

1116
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
it was a different song, it would really change.

1117
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Like we were at Universal

1118
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
a couple days ago, and instead of like

1119
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
the big soaring Universal theme as you walk in,

1120
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
they're playing like three Billy Joel songs.

1121
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
It does change the vibe. That drives me

1122
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
nuts. Billy Joel specifically or just

1123
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
rock and pop songs

1124
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
at the park? I think music with words

1125
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
in general at theme park

1126
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
like as background music in theme parks kind of

1127
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
bugs me. There's a part,

1128
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
there's a section of Universal Studios

1129
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Florida that play, I know that

1130
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
one of the songs on it is Pinch Me

1131
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
by the Barenaked Ladies. And although I like

1132
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
that song, I'm like, what is this doing

1133
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
for the place making of the

1134
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
park? It bothers me. And it's distracting.

1135
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
And I think the best

1136
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
theme park area loops and background

1137
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
music is

1138
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
contributing to the theme, but it is not

1139
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
distracting. Yeah. That is a really

1140
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
good point. Yeah, yeah. If it's

1141
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
attracting your attention too much, or the

1142
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
regular person's attention too much,

1143
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
then it's not just, you know, it should be

1144
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
similar to just like the details

1145
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
on the awnings.

1146
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Like the aging

1147
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
of an old building or the paint of a new building.

1148
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
I was kind of going back

1149
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
and forth on that

1150
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
because I looked up

1151
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
just in case there was any crossover,

1152
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
I picked some alternates.

1153
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
So I was looking up Hollywood Studios

1154
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
music. And it's a lot of

1155
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
instrumentals when you first enter,

1156
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
but the loop I found

1157
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
for specifically Sunset

1158
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Boulevard, which is the path,

1159
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
the road leading to

1160
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Tower of Terror, is like

1161
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
all, like, old

1162
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
song standard, like

1163
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Andrew Sisters and stuff, standards.

1164
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
I know they play Mersey Doats

1165
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
on that loop, like Mersey Doats

1166
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
and Dozy Doats. Sure I am, Dozy Davy.

1167
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
He's spinning that thing, that thing

1168
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
constantly. Yeah, number

1169
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
seven Spotify rep, yeah. But I can't remember

1170
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
if they have, so you heard words though.

1171
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Yeah. Well, that's

1172
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
we were joking about, Begin the Begin

1173
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
earlier. Oh, right. And I

1174
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
forget which, it's a song that's been

1175
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
sung, performed by a

1176
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
million people, to

1177
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
even, I forget whether

1178
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
it was Julio Iglesias or Enrique

1179
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Iglesias, that version, more

1180
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
more recently than

1181
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
World War II, I mean.

1182
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
The broad

1183
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
strokes, the definition of recent.

1184
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
By the way,

1185
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
just the phrase, we were laughing about

1186
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Begin the Beguine.

1187
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
That's something that Frazier and Niles would do.

1188
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Yeah, not to be too on the nose, but

1189
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
I was talking about

1190
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
what a fit of laughter we got into that day.

1191
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Begin the Beguine and Gilbert

1192
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Sullivan beforehand.

1193
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Well this is, I think what makes this

1194
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
a very good topic

1195
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
for us, for Podcast The Right

1196
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
also, is how much it appeals to everybody's

1197
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
specific niches

1198
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
and interests, because like

1199
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
within the three of us, the hosts, there's very

1200
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
like, extremely

1201
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
divergent musical taste,

1202
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
but there is a place for all of us

1203
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
within the world

1204
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
of theme park area music.

1205
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Absolutely.

1206
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
So, I guess I'll go ahead

1207
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
here, I just have a couple things, I have

1208
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
a little bit of a platter, a sample

1209
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
or a platter of things.

1210
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
We've all picked

1211
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
one to focus on, one

1212
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
that's always spoken to us.

1213
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
One has turned into three.

1214
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
So the premise was to do

1215
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
something, then Mike broke the rules.

1216
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
I had one again before, so

1217
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
it's all out of control already.

1218
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
This is going to become a Steven and Ed thing

1219
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
real fast.

1220
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
How long did the Bannock Ladies last together

1221
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
as a band? 15 years? 20 years?

1222
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Probably.

1223
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
We've got a couple more years to go.

1224
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
So, yeah,

1225
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
so some are like,

1226
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
some of these things I have here are like

1227
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
what we're describing in the background, but then one

1228
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
that I really like is more of a loop of

1229
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
like rock and roll,

1230
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
I'll say that, with lyrics and whatever,

1231
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
but it really is a place for all of us,

1232
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
whether you like rock and roll music

1233
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
or you like rock and roll,

1234
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
you have a place

1235
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
in the Disney parks. Yours, though,

1236
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
have lyrics, but make sense

1237
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
in the placement of like,

1238
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
a nod to mid

1239
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
20th century.

1240
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
I think this is really up to the individual.

1241
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Do you want

1242
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
songs with lyrics? Do you want

1243
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
popular songs? Is it distracting to your

1244
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
audience to listen to popular songs?

1245
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
I feel like, and then sometimes

1246
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
I feel like the majority

1247
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
of these are instrumental,

1248
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
but that doesn't mean they're always specifically composed

1249
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
for the area, although some are,

1250
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
and this is a big thing that's kind of trumpeted

1251
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
when a new area opens, like the heat

1252
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
is on, new, you know, because

1253
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
in Galaxy's Edge you got new

1254
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
area music by John fucking

1255
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Williams, and then in Epic

1256
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Universe the music is a huge

1257
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
deal, I mean, so much music was made for

1258
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
that. I have thoughts about that.

1259
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Good stuff.

1260
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Okay, okay.

1261
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Let's hear a little bit of Mike, and then let's,

1262
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
because you've, like, well, we've been,

1263
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
and now you've been, so yeah,

1264
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
we should talk about, you know, the present

1265
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
and future of area loop music

1266
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
shown throughout the universe. I have thoughts, yep.

1267
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Great, great. We'll talk about it.

1268
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
But Mike, where are you taking us?

1269
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
What area are we looping to?

1270
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Toontown. I know what we're

1271
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
listening to.

1272
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Wow, we've got a

1273
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
cool, we've got a refreshed instrumental

1274
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
eye-to-eye goofy movie, eye-to-eye.

1275
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
I haven't heard this. Is this just

1276
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
playing generally in Toontown? Yes. Okay.

1277
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Wow. So yeah, it's just,

1278
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
there's a loungy eye-to-eye.

1279
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
You can keep playing. You gotta get

1280
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
into the chorus. Let's play and talk.

1281
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Sure, let's play and talk.

1282
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
Wait for, wait for

1283
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
the chorus here.

1284
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
This is nice.

1285
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
What, like, pop-wise does this remind

1286
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
me of? That's what I was trying to

1287
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
figure out, because this is one of my

1288
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
favorites, too, and it is an example of a new

1289
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
area loop that I think is

1290
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
really phenomenal. Yes.

1291
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Yeah, we are not, and you particularly are

1292
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
not, like, only the old ones are

1293
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
good. I think that

1294
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
there is an area I gravitate towards,

1295
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
but I'm open to, I want new

1296
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
ones to be good, and I think this Toontown

1297
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
one, I mean, I noticed it last year when I

1298
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
went into Toontown to ride

1299
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Runaway Railway, and

1300
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
I instantly was like, this is a

1301
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
new loop I've never heard before, and I found it on

1302
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
YouTube, and I listen to it all the time.

1303
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
It's so breezy,

1304
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
but I don't know what genre it is.

1305
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
I said loungy, but

1306
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
it's kind of fully, like, lounge,

1307
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
I don't know, but it is, like,

1308
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
laid back to it. It's like a hard tip of my tongue that is

1309
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
not coming, but, like, if you put vocals

1310
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
on that. It's very breezy,

1311
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
very happy, and they

1312
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
picked good songs, like Chippendale,

1313
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Rescue Rangers is on there, Eye to Eye.

1314
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
There's Mickey Mouse Club, and then there's

1315
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
a couple from the Mickey Mouse Clubhouse,

1316
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
which are, they might be

1317
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Giants songs. Hot Dog,

1318
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
and the Mickey Mouse Clubhouse theme.

1319
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Which many parents know, but I don't.

1320
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Yes, I know it now.

1321
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
The show's been on in the house lately, but I didn't know there

1322
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
might be Giants.

1323
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Well, because they composed the theme

1324
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
song to The Daily Show, right?

1325
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
I wish that was on

1326
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Did they?

1327
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
Or did they do a version of it?

1328
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
I don't know.

1329
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
That's because I thought, for a long time,

1330
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
I thought they did Big Bang Theory.

1331
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Oh my god, Jason, you never said that to me.

1332
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
I know, I know.

1333
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
I would have smacked you in the face.

1334
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
That's some common, like,

1335
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
goofy music crossover,

1336
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Barenaked Ladies, TMBG.

1337
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
TMBG, I think was The Daily Show and Malcolm in the Middle.

1338
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Right? Yes.

1339
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
They did Malcolm in the Middle, I know that.

1340
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
They may have done a new version of it at some point.

1341
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
It's by Bob Mould.

1342
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Oh, right.

1343
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
I don't even want to attempt.

1344
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
Is it Husker Dew or is it Hoosker Dew?

1345
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
It's a Hoosker?

1346
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
Hoosker Dew, I think.

1347
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Sugar, he's in the band Sugar, which is a really good band.

1348
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Wait, but TMBG

1349
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
wasn't involved with The Daily Show at all?

1350
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Not the original, but I think they may have done a version.

1351
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
And then, of course, the Timbaland

1352
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
remix that accompanied the show

1353
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
in the later 20 cents.

1354
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Right.

1355
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
Something I noticed about this Toontown loop is like

1356
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
I think there's

1357
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
certain bands do this really well.

1358
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
When you get to be a very virtuosic musician,

1359
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
you start filling in the spaces around

1360
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
the melodies with

1361
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
spicing things up and adding

1362
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
flair. And you can only do

1363
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
that really when you're really feeling the groove.

1364
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
And Steely Dan was great at doing this.

1365
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
I think My Beloved Fish is really good

1366
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
at doing this. And whoever is playing

1367
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
on this Toontown loop, like every little

1368
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
thing that your ears want to

1369
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
hear ends up

1370
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
happening or they end up plussing it up

1371
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
and doing something exciting with it.

1372
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
Sort of filling in all available

1373
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
space. Do we have any idea who did it?

1374
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Oh, you do, okay.

1375
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Michael Rubino. The Toontown tuners.

1376
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
Well, that's what I was going to ask. I researched

1377
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
this. This is on Spotify

1378
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
as they uploaded.

1379
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
This is a rare area loop that's been uploaded

1380
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
as an album to Spotify.

1381
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
And by the Toontown

1382
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
tuners. But the

1383
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
composer of it, I looked this up, was Michael

1384
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Rubino. He was just a

1385
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
hardworking film and TV

1386
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
and video game composer.

1387
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
But how

1388
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
would you feel if you assembled this great

1389
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
ensemble? It

1390
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
seems like it's a small ensemble

1391
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
of musicians.

1392
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
And these are probably people that need jobs

1393
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
and need work. And this is a really good thing to put

1394
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
on our portfolio, but it's just credited

1395
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
only as the Toontown tuners.

1396
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
There's no names attached.

1397
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
It's probably something he's all

1398
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
too familiar with. Right. I'd assume

1399
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
working in all of these different areas.

1400
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Yes, yeah, yeah.

1401
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
I'm not saying that makes it right.

1402
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Covered credits, yeah, yeah.

1403
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
If you're listening and you're a Toontown

1404
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
tuner, great job. Because yeah, everything

1405
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
instrumentally going on there is great.

1406
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Yes, and I mentioned this before on the show, and I

1407
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
don't know if this is available.

1408
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
But if you go back, and I spent a lot of

1409
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
time in Toontown recently, I do believe

1410
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
this music is part of a really

1411
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
nice reinvigoration of

1412
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Toontown in addition to the new

1413
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
ride that's there. Obviously, I also have a child

1414
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
that likes to be there now, so I'm in Toontown

1415
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
way more than I ever was.

1416
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
But there's a cool thing that happens

1417
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
is if you go into the back by the caves,

1418
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
there's even like quieter

1419
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
versions of all the songs playing

1420
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
in Toontown. That's fascinating.

1421
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
I'll check tomorrow. And explain,

1422
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
oh yes, please do.

1423
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Give us the report. But like,

1424
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
it's not just quieter

1425
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
volume. It's a rearrange. That's

1426
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
interesting. What does that mean? Like less

1427
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
instruments? Lullaby? Kind of more

1428
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
of a lullaby-ish thing.

1429
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
So you can go, if you're sitting, because there's benches under

1430
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
in the caves, it's a really nice

1431
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
place to chill out, kids or no kids.

1432
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
There'll be some kids running around back there, but like

1433
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
it's completely out of the sun.

1434
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
And there's like really like

1435
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
quiet versions. So you walk from

1436
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
wherever in the cave and walk out into

1437
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
the main Toontown, and then you hear like this version

1438
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
now playing. You keep saying cave.

1439
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
What cave? It's like a

1440
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
fake rocks.

1441
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
Toontown has a cave now. In the back of

1442
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Toontown, there's a cave.

1443
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
It's what used to be the

1444
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
Chippendale slide. It's like all the way in

1445
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
the corner. It's the full corner of

1446
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Disneyland. There's fake grass

1447
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
back there. The kids love it.

1448
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
There's fake rocks. And then there is like a bunch

1449
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
of fake rocks that kind of, I mean it's not

1450
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
a cave that you can crawl into it, but it's a bunch

1451
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
of fake rocks. And then there's a bunch of benches

1452
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
in the back there. And you can completely get out of the sun

1453
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
and chill out for a second.

1454
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
It's still loud, but

1455
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
it's different arrangements of these songs.

1456
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
And it's a very neat little thing.

1457
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
That's beautiful. That's beautiful stuff.

1458
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
And there have been area loops

1459
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
that came out in the past couple years

1460
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
that I have been less than happy

1461
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
about, but there are a couple that have

1462
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
been really good. And I'm encouraged

1463
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
to see that one of the most recent additions to

1464
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Disneyland has a great loop like this.

1465
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
If you had to say

1466
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
something that you don't like, and

1467
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
you don't have to put a piece

1468
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
of music on blast if you don't want to,

1469
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
but could you describe,

1470
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
because it doesn't seem like there's a lot of

1471
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
areas in which these

1472
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
can go wrong, but clearly they do.

1473
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
What is in here? What

1474
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
do we think makes a bad area loop?

1475
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
Besides it just being like a bunch of

1476
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
hits from 18

1477
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
years ago. Although Mike might be into that

1478
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
though too.

1479
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
We're walking through Magic Mountain and then like,

1480
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
oh, Bruno Mars.

1481
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
13 year old Bruno Mars song.

1482
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
Eve 6. Late period

1483
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Eve 6.

1484
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
18 is longer than that.

1485
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Can you conjure any specifics

1486
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
of what makes a disappointing area loop?

1487
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
So I

1488
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
think, and I don't

1489
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
mean to put this on blast, but

1490
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
world discovery,

1491
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Epcot,

1492
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
all of the stuff that used to be future world,

1493
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
they made this big deal about this

1494
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
composer named I think

1495
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
Pinar Toprak.

1496
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
I don't know how to pronounce it.

1497
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
But she composed this

1498
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
new loop for that area.

1499
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
And I went day

1500
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
one to hear it. And I

1501
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
was so excited. I was like, you got big

1502
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
shoes to fill, Pinar.

1503
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
Which we'll probably talk about later.

1504
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
But as I got there,

1505
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
it's very

1506
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
beautiful. The music is very

1507
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
very beautiful and pleasant to listen to.

1508
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
But there's no

1509
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
it took me a while

1510
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
and I finally found a melody that I can kind of

1511
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
cling to, but I couldn't sing it to you right now.

1512
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
And that drives me a little bit

1513
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
crazy because there's a recurring melody

1514
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
in this like Epcot, this new Epcot

1515
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
loop. And

1516
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
when you're hearing it over and over again, you're like, oh yes,

1517
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
that's the melody

1518
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
is this soaring, beautiful, very

1519
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
no complaints about it. But

1520
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
like I can, it's not memorable.

1521
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
And I think that there are

1522
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
I think that a singable

1523
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
I think about a lot about singable

1524
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
solos and like singable

1525
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
singable instrumentals

1526
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
like you should be able to

1527
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
remember the melody and be

1528
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
able to sing it. Yes. As an

1529
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
aficionado of 70s, 80s jazz, which we

1530
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
touched on here. I can't remember

1531
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
what the name is or it'll come up in a mix

1532
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
and I don't even remember who the artist is.

1533
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
But if I can

1534
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
like do the basic melody that

1535
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
at least is the starting point, that's something.

1536
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
If it's just pure noodle,

1537
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
then like it's probably not going to stick with you. It's kind of true of

1538
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
film scores too.

1539
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
Is that at the very

1540
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
entrance of Epcot?

1541
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
It plays all throughout

1542
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
what used to be Future World as far as I

1543
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
can tell. Like where Walt's sitting on the

1544
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
stoop. Yeah. I feel like people

1545
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
were kind of mixed

1546
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
on that when it debuted.

1547
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
Yeah. I feel like

1548
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
and maybe they were like

1549
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
pulling it back or like they put in

1550
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
classic stuff or mixed it up

1551
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
or... Every time I've been there

1552
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
recently, it's been playing.

1553
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
And I've gotten used to it. It just

1554
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
it's generically beautiful.

1555
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
Whereas I think that the music

1556
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
that was there before had some

1557
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
serious character.

1558
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
Yes. Instantly memorable.

1559
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
I think that'll come up for both of us.

1560
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Where I might admit, this is a little

1561
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
goofy. What you're

1562
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
listening to here is a little bit

1563
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
like your first... Yeah, yeah.

1564
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
Not that kind of goofy, but

1565
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
it's a related kind of goofy.

1566
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
But the like I might go

1567
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
like it's like

1568
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
cheesy, right? But then it like you

1569
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
do remember it. It's like not

1570
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
afraid to be cheesy, which I always

1571
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
admire. Right. Instead of just sounding like

1572
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
every inspirational

1573
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
section, like

1574
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
inspirational film score

1575
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
for every movie that's come out. Like

1576
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
I don't need that in my area loops.

1577
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
They use... Disney's been using

1578
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
they've been compiling these ones

1579
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
that are compilations of film score songs.

1580
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
The American President song? I do like

1581
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
that. That's a good one.

1582
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
I like it too.

1583
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
I just wonder if

1584
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
that's what you meant. But yeah, that's a little

1585
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
bit I think where it started because people love that

1586
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
Soarin' Loop, which is not on

1587
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
my list. I like it. It's pleasant. But

1588
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
I think they took that and ran with it. And I think they started

1589
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
only using music that they have

1590
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
license to because they use the same

1591
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
damn Saving Mr. Bank's track

1592
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
in Sook.

1593
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
And it is nice to

1594
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
listen to, but it's not...

1595
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Right. When they were willing to

1596
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
pay for the music from a movie they don't

1597
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
own, it ends up

1598
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
feeling like Disney, even though

1599
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
it's not owned by Disney. It's worth paying

1600
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
for.

1601
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
Mike, do you want to play more to not

1602
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
get out of your zone too much?

1603
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
We've realized this episode's going to be

1604
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
three to ten hours long.

1605
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
I was going to shout out

1606
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
Frontierland, but

1607
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
we know what it's like. I was going to play a little

1608
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Buffalo Gals for Jason, but

1609
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
let's not do it.

1610
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
He's fucking champing

1611
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
at the bit.

1612
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
You're not going to play it.

1613
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
And this

1614
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
is from Cars Land.

1615
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
No, this is from Frontierland.

1616
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
We know Buffalo Gals in Cars Land?

1617
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
It's the dusty

1618
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
west. It would make sense there.

1619
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
But I just...

1620
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
There are a lot of songs played

1621
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
in Frontierland. We met Davy

1622
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
Crockett and all these different things.

1623
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
But it really...I don't know.

1624
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
As I've said, I like Hillbilly Nonsense the older

1625
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
I get. And part of it's from

1626
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
Wilco, but part of a lot of it is from

1627
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
going to Disney. Any theme park,

1628
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
you know, Knott's Berry Farm,

1629
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
you need an old west town.

1630
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
That is sort of part of it.

1631
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
And little small things we've gone

1632
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
to over the years.

1633
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
Do you understand why there's a straight line between

1634
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
Wilco and the music

1635
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
that Mike increasingly listens to, which is

1636
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
like, oh, dangle, dangle, banjo!

1637
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
I'm gonna have a hold on that!

1638
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
Bob Wills and his Texas Playboys.

1639
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
Yeah, I think there's some

1640
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
early Wilco tracks and then

1641
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
I think, is it

1642
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
the most recent Wilco album?

1643
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
Cruel Country you're talking about?

1644
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
Is it the second to last?

1645
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
That's the one with the song about a skunk

1646
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
that gets stuck in a barrel?

1647
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
I've never

1648
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
googled something faster.

1649
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
I wish there was one like that.

1650
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
They started as an alt country band.

1651
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
I would say they still are there.

1652
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
AM.

1653
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
AM is the big alt country.

1654
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
More, yeah.

1655
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
Appearing there, though, maybe has a little more

1656
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
because it is like Forget the Flowers and stuff.

1657
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
That's true. A little more, yeah.

1658
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
It's a little more acoustic country like what you just

1659
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
played. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1660
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
There's a little country of B&L as well.

1661
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
That's right. So I get a little of it in there.

1662
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
They experimented.

1663
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
But then going into like Frontierland and all

1664
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
these different places over the years, you hear

1665
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
all this in the background.

1666
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
Critter Country had a really good loop.

1667
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
The Splash Mountain Q. I remember I used to

1668
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
listen to that a lot.

1669
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
I don't listen to it anymore.

1670
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
That's good. Those are the rules.

1671
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
Except for sometimes

1672
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
when I...

1673
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
That's when you do that

1674
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
Russell Brand voice again.

1675
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Then you can admit that.

1676
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
It's like bluegrass

1677
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
standards.

1678
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
In some cases, I think,

1679
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
does Frontierland have any...

1680
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
It's all times of the era, I think.

1681
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
They don't have any like...

1682
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
You don't get eye-to-eye bluegrass

1683
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
version. No, I don't believe so.

1684
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
That would be pretty good and that's probably

1685
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
coming. Well, Frontierland's

1686
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
going away, I assume, in the next

1687
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
10 years, too. So we'll see.

1688
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
Or in the...

1689
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
Whatever in Disney World, there's going to

1690
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
be no river there. I assume the

1691
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
Hall of Presidents' days are numbered in the

1692
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
next... But that's not Frontierland.

1693
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
I guess that's not. But I feel like all of that

1694
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
is going to just turn into IP land.

1695
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
They paved paradise and they put up

1696
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
a parking lot.

1697
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
I think the idea of

1698
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
Frontierland has been on the table for going

1699
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
away, in general.

1700
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
Do you think they don't at least leave up the

1701
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
four stores in Country Bear Jamboree?

1702
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
Maybe. I mean, maybe they...

1703
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
Country Bears is just a little

1704
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
section there. I don't know. I don't know what it

1705
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
looks like in Florida, especially, because of what

1706
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
Cars does to that whole area.

1707
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
I must say, I am excited about that.

1708
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
And the music of Cars Land is

1709
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
good and maybe... And it's not

1710
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
dissimilar to this, as well. Cars Land

1711
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
in California.

1712
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
Well, do you have some Cars Land that you wanted to?

1713
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
I do, but not

1714
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
the stuff I'm talking about. I'm talking

1715
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
about Halloween Cars Land Overland.

1716
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
Oh, right. I forgot.

1717
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
I love

1718
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
California Adventure at Halloween.

1719
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
The purple lights, I say it

1720
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
every other episode, the purple lights

1721
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
by the Carthay is really great, but Cars

1722
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
Land itself, during Halloween,

1723
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
is my favorite. And they have a

1724
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
full... We did

1725
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
an episode last year about

1726
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
different Halloween songs.

1727
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
So they do play Monster Mash, they play

1728
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
Love Potion No. 9, but they play stuff that I had

1729
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
not heard until I went to

1730
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
Cars Land.

1731
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
So they have, like... This is a genre

1732
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
that you wish that there were,

1733
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
you know, there was a year's

1734
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
worth of music that is songs about

1735
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
ghosts and zombies. That's correct.

1736
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
I do wish that.

1737
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
But they've got other

1738
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
Bobby Boris Pickett songs, like Scully

1739
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
Gully.

1740
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
Just slightly less good versions

1741
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
of the Monster Mash.

1742
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
That's all I want.

1743
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
Well, and slightly less good versions of the song

1744
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
Hully Gully. Well, sure, yes.

1745
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
Wait a minute.

1746
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
So it's Scully with a K.

1747
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
I think so, yeah.

1748
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
The song Hully Gully, I only sort of know.

1749
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
It's that, but about skulls.

1750
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
So there's that.

1751
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
There's Buck Owens doing Monster's

1752
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
Holiday.

1753
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
Didn't we listen to Monster's Holiday?

1754
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
Not this

1755
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
version. This is Buck Owens doing it.

1756
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
Oh, hell yeah.

1757
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
And I don't think

1758
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
it's the same song. It's just

1759
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
another song called Monster's Holiday.

1760
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
Taking it easy.

1761
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
It is similar to it.

1762
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
Get more

1763
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
into this. It's good.

1764
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
It's better than Scully Gully.

1765
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
Monster's Holiday.

1766
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
Different Monster's Holiday.

1767
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
This is just fun.

1768
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
Fun music to

1769
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
look at your friends, Tomator and

1770
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
Lightning McQueen and their Halloween

1771
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
costumes. Yes. Have you been

1772
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
during Halloween? I have, but I don't

1773
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
remember there being a special loop.

1774
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
Really? Yeah, well

1775
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
I should say I've been when

1776
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
Haunted Mansion Holiday is going, but that could

1777
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
be like when I go tomorrow.

1778
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
Oh, that could be too early.

1779
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
Halloween in May.

1780
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
So maybe I haven't seen this, but this is

1781
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
great. But I think

1782
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
what is important with loops when it comes to

1783
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
like, I'll call this a pop song,

1784
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
a rock song, is if you can

1785
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
get stuff that people aren't that familiar

1786
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
with, it can then make you still feel

1787
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
like, oh, I'm in a different place. Obviously

1788
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
it sounds like stuff I've heard before.

1789
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
But I think that's part of

1790
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
some of the loops. If you can find like obscure

1791
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
stuff. Yeah, and things where you feel like

1792
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
you can only hear it in this place. As with

1793
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
characters we love because you only meet them in this certain ride.

1794
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
It might pull you out of it

1795
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
if it's music you associate too much with.

1796
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
Yes. So then you know it's not in a park.

1797
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
So I like that about it because there's a full

1798
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
hour long loop and most of the stuff

1799
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
I don't think is common Halloween

1800
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
stuff. But it evokes

1801
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
the imagery of Halloween

1802
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
costumed cars.

1803
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
Yes. With eyes. And it's similar

1804
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
to the music they play during

1805
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
the day. Tires that are turned into

1806
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
moaning faces of the dam. Yes.

1807
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
I do.

1808
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
That's worth an episode.

1809
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
This haunt cast season.

1810
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
Halloween.

1811
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
Is it called Halloween? Yeah,

1812
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
I believe so. And then some of them are dressed, the cars

1813
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
are dressed as Pixar characters as well.

1814
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
But the lights in there

1815
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
are really fun. Like that is a

1816
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
nice hang during Halloween.

1817
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
The cars are dressed as Pixar

1818
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
characters? At the very least there's posters

1819
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
where they're dressed like Woody and Buzz.

1820
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
Yes. Or is it like

1821
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
car parodies of Hocus Pocus

1822
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
or something? I know I've taken photos

1823
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
of these and I don't remember what they are.

1824
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
There might be a Christmas too.

1825
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
Is it like

1826
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
old Doc starring

1827
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
in a parody of the Santa Claus?

1828
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
What are they? I want the

1829
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
Cheech Marin car

1830
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
to be dressed as like Frankenstein.

1831
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
I don't want him dressed as Wally.

1832
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
Well Luigi and Guido could

1833
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
easily do the Monster

1834
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
Saint guys. That's fun.

1835
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
Someone's a vampire

1836
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
every year? Mater's usually

1837
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
the vampire. He's purple and he's

1838
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
got the cape and stuff and the fangs.

1839
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
It'd be cute if Mater and Lightning Queen

1840
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
dressed up as each other.

1841
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
Sure. I think that's

1842
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
Texas. After everything they've

1843
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
been through? After the twists and turns of that

1844
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
friendship? Yeah, that'd be the ultimate sign

1845
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
that they get along. Yeah, they actually are

1846
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
the cars. Here are the cars.

1847
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
This is from a couple years ago. Maybe they haven't done this in recent years.

1848
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
But like here's some cars

1849
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
dressed as Woody and Buzz. So the cars

1850
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
know...

1851
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
Well yeah, because this is established in the

1852
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
credits of Cars 1 because they all go

1853
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
to see drive-in movies that are

1854
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
car versions of Toy Story, Bugs Life

1855
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
and one of the other

1856
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
ones, Monsters Inc. I don't know. And then the

1857
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
truck that's voiced by John Ratzenberger

1858
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
points out that they reuse the same

1859
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
voice actors all the time. That's fun.

1860
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
You can't complain about that.

1861
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
I like that truck. Yeah.

1862
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
It's a good truck. Got a toy of that truck in the house.

1863
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
So never mind when that comes out.

1864
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
I have a couple, I think, of the cars

1865
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
when they sold the Cars toys

1866
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
where they were all Star Wars characters.

1867
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
Oh yeah. And I think Luigi

1868
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
and Guido might be R2D2

1869
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
and say 3PO?

1870
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
If they're not, they'd really drop the ball.

1871
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
Yeah. I mean

1872
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
unless they're dressed like Jar Jar

1873
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
and Boss Nas. That's the

1874
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
other big Star Wars duo.

1875
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
That would be really good. I have that stitch that's

1876
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
General Grievous from the old days.

1877
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
Is that true? Yeah, yeah.

1878
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
I have a stitch toy. Does he have all the arms?

1879
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
Because he has multiple arms. Yeah.

1880
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
He has four lightsabers.

1881
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
That's on the highest show.

1882
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
That's on the, like

1883
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
that's a daddy toy. Yeah.

1884
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
It's in a box somewhere. If Bobby

1885
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
Boris Pickett was a car,

1886
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
what kind of car, what do you picture?

1887
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
Oh, oh.

1888
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
Like if a car was singing that beautiful song

1889
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
we just heard. Gully Gully?

1890
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
I don't know old cars

1891
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
well enough. I know, it's really a bad idea.

1892
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
I mean is it obvious to say a

1893
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
hearse? But a classic old hearse.

1894
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
Probably a hearse, yeah.

1895
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
A Studebaker?

1896
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
The rest of the year, a Packard,

1897
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
the rest of the year is a very long, very wide

1898
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
car. That's why I know

1899
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
about old cars, long and wide.

1900
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
This is why we gotta get Jay Leno on the show

1901
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
to teach us more about old cars.

1902
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
But as always, recording in the

1903
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
Burbank area, he may crash into the walls

1904
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
at any time.

1905
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
You can find those two, Frontierland

1906
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
and the Cars Land Halloween

1907
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
playlist on Spotify, but then they have

1908
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
them on YouTube. We should just link to all these

1909
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
and throw them in the show. Our little special ones.

1910
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
Is there more that you want to play?

1911
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
No, we should move on. There's just so much

1912
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
to get to. But those are just

1913
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
great little shout outs.

1914
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
I'm gonna have that Buck Owens in my head for sure.

1915
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
We have passed

1916
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
the auxed Kevin.

1917
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
Kevin, very excited to dig into

1918
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
it. It must have been tough.

1919
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
You picked this episode topic and then how do you

1920
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
narrow down a favorite

1921
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
within hundreds? It was painful

1922
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
for sure to do that.

1923
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
With some back and forth because I thought you said one

1924
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
and then the answer changed too. Yeah.

1925
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
I said one. What I said was the Wonders of

1926
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
Life loop. Which is

1927
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
not ultimately what I picked, but

1928
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
for anybody wanting to get

1929
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
wanting a primer of like

1930
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
new age music from about

1931
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
1990, 1991

1932
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
ish, Wonders of Life is really

1933
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
great. It's got this great

1934
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
San Diego group

1935
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
called Check Field on there.

1936
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
That's just a great mix of like sort of

1937
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
earthy sounds with jazz.

1938
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
There on that we've got

1939
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
Ray Lynch who is this sort of

1940
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
strange computer music

1941
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
synth wizard

1942
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
sort of guy and he made very, very fun

1943
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
slightly haunting

1944
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
computery music. Like it's all on there.

1945
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
He did something called Celestial Soda Pop.

1946
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
Celestial Soda Pop. Right. Which

1947
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
I kept thinking about when I was in Celestial

1948
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
Park drinking their special soda pop. Of course.

1949
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
Oh wow. He invented the

1950
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
idea of Celestial Soda Pop. I guess so.

1951
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
Yeah so Wonders of Life

1952
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
is a really great loop and like I've gotten

1953
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
really obsessed with it and sort of

1954
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
took all of the artists on that and

1955
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
started wandering down the rabbit holes.

1956
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
And that's how my

1957
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
playlist that I've shared with you Scott

1958
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
Liminal Oasis started is that I just started

1959
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
taking the artists on the Wonders of Life

1960
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
loop and started going down rabbit holes

1961
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
of albums and finding more

1962
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
music that sounds like that until I have

1963
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
hundreds of hours of this. Which what a way

1964
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
that's in terms of that like do we like

1965
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
this cause of theme parser? Do we like it on its own?

1966
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
That's a great way to figure it out is to like

1967
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
okay so something about this is taking me

1968
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
back to Epcot Center in the mid 90s

1969
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
or whatever but like that there's more

1970
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
of that it's that vibe but it wasn't

1971
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
specifically played there. Right. And you're describing

1972
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
a playlist. Are you willing to let the

1973
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
listeners in into the world of Liminal Oasis?

1974
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
Of course. I consider this one of the crowning

1975
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
achievements of my life.

1976
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
Well I mean and understandably because the stats

1977
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
are so good. I think I can pull

1978
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
it up on spot. This is a

1979
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
this is a hundred

1980
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
and sixty six hours. Good God.

1981
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
Wow. Yeah basically.

1982
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
Liminal Oasis with a bunch

1983
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
of like odd symbols on both sides.

1984
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
It's great art. A great like

1985
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
electric prism in the

1986
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
cosmos. This is

1987
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
a wonderful playlist that you've made and

1988
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
as the playlist that I will play

1989
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
I feel like you kind of like it sort of

1990
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
holds your hand from the like

1991
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
maybe barely more accessible

1992
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
worlds of smooth

1993
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
70s 80s jazz. Yeah. Into

1994
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
the confusing intimidating

1995
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
world of new age music.

1996
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
It's not intimidating Scott.

1997
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
It was for me. I think

1998
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
I in my head I'm like no

1999
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
adults in the 2020s

2000
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
should be listening to 1990s

2001
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
new age music. This is a

2002
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
way till this is a one way ticket to

2003
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
being unrelatable to your fellow man.

2004
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
And I assumed I think a degree

2005
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
of cheesy or cheesiness

2006
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
that maybe as I've started to like

2007
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
wade into the waters I'll go you know

2008
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
well that's not so cheesy. Oh that's

2009
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
not so cheesy at all. This I like.

2010
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
This I kind of like. I think embracing the fact

2011
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
that a lot of this music is cheesy

2012
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
and you wouldn't necessarily want

2013
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
I don't know the

2014
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
girl you have a crush on in high school to hear

2015
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
you listening to it if you were like on the school bus

2016
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
or whatever. Yes. No it's the music

2017
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
you dive into with somebody you're

2018
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
deep into a marriage with who you

2019
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
trust. Who has no way out.

2020
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
Who's trapped.

2021
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
Or in our case musically where Aaron

2022
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
and I I think have like a you know

2023
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
mutually assured destruction

2024
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
like we both just go we push each

2025
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
other deeper and deeper into

2026
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
the land of cheese to where like

2027
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
we don't consider it any of it. Any of it

2028
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
cheesy anymore. It's not good

2029
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
first make out music but it's good

2030
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
like settled make out music.

2031
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
I thought you were going to say second make out music.

2032
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
Oh well you know

2033
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
if you're really high on the hog you know.

2034
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
Look it's not as good as Buffalo Gals

2035
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
but it's pretty good.

2036
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
Chattanooga choo choo usually.

2037
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
That gets them cooking.

2038
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
Do you want to come over?

2039
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
I got some great tunes

2040
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
ready to go. Shuffle off to Buffalo

2041
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
is next that's right.

2042
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
If you want to come over and have a good laugh about

2043
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
begin the beguine.

2044
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
When I was in fifth grade I had a crush

2045
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
on this girl and we went on a school

2046
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
field trip and I specifically brought

2047
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
the mighty mighty boss tones.

2048
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
Let's face it CD so that she could listen

2049
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
to it and she would maybe think

2050
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
oh this is a type of music I've never heard before.

2051
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
How does she like royal oil?

2052
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
She didn't care

2053
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
for it very much but on that same trip

2054
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
the one and only time I ever won anything from

2055
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
the crane game I won it for her.

2056
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
A little vampire

2057
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
but then she didn't like the mighty mighty boss tones

2058
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
CD. Anyway so she's out.

2059
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
Hit the bricks. And let's face it I don't

2060
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
let's face it that's the name of the album.

2061
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
I didn't mean to do that but let's face it

2062
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
she probably wouldn't like the wonders of life loop either.

2063
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
Well it's important to know early then.

2064
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
You have a vast

2065
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
collection of new age

2066
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
cassette tapes. Yeah good memory.

2067
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
And that all stemmed from like one Christmas

2068
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
Eve I was in my childhood bedroom

2069
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
and I was like kind of

2070
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
trying to get sleepy. I was listening to some

2071
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
area loops but then I got really hopped up

2072
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
thinking about all the artists

2073
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
and albums that comprise like

2074
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
these area loops and I was like I gotta

2075
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
like start saving those on Spotify

2076
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
but none of them were on Spotify.

2077
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
There are some but a lot of them

2078
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
if you want to hear the full thing

2079
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
you need you can't.

2080
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
Some of them aren't even on YouTube

2081
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
so I just went on eBay and I started buying

2082
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
cassettes on Christmas Eve

2083
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
and within like

2084
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
an hour

2085
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
I think I had spent like $200

2086
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
on like 90's new age cassettes.

2087
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
Oh my god.

2088
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
That really speaks to the obscurity

2089
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
of it. That it has not only not made

2090
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
the Spotify transition but that

2091
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
cassette becomes the primary

2092
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
way to experience this music.

2093
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
You can get them on CD. But you wanted

2094
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
it. I wanted it and I don't do vinyl. I didn't do

2095
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
any physical media really for music

2096
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
until these cassettes and I still

2097
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
really only have like new age and smooth jazz

2098
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
cassettes.

2099
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
It's good for physical media because of

2100
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
the photo art of some of these people.

2101
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
I think you get a kick

2102
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
out of looking at the images of most

2103
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
of these artists.

2104
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
All this to say the Wonders of Life

2105
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
loop is great and if you want a primer on

2106
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
good music like that just start digging

2107
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
into these artists.

2108
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
To that end I refresh my memory about

2109
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
it and getting comfortable with new

2110
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
age stuff. I was just listening to it not

2111
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
looking at artists and there was one that was like

2112
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
this one's really doing it for me.

2113
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
This is hidden.

2114
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
Who we got here? Who is this?

2115
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
Look it up. Yanni.

2116
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
I was just

2117
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
digging a Yanni track without even

2118
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
realizing it.

2119
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
That's a number called Looking Glass by Yanni.

2120
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
If you think Yanni

2121
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
looks crazy, if listeners

2122
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
even remember Yanni, a staple of

2123
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
TBS music, one of the most

2124
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
beautifully haired, beautifully

2125
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
mustachioed men,

2126
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
beautifully puffy shirted men ever to live,

2127
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
I feel like

2128
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
you get deeper into this genre and Yanni

2129
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
just looks like a normal guy on the street.

2130
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
He is kind of a hunk but Yanni

2131
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
looks cool compared to

2132
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
somebody that I'm about to talk to

2133
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
with. So Wonders of Life was not my

2134
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
pick but the Innoventions

2135
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
loop was.

2136
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
And then we're talking

2137
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
when Innoventions opens in 94,

2138
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
this is the music when Innoventions is

2139
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
new on the scene, when Epcot is

2140
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
entering a new era of futurism.

2141
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
That's right.

2142
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
I'll give you a hit of it because there's multiple

2143
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
different movements and maybe we can

2144
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
maybe we can

2145
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
find, yeah here's a track list

2146
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
so it sort of starts off

2147
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
with this track.

2148
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
There's a whole story with this and I

2149
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
kind of learned it.

2150
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
We gotta get the main melody here.

2151
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
So good. This is David Arkenstone

2152
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
with a track called Papillon

2153
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
on the Wings of the Butterfly.

2154
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
This is, if you had like

2155
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
Chet GPT, please

2156
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
create the name of

2157
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
a new age music artist and the kind of

2158
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
song title that they would do.

2159
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
And now create an image of that

2160
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
artist and it is exactly David

2161
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
Arkenstone. I love

2162
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
this track so much. I wonder

2163
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
if listeners of a certain era, like

2164
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
does it take you

2165
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
to original Innoventions, to what

2166
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
we've lost?

2167
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
It starts to get a little more

2168
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
interesting.

2169
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
Yes, and this is, so this is

2170
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
an interesting loop because this is

2171
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
not an original piece of music

2172
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
made by a Disney Imagineer.

2173
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
But the composer's name is

2174
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
Russell Brower at Disney

2175
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
Imagineering and he took

2176
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
a bunch of songs apparently to

2177
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
the committee of Imagineers

2178
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
and one of them was

2179
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
David Arkenstone's Papillon on the Wings of the Butterfly

2180
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
and he had them pick

2181
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
which song

2182
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
they liked best for the tone of

2183
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
the Innoventions area. So he would know

2184
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
which way to go with his own music?

2185
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
That's right and so

2186
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
as a springboard

2187
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
Papillon on the Wings of the Butterfly

2188
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
B-Gat

2189
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
Future World theme. Let's hope this is

2190
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
where this loop goes.

2191
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
Here we go.

2192
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
This is...

2193
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
I am ready

2194
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
to learn.

2195
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
I'm ready to learn about the internet.

2196
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
I'm ready to not meet

2197
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
Cinderella today. I'm here

2198
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
to get my mind expanded.

2199
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
Yeah, you're here to meet Vector Man.

2200
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
Here to meet

2201
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
Sega Genesis classic

2202
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
Vector. Toejam and Earl

2203
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
Toejam and Earl.

2204
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
Walk around Toejam and Earl.

2205
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
Oh man, that'd be something.

2206
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
There was walk around

2207
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
Crash Bandicoot at Universal

2208
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
from last year.

2209
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
He hung out in the courtyard.

2210
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000
When I talk about singable

2211
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
melodies that you remember

2212
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
this is one of the most

2213
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
this is a perfect

2214
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
melody. You don't hear

2215
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
this stuff that much

2216
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
these days. But

2217
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
it's just an interesting collection of notes.

2218
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
I wish I knew more about music

2219
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
theory but really I just think it's like

2220
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
it conveys the optimism

2221
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
of future world

2222
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
and invention and

2223
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
innovation together.

2224
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
It would work in a museum too.

2225
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
It's stirring.

2226
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
It reaches out to

2227
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
kids. Instead of

2228
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
this is stuffy and boring

2229
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000
even the best piece of classical music

2230
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
might make you feel like

2231
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
this is work I have to do today. But this

2232
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
is kind of like

2233
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
it's building you.

2234
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
It's like making you anticipate

2235
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
what's coming today.

2236
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,000
Correct me if I'm wrong because this

2237
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,000
may be a stupid thing as I express it.

2238
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
It's so era specific

2239
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
too that it has

2240
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
the vibe of something that is like

2241
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
inspiring and you're about to go

2242
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,000
exploring. You're about to go on an adventure

2243
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
as well. But because it is

2244
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
tied to such a specific era

2245
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
it just can't

2246
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,000
help but be like

2247
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,000
so stimulating for men of a certain

2248
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
age.

2249
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,000
Do you find it stimulating, Michael?

2250
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
Yeah, absolutely.

2251
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,000
It just feels so specific

2252
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
due to an era.

2253
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
It reminds me of

2254
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
it could also be the introduction

2255
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
to a VHS that you would watch

2256
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,000
in science class.

2257
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
It's not that I remember this from being a kid

2258
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
but I just feel like it makes me feel like

2259
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,000
being a kid.

2260
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
For whatever thing it is

2261
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
whether it be a video game, whether it be a VHS

2262
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
and I feel like this

2263
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,000
is not just millennial

2264
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
nostalgia. I feel like this

2265
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
could pop off on TikTok.

2266
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,000
Yeah!

2267
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
You could sample it, you could slow it down

2268
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
and you could do a lot with this.

2269
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
Let's do that really quick.

2270
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,000
Oh boy.

2271
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,000
Let's hear what it sounds like.

2272
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,000
I remember in like 2021

2273
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
22 as Disney

2274
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
phased

2275
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
reopening stuff and finally

2276
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
starting going on their Epcot reopening

2277
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
and there was a post

2278
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
either on the

2279
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
Imagineer account on Instagram

2280
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,000
or Daddy Tomorrow's account

2281
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
and it was talking about

2282
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
different glass

2283
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
for like the shop

2284
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
reflecting rainbow or lights

2285
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
and I was like

2286
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
this is what we're getting instead of

2287
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
we're losing the

2288
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
inventions music but we're getting

2289
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
different

2290
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
oh it's

2291
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
in the

2292
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
range of it's over we're back

2293
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
that was a real it's over

2294
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
definitely and yeah

2295
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
this also

2296
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
played in mouse gear

2297
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
oh right

2298
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
store mouse gear in that area

2299
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
but Innoventions and Mouse Gear I think

2300
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
opened at the same time

2301
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
I don't know what was playing

2302
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
in this place but all I know is

2303
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,000
I hear this and I can

2304
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
go straight to the old electric umbrella

2305
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
I'm in electric

2306
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
umbrella as I listen to this

2307
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
I never spent too much time

2308
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
there I think I popped in

2309
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
before it was gone I got to see it

2310
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,000
before it flickered away

2311
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
I don't remember what the food was like

2312
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
but I know that the phrase electric

2313
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
umbrella fills me with optimism

2314
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,000
this in general this all just makes

2315
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,000
this is like the 21st century

2316
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,000
is coming it's going to be

2317
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,000
beautiful and wonderful and magical

2318
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,000
not a whole bunch of dog shit

2319
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000
that gets worse and worse

2320
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
well Scott unfortunately the future turned out

2321
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,000
to be a lot of

2322
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000
bland minimalist bullshit

2323
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,000
that's already out of style

2324
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,000
outside of generic apartments

2325
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
with white walls and great floors

2326
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
which I say as someone who

2327
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
lives in an apartment with white

2328
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
walls and great floors

2329
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000
no but doesn't this take you like this is

2330
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
in the future in a mirror

2331
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
right now it's only an Epcot Center

2332
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
but soon everywhere I turn

2333
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
there will be electric umbrellas

2334
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,000
whatever that means

2335
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
people holding them in stores

2336
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
as shade out in the world

2337
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
the world will be electric umbrellas

2338
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
each more purple than the last

2339
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
I slowed it down by the way

2340
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,000
oh you didn't even know

2341
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,000
it worked so well

2342
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
wait let's listen

2343
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
now I hear it slow down

2344
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
took Quaaludes

2345
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
live remixes

2346
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
this is great thank you for this

2347
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,000
I don't really like it this way

2348
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000
I like it better normal

2349
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,000
there was a moment probably many years ago

2350
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
at this point where I felt like

2351
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
there's a lot of like video game mixes

2352
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
too like any sort of like ambient loop

2353
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
thing I do like that a lot now but you can get

2354
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000
like really like 8 bit mixes

2355
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
of whatever red hot chili there's like

2356
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
the sound prof

2357
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
what do you call them sound

2358
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
sound font thank you of Donkey Kong

2359
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,000
Country but it's Californication

2360
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,000
I do like that

2361
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,000
it's like the weird

2362
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,000
that's been done for the Beach Boys Love You

2363
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,000
oh I believe that

2364
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,000
possibly the last Beach Boys album

2365
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,000
so there's all these different kinds of loops and stuff

2366
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,000
and then whenever it was they started

2367
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,000
so much video game music started being posted

2368
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,000
I always loved all the Mario

2369
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
music and all the Nintendo music but then

2370
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
you would get these loops of them and you'd

2371
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,000
start realizing oh this isn't just a fun

2372
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
little piece of music that I liked

2373
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,000
these are like really genius

2374
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,000
level things that you can sometimes

2375
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,000
just because of the old school

2376
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
sound of it the 8 bit sound of it

2377
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,000
you're like you don't necessarily notice how

2378
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,000
cool it is

2379
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,000
it didn't have to be whatever the music

2380
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
and NBA Jam didn't have to be

2381
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,000
like so great and memorable

2382
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,000
but you feel like people

2383
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,000
caring all across the board

2384
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,000
in these video games in the parks

2385
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,000
it felt like you know like a little

2386
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
content opportunity opened up and

2387
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
people filled it with love and with

2388
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
cool keyboard sounds

2389
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,000
now you get like orchestra

2390
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
performances of Nintendo

2391
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
stuff and then you go holy

2392
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
shit Super Mario World music is

2393
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
amazing those in particular

2394
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
these songs are I never even

2395
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
I always like these and these are so hummable but

2396
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
I would love to hear that song

2397
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
in different styles too

2398
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,000
I was just thinking about this

2399
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
recently well I was thinking

2400
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
about this episode like if somebody

2401
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,000
did a like if Russell

2402
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,000
Brower himself

2403
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
I don't know hosted or what do you call

2404
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,000
conducted a the orchestra

2405
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
playing here I assume I assume

2406
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,000
this is actually an orchestra not

2407
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
just synth it sounds pretty real

2408
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
with a little bit of synth in there too

2409
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,000
but I could be wrong but if he

2410
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,000
did like something at

2411
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,000
say the Dr. Phillips Center in

2412
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
Orlando Florida if he had a

2413
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,000
live show where he just played

2414
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,000
the interventions loop

2415
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,000
I would probably

2416
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,000
I would probably get emotional it like feels

2417
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
impossible now but the fact also

2418
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000
but then like ten years ago you if you

2419
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,000
if you'd been told there's going to be

2420
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,000
a like massive cult

2421
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,000
fandom of the track

2422
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,000
aquatic ambiance from Donkey Kong

2423
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
Country like this will be played

2424
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
emotionally at festivals and people

2425
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,000
will be close to this like this is

2426
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
why we have to do we have to like spread

2427
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
this fandom and get it out like like

2428
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,000
no Disney there's even more layers

2429
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,000
of cult fandom within your upper

2430
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,000
then you even do you have to serve this now

2431
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,000
you have to do an orchestral Russell Brower

2432
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
concert yeah apparently he

2433
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,000
wasn't even going to have music for this

2434
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,000
area because a executive

2435
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,000
I listen to an interview about this but the

2436
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,000
executive gave him a little guff about it

2437
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
was like that's a that's a thoroughfare

2438
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,000
nobody's going to stop there they don't need music

2439
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,000
they can just go to the fountain if they want music

2440
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,000
but he advocated for the

2441
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
grandparents and the parents who

2442
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,000
are waiting for their children to meet them at a

2443
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
central location he said you don't want them

2444
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
to sit in silence this needs

2445
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
music yeah

2446
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
oh it's like inclusive it's

2447
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
great and now everywhere you go

2448
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,000
at a Disney park I don't think you would be

2449
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,000
able to find like a silent section

2450
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,000
yeah and that wasn't always the case

2451
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
I don't think yeah yeah

2452
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
interesting um you know it's a big area with all this

2453
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,000
too where the hell is all this music coming

2454
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
from you know sometimes you can see the speakers

2455
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
but sometimes you really

2456
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,000
can't in a lot of cases you

2457
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,000
can't Kevin we were in Orlando

2458
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,000
we had a great evening at Wilderness Lodge

2459
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
where I had never been you showed me

2460
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,000
all the all the great nooks and crannies

2461
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,000
and at one point when we

2462
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,000
were on our way what is the the train building

2463
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,000
where is that like the DVC

2464
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,000
where all of Walt's train stuff

2465
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,000
is the Carol Wood

2466
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,000
room the Carol

2467
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,000
Wood room we were on like a little like

2468
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
covered bridge essentially to the

2469
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,000
Carol Wood room and then noting

2470
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,000
how loud all of the like the

2471
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,000
the cricket chirping was and then

2472
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,000
we went wait a minute yeah is this manufactured

2473
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,000
and from where

2474
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,000
and then we looked up and there have been speakers

2475
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
so hidden we didn't even they were above

2476
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,000
us the whole time and that's how I feel

2477
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,000
in a lot of these places like where

2478
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,000
is the music coming that's

2479
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,000
like an incredible underrated part of

2480
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,000
I'd say particularly Disney parks

2481
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,000
but you know but all parks yeah maybe

2482
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,000
that's an episode where we like go through Disneyland

2483
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,000
and try to find all the speakers

2484
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,000
speaker hunts

2485
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,000
sometimes you just find like because

2486
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,000
I know you sent videos of just things like

2487
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,000
you like this piece of music and then it's just playing

2488
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,000
off of like a little pod in a planter

2489
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,000
and that's fine you can do that

2490
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,000
there's a charm to that too

2491
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,000
sometimes a barely visible speakers

2492
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,000
fun but an invisible speaker

2493
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,000
what a magic trick yeah that's

2494
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,000
really cool and I get something sounding good

2495
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,000
from a source you cannot see

2496
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,000
that's wild we did

2497
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,000
determine that those crickets were in fact

2498
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,000
being pumped in yeah yes

2499
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,000
but we completely but I mean we

2500
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,000
noted it I guess eventually

2501
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,000
but it was realistic enough that we had the question

2502
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,000
Wilderness Lodge has a great loop by the way

2503
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,000
I didn't highlight it here because it's sort of just

2504
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,000
generic soaring

2505
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,000
inspiring nature

2506
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,000
National Parks, John Muir

2507
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,000
Spirit of America but I yeah

2508
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,000
I don't think any of what we're talking about

2509
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,000
is hotels

2510
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,000
and there's a lot of

2511
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,000
some of them really are like

2512
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,000
you know Resort gets a title

2513
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,000
like Saratoga Springs and you're like

2514
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,000
how do you score that what is the music of

2515
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,000
Saratoga Springs these people they always figure

2516
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,000
out as it turns out the Saratoga Springs

2517
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,000
loop I think is mostly just sort of

2518
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,000
like the type of music

2519
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,000
I think you have dubbed or maybe your wife has

2520
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,000
dubbed crap jazz crap jazz

2521
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,000
yes yeah yeah

2522
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,000
re-orchestrations of camp

2523
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,000
town races like jazzy

2524
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,000
you need to be in charge of this

2525
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,000
of that sound track

2526
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,000
it's more just like weather channel music

2527
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,000
which of course I like but it's not

2528
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,000
it's not for everyone I know the line

2529
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,000
between like because it's something I will play

2530
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,000
I don't consider crap jazz there's

2531
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,000
there is music there's definitely

2532
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,000
instrumental music in the Disney parks that we

2533
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:33,000
called crap jazz but we that is a

2534
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,000
loving term on our part actually

2535
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:37,000
I think maybe we declared this is a little

2536
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,000
cheesy it's a little bit like it's when things

2537
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,000
stop sounding as good maybe in like 2000

2538
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,000
or so yeah you don't have like inherently

2539
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,000
cool production techniques as

2540
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,000
with 80s 90s stuff

2541
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,000
but then the more time you spend

2542
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,000
in DCA wine area

2543
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,000
you're like I kind of love the crap jazz

2544
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,000
I'm very fond of the crap jazz

2545
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,000
I know I like it too I don't consider crap an insult

2546
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,000
anymore I like all of it

2547
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,000
doesn't matter I have that great Californian

2548
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,000
hotel oh I love

2549
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,000
any piece of music yeah yeah yeah yeah absolutely

2550
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,000
what else you got

2551
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,000
do you got other stuff from that or do you

2552
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,000
I have just a snippet of something else but I will end the

2553
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,000
interventions loop talk by saying this is my goat

2554
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,000
100% greatest of all

2555
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,000
time for me Russell Brow

2556
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,000
who went on to do a lot of World of Warcraft

2557
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,000
so did David Arkenstone

2558
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,000
wow wow

2559
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,000
so Disney this initial

2560
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,000
playground for composers

2561
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,000
who have gone on to do things that are like

2562
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,000
you know a little bit more mainstream

2563
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:33,000
yeah and Arkenstone wasn't involved with Disney

2564
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,000
Arkenstone was just a guy that

2565
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,000
Russell Brower liked the music of

2566
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,000
and then the Imagineers were like

2567
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,000
no we like that one keep that

2568
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:43,000
beginning in there right around it

2569
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,000
no please we like Papillon

2570
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,000
I just want to say the title here

2571
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,000
no wait we really like Papillon on the wings of the butterfly

2572
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,000
off the album in the wake of the wind

2573
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,000
which I have it comes with a map

2574
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,000
whoa

2575
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,000
a fictional land Jason I

2576
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,000
don't know I really don't know

2577
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,000
Lord of Entry shit

2578
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,000
that album cover if we're

2579
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,000
thinking of the same one look it up that's

2580
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,000
an aesthetic that I would call a really specific

2581
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,000
early 90's micro aesthetic which is

2582
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,000
Columbus core this is

2583
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,000
when we were going Columbus

2584
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,000
crazy for the 500th

2585
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:17,000
anniversary of

2586
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,000
1492 when there were

2587
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,000
multiple Columbus films I think one

2588
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,000
with a Vangelis score yeah

2589
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:25,000
who factors into there's some Vangelis in some

2590
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:27,000
of these some of these things

2591
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,000
but yeah he was like Jason

2592
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,000
this album gives you a little bit more

2593
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,000
Columbus magic if that's what you're

2594
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:35,000
after I feel like

2595
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,000
because we got rid of Columbus for a while and I feel

2596
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,000
like there was some horrible White House thing

2597
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:41,000
today it was like Columbus is back yeah

2598
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:43,000
I feel like I saw that literally today that's not

2599
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:45,000
what I'm saying I don't agree you're saying

2600
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,000
that I'm just saying it's funny I think it's more today

2601
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,000
I think when I say Columbus core

2602
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,000
I actually think more of

2603
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,000
Port of Entry or so like oh sure

2604
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:55,000
imagine setting sail like

2605
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,000
imagine like a good person

2606
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,000
who's taken a bunch of ships across

2607
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,000
the world like not a pirate but

2608
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,000
perhaps a merchant yes merchant

2609
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,000
yes they're off to find nice

2610
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,000
spices this is a cover for

2611
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:09,000
one of my beloved Ninja Turtles adventures

2612
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:11,000
comics is

2613
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,000
in stone

2614
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:15,000
1492 on Donatello's back

2615
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,000
Columbus

2616
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:19,000
mania really why is that happening

2617
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:21,000
I don't remember

2618
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,000
I just remember the cover after

2619
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,000
you said that going like Columbus isn't that well this is

2620
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:27,000
January 1993

2621
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:29,000
oh 1992 was

2622
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:31,000
five hundred okay yes

2623
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,000
yes so there's they were like

2624
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,000
somewhere in storm near the Caribbean

2625
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,000
Sea that's what the

2626
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,000
place to find the turtles

2627
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,000
did I interrupt though

2628
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,000
no all I was going to say is like

2629
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:45,000
if I was making

2630
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:47,000
I every once in a while make a list of like my

2631
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:49,000
favorite albums of all time and

2632
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:51,000
loops are not

2633
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,000
loop is not album but

2634
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,000
if it was if you consider the interventions

2635
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,000
loop an album I think

2636
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,000
it would be up

2637
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,000
there in my top ten in your

2638
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:03,000
personal world all you need to do is the magic

2639
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,000
of a CD burning kiosk

2640
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:07,000
oh yeah and then it becomes an album

2641
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:09,000
every loop can be album

2642
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,000
with CD burn you actually

2643
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,000
have a rank like would it be like between seven

2644
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,000
like would you have a number in your head where

2645
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:17,000
it would be or just your thinking would be in the ten

2646
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,000
one no I don't know

2647
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:21,000
I mean like I guess an easier way

2648
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,000
to phrase is like if I had ten desert

2649
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,000
island albums yeah to

2650
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:27,000
you know what I mean to take with me I think this

2651
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,000
would be I would probably take a

2652
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:31,000
there would be a Beatles album on there but this would kick

2653
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,000
a lot of Beatles albums off of there

2654
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,000
like I wouldn't be like sorry

2655
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:37,000
it might bump a few what's the best one

2656
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:39,000
it bumps yeah maybe that yeah like

2657
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,000
I kind of I remember Sergeant Pepper well enough that's fine

2658
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,000
yeah I don't know

2659
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:45,000
but Sergeant Pepper's gotta go

2660
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,000
yeah and it would serve as a

2661
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:49,000
reminder of great

2662
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,000
memories in the parks while I was on my desert

2663
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,000
island well sure hey 45 minutes

2664
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:55,000
to an hour though you're pushing that CD

2665
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,000
how much audio that CD

2666
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,000
that's true yeah no no no a burnable

2667
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,000
CD has 70 minutes I

2668
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,000
know because I believe that's the number

2669
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:05,000
or something around there and I know this

2670
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,000
because I burn my dad a CD

2671
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,000
of instrumental surf music

2672
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,000
for his birthday for Christmas and

2673
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:13,000
for Father's Day he makes me a track

2674
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,000
list that he writes out on a legal pad

2675
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,000
and he gives me a fun idea of a

2676
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:19,000
surf cover and title that it should

2677
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,000
have and then I go ripping tracks

2678
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,000
on YouTube and I have to get out

2679
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:25,000
an old laptop that I only keep because

2680
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:27,000
it has the ability to burn CDs

2681
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,000
and I make him a surf I just did it

2682
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,000
the other day for his for his birthday

2683
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,000
I have like a $15 external

2684
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:35,000
like USB-C

2685
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:37,000
the old external wow wow

2686
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,000
I had to burn a DVD of my

2687
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,000
I had to rip a DVD

2688
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:43,000
of my friend's

2689
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,000
sister's bat mitzvah

2690
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,000
from like 1998 or something

2691
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,000
the other day that's a real mystery ripping

2692
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:51,000
a DVD that's a like

2693
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,000
that's like Apollo 13 like we need to

2694
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,000
make all this shit fit into this

2695
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:57,000
handbrake remember handbrake

2696
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,000
forever wow

2697
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,000
VLC is that the program?

2698
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,000
VLC failed me

2699
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,000
VLC can play an old DVD

2700
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:07,000
sometimes though it can rip things

2701
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:09,000
I think I could have ripped it with VLC

2702
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:11,000
but I had to download handbrake

2703
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,000
well and then you have to go like does it need to be

2704
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,000
playable or is it a data disc

2705
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,000
because a data disc can hold a lot

2706
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,000
oh that's like 800 megs I think

2707
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,000
yeah yeah you gotta choose

2708
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,000
is it the 70 minutes or the 800

2709
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,000
megs anyway it was touch and go

2710
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,000
maybe my super drive ate the DVD at one point

2711
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,000
anyway I'm glad that we're just on

2712
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,000
YouTube now like we don't need to

2713
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,000
so people these these pioneers who've done

2714
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,000

so we can highlight it in future

2724
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,000
episodes as we

2725
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,000
you know do this explore this area

2726
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,000
more yeah this might need a part two

2727
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,000
maybe so maybe so one last thing

2728
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:03,000
international spotlight de Efteling in the Netherlands

2729
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,000
oh yeah one of the only

2730
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,000
parks that I've been to that

2731
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:09,000
isn't Disney or Universal that has really

2732
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,000
great music this is

2733
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,000
off of this is the loop for

2734
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,000
their castle trackless

2735
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,000
dark ride Symbolica which

2736
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:19,000
the characters go Symbolica

2737
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:21,000
that is an incredible looking ride follows the magical journeys

2738
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,000
of the magical jester Pardosh

2739
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,000
and this is the sound of it

2740
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,000
I think we did an episode and said that name completely

2741
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,000
not that way I guarantee

2742
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:31,000
this name is

2743
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,000
Pardwitz

2744
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,000
it really

2745
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:37,000
gets cooking

2746
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,000
this is an hour long

2747
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,000
this reminds me of Mario Odyssey

2748
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,000
yeah

2749
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,000
isn't that nice

2750
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:53,000
but it kind of goes through

2751
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,000
variations on that theme

2752
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:57,000
throughout and it's wow

2753
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,000
that's something for like

2754
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:01,000
purely made for a theme park that's beautiful

2755
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,000
I've been clamoring to get back to Efteling

2756
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,000
because it's a very strange park with

2757
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,000
kind of strange music oh wow yeah

2758
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,000
I'd love to go in general alright well Kevin

2759
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,000
I'm staying in a similar neck of the woods

2760
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:13,000
to you which makes sense because I feel like

2761
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:15,000
our first contact I don't know if it was

2762
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,000
if you talked to me first or

2763
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,000
you just emailed the podcast

2764
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:21,000
that's a good question I don't know either

2765
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,000
it could have been that

2766
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:25,000
but I

2767
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:27,000
I know that the first you and I talked

2768
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,000
was that you know that I had floated

2769
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:31,000
every once in a while

2770
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,000
I will bring up the kind of very

2771
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,000
relaxing 70s 80s smooth jazz

2772
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,000
that I'm very passionate about that

2773
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,000
makes me a more relaxed person

2774
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:41,000
day to day as I often say

2775
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:43,000
I don't need to smoke cigarettes because I listen

2776
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,000
to music like this and it really

2777
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,000
brings me down a notch especially

2778
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,000
when a project is

2779
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,000
insane or whatever but you know

2780
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:53,000
I'll drop a Bob James or

2781
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:55,000
a Dave Gruessen or a Lee Rittenhour

2782
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:57,000
and you reached out

2783
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:59,000
and I think sensing a

2784
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,000
kindred musical spirit

2785
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,000
and said do you know that there's

2786
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:05,000
this playlist of all of the music

2787
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:07,000
that would play at the contemporary

2788
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:09,000
in the lobby in

2789
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:11,000
the early 90s that's right I

2790
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,000
emailed I remember I emailed it

2791
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:15,000
that might have been like two general podcasts

2792
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:17,000
the ride at Gmail an email that we

2793
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:19,000
sometimes check I'm sorry

2794
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,000
I know this was this was in a time

2795
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,000
where we might check it a little more thoroughly

2796
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:25,000
but yours cut through

2797
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,000
because like why yes

2798
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,000
yes I do and I took to that playlist

2799
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:31,000
so quickly and that is not what

2800
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,000
I'm talking about this that's

2801
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,000
not what I chose although very well could

2802
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,000
have been but that like

2803
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,000
I I

2804
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:41,000
appreciated that you were like okay

2805
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:43,000
if he's like you must you must have been like I

2806
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,000
don't hear it people reference this kind of music

2807
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,000
in the wild ever right

2808
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,000
I need to contact this person and make sure

2809
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:51,000
he knows that there is a way to

2810
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:53,000
feel at all times like you're in the lobby

2811
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:55,000
of the contemporary that is a great

2812
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:57,000
loop that has that has some

2813
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,000
serious smooth stuff on yes

2814
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:01,000
the ripping tins on it

2815
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:03,000
oh my god ripping ripping tins

2816
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:05,000
is that was really like you know I thought

2817
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:07,000
that I didn't fuck with 90s

2818
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:09,000
jazz and then the ripping

2819
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:11,000
tins changed everything the ripping

2820
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:13,000
tins are a group who have

2821
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,000
all of their album covers

2822
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:17,000
are this like have a

2823
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,000
cat daddy

2824
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,000
on them with like a big crazy

2825
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:23,000
he's like sort of like a you know he's

2826
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:25,000
like a joe camel who isn't

2827
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:27,000
like you know

2828
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:29,000
there isn't the toxic association

2829
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,000
camel but he does

2830
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:33,000
have the he is like a cool jazz

2831
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:35,000
guy and he's got a fedora in sunglasses

2832
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:37,000
definitely looks like a night owl

2833
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:39,000
jazz cat

2834
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:41,000
messy cat yeah not a

2835
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,000
gross cat like a leisure suit larry cat

2836
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:45,000
or yeah no he's

2837
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:47,000
he's wonderful and you're not you told me not only about

2838
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:49,000
like you made me aware of

2839
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,000
more ripping of the the disney ripping

2840
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,000
tins association but also there's a music

2841
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:55,000
video where the ripping tins cat comes

2842
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:57,000
to life oh yeah yep

2843
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:59,000
that's an incredible piece for a tourist

2844
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:01,000
in paradise they're probably their

2845
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:03,000
closest thing they have to a single and

2846
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:05,000
the cat I think is the voice of the part that's like

2847
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,000
ba ba ba baby baby

2848
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,000
that's one you can hum

2849
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:11,000
da da da da da da

2850
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:13,000
da da da it really is

2851
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:15,000
if listener if you don't understand what this is

2852
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:17,000
and why I like it I mean imagine

2853
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:19,000
like I think the closest way I could

2854
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:21,000
translate it is like do you

2855
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:23,000
like the tailspin theme

2856
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:25,000
and do you want a ton of instrumental music

2857
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,000
that's like the tailspin theme so true

2858
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:29,000
light tropical relaxation

2859
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:31,000
early nineties five this cat

2860
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:33,000
is a little lascivious yeah nowadays

2861
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:35,000
it's a it's a long long smile

2862
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:37,000
kind of a penis thing

2863
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:39,000
here oh wow he's opening for the hard

2864
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:41,000
oh god it's mike seeing his penises

2865
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:43,000
again I mean this is there's no doubt about it

2866
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:45,000
this is his arm and his finger

2867
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:47,000
you know what I'm saying that's not their first album

2868
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:49,000
look at a couple more variations on

2869
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:51,000
the ripping tins cat some of

2870
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:53,000
them don't know what I'm looking at there is

2871
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:55,000
kind of a penis in the ripping tins cat

2872
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:57,000
this is what mike does he ruins everything

2873
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:59,000
by seeing his subliminal penises everywhere

2874
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:01,000
by seeing the truth

2875
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:03,000
I see the truth is what's happening here

2876
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:05,000
is that this cat is a penis thing but you know what

2877
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:07,000
this car is a big dick

2878
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:09,000
this cat's driving a big dick car

2879
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:11,000
no it's a long yellow limo

2880
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:13,000
that's weekend in monaco that's good stuff

2881
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:15,000
that's a killer that's yeah yeah

2882
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:17,000
see for me mike I'm about the music

2883
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:19,000
not about the subliminal penises

2884
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:21,000
that in that case aren't on the cover

2885
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:23,000
that's not a big long penis mike

2886
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:25,000
I think that one is his yellow car

2887
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:27,000
it's just a cool yellow car

2888
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:29,000
but it's like kind of bent it's kind of like

2889
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:31,000
limp it's like a little where's the penis

2890
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:33,000
and curves ahead where he's skiing down a hill

2891
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:35,000
is it the purple ski

2892
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:37,000
is it because it's purple like a penis

2893
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:39,000
isn't really

2894
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:41,000
this one I don't know I don't know

2895
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:43,000
sorry we're fresh from a big penises in everything

2896
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,000
fight that maybe the listener hasn't

2897
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:47,000
heard yet stay tuned to the second gate

2898
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:49,000

penis everywhere

2900
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:53,000
that's my philosophy

2901
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:55,000
alright I'm getting a little heated I gotta cool down

2902
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:57,000
with some smooth jazz

2903
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:59,000

01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:07,000
available like Kim Pencil really

2908
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:09,000
really blew my mind

2909
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:11,000
P-E-N-S-Y-L

2910
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:13,000
yes confusingly even though his albums

2911
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:15,000
they're like a pencil pun in the album

2912
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:17,000
pencil sketches

2913
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:19,000
pencil sketches but it's spelled like his real name

2914
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:21,000
P-E-N-S-Y-L

2915
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:23,000
this is you know I like all this stuff too

2916
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:25,000
I was listening to a lot of ambient music

2917
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:27,000
kind of around the time

2918
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:29,000
we were all like

2919
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:31,000
listening to a lot of Japanese

2920
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:33,000
city pop

2921
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:35,000
also spotty on spotify

2922
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:37,000
like there's

2923
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:39,000
no almost none you gotta go to youtube

2924
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:41,000
some stuff is on apple music

2925
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:43,000
but some stuff yeah

2926
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:45,000
but

2927
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:47,000
ambient music I really

2928
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:49,000
like having it on and having it on

2929
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:51,000
in the background can't fall

2930
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:53,000
asleep to it

2931
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:55,000
I don't know it just starts to

2932
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:57,000
have the reverse effect

2933
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:59,000
of relaxing I don't know if

2934
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:01,000
it's changes in movements

2935
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:03,000
but sometimes it stresses

2936
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:05,000
me out well listen what I'm

2937
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:07,000
at some point in my

2938
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:09,000
loop I'm going to play a

2939
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:11,000
piece of music that is

2940
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:13,000
definitely that I became even more familiar

2941
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:15,000
with due to Kevin's Playlist Liminal Oasis

2942
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:17,000
and what I'm going to play is a guaranteed

2943
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:19,000
sleep aid

2944
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:21,000
relaxer the B piece of

2945
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:23,000
music of any I've ever

2946
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:25,000
found that is a path

2947
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:27,000
to the end of

2948
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:29,000
an anxious night like I've never

2949
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:31,000
found something that is more the key

2950
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:33,000
and if boy if I could help anybody

2951
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:35,000
with sleep anxiety out there if I

2952
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:37,000
if this piece has the magic

2953
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:39,000
that it has for me I would love

2954
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:41,000
to be able to pass this along which I need to get

2955
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:43,000
the link for that liminal oasis

2956
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:45,000
playlist because too many people are

2957
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:47,000
abusing the word liminal on spotify

2958
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:49,000
and even searching

2959
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:51,000
under playlists it's just

2960
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:53,000
impossible I felt a little bad

2961
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:55,000
using the word liminal

2962
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:57,000
because I feel like I see it

2963
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:59,000
used incorrectly or

2964
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:01,000
overused but I hope that when people

2965
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:03,000
listen to my playlist they deem it

2966
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,000
worthy of the word no I'm sure you've done

2967
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:07,000
the work on I'm sure you know it but

2968
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:09,000
it fits are you

2969
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:11,000
are you saying you're finding

2970
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:13,000
count like counterfeit liminal

2971
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:15,000
playlists a million playlists

2972
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:17,000
with the word liminal in it okay

2973
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:19,000
but it sounds like a cool

2974
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:21,000
word but it doesn't actually like

2975
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:23,000
Claire whereas I think you are this is

2976
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:25,000
you are describing all music that could play

2977
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,000
in a place that is somewhere between

2978
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:29,000
being open and closed yes yeah

2979
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:31,000
there's a lot of dead mall playlists

2980
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:33,000
style playlists yeah

2981
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:35,000
but you gotta you know look there's a lot of that

2982
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:37,000
just sounds too modern or something like

2983
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:39,000
I don't think they're really hitting the nail on the head with

2984
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:41,000
some of that like it being it's not

2985
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:43,000
because ball music isn't actually like

2986
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:45,000
weird and scary like I like

2987
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:47,000
vaporwave but that's not what actually plays

2988
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:49,000
at a mall like Rippington's are what plays

2989
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:51,000
at a mall this kind of music is what

2990
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:53,000
plays at the mall I'm gonna start getting into this

2991
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:55,000
this is

2992
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:57,000
what I have chosen a close cousin

2993
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:59,000
to interventions Tomorrowland

2994
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:01,000
1989 to 2003

2995
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:03,000
this is the music

2996
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:05,000
from Magic Kingdom Tomorrowland

2997
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:07,000
now I have a question about this

2998
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:09,000
which is like is this really what was still

2999
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:11,000
playing in the Buck Rogers

3000
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:13,000
94 era it doesn't kind of doesn't seem

3001
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:15,000
right to me it might be mislabeled well

3002
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:17,000
I have some stuff like that

3003
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:19,000
but also

3004
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:21,000
the one website

3005
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:23,000
that does a lot of

3006
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:25,000
retro WDW

3007
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:27,000
they have video from very early

3008
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:29,000
Tomorrowland 94 like

3009
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:31,000
it's not everything's open yet

3010
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:33,000
and they're playing like that

3011
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:35,000
music that plays

3012
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:37,000
when the looney tunes go to a

3013
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:39,000
factory oh really that's that

3014
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:41,000
dun dun da da da da

3015
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:43,000
da oh interesting and so

3016
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:45,000
I don't know if that was just placeholder or what

3017
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:47,000
on the people mover I don't want that

3018
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:49,000
but I have no memory of that

3019
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:51,000
no thank you I want the pure

3020
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:53,000
relaxation of what I'm

3021
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:55,000
gonna start playing here

3022
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:57,000
so and this is I've referred to

3023
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:59,000
this on the show before

3024
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:01,000
this is not the actual name but I saw

3025
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:03,000
YouTube comment refer to it as this

3026
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:05,000
and I can never unhear it it's what

3027
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:07,000
it is in my heart to me wherever

3028
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:09,000
it played this might have been I think some

3029
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:11,000
of this might have been in the Tokyo

3030
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:13,000
Tomorrowland in this era as well

3031
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:15,000
but what I will always know it as

3032
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:17,000
is the bubble shuffle loop

3033
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:19,000
and that is due to the first

3034
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:21,000
track bubble shuffle by

3035
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:23,000
Larry Carlton

3036
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:31,000
here it comes

3037
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:45,000
oh that little pad

3038
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:47,000
it's like is it space

3039
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:49,000
music I don't know maybe

3040
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:51,000
not but I

3041
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:53,000
like what it's doing to me

3042
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:01,000
this is really the good stuff

3043
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:03,000
did Larry Carlton play the solo

3044
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:05,000
on Steely Dan's Kid Charlemagne

3045
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:07,000
that is correct so Larry

3046
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:09,000
yeah Larry Carlton I finally I have a show

3047
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:11,000
sanctions excuse to talk about

3048
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:13,000
Steely Dan Steely Dan solo he's one of

3049
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:15,000
the great I mean all the greatest

3050
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:17,000
guitarists of the era you know

3051
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:19,000
tried to cut it with Dan and

3052
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:21,000
not everybody could but he was one of the

3053
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:23,000
best yeah he's

3054
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:25,000
Kid Charlemagne he's

3055
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:27,000
Don't Take Me Alive he's

3056
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:29,000
Third World Man I think he's on

3057
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:31,000
Josie many of

3058
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:33,000
the greats but this is from a solo

3059
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:35,000
album this is from a solo album

3060
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:37,000
I think from 1989

3061
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:39,000
called On Solid Ground

3062
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:41,000
and

3063
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:43,000
here's what's crazy about that yeah I think

3064
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:45,000
it's from 89 and what we're

3065
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:47,000
hearing is about as chill

3066
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:49,000
as you could imagine

3067
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:51,000
would you believe that midway

3068
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:53,000
through the making of this album was a

3069
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:55,000
heinous act of violence

3070
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:57,000
that almost threatened Larry Carlton's

3071
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:59,000
guitar playing career forever no

3072
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:01,000
I didn't know this it doesn't square with what we're

3073
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:03,000
listening to at all apparently he was literally

3074
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:05,000
halfway through the album and he was gonna

3075
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:07,000
pull an all-nighter and like get three more

3076
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:09,000
tracks out get this thing

3077
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:11,000
out into the public for their relaxation

3078
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:13,000
purposes he goes outside

3079
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:15,000
because he hears a weird sound like

3080
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:17,000
what's going on in the neighborhood and

3081
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:19,000
he's just randomly shot

3082
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:21,000
just like a teenager who's maybe

3083
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:23,000
trying to commit a robbery there or elsewhere

3084
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:25,000
just like

3085
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:27,000
startles him and he shoots

3086
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:29,000
him try to square that with

3087
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:31,000
this incredible solo as

3088
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:33,000
all Larry Carlton solos are

3089
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:35,000
hot yeah

3090
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:37,000
like and literally and just it's crazy that

3091
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:39,000
it was this album I never heard this about

3092
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:41,000
this man but then

3093
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:43,000
the album becomes half of it was

3094
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:45,000
in the can but then it becomes

3095
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:47,000
his like path

3096
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:49,000
to recuperation and to like

3097
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:51,000
yes I can play guitar again

3098
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:53,000
because he halfway

3099
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:55,000
through the album he wondered if he

3100
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:57,000
like it affected him exactly in the

3101
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:59,000
nerves where maybe he will never

3102
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:01,000
play guitar again and he described

3103
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:03,000
it as like he became a baby he had

3104
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:05,000
to like learn how to even

3105
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:07,000
hold the guitar and then within

3106
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:09,000
six months because he's a

3107
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:11,000
legend of all time he

3108
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:13,000
not only figured it out he got maybe better

3109
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:15,000
than he was before he

3110
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:17,000
re-recorded some of the tracks because he thought

3111
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:19,000
they didn't have the juice and now he's playing

3112
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:21,000
like with the post-shooting aggression

3113
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:23,000
he has stuff to like work out

3114
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:25,000
feelings to work out about the horrible

3115
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:27,000
thing that he went through

3116
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:29,000
and then he gets this album

3117
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:31,000
done proves that he is on solid

3118
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:33,000
ground still musically

3119
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:35,000
and lifestyle wise

3120
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:37,000
and then he

3121
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:39,000
does a benefit concert to

3122
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:41,000
help other like

3123
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:43,000
victims of random acts of violence

3124
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:45,000
like let's raise money for people

3125
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:47,000
where there is no specific like you don't know who

3126
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:49,000
the assailant is or why or why it happened

3127
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:51,000
he did a big concert raised a ton of money

3128
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:53,000
got his pals Michael McDonald and

3129
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:55,000
Joni Mitchell to come play because

3130
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:57,000
he's also the guitar on Help Me

3131
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:59,000
one of the biggest Joni Mitch so this is the

3132
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:01,000
true legend this guy then he goes

3133
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:03,000
and like does you know

3134
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:05,000
ton more benefits for that raises a ton of

3135
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:07,000
like this guy raised hundreds of thousands

3136
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:09,000
of dollars for people

3137
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:11,000
who were randomly attacked

3138
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:13,000
and then his music sounds

3139
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:15,000
this good and relaxing how about that

3140
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:17,000
broadcast news and newspapers were

3141
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:19,000
very obsessed with

3142
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:21,000
quote random acts of violence

3143
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:23,000
I feel like in the 90s

3144
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:25,000
well he proves that it wasn't a fake

3145
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:27,000
it was an actual

3146
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:29,000
concern it happened to

3147
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:31,000
we were almost robbed of

3148
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:33,000
this piece of I don't know if this track

3149
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:35,000
Bubble Shuffle was

3150
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:37,000
done pre-shooting or post-shooting

3151
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:39,000
but if it was post and if

3152
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:41,000
this random guy almost robbed the world

3153
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:43,000
of Bubble Shuffle and my favorite

3154
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:45,000
Disney music loop

3155
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:47,000
my god

3156
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:49,000
no amount of jail could

3157
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:51,000
be enough infinite life sentences

3158
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:53,000
for that but

3159
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:55,000
if that did happen you would at least

3160
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:57,000
so Bubble Shuffle I agree is the

3161
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:59,000
fulcrum of this Tomorrowland

3162
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:01,000
loop right it is

3163
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:03,000
it is a center piece

3164
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:05,000
what a title incredible title this is what I would

3165
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:07,000
very creatively call

3166
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:09,000
a playlist

3167
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:11,000
area loop where it's really just a playlist

3168
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:13,000
of uh this is true

3169
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:15,000
it is not it's not

3170
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:17,000
composed I mean similar to

3171
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:19,000
Wonders of Life I would say like like yeah

3172
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:21,000
there is not always like a it's a little

3173
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:23,000
bit more of like a little curated mix

3174
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:25,000
yes and I

3175
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:27,000
whoever was on

3176
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:29,000
this task of curating

3177
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:31,000
area loop playlists in

3178
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:33,000
the late 80s

3179
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:35,000
early 90s was

3180
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:37,000
kicking ass at it

3181
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:39,000
and they clearly just had a

3182
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:41,000
I would love to know the full process was

3183
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:43,000
it an Imagineer

3184
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:45,000
I heard a small thing

3185
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:47,000
from Imagineer

3186
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:49,000
Eddie Soto

3187
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:51,000
he's very on line yeah yeah he gives us

3188
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:53,000
a lot of factoids yeah selecting

3189
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:55,000
the music for Frontierland

3190
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:57,000
and Main Street I found a

3191
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:59,000
snippet about that

3192
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:01,000
but I don't

3193
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:03,000
know if is he the mastermind behind

3194
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:05,000
the Wonders of Life and Tomorrowland

3195
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:07,000
or was it like up to like who's

3196
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:09,000
in charge of the land or what

3197
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:11,000
or do they hire

3198
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:13,000
like a music supervisor like

3199
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:15,000
a movie would like somebody to pick the tracks

3200
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:17,000
who's like because you need some you

3201
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:19,000
know to find some of these that you know to find

3202
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:21,000
Inside the Sky

3203
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:23,000
by Steve Hahn you know

3204
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:25,000
you need it's gotta be somebody

3205
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:27,000
who knows like a hundred

3206
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:29,000
thousand albums you're not just gonna chance

3207
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:31,000
into these tracks I think some of

3208
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:33,000
this stuff and Kevin I do have

3209
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:35,000
to tell you when you said does so

3210
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:37,000
and so play on the Steely Dan record

3211
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:39,000
we should probably put a chapter marker there

3212
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:41,000
because like half the audience gonna be

3213
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:43,000
like pumping their fist and half

3214
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:45,000
are gonna be like oh I'm gonna come back

3215
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:47,000
later I'm gonna put on something

3216
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:49,000
or who is this half

3217
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:51,000
show yourselves name yourselves

3218
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:53,000
but what I was gonna say

3219
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:55,000
was like yes some of this stuff

3220
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:57,000
statistically

3221
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:59,000
some of this stuff has

3222
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:01,000
to have been made by someone

3223
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:03,000
going oh shit we needed that

3224
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:05,000
yesterday yeah

3225
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:07,000
who can we call who's a ringer

3226
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:09,000
who can turn this around in

3227
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:11,000
48 hours that's true

3228
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:13,000
yeah no it might be yeah it could

3229
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:15,000
be a rush job it could be somebody who was barely

3230
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:17,000
paid or not at all I didn't

3231
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:19,000
I don't know if I was like

3232
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:21,000
15 or like 21 before

3233
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:23,000
I realized you could make music

3234
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:25,000
and not care about it is a

3235
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:27,000
concept like music to me

3236
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:29,000
felt like it was so important and it must

3237
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:31,000
just be pouring from like the deepest

3238
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:33,000
recesses of your mind

3239
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:35,000
so the idea that like oh yeah people are on

3240
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:37,000
maybe it was the Ben Fold song

3241
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:39,000
One Down is that what it's called

3242
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:41,000
about finishing his contract out

3243
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:43,000
and finishing the song when I realized oh

3244
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:45,000
this is a job

3245
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:47,000
for some people now hang on we are not

3246
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:49,000
there is I don't want

3247
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:51,000
to hear it said I'm not saying that Larry Carlton

3248
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:53,000
doesn't care I think I think you're describing

3249
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:55,000
selecting the playlist well yeah

3250
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:57,000
selecting the I found

3251
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:59,000
I've mentioned this before

3252
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:01,000
but there's a podcast

3253
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:03,000
episode the unofficial Universal

3254
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:05,000
Orlando podcast

3255
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:07,000
the music of Marvel superhero

3256
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:09,000
island with composer

3257
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:11,000
Howard Drossin

3258
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:13,000
and he is

3259
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:15,000
like pretty up front

3260
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:17,000
about this from 2016

3261
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:19,000
and he's very up front

3262
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:21,000
you're going to say that he's never gone to

3263
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:23,000
Marvel superhero island right yes

3264
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:25,000
you've told us we've heard this one before

3265
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:27,000
you can't believe this

3266
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:29,000
well he I just

3267
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:31,000
less that he could have gone but more

3268
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:33,000
that the anecdote of like I have

3269
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:35,000
couple teenagers would they like it

3270
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:37,000
and it's like yes there's a giant roller

3271
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:39,000
coaster but just when he's

3272
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:41,000
like yeah I think I have the mini the

3273
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:43,000
original mini discs around

3274
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:45,000
here somewhere with that music

3275
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:47,000
this sticks in your groin

3276
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:49,000
this is what I'm saying where you're

3277
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:51,000
allowed him on hallowed ground you're 12 years

3278
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:53,000
old and you're just like this must be

3279
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:55,000
this man's passion project who

3280
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:57,000
composed all this music he cares

3281
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:59,000
so much about spider-man well but then

3282
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:01,000
they sold the souvenir

3283
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:03,000
CD with track by track

3284
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:05,000
all the original music

3285
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:07,000
I hate to tell you he didn't give a shit about Marvel

3286
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:09,000
superhero island it was a gig

3287
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:11,000
he jerked it off basically

3288
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:13,000
this is Jason learning

3289
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:15,000
for the first time that anyone doesn't give

3290
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:17,000
a shit about Marvel superhero island I was

3291
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:19,000
hoping you'd bring this part up

3292
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:21,000
about the main what's his name say his name

3293
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:23,000
Howard Drozin

3294
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:25,000
hey Howard fuck you not caring

3295
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:27,000
about Marvel at all

3296
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:29,000
you warped this innocent young brain

3297
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:31,000
I'm trying to give him his flowers

3298
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:33,000
he doesn't deserve it he didn't put the passion

3299
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:35,000
into that music that's what I think

3300
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:37,000
people are booing because a steely Dan

3301
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:39,000
guitarist was mentioned and then we're praising

3302
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:41,000
Howard Drozin despite him

3303
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:43,000
jizzing all over the most sacred

3304
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:45,000
property in land

3305
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:47,000
jizzing in a bad way

3306
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:49,000
not to create life

3307
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:51,000
that's what I'm saying

3308
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:53,000
the only reason to jizz

3309
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:55,000
do we like the Marvel

3310
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:57,000
super sorry to interrupt the Tomorrowland

3311
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:59,000
yes I do yes I like it

3312
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:01,000
breaks his computer while saying it

3313
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:03,000
yes that is the perfect music

3314
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:05,000
but we do like it

3315
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:07,000
I like it

3316
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:09,000
in the context of Marvel superhero island

3317
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:11,000
but I don't know that I like it

3318
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:13,000
outside of that context yeah it's very

3319
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:15,000
intense it's hard rock

3320
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:17,000
yeah the hardest rock

3321
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:19,000
but I don't know that it's

3322
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:21,000
I don't know that it's like something I listen to otherwise

3323
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:23,000
I don't know

3324
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:25,000
Jason demanded that it be his wedding

3325
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:27,000
march

3326
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:29,000
brings the bluetooth speaker

3327
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:31,000
it was the call to adventure

3328
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:33,000
because why what greater

3329
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:35,000
adventure is there than that of

3330
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:37,000
matrimony

3331
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:39,000
alright I'm going to

3332
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:41,000
play a little bit more of this I don't have

3333
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:43,000
to do a ton but I do just want to get a quick

3334
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:45,000
hit of night fire dance

3335
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:47,000
Andreas Wallenweider

3336
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:49,000
wow you had it

3337
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:51,000
that you know the artist

3338
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:53,000
German heart declare

3339
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:55,000
German heart declare

3340
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:57,000
down to the moon

3341
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:59,000
this is what I'm talking about these synth voicings

3342
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:01,000
we're like not afraid to be a little cheesy

3343
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:05,000
little mark mother's bow

3344
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:07,000
yes a little penis playoffs

3345
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:11,000
because they love this is the

3346
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:13,000
it's a dangerous time synth wise

3347
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:15,000
it's late 80's where people realize they can sample

3348
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:17,000
a voice and then do

3349
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:19,000
wah wah wah wah I am a voice

3350
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:21,000
who is a keyboard

3351
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:23,000
but there's a lot of love

3352
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:25,000
Todd regerman a whole album that way which is wonderful

3353
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:27,000
this whole album

3354
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:29,000
is very fun

3355
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:31,000
down to the moon yeah

3356
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:33,000
kind of all sounds like this

3357
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:35,000
if you like this always sounds like

3358
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:37,000
lowrider to me

3359
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:41,000
which probably was intentional

3360
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:43,000
I love you also just

3361
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:45,000
this genre of music names itself

3362
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:47,000
perfectly the album down to the moon

3363
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:49,000
the songs moon dance

3364
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:51,000
steam forest

3365
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:53,000
silver wheel steam forest

3366
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:55,000
hush patients at bamboo forest

3367
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:57,000
hush patients

3368
01:54:57,000 --> 01:54:59,000
this is pre ai

3369
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:01,000
like nowadays chat gbt

3370
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:03,000
would probably tell you all these

3371
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:05,000
think of these names for you

3372
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:09,000
this I feel like I gotta make it

3373
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:11,000
to the weird little solo that comes

3374
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:13,000
is it this

3375
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:15,000
there's some change in this too

3376
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:19,000
love this

3377
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:21,000
wah wah wah I'm in the future

3378
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:23,000
this is a wonderful future

3379
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:25,000
that really feels video game

3380
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:27,000
ish to me

3381
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:29,000
it would score a level that like

3382
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:31,000
is just like you're in a forest

3383
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:33,000
but then something like glitches

3384
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:35,000
there's like that

3385
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:37,000
the very strange synth sound

3386
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:39,000
what's the I can't think of anything today

3387
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:41,000
on a midi keyboard where you push

3388
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:43,000
the wheel up and down

3389
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:45,000
the pitch bend thank you

3390
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:47,000
it feels like that and it feels like you would score

3391
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:49,000
a video game level where you're in a forest but then

3392
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:51,000
some weird like color shoots

3393
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:53,000
out of the ground or the screen glitches

3394
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:55,000
or like there's something odd about this

3395
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:57,000
forest hey mike I'm gonna give you a little

3396
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:59,000
credit here I don't think anyone's gonna give you a tough

3397
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:01,000
time for not remembering

3398
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:03,000
what the wheel the tiny

3399
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:05,000
wheel on a midi keyboard is called

3400
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:07,000
Jason hates music stuff that's what we're finding

3401
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:09,000
right now people are booing about stealing

3402
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:11,000
people are booing about the pitch bend

3403
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:13,000
what is this hate

3404
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:15,000
I hate music I hate pitch bends

3405
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:17,000
Jason has good taste in music

3406
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:19,000
I appreciate what he was gonna say

3407
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:21,000
but I bet there are people

3408
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:23,000
that are going it's a god damn pitch wheel

3409
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:25,000
it's easy

3410
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:27,000
you were trying to make me feel better

3411
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:29,000
but now I feel worse

3412
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:31,000
there's a lot of people throwing their phones

3413
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:33,000
at the wall like how do you not know

3414
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:35,000
pitch bend

3415
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:37,000
I think from what I've heard you might have the hippest

3416
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:39,000
music taste of the host

3417
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:41,000
I'm sorry

3418
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:43,000
Jane has the

3419
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:45,000
hippest music taste

3420
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:47,000
Jane has the hippest

3421
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:49,000
Jane can detect stuff

3422
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:51,000
and knows all the songwriters

3423
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:53,000
you don't have to give that to me

3424
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:55,000
because I have no concerns about being hip

3425
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:57,000
I gave it up a while ago

3426
01:56:57,000 --> 01:56:59,000
I learned the name Max Martin

3427
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:01,000
last year

3428
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:03,000
Max Martin was a hit maker of our time

3429
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:05,000
well I knew the hits of our time

3430
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:07,000
but I didn't know all the team behind it

3431
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:09,000
are you into what's his name Benson Boone

3432
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:11,000
is that his name the guy in the jumpsuit that sings

3433
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:13,000
is he the back flipping guy

3434
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:15,000
yeah

3435
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:17,000
is it hip to be into Benson Boone

3436
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:19,000
or is that just the most popular music

3437
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:21,000
I prefer Bunsen Honeydew

3438
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:23,000
I can get on with that

3439
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:25,000
I'm not going to argue with that

3440
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:27,000
Selena Gomez's fiance is

3441
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:29,000
Benny Blanco

3442
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:31,000
he's not Benson Boone

3443
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:33,000
of his name I've been making for weeks

3444
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:35,000
that's right no two different guys

3445
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:37,000
well let me do another one of those

3446
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:39,000
and say that the track that I now must play

3447
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:41,000
this is not by

3448
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:43,000
recent guest Paul Scheer

3449
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:45,000
it is by Paul Spear

3450
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:47,000
and David Lans

3451
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:49,000
this is from the album Natural States

3452
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:51,000
the track is Behind the Waterfall

3453
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:53,000
this is what I referred to

3454
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:55,000
as a go to sleep aid

3455
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:57,000
this almost feels too

3456
01:57:57,000 --> 01:57:59,000
personal at this point to play

3457
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:01,000
for you all and on the podcast

3458
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:03,000
but we've discussed Behind the Waterfall

3459
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:05,000
we've been Behind the Waterfall many times

3460
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:07,000
the backside of water

3461
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:09,000
wow it ties together

3462
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:11,000
I don't think they're related

3463
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:13,000
here we go

3464
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:21,000
Scott your eyelids

3465
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:23,000
they look like they're drooping

3466
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:25,000
oh here comes Rem

3467
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:27,000
sleep shakes

3468
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:31,000
if we could all catch a quick two minutes

3469
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:33,000
yeah that's fine we should be allowed

3470
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:35,000
we do long episodes let's all just

3471
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:37,000
close your eyes everyone

3472
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:39,000
a little exercise my nose is a little stuffed up

3473
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:41,000
so if I try to breathe through I'm sorry

3474
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:43,000
it's the allergies

3475
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:45,000
in California that I get

3476
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:47,000
you gotta try Flonase

3477
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:49,000
I heard about this Flonase

3478
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:51,000
thing and I do think I should try it

3479
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:53,000
don't I swear if you talk about CVS

3480
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:55,000
kind of bullshit over my favorite track

3481
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:57,000
it's probably where you get it though

3482
01:58:57,000 --> 01:58:59,000
if you can get a first catch up for

3483
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:01,000
Flonase in Zartek it's cheaper than

3484
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:03,000
UTC oh really

3485
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:05,000
this song

3486
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:07,000
really does have healing powers though

3487
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:09,000
it's helping me ignore everything

3488
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:11,000
that's being said right now Jason do you think

3489
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:13,000
you could just get me that prescription

3490
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:15,000
I don't want to feel like going into a doctor

3491
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:19,000
this is me at night going like

3492
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:21,000
I can't sleep I don't know what am I doing

3493
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:23,000
I'm on a podcast where there's tangents about

3494
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:25,000
CVS and people say things like

3495
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:27,000
stinky urethra and that'll be

3496
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:29,000
20 minutes of the episode

3497
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:31,000
every week but you know what it's okay because

3498
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:33,000
if I can calm down if I can calm down

3499
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:35,000
oh and now a new

3500
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:37,000
instrument is playing

3501
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:39,000
I think this is a very tasteful

3502
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:41,000
the call of the elk

3503
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:43,000
I don't know it sounds like

3504
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:45,000
you imagine

3505
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:47,000
you imagine an elk walked up

3506
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:49,000
that's the elk's voice

3507
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:51,000
I said look I see

3508
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:53,000
I see things when I hear music

3509
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:55,000
what can I tell you

3510
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:57,000
anything is valid anything that you feel in this natural

3511
01:59:57,000 --> 01:59:59,000
this is from the omnipresent

3512
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:01,000
it's a new age

3513
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:03,000
record label Nerada

3514
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:05,000
and I was going to say

3515
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:07,000
I think maybe whoever was curating these loops

3516
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:09,000
maybe wasn't just going off

3517
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:11,000
the whole world of music maybe they

3518
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:13,000
knew Nerada and their imprint

3519
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:15,000
Nerada Mystique

3520
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:17,000
and also Windham Hill

3521
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:19,000
or Nerada Equinox

3522
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:21,000
which is what this is from

3523
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:23,000
they had a Nerada Insider

3524
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:25,000
and Nerada Milwaukee based

3525
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:27,000
label

3526
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:29,000
I assume this was like that their headquarters

3527
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:31,000
were at the top of the Himalayas

3528
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:33,000
Nerada is

3529
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:35,000
was in Wisconsin

3530
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:37,000
and I only

3531
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:39,000
know this because on the cassettes for these

3532
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:41,000
albums a lot of which I have the address is

3533
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:43,000
on there and it's on like I think North Farwell

3534
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:45,000
Street in Milwaukee where

3535
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:47,000
is now a pizza

3536
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:49,000
restaurant called Pizza Shuttle

3537
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:53,000
wow all the world's new age

3538
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:55,000
music came from the pizza shuttle

3539
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:57,000
and I've been to pizza shuttle

3540
02:00:57,000 --> 02:00:59,000
many times

3541
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:01,000
they have pinball machines there

3542
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:03,000
what kind of pie are we talking about

3543
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:05,000
I don't remember that

3544
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:07,000
I can't remember

3545
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:09,000
I'll let it

3546
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:11,000
wrap up there

3547
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:13,000
I highly recommend that

3548
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:15,000
where in the park would you find that

3549
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:17,000
that's still tomorrow

3550
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:19,000
and that track was also

3551
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:21,000
in Wonders of Life

3552
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:23,000
that was shared between what was potentially yours

3553
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:25,000
some of these did repeat

3554
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:27,000
here and there there's not that many repeats

3555
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:29,000
but I feel like they

3556
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:31,000
picked the tracks the best tracks

3557
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:33,000
to repeat behind the waterfall being in

3558
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:35,000
multiple places do you think the

3559
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:37,000
guy who knew Nerada

3560
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:39,000
do you think he just spread

3561
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:41,000
it like stretched it like

3562
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:43,000
divvied it out really

3563
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:45,000
like really stretched out his

3564
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:47,000
billable hours

3565
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:49,000
he didn't tell them right away about

3566
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:51,000
the label Nerada I'll have to search far

3567
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:53,000
and wide for music that fits these themes

3568
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:55,000
I'll have to travel to lands

3569
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:57,000
far and near

3570
02:01:57,000 --> 02:01:59,000
I imagine it will take me three months

3571
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:01,000
with a musical sherpa

3572
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:03,000
another three month contract

3573
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:05,000
I believe is due

3574
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:07,000
well they chose beautifully

3575
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:09,000
I do have to thank for your playlist

3576
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:11,000
here's what I'll do I'll go to your

3577
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:13,000
playlist I'll start with that

3578
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:15,000
that's the base and then I'll just let it

3579
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:17,000
randomize take me somewhere else

3580
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:19,000
in this liminal oasis and it really

3581
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:21,000
and my like there's been bad sleep

3582
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:23,000
anxiety for sure for the last five years or so this thing

3583
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:25,000
this always does it I will say

3584
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:27,000
I don't think it's I'm glad you're

3585
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:29,000
having luck with it for sleep because it wasn't designed

3586
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:31,000
for sleep necessarily

3587
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:33,000
suddenly there will be like

3588
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:35,000
some samba comes in

3589
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:37,000
but I don't

3590
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:39,000
hold that against you because it's not made for

3591
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:41,000
sleep but a lot of it does work a lot of it

3592
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:43,000
definitely does liminal sleep oasis would be

3593
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:45,000
a good branch maybe I could start my

3594
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:47,000
own Nerada mystique oh yeah

3595
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:49,000
imprint of my of my playlist

3596
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:51,000
you should be the new and oh and we should

3597
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:53,000
say I mean that was the that was the inspiration

3598
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:55,000
for your opening track

3599
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:57,000
which I knew as soon as I heard it like

3600
02:02:57,000 --> 02:02:59,000
oh my god he this this

3601
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:01,000
this motherfucker just David

3602
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:03,000
Lansd our theme song

3603
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:05,000
and I couldn't be more honored you know

3604
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:07,000
you nerated us and I

3605
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:09,000
I thank you for that happy happy

3606
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:11,000
to do it there's a really good live video

3607
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:13,000
of David Lansd and Paul Spear playing

3608
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:15,000
that song oh and

3609
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:17,000
I was surprised to see that I think

3610
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:19,000
Paul Spear

3611
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:21,000
cause David Lansd plays piano and he's playing

3612
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:23,000
a synth I think it's like a DX

3613
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:25,000
7 synth then I think Spear

3614
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:27,000
is playing an acoustic electric

3615
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:29,000
guitar

3616
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:31,000
which is interesting and it's making a very nice

3617
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:33,000
sound and they both

3618
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:35,000
look I think they're wearing baggy sleeves

3619
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:37,000
and probably some like crystals and then there's

3620
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:39,000
a dude that

3621
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:41,000
not David Lansd or Paul Spear there's a dude

3622
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:43,000
just going

3623
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:45,000
like hog wild on some bongos

3624
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:47,000
so you gotta have that

3625
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:49,000
the Rippingsons has one of the great

3626
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:51,000
like pony tailed

3627
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:53,000
gourd shakers

3628
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:55,000
the guy with the big you gotta have a big

3629
02:03:55,000 --> 02:03:57,000
gourd with a net on it

3630
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:59,000
and the beginning of the video is like

3631
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:01,000
you know desert sands tour

3632
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:03,000
or something

3633
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:05,000
sold out show in Mexico

3634
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:07,000
city and it's like this giant

3635
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:09,000
like seemingly like amphitheater

3636
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:11,000
arena and it really looks like

3637
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:13,000
it's sold out so this must have been

3638
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:15,000
semi big maybe it was a festival

3639
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:17,000
or something but people were out there

3640
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:19,000
for Lansd and Spear playing behind the waterfall

3641
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:21,000
a lot

3642
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:23,000
I am glad that is the case

3643
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:25,000
are these guys still around?

3644
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:27,000
David Lansd is

3645
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:29,000
definitely I don't know if

3646
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:31,000
he still makes music

3647
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:33,000
that's such a good idea Mike

3648
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:35,000
I don't know

3649
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:37,000
are they more appropriate for

3650
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:39,000
the garden rocks or eat to the beat

3651
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:41,000
I don't know which event

3652
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:43,000
or for just have them play live next to Walt

3653
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:45,000
have them sit down next to

3654
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:47,000
the sitting Walt cause that's where their music

3655
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:49,000
belongs

3656
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:51,000
you don't rock out the way you do to

3657
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:53,000
you know Smash Mouth

3658
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:55,000
with New Singer

3659
02:04:55,000 --> 02:04:57,000
that's what Eat to the Beat is for

3660
02:04:57,000 --> 02:04:59,000
they replaced poor Steve so god damn

3661
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:01,000
fast

3662
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:03,000
like they had a guy in mind

3663
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:05,000
he like passed away and it was like

3664
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:07,000
Smash Mouth is on the road

3665
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:09,000
they were able to audition them very fast

3666
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:11,000
cause the audition was just like

3667
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:13,000
sing the word some

3668
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:15,000
they needed all that

3669
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:17,000
somebody just go some

3670
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:19,000
they had a hallway

3671
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:21,000
of people all tuning up

3672
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:23,000
some some some

3673
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:25,000
wait I don't got it let me try again

3674
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:27,000
next

3675
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:29,000
Smash Mouth is good

3676
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:31,000
anyway this is the kind of thing

3677
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:33,000
you text each other

3678
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:35,000
yeah you guys hang out at the Astro Lans

3679
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:37,000
you're waiting for this

3680
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:39,000
Epcot should

3681
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:41,000
start having its own Astro Lounge

3682
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:43,000
there is a bar coming

3683
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:45,000
around Spaceship Earth

3684
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:47,000
what better to call it

3685
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:49,000
it's a literal Astro Lounge

3686
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:51,000
play the Innoventions loop in the Spaceship Earth

3687
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:53,000
Bar and Lounge

3688
02:05:53,000 --> 02:05:55,000
why not either you could have some random piece of music

3689
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:57,000
or you could have something that people would appreciate

3690
02:05:57,000 --> 02:05:59,000
that's old school that takes you there and in my case

3691
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:01,000
puts you to sleep

3692
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:03,000
alright well I've got the aux cord now

3693
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:05,000
I'm going to stay in the Tomorrowland

3694
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:07,000
Neck of the Woods

3695
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:09,000
and I will eventually get to some

3696
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:11,000
new agey stuff for another loop

3697
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:13,000
but let's jump into something

3698
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:15,000
very

3699
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:17,000
goofy

3700
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:19,000
you said earlier goofy and a little jaunty

3701
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:23,000
yes

3702
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:25,000
I've put this on as a relaxer before

3703
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:27,000
this is a real

3704
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:29,000
we've all we all know this I think

3705
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:31,000
if we're the theme park people

3706
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:33,000
yeah so this is a loop

3707
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:35,000
I would date this

3708
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:37,000
to the later

3709
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:39,000
90s Kevin you mentioned

3710
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:41,000
there is some

3711
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:43,000
Randy Newman

3712
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:45,000
like remix Toy Story Randy Newman

3713
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:47,000
and I've got some of the remixed

3714
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:49,000
songs

3715
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:51,000
queued up

3716
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:55,000
but more for the theme

3717
02:06:55,000 --> 02:06:57,000
park kind of remix

3718
02:06:57,000 --> 02:06:59,000
but some of this

3719
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:01,000
stuff I'm not sure if it's like well I don't know

3720
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:03,000
if that's Rocket to the Moon

3721
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:05,000
because I was not alive

3722
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:07,000
for that right

3723
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:09,000
or I guess I was alive for that one

3724
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:11,000
I was alive for Mars

3725
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:13,000
Mission to Mars but not

3726
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:15,000
Rocket to the Moon but some of this

3727
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:17,000
stuff just sounds like

3728
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:19,000
kind of fun retro-y

3729
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:21,000
sci-fi

3730
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:23,000
spacey so

3731
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:25,000
what park we think here this is

3732
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:27,000
Disney World this is the grand

3733
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:29,000
that's Miracle for Molecules

3734
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:31,000
playing right there

3735
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:33,000
Miracles for Molecules

3736
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:35,000
from Inner Space

3737
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:37,000
yeah that's the song yeah

3738
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:39,000
I don't know that song well enough to know that

3739
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:41,000
from wait

3740
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:43,000
from Adventures Through Inner Space

3741
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:45,000
Miracles from Molecules

3742
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:47,000
just a little

3743
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:49,000
reference

3744
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:51,000
so this is the thing they do now a little bit is like

3745
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:53,000
reincorporate you know

3746
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:55,000
Great Big Beautiful Tomorrow

3747
02:07:55,000 --> 02:07:57,000
from Retired Attractions that's fun

3748
02:07:57,000 --> 02:07:59,000
which if you have to

3749
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:01,000
if that's how we get new original

3750
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:03,000
music or you know

3751
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:05,000
newly arranged music

3752
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:07,000
in the parks yeah it has to be IP

3753
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:09,000
or like like

3754
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:11,000
the Toontown or the Tomorrowland one

3755
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:13,000
you're sharing like I'm fine with that well they made all

3756
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:15,000
this cool music for Tomorrowland

3757
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:17,000
2055 that leaked somehow

3758
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:19,000
that maybe was recorded off of a bathroom

3759
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:21,000
speaker but like a never built

3760
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:23,000
redo for Disneyland

3761
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:25,000
this is so

3762
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:27,000
for some reason like just the music

3763
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:29,000
leaked and it's a bunch of like very

3764
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:31,000
stirring orchestral covers of

3765
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:33,000
songs from Tomorrowland past

3766
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:35,000
they started playing

3767
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:37,000
they played it in a

3768
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:39,000
they tested the music in a Tomorrowland bathroom

3769
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:41,000
for some reason

3770
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:43,000
this is going to be the score for the whole land

3771
02:08:43,000 --> 02:08:45,000
and they decided let's play it in the bathroom and that's the only

3772
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:47,000
remnant of this never built

3773
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:49,000
Tomorrowland version and somebody happened to be

3774
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:51,000
taking a shit with an induction

3775
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:53,000
recording microphone and yeah in

3776
02:08:53,000 --> 02:08:55,000
1994 yeah

3777
02:08:55,000 --> 02:08:57,000
uploading that to the internet just brought the tape recorder

3778
02:08:57,000 --> 02:08:59,000
to the shitter with him like oh thank god

3779
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:01,000
because you mentioned it here is

3780
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:03,000
the ramp up

3781
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:05,000
to great big beautiful

3782
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:07,000
tomorrow oh this is good stuff I know

3783
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:09,000
the ramp up this is where you get like psyched

3784
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:15,000
so peppy it is peppy

3785
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:17,000
it's just it gives me the

3786
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:19,000
imagery in my mind of shooting stars

3787
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:21,000
and the astro

3788
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:23,000
like the little

3789
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:25,000
it feels like the little things go sailing

3790
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:27,000
we got some of those

3791
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:29,000
in our intro little

3792
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:31,000
things that feel like shooting

3793
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:33,000
stars inspiration for your

3794
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:35,000
as I was dissecting that by the way

3795
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:37,000
listening to just making sure

3796
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:39,000
I knew for my

3797
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:41,000
variation on it I was admiring

3798
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:43,000
your handiwork there

3799
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:45,000
I don't even know I'd have to go back and look

3800
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:47,000
at what that is

3801
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:49,000
the other one

3802
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:53,000
now is the time right

3803
02:09:53,000 --> 02:09:55,000

3804
02:09:55,000 --> 02:09:57,000

of progress theme yes

3806
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:01,000
and then a great big

3807
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:03,000
beautiful tomorrow comes back

3808
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:05,000
but this was

3809
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:07,000
for a brand new

3810
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:09,000
like buy the appliances now

3811
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:11,000
song

3812
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:13,000
yeah this is a great loop

3813
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:15,000
and as far as I know they still play

3814
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:17,000
some of this in tomorrowland

3815
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:19,000
you can hear a lot of it

3816
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:21,000
on the people mover

3817
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:23,000
yeah is there

3818
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:25,000
strange things from

3819
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:27,000
the toy story soundtrack on there

3820
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:29,000
or am I thinking of something I've heard that somewhere

3821
02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:31,000
yeah I've heard it somewhere maybe it's not on this

3822
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:33,000
I've heard it in disneyland that is on

3823
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:35,000
here yeah yeah does this same music

3824
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:37,000
show up in disneyland tomorrowland

3825
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:39,000
it feels right

3826
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:41,000
so here's one more

3827
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:43,000
theme park

3828
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:45,000
oh wow

3829
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:51,000
this is if you had wings

3830
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:53,000
but it's really spacey

3831
02:10:55,000 --> 02:10:57,000
really

3832
02:10:57,000 --> 02:10:59,000
really emotional

3833
02:10:59,000 --> 02:11:01,000
yeah and this bears some sonic

3834
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:03,000
similarities to the new age

3835
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:05,000
music of the other loops

3836
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:07,000
but it's just a little bit more

3837
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:09,000
goofy wacky

3838
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:11,000
the sci-fi is more

3839
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:13,000
jazz I mean in a way the

3840
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:15,000
smooth jazz as tomorrowland music

3841
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:17,000
makes no sense but I

3842
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:19,000
I like the kind of future

3843
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:21,000
they're imagining a chill

3844
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:23,000
future which increasingly we're not in

3845
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:25,000
and I feel like that was a listen

3846
02:11:25,000 --> 02:11:27,000
to more jazz I feel like that was a pitch bend

3847
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:29,000
don't tell this guy about

3848
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:31,000
those little pitch bends he doesn't like

3849
02:11:31,000 --> 02:11:33,000
I was trying to do something nice

3850
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:35,000
I was calling out a pitch bend

3851
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:37,000
it's not mine I was just trying to say

3852
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:39,000
this is just a fun loop

3853
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:41,000
yeah yeah it's really fun

3854
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:43,000
I mean it's a lot of circuits it sounds like circuits

3855
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:45,000
beep boop music

3856
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:47,000
a robot would listen to when the robots

3857
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:49,000
go on the ride but it's not like

3858
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:51,000
outekr or some sort of like

3859
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:53,000
crazy beep boop music it's not harsh

3860
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:55,000
yeah yeah it's

3861
02:11:55,000 --> 02:11:57,000
beep boop music for the children

3862
02:11:57,000 --> 02:11:59,000
for kids for kids yeah now this is the other

3863
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:01,000
one and we're getting more

3864
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:03,000
new agey oh

3865
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:05,000
my god this is my

3866
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:07,000
sleep this is my sleep music

3867
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:09,000
this is well

3868
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:11,000
this is like a 36

3869
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:13,000
minute loop and it says

3870
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:15,000
the youtube

3871
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:17,000
video was named islands of adventure

3872
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:19,000
entrance loop ocean

3873
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:21,000
trader market

3874
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:23,000
ocean trader market you can find on

3875
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:25,000
the official islands of adventure album

3876
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:27,000
it's like just under

3877
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:29,000
3 minutes but this one has

3878
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:31,000
a lot more

3879
02:12:31,000 --> 02:12:33,000
flourishes

3880
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:35,000
I feel like this should be like

3881
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:37,000
bell in beauty and the beast

3882
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:39,000
or like little town

3883
02:12:39,000 --> 02:12:41,000
it does kind of sound like that

3884
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:43,000
Jason should be doing the lyrics

3885
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:45,000
Jason should be singing about like he's in the morning

3886
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:47,000
and he's getting Cinnabon

3887
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:49,000
here I am

3888
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:51,000
lighting up my long cigarette

3889
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:53,000
yeah this is

3890
02:12:53,000 --> 02:12:55,000
cigarette smoking music isn't it

3891
02:12:55,000 --> 02:12:57,000
the bubble order is taking too long

3892
02:12:57,000 --> 02:12:59,000
some of the music not just

3893
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:01,000
this but some of the other music today

3894
02:13:01,000 --> 02:13:03,000
reminded me of the term

3895
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:05,000
from the 80s

3896
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:07,000
and 90s I don't know

3897
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:09,000
when people coin the term

3898
02:13:09,000 --> 02:13:11,000
changes a little

3899
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:13,000
but global village

3900
02:13:13,000 --> 02:13:15,000
coffee house have you encountered

3901
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:17,000
this oh I love the aesthetic

3902
02:13:17,000 --> 02:13:19,000
you're showing me here yeah well it's very

3903
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:21,000
how do you I mean it's sort of like it's kind

3904
02:13:21,000 --> 02:13:23,000
of in the borders bookstore zone

3905
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:25,000
that's the kind of art that would be on a coffee

3906
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:27,000
cup Atlantic dance hall

3907
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:29,000
as I showed you oh right

3908
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:31,000
what you described as yearbook

3909
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:33,000
art yeah like yearbook core but that's

3910
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:35,000
maybe a little bit different than

3911
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:37,000
global village coffee global village

3912
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:39,000
coffee shop yeah global village

3913
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:41,000
coffee shop or global coffee

3914
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:43,000
shop this was a thing

3915
02:13:43,000 --> 02:13:45,000
that as I was googling it earlier

3916
02:13:45,000 --> 02:13:47,000
in the episode people were

3917
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:49,000
talking about it catching on on

3918
02:13:49,000 --> 02:13:51,000
TikTok so yeah there

3919
02:13:51,000 --> 02:13:53,000
has been some revisiting

3920
02:13:53,000 --> 02:13:55,000
this is the steel drums

3921
02:13:55,000 --> 02:13:57,000
part of this arrangement

3922
02:13:57,000 --> 02:13:59,000
this is

3923
02:13:59,000 --> 02:14:01,000
this is when you're waiting for your Cinnabon

3924
02:14:01,000 --> 02:14:03,000
well no this is this is before

3925
02:14:03,000 --> 02:14:05,000
you enter the park

3926
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:07,000
so this is not port of entry this

3927
02:14:07,000 --> 02:14:09,000
is before you before even

3928
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:11,000
I think maybe you can hear bits of

3929
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:13,000
it in port of entry but

3930
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:15,000
around the tickets and those

3931
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:17,000
coverings and the lighthouse

3932
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:19,000
they have and it's just very

3933
02:14:19,000 --> 02:14:21,000
chill it just so chill it

3934
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:23,000
goes with the chill port of entry is

3935
02:14:23,000 --> 02:14:25,000
very chill chill and but mysterious

3936
02:14:25,000 --> 02:14:27,000
it is mysterious you don't

3937
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:29,000
know what adventures you're about to embark on

3938
02:14:29,000 --> 02:14:31,000
and maybe you were about to say something about

3939
02:14:31,000 --> 02:14:33,000
this Jason but do you know about the dynamic

3940
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:35,000
nature of this track

3941
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:37,000
where

3942
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:39,000
the different pans

3943
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:41,000
what about that yeah so

3944
02:14:41,000 --> 02:14:43,000
as you pass through port of entry

3945
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:45,000
from the way I understand it there's

3946
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:47,000
so that ding ding ding

3947
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:49,000
ding ding they

3948
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:51,000
have multiple instruments doing

3949
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:53,000
multiple tracks of that and as you go from

3950
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:55,000
area to area like you

3951
02:14:55,000 --> 02:14:57,000
you pass by where the

3952
02:14:57,000 --> 02:14:59,000
person is giving music lessons

3953
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:01,000
in the port of entry and you can hear

3954
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:03,000
the version of that that

3955
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:05,000
has like whatever instrument she's

3956
02:15:05,000 --> 02:15:07,000
playing or teaching and you can hear her

3957
02:15:07,000 --> 02:15:09,000
ukulele maybe

3958
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:11,000
the pirates with ukulele yeah

3959
02:15:11,000 --> 02:15:13,000
but there's probably is like a ukulele thing

3960
02:15:13,000 --> 02:15:15,000
but like it different

3961
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:17,000
speakers in the land play the same

3962
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:19,000
song but different

3963
02:15:19,000 --> 02:15:21,000
like isolated tracks

3964
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:23,000
of it so it all creates this living

3965
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:25,000
soundtrack that you walk

3966
02:15:25,000 --> 02:15:27,000
through and you hear different parts as you

3967
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:29,000
go to different places yes which is really

3968
02:15:29,000 --> 02:15:31,000
cool geez that's pretty genius

3969
02:15:31,000 --> 02:15:33,000
here's another like bit

3970
02:15:33,000 --> 02:15:35,000
of this arrangement

3971
02:15:35,000 --> 02:15:37,000
kicks in in just a

3972
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:39,000
second the clapping

3973
02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:41,000
the clapping goes

3974
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:43,000
on for so long

3975
02:15:43,000 --> 02:15:45,000
so I think the clapping

3976
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:47,000
is one of those isolated

3977
02:15:47,000 --> 02:15:49,000
tracks like there's probably that where

3978
02:15:49,000 --> 02:15:51,000
you walk by a certain part and you

3979
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:53,000
the clapping is very loud because it's coming

3980
02:15:53,000 --> 02:15:55,000
from that specific speaker

3981
02:15:55,000 --> 02:15:57,000
and it's probably thematic clapping I don't know

3982
02:15:57,000 --> 02:15:59,000
I'll have to check

3983
02:15:59,000 --> 02:16:01,000
yeah so this is broken

3984
02:16:01,000 --> 02:16:03,000
up I mean well

3985
02:16:03,000 --> 02:16:05,000
that's another island of adventure

3986
02:16:05,000 --> 02:16:07,000
track something like you were like mixing it in

3987
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:09,000
there well as Kevin

3988
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:11,000
has told us it's very

3989
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:13,000
easy to mix like yeah

3990
02:16:13,000 --> 02:16:15,000
port of entry and the entrance area

3991
02:16:15,000 --> 02:16:17,000
like stuff goes in

3992
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:19,000
and out a lot I think there was also

3993
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:21,000
something I forget what the

3994
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:23,000
full definition was but

3995
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:25,000
islands of adventure the first park

3996
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:27,000
with like some sort

3997
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:29,000
of dynamic audio like the speakers

3998
02:16:29,000 --> 02:16:31,000
are all over oh

3999
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:33,000
really

4000
02:16:33,000 --> 02:16:35,000
and I think every

4001
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:37,000
land had original music

4002
02:16:37,000 --> 02:16:39,000
too so if you look at the islands of adventure

4003
02:16:39,000 --> 02:16:41,000
official soundtrack on Spotify

4004
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:43,000
or Apple music

4005
02:16:43,000 --> 02:16:45,000
they break down the like

4006
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:47,000
call to entry slash main

4007
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:49,000

4019
02:17:11,000 --> 02:17:13,000
uh Dorson

4020
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:15,000
Dorson Droson

02:17:15,000 --> 02:17:17,000
Dorson Henry what was the name

4022
02:17:17,000 --> 02:17:19,000
Henry Droson

4023
02:17:19,000 --> 02:17:21,000
seems right but who knows

4024
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:23,000
I don't know we should not remember

4025
02:17:23,000 --> 02:17:25,000
his name after what he did

4026
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:27,000
that ocean trader market

4027
02:17:27,000 --> 02:17:29,000
loop if my wife hears that

4028
02:17:29,000 --> 02:17:31,000
she knows I'm taking a nap

4029
02:17:31,000 --> 02:17:33,000
that's my nap in music

4030
02:17:33,000 --> 02:17:35,000
really wow

4031
02:17:35,000 --> 02:17:37,000
that ne ne ne

4032
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:39,000
she's like oh he's laying

4033
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:41,000
down for a nap I don't nap that much

4034
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:43,000
is not in right now

4035
02:17:43,000 --> 02:17:45,000
is everyone doing music to go to sleep

4036
02:17:45,000 --> 02:17:47,000
here in this room I don't usually

4037
02:17:47,000 --> 02:17:49,000
it needs it's like

4038
02:17:49,000 --> 02:17:51,000
it's like honestly that that

4039
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:53,000
behind the waterfall that's like I've hit an emergency

4040
02:17:53,000 --> 02:17:55,000
oh really that's it's 2am

4041
02:17:55,000 --> 02:17:57,000
and I gotta be up for something early I gotta

4042
02:17:57,000 --> 02:17:59,000
bring out the big guns and that's when I go to that

4043
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:01,000
cause usually hopefully if I'm alright just

4044
02:18:01,000 --> 02:18:03,000
a podcast is doing it for me maybe a

4045
02:18:03,000 --> 02:18:05,000
.75 podcast

4046
02:18:05,000 --> 02:18:07,000
but uh yeah I'm actually not

4047
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:09,000
typically a music person you should have blasted that

4048
02:18:09,000 --> 02:18:11,000
that first night we were in Orlando cause I feel like

4049
02:18:11,000 --> 02:18:13,000
we couldn't get to sleep that was terrible for both

4050
02:18:13,000 --> 02:18:15,000
yeah I know I was

4051
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:17,000
fucking on a high from the first night of

4052
02:18:17,000 --> 02:18:19,000
Jelly Rolls and I knew it was an exciting day

4053
02:18:19,000 --> 02:18:21,000
the next day pre epic?

4054
02:18:21,000 --> 02:18:23,000
an exciting day the next day knowing

4055
02:18:23,000 --> 02:18:25,000
that you'd be at Jelly Rolls again

4056
02:18:25,000 --> 02:18:27,000
yes I was very excited for the end

4057
02:18:27,000 --> 02:18:29,000
of the next day but yeah it was hard getting to sleep

4058
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:31,000
Jason are you a music guy at the night now?

4059
02:18:31,000 --> 02:18:33,000
uh no I

4060
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:35,000
usually put on podcasts to go to sleep

4061
02:18:35,000 --> 02:18:37,000
same for a good night's

4062
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:39,000
sleep I do old

4063
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:41,000
Disney podcasts that have old news

4064
02:18:41,000 --> 02:18:43,000
in them

4065
02:18:43,000 --> 02:18:45,000
from the so not relevant

4066
02:18:45,000 --> 02:18:47,000
oh yes you've said you've downloaded a bunch of

4067
02:18:47,000 --> 02:18:49,000
from like 2009

4068
02:18:49,000 --> 02:18:51,000
wow it's kind of a thing

4069
02:18:51,000 --> 02:18:53,000
but what podcast do you do?

4070
02:18:53,000 --> 02:18:55,000
I will put it on and then

4071
02:18:55,000 --> 02:18:57,000
eventually I'll do like 15

4072
02:18:57,000 --> 02:18:59,000
or 30 minutes sleep timer

4073
02:18:59,000 --> 02:19:01,000
cause then in the morning I actually

4074
02:19:01,000 --> 02:19:03,000
went here

4075
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:05,000
so I don't have to backtrack to when I

4076
02:19:05,000 --> 02:19:07,000
remember well this is the key

4077
02:19:07,000 --> 02:19:09,000
I think the key is it's got to be a podcast

4078
02:19:09,000 --> 02:19:11,000
that you don't actually care about listening to

4079
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:13,000
and I don't

4080
02:19:13,000 --> 02:19:15,000
I don't want to make a rule for it cause I know people

4081
02:19:15,000 --> 02:19:17,000
probably listen to this show to fall asleep and

4082
02:19:17,000 --> 02:19:19,000
I wouldn't take it as an insult

4083
02:19:19,000 --> 02:19:21,000
that's a compliment

4084
02:19:21,000 --> 02:19:23,000
I might wake up laughing

4085
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:25,000
yours is going to be

4086
02:19:25,000 --> 02:19:27,000
so uproarious you're going to be

4087
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:29,000
woken up how many laughs per minute

4088
02:19:29,000 --> 02:19:31,000
on this show? 9?

4089
02:19:31,000 --> 02:19:33,000
well they did a study and yeah

4090
02:19:33,000 --> 02:19:35,000
it's 9 laughs per minute

4091
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:37,000
and that's a weak minute

4092
02:19:37,000 --> 02:19:39,000
that's if we aren't really cooking

4093
02:19:39,000 --> 02:19:41,000
I have started laughing and turned it into

4094
02:19:41,000 --> 02:19:43,000
a snort so as not to wake the

4095
02:19:43,000 --> 02:19:45,000
dog or my wife

4096
02:19:45,000 --> 02:19:47,000
you've routed your own laugh into a snort

4097
02:19:47,000 --> 02:19:49,000
I've routed my own laugh to try to

4098
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:51,000
not disturb the house

4099
02:19:51,000 --> 02:19:53,000
doesn't the snort make the dog think that a big boar is coming in?

4100
02:19:53,000 --> 02:19:55,000
no

4101
02:19:55,000 --> 02:19:57,000
don't be silly Scott

4102
02:19:57,000 --> 02:19:59,000
of course he doesn't think that

4103
02:19:59,000 --> 02:20:01,000
he's a dog who can reason

4104
02:20:01,000 --> 02:20:03,000
he would never

4105
02:20:03,000 --> 02:20:05,000
my go to is

4106
02:20:05,000 --> 02:20:07,000
because it's usually

4107
02:20:07,000 --> 02:20:09,000
the voices are

4108
02:20:09,000 --> 02:20:11,000
restrained

4109
02:20:11,000 --> 02:20:13,000
it's like an NPR style

4110
02:20:13,000 --> 02:20:15,000
well your

4111
02:20:15,000 --> 02:20:17,000
Kickstarter sucks their voices

4112
02:20:17,000 --> 02:20:19,000
are pretty level

4113
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:21,000
there's a podcast called Western Kabuki

4114
02:20:21,000 --> 02:20:23,000
about internet

4115
02:20:23,000 --> 02:20:25,000
stuff and then

4116
02:20:25,000 --> 02:20:27,000
a married couple

4117
02:20:27,000 --> 02:20:29,000
from Australia

4118
02:20:29,000 --> 02:20:31,000
comedians Demi Lardner and

4119
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:33,000
Tom Walker that podcast

4120
02:20:33,000 --> 02:20:35,000
is a very funny non sequitur

4121
02:20:35,000 --> 02:20:37,000
title Big Soft Titty

4122
02:20:37,000 --> 02:20:39,000
dot PNG

4123
02:20:39,000 --> 02:20:41,000
but that is nothing to do with the

4124
02:20:41,000 --> 02:20:43,000
content of it it's just very funny

4125
02:20:43,000 --> 02:20:45,000
they're on Twitch a lot too

4126
02:20:45,000 --> 02:20:47,000
I just heard that person on the guys

4127
02:20:47,000 --> 02:20:49,000
podcast I think

4128
02:20:49,000 --> 02:20:51,000
yes they both been on guys they're very funny

4129
02:20:51,000 --> 02:20:53,000
it might have been for the fart guys episode

4130
02:20:53,000 --> 02:20:55,000
Demi is on the fart guys I forget which

4131
02:20:55,000 --> 02:20:57,000
one Tom is on

4132
02:20:57,000 --> 02:20:59,000
but that's too see that's too

4133
02:20:59,000 --> 02:21:01,000
interesting of a podcast to listen to for me

4134
02:21:01,000 --> 02:21:03,000
sleeping I have to listen to like

4135
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:05,000
inside the magic before inside the magic

4136
02:21:05,000 --> 02:21:07,000
was a terrible website

4137
02:21:07,000 --> 02:21:09,000
that has

4138
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:11,000
Ricky era

4139
02:21:11,000 --> 02:21:13,000
so you know Ricky

4140
02:21:13,000 --> 02:21:15,000
Ricky Briganti

4141
02:21:15,000 --> 02:21:17,000
yeah I have his full

4142
02:21:17,000 --> 02:21:19,000
library of which are now

4143
02:21:19,000 --> 02:21:21,000
completely removed from the internet

4144
02:21:21,000 --> 02:21:23,000
his podcast from 2005

4145
02:21:23,000 --> 02:21:25,000
to 2014 I have

4146
02:21:25,000 --> 02:21:27,000
every episode and I just pick a random

4147
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:29,000
number and I listen to that to fall

4148
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:31,000
asleep that sounds to life

4149
02:21:31,000 --> 02:21:33,000
that's a real cousin of having the like the database

4150
02:21:33,000 --> 02:21:35,000
the

4151
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:37,000
torrented collection

4152
02:21:37,000 --> 02:21:39,000
right all of the CD kiosk

4153
02:21:39,000 --> 02:21:41,000
music right but this is just one

4154
02:21:41,000 --> 02:21:43,000
words like you can figure out you know

4155
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:45,000
you're hearing news of

4156
02:21:45,000 --> 02:21:47,000
it would always start with the news of

4157
02:21:47,000 --> 02:21:49,000
the week and it would sometimes

4158
02:21:49,000 --> 02:21:51,000
be like you

4159
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:53,000

test track coming or something more

4161
02:21:55,000 --> 02:21:57,000
monumental Expedition Everest but then sometimes it's like

4162
02:21:57,000 --> 02:21:59,000
it's like Bolt's

4163
02:21:59,000 --> 02:22:01,000

02:22:57,000 --> 02:22:59,000
just riding the monorail oh

4192
02:22:59,000 --> 02:23:01,000
yeah I used to do that too

4193
02:23:01,000 --> 02:23:03,000
like I had this recording of Ellen's

4194
02:23:03,000 --> 02:23:05,000
Energy Adventure this was when I was very young

4195
02:23:05,000 --> 02:23:07,000
you don't have to add a qualifier

4196
02:23:07,000 --> 02:23:09,000
to that there isn't there's always

4197
02:23:09,000 --> 02:23:11,000
a good age to fall asleep

4198
02:23:11,000 --> 02:23:13,000
something about this particular

4199
02:23:13,000 --> 02:23:15,000
one just seems like kind of sicko mode

4200
02:23:15,000 --> 02:23:17,000
and so yeah I was like 13 or 14

4201
02:23:17,000 --> 02:23:19,000
but I had this like just the entire

4202
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:21,000
45 minute Ellen's Energy

4203
02:23:21,000 --> 02:23:23,000
Adventure attraction audio

4204
02:23:23,000 --> 02:23:25,000
and I would fall asleep to that

4205
02:23:25,000 --> 02:23:27,000
or the American Adventure

4206
02:23:27,000 --> 02:23:29,000
you were channeling the spirit

4207
02:23:29,000 --> 02:23:31,000
of overheated dads for

4208
02:23:31,000 --> 02:23:33,000
both of those that's right

4209
02:23:33,000 --> 02:23:35,000
and I did sleep in both of those

4210
02:23:35,000 --> 02:23:37,000
attractions maybe that's why but you didn't get

4211
02:23:37,000 --> 02:23:39,000
overheated in a different way by

4212
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:41,000
sexy sexy Bill Nye

4213
02:23:41,000 --> 02:23:43,000
a la somebody's blushing bride

4214
02:23:43,000 --> 02:23:45,000
over here

4215
02:23:45,000 --> 02:23:47,000
Jason's arch nemesis

4216
02:23:47,000 --> 02:23:49,000
Bill Nye

4217
02:23:49,000 --> 02:23:51,000
my elementary school

4218
02:23:51,000 --> 02:23:53,000
fond member is

4219
02:23:53,000 --> 02:23:55,000
replaced by

4220
02:23:55,000 --> 02:23:57,000
your fun music videos are not fun

4221
02:23:57,000 --> 02:23:59,000
to be anymore Beakman was better than

4222
02:23:59,000 --> 02:24:01,000
you oh my

4223
02:24:01,000 --> 02:24:03,000
fourth grade science teacher was so

4224
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:05,000
anti-Beakman really?

4225
02:24:05,000 --> 02:24:07,000
yes she hated Beakman she

4226
02:24:07,000 --> 02:24:09,000
loved Bill Nye but she would

4227
02:24:09,000 --> 02:24:11,000
occasionally begrudgingly put

4228
02:24:11,000 --> 02:24:13,000
on Beakman because Beakman was

4229
02:24:13,000 --> 02:24:15,000
too wild with science

4230
02:24:15,000 --> 02:24:17,000
I think he was probably she found him

4231
02:24:17,000 --> 02:24:19,000
annoying strange camera angles

4232
02:24:19,000 --> 02:24:21,000
unrealistic hair what about that mouse

4233
02:24:21,000 --> 02:24:23,000
guy that was a sidekick

4234
02:24:23,000 --> 02:24:25,000
oh I don't care for him

4235
02:24:25,000 --> 02:24:27,000
was it a rat? oh well mouse was similar

4236
02:24:27,000 --> 02:24:29,000
I liked him yeah

4237
02:24:29,000 --> 02:24:31,000
we should we should wind it down we've been going for a long

4238
02:24:31,000 --> 02:24:33,000
time but this has been a wonderful

4239
02:24:33,000 --> 02:24:35,000
exploration I feel I am

4240
02:24:35,000 --> 02:24:37,000
were there any runner ups for anyone

4241
02:24:37,000 --> 02:24:39,000
was there anything that you wanted to

4242
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:41,000
do a little bit I mean one that

4243
02:24:41,000 --> 02:24:43,000
was like very formative for

4244
02:24:43,000 --> 02:24:45,000
me was the everything that plays

4245
02:24:45,000 --> 02:24:47,000
before Captain EO

4246
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:49,000
waiting for it to start I think

4247
02:24:49,000 --> 02:24:51,000
I had a big influence on my music taste

4248
02:24:51,000 --> 02:24:53,000
in general like still like

4249
02:24:53,000 --> 02:24:55,000
scares me to bit like it really

4250
02:24:55,000 --> 02:24:57,000
takes me there that's on YouTube

4251
02:24:57,000 --> 02:24:59,000
and just like you know kind of like

4252
02:24:59,000 --> 02:25:01,000
variations on one little like

4253
02:25:01,000 --> 02:25:03,000
you know what one little

4254
02:25:03,000 --> 02:25:05,000
synth theme and just kind of like

4255
02:25:05,000 --> 02:25:07,000
ambienting out the same musical

4256
02:25:07,000 --> 02:25:09,000
neck of the woods but then with you know with little

4257
02:25:09,000 --> 02:25:11,000
weird scary stabs of

4258
02:25:11,000 --> 02:25:13,000
little sparkly synth things

4259
02:25:13,000 --> 02:25:15,000
yeah still scares me like

4260
02:25:15,000 --> 02:25:17,000
I was three yeah no I that's

4261
02:25:17,000 --> 02:25:19,000
that stuff is good when they

4262
02:25:19,000 --> 02:25:21,000
talk about like the arts arts and crafts movement

4263
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:23,000
in California

4264
02:25:23,000 --> 02:25:25,000
like there's a little tram loop with all

4265
02:25:25,000 --> 02:25:27,000
also with like oh that's right that would have been the name

4266
02:25:27,000 --> 02:25:29,000
for inspired by the arts and crafts

4267
02:25:29,000 --> 02:25:31,000
movement but that does like

4268
02:25:31,000 --> 02:25:33,000
that kind of takes me there I know yeah

4269
02:25:33,000 --> 02:25:35,000
for whatever reason that phrase and I think that maybe

4270
02:25:35,000 --> 02:25:37,000
there isn't even music under it but now I start thinking

4271
02:25:37,000 --> 02:25:39,000
of just DCA

4272
02:25:39,000 --> 02:25:41,000
aesthetic and the music when I think of that

4273
02:25:41,000 --> 02:25:43,000
phrase hear that honey it was inspired by the arts

4274
02:25:43,000 --> 02:25:45,000
and crafts movement early California

4275
02:25:45,000 --> 02:25:47,000
I think I say that we got

4276
02:25:47,000 --> 02:25:49,000
to check it out there arts and crafts

4277
02:25:49,000 --> 02:25:51,000
I am on the email

4278
02:25:51,000 --> 02:25:53,000
newsletter of the museum of

4279
02:25:53,000 --> 02:25:55,000
arts and crafts which I believe

4280
02:25:55,000 --> 02:25:57,000
is in Florida

4281
02:25:57,000 --> 02:25:59,000
the museum of the arts and crafts movement

4282
02:25:59,000 --> 02:26:01,000
so the movement was

4283
02:26:01,000 --> 02:26:03,000
not just California

4284
02:26:03,000 --> 02:26:05,000
there was a movement happening everywhere I think it was kind of

4285
02:26:05,000 --> 02:26:07,000
wasn't in California at all Disney's lying

4286
02:26:07,000 --> 02:26:09,000
that voiceover is lying

4287
02:26:09,000 --> 02:26:11,000
I bet there were arts and crafts movements

4288
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:13,000
in a lot of states

4289
02:26:13,000 --> 02:26:15,000
probably just Florida

4290
02:26:15,000 --> 02:26:17,000
yeah and they're stealing it

4291
02:26:17,000 --> 02:26:19,000
anything else you consider

4292
02:26:19,000 --> 02:26:21,000
anything else you want to shout out

4293
02:26:21,000 --> 02:26:23,000
we don't have a lot of time we shouldn't go on

4294
02:26:23,000 --> 02:26:25,000
and on but epic universe

4295
02:26:25,000 --> 02:26:27,000
so what I will say about

4296
02:26:27,000 --> 02:26:29,000
epic universe is that

4297
02:26:29,000 --> 02:26:31,000
the music I heard there was all

4298
02:26:31,000 --> 02:26:33,000
really good

4299
02:26:33,000 --> 02:26:35,000
I think like the Burke music

4300
02:26:35,000 --> 02:26:37,000
loop is potentially

4301
02:26:37,000 --> 02:26:39,000
just music from the

4302
02:26:39,000 --> 02:26:41,000
scores of the movies but they're very

4303
02:26:41,000 --> 02:26:43,000
well selected it's not just playing it's not playing

4304
02:26:43,000 --> 02:26:45,000
some pop song that was at the end of how

4305
02:26:45,000 --> 02:26:47,000
to train your dragon which I assume there was one

4306
02:26:47,000 --> 02:26:49,000
it's like very atmospheric

4307
02:26:49,000 --> 02:26:51,000
that's what party rock anthem was from I believe

4308
02:26:51,000 --> 02:26:53,000
party rock anthem

4309
02:26:53,000 --> 02:26:55,000
love theme from how to train your dragon

4310
02:26:57,000 --> 02:26:59,000
and like of course the Danny Elfman

4311
02:26:59,000 --> 02:27:01,000
stuff is really atmospheric and cool

4312
02:27:01,000 --> 02:27:03,000
when you're in the land but the celestial

4313
02:27:03,000 --> 02:27:05,000
park music to me

4314
02:27:05,000 --> 02:27:07,000
really

4315
02:27:07,000 --> 02:27:09,000
really rules it's pretty good

4316
02:27:09,000 --> 02:27:11,000
apparently maybe 14 hours

4317
02:27:11,000 --> 02:27:13,000
of it that's what I heard I remember

4318
02:27:13,000 --> 02:27:15,000
Jim Hill I think he maybe said 60

4319
02:27:15,000 --> 02:27:17,000
and I got excited but

4320
02:27:17,000 --> 02:27:19,000
no I think maybe I miss a lot of

4321
02:27:19,000 --> 02:27:21,000
hours it is as 16

4322
02:27:21,000 --> 02:27:23,000
as 60 I think maybe

4323
02:27:23,000 --> 02:27:25,000
he was not wrong there whether to bother

4324
02:27:25,000 --> 02:27:27,000
people we I know it universal

4325
02:27:27,000 --> 02:27:29,000
going like do you have

4326
02:27:29,000 --> 02:27:31,000
access to these fort is there

4327
02:27:31,000 --> 02:27:33,000
any box that's coming with these 14

4328
02:27:33,000 --> 02:27:35,000
to 60 hours I wouldn't be surprised

4329
02:27:35,000 --> 02:27:37,000
massive crate lands in

4330
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:39,000
the vinyl of dark

4331
02:27:39,000 --> 02:27:41,000
universe already

4332
02:27:41,000 --> 02:27:43,000
sold out so obviously there's

4333
02:27:43,000 --> 02:27:45,000
they're thinking in that way I think

4334
02:27:45,000 --> 02:27:47,000
celestial park as far as I could tell

4335
02:27:47,000 --> 02:27:49,000
every restaurant had

4336
02:27:49,000 --> 02:27:51,000
a loop meteor astro

4337
02:27:51,000 --> 02:27:53,000
pub had a loop

4338
02:27:53,000 --> 02:27:55,000
pizza moon

4339
02:27:55,000 --> 02:27:57,000
has a loop and

4340
02:27:57,000 --> 02:27:59,000
star light

4341
02:27:59,000 --> 02:28:01,000
no stardust racers has a really

4342
02:28:01,000 --> 02:28:03,000
like moody

4343
02:28:03,000 --> 02:28:05,000
score that plays next to it

4344
02:28:05,000 --> 02:28:07,000
and a little bit

4345
02:28:07,000 --> 02:28:09,000
of dynamic like

4346
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:11,000
island of adventure growing dynamic place

4347
02:28:11,000 --> 02:28:13,000
dynamic with like

4348
02:28:13,000 --> 02:28:15,000
as you walk from place to place the song

4349
02:28:15,000 --> 02:28:17,000
changes I think there might

4350
02:28:17,000 --> 02:28:19,000
be a little bit of that too but I'll

4351
02:28:19,000 --> 02:28:21,000
go back soon I've been supposedly

4352
02:28:21,000 --> 02:28:23,000
people who worked on port of entry also

4353
02:28:23,000 --> 02:28:25,000
worked on celestial park

4354
02:28:25,000 --> 02:28:27,000
that explains why I

4355
02:28:27,000 --> 02:28:29,000
feel of peace I love celestial

4356
02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:31,000
park and I thank you

4357
02:28:31,000 --> 02:28:33,000
guys yeah I know

4358
02:28:33,000 --> 02:28:35,000
I was gonna say you were trying to sell

4359
02:28:35,000 --> 02:28:37,000
us on it because we did not fall in

4360
02:28:37,000 --> 02:28:39,000
the state that we saw we did not necessarily

4361
02:28:39,000 --> 02:28:41,000
I always try I always try to invite

4362
02:28:41,000 --> 02:28:43,000
anyone who listens to the show

4363
02:28:43,000 --> 02:28:45,000
when they do the show to rip

4364
02:28:45,000 --> 02:28:47,000
into us before they

4365
02:28:47,000 --> 02:28:49,000
start and that's the closest it's

4366
02:28:49,000 --> 02:28:51,000
happened gentle way to do it no no

4367
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:53,000

educational Epcot energy like we can find

4374
02:29:05,000 --> 02:29:07,000
a way yeah we can explore

4375
02:29:07,000 --> 02:29:09,000
the cosmos there's so many good angles

4376
02:29:09,000 --> 02:29:11,000
online of and I don't hate celestial

4377
02:29:11,000 --> 02:29:13,000
park but there's so many good angles that

4378
02:29:13,000 --> 02:29:15,000
I didn't experience yeah I

4379
02:29:15,000 --> 02:29:17,000
think when you both go back I think

4380
02:29:17,000 --> 02:29:19,000
you will see it in a new light

4381
02:29:19,000 --> 02:29:21,000
I think I

4382
02:29:21,000 --> 02:29:23,000
have you seen the video

4383
02:29:23,000 --> 02:29:25,000
where someone took the old camcorder

4384
02:29:25,000 --> 02:29:27,000
to epic universe

4385
02:29:27,000 --> 02:29:29,000
and it's soundtracked with like

4386
02:29:29,000 --> 02:29:31,000
an instrumental

4387
02:29:31,000 --> 02:29:33,000
killers when

4388
02:29:33,000 --> 02:29:35,000
when we were young

4389
02:29:35,000 --> 02:29:37,000
came out 20 years ago

4390
02:29:37,000 --> 02:29:39,000
oh wow

4391
02:29:39,000 --> 02:29:41,000
so I

4392
02:29:41,000 --> 02:29:43,000
I think I was laughing

4393
02:29:43,000 --> 02:29:45,000
at the idea that that is going

4394
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:47,000
to make it a moving experience

4395
02:29:47,000 --> 02:29:49,000
I felt emotional

4396
02:29:49,000 --> 02:29:51,000
yeah here in that that tune

4397
02:29:51,000 --> 02:29:53,000
and the old footage yeah

4398
02:29:53,000 --> 02:29:55,000
it worked it worked on me

4399
02:29:55,000 --> 02:29:57,000
okay so we are now

4400
02:29:57,000 --> 02:29:59,000
we're just saying epic universe we're like

4401
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:01,000
heading into an area where area

4402
02:30:01,000 --> 02:30:03,000
loops are more important than

4403
02:30:03,000 --> 02:30:05,000
ever this might be like the

4404
02:30:05,000 --> 02:30:07,000
greatest chapter of area loop we've ever

4405
02:30:07,000 --> 02:30:09,000
experienced I think it

4406
02:30:09,000 --> 02:30:11,000
I think that

4407
02:30:11,000 --> 02:30:13,000
it shows promise and it shows that they're

4408
02:30:13,000 --> 02:30:15,000
thinking about it still which is all I ask

4409
02:30:15,000 --> 02:30:17,000
for Disney I think is still

4410
02:30:17,000 --> 02:30:19,000
thinking about it in certain places

4411
02:30:19,000 --> 02:30:21,000
they've gone a little more boring they aren't willing

4412
02:30:21,000 --> 02:30:23,000
to do their weird little Ray

4413
02:30:23,000 --> 02:30:25,000
Lynch's and their blips and bloops yeah I don't know

4414
02:30:25,000 --> 02:30:27,000
if the Ray Lynch era is ever coming

4415
02:30:27,000 --> 02:30:29,000
back but

4416
02:30:29,000 --> 02:30:31,000
I mean if they're making new music

4417
02:30:31,000 --> 02:30:33,000
I support it

4418
02:30:33,000 --> 02:30:35,000
but none of this like saving Mr

4419
02:30:35,000 --> 02:30:37,000
Banks crap like just

4420
02:30:37,000 --> 02:30:39,000
don't just throw stuff you have the rights to

4421
02:30:39,000 --> 02:30:41,000
from like Nat Geo documentaries and

4422
02:30:41,000 --> 02:30:43,000
call it an area loop

4423
02:30:43,000 --> 02:30:45,000
think about it because it's

4424
02:30:45,000 --> 02:30:47,000
important and it gives people a lot

4425
02:30:47,000 --> 02:30:49,000
to think about and a lot to talk about

4426
02:30:49,000 --> 02:30:51,000
which was so nice to do here

4427
02:30:51,000 --> 02:30:53,000

and do an episode just on that cat that

4458
02:31:53,000 --> 02:31:55,000
pervert cat the Rippentons cat

4459
02:31:55,000 --> 02:31:57,000
the Rippentons cat yeah

4460
02:31:57,000 --> 02:31:59,000
I would love maybe that's that could be

4461
02:31:59,000 --> 02:32:01,000
my birthday shot we would have to like

4462
02:32:01,000 --> 02:32:03,000
find primary source material of

4463
02:32:03,000 --> 02:32:05,000
like who illustrated it we need to like

4464
02:32:05,000 --> 02:32:07,000
talk to the person who created the Rippentons cat

4465
02:32:07,000 --> 02:32:09,000
yeah yeah it's not far

4466
02:32:09,000 --> 02:32:11,000
from that I like I don't know it's

4467
02:32:11,000 --> 02:32:13,000
there's sort of some like Wolfgang

4468
02:32:13,000 --> 02:32:15,000
puckiness to it yeah

4469
02:32:15,000 --> 02:32:17,000
I think it ties in this and just

4470
02:32:17,000 --> 02:32:19,000
there's like an airbrush thing about it I think

4471
02:32:19,000 --> 02:32:21,000
is very interesting it's a little

4472
02:32:21,000 --> 02:32:23,000
t-shirt

4473
02:32:23,000 --> 02:32:25,000
you would buy to save the rainforest

4474
02:32:25,000 --> 02:32:27,000
and a little of that global

4475
02:32:27,000 --> 02:32:29,000
coffee shop I think it's very

4476
02:32:29,000 --> 02:32:31,000
related to global coffee shop

4477
02:32:31,000 --> 02:32:33,000
the save the rain fart that was the

4478
02:32:33,000 --> 02:32:35,000
same artist who drew a lot of the Joe

4479
02:32:35,000 --> 02:32:37,000
Camel stuff don't forget oh that's right

4480
02:32:37,000 --> 02:32:39,000
oh I forgot that title yeah yeah yes

4481
02:32:39,000 --> 02:32:41,000
no it's definitely it's it's camel core

4482
02:32:41,000 --> 02:32:43,000
it's rainforest core and did you not

4483
02:32:43,000 --> 02:32:45,000
inspire a tattoo of this

4484
02:32:45,000 --> 02:32:47,000
what was the story with the

4485
02:32:47,000 --> 02:32:49,000
tattoo oh telethon bassist

4486
02:32:49,000 --> 02:32:51,000
Alex he got

4487
02:32:51,000 --> 02:32:53,000
tattoos to represent every

4488
02:32:53,000 --> 02:32:55,000
member of telethon

4489
02:32:55,000 --> 02:32:57,000
and mine is a Rippentons

4490
02:32:57,000 --> 02:32:59,000
cat when he when asked how

4491
02:32:59,000 --> 02:33:01,000

4492
02:33:01,000 --> 02:33:03,000
tattoo you said this cat

4493
02:33:03,000 --> 02:33:05,000
yeah wow yeah

4494
02:33:05,000 --> 02:33:07,000
I wanted him to do the one from

4495
02:33:07,000 --> 02:33:09,000
the Rippentons album for exclamation

4496
02:33:09,000 --> 02:33:11,000
point where the Rippentons cat is swinging a golf

4497
02:33:11,000 --> 02:33:13,000
club because I play golf

4498
02:33:13,000 --> 02:33:15,000
but he didn't want to get like golf

4499
02:33:15,000 --> 02:33:17,000
a golf

4500
02:33:17,000 --> 02:33:19,000
insignia on his

4501
02:33:19,000 --> 02:33:21,000
on his leg that's

4502
02:33:21,000 --> 02:33:23,000
fair so you got scary cat great

4503
02:33:23,000 --> 02:33:25,000
scary cat golfing I don't know

4504
02:33:25,000 --> 02:33:27,000
yeah it's whichever one has a

4505
02:33:27,000 --> 02:33:29,000
it's like a joker motif like a

4506
02:33:29,000 --> 02:33:31,000
card it's

4507
02:33:31,000 --> 02:33:33,000
really really an ugly version I think

4508
02:33:33,000 --> 02:33:35,000
the Rippentons cat can be cute but

4509
02:33:35,000 --> 02:33:37,000
that is not a version that is when you look up

4510
02:33:37,000 --> 02:33:39,000
Rippentons cat you will see many

4511
02:33:39,000 --> 02:33:41,000
terrifying horrible pieces of

4512
02:33:41,000 --> 02:33:43,000
art and if you're Mike you'll see many

4513
02:33:43,000 --> 02:33:45,000
