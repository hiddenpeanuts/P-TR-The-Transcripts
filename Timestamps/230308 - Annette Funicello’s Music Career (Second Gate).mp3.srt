1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:21,400
All right, I'm just gonna start.

3
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:22,600
Sorry, guys, I'm starting right now.

4
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:23,800
I'm a little overwhelmed again.

5
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,600
I don't want this to turn into,

6
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,840
the podcast will write the second gate.

7
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,120
I'm Michael Carlson.

8
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:30,360
I'm here.

9
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,200
I'm one of your hosts.

10
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:35,200
I'm joined by Scott Garner and Jason Sheridan as usual.

11
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,600
Does it put you at ease to just kind of dive in?

12
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,440
Yeah, I think it does.

13
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,400
Because you're coming in with a lot of stress.

14
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,360
Yeah, I had a lot of stress.

15
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,000
I came in, I was gonna do like,

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,520
oh, welcome to the podcast, the Riot Club.

17
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,860
And we're gonna do our little intros,

18
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,360
like the Mickey Mouse Club.

19
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:49,420
That was what I had planned.

20
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:50,340
But I said, you know what?

21
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:52,440
This is more honest, this is more real.

22
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,600
You know what you didn't want to call him

23
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,080
Jason Cubby Sheridan?

24
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,320
That was part of it, yes.

25
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,160
That was part of it.

26
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,120
But then I thought, you know what?

27
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,240
This episode's about Annette, not Cubby.

28
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,720
You're right, you're right.

29
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:06,680
And I don't even know the percentage of Mickey Mouse Club.

30
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:10,060
I don't know what we're getting at all, frankly.

31
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:10,960
This is the least.

32
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,860
Jason and I do not have any notes.

33
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:13,700
We got no laptops.

34
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:14,540
Yeah, I know.

35
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:15,360
So we're here to listen.

36
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,560
I'm flying, I'm the pilot in the cockpit alone.

37
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,600
My co-pilot is passed out

38
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,760
and the passengers are just enjoying the ride.

39
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,600
That's what's going on right now.

40
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,600
All right, so it's not an emergency.

41
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,440
It could be.

42
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,440
It could go down in flames, but.

43
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,760
Possibly.

44
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,060
But you know, I think it's gonna be fine.

45
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:33,880
I think I'm fine.

46
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,540
Here's what I told myself today

47
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:37,320
as I was finishing up the research

48
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,880
on Annette Funicello's singing career.

49
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:42,920
I said, we're not gonna get to all of it.

50
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,760
We're not gonna do a full career retrospect of this.

51
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:49,960
Woman did a lot and we cannot possibly cover it.

52
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,660
So I'm gonna let myself off the hook right there.

53
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:55,160
We're gonna focus on a few things today

54
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,320
and I think it's gonna be great.

55
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,600
It's gonna be wonderful.

56
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,960
As the narrator of the A&E biography

57
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,360
that I watched on Annette would say, it was wonderful.

58
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,080
This is, I feel like this is a phrase

59
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,160
they would say over and over again

60
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,300
about literally every topic they covered

61
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:13,960
on her A&E biography from 1995,

62
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:17,360
which there's not an ounce of drama in this thing.

63
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,480
There's no, this is not a behind the music.

64
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,480
There's no drugs.

65
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,320
It's if you're.

66
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,200
No bankruptcy.

67
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,400
And then Annette went to work for Walt Disney

68
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,400
and then it's her and she's like,

69
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,000
Mr. Disney was wonderful.

70
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,840
And then it's like,

71
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,160
and then it's just a couple other

72
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,920
like talking heads of other Mouseketeers

73
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,920
and they're like, that was wonderful working there.

74
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,080
And Annette was so beautiful

75
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,240
and all the men are real creepy about her.

76
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,920
And then that's like the first 10 minutes.

77
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,040
It's just like how beautiful 12 year old Annette was

78
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,800
and how wonderful the Mouseketeers were.

79
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,680
Like, and that's no drama.

80
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,000
Everything was perfect.

81
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,680
Frankie Avalon, wonderful.

82
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,000
Yes, Paul Anka, wonderful.

83
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,720
That one I know, of course, Paul Anka is wonderful.

84
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,920
A little thing to say at the top here.

85
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,520
Longtime listeners know why we're doing this episode

86
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:06,480
because this has been mentioned for a long time.

87
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:11,480
And one notable time when it came up,

88
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,440
it birthed a phrase that's remained with us

89
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,760
on podcast, The Ride, which is calling your shot.

90
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,960
Mike brought it up with, I'm calling my shot,

91
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,040
which is a big bravado phrase.

92
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,760
And then followed it up with,

93
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,680
we're doing Annette Funicello's singing career.

94
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,040
Which I feel is a,

95
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,240
I think that's become kind of a common podcast,

96
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,200
The Ride thing too, is like having swag

97
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,560
about something mundane.

98
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:38,840
Like saying like, oh, you know I fuck with candy corn.

99
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,120
Bomb pops?

100
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,600
Yeah.

101
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,320
Kind of weird, I like bomb pops.

102
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,840
I'm thinking yeah.

103
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,160
The only time we're ever aggro,

104
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:50,760
it's about like some sort of Hawaiian novelty song

105
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,120
or a specific candy or treat.

106
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,360
It's absolutely about something that a six year old

107
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:00,600
could partake in, eat or listen to with no changes.

108
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:04,400
Right, a six year old from the 1950s

109
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,680
through late 1960s generally.

110
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,000
Pretty specific.

111
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,080
But you know, you've asked, you've brought it up,

112
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,800
you've brought it up and we're finally here.

113
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:18,360
And especially the reason why we're here is that

114
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:21,840
I had the notion that this year on podcast, The Ride,

115
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,240
we could give each other little treats,

116
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,640
give ourselves little treats really,

117
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:30,520
which is when it is the week of your birthday,

118
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:34,000
you call your shot and you do the topic

119
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,800
that is very specific to you and a layer of niche

120
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,520
within the layer of niche we're all already in.

121
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,360
Right.

122
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,400
And this is that week, Mike Carlson, happy birthday.

123
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,400
Happy birthday. Thank you very much.

124
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,880
Yeah, Scott, you sprung this idea on me.

125
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,880
I think it was, we were having a conversation,

126
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,640
actually Jason wasn't there yet.

127
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:56,000
And I think I proposed the idea of Jason month.

128
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,560
Yeah, this is news to you.

129
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,800
Oh man, if you want some mendinity.

130
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,560
So I think at least we maybe for now,

131
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:06,000
we settled on a week for each of us

132
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,840
around the time of our birthday.

133
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,720
That's what I was saying, let's start slow,

134
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,520
slow down, you're not racing yet.

135
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,880
Yeah, yeah.

136
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,560
But now that we've teased Jason month,

137
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,280
does anything go, do you go straight to anything

138
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,600
when you hear Jason month?

139
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,680
Is there something you know you'd want to achieve?

140
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,720
Well, I have something in this room

141
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,600
and I think other podcasts might've covered it before,

142
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:30,280
but David Roth, very, very good writer,

143
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,600
one of the heads of the Defector website,

144
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:36,760
posted, mentioned something about the Tops baseball card,

145
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:40,680
Allen and Gittner series, which is a line.

146
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,120
Scott's eyes fell out of his head.

147
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,480
Are we ready for Jason month?

148
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:47,320
Allen and Gittner was one of the first

149
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,600
baseball card companies.

150
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,920
So it's like throwback style cards of players,

151
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,920
current players, past players,

152
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:58,920
but also there are notable figures and objects

153
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:03,000
and they're all about the bread series,

154
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,000
includes like hot dog, Italian sub, pork roll sandwich.

155
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,760
So as soon as I found this out, I went on eBay

156
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,960
and today arrived the trading cards.

157
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:14,800
Do you want to see these?

158
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,640
Do you want to see these?

159
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,000
I guess so.

160
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,080
I mean, you're, like, I worry if you want to save it

161
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,040
for Jason month.

162
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:20,880
That's the-

163
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,720
No, I look, Jason's taking my thunder already

164
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:27,600
with his bread playing cards that he's recently acquired.

165
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,840
Hey, you're taking cards, trading cards.

166
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:29,680
Oh, excuse me, yeah, trading cards.

167
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,880
Mike's birthday or no, I'm talking about

168
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,000
these bread trading cards.

169
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,760
It says, get that bread.

170
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:37,560
It says Allen and Gittner indeed.

171
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:42,560
And it's a pay, this one's Italian sub, pork roll.

172
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,960
We got, and some facts about pork roll,

173
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,000
which you're breezing through like, yeah, I know it,

174
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,920
know it, know it.

175
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,080
Yes, John Taylor, of course I know it.

176
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,480
John Taylor, his ham.

177
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,880
Of course I know it's commonly served

178
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,080
on a breakfast sandwich company by a good cheese, duh.

179
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,600
Ruben's sandwich rookie card.

180
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,440
Mike, you want to take a look,

181
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,800
or are you offended that these are getting in the way?

182
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,320
He already sent me a photo of this.

183
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:05,920
Again, I'm learning what is done separately.

184
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,760
Behind your back.

185
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:10,480
It's a lot of treats and sandwich based things and-

186
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,960
That's my deal.

187
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:15,440
Little tease of Jason month there, I suppose.

188
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,160
What a tantalizing start.

189
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,000
But right now it's your birthday

190
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,920
and what better present to give you

191
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:25,520
than the gift of doing a lot of work,

192
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,880
which we don't have to do, right?

193
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,160
And we just sit and listen.

194
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,720
I hope you, happy birthday, enjoy the research.

195
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,320
Thank you, yes.

196
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,160
It's always fun.

197
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,120
Now again, so real quick,

198
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,160
if you don't know what we're talking about,

199
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:43,160
Annette Funicello is one of the original Mouseketeers.

200
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:47,320
Walt Disney assembled like an Avengers of children

201
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,800
back in the day.

202
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,200
I mean, I get they weren't famous yet.

203
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,040
No, that's true.

204
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:52,860
You're right.

205
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:54,120
You're talking about the most talented children.

206
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,880
The most talented children of all time.

207
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,040
He assembled them.

208
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:58,880
The Avengers.

209
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,360
I got to keep it relevant for the young people.

210
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,200
What are they gonna understand?

211
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,040
Yeah, I was trying to make them know

212
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,280
what I'm talking about.

213
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,200
And there were 24 of them.

214
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:10,440
There were 24 original Mouseketeers.

215
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:13,160
And he debuted the idea on the Disneyland special,

216
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,120
I believe the opening day Disneyland special.

217
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,400
The show hadn't started yet, the actual show.

218
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:22,380
But it was, it's a show that lasted for decades

219
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:23,320
with different casts.

220
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,400
And of course, Britney Spears and Justin Timberlake

221
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,800
were also Mouseketeers.

222
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,320
Everyone's got their favorite era.

223
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,480
Like Saturday Night Live.

224
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:33,420
The 70s one that made that one special

225
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:36,320
and somebody was on Facts of Life later.

226
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,600
That's most people, I think.

227
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,760
Yeah, yeah.

228
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,080
So yeah, he assembled all these.

229
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,080
Now here's, this was the most exciting thing

230
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,220
and this is not gonna excite anyone but me

231
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:48,000
and maybe somebody else in the room, maybe.

232
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,140
Is that Walt discovered, he was the only one

233
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:54,040
who actually like scouted one of them, scouted Annette.

234
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,080
Everyone else came in for auditions.

235
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:56,920
Okay.

236
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:00,480
And he scouted her at the Starlight Bowl in Burbank.

237
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,440
Which is this.

238
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,280
Yeah, doing Swan Lake.

239
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,240
Yes. Is that right?

240
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,080
Yeah.

241
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,920
So she was doing like a recital for school.

242
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,280
That's the one in the Hills?

243
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,880
Yes. The Greek theater

244
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:10,720
or the bowl style?

245
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,240
That we found like two years ago

246
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,360
that we didn't know existed.

247
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,320
And they show or they have like five concerts a month

248
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:22,120
and it's run like a local elementary school.

249
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,680
Like any food they're selling,

250
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,840
it's just like wrapped in tin foil, like beef

251
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:30,240
and they run out of stuff and they have, you know,

252
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,680
like Mike's Hard Lemonade and beer in a can

253
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,000
and wine in a can.

254
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,800
Everything is like just dragged up the hill

255
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,440
for one like Kenny Loggins performance.

256
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,920
And that's like high level as far as the stars.

257
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,680
Yeah, no, it's the real Kenny Loggins.

258
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:47,080
Not like it's not called the Footloosers

259
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,440
attribute to Kenny Loggins.

260
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:51,040
But they do have other Footloosers.

261
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,480
They'll have like the Beatles cover band I saw last summer

262
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,680
and they have Yachtley Crew, of course,

263
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:00,520
who does all the yacht rock stuff.

264
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,520
I think not.

265
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,440
Not for this yacht rock snub.

266
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,480
I know.

267
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,440
Look, I'm conflicted about Yachtley Crew

268
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:09,720
because on one hand I go, this isn't actually authentic,

269
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:13,240
but they do put on a show that makes a bunch of people

270
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:16,600
in the mid 50s to mid 60s go nuts.

271
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,760
I saw it happen.

272
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,280
They had their chance to go nuts.

273
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,520
Their nuts time is over.

274
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,400
When they. It's our time to go now.

275
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,320
It was our time to go nuts.

276
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,560
13 years ago.

277
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,280
When they do ride like the wind though,

278
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:30,040
these people, these old folks with the sailor hats on

279
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,200
go fucking nuts.

280
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,040
I would hate that.

281
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,760
I would hate this. I think you should go

282
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,440
if they play again. No, no, no.

283
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,600
I really do.

284
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,440
But they do.

285
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,480
They do toto.

286
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,400
You'll probably get mad.

287
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,240
I will.

288
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,560
It's not going to be the right arranger.

289
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,880
I'm going to find like 12 wrong things with every song.

290
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:48,000
But the Starlight Bowl itself is really fun

291
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,880
because it's in the middle of the hills.

292
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:52,200
It's like a falling apart Greek theater,

293
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,440
but it's beautiful up there.

294
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,400
And tinfoil beef.

295
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,600
Yeah. And you can get tinfoil beef.

296
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,760
You can park over at the golf course across the street.

297
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,800
So anyway, Mr. Disney was friends with the,

298
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,760
like the conductor of the symphony or the Burbank

299
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,960
Symphony Orchestra.

300
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:06,800
Wow.

301
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,200
And that's why he was at this performance and he saw Annette

302
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,800
and he called her in for the audition and she, boy,

303
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,240
and it was great and wonderful.

304
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,840
And she was the greatest little girl.

305
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,480
And so, yeah, so she joined the cast and was like

306
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,000
the most famous imagineer, Jesus Christ.

307
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,440
Look how nervous I am.

308
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,160
The most famous Mouseketeer.

309
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,840
And according to this A&E special,

310
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:32,120
she got 6,000 letters a week.

311
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:36,120
And she was so like, and all the boys wanted to give her

312
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:39,720
a smooch and all the girls wanted to be her or whatever.

313
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,560
Uh-huh.

314
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,120
So really the first one of these,

315
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,960
I've always heard that context.

316
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:45,800
Oh yeah, yeah.

317
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,640
This is the machine.

318
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:51,000
This is the beginning of the machine of the young girl

319
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,560
who is not only on the show, but then the music career.

320
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,760
There is no Hilary Duff or Selena Gomez or Demi Lovato.

321
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:02,000
There's not all of these people who the system destroys.

322
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,960
Yes.

323
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,080
Without a net.

324
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,920
Although with her, everything was wonderful.

325
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,920
Everything was wonderful and she's never said otherwise.

326
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,520
So yeah, so she was in movies.

327
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:15,320
She was on TV.

328
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,800
She was in Zorro for a few episodes.

329
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,120
She was like, Mr. Disney knew I had a crush

330
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,840
on the actor who played Zorro.

331
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,880
What's his name?

332
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,440
Is that Deep Disney Lore?

333
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,400
Anybody knows?

334
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,480
I don't think it's Deep Lore,

335
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,320
but I'm forgetting his name off the top.

336
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,200
There was a time in my life I certainly would have known.

337
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:31,960
Yeah.

338
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,800
His name Guy.

339
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,640
Like thinking that out.

340
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:36,200
There was one of those guys named Guy for sure,

341
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,040
but was it?

342
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:37,880
Maybe.

343
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,560
Or was, who was the Green Hornet?

344
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,640
Guy Williams.

345
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,480
Guy Williams.

346
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,320
I never would have gotten Williams.

347
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,520
Wow, I'm gonna have it though.

348
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,360
All right.

349
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,320
Guy Williams is a perfect name for that man of that era.

350
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,640
It's really good for an old actor.

351
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,480
Yeah, yeah.

352
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,480
Supposedly a 16th birthday present from Walt,

353
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,720
her arc on that show.

354
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,680
Yes, that's what she said.

355
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:57,520
Oh, she said it.

356
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,360
Very odd.

357
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,000
I missed Disney on my 16th birthday.

358
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,560
I was like, what is he involved?

359
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,160
Mr. Disney was involved in a lot of weird,

360
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,920
like he was of course a very famously was like,

361
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,560
when you're in a bathing suit,

362
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:11,200
please cover up your navel

363
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,400
when you're doing these beach party movies.

364
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:16,800
This is by the way, a story that my mother told

365
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,000
all the time to us when we were little.

366
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,200
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

367
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,920
Well documented on the internet too.

368
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,400
Well, well documented in my house every few weeks

369
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,480
when I was aged three to 18.

370
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,200
Now, why is this story being told so much

371
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,880
is my question and to who?

372
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:32,720
To you?

373
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,560
To my sister and I.

374
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,400
To a boy.

375
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,240
Uh-huh.

376
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,680
And I believe it was my mom's way of explaining

377
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:39,560
that the reverence she had for Mr. Disney,

378
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,760
which is what she calls him in this documentary,

379
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,960
that she did do that when she was under contract

380
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,520
and while he was alive.

381
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:49,000
I thought though that the beach blanket movies

382
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:49,840
have nothing to do with Disney.

383
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,800
Well, that's her going out on her own.

384
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,400
Well, she went out on her own and so while he was alive,

385
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,880
there were opportunities for Annette to show her navel

386
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,920
and Mr. Disney put his foot down

387
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,640
if she was still gonna be doing Disney stuff.

388
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,160
Filthy navel magazines.

389
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,520
Yes, so he wanted to make sure,

390
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:09,720
but yes, eventually you can get some Annette navel.

391
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:10,560
Eventually.

392
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,400
Once he's cold.

393
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:15,680
I don't like, why does the word get bother me in that sense?

394
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,200
If I'm gonna underline that verb is the creepy word.

395
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,040
Yeah, I agree.

396
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,400
You can get some navel.

397
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:24,840
But no, I think Walt Disney calling a very young woman

398
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:29,120
into his office to explain what he wanted is really creepy.

399
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:33,400
Well, like in the beginning of weird Disney puritanicalism.

400
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,240
Yeah.

401
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,360
And Carlson puritanicalism.

402
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,800
Well, right, this story probably is where it comes from

403
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,400
with my mother telling me I'm saying.

404
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,960
Well, it was a warning about navel piercings

405
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,040
very popular in the 90s.

406
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,120
Oh, sure, yeah.

407
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,680
So that's probably where it started

408
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:50,400
where I was like, Walt, okay, I like Disney movies.

409
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:53,720
Walt Disney didn't think women should show their navels.

410
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:56,600
I don't like it when women show their navels.

411
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,280
Got it, lesson learned.

412
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,280
You felt like a real push and pull

413
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:04,040
when you went to the Wisconsin Dells every summer because.

414
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,440
When the invisible woman got that new costume

415
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:09,680
and the invisible, when she got the one that showed her navel.

416
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,520
Oh, yes, yeah.

417
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,360
You know what I'm talking about, the 90s.

418
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,200
The halter top kind of thing.

419
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,880
Yeah, it was this real like sexy costume.

420
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:16,040
I threw my issue away.

421
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,000
I said, no, thank you.

422
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:17,840
I showed my mother.

423
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:18,760
I said, look at this, no way.

424
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,320
And I threw it away.

425
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,600
Is that actually true?

426
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,440
That's where I'm.

427
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,280
That's not true.

428
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,120
Okay.

429
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:27,120
That's real that all of a sudden she had like a sexy outfit.

430
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,000
But I did not believe it as an actual moment

431
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,720
that you proudly given the current context.

432
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,480
It was not, I think you yours.

433
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,800
What was your story with them?

434
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,160
You were like upset with Madonna at age seven or something.

435
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,720
Yeah, I was recalling this with, yeah, that she's like, yeah,

436
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,720
the Disney is even involved with this.

437
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,560
Yeah.

438
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:46,400
Harlots.

439
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,240
Uh-huh.

440
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,200
No, I think this boa,

441
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:53,280
the way she seductively shakes a boa back and forth.

442
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,120
Yeah.

443
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,400
I did not.

444
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,680
All of this, all the damage was done

445
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,360
sort of in the background for me.

446
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,320
I never like performatively was,

447
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,960
I think saying anything or upset.

448
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:04,800
Yeah.

449
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,000
I was just like, when my friends were looking

450
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,760
at the naked picture on the internet,

451
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:11,320
I was closing my eyes at 15, 14.

452
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:16,320
Something really, let's hope it's 12 or 13.

453
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,920
But I don't know for sure.

454
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,760
I'm not sure.

455
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,840
I laugh, but I'm not that far off.

456
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,000
We have very similar.

457
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,600
We're very similar situations.

458
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,760
So I can look at nude photos now.

459
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:31,040
I just want to, like, it's not,

460
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,120
I'm just saying it's not like some weird,

461
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,520
I'm not as weird as that kid was is what I'm saying.

462
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,080
As weird.

463
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,720
Yeah, weird, but not as weird.

464
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,560
Yeah.

465
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,400
Oh wow, nude.

466
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,520
Look at that navel.

467
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,880
Also the way I said it was like,

468
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,960
I'm getting handed like Polaroids or something.

469
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,960
I can look at a nude photo.

470
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,640
Give me one right now.

471
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,280
I don't need a permission slip or anything.

472
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:58,520
Yeah, I don't have to call my mom and ask.

473
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,840
Oh wow, I can see that girl's, sorry.

474
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:03,160
What do you call the navels,

475
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,440
but like they're on your top parts?

476
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,600
What are those called?

477
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,440
Most girls have two of them, I believe.

478
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,440
You know what, I don't want to know actually.

479
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,080
Let me keep myself in the dark on this one.

480
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:13,920
Top navels.

481
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,960
Scientists are still investigating.

482
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:19,120
Yes, so anyway, it was wonderful.

483
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:21,600
Her experience even when Walt Disney,

484
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:25,360
apparently Walt Disney also protected her from Paul Anka.

485
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,200
Yeah.

486
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,040
That's in a couple sources.

487
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:32,040
I saw that phrase and they were only a year apart in age.

488
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,640
Right, but then they dated also.

489
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,480
Yes.

490
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,320
Oh, I didn't know this.

491
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,560
They had a relationship and Puppy Love

492
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,120
is written about Annette.

493
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,800
And they call it Puppy,

494
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,520
because that's what everyone said it was.

495
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:45,280
How old was everyone when Puppy Love was,

496
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,600
am I allowed to think this is a nice story or not?

497
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,480
Oh, oh, well yeah.

498
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,960
You said he was one year older than Annette?

499
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:53,800
Something like that.

500
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,960
Whenever it is, it's weird.

501
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,280
I don't even think we have to look it up,

502
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,720
but it's weird.

503
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,960
Yikes.

504
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,840
So then, yeah, so basically like,

505
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:05,000
how many listeners even know Paul?

506
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,560
I barely, I kind of know Paul Anka.

507
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,280
I was wondering with you and Paul Anka,

508
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,920
because Paul Anka seems like a guy,

509
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:13,440
not that musically you would be,

510
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:17,720
but he's sort of in that realm of old guy.

511
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:18,680
Yeah.

512
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,680
Interesting.

513
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,120
It wouldn't be that far off.

514
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,080
It's just maybe a random chance that I have.

515
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,280
I liked when he became the key

516
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:29,080
to unlocking the Michael Jackson archive,

517
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:31,200
because he had half recorded

518
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,760
the song Love Never Felt So Good.

519
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:35,920
So he had like the most solid song

520
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:38,520
that they built the whole remix around.

521
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:43,480
And one time I got a link to this music illuminati Zoom

522
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:46,040
that was happening during the deepest pandemic,

523
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,920
where they were like, everyone in the world,

524
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,840
Jeffrey Katzenberg was on the Zoom.

525
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:50,680
Oh, right, yes, I remember this.

526
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,600
I'm looking at him through windows,

527
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,520
like Ray Parker Jr. is on the Zoom.

528
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,480
This is so weird.

529
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,480
I'm just watching them like scratch their nose.

530
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,080
This is the weirdest thing.

531
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:02,400
And the big, Paul Anka, I think, sang My Way.

532
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,760
Oh, right, right, which he wrote, yes, yes.

533
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:05,600
I believe.

534
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,160
I don't know.

535
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:09,720
He wrote She's a Lady, Tom Jones.

536
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,160
That's a big one.

537
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,960
Tonight Show with Johnny Carson theme, Paul Anka.

538
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:14,800
Yes.

539
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,080
He's also like wrote Jingles,

540
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,320
because that's my first introduction

541
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:20,600
is when he's on The Simpsons on that Halloween episode.

542
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,000
You got Paul Anka's guarantee,

543
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,800
dear to you, Void and Tennessee.

544
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:24,640
Okay.

545
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,480
I think he's a...

546
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,080
I didn't know who he was then, really.

547
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:29,160
I just know he's like a tuxedo guy.

548
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:32,440
But he did a lot of Annette collabs.

549
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,440
Yeah, there's a full album.

550
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,680
Including dating.

551
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,520
Yeah, right.

552
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,160
There was an album and a relationship.

553
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,480
I believe it's Annette sings Anka.

554
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,200
Now I don't wanna deal with this album.

555
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,200
I wanna say this will be for later.

556
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,880
And later can be in my personal life.

557
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,360
It doesn't have to be on the podcast.

558
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:52,440
You're preparing for Annette to Nichella.

559
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,280
Yes.

560
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,280
Yes, thank you.

561
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,120
Yes.

562
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,360
Yes, thank you.

563
00:19:56,360 --> 00:20:00,200
So yeah, Paul Anka and all that.

564
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,040
So anyway, yeah.

565
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,560
So like Annette was just doing a lot of stuff

566
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,120
and they were just kind of, yeah.

567
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:09,120
This is the prototype for Quadrant Star or something.

568
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,720
Like what would you call it?

569
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,160
Somebody who can do it all.

570
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,440
Yeah, triple threat, I guess.

571
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:17,520
And that they can run the entire publicity machine.

572
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,400
And not only that, but like star of movies too.

573
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,640
And then there's the song from the movie.

574
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,760
I think all that had not been super trained.

575
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:25,840
Although what am I saying?

576
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,640
Probably like Judy Garland is kind of that.

577
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,480
Yeah, I mean.

578
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,920
Me doing it really comes from Annette.

579
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:31,760
Yes.

580
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:32,580
And here's the thing.

581
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:36,440
I don't have a lot of childhood fondness for Annette.

582
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,040
I never, I knew who Annette was.

583
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,760
I liked her perfectly fine.

584
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,400
Honestly, my memory of her, and this is sad,

585
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,800
was her in a wheelchair on the cover

586
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,640
of the National Enquirer for a decade.

587
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,480
Oh no.

588
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,480
Because my grandmother and mother used to read this

589
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,880
and it would be like Annette's last days.

590
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,200
And I swear that was 10 years.

591
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,040
And I was like.

592
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:01,600
Just ghoulishly finding bad photos.

593
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,240
Yes, which they would do with a lot of different.

594
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,400
But Liz Taylor's last day.

595
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,240
Liz Taylor really got it.

596
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,080
Yeah.

597
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,560
And I was like, she's had her last day for 15 years.

598
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,560
I mean, poor woman's been in, anyway.

599
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,800
So that was honestly kind of my memory of her.

600
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,080
So your mom did not press Annette on you.

601
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,440
You need to like this.

602
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,640
Just told the story.

603
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:20,000
And she would show, if there was some sort of special

604
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,400
on the Mouseketeers, I would watch it.

605
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,800
But that stuff isn't very accessible.

606
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:26,880
I wasn't watching that and going, wow, Cubby.

607
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:27,720
Yeah.

608
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:31,280
There's nothing on there that's so great.

609
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:34,000
Cubby the drummer for the Carpenters

610
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,680
after Karen stopped playing the drums herself.

611
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,520
Really?

612
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,360
I didn't know that.

613
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,180
She was a killer drummer and then he took over.

614
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:40,360
And he was very good too.

615
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,440
I didn't know that.

616
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,080
I kind of did know about the,

617
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,200
I had some book about the Mickey Mouse Club

618
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,000
that was released in the mid 90s that I read

619
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,280
and knew every, I like completely knew it front to back.

620
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,400
Even though the show itself didn't,

621
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,760
I think just it being Disney lore and Walt lore.

622
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,600
Yeah.

623
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,440
I was interested in it.

624
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:03,040
Something he had his hands in is like kind of part of it.

625
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,640
All right, that sounds weird too.

626
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,480
I don't know.

627
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:07,320
I didn't even know that.

628
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,480
I mean, just no wonder that's like, you know,

629
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:12,760
he's like a day on that lot for him is checking in

630
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:17,400
with Yale Gracie and working on like 20,000 leagues sets

631
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,260
and things that are going into Disneyland.

632
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:22,200
And then he'll go pop over to the Mouseketeer set.

633
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,640
And now that kiddo is doing the-

634
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,480
Starlight Bowl.

635
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,300
It's like part of the,

636
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:27,160
it feels like some of that early lore of that lot,

637
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:29,640
which I do still have fondness for.

638
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,680
I only a few years ago learned

639
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:36,360
that the Rodding Zorro sets were up for a while

640
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,560
on that lot.

641
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,400
Oh, there?

642
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,720
Like, yeah, in Burbank.

643
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:42,400
I mean, some of it, I think was shot at the ranch,

644
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,680
various ranches throughout town.

645
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:48,120
But I think they built some on the Burbank lot

646
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,880
and in one of the facelifts,

647
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:53,340
maybe right before, right at the start of Eisner,

648
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:56,840
at some point they gutted it to build more office buildings.

649
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,120
That's what happens to a lot of these,

650
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:00,240
like, cause 20th century Fox was sprawling

651
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,320
with these like, just like acres of sets

652
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:05,000
for Planet of the Apes and stuff.

653
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,200
And now it's all just boring apartment,

654
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,800
like a universal starting to like piece that stuff off,

655
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,480
turn it into other things.

656
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,320
That's what happened.

657
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,520
What a shame, history.

658
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,540
Yeah, leave the Zorro sets.

659
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:19,640
Yeah, leave them crumbling, rotten termite ridden.

660
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,200
Don't fix them or anything.

661
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,640
Smelly.

662
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:26,120
So yeah, so I think a couple of years ago,

663
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,680
I was just, sometimes I will look,

664
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:30,440
especially like old stars, believe it or not,

665
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,320
I'll look and see, did this person have an album?

666
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,320
I think maybe it was like started when I discovered

667
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:38,000
that William Frawley, Fred Murch from I Love Lucy

668
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:38,840
has an album.

669
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:39,680
He sang the old ones.

670
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,360
He sang the old ones, which one of these days,

671
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,620
Jason will sing the old ones.

672
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:44,200
I promise you that, that's my shot.

673
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,040
Mike's calling his shot.

674
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,960
Now does that, maybe that is part of Jason's month

675
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,200
or is that part of Michael month?

676
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,600
Oh yeah.

677
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,280
Cause that's my dream for you.

678
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,120
Okay.

679
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:58,120
And then you going just full, you get like a whole orchestra.

680
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,000
Yes.

681
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,520
You like actually pay for it out of,

682
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:03,480
we're not doing karaoke covers, we're getting all the,

683
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:07,000
we're getting the guys in and then you're really,

684
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,500
Jason's like singing like charmingly, you know,

685
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:13,360
off key here and there and you're like, no, no, no.

686
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:15,520
That's right.

687
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,480
Shortening bread, shortening bread.

688
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,320
You go up on shortening bread.

689
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,160
Go up with it and then you don't and flat.

690
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,400
Again, little smack and then like smack, smack,

691
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,960
because I love you and you kiss him on the forehead.

692
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,880
All right, you're my star, get it right.

693
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:30,320
Don't make me call Seth MacFarlane and replace you.

694
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,920
He can do this in two seconds.

695
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:36,720
He knows these songs like the back of his hand.

696
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,960
And Stewie could sing it.

697
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:42,020
And get two takes, one Seth, one Stewie.

698
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:46,240
He switches between the voices, it's crazy.

699
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:49,920
So, so yeah, so, so at that point, once in a while,

700
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,000
and I think everybody should do this.

701
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,840
If there's an actor you like,

702
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,400
Google and see if they made an album.

703
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,480
Cause I think it's more than you think.

704
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,440
A lot of people have done it.

705
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,080
Cause I think once you're like famous,

706
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,400
you by the way, I'm a good singer.

707
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,600
Did you know that?

708
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,880
I mean, people already forget like,

709
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:06,160
I forgot Scarlett Johansson has an album.

710
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,600
And I was singing.

711
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,560
And like everyone's tried it from the young to the old.

712
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,800
Of course, Brent Spiner data has his album,

713
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,400
Old Yellow Eyes is back.

714
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,040
It sends a future cold shot.

715
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,260
That's a future cold shot for sure.

716
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:19,880
So yeah, so I was just looking through it.

717
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:22,560
And I knew Annette was a recording artist,

718
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:27,440
but I didn't know that she has 17 albums and like 30 singles.

719
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,280
Wow.

720
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,880
And I was like, wow, I really,

721
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:34,320
I thought it was like a couple and no, it's a ton.

722
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,200
And again, there's so much here that it's good.

723
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,720
We're just going to go through my whole team,

724
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:42,040
but we could start even just then this one is an on Apple

725
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:45,000
music. So I just have something queued up on YouTube.

726
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,560
And this is Annette sings golden surfing hits from 1965.

727
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,320
Whoa. Whole surfing album.

728
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:53,840
Yes. It's I'll, I'll read the track listing sidewalk surfing.

729
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:57,160
Oh, that's the redo of Catch A Wave.

730
00:25:57,160 --> 00:26:00,320
It's about skateboarding and I was saying you did right.

731
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,120
I know a lot of these, probably you're going to know a lot of these

732
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:05,920
surfing USA surfer boys surf city, surf and Safari,

733
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:12,920
ride the wild surf Balboa blue boy to boy to love just strictly surfing.

734
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,160
No one could be prouder.

735
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,360
And then it says, and just for fun, the monkey's uncle,

736
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,880
Oh, with the beach boys, right?

737
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,720
Yeah. The song from the movie.

738
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:25,320
It starts this movie, which I've never seen.

739
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:28,720
If I have not gone past to the opening performance of Annette and the beach

740
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:32,480
boys, I think my mom showed that to me and nothing about it is memorable.

741
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:38,520
Like many live action old Disney movies is not, you know,

742
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:41,440
we were trying to watch, was it Darby O'Gill and the little people?

743
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,640
And we got like 45 minutes in, we're like, this is boring.

744
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,920
Oh my God.

745
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:51,240
The more it's so, yeah, an interesting turn lately where like they put out

746
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,840
the new Haunted Mansion trailer and you were watching.

747
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,760
It's like, this looks all right.

748
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,800
It's looks, this, this looks kind of good.

749
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,480
Like I want to see this.

750
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:04,240
You know, there is this weird tradition with Disney, like, cause you'll hear,

751
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:09,200
like this is, this is Disney's attempt to do like modern music, but they net

752
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:14,360
like Walt's squareness, I feel like has just lasted so long.

753
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,400
Like they're always a little out of it.

754
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,440
There's a, they're at least five years behind.

755
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:18,920
Yeah.

756
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,040
And the most things.

757
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:24,320
And when they do cool, like the coolest they can be is like prestigious cool.

758
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:27,880
I feel like in the sense that it's like a classic, like Oh, little mermaid

759
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:30,480
beauty and the beast, they feel like a return to the classic Disney films.

760
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,120
It's not cool necessarily.

761
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:32,400
Sure.

762
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,360
I mean, they're cool, but what for kids, but even that they had these

763
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,200
adult contemporary hits of beauty and the beast and whole new world,

764
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,560
but you wouldn't call this cool.

765
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:40,840
No, you would not call it.

766
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,000
It's very easy.

767
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,160
Listen, which Shrek was kind of cool when it came out.

768
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,320
Exactly.

769
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:49,680
What of the zeitgeist smash mouth?

770
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:50,520
What could be cool?

771
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,000
Yeah.

772
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:54,560
Can I say something that might make you mad real quick about smash mouth?

773
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,320
Which one?

774
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:56,840
Me or him?

775
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:57,760
No, Scott.

776
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:58,240
Oh Scott.

777
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:58,600
Okay.

778
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,800
Anything I say about smash mouth, you'll be fine with it.

779
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:01,680
Sure.

780
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,400
I think that was it.

781
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,840
That's my astral lounge.

782
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,040
That's my mind palace.

783
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:05,600
That's where I go.

784
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,440
I just go into the cover of that record.

785
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,680
Your mental astral lounge.

786
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:08,920
Yeah.

787
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:12,360
I think there's a period of time, and I don't know what years I'm talking about

788
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:17,840
where somebody could hear walking on the sun and some of Odellay and go, these

789
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,720
guys are both on the same level.

790
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,040
That person was me.

791
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:24,000
I got into those things at the same time at that age.

792
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:24,520
Yeah, of course.

793
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:29,600
What I liked on the radio was like, I was like, what's my way into current music?

794
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:34,760
Me, a 13 year old who's like I'm 40 for no particular reason.

795
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:38,000
Cause I read a Mickey Mouse club book and I was like, Oh, I like music.

796
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:38,880
It's the current music.

797
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,080
It sounds like older music.

798
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:40,440
Yeah.

799
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:43,960
There's this, oh, walking on the sun is cool and new pollution is cool.

800
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,240
They were the same to me.

801
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:50,200
And then one became this kind of like era defining, never ending musician.

802
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:56,280
And one became a, a band that plays at COVID spreading motorcycle rallies.

803
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:59,520
They did do that, but they also play the Greek and I bet they play the starlight

804
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,480
bowl if you pay them the right amount of money.

805
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:01,800
Sure.

806
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:02,760
Well, that's something.

807
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:05,960
No, they only, they only get sun walkers, a smash mouth trip.

808
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:07,960
Were you, which does feature Steve Harwell.

809
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:08,320
Yeah.

810
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,920
He said, well, yeah, of course he's not, he's not singing though.

811
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,680
Uh, he's just playing a tambourine.

812
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:13,960
Yeah.

813
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:14,280
Yeah.

814
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:16,880
You gotta pay me more money to see these pipes.

815
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:17,520
Yeah.

816
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,240
Did you like it?

817
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,600
It ain't no joke.

818
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,960
Did you, cause I, you know, I was going through Astral Lounge,

819
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,120
which is the album after.

820
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,120
Well, all star.

821
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,520
Why are you doing this on Astral Lounge?

822
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,600
But the rest of the like singles are more retro rock.

823
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,400
All-star is kind of an outlier, a kind of a quirky novelty song.

824
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:39,920
They were not this whole thing where smash mouth is the biggest joke of a band.

825
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:40,720
They are not the word.

826
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:41,920
They're not the worst band of that.

827
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:42,200
Right.

828
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,480
They did, I think walking on the sun was pretty solid.

829
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:44,720
Yeah.

830
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:48,440
I just wondered if you had ever gotten into some of the Astral Lounge songs.

831
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,400
No, not past.

832
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:49,760
Okay.

833
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,200
Or like can't get enough of you, baby.

834
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,120
Or come on, come on.

835
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,480
I'm not so into that one.

836
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:57,480
I, with some things in enough Pizza Hut commercials, it becomes difficult to

837
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,520
can't hardly hear on its own musical.

838
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,920
We can't hardly wait.

839
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,640
Okay.

840
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,040
Anything?

841
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:02,680
Oh, that sounds right.

842
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,160
Um, so anyway, uh, so let me just put a hit plan.

843
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,760
This is, you get the vibe on this thing.

844
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:10,160
And I just want to see, cause obviously a beach boys aficionado.

845
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,160
Okay.

846
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:13,600
And that's, and that has obviously coming in here in a second.

847
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:24,560
Okay.

848
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,200
That's a capable cover.

849
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,680
That's the beach boys first song, surf and, uh, which Brian wrote for a class

850
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:35,520
project, if listeners want to guess my called shot, is it have something to do

851
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,360
with Brian Wilson?

852
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:39,360
Uh, we'll see.

853
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,040
I'll have to wait till the shot is called.

854
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:41,440
All right.

855
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:41,960
Of course.

856
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,680
Uh, so, you know, there's

857
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:56,160
this is a, what if a bunch of like, uh, anonymous 50 year olds all do the beach

858
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:56,840
boys parts?

859
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:57,440
Yes.

860
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,160
And it's like, it is funny.

861
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:02,360
Cause like the songs, it's like,

862
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:07,360
it's like swinging.

863
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:14,640
Like some of the beach early beach was like, you wouldn't necessarily, they are

864
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,600
cool, but they like, aren't cool.

865
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:17,160
Also.

866
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:17,440
Yeah.

867
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:17,960
I don't, yeah.

868
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:20,440
They don't think they start getting cool till a little, yeah.

869
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:24,120
You might say there's some listeners are like, they have never been cool.

870
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:27,760
You're saying, but if you, if you know, you know, if you know the stuff, if you

871
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:36,960
know, yeah, um, but no, this is all it's, it's capable of surf music as played on

872
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,280
the Batman TV series.

873
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,440
Exactly what I was thinking.

874
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:39,760
Yes.

875
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,160
If Batman could dance to this, no problem.

876
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:46,800
Uh, so this was later, this is after some of the albums I'm going to talk about,

877
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:49,480
but like there's so, yeah, so many different things and there's, she did

878
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:53,680
soundtracks for movies, like muscle beach party and Annette's beach party.

879
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,720
Uh, let me ask this question.

880
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:58,160
Annette at bikini beach.

881
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:00,080
She had her, it was accompanying the movies.

882
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:00,520
Yeah.

883
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:04,000
The, what do you, what's your general feeling about her voice?

884
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:04,760
Well, this, okay.

885
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:06,280
So here's, here's the thing.

886
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:08,560
We'll get into this now in these next couple albums I want to talk about.

887
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:11,840
Cause this is really the, the, the meat, I think of the episode.

888
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:16,880
She has a voice that I think is very similar and this is, it's better than

889
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:20,520
who I'm about to compare her to, but it's similar to Ringo Starr.

890
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:21,640
Yeah.

891
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:22,400
I see what you're saying.

892
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:28,200
It's not like she can like carry a tune really great, but there's something fun

893
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:32,120
about it now, I think she's a better singer than Ringo for sure, but there

894
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:35,160
is a similar style I feel to it.

895
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:39,800
And they, they early on, I think they started doubling up her vocals too.

896
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:40,560
Smart of Kay.

897
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,440
To fill it out a little bit.

898
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:47,680
And they, she's not, most of these songs, she's not being asked to like

899
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:50,720
really belt or anything, but there is something to it.

900
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,720
I understand why they were like, oh, this is kind of something.

901
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,440
It's charisma.

902
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,200
Right for the time.

903
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:59,080
And this is not far off from this is exactly the musical

904
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,440
arc of Hillary Duff.

905
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:04,880
I feel, I feel like they bought good songs for her.

906
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,880
They got like, these are solid.

907
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:10,200
So yesterday this one, we found this one on a shelf, this will work.

908
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,080
And yeah, you don't ask her to hit that.

909
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:16,080
It literally becomes another person hitting the high note, but nobody

910
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,680
cares, people like those songs.

911
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,280
And it's fine.

912
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,800
So yesterday is a pretty good song.

913
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:21,720
I haven't heard that in a while.

914
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:27,880
So yeah, so, but there is the voice works for all of it and they

915
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,280
assemble people around her.

916
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:33,240
They assemble, of course, the Sherman brothers who wrote monkey's uncle.

917
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:33,840
Yes.

918
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:36,760
And wrote tons of stuff, Disney stuff, Mary Poppins.

919
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:40,120
We have, I feel like we even talked about them enough on this podcast.

920
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:40,720
It's true.

921
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,520
It's probably its own Sherman brothers thing.

922
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:42,760
Yeah.

923
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:46,440
Uh, small worlds, the Winnie the Pooh stuff.

924
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:49,120
Uh, came into the office.

925
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:53,680
And they have a store, just like the A&E biography.

926
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:57,880
And they have no like, and boy, he was a pain in the ass.

927
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:02,240
If they do, you got to get like a cocktail in them and it's laid.

928
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,880
And even that's not that mean I bet.

929
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:07,280
But yeah, they're the, they don't, I don't know if they call them Mr.

930
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:10,760
Disney, but it sounds like in my mind, they do even there's a documentary

931
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:14,560
that's pretty good that Ben Stiller made a couple of years ago, uh, about them.

932
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,120
Is that the boys?

933
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:15,280
Yeah.

934
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,360
The boy made that movie.

935
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:16,920
I believe so.

936
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:17,440
Really?

937
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:18,000
Uh huh.

938
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:18,720
Produced it.

939
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:19,320
Produced it.

940
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:19,560
Produced it.

941
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:19,720
Weird.

942
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:20,680
Yeah.

943
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:22,360
One of the sons, I think.

944
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:23,000
Oh yeah.

945
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,560
One of his sons, cause they, cause the Sherman brothers weren't getting along.

946
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:26,520
One of them's passed away.

947
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:31,680
But yeah, the boys and waking sleeping beauty are both on Disney plus.

948
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:32,400
Yeah.

949
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:32,840
They're very good.

950
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:33,520
And pretty good.

951
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:33,760
Yeah.

952
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:33,840
Yeah.

953
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:36,760
Good stuff and critical in some moments.

954
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:37,080
So.

955
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:37,800
Yeah.

956
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,240
Not like the A&E biography.

957
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,000
No.

958
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:40,960
Oh, you know what they did?

959
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:45,160
The closest thing that they said that was critical, but they painted it as like

960
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:49,720
cute was that the ears, the mouse ears cost $50 each.

961
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:55,720
And if you lost them, your pay was docked and a net lost three and had her pay

962
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:58,960
docked, which was like $180 a week or something.

963
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,840
Well, she, but they had options for 500 a week.

964
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,200
I think when she started getting.

965
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:06,080
Well, eventually, yes, but I think early on she probably went home with nothing

966
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:08,600
one week when her ears kept getting stolen.

967
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:09,200
Wow.

968
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,160
Only way you'll learn.

969
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:14,320
But you know, yeah, that was why they kept those Koopa hats in the studio.

970
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,320
Smart.

971
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:15,480
Yeah.

972
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:16,160
Smart.

973
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:16,480
All right.

974
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,080
Let's count them all.

975
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,800
28, 29, 30.

976
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,120
You remember what happened.

977
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,840
Oh, the Mouseketeers.

978
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,080
You keep those goddamn hats here.

979
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:27,240
There's the new Mickey Mouse club.

980
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:27,680
Damn it.

981
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:28,240
Blah.

982
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,520
Bowser threw up on me.

983
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:33,640
Again.

984
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:39,560
So anyway, so these are, these are the albums I saw that I really was, I

985
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:43,680
guess tickled by again, I'm saying weird sounding stuff, but I, I.

986
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:44,200
It was fun.

987
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,320
So there's three albums I'm going to talk about.

988
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,800
One is called Dancinet.

989
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:52,240
One is called Hawaiianet and one is called Italianet and she's making the,

990
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,200
what do you call this?

991
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:56,200
Like the pizza chef, like the pizza chef on the box.

992
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:56,400
Yeah.

993
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,600
She's doing this.

994
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:57,960
Yeah.

995
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,720
And these are funny.

996
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,400
These make me laugh.

997
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:06,560
And the Hawaiianet one is actually, I think the albums in the Polynesian

998
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,360
lobby in one of the displays.

999
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,120
I think that's right.

1000
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:09,560
Yeah.

1001
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:13,080
Pretty close to the Trader Sam's.

1002
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:13,920
They have over there.

1003
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,600
So you've probably heard pineapple princess.

1004
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,040
Yes.

1005
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:18,480
Scott.

1006
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:19,920
No, you've never heard.

1007
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:25,160
I mean, that's like her number one most played song on Spotify.

1008
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:25,520
Yes.

1009
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:29,280
As if that would change the equation for me.

1010
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,160
You still have to look her up on Spotify.

1011
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,040
Which I did.

1012
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:35,320
And I was like, Oh, pineapple princess, number one monkeys uncle number two.

1013
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:38,280
I believe was her first hit, which I'm not a big tall Paul guy.

1014
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,120
I'll be honest with you.

1015
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:39,440
I know.

1016
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,440
I'm not such a tall Paul.

1017
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,360
I am a pineapple princess guy.

1018
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,200
All right.

1019
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:43,640
Okay.

1020
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:44,760
And I know how to play it.

1021
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,720
I see that's a spicy take.

1022
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,840
I say making the Italian hand.

1023
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:49,240
I know.

1024
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,680
I know how to play it on a ukulele too.

1025
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:52,640
I will say that.

1026
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:53,080
Yeah.

1027
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:55,120
I learned how to play ukulele over the pandemic.

1028
00:36:55,120 --> 00:37:00,520
But no, I probably also what listener also was like, you've probably yes.

1029
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:01,760
Oh, we've heard pineapple princess.

1030
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:02,280
Get through it.

1031
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:06,040
I think there are a decent amount of our listeners who know pineapple princess

1032
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:06,400
already.

1033
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:06,640
Okay.

1034
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,520
I think that's so this is just.

1035
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:09,960
You may have heard this.

1036
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,080
Is this in something else?

1037
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:15,840
I use it in some told it's what's in the barber star go to.

1038
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,400
It's in barbara star though.

1039
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:17,680
Yeah.

1040
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:18,280
I'm saying that.

1041
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:25,600
All day as he plays ukulele on the hill above the bay princess.

1042
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:26,600
I love you.

1043
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,680
You're the sweetest girl I've seen.

1044
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:29,680
It's in one of her movies.

1045
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:33,280
I'm gonna marry and you'll be my queen.

1046
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,760
I saw a bone.

1047
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:45,240
I'm a boy on a wall who I'm floating down the bay on a crocodile.

1048
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:53,280
He weighed at me and he swam ashore and I knew he'd be mine forevermore.

1049
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,400
I got princess.

1050
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,600
He calls me.

1051
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:59,000
So this is yes, this is pineapple princess.

1052
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:03,000
It's a single that reached top 15 in three major US trade publications.

1053
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,600
Wow, she's demolished the Beatles.

1054
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:07,400
Yeah.

1055
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:12,040
Sherman Brothers written and a lot of the stuff that the Sherman Brothers wrote is so

1056
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:17,200
funny because they get an assignment and they do what you would assume the research that

1057
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:20,040
was available to them about the topic.

1058
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:25,240
So when they're writing a song about Hawaii, they go, well, what do we know about Hawaii?

1059
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:26,240
Okay.

1060
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:29,200
Well, pineapples are there.

1061
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,200
So a princess.

1062
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,200
Okay.

1063
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,600
And then like, what's the name of one of the cities?

1064
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:34,600
Okay.

1065
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:35,600
Croc.

1066
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,600
Okay.

1067
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:39,680
Like very base level stuff, which is very, so I think that's part of, I'm trying to dissect

1068
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,520
to crocodile threat.

1069
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,520
Why?

1070
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:43,520
Thanks, Bob.

1071
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,520
Dynamite.

1072
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:49,120
So, so I think most of them marry crocodiles.

1073
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:51,280
Yeah, I read that.

1074
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:58,280
I think they, that wouldn't surprise me if that's in one of these songs.

1075
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:04,600
So I, I guess the Sherman Brothers like simplicity of songwriting is partly why I like it.

1076
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:10,360
I do like Annette singing cause it's very like Ringo.

1077
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:12,320
Yeah.

1078
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:19,040
It feels like it's like the most kitschy music possible.

1079
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:23,760
It's like the most there should be playing inside some weird Tiki store on Magnolia and

1080
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:24,760
Burbank.

1081
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:29,400
Cause this is in the, there's shelf after shelf of this in the John Waters, Simpson's mall

1082
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,400
store.

1083
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,400
Absolutely.

1084
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,400
That is the perfect place.

1085
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,360
It's that entire aisles of music.

1086
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,360
And all of it is yes.

1087
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:41,600
And that is like camp and kitsch and almost like even the bad Annette stuff is good, but

1088
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:47,520
here let's play a song called Hawaiianette, which is the first track on Hawaiianette.

1089
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:50,640
And this is what I'm saying with the Sherman Brothers where they're just like, well, what

1090
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,240
is it about Hawaii?

1091
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,520
What is Hawaii again?

1092
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:59,000
Like we had already 11 songs by the end of the day.

1093
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,000
They learned some words.

1094
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:24,160
Okay.

1095
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:44,720
Things I couldn't understand.

1096
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:45,720
Oh, that's good.

1097
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:47,960
Cause we know we wouldn't know either.

1098
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:50,640
Cause Annette doesn't speak the language.

1099
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:55,080
Like I, I, it's really funny to think of these guys who probably weren't that old when they

1100
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:56,920
were writing this, but in my mind they were 90.

1101
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:59,360
No, but this was like huge at the time.

1102
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:04,280
The Hawaiian Island, the Pacific, you know, the tea bars and that sort of thing after

1103
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,880
the war, you know?

1104
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:06,880
Yes.

1105
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:10,120
Uh, let me play a song called Blue Moo Moo.

1106
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:14,120
I believe that's not Sherman Brothers.

1107
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:24,720
I think it's a good song.

1108
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:25,720
Old fashioned.

1109
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:26,720
Old fashioned.

1110
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:27,720
It's great.

1111
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:28,720
Yeah.

1112
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:37,400
Nothing like a Moo Moo.

1113
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,400
That's right.

1114
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:43,600
The boys whistle at my Blue Moo Moo.

1115
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:53,080
People could be hiding under that tree.

1116
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:55,400
So that's the song about her getting harassed.

1117
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,400
Jeez.

1118
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,840
But that was not Sherman Brothers.

1119
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:00,200
That was again, him, Jack Pittman who wrote that.

1120
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:01,200
Okay.

1121
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,200
Believe it or not.

1122
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:03,200
I know you got fooled.

1123
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,200
Yeah.

1124
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:08,600
Cause of that's that trademark is certainly Shermany, but it had that Jack Pittman edge.

1125
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:09,600
Yes.

1126
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:10,600
Of course.

1127
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:13,040
Delved into pressing issues for women.

1128
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:17,200
His biggest hit was Beyond the Reef, which was a song Bing Crosby recorded.

1129
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,360
Not Beyond the Sea, Beyond the Reef.

1130
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:20,360
Beyond the Reef.

1131
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:21,360
The sea is not beyond the reef.

1132
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:23,640
I know that he had the most hits in the world.

1133
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:24,640
This is Pittman.

1134
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,200
I'm going to make an observation here.

1135
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:31,440
In addition to this being like the campiest thing, this is the whitest music I've ever

1136
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:32,440
heard.

1137
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:33,440
A hundred percent it is.

1138
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:38,320
There is not one, one percentage of any other influence.

1139
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:44,440
When I said this was big after the war in America, like big and white America, white

1140
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:49,160
America loved Tiki stuff, loved Hawaii tourism.

1141
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:54,920
No, this is somebody with a basic understanding of where Hawaii is and what it might be.

1142
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:55,920
Yeah.

1143
00:42:55,920 --> 00:43:00,680
But even that, I just meant like in terms of the amount of soul, if there, if you like

1144
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:05,520
ran this through a computer, how much soul on a scale of zero to a hundred.

1145
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:06,520
Negative five.

1146
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:07,520
You broke the machine.

1147
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:10,080
The soul searching machine.

1148
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:11,880
It's like children's music.

1149
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:12,880
Really?

1150
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:13,880
Yeah.

1151
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:14,880
Yeah.

1152
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:15,880
But it's, yeah, but it sounds old.

1153
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:17,480
So it's like a little bit elevated.

1154
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:19,720
It's like elevated children's music.

1155
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:20,720
So yeah.

1156
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:25,320
So let me go to, let me go to dance in that real quick here.

1157
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:33,280
So dance in that is 1961 and it's an album full of Annette trying to get you to do different

1158
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:35,080
dances.

1159
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:38,400
And again, who do we want involved?

1160
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:42,960
Of course the Sherman brothers who know all about dancing.

1161
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:46,480
They know how to light up a dance floor in 62.

1162
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:47,480
What year are we talking?

1163
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:48,480
Yeah.

1164
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:49,480
61.

1165
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:50,480
Yeah.

1166
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:53,480
This is called dance Annette.

1167
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:56,120
Funky.

1168
00:43:56,120 --> 00:44:01,120
This is now you got your soul.

1169
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:07,120
Dance Annette, dance Annette.

1170
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:11,640
I love to dance.

1171
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:15,240
Dance every chance.

1172
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:19,440
Dance Annette, dance Annette.

1173
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:21,440
Don't say maybe.

1174
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:22,440
Whoa.

1175
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:23,440
Yeah.

1176
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:24,440
Yeah.

1177
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:27,440
Come along and dance with me.

1178
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:30,440
Roll up the rug.

1179
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:31,440
Come on.

1180
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:32,440
Cool people.

1181
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:40,840
So that does groove a little more than Hawaiianette.

1182
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:42,080
Don't you think?

1183
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:43,600
It clears that bar.

1184
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:44,600
Yes.

1185
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:45,600
More than Hawaiianette.

1186
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:52,240
How often are you just earnestly listening to this music?

1187
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:57,720
I haven't listened to it in a while, but I will like pineapple princess will be on that'll

1188
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:01,880
pop up on like my random.

1189
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:04,520
So yeah, once in a while, I, not for again, not for a while.

1190
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:11,440
I go through a lot of phases with like, what old thing am I listening to for a while?

1191
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:14,080
And Annette was a couple of years ago at this point.

1192
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:16,080
So I guess I should have known when it was fresher.

1193
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:24,640
Now you've now there's some album made by like the guy who played Jimmy Olsen.

1194
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:26,200
Jimmy Olsen live at the Apollo.

1195
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:31,440
I got Jason look at that up on the real quick stage.

1196
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:33,440
It's the first minute and a half album.

1197
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:35,040
They still had to release it.

1198
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:38,080
Where are we talking about the George Reeves TV show?

1199
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:43,880
It's called like, say it was like all Superman themed.

1200
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:45,680
I'm saved again or something.

1201
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:48,960
Hey guys, who's ready to boogie?

1202
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:49,960
Save me boogie.

1203
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:50,960
Save me.

1204
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:51,960
Save me.

1205
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:52,960
Save me.

1206
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:53,960
Save me, please.

1207
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:57,880
Save me, please.

1208
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:58,880
Song is called they.

1209
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:03,720
So there's, okay, let me list the names of the songs on dancing at rock a Charleston

1210
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:09,200
rock and roll waltz, which is about Annette seeing her parents trying to waltz to a rock

1211
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:11,520
and roll song.

1212
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:14,160
But the problem is I think it's in the wrong time signature.

1213
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:15,160
Oh yeah.

1214
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:17,560
You can't, you got, it was three, four, right?

1215
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:21,600
It's not when it's not like a Weezer rock song, which is often in three, four, it's just often

1216
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:22,600
in waltz time.

1217
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:25,520
So it's not like a Weezer rock song.

1218
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:26,640
Uh, exactly.

1219
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:29,800
So Annette also covers the hokey pokey on this album.

1220
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:31,880
Jason, I think, are you excited about that?

1221
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:32,880
I am excited.

1222
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:36,840
You want to hear a little of that?

1223
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:38,320
She puts her own spin on it.

1224
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:40,520
I mean, if you're going to dance.

1225
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:47,520
You put your right foot in, you put your right foot out, you put your right foot in and you

1226
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:48,520
shake it all about.

1227
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:49,520
You do the hokey pokey.

1228
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:50,520
You got those little horns, the horn stabs.

1229
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:53,520
All right.

1230
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:57,720
You get the idea.

1231
00:46:57,720 --> 00:46:58,720
This song is called Rock-a-cha.

1232
00:46:58,720 --> 00:46:59,720
This is interesting.

1233
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:00,720
Interesting percussion.

1234
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:29,160
They did a lot of research, I think.

1235
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:50,920
I like this the way I like, like the underwater part of Small World, you know?

1236
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:51,920
Sure.

1237
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:52,920
Well, it's a Sherwin Brothers song.

1238
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:53,920
Yeah.

1239
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:56,960
On some level, I think we have to be wired to enjoy it.

1240
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:57,960
Yeah.

1241
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:01,360
I think because of all the Sherman Brothers, but it's in there.

1242
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:02,360
Yeah.

1243
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:05,960
I like, I do again, there's so much stuff that references like other countries and other

1244
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:09,200
places and there's just no, they don't know anything about it.

1245
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:11,200
They know nothing.

1246
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:13,960
Cha-cha-cha is what they say over there.

1247
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:15,760
What you think?

1248
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:20,560
Well down in Kenya, they do the Kenya bop.

1249
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:22,040
Yeah.

1250
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:26,040
So, so I'm trying to think here.

1251
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:27,040
I don't want to.

1252
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:31,560
Anyway, I asked, I was like, my mom must have listened to this at the time.

1253
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:32,560
Oh yeah.

1254
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:35,560
Because she was, my mom born in 55, I believe.

1255
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:39,240
And I don't know, have I said on the show, I don't know if I've said to you guys personally

1256
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:43,440
or at least you Mike, that she, this might add, this might give you a little important

1257
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:48,400
piece of how I was raised is that I did have a mother who, she's young when the Beatles

1258
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:51,200
are happening and she's like, absolutely not.

1259
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:52,200
Yeah.

1260
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:53,200
No.

1261
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:54,200
Filth.

1262
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:55,200
And still.

1263
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:59,000
Like this year I'm talking because there's been so many documentaries.

1264
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,720
There's get back is the Rick Rubin thing.

1265
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:02,800
My dad is making her watch all of it.

1266
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:10,280
So I believe here in 2023, she has maybe decided she is coming around on the Beatles.

1267
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:12,360
So when I hear that, I'm like, what's this?

1268
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:13,520
What was she listening to?

1269
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:15,040
She must've had some net out.

1270
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:16,040
Wow.

1271
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:17,760
I asked her, we will maybe get an answer by then.

1272
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:18,760
Okay, great.

1273
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:23,920
That's so interesting too, because your dad's had a 40 year, 40 year project basically.

1274
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:24,920
Yeah.

1275
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:34,480
Like in time, if I start now, if I start now, when Paul is 80, but it's always, I always

1276
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:39,040
have the questions of like, so wait, do you not like, do you want to know a secret or

1277
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:43,320
like what's the song that's from a musical also?

1278
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:44,320
There was you.

1279
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:45,320
Yeah.

1280
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:46,320
Yeah.

1281
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:47,320
Yeah.

1282
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:48,320
I'm like, don't you like that?

1283
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:49,320
Cause that's from a musical.

1284
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:50,320
You like those?

1285
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:51,320
And she's like, no, terrible version.

1286
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:54,080
Like he couldn't sing like whoever else sing.

1287
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:55,080
Do you know Jason?

1288
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:59,680
It's from the music band.

1289
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:03,200
Robert Preston did it in the movie.

1290
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:07,760
I think the album version, the Beatles version is pretty sweet.

1291
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:08,760
Like I think it's very charming.

1292
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:09,760
Of course it is.

1293
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:16,160
But on my mom, at least until very recently heard that and it sounded like the sex pistols.

1294
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:23,320
Like she's running it through these punkers ruining the Robert Preston's beautiful ballad.

1295
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:24,320
Yeah.

1296
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:27,800
Anyway, I just, I'm curious what she's going to say if she takes me back.

1297
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:28,800
All right.

1298
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:31,160
Well, we may have to do a second episode.

1299
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:33,680
So let's go to the, I can come back.

1300
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:38,120
I just, I want to make sure we get to my favorite stuff is, which is on Italianettes.

1301
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:40,160
And if you, you'll see a picture, I'm sure we'll post it.

1302
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:44,160
And if you didn't see it, this is the cover and it's so funny.

1303
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:45,160
Pretty good.

1304
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:46,160
She's got the tune.

1305
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:48,240
Hey, I'm doing the pizza chef.

1306
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:49,600
But in such a nice way.

1307
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:51,160
It's a wonderful way.

1308
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:53,840
So she's doing it like a magazine food.

1309
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:55,880
It should be in the magazine or something.

1310
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:57,000
That's very awesome.

1311
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:20,440
And we'll play the first song, which is called an Italianette.

1312
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:46,720
Again, think of those old man, like what is, what are Italians?

1313
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:47,720
Pizza pie.

1314
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:49,360
Yeah, that's it.

1315
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:50,680
So good.

1316
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:52,400
What a good line.

1317
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:55,480
The second verse is about like, then I saw the sauce boy.

1318
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:56,480
What are we having?

1319
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:57,480
The pizza boy.

1320
00:51:57,480 --> 00:52:04,960
The themed albums I wish she had kept up more.

1321
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:06,320
Cause like Hawaiian and Italian.

1322
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:08,600
I wish we went to like a Sufjan Stevens thing.

1323
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:13,480
Oh, do like the UN, do all the UN countries.

1324
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:14,480
Yeah.

1325
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:27,120
So this, I don't know.

1326
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:31,720
So, so far, would you say what's your favorite Italian at your favorite or would you say

1327
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:38,640
that dancing that was, there was one of the, it was that tropical one with pineapple princess.

1328
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:40,680
No, they'd had the percussion.

1329
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:41,680
That was kind of interesting.

1330
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:43,080
It was several songs back.

1331
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:44,720
Well, we'll have to go back.

1332
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:47,000
I already don't remember which one you're talking about.

1333
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,000
Okay.

1334
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,000
So there's another here.

1335
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:52,680
Let me play a song that I, this is called please, please senior.

1336
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:53,680
Say senior.

1337
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:56,680
How do you say it in Italian?

1338
00:52:56,680 --> 00:52:57,680
They didn't know.

1339
00:52:57,680 --> 00:52:58,680
They didn't know.

1340
00:52:58,680 --> 00:52:59,680
Why should we?

1341
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:05,920
And I was listening to this and I really hadn't, I listened to this and I was like, is this

1342
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:06,920
legit?

1343
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:07,920
Good.

1344
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:08,920
Senor.

1345
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:09,920
Senor.

1346
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:13,920
Senor.

1347
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:18,120
Senor.

1348
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:22,080
Senor.

1349
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:25,320
Senor.

1350
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:29,240
They have like the old school, like backup singers that pop up in here in a second too,

1351
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:33,800
that really like lays it on for the, for the nostalgia for this type of thing.

1352
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:40,360
Love can't be bought for a dowry of gold.

1353
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:41,360
Triggers.

1354
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:42,360
Yeah.

1355
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:43,360
For the bridge we need triggers.

1356
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:44,360
You gotta make sure.

1357
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:45,360
I see what this is.

1358
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:46,360
This is a step above.

1359
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:47,360
This is closer.

1360
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:48,360
We're getting into more, more, more.

1361
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:54,040
Like Gorr is like what the ultimate, the good version of what this is.

1362
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:55,040
Yes.

1363
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:56,040
It's getting closer.

1364
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:57,040
And this is a Sherman Brothers as well.

1365
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:58,040
Let the boy, the boy.

1366
00:53:58,040 --> 00:53:59,040
That's, that's kind of good.

1367
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:00,040
Yeah.

1368
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:01,040
Yeah.

1369
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:02,040
It's kind of good.

1370
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:04,040
Yeah.

1371
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:11,240
I think they bring in the full like chorus here.

1372
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:16,280
Then you got your like Disney orchestra guy.

1373
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:21,880
Like I was like, I think this song is really, it's really good.

1374
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:24,880
Slow down, you ain't racing yet.

1375
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:28,880
Well, I haven't listened to the other songs though.

1376
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:29,880
So by comparison.

1377
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:32,880
So I was like, all right, this is good.

1378
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:37,880
This could be in like a Tarantino could use.

1379
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:38,880
Yes.

1380
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:39,880
Yes.

1381
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:40,880
Yes.

1382
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:41,880
That's what I was trying to think.

1383
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:42,880
Is it in something?

1384
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:43,880
Is it like in a movie?

1385
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:51,520
I was just going through every song to like try to remind myself of all this stuff.

1386
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:55,080
And I was like, Oh, this one, this is like the standout of all of it in a legitimate

1387
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:56,080
way.

1388
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:57,080
Now, don't worry.

1389
00:54:57,080 --> 00:54:59,080
I'm not going to end or anything on a legit good one.

1390
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:01,640
Cause why would we want to do that?

1391
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:03,680
No, we need to snark.

1392
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:04,680
We have to do that.

1393
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:05,680
Yeah.

1394
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:06,680
So you know what?

1395
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:10,440
Like, let's just go to this and then we'll sort of have bonus round stuff.

1396
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:17,000
There's one song on Italianette that's I think, yeah, the perfect example of what I'm talking

1397
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,000
about.

1398
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,000
It is not a Sherman Brothers song.

1399
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:22,620
And it's written by some people that don't even like you click.

1400
00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:27,120
There's not even a click thing when you go to the discogs, but it's called, where's the

1401
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:32,040
Spamone?

1402
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:33,040
I love that dessert.

1403
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:34,880
You know, I'm always asking that.

1404
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:35,880
Yeah.

1405
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:40,440
You wake up from nightmares saying, Oh, where's the Spamone?

1406
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:41,440
Let's go real quick.

1407
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:42,440
Talk Spamone.

1408
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:43,440
Never been a big fan.

1409
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:44,440
Really?

1410
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:45,440
Is that blasphemous?

1411
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:46,440
No, I mean, okay.

1412
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:48,080
Well, let's make sure we're talking about the same thing.

1413
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:51,400
We're talking chocolate, pistachio and cherries.

1414
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:52,400
Correct.

1415
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:53,400
That's Spamone.

1416
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:57,880
It's like an ice cream or a custard or yeah.

1417
00:55:57,880 --> 00:55:59,600
But probably other things.

1418
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:00,600
Yeah.

1419
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:01,600
Yeah.

1420
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:02,600
Never, never cared for.

1421
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:06,480
I would, if you had a dish of it, I'll have it and I'm not going to throw it up or anything,

1422
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:08,840
but it's never been like my go-to ice cream.

1423
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:09,840
Okay.

1424
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:12,040
I didn't even know that was pistachio.

1425
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:16,840
It seemed like I've never had a version where, cause I, I'll do a good pistachio ice cream

1426
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:21,640
or gelato or whatever, but I feel like you have it in kind of a very cranked out, like

1427
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:24,840
it's just, I, I, that flavor is just green to me.

1428
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:28,560
You know, I think that might, I'm trying to think, maybe I haven't had Spamone in a two

1429
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:29,880
decades or something.

1430
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:30,880
Yeah.

1431
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:31,880
I mean, it's extract.

1432
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:35,520
I was thinking of it as green and it's gross or something, but maybe I'm wrong.

1433
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:38,920
Maybe really good Spamone would be really, but if you're getting that as like, that's

1434
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:43,280
your dessert at the Italian restaurant, that's kind of an Italian restaurant for your parents.

1435
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:44,280
Right.

1436
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:45,280
It's probably.

1437
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:46,280
We can go over to Vitello's.

1438
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:47,280
I'm sure they have a Spamone.

1439
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:48,280
That does sound right.

1440
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:49,280
Right?

1441
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:50,280
They're pretty good Vitello's.

1442
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:54,200
For people who don't live around here, Vitello's the Italian restaurant that's famous for where

1443
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:56,360
Robert Blake went before he killed his wife.

1444
00:56:56,360 --> 00:56:57,360
Yeah.

1445
00:56:57,360 --> 00:56:58,360
Which was on the street.

1446
00:56:58,360 --> 00:56:59,720
He went back in for his gun.

1447
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:00,720
He couldn't have shot anyone.

1448
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:02,720
He left his gun in the restaurant.

1449
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:03,720
Yeah.

1450
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:04,720
He was going to get his gun.

1451
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:07,720
Wait, I should say legally he did not do it.

1452
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:12,280
But if you are a person who believes that he, I walked, we walked the path.

1453
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:13,960
We went and found the spot.

1454
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:14,960
Yeah.

1455
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:17,720
We're steps away from this place.

1456
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:20,640
And Frank Stallone has played there, I know.

1457
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:23,840
Dick Van Dyke has played there as well.

1458
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:28,360
And I've looked into us doing a show there, but I think it doesn't make sense.

1459
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:30,440
The listeners want dinner too.

1460
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:34,080
It's a little bit like, would you like to come see us do a live podcast, but also eat

1461
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:37,120
a bunch of ravioli for like $45?

1462
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:38,120
Well, it's.

1463
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:39,120
Maybe it would.

1464
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:40,120
Yeah.

1465
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:41,120
I'm not us.

1466
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:45,440
I'm not allowed to say that, but if I was a podcast I liked, I would probably like that.

1467
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:48,320
They've, they've tried to get boozer over the years.

1468
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:52,840
Like they used to have the giant menu with like just bread sauce on whatever you want.

1469
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:53,840
Yeah.

1470
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:54,840
Kind of place.

1471
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:58,120
And then they like cut it way down.

1472
00:57:58,120 --> 00:58:00,980
Well they, but they also not talking menu.

1473
00:58:00,980 --> 00:58:03,240
They also like do comedy shows there now, I think.

1474
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:04,720
Well, there's like a supper club.

1475
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:05,720
Are we still recording?

1476
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:06,720
Tell us a little.

1477
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:07,720
Huh?

1478
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:12,200
We need a term for where it veers so local that it's, it's inaccessible.

1479
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:13,200
Localizing.

1480
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:14,200
Localizing.

1481
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:20,760
It's notable for being also across the street from a Coyote pizza cafe, which is the first

1482
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:23,080
executive chef, I think of California pizza kitchen.

1483
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:25,200
You taught Wolfgang Puck how to make pizza.

1484
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:26,200
Is that true?

1485
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:27,200
Yes.

1486
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:29,480
And this is a magical strip on Tahunaga over here.

1487
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:30,480
Yeah.

1488
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:37,120
And it also it's notable for having a salad dressing that people believe induces labor

1489
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:40,160
that like, Oh boy, this baby's still, I gotta get this baby out.

1490
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:41,960
Well you gotta go have the salad.

1491
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:45,400
Can we do the block of Tahunaga for Jason month?

1492
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:46,400
Oh, that'd be fun.

1493
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:47,400
The little shops.

1494
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:48,400
It's close to where I live.

1495
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:49,400
That's right.

1496
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:50,400
Sure.

1497
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:51,400
I like the proximity.

1498
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:52,400
And the end of the month we'll say where you live.

1499
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:53,400
Oh good.

1500
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:54,400
I am already getting pretty close.

1501
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:55,400
You're already talking to me.

1502
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:56,400
A little head, yeah.

1503
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:57,400
A little head.

1504
00:58:57,400 --> 00:59:03,080
So I'm just going to roll in the neighborhood.

1505
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:04,560
So okay.

1506
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:07,000
Let's do this and then we'll do some bonus.

1507
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:08,000
Where's the Spamoni?

1508
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:13,480
And I'll play it without further comment.

1509
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:14,480
So they really, they sleep.

1510
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:15,880
They kind of do have a little fake out here.

1511
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:22,000
They think you're going to get one of those beautiful love songs.

1512
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:39,920
We're kind of sketching a picture of a lady.

1513
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:40,920
Cooking was an art.

1514
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:55,840
When you came to dinner, this is how her meal would start.

1515
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:56,840
She brought us plenty pasta, minestrone, linguini, margherita.

1516
00:59:56,840 --> 00:59:57,840
Sorry.

1517
00:59:57,840 --> 00:59:58,840
That was the fake out.

1518
00:59:58,840 --> 00:59:59,840
That was the surprise.

1519
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:00,840
The surprise was it's fast.

1520
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:01,840
And she's going to list Italian.

1521
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:05,920
She's going to surprise you with a list of Italian foods that you haven't seen anywhere

1522
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:06,920
on this album yet.

1523
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:10,840
There's been references to pizza, but you haven't gotten a rapid fire.

1524
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:15,480
Like almost like M and M when he gets in that really fast wrapping mode, but this is a net

1525
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:16,480
spinning straight fire.

1526
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:17,480
See if she gets to mom's spaghetti.

1527
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:18,480
Spitting fire.

1528
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:19,480
Oh, see what I went back too far.

1529
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:20,480
Let's hear it.

1530
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:21,480
Here we go.

1531
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:22,480
Prepare for it.

1532
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:23,480
Cause it's a really fast.

1533
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:24,480
I think this time it's going to stay slow.

1534
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:25,480
I don't, yeah, see.

1535
01:00:25,480 --> 01:00:26,480
She brought us plenty pasta, minestrone, linguini, margherita.

1536
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:27,480
Mustacholi, gargherita, spaghetti, baccalotta.

1537
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:28,480
Ravioli, pizza roll, frittata, pasta, pasta, pasta, pasta, pasta, pasta, pasta, pasta, pasta,

1538
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:29,480
pasta, pasta, pasta, pasta, pasta, pasta, pasta, pasta, pasta, pasta, pasta, pasta, pasta,

1539
01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:58,720
pasta, spaghetti, голg學ati, food, pasta, pasta with

1540
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:06,720
I mean, where's the Bimoni did not chart? I will say that it was not one of her hits.

1541
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:12,960
There wasn't a separate Bimoni craze going on, but there'd been like a twist stuff.

1542
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:18,400
All the artists are doing Bimoni songs. Exactly. So yes, this is just a list. Again,

1543
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:23,760
whoever's writing this, just what do we know about Italians? What do we nothing? Yes, there's nothing.

1544
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:31,760
Let's go to the store. Bring a pen. Let's go to the teller. Write in our lyrics. Let's go to

1545
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:39,040
the tellers. Look at the menu. Bring your gun just in case. That's just, that's not reference

1546
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:42,320
to the other thing. Everyone just had a gun on them back in the old days. Oh, of course. Yeah.

1547
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:47,040
Oh, Sherman brother. Yeah. If they need to show. Oh, it's your brothers. Keep that. Yeah. They keep

1548
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:54,400
that thing on them. If he asked us to write a 20th song today, the third Sherman's coming out.

1549
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:05,280
The one who talks back. He insists on another meeting at Chili John's. I swear to God. Local,

1550
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:08,560
local. Local. Local. Local. It's pretty good. It's good. Try it.

1551
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:14,800
I was, I'm realizing now that I was saying the, uh, everything was wonderful. It is really like

1552
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:21,680
that Hanna Barbera, uh, uh, thing. Oh yeah. Yeah. Right. Exactly the same. It sure was.

1553
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:27,680
For some reason when old, like really old people are talking about show business, it's always,

1554
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:32,720
everything was great. You can't ever say anything was bad. Yeah. Or you can, and you can say

1555
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:41,440
horrifying. Yes. It was wonderful. I was, they, they, oh, the handcuffs, they only, uh, dug into

1556
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:47,920
my wrist somewhat as I was kept at the studio all night. They'd come in, they'd check on me after

1557
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:53,360
72 hours. The hole was one, the Waltz hole. He knew how to build a theme park and he knew how

1558
01:02:53,360 --> 01:03:00,720
to build a hole. Mr. Disney didn't like how high my high heels were. So he dangled me over a vat

1559
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:08,000
of acid. To make the heels shorter. He was right to be upset though. I hadn't cleared the inches

1560
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:13,920
with him. I hadn't cleared those heels. But then there's also like the like Kitty Kelly had a hopper,

1561
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:18,560
like the seedy Hollywood Babylon kind of like. Sure. So you're saying, yes, there were some people

1562
01:03:18,560 --> 01:03:23,680
that were. There is a lane, there is a seedy or tabloid kind of like. Yes, that's true. This is

1563
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:28,960
outrageous. What's his name? The fill up station guy who had the book that I have sitting on there.

1564
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:34,240
Yes. Yeah. Who would get, it was just like a pimp. Oh, right. Yeah. He doesn't, I don't know. I

1565
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:38,480
should, I haven't read this book. It's sitting at my mother. It was my mother's book. I'm sitting in my

1566
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:43,120
it's sitting on my table. Oh, this is the, it's the someone plays him in that California. Yes, in the

1567
01:03:43,120 --> 01:03:49,120
in the Ryan Murphy show. Yeah. But I do wonder if he was like, and then I scored a couple prostitutes

1568
01:03:49,120 --> 01:03:57,520
for Greta Garbo. And he was like, and it was wonderful. And they made love all night and they

1569
01:03:57,520 --> 01:04:05,040
were on opiates and it was wonderful. Wonderful. It was terrific. So maybe that was maybe just the

1570
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:10,560
way people talked is really what it's more about attitude. You know, that's what's sinking us now.

1571
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:16,880
We're all so upset on Twitter. Maybe we get on Twitter and say, what's wonderful right now.

1572
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:23,920
Feel better was, uh, there was a few days of Twitter discourse of like, you know what movies

1573
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:30,000
used to be nice for the nice people and the Hayes code had a lot of merits and everyone,

1574
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:36,400
people want to bring the older than nine. Like eventually everyone's like, okay, I think the

1575
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:42,480
people writing the Hayes code things are all like 19 and don't know any better. Like you have no idea

1576
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:47,760
of the history of this. I can't tell. Look, where are we old? No, we're not. We're younger people

1577
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:51,520
at heart. We're younger people. I just said this on the Mario episode. Teenage music.

1578
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:57,760
That's right. This is what the young people like good teenage music back when all the rooms were,

1579
01:04:57,760 --> 01:05:02,480
they were recorded and had lead paint. You know? Yeah, that's true. Would it make people tougher?

1580
01:05:03,360 --> 01:05:08,560
They were drinking your milk and you stand around your lead paint. Uh, well, you know what? This is

1581
01:05:08,560 --> 01:05:12,880
actually interesting. Let me, let's do this now. Uh, people might be clamoring for more in that music,

1582
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:18,160
but this is a thought exercise I wanted to give. And if I had more time, I would have,

1583
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:21,920
I came up with an idea and I wasn't able to complete it because it would have taken a lot

1584
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:27,520
of time and, uh, you know, you'll, you'll know why in a second, uh, saying that we're around today.

1585
01:05:28,080 --> 01:05:34,000
Okay. And Annette had a comeback album to make. Uh, I think a good title for this album would have

1586
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:42,960
been, would be internet and it would be about all the modern conveniences that we have now with our

1587
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:49,760
phones and our computers. And I think I did, I think for a second about making a couple Annette

1588
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:56,880
songs on the album internet. If I didn't have a child, would it be much more possible? Yes.

1589
01:05:56,880 --> 01:06:03,280
This is, this is the kind of thing that your life is being robbed of free time to create for you,

1590
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:10,560
a late thirties man to make music like a 12 year old in 1960. Yes. Cause I was, what if I was a big,

1591
01:06:10,560 --> 01:06:13,840
a big problem with, with making it, I was like, well, what would it have sounded like in the

1592
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:17,920
field? It would have just been like robot. No beep boop, boop, boop, boop. And like that would

1593
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:23,120
have been the noises on internet or just the same. I mean, like it's probably just like,

1594
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:30,000
when I just had one, it's like, like everybody's fallen for modem madness.

1595
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:42,880
Yeah. Everybody wants to check their fastness. Yeah. Uh huh. Like search engine,

1596
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:48,160
do no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no search engine. I'm searching. I'm searching.

1597
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:54,480
Where am I going to find my boyfriend? Dial up, dial up to my heart.

1598
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:57,440
Uh, so I'm not saying it's never going to happen that I'm going to do this, but

1599
01:06:58,160 --> 01:07:03,440
internet seems good. It seems right as far as like, cause I, cause yeah, these, these dance

1600
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:07,360
in it and dancing that is kind of pushing it honestly, as far as the theme go with Hawaiian

1601
01:07:07,360 --> 01:07:13,520
and Italian. I just wanted more things to blend seamlessly into Annette's name and internet to

1602
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:17,600
me seemed like the perfect one. Really perfect. I mean, if anybody, you know, sometimes they do

1603
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:24,960
these kind of like, uh, Disney songs, remixed electronic style. Yes. Well, they didn't internet.

1604
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:30,560
There's a pineapple. Wasn't there a pineapple princess remix from that awful album that we

1605
01:07:30,560 --> 01:07:35,520
would listen to 10 years ago? I'm pretty sure there was, there was some weird Annette remix

1606
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:40,480
that I didn't think was that good. And I think we played it on the show. Maybe it's possible.

1607
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:44,720
We played it. It does sound, there was a Winnie the Pooh remix. I think I was, I think I was

1608
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:51,920
playing, is it D rezzed or something was the name of the album. I think it was. There is a pineapple

1609
01:07:51,920 --> 01:08:01,280
princess song from an album called deconstructed. Yes. Yeah. This is pineapple princess. Wow.

1610
01:08:02,320 --> 01:08:07,520
Now new generations can groove to pineapple princess. They still have pineapples now.

1611
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:09,280
It's 2013.

1612
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:17,280
This is bad. But there's one, I think there was a, yeah, you've got a friend in me on there.

1613
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:24,240
But there was one I liked and I can't remember what it was. There's a D rezzed from Tron legacy.

1614
01:08:24,240 --> 01:08:29,280
No, that's not it. That's pretty good. But I'll figure that out. We need to do. Okay. We need to.

1615
01:08:29,280 --> 01:08:33,280
Yeah. So anyway, so I don't know. I mean, that's, I wanted to give the audience a sense of

1616
01:08:33,280 --> 01:08:40,400
sampling. I didn't want to give them too much. Did you have an idea for a song or just, you had

1617
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:47,040
internet, but did you go down the road at all? No more than we just talked about. Okay. Cause I

1618
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:55,840
wanted to make it first and then get inspired. That's my process. So dive in. Hollywood audition

1619
01:08:55,840 --> 01:09:01,120
popped up today that I had to do a sample of. I had to do a sample of the song. I had to do a

1620
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:07,200
Hollywood audition popped up today that I had to do. Wow. And, but there's an itch I need to scratch

1621
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:11,920
and I think it's internet. And if you have, I can use some of your things you just threw out there.

1622
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:17,840
Is it zoom or in person? Is it? Uh, no, no, it was I on tape on tape. Okay. Okay. So I asked where,

1623
01:09:17,840 --> 01:09:22,560
where would, uh, where the casting office was. Oh, okay. I would have given you the job. Yeah.

1624
01:09:23,680 --> 01:09:27,840
I mean, I can't tell you what it is. Probably. I mean, I should, well, I'll tell you off Mike, but,

1625
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:35,920
no, uh, but yeah, I'll give you the news or, oh, it's, it's, uh, yeah, it's reprising guy Williams's

1626
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:43,840
famous, famous role. Uh, so when the Williams family's participating, when, when was the last

1627
01:09:43,840 --> 01:09:50,240
sorrow reboot? Was it, there was a sequel to the mask of sorrow. Like just a, a few years ago.

1628
01:09:50,240 --> 01:09:55,920
I'm sure there was like a, a mid there was an Antonio Banderas. There were two Antonio Banderas.

1629
01:09:55,920 --> 01:10:00,880
Yeah. But wasn't it like a weird length apart? Like, weren't they like, yes, I think so. You

1630
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:06,000
know, funny enough, Andrew Grissom texting me about these two movies six days ago, I think. Wow. Like

1631
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:10,480
you watched both of them. Well, you know what? They're pretty good. Pretty fun. But there's

1632
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:14,800
probably there's Antonio Banderas, but then there was, I think there was an Antonio Sabato Jr. Zorro

1633
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:22,400
also came out last year. It's about what if Zorro was at January six. Is that true? No, no, unfortunately.

1634
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:31,360
Oh, that carving is Z into those guards and into Pelosi's desk. They should make that,

1635
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:35,360
you know, that's like twisted the twisted Pooh bear movie. Cause he's public domain now.

1636
01:10:36,240 --> 01:10:40,160
She make it Twicca Zorro's public domain. Make it twisted January six Zorro.

1637
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:44,720
And he, that's really what, you know, it's always the question of how do we get anyone to pay

1638
01:10:44,720 --> 01:10:51,360
attention to our bed right wing movies? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Isn't there a weird pan coming to,

1639
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:56,960
or am I wrong? Probably somebody's doing like a twisted pan or am I thinking of the Disney version?

1640
01:10:56,960 --> 01:11:03,120
We heard Dex about this the other day. There's the Disney live action one, but then there was also

1641
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:07,600
one made by the director of beasts of the Southern wild. Like there was like a, well, that's not what

1642
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:13,600
I'm talking about. More high brow. It's a thinking man's pan. Wendy. Was that one just called Wendy?

1643
01:11:14,240 --> 01:11:19,920
As long as there are three being made at all times, we're going to forget this story. If we

1644
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:26,240
don't tell it to each other over and over again, thank you Zemeckis for telling us Pinocchio again,

1645
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:32,080
whoever any and everyone keep making pans. I beg you. I was right. Peter Pan, Neverland

1646
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:38,080
nightmare being developed by director of winning the Pooh blood and honey. Okay. So yes, there is

1647
01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:43,040
a, there's a dark pan. This is a new talent to pay attention to. Yeah. By that, I mean, not the

1648
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:48,640
director, but the, uh, whoever's thinking to get all these rights and whoever's paying attention to

1649
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:53,920
the spreadsheet of full of like Doreen properties for Scott month, we will be doing the Peter pan

1650
01:11:53,920 --> 01:12:02,000
final four and bringing them down. I know. Oh, the greatest pans. Scott that's on Scott month. Yeah.

1651
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:07,600
Scott, it's a banner year for you. There's a new pan coming. Megan trainers got a new song where

1652
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:14,400
she, she says, I'm your mother. Tisks like it's, I'm your mother. Tisks. Oh, she samples. We are

1653
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:20,640
Sandman in it. Yeah. She's really today's Annette. Isn't she? Yeah. That's a lot. Yeah. They all have

1654
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:28,400
that kind of like fifties sixties. Yes. Yeah. Thing to it for sure. That's true. But she doesn't want

1655
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:37,840
to die. She should do a whole album of, uh, of Annette songs to answer my own question. Uh,

1656
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:46,240
the mask of Zorro was 1998, the legend of Zorro, uh, a few years later in 2005. So not a huge gap,

1657
01:12:46,240 --> 01:12:52,320
but kind of a gap. It's probably still a mask in the legend. I bet they, they overlapped. Um,

1658
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:57,840
what are we missing though? Besides your album, somebody learned how to hold a baby in one hand

1659
01:12:57,840 --> 01:13:02,720
and a ukulele in the other. Well, it's not going to be ukulele on the internet because that's not

1660
01:13:02,720 --> 01:13:07,280
going to work. I don't think I feel like it would be the same, the exact same music. And maybe there's

1661
01:13:07,280 --> 01:13:13,120
like a, but there's a solo of like, you know, uh, I think it's going to be like that McGruff voice,

1662
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:19,520
the robot on the McGruff song. I'm glad I'm me on smart kids. Everything has got everything is super

1663
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:24,880
duper like, like an old school time, like sure. Because computers are robots. That's what the

1664
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:30,240
Sherman brothers would have figured. That's right. What do we know about computers? They're robots.

1665
01:13:30,240 --> 01:13:36,080
You could have a little ukulele, but if it's going to be the internet, it's gotta be like

1666
01:13:36,080 --> 01:13:43,520
2010s, like she and him, ukulele. How do you make that distinction? I don't, I don't know. I just

1667
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:51,520
remember we were all talking about the ukulele and the like 2005 to 2012. Hmm. Okay. Well,

1668
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:56,000
I'm going to listen to that and see how it differs from the, um, pineapple princess. Everybody's

1669
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:03,680
listening to she and him and we're doing, we're all, everybody's dancing. The Zoe zap,

1670
01:14:03,680 --> 01:14:10,320
clap your hands. Say, yeah, clap your hands. I should have been in one of the Sherman brother

1671
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:16,560
songs. I do like this shirt, the Annette style music. That's just a, but that's about still a

1672
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:23,840
kind of out of date bands. But it's all, it's the era of MP3 blogs, all those bands, you know?

1673
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:28,800
Oh yeah. Yeah. Everybody's dancing to the Kaiser chiefs.

1674
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:40,080
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Kaiser chefs. What was the name of that band? My TV's on the radio.

1675
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:47,200
That holds up. I don't know why I'm saying I still like some of them get a hold of

1676
01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:55,920
MGMT. Is that the same Aaron? Yeah. My boyfriend's in MGMT. He sings great songs to me.

1677
01:14:55,920 --> 01:15:06,640
MGMT, MGMT. M for my heart. Have it fun. G is an E grand.

1678
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:12,160
Dick's there. Sherman's still alive. I think we can get him.

1679
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:21,600
Just pretend we're Walt's. We're haunting his tree. Well, hopefully it's three Walt's. He

1680
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:27,920
thinks we're always going to pull a gun on us. We don't want that. We'll end it for now. We'll

1681
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:34,400
end it for now. Okay. I think. And I just, yeah, I hope everyone enjoyed this. I wonder, yeah,

1682
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:40,960
I wonder what everyone's temperature is on Annette now, if they didn't know anything about her.

1683
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:46,160
And are they going to listen to Annette now at one of their kitschy parties? Because I feel like-

1684
01:15:46,160 --> 01:15:53,280
Are you going to commandeer the music machine? Yeah. Are you going to put me on the music machine?

1685
01:15:55,040 --> 01:16:02,560
Are these songs the MP3s of your dreams? Mike, I told you before we got started, I was trying to

1686
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:09,760
find if there were one star reviews of Annette. Oh, right. Yes. I was looking up one star reviews

1687
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:16,240
and I was looking on Amazon on the CDs and I really didn't find any, but I kind of like the

1688
01:16:16,240 --> 01:16:23,520
ones I did find. Only found one, one star review and it just says one star. It was a copy. Maybe

1689
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:30,640
I didn't read the post correctly. That was it on that review. Okay. All right. Thank you, Gloria.

1690
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:36,720
And then, so the other one was a three star review and it just said,

1691
01:16:36,720 --> 01:16:45,120
heard better, a little too much jazz and party. What? What? That was for the album, She's Our Ideal.

1692
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:50,720
I think that's one of our compilations. The other one was for Annette Ultimate Collection,

1693
01:16:50,720 --> 01:16:57,360
parentheses Beach Party. There's a lot of Annette collections on collections and compilations on CD.

1694
01:16:57,360 --> 01:17:02,160
She had a lot of compilations. Again, we couldn't get to all of them, but yeah. So,

1695
01:17:02,160 --> 01:17:06,880
so those were just mostly gripes about like the person not understanding. I think it might be a

1696
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:11,360
person griping who didn't realize they were writing a review. So they didn't know how to use the internet.

1697
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:15,680
I think it might be an old person. So maybe I'll put that in the song. Yeah. Tried to write.

1698
01:17:16,320 --> 01:17:22,880
A little too much jazz and party. They used the wrong two. They just put T-O. I also don't know

1699
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:27,440
what jazz and party. I don't know. I don't know what that means either. Is this a robot? Is this

1700
01:17:27,440 --> 01:17:35,440
somebody? Yeah. Did someone decide to type their dying words? It's a robot from 2001 of Space

1701
01:17:35,440 --> 01:17:42,560
Odyssey and it only wants to hear Daisy, Daisy, give me an answer too. Do you think auto-correct

1702
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:49,120
would be too hard of a concept for the Sherman Brothers? It might be too. It's something too

1703
01:17:49,120 --> 01:17:56,560
new that computers can do. Spell check. Spell check? Maybe. Oh, cause that sounds more. Okay.

1704
01:17:56,560 --> 01:18:05,680
MS Paint ain't it great. So yeah, it's to be like Windows 95 era. Yeah. Yeah. The last they paid,

1705
01:18:05,680 --> 01:18:11,280
it said they maybe had one final job to do once that involved a computer and they had to get their

1706
01:18:11,280 --> 01:18:17,520
granddaughter to show them. Yeah. Yeah. You flipped my footer to a header.

1707
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:27,680
Oh Clippy. He's the man for me. Oh, they, Sherman Brothers wrote the computer song from CommuniCorps.

1708
01:18:28,240 --> 01:18:35,840
Oh, yeah. Oh, so they know computers. They've talking about, what do you mean? We've known

1709
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:42,000
about computers since 82. Yeah. So there's a lot of theme park Sherman Brothers that like,

1710
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:47,040
we haven't even gotten to, what was the one I was talking about this show a while back in Japan,

1711
01:18:47,040 --> 01:18:51,920
I think it was called Meet the World. Yeah. It was for Tokyo Disneyland. I think they wrote a song

1712
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:58,720
for that. Are there 16 Sherman Brothers theme park songs? Oh, wow. Maybe. Take a look. We'll take a

1713
01:18:58,720 --> 01:19:04,880
look. Do a count. Yeah. Anyway, all 16 of them, I'm sure were wonderful. That's really all

1714
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:10,800
wonderful. And hasn't your birthday been wonderful? Yes. You got to play us your songs. Yes. So now

1715
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:17,760
let's all go out and it's five minute walk exactly to Vitello. No, don't send that.

1716
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:23,200
And we're walking, I'll tell you which direction we're walking to. Walk along with us. Go backwards

1717
01:19:23,200 --> 01:19:29,280
and you'll figure it out. Walk, walk, walk. You survived the podcast, the ride, the second gate,

1718
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:36,240
Mike's Called Shot. And for, if you want to dig even deeper, you can join us on the VIP tier club

1719
01:19:36,240 --> 01:19:42,000
three where you get one more bonus episode every month with topics selected by you, not Mike, you.

1720
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:46,720
You're the listener. Oh, you know what I should do? I forgot about this. I have it right here.

1721
01:19:46,720 --> 01:19:52,800
Mike gave out Christmas presents on the air. I have a birthday present for Mike. Okay. Really?

1722
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:57,120
Yeah. Oh yeah. You said you had another, you gave me a gift already. You gave me some candy. I just

1723
01:19:57,120 --> 01:20:03,360
gave you some treats. You gave me some tiny little lolly, like a baby pacifier candy. And candy blocks.

1724
01:20:03,360 --> 01:20:08,880
Which I didn't, I didn't a wind sack because I go, I've had these before. And some candy blocks,

1725
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:14,080
which I love candy blocks, which are like Lego candy. And I gave you candy blocks once. Scott's

1726
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:18,720
given me candy blocks before too. Yeah. Your drink to give you energy. And Jason gave me one of the

1727
01:20:18,720 --> 01:20:23,920
rock energy drinks. Oh my God. This is, this looks like it's. All right. This is glass. Oh my God.

1728
01:20:24,560 --> 01:20:32,400
Hold on. Let me put the computer down. Yeah. Okay. So this is, oh, there's multiple parts to it.

1729
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:36,800
Oh my God. There's multiple. Yeah. They did wrap it. Jason did they all have to be,

1730
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:42,800
do the listeners have to hear every part? Jason dumped like four different like bubble wrap

1731
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:49,040
gifts that I have to now rip open. This sound is driving someone insane. I like reopened them.

1732
01:20:49,040 --> 01:20:53,040
This, this is a little, but I didn't want them to get damaged. These are whatever they are. They are

1733
01:20:53,040 --> 01:21:01,680
vintage, I'm guessing. Yeah. Because it's smell. Oh my God. I have, I had these. Do you have them all?

1734
01:21:01,680 --> 01:21:05,200
No, I don't know where they are though. I had these. Oh wow. These are all the Batman,

1735
01:21:05,200 --> 01:21:10,320
Batman forever McDonald's glasses. Oh yeah. Okay. Which are. Yes. Batman and Robin.

1736
01:21:12,240 --> 01:21:15,840
These are unbelievable. I'm assuming they have some sort of terrible lead in them at this point,

1737
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:19,040
but these are wonderful cups. I don't know if these have lead. These are wonderful. They don't

1738
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:23,200
have the paint. I'm not going to open the rest of them. The return of the Jedi cups from Burger King.

1739
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:27,200
Yeah. I stopped drinking out of when I learned about the paint. Thank you, Jason. I'll open

1740
01:21:27,200 --> 01:21:32,160
the rest just off. Oh sure. Yeah. No, they were very well wrapped. The two face, the two face cup

1741
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:39,280
has the coins as the handle. Oh yes. Which is just a nice touch. So anyway, thank you for that.

1742
01:21:39,280 --> 01:21:46,853
And then I will, my appreciation. I will not dox you further. Okay. Thank you.
