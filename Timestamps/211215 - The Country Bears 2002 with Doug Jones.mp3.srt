1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,620
Well, looks like you had no trouble finding us

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:04,180
beneath that there paywall.

3
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:07,120
But watch out, the boys are a fussing and a feuding

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,800
about the Country Bears movie from 2002.

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,880
It's Country Bear Jamboree Week Day Three

6
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,900
with good old Doug Jones on Podcast the Ride.

7
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:19,320
["Jamboree Week Day Three"]

8
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:38,460
Welcome to Podcast the Ride Country Bear Jamboree Week

9
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:41,980
Day Three, the Grizzly Gate.

10
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:42,820
Why not?

11
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:45,980
I'm, hey, I'm swinging Scotty Garner.

12
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:50,900
We got big, big Carl Ralson and Jughead Jason Bonnet

13
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:55,900
Sheridan, everybody's back in the house as we delve

14
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:59,440
down here into the, into our little cave.

15
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,980
It's a little, it's a movie theater slash cave.

16
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:02,820
Yeah, that's right.

17
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:03,860
Today we're discussing a piece of cinema.

18
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:05,660
Hey fellas, hey, great bars.

19
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:07,500
We're here, of course, our characters today

20
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,220
are slightly different than the characters

21
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:11,900
you're normally, like you're used to seeing.

22
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:14,500
Okay, they just, they appear a little bit different.

23
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:17,020
They talk, a couple of them sound like exactly

24
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:19,060
like the characters that you're familiar with,

25
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:20,140
but some of them don't.

26
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:22,620
So I just want, in case you feel like we're different today,

27
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:23,660
that's why.

28
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:24,980
Slightly different.

29
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:25,980
Slightly different.

30
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:27,500
I guess I should, it should have been, we just,

31
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:30,500
it should have been Scott Betterhead, Mike Betterhead.

32
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,340
That's a good point.

33
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:32,260
It should have just been that.

34
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:34,140
Or Barrington at least, Jason Barrington.

35
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:34,980
Jason Barrington.

36
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:39,920
That's a Halloween costume or a piece of artwork

37
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:40,760
I would like to see.

38
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:43,160
Jason is Barry Barrington, please.

39
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,000
Why is, also why hasn't it been Jason Baird

40
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,120
in the whole time?

41
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,360
Oh yeah, it's much better.

42
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,680
Sitting right there, whatever.

43
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,800
But I like the big clunky that we keep adding to.

44
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:55,020
I don't have a nickname exactly prepared for our guests,

45
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:58,240
but it did occur to me that like the mounted,

46
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,480
like one of the mounted heads on the wall in the show,

47
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:06,880
he is a real buff when it comes to the country fair,

48
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:07,800
champery.

49
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,480
It's our old pal, Doug Jones.

50
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:10,800
Hey Doug, what's happening?

51
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,920
Hi Doug. Hello, hello.

52
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,120
Can't wait to talk bears with you all tonight.

53
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,960
Oh geez, wonderful.

54
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:20,060
You know, we're celebrating the show.

55
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:22,840
I feel like you're, we're here to talk about the film,

56
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,740
but I imagine you're a big fan of the show as well.

57
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:28,440
I feel like you've seen it internationally probably.

58
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,440
Yes, I saw that one in Tokyo.

59
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,280
Right on.

60
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,040
One of the best days of my life.

61
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,320
I love this show.

62
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,880
You know, every time I go to Magic Kingdom,

63
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:42,400
it's always on the list and it never gets old.

64
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,680
It's, I just saw it a month and a half ago and in October

65
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,400
and it still chokes me up every single time.

66
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,960
The songs are so good, the characters so good.

67
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:55,520
So when I got the call for Jambor Week, oh my God.

68
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,680
I'm like, I know what to do.

69
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:01,120
I'm there and apologies in advance for once again,

70
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,760
showing up here completely overprepared.

71
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,240
Oh man, we love that.

72
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:08,200
Loose leaf paper related to a bear attraction.

73
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,520
That's what you heard for the last time.

74
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,840
You're passionate about your animatronic bears

75
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:17,440
or in this case, your animatronic head bears.

76
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

77
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,760
Physical suits.

78
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,160
I don't know what you call it exactly.

79
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,400
Not puppets.

80
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,600
Yeah, I don't know what to call it either.

81
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,220
I don't want to get too much off on a tangent here,

82
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:28,480
but I just, I'm curious.

83
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,920
Yesterday we were talking about pref, like preferred shows

84
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,920
and I don't feel, I'm not mad,

85
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:38,200
but I'm just wondering, Scott and our guest guy, Selga,

86
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,600
said they prefer the summer show.

87
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,480
Are you an original guy?

88
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,320
Originalist.

89
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,600
Or are you an originalist?

90
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,440
Are you a traditionalist?

91
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,760
I think I've only seen the original show in person.

92
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:51,880
I've seen the other shows on YouTube,

93
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:55,600
which to reiterate what I was saying.

94
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,440
That's the point you've given on this.

95
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,460
Yeah, so as far as I'm concerned,

96
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:00,920
I haven't seen any other shows but the original.

97
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,920
Gotcha, so you have to be an originalist.

98
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,480
Yes. Okay.

99
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,120
Which does factor in because the vacation hoedown,

100
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,720
although I did deem it my favorite,

101
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,840
well I saw it in person long ago,

102
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,720
I deemed it my favorite still just going off the video,

103
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,280
even forgetting that, or not even knowing

104
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,160
that some of the in theater effects were very good.

105
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,240
That's what Guy was saying.

106
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,720
Like Wendell blows out some of the lights

107
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:25,040
and you hear a bear crawling up in the attic

108
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,160
and there's the surround sound.

109
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,000
So some of those things, as you have said, Doug,

110
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,920
that you need to do in person because the video doesn't,

111
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:32,760
Right.

112
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,320
Doesn't reflect it.

113
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,720
So yeah, homage to that theory.

114
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,720
So I feel like having you to talk about the film,

115
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,360
Country Bears 2002, this is one of,

116
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:49,160
there's been several ongoing debates

117
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,200
that you've been involved in on the show.

118
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,760
The most primary, well the biggest one that you've given

119
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:58,560
to podcasts, the Riot Lore, is the debate about,

120
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,760
is pizza riso good?

121
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,540
I'm so glad we finally settled that.

122
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:05,660
The answer is yes and now we could finally move on.

123
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,460
Hashtag pizza riso's good.

124
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:09,220
It's been covered, we've all agreed.

125
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:11,500
Hashtag Griffin and Newman is wrong.

126
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:16,780
I don't remember Griffin even weighing in on it.

127
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:17,620
You're keeping notes.

128
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:19,620
Oh, don't worry, it's all behind us now.

129
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:25,460
He covered it, decided, didn't have to go back.

130
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:30,460
But the other way, I think a smaller debate, I feel like,

131
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:34,220
but it's come up before, is your opinion about this film

132
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:35,500
and your opinion about this film.

133
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:38,700
Well, it might be more nuanced than it's good,

134
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,980
but I feel like you shined a light on

135
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:43,420
that maybe we should not be dismissive

136
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:45,220
for the Country Bears 2002.

137
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,060
Yes.

138
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:49,460
I had just happened to see it before I recorded that podcast

139
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:53,660
and I was really surprised because I had heard

140
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:58,660
how terrible it was and I found it delightful.

141
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:01,820
People loathe, yeah, any time I've ever heard

142
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,220
of somebody who's- Don't read, yeah.

143
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:05,500
Because they would loathe, they said they loathe it

144
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,700
and we had not seen it.

145
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,820
Our impression was just from some clips on YouTube

146
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,860
and I think, Doug, you were upset with me

147
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:13,700
because I think I said,

148
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,380
they're not even the real bears in there.

149
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:16,700
I said something along those lines

150
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,380
and you were like, they are the real bears,

151
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:19,580
those are the characters.

152
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:25,260
Okay, so let's get it out, what you guys think.

153
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,060
Okay.

154
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:28,340
I have a bigger little like,

155
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:29,820
here's how this played out for me.

156
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:31,820
Because I think there was discussion,

157
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:34,700
I think I felt like, well, to really see this through

158
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:37,420
and the debate through, it's like we should have Doug on.

159
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:39,340
But then we thought, I think we're all going

160
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:42,900
to not like this movie and we wanna have the freedom

161
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:45,780
to just maybe just kind of snark and crap

162
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:49,940
on the movie a little bit and maybe Doug would be offended

163
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:51,060
by that or not dig that.

164
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:53,580
Why don't we just see how we feel when we're watching it?

165
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,980
I was watching the movie and I thought,

166
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:57,420
I think we should get Doug in here

167
00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:00,620
because I did not dislike this movie.

168
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:01,460
Okay.

169
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:05,340
I am not a not of, I had an enjoyable time

170
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:07,660
watching the film and I am shocked by this.

171
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:10,580
I'm very surprised, but I don't know that that is the answer

172
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:11,780
for everyone in this room.

173
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:12,620
Sure.

174
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:13,780
So I appreciate your honesty

175
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:15,620
and we have all known each other long enough

176
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:17,620
that I feel like you don't have to worry

177
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:18,700
about hurting my feelings.

178
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,700
I did not work on this film.

179
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:23,860
I did not grow up, my little sister grew up

180
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,740
watching this on video tape.

181
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,100
You are not director Peter Hastings.

182
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,420
I am not.

183
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:31,380
Also credit is with the footage for Mission Space,

184
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:33,220
the Epcot attraction.

185
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,580
What a little fact before the-

186
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:35,420
You did your homework.

187
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:37,060
I did, yeah.

188
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:40,100
Yeah, I did not, I'm not attached, I didn't grow up,

189
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,460
I don't have a special childhood bond with this movie.

190
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:45,820
I just, you know, saw it for the first time recently.

191
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:46,660
So don't-

192
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:47,780
You're a wimpy convert.

193
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:49,220
Let's all just talk openly.

194
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,060
We're just gonna be-

195
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:50,900
Get it out.

196
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:53,660
Have an open, honest discussion about what we feel

197
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:54,580
about The Country of Bears.

198
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:57,260
So Scott is saying, we were talking a little bit about it

199
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:58,860
and we're like, yeah, if it's gonna be like a shit,

200
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:00,180
like just shitting on it.

201
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:02,620
Cause I think I said, I think I said a week ago,

202
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:04,660
or what, two weeks ago at this point, I think,

203
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:06,100
it's gotta be awful, right?

204
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:07,660
It has to be awful.

205
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:09,940
I said something along those lines, it has to be awful.

206
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:11,140
And I think we were all like, yeah,

207
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:12,340
it's gotta be bad, right?

208
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:13,380
And I go, okay.

209
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:15,900
So I started watching it and-

210
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,220
Want pins and needles.

211
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:21,140
I started watching it and it is, so, okay, you know what?

212
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:22,500
Let me roll it back a little bit.

213
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:25,500
Seeing clips of it and seeing like just the song,

214
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,380
like the performances in it.

215
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:28,940
Or watching the trailer.

216
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:30,100
Or watching the trailer.

217
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:30,940
Or watching the trailer.

218
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:31,820
It's not a good trailer.

219
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,900
It doesn't get you excited about watching the movie.

220
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:36,940
Immediately, I was sort of like put off

221
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:38,820
by I think the stuff that puts off a lot of people.

222
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,540
The bears look a little strange.

223
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:42,220
Some might say creepy.

224
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:44,860
The songs are sort of modern country

225
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:47,460
and you're like sort of confused by what's going on.

226
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:50,740
So it took me a little bit to calibrate.

227
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:52,260
Not that long though.

228
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,740
And once I calibrated, I was like,

229
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:58,060
this is pretty good, isn't it?

230
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:58,900
Wow.

231
00:08:58,900 --> 00:08:59,740
This movie is-

232
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:00,580
Wow, yeah.

233
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:03,580
This movie is like, I can kind of point to like one

234
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:05,580
or two things in each scene that's like,

235
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:07,380
and I'm not saying this is amazing.

236
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,460
I'm not saying it's incredible,

237
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:10,620
but like I can point to one or two things in each scene

238
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:12,980
that I go, well, that's pretty funny.

239
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:14,660
That's an idea there.

240
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:15,500
Exactly.

241
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,980
I like this, I like this song.

242
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:19,180
Or I like this, the big L's.

243
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:20,140
He said a funny line.

244
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,100
In almost every scene,

245
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,340
I can point to something that I like.

246
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:25,580
Something, right.

247
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:26,900
There's little gifts.

248
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:27,740
I agree.

249
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:28,580
There sure is.

250
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:29,420
There sure is.

251
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:30,260
There sure is.

252
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:31,220
This is the feedback so far.

253
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:33,780
I would turn now to Jason Sheridan.

254
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:34,900
Hello.

255
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:38,420
Well, Scott, with a $35 million budget

256
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:41,500
and an $18 million gross, America said no.

257
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,620
And so do I.

258
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:44,740
Okay.

259
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:48,900
Because I thought this was an unpleasant film to watch.

260
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:53,980
I thought reasonably good punch up pass did not save it.

261
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:58,700
I thought there's some voice actors I liked in it.

262
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:02,140
Steven Root, of course, wonderful in King of the Hill.

263
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:03,940
Dietrich Bader pulling double duty

264
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:07,140
as both a human character and doing voice.

265
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:07,980
Copping, yeah.

266
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:10,820
There's-

267
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:11,660
Walk-in?

268
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:12,480
Walk-in.

269
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,380
When he goes, bears, bears, or whatever.

270
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,220
I can't do a walk-in.

271
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:16,980
I don't know, I'm not Kevin Bullock.

272
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:18,340
There's some stuff I liked.

273
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:20,180
It's certainly not the worst thing

274
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:21,980
we've ever watched for this show.

275
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:22,820
It's well above-

276
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,620
That's sort of how I feel.

277
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:28,820
See, you said at the top you didn't like it,

278
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,700
but then everything you said is on my list

279
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,900
of reasons to like it.

280
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:37,180
So I think we're in agreement on a lot here.

281
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:42,180
I just, it doesn't come together for me as a movie.

282
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:46,260
I don't understand what their thinking was.

283
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:48,220
Well, I do kind of understand what their thinking was.

284
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:50,620
I think there used to be a lot more disdain

285
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:53,940
at like it was distasteful to, in poor taste,

286
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:57,900
to adapt something coarse like a ride, you know?

287
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:00,220
And that's why you see like Haunted Mansion

288
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:03,260
or Pirates of the Caribbean, those early 2000s

289
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:05,260
as they're kind of doing this, you know,

290
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:07,540
the first real round of adaptations

291
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:09,660
outside of Tower of Terror.

292
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:12,540
They've changed a lot.

293
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:18,260
I, this one, they changed a lot from the ride

294
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:21,140
and I don't know to what end.

295
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:22,980
To what, how did it help them?

296
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:23,860
How did it help?

297
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:26,820
Why did this need to happen to make the film?

298
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:27,660
Okay, well, this is,

299
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:29,980
so everybody's opinions are on the table.

300
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,660
It's three against one, not in the way-

301
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:33,100
That's what I mean.

302
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,660
I don't think I knew where,

303
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,940
I thought it was maybe gonna be a two against two.

304
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:39,580
And, but though again, let's be clear,

305
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:41,380
but when you say it didn't really come together,

306
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:44,220
I'm also like, yeah, I agree.

307
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:46,500
Clearly it didn't come together for America

308
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,660
for a lot of viewers.

309
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:50,380
But I think it does just boil down to I'm watching it

310
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:52,980
and I don't, I did not hate the fact.

311
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:55,460
I feel like that was exactly where I was expecting to land.

312
00:11:55,460 --> 00:12:00,300
I was going into it, I was more worried about like,

313
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,140
now this is the difference-

314
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:01,980
It's stressful.

315
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:02,900
I was worried going into it

316
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,820
because I go, oh man, it's gonna be awful.

317
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,060
Like I'm so worried.

318
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:08,020
And like versus like when I watched Clifford

319
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:10,500
for the first time and look, everyone listening out there,

320
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,260
we are all our little Cliffords

321
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:14,100
and we're Cliffords as well.

322
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,940
Not our big red dogs.

323
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:16,780
Not our big red dogs.

324
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:18,620
We have to clarify now there's been a big hit Clifford.

325
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:19,460
That's a good point.

326
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:21,500
It's stolen the name brazenly

327
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:24,700
from where we know should be the main source of it.

328
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,540
But most of the movie Clifford,

329
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:28,660
other than the one scene everybody likes that's funny

330
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:31,460
and the end is unpleasant.

331
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:34,900
And I was going in there like, oh yes, hell yeah.

332
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,580
Like I'm gonna be, this is gonna be,

333
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:38,500
I'm gonna tell everybody that this is actually good.

334
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,060
Like I was excited about that.

335
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,700
I love that, I love that.

336
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:45,300
It's fun often to have the opinion that like, well actually.

337
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,580
But that was, that's the difference.

338
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:48,940
Jason was like, well I watched it, I loved it.

339
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:50,420
I love Clifford.

340
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:51,500
Wait a second.

341
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,300
The Old Man Rapper Rant.

342
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,140
Huh?

343
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:54,980
That's wild.

344
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:56,540
The Old Man Rapper Rant.

345
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:57,380
The Old Man Rapper Rant.

346
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:58,220
The Old Man Rapper Rant.

347
00:12:58,220 --> 00:12:59,060
Are very funny.

348
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:01,420
I liked that they exist but I wasn't like,

349
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:02,420
oh what a good piece of comedy.

350
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:03,260
He does like a Looney Tune.

351
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:04,620
He grabs him with a rope.

352
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:08,500
He does like a Looney Tune kind of like live action cartoon,

353
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,420
the director primarily has worked in animation

354
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:14,700
and there's one or two like choices in this

355
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:15,540
where I'm like.

356
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:16,860
You're not on Clifford anymore, okay, okay.

357
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:17,700
No, no.

358
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:18,540
I didn't see the turn.

359
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:20,460
So I see, Clifford does the rope

360
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:21,900
that I think that's a little cartoony.

361
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:25,020
In Country Bears there's like a map.

362
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:26,700
There's footage of them driving on the map.

363
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:29,220
Like there's stuff that seems like right out of like

364
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:30,580
a cartoon.

365
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:32,620
And there is a cartoon, a little bit of a cartoon

366
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:33,540
in there too. Yes.

367
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:35,820
I think one of the high marks is their little cheaty app.

368
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:36,660
I love that.

369
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:37,500
Or bear up.

370
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,320
If we're talking about it now,

371
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,440
yeah, that is a moment where it became impossible for me

372
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,920
to say that I disliked the film.

373
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,800
When you were sort of, the band is mostly reunited

374
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,640
and they're like having old memories.

375
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,680
Like what's stuff from our past?

376
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,920
And they're just, they're in a hotel

377
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,560
and they're all huddled together watching

378
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,960
their old Yogi Bear style.

379
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,960
Yogi Bear and the way that they run,

380
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,520
but then the actual animation is so accurately

381
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,360
like the shitty Beatles cartoon.

382
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,240
Yes, it is.

383
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:06,360
Like it's just a knocked out kind of like badly designed.

384
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,760
They barely move or anything.

385
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,280
The voices are wrong.

386
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:13,000
It's almost like comment.

387
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,160
It's almost like a meta.

388
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,320
It's what people might say about this movie

389
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,600
if you're a fan of the show.

390
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,880
Right, right.

391
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,520
And then they're like a gassed after

392
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:25,760
and one of them says that this is bad or that was bad.

393
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,600
And that's funny.

394
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,880
And it's a funny line.

395
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,640
Funny facial performance.

396
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,520
Yeah, that moment I'm like, I can't look.

397
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,760
It's, I've gone too far here.

398
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,600
I can't say that.

399
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,040
Just like a movie that has this in it.

400
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,200
Here's a question I have for you, Doug.

401
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,880
I think a lot of the breakdown of opinions about this movie

402
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,960
and kind of where we expected to fall is,

403
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,400
well, if you really love the show,

404
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,920
you're going to hate the movie because it's not the stuff

405
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,600
that you like in the show, but you like both.

406
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,160
Do you, you don't feel betrayed by that it's that

407
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:58,200
the characters are different and they don't look the same.

408
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,680
It makes sense that they're different

409
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,760
because it's all these years later.

410
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,760
So it's the same characters, but they look different

411
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,360
because they're older, you know, big Al is like,

412
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,400
he could barely, you know, walk.

413
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:11,680
He's this old man and they've kind of taken.

414
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,520
How old are they supposed to be?

415
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,360
Taken the show that we love

416
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,200
and they've expanded the universe

417
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,440
and they fleshed out the characters.

418
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:21,400
I went back last week and watched a second time

419
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,120
just to prepare their podcast.

420
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,200
I liked it better the second time.

421
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,880
I got more references.

422
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,800
There's little, like you said, Mike, like little like treats

423
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,080
for the fans, for the people who know the original,

424
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,400
the only they would get.

425
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,600
And it's, I find that very satisfying

426
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,760
all the little Easter eggs.

427
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,920
Do you, do you remember it?

428
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,960
Cause I forget what it doesn't,

429
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,480
don't they say it's been like 20 years

430
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,680
since they they've been together?

431
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,520
Something like that.

432
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,880
They broke up in 91 and the movie is,

433
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,720
I guess it would be 10 years or so.

434
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,280
More like 10 years.

435
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,120
Okay.

436
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,400
So yeah, cause I, they have a little bit

437
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:58,920
and it's before the, the diner musical number

438
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:01,320
where they show a little bit of what I,

439
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:04,160
we were calling like tiny little box music,

440
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,200
which is what I was saying.

441
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,920
Why I still prefer the original show is that I like it

442
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:12,000
to feel a little bit more like way in the past

443
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,960
than the summer show, which to me feels a little bit

444
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:16,640
more modern because of the clothing and the music style.

445
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:19,280
You want it to be scratchy and in a tin can.

446
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,120
Exactly.

447
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:20,960
Oh my lady.

448
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,160
Oh my roly poly.

449
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,240
It's like, it's far away.

450
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,000
The music is far away when you're listening

451
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,760
to the recording and they do a little bit of it in the movie.

452
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,960
They show a little bit of a flashback,

453
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,760
but ultimately it's like much more like modern country

454
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:36,680
and also like Eagle.

455
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:41,120
It's like Eagles and like modern kind of George Strait,

456
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,960
Bonnie Raitt style country music.

457
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:44,800
Yes.

458
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,240
I mean, this brings me to, I think probably the thing

459
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,920
that I dislike the most about the movie is the music.

460
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:55,480
I think the music is tough for me.

461
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,320
Yeah.

462
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,680
It's a lot of what I will politely call baby boomer bullshit.

463
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,440
Yeah.

464
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,120
Eagles kind of like, I mean, even just like this band

465
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,920
getting back to get like, it feels like,

466
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:10,800
oh, the Eagles are back, Crosby, Sills and Nash

467
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:14,080
are back to get like, it's just like, who, what?

468
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,280
Children.

469
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,440
This is a movie ostensibly for children.

470
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:20,760
Like, how could it be so much in this that's like,

471
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:23,560
oh, this is for like the boomer parents.

472
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,400
Yeah.

473
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,200
It's like like brain fried kind of like guys would grit,

474
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:31,760
but you know what we've had our feuds, but we're family.

475
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,840
Like, yeah, why does a child want to see that?

476
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:37,240
But why does a child want to watch any of it?

477
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:40,560
Like there's no version other than like boy band,

478
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:44,360
maybe country or like young BTS bears

479
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,560
where the child would want.

480
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:50,240
I think would have been a more like of its time approach.

481
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,120
I mean, there's little odd little hints

482
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:54,240
of like 2000s music.

483
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,040
Oh, not hints.

484
00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:01,920
You have more than one like failed pop, like aspiring pop star.

485
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,080
You do not read today.

486
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,600
Are we going to talk about Crystal?

487
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,600
So let's talk Crystal.

488
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,360
Yeah, let's talk.

489
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:11,640
Yes, because I was wondering what genre of music is this sequence?

490
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,080
And the answer is Crystal.

491
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,400
Crystal, who did.

492
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,640
Crystal is the genre.

493
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:18,200
Yeah, Crystal seemingly is the genre

494
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:21,920
and did music in the Princess Diaries soundtrack

495
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,760
and the Legally Blonde soundtrack.

496
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,120
So trying to make her happen.

497
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:29,640
Yeah, there's just suddenly for context for the listener,

498
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:33,040
one of the when you go and see what all the country bears are up to,

499
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:36,160
one of them is just like a security guard on a music video set.

500
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,600
And this pop star is just like super sweet to him.

501
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,080
Just like like, oh, boy, here, well, follow me.

502
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,000
Harmonica, you play really?

503
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:50,640
And it's like the they're going so overboard to make Crystal look really humble.

504
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,480
Like Crystal's a big pop star.

505
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:58,720
But Crystal's treating this old bear past his prime, like with as much kindness

506
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,600
as if he was in her family.

507
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:03,040
It's so cool that Crystal's so down to earth.

508
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,520
But then you go, what's Crystal?

509
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,120
This is Chris.

510
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:09,400
Country Bears movie was supposed to launch your career.

511
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,400
Oh, boy.

512
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,200
This was the because I guess she if she'd done Princess Diaries,

513
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:17,200
she's like been in the Disney fold and like, yeah, giving you a big old full

514
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,920
music video. That's just like right.

515
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,480
She just has this entire five minutes to her.

516
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,520
So they really they do a good job of making her seem like something.

517
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,800
Yeah, I was like, I should know who this is.

518
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:28,520
Uh huh.

519
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:33,680
As as as they do the same for Miss Jennifer Page, the waitress who also does

520
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,680
the musical. Right.

521
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:37,640
Yes. Jennifer Page, singer of the hit song Crush.

522
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,240
Crush is a hit.

523
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,160
Yeah. A lot of remixes on that song.

524
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:47,560
Both of them, a lot of kept putting out albums like both of them worked quite a bit.

525
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,280
I'll be honest, I did not enjoy these portions of the movie, but you know what?

526
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,040
There has to be something for the kids.

527
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,920
I got it. It's Y2K.

528
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:56,840
They had to do it.

529
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:59,560
I'm I didn't let it didn't ruin the movie for me.

530
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:04,080
It's the kids demanded Jennifer Page and Crystal.

531
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,040
Yeah, it's a fine now.

532
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:10,400
Now we can now like now we can go like balls to the wall with Brian Setzer.

533
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,480
The kids are still they still got Crystal in their brain.

534
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:16,440
And it is as dated as certain parts of this movie may be.

535
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:21,560
I really think that it it holds up well to almost 20 years later.

536
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:26,600
I mean, the whole like storyline revolves around this Country Bear Hall,

537
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:31,240
which is, you know, like six years behind in background.

538
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:34,480
And like they're trying to save the venue.

539
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:38,080
And that's what's going on right now in the country after the pandemic.

540
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:42,600
Right. We have all these music venues that are closing

541
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:47,320
some that are also like behind in background and they're doing fundraisers for.

542
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:50,880
There's this whole hashtag saver stages movement going on right now.

543
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:56,040
So I I kind of find the plot that the basic bare bones plot of this movie

544
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,640
very relatable in 2021. Wow. Wow.

545
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,640
That's there's a hidden meaning you didn't even realize.

546
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:04,040
It's like if you imagine this is in a world where like

547
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:09,000
there's been like a bear specific disease, like a covid that's only for bears.

548
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,800
The bear flu. Right.

549
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:14,840
And it's it's just like really decimated, you know, the

550
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,240
bear concert venues across the country. Right.

551
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,520
And just, you know, that ups the stakes of it for me. Right.

552
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:27,600
On the other hand, what they need to save the bear hall is twenty thousand dollars.

553
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:32,240
I feel like if they put out a reissue, they would have made that money.

554
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:36,160
There's a couple. There are some logicals in this.

555
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:39,760
And I do think I have this I have this complaint a lot with with movies

556
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:44,120
that take characters that were like completely like very, very famous

557
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:48,640
at one point and then make them like completely obscure and broke,

558
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,400
which I know happens.

559
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:54,080
But if the country bears were like the biggest act ever,

560
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:58,080
which they do present them as like a huge like Eagles level band.

561
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,160
Number one song. Yeah.

562
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:03,480
They have you ever seen an episode of VH1 behind the music?

563
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,200
This is I have. Yes.

564
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,800
But they were familiar story.

565
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:09,880
The country bears, though, multiple hit albums from the

566
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,200
feeling of it, I would say, not just one off.

567
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:14,800
Well, I don't know. I like Doug's point.

568
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,800
You know, hey, that show started off with Hammer.

569
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:22,200
That was the second Willie Nelson lost all his money and star of the film.

570
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,440
The Country Bears 2002 is there.

571
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,600
That's true.

572
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,760
Is there an example of like an Eagles level band

573
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:31,200
where they all went back to regular jobs?

574
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,240
I don't think so.

575
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,960
I wish the answer was the Eagles.

576
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:41,760
That is that two part

577
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:46,200
Eagles documentary is maybe one of the best movies I've ever seen, because.

578
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:49,600
Yeah. Outside of Joe Walsh and who is the guy who joined later?

579
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,520
The soft spoken guy, Timothy B.

580
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,560
Schmidt. Yeah.

581
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:55,560
Every so many of them just come off as maniacs.

582
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:58,320
Just like cruel, like.

583
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,360
Yeah. Don Henley has resting murderer face.

584
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:04,320
Yeah. Henley's a frightening in his eyes.

585
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,480
Frightening man.

586
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,520
And a big part of this movie.

587
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:11,200
I think the thing that got me, one of the things that got me,

588
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,320
there is a scene where Trixie Trixie is in this.

589
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,880
One of the characters is named Trixie, like in the show.

590
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:21,120
The singing is done by Bonnie Raitt, wonderful singer.

591
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:26,440
And then does a duet with the very voice by Don Henley.

592
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:31,560
Henley. Yes. And I was just like, oh, like, can I back up?

593
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:34,080
Can I back up? You guys like Bonnie Raitt?

594
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,680
You're both like wonderful singer. Very good.

595
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,760
How everybody everybody's so funny.

596
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:41,120
Rae Rae is a no. I mean, I just.

597
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,880
Yes. Oh, sure. Yeah.

598
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:47,120
But if we're taking like because I go like something to talk about,

599
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:50,440
like the most I roll, you talk about boomer shit.

600
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,680
Something to talk about is think of a lamer song.

601
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,960
Yeah. Did I praise Bonnie?

602
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,640
Wait, did I just say it was like modern day country, though?

603
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,800
I just described the music.

604
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:02,240
I don't understand how that would interfere with your enjoyment of the movie,

605
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,680
because if you don't like Bonnie Raitt or, you know, like right.

606
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:10,880
Then maybe maybe she should be reduced to a singing voice of an animatronic

607
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,680
character. And that's right where you want her to be.

608
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:18,080
I think I am more annoyed that I could see the strings of the filmmakers going

609
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,120
like and the parents are just going to be out.

610
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,480
They're going to love that. Right.

611
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:24,560
Dad Henley and Bonnie Raitt's got a duet.

612
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:27,320
I was just like, geez, come on.

613
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,760
Can I describe the surreal circumstances under which I first

614
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,320
saw this film?

615
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:35,320
Not all of it, but just some of it.

616
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,400
I was this.

617
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:41,440
It's just weird detail that I was on vacation.

618
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,200
My wife and I were in Argentina.

619
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:47,400
Actually, we were in Iguazu.

620
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:50,640
We're going to see like the most beautiful waterfalls in the world,

621
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,640
which that's in Soren over the world.

622
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:56,680
Those are the waterfalls in that. And we were it.

623
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,240
It was the kind of trip where it's South America.

624
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,800
So we were just like super jet lagged the whole time.

625
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:04,880
We were just like it was all weird and surreal and it was like humid as hell.

626
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,080
And we're very tired from a lot of like the hiking

627
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,640
and just like so sweaty and like, God, we need a brother.

628
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,320
Let's just like lie in the hotel room just really quick.

629
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:17,080
And threw on weird dubbed TV

630
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:21,720
and found just turn it on straight to this scene in this movie,

631
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,960
not expecting to see it.

632
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,800
I've never seen one moment from this movie whatsoever.

633
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:28,880
I believe dubbed. I think it must have been dubbed.

634
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,640
So that's adding to the oddity of it.

635
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,080
And we're just delirious and like, what's going on?

636
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,400
And then this scene begins.

637
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,720
So it's not even the right voices to begin with.

638
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,880
It's like South American actors.

639
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:43,080
And then the singing begins and like, I'm sorry, what?

640
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,800
It is clearly Don Henley and Bonnie Rae.

641
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:48,160
I'd never heard of that.

642
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:51,840
And then as the song goes on, then there's a little moment

643
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:55,840
or cuts to them at the bar, real Henley and Rae

644
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:59,440
who turn and look at each other like, hey, not so bad.

645
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,920
Yeah, if I say so myself,

646
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:05,040
I know we just really thought like, what did we land?

647
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:10,320
Like if you go straight into that, right to the heart of love, if you will.

648
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:14,080
But that's it feels we felt so crazy.

649
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,040
We're like, is this the craziest movie?

650
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:20,520
That's why if you watch clips, you see the bears only for a minute or two

651
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,760
and your brain doesn't have time to readjust.

652
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:27,280
It needs time to learn that these bears are friendly and you like them.

653
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:31,080
And instead, I think most brains just go, oh, and like just that

654
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:33,720
that thought lingers and then that's it.

655
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,280
That colors your impression of the movie.

656
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:37,120
Very well put. Thank you.

657
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,320
I had jet lag on this movie.

658
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:41,840
I had to like my brain had to calibrate.

659
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:47,440
It has to calibrate to the snouts and the fur and the like all like body size.

660
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,240
They're all like so like they're big and they're but odd.

661
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,640
Like they're all big L sized for some reason.

662
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:56,080
That's something that's weird to me that I don't quite understand is why.

663
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:59,320
Yeah, the OK, I get them looking different

664
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:02,440
and not being the specific ones from the show in a lot of cases.

665
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:05,680
But why are they why do they all have essentially the same right body?

666
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:08,000
You can make different sizes, right?

667
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,400
I guess it'd be easier to tell them apart because it is hard to tell them apart.

668
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:14,080
I'm sorry. Who's and they're all named better head.

669
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:17,040
I agree. There's so many of them.

670
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:20,040
It's very more than a machine.

671
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:22,840
I actually had to make like a little diagram like

672
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:28,000
that was the only way I could come here tonight and truly feel prepared

673
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:32,680
to know the difference between Ted and Fred and Zeb

674
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,080
because it gets tricky.

675
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:37,960
Yeah, but yeah, it does.

676
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:43,400
It takes a while for you to wrap your head around like, OK, what I'm looking at is

677
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,360
this is all practical.

678
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:48,280
This is all done in front of the camera.

679
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:50,280
There's there is no.

680
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:52,320
You ask yourself for a second, wait a minute.

681
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:56,840
But what about the mouse or the mouse CGI or the no, no, they did it for real

682
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,240
and never did that again,

683
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:05,040
which is one of the reasons why I another reason why I appreciate this movie so much.

684
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,960
It's a technical achievement.

685
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:10,560
I mean, yes, technically correct.

686
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:13,840
But again, I say to what end?

687
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,960
Because I feel like the aesthetics are missing.

688
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,440
I feel like they're the choice.

689
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,640
I don't understand.

690
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:24,760
And I feel like the failure of movies like this doing so much practically

691
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:30,440
is what led studios to then look at how cheap CGI was becoming.

692
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:34,720
You think the failure of the country bears is why we have like CGI goop, though?

693
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,800
I think no, I didn't take it that far.

694
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,160
I think the like compounding.

695
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,680
Well, there's these shoots, I'm sure.

696
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,520
I think might might be right.

697
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,400
What?

698
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:48,880
I'm just saying like, you know, they have the cheaper

699
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:53,440
those things, any any even the good ones took up tons of time and money.

700
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:56,840
And it was just like there's no way that wasn't going to happen if

701
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:00,400
studios caught wind that they could do it faster and cheaper.

702
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:03,280
Can I propose this to this is going to seem contrary.

703
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:06,600
Everybody just like everybody's taking deep breaths before you hear what I'm about.

704
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:12,680
All right. We all grew up with the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movies.

705
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:16,040
And we, I think, are pretty passionate and love these films.

706
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:20,360
If we had been 10 years older, I don't think we like those movies.

707
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,800
Right. I think critics hated them.

708
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:27,800
And I still on by any reasonable metric, I would say those first two

709
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:30,160
especially are better movies than this.

710
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,640
I think even I think a critic would have to say that.

711
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:37,040
But aren't we like, isn't it possible that like

712
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:42,840
like like people at that time, like an adult at that time

713
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:45,760
would not have been bowled over by the like technical, impressive,

714
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,520
technically impressive nature of it.

715
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:51,040
We love it because we love the turtles.

716
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:53,960
There was no choice but to love the turtles in those years.

717
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:56,320
But like, well, it gets creepy.

718
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:59,040
That's kind of what you're getting at movies that are creepy.

719
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,760
And so sure, just like there's moments of this.

720
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:03,880
Yeah. And some people would some people criticize because like the first movie,

721
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:07,800
the turtles look a little scarier and then they get they get more cartoonish as you go.

722
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:11,480
But some people also claim they get more nightmarish in two and three

723
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:15,120
because they're trying to be more of a cartoon, which is actually a little odder

724
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:18,160
than the first one where they look, I don't know, you want to say realistic

725
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,920
or realistic.

726
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,760
So there is certainly something to that.

727
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:25,480
I'm sure many adult many an adult went into the theater and were like,

728
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,360
what the fuck is this?

729
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,720
This is against God.

730
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,000
And this is this is a

731
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,960
people creating those are easily better movies.

732
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:39,560
I agree on an aesthetic basis and a box office basis.

733
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:40,880
So yeah, yeah, yeah, that's true.

734
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,760
Yes, they were they resonated and they hit.

735
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:46,000
But I'm I do think there are people at the time would have like.

736
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:50,440
Well, right. It's for walking around anthropomorphic turtle men

737
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:55,400
who are naked with bandanas around their eyes is weird and unnerving.

738
00:30:56,040 --> 00:31:00,080
But we are we were young and we were like, you know,

739
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:02,120
so hyped up about those characters.

740
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:07,320
Now, is is the Country Bear movie?

741
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:10,720
Are those characters way more unnerving?

742
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,960
Than the turtles? Yes, probably.

743
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:17,280
Yes. But honestly, I didn't find them that unnerving

744
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:19,560
once I had watched 10 minutes of the movie.

745
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:22,680
Yeah, I had the exact same experience started it.

746
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:26,720
I always do like the test of watching it with Aaron.

747
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,160
I'm like, OK, we got like, see what you think.

748
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,640
Just sit down, see if you did and feel free to bail.

749
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,480
And I'll just watch it myself.

750
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:37,880
Yeah, starts that first concert starts where they're about as scary as they.

751
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:40,200
Aaron just said really quickly, they're scary.

752
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,560
It was in question whether we're going to keep watching it.

753
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,520
And they are just are they're aggressive.

754
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:48,000
They're like flying. Yeah, it's very aggressive.

755
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,600
Yeah. Weight is very clear.

756
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,320
They're falling through the floor.

757
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:55,080
It's a pretty you start and think like, oh, this is going to be.

758
00:31:55,400 --> 00:32:00,240
But then you just like start to it's at least it started to win us over.

759
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:03,720
And then, you know, we watch everything in two parts because baby and go to sleep.

760
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:06,200
And she's like, so save it for me.

761
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,520
Well, we'll finish it tomorrow.

762
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,960
That's a good.

763
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,080
That's a pretty big endorsement.

764
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,680
Go, Aaron. We had a good.

765
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:15,040
We had we were really looking forward to and then the next morning, like,

766
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:17,280
oh, I can't wait for country bears tonight.

767
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,680
Now it's four against one.

768
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:19,480
Great.

769
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:24,800
Like Barry Barrington, he you see him early on and he's a little boy bear.

770
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:27,320
And he looks he is unnerving.

771
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:31,440
But he out of all the bears, he made me the most uncomfortable.

772
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:34,120
But because I completely disagree.

773
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,880
Yeah, I know.

774
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:38,920
But when Barry Barrington comes back to the family, I got emotional.

775
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,920
And I'm not lying. I swear.

776
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,960
Yeah, I felt for this little guy.

777
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,560
I really like him.

778
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:46,840
I think I think he's cute.

779
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:49,840
I am the first to back you up on things that are cute.

780
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:52,080
I know. I think he's cute.

781
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,320
I am not.

782
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:55,560
Hook me to the lie detector. I think he's cute.

783
00:32:55,640 --> 00:33:01,840
I agree. But that's here's my opinion on Barry, our hero character, if you will.

784
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:05,840
He's a little bit of a Walter from the Luppets.

785
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,920
Totally. He's not an original character.

786
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:11,920
OK, totally. I mean, this is I mean, I'm not the first one to say this.

787
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:12,880
It's all over the Internet.

788
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:16,280
Yes, yes. The exact same plot as the puppet, the 2011.

789
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,960
Yeah, so many. Yes.

790
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,600
Levels. Just really quickly.

791
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,720
It's a world that is randomly spotted with its humans,

792
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:25,680
but that's randomly spotted with Jim Henson puppet creatures.

793
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,840
And there's one who feels different than the humans.

794
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,080
And he realizes he is one of the creatures.

795
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:33,720
So he goes around to reunite a fractured group in an old

796
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:38,080
claggety bus to save the old venue

797
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:42,600
that where they used to play, which is being threatened by an on the nose

798
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:46,640
villain played by an actor with a genuine, respectable body of work.

799
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:50,240
That's right. And that is a much better movie with much better music.

800
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,520
The silence, silence in the room.

801
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,640
Am I nuts?

802
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:57,560
No, I mean, that's better.

803
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:58,840
I'm not going to say you're wrong.

804
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,600
What's the song? I enjoyed that Muppets.

805
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:03,240
The Muppets. Yeah, there's that song that James Bobin

806
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,080
Muppets.

807
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:06,440
What's the what's a Brett?

808
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,320
What's his name from the flight of the conference?

809
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,160
I wrote that song.

810
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:10,520
There's an Academy Award winning song.

811
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:12,280
There's a song in there too. I like.

812
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,960
That's undeniable music is.

813
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,400
Yeah, though I music in this.

814
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,400
I like I like most of the music in the movie.

815
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,840
You like the music. Yeah, I don't.

816
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,400
I don't fall in this. Is this crazy?

817
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,840
I don't love everything, but I like it.

818
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:26,200
I'm not a fan of country music.

819
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:30,800
But this the the the Jamboree and the movie, there's

820
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,120
you can't help but to not love it.

821
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:35,800
You know, well, the music somebody likes.

822
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:39,720
I don't I'm not I wasn't crazy about the music in the movie.

823
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:42,440
But if somebody likes like contemporary country music,

824
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:45,440
I feel like they're going to love this and they're going to want to run out

825
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:50,200
and buy the soundtrack because I feel like they got that right.

826
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,240
They got it right.

827
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:54,480
They got the the vibe, the tune. Exactly.

828
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:57,120
Of course, my my preference is old.

829
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:59,600
Caught in little Jimmy Dickens.

830
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,720
You know, that's my my preference.

831
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:07,160
But of course, yeah, no, I like I like some country, modern country.

832
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,640
I like it if it's gimmicky.

833
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:11,320
We've talked about this already at this point this week a few times.

834
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:13,800
I'll be like, you know, we like Red Solo Cup.

835
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,320
You know, we like some of these other songs.

836
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:19,840
Do you consider because I was introduced into the world

837
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:23,320
of Jimmy Buffett from you and the episode that you all did on.

838
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:27,040
He's I mean, there's definitely country influences.

839
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,320
A lot of it. Yeah.

840
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,960
There's a lot of the old stuff, too, especially.

841
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:36,160
I'm a big fan of Wilco, which is alt country, I guess is what you'd call it.

842
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:41,480
So I like why you love the music in the country bears movie.

843
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:43,160
I love that you love the music.

844
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:46,080
That's a part. I don't love the music in the country bears,

845
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:48,600
but I do like the music and I could.

846
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,600
Yeah, I don't.

847
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,440
It's not it's not like the greatest I've ever heard.

848
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,080
But I like I like the Brian Setzer scene.

849
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,000
I'll be honest with you.

850
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,240
Oh, I like that.

851
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,240
I like it.

852
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:01,560
We actually I perked up because I was a nerdy little high schooler.

853
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:04,760
It was like I love when the Brian Setzer Orchestra is on Conan.

854
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,200
Oh, I.

855
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:09,400
Why didn't I get more dates in high school talking about Conan?

856
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:12,280
You know, the 1230 show and Brian set

857
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:16,440
gave buying Brian Setzer orchestra CDs at senior week, you know,

858
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,800
just doing all the cool stuff.

859
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,440
I hate Brian Setzer so much.

860
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:26,280
I devoted a really long stretch of my show, Moonbeam City,

861
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:29,920
to trying to make a shitty song like those Brian Setzer

862
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,920
just with no point other than these things suck.

863
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:36,200
Don't they rock a billy?

864
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,280
I don't know what it is.

865
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:40,520
Again, there's only two people are so fucking mad.

866
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,360
Do you hate rock them, Doug?

867
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:44,480
Do you? Am I like I don't get it.

868
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,960
Just why? Why would I explain Brian?

869
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,080
But is it the rockabilly?

870
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:50,320
Do you like hate rockabilly as an idea?

871
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,720
Yeah, I think me or a new rockabilly.

872
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:55,360
I I I agree.

873
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:58,480
I agree. OK, all right.

874
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,560
You're not like Rock this town tonight.

875
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:04,880
I mean, I'm a huge rock down down and I don't know.

876
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,440
Do I like rock this time? Why?

877
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,960
I like rock this. Why?

878
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:09,840
I don't say rock.

879
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:14,280
One sentence about why you like rock this town other than I don't love rock this.

880
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,520
I don't love rock this.

881
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,520
I'm not mad at it. Let's do it.

882
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,040
All right. Sure. I qualify.

883
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:22,440
Yeah, y'all know I'm a big like Tiki bar guy.

884
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,200
Uh huh. Right.

885
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,640
And there's a lot of I don't know.

886
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,960
I'm sure it's going to be hard to figure out.

887
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:30,720
But there's a lot of rockabilly crossover with the Tiki crowd.

888
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:31,520
Oh, right.

889
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:35,880
I see a lot of people at Tiki bars wearing Hawaiian shirts, of course.

890
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:39,640
But then also you see like the bowling shirts and the, you know,

891
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:43,480
chained wallets and and tattoos.

892
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,080
Oh, sure. Yeah. Yeah.

893
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:48,160
Yeah, it's it's it's very much feels like a piece,

894
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,800
like a lot of comic stores, less so now.

895
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:54,560
But a lot of comic stores used to be split with comic books and dungeons and dragons

896
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,840
in both places. I like comic books.

897
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,200
I like Tiki bars.

898
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:01,240
I never got into or understood Dungeons and Dragons.

899
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:03,320
I don't understand or got in.

900
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,120
I never got into rockabilly.

901
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:06,800
There you go. Yeah, I get it.

902
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,040
I get. Thank you.

903
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:10,000
I was not a rockabilly guy.

904
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:12,240
I'm not saying I'm a big rockabilly.

905
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,640
There's no photos of you.

906
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:15,600
A little flip. There's no photo.

907
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:18,600
Like a brief, like two month

908
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:21,280
fad where you got into it, you bought all these records

909
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,840
and then you sold them and changed your mind.

910
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:23,680
I don't think so.

911
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:26,360
If I had the hair like that, it was only because I wanted to dress

912
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:30,640
like one of the Ninja Turtle characters, the neutrinos who had very rockabilly

913
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,560
hair because they were from the space.

914
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,680
Rockabilly is not swing revival.

915
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:36,600
No, it's not.

916
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:37,560
He did both. Yeah.

917
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,040
Transit. He flipped it.

918
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,240
I don't like either of them.

919
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,640
I like swing revival.

920
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:43,920
I know. I really like it.

921
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,640
I'm looking through rockabilly.

922
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:47,880
Riot.

923
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,080
I did like Zoot Riot.

924
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:51,080
Yeah, I was into that at the time, for sure.

925
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:53,920
But I was not a guy who liked swing revival.

926
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,600
I was not a swing revival guy, but I liked the singles.

927
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,320
I like the hits.

928
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,920
But I'm looking like rockabilly.

929
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:03,320
They consider like old Carl Perkins songs like Honey Don't.

930
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,480
Everybody trying to be my baby.

931
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:07,520
Like, that's fun. Those are fun songs.

932
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:11,240
Are these the same type of people that go to like Dapper Day at Disney?

933
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:12,680
Yes. Yes. Yes.

934
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:13,880
There's a lot of Carl Perkins. For sure.

935
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,080
More power to them.

936
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,600
Yeah, I love that.

937
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:19,200
Yeah. But they are very, very specific.

938
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,920
What with what Dapper means to them,

939
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:25,440
because I showed up to Dapper Day once wearing kind of like a mod

940
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:30,400
Beatles 60s suit and they just kind of like they were upset.

941
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,720
Eyes at me. I was the wrong.

942
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:33,400
I was the wrong decade.

943
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,760
You were the wrong kind of Dapper.

944
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:38,960
I like there's a specific type of Dapper.

945
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,000
I love what they do. I'm not knocking them.

946
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,400
Yeah. But I can never do that.

947
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,520
I can never make my hair look like that.

948
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:47,360
I don't have access to the clothes that they have. Right.

949
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:49,880
I just can't. I can't do swinging

950
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:53,640
20s or is that right?

951
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:56,520
You know, I think you'd be OK if you did.

952
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,960
I feel like I see a lot more variety.

953
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:02,400
I don't know. I was staying at the Disneyland Hotel once and

954
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:06,200
maybe we were walking through it once and there was a Dapper Day

955
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:09,120
convention going on, but it was about to close for the day.

956
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:12,080
And I was I was like, oh, man, I would have.

957
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:14,640
Definitely bought a ticket and walked through that.

958
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:18,120
So what the convention we were at Stakehouse 55 when we met a listener.

959
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:21,160
And forgive me, I'm forgetting your name, but we met someone who was there

960
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:23,120
for Dapper Days, right? That's what you're talking about that day.

961
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,000
Well, it was Dapper.

962
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,640
They they had the convention like part of the convention center

963
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:29,400
rented out for like vendors. Right. Right. Right. Yeah.

964
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:34,040
And we both said we will do your hair and like they they have people style you now.

965
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:38,160
So maybe if knowing that maybe I could go do the Dapper Day.

966
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,520
I'll just correct myself.

967
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,600
I said swinging 20s like an idiot.

968
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,560
It's roaring 20.

969
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:43,640
Roaring 20s. Yeah.

970
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:45,520
It's like the swinging 60s. Yeah.

971
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,080
That's yeah.

972
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:51,480
I just because that's I was raised to believe I was born in the 60s.

973
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:55,400
That's more of a decade that I relate to.

974
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:57,920
Maybe I should start Mod Day at Disneyland.

975
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:59,560
That's great.

976
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:01,360
The same day.

977
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:03,640
And then and then everybody meets up.

978
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,640
Like instead of mods and rockers, it'd be like mods.

979
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:07,480
We should.

980
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:11,720
I mean, he's quadrophenic, quadrophenia, really directed.

981
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:14,600
Oh, my God. I'm so into this idea.

982
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:17,360
I'm going to go straight home and start to work on it.

983
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:20,560
I've been recruiting for Mod Day.

984
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:26,400
There's, you know, also, if you look at the musical,

985
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:29,400
like the people who came together to work on this thing.

986
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:33,160
Yeah, we got heartbreakers playing on this thing.

987
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,360
Mike Campbell and Ben Montenge.

988
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:37,520
You got Pete Thomas, Elvis Costello's.

989
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,720
Yeah, come on and catch that.

990
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:43,920
Oh, and wait a second, Doug, what you alerted me to via text

991
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:47,280
about this film and the musical. Go ahead.

992
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:55,040
Oh, I'm well, you pointed out how we've been sort of in promoting this event.

993
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:59,880
We were kind of comparing the country bears or the amount of time

994
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:03,440
that we'll be talking on all of these to get back that it's our get back.

995
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,800
Making a lot of like musical illusions.

996
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,200
The country bears like this or that.

997
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:10,120
And we've all we've devoured get back.

998
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:14,040
There is common personnel between this soundtrack,

999
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:17,160
the music, the movie and get back.

1000
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:19,840
And that is what's his name?

1001
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:21,960
Glenn Johns, Glenn Johns, really?

1002
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:26,680
And for the get back sessions with the with the wild jacket.

1003
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,480
I like he comes off well, I think.

1004
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:30,000
He does. Yeah.

1005
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,520
And he stands out because the only guy he looks and dresses cooler

1006
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,040
than the Beatles. Yes.

1007
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:37,840
Yeah. Well, you're like, who is this guy?

1008
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:39,920
It's almost like they start dressing like him a little bit now.

1009
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,520
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah.

1010
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,120
Rooftop. Right. Yeah.

1011
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:43,880
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1012
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:44,880
Clothing ideas.

1013
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:48,160
And Glenn tells John Glenn warns John or Mrs.

1014
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:50,920
Spoiler alert, by the way, at the end of the movie, Glenn

1015
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:54,360
warns John not to go with the manager that they eventually went with,

1016
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:55,880
which was a bad idea.

1017
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:58,080
Glenn is telling him, don't do it. Wow. Wow.

1018
00:42:58,080 --> 00:42:59,320
That's who Paul was against.

1019
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:03,440
And that was the three on one split with the Beatles that caused the entire.

1020
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:07,160
Right. That really like extra blew them up as a book.

1021
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:10,680
And then he made the music that brought another great band

1022
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:14,040
back together.

1023
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:15,160
It's just weird.

1024
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:19,360
Like this guy's we've all seen him now, like working on all of these.

1025
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:21,720
Yeah. Classic let it be songs.

1026
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:24,360
And he's also doing straight to the heart of.

1027
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:28,200
He did like so many of the classic Rolling Stones albums

1028
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:30,800
and a lot of Eagles.

1029
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,080
Yeah. That is where I think that's why he was hired for that.

1030
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:37,240
I think he I think he worked with this guy, John Hyatt before.

1031
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:40,600
Now, I'm not familiar with John Hyatt and the body of work.

1032
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:44,400
You could probably point to me to a John Hyatt thing or two that I would like.

1033
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:47,600
But based on my general feelings about the music in this movie,

1034
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:50,680
I'm tempted to say I think John Hyatt sucks.

1035
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:53,120
But maybe that is just

1036
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:57,080
like I'm kind of throwing him under the I'm giving him the blame.

1037
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:58,840
He's the singer of a lot of it, too.

1038
00:43:58,840 --> 00:43:59,840
Yeah. Please, anyone.

1039
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:01,320
I'm not trying to be aggressive about this.

1040
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:03,040
If there's good John Hyatt out there.

1041
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,680
I'm not going to challenge you.

1042
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:06,960
Have a little faith in me as one of his songs.

1043
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:09,800
I guess I don't know that one or version of OK.

1044
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:15,680
I'm not I'm not going to pretend I know I don't know him very well or anything.

1045
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:19,600
I just know yet that he is a guy and that's one or two songs.

1046
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:25,400
Can I just really quick just play the just so the listeners know

1047
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:29,200
and we'll post the clip, but this I can't not just here's a little

1048
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:31,360
there's the what the character.

1049
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:32,800
So this is Tennessee.

1050
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:35,360
This is one of the rights from the show.

1051
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:36,280
And he is speaking.

1052
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:39,400
It's another king of the hill voice, Toby Hus, who's so great.

1053
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:42,840
I think a really funny vocal performance.

1054
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:46,120
And then I'll skip ahead from him talking to the singing.

1055
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:56,640
Oh, Tracey, I'm all a mess on a cat of how much I miss you.

1056
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:58,160
I know you.

1057
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:07,560
Also, this is this.

1058
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:08,680
How do we feel about this?

1059
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:14,200
Come hither eyes, bear this like this sexy puppet bear.

1060
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:16,240
I was here.

1061
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:17,160
It's a.

1062
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:19,640
It's like two. It's too human.

1063
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:23,640
A little bit. You're not expecting a love story in this movie.

1064
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:26,440
So kind of, you know, it's kind of comes as a shot.

1065
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:27,640
A little too real. Yeah.

1066
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:30,800
And the guys are all comfy looking and then she's OK.

1067
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,080
Sure, sure, sure.

1068
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:33,840
I think the she's hot.

1069
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:35,360
You're saying she's hot.

1070
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:37,040
I'm too hot.

1071
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:41,520
Reason I'm uncomfortable is I'm so attracted to the Muppet Bear.

1072
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,280
No, the it's so much like

1073
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:49,560
Nala in. Oh, right, right, right, right, right.

1074
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:54,840
Just this very seductive like look, just like the fuck me eyes.

1075
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:56,600
Right. It's just what it is.

1076
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:58,280
We all know the knowledge.

1077
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:00,920
It's the second gay. You can just say it.

1078
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:07,920
Anyway, so that's the guy like, oh, God, I can't because I miss you.

1079
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:09,840
And I'll try to know I did note the eyes.

1080
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:11,240
I watch it. Can I want to?

1081
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:13,320
Those eyes striking, right?

1082
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:15,400
OK, anyway, then.

1083
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:37,880
I'm almost done. Hang on.

1084
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:43,960
I think that's where I'm like this.

1085
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:46,920
Sticks moments that astounders.

1086
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:51,000
I this is I feel like this is what adults liked.

1087
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:55,080
This is what was winning all the Grammys in the early 80s is I'm kind of like

1088
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:58,960
come to of awareness of the world around me.

1089
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:00,120
I'm like this boy.

1090
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:03,480
Adults are wrong right now. Yeah.

1091
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:07,040
Stinks the cocaine and the ludes are just going right to their heads.

1092
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:09,400
It's interesting.

1093
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:12,040
Does anyone here will have anything like they would consider

1094
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:14,360
like country that they listen to regularly?

1095
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:16,080
Anything that comes close to the genre?

1096
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:20,200
I've had like the Gramm Parsons a little bit or a little bit of Hank Williams.

1097
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:23,280
OK, the closest for me is probably like Lee Hazelwood,

1098
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:24,640
but I don't consider it.

1099
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:26,080
He's one of my all time favorites.

1100
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:29,080
Yeah, but I don't really consider him country.

1101
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:32,760
I think of him more as like cowboy pop music.

1102
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:36,000
Right, right. I mean, it's all it's all right on the edge.

1103
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:40,080
But also, you know, this isn't country music.

1104
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:42,560
No, no, no.

1105
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:43,600
But it is closer to that.

1106
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:47,680
Yeah, that old adult contemporary version of country.

1107
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:49,600
Yeah, from 25 years ago.

1108
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:51,560
But that's what it's all like.

1109
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:54,520
Even when you listen to some modern country, you go, well, take the voice out

1110
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:57,200
with the accent and just put in a pop singer.

1111
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:58,360
It's like it's not really.

1112
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:00,800
I think it's like they don't have a lot of twang.

1113
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:03,360
I think more country. I'd like it more.

1114
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:05,720
That's probably true. Yeah, I agree with that.

1115
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:09,240
I suppose supposedly a big owl

1116
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:14,400
sang blood on the saddle and they filmed it and ended up on the cutting room floor.

1117
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:15,560
So it's horrible.

1118
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:19,520
It seems like they tried to get some old country in there

1119
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:20,840
and it didn't make the cut. Right.

1120
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:25,160
I think that is one of the things that's missing for me from this movie,

1121
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:28,080
because this is a thing.

1122
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:31,560
This reminds me of like a current qualm I have.

1123
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:35,240
Like, so the Mark Davis concept art for this is so good.

1124
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:37,800
And of course, the source material show is so good.

1125
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:45,400
And I point similarly to the Jack Herbie art on the Eternals is so good

1126
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:48,080
and big and bright and interesting.

1127
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:52,360
And in that movie, they just flattened everything out, turned all the costumes.

1128
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:55,240
Everyone just looks like they're a speed skater at the Olympics.

1129
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:57,200
And the same thing in this.

1130
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:58,240
It's like, what?

1131
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:01,800
Why did they make these these choices of these costumers?

1132
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:02,760
The big looks.

1133
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:07,080
You're not. Why do you think you're going to out design Mark Dave?

1134
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:08,080
Like, I agree.

1135
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:12,080
Look, you're I completely agree with what you're saying.

1136
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:13,000
Not me, man.

1137
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,640
Fucking love Eternals.

1138
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:17,720
I'm out of here.

1139
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:19,760
Jason, you've gone too far.

1140
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:21,440
Scott's flying out of here.

1141
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:22,840
He just put us an eternal suit on.

1142
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:25,440
Grab my Kingo action figure and hit in the road.

1143
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:28,080
Put on a speed skating suit and skated out of here.

1144
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:31,040
But my god. No, no, no.

1145
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:33,680
Yeah, obviously, the original show was better.

1146
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:36,840
The original songs are better, for sure.

1147
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:43,200
But, you know, with comic books, it's an adaptation of a different thing.

1148
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:45,960
So as soon as again, 10 minutes in, I settled in.

1149
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:47,720
All right. This is what the bears look like.

1150
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:49,400
You're not getting your bears.

1151
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:51,480
You're not getting the huh huh.

1152
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:53,680
That's not going to happen for these songs.

1153
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:55,120
You're not going to have fun stuff.

1154
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:56,120
This is a different thing.

1155
00:49:56,160 --> 00:50:01,240
This is a new interpretation of a classic tale of classic characters.

1156
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:03,040
This is a different thing.

1157
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:04,080
So I agree with you.

1158
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:05,280
The original is better.

1159
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:08,360
Those characters are somewhat like Wendell alone.

1160
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:10,960
Wendell looks so funny in the original country bears.

1161
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:13,560
How would you leave Wendell out?

1162
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:15,400
That's weird. In this one, he does.

1163
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:16,680
He's a goofy character.

1164
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:17,800
Liver lips out.

1165
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:19,320
He's probably my favorite.

1166
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:22,640
There's so many characters like that are so specific.

1167
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:24,720
At least they do not.

1168
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:25,200
That's better.

1169
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:26,240
Well, they do like three.

1170
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:29,400
They give three characters, which is a nice nod.

1171
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:29,800
Right.

1172
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:32,520
But you go, well, those characters are even more specific.

1173
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:35,160
Like, did they look exactly like these other bears too?

1174
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:37,040
So, of course, I don't know.

1175
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:40,640
I would love to know why they decided to take the characters.

1176
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:42,800
They used a lot of the five bear rugs.

1177
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:43,480
Yes.

1178
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:43,960
Yeah.

1179
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:46,400
And that makes sense because these...

1180
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:47,920
They were the musicians.

1181
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:49,200
They're already in a band.

1182
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:49,640
Yes.

1183
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:50,480
They were analysts.

1184
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:52,600
A core group in the show.

1185
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:55,920
I'm guessing that was the decision making process behind that.

1186
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:57,160
Did you guys catch...

1187
00:50:57,160 --> 00:51:02,400
Because I went as far as picking up the DVD so I can watch the movie with the commentary.

1188
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:03,400
Oh, yeah.

1189
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:04,800
Oh, great.

1190
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:05,640
That's great.

1191
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:07,080
I scored it.

1192
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:12,640
If you guys want to score one for yourselves, I bid on it on eBay and won the final...

1193
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:18,280
I was the sole bidder and the final price was $3.24.

1194
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:21,040
I was going to guess around $3.

1195
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:22,080
Oh, damn.

1196
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:23,560
We should have turned this into a game.

1197
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:23,760
Oh, yeah.

1198
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:24,480
That's all right.

1199
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:24,680
Sorry.

1200
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:25,720
Oh, that's all right.

1201
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:29,800
Well, the DVD commentary...

1202
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:35,240
I did not get what I wanted out of the DVD commentary because it was the director doing

1203
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:41,240
it with Ted and Zed, Deidre Bader and Steven Root, which is kind of funny because those

1204
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:42,480
are really funny guys.

1205
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:46,440
And they had just come a couple of years earlier from being in office space together.

1206
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:53,200
But as far as me trying to learn concrete facts about the production of the movie, that's

1207
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:54,240
not where I got it from.

1208
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:57,680
I found that other places, but not in the DVD commentary.

1209
00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:02,240
But one little piece of information that I was able to pick up from that, because it's

1210
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:03,240
hard to weed...

1211
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:09,720
They're just cracking jokes and improvising and making stuff up.

1212
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:16,720
But the director did say that the country bear's torbess is named Zeke.

1213
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:24,000
And it's a tribute to the one character from The Five Bear Rugs that we don't see because

1214
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,760
he passed away.

1215
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:26,920
What?

1216
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:28,920
Zeke is dead?

1217
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:30,480
Zeke's dead, baby.

1218
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:32,200
Why?

1219
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:33,600
Why does he need to be dead?

1220
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:35,200
That's as far as they go.

1221
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:36,200
It's the first movie.

1222
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:37,200
We don't know why.

1223
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:39,400
We're going to make this a movie.

1224
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:42,040
We got to get on the same page about one thing.

1225
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:43,040
Zeke's dead, right?

1226
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:44,040
Zeke is dead.

1227
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:45,040
But you can't make it with him alive.

1228
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:46,040
He's been cut.

1229
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:47,040
My guess?

1230
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:48,040
Heroin overdose.

1231
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:49,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1232
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:50,040
Bear-oin overdose.

1233
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:51,040
Bear-oin.

1234
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:52,040
Oh, oh.

1235
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:55,040
Thank you, Scott.

1236
00:52:55,040 --> 00:53:04,840
Just like Zeb Zeber is like, he has a drinking problem, but not an alcohol drinking problem,

1237
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:05,840
a honey drinking problem.

1238
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:07,320
It's a honey drinking problem.

1239
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:13,880
He owes Cha Cha, the bartender, $500 in back payment of his death.

1240
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:14,880
Yes.

1241
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:18,880
This is the newspaper headline at the beginning, Zuber's sticky honey problem.

1242
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:21,880
And that's one of those things.

1243
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:24,880
How can you not like Zuber's sticky honey problem?

1244
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:29,880
There's so many jokes like that in this movie, and I just pun intended eat it up.

1245
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:32,600
Let's say some of these things that we...

1246
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:33,600
Okay, sure.

1247
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:36,120
Because it seems like you agree with this, Jay.

1248
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:42,320
There's just things in it that are like, okay, that car wash sequence is really bonkers.

1249
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:44,880
There's a really great line.

1250
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:49,100
It's not this exactly, but Dietrich Bader says, can I put the window down?

1251
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:52,120
And the other officer says, yeah, put your window down.

1252
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:53,120
It's all right.

1253
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:54,120
Police business.

1254
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:55,120
Like that's the problem.

1255
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:58,120
But they said it's so complicated.

1256
00:53:58,120 --> 00:53:59,760
And then of course they get shot in the face with soap.

1257
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:01,940
And I was like, that's a good gag.

1258
00:54:01,940 --> 00:54:07,660
And then Bader gets yanked out of the car wash violently at cartoon speed.

1259
00:54:07,660 --> 00:54:10,500
And the whole process rips his mustache off as well.

1260
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:13,940
That's a very odd choice.

1261
00:54:13,940 --> 00:54:16,100
I love seeing those two together.

1262
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:17,100
They're funny.

1263
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:22,540
I surprise how many genuine laughs I got of the bad cops.

1264
00:54:22,540 --> 00:54:24,740
Yeah, I think they're super funny.

1265
00:54:24,740 --> 00:54:28,020
I think Bader's always funny and stuff.

1266
00:54:28,060 --> 00:54:36,740
I like when Ted Betterhead is the last one as they're gathering everybody and they've

1267
00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:42,100
heard that he's rich and in a mansion, but then they find him in a big mansion, but he's

1268
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:44,700
just playing with a wedding band.

1269
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:49,340
And he's doing a really cheesy version of It's Not Unusual, which I like in general

1270
00:54:49,340 --> 00:54:50,340
with it.

1271
00:54:50,340 --> 00:54:51,340
It's ba-da-da-da-da-da.

1272
00:54:51,340 --> 00:54:52,340
Yeah.

1273
00:54:52,340 --> 00:54:55,500
And then he gets spotted by one of his friends.

1274
00:54:55,500 --> 00:55:01,220
And then when he's been caught and he realizes that he says the song lyric, I want to die.

1275
00:55:01,220 --> 00:55:02,220
Yeah.

1276
00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:03,220
Yes.

1277
00:55:03,220 --> 00:55:04,220
Yes.

1278
00:55:04,220 --> 00:55:05,220
So earnestly.

1279
00:55:05,220 --> 00:55:06,220
I really like that.

1280
00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:07,220
That's surprising.

1281
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:10,940
What I also like is he gets knocked the fuck out at the end of that scene.

1282
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:11,940
Oh yeah.

1283
00:55:11,940 --> 00:55:15,140
He gets a violent punch to the head and gets knocked out.

1284
00:55:15,140 --> 00:55:18,140
Slapsticky movie.

1285
00:55:18,140 --> 00:55:23,700
Walken's hood ornament on his limo is like a little demolition ball.

1286
00:55:23,740 --> 00:55:24,740
So good.

1287
00:55:24,740 --> 00:55:25,740
So good.

1288
00:55:25,740 --> 00:55:26,740
So good.

1289
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:27,740
So good.

1290
00:55:27,740 --> 00:55:28,740
So good.

1291
00:55:28,740 --> 00:55:29,740
Yeah.

1292
00:55:29,740 --> 00:55:34,460
There's a Walken, I think it's Walken is talking to Big Al outside of the hall and Big Al gets

1293
00:55:34,460 --> 00:55:36,460
him to look away.

1294
00:55:36,460 --> 00:55:41,940
And then the camera cuts back and Big Al is now far away on the porch and he says, I'm

1295
00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:43,900
chubby, but I'm quick.

1296
00:55:43,900 --> 00:55:47,260
Big Al is the funniest guy in the movie.

1297
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:48,540
Everything Big Al does is funny.

1298
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:49,540
Everything he says is funny.

1299
00:55:49,540 --> 00:55:50,540
Yeah.

1300
00:55:50,540 --> 00:55:51,540
Which is an argument for it.

1301
00:55:51,580 --> 00:55:54,060
I think he should have just stayed closer to the characters in general.

1302
00:55:54,060 --> 00:55:55,380
Yes, because he's the closest.

1303
00:55:55,380 --> 00:55:56,380
He looks like the character.

1304
00:55:56,380 --> 00:55:58,380
He talks like the character.

1305
00:55:58,380 --> 00:56:00,380
That people ask him like, what is that?

1306
00:56:00,380 --> 00:56:01,380
A sign.

1307
00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:02,380
A sign.

1308
00:56:02,380 --> 00:56:07,380
It's like, we that long, I don't have the whole thing where he's like, we can do that.

1309
00:56:07,380 --> 00:56:08,380
We can do that.

1310
00:56:08,380 --> 00:56:09,380
Like that's funny.

1311
00:56:09,380 --> 00:56:10,380
He's funny.

1312
00:56:10,380 --> 00:56:12,340
Let me ask you guys.

1313
00:56:12,340 --> 00:56:17,700
I'm not sure if this is intended or not, but you know, the roadie character who's also

1314
00:56:17,820 --> 00:56:24,500
the drummer of the band and has the pet chicken seems to me like he might have been based

1315
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:27,460
off Joe roadie because he looks so much like him.

1316
00:56:27,460 --> 00:56:28,860
Did you guys pick up on that?

1317
00:56:28,860 --> 00:56:29,860
Interesting.

1318
00:56:29,860 --> 00:56:30,860
Interesting.

1319
00:56:30,860 --> 00:56:31,860
I don't know.

1320
00:56:31,860 --> 00:56:34,900
I didn't think of it, but that guy's the roadie as a roadie.

1321
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:35,900
Right.

1322
00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:36,900
Oh, wow.

1323
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:37,900
And his name's roadie.

1324
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:40,060
That's the name of the character.

1325
00:56:40,060 --> 00:56:41,860
Roadie doesn't have an actual name.

1326
00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:43,620
So maybe that's not, I don't know.

1327
00:56:43,620 --> 00:56:45,220
I just want to throw that out there.

1328
00:56:45,220 --> 00:56:48,580
He's a naked guy at the end of sideways is who that is.

1329
00:56:48,580 --> 00:56:52,060
So we've all seen, if you've seen sideways, you've seen his penis.

1330
00:56:52,060 --> 00:56:55,660
You've seen it sideways.

1331
00:56:55,660 --> 00:57:00,020
There's a little bit of a physical comedy at the breakfast table that I thought was

1332
00:57:00,020 --> 00:57:01,740
pretty funny.

1333
00:57:01,740 --> 00:57:07,300
The brother, I, I, the brother seemed like they were doing like a Reese from Malcolm

1334
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:08,300
in the middle.

1335
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:09,300
Is it Reese?

1336
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:10,300
Yeah.

1337
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:14,980
And I kind of liked, he was the only one who's going like, what do you, what, what

1338
00:57:14,980 --> 00:57:15,980
is everyone doing?

1339
00:57:15,980 --> 00:57:16,980
He's with the bear.

1340
00:57:16,980 --> 00:57:19,620
Like he was the voice of reason just being ignored.

1341
00:57:19,620 --> 00:57:23,580
There's a really funny moment where Stephen Tobolowski tries to hit him with a newspaper

1342
00:57:23,580 --> 00:57:25,580
and he really quickly blocks him.

1343
00:57:25,580 --> 00:57:27,140
Like he knows it's coming.

1344
00:57:27,140 --> 00:57:30,100
And that was just a nice piece of physical comedy business.

1345
00:57:30,100 --> 00:57:34,740
I like when Barry runs away and then I think he has the, I think the brother Dix has the

1346
00:57:34,740 --> 00:57:40,580
note and it's like, I'm run away from home to find the bears, but it's, and it's all

1347
00:57:40,580 --> 00:57:41,580
clawed up.

1348
00:57:41,580 --> 00:57:42,580
Yeah.

1349
00:57:42,580 --> 00:57:44,060
The claw rips through it.

1350
00:57:44,060 --> 00:57:46,220
The whole, the family is fun.

1351
00:57:46,220 --> 00:57:51,140
The whole bit, the dumb bit, like they just want to tell him there is he's adopted, which

1352
00:57:51,140 --> 00:57:53,820
like they never really explained, but it's like, it's, I don't know.

1353
00:57:53,820 --> 00:57:59,500
It feels, the whole thing just feels like a fun, under explained cartoon thing.

1354
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:00,980
We'd watch as a kid.

1355
00:58:00,980 --> 00:58:01,980
Yeah.

1356
00:58:01,980 --> 00:58:06,780
We're like, there's not that much explanation about like the universe and the logic of all

1357
00:58:06,780 --> 00:58:07,780
of it.

1358
00:58:07,780 --> 00:58:08,780
It's just like, isn't that funny?

1359
00:58:08,780 --> 00:58:12,340
They're trying to pretend this kid isn't a bear.

1360
00:58:12,340 --> 00:58:16,620
The adoption for this is your baby photo and he's a regular baby.

1361
00:58:16,620 --> 00:58:21,100
This is your baby photo and he's being hung upside down by a park ranger.

1362
00:58:21,100 --> 00:58:22,100
Yeah.

1363
00:58:22,100 --> 00:58:23,100
I don't know.

1364
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:24,940
It's also where I started falling in love.

1365
00:58:24,940 --> 00:58:29,420
Like I think I'm not, I think I'm going to not be mad at this movie and I continue to

1366
00:58:29,420 --> 00:58:30,420
not be.

1367
00:58:30,420 --> 00:58:31,420
Yeah.

1368
00:58:31,420 --> 00:58:32,420
I do appreciate that.

1369
00:58:32,420 --> 00:58:34,860
They just set up like in this world, there's bears and the bears are like people don't

1370
00:58:34,860 --> 00:58:35,860
worry about it.

1371
00:58:35,860 --> 00:58:41,820
It's like, you know, it's not the overly labored explanations in movies now where it's like,

1372
00:58:41,820 --> 00:58:42,820
this is a proton.

1373
00:58:42,820 --> 00:58:44,740
Well, it's a proton pack.

1374
00:58:44,740 --> 00:58:45,740
Right.

1375
00:58:45,740 --> 00:58:47,980
Split into a different tangent.

1376
00:58:47,980 --> 00:58:49,420
It's an alternate universe.

1377
00:58:49,420 --> 00:58:55,020
Thus allowing, you know, who did not just accept it and was, was, didn't just relax

1378
00:58:55,020 --> 00:58:57,100
about it was Roger Ebert.

1379
00:58:57,100 --> 00:58:58,900
Here we go.

1380
00:58:58,900 --> 00:59:02,180
Shares some opinions, I think with you, Jason.

1381
00:59:02,180 --> 00:59:03,220
There's a little passage.

1382
00:59:03,220 --> 00:59:07,500
The formidable technical skills in the country bears must not be allowed to distract from

1383
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:12,380
the film's terminal inanity.

1384
00:59:12,380 --> 00:59:14,740
Why are they all, why are they bears?

1385
00:59:14,740 --> 00:59:15,960
I do not know.

1386
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:17,440
Do they know they are bears?

1387
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:18,640
Not necessarily.

1388
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:21,860
Do any of the humans mention they are bears only in passing?

1389
00:59:21,860 --> 00:59:26,060
Are there real bears in the woods who would maul and eat their victims or are all bears

1390
00:59:26,060 --> 00:59:28,540
benign in this world?

1391
00:59:28,540 --> 00:59:32,980
And then coming to the end, very similar to what you said, Jason, it's done well.

1392
00:59:32,980 --> 00:59:33,980
Yes.

1393
00:59:33,980 --> 00:59:34,980
But why?

1394
00:59:35,660 --> 00:59:36,660
Yeah.

1395
00:59:38,660 --> 00:59:43,940
I do have a, because you guys had the music facts ready to go and I was always, of course,

1396
00:59:43,940 --> 00:59:51,820
more of a movie kid and I was very excited to realize that the character Rip Holland,

1397
00:59:51,820 --> 00:59:58,460
the unscrupulous music promoter played by the actor Alex Rocco, who was Mo Green in

1398
00:59:58,460 --> 00:59:59,460
The Godfather.

1399
00:59:59,460 --> 01:00:01,780
And George Myers Jr.

1400
01:00:01,780 --> 01:00:02,780
Roger Myers.

1401
01:00:02,780 --> 01:00:03,780
Roger Myers Jr.

1402
01:00:03,780 --> 01:00:04,780
Roger Myers Jr.

1403
01:00:04,780 --> 01:00:06,380
Yeah, that's a writer.

1404
01:00:06,380 --> 01:00:09,780
And he's also like a sleazy record executive in That Thing You Do.

1405
01:00:09,780 --> 01:00:10,780
Yes.

1406
01:00:10,780 --> 01:00:13,780
He's always these like industry grossoes.

1407
01:00:13,780 --> 01:00:14,780
Yeah.

1408
01:00:14,780 --> 01:00:20,580
Scott, you told us already what cameos in this movie you despised, but there's so, so

1409
01:00:20,580 --> 01:00:21,580
many others.

1410
01:00:21,580 --> 01:00:22,580
Yes.

1411
01:00:22,580 --> 01:00:26,180
Which ones did you enjoy?

1412
01:00:26,180 --> 01:00:29,740
Well let's talk Elton John for a second.

1413
01:00:29,740 --> 01:00:35,740
I don't think I realized that this movie had Elton John acting, walking all slow and dopey

1414
01:00:35,740 --> 01:00:37,740
and overalls.

1415
01:00:37,740 --> 01:00:43,780
He just like, he's one of the, you know, I feel like, think about like his peers, Mick

1416
01:00:43,780 --> 01:00:47,940
Jagger, David Bowie, just kind of like, I mean Mick Jagger's not a great actor, I guess,

1417
01:00:47,940 --> 01:00:50,860
but he's interesting if he's in a movie.

1418
01:00:50,860 --> 01:00:55,980
You could like, they're just like such performers that like, you put a camera on them, it'll

1419
01:00:55,980 --> 01:00:56,980
be interesting.

1420
01:00:56,980 --> 01:00:57,980
Elton John is like your dad.

1421
01:00:58,220 --> 01:01:00,580
He's like, he's a horrible actor.

1422
01:01:00,580 --> 01:01:04,060
I don't, I'm charmed by his bad acting.

1423
01:01:04,060 --> 01:01:08,620
I remember him on SNL was like, oh my God, they haven't had such a bad host in a while.

1424
01:01:08,620 --> 01:01:11,260
He's like an athlete.

1425
01:01:11,260 --> 01:01:14,580
He's kind of funny as himself in the Kingsman movies.

1426
01:01:14,580 --> 01:01:17,740
Oh, I haven't seen him.

1427
01:01:17,740 --> 01:01:21,900
It's interesting with certain rock stars, and I think there's like a distinction like,

1428
01:01:21,900 --> 01:01:24,340
and I mean, tell me if you agree with this or not.

1429
01:01:24,700 --> 01:01:27,980
Like obviously like David Bowie is like the coolest man.

1430
01:01:27,980 --> 01:01:31,820
You can feel like you could, you don't, maybe you can describe what cool was, but you could

1431
01:01:31,820 --> 01:01:34,300
like point and go, oh, that's David Bowie.

1432
01:01:34,300 --> 01:01:39,980
Mick Jagger in a similar way, like Bono, if you ever like hear him like speak out of the,

1433
01:01:39,980 --> 01:01:44,180
especially out of the context of like on stage, you go, this guy's a huge dork.

1434
01:01:44,180 --> 01:01:48,780
And like similarly with Elton John, I feel like if you see him actor, you've interviewed,

1435
01:01:48,780 --> 01:01:53,100
and again, I'm a huge Elton John fan, but like you go, oh, this guy's kind of a dork.

1436
01:01:53,100 --> 01:01:54,100
Like this guy's a dork.

1437
01:01:54,100 --> 01:01:57,220
He's not like inherently cool like some of these other rock stars.

1438
01:01:57,220 --> 01:02:00,700
Like there's, it's interesting to see sometimes, especially like if you were, if everything

1439
01:02:00,700 --> 01:02:05,220
was equal and they were all being put in a country beer movie from 2002, you would really

1440
01:02:05,220 --> 01:02:08,340
be able to see like exactly where everyone started out.

1441
01:02:08,340 --> 01:02:13,300
Like were you sort of just cool at 13 or were you cool because you wrote amazing songs and

1442
01:02:13,300 --> 01:02:15,300
were a dynamic performer?

1443
01:02:15,300 --> 01:02:18,940
Well, that also really felt like we have Elton for one hour.

1444
01:02:18,940 --> 01:02:19,940
Yeah, sure.

1445
01:02:19,940 --> 01:02:20,940
Big time.

1446
01:02:20,940 --> 01:02:21,940
Yeah.

1447
01:02:22,060 --> 01:02:26,220
The joke with him living in like above Elton's like garage is funny too.

1448
01:02:26,220 --> 01:02:27,740
They like reveal later.

1449
01:02:27,740 --> 01:02:28,740
Yeah, that was Elton John.

1450
01:02:28,740 --> 01:02:29,740
So funny.

1451
01:02:29,740 --> 01:02:30,740
Cause they're like, they don't know who it was.

1452
01:02:30,740 --> 01:02:31,740
They don't think it was.

1453
01:02:31,740 --> 01:02:32,740
Weird hat on.

1454
01:02:32,740 --> 01:02:35,740
Cause I was about to be like, is that Elton John?

1455
01:02:35,740 --> 01:02:37,460
Just like the bears.

1456
01:02:37,460 --> 01:02:39,220
It's a weird charming, I don't know.

1457
01:02:39,220 --> 01:02:43,020
It's making fun of it, but it's, it's fun and funny.

1458
01:02:43,020 --> 01:02:44,020
Who else you got?

1459
01:02:44,020 --> 01:02:45,020
Well, they jam a lot of people.

1460
01:02:45,020 --> 01:02:48,080
You could tell that it was supposed to be in the movie, but then they kind of like shove

1461
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:49,080
it into the credits.

1462
01:02:49,080 --> 01:02:50,080
Yeah.

1463
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:54,640
Like the parade of musicians doing the beat of, well, they were a big influence on me

1464
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:59,680
and they were the reason I picked up a guitar and it really dates it in a fun way.

1465
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:00,680
Yeah.

1466
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:01,680
You got your...

1467
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:02,680
Exhibit.

1468
01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:03,680
I love exhibit.

1469
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:04,680
That's one of my biggest laugh out louds.

1470
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:06,680
He was sued by the country bear.

1471
01:03:06,680 --> 01:03:11,320
They sampled that exhibit, sampled one of the bass lines in a country bear song and

1472
01:03:11,320 --> 01:03:12,320
then they sued him.

1473
01:03:12,320 --> 01:03:13,320
So funny.

1474
01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:14,320
It's so funny.

1475
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:15,320
Yeah.

1476
01:03:15,320 --> 01:03:18,200
And like sometimes, yeah, sometimes that gimmick kind of is like cringy cause you've seen it

1477
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:21,800
so many times, but there's like a handful of them in there that are funny.

1478
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:25,800
I think maybe my favorite line in the movie is from Wyclef.

1479
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:26,800
Oh yeah.

1480
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:27,800
Yeah.

1481
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:28,800
Bears are human beings.

1482
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:29,800
Yes.

1483
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:30,800
Yes.

1484
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:36,720
But it's also, he sells it to such a degree that I'm like, did he just say this or was

1485
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:37,720
it written?

1486
01:03:37,720 --> 01:03:38,720
Yeah.

1487
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:39,720
It's a good question.

1488
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:44,840
He's so funny in it, but yeah, it's, it's possible he was just stream of conscious.

1489
01:03:44,840 --> 01:03:47,920
Willie Nelson says when he split, they split a can of honey on the white house.

1490
01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:49,320
The roof of the white house.

1491
01:03:49,320 --> 01:03:50,320
That's good.

1492
01:03:50,320 --> 01:03:51,320
It's funny.

1493
01:03:51,320 --> 01:03:52,320
Don was guy.

1494
01:03:52,320 --> 01:03:53,320
Don was love kid.

1495
01:03:53,320 --> 01:03:59,720
The kids are gonna flip when they see that Don not the, not the first time that names

1496
01:03:59,720 --> 01:04:00,720
come up on this show.

1497
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:03,040
It probably should be the last.

1498
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:07,840
I've seen, believe me, I was, I was at a Wilco concert and I was in the lobby and I go, oh,

1499
01:04:07,840 --> 01:04:08,840
it's Don was.

1500
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:10,840
He produced the best bear naked.

1501
01:04:10,840 --> 01:04:11,840
He produced it.

1502
01:04:11,840 --> 01:04:13,320
We should not care about Don.

1503
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:17,120
He produced the best bear naked ladies album, Maroon.

1504
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:18,120
I'm so excited.

1505
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:23,800
There's a lot of, if you dig deep, like I did, you'll find that there's a lot of non-celebrity

1506
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:25,440
cameos in this film.

1507
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:30,200
A lot of the puppeteers are in it like as extras, like in the restaurant scene, but

1508
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:36,880
my favorite and I, I knew like there's this at the final concert scene, they cut to the

1509
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:42,920
audience and you just see a dude, like an older dude with long hair, like a rock and,

1510
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:43,920
and then that's it.

1511
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:48,880
Why did they, if this guy's just an extra, why did they hang on him for so long?

1512
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:53,880
And that was the voice of Brer Rabbit, like had nothing to do with the filming, but I

1513
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:59,640
guess he showed up to the final concert sequence and they put the camera on him.

1514
01:04:59,640 --> 01:05:00,640
What's the guy's name?

1515
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:02,640
Do you have it or?

1516
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:03,640
Yeah.

1517
01:05:03,640 --> 01:05:06,280
Wait, Brer Rabbit in the ride or in the movie?

1518
01:05:06,280 --> 01:05:07,840
The splash mountain ride.

1519
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:08,840
Sorry.

1520
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:09,840
I should have.

1521
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:11,840
Cause the actor, most of the actors were long dead.

1522
01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:12,840
Of course.

1523
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:15,880
The guy who did Wacko's voice, it's in it.

1524
01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:16,880
Jess Harnell.

1525
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:17,880
That's Harnell.

1526
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:18,880
He's Brer, what?

1527
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:21,640
I didn't know he was Brer Rabbit.

1528
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:25,720
Cause I knew, cause I saw also Jess Harnell who did Wacko on Animaniacs.

1529
01:05:25,720 --> 01:05:27,040
That's the credit I always remember.

1530
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:28,040
Yeah.

1531
01:05:28,040 --> 01:05:29,040
Yeah.

1532
01:05:29,040 --> 01:05:30,040
Who has still has that look, I think.

1533
01:05:30,040 --> 01:05:31,040
Yes.

1534
01:05:31,040 --> 01:05:36,360
And he's at the end, he's just sitting next to the kid and he's like, that's my brother.

1535
01:05:36,360 --> 01:05:37,840
And he's like, whoa.

1536
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:38,840
Yeah.

1537
01:05:38,840 --> 01:05:39,840
Yeah.

1538
01:05:39,840 --> 01:05:46,640
That's a good cameo, but let's, I think discuss a little bit, Christopher Walken's performance

1539
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:49,240
as what's the character's name?

1540
01:05:49,240 --> 01:05:50,240
Does anybody have it?

1541
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:51,240
Oh yeah.

1542
01:05:51,240 --> 01:05:52,240
Let me, don't you have it?

1543
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:53,240
Read, read, read, read Thimple.

1544
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:56,200
And just revealed later his real name.

1545
01:05:56,200 --> 01:05:57,200
Oh yes.

1546
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:58,200
Yeah.

1547
01:05:58,200 --> 01:05:59,200
Yeah.

1548
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:01,400
Wait, I don't have that one in front of me either, but yeah, he's a, there's a whole,

1549
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:04,280
there's a whole dense backstory woven.

1550
01:06:04,280 --> 01:06:09,000
I feel like most of the people that's do this podcast right now are going to go, had never

1551
01:06:09,080 --> 01:06:12,680
watched the movie before, but after this is over, they're going to watch it for the first

1552
01:06:12,680 --> 01:06:13,680
time.

1553
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:18,960
So maybe we should leave a little bit, a little, so we can give a spoiler alert.

1554
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:22,600
Not spoil the huge reveal that happens at the very end of the movie.

1555
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:23,600
Oh yes.

1556
01:06:23,600 --> 01:06:25,400
Which I think is very funny and very clever.

1557
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:26,400
I agree.

1558
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:27,400
I think it's funny to hear.

1559
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:28,400
Big shocker.

1560
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:29,480
The like, okay.

1561
01:06:29,480 --> 01:06:36,720
So I'm of two, like, you know, sometimes Walken I qualify as a person who like is, he's really

1562
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:42,000
funny on Saturday Night Live where it's like, you know, professionals who know how to use

1563
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:43,000
him.

1564
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:44,000
Right.

1565
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,840
So then other, then they'll put them in other things.

1566
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:51,400
Maybe he's a little too scenery chewy or a little too aware and that kind of like, it's

1567
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:52,920
not playing it straight enough.

1568
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:57,280
And I do admittedly put some of this performance into that box.

1569
01:06:57,280 --> 01:07:04,760
However, my very favorite thing in the movie is the sequence of him repeatedly crushing

1570
01:07:04,760 --> 01:07:05,760
country bear hall.

1571
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:07,240
Yes.

1572
01:07:07,240 --> 01:07:13,000
He has an ornate model of country bear hall, which he is trying to demolish and he drops

1573
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:22,120
like a big cartoon two ton weight down on it and then does a very performative, oh no,

1574
01:07:22,120 --> 01:07:25,120
country bear hall has been destroyed.

1575
01:07:25,120 --> 01:07:30,560
And then he just throws it onto a pile of a bunch of clearly he's been doing this for

1576
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:35,840
a while and then just pulls out a pristine one and he keeps doing it like this is just

1577
01:07:35,840 --> 01:07:37,040
his whole day.

1578
01:07:37,040 --> 01:07:40,640
Obviously, that is I think that's a great cartoon.

1579
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:41,640
Yes.

1580
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:42,880
Somehow he's taken the time.

1581
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:44,200
He's so vindictive.

1582
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:47,120
He has 20 perfect models of this.

1583
01:07:47,120 --> 01:07:48,120
Yes.

1584
01:07:48,120 --> 01:07:49,120
All.

1585
01:07:49,120 --> 01:07:50,120
Yes.

1586
01:07:50,120 --> 01:07:51,120
Great.

1587
01:07:51,120 --> 01:07:52,120
Yeah.

1588
01:07:52,120 --> 01:07:53,120
It's really funny.

1589
01:07:53,120 --> 01:07:56,600
That's what like, you know, can one thing be funny enough or good enough to save the

1590
01:07:56,600 --> 01:07:57,600
whole movie?

1591
01:07:57,600 --> 01:07:58,600
Not necessarily.

1592
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:02,280
But like how many things, like you said, Jason, have we watched for this podcast where like

1593
01:08:02,280 --> 01:08:08,040
there wasn't one of those where like, let me do a little compare contrast because we

1594
01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:11,160
also watched in terms of theme park movies, Haunted Mansion, the movie.

1595
01:08:11,160 --> 01:08:15,480
I think that I would I would watch the country bears in an instant over a hundred percent

1596
01:08:15,480 --> 01:08:16,480
on a mansion movie.

1597
01:08:16,480 --> 01:08:17,480
Hundred percent.

1598
01:08:17,480 --> 01:08:19,200
Jason, are you asking?

1599
01:08:19,200 --> 01:08:22,000
I was thinking about that before you brought it up.

1600
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:23,000
OK.

1601
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:24,000
And I think.

1602
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:27,240
Yeah, I don't.

1603
01:08:27,240 --> 01:08:28,440
I don't know.

1604
01:08:29,280 --> 01:08:33,360
I think I went in as kind of a blank slate on this one.

1605
01:08:33,360 --> 01:08:37,560
And I knew that one was a little more also was reviled.

1606
01:08:37,560 --> 01:08:38,560
Mm hmm.

1607
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:39,560
But that one.

1608
01:08:39,560 --> 01:08:40,560
But that one's so unmemorable.

1609
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:43,240
Like it's nothing like in that.

1610
01:08:43,240 --> 01:08:44,320
That movie's dog shit.

1611
01:08:44,320 --> 01:08:45,320
I like Stephen.

1612
01:08:45,320 --> 01:08:49,240
No, not Stephen Tobolowski's in this one.

1613
01:08:49,240 --> 01:08:50,680
What's his face from Princess Bride?

1614
01:08:50,680 --> 01:08:52,000
I don't think anyone here knows it.

1615
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,960
I don't think anyone here knows or cares about the guy you're talking about.

1616
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:55,960
It's a story.

1617
01:08:56,520 --> 01:08:59,360
Are you talking about the guy who directed the guy?

1618
01:08:59,360 --> 01:09:01,360
Are you talking about Andre Gregory?

1619
01:09:01,360 --> 01:09:02,360
No.

1620
01:09:02,360 --> 01:09:03,360
You're talking about the guy.

1621
01:09:03,360 --> 01:09:04,360
Oh, Wallace Shawn.

1622
01:09:04,360 --> 01:09:05,360
Oh, sorry.

1623
01:09:05,360 --> 01:09:06,360
Wallace Shawn.

1624
01:09:06,360 --> 01:09:08,760
Wallace Shawn and Eddie Murphy.

1625
01:09:08,760 --> 01:09:10,320
I love Wallace Shawn.

1626
01:09:10,320 --> 01:09:13,520
But no, they're crazy.

1627
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:14,520
As just as.

1628
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:15,520
Of course.

1629
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:19,480
Wallace Shawn's then not like there's nothing you could see in that movie that he does that

1630
01:09:19,480 --> 01:09:21,360
isn't better in another movie.

1631
01:09:21,360 --> 01:09:22,360
You know what I mean?

1632
01:09:22,360 --> 01:09:24,880
Jennifer Tilly is funny in that movie.

1633
01:09:25,360 --> 01:09:26,360
Yeah, I don't know.

1634
01:09:26,360 --> 01:09:27,360
You're just naming names.

1635
01:09:27,360 --> 01:09:28,840
There's no one part of it.

1636
01:09:28,840 --> 01:09:31,160
There's performers.

1637
01:09:31,160 --> 01:09:33,000
Of course, they're all good, but they're good in other shit.

1638
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:34,320
So you watch the other shit.

1639
01:09:34,320 --> 01:09:35,200
Yes.

1640
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:38,480
And I wish I had watched other shit instead of this movie.

1641
01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:41,040
So I don't know.

1642
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:44,120
I would prefer not to watch either of them again.

1643
01:09:44,120 --> 01:09:50,520
Oh, I know what the song, the Nelly song, that's the almost people's court as a driver.

1644
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:52,240
That does not count.

1645
01:09:52,240 --> 01:09:53,240
That is great.

1646
01:09:53,240 --> 01:09:55,000
That's not funny on purpose.

1647
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:56,760
Like the funny things.

1648
01:09:56,760 --> 01:09:57,760
I agree.

1649
01:09:57,760 --> 01:09:58,760
I love that.

1650
01:09:58,760 --> 01:10:01,160
But that's not like a Nelly song is great.

1651
01:10:01,160 --> 01:10:02,160
But that's not really in the.

1652
01:10:02,160 --> 01:10:04,480
The punch up people they got on that movie did a bad job.

1653
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:07,800
The country bears punch up people added funny stuff throughout.

1654
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:11,360
I don't think the punch up in this is just pretty disconnected.

1655
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:12,360
It doesn't.

1656
01:10:12,360 --> 01:10:13,360
What do you mean disconnected though?

1657
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:14,360
It doesn't add.

1658
01:10:14,360 --> 01:10:16,360
It doesn't make a whole piece of a movie.

1659
01:10:16,360 --> 01:10:20,440
You just named a bunch of things you liked and you couldn't name one in the Haunted Mansion.

1660
01:10:20,440 --> 01:10:21,440
There's not one line.

1661
01:10:21,640 --> 01:10:24,680
I think it holds up better as a movie.

1662
01:10:24,680 --> 01:10:27,680
I think it makes more sense as a movie.

1663
01:10:27,680 --> 01:10:28,680
And I don't.

1664
01:10:28,680 --> 01:10:34,000
I just think that it's such a weird mapping choice to make it like, oh, we have to get

1665
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:37,500
the band back together after last waltz.

1666
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:39,920
But it's the country bears for some reason.

1667
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:40,920
But then you like the Muppets.

1668
01:10:40,920 --> 01:10:41,920
I do like the Muppets.

1669
01:10:41,920 --> 01:10:45,000
But that's the same thing.

1670
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:48,480
Because it's a better performers, the Muppet performers.

1671
01:10:48,520 --> 01:10:51,520
So you forgive the shitty story.

1672
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:54,680
If you say it's shitty in this, it means it's shitty in this.

1673
01:10:54,680 --> 01:10:56,960
It's not a shitty story if done correctly.

1674
01:10:56,960 --> 01:11:04,520
I don't think it's, I think it's an odd, it's just so odd to pair it with the country bears.

1675
01:11:04,520 --> 01:11:10,280
Where like you could have just, like you could have just been like family moves to the country.

1676
01:11:10,280 --> 01:11:16,680
Boy discovers these bears that put on like a honky tonk like Joe and the holler.

1677
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:19,080
That just feels much simpler to me.

1678
01:11:19,080 --> 01:11:20,520
But then what's the rest of it?

1679
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:21,520
I think you have to.

1680
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:22,520
Let's beat this.

1681
01:11:22,520 --> 01:11:26,320
Okay, we'll each beat the version we'd like to see out as far as a movie.

1682
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:28,440
We're going to be multiple parts, though.

1683
01:11:28,440 --> 01:11:29,440
That's okay.

1684
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:30,440
That's going to take a long time.

1685
01:11:30,440 --> 01:11:33,440
Is it?

1686
01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:34,480
Because I'll start.

1687
01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:36,440
We open on a field.

1688
01:11:36,440 --> 01:11:38,440
No, I'm just kidding.

1689
01:11:38,440 --> 01:11:39,440
Okay.

1690
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:40,440
I thought you were going to say no.

1691
01:11:40,440 --> 01:11:43,400
Here's my other, there's another argument I have.

1692
01:11:44,120 --> 01:11:49,640
Okay, I think that the original sin here is anyone at Disney saying, let's make a country

1693
01:11:49,640 --> 01:11:51,480
bears movie in 2002.

1694
01:11:51,480 --> 01:11:55,560
I think that anything that that was going to be in that year was going to be not good

1695
01:11:55,560 --> 01:11:57,480
and was probably going to bomb.

1696
01:11:57,480 --> 01:12:00,720
Because of course, there's another world where like, what's the movie we'd want to see?

1697
01:12:00,720 --> 01:12:03,320
It's probably like a really well done.

1698
01:12:03,320 --> 01:12:08,320
Imagine like a nightmare before Christmas level, like perfectly rendered the characters

1699
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:10,400
and the shapes and the way that they move.

1700
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:15,520
And then you're really in the world of the show that we know.

1701
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:17,440
But I think that movie bombs too.

1702
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:22,000
I don't think that there is a country bears movie in 2002 that doesn't eat shit.

1703
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:23,000
No, I don't.

1704
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:26,880
Yeah, they were trying to do something that would like have some sort of appeal to a modern

1705
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:27,880
audience.

1706
01:12:27,880 --> 01:12:32,840
And as we can see with the fact that like the show is always on the chopping block,

1707
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:41,040
far as we know, that country bears, southern country music playing bears that like are

1708
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:47,880
like funny and hoot and holler, maybe the general audience in America isn't so interested

1709
01:12:47,880 --> 01:12:48,880
in that.

1710
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:49,880
There might be limited interest in this.

1711
01:12:49,880 --> 01:12:52,880
Which is crazy to me.

1712
01:12:52,880 --> 01:13:01,600
I think, I mean, it came out three weeks after they wrapped production 9-11 happened.

1713
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:07,800
So like, it comes out, you know, like maybe the movie comes out maybe 10 months later

1714
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:13,120
and like people aren't in the mood to go see a movie.

1715
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:16,760
Movie entertainment kind of really took a hit that whole year.

1716
01:13:16,760 --> 01:13:22,760
Although, although it did open against Austin Powers three, which did great, obviously,

1717
01:13:22,760 --> 01:13:26,760
which I just watched for the first time and I hate it.

1718
01:13:26,760 --> 01:13:30,200
I've never watched the entire thing, honestly.

1719
01:13:30,200 --> 01:13:31,840
I love one and two.

1720
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:35,680
And three always struck me like, I don't think I'm going to like all of this.

1721
01:13:35,680 --> 01:13:38,360
Something was weird about three because I didn't even see it in the theater and I loved

1722
01:13:38,360 --> 01:13:39,360
first and second.

1723
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:42,480
How do you go from like being obsessed with Austin Powers to not even bothering to go

1724
01:13:42,480 --> 01:13:43,480
to the movie?

1725
01:13:43,480 --> 01:13:46,240
I was obsessed with it and then I didn't go and then I got on VHS and watched it and it

1726
01:13:46,240 --> 01:13:47,600
was a little disappointing.

1727
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:52,200
That being said, once a month, do I force Lindsay to watch the first scene of it?

1728
01:13:52,200 --> 01:13:53,200
Yes, I do.

1729
01:13:53,200 --> 01:13:56,200
I mean, that big Austin Powers movie is really something.

1730
01:13:56,200 --> 01:13:57,200
Austin Pussy.

1731
01:13:57,200 --> 01:13:58,200
Yeah.

1732
01:13:58,200 --> 01:13:59,680
Yes, I forget his name.

1733
01:13:59,680 --> 01:14:01,760
The guy who plays Dr. Evil is awesome.

1734
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:02,760
I can't remember.

1735
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:03,760
You know, these character actors.

1736
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:06,000
Yeah, they all want to follow through the crap.

1737
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:07,000
Yeah.

1738
01:14:08,040 --> 01:14:16,680
But I think we also have to point out how crazy the timing is, is that, you know, the

1739
01:14:16,680 --> 01:14:24,040
Country Bear Jamboree still existed at Disneyland in Critter Country when this movie was made

1740
01:14:24,200 --> 01:14:32,040
Two weeks after a wrap production, it closes permanently and that timing is just crazy.

1741
01:14:32,040 --> 01:14:36,920
It's like, here's this movie that's going to promote the ride or the ride is going to

1742
01:14:36,920 --> 01:14:41,240
promote the movie and just completely like it's cursed.

1743
01:14:41,240 --> 01:14:42,240
It's so funny.

1744
01:14:42,240 --> 01:14:43,240
It's so funny.

1745
01:14:43,240 --> 01:14:44,240
Yeah.

1746
01:14:44,240 --> 01:14:46,000
It seems like, because we talked a little bit about it, but it seems like just like

1747
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:50,040
such stuff is not synergenistic back then like it is now.

1748
01:14:50,040 --> 01:14:53,640
No, it would have at least given it another year or two to let them move.

1749
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:56,280
If the movie bonds, yeah, close the ride.

1750
01:14:56,280 --> 01:14:57,280
Right.

1751
01:14:57,280 --> 01:14:59,480
I'd like to think though that they kind of like looking at the dailies and they were

1752
01:14:59,480 --> 01:15:01,480
like, shut it down now.

1753
01:15:01,480 --> 01:15:02,680
This movie ain't saving it.

1754
01:15:02,680 --> 01:15:03,680
Oh, that's why?

1755
01:15:03,680 --> 01:15:04,680
That's what I'd like to think.

1756
01:15:04,680 --> 01:15:07,120
They were like, they were like, no one's going to watch this.

1757
01:15:07,120 --> 01:15:08,120
No one's going to watch this.

1758
01:15:08,120 --> 01:15:09,120
Insane.

1759
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:10,120
Yeah.

1760
01:15:10,120 --> 01:15:13,880
And again, I like the movie, but like they're like, this is not for a general audience.

1761
01:15:13,880 --> 01:15:15,480
This is kind of what happened.

1762
01:15:15,480 --> 01:15:19,760
And even though I didn't get the amazing behind the scenes backstory of the making of this

1763
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:24,800
movie from watching the DVD commentary, I did find I was what I was looking for by listening

1764
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:29,080
to puppeteer Terry Hardin, a legend.

1765
01:15:29,080 --> 01:15:33,400
I mean, she, she did the state puff martial man and the original Ghostbusters.

1766
01:15:33,400 --> 01:15:34,400
Wow.

1767
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:35,400
She was baby Sinclair.

1768
01:15:35,400 --> 01:15:36,400
Wow.

1769
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:37,400
Yeah.

1770
01:15:37,400 --> 01:15:39,400
She was ID and Odie and Captain EO.

1771
01:15:39,400 --> 01:15:40,400
Wow.

1772
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:45,200
She, she went on the defunct land podcast and did a three part interview and it is fan

1773
01:15:45,200 --> 01:15:46,580
tastic.

1774
01:15:46,580 --> 01:15:47,580
My God.

1775
01:15:47,580 --> 01:15:50,700
The stories she tells are absolutely incredible.

1776
01:15:50,700 --> 01:15:54,300
And I got so much information from that.

1777
01:15:54,300 --> 01:15:57,940
And the third part of the interview is just about country bears.

1778
01:15:57,940 --> 01:15:58,940
Wow.

1779
01:15:58,940 --> 01:16:05,420
And she loved the experience of making the movie, but she said, you know, uh, the trailer

1780
01:16:05,420 --> 01:16:08,340
came out, the internet went nuts.

1781
01:16:08,340 --> 01:16:14,020
People bashed it left and right and Disney got scared and they pulled back on like the

1782
01:16:14,020 --> 01:16:16,500
promotion and the advertising and everything.

1783
01:16:16,500 --> 01:16:17,500
Oh, geez.

1784
01:16:18,420 --> 01:16:24,740
It is an odd trailer and I can't even pinpoint exactly why it makes the movie look much worse.

1785
01:16:24,740 --> 01:16:25,740
Me neither.

1786
01:16:25,740 --> 01:16:30,780
But I remember seeing the trailer and when it came out and I was just like, no, absolutely

1787
01:16:30,780 --> 01:16:31,780
not.

1788
01:16:31,780 --> 01:16:32,780
They should too.

1789
01:16:32,780 --> 01:16:35,700
I, I absolutely, I would have been making fun of this at the time.

1790
01:16:35,700 --> 01:16:36,700
Yeah.

1791
01:16:36,700 --> 01:16:41,540
Should they have hid the bears maybe in the trailer from the trailer?

1792
01:16:41,540 --> 01:16:44,420
Just be the unit like Tobolowski and satisfying.

1793
01:16:44,420 --> 01:16:45,420
I agree.

1794
01:16:45,420 --> 01:16:46,420
No, I agree.

1795
01:16:46,420 --> 01:16:50,780
And then the walk in there for Ghostbusters afterlife, you barely see any ghosts and you're

1796
01:16:50,780 --> 01:16:54,060
like, why would I go see this movie that has no big hit though?

1797
01:16:54,060 --> 01:16:56,820
But there are lots of ghosts in it and I enjoyed it.

1798
01:16:56,820 --> 01:17:00,780
So you know what I wish, you know, now I'm older.

1799
01:17:00,780 --> 01:17:01,780
I've learned my lesson.

1800
01:17:01,780 --> 01:17:04,220
I saw the trailer for Ghostbusters afterlife.

1801
01:17:04,220 --> 01:17:06,180
I was like, that doesn't look good.

1802
01:17:06,180 --> 01:17:10,100
I'm just going to tune out everything that I hear about it.

1803
01:17:10,100 --> 01:17:12,060
I don't want to know anything about it.

1804
01:17:12,060 --> 01:17:15,020
And I just went cold for like, and then I got a little extra tug of things.

1805
01:17:15,020 --> 01:17:16,300
I got pushed back a year.

1806
01:17:16,300 --> 01:17:17,300
Right.

1807
01:17:17,300 --> 01:17:19,060
I got extra time to forget that I saw the trailer.

1808
01:17:19,060 --> 01:17:20,060
Right.

1809
01:17:20,060 --> 01:17:21,060
And then I saw the movie.

1810
01:17:21,060 --> 01:17:22,060
I thought it was wonderful.

1811
01:17:22,060 --> 01:17:23,060
Okay.

1812
01:17:23,060 --> 01:17:25,300
Of course, not as good as the original, but sure.

1813
01:17:25,300 --> 01:17:27,300
You know, but you ha yeah.

1814
01:17:27,300 --> 01:17:29,940
So hiding the bears might've been the way to go.

1815
01:17:29,940 --> 01:17:31,220
Because then you're forced.

1816
01:17:31,220 --> 01:17:32,220
I don't know.

1817
01:17:32,220 --> 01:17:33,380
People are locked in the theater now.

1818
01:17:33,380 --> 01:17:36,260
They have no choice but to accept the way the bears look.

1819
01:17:36,260 --> 01:17:42,740
They have no choice but to accept the mechanical snouts and the eyes and the sexual eyes of

1820
01:17:42,740 --> 01:17:44,540
the female bear.

1821
01:17:44,780 --> 01:17:45,780
They have to.

1822
01:17:45,780 --> 01:17:47,340
They're there and then they will get used to it.

1823
01:17:47,340 --> 01:17:51,860
There are like, you do forget to, you calibrate to it, but then there's just moments like

1824
01:17:51,860 --> 01:17:56,380
it's not a lot, but once they're like eight minutes or so, there is a face that is just

1825
01:17:56,380 --> 01:17:57,380
ghastly.

1826
01:17:57,380 --> 01:17:58,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1827
01:17:58,380 --> 01:18:00,140
It's kind of like jump back.

1828
01:18:00,140 --> 01:18:05,620
But again, but I like it for the, I think it, look, if, if, if there's any greater point

1829
01:18:05,620 --> 01:18:10,020
here to this episode, I think it's like, this is a, an interesting watch.

1830
01:18:10,020 --> 01:18:11,020
This is absolutely.

1831
01:18:11,500 --> 01:18:15,260
And I like a movie that has like shit that doesn't work at all.

1832
01:18:15,260 --> 01:18:16,260
Sure.

1833
01:18:16,260 --> 01:18:20,140
I think it's fun that I, that I think the songs are bad and laugh at them.

1834
01:18:20,140 --> 01:18:22,540
But then in the next scene, there's something I actually like.

1835
01:18:22,540 --> 01:18:25,380
I like the like up and down nature of it.

1836
01:18:25,380 --> 01:18:26,780
I will grant you interesting.

1837
01:18:26,780 --> 01:18:33,020
If you will grant me that father, the pride is interesting in terms of what of the animation

1838
01:18:33,020 --> 01:18:39,180
of like, this is the, the, you know, the crawling, the infant stages of like early big budget.

1839
01:18:39,180 --> 01:18:40,780
We argue about this before.

1840
01:18:40,780 --> 01:18:43,220
No, no, I'm just saying I think it's interesting.

1841
01:18:43,220 --> 01:18:44,220
Wait, wait, hold on.

1842
01:18:44,220 --> 01:18:45,220
Can I ask a question?

1843
01:18:45,220 --> 01:18:46,220
Yeah.

1844
01:18:46,220 --> 01:18:50,860
Are you saying that father, the pride and country birds movie are equally as like a

1845
01:18:50,860 --> 01:18:53,540
level playing fields as far as quality is concerned?

1846
01:18:53,540 --> 01:18:59,740
No, I, I will say father of the pride or no, I will say this is, is more pleasant than

1847
01:18:59,740 --> 01:19:00,740
father of the problem.

1848
01:19:00,740 --> 01:19:01,740
Okay.

1849
01:19:01,740 --> 01:19:02,740
Okay.

1850
01:19:02,740 --> 01:19:04,940
I thought we were going to our extremists.

1851
01:19:04,940 --> 01:19:08,620
We were going to our extremist corners here and I was really about to be worried.

1852
01:19:08,620 --> 01:19:14,180
You say that country bears movie is more watchable than fuzz bucket.

1853
01:19:14,180 --> 01:19:17,180
Yeah, I think so.

1854
01:19:17,180 --> 01:19:20,140
I don't really remember much of fuzz bucket.

1855
01:19:20,140 --> 01:19:21,140
And you shouldn't.

1856
01:19:21,140 --> 01:19:26,580
But now I'm remembering like him going like, give me a kiss.

1857
01:19:26,580 --> 01:19:27,580
Or like, it's just whatever.

1858
01:19:27,580 --> 01:19:30,580
It's just whatever unpleasantness at the end when he finds the other fuzz bucket.

1859
01:19:30,580 --> 01:19:32,580
Way worse than anything honey bear does.

1860
01:19:32,580 --> 01:19:35,580
Unpleasantness at the end, only at the end.

1861
01:19:36,540 --> 01:19:39,540
It's just when there's more of them.

1862
01:19:39,540 --> 01:19:40,540
What does he say?

1863
01:19:40,540 --> 01:19:41,540
What's up party?

1864
01:19:41,540 --> 01:19:42,540
What's up party boy?

1865
01:19:42,540 --> 01:19:45,540
It is funny.

1866
01:19:45,540 --> 01:19:50,660
And that Disney war book, I, I don't remember this really coming up very much, but the thing

1867
01:19:50,660 --> 01:19:56,340
they were terrified by was the pirates of the Caribbean movie because it was like costing

1868
01:19:56,340 --> 01:19:57,340
a lot of money.

1869
01:19:57,340 --> 01:20:00,580
Jerry Bruckheimer costs a lot of money.

1870
01:20:00,580 --> 01:20:02,700
And they were getting reports from set.

1871
01:20:02,820 --> 01:20:06,620
Obviously, you know, they weren't transferring video digitally at the time.

1872
01:20:06,620 --> 01:20:12,380
They were getting reports from set that Johnny Depp is doing something weird and they didn't

1873
01:20:12,380 --> 01:20:13,380
know what that meant.

1874
01:20:13,380 --> 01:20:15,380
Like, and they were just terrified by that.

1875
01:20:15,380 --> 01:20:23,060
But I think the combination of Bruckheimer, Gore Verbinski and, and, you know, Orlando

1876
01:20:23,060 --> 01:20:26,100
Bloom and Keira Knightley, both kind of on the rise of that.

1877
01:20:26,100 --> 01:20:29,940
That movie had a lot more like in that column that it would be a hit.

1878
01:20:29,940 --> 01:20:30,940
Sure.

1879
01:20:31,180 --> 01:20:37,220
That movie that like Haunted Mansion is like not maybe committing to the full tone of the

1880
01:20:37,220 --> 01:20:38,220
ride.

1881
01:20:38,220 --> 01:20:42,220
Pirates of the Caribbean, I think is kind of like taking, it's not really the, honestly,

1882
01:20:42,220 --> 01:20:43,700
it's not really the tone of the ride.

1883
01:20:43,700 --> 01:20:44,700
It's kind of its own thing.

1884
01:20:44,700 --> 01:20:48,220
It's kind of a pirate movie with a new character that Johnny Depp just.

1885
01:20:48,220 --> 01:20:52,340
Which I believe Eisner pushed in that direction with how this movie did.

1886
01:20:52,340 --> 01:20:55,500
He's like, if you're going to do it, then just like do whatever you want.

1887
01:20:55,500 --> 01:21:00,140
The name recognition of the rides, but don't feel like you got to stick to just get away

1888
01:21:00,140 --> 01:21:01,140
from it.

1889
01:21:01,140 --> 01:21:04,540
Which is like, I guess smart only in hindsight because it worked.

1890
01:21:04,540 --> 01:21:05,540
Sure.

1891
01:21:05,540 --> 01:21:08,940
Because if it didn't work, you'd be like, well, why isn't it like more of these weirdo

1892
01:21:08,940 --> 01:21:13,020
guy pirates to talk like, like we'd be like lamenting that they didn't do that.

1893
01:21:13,020 --> 01:21:16,060
But meanwhile, it's the biggest franchise in history.

1894
01:21:16,060 --> 01:21:17,300
The mayor's not in it.

1895
01:21:17,300 --> 01:21:18,300
Whereas there's not enough slop.

1896
01:21:18,300 --> 01:21:21,260
I mean, there's some slop when the guys are hanging out in there.

1897
01:21:21,260 --> 01:21:25,900
There's not exactly nine chickens or however many are in there.

1898
01:21:25,900 --> 01:21:26,900
Right.

1899
01:21:26,900 --> 01:21:27,900
Exactly.

1900
01:21:27,980 --> 01:21:32,980
Diminishing returns on those sequels like, like from very high on that first movie to

1901
01:21:32,980 --> 01:21:34,980
like, oh yeah, sure.

1902
01:21:34,980 --> 01:21:37,180
Draw the program just dropping down.

1903
01:21:37,180 --> 01:21:40,340
I mean, I don't, I, I still stand by.

1904
01:21:40,340 --> 01:21:46,660
I think I said this on the film at 50 podcasts, like Walt Disney studios might have the worst

1905
01:21:46,660 --> 01:21:51,180
live action track record of movies, of any of the big studios.

1906
01:21:51,180 --> 01:21:53,380
If you compare it to like Warner Brothers or MGM.

1907
01:21:53,380 --> 01:21:55,820
The Herbie series, Jason.

1908
01:21:55,820 --> 01:21:57,540
Apple dumpling gang one and two.

1909
01:21:57,540 --> 01:21:58,540
Candle shoe.

1910
01:21:58,540 --> 01:22:02,940
Apple dumpling game shot at Golden Oaks Ranch, just like country bear jamboree.

1911
01:22:02,940 --> 01:22:03,940
Oh, wow.

1912
01:22:03,940 --> 01:22:04,940
There's that.

1913
01:22:04,940 --> 01:22:05,940
Yeah.

1914
01:22:05,940 --> 01:22:07,300
It's one ranch that they use a lot.

1915
01:22:07,300 --> 01:22:11,900
And isn't this, this location is still standing, I think, and has been used in other stuff.

1916
01:22:11,900 --> 01:22:17,900
I went, I drove up there like a year ago, like December during the pandemic.

1917
01:22:17,900 --> 01:22:19,500
Where are some places we can go?

1918
01:22:19,500 --> 01:22:23,980
I was like, did you know we're like 20 minutes from the Golden Oak Ranch?

1919
01:22:23,980 --> 01:22:26,780
And we, yeah, we went up there.

1920
01:22:26,780 --> 01:22:31,820
There's also like a beautiful national park or state park up like very close by.

1921
01:22:31,820 --> 01:22:34,020
So we kind of hit up both.

1922
01:22:34,020 --> 01:22:40,860
So we drove into the ranch, quickly realized there was filming going on and people in vests

1923
01:22:40,860 --> 01:22:42,860
were like, can we help you?

1924
01:22:42,860 --> 01:22:43,860
Oh, yeah.

1925
01:22:43,860 --> 01:22:45,860
Oh, sorry to turn it around.

1926
01:22:45,860 --> 01:22:48,660
I wouldn't bother anyone.

1927
01:22:48,660 --> 01:22:51,220
You should have been like, yeah, I'm here to act.

1928
01:22:51,220 --> 01:22:53,460
I've done stuff like that a million times.

1929
01:22:53,940 --> 01:22:54,940
Just played dumb.

1930
01:22:54,940 --> 01:22:55,940
Oh, I'm sorry.

1931
01:22:55,940 --> 01:22:56,940
I must have made a...

1932
01:22:56,940 --> 01:22:57,940
I'm so sorry.

1933
01:22:57,940 --> 01:22:59,780
How do I get back to the free way?

1934
01:22:59,780 --> 01:23:02,500
I love that, Jason.

1935
01:23:02,500 --> 01:23:05,580
Golden Oaks Ranch, you might have a second gate episode there.

1936
01:23:05,580 --> 01:23:06,580
I don't know.

1937
01:23:06,580 --> 01:23:07,580
I'm just going to throw that out there.

1938
01:23:07,580 --> 01:23:08,580
There's a lot of interesting stuff.

1939
01:23:08,580 --> 01:23:09,580
The office shot there.

1940
01:23:09,580 --> 01:23:10,580
A lot of big stuff shot there.

1941
01:23:10,580 --> 01:23:11,580
That's right.

1942
01:23:11,580 --> 01:23:12,580
Rice Shoots Farm.

1943
01:23:12,580 --> 01:23:13,580
Yeah.

1944
01:23:13,580 --> 01:23:18,140
I will say, we did talk, I was joking earlier, but if I am, if I'm doing Country Bears, I

1945
01:23:18,140 --> 01:23:22,140
would like it to be like Prairie Home Companion, the movie Prairie Home Companion, but with

1946
01:23:22,140 --> 01:23:25,140
the Country Bears, where it's just you're putting on the show.

1947
01:23:25,140 --> 01:23:26,140
Yeah.

1948
01:23:26,140 --> 01:23:30,300
I was saying, I think in the first one of these, I was making, I was saying that there

1949
01:23:30,300 --> 01:23:33,420
should be an Almost Famous about the band.

1950
01:23:33,420 --> 01:23:36,500
And that's, I realized watching this, like that's kind of what it is.

1951
01:23:36,500 --> 01:23:40,780
There's even like, you know, like there's a, there's kind of a fight that breaks everything

1952
01:23:40,780 --> 01:23:46,820
up at almost the same point of the movie in like, in a field, like a golden huge field.

1953
01:23:47,820 --> 01:23:53,700
And where the kid is now jaded about like, I thought these guys, you know, I thought

1954
01:23:53,700 --> 01:23:57,020
these guys cared, but they're just like, you know, you know, they're just a bunch of like

1955
01:23:57,020 --> 01:23:58,420
fighting rock stars.

1956
01:23:58,420 --> 01:24:02,980
But then the singer shows up in his bedroom and that brings everything back together and

1957
01:24:02,980 --> 01:24:03,980
resolves it.

1958
01:24:03,980 --> 01:24:06,820
It's actually oddly very close to Almost Famous.

1959
01:24:06,820 --> 01:24:07,820
Right.

1960
01:24:07,820 --> 01:24:08,820
Yeah.

1961
01:24:08,820 --> 01:24:13,500
I guess if I was directing a Country Bears movie now, I would just go all the way with

1962
01:24:14,260 --> 01:24:18,420
Well, the test audience find these bears a little creepy, like, okay, great.

1963
01:24:18,420 --> 01:24:23,540
Then let's go in that direction and just turn into a, like a Five Night at Freddy's situation.

1964
01:24:23,540 --> 01:24:24,540
That's what I would want.

1965
01:24:24,540 --> 01:24:25,540
Yeah.

1966
01:24:25,540 --> 01:24:26,780
Nightmare Bears.

1967
01:24:26,780 --> 01:24:31,660
I was going to say, Scott, I think you're exactly right.

1968
01:24:31,660 --> 01:24:36,660
And I'm sure that seems like catnip for executives that like people were going to be like, well,

1969
01:24:36,660 --> 01:24:38,780
you know, Almost Famous was a big hit.

1970
01:24:38,780 --> 01:24:41,020
What if we, you know, went with some of that?

1971
01:24:41,060 --> 01:24:47,380
I think the better comparison for the bears though, would be Walk the Line.

1972
01:24:47,380 --> 01:24:49,620
That is closer to the country roots.

1973
01:24:49,620 --> 01:24:55,420
Not necessarily the melodrama, but the heavy handed deadly seriousness of Walk the Line.

1974
01:24:55,420 --> 01:24:56,420
Yeah.

1975
01:24:56,420 --> 01:24:59,820
But is that what you'd want to see is the Walk the Line of...

1976
01:24:59,820 --> 01:25:02,220
That's still an invention.

1977
01:25:02,220 --> 01:25:05,340
That's still a lot of like getting it away from what you want, which is you want a hee

1978
01:25:05,340 --> 01:25:06,380
haw show.

1979
01:25:06,380 --> 01:25:07,580
You want them to just do hee haw.

1980
01:25:07,580 --> 01:25:08,580
That was good.

1981
01:25:08,580 --> 01:25:14,460
But I think you're forgetting how unpleasant the Prairie Home Companion movie is also.

1982
01:25:14,460 --> 01:25:16,740
I don't have a memory that that's unpleasant.

1983
01:25:16,740 --> 01:25:17,740
Oh, it sucked.

1984
01:25:17,740 --> 01:25:23,060
Like that movie is filled with stars with Robert Altman directing and Paul Thomas Anderson

1985
01:25:23,060 --> 01:25:24,060
is the backup director.

1986
01:25:24,060 --> 01:25:25,660
Yeah, because he dropped dead on set.

1987
01:25:25,660 --> 01:25:26,660
I remember.

1988
01:25:26,660 --> 01:25:28,100
No, it was in case he dropped dead.

1989
01:25:28,100 --> 01:25:29,100
That's what I said.

1990
01:25:29,100 --> 01:25:30,100
Yeah.

1991
01:25:30,100 --> 01:25:31,100
He didn't drop dead on set.

1992
01:25:31,100 --> 01:25:34,180
He was going to make Hands on a Hard Body and then he dropped dead.

1993
01:25:35,180 --> 01:25:38,740
And yeah, that movie is just kind of nothing.

1994
01:25:38,740 --> 01:25:39,740
I mean, I don't have...

1995
01:25:39,740 --> 01:25:41,580
I'm not acting like that's my favorite movie.

1996
01:25:41,580 --> 01:25:44,980
I just saw it at the time and it seemed pleasant and they were putting on a show and it's backstage

1997
01:25:44,980 --> 01:25:45,980
and stuff.

1998
01:25:45,980 --> 01:25:46,980
That's all I really mean by that.

1999
01:25:46,980 --> 01:25:49,900
And I want Country Bears to be doing a show.

2000
01:25:49,900 --> 01:25:52,540
You are right.

2001
01:25:52,540 --> 01:25:57,220
And I think the formula could work.

2002
01:25:57,220 --> 01:25:59,180
It worked for the Steve Jobs movie.

2003
01:25:59,180 --> 01:26:01,740
It worked for the Oscar nominated Steve Jobs.

2004
01:26:01,740 --> 01:26:02,740
Sure.

2005
01:26:02,740 --> 01:26:07,700
And I love how backstage and him about to put on his little shows.

2006
01:26:07,700 --> 01:26:08,700
Put on his little show.

2007
01:26:08,700 --> 01:26:10,900
He's going to do long unbroken shots.

2008
01:26:10,900 --> 01:26:11,900
I do like that.

2009
01:26:11,900 --> 01:26:19,380
Tension building, panic attacks and hallucinations occurring for Henry and Barry.

2010
01:26:19,380 --> 01:26:22,300
Fear of heights for swinging Teddy Barra.

2011
01:26:22,300 --> 01:26:23,860
You mentioned Robert Altman, Jason.

2012
01:26:23,860 --> 01:26:27,300
I wouldn't mind seeing like a Nashville style Country Bears movie.

2013
01:26:27,300 --> 01:26:28,660
Now there, that's great too.

2014
01:26:28,660 --> 01:26:29,660
I love that.

2015
01:26:30,660 --> 01:26:34,580
And it's mostly like people talking over each other, walking in and out of the scene.

2016
01:26:34,580 --> 01:26:35,580
Completely improvised.

2017
01:26:35,580 --> 01:26:40,020
Much like the 2001, 2002 Country Bears movie.

2018
01:26:40,020 --> 01:26:41,020
All the songs are bad.

2019
01:26:41,020 --> 01:26:42,020
In no way.

2020
01:26:42,020 --> 01:26:46,460
There's a couple songs in Nashville that are good.

2021
01:26:46,460 --> 01:26:47,580
It's one of my favorite movies.

2022
01:26:47,580 --> 01:26:51,100
I probably watched it like 12 times.

2023
01:26:51,100 --> 01:26:54,820
But this is different because I feel like those songs are bad on purpose because...

2024
01:26:54,820 --> 01:26:56,180
Well, they're funny.

2025
01:26:56,180 --> 01:26:57,180
A couple of them are funny.

2026
01:26:57,180 --> 01:26:58,300
Well, it's supposed to be realistic.

2027
01:26:58,300 --> 01:27:02,820
And when Altman went to Nashville and checked out the scene, he's like, oh, most of these

2028
01:27:02,820 --> 01:27:03,820
people are struggling.

2029
01:27:03,820 --> 01:27:04,820
They'll never make it.

2030
01:27:04,820 --> 01:27:06,460
And he wanted to reflect that in the movie.

2031
01:27:06,460 --> 01:27:07,780
So correct me if I'm wrong.

2032
01:27:07,780 --> 01:27:10,260
He had the actors write and sing their own songs.

2033
01:27:10,260 --> 01:27:11,260
Yes.

2034
01:27:11,260 --> 01:27:12,260
The actors write.

2035
01:27:12,260 --> 01:27:13,260
Yeah.

2036
01:27:13,260 --> 01:27:14,540
Who wrote It Don't Worry Me?

2037
01:27:14,540 --> 01:27:16,460
Because I think that is a good song.

2038
01:27:16,460 --> 01:27:17,460
Yeah.

2039
01:27:17,460 --> 01:27:22,180
I mean, yeah, some of these songs are good.

2040
01:27:22,180 --> 01:27:23,180
It Don't Worry Me.

2041
01:27:23,180 --> 01:27:24,380
Is that the Henry Gibson?

2042
01:27:24,980 --> 01:27:28,340
No, that's the first song is the patriotic one.

2043
01:27:28,340 --> 01:27:29,340
Oh, right, right.

2044
01:27:29,340 --> 01:27:30,340
That's funny as well.

2045
01:27:30,340 --> 01:27:31,340
I know he wrote that song.

2046
01:27:31,340 --> 01:27:32,340
Oh, right, right.

2047
01:27:32,340 --> 01:27:33,340
I'd have to look that up.

2048
01:27:33,340 --> 01:27:36,340
There's some good songs in Nashville.

2049
01:27:36,340 --> 01:27:37,340
Come on.

2050
01:27:37,340 --> 01:27:38,340
But I know what you mean.

2051
01:27:38,340 --> 01:27:41,340
I know, but they're not polished.

2052
01:27:41,340 --> 01:27:42,340
Yeah, that's true.

2053
01:27:42,340 --> 01:27:44,740
But some of them are funny.

2054
01:27:44,740 --> 01:27:47,900
There's a lot of avenues to go down with the Bears, I think.

2055
01:27:47,900 --> 01:27:52,140
Again, though, you have to ask the question, who is it for?

2056
01:27:52,140 --> 01:28:02,900
I think it's for three people in the garage, four people in the garage, and then half of

2057
01:28:02,900 --> 01:28:04,620
our listeners.

2058
01:28:04,620 --> 01:28:08,820
I'm curious to see if there's not a lot of public appetite for the country Bears out

2059
01:28:08,820 --> 01:28:11,180
there for the show or the movie.

2060
01:28:11,180 --> 01:28:15,220
Are we going to find there's also not a lot of appetite for a daily podcast series?

2061
01:28:15,220 --> 01:28:17,820
Is this our biggest mistake?

2062
01:28:17,820 --> 01:28:20,180
Are we deep in the middle of the biggest mistake?

2063
01:28:20,180 --> 01:28:23,100
We do live shows and you're like, is anyone going to come?

2064
01:28:23,100 --> 01:28:24,100
Yeah, man.

2065
01:28:24,100 --> 01:28:25,100
People listen.

2066
01:28:25,100 --> 01:28:26,100
When did I say that?

2067
01:28:26,100 --> 01:28:27,100
I feel like you're always hedging your bets.

2068
01:28:27,100 --> 01:28:28,100
False Jason, you're making up bullshit.

2069
01:28:28,100 --> 01:28:31,100
You just asked if people would watch a live streaming show.

2070
01:28:31,100 --> 01:28:32,100
I'm just saying.

2071
01:28:32,100 --> 01:28:40,100
A live stream of a, wait a minute, you have no, gee, fuck you, Sean.

2072
01:28:40,100 --> 01:28:41,100
False argument.

2073
01:28:41,100 --> 01:28:42,100
Okay, anyways.

2074
01:28:43,020 --> 01:28:44,020
Anyways, okay.

2075
01:28:44,020 --> 01:28:51,540
We at least I think made the point that this is a, this is fascinating, right?

2076
01:28:51,540 --> 01:28:54,460
I mean, yes, it's very, it is fascinating.

2077
01:28:54,460 --> 01:28:56,140
It is an interesting movie.

2078
01:28:56,140 --> 01:28:57,780
I'll grant that.

2079
01:28:57,780 --> 01:29:02,180
But it is better than the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise.

2080
01:29:02,180 --> 01:29:04,780
It's better than Haunted Mansion.

2081
01:29:04,780 --> 01:29:08,820
It's better than, wasn't there one more that's based on a ride around the summer?

2082
01:29:08,820 --> 01:29:09,820
My misremember.

2083
01:29:10,540 --> 01:29:13,900
Mission to Mars was made into a movie at some point.

2084
01:29:13,900 --> 01:29:15,780
That counts as a theme park movie?

2085
01:29:15,780 --> 01:29:16,780
Oh, okay.

2086
01:29:16,780 --> 01:29:17,780
I think so.

2087
01:29:17,780 --> 01:29:19,980
It was made by Disney and they made the ride.

2088
01:29:19,980 --> 01:29:27,060
Yeah, so, so no, it's, it's, it's really, really watchable and it, I don't know what

2089
01:29:27,060 --> 01:29:33,020
people were expecting it to be, but as we're saying, like it's full of surprises and I

2090
01:29:33,020 --> 01:29:36,940
know that sounds like I'm a movie reviewer from 1997.

2091
01:29:36,940 --> 01:29:39,220
It's full of surprises.

2092
01:29:39,220 --> 01:29:44,220
But it is and I, I'm happy to say that it's, I thought it was going to be dog shit.

2093
01:29:44,220 --> 01:29:46,500
I'd be happy to say it's dog shit.

2094
01:29:46,500 --> 01:29:50,340
I would relish in saying that it's dog shit, but it's not the case.

2095
01:29:50,340 --> 01:29:51,340
It's not the case.

2096
01:29:51,340 --> 01:29:55,740
It is 4.2 on IMDb, which is really low.

2097
01:29:55,740 --> 01:29:59,740
There's some, it was like bad movies that are above five and I don't have any off the

2098
01:29:59,740 --> 01:30:00,740
top of my head.

2099
01:30:00,740 --> 01:30:01,740
I know, but I'm just saying.

2100
01:30:01,740 --> 01:30:03,140
Like 31% on Rotten Tomatoes.

2101
01:30:03,140 --> 01:30:04,140
Yeah.

2102
01:30:04,140 --> 01:30:11,020
I think it's just because people don't, I will say we all have tolerance for anthropomorphic

2103
01:30:11,020 --> 01:30:12,020
animals.

2104
01:30:12,020 --> 01:30:13,020
Sure.

2105
01:30:13,020 --> 01:30:14,020
High tolerance.

2106
01:30:14,020 --> 01:30:15,020
Especially bears.

2107
01:30:15,020 --> 01:30:16,020
Especially bears.

2108
01:30:16,020 --> 01:30:17,020
So I'm sure that's part of it.

2109
01:30:17,020 --> 01:30:18,820
Once you say anthropomorphize the most, I would say.

2110
01:30:18,820 --> 01:30:22,700
But I believe, and I almost, I thought about this earlier.

2111
01:30:22,700 --> 01:30:28,620
I believe that we might be doing a disservice to this movie because I would love to be at

2112
01:30:29,620 --> 01:30:34,180
of the re-examining of this movie and saying that it's good.

2113
01:30:34,180 --> 01:30:35,180
No.

2114
01:30:35,180 --> 01:30:36,180
But you know what?

2115
01:30:36,180 --> 01:30:40,580
We've done that for like half a dozen things, but I'm not.

2116
01:30:40,580 --> 01:30:41,580
We have not.

2117
01:30:41,580 --> 01:30:42,580
I'd like to.

2118
01:30:42,580 --> 01:30:45,020
We did it with Clifford, but we didn't, we didn't all believe it.

2119
01:30:45,020 --> 01:30:48,460
And maybe wait after this airs and give it a week or two for people to go on Disney.

2120
01:30:48,460 --> 01:30:50,380
It is currently streaming on Disney Plus.

2121
01:30:50,380 --> 01:30:51,380
Yeah.

2122
01:30:51,380 --> 01:30:52,380
Easy access to it.

2123
01:30:52,380 --> 01:30:54,580
I'd love to see a Twitter poll and see what other people think.

2124
01:30:54,580 --> 01:30:55,580
I'm really curious.

2125
01:30:55,580 --> 01:30:58,260
I don't know how people land on this.

2126
01:30:58,260 --> 01:30:59,260
It's funny.

2127
01:30:59,260 --> 01:31:03,260
It's so fractured even within the, but I, most people haven't seen it.

2128
01:31:03,260 --> 01:31:04,620
I think that's the key.

2129
01:31:04,620 --> 01:31:05,980
Most people haven't seen it.

2130
01:31:05,980 --> 01:31:10,420
Kevin from the Funkland said that it's one of his greatest Disney guilty pleasures.

2131
01:31:10,420 --> 01:31:15,260
And I would go, I would go as far, and I trust that guy's opinion a lot.

2132
01:31:15,260 --> 01:31:18,420
I would go as far to say why guilty pleasure?

2133
01:31:18,420 --> 01:31:21,740
Well, I, as I get older, Doug, I agree.

2134
01:31:21,740 --> 01:31:25,380
I don't have any, my pleasures are my pleasures is what I say.

2135
01:31:25,420 --> 01:31:30,300
I had a big dumb Wendell Grin on my face while watching this.

2136
01:31:30,300 --> 01:31:35,140
I'm not mad like Jason yelling shit about the movie and about me for a reason I don't

2137
01:31:35,140 --> 01:31:36,140
quite understand.

2138
01:31:36,140 --> 01:31:39,460
Oh, I'm just ribbing.

2139
01:31:39,460 --> 01:31:40,460
Great rib.

2140
01:31:40,460 --> 01:31:42,980
Anyways, I don't know.

2141
01:31:42,980 --> 01:31:45,300
I just, I enjoyed it.

2142
01:31:45,300 --> 01:31:51,500
I think when you expect, like, I think I expected that this would be like when your expectations

2143
01:31:51,540 --> 01:31:52,540
are in the toilet.

2144
01:31:52,540 --> 01:31:53,540
Yes.

2145
01:31:53,540 --> 01:31:58,740
And then what you find is still a toilet, but it's a clean, fine toilet.

2146
01:31:58,740 --> 01:31:59,740
Yes.

2147
01:31:59,740 --> 01:32:01,700
Where you have a just, you actually take a breather.

2148
01:32:01,700 --> 01:32:02,700
It's spacious.

2149
01:32:02,700 --> 01:32:03,700
It's a bidet.

2150
01:32:03,700 --> 01:32:08,500
It's full of, it's a bidet, but it's also full of surprises.

2151
01:32:08,500 --> 01:32:11,620
You're getting squirts when you don't think, oh, here too.

2152
01:32:11,620 --> 01:32:12,620
You're getting squirts.

2153
01:32:12,620 --> 01:32:13,620
Yeah.

2154
01:32:13,620 --> 01:32:15,980
In places that you didn't think you were getting squirts of water.

2155
01:32:15,980 --> 01:32:18,420
And it's pleasurable and interesting.

2156
01:32:19,100 --> 01:32:23,340
Here's another weird, just like, I mean, we're winding it down here, but the like I have

2157
01:32:23,340 --> 01:32:28,900
now I have fond memories of this because of you, Doug, making us even possibly aware that

2158
01:32:28,900 --> 01:32:31,740
maybe this is not just dog shit.

2159
01:32:31,740 --> 01:32:34,840
And you know, what's really weird is when we're deep in the pandemic and nobody was

2160
01:32:34,840 --> 01:32:39,740
seeing each other for a while, sometimes like probably a lot of people looked at like, what

2161
01:32:39,740 --> 01:32:45,860
is the last photo they have in their phone of people being indoors with your friends

2162
01:32:45,860 --> 01:32:47,120
having fun.

2163
01:32:47,120 --> 01:32:52,400
And literally the last photo I have of that is Mike at what we now call the last party.

2164
01:32:52,400 --> 01:32:53,400
Of course, yes.

2165
01:32:53,400 --> 01:32:58,320
You had a birthday party and you are, you have a big smile on your face and you were

2166
01:32:58,320 --> 01:33:04,240
holding a handful of Country Bears movies action figures, which were handed to you by

2167
01:33:04,240 --> 01:33:05,240
Doug Jones.

2168
01:33:05,240 --> 01:33:06,240
Plush, I'll correct the record.

2169
01:33:06,240 --> 01:33:07,240
Okay, not like plastic.

2170
01:33:07,240 --> 01:33:08,240
Yeah.

2171
01:33:08,240 --> 01:33:10,480
Maybe they had plastic snouts.

2172
01:33:10,480 --> 01:33:12,280
I thought that was the ones on your note.

2173
01:33:12,280 --> 01:33:16,840
Yeah, they had plastic like, snouts and maybe a hat, like hat, but their body are plush.

2174
01:33:17,240 --> 01:33:18,240
They are plush.

2175
01:33:18,240 --> 01:33:21,520
How do you, how do you, how do you like them?

2176
01:33:21,520 --> 01:33:24,680
Now, do you think you're going to view them differently now that you've like?

2177
01:33:24,680 --> 01:33:26,360
Well I have them, I'll be very honest with you.

2178
01:33:26,360 --> 01:33:30,240
I have them in a box right now and it's really because of space.

2179
01:33:30,240 --> 01:33:32,040
And right now I really only have a lot of toys.

2180
01:33:32,040 --> 01:33:33,040
I have a lot of toys.

2181
01:33:33,040 --> 01:33:36,800
There's a few, few downstairs and there's a little bit of a Disney display, but there's

2182
01:33:36,800 --> 01:33:38,960
not enough room down there for them.

2183
01:33:38,960 --> 01:33:42,080
And upstairs it's basically just a wall of turtles shit.

2184
01:33:42,080 --> 01:33:43,780
And that's all I have on display right now.

2185
01:33:43,820 --> 01:33:49,340
But they are in storage and they are, I'm trying to think which box, I think it's downstairs

2186
01:33:49,340 --> 01:33:53,220
by the, by the car storage because I have two, I have a closet with some stuff and I

2187
01:33:53,220 --> 01:33:58,020
have a storage full of stuff that I will eventually display.

2188
01:33:58,020 --> 01:34:04,260
And I do, I will, I will say like when I would see them, I go, that's funny that I have them.

2189
01:34:04,260 --> 01:34:08,660
Obviously nice of Doug to give these to me, but I didn't have the affection as if they

2190
01:34:08,660 --> 01:34:09,940
were the characters from the ride.

2191
01:34:09,940 --> 01:34:12,940
So now I will reevaluate how I feel about them.

2192
01:34:13,100 --> 01:34:14,100
Yeah.

2193
01:34:14,100 --> 01:34:15,580
I think you're going to feel much differently towards them.

2194
01:34:15,580 --> 01:34:20,340
I can cycle some out, some of the stuff I have out now and put the bears on the, on

2195
01:34:20,340 --> 01:34:21,340
the thing.

2196
01:34:21,340 --> 01:34:27,140
Cause again, we are podcast, the ride, the three of us and Doug is our guest, endorse

2197
01:34:27,140 --> 01:34:28,140
this movie.

2198
01:34:28,140 --> 01:34:38,380
All three of us say, this is going to be think pieces, think pieces will be written and they'll

2199
01:34:38,540 --> 01:34:43,140
have to cite us at the start of it, of the reevaluation of this thing.

2200
01:34:43,140 --> 01:34:49,180
Podcast, in fact podcast, the ride hosts, Scott, Mike and Jason, all caps, fully sign

2201
01:34:49,180 --> 01:34:52,180
off on the underlines Jason.

2202
01:34:52,180 --> 01:35:01,020
No matter what take, how would we have done it if you were happy with it?

2203
01:35:01,020 --> 01:35:05,620
The same probably like this, this would have been much shorter.

2204
01:35:05,620 --> 01:35:06,620
That's what you're missing.

2205
01:35:06,860 --> 01:35:07,860
I don't know.

2206
01:35:07,860 --> 01:35:10,260
I don't really be toasty in your bed by now.

2207
01:35:10,260 --> 01:35:11,700
I know some of us didn't like it.

2208
01:35:11,700 --> 01:35:15,100
I am a little lightheaded because I didn't eat very much beforehand.

2209
01:35:15,100 --> 01:35:17,180
So I've probably feedered out.

2210
01:35:17,180 --> 01:35:19,020
Let's, let's, let's wind her down then.

2211
01:35:19,980 --> 01:35:22,300
Doug Jones, what a thing to have brought to the table.

2212
01:35:22,740 --> 01:35:25,700
You survived podcast, the ride, country bear chamber week.

2213
01:35:26,700 --> 01:35:31,660
Yeah, I think we got to, I think you got one in the wind column, at least by majority.

2214
01:35:31,660 --> 01:35:32,260
Right.

2215
01:35:32,260 --> 01:35:34,140
And oh my God, I just feel so good.

2216
01:35:34,380 --> 01:35:38,100
Doug was right about country bears, the movie.

2217
01:35:38,100 --> 01:35:38,500
You know what?

2218
01:35:38,500 --> 01:35:40,700
It takes a big man to admit that he's wrong.

2219
01:35:40,700 --> 01:35:41,580
And I appreciate that.

2220
01:35:41,580 --> 01:35:42,420
Mike, I was wrong.

2221
01:35:42,420 --> 01:35:43,620
Much no problem.

2222
01:35:43,620 --> 01:35:48,180
Now big Carlson eventually we'll have to do.

2223
01:35:48,180 --> 01:35:50,060
I've said this a full pizza riso.

2224
01:35:50,060 --> 01:35:50,700
Oh hell yeah.

2225
01:35:50,700 --> 01:35:53,180
I'll say this for me, the jury's still out.

2226
01:35:54,020 --> 01:35:54,860
That's all I'll say.

2227
01:35:54,860 --> 01:35:56,140
Oh, this is interesting.

2228
01:35:56,140 --> 01:35:58,140
Now y'all have been there, but not everyone.

2229
01:35:58,140 --> 01:35:59,220
Not eaten.

2230
01:35:59,220 --> 01:35:59,580
Okay.

2231
01:35:59,580 --> 01:36:00,540
And we have to eat.

2232
01:36:00,540 --> 01:36:01,660
We have to go in the room.

2233
01:36:01,660 --> 01:36:05,860
When I first brought it up on the podcast, I had not eaten there.

2234
01:36:06,460 --> 01:36:13,540
And then a few months later, I went back and I tried the food and two thumbs up.

2235
01:36:13,940 --> 01:36:14,780
Thumbs up on the food.

2236
01:36:14,780 --> 01:36:16,380
Cause I feel like I hear that.

2237
01:36:16,380 --> 01:36:18,820
It is above average quick serve.

2238
01:36:18,860 --> 01:36:20,700
Like it is above average in my opinion.

2239
01:36:20,820 --> 01:36:21,100
All right.

2240
01:36:21,100 --> 01:36:22,100
Fresh ingredients.

2241
01:36:22,940 --> 01:36:23,500
Yeah.

2242
01:36:23,620 --> 01:36:26,940
I share Scott's skepticism, but I'm willing to try anything once.

2243
01:36:27,460 --> 01:36:28,540
So yeah, we'll see.

2244
01:36:28,540 --> 01:36:30,460
So, but I was wrong about country bears movie.

2245
01:36:30,460 --> 01:36:31,820
So what else could I be wrong about?

2246
01:36:31,900 --> 01:36:32,180
Wow.

2247
01:36:32,180 --> 01:36:32,460
Wow.

2248
01:36:32,460 --> 01:36:33,860
Anything we'll find out.

2249
01:36:35,060 --> 01:36:35,580
Respect.

2250
01:36:35,740 --> 01:36:36,140
Thank you.

2251
01:36:36,420 --> 01:36:37,220
Exit the gift shop.

2252
01:36:37,220 --> 01:36:39,220
Anything you'd like to plug or where can people find?

2253
01:36:39,420 --> 01:36:40,460
Oh, sure.

2254
01:36:40,980 --> 01:36:47,580
If you guys don't mind, I have some like upcoming dates, a calendar of events, if you

2255
01:36:47,580 --> 01:36:48,620
will, please.

2256
01:36:48,620 --> 01:36:49,300
Thank you.

2257
01:36:50,740 --> 01:36:55,420
So playing with like a bunch of bears or a bunch of bears who sound like Don Henley or

2258
01:36:55,620 --> 01:36:58,380
not, not quite, but you're on the right track.

2259
01:36:58,940 --> 01:37:04,980
So on Tuesday of next week, I will be at PIMS test kitchen and they've asked me to

2260
01:37:04,980 --> 01:37:08,060
do a little beta testing for their new $100 pretzel.

2261
01:37:10,380 --> 01:37:10,860
Oh yeah.

2262
01:37:11,340 --> 01:37:11,740
Wow.

2263
01:37:11,740 --> 01:37:12,100
Okay.

2264
01:37:13,100 --> 01:37:17,780
The following day, which would be Wednesday, I will be at the blind tiger, which is

2265
01:37:17,780 --> 01:37:20,060
the fake speak easy at Knott's Berry farm.

2266
01:37:20,460 --> 01:37:24,140
And I'll be pretending that I'm the bouncer and telling people that they've

2267
01:37:24,180 --> 01:37:25,980
quote unquote reach capacity.

2268
01:37:25,980 --> 01:37:26,420
Okay.

2269
01:37:30,420 --> 01:37:36,780
Thursday, I will be at universal city walk AMC theater bar, having too much to drink

2270
01:37:36,780 --> 01:37:41,900
and complaining to anyone who will listen that I should have been cast and ghost

2271
01:37:41,900 --> 01:37:44,060
busters afterlife instead of Paul Rudd.

2272
01:37:46,060 --> 01:37:50,540
So if anybody like wants, that's where you could find me and you could, I don't know

2273
01:37:50,540 --> 01:37:53,540
what I'm doing with the rest of my day, but you're welcome to follow me.

2274
01:37:53,580 --> 01:37:54,580
Would you call it a tour?

2275
01:37:54,780 --> 01:37:55,180
Sure.

2276
01:37:55,460 --> 01:37:55,780
Okay.

2277
01:37:56,260 --> 01:37:58,900
I gotta say these are my favorite plugs I've ever heard.

2278
01:37:59,060 --> 01:37:59,340
Yeah.

2279
01:37:59,420 --> 01:38:00,300
You're thank you.

2280
01:38:00,620 --> 01:38:02,060

01:38:02,940 --> 01:38:05,700
More where you're ended in the year doing a lot of work too.

01:38:05,700 --> 01:38:08,740
Just even more than 2022 is looking good.

2283
01:38:08,740 --> 01:38:09,140
Boys.
