1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,240
FOREVER!

2
00:00:05,496 --> 00:00:09,256
Warning, if the following podcast stops working,

3
00:00:09,696 --> 00:00:12,856
switch it to beam mode and just flash some lights at it.

4
00:00:13,016 --> 00:00:15,756
Then buckle up for fawning over Joe Roady,

5
00:00:16,296 --> 00:00:18,976
multiple instances of travel channel voice.

6
00:00:19,336 --> 00:00:20,896
And just when you think it's over,

7
00:00:21,256 --> 00:00:24,656
the episode plummets backwards into a tangent

8
00:00:24,656 --> 00:00:26,996
about a shady deep cable show.

9
00:00:27,436 --> 00:00:30,656
This is Expedition Everest on Podcast The Ride.

10
00:00:50,776 --> 00:00:53,896
Welcome to Podcast the Ride, the show hosted by three men

11
00:00:53,896 --> 00:00:57,336
who fear and respect the power of the yeti.

12
00:00:57,776 --> 00:01:00,096
I'm Jason Sheridan, joined by Mike Carlson.

13
00:01:00,196 --> 00:01:01,416
Yep, I respect him.

14
00:01:01,616 --> 00:01:02,296
And Scott Gertner.

15
00:01:02,696 --> 00:01:05,576
Very much right, and you won't hear any disrespects

16
00:01:05,576 --> 00:01:06,256
in this episode.

17
00:01:07,036 --> 00:01:08,876
Why do I assume the yeti is a male?

18
00:01:08,916 --> 00:01:10,776
Do we know what the gender of the yeti is?

19
00:01:11,856 --> 00:01:15,636
You know, I've read a lot about it,

20
00:01:15,656 --> 00:01:16,576
getting ready for this.

21
00:01:16,776 --> 00:01:19,396
I don't think I really saw that discussed.

22
00:01:19,396 --> 00:01:21,616
Yeah, it's not specifically said.

23
00:01:21,696 --> 00:01:25,416
Nor the abominable snowman in the Matterhorn.

24
00:01:25,596 --> 00:01:26,896
Right, that's interesting.

25
00:01:27,176 --> 00:01:29,176
Yeah, I assume, but I guess that must be

26
00:01:29,176 --> 00:01:30,576
maybe just the sexist thing.

27
00:01:30,876 --> 00:01:33,656
Because it could be like a killer female yeti.

28
00:01:34,036 --> 00:01:34,376
Or a, yeah.

29
00:01:34,396 --> 00:01:37,996
Well, I don't know, based on the size of that animatronic,

30
00:01:38,096 --> 00:01:41,836
if it were male, that big old thing would be dangling down

31
00:01:41,836 --> 00:01:43,536
and smacking riders in the face.

32
00:01:43,636 --> 00:01:44,396
Oh, good point.

33
00:01:44,416 --> 00:01:46,836
So, yeah, maybe it is female.

34
00:01:46,996 --> 00:01:47,996
Yeah, you're talking about a dick.

35
00:01:47,996 --> 00:01:49,796
You're talking about a big yeti dick.

36
00:01:49,796 --> 00:01:52,196
Unfortunately, the hog stopped working

37
00:01:52,196 --> 00:01:53,936
about 10 years ago as well.

38
00:01:54,256 --> 00:01:57,276
They designed it, yeah, that wasn't gonna do so much.

39
00:01:57,636 --> 00:02:00,256
That was C mode, that was C mode.

40
00:02:00,916 --> 00:02:02,116
The dick comes out. D mode.

41
00:02:02,116 --> 00:02:03,396
I was gonna say D mode.

42
00:02:04,156 --> 00:02:06,076
I was just adjusting the levels, and I was like,

43
00:02:06,116 --> 00:02:09,336
I got that D mode joke geared up, and then Scott did it.

44
00:02:09,616 --> 00:02:10,036
But yeah.

45
00:02:10,736 --> 00:02:11,416
Yeah, all set.

46
00:02:12,816 --> 00:02:14,296
Sorry, grandmothers and mothers,

47
00:02:14,356 --> 00:02:16,156
it's a little something we don't get to do a lot.

48
00:02:16,256 --> 00:02:19,536
But we're still not considering this disrespect.

49
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:22,076
We won't go into D mode in terms of disrespect

50
00:02:22,076 --> 00:02:23,236
of the almighty yeti.

51
00:02:23,276 --> 00:02:27,576
No, we also fear and respect the almighty yeti's hog.

52
00:02:30,276 --> 00:02:31,736
The damage it could do.

53
00:02:31,956 --> 00:02:34,036
We're talking Expedition Everest today.

54
00:02:34,156 --> 00:02:34,636
Yes.

55
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:38,076
The E-ticket roller coaster attraction at Animal Kingdom,

56
00:02:38,436 --> 00:02:41,156
and I believe, I said this at our text messages,

57
00:02:42,076 --> 00:02:44,036
our first Animal Kingdom attraction.

58
00:02:44,536 --> 00:02:45,616
Yeah, that is weird.

59
00:02:45,616 --> 00:02:48,996
Is what made me go immediately, yes, we need to do it.

60
00:02:49,016 --> 00:02:50,296
I felt a lot of guilt.

61
00:02:50,856 --> 00:02:51,696
What have we been doing?

62
00:02:51,736 --> 00:02:54,496
How have we not represented this park

63
00:02:54,496 --> 00:02:57,436
in so many weeks and weeks and weeks of shows?

64
00:02:57,496 --> 00:02:59,076
Well, I think that's fitting,

65
00:02:59,156 --> 00:03:00,836
because I feel like Animal Kingdom

66
00:03:00,836 --> 00:03:04,416
kind of often much maligned.

67
00:03:04,676 --> 00:03:07,856
So like, I don't wanna say unfairly maligned.

68
00:03:08,116 --> 00:03:08,596
I agree.

69
00:03:08,756 --> 00:03:10,716
I don't wanna say the redheaded stepchild,

70
00:03:10,876 --> 00:03:14,896
but I think it got a lot of flack when it first opened

71
00:03:15,836 --> 00:03:17,816
of like, not enough rides here.

72
00:03:18,136 --> 00:03:19,176
There's not enough rides.

73
00:03:19,476 --> 00:03:21,816
Well, I don't think that's unjustified,

74
00:03:21,836 --> 00:03:22,876
and you're allowed to make that.

75
00:03:22,976 --> 00:03:25,376
I did feel that when I went with my family

76
00:03:25,376 --> 00:03:27,276
whenever it was open.

77
00:03:27,336 --> 00:03:28,656
I guess we went in 99.

78
00:03:28,876 --> 00:03:31,116
I just remember feeling like not enough to do,

79
00:03:31,216 --> 00:03:34,776
too much McDonald's and not enough shade.

80
00:03:35,936 --> 00:03:36,616
Well, yeah.

81
00:03:36,976 --> 00:03:39,056
So the McDonald's partnership is very bizarre,

82
00:03:39,156 --> 00:03:42,236
and we could probably do a whole episode about that,

83
00:03:42,236 --> 00:03:45,516
or about Disney's various odd corporate partnerships.

84
00:03:45,676 --> 00:03:48,796
But the shade, that I think has been rectified

85
00:03:48,796 --> 00:03:51,876
by the passage of time, by trees growing.

86
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:53,496
Yeah, and that's a complaint you would've made

87
00:03:53,496 --> 00:03:55,716
about Disneyland in 1955.

88
00:03:55,996 --> 00:03:57,736
And California Adventure got that a lot.

89
00:03:57,876 --> 00:03:59,916
They were like, why are these redwood trees so tiny?

90
00:04:00,036 --> 00:04:00,496
And it's like, well,

91
00:04:00,516 --> 00:04:03,076
because you don't just get a giant redwood tree.

92
00:04:03,096 --> 00:04:04,416
You gotta let it grow.

93
00:04:04,716 --> 00:04:05,596
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

94
00:04:06,476 --> 00:04:07,936
I was just gonna say for like a kid,

95
00:04:07,976 --> 00:04:09,316
because I think I had a similar feeling.

96
00:04:09,336 --> 00:04:10,636
I was very excited about it.

97
00:04:10,636 --> 00:04:12,256
I didn't dislike it or anything,

98
00:04:12,256 --> 00:04:14,336
but when I went as a kid, it was very much like,

99
00:04:14,476 --> 00:04:15,776
well, where are the rides?

100
00:04:16,136 --> 00:04:17,476
And I didn't quite get it.

101
00:04:17,596 --> 00:04:20,176
But I think if I had first appreciated it as like,

102
00:04:20,736 --> 00:04:24,116
a 34 year old man who likes to sit around these places

103
00:04:24,116 --> 00:04:26,556
as much as go on a ride,

104
00:04:26,956 --> 00:04:28,636
I think I would've appreciated it

105
00:04:28,636 --> 00:04:30,056
for its theming and everything.

106
00:04:30,256 --> 00:04:32,976
But I get it why, if you're going there,

107
00:04:32,996 --> 00:04:34,296
because you're like, I wanna go on some rides.

108
00:04:34,456 --> 00:04:36,876
And then you like, there's like a safari,

109
00:04:36,956 --> 00:04:40,276
and there's seeing animals, and what is dinosaurs?

110
00:04:40,996 --> 00:04:44,176
But I mean, like when opening day especially,

111
00:04:44,736 --> 00:04:46,656
it's like, isn't Countdown to Extinction

112
00:04:46,656 --> 00:04:48,936
the biggest thrill ride,

113
00:04:49,016 --> 00:04:51,116
the most exciting ride they have there is that one?

114
00:04:51,516 --> 00:04:53,896
I think that was the thrill ride,

115
00:04:54,016 --> 00:04:55,676
and Expedition Everest was like

116
00:04:55,676 --> 00:04:59,556
the big thrill ride expansion sort of thing.

117
00:04:59,856 --> 00:05:03,096
But yeah, I think one of the most thoughtfully designed

118
00:05:03,096 --> 00:05:06,896
parks out there, I just think like you run into,

119
00:05:07,316 --> 00:05:10,096
people have expectations now when they go to these places.

120
00:05:10,616 --> 00:05:12,836
Yeah, well and I think it was,

121
00:05:13,616 --> 00:05:17,336
I find in general the late 90s

122
00:05:17,336 --> 00:05:21,136
to be an unpleasant time in the Disney parks,

123
00:05:21,316 --> 00:05:23,716
with things like the Too Much McDonald's,

124
00:05:23,736 --> 00:05:24,996
Weird Little Cheapo,

125
00:05:26,336 --> 00:05:29,496
like I felt like they were cheapening out in some areas.

126
00:05:29,636 --> 00:05:33,256
It was not, the golden era of the early 90s

127
00:05:33,256 --> 00:05:35,296
was starting to decay a little bit,

128
00:05:35,296 --> 00:05:38,396
and I cannot but wonder if Animal Kingdom

129
00:05:38,396 --> 00:05:40,156
would have come out of the gate stronger

130
00:05:40,156 --> 00:05:43,276
with more early 90s spending.

131
00:05:43,896 --> 00:05:45,736
Oh yeah, well there's the whole,

132
00:05:46,376 --> 00:05:46,896
And this is- Beastly.

133
00:05:46,996 --> 00:05:49,036
Yeah, that's too much to talk,

134
00:05:49,056 --> 00:05:50,056
we'll do that another episode,

135
00:05:50,236 --> 00:05:51,136
but in case you didn't know,

136
00:05:51,376 --> 00:05:53,216
there was going to be a whole thing,

137
00:05:53,716 --> 00:05:57,816
a whole different fantasy area of fantasy animals,

138
00:05:57,856 --> 00:05:59,756
and that had I think a crazy roller coaster

139
00:05:59,756 --> 00:06:01,876
that went through a castle and dragons,

140
00:06:02,256 --> 00:06:03,736
and there's a whole thing which,

141
00:06:03,896 --> 00:06:05,656
this blows my mind, there was gonna be a maze

142
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:07,736
where you were gonna find I think a unicorn,

143
00:06:07,736 --> 00:06:10,216
I believe, and you were gonna meet

144
00:06:10,216 --> 00:06:13,136
a bunch of mythical creatures in the maze,

145
00:06:13,136 --> 00:06:15,076
so you'd come over and I don't know what else

146
00:06:15,076 --> 00:06:18,336
is a mythical centaur or something or whatever.

147
00:06:18,636 --> 00:06:19,696
The minotaur I believe,

148
00:06:20,156 --> 00:06:21,476
traditionally guards the mazes.

149
00:06:21,896 --> 00:06:24,076
And then you would meet all these different characters,

150
00:06:24,096 --> 00:06:25,676
and then when you got to the unicorn,

151
00:06:26,116 --> 00:06:28,836
the unicorn would talk to you

152
00:06:28,836 --> 00:06:32,496
using vibrations in the floor.

153
00:06:33,016 --> 00:06:35,176
The idea was that it would be mentally,

154
00:06:35,176 --> 00:06:37,296
like telepathically communicating with you,

155
00:06:37,296 --> 00:06:38,796
this is how I understand it at least,

156
00:06:39,016 --> 00:06:43,836
and they were gonna do it by turning the voice down so low

157
00:06:43,836 --> 00:06:47,036
that you would feel what the thing was saying

158
00:06:47,036 --> 00:06:48,156
and not hearing it,

159
00:06:48,156 --> 00:06:50,256
so you would feel a vibration of like,

160
00:06:50,276 --> 00:06:52,236
thank you for finding me.

161
00:06:52,736 --> 00:06:55,596
So the idea was to make it feel like it was in your head.

162
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:57,476
It feels like it might have been unpleasant.

163
00:06:58,456 --> 00:06:58,856
But yeah.

164
00:06:58,856 --> 00:06:59,796
Yeah, this creeps me out.

165
00:06:59,856 --> 00:07:01,916
This is like sex with dolphins.

166
00:07:02,476 --> 00:07:02,956
But, well sure.

167
00:07:02,976 --> 00:07:05,576
This is some weird vibrations and moods.

168
00:07:05,616 --> 00:07:08,696
Everyone would have gotten very horny from the vibration.

169
00:07:08,916 --> 00:07:10,716
Yeah, I think low frequency sounds

170
00:07:10,716 --> 00:07:13,716
can sometimes drive people insane too,

171
00:07:13,896 --> 00:07:15,216
like if I understand it.

172
00:07:15,336 --> 00:07:17,296
Yeah, I mean, they're Imagineers.

173
00:07:17,296 --> 00:07:19,016
I'm sure they had a cool way to do it

174
00:07:19,016 --> 00:07:20,096
and it would have blown us away.

175
00:07:20,576 --> 00:07:21,756
But there was a whole bunch,

176
00:07:22,056 --> 00:07:23,216
there was going to be an area,

177
00:07:23,236 --> 00:07:24,976
I think they probably also felt like,

178
00:07:25,136 --> 00:07:27,276
well that'll be the part that has all the ride.

179
00:07:27,276 --> 00:07:29,456
That'll be the exciting stuff in the rides.

180
00:07:29,736 --> 00:07:31,916
This is the nature stuff that's real,

181
00:07:31,956 --> 00:07:32,776
and you can see real animals.

182
00:07:32,776 --> 00:07:36,376
And now here's our Disney fun fantastical area with.

183
00:07:36,556 --> 00:07:37,116
Yeah, totally right.

184
00:07:37,176 --> 00:07:38,836
That's the missing component, I think.

185
00:07:39,016 --> 00:07:40,236
That was cut from the budget.

186
00:07:41,256 --> 00:07:45,136
But the logic of the park is not dissimilar from Epcot.

187
00:07:45,516 --> 00:07:47,376
Except in this case, it's like,

188
00:07:47,736 --> 00:07:48,836
the story we're trying to tell

189
00:07:48,836 --> 00:07:50,996
is the animal kingdom conservation.

190
00:07:51,416 --> 00:07:53,356
And the way that Epcot is,

191
00:07:53,356 --> 00:07:56,516
we're talking about the future and innovation

192
00:07:56,516 --> 00:07:59,396
and also like worldwide cultures and stuff.

193
00:07:59,496 --> 00:08:00,696
And when Epcot first opened,

194
00:08:00,696 --> 00:08:03,696
it did have more attractions than animal kingdom,

195
00:08:04,096 --> 00:08:05,216
I'm assuming, right?

196
00:08:05,316 --> 00:08:06,216
That probably makes sense.

197
00:08:06,696 --> 00:08:09,476
But added a lot more over the years

198
00:08:09,476 --> 00:08:11,696
where it does feel more filled out now.

199
00:08:11,836 --> 00:08:14,016
And certainly animal kingdom feels more filled out

200
00:08:14,016 --> 00:08:15,656
with Pandora in there.

201
00:08:16,196 --> 00:08:17,236
Yeah, well they've only added,

202
00:08:17,236 --> 00:08:20,836
they've added three big things,

203
00:08:20,936 --> 00:08:23,576
but they're big, they're big old deals.

204
00:08:23,916 --> 00:08:26,296
And I haven't been in a very, very long time.

205
00:08:26,736 --> 00:08:28,776
And I'm like, it's probably now at this point

206
00:08:28,776 --> 00:08:30,516
the one I'm the most anxious to go to,

207
00:08:30,736 --> 00:08:31,516
having not done Avatar

208
00:08:31,516 --> 00:08:33,956
and having not done Expedition Everest.

209
00:08:34,116 --> 00:08:35,676
I've not been on this ride.

210
00:08:36,456 --> 00:08:39,156
And I'm dying to do it now.

211
00:08:39,556 --> 00:08:41,936
Like having thought of, I knew it was cool,

212
00:08:42,016 --> 00:08:43,116
I'm aware it was cool.

213
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:45,696
But just really thinking about it,

214
00:08:45,696 --> 00:08:48,676
watching special about it, watching ride throughs,

215
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:52,756
and me being several percentage points braver now.

216
00:08:54,156 --> 00:08:56,016
Ain't no launch on this one.

217
00:08:56,336 --> 00:08:58,356
And I'm more increasingly okay with launches.

218
00:08:58,356 --> 00:09:00,456
And it's a slower lift hill.

219
00:09:00,996 --> 00:09:01,916
You're good with that.

220
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:05,256
It is not, the coaster itself is not overwhelming,

221
00:09:05,536 --> 00:09:07,516
but like the magic tricks associated,

222
00:09:07,616 --> 00:09:09,656
it looks intimidating by design.

223
00:09:09,696 --> 00:09:13,176
Yeah, and looks very, looks very high.

224
00:09:13,536 --> 00:09:15,816
It looks, I mean when it is, it gets up there.

225
00:09:16,376 --> 00:09:19,996
Highest attraction, tallest attraction in Walt Disney World.

226
00:09:20,276 --> 00:09:20,596
Yeah.

227
00:09:20,716 --> 00:09:22,696
Six inches taller than Tower of Terror

228
00:09:22,696 --> 00:09:27,296
and half a foot shorter than the requirement

229
00:09:27,296 --> 00:09:29,336
to have a blinking red light on it

230
00:09:29,336 --> 00:09:31,316
to alert low flying planes.

231
00:09:31,756 --> 00:09:32,236
Right. Wow.

232
00:09:32,556 --> 00:09:35,156
It's 200 feet is when you have to put that on.

233
00:09:35,196 --> 00:09:38,176
This is apparently 199 and a half feet.

234
00:09:38,576 --> 00:09:41,976
And they still, I like that they got it down to inches.

235
00:09:41,976 --> 00:09:42,516
Yeah.

236
00:09:42,756 --> 00:09:44,916
To just inch out Tower of Terror.

237
00:09:45,136 --> 00:09:46,136
Take that Tower of Terror.

238
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:49,556
Yeah, one of my favorite things while being on it,

239
00:09:49,796 --> 00:09:51,356
I've probably, because I hadn't been on it

240
00:09:51,356 --> 00:09:54,136
until we went for the first time like five years ago.

241
00:09:54,536 --> 00:09:56,996
I've probably now been on it six times,

242
00:09:56,996 --> 00:09:58,256
I feel like six or seven times.

243
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:01,056
The best is that lift hill, not the best,

244
00:10:01,096 --> 00:10:03,316
but one of the cool parts of it is that lift hill

245
00:10:03,316 --> 00:10:07,516
and you just see flat Florida swamp everywhere

246
00:10:07,516 --> 00:10:10,156
and then you see Tower of Terror poking up over here.

247
00:10:10,396 --> 00:10:12,476
You see the Magic Kingdom poking up over here.

248
00:10:12,836 --> 00:10:15,696
I've tried to see, I think I did see Universal

249
00:10:15,696 --> 00:10:16,716
at a certain point, because that then.

250
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:17,276
Really? Wow.

251
00:10:17,276 --> 00:10:18,416
Like the fourth time I was like,

252
00:10:18,496 --> 00:10:19,456
okay, where's Universal at?

253
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:21,396
So I'm like looking and that's a far drive.

254
00:10:21,456 --> 00:10:23,396
Maybe I just saw where it would be, I can't remember.

255
00:10:23,516 --> 00:10:26,876
That's about 12, 13 miles north, I think.

256
00:10:27,816 --> 00:10:30,376
I wanna say I kind of saw it,

257
00:10:30,436 --> 00:10:31,696
but maybe that's just my memory.

258
00:10:31,836 --> 00:10:34,236
But I found that to be a very fun game

259
00:10:34,236 --> 00:10:37,276
of trying to find all the different peaks

260
00:10:37,276 --> 00:10:39,636
in the whole theme park area.

261
00:10:40,376 --> 00:10:44,676
That moment seems so incredibly dramatic and cool

262
00:10:44,676 --> 00:10:46,696
and I can't wait to, I'm like,

263
00:10:46,856 --> 00:10:49,336
this is such a priority for me now.

264
00:10:49,336 --> 00:10:50,196
I really wanna go on there.

265
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:53,896
That too, there's no catwalks

266
00:10:53,896 --> 00:10:55,316
on either side of that lift hill.

267
00:10:55,756 --> 00:10:57,416
That's to me what looks very crazy.

268
00:10:57,416 --> 00:10:58,636
It's just the track.

269
00:10:59,156 --> 00:10:59,876
Yeah, that's great.

270
00:11:00,496 --> 00:11:03,256
I've ridden this thing in the rain a couple times.

271
00:11:03,256 --> 00:11:05,056
Oh my god. Lindsay and I did it

272
00:11:05,056 --> 00:11:07,296
in the rippling, like pummeling rain.

273
00:11:07,976 --> 00:11:09,196
And it, god, it was fun.

274
00:11:09,316 --> 00:11:11,396
It was so great getting hit in the face

275
00:11:11,396 --> 00:11:12,656
with rain on this thing.

276
00:11:13,116 --> 00:11:14,016
I think I went on it,

277
00:11:14,036 --> 00:11:15,736
because then the line got way short.

278
00:11:16,036 --> 00:11:18,716
So then I think I went on it again in the rain.

279
00:11:19,256 --> 00:11:20,216
I think I did that.

280
00:11:20,236 --> 00:11:23,316
I remember going in 2012 on the very last day of a trip,

281
00:11:23,396 --> 00:11:26,636
got up very early to make sure my bags were packed

282
00:11:26,636 --> 00:11:29,636
and took the bus from Wilderness Lodge

283
00:11:29,636 --> 00:11:35,236
to Animal Kingdom to ride a dinosaur and this.

284
00:11:35,856 --> 00:11:37,816
Maybe just do a lap around the park

285
00:11:37,816 --> 00:11:39,756
before I had to get back and eat lunch

286
00:11:39,756 --> 00:11:40,856
and then get to the airport.

287
00:11:41,376 --> 00:11:43,336
But I remember getting off this

288
00:11:43,336 --> 00:11:45,376
and just being stunned.

289
00:11:45,836 --> 00:11:47,296
That was great.

290
00:11:47,476 --> 00:11:49,316
And then walking out of the park going,

291
00:11:50,136 --> 00:11:52,096
and this has happened the last time I went too,

292
00:11:52,436 --> 00:11:55,156
and this is the park I wish I spent more time in.

293
00:11:55,436 --> 00:11:57,576
Yeah, I just realized now this is gonna be

294
00:11:57,576 --> 00:11:59,756
one of the episodes where I don't think

295
00:11:59,756 --> 00:12:00,916
I have much criticism.

296
00:12:01,776 --> 00:12:02,356
This is one of those.

297
00:12:02,376 --> 00:12:03,796
Yeah, I was thinking that.

298
00:12:03,896 --> 00:12:07,396
There's not a lot of crapping on the thing,

299
00:12:07,596 --> 00:12:09,736
meat on the bone, which we can do sometimes.

300
00:12:09,796 --> 00:12:13,316
But I think sheer praise is nice too.

301
00:12:13,376 --> 00:12:13,876
Yeah.

302
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:15,016
I think it's one of those.

303
00:12:15,036 --> 00:12:17,856
The level of detail, there's so much to talk about.

304
00:12:18,116 --> 00:12:18,136
Obviously.

305
00:12:18,716 --> 00:12:19,876
And we've just been crapping.

306
00:12:19,876 --> 00:12:22,496
We spent the earlier part of the day crapping on it.

307
00:12:22,496 --> 00:12:23,716
I got shrunk the audience.

308
00:12:24,336 --> 00:12:27,516
We gotta get positive, y'all.

309
00:12:28,156 --> 00:12:29,856
Obviously we'll talk about the Yeti in a little bit,

310
00:12:29,856 --> 00:12:31,076
but that's fine.

311
00:12:31,776 --> 00:12:33,636
But yeah, as far as the ride,

312
00:12:33,896 --> 00:12:38,496
it is like, it's one of those Disney rides, I think,

313
00:12:38,736 --> 00:12:42,696
where it'll be up in 30 years and a kid will go

314
00:12:42,696 --> 00:12:44,256
and assume it was built at the start.

315
00:12:44,556 --> 00:12:46,296
They won't know when it was built.

316
00:12:46,716 --> 00:12:47,476
It feels very tiny.

317
00:12:47,596 --> 00:12:48,756
Big Thunder, when I was a kid,

318
00:12:48,756 --> 00:12:50,336
I didn't realize Big Thunder hadn't been there

319
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:51,396
the whole time.

320
00:12:51,496 --> 00:12:51,876
Yeah.

321
00:12:51,976 --> 00:12:53,756
Feels like it always should have been there.

322
00:12:54,176 --> 00:12:56,896
It'd be an important part of the fabric of the.

323
00:12:56,916 --> 00:12:59,716
Right, even like Star Tours, I don't think I vocalized it,

324
00:12:59,716 --> 00:13:02,356
but I knew that was, obviously that wasn't there

325
00:13:02,356 --> 00:13:03,456
since it opened.

326
00:13:03,676 --> 00:13:04,116
I knew that.

327
00:13:04,136 --> 00:13:06,396
Well, it's like aesthetically different.

328
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:08,456
Nothing else in Disneyland is like that.

329
00:13:08,456 --> 00:13:10,436
It's a movie and it's more angular.

330
00:13:10,436 --> 00:13:10,836
Right.

331
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:12,476
It just feels modern.

332
00:13:12,936 --> 00:13:15,056
But Big Thunder, yeah, it absolutely feels like

333
00:13:15,056 --> 00:13:17,056
it could have been, I think the mountains in general

334
00:13:17,056 --> 00:13:19,096
need to feel like they were always there.

335
00:13:19,596 --> 00:13:19,816
Yes.

336
00:13:19,816 --> 00:13:21,896
But even like Splash Mountain, I think I had an idea

337
00:13:21,896 --> 00:13:23,056
that that was newer.

338
00:13:23,376 --> 00:13:24,756
But yeah, but I feel like Everest,

339
00:13:24,836 --> 00:13:26,976
if I was a kid and 30 years going on it,

340
00:13:26,976 --> 00:13:28,396
I'd be like, oh, this was here.

341
00:13:28,896 --> 00:13:29,736
Like, I wouldn't know.

342
00:13:29,896 --> 00:13:32,776
I think that's always cool to feel like something

343
00:13:32,776 --> 00:13:34,856
that truly feels like very timeless in the park.

344
00:13:35,396 --> 00:13:39,556
And I think another neat aspect of it is that it feels like

345
00:13:39,556 --> 00:13:45,636
this 10 times plused up version of the Matterhorn.

346
00:13:46,296 --> 00:13:49,616
It all is rooted in the Matterhorn

347
00:13:49,616 --> 00:13:52,996
and it feels like a tribute to it in a way.

348
00:13:53,036 --> 00:13:55,116
And then we took this and took it to this level.

349
00:13:55,556 --> 00:13:58,516
Because there was always question of when is the Matterhorn

350
00:13:58,516 --> 00:14:00,416
ever gonna come to Disney World?

351
00:14:00,716 --> 00:14:03,476
And there was talk of it going into a Swiss pavilion

352
00:14:03,476 --> 00:14:06,756
in Epcot and it never came to pass.

353
00:14:07,016 --> 00:14:08,016
And then this felt like,

354
00:14:08,036 --> 00:14:09,596
I remember even the first time I heard about it,

355
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:12,036
it was even framed maybe a little more as like,

356
00:14:12,876 --> 00:14:14,536
it's kind of an amended,

357
00:14:15,016 --> 00:14:17,316
it's the Disney World version of the Matterhorn.

358
00:14:17,396 --> 00:14:19,576
It's obviously so much more than that.

359
00:14:20,136 --> 00:14:20,976
But it's sort of, I don't know,

360
00:14:20,976 --> 00:14:22,576
it feels like a nice tribute

361
00:14:22,576 --> 00:14:27,356
to this very foundational ride in the park's history.

362
00:14:27,536 --> 00:14:28,456
Yeah, for sure.

363
00:14:29,296 --> 00:14:30,856
And yeah, the Matterhorn, of course,

364
00:14:31,396 --> 00:14:33,056
we did an episode on that, of course.

365
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:35,496
But that ride system makes the ride feel dated.

366
00:14:35,676 --> 00:14:37,096
Even though some of the effects are new,

367
00:14:37,276 --> 00:14:39,716
just for whatever, that ride system still makes it,

368
00:14:39,716 --> 00:14:41,076
you go, this shouldn't hurt this much.

369
00:14:41,316 --> 00:14:43,476
Because it was just banged together

370
00:14:43,476 --> 00:14:45,696
by a bunch of grumpy guys in the 50s.

371
00:14:45,716 --> 00:14:46,416
They did their best.

372
00:14:46,696 --> 00:14:47,816
Yeah, a bunch of guys, they were all building

373
00:14:47,816 --> 00:14:51,776
World War II planes and they're making a roller coaster.

374
00:14:52,116 --> 00:14:56,196
But this is top tier technology

375
00:14:56,196 --> 00:15:00,056
and stuff that no ride in the Disney park ecosystem

376
00:15:00,056 --> 00:15:01,056
had ever done.

377
00:15:01,396 --> 00:15:03,296
Never before this a Disney ride

378
00:15:03,296 --> 00:15:07,516
that goes forward and backward, I believe.

379
00:15:07,556 --> 00:15:09,976
Unless there's the Indiana Jones thing in Paris.

380
00:15:10,236 --> 00:15:13,016
The small Indiana Jones coaster in Paris

381
00:15:14,016 --> 00:15:18,076
briefly ran backwards for a short period of time.

382
00:15:18,296 --> 00:15:21,676
But this runs forwards and backwards on the same ride

383
00:15:21,676 --> 00:15:24,136
in the same experience.

384
00:15:24,356 --> 00:15:24,716
And that was what set it.

385
00:15:24,716 --> 00:15:27,316
I think we all watched this Travel Channel special

386
00:15:27,316 --> 00:15:31,636
where we learned about the peace that makes this possible.

387
00:15:31,776 --> 00:15:35,976
That it's this hulking, very special part.

388
00:15:36,796 --> 00:15:39,376
So the point that we were talking about

389
00:15:39,376 --> 00:15:42,456
where you can see all of the Swampland,

390
00:15:42,456 --> 00:15:45,916
it rises to, your car rises to this apex,

391
00:15:46,456 --> 00:15:48,656
sits up there for what feels like a while

392
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:52,076
and then comes back down the other way and goes backwards.

393
00:15:52,736 --> 00:15:55,756
By the time you pass it, it has six seconds

394
00:15:55,756 --> 00:15:58,296
for this hulking piece.

395
00:15:58,876 --> 00:16:01,016
It's 200,000 pounds.

396
00:16:01,056 --> 00:16:04,656
A 200,000 pound piece has to flip over

397
00:16:04,656 --> 00:16:09,256
and turn around so that when you come back down,

398
00:16:09,256 --> 00:16:10,596
you go down a different track.

399
00:16:10,656 --> 00:16:13,176
Yeah, like a train when it switches tracks.

400
00:16:13,296 --> 00:16:16,836
It's a full big mechanism that has to arrange.

401
00:16:17,156 --> 00:16:19,656
So another thing, also as far as the weight is concerned,

402
00:16:20,216 --> 00:16:22,476
one or two of the times that I did it,

403
00:16:22,576 --> 00:16:24,956
that up at the top when you're stuck at the top,

404
00:16:24,956 --> 00:16:28,416
that can pause for a long time.

405
00:16:28,676 --> 00:16:31,516
Because if something, if a car is taking a while to load

406
00:16:31,516 --> 00:16:33,436
or something, like any variable there.

407
00:16:33,876 --> 00:16:36,556
So we were up there for like a minute.

408
00:16:36,896 --> 00:16:37,336
Really?

409
00:16:37,696 --> 00:16:38,776
Like a long time.

410
00:16:39,276 --> 00:16:41,876
It feels, I mean, even when you're up there

411
00:16:41,876 --> 00:16:44,356
just for the set amount of time, it feels long.

412
00:16:44,436 --> 00:16:48,076
We're talking about like, at one point in this ride,

413
00:16:48,316 --> 00:16:49,756
you are riding through the mountains

414
00:16:49,756 --> 00:16:51,696
and you come to a point where the tracks

415
00:16:51,696 --> 00:16:53,156
are like turned upward.

416
00:16:53,256 --> 00:16:55,256
Like the Yeti has ripped them up

417
00:16:55,256 --> 00:16:58,916
and you are at the top of a hill looking down on stuff

418
00:16:58,916 --> 00:17:01,156
and you're just hanging there and it's shocking.

419
00:17:01,896 --> 00:17:04,276
Like your expectations for a roller coaster,

420
00:17:04,496 --> 00:17:06,616
like this is scary, this is shocking.

421
00:17:06,676 --> 00:17:07,796
There's no more track.

422
00:17:07,816 --> 00:17:10,116
I wish I could have a big pause like that.

423
00:17:10,116 --> 00:17:13,456
If that's so, it's a new beat in a roller coaster

424
00:17:13,456 --> 00:17:14,116
you'd never really see.

425
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:14,476
Absolutely.

426
00:17:14,576 --> 00:17:17,396
I wish I didn't know that when I went on the first time,

427
00:17:17,556 --> 00:17:19,476
but of course I had like seen videos of it,

428
00:17:19,476 --> 00:17:21,616
but that does seem like such a fun surprise.

429
00:17:21,756 --> 00:17:22,716
Well they were never hiding.

430
00:17:22,896 --> 00:17:24,596
I mean in the Travel Channel specials,

431
00:17:24,616 --> 00:17:26,596
it's in the opening credits.

432
00:17:27,336 --> 00:17:30,776
But it's still like insane to experience.

433
00:17:30,836 --> 00:17:34,116
And then that you go backwards and then forwards again,

434
00:17:34,156 --> 00:17:37,416
like you keep switching and you're in the light,

435
00:17:37,416 --> 00:17:38,436
you're in the dark.

436
00:17:39,236 --> 00:17:40,976
Yeah it has and I think I've,

437
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:41,816
I don't know if I've said this,

438
00:17:41,876 --> 00:17:43,016
I guess I've said this on the show.

439
00:17:43,256 --> 00:17:45,336
It feels like, I feel like any ride,

440
00:17:45,436 --> 00:17:47,416
I feel like it doesn't matter necessarily

441
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:50,136
about the length of the ride.

442
00:17:50,336 --> 00:17:53,856
But I feel like to have like a really satisfying experience,

443
00:17:53,916 --> 00:17:56,216
it has to have like three moves.

444
00:17:56,536 --> 00:17:59,536
It has to have like three nice parts or moves to it

445
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:01,596
to make it feel like it's a satisfying experience.

446
00:18:01,716 --> 00:18:02,656
Maybe the three is not the number.

447
00:18:02,756 --> 00:18:04,996
Maybe just it's different pieces

448
00:18:05,096 --> 00:18:08,376
that all feel like you've gotten a nice thing at the end.

449
00:18:08,836 --> 00:18:10,816
Maybe it's not even, can you make a list

450
00:18:10,816 --> 00:18:12,396
of like when this happened, this happened, this happened.

451
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:13,956
Yes, that's probably a better way to describe it.

452
00:18:15,276 --> 00:18:20,776
Like in Credit Coaster, it's launch, it's loop,

453
00:18:21,096 --> 00:18:23,716
it's in the really crazy drop in the middle.

454
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:26,076
Right, I think, and you had not been to Japan yet,

455
00:18:26,136 --> 00:18:28,256
I think I said something similar on the Japan episode

456
00:18:28,256 --> 00:18:29,876
about one of the rides and I said it was

457
00:18:29,876 --> 00:18:31,896
missing a big something.

458
00:18:32,056 --> 00:18:33,176
I don't know what that is.

459
00:18:33,256 --> 00:18:36,576
But it felt like another thing would have made me feel

460
00:18:36,576 --> 00:18:37,736
satisfied with it.

461
00:18:38,116 --> 00:18:41,456
So this is one of those rides where you have

462
00:18:41,456 --> 00:18:45,236
like such satisfying things and it changes it up.

463
00:18:45,596 --> 00:18:47,136
The first lift hill is so cool.

464
00:18:47,156 --> 00:18:49,756
The line, we'll talk about the line, the queue is awesome.

465
00:18:50,136 --> 00:18:52,736
And then there's just such a variation on what it does

466
00:18:52,736 --> 00:18:55,236
that even though the ride itself is actually pretty short,

467
00:18:55,256 --> 00:18:57,096
I think, or is it four minutes, what is it?

468
00:18:57,176 --> 00:18:59,476
I forget what the length is.

469
00:19:00,056 --> 00:19:03,156
But it does seem long as far as roller coasters go.

470
00:19:03,256 --> 00:19:07,316
It seems very long, but I don't think it's like super long

471
00:19:07,316 --> 00:19:10,316
and I think it's because like it's sad,

472
00:19:10,396 --> 00:19:12,416
like every piece is satisfying and then you feel

473
00:19:12,416 --> 00:19:14,756
like you've been, you've done, there's been moves.

474
00:19:14,756 --> 00:19:15,996
There's three moves on it.

475
00:19:15,996 --> 00:19:17,256
There's three, now you're backwards.

476
00:19:17,296 --> 00:19:18,936
Now it's this, now there's a big robot.

477
00:19:19,196 --> 00:19:21,196
Now like it just, all of it adds up.

478
00:19:21,356 --> 00:19:24,736
When you're also just exploring just crazy wilderness,

479
00:19:24,756 --> 00:19:28,896
it takes advantage of the undeveloped nature

480
00:19:28,896 --> 00:19:31,396
of a lot of the Disney World property

481
00:19:31,396 --> 00:19:34,236
and it reminds me of the Beast at Kings Island,

482
00:19:34,296 --> 00:19:35,736
which I've talked about where you're like,

483
00:19:35,896 --> 00:19:38,756
I feel like far away from the park.

484
00:19:38,956 --> 00:19:41,416
I'm just going around random trees

485
00:19:41,416 --> 00:19:43,736
and no civilization is around me.

486
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:46,716
The ride is two minutes, 50 seconds, not four minutes.

487
00:19:46,816 --> 00:19:49,916
It's so short, but it feels like such a long thing

488
00:19:49,916 --> 00:19:52,736
because of how many different things and like,

489
00:19:53,276 --> 00:19:54,856
your brain keeps getting stimulated

490
00:19:54,856 --> 00:19:56,376
and then by the end of it, whether it's two minutes

491
00:19:56,376 --> 00:19:58,916
or five minutes, if it feels like it's had enough fun stuff,

492
00:19:59,376 --> 00:20:00,816
it feels good, I think.

493
00:20:00,816 --> 00:20:02,656
It covers a lot of grounds too.

494
00:20:02,816 --> 00:20:05,236
It's the ultimate, I was also thinking about how

495
00:20:05,236 --> 00:20:06,656
compare this to Big Thunder Mountain,

496
00:20:06,716 --> 00:20:08,176
which we all obviously like a lot,

497
00:20:08,196 --> 00:20:13,056
but it's clearly in Disneyland or Space Mountain.

498
00:20:13,316 --> 00:20:16,356
The Disneyland roller coasters are all about,

499
00:20:16,656 --> 00:20:17,896
we don't have a lot of space,

500
00:20:17,976 --> 00:20:19,716
but we're gonna turn you every which way

501
00:20:19,716 --> 00:20:21,816
within this little piece of square footage.

502
00:20:22,176 --> 00:20:26,356
This thing is so big in its scope and wide

503
00:20:26,356 --> 00:20:27,956
and explores so much.

504
00:20:27,956 --> 00:20:31,096
It takes advantage of how much land there is

505
00:20:31,096 --> 00:20:32,796
at Disney World.

506
00:20:33,476 --> 00:20:36,576
Let's start in the queue, I guess, a little bit.

507
00:20:36,836 --> 00:20:37,376
I guess so.

508
00:20:37,396 --> 00:20:39,956
I mean, even leading up to the queue, yeah.

509
00:20:40,636 --> 00:20:44,516
Well, the Asia area section of the park is just,

510
00:20:44,736 --> 00:20:47,376
I mean, all of this park is so detailed

511
00:20:47,376 --> 00:20:49,476
and so thought out.

512
00:20:49,856 --> 00:20:51,696
What else is in Asia?

513
00:20:52,576 --> 00:20:54,216
What else is in Asia?

514
00:20:54,316 --> 00:20:56,016
I have a current park map,

515
00:20:56,016 --> 00:20:58,236
current-ish park map in front of me.

516
00:20:59,016 --> 00:21:03,496
Asia also has the Maharaja Jungle Trek.

517
00:21:03,696 --> 00:21:05,296
I think that's a walking tour.

518
00:21:06,256 --> 00:21:08,996
The Kali River Rapids is the other big attraction,

519
00:21:09,016 --> 00:21:12,136
and it's where the Rivers of Light show is now.

520
00:21:12,756 --> 00:21:15,096
Yakin Yeti, the restaurant is there.

521
00:21:15,196 --> 00:21:15,996
I still haven't eaten there,

522
00:21:15,996 --> 00:21:17,376
even though everyone says that's good.

523
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:19,716
Although Tiffins, I think people like better.

524
00:21:20,156 --> 00:21:20,596
Like better.

525
00:21:21,236 --> 00:21:24,116
Tiffins, I thought, was more by Pandora.

526
00:21:24,436 --> 00:21:25,116
Maybe you're right.

527
00:21:25,116 --> 00:21:25,776
I could be wrong.

528
00:21:26,356 --> 00:21:26,876
Yeah.

529
00:21:26,956 --> 00:21:29,276
What are the lands of Animal Kingdom at this point?

530
00:21:29,476 --> 00:21:30,296
Pandora?

531
00:21:30,636 --> 00:21:31,876
Pandora is what the world is about.

532
00:21:32,016 --> 00:21:33,716
Asia, Africa, Pandora.

533
00:21:34,076 --> 00:21:37,136
Yeah, Asia, Africa, Discovery Island.

534
00:21:37,376 --> 00:21:37,996
Dino Land USA.

535
00:21:37,996 --> 00:21:40,136
The Oasis, and yeah, Dino Land USA.

536
00:21:40,436 --> 00:21:42,516
You know, that actually counteracts one thought I had

537
00:21:42,516 --> 00:21:44,896
was that this is one of the parks in Florida,

538
00:21:45,376 --> 00:21:46,876
excuse me, at Disney World,

539
00:21:47,496 --> 00:21:51,936
that doesn't have, for lack of a better term, America Town,

540
00:21:51,996 --> 00:21:55,076
because the Magic Kingdom has Liberty Square,

541
00:21:55,296 --> 00:21:56,596
Epcot has America.

542
00:21:57,636 --> 00:22:00,236
Hollywood Studios is pretty much just about

543
00:22:00,236 --> 00:22:02,336
the history of American filmmaking.

544
00:22:02,336 --> 00:22:04,496
It's all lip tributes to different parts of LA.

545
00:22:04,956 --> 00:22:05,736
Different parts of LA.

546
00:22:05,816 --> 00:22:08,556
Yeah, there's not a lot of French New Wave

547
00:22:08,556 --> 00:22:10,056
in that film park,

548
00:22:10,316 --> 00:22:13,536
but I guess Dino Land USA is kind of America?

549
00:22:13,856 --> 00:22:15,056
It doesn't quite know.

550
00:22:15,156 --> 00:22:17,216
There was like Camp Mini Mickey before,

551
00:22:17,396 --> 00:22:21,236
which is what Pandora replaced, which that's something.

552
00:22:21,236 --> 00:22:24,716
They really should do a Griffith Park section

553
00:22:24,716 --> 00:22:28,276
for Animal Kingdom or a Runyon Canyon ride.

554
00:22:28,316 --> 00:22:30,096
Just because you need the LA.

555
00:22:30,176 --> 00:22:31,036
Yeah, an LA specific.

556
00:22:31,036 --> 00:22:33,696
I need as many LA references as possible.

557
00:22:33,716 --> 00:22:36,216
The Greek theater show building,

558
00:22:36,296 --> 00:22:38,096
like you could have a show in the,

559
00:22:38,096 --> 00:22:40,276
made like the fake Greek theater at Animal Kingdom.

560
00:22:40,416 --> 00:22:44,116
I was thinking how the Grizzly Peak

561
00:22:44,116 --> 00:22:47,976
is sort of a nod to Big Bear, really.

562
00:22:48,536 --> 00:22:48,556
Uh-huh.

563
00:22:48,756 --> 00:22:52,076
The Grizzly Peak recreation area

564
00:22:52,076 --> 00:22:53,836
when you see signage about that.

565
00:22:54,136 --> 00:22:54,756
So that's a little,

566
00:22:54,916 --> 00:22:56,856
but I guess California Adventure entirely

567
00:22:56,856 --> 00:22:59,556
is a little California nod.

568
00:22:59,696 --> 00:23:01,896
Disney parks love California.

569
00:23:02,596 --> 00:23:02,856
Yeah.

570
00:23:02,856 --> 00:23:03,736
It's got more California.

571
00:23:03,736 --> 00:23:04,836
You think they were designed

572
00:23:04,836 --> 00:23:07,436
10 minutes down the road or something.

573
00:23:07,796 --> 00:23:08,436
Oh yeah.

574
00:23:08,956 --> 00:23:12,416
But not that here you traverse the jungles of Asia.

575
00:23:13,396 --> 00:23:14,576
And yeah. Yes.

576
00:23:14,836 --> 00:23:18,236
So, well see I don't know much about the line

577
00:23:18,236 --> 00:23:19,976
because I haven't done it.

578
00:23:20,256 --> 00:23:22,076
It's pretty boring to watch a video of a look.

579
00:23:22,076 --> 00:23:24,976
God bless these theme park archivists on YouTube

580
00:23:24,976 --> 00:23:27,536
who cover every nook and cranny of all these places.

581
00:23:27,556 --> 00:23:29,536
But I'm not gonna sit and watch a video of the line.

582
00:23:29,896 --> 00:23:33,536
Well it's themed to like you are traveling

583
00:23:33,536 --> 00:23:34,936
to the Himalayas.

584
00:23:35,096 --> 00:23:36,516
And of course the Himalayan Mountains

585
00:23:36,516 --> 00:23:39,636
touch upon five countries in the world.

586
00:23:40,476 --> 00:23:41,096
I have it right here. Go ahead.

587
00:23:41,236 --> 00:23:42,036
Of course.

588
00:23:42,576 --> 00:23:44,016
The thing that you wrote down.

589
00:23:45,216 --> 00:23:46,076
Come on Jason.

590
00:23:46,076 --> 00:23:46,736
Oh my God.

591
00:23:46,816 --> 00:23:48,036
Time is of the essence.

592
00:23:48,336 --> 00:23:51,216
Nepal, India, Bhutan, China, and Pakistan.

593
00:23:51,516 --> 00:23:52,936
They're a very long stretch.

594
00:23:52,936 --> 00:23:53,716
Very good.

595
00:23:53,716 --> 00:23:58,536
And include of course the famous Everest among them.

596
00:23:59,176 --> 00:24:00,836
But then there's this weird thing

597
00:24:00,836 --> 00:24:05,616
that the ride is not meant to be on Everest itself.

598
00:24:05,736 --> 00:24:07,556
No, you are in the Forbidden Mountains.

599
00:24:08,516 --> 00:24:09,056
And we should.

600
00:24:09,336 --> 00:24:10,996
And technically the name of the ride

601
00:24:10,996 --> 00:24:14,276
is Expedition Everest Legend of the Forbidden Mountain.

602
00:24:14,476 --> 00:24:15,096
Right. Yeah.

603
00:24:15,096 --> 00:24:17,636
Because you need these things to be as long as possible.

604
00:24:17,636 --> 00:24:20,136
Which is interesting because that is like a,

605
00:24:20,136 --> 00:24:22,656
this is a Joe Roady ride.

606
00:24:22,676 --> 00:24:23,016
Yes.

607
00:24:23,216 --> 00:24:25,936
Imagine Joe Roady and then he was behind

608
00:24:25,936 --> 00:24:28,276
Guardians of the Galaxy which also is a long title.

609
00:24:28,656 --> 00:24:28,936
Guardians of the Galaxy.

610
00:24:28,936 --> 00:24:29,356
Oh yeah.

611
00:24:29,356 --> 00:24:31,116
It's got sort of an aftermath.

612
00:24:31,116 --> 00:24:33,756
I do wonder maybe if that's his.

613
00:24:34,296 --> 00:24:35,036
We'll ask him.

614
00:24:35,116 --> 00:24:36,196
We have to have him on.

615
00:24:36,476 --> 00:24:39,976
Come hell or high water we will have Joe Roady on the show.

616
00:24:40,436 --> 00:24:42,176
So does he like a long title

617
00:24:42,176 --> 00:24:43,536
will be one of the first questions.

618
00:24:43,616 --> 00:24:44,596
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

619
00:24:44,596 --> 00:24:47,556
That's actually an interesting thought to bring up.

620
00:24:47,876 --> 00:24:49,696
Although another Roady thing,

621
00:24:49,956 --> 00:24:52,116
we have talked before about how his rides

622
00:24:52,116 --> 00:24:53,376
tend to have a lot of plot.

623
00:24:53,516 --> 00:24:54,336
This does not.

624
00:24:54,516 --> 00:24:55,476
This is very simple, yeah.

625
00:24:55,496 --> 00:24:58,496
It's very simple and is more world building.

626
00:24:58,616 --> 00:25:03,116
So you're going through the office of a company

627
00:25:03,116 --> 00:25:07,536
that does tours of these mountains and a Yeti museum.

628
00:25:08,356 --> 00:25:10,516
Yeah, so here's, this is what I wanna say about,

629
00:25:10,516 --> 00:25:11,216
actually about the line.

630
00:25:11,216 --> 00:25:13,436
I'm not gonna describe this tons and tons of cool.

631
00:25:14,316 --> 00:25:15,116
A thousand artifacts.

632
00:25:15,676 --> 00:25:17,536
They're all real things they went and found.

633
00:25:17,756 --> 00:25:18,996
They did trips to Nepal.

634
00:25:19,436 --> 00:25:20,716
That they bought from people.

635
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:22,376
Right, they said they would go

636
00:25:22,376 --> 00:25:24,916
and they would clear out like little marketplaces

637
00:25:24,916 --> 00:25:26,936
and be like, well, buy all these bowls or something.

638
00:25:27,016 --> 00:25:27,856
And people were like, oh, okay.

639
00:25:27,896 --> 00:25:30,116
And they just take all these bowls and then put them there.

640
00:25:30,496 --> 00:25:32,296
There was something interesting in that special tour

641
00:25:32,296 --> 00:25:34,636
where they were talking about how they would take stuff

642
00:25:34,636 --> 00:25:36,956
and then they'd have to make it look more beat up.

643
00:25:37,096 --> 00:25:40,476
So there was a way to make like, they almost felt bad

644
00:25:40,476 --> 00:25:41,776
because some of the things they would buy,

645
00:25:42,276 --> 00:25:44,316
it looked too nice because it was new.

646
00:25:44,456 --> 00:25:46,036
But they wanted to make it look more like,

647
00:25:46,236 --> 00:25:48,896
oh, they had found this and it was on a hillside

648
00:25:48,896 --> 00:25:49,776
for 60 years.

649
00:25:49,796 --> 00:25:52,176
So they'd have to like dirty up something or,

650
00:25:52,416 --> 00:25:54,096
that's very, we'll post a link to this thing.

651
00:25:54,356 --> 00:25:54,916
Sure, sure.

652
00:25:54,976 --> 00:25:59,476
Hey everybody, it's Scott here.

653
00:25:59,636 --> 00:26:02,496
We talk a lot about treats on this show.

654
00:26:02,536 --> 00:26:04,076
We love treats, we're treat boys.

655
00:26:04,356 --> 00:26:05,956
But sometimes even the treat boys

656
00:26:05,956 --> 00:26:08,276
don't wanna schlep all the way to a theme park

657
00:26:08,276 --> 00:26:10,556
just to get the treats that we crave.

658
00:26:10,556 --> 00:26:13,756
And sometimes we want treats that are healthy and homemade.

659
00:26:13,956 --> 00:26:16,616
And that's why I'm excited about HelloFresh.

660
00:26:16,896 --> 00:26:19,296
It's a meal kit delivery service that shops, plans,

661
00:26:19,376 --> 00:26:21,136
and delivers step-by-step recipes

662
00:26:21,136 --> 00:26:22,916
and pre-measured ingredients

663
00:26:22,916 --> 00:26:25,296
so you can just cook, eat, and enjoy.

664
00:26:25,396 --> 00:26:28,156
I had a HelloFresh delivery this week and it was a blast.

665
00:26:28,296 --> 00:26:31,096
I had Presto Pesto Panko Chicken.

666
00:26:31,456 --> 00:26:35,456
I had Beef Bibimbap and I had sweet and smoky pork chops.

667
00:26:35,516 --> 00:26:37,816
I like that they spell it with the N and the apostrophe.

668
00:26:37,896 --> 00:26:39,776
It's like Chippendale Rescue Rangers.

669
00:26:39,776 --> 00:26:40,756
I like that combo.

670
00:26:41,056 --> 00:26:43,836
But what I like more is that it was delicious.

671
00:26:43,876 --> 00:26:45,676
And they help you through every step of the way.

672
00:26:45,716 --> 00:26:46,956
They make it so easy on ya.

673
00:26:47,076 --> 00:26:49,096
It's enjoyable, it's easy.

674
00:26:49,376 --> 00:26:51,436
It's food delivered straight to your door every week

675
00:26:51,436 --> 00:26:53,556

00:26:53,556 --> 00:26:55,196
to your New Year's goals.

677
00:26:55,456 --> 00:26:58,356
You can branch out, you can get out of your recipe rut

678
00:26:58,356 --> 00:27:00,876
and cook outside of your comfort zone

679
00:27:00,876 --> 00:27:03,816
by discovering new delicious recipes.

680
00:27:03,856 --> 00:27:04,896
So if you wanna do all that,

681
00:27:04,916 --> 00:27:06,936

It's easy to remember.

687
00:27:19,036 --> 00:27:21,016
It's my favorite thing and my favorite decade.

688
00:27:21,456 --> 00:27:23,876

690
00:27:25,816 --> 00:27:27,376
HelloFresh, that's all.

691
00:27:27,396 --> 00:27:29,036
Let's go back to talking about fake rocks.

692
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,480
So the first time I had been on it,

693
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:35,820
Lindsay and I were going through the main queue

694
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,940
and we're looking at all this stuff

695
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:43,440
and up until the fake newspaper clippings about the Yeti,

696
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:45,100
I went, oh, is all this stuff real?

697
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:47,000
Are these articles real?

698
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:52,420
Like, it does a really good job of easing you into the fakes.

699
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,720
Yeah, K-Fake, there you go.

700
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:55,960
So we're looking and I'm like, oh wow,

701
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,440
there's all these expeditions, huh?

702
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:00,220
So these explorers, they were never found again.

703
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,020
That's interesting.

704
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:04,220
Like I truly like, it makes me sound like probably an idiot

705
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:05,720
because you'd probably look at it again and go,

706
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:07,300
oh, that's, look at it,

707
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,480
it looks like one of those old Wests like photo,

708
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,240
like it looks like a fake thing you'd find

709
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,960
at a fair or something newspaper.

710
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,460
But like for a couple rooms, we're like,

711
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,400
oh, this is interesting.

712
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,860
Like, I never heard about this before.

713
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:22,500
That's the written kind of hidden story

714
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,020
of like the lost expedition.

715
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:25,820
Yeah, and then like there's an article,

716
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:27,160
another one was like Yeti attacks.

717
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,720
And I'm like, oh, okay, got it.

718
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,580
I'm an idiot, I'm an idiot, got it.

719
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,880
But it's so good, like it's such,

720
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,840
cause I guess it feels authentic

721
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,600
because of all the artifacts they've got

722
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,520
and all the different things they bought that.

723
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:41,860
Well, okay, so I mean, maybe we should talk about Rody

724
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:44,980
a little bit in general because he like clearly

725
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:47,320
is the guy driving the ship for these

726
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:52,520
like incredibly detailed, world traveling kind of rides

727
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,380
because Rody gets a lot of credit.

728
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,660
I mean, what is he, I don't, I never know the positions,

729
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,960
but he's sort of, you sort of attribute

730
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,100
all of Animal Kingdom to him on some level.

731
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,720
Yeah, he was the lead designer of this attraction

732
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,980
and I think Animal Kingdom at large.

733
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:06,380
Right, I believe so, yeah.

734
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:07,780
And then Pandora.

735
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:11,340
So like, I do feel like with Rody,

736
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:15,140
more than other cases, like other than

737
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:19,320
original Walt Disney Disneyland and Hard Rock Park

738
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,820
with, what's his name?

739
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:22,220
Big John Binkowski. Binkowski.

740
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:23,060
Binkowski. A boy.

741
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:26,560
This is, it's sort of an auteur park in a way.

742
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,680
And no park obviously can be made

743
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,340
or single-handed, because I'm not one for it.

744
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,600
But you, and he, yeah, I'm sure he would say

745
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,760
all of the hundreds of people.

746
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:33,980
Right.

747
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:36,980
But like, I don't know, he does seem

748
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:39,040
like such a major driving force behind.

749
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:42,100
And where it's like, and if you follow him on Instagram,

750
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:46,160
he is very much a world traveler and very detail-oriented

751
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,520
and you just, I just, I don't know.

752
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:48,940
It's hard.

753
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:51,180
He clearly is bringing so much of himself to.

754
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:53,700
Yeah, it's hard not to, yeah, if you just like

755
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:56,100
have a light understanding of him

756
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:59,020
or have looked at a few posts on Instagram

757
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:00,740
or seen a few interviews with him,

758
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:03,160
it's hard not to see him all over this place.

759
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:04,140
Like it's hard. Yeah.

760
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:07,200
And by the way, just to say, if you don't know

761
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,080
who we're talking about and you're vaguely familiar

762
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:11,560
with behind the scenes videos or park specials,

763
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,860
it's the guy with the earring.

764
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:13,760
Yeah, he's got the earring.

765
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:14,620
And then most people have got it.

766
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:15,500
You've seen him, you know him.

767
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:16,320
Yes. Yeah.

768
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,000
But yeah, I mean, it almost feels like,

769
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,420
I mean, obviously we've talked about

770
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:22,500
a lot of famous Imagineers, but it does feel like

771
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:25,460
now his footprint, because it's a whole park

772
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,840
that you sort of associate with his aesthetic.

773
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:29,700
So like, I don't know, is there any other than

774
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:31,100
Walt Disney himself?

775
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:31,580
Yeah.

776
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,420
Other Disney park where you're like.

777
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:35,460
Tony Baxter in Paris, maybe?

778
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,920
To some extent. Yeah, to some extent,

779
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,940
but it's still like Walt's, the original.

780
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:41,540
At Shubberyland is very Tony.

781
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:42,280
Yes.

782
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:44,000
Yeah, but it's just a land.

783
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:44,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

784
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:45,680
So it's interesting.

785
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:47,280
I wonder how he feels about that,

786
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:49,680
because it does like his, he has a part kind of,

787
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,980
like his voice is one of the parks.

788
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

789
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:56,720
Also gonna say, I found out a bunch of crazy

790
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,680
Rhodey stuff.

791
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:01,840
So this I knew, and I've interacted with him on Twitter

792
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:06,300
because of this, Joe Rhodey went to my high school.

793
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:10,860
He went to Chaminade, which is in West Hills, California.

794
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:16,040
By the way, the alumni list of this high school,

795
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:18,720
very strange, I mean, my favorite ones,

796
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:21,480
Rhodey and David Page from Toto,

797
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,020
who wrote two of my favorite songs,

798
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:25,840
Africa and Human Nature by Michael Jackson.

799
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:30,560
Also, didn't know this one, Dean Ween from Ween

800
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,620
went to Chaminade. Whoa.

801
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:32,240
Wow.

802
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:34,860
And wait, who else on the list?

803
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:38,040
I mean, several of the kids from Seventh Heaven

804
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,460
who were there when I went there,

805
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:43,180
and Jonathan Taylor Thomas went there when I went there.

806
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,560
One that I didn't know about, Linda Hogan.

807
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:49,380
Yeah, weird, right?

808
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:50,720
Hogan's ex-wife. Yes.

809
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,620
Linda Hogan.

810
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:52,940
Wow. That's crazy.

811
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,740
Star of Hogan Knows Best went to Chaminade

812
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:59,440
and an old Sky Gardener as well.

813
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:02,220
But I didn't, so I just thought that was cool.

814
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,960
And I think I learned he went there

815
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:08,700
because of an alumni magazine that I am forced to receive.

816
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:11,300
I don't think I have a way to not receive it.

817
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:17,200
I didn't know that his Disney story totally stems

818
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,240
from my high school Chaminade,

819
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:25,900
which is that he graduated Chaminade, went to Occidental

820
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:28,740
right before Barack Obama went there,

821
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:33,660
graduated from there, started working back at Chaminade

822
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:38,340
as a doing theatrical set design for the theater program,

823
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:41,840
which I participated in many decades later.

824
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:47,300
And so he's like doing sets for the plays,

825
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:49,640
and the sets for the plays are better

826
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,260
than they have any right to be.

827
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:54,760
They're just oddly complicated and very well done.

828
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:59,680
And he said the theater department at the time

829
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:00,640
didn't have very big budgets.

830
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,840
We made these rather impressive, elaborate productions

831
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:05,400
in terms of set and costume design.

832
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:11,740
And one of Rhodey's students, his father was John Zovich,

833
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:16,460
who was the vice president of engineering for Imagineering.

834
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:19,640
So he goes to see one of his kids' plays,

835
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,940
goes, what's going on with the sets?

836
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:24,740
Is super impressed, finds Rhodey, talks to him,

837
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:26,740
goes into Rhodey's office and says,

838
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,640
you're wasting your time here, kid.

839
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:31,200
You should be working for Walt Disney Imagineering.

840
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:36,760
And Rhodey's reaction, because he, by his own admission,

841
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:40,880
is like, I'm like a free spirit hippie world traveler guy.

842
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,840
Like Disney would hate a guy like me.

843
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:45,200
He takes the job and he is wrong.

844
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,880
They love what he's doing.

845
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:50,240
He's able to totally put his personality into everything.

846
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:53,060
And he's like a rising star there very quickly.

847
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:56,680
So had he not made crazy sets for my high school,

848
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,120
I don't know if it was in the same facility,

849
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:02,800
the Bob Hope Center where I, and he,

850
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,220
not an alum, Bob Hope.

851
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,500
No, no, no, Bob Hope Center.

852
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,000
I don't know why something's named after him.

853
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,940
Maybe he drove by the school once or something.

854
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:09,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah, close enough.

855
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,220
He woke up on the lawn once.

856
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,420
All right, rough night.

857
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:17,240
So anyway, he's like right out of the gate,

858
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,660
kind of like a valued imagineer.

859
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:22,860
First thing he did, there was tons to do at Epcot.

860
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:26,020
So he was a scenic painter for the Mexico Pavilion,

861
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:28,260
which, think about that painting in there.

862
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,460
Yeah, yeah, all these murals.

863
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:31,620
I don't know what he did exactly,

864
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:33,400
but yeah, murals are great.

865
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,980
That boat ride we love.

866
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:37,460
Worked on the refurbishment of Fantasyland.

867
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:40,480
Did concept art for Captain EO.

868
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:42,320
Worked on the Norway Pavilion.

869
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,560
And then eventually building up to working,

870
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,720
is he like the main guy on the Adventurers Club?

871
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:51,940
The beloved, now lost Pleasure Island attraction?

872
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:53,180
I believe that is right.

873
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:54,980
Was one of the main guys.

874
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:56,000
It was hard to find.

875
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:58,320
Pleasure Island stuff not cataloged as well.

876
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:00,760
We were saying the plaques and stuff

877
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:04,420
throughout Pleasure Island has a very roadie kind of vibe.

878
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:06,120
He loves his backstory.

879
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:07,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

880
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,240
Olani, I believe is also.

881
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,060
Yeah, that's him, yeah, for sure.

882
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:11,360
He was in charge of it too.

883
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:17,900
So I guess, and I might be wrong about specifics here,

884
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:22,940
but I think that in 84, Eisner has taken over

885
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:25,440
and he needs to pitch the Adventurers Club,

886
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:26,240
or maybe it's something else,

887
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,600
but I think it's the Adventurers Club, to Eisner.

888
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:33,400
And he comes into the pitch with an actual Bengal tiger.

889
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,160
And Eisner's like, wow, this guy.

890
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,680
He's got panache.

891
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:40,980
He's exciting.

892
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:44,520
So he gets on Eisner's radar pretty quickly

893
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:47,660
and they're talking about what is the ultimate thing

894
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:48,440
you would wanna do.

895
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:49,900
And I think that was Animal Kingdom.

896
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:51,340
Because it was like a trick.

897
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:54,000
Yeah, I was gonna say that's a real power move

898
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,240
and would come back later

899
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,780
when they were doing The Lion King

900
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:59,480
and they would always show the behind the scenes animator

901
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:02,160
sketching a lion just in a conference room.

902
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:04,520
Yeah, that footage is crazy.

903
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:08,160
I remember taking the tour of the animation studio

904
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:13,180
and it would have been Christmas 92 or 93,

905
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:14,600
I forget when, but I remember them saying.

906
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:16,740
And next week it's very exciting

907
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:18,980
because we have some real jungle animals coming in

908
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:20,380
and the animators are gonna draw them.

909
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,780
And I remember thinking, what's that gonna be for?

910
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:25,200
And there you go, clearly Lion King.

911
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,680
I think it was like, didn't he say something

912
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:30,180
like the biggest, that's the biggest thrill

913
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:31,020
is seeing an animal?

914
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,640
There was something along the lines of

915
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,500
he wanted to impress upon Michael Eisner

916
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,560
that this is as good as a ride

917
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,340
is seeing this thing up close.

918
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:39,500
Oh, gotcha.

919
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:41,080
This could be from a different meeting

920
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:43,380
or a different thing I'm misremembering.

921
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:45,580
Because that's another thing you appreciate

922
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:47,680
with Animal Kingdom when you're older

923
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:50,720
is like how close you are.

924
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:55,280
Like a zoo has a lot of barriers between you and the animal

925
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,820
and they made an effort at Animal Kingdom

926
00:36:57,820 --> 00:37:02,720
to try and use bodies of water or natural like stuff

927
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:05,360
to make it feel like you are closer than you really are.

928
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,960
When we went on that safari the first time

929
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:10,560
a couple years ago, since I had been out in the late 90s,

930
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,120
I was like a little uncomfortable

931
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:13,740
by how close the animals were.

932
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:14,660
Yeah, sure.

933
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,140
They're like, oh God, this is.

934
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:18,540
What's the actual deal with that hotel

935
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:20,140
where they show you footage and it's like

936
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:21,840
a giraffe's gonna walk up to your room.

937
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,220
I don't know.

938
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:26,000
I don't know if that's true, if the giraffe really will like,

939
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:28,640
oh my, good morning Mr. Giraffe.

940
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,300
And he's up at your window.

941
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,260
I think there's still.

942
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:32,680
He knocks on the window to wake you up

943
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:35,860
and he pulls like the sun out with his teeth.

944
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:37,840
I haven't stayed there.

945
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:38,620
A cup of tea.

946
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:41,060
I think you're still pretty far away.

947
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:43,420
But it feels like you're a lot closer.

948
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,220
That hotel is amazing.

949
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:48,120
Wonderful restaurants, the design, incredible.

950
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,400
The main restaurant in there, yeah, is insanely good.

951
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,960
This is a quick side note.

952
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:57,660
I last night had a dream that I was price comparing hotels

953
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:58,780
for Disney World.

954
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:00,860
You were checking in your dream?

955
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,060
Jesus Christ.

956
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:03,340
This is not a lie.

957
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:04,280
I remember.

958
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,400
You weren't even there.

959
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,340
I remember figures too.

960
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,640
And you're not supposed to be able to read in your dream.

961
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:12,320
But I remember looking at a website

962
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:15,160
that's Yacht and Beach Club and it said like 7.25.

963
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,200
And I was like, too expensive.

964
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:19,460
And then I looked at Polynesian or something

965
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:20,840
and I saw like $300.

966
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,140
And I was like, oh, it's getting better.

967
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,720
So but I, as a very specific,

968
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:27,420
I woke up going, oh my God.

969
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:32,140
I'm thinking of the website to book Orlando hotels

970
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:33,520
in my dreams.

971
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:36,080
I want to help you George Washington.

972
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,980
Even your dreams are linked.

973
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:40,480
I wasn't even at the park.

974
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:41,840
It wasn't like, oh my gosh,

975
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,900
I'm at Disney World enjoying the rides.

976
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:47,260
I'm dreaming about booking.

977
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:49,880
The fact that you, well, cause you have,

978
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:54,180
you like, do you like booking for people from afar?

979
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:54,720
I do, yeah.

980
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,400
You've given them tips and that's one of the-

981
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:00,180
And then now to know that it's in your dreams.

982
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:03,000
I have never, I don't remember lately,

983
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,260
at least most of my dreams.

984
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:06,440
I don't have vivid dreams very often.

985
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:08,860
I usually forget them by the time I'm up.

986
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:10,660
Not this one.

987
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:14,500
I woke up and had, I have such a clear memory

988
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:19,240
of this like facsimile website that my brain constructed

989
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:22,260
in my head right now with the number 7.25

990
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:26,380
and then the Polynesian website with 300.

991
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:28,680
I remember it so clear, it's as if it was real.

992
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:31,380
And these numbers are, how accurate are these numbers?

993
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:33,860
Not accurate, the numbers are not, it would be better if-

994
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:34,980
What a wild dream.

995
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:36,100
Not so far off.

996
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:38,060
Not far off for the Polynesian.

997
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:39,120
That's a, that is a deal.

998
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,720
Yachton Beach Club is not 7.25.

999
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,740
Unless there's a suites.

1000
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:43,620
Possibly.

1001
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:44,820
You could have been looking at suites.

1002
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:47,560
In my brain I could have been examining the suites

1003
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:49,020
at the Yachton Beach Club and maybe, yeah,

1004
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:50,900
if they were, it was like a big family suite,

1005
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,860
it could be 7.25, so who knows?

1006
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:55,380
So when you die, your heaven is a world

1007
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:58,160
where you can sit at the right hand of God

1008
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,920
and be his personal checker.

1009
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:02,000
With a MacBook Pro, yeah.

1010
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:03,180
Find me a-

1011
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:05,520
Not even a cloud-shaped computer.

1012
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,940
Not a fancy heaven thing.

1013
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:08,900
No, like a 2018 MacBook.

1014
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:09,340
How much?

1015
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:12,520
It's an 18 inch, it's pretty light, you'll find.

1016
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:16,820
Please, find me a good deal for the Caribbean beach.

1017
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:19,980
Recently refurbished, Michael.

1018
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:22,380
Please give me a lagoon view.

1019
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:24,020
No.

1020
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:26,060
Some, I have some roadie stuff.

1021
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:29,220
So roadie, the theatrical background

1022
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:33,580
adds to one of my memories, and Mike, correct me if I,

1023
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,480
if this is someone else, please correct me.

1024
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:35,800
Sure.

1025
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:40,480
Isn't there a video of roadie playing the Dream Finder?

1026
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:41,580
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

1027
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:44,120
There's a video of him in the full Dream Finder,

1028
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:46,560
get up, like talking to you, and he's so anime.

1029
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:49,840
He's a very engaging speaker, but he's fully committed

1030
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,480
to the character of the Dream Finder,

1031
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:54,620
so that he has a theatrical background makes a lot of sense.

1032
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:56,360
Yeah, a lot of people, not a lot,

1033
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:58,500
but a handful of people in Imagineering,

1034
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,620
different people have played Dream Finder

1035
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:02,740
in different media.

1036
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,700
There was a walk around Dream Finder for a while,

1037
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,640
but then there's in different videos,

1038
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,320
and there's been multiple.

1039
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:15,000
Your next dream will be applying spirit gum to a beard

1040
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,400
and placing it on an Imagineer's face

1041
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,000
so he can play the Dream Finder.

1042
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:20,800
Yeah, I don't get to meet Dream Finder

1043
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,420
and fly with him in the flying machine.

1044
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:23,320
Figma's not real.

1045
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:23,760
No.

1046
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:26,500
You're helping somebody into a costume.

1047
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:26,940
It's a practical side.

1048
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:28,920
You did get into the makeup artist union,

1049
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,360
which is good, because they have good benefits.

1050
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,300
In my dream, I did.

1051
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:31,980
Yeah, in your dream.

1052
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:33,560
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, good for sort of a,

1053
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:34,940
it's a nice little mixer at the end of the year.

1054
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:38,100
Yeah, it's like I lived a whole lifetime in my head

1055
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:39,460
of going to makeup school.

1056
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:42,520
Yeah, and then you wake up feeling lost,

1057
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:44,500
because you're like, that is a life I'll never live.

1058
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:44,980
I'll never live, yeah.

1059
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,740
You never can go back to that life.

1060
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:47,280
Sure.

1061
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:51,280
Dream Finder is, if we really think of Dream Finder

1062
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:54,300
as much like Hamlet or Othello,

1063
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:56,920
like multiple actors have taken the role.

1064
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:58,040
Oh, and made it their own.

1065
00:41:58,060 --> 00:41:59,180
And it's the Joker now, of course,

1066
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:01,340
is the new version of this.

1067
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:03,260
And maybe, yeah, so many more,

1068
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:04,720
hopefully, people will get to play.

1069
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:06,680
Just jamming in another Joker reference.

1070
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:09,140
Well, Jason, you were right on the money.

1071
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,840
Well, yeah, look, the internet has been on fire

1072
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:14,600
with that Joker joke, they've just been hammering me with it.

1073
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:15,680
But he's talking about it.

1074
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:18,180
Everybody's lighting me up on social media.

1075
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:18,920
It's really hitting.

1076
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,640
That Mike is or likes the Joker.

1077
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:22,820
Is the Joker, I think?

1078
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:24,140
No, just likes it a lot.

1079
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:24,840
Oh, okay, just likes it a lot.

1080
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:27,760
No, like your dreams, you don't get to be anything exciting.

1081
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:31,300
You just get to be adjacent or trying to purchase it.

1082
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:34,100
So, hopefully, all three of us will get to play

1083
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:35,400
Dream Finder at certain points.

1084
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:35,980
Yeah.

1085
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:38,240
Well, we can, anytime we want.

1086
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:38,960
Anytime we want.

1087
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,780
Let's just do it, it's not even due for the podcast.

1088
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:41,900
Next time we're hanging out,

1089
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:43,640
let's all be dressed like the Dream Finder.

1090
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:45,480
We'll go to a bar.

1091
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:47,400
Everyone will be buying us shots

1092
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,720
because they'll think we are so cool.

1093
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:52,180
Yeah, I think, yeah, maybe a Patreon exclusive

1094
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:54,440
is that we all do monologues as the Dream Finder.

1095
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,660
Which is our take on.

1096
00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:57,480
Yeah, what is the-

1097
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:59,180
The Dream Finder monologues?

1098
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:01,540
Yeah, you know, the Dream Finder monologues.

1099
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:04,820
Mine's gonna be a Tom Waits Dream Finder, I think.

1100
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,840
He's kind of a grittier Dream Finder.

1101
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:07,580
Oh, okay.

1102
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:10,280
What if we all didn't tell each other what we were writing?

1103
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:12,940
We all ended up writing gritty Dream Finder.

1104
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:15,580
It's like a very lazy movie.

1105
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:17,920
It's like how a lot of the superhero movies,

1106
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:20,700
like a lot of superhero comics in the 80s and 90s

1107
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:23,240
went through like this character but gritty

1108
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:26,240
and then it kind of 20 years later hit the movie versions

1109
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:29,180
and hopefully we're coming out of that.

1110
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:30,560
Mine's gonna rap.

1111
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:32,920
Oh, okay, you're going for a Hamilton.

1112
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:34,140
Yeah, yeah.

1113
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:35,280
Very, very good.

1114
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:35,860
Pretty edgy, huh?

1115
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:41,180
So the other roadie thing, I watched a walk through,

1116
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:44,940
there was a tour, I guess there was a limited time tour

1117
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:49,720
of Expedition Everest and sort of the surrounding areas

1118
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:55,240
in Animal Kingdom and a very interesting imagineer, Colleen.

1119
00:43:55,660 --> 00:43:57,820
I did, they said, I couldn't catch the last name

1120
00:43:57,820 --> 00:44:01,240
but she was the head of character paint for Imagineering

1121
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:03,320
which is not a term that I had heard before

1122
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:06,920
but character paint is using color to tell stories

1123
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:09,900
because they use dozens and dozens of colors of paint,

1124
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:13,300
thousands of gallons of paint to paint Everest

1125
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:16,780
and they said there's four shades of gray alone

1126
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:20,120
to do the snow, to do the different gradients of snow.

1127
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,400
But someone asked about roadie and they said,

1128
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:28,040
well, Joe's not in the park right now.

1129
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:31,560
He kind of splits his time between Orlando and Glendale

1130
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:36,320
but even when he is not, he travels for Imagineering

1131
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:39,100
but even when he's not working, he loves to travel.

1132
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:42,720
So last we heard he's in Mongolia tracking snow leopards.

1133
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:44,020
Wow.

1134
00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:47,460
It's a good Instagram also.

1135
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:50,660
Amazing Instagram, very thoughtful captions.

1136
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:54,220
He writes a lot too and posts his sketchbooks,

1137
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:56,980
sometimes he keeps very intense sketchbooks and all.

1138
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:59,440
It's interesting, I find it fascinating that story

1139
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:02,140
with the high school because that's one of those instances

1140
00:45:02,140 --> 00:45:05,240
where he wasn't looking for Disney,

1141
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:07,360
it's just happenstance that that happens

1142
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:08,820
unless there's more to the story we don't know

1143
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:11,840
but he isn't like Tony where Tony's a super fan

1144
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:14,780
and he was on a collision course with his talent in Disney

1145
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:16,640
because he worked there, he's obsessed with it.

1146
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:20,620
Just by happenstance, this interesting designer man

1147
00:45:20,620 --> 00:45:23,640
gets swept up and then he takes to it.

1148
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:24,600
I don't think, I mean maybe.

1149
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:29,360
That's true, he wasn't romanticizing Disney specifically,

1150
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:31,600
just he was into what he was into

1151
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:35,880
and able to bring all those influences to the company.

1152
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:38,180
Yeah, what I would imagine it was like,

1153
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:41,120
yeah he figured out how to make it your own

1154
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:43,520
or whatever you would, he figured out very quickly

1155
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:47,520
okay, I can do what I like but here in this.

1156
00:45:48,220 --> 00:45:50,500
Yeah, it's like we didn't set out to be podcasters.

1157
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:50,840
No.

1158
00:45:50,860 --> 00:45:54,300
We just love talking, we just talk about all this shit

1159
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:55,380
all the time anyway.

1160
00:45:56,320 --> 00:46:01,080
You get drafted into it more than you had a dream to do it.

1161
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:02,600
It's a calling.

1162
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:04,040
It's a calling.

1163
00:46:04,420 --> 00:46:07,640
Now checking, dreaming, doing, living.

1164
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:08,640
Checking.

1165
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:10,680
That is what it is.

1166
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:13,980
I do, as I'm thinking about it now,

1167
00:46:14,180 --> 00:46:17,000
I do get an endorphin rush from thinking about

1168
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,380
trying to find a good deal.

1169
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:20,260
Like I'm thinking about it now.

1170
00:46:20,260 --> 00:46:22,380
Describe what you're feeling physically.

1171
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:24,780
Well physically, I'm a little tired today,

1172
00:46:24,820 --> 00:46:27,440
my voice a little hoarse but if I think about it,

1173
00:46:27,820 --> 00:46:29,640
if I think about like oh, I'm gonna go to Disney,

1174
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:32,120
obviously it's mixed up with the Disney World trip.

1175
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:34,800
That is somewhere in there buried in the feelings

1176
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,800
of the checking is knowing oh, I'm gonna get to stay

1177
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:38,740
in the hotel, I'm gonna get to go to the parks.

1178
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:41,880
But the idea of that website that doesn't work very well,

1179
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:43,580
the Orlando, you know what I'm talking about.

1180
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:46,060
Have you tried to book hotels on the Disney World website?

1181
00:46:46,460 --> 00:46:48,440
Oh, on Disney's official one?

1182
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:50,660
It's clunky, it's like the same thing

1183
00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:52,040
that they've had it since like 2000.

1184
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:54,100
It doesn't make any sense why it's like that.

1185
00:46:54,940 --> 00:46:57,560
My family has had good luck calling them.

1186
00:46:58,040 --> 00:46:59,160
Calling the travel.

1187
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:01,300
Because Disney has a full travel infrastructure

1188
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:03,580
and even Universal now has a pretty intense

1189
00:47:03,580 --> 00:47:04,400
travel structure.

1190
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:07,680
But yeah, there's a whole confusing thing

1191
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:10,800
if you have like, there's like discounts.

1192
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:13,220
And at the time when I was a premier pass holder,

1193
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:15,800
you have to go around, there's a whole way

1194
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:18,560
you have to log in to see if there's a discount

1195
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:20,520
that you'll get from being the premier.

1196
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:22,900
And it's not easy, it's a whole clunky way

1197
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:25,020
and then you can get like an extra 5% off

1198
00:47:25,020 --> 00:47:28,120
the normal sale price that you'd originally get.

1199
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:30,040
So it's it's.

1200
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:33,860
And now you're just turning into a big glass of wine to me.

1201
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:36,560
Now I'm just leaving the building.

1202
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:38,340
Your brain is trying to soothe you.

1203
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:40,420
It's seeing something unpleasant in front of you

1204
00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:41,980
and it's like, well, what'll calm him down?

1205
00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:42,600
All right, got it.

1206
00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:45,040
To me, you look like a Breyers ice cream

1207
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:48,180
at the height of the summer when it's 250 a gallon

1208
00:47:48,180 --> 00:47:50,060
or 250 a quart.

1209
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:53,500
Right now, see we're in the middle of winter right now

1210
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:57,340
at the grocery store, ice cream was like $6 a quart.

1211
00:47:57,660 --> 00:47:58,100
Nice.

1212
00:47:58,100 --> 00:47:58,700
Oh really?

1213
00:47:59,120 --> 00:47:59,280
Yeah.

1214
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:00,600
It's that different?

1215
00:48:00,740 --> 00:48:01,600
It is that different.

1216
00:48:02,060 --> 00:48:02,580
$250 to $6?

1217
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:03,740
Are you still.

1218
00:48:03,740 --> 00:48:05,740
Do you have like on your stocks app,

1219
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:07,740
can you like, here's the price of gold,

1220
00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:10,500
here's the price of steel, here's the price of ice cream.

1221
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:11,600
The price of ice cream.

1222
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:12,900
Price of Sherbet.

1223
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:14,560
Is that one of the cost of living?

1224
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:15,760
Could I get that?

1225
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:18,660
Like it's a loaf of bread, a gallon of milk.

1226
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:21,080
Could we get ice cream in there too?

1227
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:23,800
Do you always have, I think we've covered this,

1228
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:25,400
you always have like a little thing of ice cream

1229
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:26,260
in the freezer?

1230
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:27,580
It depends on.

1231
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:31,300
Okay.

1232
00:48:32,180 --> 00:48:33,840
This is a sincere answer.

1233
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:35,200
That's all I ask for.

1234
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:38,840
It depends on how much other sweets are in the house.

1235
00:48:39,340 --> 00:48:41,720
So if you got a lot of Christmas candy.

1236
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:43,100
Yeah, I don't right now

1237
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:45,000
because I have a lot of stocking stuff for candy.

1238
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:46,580
Good time of the year.

1239
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:47,940
Good time of the year, yeah.

1240
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:50,300
So you have like, when you say candy,

1241
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:54,240
is it like a Fannie Mae style or what's the other one?

1242
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:54,620
Sweet?

1243
00:48:55,060 --> 00:49:03,740
Oh, no, like Dove bars or the Christmas tree shaped Reese's

1244
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:07,440
or just like stuff you could fit in an actual stocking.

1245
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:09,620
Cadbury bars are really good.

1246
00:49:09,740 --> 00:49:12,500
We're recording this, it's like two and a half weeks

1247
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:14,220
after Christmas or so.

1248
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:18,280
Is it that you, how much candy is in that stocking though?

1249
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:20,240
Cause I went through my candy in the stocking.

1250
00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:22,120
Well, you have to remember my parents are divorced

1251
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:23,340
so I have two stockings.

1252
00:49:23,340 --> 00:49:25,000
They're stocking each one.

1253
00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:29,240
And then my stepdad usually, my mom and stepdad

1254
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:32,760
live out in Amish country and all of those country,

1255
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:35,260
kitschy kind of Pennsylvania Dutch stores

1256
00:49:35,260 --> 00:49:38,280
are just filled with bulk candy and stuff.

1257
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:41,120
Oh, so your stocking is like loaded up.

1258
00:49:41,140 --> 00:49:43,340
So stocking or like gift bags and stuff.

1259
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:46,720
So do you ever have dreams about them getting divorced

1260
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:48,740
thus creating a third?

1261
00:49:48,740 --> 00:49:49,560
A third.

1262
00:49:50,060 --> 00:49:52,060
I think. Assuming you would go visit.

1263
00:49:52,060 --> 00:49:54,620
I think I would have other concerns.

1264
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:56,180
Yeah.

1265
00:49:57,880 --> 00:49:59,440
I'm not saying it'd be the first thing,

1266
00:49:59,540 --> 00:50:01,920
but just like to give you solace

1267
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:04,400
in everything swirling emotionally.

1268
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:06,580
Like, well, maybe third stocking.

1269
00:50:07,460 --> 00:50:08,240
Yeah.

1270
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:12,220
Maybe, I had never considered that possibility

1271
00:50:12,220 --> 00:50:13,900
until this very moment.

1272
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:15,880
It should not be wishing that.

1273
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:17,300
I'm certainly not wishing those.

1274
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:17,800
No, yeah, I know.

1275
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:19,040
It'd be the only silver lining.

1276
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:22,920
But you know, I will say I don't often buy

1277
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:25,440
like a thing of non-pareils

1278
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:27,440
or chocolate espresso beans for myself.

1279
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:29,080
Although Mike has been with me when I have bought

1280
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:30,920
a scoop of chocolate or espresso beans.

1281
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:31,620
What am I talking about?

1282
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:32,980
This is what you need.

1283
00:50:33,180 --> 00:50:35,740
You need a girlfriend or to get married

1284
00:50:35,740 --> 00:50:36,860
because then you've got in love.

1285
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:39,980
That's your ticket to get divorced.

1286
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:42,720
And now, this is, I'm just trying to design it

1287
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:45,060
as many stockings for you as possible.

1288
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:47,820
Also like how emotionally attached do you get to the,

1289
00:50:48,620 --> 00:50:50,360
the mother-in-laws, right?

1290
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:53,060
I've learned from stand-up comedy,

1291
00:50:53,180 --> 00:50:55,220
the most insidious thing in the world

1292
00:50:55,220 --> 00:50:56,880
is the dang mother-in-law.

1293
00:50:57,540 --> 00:50:59,640
I learned that in driving school.

1294
00:50:59,740 --> 00:51:01,220
I had a driving school instructor

1295
00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:03,280
who was slipping in a lot of mother-in-law jokes.

1296
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:05,940
I love that all driving instructors

1297
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:07,580
trained in the borscht belt.

1298
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:10,000
I also had like a-

1299
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:10,980
Tricky roads up there.

1300
00:51:11,580 --> 00:51:13,300
I had, my driver's ed teacher also

1301
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:15,340
was like a hacky comedian guy.

1302
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:16,100
Like a type guy.

1303
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:17,300
Have we talked about this in the show before?

1304
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:19,240
I don't think we have talked about it, but yeah.

1305
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:20,300
Is that a common,

1306
00:51:20,420 --> 00:51:23,980
because there is specifically stand-up driving schools,

1307
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:26,840
but I think maybe in general they attract like-

1308
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:27,580
That's interesting.

1309
00:51:27,980 --> 00:51:29,080
We're people who just want, like,

1310
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:31,200
oh my God, I got an audience slipping in.

1311
00:51:31,460 --> 00:51:32,620
A small audience.

1312
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:33,580
Yeah, yeah.

1313
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:36,040
Of people who hate being there.

1314
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:37,160
Right, yeah.

1315
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:37,720
That's interesting.

1316
00:51:38,620 --> 00:51:42,340
All right, well I'll keep designing stocking plans for you.

1317
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:42,740
Oh, thanks.

1318
00:51:42,740 --> 00:51:43,520
Doing math.

1319
00:51:44,020 --> 00:51:46,520
So yeah, so there's this Imagineering tour.

1320
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:48,540
I was saying I watched this Imagineering tour video.

1321
00:51:48,660 --> 00:51:51,380
I thought all the talk about like how they use color

1322
00:51:51,380 --> 00:51:56,560
to tell stories and they had to like use,

1323
00:51:56,660 --> 00:51:59,440
the color red shows up a lot in the queue

1324
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:01,160
and around Expedition Everest,

1325
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:02,680
because as they say in the special,

1326
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:05,120
it's considered a protective color.

1327
00:52:05,420 --> 00:52:09,520
So you'll see it in Nepal and it's around doorways

1328
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:11,400
and windows in the corner of buildings.

1329
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:13,720
It's very like subtly dusted on.

1330
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:14,900
Yeah, kind of.

1331
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:16,360
That's one, I feel, you know,

1332
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:19,220
you could take the same structures of this ride

1333
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:21,840
and have worse painters do it

1334
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:24,520
and it would have 50% the impact.

1335
00:52:24,740 --> 00:52:27,080
Like there's such, these things are really

1336
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:29,580
just beautifully touched up.

1337
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:32,620
To the point they said in one of these videos that like,

1338
00:52:32,660 --> 00:52:34,340
you know, because they were using a lot of plaster

1339
00:52:34,340 --> 00:52:36,040
and trying not to use a lot of wood,

1340
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:38,480
because wood is very rare around the Himalayas.

1341
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:41,760
So wood is, they were saying you see it as accents

1342
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:43,900
to buildings or on top of buildings,

1343
00:52:43,900 --> 00:52:47,780
but they don't have, so it's a lot more like mud and clay

1344
00:52:47,780 --> 00:52:48,440
and that sort of thing.

1345
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:51,240
And there was like one of the colors of the plant.

1346
00:52:51,420 --> 00:52:54,360
They were trying to, they thought they had the texture

1347
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:56,620
right to recreate it, but it wasn't looking right.

1348
00:52:56,660 --> 00:53:00,420
So the one time Rody went back to the Himalayas,

1349
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:02,620
he asked them like, how do you do this

1350
00:53:02,620 --> 00:53:03,480
when you do the buildings?

1351
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:05,220
And they were ladling it out.

1352
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:06,800
They had been trying to scoop it out.

1353
00:53:06,860 --> 00:53:09,960
They were using like a soup ladle kind of thing.

1354
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:13,180
And when they did that with the version they had recreated,

1355
00:53:13,180 --> 00:53:14,440
then it looked right.

1356
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:17,280
So it's like that level of attention to detail.

1357
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:24,320
Rare is the person who would recognize all of these

1358
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:27,100
methods and why they're being done.

1359
00:53:28,020 --> 00:53:30,340
And most tourists, or what most people are going on

1360
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:32,220
that don't really, just kind of washes over them,

1361
00:53:32,220 --> 00:53:35,380
but you'd be able to tell if it wasn't done

1362
00:53:35,380 --> 00:53:36,720
with this degree of detail.

1363
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:37,520
You really could.

1364
00:53:37,660 --> 00:53:38,320
Oh yeah.

1365
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:43,260
Yeah, God bless him for being so to the letter.

1366
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:47,280
Yeah, and I think, and from my perspective,

1367
00:53:47,340 --> 00:53:51,240
I have not traveled a lot internationally at all,

1368
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:54,400
but respectful to the cultures too.

1369
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:58,540
I would be very curious to hear about how Rody learned

1370
00:53:58,540 --> 00:54:01,160
to travel like that.

1371
00:54:01,180 --> 00:54:04,460
So you're not like just the white colonizer,

1372
00:54:04,460 --> 00:54:09,520
Kool-Aid man his way, like Dr. Livingston.

1373
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:10,860
I didn't know where you were going with that.

1374
00:54:10,940 --> 00:54:15,040
Just bursting into a country like Dr. Livingston in Africa.

1375
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:20,520
I do like Kool-Aid manning as a term for being

1376
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:25,840
not delicate in your arrivals and presence.

1377
00:54:25,980 --> 00:54:30,420
Yeah, I think it's a very useful term for Hollywood,

1378
00:54:30,620 --> 00:54:34,300
the way some executives or producers or writers behave,

1379
00:54:34,300 --> 00:54:37,580
where they just burst in and start shooting their mouth off.

1380
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:42,840
Yeah, but let's not go ascribing negative qualities

1381
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:43,920
to the Kool-Aid man.

1382
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:46,600
No, the Kool-Aid man is benevolent.

1383
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:48,140
He gives of himself.

1384
00:54:48,260 --> 00:54:50,600
He is filled with the delicious nectar.

1385
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:51,600
Drink of my blood.

1386
00:54:52,620 --> 00:54:54,160
And he always brought a party with him.

1387
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:57,560
So it's like it's not, it was destruction with a purpose.

1388
00:54:57,940 --> 00:55:04,080
I watched him just a montage of like 50 Kool-Aid man burst-ins

1389
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:06,680
that I was so happy by.

1390
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:07,600
I could watch.

1391
00:55:08,220 --> 00:55:11,480
If I wish there were a full 24 hours worth, I could watch.

1392
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:12,640
Is he still bursting?

1393
00:55:13,420 --> 00:55:15,960
Are there new commercials where he's bursting through walls?

1394
00:55:16,700 --> 00:55:19,680
I don't know, they're probably all Geico ripoff now,

1395
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:21,300
where they're just like odd and still

1396
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:22,640
and awkward or something.

1397
00:55:23,580 --> 00:55:25,480
I don't know, I think there's been some pretty recent.

1398
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:27,300
You know what I appreciate?

1399
00:55:27,340 --> 00:55:30,560
They were doing the burst-ins so early in the 60s.

1400
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:32,480
It was probably so hard to do that stuff.

1401
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:34,200
And he had the animated face.

1402
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:35,500
How hard was that to do?

1403
00:55:35,620 --> 00:55:37,260
It's probably drawn on the film.

1404
00:55:37,860 --> 00:55:40,240
Yeah, easier in the 80s.

1405
00:55:41,860 --> 00:55:46,060
We'll get into who may, I would love to find out

1406
00:55:46,060 --> 00:55:48,340
the personnel behind the Kool-Aid man.

1407
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:49,200
Oh, the Kool-Aid man.

1408
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:52,660
Yeah, the madman kind of guys who are behind the Kool-Aid man.

1409
00:55:52,820 --> 00:55:55,160
Kool-Aid man never in a theme park or a ride?

1410
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:56,580
I don't think so.

1411
00:55:56,580 --> 00:55:56,940
I don't think so.

1412
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:58,700
Seems perfect for something.

1413
00:55:59,140 --> 00:56:00,660
A weird out of the way thing.

1414
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:02,980
So why hasn't Hershey hit up?

1415
00:56:03,340 --> 00:56:05,420
I don't think that's in the same umbrella.

1416
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:07,380
No, I don't know who owns Kool-Aid.

1417
00:56:07,700 --> 00:56:10,460
Although speaking of company-based rides,

1418
00:56:11,420 --> 00:56:14,960
we're just a week or so, no, not even a week,

1419
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:18,320
just a few days past the Consumer Electronic Show in Vegas.

1420
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:21,920
And a lot of people were mentioning that Google

1421
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:23,140
built a dark ride.

1422
00:56:23,620 --> 00:56:26,240
I haven't really watched it yet, but I don't.

1423
00:56:26,260 --> 00:56:28,600
I mean, I don't have the best opinion of tech companies

1424
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:29,500
right now.

1425
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,460
But they built a dark ride.

1426
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:34,200
But they did build a ride, so I have to look into that.

1427
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:34,640
So maybe they're good.

1428
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:36,760
Yeah.

1429
00:56:38,380 --> 00:56:39,200
I lost my train of thought.

1430
00:56:39,420 --> 00:56:40,180
Yeah, I know.

1431
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:44,700
It's a runaway train, just like the ride itself.

1432
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:46,920
We're talking about painting and stuff.

1433
00:56:47,220 --> 00:56:49,240
Maybe we talk a little about the,

1434
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:53,280
I think we probably all learned about how the mountain itself

1435
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:59,400
was built, which this again in Matterhorn is the demo

1436
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:01,500
and this is the full realization of it,

1437
00:57:01,860 --> 00:57:04,580
that they were able to, our beloved fake rocks

1438
00:57:04,580 --> 00:57:07,380
were in fake rock territory, and they were able to,

1439
00:57:07,380 --> 00:57:09,880
for the first time, use digital technology

1440
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:12,520
to print the surface of the fake rocks.

1441
00:57:13,060 --> 00:57:16,780
And they're like, so every, it's all these slats.

1442
00:57:16,780 --> 00:57:19,600
There was a term for it, and I forget what it is now.

1443
00:57:20,540 --> 00:57:21,340
But like.

1444
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:22,760
Terra bars or something?

1445
00:57:23,020 --> 00:57:26,040
Or not the scaffolding, because they had a very interesting

1446
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:26,760
scaffolding.

1447
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:28,180
Oh yeah, that's a different thing.

1448
00:57:28,180 --> 00:57:32,520
I mean, it's all these panels that are all applied

1449
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:35,140
to the big steel structure, but they're all different

1450
00:57:35,140 --> 00:57:38,000
because they're randomized by computer.

1451
00:57:38,060 --> 00:57:39,800
So it's this very 3D printed.

1452
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:46,600
They were able to specifically design the texture of all

1453
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:50,940
of these many thousands of blocks of fake rock paneling,

1454
00:57:51,020 --> 00:57:54,880
and then installed it all, but then went in and covered

1455
00:57:55,240 --> 00:58:00,860
everything in tin foil in order to make really perfect

1456
00:58:00,860 --> 00:58:03,900
and randomized craggy rock texture.

1457
00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:06,480
So they laid that in and then painted it.

1458
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:10,300
I forget how the tin foil came into effect.

1459
00:58:10,340 --> 00:58:11,900
All that stuff is just truly something.

1460
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:16,000
If they put you in a room, how would you even know

1461
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,320
where to begin?

1462
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:19,680
It's so detailed.

1463
00:58:19,740 --> 00:58:22,460
That special really breaks it down in detail

1464
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:25,520
of how crazy this job is.

1465
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:27,600
How hard and insane it is.

1466
00:58:27,700 --> 00:58:31,340
You also in the special meet the people behind the sound.

1467
00:58:31,860 --> 00:58:35,560
And I think sound is a real, we haven't talked about this

1468
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:40,180
much, but you really are in the Disney parks never thinking

1469
00:58:40,180 --> 00:58:41,960
about where the sound is coming from.

1470
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:45,340
When a parade is in motion, seriously where?

1471
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:47,200
Is it sometimes it's in the float?

1472
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:48,660
Is it below you?

1473
00:58:48,700 --> 00:58:49,560
Is it in the street?

1474
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:51,000
Is it hidden in planters?

1475
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:53,180
It's very, very hard to tell.

1476
00:58:53,260 --> 00:58:54,620
And you're not supposed to know.

1477
00:58:54,920 --> 00:58:56,640
But in this ride, yes.

1478
00:58:57,260 --> 00:58:58,920
Sometimes it's below the track.

1479
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:01,840
Sometimes when you hit that giant peak,

1480
00:59:02,420 --> 00:59:04,780
it's hidden in the rock work on either side of you.

1481
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:07,580
And there's so much going on in terms of yeti sounds

1482
00:59:07,580 --> 00:59:08,880
and atmospheric sounds.

1483
00:59:08,900 --> 00:59:10,620
And this has to be a low rumble, so it's gotta be

1484
00:59:10,620 --> 00:59:12,220
this kind of speaker and go under here.

1485
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:16,240
It's hard to appreciate because it's hidden,

1486
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:19,940
but there's such crazy artistry to it.

1487
00:59:19,940 --> 00:59:22,840
I feel like there was a few years before I even realized

1488
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:26,860
that that Indiana Jones vehicle engine is fake.

1489
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:29,660
Like that's how, I mean again, maybe I'm making myself

1490
00:59:29,660 --> 00:59:32,320
sound stupid, but like after a couple years,

1491
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:35,420
I feel like I was like, oh yeah, that's a gas engine.

1492
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:38,140
That's obviously a noise to make it sound like a Jeep.

1493
00:59:38,340 --> 00:59:40,820
It's not like actual sound of the, obviously I think

1494
00:59:40,820 --> 00:59:42,380
I knew the stalling out was fake,

1495
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:43,540
because that couldn't be real.

1496
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:45,380
But I still think that I was like, oh yeah,

1497
00:59:45,380 --> 00:59:47,540
there's all these sounds that I'm just taking for granted

1498
00:59:47,540 --> 00:59:49,660
that are adding to the atmosphere of this thing.

1499
00:59:49,660 --> 00:59:51,020
And I didn't even realize it.

1500
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:54,980
Well, and they said on Everest, they built steam pipes

1501
00:59:54,980 --> 01:00:01,360
in the station, but it's like built into the ground,

1502
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:06,040
so that when the train comes up, it looks like it's coming

1503
01:00:06,040 --> 01:00:10,580
out of the train, steam, because like roller coaster cars,

1504
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:14,920
you don't wanna build a steam generator in a roller coaster

1505
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:16,660
car that you don't need there.

1506
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:21,460
So, and then they had to, the woman talking about coloring

1507
01:00:21,460 --> 01:00:24,720
to tell a story, then on the train, they had to paint

1508
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:27,680
in the soot that like, you know.

1509
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:32,620
And they've talked about how they've wanted and allowed

1510
01:00:32,620 --> 01:00:36,440
like physical, not mechanical, but physical wear and tear

1511
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:41,280
on the vehicles, because then it looks like a beaten up

1512
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:46,380
old train, you know, as opposed to a shiny new

1513
01:00:46,380 --> 01:00:48,080
just built and installed in Florida.

1514
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:52,160
And in the special, it's like super cloudy and rainy one day

1515
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:54,600
and Rhodey's looking up excited, he's like,

1516
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:56,980
looks even better, it looks like the real place now.

1517
01:00:57,580 --> 01:01:02,000
So this thing like, you know, incorporated the elements

1518
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:02,880
in a cool way.

1519
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:04,940
Yeah, and then it's like with the mountain stuff

1520
01:01:04,940 --> 01:01:08,080
and like big thunder stuff that's based in reality,

1521
01:01:08,340 --> 01:01:10,920
like it does, as long as there's upkeep you have to do to it,

1522
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:13,360
but also it does get more character as the years go on.

1523
01:01:13,540 --> 01:01:16,400
So like it does add to it that it looks like

1524
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:17,220
a little junkier.

1525
01:01:17,380 --> 01:01:21,700
Just as the trees grow and fill in gaps that weren't there,

1526
01:01:21,840 --> 01:01:23,820
and maybe that's the whole thing, maybe like,

1527
01:01:23,900 --> 01:01:26,500
well, I'd say definitely with Everest now

1528
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:28,940
and much more recently with Avatar,

1529
01:01:29,780 --> 01:01:34,380
like probably Animal Kingdom seemingly is at its peak now.

1530
01:01:34,460 --> 01:01:37,280
It's like, whereas there's probably other parks

1531
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:38,460
that have the opposite effects,

1532
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:40,740
that come out of the gate perfect and shiny,

1533
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,260
and then aren't kept upright or like.

1534
01:01:44,980 --> 01:01:47,040
Yeah, Epcot Center's gotten worse.

1535
01:01:47,780 --> 01:01:50,320
Hollywood Studios has needed like a reconceptualizing

1536
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:54,040
of what it even is, but Animal Kingdom is only improved

1537
01:01:54,040 --> 01:01:54,780
and improved and improved.

1538
01:01:54,860 --> 01:01:56,180
It's a little like engine that could.

1539
01:01:56,360 --> 01:01:59,120
Islands of Adventure I think had a lot more detail

1540
01:01:59,120 --> 01:02:03,580
and certainly a lot more like port of entry kind of stuff

1541
01:02:03,580 --> 01:02:07,280
throughout or like in, there used to be those junk boats

1542
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:08,620
that would go across the lagoon

1543
01:02:08,620 --> 01:02:11,760
and all of that's so quickly faded away.

1544
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:14,300
I mean, I'm sure some of it you could chalk up to.

1545
01:02:14,540 --> 01:02:18,120
Islands of Adventure opens 99, September 11th happens,

1546
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:20,120
and like Orlando took a hit hard.

1547
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:22,320
I mean, Disney had hotels closed,

1548
01:02:22,900 --> 01:02:23,900
like they had so many issues.

1549
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:25,140
Did something close entirely?

1550
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:29,400
I think some of the smaller hotels,

1551
01:02:29,460 --> 01:02:32,240
some of the mid-range hotels might've like closed for.

1552
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:33,380
You mean like temporarily.

1553
01:02:33,380 --> 01:02:34,160
Temporarily.

1554
01:02:34,180 --> 01:02:34,700
Right, right.

1555
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:38,120
And then construction, a lot of some of the all-stars,

1556
01:02:38,740 --> 01:02:40,920
like their openings were delayed years.

1557
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:41,840
Oh sure.

1558
01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:43,460
Like they were just left as construction shells.

1559
01:02:43,740 --> 01:02:46,880
That's another thing about this ride is that,

1560
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:50,500
I've said it before, I think there was a real dark period

1561
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:53,760
for theme parks after September 11th

1562
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:56,920
with the tourism diving, with less money coming in

1563
01:02:56,920 --> 01:02:59,620
and just Disney's already getting cheap

1564
01:02:59,620 --> 01:03:01,940
and California Adventure was so cruddy when it opened.

1565
01:03:03,360 --> 01:03:05,440
Like think about the, like in the,

1566
01:03:05,580 --> 01:03:07,140
this is 2006 is when this opened.

1567
01:03:07,620 --> 01:03:08,220
Yeah, yeah.

1568
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:12,380
Like what else was good in the parks leading up to this?

1569
01:03:12,580 --> 01:03:15,080
Like there's things, Mission Space obviously a big,

1570
01:03:16,560 --> 01:03:19,260
like super technological Marvel attraction,

1571
01:03:19,300 --> 01:03:20,740
but like not very well regarded.

1572
01:03:21,020 --> 01:03:21,960
Right, you said good.

1573
01:03:22,220 --> 01:03:22,880
Yeah, yeah.

1574
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:23,880
What else was good?

1575
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:26,600
An interesting swing, a big swing,

1576
01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:28,200
a big interesting building.

1577
01:03:28,460 --> 01:03:32,000
But Everest seems like something you'd make in a golden age

1578
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,480
and it's surrounded by a lot of nothing

1579
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:37,280
and a lot of them going, well let's celebrate the anniversary

1580
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:38,680
because we don't have a new ride.

1581
01:03:39,940 --> 01:03:41,500
But this feels like, right?

1582
01:03:41,580 --> 01:03:43,100
It's like Disneyland was kind of garbage.

1583
01:03:43,180 --> 01:03:46,060
I can't think of anything they added from like 03 to 06.

1584
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:49,660
Because when we went, when I hadn't been in 10 years,

1585
01:03:50,060 --> 01:03:53,400
the stuff that I hadn't gone on at that point was

1586
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:58,080
Mickey's PhilharMagic and Everest.

1587
01:03:58,200 --> 01:04:00,140
And I think that's it.

1588
01:04:00,500 --> 01:04:03,180
I'm pretty sure that's it as far as new stuff

1589
01:04:03,180 --> 01:04:04,840
and I hadn't been in 10 years.

1590
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:06,660
There might be one thing I'm forgetting,

1591
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:10,240
but that's nothing, that's like two rides in 10 years.

1592
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:10,820
Right.

1593
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:11,540
It's crazy.

1594
01:04:12,220 --> 01:04:13,920
Yeah, so Everest really carried the torch.

1595
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:14,740
I guess the Mission Space as well.

1596
01:04:14,900 --> 01:04:15,940
There it is, that's the last one.

1597
01:04:16,820 --> 01:04:20,020
But I mean, it's all on Everest in the 2000s.

1598
01:04:20,100 --> 01:04:22,580
This is the ride of the 2000s.

1599
01:04:23,140 --> 01:04:23,660
It carried the torch.

1600
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:25,800
And yeah, it is interesting.

1601
01:04:26,260 --> 01:04:28,400
I would be interested to know like

1602
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:29,260
how did they get it through?

1603
01:04:29,340 --> 01:04:30,820
Was it just because of the anniversary?

1604
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:34,120
And then I guess maybe they also had surveys that said like,

1605
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:35,860
you know, people would like a thrill ride here.

1606
01:04:36,360 --> 01:04:37,380
Yeah, I bet.

1607
01:04:37,460 --> 01:04:39,380
Maybe it was always part of the plans.

1608
01:04:39,420 --> 01:04:42,540
Maybe it was one of those like tier two will be there,

1609
01:04:42,680 --> 01:04:43,820
phase two will be this.

1610
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:47,060
I think also, I wonder at that point,

1611
01:04:47,080 --> 01:04:49,400
cause I think they always intended to build

1612
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:51,000
the Beastly Kingdom stuff.

1613
01:04:51,380 --> 01:04:53,000
Or at least for a few years too.

1614
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:54,620
And I wonder if that was still,

1615
01:04:54,680 --> 01:04:56,700
I wonder when that finally went away for good.

1616
01:04:57,080 --> 01:05:00,840
Cause I think it was supposed to be where Pandora is now.

1617
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:04,560
Yeah, I didn't come across a lot for this ride of like,

1618
01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:06,140
where did the idea come from?

1619
01:05:06,680 --> 01:05:09,420
Like what was the impetus for this

1620
01:05:09,420 --> 01:05:12,480
as opposed to like a different animal themed coaster

1621
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:13,100
or something?

1622
01:05:13,300 --> 01:05:14,260
Sure.

1623
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:15,480
Yeah, yeah.

1624
01:05:15,500 --> 01:05:16,240
I don't know what you mean.

1625
01:05:16,360 --> 01:05:17,800
I mean, it's a, yeah, it's like a mountain,

1626
01:05:17,960 --> 01:05:19,200
which is a Disney tradition.

1627
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:21,000
So I mean, that all makes sense.

1628
01:05:21,040 --> 01:05:22,040
But yeah, I wonder if what else,

1629
01:05:22,080 --> 01:05:23,440
I haven't seen anything about like,

1630
01:05:23,460 --> 01:05:25,340
what other ideas were thrown around?

1631
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:29,900
It is, I mean, they had a land based, you know, Asia.

1632
01:05:30,700 --> 01:05:33,840
So like it makes sense to the Himalayas.

1633
01:05:33,840 --> 01:05:36,720
The Himalayas are in such a large part of Asia.

1634
01:05:37,080 --> 01:05:38,300
So like it's there.

1635
01:05:38,380 --> 01:05:39,900
It makes total sense.

1636
01:05:39,900 --> 01:05:41,480
Like why it is there.

1637
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:45,340
Looking at a recent Animal Kingdom map,

1638
01:05:45,380 --> 01:05:48,780
I think it's interesting that if you look at

1639
01:05:48,780 --> 01:05:50,080
Animal Kingdom from above,

1640
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:53,080
this is sort of at like four o'clock on a watch

1641
01:05:53,080 --> 01:05:56,900
and Pandora's kind of at like seven o'clock.

1642
01:05:57,100 --> 01:05:58,580
So nicely spaced apart.

1643
01:05:58,740 --> 01:06:00,700
You have like the E-tickets far apart,

1644
01:06:00,900 --> 01:06:02,580
which is good for crowd control.

1645
01:06:02,580 --> 01:06:04,460
Like good for crowd disbursement.

1646
01:06:04,780 --> 01:06:05,120
Sure.

1647
01:06:05,320 --> 01:06:05,740
Wow.

1648
01:06:06,340 --> 01:06:09,640
Yeah, this one has, I think this line is usually the sec,

1649
01:06:09,700 --> 01:06:11,420
well, I guess now third longest.

1650
01:06:12,080 --> 01:06:14,420
Although I guess sometimes the safaris get a little long,

1651
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:15,760
depending on what time of day it is.

1652
01:06:15,780 --> 01:06:16,820
But yeah, I mean, these are,

1653
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:18,780
this is a very popular obviously,

1654
01:06:18,780 --> 01:06:20,380
cause it's, I would assume,

1655
01:06:20,660 --> 01:06:22,840
this is one of those things that if you're a family,

1656
01:06:22,920 --> 01:06:24,140
you've got to go do this one.

1657
01:06:24,520 --> 01:06:27,680
Like this and the two rides in Pandora.

1658
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:30,000
And this is potentially a family.

1659
01:06:30,060 --> 01:06:32,000
This isn't seemingly the most intense coaster.

1660
01:06:32,120 --> 01:06:32,840
No, it's not.

1661
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:35,040
I mean, you go, last time I went on,

1662
01:06:35,220 --> 01:06:37,080
it is fast and like you go backwards

1663
01:06:37,080 --> 01:06:39,440
and I felt like that rocks you a little bit,

1664
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:40,520
but it's not so crazy.

1665
01:06:41,240 --> 01:06:43,760
It's also like, I forget they say it on the special,

1666
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:45,260
it's sort of deceptively,

1667
01:06:45,520 --> 01:06:47,700
the mountain is deceptively tall looking.

1668
01:06:48,300 --> 01:06:50,880
The drop is called force perspective.

1669
01:06:51,320 --> 01:06:53,420
And it makes smaller things look bigger.

1670
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:55,260
Like that was the one thing about this special.

1671
01:06:55,340 --> 01:06:58,200
I was like, oh, we're getting a lot of 2006

1672
01:06:58,200 --> 01:06:59,900
travel channel narrator.

1673
01:07:00,020 --> 01:07:00,640
Manser's.

1674
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:01,540
Manser's.

1675
01:07:01,580 --> 01:07:03,640
The guy that you don't know, Jack guy.

1676
01:07:03,640 --> 01:07:05,920
Like, what do you think this is?

1677
01:07:06,280 --> 01:07:10,400
How does this coaster's top speed compare to a dick going?

1678
01:07:12,120 --> 01:07:13,460
A dick's thrust.

1679
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:15,040
A dick?

1680
01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:19,000
That was just the style of the times.

1681
01:07:19,140 --> 01:07:21,080
Did you catch what he said about roadie

1682
01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:22,880
when they first introduced roadie in the special?

1683
01:07:23,040 --> 01:07:23,340
No.

1684
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:23,640
I forget.

1685
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:26,120
Can you tell by the earring?

1686
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:28,580
This guy thinks outside the box.

1687
01:07:32,180 --> 01:07:34,700
What if I had an earring?

1688
01:07:35,020 --> 01:07:38,580
That's pretty wild thinking.

1689
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:41,220
Manser's.

1690
01:07:41,240 --> 01:07:42,460
You never did Manser's, right Jason?

1691
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:44,260
No, I never did anything for Manser's.

1692
01:07:44,260 --> 01:07:46,260
That was a little before my time at UCB.

1693
01:07:46,260 --> 01:07:51,920
I was starting to fish because when I realized,

1694
01:07:53,080 --> 01:07:54,740
somebody at Funny or Die,

1695
01:07:55,060 --> 01:07:58,220
that their girlfriend or wife was the casting person.

1696
01:07:58,520 --> 01:07:58,920
Yeah, yeah.

1697
01:07:58,940 --> 01:08:00,420
I was like, is this my inn?

1698
01:08:00,740 --> 01:08:02,880
I started to try, but I think it was a little too late.

1699
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:05,180
Oh, you were gonna try to be honest.

1700
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:06,520
I wanted to be honest very, very badly.

1701
01:08:06,680 --> 01:08:09,940
But I was not, I've never been a pure actor,

1702
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:12,380
so there's no reason why I would've done it.

1703
01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:14,820
I was just like, what strings can be pulled?

1704
01:08:15,120 --> 01:08:16,420
Look, I'll be a nerd.

1705
01:08:16,540 --> 01:08:17,960
I know I don't look like a bro.

1706
01:08:18,860 --> 01:08:20,200
You just wanted to be,

1707
01:08:20,440 --> 01:08:24,100
you wanted to join a Carnival sideshow for one day.

1708
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:24,580
Yeah, yeah.

1709
01:08:24,580 --> 01:08:27,340
You wanted to be one of Mr. Barnum's freaks

1710
01:08:27,340 --> 01:08:32,700
for a single 14 hour day for a hundred special dollars.

1711
01:08:33,280 --> 01:08:34,320
I cannot stress to people,

1712
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:37,240
do not look up the clip that I'm involved in on Manser's.

1713
01:08:37,440 --> 01:08:38,900
Do not look it up.

1714
01:08:39,220 --> 01:08:40,400
Don't try to find it.

1715
01:08:40,420 --> 01:08:42,620
I don't think Manser's particularly well archived.

1716
01:08:42,620 --> 01:08:43,900
I tried to find it the last time it came up.

1717
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:44,440
I think it's off.

1718
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:45,460
I think it's off the line.

1719
01:08:45,760 --> 01:08:47,260
Yeah, I even, you know what?

1720
01:08:47,280 --> 01:08:48,160
I don't think I told you this.

1721
01:08:48,240 --> 01:08:51,340
I bought a couple episodes of it.

1722
01:08:51,340 --> 01:08:52,220
To try to find it?

1723
01:08:52,520 --> 01:08:54,460
I forget why those.

1724
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:58,340
I was like, based on your vague description of what it was,

1725
01:08:58,360 --> 01:09:00,000
I looked at what were the topics,

1726
01:09:00,320 --> 01:09:04,100
but nobody out there is really keeping Manser's super archived.

1727
01:09:04,220 --> 01:09:05,500
I was hoping to just run into it

1728
01:09:05,500 --> 01:09:06,780
and be able to show it to you,

1729
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:08,200
but I couldn't, but I bought,

1730
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:10,340
the only place that are available is on Amazon,

1731
01:09:10,460 --> 01:09:14,040
so I piecemeal bought three episodes of Manser's.

1732
01:09:14,140 --> 01:09:15,940
Now, it's great entertainment.

1733
01:09:16,220 --> 01:09:16,800
Oh, it's fantastic.

1734
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:17,780
Regardless, but.

1735
01:09:17,780 --> 01:09:19,480
I will, I'll say this.

1736
01:09:19,640 --> 01:09:21,720
I'll tell you about one that I didn't do,

1737
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:24,060
because this person you're mentioning who was casting

1738
01:09:24,060 --> 01:09:26,900
called me once and she was a very nice person.

1739
01:09:27,180 --> 01:09:29,160
And she said, all right, now you don't,

1740
01:09:29,220 --> 01:09:30,920
you feel free to say no to this.

1741
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:33,000
And by the way, if people don't know what Manser's is,

1742
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:34,460
it was a show on Spike TV

1743
01:09:34,460 --> 01:09:36,900
where it would answer like guys questions

1744
01:09:36,900 --> 01:09:41,280
and it would always be like about shit or sex or piss

1745
01:09:41,280 --> 01:09:45,420
or like something like a beer, you know, guy stuff,

1746
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:50,280
shit piss, you know, sex, piss,

1747
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:52,620
fist, the shit of the dick.

1748
01:09:54,520 --> 01:09:55,780
Like that was everything.

1749
01:09:55,920 --> 01:09:56,780
And so it would be like.

1750
01:09:56,960 --> 01:09:58,600
How much shit could your dick piss?

1751
01:09:58,660 --> 01:10:00,020
Well, hold on, Scott.

1752
01:10:00,020 --> 01:10:02,480
You got very close to what I was about to say.

1753
01:10:02,500 --> 01:10:05,980
She goes, all right, now you don't have to,

1754
01:10:06,020 --> 01:10:08,020
so every segment would be a different question.

1755
01:10:08,040 --> 01:10:10,400
It would be like, how much beer could you drink

1756
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:11,540
before you died?

1757
01:10:12,460 --> 01:10:14,220
Like, would you blow up like a giant balloon,

1758
01:10:14,260 --> 01:10:17,480
like that girl in Willy Wonka, like stuff like that.

1759
01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:18,860
And it was like, she goes, all right,

1760
01:10:18,920 --> 01:10:21,220
so feel free to say no to this.

1761
01:10:22,220 --> 01:10:25,160
But would you be interested in being in the segment,

1762
01:10:25,500 --> 01:10:28,300
can you poop out your penis?

1763
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:33,140
And I said, thank you for offering.

1764
01:10:33,560 --> 01:10:35,300
No, thank you.

1765
01:10:35,300 --> 01:10:36,740
She said, I totally understand.

1766
01:10:36,860 --> 01:10:38,020
Don't worry about it.

1767
01:10:38,040 --> 01:10:40,560
Oh, if only my number had been next.

1768
01:10:40,720 --> 01:10:42,240
I would have loved to have,

1769
01:10:42,440 --> 01:10:44,280
I don't know what it would have entailed, but.

1770
01:10:44,740 --> 01:10:47,020
The first time I did it, I was uncomfortable.

1771
01:10:47,360 --> 01:10:49,040
So that's why, especially I was like not,

1772
01:10:49,100 --> 01:10:50,140
I think I ended up doing like,

1773
01:10:50,140 --> 01:10:52,280
I was in the background of a bar scene that season.

1774
01:10:52,700 --> 01:10:56,680
And you know, you made a nice $110 for that, the whole,

1775
01:10:56,760 --> 01:10:57,440
that was it.

1776
01:10:57,980 --> 01:10:58,320
Sweet.

1777
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:01,740
Wait, wait, I was just gonna say, what was the manser?

1778
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:03,940
Oh, I don't know, I never saw the episode.

1779
01:11:04,160 --> 01:11:05,960
I do know who did it though.

1780
01:11:06,220 --> 01:11:10,660
But it had been turned down by I think over 10 people.

1781
01:11:10,900 --> 01:11:12,940
Whoa, I wonder what it would have had.

1782
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:15,640
I would have, unless I, shirtlessness,

1783
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:17,800
per oddly would have counted me out,

1784
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:19,960
but this doesn't seem like it would require shirtlessness.

1785
01:11:19,960 --> 01:11:21,440
It could have.

1786
01:11:21,500 --> 01:11:22,540
They found a reason.

1787
01:11:22,540 --> 01:11:24,620
There was a lot of shirtless people.

1788
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:27,860
Thank God, if it had been, can you shit out of your nipples?

1789
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:29,400
I'm out for sure.

1790
01:11:30,140 --> 01:11:30,660
But.

1791
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:32,560
I think the answer was yes though.

1792
01:11:32,660 --> 01:11:33,460
I think I did ask.

1793
01:11:33,640 --> 01:11:34,460
I think the answer was.

1794
01:11:34,980 --> 01:11:37,120
There would be like, well, you know,

1795
01:11:37,260 --> 01:11:40,820
look if a doctor went in there and redirected some pipe.

1796
01:11:41,020 --> 01:11:42,220
I don't know if that was the answer,

1797
01:11:42,260 --> 01:11:43,020
but it was something like.

1798
01:11:43,060 --> 01:11:46,220
If you had a switch track, all law, Expedition Everest.

1799
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:48,540
If Joe Rody went into your intestines.

1800
01:11:48,540 --> 01:11:51,420
Well, that was going to say this is like turning Joe Rody's

1801
01:11:51,420 --> 01:11:53,740
inquisitive eye on trash culture.

1802
01:11:54,120 --> 01:11:56,440
And I would be, I'm curious to ask him like,

1803
01:11:56,440 --> 01:11:57,600
Joe, what's your poison?

1804
01:11:57,740 --> 01:11:58,560
What's your tread?

1805
01:11:58,700 --> 01:11:59,900
Like are you Vanderpump rule?

1806
01:11:59,920 --> 01:12:00,820
Do you bar rescue?

1807
01:12:00,940 --> 01:12:03,020
What's your garbage?

1808
01:12:03,500 --> 01:12:05,400
Like, no, you can't just.

1809
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:06,560
You're not all flashed.

1810
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:08,200
Read ancient scrolls all day long.

1811
01:12:08,340 --> 01:12:10,660
You gotta have something to cut it with, okay?

1812
01:12:11,820 --> 01:12:12,740
We'll see.

1813
01:12:12,860 --> 01:12:13,340
We'll have to ask.

1814
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:15,360
That's the question number one.

1815
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:16,340
What's your poison?

1816
01:12:16,460 --> 01:12:17,840
What's your poison, Joe Rody?

1817
01:12:17,960 --> 01:12:19,940
I love ridiculousness.

1818
01:12:20,160 --> 01:12:25,800
I love to see a laptop elevate, built on a giant scale

1819
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:28,960
and to have a man serve as a finger

1820
01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:30,460
stepping from key to key.

1821
01:12:30,620 --> 01:12:31,860
Well, you can't argue with that.

1822
01:12:32,020 --> 01:12:34,620
I mean, I caught an episode or two of ridiculous

1823
01:12:34,620 --> 01:12:39,040
on cable over the holidays and it just bleeds charisma.

1824
01:12:39,560 --> 01:12:41,600
I mean, there's one word you're thinking of.

1825
01:12:41,780 --> 01:12:42,280
Very popular.

1826
01:12:42,280 --> 01:12:42,600
Yo, what's up?

1827
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:45,620
I'm Rob Duda and this is ridiculousness.

1828
01:12:45,680 --> 01:12:49,520
And then like, he like, as much as he can make the sounds

1829
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:52,020
technically without actually opening his mouth

1830
01:12:52,020 --> 01:12:55,560
and then like, and then the girl who just cackles.

1831
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:57,580
She's a professional cackler.

1832
01:12:57,660 --> 01:12:58,800
I don't think I've ever seen an episode.

1833
01:12:59,280 --> 01:12:59,780
I saw an episode.

1834
01:12:59,780 --> 01:13:00,360
Ridiculousness is something else.

1835
01:13:00,380 --> 01:13:01,280
Oh, you've seen it a lot.

1836
01:13:01,300 --> 01:13:02,600
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

1837
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:03,020
I really like.

1838
01:13:03,020 --> 01:13:04,920
I saw one with one of the new Power Rangers,

1839
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:06,040
with one of the Power Rangers

1840
01:13:06,040 --> 01:13:08,420
from the big budget movie Power Rangers.

1841
01:13:09,020 --> 01:13:11,540
Which, all five are such mega stars today.

1842
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:12,760
So recognizable.

1843
01:13:13,160 --> 01:13:13,820
You can't avoid them.

1844
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,360
Yeah, we're all into their personal exploits.

1845
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:18,320
Anyway, Expedition Everest.

1846
01:13:18,540 --> 01:13:20,000
Back to Expedition Everest.

1847
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,820
We have to find our trash in side tracks

1848
01:13:23,820 --> 01:13:25,220
because we just like this ride a lot.

1849
01:13:25,360 --> 01:13:28,020
Yeah, we're trying to find the Forbidden Mountains.

1850
01:13:28,220 --> 01:13:31,780
We have been warned off from going near it.

1851
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:35,200
Well, the side, the story that we've missed

1852
01:13:35,200 --> 01:13:38,060
is that this was a railroad that was like a,

1853
01:13:38,060 --> 01:13:41,500
it was like a tea delivery route.

1854
01:13:42,480 --> 01:13:43,980
And like this isn't a roller coaster.

1855
01:13:44,060 --> 01:13:47,500
This is just a train where tea is moved from place to place.

1856
01:13:47,620 --> 01:13:50,460
But the Yeti did not like the train tracks

1857
01:13:50,460 --> 01:13:52,740
going through his mountain home.

1858
01:13:53,540 --> 01:13:55,460
So he tore it up or something.

1859
01:13:55,560 --> 01:13:58,180
But now it's back up and it's these two,

1860
01:13:58,180 --> 01:14:00,960
these two numbskulls, Norbu and Bob,

1861
01:14:01,620 --> 01:14:04,460
who are doing, they're taking the old tea route

1862
01:14:04,460 --> 01:14:07,540
and they've turned it into like a tourist thing.

1863
01:14:08,200 --> 01:14:11,980
And we're all Norbu's suckers.

1864
01:14:12,120 --> 01:14:14,320
We're all just a bunch of Norbu's.

1865
01:14:15,320 --> 01:14:17,640
Yeah, I didn't know that was the narrative

1866
01:14:17,640 --> 01:14:18,720
when I was in the line,

1867
01:14:18,740 --> 01:14:20,080
but I don't think that's so important.

1868
01:14:20,100 --> 01:14:21,800
This is a good optional narrative.

1869
01:14:22,220 --> 01:14:24,360
I think this is kind of where Theme Park stories

1870
01:14:24,360 --> 01:14:27,320
need to land is it's there if you want.

1871
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:31,620
But if you want, if you need to just be changing diapers

1872
01:14:31,620 --> 01:14:34,680
for the whole, if you need to be feeding goldfish

1873
01:14:34,680 --> 01:14:36,520
to your kids for the whole line,

1874
01:14:36,520 --> 01:14:38,460
you don't need to know, you don't need to pay attention

1875
01:14:38,460 --> 01:14:39,360
to any articles on the wall.

1876
01:14:39,400 --> 01:14:40,960
Yeah, dad, let's look, okay, what is it?

1877
01:14:41,040 --> 01:14:41,840
Roller coaster, got it.

1878
01:14:41,940 --> 01:14:42,640
Yeti, got it.

1879
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:43,560
That's all we need to know.

1880
01:14:43,740 --> 01:14:47,200
Well, it also seems like from what I read about

1881
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:48,400
as they're researching this,

1882
01:14:48,440 --> 01:14:53,940
they found that there is kind of a spiritualism,

1883
01:14:53,940 --> 01:14:58,760
the right word, but the Yeti seems to exist as a concept.

1884
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:01,940
I'll post a link to this from Mouse Planet

1885
01:15:01,940 --> 01:15:04,300
had this transcript of a talk Rody gave

1886
01:15:04,660 --> 01:15:07,220
explaining their theory behind the Yeti.

1887
01:15:08,080 --> 01:15:10,040
The other challenge that we set before us

1888
01:15:10,040 --> 01:15:12,240
was making the Yeti real, making a Yeti

1889
01:15:12,240 --> 01:15:15,360
that could both seem real and be this other Yeti,

1890
01:15:15,460 --> 01:15:16,720
the guardian of the mountain Yeti.

1891
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:19,320
So we did in fact blend both of these ideas

1892
01:15:19,320 --> 01:15:20,440
into making our Yeti.

1893
01:15:20,780 --> 01:15:23,820
Most people in the Himalayas believe the Yeti is real.

1894
01:15:23,900 --> 01:15:25,240
It's not like Bigfoot.

1895
01:15:25,580 --> 01:15:28,880
It is not something that like six rednecks in a bar

1896
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:32,300
think is real and everyone else thinks they're crazy.

1897
01:15:32,420 --> 01:15:33,700
That is not the Yeti.

1898
01:15:33,700 --> 01:15:35,100
When you go to the Himalayas,

1899
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:38,380
it's really hard to find people who don't think the Yeti

1900
01:15:38,380 --> 01:15:42,140
is either real right now or was real a few years ago.

1901
01:15:42,340 --> 01:15:44,340
The Yeti is real to these people.

1902
01:15:44,380 --> 01:15:44,940
That's wild.

1903
01:15:45,100 --> 01:15:46,580
So like there is a spirituality.

1904
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:50,800
There's like a, in the way that American urban legends,

1905
01:15:51,140 --> 01:15:54,520
the Bigfoot, the Jersey Devil are just kind of these,

1906
01:15:54,520 --> 01:15:55,640
you know, stories.

1907
01:15:55,820 --> 01:15:58,800
Like it feels like the Yeti holds more significance.

1908
01:15:59,420 --> 01:16:00,900
So is the Yeti real?

1909
01:16:00,900 --> 01:16:03,560
And how much shit could he piss?

1910
01:16:04,540 --> 01:16:06,020
So then they had to not.

1911
01:16:06,040 --> 01:16:07,160
How big is his hog?

1912
01:16:08,120 --> 01:16:10,680
We really like set that up perfectly

1913
01:16:10,680 --> 01:16:12,120
at the start of the episode

1914
01:16:12,120 --> 01:16:13,340
to talk about the Yeti pig-ass dick.

1915
01:16:13,340 --> 01:16:15,660
So how big is the Yeti's hog?

1916
01:16:18,380 --> 01:16:20,280
We asked this gorilla dick expert.

1917
01:16:20,680 --> 01:16:23,960
Well, extrapolating from a gorilla's penis size.

1918
01:16:25,560 --> 01:16:26,020
Whoa.

1919
01:16:26,280 --> 01:16:28,300
So there's kind of like a fleeting,

1920
01:16:28,540 --> 01:16:30,380
theoretical version of the Yeti

1921
01:16:30,380 --> 01:16:35,160
and then there is a Western version of the Yeti.

1922
01:16:35,500 --> 01:16:37,440
Like, oh, the Yeti is a big monster,

1923
01:16:37,640 --> 01:16:39,760
a Bigfoot type monster.

1924
01:16:40,100 --> 01:16:43,320
And they kind of had to make those both make sense together.

1925
01:16:43,400 --> 01:16:45,140
Like these local stories

1926
01:16:45,140 --> 01:16:49,460
and then translate that for a mass audience.

1927
01:16:49,580 --> 01:16:52,420
And that's what we're seeing in Expedition Everest.

1928
01:16:52,860 --> 01:16:56,780
So like a reverence had to be included.

1929
01:16:56,780 --> 01:17:00,680
It could not be some arbitrary just grr monster.

1930
01:17:00,780 --> 01:17:02,220
Although, once you're on the thing.

1931
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:07,460
Well, they clearly ended up swinging some of this story

1932
01:17:07,460 --> 01:17:12,100
into Matterhorn with the way that now,

1933
01:17:12,900 --> 01:17:17,760
the abominable snowman now has more of this component

1934
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:19,500
of he's protecting his mountain.

1935
01:17:19,720 --> 01:17:21,920
He's not just yelling at you arbitrarily,

1936
01:17:22,260 --> 01:17:23,420
he's being protective,

1937
01:17:23,460 --> 01:17:24,840
or at least that's how they explain the backstory.

1938
01:17:24,920 --> 01:17:26,280
And that's made a little more clear

1939
01:17:26,280 --> 01:17:29,420
with the added projection components

1940
01:17:29,420 --> 01:17:30,420
at the top of the Matterhorn.

1941
01:17:30,580 --> 01:17:31,880
And that's very much the,

1942
01:17:31,960 --> 01:17:35,180
he's not out for blood, he's being protective.

1943
01:17:35,380 --> 01:17:39,560
If we got to get off and explain it to him in his language,

1944
01:17:39,560 --> 01:17:40,640
he would understand.

1945
01:17:41,240 --> 01:17:41,860
So it makes sense.

1946
01:17:42,020 --> 01:17:44,480
He's not a villain, he's not a proper villain or something.

1947
01:17:45,400 --> 01:17:47,940
And there is a logic to the Yeti too,

1948
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:49,220
because people have tweeted at him,

1949
01:17:49,320 --> 01:17:51,220
it's like, why is the Yeti not white?

1950
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:55,060
And Rody's idea was that like,

1951
01:17:55,580 --> 01:17:57,240
there's nothing up there.

1952
01:17:57,300 --> 01:17:59,380
There's nothing at the snow-capped mountain.

1953
01:17:59,420 --> 01:18:06,120
Most of the Himalayas are barren and woods and forests.

1954
01:18:06,460 --> 01:18:08,340
And there's not food up there.

1955
01:18:08,720 --> 01:18:12,880
So it would probably be further down the mountain.

1956
01:18:13,420 --> 01:18:16,120
And one of the legends was that the Yeti could be invisible,

1957
01:18:16,140 --> 01:18:19,100
which if he was colored like the forest,

1958
01:18:19,460 --> 01:18:20,500
he would be invisible.

1959
01:18:20,540 --> 01:18:22,060
He would blend into the forest.

1960
01:18:22,120 --> 01:18:24,760
So there is a storytelling element too

1961
01:18:24,760 --> 01:18:26,040
to the color of.

1962
01:18:26,080 --> 01:18:26,380
He's like Predator?

1963
01:18:26,780 --> 01:18:27,080
Huh?

1964
01:18:27,380 --> 01:18:28,600
The Yeti is like the Predator?

1965
01:18:29,440 --> 01:18:30,540
Yeah, kind of.

1966
01:18:30,540 --> 01:18:31,900
Wow, that's awesome.

1967
01:18:32,680 --> 01:18:33,700
Which begs the question,

1968
01:18:34,120 --> 01:18:37,600
boy, Disney likes to expand their IPs

1969
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:39,560
and stuff, some kick-ass Yeti movie.

1970
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:42,340
Sure, and do they own Predator now with Fox?

1971
01:18:42,920 --> 01:18:43,380
Oh, I think.

1972
01:18:43,380 --> 01:18:44,220
Oh, I don't know.

1973
01:18:44,900 --> 01:18:45,200
Oh, Predator versus,

1974
01:18:45,200 --> 01:18:46,280
Yeti versus Predator.

1975
01:18:47,480 --> 01:18:48,980
Yeti versus Predator versus Alien,

1976
01:18:49,100 --> 01:18:49,380
which they also own.

1977
01:18:49,380 --> 01:18:50,260
Because they got Alien too.

1978
01:18:50,380 --> 01:18:50,920
Yeah.

1979
01:18:50,920 --> 01:18:51,420
Yeah.

1980
01:18:52,020 --> 01:18:53,220
Time to add a third.

1981
01:18:53,260 --> 01:18:54,240
Versus Freddy and Jason.

1982
01:18:55,140 --> 01:18:56,880
I assume they own those.

1983
01:18:57,120 --> 01:18:58,260
That might be a different one.

1984
01:18:58,660 --> 01:18:59,840
Wow, yeah, that's interesting.

1985
01:19:00,700 --> 01:19:01,320
I have a question.

1986
01:19:01,400 --> 01:19:03,700
Does Joe Roady believe in the Yeti?

1987
01:19:04,220 --> 01:19:07,300
I feel like he would give you a little mystery answer.

1988
01:19:07,500 --> 01:19:09,100
I feel like he might not answer that all the way.

1989
01:19:09,100 --> 01:19:10,480
He'd give you a little bit of magic.

1990
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:12,080
Which I guess that's what you want.

1991
01:19:12,620 --> 01:19:14,060
You spend enough time there.

1992
01:19:14,340 --> 01:19:15,900
You consume enough about this.

1993
01:19:15,900 --> 01:19:16,940
I would like to know,

1994
01:19:17,100 --> 01:19:19,880
because I have a minor fascination

1995
01:19:19,880 --> 01:19:22,000
with Sasquatch and the Grassman,

1996
01:19:22,020 --> 01:19:23,920
which is my favorite name for.

1997
01:19:23,960 --> 01:19:25,260
I don't know about the Grassman.

1998
01:19:25,460 --> 01:19:27,180
The Grassman is like Bigfoot.

1999
01:19:27,560 --> 01:19:30,300
But I forget what region they call him Grassman.

2000
01:19:30,320 --> 01:19:33,180
And there was a whole thing about finding the Grassman

2001
01:19:33,180 --> 01:19:34,100
on one of these channels.

2002
01:19:35,220 --> 01:19:36,060
And it's all just,

2003
01:19:36,220 --> 01:19:38,160
everyone's got their own regional version

2004
01:19:38,160 --> 01:19:39,160
of Bigfoot or whatever.

2005
01:19:39,500 --> 01:19:40,960
So it is fascinating to know,

2006
01:19:41,380 --> 01:19:42,120
for whatever reason,

2007
01:19:42,240 --> 01:19:43,760
this phenomenon has popped up

2008
01:19:43,760 --> 01:19:45,520
in different parts of the world.

2009
01:19:46,040 --> 01:19:47,800
I mean, it's not unlike religion,

2010
01:19:48,160 --> 01:19:49,840
where everyone has their own version of it.

2011
01:19:50,120 --> 01:19:50,760
But it's interesting.

2012
01:19:50,820 --> 01:19:51,320
I would wonder,

2013
01:19:51,700 --> 01:19:52,860
from a guy like Roady who's been

2014
01:19:52,860 --> 01:19:54,040
to so many different places.

2015
01:19:54,280 --> 01:19:55,500
I mean, not truly if he believes

2016
01:19:55,500 --> 01:19:57,160
that the Grassman is real.

2017
01:19:57,520 --> 01:19:58,940
But what has he seen?

2018
01:19:59,480 --> 01:20:01,240
What has he experienced with all the people

2019
01:20:01,240 --> 01:20:02,300
telling him about it?

2020
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:04,680
I think his theory was that

2021
01:20:04,680 --> 01:20:06,160
a lot of these people,

2022
01:20:07,220 --> 01:20:10,360
a lot of the different ethnic groups had moved.

2023
01:20:10,860 --> 01:20:12,040
And some of the groups had,

2024
01:20:12,240 --> 01:20:14,740
over years and years,

2025
01:20:15,200 --> 01:20:19,420
had migrated from different parts of Asia.

2026
01:20:19,620 --> 01:20:22,840
And potentially parts where maybe

2027
01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:24,260
the great ape,

2028
01:20:24,480 --> 01:20:28,380
like giant apes may have been around more in the past.

2029
01:20:28,840 --> 01:20:31,840
So as stories get passed down the line

2030
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:35,020
and as people move from place to place

2031
01:20:35,020 --> 01:20:36,620
and pass on these stories,

2032
01:20:36,860 --> 01:20:37,160
like there,

2033
01:20:37,900 --> 01:20:38,400
you can,

2034
01:20:39,120 --> 01:20:41,040
like the way storytelling works,

2035
01:20:41,040 --> 01:20:42,480
whisper down the line,

2036
01:20:42,580 --> 01:20:44,040
you can logic out that,

2037
01:20:44,260 --> 01:20:47,080
oh, that could be where the Yeti legends came from.

2038
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:47,680
Right.

2039
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:49,380
The Grassman is Ohio,

2040
01:20:49,680 --> 01:20:51,080
is Ohio specifically.

2041
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:54,200
The Grassman, also known as the Ohio Grassman

2042
01:20:54,200 --> 01:20:57,520
or the Kenmore Grassman or Orange Eyes.

2043
01:20:58,600 --> 01:21:00,360
And then there's like drawings of specifically,

2044
01:21:00,520 --> 01:21:01,760
like this could be the Grassman

2045
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:03,540
who looks kind of more like a Remwell.

2046
01:21:03,560 --> 01:21:04,080
It looks like Watto.

2047
01:21:04,340 --> 01:21:04,700
Whoa.

2048
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:08,160
But then there's more like a Bigfoot type Grassman.

2049
01:21:08,780 --> 01:21:10,000
So it is interesting.

2050
01:21:11,300 --> 01:21:14,700
Truly, honestly, all this IP being turned into,

2051
01:21:14,760 --> 01:21:16,040
it's just kind of sitting there.

2052
01:21:16,120 --> 01:21:16,700
Jersey Devil,

2053
01:21:16,840 --> 01:21:19,080
no one's made like a Jersey Devil part of the movie.

2054
01:21:19,120 --> 01:21:20,300
I don't think I know about the Jersey Devil.

2055
01:21:20,300 --> 01:21:22,560
Oh, the Jersey, the story of the Jersey Devil.

2056
01:21:22,980 --> 01:21:23,980
Springsteen has a song,

2057
01:21:24,520 --> 01:21:26,800
or was he covering the song Jersey Devil?

2058
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:28,080
I think so.

2059
01:21:28,500 --> 01:21:30,280
There's a hockey team, the Jersey Devils, too.

2060
01:21:30,340 --> 01:21:33,420
The Jersey Devil goes more back to like Puritan times

2061
01:21:33,420 --> 01:21:35,600
where it's like the devil impregnated a woman.

2062
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:36,640
Uh-oh, whoa.

2063
01:21:36,980 --> 01:21:37,720
He means business.

2064
01:21:38,100 --> 01:21:41,560
The devil impregnated like Goody Proctor and the child.

2065
01:21:41,740 --> 01:21:42,480
Geez.

2066
01:21:42,760 --> 01:21:45,520
This half beast, half demon, half man.

2067
01:21:46,160 --> 01:21:46,620
It does, yeah,

2068
01:21:46,660 --> 01:21:49,460
feel like a dark universe of all these characters

2069
01:21:49,460 --> 01:21:50,880
is called for.

2070
01:21:51,280 --> 01:21:52,240
Yeah, absolutely.

2071
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:54,780
All, yeah, no one owns these characters.

2072
01:21:55,340 --> 01:21:57,260
How big is the devil's sperm?

2073
01:21:57,560 --> 01:22:00,960
But I feel like- Is it pitch black?

2074
01:22:01,780 --> 01:22:04,240
Maybe it's just because it's older.

2075
01:22:04,520 --> 01:22:09,720
It feels like there is more of a story of the Yeti

2076
01:22:09,720 --> 01:22:10,780
than like Bigfoot.

2077
01:22:10,940 --> 01:22:12,160
Like I don't know what Bigfoot,

2078
01:22:12,620 --> 01:22:15,440
Bigfoot just seems like he's trying to get by.

2079
01:22:15,460 --> 01:22:17,600
There's more Bigfoot though than you realize.

2080
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:21,040
There's more like Bigfoot mythology and stuff like that.

2081
01:22:21,040 --> 01:22:21,740
I think there is that.

2082
01:22:21,740 --> 01:22:23,220
We're gonna meet Bigfoot at Knott's soon enough.

2083
01:22:23,380 --> 01:22:24,560
Oh, it's so exciting, yeah.

2084
01:22:25,640 --> 01:22:27,560
So I guess Knott's is getting in on some of this

2085
01:22:27,560 --> 01:22:28,800
now that I think about it.

2086
01:22:30,120 --> 01:22:31,180
But yeah, it makes sense like Yeti

2087
01:22:31,180 --> 01:22:34,320
that there's probably a longer time

2088
01:22:34,320 --> 01:22:36,940
people have had to develop the legend of it,

2089
01:22:37,100 --> 01:22:39,540
which makes it loom a little larger, I guess.

2090
01:22:39,800 --> 01:22:46,520
Well, and then you have the legend of the Everest Yeti.

2091
01:22:46,940 --> 01:22:47,420
Yes.

2092
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:51,240
Which is sort of the big thing about this ride.

2093
01:22:51,380 --> 01:22:53,280
And if you aren't privy to this,

2094
01:22:53,780 --> 01:22:56,120
if you watch this Travel Channel special,

2095
01:22:56,820 --> 01:22:57,540
well, that's okay.

2096
01:22:57,580 --> 01:22:59,940
So the Yeti, you hear the Yeti,

2097
01:23:00,540 --> 01:23:03,500
then at some point you see a projection,

2098
01:23:03,680 --> 01:23:06,400
kind of a silhouette of him tearing the track apart.

2099
01:23:06,720 --> 01:23:08,180
The whole thing is kind of a chase

2100
01:23:08,180 --> 01:23:09,440
in and out of the mountain,

2101
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:13,420
voiding the Yeti, and then you come face to face with him.

2102
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:15,780
And he is a gigantic animatronic

2103
01:23:15,780 --> 01:23:20,560
who is meant to swing and swipe at your car.

2104
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:22,220
And in the Travel Channel special,

2105
01:23:22,280 --> 01:23:24,540
you see the programmer, you see Rody,

2106
01:23:24,640 --> 01:23:26,860
and you see this thing in action.

2107
01:23:27,040 --> 01:23:28,680
It is eerie. Unbelievable.

2108
01:23:29,080 --> 01:23:30,280
It is so surreal.

2109
01:23:30,400 --> 01:23:31,680
It looks like animation.

2110
01:23:31,960 --> 01:23:33,380
Is it 30 feet tall?

2111
01:23:33,400 --> 01:23:35,300
Like is it 30 feet tall, something like that?

2112
01:23:35,300 --> 01:23:36,200
Something like that.

2113
01:23:36,260 --> 01:23:37,500
Joe Rody is standing next to it,

2114
01:23:37,540 --> 01:23:40,640
and the scale of the hand, the claw,

2115
01:23:40,700 --> 01:23:43,740
like next to Joe Rody's head is staggering.

2116
01:23:43,940 --> 01:23:45,580
And yeah, it's like,

2117
01:23:45,840 --> 01:23:47,780
because I had never, it stopped working

2118
01:23:47,780 --> 01:23:49,160
by the time I went on it,

2119
01:23:49,280 --> 01:23:51,820
and seeing it in the special was actually

2120
01:23:51,820 --> 01:23:54,780
the first time I had seen it working in some capacity.

2121
01:23:55,140 --> 01:23:59,060
And it is like nothing robot-wise I've ever seen.

2122
01:23:59,100 --> 01:24:01,700
I don't think anything has come close to being him.

2123
01:24:01,740 --> 01:24:02,260
Trying to think.

2124
01:24:02,320 --> 01:24:03,680
It's so fluid.

2125
01:24:03,940 --> 01:24:06,780
So fluid, and the scope of it, the size of it.

2126
01:24:06,780 --> 01:24:09,920
The biggest animatronic imagineering ever made.

2127
01:24:10,240 --> 01:24:11,620
And it's, yeah, it's terrifying.

2128
01:24:11,620 --> 01:24:13,560
Like I almost, you know,

2129
01:24:13,900 --> 01:24:15,800
well, obviously I want it to swipe at me,

2130
01:24:15,820 --> 01:24:16,500
but I'm saying like,

2131
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:18,460
oh god, I would have been so freaked out

2132
01:24:18,460 --> 01:24:20,040
with this giant robot,

2133
01:24:20,360 --> 01:24:22,840
which of course I want it fixed so it can swipe at me.

2134
01:24:23,280 --> 01:24:25,480
But yeah, it's terrifying.

2135
01:24:26,040 --> 01:24:28,700
Yeah, yeah, but at some point,

2136
01:24:28,900 --> 01:24:30,060
and maybe you guys know the facts,

2137
01:24:30,240 --> 01:24:32,260
I don't offhand, but it was pretty quick

2138
01:24:32,260 --> 01:24:35,200
into the operation of this thing, it stopped working.

2139
01:24:35,280 --> 01:24:36,180
I think it was on and off.

2140
01:24:36,180 --> 01:24:36,940
In the first two years.

2141
01:24:37,020 --> 01:24:38,220
It was on and off a little bit,

2142
01:24:38,220 --> 01:24:39,080
and then it just stopped.

2143
01:24:39,280 --> 01:24:39,820
Something like that.

2144
01:24:39,820 --> 01:24:42,040
I think it was around 2008 maybe.

2145
01:24:43,240 --> 01:24:45,280
Which, you know, as the recession is starting,

2146
01:24:45,560 --> 01:24:48,440
like Disney not exactly throwing money around on repair work.

2147
01:24:49,300 --> 01:24:51,640
At the 2013 D23,

2148
01:24:52,060 --> 01:24:52,760
Rodie said,

2149
01:24:53,580 --> 01:24:55,480
it's really hard to fix,

2150
01:24:55,700 --> 01:24:57,180
but we are working on it.

2151
01:24:57,200 --> 01:24:59,780
I was in the room for this at that D23.

2152
01:25:00,180 --> 01:25:01,300
Cause somebody, I remember somebody going,

2153
01:25:01,420 --> 01:25:02,820
when is the Yeti going to be fixed?

2154
01:25:03,020 --> 01:25:05,040
And he's like, I will do it.

2155
01:25:05,080 --> 01:25:06,340
You have to understand,

2156
01:25:06,520 --> 01:25:09,000
it's a giant complicated machine

2157
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:12,360
sitting on top of like a 46 foot tall tower

2158
01:25:12,360 --> 01:25:14,460
in the middle of a finished building.

2159
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:17,040
So yeah, so the problem with it,

2160
01:25:17,220 --> 01:25:18,700
that at least how I understand it,

2161
01:25:18,700 --> 01:25:20,400
is that they just,

2162
01:25:21,020 --> 01:25:22,280
for like, what they've done now

2163
01:25:22,280 --> 01:25:24,400
with the Navi Shaman of Song, for instance,

2164
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:27,500
is you can pull the robot out if it needs maintenance.

2165
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:29,860
They cannot pull the Yeti out.

2166
01:25:30,080 --> 01:25:32,620
It is built into the structure of the ride.

2167
01:25:33,140 --> 01:25:36,160
So whatever the problems are with it,

2168
01:25:36,160 --> 01:25:39,020
they would have to shut the whole ride down

2169
01:25:39,020 --> 01:25:41,560
and like rebuild the robot or something.

2170
01:25:41,600 --> 01:25:44,020
Like it's just, it's not easy to repair it

2171
01:25:44,020 --> 01:25:45,440
in its current state.

2172
01:25:45,900 --> 01:25:49,400
And some, and I bet the Disney number crunchers

2173
01:25:49,400 --> 01:25:51,840
might say, look at the line.

2174
01:25:52,100 --> 01:25:54,300
Do you see a problem with this?

2175
01:25:54,300 --> 01:25:58,120
Because what they did is that they,

2176
01:25:58,680 --> 01:26:01,100
the Yeti is there and the figure is very impressive,

2177
01:26:01,100 --> 01:26:03,820
but it doesn't really move and they flash lights at it.

2178
01:26:03,820 --> 01:26:06,060
And this is called the B mode,

2179
01:26:06,060 --> 01:26:09,420
or as fans have dubbed it online, disco Yeti.

2180
01:26:09,740 --> 01:26:11,240
Because lights are just flashing on it.

2181
01:26:11,260 --> 01:26:15,380
And I think the Disney argument is probably,

2182
01:26:16,160 --> 01:26:17,860
like the satisfaction with this ride

2183
01:26:17,860 --> 01:26:20,920
is still extremely high if we shut it down for a long time.

2184
01:26:20,920 --> 01:26:22,520
We aren't eating those people.

2185
01:26:22,860 --> 01:26:24,760
And like, are people complaining

2186
01:26:24,760 --> 01:26:28,820
beyond the fans who actually know what it's supposed to do?

2187
01:26:29,420 --> 01:26:30,860
And I see that argument.

2188
01:26:31,120 --> 01:26:33,620
However, now, having watched that,

2189
01:26:34,100 --> 01:26:35,580
yeah, it's incredible.

2190
01:26:35,700 --> 01:26:36,180
It's incredible.

2191
01:26:36,180 --> 01:26:37,420
We gotta get it going again.

2192
01:26:37,720 --> 01:26:39,160
I know he said periodically,

2193
01:26:39,340 --> 01:26:41,320
like I think maybe I figured out a way to do it,

2194
01:26:41,320 --> 01:26:43,340
but I think like the problem is,

2195
01:26:43,500 --> 01:26:46,240
is that whatever is not working on it is so bad

2196
01:26:46,240 --> 01:26:48,260
that I think it needs to like kind of be replaced,

2197
01:26:48,480 --> 01:26:51,740
but you can't take it out of the ride

2198
01:26:51,740 --> 01:26:54,860
without a massive amount of construction.

2199
01:26:55,200 --> 01:26:58,820
Now, eventually you'll hit like the 20 year mark

2200
01:26:58,820 --> 01:27:01,680
or something like 2006.

2201
01:27:01,680 --> 01:27:06,080
So we're at like 12, 13-ish years now.

2202
01:27:06,120 --> 01:27:09,080
So eventually you need to do major maintenance

2203
01:27:09,080 --> 01:27:11,080
on all these rides and shut them down

2204
01:27:11,080 --> 01:27:12,400
for an extended period of time.

2205
01:27:12,420 --> 01:27:16,500
And if I had to guess, that would be when they would do it.

2206
01:27:16,540 --> 01:27:20,200
Now, last summer, July 2018, someone said,

2207
01:27:20,640 --> 01:27:21,740
how about this Yeti?

2208
01:27:21,780 --> 01:27:24,100
Which I'm sure Joe loves hearing people say,

2209
01:27:24,300 --> 01:27:25,560
like what's the deal with the Yeti?

2210
01:27:27,120 --> 01:27:30,520
And he literally tweeted, we're still working on it.

2211
01:27:31,320 --> 01:27:33,000
Articles, people writing articles,

2212
01:27:33,320 --> 01:27:34,820
like the Yeti is being fixed.

2213
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:36,340
And it's like, he literally said,

2214
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:38,560
we're still, we're working on it.

2215
01:27:38,600 --> 01:27:39,760
Like that's it.

2216
01:27:40,100 --> 01:27:43,260
Like are people that hungry for clicks?

2217
01:27:43,440 --> 01:27:45,280
Like that, I guess so.

2218
01:27:45,320 --> 01:27:48,000
And also like clicks from how many people?

2219
01:27:48,680 --> 01:27:48,980
I guess a lot, I guess.

2220
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:50,540
That's true, for how many people?

2221
01:27:50,920 --> 01:27:52,040
I guess we would click on it.

2222
01:27:52,040 --> 01:27:53,460
I'd be like, oh good, they're fixing it.

2223
01:27:53,540 --> 01:27:55,520
But like anytime he's asked about it

2224
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:57,640
and he's pretty gracious, he's like,

2225
01:27:58,120 --> 01:28:00,520
yeah, it was an absurd undertaking

2226
01:28:00,520 --> 01:28:04,040
and it's not insane that it went wrong.

2227
01:28:04,520 --> 01:28:05,260
Yeah, it's so interesting.

2228
01:28:05,780 --> 01:28:08,840
These people are geniuses at making this stuff.

2229
01:28:09,140 --> 01:28:11,440
But then there'll always be something where it was like,

2230
01:28:11,480 --> 01:28:13,420
obviously this was a huge problem

2231
01:28:13,420 --> 01:28:15,320
because they didn't allow themselves

2232
01:28:15,320 --> 01:28:18,600
to have an easy way to fix it.

2233
01:28:18,760 --> 01:28:20,980
So you're like, oh, that seems like a crazy oversight.

2234
01:28:21,720 --> 01:28:23,280
Everything else is perfect in this,

2235
01:28:23,280 --> 01:28:25,260
for whatever reason they didn't figure out how to do this.

2236
01:28:25,960 --> 01:28:27,960
And then they learn the lesson

2237
01:28:27,960 --> 01:28:29,760
with a much smaller animatronic,

2238
01:28:29,800 --> 01:28:32,080
which is the Navi one on the river ride.

2239
01:28:32,260 --> 01:28:33,360
But then I don't know if you've heard,

2240
01:28:33,460 --> 01:28:35,340
I've got this from Jim Hill's podcast,

2241
01:28:35,760 --> 01:28:38,440
is that the problem with that ride now

2242
01:28:38,440 --> 01:28:40,480
that they're running into is that

2243
01:28:40,480 --> 01:28:44,340
the both Flight of Passage and the River Adventure

2244
01:28:44,340 --> 01:28:47,240
or whatever it's called, they're in the same show building.

2245
01:28:47,320 --> 01:28:48,240
They're on top of each other.

2246
01:28:48,240 --> 01:28:49,080
They're on top of each other.

2247
01:28:49,240 --> 01:28:51,160
So if the fire alarm goes off on one,

2248
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:54,160
they both have to empty the lines.

2249
01:28:55,200 --> 01:28:56,580
So that's another thing where you're like,

2250
01:28:56,600 --> 01:28:57,640
ah, these are geniuses.

2251
01:28:57,640 --> 01:28:58,840
And then there's this one thing,

2252
01:28:58,860 --> 01:29:00,160
which of course at the time they were probably like,

2253
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:01,280
oh, it'll be so much easier.

2254
01:29:01,280 --> 01:29:02,340
It'll be one building.

2255
01:29:02,660 --> 01:29:05,120
And then no one ever thought of like, oh shit,

2256
01:29:05,140 --> 01:29:06,500
when the fire alarm goes off,

2257
01:29:06,940 --> 01:29:09,180
both buildings have to clear out,

2258
01:29:09,480 --> 01:29:11,560
which really is a big pain in the ass.

2259
01:29:11,600 --> 01:29:14,920
And people have booked their Flight of Passage

2260
01:29:14,920 --> 01:29:16,520
many months ahead of time.

2261
01:29:16,600 --> 01:29:17,140
That's how crazy this thing is.

2262
01:29:17,140 --> 01:29:19,120
Right, and people could have been in line

2263
01:29:19,120 --> 01:29:21,160
for Flight of Passage for two hours.

2264
01:29:22,500 --> 01:29:25,300
And because something went wrong in the other ride,

2265
01:29:25,700 --> 01:29:27,420
they have to evacuate the line.

2266
01:29:27,660 --> 01:29:29,320
I don't know if there's a system in place of them

2267
01:29:29,320 --> 01:29:31,240
giving them something to come back.

2268
01:29:31,240 --> 01:29:34,040
I don't know, but anyway, it's just interesting to hear,

2269
01:29:34,260 --> 01:29:36,160
there'll be one crazy oversight.

2270
01:29:36,300 --> 01:29:37,880
Everything else is almost perfect.

2271
01:29:38,280 --> 01:29:39,400
And then there'll be just one mistake.

2272
01:29:39,440 --> 01:29:43,440
Yeah, like 5,000 correct decisions.

2273
01:29:43,700 --> 01:29:47,040
Right, and then one that they never thought of.

2274
01:29:47,080 --> 01:29:48,280
Because they must have been like,

2275
01:29:48,280 --> 01:29:49,060
oh, this is a great idea.

2276
01:29:49,120 --> 01:29:50,080
We'll put them in the same building.

2277
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:53,440
Because when you are doing unprecedented types of,

2278
01:29:53,720 --> 01:29:56,520
I think that's a thing that I really like about,

2279
01:29:56,860 --> 01:30:00,100
if a movie is having story problems,

2280
01:30:00,300 --> 01:30:02,620
you can look at other movies for inspiration,

2281
01:30:02,780 --> 01:30:05,920
you know how movies are generally supposed to go.

2282
01:30:06,620 --> 01:30:08,740
Or if a director drops out,

2283
01:30:08,820 --> 01:30:10,380
you can bring in another director.

2284
01:30:10,880 --> 01:30:12,760
Theme parks are every, I mean,

2285
01:30:12,840 --> 01:30:14,460
the really good theme park rides,

2286
01:30:14,900 --> 01:30:17,160
every one of them has never been done before

2287
01:30:17,160 --> 01:30:18,820
and to some extent will never be done again.

2288
01:30:19,080 --> 01:30:23,400
So how do you solve, how do you even think of the problem?

2289
01:30:23,840 --> 01:30:25,520
Right, exactly, how would you anticipate?

2290
01:30:25,680 --> 01:30:28,040
I mean, yeah, when we're saying like,

2291
01:30:28,120 --> 01:30:28,920
they thought of so many things,

2292
01:30:29,180 --> 01:30:31,940
how do they anticipate those 500 things

2293
01:30:31,940 --> 01:30:34,160
that could have gone wrong and they're fine with it?

2294
01:30:34,160 --> 01:30:36,820
And then the one thing, yeah, it is crazy.

2295
01:30:37,420 --> 01:30:38,820
Because yeah, ideally when you're building

2296
01:30:38,820 --> 01:30:41,760
one of these giant e-tickets, it's so original,

2297
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:43,720
it's so interesting and creative

2298
01:30:43,720 --> 01:30:45,600
that the amount of challenges,

2299
01:30:45,820 --> 01:30:48,560
we don't even know, they're not documented.

2300
01:30:49,120 --> 01:30:50,680
There are weeks of just somebody going like,

2301
01:30:50,960 --> 01:30:52,040
oh shit, you know that thing we thought

2302
01:30:52,040 --> 01:30:54,120
was gonna be easy, it's impossible.

2303
01:30:54,620 --> 01:30:57,940
So let's fix it and then maybe that doesn't get documented,

2304
01:30:58,220 --> 01:30:59,760
they might even forget about it

2305
01:30:59,760 --> 01:31:01,200
because there's so many other terrible,

2306
01:31:01,200 --> 01:31:02,900
impossible things that they've overcome.

2307
01:31:03,420 --> 01:31:07,360
So it would be crazy to truly get a log of

2308
01:31:07,360 --> 01:31:10,660
from start to finish of everything,

2309
01:31:10,880 --> 01:31:12,960
not just the truncated version of going,

2310
01:31:13,180 --> 01:31:14,460
oh yeah, there's just a minor problem

2311
01:31:14,460 --> 01:31:15,880
with the paint for a month.

2312
01:31:16,400 --> 01:31:16,940
Right, right.

2313
01:31:16,980 --> 01:31:18,940
Because that stuff must happen all the time.

2314
01:31:19,680 --> 01:31:23,940
Like just these unglamorous, the unsexy problems too.

2315
01:31:24,080 --> 01:31:26,740
You see in the special that they wanted it to look like

2316
01:31:26,740 --> 01:31:28,340
there was snow blowing off the mountain

2317
01:31:28,340 --> 01:31:33,400
so then they had to figure out how to shoot mist out

2318
01:31:33,400 --> 01:31:37,320
so it looked like snow that was blowing in the wind.

2319
01:31:37,620 --> 01:31:38,120
I gotcha.

2320
01:31:38,920 --> 01:31:43,940
Yeah, so Yeti, I've heard like,

2321
01:31:44,140 --> 01:31:45,480
I think he was saying for a while

2322
01:31:45,480 --> 01:31:47,300
it seemed like they might be able to just sort of like

2323
01:31:47,300 --> 01:31:49,000
put a new arm on it or something

2324
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:50,720
and like just sort of have the arm swiping

2325
01:31:50,720 --> 01:31:52,740
but it would be a different mechanism perhaps.

2326
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:56,480
But I don't know if that's out the window.

2327
01:31:56,640 --> 01:31:58,720
I'm not sure where he's, we'll ask him obviously,

2328
01:31:58,720 --> 01:32:00,800
it'll be a 30 minutes of grilling rhodium.

2329
01:32:01,180 --> 01:32:02,780
What have you thought about, what have you tried?

2330
01:32:02,920 --> 01:32:04,180
Here's some ideas we have.

2331
01:32:04,740 --> 01:32:06,600
Yeah, but like I mean that,

2332
01:32:06,760 --> 01:32:10,220
I have to imagine it's frustrating that like you put some,

2333
01:32:10,280 --> 01:32:12,500
like you said, you put so much time and care

2334
01:32:12,500 --> 01:32:14,500
in all of this stuff and something goes wrong

2335
01:32:14,500 --> 01:32:17,660
and everyone just has the same stupid question

2336
01:32:17,660 --> 01:32:18,200
that they lose.

2337
01:32:18,400 --> 01:32:21,460
So Joe, we gotta ask, when are you fixing that Yeti?

2338
01:32:21,580 --> 01:32:24,260
It's like, cool, you're, like there were people that,

2339
01:32:24,480 --> 01:32:27,960
bless their hearts, the tour I was watching

2340
01:32:27,960 --> 01:32:29,880
where the Imagineers are showing them all this stuff,

2341
01:32:30,020 --> 01:32:33,420
there were clearly some knowledgeable-ish people

2342
01:32:33,420 --> 01:32:37,300
on the tour who was like, I have a very specific question

2343
01:32:37,300 --> 01:32:39,900
and the Imagineers were like, yeah,

2344
01:32:40,700 --> 01:32:45,600
I've been working at Fantasyland for about five years now,

2345
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:50,140
getting that rebuilt, so I don't quite know the answer

2346
01:32:50,140 --> 01:32:54,400
to that or like, yeah, answering other people's questions.

2347
01:32:54,440 --> 01:32:56,860
So it's like, just if you're in a situation like this, folks,

2348
01:32:57,300 --> 01:32:58,700
be cool, be cool, play cool.

2349
01:32:58,940 --> 01:33:00,020
That's one that I don't,

2350
01:33:00,680 --> 01:33:02,620
having looked into this issue a little deeper,

2351
01:33:02,740 --> 01:33:05,940
I think I have sympathy for this whole Yeti issue

2352
01:33:05,940 --> 01:33:08,280
more than I did when we started.

2353
01:33:08,400 --> 01:33:10,740
And they pulled off an incredible ride

2354
01:33:10,740 --> 01:33:13,840
and even the Yeti itself is still very cool.

2355
01:33:14,180 --> 01:33:15,880
It's just not that one last.

2356
01:33:16,320 --> 01:33:18,240
Yeah, I mean, I'm trying to think too,

2357
01:33:18,840 --> 01:33:22,140
without the Yeti, it is still awesome.

2358
01:33:22,760 --> 01:33:24,380
Even if you took the robot out

2359
01:33:24,380 --> 01:33:25,500
and it wasn't ever part of it,

2360
01:33:25,540 --> 01:33:26,900
it's like, wow, what a great ride.

2361
01:33:27,340 --> 01:33:30,060
But yes, having a fully terrifying 30-foot Yeti

2362
01:33:30,060 --> 01:33:31,700
obviously would be the oomph,

2363
01:33:31,820 --> 01:33:33,400
the thing that really makes you go, wow.

2364
01:33:33,560 --> 01:33:35,900
But it'll be such an, when they do figure it out,

2365
01:33:35,900 --> 01:33:38,580
it'll be like, what a juice up of this thing.

2366
01:33:38,680 --> 01:33:41,160
When they added the fire effects to Big Thunder,

2367
01:33:41,620 --> 01:33:42,920
it'll be really exciting.

2368
01:33:43,340 --> 01:33:46,080
Everyone will be, and then it'll break in six days,

2369
01:33:46,200 --> 01:33:47,360
and then back to square one.

2370
01:33:47,360 --> 01:33:49,020
But they'll have hopefully figured out the system

2371
01:33:49,020 --> 01:33:51,740
to remove it or to fix at that point.

2372
01:33:51,820 --> 01:33:54,020
Although there'll be another problem they didn't anticipate.

2373
01:33:54,720 --> 01:33:58,300
Possibly, it's hard now too to take this down for too long

2374
01:33:58,300 --> 01:33:59,700
because anything you can do

2375
01:33:59,700 --> 01:34:01,940
to draw people away from Avatar

2376
01:34:01,940 --> 01:34:04,140
because the lines are still so long.

2377
01:34:04,140 --> 01:34:06,100
It would be nice if they open up another e-ticket

2378
01:34:06,100 --> 01:34:08,600
to Animal Kingdom, and then this could go down.

2379
01:34:08,820 --> 01:34:10,140
That would feel good.

2380
01:34:10,300 --> 01:34:12,080
But I don't think, this park honestly

2381
01:34:12,080 --> 01:34:17,660
is probably my favorite of the four right now.

2382
01:34:18,980 --> 01:34:19,660
I gotta get down.

2383
01:34:19,660 --> 01:34:22,620
I gotta see it with the new stuff and go on this ride.

2384
01:34:22,780 --> 01:34:23,960
It's all the things we've talked about.

2385
01:34:24,100 --> 01:34:26,200
It's like, this park ages the best.

2386
01:34:26,720 --> 01:34:28,000
It's an original park.

2387
01:34:28,080 --> 01:34:29,620
Interesting food and drinks.

2388
01:34:29,620 --> 01:34:30,520
It's interesting food and drinks.

2389
01:34:30,760 --> 01:34:33,180
It's just, the theming obviously off the charts.

2390
01:34:33,180 --> 01:34:35,360
Doesn't have weird vacant areas right now,

2391
01:34:35,380 --> 01:34:36,380
which all the other ones do.

2392
01:34:36,580 --> 01:34:39,640
And even if it does, it would probably obscure them.

2393
01:34:40,160 --> 01:34:41,900
Just because it's so filled with trees.

2394
01:34:42,480 --> 01:34:43,360
Beautiful foliage.

2395
01:34:45,120 --> 01:34:49,720
I could see if they ever, hopefully will.

2396
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:51,880
But I think that may be in a lot of ways

2397
01:34:51,880 --> 01:34:54,200
this doesn't need it as much as the other parks.

2398
01:34:54,960 --> 01:34:56,440
So Everest will probably be open.

2399
01:34:56,440 --> 01:34:59,220
I don't know if there's any refurbishment on the schedule.

2400
01:34:59,220 --> 01:34:59,680
Yeah.

2401
01:35:00,540 --> 01:35:02,200
Probably not before the anniversary at least.

2402
01:35:03,220 --> 01:35:05,540
We were talking earlier,

2403
01:35:05,560 --> 01:35:08,820
we were recording another show about personnel on rides.

2404
01:35:09,680 --> 01:35:12,480
The person doing the Yeti Roars,

2405
01:35:12,700 --> 01:35:14,480
the voice actor, I think is very,

2406
01:35:14,800 --> 01:35:18,820
has very interesting theme park roles.

2407
01:35:19,420 --> 01:35:22,800
His name is Fred Tatasciore?

2408
01:35:23,060 --> 01:35:25,520
I am not sure how to pronounce the last name.

2409
01:35:25,780 --> 01:35:27,460
His theme park roles though include

2410
01:35:27,460 --> 01:35:29,600
Space Mountain Safety Narrator,

2411
01:35:30,720 --> 01:35:32,240
Star Tours the Adventure Continues,

2412
01:35:32,240 --> 01:35:33,760
he's a Gungan pilot.

2413
01:35:35,100 --> 01:35:37,280
And on Guardians of the Galaxy Mission Breakout,

2414
01:35:37,500 --> 01:35:38,960
he's Baby Groot.

2415
01:35:39,320 --> 01:35:39,760
Really?

2416
01:35:39,780 --> 01:35:40,320
Yeah.

2417
01:35:40,580 --> 01:35:40,960
Wow.

2418
01:35:41,460 --> 01:35:44,000
So Vin Diesel is not Baby Groot.

2419
01:35:44,180 --> 01:35:44,800
Apparently not.

2420
01:35:44,960 --> 01:35:46,780
He's the only one that didn't do the voice?

2421
01:35:47,340 --> 01:35:48,820
I guess, this says.

2422
01:35:49,120 --> 01:35:51,160
Cause I think they all are doing the voices,

2423
01:35:51,500 --> 01:35:51,760
or obviously.

2424
01:35:51,760 --> 01:35:52,840
I thought so, I mean the actors are.

2425
01:35:52,840 --> 01:35:54,280
Not they all, obviously the actors are doing

2426
01:35:54,280 --> 01:35:56,580
their own voices, it's not a different voice in their body.

2427
01:35:56,600 --> 01:35:57,420
But yeah, that was the credit.

2428
01:35:57,460 --> 01:36:00,460
He also has a lot of video game and animation roles too.

2429
01:36:00,620 --> 01:36:01,100
Cool dude.

2430
01:36:01,100 --> 01:36:02,700
Why can't I picture the Space Mountain?

2431
01:36:03,220 --> 01:36:05,060
What is the Space Mountain Safety?

2432
01:36:05,120 --> 01:36:07,360
Is he like the talking head?

2433
01:36:07,780 --> 01:36:09,480
Cause there's a guy in like the Space Mountain.

2434
01:36:09,480 --> 01:36:10,000
There's a guy in the queue.

2435
01:36:10,640 --> 01:36:11,260
Yeah, queue.

2436
01:36:11,300 --> 01:36:12,760
But I don't know if that meant Space Mountain

2437
01:36:12,760 --> 01:36:14,920
in Florida or Anaheim,

2438
01:36:14,920 --> 01:36:16,700
and I can't really remember Florida's.

2439
01:36:16,700 --> 01:36:18,800
Like Space Mountain is a, well whatever,

2440
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,500
when he's explaining it in the video, I wonder.

2441
01:36:21,900 --> 01:36:22,360
Yeah.

2442
01:36:22,360 --> 01:36:22,920
I'm gonna look that up.

2443
01:36:23,020 --> 01:36:24,820
Oh it's that guy who's roaring a lot.

2444
01:36:25,160 --> 01:36:25,840
That's what it is.

2445
01:36:26,220 --> 01:36:27,360
Oh yeah, the roaring man.

2446
01:36:28,160 --> 01:36:31,140
I like a quick thing we didn't kinda mention,

2447
01:36:31,600 --> 01:36:33,980
is I like, much like on Splash Mountain,

2448
01:36:34,540 --> 01:36:36,600
there's kind of a fake out in the ride,

2449
01:36:37,140 --> 01:36:41,440
where it goes up and then you see the train shoot out of it.

2450
01:36:41,640 --> 01:36:43,200
So if you were just looking at the ride,

2451
01:36:43,280 --> 01:36:44,840
kinda like Splash Mountain where,

2452
01:36:45,280 --> 01:36:46,380
if you've never been on it before,

2453
01:36:46,380 --> 01:36:47,340
you don't know the geography,

2454
01:36:47,620 --> 01:36:50,480
so you might assume that that car is going in

2455
01:36:50,480 --> 01:36:52,340
and then pops right out the side.

2456
01:36:52,400 --> 01:36:53,120
Oh I see.

2457
01:36:53,840 --> 01:36:55,480
In the same way that I think Splash Mountain,

2458
01:36:55,500 --> 01:36:56,960
and I don't know if this is to be a fact actually,

2459
01:36:57,180 --> 01:36:58,960
is that once you go up and around,

2460
01:36:59,300 --> 01:37:00,340
you see the first drop.

2461
01:37:00,360 --> 01:37:01,800
And I would imagine if you've been on it,

2462
01:37:02,180 --> 01:37:03,260
you've never been on it before,

2463
01:37:03,440 --> 01:37:04,720
you might think that's the drop.

2464
01:37:04,980 --> 01:37:07,380
Oh sure, if you were all discombobulated, yeah.

2465
01:37:07,540 --> 01:37:09,660
And other being that other Flume rides are just,

2466
01:37:09,660 --> 01:37:11,240
you go up and then you come down.

2467
01:37:11,240 --> 01:37:11,620
Right.

2468
01:37:11,820 --> 01:37:14,220
So hiding all of the stuff inside.

2469
01:37:14,320 --> 01:37:15,540
Yeah and it's the same thing here,

2470
01:37:15,580 --> 01:37:17,140
where it's like all the stuff is hidden,

2471
01:37:17,300 --> 01:37:19,100
and I think that's kind of on purpose.

2472
01:37:19,280 --> 01:37:20,460
I think it's for sure on purpose,

2473
01:37:20,460 --> 01:37:21,540
because they mention in that special.

2474
01:37:21,940 --> 01:37:23,280
But yeah, if you looked at it,

2475
01:37:23,280 --> 01:37:25,060
you'd be like okay, I see, I go up,

2476
01:37:25,060 --> 01:37:28,060
I come out that thing, go around the side,

2477
01:37:28,400 --> 01:37:29,440
and that seems to be it.

2478
01:37:29,440 --> 01:37:32,380
But the whole fun stuff is inside.

2479
01:37:32,640 --> 01:37:35,820
You actually, they pointed out you spiral up that big,

2480
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,900
to get to that lift hill, you kind of curve up the mountain.

2481
01:37:38,900 --> 01:37:41,480
Usually you spiral down on coasters.

2482
01:37:42,560 --> 01:37:44,420
So yeah, both that and Splash Mountain

2483
01:37:44,420 --> 01:37:47,240
really hide what's inside, which is awesome.

2484
01:37:48,960 --> 01:37:50,100
The other thing I found out,

2485
01:37:50,100 --> 01:37:51,780
I thought there was some sea reference.

2486
01:37:52,320 --> 01:37:54,940
I'm obsessed with Disney Society of Explorers,

2487
01:37:55,280 --> 01:37:58,320
I don't think there's any sea references in this line.

2488
01:37:58,740 --> 01:38:01,560
I think this was sort of before they were going

2489
01:38:01,560 --> 01:38:03,540
hall hog with the sea.

2490
01:38:03,600 --> 01:38:08,560
Or they were trying to focus on the authenticity reality.

2491
01:38:09,200 --> 01:38:11,900
So let's add some sea characters to this.

2492
01:38:11,900 --> 01:38:13,020
Let's bring it into the universe,

2493
01:38:13,240 --> 01:38:16,480
make it related so that it is part of the same,

2494
01:38:16,660 --> 01:38:19,280
adventures club and high tower.

2495
01:38:19,820 --> 01:38:24,020
Yeah, E Everest, what would his last name be?

2496
01:38:24,020 --> 01:38:25,600
No, it would be the Yeti.

2497
01:38:25,680 --> 01:38:26,920
Oh, the Yeti is a member of sea?

2498
01:38:26,920 --> 01:38:29,020
The Yeti's like the Hulk, he doesn't come out that often.

2499
01:38:29,620 --> 01:38:32,000
Oh wow, that's a whole new element

2500
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:33,940
to see that there's monsters in the water.

2501
01:38:33,940 --> 01:38:36,080
Or it's Bob and, what was the other?

2502
01:38:36,200 --> 01:38:36,840
Norbu.

2503
01:38:37,080 --> 01:38:38,800
No, I'd rather have Yeti than Norbu.

2504
01:38:38,860 --> 01:38:40,820
Yeah, Bob and Norbu does not belong

2505
01:38:40,820 --> 01:38:42,400
in the adventures, or in sea.

2506
01:38:43,560 --> 01:38:44,040
No.

2507
01:38:44,740 --> 01:38:48,620
I heard a rumor that the new Soren in Tokyo

2508
01:38:48,620 --> 01:38:51,160
will introduce a new member of sea.

2509
01:38:51,940 --> 01:38:53,540
So how about that for a rumor?

2510
01:38:53,540 --> 01:38:55,460
Soren will have more of a story,

2511
01:38:55,580 --> 01:38:56,500
more of a backstory now?

2512
01:38:56,520 --> 01:38:58,040
Yeah, because it's different places.

2513
01:38:58,580 --> 01:39:00,160
And that a man named Patrick

2514
01:39:00,160 --> 01:39:02,000
is taking you on a plane ride?

2515
01:39:02,620 --> 01:39:04,160
Patrick A Soren.

2516
01:39:04,620 --> 01:39:08,200
What if it's just the emperor?

2517
01:39:09,200 --> 01:39:09,800
Of Japan?

2518
01:39:10,040 --> 01:39:11,080
Yeah, it's the emperor of Japan.

2519
01:39:11,220 --> 01:39:14,000
What if we tie together with the emperor's kiss?

2520
01:39:14,500 --> 01:39:16,060
Vi-fake attraction.

2521
01:39:16,060 --> 01:39:19,220
Another one of your most popular jokes from the podcast.

2522
01:39:19,280 --> 01:39:22,480
All right, I feel like you're not being 100% sincere

2523
01:39:22,480 --> 01:39:23,160
in what you said.

2524
01:39:25,220 --> 01:39:27,460
No, no, I am being 100% sincere.

2525
01:39:28,880 --> 01:39:31,360
Yeah, I think we'll tie it into the emperor's kiss.

2526
01:39:31,400 --> 01:39:32,580
If we were doing it.

2527
01:39:32,680 --> 01:39:34,960
But is the emperor in Society of Explorers and Adventures?

2528
01:39:35,860 --> 01:39:37,600
Feels like the emperor should be involved.

2529
01:39:37,760 --> 01:39:39,680
No, I think that's a conflict of interest.

2530
01:39:39,880 --> 01:39:41,940
Yeah, I think there should be a different club

2531
01:39:41,940 --> 01:39:43,600
that he should be a part of.

2532
01:39:43,600 --> 01:39:45,580
Another Disney shared universe club.

2533
01:39:46,120 --> 01:39:46,720
Heads of state.

2534
01:39:47,060 --> 01:39:47,640
Heads of state.

2535
01:39:47,640 --> 01:39:50,580
Him, Teddy Roosevelt, Lincoln, Trump.

2536
01:39:51,160 --> 01:39:52,200
He's a head of state.

2537
01:39:52,640 --> 01:39:53,460
Is that a step?

2538
01:39:53,560 --> 01:39:55,660
All of the Hall of Presidents and the emperor.

2539
01:39:56,160 --> 01:39:58,960
And then who else is a president type in the parks?

2540
01:40:00,300 --> 01:40:01,540
I don't know, not off the top of my head.

2541
01:40:01,560 --> 01:40:02,360
Well, Mayor Jason.

2542
01:40:02,780 --> 01:40:03,340
Mayor Jason?

2543
01:40:03,920 --> 01:40:06,700
Mayor Jason, the princesses of Erin Dale.

2544
01:40:07,580 --> 01:40:08,220
Yes, I think that's right.

2545
01:40:08,340 --> 01:40:11,600
I guess all of the princesses do have jurisdiction.

2546
01:40:12,240 --> 01:40:13,820
They're all heads of state in a way.

2547
01:40:14,040 --> 01:40:16,220
Right, and they've all been, they all know each other

2548
01:40:16,220 --> 01:40:18,960
because we've seen it in Canon and the Wreck-It Ralph movie.

2549
01:40:19,400 --> 01:40:21,260
So just throw the other characters.

2550
01:40:21,260 --> 01:40:22,860
Well, they all know each other online,

2551
01:40:23,320 --> 01:40:24,800
but maybe not in real life.

2552
01:40:24,820 --> 01:40:26,000
They're like Twitter friends.

2553
01:40:26,400 --> 01:40:27,960
Yes, those are all their avatars.

2554
01:40:28,440 --> 01:40:31,520
Princess Vanellope did institute Medicare for all

2555
01:40:31,520 --> 01:40:33,300
for the Candy Crush Kingdom.

2556
01:40:34,080 --> 01:40:35,400
So she's done great things.

2557
01:40:35,520 --> 01:40:36,400
I mean, everyone needs it.

2558
01:40:36,540 --> 01:40:37,620
They're all using so much sugar.

2559
01:40:37,920 --> 01:40:39,820
She's kind of the AOC of...

2560
01:40:39,820 --> 01:40:41,020
Very much so.

2561
01:40:41,300 --> 01:40:42,240
Of the internet.

2562
01:40:42,680 --> 01:40:44,040
That's a good way to think about it.

2563
01:40:44,840 --> 01:40:45,640
Well, what else?

2564
01:40:46,040 --> 01:40:47,360
I don't know, it's just so good.

2565
01:40:47,440 --> 01:40:48,220
The ride is good.

2566
01:40:48,220 --> 01:40:48,920
We're talking about it.

2567
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:50,420
I'm like, I wanna go on it right now.

2568
01:40:51,220 --> 01:40:53,220
Obviously, the plus up is have the Yetis dick

2569
01:40:53,220 --> 01:40:53,800
swinging around.

2570
01:40:54,220 --> 01:40:55,240
That's the plus up they can do.

2571
01:40:55,280 --> 01:40:56,780
You talk about separate mechanisms.

2572
01:40:57,520 --> 01:40:58,740
You could attach that.

2573
01:40:58,780 --> 01:41:00,040
It could be totally disconnected.

2574
01:41:00,800 --> 01:41:03,580
Circa Zong is the name of the mythical village

2575
01:41:03,580 --> 01:41:06,280
that you are visiting in the ride.

2576
01:41:07,160 --> 01:41:09,720
The actual location, if you type Expedition Everest

2577
01:41:09,720 --> 01:41:13,260
into Google, the first result is a Google Maps

2578
01:41:13,260 --> 01:41:16,660
like summary image, and it lists the Expedition Everest

2579
01:41:16,660 --> 01:41:20,940
location as Asia, Kisimi, Florida.

2580
01:41:21,180 --> 01:41:22,000
Yes, I saw that too.

2581
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:22,640
That was fun.

2582
01:41:23,140 --> 01:41:26,620
Does it say Kilimanjaro or something too?

2583
01:41:26,820 --> 01:41:27,620
Or am I thinking of something else?

2584
01:41:27,640 --> 01:41:28,480
No, I don't think so.

2585
01:41:28,920 --> 01:41:33,820
But it's adjacent to Rafiki's Planet Watch train,

2586
01:41:33,960 --> 01:41:35,100
which recently closed.

2587
01:41:35,520 --> 01:41:36,880
I think it might open again though.

2588
01:41:37,260 --> 01:41:37,800
Oh really?

2589
01:41:38,060 --> 01:41:39,380
Yeah, that's another rumor.

2590
01:41:39,620 --> 01:41:41,220
That's a thing about Animal Kingdom.

2591
01:41:41,340 --> 01:41:45,000
It is in the southwest corner of the property

2592
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:48,240
and can feel far away, but it's pretty close

2593
01:41:48,240 --> 01:41:51,680
to one or two of the hotels and Blizzard Beach,

2594
01:41:51,700 --> 01:41:55,220
but from the Magic Kingdom area, it feels far away.

2595
01:41:55,480 --> 01:41:57,340
Yes, that's true from there, but yeah,

2596
01:41:57,780 --> 01:41:58,760
depending on what hotel you're at,

2597
01:41:58,760 --> 01:41:59,920
it's not crazy out of the way.

2598
01:42:00,120 --> 01:42:02,500
Also, if you go two blocks away from Animal Kingdom,

2599
01:42:02,600 --> 01:42:03,600
you hit strip malls.

2600
01:42:03,600 --> 01:42:06,700
You hit Papa John's and Publix.

2601
01:42:07,240 --> 01:42:10,420
Well, and really close to that and Margaritaville.

2602
01:42:11,380 --> 01:42:12,360
The Margaritaville.

2603
01:42:12,360 --> 01:42:12,540
The village.

2604
01:42:12,540 --> 01:42:14,740
Which is pretty close to Animal Kingdom.

2605
01:42:14,920 --> 01:42:15,960
Oh, it's on that?

2606
01:42:16,060 --> 01:42:18,720
So I thought it was closer to like the other.

2607
01:42:19,180 --> 01:42:23,860
Well, when we go on it, maybe this year, altogether maybe,

2608
01:42:25,040 --> 01:42:27,600
we'll look for them, if we can see the Margarita Village

2609
01:42:27,600 --> 01:42:28,720
from the lift hill.

2610
01:42:28,940 --> 01:42:30,540
So I'll do my normal look,

2611
01:42:30,560 --> 01:42:33,700
but we'll look for those water slides and the.

2612
01:42:33,700 --> 01:42:36,620
Gas station directly beneath the water slides.

2613
01:42:37,880 --> 01:42:39,900
And yeah, all the beautiful houses and stuff.

2614
01:42:39,900 --> 01:42:41,700
So the real plus up we're looking for,

2615
01:42:41,700 --> 01:42:44,520
it's really up to the geography of Florida to give us this,

2616
01:42:44,660 --> 01:42:47,260
but we wanna be able to see some mediocre water slides

2617
01:42:47,260 --> 01:42:48,620
from this ride.

2618
01:42:48,840 --> 01:42:51,260
And until then, it won't truly be

2619
01:42:51,260 --> 01:42:52,460
the experience we're looking for.

2620
01:42:52,820 --> 01:42:55,300
Right, and hopefully it's not exactly in front of us,

2621
01:42:55,340 --> 01:42:56,940
in front of like on the other side of the mountain.

2622
01:42:57,280 --> 01:42:58,400
But we'll see.

2623
01:42:58,540 --> 01:43:00,340
Well, this will be an exciting thing to see

2624
01:43:00,340 --> 01:43:01,080
when we're there.

2625
01:43:01,340 --> 01:43:03,000
If we're there, if we go.

2626
01:43:03,780 --> 01:43:04,580
It's possible.

2627
01:43:04,720 --> 01:43:06,120
Yeah, I'd like to.

2628
01:43:06,240 --> 01:43:06,640
Yeah.

2629
01:43:07,700 --> 01:43:10,480
Well, we got expeditions ahead of us.

2630
01:43:11,180 --> 01:43:11,980
We do.

2631
01:43:12,440 --> 01:43:14,880
It's a hell, this is a very fun ride.

2632
01:43:15,240 --> 01:43:18,780
And hey, I just, the plus up I want is to go on it.

2633
01:43:18,860 --> 01:43:20,440
I'm really mad I haven't been on it.

2634
01:43:20,440 --> 01:43:21,400
You're in for a treat.

2635
01:43:21,480 --> 01:43:24,780
Yeah, it's been fun to talk about it regardless,

2636
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:27,260
though my opinions hold no weight,

2637
01:43:27,520 --> 01:43:29,720
other than the pictures look very nice.

2638
01:43:30,400 --> 01:43:30,940
They're very nice.

2639
01:43:30,940 --> 01:43:33,040
And You Survived podcast, the ride,

2643
01:43:39,980 --> 01:43:43,900
The second gate at patreon.com slash podcast, the ride

2644
01:43:43,900 --> 01:43:46,960
and the other specific commands.

2645
01:43:46,960 --> 01:43:49,400
I don't think we have any commands right now.

2646
01:43:49,680 --> 01:43:54,460
If you oddly have a back catalog of mansers,

2647
01:43:55,760 --> 01:43:58,980
do not scour through every episode

2648
01:43:58,980 --> 01:44:01,680
and try to find Mike Carlson at a bar.

2649
01:44:01,920 --> 01:44:03,540
Yeah, I mean, I could tell you what the segment is,

2650
01:44:03,580 --> 01:44:04,340
but I won't.

2651
01:44:04,460 --> 01:44:06,800
Maybe one of these days I'll tell you.

2652
01:44:07,940 --> 01:44:10,180
But it is, I will say that my parents,

2653
01:44:10,680 --> 01:44:12,120
I didn't tell them I did it.

2654
01:44:12,120 --> 01:44:14,920
And then one night at like 11 or midnight,

2655
01:44:15,460 --> 01:44:17,360
my dad woke my mom up

2656
01:44:17,360 --> 01:44:18,660
because he was just watching TV in bed.

2657
01:44:18,760 --> 01:44:20,040
He said, hey, look who's on TV.

2658
01:44:20,120 --> 01:44:22,540
And then it was the embarrassing segment.

2659
01:44:23,280 --> 01:44:25,000
Oh, come on, what are you doing?

2660
01:44:25,180 --> 01:44:27,360
What did your dad see you do?

2661
01:44:27,880 --> 01:44:28,620
Okay.

2662
01:44:30,020 --> 01:44:30,660
Yes.

2663
01:44:31,520 --> 01:44:33,920
Now what's interesting now, I wonder if anybody like

2664
01:44:33,920 --> 01:44:36,340
at the end of the podcast kind of like stops

2665
01:44:36,340 --> 01:44:38,360
when they go, okay, wrapping up podcast, the ride,

2666
01:44:38,660 --> 01:44:38,800
Patreon.

2667
01:44:39,020 --> 01:44:39,940
This is where the real hands.

2668
01:44:39,940 --> 01:44:42,080
They turn the podcast off.

2669
01:44:42,260 --> 01:44:43,920
It's possible right now.

2670
01:44:43,980 --> 01:44:44,880
People might have flipped it.

2671
01:44:44,880 --> 01:44:45,680
Half the audience is out.

2672
01:44:45,980 --> 01:44:47,140
They're just gonna plug their shit,

2673
01:44:47,280 --> 01:44:48,960
but we're getting a big revelation,

2674
01:44:49,100 --> 01:44:50,360
a big twist right at the end.

2675
01:44:50,460 --> 01:44:51,220
A big twist at the end.

2676
01:44:52,320 --> 01:44:56,160
So I didn't, my memory is that I didn't remember

2677
01:44:56,160 --> 01:44:58,340
what it was before.

2678
01:44:58,380 --> 01:45:00,020
I knew the pooping penis thing before,

2679
01:45:00,060 --> 01:45:01,880
but my memory is just sort of like,

2680
01:45:02,040 --> 01:45:04,860
there's a couple different segments you can come down

2681
01:45:05,480 --> 01:45:08,020
and do it, do any, well, we'll see on the day.

2682
01:45:08,060 --> 01:45:09,160
It's very casual.

2683
01:45:09,180 --> 01:45:11,600
And this is the first thing I'd ever been in professionally.

2684
01:45:12,340 --> 01:45:13,140
I went there.

2685
01:45:13,280 --> 01:45:15,100
I knew, I'm like, oh, it's a TV show.

2686
01:45:15,140 --> 01:45:17,120
They'll have hair and makeup and stuff.

2687
01:45:17,560 --> 01:45:19,220
And no, they won't have that.

2688
01:45:19,640 --> 01:45:21,440
I got there, I was wearing like a shitty

2689
01:45:21,440 --> 01:45:23,060
American Apparel green t-shirt.

2690
01:45:23,380 --> 01:45:25,040
That's what I'm wearing on the show.

2691
01:45:25,800 --> 01:45:27,640
No one even took a look at me to see,

2692
01:45:27,680 --> 01:45:29,020
because I remember my hair was a little messed up

2693
01:45:29,020 --> 01:45:30,140
and I was like, oh, I'm sure though,

2694
01:45:30,480 --> 01:45:32,120
they have a person to fix all that,

2695
01:45:32,140 --> 01:45:33,480
because this is a TV show.

2696
01:45:34,260 --> 01:45:35,420
And they did not.

2697
01:45:35,460 --> 01:45:36,460
So I'm sitting in this bar.

2698
01:45:36,460 --> 01:45:41,220
It was our bar, I believe, which is gone now.

2699
01:45:42,780 --> 01:45:44,440
Was it our, whatever, who, it doesn't matter.

2700
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:46,760
It was a small shitty bar before it opened.

2701
01:45:47,180 --> 01:45:48,700
And I'm sitting just sort of in the booth.

2702
01:45:48,740 --> 01:45:51,260
There's a couple of other UCB guys I know.

2703
01:45:52,060 --> 01:45:57,040
And my memory is that the director or somebody goes,

2704
01:45:57,180 --> 01:45:58,700
all right, you, up here.

2705
01:45:59,040 --> 01:46:00,180
And I was like, oh, okay.

2706
01:46:00,220 --> 01:46:01,360
And then they walk over here.

2707
01:46:02,260 --> 01:46:05,920
And then somebody tells me that the man, sir,

2708
01:46:05,920 --> 01:46:07,600
we're going to be answering today,

2709
01:46:08,340 --> 01:46:11,840
is why should you never get a hand job from a British chick?

2710
01:46:11,980 --> 01:46:13,300
Jesus Christ.

2711
01:46:14,080 --> 01:46:15,240
You know this though, right?

2712
01:46:16,060 --> 01:46:17,020
No, I didn't remember.

2713
01:46:17,180 --> 01:46:18,080
I knew you were in one.

2714
01:46:18,240 --> 01:46:20,620
I don't think I, yeah, you must have told me that.

2715
01:46:20,780 --> 01:46:21,760
Maybe I didn't know.

2716
01:46:21,780 --> 01:46:24,180
They all have dirty Thames water on their hands.

2717
01:46:24,300 --> 01:46:29,040
So there's an actress,

2718
01:46:29,680 --> 01:46:32,500
like a model-y type lady.

2719
01:46:32,500 --> 01:46:33,980
She seems nice.

2720
01:46:34,500 --> 01:46:36,260
Very made up.

2721
01:46:37,180 --> 01:46:40,440
Very perfumed also is my memory of it.

2722
01:46:41,100 --> 01:46:44,000
And I am not given a script.

2723
01:46:44,280 --> 01:46:46,240
I'm not told anything ahead of time.

2724
01:46:46,560 --> 01:46:48,340
If you've ever seen the show Mansers,

2725
01:46:48,420 --> 01:46:50,720
most of what people do are bug their eyes out.

2726
01:46:50,800 --> 01:46:52,080
Yes, there's a lot of that.

2727
01:46:52,100 --> 01:46:53,560
A lot of mugging, a lot of that.

2728
01:46:53,940 --> 01:46:57,060
And circa 2008, reality TV production.

2729
01:46:57,080 --> 01:46:58,780
I think it's a little better now,

2730
01:47:00,600 --> 01:47:02,240
but still one thing has not changed.

2731
01:47:02,420 --> 01:47:03,800
The budgets are cheap.

2732
01:47:03,980 --> 01:47:04,800
Yeah, so.

2733
01:47:05,260 --> 01:47:07,400
The labor unions are not present.

2734
01:47:07,560 --> 01:47:08,020
Not present.

2735
01:47:08,120 --> 01:47:09,260
And it's a reenactment.

2736
01:47:09,360 --> 01:47:10,440
The lines are blurred.

2737
01:47:10,620 --> 01:47:12,180
It's hard to say what's going on.

2738
01:47:12,340 --> 01:47:13,520
It's in that reenactment zone.

2739
01:47:14,200 --> 01:47:17,940
So the director just says,

2740
01:47:18,160 --> 01:47:19,460
all right, so here's what's gonna happen.

2741
01:47:19,940 --> 01:47:21,660
And he's just like, believe it or not,

2742
01:47:21,760 --> 01:47:23,820
if you're picturing who directs Mansers,

2743
01:47:23,920 --> 01:47:25,120
that's what he looks like.

2744
01:47:25,380 --> 01:47:26,420
Believe it or not, you know, I'm sure.

2745
01:47:26,880 --> 01:47:27,200
Brett Ratner.

2746
01:47:27,200 --> 01:47:29,120
Yeah, I was gonna go with Ratner too.

2747
01:47:29,120 --> 01:47:31,280
100% this man looked like Brett Ratner.

2748
01:47:31,440 --> 01:47:33,800
He had a ponytail also as my memory of it.

2749
01:47:34,020 --> 01:47:36,060
And the kind of weight that is not

2750
01:47:36,060 --> 01:47:38,800
because you were born stocky, it's weight from drink.

2751
01:47:39,460 --> 01:47:43,000
Yes, it is, yes, it's Jack Daniels exclusively.

2752
01:47:44,040 --> 01:47:46,320
So my memories, he goes, okay,

2753
01:47:46,580 --> 01:47:49,000
so you guys are gonna make out for a while here.

2754
01:47:50,060 --> 01:47:52,520
And like, that wouldn't be comfortable to me.

2755
01:47:52,820 --> 01:47:56,240
Like now, Jason is showing me a picture

2756
01:47:56,520 --> 01:47:58,100
of a person we know.

2757
01:47:58,100 --> 01:48:00,920
We won't say who it is mugging for a Mansers bit.

2758
01:48:02,480 --> 01:48:05,120
So I wouldn't be like super comfortable with that now,

2759
01:48:05,120 --> 01:48:07,580
but I've been on a lot of sets and that sounds

2760
01:48:07,580 --> 01:48:09,200
like I'm bragging, but like I've been whatever.

2761
01:48:09,340 --> 01:48:10,820
It would be a little bit, but I'm fresh.

2762
01:48:10,960 --> 01:48:12,640
I'm 22 years old, 23 years old.

2763
01:48:12,640 --> 01:48:14,980
You don't know that screen actors guild

2764
01:48:14,980 --> 01:48:18,880
has certain regulations for like things like that.

2765
01:48:19,160 --> 01:48:21,060
Whatever, you're supposed to like give people a heads up

2766
01:48:21,060 --> 01:48:22,440
or something of what they're gonna be doing.

2767
01:48:22,540 --> 01:48:23,260
Is that okay?

2768
01:48:23,340 --> 01:48:24,880
You ask them, is that okay or whatever.

2769
01:48:25,100 --> 01:48:27,600
Oh yeah, the whole thing is making out.

2770
01:48:27,640 --> 01:48:29,720
Yeah, there should at least be in the email.

2771
01:48:29,740 --> 01:48:30,620
It should have been in the email.

2772
01:48:30,640 --> 01:48:31,560
It should have been before.

2773
01:48:31,640 --> 01:48:33,780
It should have been some warning of some kind,

2774
01:48:33,860 --> 01:48:36,340
even just like a PA walking over, hey, would you mind?

2775
01:48:36,340 --> 01:48:38,140
Just to say we need you to make out in a scene

2776
01:48:38,140 --> 01:48:41,460
and it is with a human woman, not with Minnie Mouse.

2777
01:48:42,740 --> 01:48:44,220
Yeah, because Minnie I would have been fine with.

2778
01:48:44,420 --> 01:48:46,560
It was a woman I was comfortable with, sure.

2779
01:48:47,460 --> 01:48:51,720
So I'm trying to remember exactly,

2780
01:48:51,720 --> 01:48:54,660
like this is almost 10 years ago.

2781
01:48:56,520 --> 01:48:58,080
You tried to black it out.

2782
01:48:58,100 --> 01:49:00,780
Yeah, I felt traumatized after.

2783
01:49:00,880 --> 01:49:02,040
The service of erasing this memory.

2784
01:49:02,140 --> 01:49:05,240
So my memory of it is that the woman

2785
01:49:05,240 --> 01:49:06,800
who was kind of not next to me at this point,

2786
01:49:06,840 --> 01:49:10,420
kind of on the other side of whatever the bar area,

2787
01:49:10,420 --> 01:49:12,640
like walked somewhere.

2788
01:49:13,320 --> 01:49:17,040
And then I saw a person come up to the director on the set

2789
01:49:17,040 --> 01:49:20,160
and he goes, what?

2790
01:49:21,500 --> 01:49:23,520
She has to make out with him.

2791
01:49:23,680 --> 01:49:25,000
She's an actress.

2792
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:26,700
She has to make out with him.

2793
01:49:26,700 --> 01:49:28,800
That's what she's here to do.

2794
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:30,600
And they're having this conversation

2795
01:49:30,600 --> 01:49:34,100
and I'm just standing five feet away from this.

2796
01:49:34,520 --> 01:49:36,340
I'm like, this isn't a thing I'm supposed to keep.

2797
01:49:36,720 --> 01:49:38,360
Obviously she was like, I don't wanna make out

2798
01:49:38,360 --> 01:49:40,160
with this fucking loser weirdo.

2799
01:49:40,680 --> 01:49:41,560
It was you?

2800
01:49:41,700 --> 01:49:42,620
You were the problem?

2801
01:49:43,020 --> 01:49:45,880
Well, obviously the problem was the situation.

2802
01:49:46,080 --> 01:49:48,140
I'm just saying, she probably was like,

2803
01:49:48,160 --> 01:49:49,300
I don't know, what do we do?

2804
01:49:49,300 --> 01:49:50,180
I don't wanna do that.

2805
01:49:50,240 --> 01:49:51,400
I'm getting $120.

2806
01:49:52,680 --> 01:49:55,560
So he's so frustrated and he goes, well,

2807
01:49:55,680 --> 01:49:57,920
and then he just like throws up his arms

2808
01:49:57,920 --> 01:50:00,940
and he or the other woman, maybe both of them,

2809
01:50:01,240 --> 01:50:01,980
leave for a while.

2810
01:50:02,120 --> 01:50:05,180
And I'm just standing like under the shitty lights

2811
01:50:05,180 --> 01:50:09,300
with the camera people just like, so, I don't know what.

2812
01:50:09,440 --> 01:50:10,540
I'm like, what?

2813
01:50:11,440 --> 01:50:13,120
Like, well, get me, I don't wanna do this.

2814
01:50:13,140 --> 01:50:14,620
Like, I know this is a big mistake.

2815
01:50:14,900 --> 01:50:17,120
I don't wanna have to like, now somebody who doesn't,

2816
01:50:17,180 --> 01:50:18,320
I don't wanna do this either,

2817
01:50:18,320 --> 01:50:21,000
but this person is like saying she's not gonna do it.

2818
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:22,300
Maybe she has the right idea

2819
01:50:22,300 --> 01:50:23,620
because he was like, fuck this thing.

2820
01:50:23,740 --> 01:50:25,040
She's talked into it.

2821
01:50:25,120 --> 01:50:27,300
Now you have to like, oh, this will be great.

2822
01:50:27,340 --> 01:50:28,500
Somebody who tried to leave.

2823
01:50:28,800 --> 01:50:30,800
Now we get to make out on camera.

2824
01:50:31,020 --> 01:50:35,160
So all that happens is she comes back on set

2825
01:50:35,160 --> 01:50:37,800
and then he goes, all right, we're ready to go.

2826
01:50:38,360 --> 01:50:39,340
And I was like, what?

2827
01:50:39,940 --> 01:50:41,440
There's no like, is it okay?

2828
01:50:41,560 --> 01:50:42,920
Is she gonna do, what is gonna happen?

2829
01:50:43,480 --> 01:50:47,180
I swear there's no talk, there's no rehearsal.

2830
01:50:47,500 --> 01:50:49,700
He just goes, okay, so here we go.

2831
01:50:49,700 --> 01:50:50,700
She's gonna be like kissing.

2832
01:50:50,820 --> 01:50:52,020
You guys are gonna be like kissing.

2833
01:50:52,480 --> 01:50:55,520
And then what's gonna happen is she's gonna like mime,

2834
01:50:55,640 --> 01:50:57,580
taking off, no, she's gonna take off your belt.

2835
01:50:57,940 --> 01:50:59,500
And then like, she's gonna like put her hand,

2836
01:50:59,500 --> 01:51:00,480
it's gonna be out of frame.

2837
01:51:00,680 --> 01:51:02,440
She's gonna put her hand like down there.

2838
01:51:02,620 --> 01:51:06,460
And then you're gonna smell shit on her hands.

2839
01:51:07,380 --> 01:51:09,140
Because the answer to the mancer

2840
01:51:09,140 --> 01:51:11,480
of why you should never get a hand job from a British chick

2841
01:51:11,480 --> 01:51:14,280
is that British chicks have poop on their hands.

2842
01:51:14,700 --> 01:51:15,480
All of them?

2843
01:51:15,480 --> 01:51:15,920
What?

2844
01:51:19,200 --> 01:51:17,300
Mary Poppins?

2845
01:51:20,320 --> 01:51:22,540
Yes, especially Mary Poppins.

2846
01:51:23,020 --> 01:51:24,440
She's got shit in that purse.

2847
01:51:24,440 --> 01:51:25,040
She's got shit in the purse.

2848
01:51:25,060 --> 01:51:26,680
When she's reaching in, what do you think's happening?

2849
01:51:27,540 --> 01:51:29,000
So, yeah, so.

2850
01:51:30,340 --> 01:51:34,200
Trump is our punishment for this,

2851
01:51:34,440 --> 01:51:36,440
for all the culture at law.

2852
01:51:37,060 --> 01:51:38,940
The cocky empire we all lived in.

2853
01:51:39,020 --> 01:51:40,740
Chickens coming home to roost.

2854
01:51:41,740 --> 01:51:45,260
Yeah, so, yeah, the answer, I guess,

2855
01:51:45,480 --> 01:51:49,020
this was based on some survey they took

2856
01:51:49,020 --> 01:51:53,080
where there was more fecal matter on British ladies' hands.

2857
01:51:53,080 --> 01:51:53,560
I don't know.

2858
01:51:53,560 --> 01:51:55,680
They did an unrelated survey of British women

2859
01:51:55,680 --> 01:51:58,920
and all the survey slips came back covered in shit.

2860
01:51:59,540 --> 01:52:01,160
Maybe this is something to investigate.

2861
01:52:01,180 --> 01:52:01,560
Overwhelmingly.

2862
01:52:01,560 --> 01:52:03,200
Next time we do a survey in England.

2863
01:52:03,880 --> 01:52:04,480
Soaked in shit.

2864
01:52:04,620 --> 01:52:06,240
Now I wanna know. Just paper soaked in shit.

2865
01:52:06,300 --> 01:52:09,600
Cause it seems like two directors directed most of the answers.

2866
01:52:09,600 --> 01:52:11,440
We're not gonna say a hand going to that.

2867
01:52:11,440 --> 01:52:13,160
I'm not gonna say their names.

2868
01:52:13,220 --> 01:52:14,680
No. You can look it up.

2869
01:52:14,680 --> 01:52:16,640
I wanna know if it was the director

2870
01:52:16,640 --> 01:52:20,320
who went on to work on House Hunters International episodes.

2871
01:52:20,740 --> 01:52:23,880
Or the director who went on to direct

2872
01:52:23,880 --> 01:52:26,620
something called American Guns.

2873
01:52:28,300 --> 01:52:30,760
There could be a good movie

2874
01:52:30,760 --> 01:52:32,400
or something called American Gun.

2875
01:52:32,540 --> 01:52:34,820
No, it's a television show about guns.

2876
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:36,760
All right, well, we'll see.

2877
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:37,500
Maybe those aren't the people.

2878
01:52:37,500 --> 01:52:38,320
Selling them to children.

2879
01:52:38,320 --> 01:52:39,020
Maybe those aren't the people.

2880
01:52:39,020 --> 01:52:39,980
Welcome to American Guns.

2881
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:41,200
So this one's 500 bucks.

2882
01:52:41,200 --> 01:52:42,860
This one's cool as hell.

2883
01:52:44,900 --> 01:52:47,680
So what happens is there's no like,

2884
01:52:47,900 --> 01:52:50,080
we don't talk it over what we're gonna do.

2885
01:52:50,340 --> 01:52:52,080
There's no time to talk it over.

2886
01:52:52,300 --> 01:52:53,900
She just appears back on set.

2887
01:52:54,260 --> 01:52:56,660
The director goes, okay, let's roll.

2888
01:52:56,700 --> 01:52:57,700
Let's do this.

2889
01:52:58,200 --> 01:53:01,080
And I'm just so freaked out.

2890
01:53:01,100 --> 01:53:02,900
Cause I'm like, what am I supposed to do?

2891
01:53:03,520 --> 01:53:04,300
Like I'm supposed to.

2892
01:53:04,320 --> 01:53:05,800
No, that's not a healthy environment.

2893
01:53:05,840 --> 01:53:06,760
That's not a safe.

2894
01:53:07,120 --> 01:53:11,880
But any sets where someone feels unsafe, that's bad.

2895
01:53:12,280 --> 01:53:17,560
So I freeze up and the woman comes in

2896
01:53:17,560 --> 01:53:18,940
cause at first she was also,

2897
01:53:19,240 --> 01:53:23,300
the whole, a lot of these great scenes and skits

2898
01:53:23,300 --> 01:53:26,860
would be a very like nebbishy nerdy guy

2899
01:53:26,860 --> 01:53:31,120
and like a hot, like a beer commercial lady or something.

2900
01:53:31,120 --> 01:53:32,300
And that was this instance.

2901
01:53:32,700 --> 01:53:35,100
So it was like, she's gonna be like the aggressor.

2902
01:53:35,320 --> 01:53:39,140
So I swear we did maybe two takes.

2903
01:53:39,180 --> 01:53:40,400
It might've been one take.

2904
01:53:41,220 --> 01:53:43,860
She like walks up to me very half-assly

2905
01:53:43,860 --> 01:53:45,980
like puts her hands on my chest

2906
01:53:45,980 --> 01:53:48,240
and pushes me into the wall a little bit.

2907
01:53:48,300 --> 01:53:52,240
And then just puts her head by my neck

2908
01:53:52,240 --> 01:53:55,140
and just kind of goes up and down.

2909
01:53:55,240 --> 01:53:55,700
Yeah.

2910
01:53:55,840 --> 01:53:57,320
That's how you fake it.

2911
01:53:57,360 --> 01:53:58,560
That's how you cheat it.

2912
01:53:59,060 --> 01:53:59,120
Like.

2913
01:53:59,460 --> 01:54:00,280
Well, sure it is.

2914
01:54:00,320 --> 01:54:01,080
But I didn't know.

2915
01:54:01,480 --> 01:54:04,320
I also am like, this doesn't, this looks weird.

2916
01:54:04,520 --> 01:54:05,360
It can't look real.

2917
01:54:05,440 --> 01:54:08,180
But I'm still trying to be like, oh, I like this.

2918
01:54:08,180 --> 01:54:09,380
My face is like, I like this.

2919
01:54:09,380 --> 01:54:11,400
But this also, again, I want to stress

2920
01:54:11,400 --> 01:54:13,760
that this all happened within minutes.

2921
01:54:13,900 --> 01:54:15,700
So I haven't had a chance to recalibrate it.

2922
01:54:15,760 --> 01:54:18,860
I'm also very young and scared or whatever.

2923
01:54:19,280 --> 01:54:22,680
So she's like, her forehead's like hitting my neck

2924
01:54:22,680 --> 01:54:23,480
or whatever.

2925
01:54:23,560 --> 01:54:26,140
And I'm like, oh, and I'm like, this must be terrible.

2926
01:54:26,480 --> 01:54:29,100
And then she like does the belt.

2927
01:54:29,520 --> 01:54:31,260
And then I have to be like, oh,

2928
01:54:31,300 --> 01:54:33,760
like I have to make like a terrible face.

2929
01:54:34,520 --> 01:54:37,140
And now that I think about it, I think we did it twice.

2930
01:54:38,640 --> 01:54:41,960
And it just, I sat down and I was like, oh my, like,

2931
01:54:42,040 --> 01:54:44,100
it just felt, I had, I felt violated.

2932
01:54:44,200 --> 01:54:47,780
I felt like really fucked up about it.

2933
01:54:47,780 --> 01:54:49,780
Cause it was just so weird.

2934
01:54:49,780 --> 01:54:51,900
Like it was just, you felt like loss of control.

2935
01:54:52,280 --> 01:54:53,880
Obviously nothing really bad happened to me.

2936
01:54:53,880 --> 01:54:57,760
It was just such a mind fuck of an experience that.

2937
01:54:57,880 --> 01:54:59,140
Very, extremely tense.

2938
01:54:59,620 --> 01:54:59,740
Yeah.

2939
01:54:59,760 --> 01:55:00,240
Yeah.

2940
01:55:00,240 --> 01:55:02,020
So like I sat down and was like, oh my God.

2941
01:55:02,620 --> 01:55:06,180
And then a person we know was there and he's like,

2942
01:55:06,180 --> 01:55:07,500
hey, how was that?

2943
01:55:08,600 --> 01:55:10,340
Like that is pretty fun.

2944
01:55:10,560 --> 01:55:14,200
And at first I thought the person who said that was like

2945
01:55:14,200 --> 01:55:15,360
sympathizing with me.

2946
01:55:15,520 --> 01:55:19,800
Years later, I realized he was like, pretty good, huh?

2947
01:55:20,680 --> 01:55:22,820
Well, well.

2948
01:55:23,260 --> 01:55:25,060
And I won't say who that is either.

2949
01:55:25,380 --> 01:55:25,560
Jason.

2950
01:55:25,560 --> 01:55:27,120
You will when we stop recording.

2951
01:55:27,240 --> 01:55:28,180
I sure will.

2952
01:55:28,980 --> 01:55:30,640
But then to bring it back around,

2953
01:55:30,900 --> 01:55:32,720
you're trying to bury this from your memory

2954
01:55:32,720 --> 01:55:34,160
and from anyone knowing about it.

2955
01:55:34,160 --> 01:55:34,360
Yeah.

2956
01:55:34,360 --> 01:55:36,080
But your dad sees it.

2957
01:55:36,100 --> 01:55:37,360
So years later.

2958
01:55:38,080 --> 01:55:39,220
I don't even tell them.

2959
01:55:39,420 --> 01:55:40,440
Cause they reran this show.

2960
01:55:40,700 --> 01:55:40,840
Yeah, for years.

2961
01:55:40,840 --> 01:55:41,420
That was the thing.

2962
01:55:41,700 --> 01:55:47,520
I wanted to do it and strangely now I realized

2963
01:55:47,520 --> 01:55:49,200
this would have been terrible to do.

2964
01:55:50,160 --> 01:55:53,020
But by the time, I probably watched it in 2010,

2965
01:55:53,420 --> 01:55:55,520
watching three years old episodes of Mansers.

2966
01:55:55,660 --> 01:55:58,660
Were you going to spring it on me in a specific way,

2967
01:55:58,660 --> 01:56:00,020
like on a podcast or something,

2968
01:56:00,040 --> 01:56:02,400
or you just wanted to see it when you were looking for it?

2969
01:56:02,440 --> 01:56:03,840
I don't, I just wanted to see it.

2970
01:56:03,840 --> 01:56:04,080
I don't know.

2971
01:56:04,140 --> 01:56:05,280
There was no sneak attack.

2972
01:56:06,160 --> 01:56:08,680
I've seen it, cause we know other people who've been on it

2973
01:56:08,680 --> 01:56:11,560
and I've like, oh shit, that's so and so.

2974
01:56:12,080 --> 01:56:12,940
Jason's gonna look it up again.

2975
01:56:13,200 --> 01:56:14,940
I think I've searched in the last year or two

2976
01:56:14,940 --> 01:56:16,260
and it used to be able to,

2977
01:56:16,380 --> 01:56:18,760
you could see it on the Spike TV website.

2978
01:56:19,400 --> 01:56:20,980
Cause the big thing that you need to know,

2979
01:56:21,080 --> 01:56:22,860
but that I needed to know at the time was,

2980
01:56:23,080 --> 01:56:26,240
this is non-union and there's no thing

2981
01:56:26,240 --> 01:56:27,780
that says they can't run it forever.

2982
01:56:28,940 --> 01:56:31,280
So cool, so you're getting taken advantage of.

2983
01:56:31,280 --> 01:56:31,640
Yes.

2984
01:56:31,640 --> 01:56:34,680
It's a tent set where you're being barked at

2985
01:56:34,680 --> 01:56:36,240
and made to mate out with strangers

2986
01:56:36,240 --> 01:56:37,680
without asking if it's okay.

2987
01:56:37,940 --> 01:56:40,860
Right, or even a time, just a minute to talk,

2988
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:42,060
go like, oh hey, sorry, this is weird.

2989
01:56:42,060 --> 01:56:44,160
Any preparation or reversal, anything.

2990
01:56:44,300 --> 01:56:44,780
No, nothing.

2991
01:56:45,680 --> 01:56:47,600
But this is on TV.

2992
01:56:47,880 --> 01:56:50,400
It's on TV, so yeah, a couple years in,

2993
01:56:50,940 --> 01:56:53,860
cause I think, I don't remember even the year.

2994
01:56:53,860 --> 01:56:56,920
It might've been 2009, it might've been 10 years ago.

2995
01:56:57,300 --> 01:56:59,720
But yeah, I think like in 2011 or something,

2996
01:57:00,380 --> 01:57:02,700
my mom called me and was like,

2997
01:57:02,860 --> 01:57:04,980
I was sleeping in bed, your dad was watching TV

2998
01:57:04,980 --> 01:57:07,260
and he woke me up and he goes, hey, look who's on TV.

2999
01:57:08,400 --> 01:57:09,580
And I think my mom just did one,

3000
01:57:09,580 --> 01:57:12,000
like a very mom thing of like, it was interesting

3001
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:15,180
or it was okay and didn't say what it was.

3002
01:57:15,700 --> 01:57:16,740
And I was like, oh my God.

3003
01:57:16,760 --> 01:57:19,220
Cause I was hoping they hadn't seen it

3004
01:57:19,220 --> 01:57:22,160
because I didn't say anything about it

3005
01:57:22,160 --> 01:57:23,660
and it's really two minutes or something.

3006
01:57:24,040 --> 01:57:24,660
Have you found it?

3007
01:57:24,720 --> 01:57:26,160
Well, I haven't found the video,

3008
01:57:26,160 --> 01:57:27,860
but I found that they were talking about it

3009
01:57:27,860 --> 01:57:30,800
on the Bungie message boards, the software company,

3010
01:57:30,800 --> 01:57:35,180
and also the website I've heard about before,

3011
01:57:35,240 --> 01:57:38,020
bodybuilding.com was also talking about this.

3012
01:57:38,020 --> 01:57:38,680
Yeah, that's a web.

3013
01:57:38,680 --> 01:57:39,000
I've come across that.

3014
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:42,020
A source of some very odd internet paraphernalia.

3015
01:57:42,460 --> 01:57:45,120
I'm sure it'll be like repackaged somewhere.

3016
01:57:45,160 --> 01:57:45,960
Okay, great.

3017
01:57:46,160 --> 01:57:47,860
All the managers and that'll show up

3018
01:57:47,860 --> 01:57:49,700
on a streaming service somewhere.

3019
01:57:49,700 --> 01:57:50,860
That'll be a big deal.

3020
01:57:50,940 --> 01:57:55,200
Hopefully Disney Plus, some merger will occur.

3021
01:57:56,180 --> 01:57:57,660
Oh my God.

3022
01:57:58,280 --> 01:58:00,640
Well, if you stick around past the credits,

3023
01:58:00,640 --> 01:58:02,160
you really got a nice treat here today.

3024
01:58:02,240 --> 01:58:04,480
Wow, what an epilogue to this episode

3025
01:58:04,480 --> 01:58:05,640
about a very nice one.

3026
01:58:05,840 --> 01:58:08,680
I'd also like to say that the Yeti Museum

3027
01:58:08,680 --> 01:58:11,840
was curated by Professor Pima Dorje.

3028
01:58:12,900 --> 01:58:14,440
Just to get us back on track.

3029
01:58:14,700 --> 01:58:16,800
Okay, and now we can say,

3030
01:58:17,460 --> 01:58:19,140
you've survived podcast the ride.

3031
01:58:19,560 --> 01:58:22,920
Expedition Everest edition and only expedition.

3032
01:58:23,820 --> 01:58:25,540
Nothing else weird on this episode.

3033
01:58:25,780 --> 01:58:28,440
Yeah, no bizarre upsetting confessions occurred.

3034
01:58:28,460 --> 01:58:29,220
I liked that.

3035
01:58:29,220 --> 01:58:31,860
That was like a little Andy Cohen after show.

3036
01:58:31,860 --> 01:58:35,220
We got into some salacious stuff

3037
01:58:35,220 --> 01:58:37,060
now that you're losing.

3038
01:58:37,460 --> 01:58:40,340
I would love it if we all took turns being the bartender

3039
01:58:40,340 --> 01:58:41,740
on Watch What Happens Live.

3040
01:58:41,940 --> 01:58:44,960
If this show got us to be like, you know.

3041
01:58:45,420 --> 01:58:46,680
Well, maybe we'll be like,

3042
01:58:46,800 --> 01:58:48,780
we could be on the network with Andy Cohen

3043
01:58:48,780 --> 01:58:49,700
and we'll follow him.

3044
01:58:50,320 --> 01:58:51,120
We'll do a show.

3045
01:58:51,200 --> 01:58:53,160
We'll do a theme version of his show,

3046
01:58:53,160 --> 01:58:53,900
but it's all theme park.

3047
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:56,380
Hey, Jax, Jax from Vanderpump,

3048
01:58:56,380 --> 01:58:58,800
what do you think of Dumbo?

3049
01:59:00,540 --> 01:59:04,980
Yeah, which row are we talking in Credit Coaster, huh?

3050
01:59:04,980 --> 01:59:07,400
Are you a fifth row guy or more of an eight?

3051
01:59:08,900 --> 01:59:11,560
Sounds like a good piece of television, right?

3052
01:59:11,560 --> 01:59:13,980
Yeah, it'll be interesting.

3053
01:59:14,960 --> 01:59:15,900
I'll say that.

3054
01:59:16,440 --> 01:59:17,940
All right, hey, now we've done it.

3055
01:59:17,940 --> 01:59:18,960
Hey, I already said all the stuff.

3056
01:59:19,040 --> 01:59:20,100
You know what to do.

3057
01:59:21,380 --> 01:59:23,740
All right, hey, if you have any questions,
