1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:14,200
Warning, the following haunt cast contains expert sniveling, crying for mommy, a ghastly

4
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:21,640
podcast topic mistake rectified, and a terrifying debate over how important it is to wait in

5
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:22,640
line.

6
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:28,520
All this plus, Lindsay Katai returns to talk Tower of Terror at Tokyo DisneySea on today's

7
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:48,720
most fiendishly fun haunt cast, The Fright.

8
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,760
Welcome to Haunt Cast The Fright.

9
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:55,440
You know, in the future, a Los Angeles Preservation Society will show off this very garage and

10
00:00:55,560 --> 00:01:00,760
tell the people that three little theme park boys talked about CEOs and made for cable

11
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:01,880
movies.

12
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:05,880
My name is Mike Carlson, joining me as always, Jason Sheridan.

13
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,440
That is, will be the most notable episode.

14
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,720
Maybe the only one that survives, you know.

15
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:14,400
Yeah, you mean the Jay Leno?

16
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,400
Yeah, yeah.

17
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:20,600
Through the passage of time and as history moves on, a lot gets lost, you know.

18
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:24,440
But I like to think we talk about made for cable movies and Jay Leno on almost every

19
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:27,080
podcast, so it really doesn't break it down that much.

20
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,080
Yeah, no, that's fair.

21
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,080
A tiny amount.

22
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,080
Yeah.

23
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,520
Every, before there was the full episode.

24
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,800
Scott Garner here as well.

25
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:33,800
Yeah.

26
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:39,000
Could I just, if any of this is going to be preserved by historical society, can I maybe

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,920
try to wriggle out of the phrase little theme park boys?

28
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,040
Could I request that there be a rewrite on that?

29
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,120
Wow, that's just something a little theme park boy would do.

30
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,120
Wiggle out.

31
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,120
Yeah.

32
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,120
That is true.

33
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,120
Jason's right.

34
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,080
If you hadn't said wiggle.

35
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,420
Oh no, I said wriggle.

36
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:57,420
Oh, I don't.

37
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,420
I'm so wriggled.

38
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,420
Damn it.

39
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,120
I'm so damn it.

40
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,120
I'm so wriggled.

41
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:09,080
Any kind of, any kind ofiggling to get out of a situation sounds like a little theme

42
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,680
park boy to me.

43
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,360
Eagle is a theme park boy thing.

44
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,360
Little Figgle Diggle.

45
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:21,200
Can I Figgle Diggle my way out of being called a theme park boy?

46
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,360
That is how people hear us, I think.

47
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,360
They hear that voice.

48
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:29,320
Welcome to Podcasts Alright, hosted by me, Mike Carson.

49
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:32,600
In our minds we're like, hello there, this is Podcasts Alright here.

50
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,520
Michael Iser was a pretty good CEO, was he not, Jason?

51
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,520
That's right, Michael.

52
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,680
Let's talk about throughput per hour.

53
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,560
How many guests are hitting up that bad boy every hour?

54
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,560
Meanwhile.

55
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,560
Let's take a few calls.

56
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:49,160
All the listeners at home are just hearing like, I liked it when the big ride waited

57
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,160
for us.

58
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:56,040
And when people are saying, this is podcast I listened to, and they were talking about

59
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,920
Disney World's anniversary and they made a good point of it.

60
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:03,440
It was a swamp, it was a swamp before the wise were there.

61
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,400
Anyway, so I like it.

62
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,560
I subscribe for info like that.

63
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,560
Yeah.

64
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,360
Oh man, that is really, we are really realizing something.

65
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,360
It's a revelation, honestly.

66
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,560
I'm sorry, I didn't know you guys didn't know.

67
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,560
I guess we did.

68
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,560
I was a joke.

69
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,560
I was making a joke, I thought.

70
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,560
No, that's true.

71
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,400
That's how we sound.

72
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:28,920
That voice of course is the Lily monster to my Herman because it's haunt cast the fright.

73
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,920
Lindsay Katai, she's here.

74
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:31,920
Hello, I'm here.

75
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,920
Hi.

76
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:36,760
Last time I called you, what's Mary Steenburgen?

77
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,760
Sarah something?

78
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,400
Well, I said I was a Walmarten.

79
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,400
The Clifford?

80
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,400
Oh, okay.

81
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,560
Yeah, I was the, what's her face to your who's its butt?

82
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,560
Shoot.

83
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,560
Oh well.

84
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,560
Now it looks like I'm not a huge Clifford guy.

85
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,760
Well, I know that you're, there's no question that you're a huge monsters guy because I

86
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,640
was just re-listening to an episode from a couple weeks ago where I realized it's a recurring

87
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,640
thing.

88
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:01,800
I think it's happened more than once where I have said I've made a reference to the monsters

89
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,920
car and then you're like, Dracula, yes.

90
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,920
Yeah, Dracula is a Dracula.

91
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:07,920
Yes.

92
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:08,920
Let that moment pass.

93
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:09,920
The people must know.

94
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:10,920
Does not surprise.

95
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:11,920
It's a Dracula.

96
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:12,920
It's not a regular car.

97
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,920
Excuse me, the car, is that called the Dracula?

98
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,920
Sarah Davis.

99
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:22,160
Yeah, this is, this is what Lindsay hears.

100
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,560
Lindsay probably hears the word Dracula once a week.

101
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,560
Probably.

102
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:33,160
I mean, I for sure hear the word monsters multiple times a week.

103
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:38,480
Dracula I feel like because I'm not personally bringing up the car, Dracula very much.

104
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:41,920
Well, you're trying to get away from the monsters topic in general.

105
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,920
You're just like, it'll pass.

106
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,920
It'll pass.

107
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,920
Literally running.

108
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:48,240
Like in another storm in Orlando, you're like, if I just keep my head down, it'll just

109
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,240
roll over me.

110
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:52,040
I'm just going to let myself get soaked because it's inevitable.

111
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,040
Won't do too much damage.

112
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:59,560
Are there, is, are there any like recent Mike viewing trends, especially forced viewing

113
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:03,360
trends upon you that we don't know about?

114
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,360
Gosh, aren't there?

115
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,360
That's very on the spot.

116
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,360
I know.

117
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,760
And I don't think he would hide anything, but.

118
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,320
No, no, he would never.

119
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,520
He's nothing if not honest.

120
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,520
You hear this?

121
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,000
It's like a house full of Jack Benny.

122
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
This I understand.

123
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Well, we had talked about.

124
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,640
We do watch Jack Benny occasionally.

125
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,640
We do.

126
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,640
Yeah.

127
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,680
Because we were talking about late shift, you know, you know, some men always have the

128
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:31,840
TV on and the sport game on, but that's not what, you know, Scott and I roll necessarily.

129
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:36,640
Actually I, I, um, this is sadly topical.

130
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,760
Not too long ago.

131
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:42,240
I think maybe the most recent time I was like, yes, I, you have shown that to me.

132
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,240
Thank you.

133
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:47,360
Was, um, Norm McDonald on comedians in cars getting coffee.

134
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,360
The Kojak story.

135
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,360
Yes.

136
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,360
Yes.

137
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:57,280
There's a norm reciting a Kojak, like a scene from the Kojak pilot, which I think is funny.

138
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,800
And which is very funny.

139
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:04,600
And you've shown it to me before, but you were like, then like just repeating the entire

140
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,600
bit to me.

141
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,760
I remember that.

142
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,760
But then you just like kept going.

143
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:10,160
Even though I had said, I remember it.

144
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,160
Yeah.

145
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:14,080
You pretty much recited don't blame Conan in the late shift episode.

146
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,080
Yeah.

147
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,080
Yeah.

148
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,080
Oh yeah.

149
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,080
We're all like, yeah, I've seen it.

150
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,080
Well, so anyway, so what happens is.

151
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,080
But the listeners might not know.

152
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,080
And they wouldn't want to just look it up.

153
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,080
Oh, well, certainly.

154
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,600
Actually, he was just telling me about that because I didn't know about that.

155
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,160
She actually didn't know don't blame Conan, which is.

156
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,160
I did not know.

157
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:32,320
When there's something I know and I, she doesn't know, boy, is the party starting.

158
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,320
Boy, is that fun.

159
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,320
I look, I am the same way.

160
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,400
Yes, it is the it's the like it is a big green light.

161
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,000
If I ask Aaron, have you heard of this?

162
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
And she says no.

163
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,200
Well, that means let me let me set the table.

164
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:48,720
Let me put my bib on my bib in.

165
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,520
Michael is eating tonight.

166
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,800
Sharing things.

167
00:06:54,880 --> 00:07:00,520
And I don't want to like well, there's a lot to get to in the episode, I'm sure.

168
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:05,280
But just in case this is a 20 minute tangent, the I just like the right before

169
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:10,440
we started recording, Jason was talking about a new Epcot lounge in which you can

170
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,640
get free cans of seltzer.

171
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,840
And Mike's response was really.

172
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,320
That was that's a little taste of for the episode.

173
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:24,320
Yeah, that's the that's that's again, that's the man talk that happened sort of off Mike.

174
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:27,720
So do you say I was real impressed with that because we you know, we were talking

175
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,480
about the Magic Key Lounge, which sounds like it's unimpressive because I haven't

176
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,480
been yet.

177
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:34,480
But then I hear there's a free you get a free can at Disney.

178
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,880
At the Blue Cross Blue Shield Lounge.

179
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,040
Blue. Yeah, Blue Shield of Florida or something.

180
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,480
I yeah, in the Norway Pavilion.

181
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:45,080
You need to go to a website.

182
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:50,320
Yes, in the Norway Pavilion, because the restaurant that I think for some reason

183
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:53,400
you know, why are these affiliated Norway and Blue Cross?

184
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,360
Well, health care.

185
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,240
They just had an empty room, let's be honest.

186
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:03,360
Well, it is because they haven't done like face character,

187
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,560
maskless face character, like meals, character meals have not come back.

188
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,120
Like that's where the princess dining.

189
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,600
Oh, so they have that empty room.

190
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,000
So they have an empty room.

191
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,760
And apparently you can pick one beverage and two snacks.

192
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:20,880
And so there's a variety of beverages, hummus and yogurt.

193
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:24,000
Wow. So that's pass holder only.

194
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:30,160
No, you just have to get I the the Disney Tours blog had the full rundown on it

195
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,240
and a link to the pass and insurance has to approve it.

196
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:36,240
I know what privatized health care is good.

197
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,760
Yeah, I didn't like it till right now.

198
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:43,600
That does seem well, yeah, if you're there, I mean, tweet us a photo if you go to this lounge.

199
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,880
Yeah, if you make it to the lounge and Club Cool's back open to.

200
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,800
So you can really hit out, get some freebies that Epcot right now.

201
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,200
Beverly is back.

202
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,000
Beverly flavor soda at Club Cool is back.

203
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,360
Drinkable sodas. Yeah.

204
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:00,080
So there's a lot of exciting stuff for someone to say exclaim wow at

205
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,920
or get very excited.

206
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,360
Really? Really?

207
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,480
Whatever I say, there's a new Beverly.

208
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,040
Oh, yeah, the new Beverly.

209
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:12,480
You mean are these soda like what's the new bad soda?

210
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,000
I'm sure someone listening doesn't know what Beverly is.

211
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,440
People listen to this podcast don't know what Beverly is.

212
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:21,480
Well, I didn't know it, but that's I guess common.

213
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,240
That's constantly like, what's that? You don't know that.

214
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,240
You don't know Beverly?

215
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,360
Because I just learned this.

216
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,080
Like you don't really like weird.

217
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,760
That's the this bad soda.

218
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:35,240
This soda dispensing place, free soda.

219
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,960
And it spits it out right away.

220
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:37,880
Yeah, gross.

221
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,360
But from around the world.

222
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,440
No memory of what Beverly tastes like.

223
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,680
It's an aperitif.

224
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:46,320
It's a non alcoholic aperitif is what it's labeled as.

225
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,680
And it's like just a very bitter soda.

226
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,160
But it's a it's a new version of it.

227
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,240
Is that what people are saying?

228
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,800
It's a new bad soda. Right.

229
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,520
That is like, oh, that's that's the new Beverly.

230
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,400
That is bad.

231
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,280
And Beverly is also back.

232
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,360
But there's a new soda.

233
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:05,680
There's one worse calling the new Beverly. Right. Right. Right.

234
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:09,320
Is it the sour plum one from China? Might be.

235
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,880
OK, might be, because I know our boy, Mr.

236
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,240
Mara, that is like it.

237
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,800
Yes, that is our new.

238
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,960
That is the thing we got our newest shared thing.

239
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,120
We on board is that we love watching YouTube.

240
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:25,120
Mr. Morrow and he goes to Mr.

241
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,240
Paging Mr. Morrow, which is the YouTube play on words

242
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,960
from the Tomorrowland people over.

243
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,840
Yeah. So we watch him a lot.

244
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:37,200
And he's the most positive guy and tries every food.

245
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,520
He's in the park just seemingly five days a week.

246
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,560
Always walking around the Disney World part.

247
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,080
You guys explained this all to me.

248
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:48,680
And you told me that there are episodes where

249
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,760
some of the highlights that happened to this guy are

250
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,720
one time he lost his hat on the Tower of Terror.

251
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,960
Yes. Tower of Terror. Oh, yes. Oh, hey, bro.

252
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,440
I forgot there was a topic.

253
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,280
And one time a bee got in his pocket.

254
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,000
And then you sent me a video.

255
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,120
And I think we were all surprised to learn same day.

256
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:11,280
Same same episode. All killer, no filler.

257
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:15,400
Yes. I think perhaps also in that episode is when he delights

258
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:18,040
in goofy, sprunging his whiskers.

259
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,960
Yeah. Or goofy or Pluto was it? Oh, Pluto.

260
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,760
I think it was Pluto. Yeah, definitely.

261
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,480
That's one of my favorite episodes.

262
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,880
There's a lot going on in that one.

263
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,880
And all of a sudden he's like, I have a bee in my pocket.

264
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:32,560
And he's like, it's like a real it may as well be Tom Cruise

265
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,800
flying that helicopter through the mountains

266
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:38,520
when you compare it to what happens on a normal, very serene

267
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,720
episode of Paging Mr.

268
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:43,200
Morrow. But we love watching his videos.

269
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:47,920
And yeah, so that's that's the biggest sharing TV show

270
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,000
I think we have right now.

271
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,440
That's what we're watching.

272
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:54,240
Yeah. A man who lost his hat and had a run in with a bee.

273
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,400
It's so calming.

274
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,480
He's honestly a delight.

275
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,000
He's he is a delight.

276
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,840
He just seems like a very nice man enjoying Disney parks.

277
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:07,200
He's none of the cynicism jokes that we try to do.

278
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,200
Yeah, I got enough of that from me.

279
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,960
Yeah. I hear he has a pure love.

280
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,600
It's like Duffy and Shelley May's love.

281
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,080
It's pure. He's pure.

282
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:19,560
I just pulled up his channel and I realized Jane and I also watch this guy.

283
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:22,040
So you didn't know how we are.

284
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,960
How we not talked about this?

285
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,160
Yeah, he's the best.

286
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,960
She was a lot and I catch it sometimes.

287
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,960
Well, you got to see the one with the bee, Jason.

288
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:33,280
Yeah, look, it's that's like the breaking bad with Hank in the parking lot

289
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,720
and the twins. That's like what's going to happen with this bee.

290
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,240
And there's a cliffhanger with the hat.

291
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,320
You don't know if he gets his hat back.

292
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,160
But spoiler alert, he does get it back. Oh, good.

293
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:46,280
So, yes, if you like a peaceful days later, I think so.

294
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:49,400
Yeah, they had the like the right to be shut down episode.

295
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,880
So I think that's a common practice on most rides where like once

296
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:54,360
it shut down, they can go through and get all the different hats

297
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,720
on Tower of Terror. So he's lost a few hats, though.

298
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,400
Yes. It's going to happen.

299
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,560
You're destined to be you're going to be friends with Mr.

300
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:04,480
Morrow as soon as this episode comes out.

301
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:10,360
I think I think we've been on a defunct land charity stream

302
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,200
with on the same bill as him before.

303
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,240
I didn't even realize it.

304
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:16,920
So we have we've been on the same bill, which is like marquee.

305
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,120
We have like our our.

306
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,840
Oh, man, this is like love and the doors together.

307
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,880
It was like Woodstock. Yeah, yeah.

308
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,640
I was like, if I was rich, I would fly Mr.

309
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,960
Morrow out here just to go to Disneyland with him.

310
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,520
Yeah. So one, that's the dream one of these days.

311
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,800
But it is like our degrees of separation, our Kevin Bacon game.

312
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:40,440
You know, if you're doing your theme park media, Kevin Bacon,

313
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,600
you know how many degrees we were like one.

314
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:46,240
It's not. Yeah, I was going to say it's sort of weird to even talk about it

315
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,320
on this podcast because of how quickly this may get to him. Sure.

316
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,080
Yeah. But we are legit fans.

317
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,240
But yeah, true fans. Yeah.

318
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,520
So yeah, that's that's our theme park things that we that we share lately.

319
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:01,720
I fucking cried watching his video talking about why he vlogs

320
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:04,240
and his vlogging journey. Mm hmm. Yeah.

321
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:11,440
So episode vocabulary so far, Beverly, Dragula, Paging Mr.

322
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,560
Morrow. So just like we'll just have a glossary.

323
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:18,080
We've done add anything else to the list that you the listener need to look up.

324
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,880
14 minutes, no topic. Real mention yet.

325
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,720
That's pretty good. So, yeah, you have a lot of.

326
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,000
Well, that's what the warnings are for. Of course.

327
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,280
We so that we have said it technically.

328
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,520
Yes. Is part of it.

329
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,840
And it's been said, but there's still another

330
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:35,800
perhaps brief tangent that needs to occur because we're talking about

331
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:39,280
the Tower of Terror, the Tokyo version specifically,

332
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,720
which is not the Twilight Zone.

333
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,000
It is certainly not Guardians Mission Breakout.

334
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,440
It's its own wonderful thing.

335
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,680
And I'm excited to talk about it.

336
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:51,160
But part of why we're doing this now and this year and with Lindsay is that

337
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,680
there was a problem last year.

338
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,200
Yes, yes, yes.

339
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:59,840
It was so mean, seemingly like well in the past,

340
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:03,400
you had requested to do the Twilight Zone Tower of Terror.

341
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:06,480
This is before Mr. Morrow lost his hat on it.

342
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,440
You were passionate about it for other reasons.

343
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,120
Somehow, for many other reasons.

344
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,840
Well, I'm a huge Twilight Zone fan. Mm hmm.

345
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,920
And the first time I went on Tower of Terror,

346
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:21,000
I went when I was 14 with friends and had a nervous breakdown on it.

347
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,520
Oh, jeez. Which is extremely embarrassing.

348
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:27,800
To what degree? What's the thing that happened?

349
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,000
Screaming for my mom.

350
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,200
She's there in the state or.

351
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,600
No. OK. No.

352
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,120
This was in Florida in 1996.

353
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,800
My mother was in San Diego.

354
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,480
This was a school trip.

355
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:48,120
I was with my peers, was so sure that my soul was about to be stolen out of my body

356
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:52,800
that I truly had a nervous breakdown and began to scream.

357
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,400
Wait, I'm sorry. You were.

358
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,840
Irrationally, you were.

359
00:15:56,840 --> 00:16:01,800
It was not so much about the the the ride up and down, but more about

360
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:05,440
you thought that your soul was going to like a real problem

361
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,160
with the supernatural as a child.

362
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,800
Oh, whoa. Yeah. Wow.

363
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,560
Truly, I would have panic attacks after I saw it.

364
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:14,680
I wouldn't shower without somebody else in the room for three years.

365
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:17,160
For three years. Mm hmm.

366
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:21,920
Oh, my God. From the ages of 10 to 13.

367
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:25,680
So somebody had to just like just like chill in the bathroom.

368
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,560
Sit on the toilet.

369
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,720
I would literally have a panic attack.

370
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:33,160
Wow. Like couldn't breathe, couldn't stay in the shower,

371
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,280
would like start crying.

372
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:42,480
I was deathly afraid of showers after I saw the original psycho

373
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,480
and would like double check to make sure the bathroom door was locked

374
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:48,040
and like peek out for like.

375
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,160
Yeah. And this went on for a while.

376
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,120
What do you think age wise? Huh?

377
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,240
Well, what age do you think it's 12?

378
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,080
Stopped at 12, 12, 13.

379
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,760
Well, that's about when I saw it.

380
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,840
Oh, it started then. Yeah, it started.

381
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:00,840
Oh, OK. Yeah.

382
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:04,360
OK. Well, that's not because, yeah, you were what, like 14, did you say?

383
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:08,520
I was well, when I was afraid of it and somebody had to just like

384
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:11,280
hang out and read it in the bathroom while I showered,

385
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,480
I was like 10 to 13.

386
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,680
And the Tower of Terror, though, was.

387
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,760
Tower of Terror. I was 14.

388
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,880
OK. Too old. Sure.

389
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,520
Yeah, yeah. Too old to be happening.

390
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,920
I'm sure I have something like that, though,

391
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:26,120
but I can't think of it off the top of my head.

392
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:28,280
Look, I was afraid of the ride.

393
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,560
I was afraid of going on the ride. Sure. What it did.

394
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:33,800
I think the fact that you bought into the story is.

395
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,360
Against my will.

396
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,200
It was like, I know that I'm fine.

397
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,200
It's fine. And then, yet somehow the ride started

398
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,920
and I started to scream for my mom.

399
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,440
I want off this ride.

400
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:50,880
I want my mom fully screaming, crying.

401
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,600
And then it and then the ride happened and I was

402
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,120
and we get off the ride and I was like, that was so fun.

403
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:59,400
Let's go again, everyone. I'm normal. Everything's fine.

404
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,920
Wow. One of my favorite rides.

405
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,520
Still in the range to play it cool. One of my favorite rides.

406
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:07,040
Yeah. Hey, we're all still going to talk to me in San Diego, right?

407
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:11,000
Yeah. You guys are going to commend me for my emotional vulnerability.

408
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,640
Right. Yeah.

409
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,560
We're definitely doing that, right.

410
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,800
As 14 year olds in 1996.

411
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:20,120
This is a conversation that's been had and we're cool with. No.

412
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:24,280
Did you go on again that trip or no?

413
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,640
Do you remember? I don't remember.

414
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,600
I know I genuinely did want to because I thought it was fun.

415
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,640
I've never really been afraid of roller coasters

416
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,800
except for kind of later in life when sometimes I'll get afraid

417
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,200
that I'm having a premonition.

418
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,080
Oh, well, that's that has really been terrifying for me

419
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:44,480
because we'll be like on a credit coaster and you'll just turn to me and go,

420
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:47,680
I just want you to know I love you.

421
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:50,720
What? And I'll go, what?

422
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,720
She's done this multiple times.

423
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,680
And I go, I go, that's not the way to start.

424
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:57,360
Then like five, four, three, two, one.

425
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:00,080
And I go, no, what?

426
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:04,160
Yes, like very seriously put a hand on his knee or shoulder.

427
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,640
Like the end of a movie.

428
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:10,440
Hold eye contact and just say, I want you to know that I love you.

429
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,440
Like it's Armageddon or like the movie Armageddon or something.

430
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,520
The plane that you know is going down.

431
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:19,960
Yes. That's not what I want to hear on the start of a thrill ride.

432
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:24,280
No. And I don't blame you, but I can't stop myself.

433
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:28,680
This is also the plot of that final destination that we talked about.

434
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,720
The one character has the premonition

435
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,040
the roller coaster is going to go off the tracks and it does.

436
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,720
And then what if it does and I didn't say I love you?

437
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,960
Well, I guess what I would I be?

438
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,640
What I heard there was probably a pretty fresh

439
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,040
I love you in the last so many hours, right?

440
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,880
No, let's say if you have a premonition, you got to say it.

441
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,440
And I guess that's fair.

442
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,840
But if those are the rules of psychic premonitions

443
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,240
that have absolutely never come true.

444
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:58,200
But if there was a fresh how fresh is and I love you is in the last 24 hours

445
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:02,160
considered it's fresh for like a situation like that or it has to be right before.

446
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:06,160
I guess if I'm going off Lindsey's roots, it's like when you have the

447
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,960
because the premonition hasn't been had.

448
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:08,960
Uh huh.

449
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,160
You guys come right off of it.

450
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,400
All emotional logic.

451
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:15,000
Right. You had the fear that you're about to die.

452
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,160
You should say I love you.

453
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,200
I mean, I get I get it.

454
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,600
I understand. Does this make sense?

455
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,240
No, absolutely not.

456
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,400
But there is it.

457
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:26,440
Does it make emotional sense to my the like

458
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:29,760
most intensely afraid part of my brain? Yes.

459
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:32,720
I'll say this. It gives another dimension to the Incredicoaster

460
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:33,720
because I'm like, is Mr.

461
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:36,400
Incredible's like static figure going to fall on me?

462
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,920
Is he going to be reaching for the cookie?

463
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,440
But like his arm falls off and cuts my head off.

464
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,400
Like what could happen?

465
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,200
There's real fire in the fire part.

466
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,000
Yeah. Real ice in the ice part.

467
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:46,760
Right. Jack Jack.

468
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:49,600
Like I get blown up like Jack Jack.

469
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:53,320
I turn into a giant and then I get a helicopter.

470
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,320
Hits me in the head.

471
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:58,640
Which was my my fear at 14 that Tower of Terror was real.

472
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,800
So, yeah, you might.

473
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,240
So the story of the ride is what's going to get you.

474
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,680
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

475
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,640
That's you're right. It's not it's a narrative.

476
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,680
It's not a ride accident. Yeah.

477
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:13,160
Well, with the within credit coaster, any time now that I've become afraid

478
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:17,400
of a roller coaster ride, it has been a much more like physical.

479
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,280
I'm afraid I'm going to die on this ride.

480
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:23,040
But at that incident was pure.

481
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:26,760
I think this ride might literally be cursed

482
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:32,920
and I'm not able to silence the fight or flight part of my brain that thinks this.

483
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:38,000
Well, my my question is, because I think it is a little in question

484
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:42,040
in in both the Twilight Zone version and the Tokyo version.

485
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,840
What happens to the characters?

486
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,400
It's something about you, right?

487
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,960
They're like souls getting trapped or getting.

488
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,800
I well, I was going to say getting disintegrated.

489
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,080
I don't think I don't know if that's true.

490
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,960
Like, did you what do you did you have a visualization?

491
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,680
Because I might not figure out what happens to these characters.

492
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,000
Oh, that I'd get trapped in the right.

493
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,680
Just like they got trapped in there.

494
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:09,040
Their spirits get trapped in the elevator to relive the moment over and over.

495
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:11,280
Like they're stuck in this purgatory.

496
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,320
That's with Harrison Hightower in this ride.

497
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:16,600
It seems to be like the moment that he fell.

498
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:19,360
Yeah. And it was cursed by the idol.

499
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,880
So so you think that over and over keep happening to you.

500
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:25,520
That I would just like live in the ride forever.

501
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,880
And they would add there's the movie star and the little girl and then

502
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,760
1996 era Lindsay.

503
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,960
Yes. And then

504
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,320
height of her depression and insanity, Lindsay Keite.

505
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:43,480
Wow. You just be added to the ride wearing like what clothes?

506
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:46,480
Oh, I read Honey, I shrunk the audience shirt

507
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,320
that I bought on that trip.

508
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,240
Oh, excellent.

509
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:54,720
I don't want to unlock this door with the key of imagination.

510
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,520
So I had said, oh, I want to do that episode.

511
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,800
But and that was early on. Yes.

512
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:06,120
And I completely in a haze of month, what?

513
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:10,960
Nine or eight of the pandemic, just like not even in my brain.

514
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,000
Yeah. Totally. And then I was like, you're like, oh, what episode?

515
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:13,880
Because then you were down in sand.

516
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:16,200
You were actually visiting your mother and you're like, what episode?

517
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,080
You're like, oh, Tower of Terror.

518
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,160
And you're like, hey.

519
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,840
And I was like, what?

520
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,920
Wasn't it on a zoom with all of us?

521
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:25,080
Well, Jason's birthday.

522
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:27,760
I one year ago, literally a year ago.

523
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:31,640
Every day. Oh, yes.

524
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:35,000
Yes. And I realized on the zoom and I got very sad.

525
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:40,560
Yeah. And I got legit sad that you were actually like

526
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,320
how you felt.

527
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,240
Lindsay was roasting me and to be funny into it.

528
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,920
And I could take a roast normally, but for whatever reason,

529
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:50,480
I was just extra sad that day.

530
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,840
I was feeling really sad.

531
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,080
Very sad. Yeah. Yeah.

532
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,160
It was much sadder in general.

533
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,880
Yeah. Going into like week three or

534
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:02,040
visiting my mom. You were there for a while.

535
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:05,160
I was alone and I totally blanked out.

536
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:07,640
And then you were roasting me, which was, I'm sure funny.

537
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,440
And then you were like texting me and I'm like,

538
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,840
I'm feeling very sad right now. I'm sorry.

539
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,800
So then I felt.

540
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:18,040
Then I felt bad because I was like, oh, man,

541
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:21,800
now I'm making you feel bad for scoring innocent points on me.

542
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:24,240
Like there was nothing like nefarious about it.

543
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,120
It wasn't like anything like underhanded.

544
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:29,240
But then I felt bad because I was like, well, I'm making her feel bad

545
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:31,960
about a very fun roast.

546
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:35,960
Like it's a very fun, you know, innocuous thing to be goofy.

547
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,040
And I was like, oh, man.

548
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,920
And then I got sadder because of that.

549
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:42,280
I felt sadder because now I had made you feel bad about a

550
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,440
fine goofing on.

551
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,520
I feel like you weren't much like my breakdown.

552
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,280
Taking it and batting it back.

553
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:53,000
It was like, I don't know, Jay Leno not riffing back at Jim

554
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,960
Kimmel during the 10 at 10.

555
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:58,840
And then whining about it to Oprah a year later.

556
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:03,960
These three little theme park boys would put in references to Jay's 10 at 10.

557
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:06,080
A screen card challenge.

558
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,720
Any of the different segments on the Jay Leno show,

559
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:12,480
a show that's a little bit forgotten in the history of television.

560
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,400
They seem particularly enamored, not with the Jay Leno Tonight Show,

561
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:20,960
but with the Jay Leno Show, the failed experiment in 2009.

562
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:26,280
And and they, of course, would eventually get into Jay's other four shows,

563
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:29,160
primetime shows that he did until he was 110.

564
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:37,000
The one that's on your life, Jay Leno, Jay Leno exclamation point.

565
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,840
Jay Leno exclamation point.

566
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,240
You'll get to it.

567
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:44,440
And for some reason, the Dean Martin show starring Jay Leno.

568
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:47,040
Very weird reboot.

569
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,520
He bought the rights.

570
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:53,280
So, yes, so that so that is why now we are trying to correct this.

571
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:56,760
Yes. I feel as if it's already occurred because I was going to say,

572
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:59,480
what would you like to say about the other Tower of Terror?

573
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,720
We need to give you the opportunity.

574
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,920
You've already said an amazing thing.

575
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,120
That was why I requested it.

576
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,720
Yes, because it was so traumatic.

577
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:10,520
I had a story because I'm a big fan of the Twilight Zone TV show.

578
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,960
But now I got out the whole reason I.

579
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:17,720
Right. So we've corrected a totally fine cosmic wrong.

580
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:22,400
Oh, good. I was just saying the one other shot that I of course remember

581
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:26,320
that you've called for a long time is that eventually M.M.C.

582
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:29,440
Oh, yes, will be done on.

583
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,320
I think we said Patreon, but who knows?

584
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:34,600
Yeah, the party is what we've talked about talking about before.

585
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,800
The party separately from M.M.C.

586
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:39,080
I think it was specifically the party. Yes.

587
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,840
I mean, I'm all about for once.

588
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:43,560
I am excited about subdivisions in our top.

589
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,320
Right. Yes. Comes to this.

590
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,880
Now I'm on board.

591
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,320
I would gladly do full party. That's.

592
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:51,160
Yeah. Especially for a page.

593
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:53,200
Is to tie. Yeah. Yeah.

594
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:57,400
So that eventually for their what specific is when you say M.M.C.

595
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,000
or you're referring to the 90s Mickey.

596
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,640
No, obviously.

597
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,600
Yeah, the 90s because the party should have a 50s on.

598
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,440
I have nothing to say about that.

599
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,720
Give me Christina.

600
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,440
Nothing to say about the Mickey Mouse Club.

601
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,600
I net. I still will call my shot.

602
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:15,800
Well, eventually we'll do a net solo music career.

603
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,280
So we'll get to do that episode.

604
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:20,200
We will. We have to do that.

605
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,640
But this is specifically the party.

606
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:24,360
And I'm not even that big of a party at Lindsay and Scott or the party.

607
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,560
They're they're the ones that know the most about the party.

608
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,240
I have to be honest. Huge, huge, huge M.M.C.

609
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,800
I don't know really anything about the party.

610
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:30,960
I'm excited to talk about it anyway.

611
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,240
I remember them existing.

612
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,920
And I remember that some of the M.M.C.

613
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:36,160
broke off into the party and did music that way.

614
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,680
And then also there was separately the M.M.C.

615
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,560
who just sunk a real talk. It's very good.

616
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,760
That was a couple of years later.

617
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,280
So I will learn about the party.

618
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,720
I'm excited to learn about.

619
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,520
You met someone from the party.

620
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,400
Yes. Correct. Which one?

621
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,640
Dee Dee. Dee Dee.

622
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,760
Because she is the voice of Pearl on Steven Universe.

623
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:57,640
And I happen the week I started Infinity Train.

624
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:00,920
Of course, this could probably be better safe for the party episode.

625
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:03,520
I'll be fast. The week I started Infinity Train, I said,

626
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:07,800
do you think that Dee Dee is just like wandering the halls?

627
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:08,680
And they were like, I don't know.

628
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,320
She could be here to record one day.

629
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,200
End of the week, there was a Steven Universe ice cream truck.

630
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,440
And there she was. And I got a picture with her.

631
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,120
It was so exciting.

632
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:20,200
Wow. That's a good manifestation.

633
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,440
Yeah. It's a premonition in a good way.

634
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,760
Such an amazing moment.

635
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:28,320
I did a song by the party in my fourth grade talent show.

636
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,080
It was a Dee Dee song.

637
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,520
Whoa. And you met Dee Dee.

638
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,320
And you thought maybe you could meet Dee Dee.

639
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,880
Dee Dee does cool things, evidently.

640
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:39,120
Dee Dee Magno Hall. Magano Hall?

641
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,280
Well, we'll know for the episode.

642
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:43,920
Well, yeah, we'll have that ready to go by then.

643
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,000
OK, so party coming.

644
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,880
Extremely nice.

645
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:50,200
So so yeah, tower like we're talking we can do any towers.

646
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,160
We can talk. We haven't done a full Guardians one,

647
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:55,960
but we'll talk towers specifically about Tokyo, Disney Sea,

648
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:57,960
which is awesome.

649
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:01,120
We've been in 2006, just to say a fact, not a didn't open with the park.

650
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,080
Opened five years later.

651
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,200
Big edition. Amazing edition.

652
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,960
By the way, I think, yeah, we do.

653
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,000
All right. So we did the Twilight Zone without you.

654
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,800
But I think this is a stellar attraction that you've been on for sure.

655
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:19,000
And it's I don't want to talk to you about it on the Tokyo episode.

656
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,040
Oh, yeah. Yeah. We tried to not.

657
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:24,040
We try. We say some of it.

658
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:26,000
We but we did a sort of a brief explanation.

659
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,640
We also started a hashtag to get Jason

660
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,560
a role as one of the characters on the ride. Of course.

661
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,840
Smelding. Is it smelding or smedling?

662
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:37,400
Smell smelding. Smelding.

663
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,560
Smell before the day.

664
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,520
Yeah. OK. So we'll get to smell.

665
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:40,960
We'll talk.

666
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:43,840
Slemding. I think it's a fell before all of this.

667
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,720
Slemding. Slemding.

668
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:48,120
Slemding. Snap into a slim Jim.

669
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,920
So we'll we'll talk about the characters.

670
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:53,760
But yeah, we have we've done a brief, hopefully brief.

671
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:56,920
If we go back, it's probably a half hour discussion about this.

672
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,160
I wouldn't. It is so.

673
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:01,080
Absolutely everything. Folks, if we haven't said this before,

674
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:03,680
Tokyo Disney Sea, Tokyo Disney itself is great.

675
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:07,800
But the detail like I've forgotten

676
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:11,280
way more about the details of Tokyo Disney Sea

677
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:14,800
and this ride specifically, then it like there's so much stuff

678
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,480
in the queue that you don't even notice.

679
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,160
Like I think we brought it up maybe on the episode,

680
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:21,480
but there are just a bunch of like busty

681
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:25,560
lady statues in the outdoor queue. So funny.

682
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:27,520
I don't. So fucking funny.

683
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:30,560
It's really funny because the main character that they've created

684
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:33,160
that looks like Joe Rody, which is Harrison Hightower, who's like

685
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:37,040
a monster. Played by Joe Rody in the commercial.

686
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,960
Yes. Like the live action thing.

687
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,480
It is Joe Rody. Yeah.

688
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:44,240
And he's like a monster turn of the century capitalist who.

689
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,000
William Randolph Hearst type.

690
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,920
Yeah. Who pillages from different peoples around the world.

691
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:53,320
Takes their valuable items and brings them back.

692
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:58,040
Yes. And then store them in this tower, oddly predating

693
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,600
the eventually Joe Rody guided Guardians of the Galaxy

694
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,280
mission break. Yes. The collector.

695
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:05,200
Yes. Pre collector.

696
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:08,680
He has collected and the blueprint for the collector.

697
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,240
Yes. And it's all all of his stuff.

698
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:13,720
I guess the like the there's a lot of like collect.

699
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,920
He collects stuff. He collects things, actually.

700
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:18,880
I think he goes to like different places around the world,

701
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:22,840
like, for instance, the Everest queue, which Everest is a ride he worked on.

702
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:26,800
And he goes and buys things from locals and then puts them in the queue

703
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:29,040
and decorates that to make that feel more authentic.

704
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:32,640
So he's somebody I think who ethically goes around the world,

705
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:37,000
takes things and brings them back and uses them for, you know, immersion.

706
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,920
And yes, very interesting way.

707
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:43,920
Yeah. Howersen Hightower is like goatee Spock, like mirrors, mirrors.

708
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:46,400
Spock, Joe Rody. He does. Yes.

709
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,640
That is a funny way to think of him.

710
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:50,960
Yeah. So that's I guess that's the goof is that it's funny

711
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,920
that he's the opposite of Joe Rody.

712
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:57,080
And in the queue, I guess if you were had like some like mad man

713
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:59,600
who would be like, yes, put busty women.

714
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:02,240
Yeah, busty stinxes. And you pointed it out.

715
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,720
I don't know to something like that.

716
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:05,440
First of all, I would never.

717
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,960
You were the one who pointed it out.

718
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:11,040
Mike playing it very safe because he was finally released from the dog house.

719
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,160
He's in the dog house.

720
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:16,680
He had to be slight at Lindsay not having her on the first Tower of Terror episode.

721
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,320
That is true.

722
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:22,280
He couldn't be on video Zoom because it was so damn dark in that dog house.

723
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:28,400
So damn dark in that dog house.

724
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,160
Yes, that is true.

725
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,720
But yeah, no, Lindsay pointed it out.

726
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:36,520
She goes, all these statues are like have big breasts.

727
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:40,120
Yes. I go, that is a very ridiculous, funny detail.

728
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:45,760
So you're saying this is like some some funny trashy decorating by this.

729
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:50,200
I'm sorry to go there, but this like this New York socialite

730
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,320
who's kind of a shithead. Sure.

731
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,320
Colinizer. Yeah, yeah.

732
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:58,640
But you're saying specifically maybe a parallel to a modern day New York.

733
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,280
Yeah. Businessman shithead.

734
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:02,920
I don't say his name. Yeah, I don't say his name, but like

735
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:07,080
a T.R. asterisk M and then one more asterisk.

736
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,840
I do. I give it to. Yeah.

737
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:12,760
It would only be it would be all more appropriate if it was like a golden toilet

738
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:15,640
was inside the Tower of Terror.

739
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:19,400
But like it's like it's not quite as good, honestly, not quite as gaudy.

740
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,560
The Tokyo Disney Sea Tower.

741
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:22,800
Oh, no, no, no, no.

742
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:25,280
Well, it was an era where you couldn't be as much.

743
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:27,960
But yeah, it had.

744
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:30,840
Excellent taste.

745
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:35,200
But also clearly had his preference with the ladies. Sure. Yeah.

746
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:38,960
And then leaving the ride as well.

747
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,680
Just I read about I saw these pictures.

748
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,720
This was so funny to me. The gift shop.

749
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,240
I think ridiculous.

750
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:48,640
When you leave, it's like this video I watched earlier

751
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:51,080
is to remind myself what the ride was like pointed out.

752
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:54,280
It's like and then when you leave, it's it's sort of done in the motif

753
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:56,480
of this like bathhouse in New York.

754
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,400
And I and I was like, oh, my God, I can't believe I forgot

755
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:02,240
about the end of the ride, which is just a bunch of murals

756
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:07,200
of Harrison Hightower being bathed by different women of different cultures.

757
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,720
Like it's insane.

758
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:12,800
Oh, we're getting massages in a bathing pool.

759
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:15,280
And yes, like a bunch of them and being portrayed.

760
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:18,080
Oh, man. And it's all like done.

761
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:23,200
Like I feel like it all falls under like the like it's it's hard

762
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:26,760
is the right place because the character dies because of his arrogance

763
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,400
and what he's been doing. For sure.

764
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:31,720
Yeah. So it's like making fun of this type of person.

765
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:35,920
And it does it down to the detail, like down to the very small details.

766
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,720
And yeah, you like stuff that I don't even know.

767
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:43,360
Like the stuff that's probably not even mentioned online,

768
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:47,640
because like no one's even documented it down to looking for photos.

769
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:51,040
And like I, I was sure I'd forgotten

770
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:54,280
so many, many good details. Right.

771
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:57,600
So they've they have crafted and that's like I've said on the episode,

772
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:01,680
like the detail in Disney Sea in general is like you go on,

773
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:04,800
just look at plaques under like the elevated train.

774
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:09,680
And they've just written paragraphs and paragraphs of like jokes

775
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:13,840
and explanation and like backstory for everything.

776
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:16,080
That's like part historical part joke.

777
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:19,800
And like you it's just there's I bet you would never run out of like

778
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:23,280
learning some silly thing they made up for this whole place.

779
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:26,440
Set by how fast the line was moving.

780
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:32,600
Because I wanted to be I wanted to look at all of this insane detail on this queue.

781
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:36,760
Yeah, it's really yeah, it really feels like I don't have enough.

782
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:37,720
I have not seen enough.

783
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:42,160
And there's all these photos and like all the photos aren't online either.

784
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:46,080
I saw I mean, maybe there if you really dig, but I found a blog of the artist

785
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:48,560
who did some of them. Oh, wow.

786
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:51,040
And let me find his name here.

787
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:55,040
But it's yeah, on top of while you're looking for that,

788
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:59,320
when you're in the queue, talking about how he either will like

789
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:04,080
buy the artifacts or just steal them if the culture doesn't want him to have them.

790
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:06,520
Like he's stealing an Easter Island head.

791
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:09,560
And it's always him like grandly leaving,

792
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:15,240
followed by smelting, being chased by very angry locals,

793
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:18,880
trying to get their and their property back.

794
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,240
Right. And smelting is like on the verge of death.

795
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,680
Yeah. And smelting is always like more danger.

796
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,720
Obviously, he's Harrison Brunt.

797
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:28,080
Yeah. The Smithers to the Burns.

798
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,280
For sure.

799
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:32,960
The guy who is who did a lot of the paint is Kate Sean Sullivan.

800
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:37,560
And yeah, he did like stuff like the, you know,

801
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:43,640
that you can see that we describe that it's yeah, it's Harrison Hightower.

802
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:46,040
And I'm not sure which country he's in, but he's there's three women.

803
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:47,240
They're ones bringing him fruit.

804
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:49,520
The others bring him fruit and ones massaging him.

805
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:53,200
He's got like a blanket over his butt and he's like wearing whatever,

806
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,080
you know, ceremonial head.

807
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:57,000
He's on a massage table.

808
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,280
Yeah. Yeah.

809
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:02,960
And it's like, yeah, made to look like an old drawing as if he was a god being

810
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,160
service. Yeah.

811
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,800
At the end of this Disney ride.

812
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:11,680
Rendered in the most beautiful like this is if you haven't been to Tokyo,

813
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,760
Disney, see they really do.

814
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:17,760
They traffic in this like pre 20th

815
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:21,320
century architecture and artwork.

816
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:23,440
It's like they cover.

817
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:29,480
I'm not enough of an art historian or anything to call out styles.

818
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:34,000
But you see like just ornate paintings of every variety.

819
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,600
It feels like the Renaissance.

820
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:38,440
It feels like so many like different eras.

821
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:40,600
Yes. Oh, they just like like Sorin.

822
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:43,040
I haven't. I saw in Fantastic Flight.

823
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,880
Their version of Sorin was not there when I was there.

824
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:49,880
But you want I've watched videos since and like, God, just like the level

825
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:54,720
of architecture and like how Sorin's essentially a box in.

826
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:58,840
Yes. In California, you don't even see where you are really in Epcot.

827
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:03,360
And then here it's just these beautiful grounds with beautiful paintings.

828
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:08,960
And that's why I've like super encouraged people who aren't even major

829
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:11,960
into theme parks like you have to go to Tokyo, Disney, see anyway,

830
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:14,720
because it's like walking around a museum that has rides.

831
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:19,360
Well, it's literally that era of the United States with its architecture

832
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:21,080
and its fashion and everything.

833
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:23,400
It's literally called the Gilded Age.

834
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,080
All right. Right. Yeah.

835
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:28,440
It is like you would I would even add on theme park person if they were

836
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:31,760
had a decent amount of time in Tokyo, I would say like, yeah,

837
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:34,440
like if you're a theme park person, go to Tokyo, Disney for sure.

838
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:38,840
But just go to a Tokyo Disney Day one day to see what they've done.

839
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:44,240
To see it just to see the the level of theming and because, yeah, it is.

840
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:47,360
Again, it's another level that I would.

841
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:52,560
It's hard for me to picture a person who wouldn't get something out of it,

842
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:56,480
even if it was never expressed any theme park interest or desires.

843
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:58,240
Yeah, it is. It is.

844
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:01,280
And we fall asleep dreaming of it after you go.

845
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,760
Yeah, true. Yeah.

846
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,200
It's emotional to leave.

847
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:10,680
Yes. This ride building specifically, the the is inspired by

848
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:15,680
Gothic revival architecture and Moorish revival architecture,

849
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,760
which I read some site pointed out

850
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:25,080
was very popular around the turn of the century and in the late 1800s

851
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:30,720
as Europe and America and like the West was pillaging Africa

852
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,080
and the Middle East. Right.

853
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,520
A lot of this architecture.

854
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:37,040
So even the architecture plays into the story of this

855
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:39,520
globetrotting pillager.

856
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,120
It's co-opting. Yeah.

857
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:46,480
That's who was building at the time was a bunch of freaking colonizing tycoons.

858
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,880
Right. Like all the money in the world.

859
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:51,240
And that's like, yeah, like it's so weird.

860
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:53,160
Disney is an insane corporation.

861
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:57,640
But then like Joe Brody is like getting in some like historical facts.

862
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:00,000
And like, if you really dig into it, you go.

863
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:03,200
They're satirizing themselves in a way. Sure.

864
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,960
Maybe they maybe don't even realize.

865
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:07,680
Well, yeah, I'm sure.

866
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:11,720
But yeah, it's I was going to show you there's one other photo that

867
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:14,040
smelding is in there like in a hot air balloon.

868
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:16,960
They're stealing like that was one of my guys.

869
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,200
And then like a mummy or like a mummified corpse is falling on smelding

870
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:27,240
as Harrison Iteras, I get away in this balloon.

871
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:31,640
How much character you get out of these characters who don't really

872
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:35,080
appear that the Hightower is in the pre-show in the video.

873
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:37,720
Smelding is not at all. Right.

874
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:42,000
So it's but you get what they are completely from those paintings.

875
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:44,640
The other thing I want to say about the building,

876
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:49,600
it's the same same shape as the it's the this thing is largely the same as the

877
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:52,160
it's the T it's the Tower of Terror T

878
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:55,600
largely the same, especially as the newer tower,

879
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:59,680
the non original tower of terror is the one in the Paris one.

880
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:04,640
However, that level of architectural detail and just every

881
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:08,840
just so many turrets and moldings and balcony like you could just stare

882
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:11,320
at individual things on it for hours and hours.

883
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:12,440
I want to say this.

884
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:17,480
I think this is the most beautiful Disney building

885
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,920
that's supposed to look like a building.

886
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:23,800
I don't know if I'd say this is cooler than a volcano or cooler than any beloved

887
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:29,840
fake rocks, but I think a building building and I count the castles in that.

888
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:32,440
I think this is better than any castle.

889
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:33,560
Interesting.

890
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:35,080
It is beautiful.

891
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:37,080
Yeah, it is really beautiful.

892
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:38,920
Yeah, I might agree.

893
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:41,440
Hey, I'm sorry to throw castles under the bone.

894
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:45,320
Sorry. Yeah, that's the only thing that kind of makes me like pause.

895
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:48,000
I'm like, oh, but a castle. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

896
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,360
That's it. But I was thinking about it like what I I don't know.

897
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:52,840
Do I like any castle more than I like this building?

898
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:55,000
Hmm. That's an interesting question.

899
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,440
It's certainly an era that I love.

900
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:58,800
It's at the very least tied with the castle cake.

901
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:02,720
At the very least, it's tied.

902
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:08,200
Yes. There's a storyline for the building, too, of that, like

903
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:13,320
Hightower inherited the man, the family mansion, and then just expanded

904
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:17,040
and expanded and built tower and spa and grant.

905
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:20,880
And so this is like it is like in the way that

906
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:24,840
is it San Simeon is the Hearst property?

907
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:27,000
Oh, right.

908
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:31,200
It's like grounds or the Huntington Library in Pasadena,

909
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:34,280
the library and gardens and stuff used to be like an estate.

910
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:37,000
And now it's like a garden.

911
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:41,240
You can pay and go to the art galleries and see if you guys ever been to Hearst's

912
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:43,240
Castle. I have not actually.

913
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:44,560
I haven't either. I haven't.

914
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,560
That's stupid. We all live in California.

915
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,160
Why have we not been? It's a little.

916
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:49,640
It's such a Disney ish thing.

917
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:53,080
Yeah. Like, you know, they've I think not just for this, but other stuff.

918
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:55,600
Yeah. For sure. Pulled from Hearst Castle.

919
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:57,080
For sure. Yeah.

920
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:58,800
What's it near?

921
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,200
It's far, though, isn't it?

922
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:02,760
It's definitely north.

923
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:07,160
Yeah. But it's not like crazy for us to have tried to visit.

924
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:08,680
No, of course not.

925
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:12,120
But it's big enough that there's multiple different tours.

926
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:15,000
There's like an architecture tour, an art tour.

927
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:19,080
Like there is like a handful of different tours you can take of the property.

928
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:21,400
Six hours away. Yeah.

929
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:23,440
So the next time we're up there.

930
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:26,400
We're not young. Why haven't we been?

931
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,120
We had so much time. It's a good point.

932
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:30,640
I mean, but that could be applied to so many things in life, you know?

933
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:31,960
That's true.

934
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:34,800
But it's like this in particular, being theme park people,

935
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,360
you would think we'd go check out Sure.

936
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:38,040
Castle or like the Winchester Mansion.

937
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:40,120
I've never done some. I've never done the Winchester.

938
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:41,400
Me neither. Yeah.

939
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:42,920
Yeah, I know. We should.

940
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:45,000
So uncultured.

941
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,480
Well, it's a.

942
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,200
I haven't done the real.

943
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:50,800
You're talking about the fake ones.

944
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:51,760
That's what the whole thing is.

945
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:57,040
We're three cowards who just want to go on a simulated version of everything.

946
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:00,440
This is all about unpacking that.

947
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:03,120
Hosted by two,

948
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:09,520
two childless cowards in their 30s and one child having cowardly.

949
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:10,800
Not 30s.

950
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:12,720
You almost got out.

951
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:13,880
I'm starting to look proud.

952
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:15,120
I see you over there.

953
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:16,400
I see you over there.

954
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:19,040
But I didn't make it out of that one.

955
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:20,360
Yeah, Hearst Castle six hours.

956
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:21,720
So, yeah, we're not going to get there.

957
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:22,720
It's too far.

958
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:23,800
Not going to happen.

959
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:29,040
So, yeah, he's gathered all of these items.

960
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:33,080
He's pillaged items, including from I didn't know this tie in this.

961
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:36,960
Didn't have it that there's a oh, what is it?

962
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:44,240
There's there's something that he steals from raging spirits,

963
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:50,600
which is the like ruins type roller coaster over near Indiana Jones.

964
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:52,200
Did I get the name right?

965
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:54,960
And that sounds like that's the one that's the one.

966
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:58,120
That's the one where the employee and I think I said this on the show,

967
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:02,720
the employee ran up to me while we were in the queue and stopped me, kind of panicked

968
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,520
and wanted to know how tall I was.

969
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:09,800
And then they had to bring me over and they kind of like we're talking amongst themselves.

970
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:15,120
And then, like in my mind, begrudgingly sent me through the queue.

971
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:16,960
Like I had just hit the limit.

972
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:18,600
You can't be taller than me.

973
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,040
Wow. And I was like, oh, good.

974
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:24,040
So like I was like kind of ducking the whole time on the ride.

975
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:28,440
I grabbed him and I said, just so you know, I love you.

976
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:32,360
Yes. And I felt much better after that.

977
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:33,880
I think you had to say it there.

978
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:34,440
Yeah, that's true.

979
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:36,200
This is a high risk of decapitation.

980
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:38,240
But like, yeah, I didn't I didn't realize that tight.

981
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:41,520
That coaster opened around the same time, I think, and they made a connection

982
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:46,200
where not only that, he's there's artwork of him stealing from those ruins.

983
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:49,720
Right. But then there's also high tower crates in the line.

984
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:53,800
So that so they make it one of those Disney things that they're seeding

985
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:57,640
and connecting the attractions. Pretty neat. Bunch of fun nerds.

986
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:59,720
Yep. Yeah.

987
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:07,640
But he so he steals a lot from all around the world, but then he goes too far.

988
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:10,000
He he pushes it.

989
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:12,160
He pushes his luck a bit too much.

990
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:17,120
And he goes to an African village and takes

991
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:22,080
this little idol guy, Shereekee Atundu. Yes.

992
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:28,320
And I think the the backstory that I now have learned is that

993
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:34,320
he initially is trying to find a gentlemanly way to get it.

994
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:38,040
And then they say, no, we this is our God.

995
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:39,440
Right. Very valuable.

996
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:41,560
We there's no amount of money.

997
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:42,920
And then he just takes it.

998
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:46,600
But unlike in these other scenarios where Smelding gets chased

999
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:48,960
and they throw stuff at him.

1000
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:53,160
Oh, interestingly enough, in this instance,

1001
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:57,080
they don't seem to want it back too much.

1002
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:59,160
They don't put up a fight.

1003
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:01,000
They're smoking. Go ahead.

1004
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,560
They're like they seem like OK with it for some reason.

1005
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:05,480
Yeah. So go ahead.

1006
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:07,280
Take take Shereekee.

1007
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:10,000
And he just doesn't think anything of it.

1008
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:15,560
But we learn more about this story in this pre show room,

1009
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:18,840
because it's like it's the format of the other towers here where there's the general cue.

1010
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:21,640
You start in a garden, you end up in the indoor lobby.

1011
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:23,600
You see a crashed elevator.

1012
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:24,720
You see a crash. Yeah.

1013
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:27,440
Which that's very cool, that particular facet.

1014
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:29,120
Like warped door.

1015
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:32,400
Yeah. With columns that have cracked.

1016
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:34,040
The whole thing's just caved in.

1017
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:38,320
Yeah. And the premise is like the preservation society is giving you this tour

1018
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:39,920
and explaining what happened.

1019
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:41,640
So they've got a backstory for it.

1020
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:44,960
Yes, they've got a backstory for that, too, which makes a lot of sense.

1021
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:47,240
Why would you even get to be here?

1022
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:50,960
This is like we already know from that that this is a crime scene,

1023
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:53,080
possibly a murder scene.

1024
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:55,000
So why is there even anything?

1025
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,880
And it's because, yeah, this preservation society has opened it to the public

1026
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:00,160
because they're trying to save it.

1027
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:04,240
It is a historical landmark, even though an evil guy lived there. Right.

1028
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:08,240
Which I like that aspect of it, too, that there's all this signage

1029
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:13,080
that's very old timey World's Fair, like come and see the marvelous.

1030
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:17,640
And they even justify that phrase Tower of Terror with little quotes.

1031
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:21,320
It feels like a carnival barker kind of phrase. Yes. Yes.

1032
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:27,160
But Miss Beatrice Rose Indicott doesn't cotton to that.

1033
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:29,240
She's the head of the preservation society.

1034
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:31,240
She doesn't believe in such things.

1035
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:34,720
Cotton. Yes. Yeah.

1036
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:37,880
So lots of good names that I had not encountered before.

1037
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:40,960
I didn't know her fit the head of the preservation society's name.

1038
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:46,520
And also the reporter who enter, who like asks a question that you hear on the

1039
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:50,680
the the recording is named Manfred Strang.

1040
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:53,480
Whoa. I missed that one.

1041
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:56,360
Jason to see I'm not going to declare them official

1042
00:48:56,360 --> 00:49:00,320
see members, but seems like they could be a good way in.

1043
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:02,600
Ronald DeMore, you know, right.

1044
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:04,560
Could be good audience, you know.

1045
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:07,320
And hey, if you want to hire four writers,

1046
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:10,360
you're listening to them.

1047
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:13,000
Oh, well, three writers and one smelting.

1048
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:16,400
Right. Right. Right.

1049
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:18,800
Yeah. Jason, for smelting, I would get that going again.

1050
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:23,520
I listen, Ronnie, I just play sniveling.

1051
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:26,720
I will snivel my heart out in real life, too.

1052
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:31,280
You look up sniveling in the dictionary.

1053
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:32,560
It's Jason Sheridan, folks.

1054
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:35,840
I'm not willing to wriggle or wiggle, but you're willing to sniff.

1055
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:38,560
I'll sniff a little. Very.

1056
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:42,840
So, yeah, this pre show room, it's the equivalent of the

1057
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:46,320
Florida Tower terror or the former the rocket room

1058
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:49,640
where you're divided up into a smaller group and you get a little like

1059
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:51,360
a little backstory.

1060
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:53,040
But it's not the Rod Serling video.

1061
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:57,400
It's this neat little scene with a preservation society member

1062
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:03,680
press and play on an old phonograph and which like now.

1063
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:08,280
That's what's on the record is a you hear what it what is.

1064
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:09,680
It's a final interview.

1065
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:13,200
OK, where they the man, Fred Strang, S.

1066
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:15,160
Isn't it cursed?

1067
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:21,000
Isn't the idol curse the idol, by the way, apparently translates to

1068
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:24,000
the name of the idol translates to believe the misfortune.

1069
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:30,680
And on the Disney Wiki, there is a long

1070
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:35,720
bio, there's a long history about the lineage of the idol.

1071
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:38,440
Like, there is a long backstory. Of course, there is.

1072
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:40,840
They went hard with all this backstory.

1073
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,880
They did not have to go that hard, but they did.

1074
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:47,560
Yes. Well, that's the as the youth say.

1075
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:52,160
They were not required to go thus hardly.

1076
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:56,400
But they did. Yeah.

1077
00:50:56,440 --> 00:51:00,240
Yeah. So there's like there's like a description for just the like

1078
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:02,240
the fast service eateries.

1079
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:06,000
There's like a lot of like stuff I've forgotten about eating a cheap piece

1080
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,160
of pizza in Tokyo. Yeah.

1081
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:09,760
Yeah. Everything is something.

1082
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:17,000
So, yeah, he's scoffing at the idea that this curse is real.

1083
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:21,640
But then is it that forgive me for not remembering the order exactly.

1084
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:27,160
But there is a stained glass portrait of Hightower

1085
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:28,800
in the room the whole time.

1086
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:33,160
And then it shatters or changes or comes to life to life.

1087
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:36,040
And the voice of Harrison Hightower

1088
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:40,120
possesses the gramophone.

1089
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:42,000
Is that what that's? Yeah.

1090
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:46,080
Oh, phonographs to you somehow through what you were.

1091
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:47,480
What is that for? Yeah.

1092
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:50,840
The gramophone thing, the phonograph that you're listening to.

1093
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:54,840
And he all of a sudden you're getting his voice through that.

1094
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:58,320
And he has come to life in the in the stained glass,

1095
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:01,720
the beautiful stained glass window that is kind of evocative of

1096
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:05,240
Beauty and the Beast opening stained glass.

1097
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:07,120
Oh, yeah. Yeah, for sure.

1098
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:08,680
Mm hmm. It's beautiful.

1099
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:09,800
And yeah, it transformed.

1100
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:12,600
And this is also this is all like this still looks great

1101
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:14,720
from my memory in person. Yeah.

1102
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:16,240
And it's like already. Yeah. What?

1103
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:18,360
Fifteen years old. Yes.

1104
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:20,440
Oh, and the idol is there.

1105
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:21,600
Yes. Yes. All next to it.

1106
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:23,840
And the all time in the room. Yeah.

1107
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:26,440
Displayed or nearly on this pedestal.

1108
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:27,880
They did it 15 years old.

1109
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:32,720
Yeah. It opened in September 2006, which is only five years after this park opened.

1110
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:37,360
Again, they didn't have to go that like they just rolled out a new e ticket

1111
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:40,200
five years in, which they had plenty of stuff.

1112
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:41,440
Yeah, it's not.

1113
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:45,200
We've we talked on the last one about like the Tower of Terror,

1114
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:50,680
not the original so much, but in the other cases in Anaheim

1115
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:54,560
and Paris, it is like we got to save this crappy park. Right.

1116
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:58,240
Rush this ride in and in a lesser way here.

1117
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:02,120
They do it. Let's like like we already had this amazing park.

1118
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:03,320
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1119
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:05,000
They didn't. Yeah. Exactly.

1120
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,440
Didn't it? Didn't you go there? Right.

1121
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:09,880
And it is like a clone of the ride itself.

1122
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:13,280
But they went that way, way extra mile,

1123
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:18,280
which is original story and mythology and just great art direction.

1124
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:21,960
It's incredible thread and crazy magic.

1125
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:24,800
And that is really the big thing here. Right.

1126
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:28,120
Is that then you get through this, you get the stained glass demonstration

1127
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:30,560
of what the fell high tower.

1128
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:32,960
You don't really get the details yet, but you see

1129
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:38,680
this green spirit light up and go all the way to the top of the tower.

1130
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:41,400
And then there's a shatter and then he plummets down to the bottom.

1131
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:44,320
Now we know what happened in the lobby.

1132
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:47,600
And then the idol.

1133
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:52,280
Well, it goes dark and a bunch of sparkly lights.

1134
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:55,760
Yes. Like take its place.

1135
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:59,200
This like very like original Tower of Terror.

1136
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:02,200
Yeah. Where all these crazy lights come from.

1137
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:06,760
He comes to life, smiles with these horrible piranha teeth.

1138
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:10,440
He's so like affecting and scary and creepy.

1139
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:17,200
And then, yeah, sparkly lights come up, only eyes visible.

1140
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:20,640
And the room is only dark for a second.

1141
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:24,200
And when the lights come back up, the idol has disappeared.

1142
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:26,560
It is shocking. Yeah.

1143
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:27,960
It is such a good.

1144
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:34,320
It's a really good special effect that I still am not exactly sure what it is.

1145
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:35,800
I know what it is, too.

1146
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:41,720
And I was borderline disappointed in how simple it is.

1147
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:44,040
I know generally what it is, but it's still there.

1148
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:46,480
You want to do it, idiot?

1149
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:48,000
Yeah, yeah.

1150
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,320
I mean, it's so it's up on this pedestal,

1151
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:53,640
but then it drops and it goes inside the bed.

1152
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:56,360
There's a yes, faster than free fall.

1153
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:57,880
Yeah, it's like so.

1154
00:54:57,880 --> 00:55:03,800
So, yeah, it basically while that half second is dark, it shoots into the ground.

1155
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:09,400
Yeah, but it feels like there's some leftover light to kind of like quickly.

1156
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:12,200
Your brain doesn't have time to even notice that.

1157
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:15,120
So literally your brain recognizes that it has appeared.

1158
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:16,840
Yeah, it's so instantaneous.

1159
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:22,280
We speculated on how they did the effect, and it was all like way more complicated,

1160
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:23,480
wasn't it? Or am I thinking?

1161
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:24,560
No, no, no.

1162
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:29,000
I think we were trying to figure out if it was some sort of projection on a base,

1163
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:32,360
like the back of it might have been a base that had the outline of it or something,

1164
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:34,320
and it like gave it some dimension.

1165
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:37,160
We were like doing all these like tricks way too much.

1166
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:42,400
But I think, yeah, I think maybe there is some sort of like your eyes,

1167
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:47,000
like light stays with your eyes a couple like milliseconds longer.

1168
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:52,160
So while the darkness is there, your eyes maybe even see it like lit up.

1169
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:54,560
So you think it's there a couple extra beats.

1170
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:56,200
Yeah, I think so. After it's gone.

1171
00:55:56,200 --> 00:56:01,840
And also its eyes being lit up within the sparkly starryness.

1172
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:04,720
It's like, oh, it's definitely still there.

1173
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:06,040
Yeah, there's like a couple.

1174
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:07,880
But it's not. That must be a projection.

1175
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:10,160
Are the eyes separate? That's what I was going to ask.

1176
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:14,760
Yeah, I think the eyes that are lit up while the effect is going

1177
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:17,600
are not the eyes of the actual statue.

1178
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:19,920
Maybe. I think that that's a projection.

1179
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:21,360
And that hangs for one.

1180
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:25,080
Yeah, hangs for one extra second and takes completely takes your brain away

1181
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:29,200
from like being able to recognize that the actual item is moved into the ground.

1182
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:32,240
But then you say that like it drops into the pedestal.

1183
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:33,560
But I still have some questions.

1184
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:36,320
One is it looks too big to fit in that pedestal.

1185
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:40,760
I agree. I have not seen it do it, but that's what I've heard it is.

1186
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:42,160
Yeah, but I could be.

1187
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:44,440
I haven't heard it from Joe Rody. So maybe.

1188
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:48,960
I heard it from YouTube, which is notoriously reliable.

1189
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:51,440
Yeah, so famously so.

1190
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:55,920
There's another detail, too, that we didn't mention with this stained glass.

1191
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:58,680
I thought this was really cool.

1192
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:02,000
And it lingers for the rest of this pre-show room

1193
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:06,560
when that energy field like appears and like drops

1194
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:11,240
in the elevator shaft on the stained glass, it cracks the bottom where the lobby is

1195
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:16,280
as if the stained glass cracked and then it stays like that as you're leaving.

1196
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:19,200
Oh, like it affects the glass on the way.

1197
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:20,280
Wow. Wow. Yeah.

1198
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:23,480
As if the energy itself broke it. Yeah.

1199
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:26,600
And it does. It looks broken after that. Yeah.

1200
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:31,160
It is. There's a bunch of other energy stuff throughout the ride, like that.

1201
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:35,120
You see the energy from the ground up in the penthouse,

1202
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:39,200
then it travels to the elevator that's dropping. It's wild.

1203
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:41,640
Yeah, it's again, I forgot more.

1204
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:45,400
Why do you watching the YouTube video even is like feels like one

1205
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:48,640
eighth the experience of being there? Yeah.

1206
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:52,440
If that because you're just in a hate, you're just like you're not processing

1207
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:54,800
all this when you're there, just like, whoa, that was cool.

1208
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:56,280
And then it's so bright.

1209
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:58,400
Like the details aren't really hitting you.

1210
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:01,040
There's so much to take in. Yeah. Yeah.

1211
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:06,680
Now, there is a thing you bring up like Joe Rody and like the tricks of the.

1212
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:11,000
Here's something I was mistaken about, I think, until the behind

1213
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,080
the attraction show came out.

1214
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:16,840
So I'm looking at all these photos of Rody

1215
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:21,400
the Imagineer playing this larger than life

1216
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:25,040
villainous guy and in these scenarios where he's a god and where he's

1217
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:26,360
being bathed by women.

1218
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:28,960
And I'm like, OK, I know this is supposed to be like a shitty guy.

1219
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:32,440
This is still crazy in an ego way.

1220
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:36,840
Oh, right. So in all this stuff, I didn't realize until behind the attraction.

1221
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:39,200
He didn't do this attraction.

1222
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:41,440
He was completely a model.

1223
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:45,960
And as he explains in the show, they asked him to do one thing.

1224
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:48,320
They asked him to be a model.

1225
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:53,040
They were going to do like a plaster cast of him for like this is going to be like

1226
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:54,400
he has some weird word.

1227
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:56,920
I don't know what it is, but it's on the outside of the building.

1228
00:58:57,120 --> 00:59:00,000
There was supposed to be one molding of this character and that was it.

1229
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:02,480
And then suddenly, like, actually, we're going to do some paintings and stuff.

1230
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:04,480
Actually, we might do a video.

1231
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:09,360
Actually, the ride is opening and you need to come to Japan and film commercials

1232
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:15,320
as an actor, you the imagineer are now a Japanese actor like Schwarzenegger

1233
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:18,000
filming weird commercials for like a watch.

1234
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:20,640
Yeah, yeah. He didn't do the ride.

1235
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:22,960
He didn't. I did not remember that.

1236
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:24,560
Didn't know that until this.

1237
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:29,240
Well, it does make sense because of the collecting aspect, because it does feel right.

1238
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:31,160
Yeah, it feels thematically.

1239
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:33,880
And it's confusing because he did do Guardians.

1240
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:37,760
I was just about to say, because like that's got his like classic like

1241
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:42,320
we probably didn't need this much of an explanation as to what's going on with

1242
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:44,960
the ride, but thank you so much for all the hard work.

1243
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:47,120
Yes, it does smell like road.

1244
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:48,640
And so I just figured.

1245
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:52,480
But I was going to say it's interesting that like

1246
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:57,600
before you told me that it's not his ride, I was going to say it doesn't have that

1247
00:59:57,800 --> 01:00:02,520
hallmark of him is like there's not there's the story.

1248
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:06,640
But it's not like like that was already the Avatar backup.

1249
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:09,000
Get the story.

1250
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:10,880
Yes, yes, that is what I'm saying.

1251
01:00:11,080 --> 01:00:15,480
It's not that complicated a story of what happened to Harrison Hightower.

1252
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:20,920
And yet I know a hallmark of a Joe Rody ride is the complicated backstory of what's

1253
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:25,600
going on. And so I was going to say, isn't that interesting that that's missing on

1254
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:27,480
this ride? And lo and behold, it's not his ride.

1255
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:30,720
That's why. If it would have been there would have been twice as much stuff.

1256
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:31,560
There would have been hands.

1257
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:33,560
Of course, something where you had to wave your arm.

1258
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:36,440
You have to rain your hands or they have to be scanned.

1259
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:37,240
Yes.

1260
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:42,160
Is that where there's like CG animation of the characters in this?

1261
01:00:42,360 --> 01:00:44,080
Is that from TV commercials?

1262
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:45,680
I know. I don't know.

1263
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:46,920
I saw that.

1264
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:48,160
Yeah, we all watch this.

1265
01:00:48,360 --> 01:00:52,120
This is called the Tower of Terror, the mystery that is some

1266
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:56,760
promotional piece that tells this backstory that tells you Harrison Hightower.

1267
01:00:56,960 --> 01:01:00,200
And you see smelting and you see this reporter and all this.

1268
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:02,840
And it is this odd

1269
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:05,160
Polar Express animation.

1270
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:07,800
Yeah, it looks fan made.

1271
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:09,040
Yeah, yeah.

1272
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:11,520
It 100 percent looked fan made to me.

1273
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:16,960
And but I think it's probably just a Japanese marketing campaign.

1274
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:18,880
Yeah, maybe. Or it was like online.

1275
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:22,680
There was a shot of something in the commercial.

1276
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:24,520
Yeah. But then there's live action.

1277
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:26,800
Yeah. Like you were saying, there's filmed live action.

1278
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:31,360
Joe Rody as Harrison Hightower to inner inner cut.

1279
01:01:31,560 --> 01:01:35,840
I saw it in the review time, like short documentary YouTube video.

1280
01:01:36,040 --> 01:01:37,040
That's where I saw it, too.

1281
01:01:37,240 --> 01:01:39,960
Yeah. And I was like, what am I looking at?

1282
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:41,640
It does a good job of explaining it.

1283
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:46,200
And then there's a couple other there's an Attractions magazine right through.

1284
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:49,400
And then there's another right through with a very literal translation.

1285
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:51,160
A lot of the dialogue.

1286
01:01:51,360 --> 01:01:54,560
GM or LMG rides or something like that.

1287
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:56,440
Yeah, this this

1288
01:01:56,640 --> 01:02:02,040
sour cherry, the mystery video, though, is so strange because it tells you the story.

1289
01:02:02,040 --> 01:02:02,720
Here's what happened.

1290
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:05,080
But it's not the thing from the ride and it's not commercials.

1291
01:02:05,080 --> 01:02:07,320
I don't know what medium it existed in exactly.

1292
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:10,080
But not only is there weird video game

1293
01:02:10,280 --> 01:02:14,080
animation, but there are live action actors as well.

1294
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:18,840
This is one of the strangest aesthetic choices I have ever seen leading,

1295
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:23,160
especially to this part where Harrison Hightower is crashed in his lobby.

1296
01:02:23,360 --> 01:02:24,320
Yes, 100 percent.

1297
01:02:24,320 --> 01:02:28,760
I had this thought, too, where, oh, my God, what happened?

1298
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:30,800
Let's go check. They're reaching.

1299
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:34,840
And there is a one man looks in with a lantern.

1300
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:37,320
What happened? And he is a CGI man.

1301
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:40,520
And then another man, a live action man,

1302
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:43,160
leans in and they are right next to each other.

1303
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:46,160
Where have you ever seen this idea?

1304
01:02:46,360 --> 01:02:50,720
Made me think it was fan made or something is I was like, oh, a fan made a composite

1305
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:59,120
of a CGI waiter guy looking in a shaft and then inserted this actual actor behind

1306
01:02:59,320 --> 01:03:02,840
himself. And so I was wondering, like, oh, I wonder what that footage is from then.

1307
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:05,040
But like, no, that was the commercial guy.

1308
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:06,160
I think they made it.

1309
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:10,760
It's just like you've seen live action actors and then cartoony.

1310
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:13,800
Then with Roger Rabbit or Rocky and Bullwinkle or something.

1311
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,840
I've never seen human characters with live action actors.

1312
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:19,400
It's such a it's such a bizarre choice.

1313
01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:21,960
I'm amazed Decker didn't make it.

1314
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:23,600
Absolutely.

1315
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:27,680
That is absolutely the shot that jumped out at me is the weirdest one.

1316
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:30,560
Yeah, right. OK, I'm glad this haunted you as well.

1317
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:33,360
I was like, what am I? Who is that guy behind?

1318
01:03:33,360 --> 01:03:34,800
Who is this man? I don't know.

1319
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:39,160
And what is the choice? Why do you decide that some are

1320
01:03:39,360 --> 01:03:40,800
who's a computer character?

1321
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:44,360
Why is the main character, Harrison Hightower, computerized?

1322
01:03:44,560 --> 01:03:48,600
But then a reporter, this guy staying gets a cast and call.

1323
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:50,880
Somebody's somebody's playing, staying.

1324
01:03:51,080 --> 01:03:53,240
And then on top of that,

1325
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:56,720
all the line, the live action lines are done.

1326
01:03:56,920 --> 01:04:01,960
It's all white actors speaking Japanese, but dubbed over by clear,

1327
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:04,680
like better Japanese speakers.

1328
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:06,360
That's another strange layer.

1329
01:04:06,560 --> 01:04:09,120
Just look up this video. It's so bizarre.

1330
01:04:09,320 --> 01:04:10,920
It all adds to the mystery.

1331
01:04:11,120 --> 01:04:14,440
Right. And there's no there's no oral history of that.

1332
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:15,640
As far as we know.

1333
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:17,960
No, no directors credit.

1334
01:04:18,080 --> 01:04:19,520
We're creating it right now.

1335
01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:25,880
This video adds a good little detail to the story, which is that right before

1336
01:04:26,080 --> 01:04:29,840
his dreaded elevator trip,

1337
01:04:30,040 --> 01:04:31,640
somebody says, what about the curse?

1338
01:04:31,840 --> 01:04:33,080
And he says, oh, the curse.

1339
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:34,400
Here's what I think of it.

1340
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:39,640
And then Hightower takes a cigar, puts it out on the head of the idol.

1341
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:42,400
Yeah, that is, in fact, the final straw for the idol.

1342
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:47,520
Yeah. The reason it happens is because he puts his cigar out on its head.

1343
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:51,320
One of the rules of the idol is you have to show it respect.

1344
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:53,960
And that's not too respectful.

1345
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:57,920
Right. And this is New Year's Eve, 1899.

1346
01:04:58,120 --> 01:04:59,280
Yes.

1347
01:04:59,480 --> 01:05:02,280
Which is also a strike of 12.

1348
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:04,000
The sea connection.

1349
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:06,480
There's that painting of all the sea members.

1350
01:05:06,680 --> 01:05:08,520
The idol is in the painting.

1351
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:14,800
And that painting is supposed to be a meeting that occurred this night.

1352
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:16,440
Oh, before.

1353
01:05:16,560 --> 01:05:20,800
Yes, before he dies, because both he is there and the idol is in the paint.

1354
01:05:20,840 --> 01:05:22,040
They're both in the painting.

1355
01:05:22,040 --> 01:05:26,360
So you're saying that all the other members of sea were there, were in the building.

1356
01:05:26,360 --> 01:05:27,400
Yes, they were at the party.

1357
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:28,560
They were at the big party.

1358
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:31,600
It seems like it was a real rager, not the MMC party.

1359
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:33,240
A regular party.

1360
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:34,880
Yeah. Disney party. Right.

1361
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:36,000
And they all. Yeah.

1362
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:38,600
So this really is we talked about in the actual sea episode.

1363
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:39,840
This makes it harder for Ronald D.

1364
01:05:40,040 --> 01:05:44,120
Moore to make all these guys the heroes of a new show when they're all hanging out

1365
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:47,400
with this insane colonizer thief

1366
01:05:47,600 --> 01:05:50,240
who is disrespecting idols of the party.

1367
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:55,080
They're like, oh, yes, well, well, who better to know how to write that than

1368
01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:58,680
someone in Hollywood? Sure.

1369
01:05:59,720 --> 01:06:03,480
Shoulder to shoulder with villains.

1370
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:09,400
So, yeah, it's the it's like we've said a whole movie now already.

1371
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:11,800
Yeah, this could be a movie.

1372
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:15,640
And all rendered so wonderfully again, like just the it's the best art direction,

1373
01:06:15,840 --> 01:06:19,880
the best lighting, and then you're let into the the boiler room.

1374
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:21,200
I don't know what they call it here.

1375
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:26,360
I don't know if it's still a warehouse is where it stores all the art that isn't up.

1376
01:06:26,360 --> 01:06:28,920
And then you've got even more giant or neat.

1377
01:06:29,120 --> 01:06:33,600
That's where that's where I was like, can we slow the line down?

1378
01:06:33,800 --> 01:06:36,080
I'm looking at all these tiny drawers.

1379
01:06:36,280 --> 01:06:41,400
There were so many drawers and every different load area had sort of a different

1380
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:44,800
specialty. We went we were in one with just like rugs.

1381
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,960
Yeah. And I was like, oh, we got the rug room.

1382
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:49,440
But that's like incredible.

1383
01:06:49,640 --> 01:06:51,640
Like tapestries.

1384
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:52,040
Yeah.

1385
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:57,400
An area Disney I don't think has gotten into is like the ancient art of tapestry.

1386
01:06:57,600 --> 01:07:02,360
It truly is just a beautiful place and a very traditional.

1387
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:07,240
This isn't like we're finding some weird level to think it's neat on.

1388
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:10,480
It is a beautiful building and everyone.

1389
01:07:10,560 --> 01:07:12,440
Yeah. There's a set of eyes.

1390
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:14,760
Well, there are. Yes.

1391
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:18,960
There's a couple different places where you can see the idle presence.

1392
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:21,400
Yeah. Evil green eyes.

1393
01:07:21,600 --> 01:07:25,640
So, you know, you're in for it when you get into this elevator.

1394
01:07:25,840 --> 01:07:28,280
But yeah, it's a the room feels huge.

1395
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:33,240
I don't think it's so much bigger than the regular boiler room for this,

1396
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:35,000
but it feels massive.

1397
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:38,120
I'm sure it's massive, but it's probably about the same.

1398
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:39,400
Exactly the same. Yeah.

1399
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:43,480
Yeah. So because because it is taking and I was thinking maybe I don't know if

1400
01:07:43,480 --> 01:07:44,520
this is the end of the episode.

1401
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:48,360
It is interesting, like taking a ride and taking the exact same ride and then just

1402
01:07:48,360 --> 01:07:51,680
completely making a new it's like if we were taking Haunted Mansion and just

1403
01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:55,400
going like you can have the exact same track, exact same thing, do whatever you

1404
01:07:55,600 --> 01:07:57,440
want with it, make it kind of scary.

1405
01:07:57,640 --> 01:07:58,560
Sure. Yeah.

1406
01:07:58,760 --> 01:07:59,480
Which is interesting.

1407
01:07:59,680 --> 01:08:01,080
Fucking go hog wild.

1408
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:01,880
It is interesting.

1409
01:08:02,080 --> 01:08:03,400
Billion things in it.

1410
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:06,680
Yeah. Like take the pirate boat and just go like whatever you want.

1411
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:12,200
Make them elves just to make it an elf thing or a hobbit thing.

1412
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:14,400
Has even more.

1413
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:15,720
Yeah. Backstory.

1414
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:16,720
Yeah, exactly.

1415
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:17,680
Stopped. Yeah.

1416
01:08:17,880 --> 01:08:21,080
And even just the if you look at the outside of the building, it looks like

1417
01:08:21,280 --> 01:08:24,680
there's four elevator shafts, only three of them are working.

1418
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:30,760
The one that is not an actual functioning ride vehicle elevator shaft is the one

1419
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:33,160
like one of the middle ones.

1420
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:37,920
And it's the one that can most clearly go from the penthouse to the lobby.

1421
01:08:38,120 --> 01:08:39,640
It's the one that he died in.

1422
01:08:39,840 --> 01:08:40,360
Crashed. Yeah.

1423
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:45,360
Yeah. Lines up with the it actually lines up with the spot at the bottom, seemingly

1424
01:08:45,560 --> 01:08:49,520
where the elevator crash and it lines up with his penthouse at the top.

1425
01:08:49,720 --> 01:08:54,840
Also, the top of the T with this with these designed buildings, the top of the T

1426
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:59,240
is because of the massive generators on top of the elevator shafts that run the

1427
01:08:59,440 --> 01:09:02,840
ride, the power of the rides, which I always forget about.

1428
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:04,480
Yeah, I didn't know that.

1429
01:09:04,680 --> 01:09:07,320
Until I watched this review time video.

1430
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:13,800
Yeah. But it gets pretty like, you know, then we're then we're in familiar

1431
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:19,240
territory like like it does feel like the other towers.

1432
01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:21,200
Although, again, you know, like you're sitting.

1433
01:09:21,400 --> 01:09:23,120
Yeah. Yeah.

1434
01:09:23,320 --> 01:09:26,320
And not for me, because I this was the ride.

1435
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:28,520
Oh, yeah. The spell for me.

1436
01:09:28,720 --> 01:09:29,400
Right.

1437
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:31,160
Where Darren was like, are you really

1438
01:09:31,160 --> 01:09:35,200
going to come across the world and then not go on this because you're afraid of

1439
01:09:35,400 --> 01:09:37,480
the good you were afraid of the job?

1440
01:09:37,680 --> 01:09:39,040
She's never made me do anything.

1441
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:41,360
This she's like, you have you'll be so upset if you don't.

1442
01:09:41,360 --> 01:09:42,600
And I was she's absolutely right.

1443
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:44,320
And I did it three times ultimately.

1444
01:09:44,520 --> 01:09:48,360
But it's now why I'm able to do the other ones.

1445
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:51,360
I'm more if I'm afraid of the other ones.

1446
01:09:51,560 --> 01:09:56,280
I just like what's going to remind you of Tokyo, which wasn't scary like at all.

1447
01:09:56,480 --> 01:09:59,320
Once you did it, it was extremely positive.

1448
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:00,240
Mm hmm.

1449
01:10:00,440 --> 01:10:04,400
And even still, like if something because I think the drop pattern is more intense

1450
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:11,840
on Guardians, but I'm like, now that view like now I flash to Tokyo in my mind there.

1451
01:10:12,040 --> 01:10:13,280
It makes me so happy.

1452
01:10:13,480 --> 01:10:15,960
Yeah. And it's a beautiful view.

1453
01:10:16,160 --> 01:10:19,400
And it's a clone of the California Adventure one.

1454
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:22,280
So there is no fourth dimension room word.

1455
01:10:22,480 --> 01:10:23,000
Yeah.

1456
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:25,520
So they do all of the work in the time

1457
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:30,520
and the space they have on the original California Adventure.

1458
01:10:30,720 --> 01:10:33,200
And I would say that's it's sad to say it.

1459
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:36,440
That's the only part of the ride that let me down a little bit.

1460
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:38,600
And I think we both felt the same thing.

1461
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:42,400
I was like, I'm so ready to be scared.

1462
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:46,960
Because it felt like a whole queue is like so building, building up.

1463
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:48,600
And then I'm like, oh, OK, it's basically

1464
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:52,520
just the original California Adventure drop sequence.

1465
01:10:52,520 --> 01:10:55,800
And I know, but it's not as good.

1466
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,720
A little less intense, people say, which helped me.

1467
01:10:58,920 --> 01:11:06,040
But it lifts you up in like so rather than than just dropping you,

1468
01:11:06,240 --> 01:11:10,840
it lifts you up again and then will just like drop you a few floors incrementally

1469
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:12,640
and then one big drop. Yeah.

1470
01:11:12,840 --> 01:11:15,160
And they they change. It's just not as much.

1471
01:11:15,160 --> 01:11:17,000
Right. So we went on the regular version

1472
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:20,120
because they have different versions, different times of year where there are

1473
01:11:20,120 --> 01:11:25,240
like more intense drop sequences, sequences, which why shadow of Cherokee?

1474
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:26,240
Yes. Yeah.

1475
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:27,440
And I forget what you have.

1476
01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:28,880
I don't. It probably doesn't matter that much.

1477
01:11:29,080 --> 01:11:33,880
Like a couple of months where there will be different, more intense versions of it.

1478
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:35,080
Really? Yeah.

1479
01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:37,320
So we want to see a shadow at one.

1480
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:42,720
You see when it's dropping, you see him, the idol

1481
01:11:42,920 --> 01:11:46,320
ripping the cables, the shadow of him ripping the elevator.

1482
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:49,600
The rocket, the rocket plugging in the walkman.

1483
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:50,800
Oh, wow.

1484
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:54,200
So, yeah, so they've they've upped it a little bit because I do think

1485
01:11:54,200 --> 01:11:56,000
and I've said this probably a million times at this point.

1486
01:11:56,200 --> 01:12:01,680
Guardians up the game on the actual ride itself on these towers

1487
01:12:01,880 --> 01:12:06,000
because there's so much going on and to watch and listen to that.

1488
01:12:06,200 --> 01:12:08,400
Now all the other ones feel a little empty

1489
01:12:08,600 --> 01:12:13,000
because it's not like even kind of felt that way on Tower of Terror in Florida.

1490
01:12:13,160 --> 01:12:16,840
That's why I went to see Aerosmith instead of going on tower again.

1491
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:18,880
To see Aerosmith.

1492
01:12:19,080 --> 01:12:20,080
Phrasing.

1493
01:12:20,280 --> 01:12:21,560
Yeah, I went to see Aerosmith.

1494
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:25,960
I went to the concert and see Aaron life from boys from Boston.

1495
01:12:26,160 --> 01:12:28,080
I took a super stretch limo.

1496
01:12:28,280 --> 01:12:30,880
Eliana Douglas.

1497
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:32,800
I went to see Eliana.

1498
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:34,320
I saw Eliana.

1499
01:12:34,520 --> 01:12:36,400
David Wayne.

1500
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:38,080
David Wayne.

1501
01:12:38,280 --> 01:12:41,040
You fucked it up.

1502
01:12:41,200 --> 01:12:45,240
Jason and Lindsay went to Tower of Terror and I split off to go see Aerosmith.

1503
01:12:45,240 --> 01:12:48,440
And that's why because I because we go on it and everything leading up to it's great.

1504
01:12:48,440 --> 01:12:49,480
And the drop is great, too.

1505
01:12:49,480 --> 01:12:51,600
It's just that I could have one more treat.

1506
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:54,240
A party you don't even I'd like that you commit.

1507
01:12:54,440 --> 01:12:55,960
Not even the name of the ride.

1508
01:12:56,160 --> 01:12:59,800
It's I went to go see I went to go see Aerosmith.

1509
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:00,560
Yes.

1510
01:13:00,760 --> 01:13:03,160
Backstage pass backstage passes.

1511
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:04,640
Rock and roller coaster.

1512
01:13:04,840 --> 01:13:06,200
Not whatever it's called.

1513
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:09,200
It's called Rock and Roller Coaster Rock and Roller Coaster starring arrows.

1514
01:13:09,400 --> 01:13:10,720
Starring Aerosmith.

1515
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:12,360
GeForce Records.

1516
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:15,000
That would be even funnier if I said I went to GeForce Records.

1517
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:17,680
I went to the studios GeForce Records to see my friends.

1518
01:13:17,880 --> 01:13:19,400
Records headquarters around here.

1519
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:21,160
I might go to Peru.

1520
01:13:21,160 --> 01:13:23,120
Check out the gold albums and everything.

1521
01:13:23,320 --> 01:13:29,160
Yeah. My friends, Steven Tyler, the Edge and Scooter Braun.

1522
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:32,160
Funny Carlos.

1523
01:13:32,360 --> 01:13:33,200
And Ringo.

1524
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:35,680
The ride itself, though, we have skipped some.

1525
01:13:35,880 --> 01:13:36,640
Yeah, sorry.

1526
01:13:36,840 --> 01:13:40,200
There's like I mean, again, we're like

1527
01:13:40,520 --> 01:13:43,800
you know the drill with the Tower of Terror, probably where you stop at floors

1528
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:50,160
and there's these things, but that this the the whatever the event is exactly

1529
01:13:50,360 --> 01:13:52,760
happening to Hightower is fantastic.

1530
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:53,800
Yes, yes, for sure.

1531
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,680
I mean, so totally lives up to everything.

1532
01:13:56,880 --> 01:13:58,120
Yeah, I skipped ahead.

1533
01:13:58,120 --> 01:14:00,200
I meant really, truly just the thrill part.

1534
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:01,360
Still going up.

1535
01:14:01,560 --> 01:14:02,720
There's awesome visuals.

1536
01:14:02,920 --> 01:14:07,640
Yeah, because you see you then see the ghost of Hightower interacting with the

1537
01:14:07,680 --> 01:14:11,680
idol again. You see him disrespect the idol.

1538
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:15,360
The idol is kind of seems still.

1539
01:14:15,560 --> 01:14:20,640
But then after Hightower is done with and dissolves and flies off in a very

1540
01:14:20,840 --> 01:14:26,760
Twilight Zone manner, then he turns to look at you and the doors close immediately.

1541
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:27,920
Super creepy.

1542
01:14:28,120 --> 01:14:33,680
Again, when I had not quite gotten over the fear, that moment was like Jesus.

1543
01:14:33,880 --> 01:14:36,160
You were like, were you yelling for your mom?

1544
01:14:36,160 --> 01:14:37,760
Maybe. Yeah.

1545
01:14:37,960 --> 01:14:40,560
If anyone can relate, it's this lady.

1546
01:14:40,760 --> 01:14:43,960
Yeah. Well, you've let me know that it's if I did.

1547
01:14:44,160 --> 01:14:45,640
It's a safe space.

1548
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:47,520
I'm like playing up at the beginning.

1549
01:14:47,720 --> 01:14:52,680
Really, your mommy is what you imagine somebody doing that.

1550
01:14:52,880 --> 01:14:58,000
I mean, anyone any age over 10, let alone 35.

1551
01:14:58,200 --> 01:15:01,720
I, of course, have not written this, but when I watched a couple video ride

1552
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:05,760
through the first time the idol turns and looks at you, I was like, no.

1553
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:13,200
I, I, there are other people said, like in the next scene, like, you know, they, they

1554
01:15:13,400 --> 01:15:17,800
do the fact from the California Adventure, Tower of Terror, where you see yourselves

1555
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:21,240
and then this kind of wavy and ghosty, but it's that green energy.

1556
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:22,560
The idol appears again.

1557
01:15:22,760 --> 01:15:24,560
It says the idol launches at you.

1558
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:27,520
But I think to me it just looked like he kind of teleports.

1559
01:15:27,720 --> 01:15:32,080
But nothing was as scary as the idol just turning to you.

1560
01:15:32,280 --> 01:15:33,840
Yeah, absolutely.

1561
01:15:34,040 --> 01:15:40,240
Well, another this the the idol turning and looking at you just makes me think like.

1562
01:15:40,440 --> 01:15:45,320
So another fun and idiotic fact about me is that I refuse to look in the eyes of

1563
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:47,680
Mara when I go on Indiana Jones.

1564
01:15:47,880 --> 01:15:49,080
I will not do it.

1565
01:15:49,280 --> 01:15:52,840
I have some kind of superstition about her

1566
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:55,320
snatching my money and luck away.

1567
01:15:55,520 --> 01:15:56,640
I won't do it.

1568
01:15:56,840 --> 01:16:01,960
Right. And you were where you did you look at the what's the character in the Tokyo

1569
01:16:01,960 --> 01:16:06,520
version because Mara is not in the Tokyo, Indiana Jones, whatever it was.

1570
01:16:06,520 --> 01:16:07,920
I wouldn't absolutely never.

1571
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:09,680
Oh, it's that smallest crystal skull.

1572
01:16:09,880 --> 01:16:10,960
Right. Yeah.

1573
01:16:11,160 --> 01:16:12,000
No, you didn't.

1574
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:12,800
Yeah.

1575
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:14,600
Do I not want to succeed in life?

1576
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:16,680
No, I want to succeed in life.

1577
01:16:16,680 --> 01:16:17,240
Oh, you know what?

1578
01:16:17,440 --> 01:16:19,840
We went in single rider on those every time.

1579
01:16:20,040 --> 01:16:23,240
So I didn't notice if you were looking at the crystal skull or not.

1580
01:16:23,440 --> 01:16:28,080
Will you look a bottle of Dan Aykroyd's crystal skull vodka in the eyes?

1581
01:16:28,240 --> 01:16:31,800
As long as it promises not to curse me.

1582
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:32,840
All right. I don't know.

1583
01:16:32,840 --> 01:16:34,960
Does it? I don't think it promises anything.

1584
01:16:35,160 --> 01:16:37,400
Premium vodka experience.

1585
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:38,360
Premium vodka.

1586
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:39,960
Promise is a smooth taste.

1587
01:16:40,160 --> 01:16:43,400
Smooth. Don't mix it with anything.

1588
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:44,920
Premium spirit.

1589
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:48,920
I would like a celebrity liquor where they're a little more upfront, where it's

1590
01:16:49,120 --> 01:16:53,720
like this is dog shit and you're going to have to mix it with juice, with on it,

1591
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:56,880
with something like this is reasonably priced.

1592
01:16:56,880 --> 01:16:58,640
This is a mixing alcohol.

1593
01:16:58,840 --> 01:17:00,960
It's for high balls at minimum.

1594
01:17:01,160 --> 01:17:02,520
Well, maybe that's what ours is.

1595
01:17:02,720 --> 01:17:03,800
That's the one we're going to do.

1596
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,680
Oh, we'll be honest about it.

1597
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:08,160
It's a cash grab.

1598
01:17:08,360 --> 01:17:10,920
This is like drinking hairspray.

1599
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:12,000
A bunch of OJ.

1600
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:15,800
This is like you remember Skoll vodka from high school.

1601
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,040
This is just as good as that cheap thing.

1602
01:17:18,240 --> 01:17:21,720
You got it like you got a guy by you.

1603
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:23,880
That's the brand Midwest.

1604
01:17:24,080 --> 01:17:26,680
People would know maybe Skoll vodka.

1605
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:29,480
But what's the name of our tequila?

1606
01:17:29,680 --> 01:17:31,760
Buenos ninos.

1607
01:17:31,960 --> 01:17:32,480
Thank you.

1608
01:17:32,680 --> 01:17:33,880
So it's going to be shit.

1609
01:17:34,080 --> 01:17:35,520
It's going to be awful.

1610
01:17:35,720 --> 01:17:37,040
But hey, we're honest.

1611
01:17:37,240 --> 01:17:38,280
But we're honest about it.

1612
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:39,680
So we know ninos.

1613
01:17:39,880 --> 01:17:40,920
We don't lie to you.

1614
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:42,240
Buenos.

1615
01:17:42,440 --> 01:17:43,280
Buenos.

1616
01:17:43,480 --> 01:17:44,280
Yeah.

1617
01:17:44,480 --> 01:17:45,680
We'll learn it.

1618
01:17:45,880 --> 01:17:49,520
It's called agreement.

1619
01:17:49,720 --> 01:17:51,600
Of course.

1620
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:56,440
I have the voice of the idol here also.

1621
01:17:56,520 --> 01:17:58,760
Oh, I forgot to mention it's the same voice.

1622
01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:04,920
It's Richard Stephen Horvitz, the voice actor of Invader Zim's Jim.

1623
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:07,600
So that means something to people who watch that show.

1624
01:18:07,800 --> 01:18:08,480
Hmm.

1625
01:18:08,680 --> 01:18:10,360
Congratulations to you then.

1626
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:11,880
Very popular cult show.

1627
01:18:12,080 --> 01:18:13,400
Yeah. I used to watch it a lot.

1628
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:13,920
Oh, you did.

1629
01:18:14,120 --> 01:18:14,400
Yeah.

1630
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:14,920
Yeah.

1631
01:18:15,120 --> 01:18:16,240
I used to watch it.

1632
01:18:16,440 --> 01:18:18,080
Nickelodeon really jerked it around.

1633
01:18:18,280 --> 01:18:20,520
Like it moved it around on the schedule a lot.

1634
01:18:20,720 --> 01:18:24,840
And then it I think picked up a cult following from like Joe and Vasquez.

1635
01:18:25,040 --> 01:18:25,560
Yeah.

1636
01:18:25,680 --> 01:18:27,800
Well, I got to check it out then.

1637
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:28,800
So, yeah.

1638
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:33,840
So then you get to that standard drop profile.

1639
01:18:34,040 --> 01:18:38,160
It feels like it should be now with all this build up to be 30 minutes.

1640
01:18:38,360 --> 01:18:44,440
That's part of the problem is the buildup is so amazing that I think just subconsciously

1641
01:18:44,640 --> 01:18:46,320
I didn't even really realize it.

1642
01:18:46,520 --> 01:18:52,520
I was expecting the ride itself to be really better, too.

1643
01:18:52,720 --> 01:18:54,320
It should be like pirates.

1644
01:18:54,480 --> 01:19:00,000
Should be a 15 minute ride now through like hell, through hell,

1645
01:19:00,200 --> 01:19:01,240
through hell itself.

1646
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:02,040
Question mark.

1647
01:19:02,240 --> 01:19:02,600
Yeah.

1648
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:10,480
Where the vehicle gets shot up out of the roof and then caught by another encasing

1649
01:19:10,680 --> 01:19:15,480
right, takes you down to the ground, into another thing and it returns you to the

1650
01:19:15,680 --> 01:19:20,680
shaft. A Disney sea airship sucks the vehicle up.

1651
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:23,680
They can turn clouds into ride vehicles now.

1652
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:27,880
And then you ride a cloud to a different park that you didn't know existed.

1653
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:28,360
Right.

1654
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:32,400
All of a sudden you're at the top of the Tokyo Tower in Tokyo itself.

1655
01:19:32,600 --> 01:19:33,200
Yes.

1656
01:19:33,400 --> 01:19:40,520
Which we explored where you're a VIP, where it's VIP, not very important person.

1657
01:19:40,720 --> 01:19:44,720
Very impressive panorama.

1658
01:19:44,920 --> 01:19:49,320
Yes, that's from that's from our there's a there's a thing that looks like the Eiffel

1659
01:19:49,320 --> 01:19:54,640
Tower, but orange, but it's like orange in Tokyo called the Tokyo Tower that we

1660
01:19:54,840 --> 01:19:59,600
found because we had to go to the doctor and we the doctor, the doctor that was

1661
01:19:59,800 --> 01:20:06,000
covered under whatever weird phone number we called to get meds was over by the thing.

1662
01:20:06,200 --> 01:20:06,920
What is this?

1663
01:20:07,120 --> 01:20:09,080
Looks like the looks like the Eiffel Tower.

1664
01:20:09,280 --> 01:20:09,560
Yeah.

1665
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:10,760
So it's a big tourist trap.

1666
01:20:10,760 --> 01:20:12,840
And there was like a little pirates dinner theater.

1667
01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:15,440
I know we needed we needed to go to that.

1668
01:20:15,440 --> 01:20:16,720
But I forget why we didn't.

1669
01:20:16,920 --> 01:20:19,120
I think we I think we're trying to get to something else.

1670
01:20:19,320 --> 01:20:20,320
But then it closed.

1671
01:20:20,520 --> 01:20:22,080
We shot ourselves in the foot.

1672
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:22,360
Yeah.

1673
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:26,960
Because it's like, oh, we got to get to this one place and try the pancakes or I

1674
01:20:27,160 --> 01:20:31,920
feel like we made a lot of decisions in Tokyo like that, where we're like, there's

1675
01:20:32,120 --> 01:20:34,560
this very cool thing right here and now.

1676
01:20:34,760 --> 01:20:38,480
But because we had already talked about doing this other thing, I guess we should

1677
01:20:38,480 --> 01:20:39,840
go do the other thing we talked about.

1678
01:20:40,040 --> 01:20:42,560
And then we'd get to the other thing we talked about and it was closed.

1679
01:20:42,760 --> 01:20:46,600
You miss the 45 minute window when Jiro makes sushi.

1680
01:20:46,760 --> 01:20:49,280
Yes, 45 minutes a day.

1681
01:20:49,480 --> 01:20:51,040
Should we go to this pirate thing?

1682
01:20:51,240 --> 01:20:52,720
Yes, we screwed up a lot.

1683
01:20:52,920 --> 01:20:56,680
But yeah, anyway, so the ride happens.

1684
01:20:56,880 --> 01:20:58,120
We did the ride twice.

1685
01:20:58,320 --> 01:20:59,680
We did tower, I believe twice.

1686
01:20:59,880 --> 01:21:02,800
We did one fast pass, I think, and one full queue.

1687
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:04,520
OK,

1688
01:21:05,040 --> 01:21:06,800
which you got to do the full queue.

1689
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:08,040
You do got to.

1690
01:21:08,240 --> 01:21:13,240
And it's sometimes it is long because a lot of these like the park is so popular

1691
01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:15,280
and the big rides have pretty long lines.

1692
01:21:15,280 --> 01:21:15,960
I know that goes crazy.

1693
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:17,400
Maybe was 50 minutes.

1694
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:20,840
You guys like I said, I wanted it to be longer so that I could look at stuff more.

1695
01:21:21,040 --> 01:21:22,040
Sure. You keep saying that.

1696
01:21:22,240 --> 01:21:25,520
I I this is one where I yeah, it's cool.

1697
01:21:25,720 --> 01:21:26,400
I still don't.

1698
01:21:26,600 --> 01:21:30,640
I did a fast pass every time and I'm glad I did because you get on the right.

1699
01:21:30,840 --> 01:21:32,480
I'll look at a video later.

1700
01:21:32,680 --> 01:21:37,800
Just talked about the fact that the ride itself is just fine.

1701
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:39,840
And exactly what we have here.

1702
01:21:40,040 --> 01:21:41,280
The pre show is great.

1703
01:21:41,480 --> 01:21:42,400
The pre show is great.

1704
01:21:42,600 --> 01:21:45,640
No matter how good a line is, there's nothing where I'm like,

1705
01:21:45,640 --> 01:21:51,240
I'm going to choose to go through the line that one that doesn't go read to me.

1706
01:21:51,440 --> 01:21:52,400
Maybe I don't know.

1707
01:21:52,600 --> 01:21:56,560
Maybe one time is limited on vacation.

1708
01:21:56,760 --> 01:21:58,600
Well, I just think if you're there,

1709
01:21:58,800 --> 01:22:02,040
you should do it once so that you know what the line is.

1710
01:22:02,240 --> 01:22:03,920
That makes you miss all those murals.

1711
01:22:04,120 --> 01:22:05,680
Right. And the statues.

1712
01:22:05,880 --> 01:22:09,880
But then I probably did like other good stuff in the park because there's so much.

1713
01:22:10,080 --> 01:22:10,800
Well, we were there.

1714
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:11,960
We did. We did.

1715
01:22:12,160 --> 01:22:13,120
We did. How many days?

1716
01:22:13,320 --> 01:22:14,240
How many days?

1717
01:22:14,560 --> 01:22:15,960
I think we did four days.

1718
01:22:16,160 --> 01:22:18,640
We did closer to what Tony Baxter said we should do.

1719
01:22:18,840 --> 01:22:20,440
I think I followed Tony's word.

1720
01:22:20,640 --> 01:22:22,680
In the end, same as Tony.

1721
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:25,880
In the end, yeah, we followed his rules.

1722
01:22:26,080 --> 01:22:28,200
So, Jason, you got to go.

1723
01:22:28,400 --> 01:22:30,760
Yeah. Yeah, no, I know.

1724
01:22:30,960 --> 01:22:31,840
We got to go back.

1725
01:22:32,040 --> 01:22:33,840
Why haven't you gone?

1726
01:22:34,040 --> 01:22:36,560
Yeah, why haven't I gone?

1727
01:22:36,760 --> 01:22:39,400
International travel.

1728
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:40,040
Yeah.

1729
01:22:40,240 --> 01:22:42,400
Well, you know, now we've been very normal.

1730
01:22:42,440 --> 01:22:45,760
With Lindsay, we've been dipping into these Tokyo tracks.

1731
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:47,000
I feel like we wanted to save them.

1732
01:22:47,200 --> 01:22:49,080
But now it's like, look, we're hey, hey, it's on.

1733
01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:51,040
I'm listening anyway.

1734
01:22:51,240 --> 01:22:55,280
It's it's just yeah, you know, it is what it is.

1735
01:22:55,480 --> 01:22:58,360
I'm going to I will go through the full line.

1736
01:22:58,560 --> 01:23:00,040
I will for sure go through the full line.

1737
01:23:00,240 --> 01:23:04,840
I go through the full line on Men in Black Alien Attack to do the fake,

1738
01:23:05,040 --> 01:23:10,640
fake out like Universe and You World's Bear tag, which I think is terrific.

1739
01:23:10,640 --> 01:23:13,760
But the Universal Express line bypasses goes right past it.

1740
01:23:13,960 --> 01:23:14,440
Yeah.

1741
01:23:14,640 --> 01:23:16,840
No, there's some full life full cues you got to do.

1742
01:23:16,840 --> 01:23:18,680
I think this is one of the I'm curious.

1743
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:20,640
The full listener opinion on this.

1744
01:23:20,840 --> 01:23:28,560
Do you like often not do a chance to cut the line in order to do the full?

1745
01:23:28,760 --> 01:23:30,560
Now there's a limit follow up.

1746
01:23:30,760 --> 01:23:31,640
It depends.

1747
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:34,800
Do you at least do the cue once?

1748
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:35,560
Right.

1749
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:37,480
But that didn't even occur to me then.

1750
01:23:37,680 --> 01:23:39,920
Like I better we better do the cue.

1751
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:41,640
That did not occur to me one bit.

1752
01:23:41,840 --> 01:23:43,400
Of course, it all looks cool.

1753
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:47,160
That never, ever struck me like I better see the detail.

1754
01:23:47,160 --> 01:23:48,560
I better see the busty statue.

1755
01:23:48,760 --> 01:23:51,880
There wouldn't be the busty statue.

1756
01:23:52,080 --> 01:23:53,400
There wouldn't be any.

1757
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:56,600
But also, even though we've been talking about how great this ride is for two

1758
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:59,120
hours, still I have zero regrets about this.

1759
01:23:59,320 --> 01:24:00,000
Really?

1760
01:24:00,200 --> 01:24:01,160
Is there one?

1761
01:24:01,360 --> 01:24:03,360
The garden, the statues.

1762
01:24:03,560 --> 01:24:04,160
Is there one?

1763
01:24:04,360 --> 01:24:06,520
You really do not know what you're missing.

1764
01:24:06,720 --> 01:24:07,920
Is there one cue, though?

1765
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:11,400
I don't know that you've been through that you would say somebody like you

1766
01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:16,080
got to go through it once at least or no, you would skip every like let's

1767
01:24:16,080 --> 01:24:17,320
hypothetical talk about this.

1768
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:17,880
Yes, yes, yes.

1769
01:24:18,080 --> 01:24:18,520
OK, OK.

1770
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:21,640
Say you truly skip all the cues.

1771
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:24,520
I mean, literally you show up at that pre-show moment.

1772
01:24:24,520 --> 01:24:25,880
So like say it's Indiana Jones.

1773
01:24:26,080 --> 01:24:27,880
You're in the room with the newsreel.

1774
01:24:28,080 --> 01:24:29,560
You skip that whole line.

1775
01:24:29,760 --> 01:24:30,720
It's the Guardians.

1776
01:24:30,720 --> 01:24:31,880
You're in the room with Rocket.

1777
01:24:32,080 --> 01:24:32,920
You skip that line.

1778
01:24:33,120 --> 01:24:36,240
So like you're saying if I if there's somebody who'd never been to the park.

1779
01:24:36,240 --> 01:24:36,840
Exactly.

1780
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:39,120
And there was the ability to do this.

1781
01:24:39,320 --> 01:24:41,960
Would you would you was a one ride?

1782
01:24:42,160 --> 01:24:46,040
You would say you have to do the full cue because it's really so cool.

1783
01:24:46,240 --> 01:24:46,880
No, walk there.

1784
01:24:47,080 --> 01:24:47,600
Really?

1785
01:24:47,800 --> 01:24:50,320
You skip every line that fucking rules.

1786
01:24:50,520 --> 01:24:50,800
Really?

1787
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,920
Not even the full Indiana Jones cave.

1788
01:24:54,120 --> 01:24:55,160
The theatrical experience.

1789
01:24:55,360 --> 01:24:56,000
Some of them.

1790
01:24:56,200 --> 01:24:58,360
This like builds up the like, wow.

1791
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:03,800
But I'm with a person who has I guess we're like with a guy or something.

1792
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:05,640
Never, never.

1793
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:06,320
Yeah.

1794
01:25:06,480 --> 01:25:08,480
I'm not saying I'm saying like Indiana Jones.

1795
01:25:08,680 --> 01:25:08,880
All right.

1796
01:25:09,080 --> 01:25:12,920
It's going to be an extra 30 minutes, but you have to walk through the long Indiana

1797
01:25:12,920 --> 01:25:17,800
Jones queue before you get to that newsreel line and the things on the ground.

1798
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:19,600
And depends on who I'm with.

1799
01:25:19,800 --> 01:25:24,000
Well, you know, the person seems interested in it.

1800
01:25:24,200 --> 01:25:24,840
I don't know.

1801
01:25:25,040 --> 01:25:27,240
I like all this, but I like I don't know.

1802
01:25:27,440 --> 01:25:28,720
I still like skipping a line.

1803
01:25:28,920 --> 01:25:34,400
I want to know what this hypothetical person you're with has better to do.

1804
01:25:34,600 --> 01:25:36,040
Jason's mad at that person.

1805
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:38,000
I'm mad.

1806
01:25:38,200 --> 01:25:39,240
I'm furious.

1807
01:25:39,440 --> 01:25:41,920
I do think this is a controversial opinion.

1808
01:25:42,120 --> 01:25:43,360
I think it's controversial.

1809
01:25:43,560 --> 01:25:45,960
Every line in a part, you don't do it.

1810
01:25:46,160 --> 01:25:47,720
But we're talking.

1811
01:25:47,920 --> 01:25:50,920
You're not even really walk fast through.

1812
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:53,560
Literally never walk fast through.

1813
01:25:53,760 --> 01:25:54,680
Well, this is a man.

1814
01:25:54,880 --> 01:25:57,320
Well, I'm just saying sometimes it's like, for instance,

1815
01:25:57,320 --> 01:26:00,440
Guardians, when you do fast pass, you don't get to walk around and see all things.

1816
01:26:00,440 --> 01:26:03,760
But you do get a brief glimpse of everything because they just kind of I'm

1817
01:26:03,760 --> 01:26:07,920
just saying in this hypothetical scenario, you're literally just like it's like

1818
01:26:08,120 --> 01:26:10,000
you're appearing in that pre show room.

1819
01:26:10,200 --> 01:26:11,080
You can imagine.

1820
01:26:11,280 --> 01:26:12,560
Let me give this to you.

1821
01:26:12,760 --> 01:26:17,960
OK, I'm in this hypothetical scenario and I am the person saying, no, we're not

1822
01:26:18,160 --> 01:26:21,160
skipping this one. I think I get kicked out of the group.

1823
01:26:21,360 --> 01:26:23,160
Huh? But but wouldn't.

1824
01:26:23,360 --> 01:26:24,600
Who would?

1825
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:28,240
Can you imagine being on the other side of that and like, sorry, what?

1826
01:26:28,440 --> 01:26:30,040
We're not going to skip the line.

1827
01:26:30,240 --> 01:26:33,680
But more recent rise like rise of the resistance.

1828
01:26:33,880 --> 01:26:34,880
That doesn't count.

1829
01:26:34,880 --> 01:26:35,720
That's a whole other.

1830
01:26:35,920 --> 01:26:37,120
That doesn't count.

1831
01:26:37,320 --> 01:26:43,680
OK, no, because a lot of line is the you know, you're getting the pre show before

1832
01:26:43,680 --> 01:26:45,240
you then get to the more line.

1833
01:26:45,440 --> 01:26:47,680
You would tend back thing is different.

1834
01:26:47,880 --> 01:26:48,400
Yes.

1835
01:26:48,600 --> 01:26:52,160
But I feel like, for instance, Pirates, the queue fine.

1836
01:26:52,360 --> 01:26:53,680
Obviously, skip that.

1837
01:26:53,880 --> 01:26:54,520
There's nothing.

1838
01:26:54,720 --> 01:26:58,480
Skip the smugglers run like Haunted Mansion.

1839
01:26:58,680 --> 01:27:01,240
You wouldn't say go in the Haunted Mansion queue.

1840
01:27:01,440 --> 01:27:03,040
There's a cool effect in there.

1841
01:27:03,080 --> 01:27:05,920
I would say go to the elevator.

1842
01:27:06,120 --> 01:27:07,800
OK, I guess that is my show.

1843
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:08,480
Yeah.

1844
01:27:08,680 --> 01:27:10,240
Yeah. Haunted Mansion queue.

1845
01:27:10,440 --> 01:27:12,240
You're not really missing anything.

1846
01:27:12,440 --> 01:27:13,240
Pirates queue.

1847
01:27:13,440 --> 01:27:15,480
You're obviously not missing anything.

1848
01:27:15,680 --> 01:27:16,680
Smugglers run.

1849
01:27:16,880 --> 01:27:18,000
Skip it.

1850
01:27:18,200 --> 01:27:21,560
I think Indiana Jones queue, though, is worth walking through.

1851
01:27:21,760 --> 01:27:23,800
I think, yeah, Indiana Jones.

1852
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:25,360
I think you have to see it.

1853
01:27:25,560 --> 01:27:27,760
We're talking once in your life.

1854
01:27:27,960 --> 01:27:33,000
One time, don't skip the line half an hour out of your whole goddamn life.

1855
01:27:33,200 --> 01:27:39,120
You stupid piece of shit imaginary person that Scott is, for some reason,

1856
01:27:39,320 --> 01:27:40,960
friends with.

1857
01:27:41,160 --> 01:27:41,680
I don't.

1858
01:27:41,880 --> 01:27:42,880
None of us know why.

1859
01:27:43,080 --> 01:27:44,280
This guy sucks.

1860
01:27:44,480 --> 01:27:46,280
High old Hightower.

1861
01:27:46,480 --> 01:27:48,440
Scott, I don't know how you put up with them.

1862
01:27:48,640 --> 01:27:51,920
One time spent 20 extra fucking minutes.

1863
01:27:52,120 --> 01:27:52,560
I hate him.

1864
01:27:52,760 --> 01:27:54,440
You think I like hanging out with this guy?

1865
01:27:54,640 --> 01:27:55,720
He's awful to me.

1866
01:27:55,920 --> 01:27:56,600
He's the worst.

1867
01:27:56,800 --> 01:27:57,800
He slaps me around.

1868
01:27:58,000 --> 01:27:59,280
He physically mistreats me.

1869
01:27:59,480 --> 01:28:00,960
He won't let me make insane the queue.

1870
01:28:01,080 --> 01:28:03,080
He's not going to Disneyland.

1871
01:28:03,280 --> 01:28:05,880
He's who I'm choosing.

1872
01:28:06,880 --> 01:28:09,000
Millennium Falcon.

1873
01:28:09,200 --> 01:28:10,800
You have to go to the queue there.

1874
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,280
You mean the smugglers?

1875
01:28:13,480 --> 01:28:16,200
OK, the pre-show would cut.

1876
01:28:16,400 --> 01:28:18,240
Yeah, it's all boring.

1877
01:28:18,440 --> 01:28:19,240
That's me.

1878
01:28:19,440 --> 01:28:20,680
I would just go to Hondo.

1879
01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:22,200
There's not enough.

1880
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:23,600
There aren't enough.

1881
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:24,240
All right, fine.

1882
01:28:24,240 --> 01:28:24,960
That one. Yes.

1883
01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:25,760
No, you're right. You're right.

1884
01:28:25,760 --> 01:28:27,000
That one is a skip.

1885
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:27,960
That one is a skip.

1886
01:28:27,960 --> 01:28:28,640
I agree with that.

1887
01:28:28,640 --> 01:28:29,200
I agree with that.

1888
01:28:29,240 --> 01:28:31,760
I would insist I might insist that we go

1889
01:28:31,960 --> 01:28:34,160
through the full Guardians to see like Cosmo.

1890
01:28:34,360 --> 01:28:35,800
I think you have to do that one.

1891
01:28:35,800 --> 01:28:37,080
Yeah, I like Cosmo.

1892
01:28:37,280 --> 01:28:38,680
Outside queue, there's nothing.

1893
01:28:38,680 --> 01:28:39,920
Who cares about the sound?

1894
01:28:40,120 --> 01:28:41,880
OK, OK, that's fair.

1895
01:28:42,080 --> 01:28:43,920
Soren, you're not missing anything.

1896
01:28:44,120 --> 01:28:45,640
Soren, you're not missing anything.

1897
01:28:45,840 --> 01:28:48,160
Some of these lines I enjoy being in.

1898
01:28:48,360 --> 01:28:49,560
I'm not saying I don't.

1899
01:28:49,760 --> 01:28:52,080
I think there's a handful queue.

1900
01:28:52,160 --> 01:28:56,680
But I'm saying you're saying this person can literally live and die

1901
01:28:56,720 --> 01:28:59,080
never seeing the Indiana Jones.

1902
01:28:59,280 --> 01:29:01,160
That's what we're talking about their whole life.

1903
01:29:01,360 --> 01:29:07,040
I want you to be born and leave this earth not having seen the Indiana Jones.

1904
01:29:07,240 --> 01:29:08,840
Not even seeing a rope and a spike.

1905
01:29:09,040 --> 01:29:09,920
A rope and a spike.

1906
01:29:10,120 --> 01:29:11,040
They're probably fine.

1907
01:29:11,240 --> 01:29:12,600
Wow, I hate this man.

1908
01:29:12,800 --> 01:29:14,600
I do not wish to know him.

1909
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:16,320
I think there's a handful.

1910
01:29:16,520 --> 01:29:17,360
How do you picture it?

1911
01:29:17,560 --> 01:29:20,560
Does anyone see him in a does he look like Hightower?

1912
01:29:20,760 --> 01:29:21,600
Well, we talked about.

1913
01:29:21,800 --> 01:29:24,640
He looks like you in a mustache.

1914
01:29:27,240 --> 01:29:29,520
He's just it's like fight is a fight club.

1915
01:29:29,720 --> 01:29:30,440
It's fight club.

1916
01:29:30,640 --> 01:29:34,440
It's got to talking about his like Tyler Durden.

1917
01:29:34,920 --> 01:29:40,040
And this Tyler Durden doesn't even care about the fake out men in black line.

1918
01:29:40,240 --> 01:29:41,480
Wow.

1919
01:29:41,680 --> 01:29:46,880
Maybe you can learn a little something from them because he is.

1920
01:29:47,080 --> 01:29:49,400
This is going to be this is going to open up a can of worms.

1921
01:29:49,600 --> 01:29:53,440
I think I think we're I think we've started a new in a brand new.

1922
01:29:53,640 --> 01:29:55,800
Yeah, it is a controversial opinion.

1923
01:29:55,920 --> 01:29:59,240
It is if you had the ability to skip every line, you would do it for.

1924
01:29:59,440 --> 01:30:01,400
I think it is crazy.

1925
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:04,640
I think it is for this part for this podcast.

1926
01:30:04,840 --> 01:30:05,880
You're a villain.

1927
01:30:06,080 --> 01:30:07,320
You're a villain.

1928
01:30:07,520 --> 01:30:08,360
I'm not him.

1929
01:30:08,560 --> 01:30:09,280
I wink.

1930
01:30:09,480 --> 01:30:11,680
You're choosing for this person.

1931
01:30:11,880 --> 01:30:12,920
Oh, you're the villain.

1932
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:15,880
You've been choosing for this for this whole time.

1933
01:30:16,080 --> 01:30:18,480
And I can't afford to lie on it.

1934
01:30:18,680 --> 01:30:23,160
You're making them say like, let's go on the lines before you pour the base on it.

1935
01:30:23,240 --> 01:30:28,360
Back to that first time you fought this friend, Scott, was it really just you the

1936
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:34,760
whole time alone flashing to every memory of my last last six years?

1937
01:30:34,960 --> 01:30:35,760
This is interesting.

1938
01:30:35,960 --> 01:30:36,880
Friends with this person.

1939
01:30:37,080 --> 01:30:42,240
I think we I think we can make a list of unskippable cues for the first.

1940
01:30:42,240 --> 01:30:43,320
Like, have you never been on it?

1941
01:30:43,520 --> 01:30:44,120
Yes, yes.

1942
01:30:44,320 --> 01:30:48,680
Anyone come to I think middle ground here, but I'm interested to see what the reaction

1943
01:30:48,680 --> 01:30:49,440
is on the listener.

1944
01:30:49,640 --> 01:30:50,560
I know what it's going to.

1945
01:30:50,760 --> 01:30:52,440
I know what it is.

1946
01:30:52,680 --> 01:30:56,320
I've been in this goddamn rodeo before.

1947
01:30:58,320 --> 01:31:01,720
But there's the one you know what I think I think is the person listening who agrees

1948
01:31:01,920 --> 01:31:04,200
with me, who is not doesn't comment anywhere.

1949
01:31:04,200 --> 01:31:05,800
Oh, do you think they've been shamed?

1950
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:06,680
They're worried.

1951
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:07,960
I don't wish to know.

1952
01:31:08,160 --> 01:31:09,840
Well, let's make a secret email address.

1953
01:31:10,040 --> 01:31:11,880
Make yourself known and I'll fucking cancel you.

1954
01:31:12,080 --> 01:31:13,560
I'm going to cancel you so fast.

1955
01:31:13,760 --> 01:31:14,880
How about Scott?

1956
01:31:15,080 --> 01:31:19,680
Because I have Scott is pan at Gmail, which I've gotten a couple photos of Scott

1957
01:31:19,680 --> 01:31:21,560
is pan that still have to be revealed eventually.

1958
01:31:21,760 --> 01:31:23,680
But maybe Scott is right at Gmail.

1959
01:31:23,880 --> 01:31:25,440
You can control it if you want.

1960
01:31:25,640 --> 01:31:29,240
And a massive seems like it must be somebody it's probably taken.

1961
01:31:29,440 --> 01:31:31,120
Scott is right.

1962
01:31:31,320 --> 01:31:33,080
Sixty nine

1963
01:31:34,800 --> 01:31:36,760
at Gmail dot com.

1964
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:40,280
Just got to make that number came up this episode.

1965
01:31:40,480 --> 01:31:41,680
So I'll make the G.

1966
01:31:41,880 --> 01:31:45,880
And then if you if you are a Scott supporter and you're worried because like

1967
01:31:46,080 --> 01:31:47,400
the bullies in our audience.

1968
01:31:47,600 --> 01:31:49,600
Oh, I'm not saying that they're in hiding.

1969
01:31:49,720 --> 01:31:53,440
I'm saying they don't even they just listen, agree with me and don't start

1970
01:31:53,440 --> 01:31:54,280
typing about it.

1971
01:31:54,480 --> 01:31:55,720
Well, make yourself known.

1972
01:31:55,920 --> 01:31:57,240
Make yourself known.

1973
01:31:57,440 --> 01:31:58,160
Make yourself.

1974
01:31:58,360 --> 01:32:04,000
I wouldn't say that, but I'll say I am so much more aggressive than any of you three.

1975
01:32:04,200 --> 01:32:04,960
That is true.

1976
01:32:05,160 --> 01:32:07,760
Person could always return at any time.

1977
01:32:07,960 --> 01:32:09,120
They're feeling a regret.

1978
01:32:09,320 --> 01:32:10,920
That's what we're saying, Scott.

1979
01:32:11,120 --> 01:32:12,200
Why can't they go?

1980
01:32:12,400 --> 01:32:13,120
Are they going to die?

1981
01:32:13,320 --> 01:32:15,840
The question is, no, you've been putting that on them.

1982
01:32:15,880 --> 01:32:19,760
That was the question is, are you saying they should walk this earth?

1983
01:32:19,960 --> 01:32:22,800
Never seeing that queue.

1984
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:24,480
But why do I have that power?

1985
01:32:24,680 --> 01:32:26,360
Do I control his death as well?

1986
01:32:26,560 --> 01:32:29,880
Because we the gods imbued you with that power.

1987
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:34,560
I think there's certainly extenuating circumstances where it's like, oh,

1988
01:32:34,560 --> 01:32:39,080
if it's a short amount, you got half a day there or you're you're it's a couple

1989
01:32:39,280 --> 01:32:42,680
day trip. If you have some sort of parameters on the trip.

1990
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:43,760
Sure. Yeah.

1991
01:32:43,920 --> 01:32:46,800
So you and you have the teleport technology.

1992
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:48,960
Of course, use the teleport technology.

1993
01:32:49,160 --> 01:32:54,640
If we're talking a queue that you there are there's a list of queues where you

1994
01:32:54,840 --> 01:32:58,840
have to see them at least once you can't skip it forever.

1995
01:32:59,040 --> 01:33:01,160
I think Indiana Jones is on that list.

1996
01:33:01,360 --> 01:33:02,480
Yes. Yes.

1997
01:33:02,680 --> 01:33:04,840
Really number one on that list.

1998
01:33:05,040 --> 01:33:07,480
But I also think you could ignore the list.

1999
01:33:07,680 --> 01:33:09,680
Wow. That's that's the difference.

2000
01:33:09,880 --> 01:33:11,000
That's the difference.

2001
01:33:11,200 --> 01:33:12,200
There is the list. We agree.

2002
01:33:12,200 --> 01:33:13,200
It's not all queues.

2003
01:33:13,400 --> 01:33:14,000
There's a list.

2004
01:33:14,200 --> 01:33:16,800
Scott says at the end of the day, he still thinks they're all.

2005
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:18,280
Yeah. He says, fuck the list.

2006
01:33:18,480 --> 01:33:21,320
Like you'll help us put it together, but you have no problem ignoring.

2007
01:33:21,520 --> 01:33:23,240
I still have opinions on the list.

2008
01:33:23,440 --> 01:33:24,440
Right.

2009
01:33:26,800 --> 01:33:28,360
I still want to be involved in the list.

2010
01:33:28,560 --> 01:33:29,800
I was hoping I was.

2011
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:31,480
Pirates is out.

2012
01:33:31,680 --> 01:33:33,280
It doesn't count.

2013
01:33:33,480 --> 01:33:35,240
I was hoping.

2014
01:33:35,440 --> 01:33:37,280
Boy, I know we end up in an argument.

2015
01:33:37,280 --> 01:33:38,360
I know we can't argument.

2016
01:33:38,560 --> 01:33:39,560
I didn't think so either.

2017
01:33:39,760 --> 01:33:42,120
I bring it is your it's your fault.

2018
01:33:42,320 --> 01:33:43,280
I'm a little combative.

2019
01:33:43,480 --> 01:33:44,960
I'm very I'm reactive.

2020
01:33:45,160 --> 01:33:46,320
I swear more.

2021
01:33:46,520 --> 01:33:47,040
That's true.

2022
01:33:47,240 --> 01:33:49,400
Team Creeps, which you have now all been on.

2023
01:33:49,600 --> 01:33:51,240
Much more body of podcast.

2024
01:33:51,440 --> 01:33:55,560
And congratulations on getting Scott and Mike to each read a book.

2025
01:33:55,760 --> 01:33:57,240
Thank you so much.

2026
01:33:57,440 --> 01:33:59,120
Thank you.

2027
01:33:59,320 --> 01:34:00,800
It only took.

2028
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,040
Snooty snooters.

2029
01:34:03,240 --> 01:34:04,440
Oh, smelting it.

2030
01:34:04,640 --> 01:34:06,040
I was on. I read three.

2031
01:34:06,240 --> 01:34:08,480
I was going to say more than they asked me to.

2032
01:34:08,680 --> 01:34:11,240
Jason covered an entire trilogy with us

2033
01:34:11,280 --> 01:34:13,640
and a very big trilogy in the world.

2034
01:34:13,840 --> 01:34:15,040
It was Fear Street.

2035
01:34:15,240 --> 01:34:16,960
It was ninety nine Fear Street trilogy.

2036
01:34:17,160 --> 01:34:19,240
He's reading one crime novel.

2037
01:34:19,440 --> 01:34:22,440
He's reading one of his crime novels a day at this point.

2038
01:34:22,640 --> 01:34:23,400
That's right.

2039
01:34:23,600 --> 01:34:25,240
Yes. Well, it's a Halloween season.

2040
01:34:25,440 --> 01:34:27,800
So I'm reading Spook and reading Ghost Story.

2041
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,240
I'm reading Peter Strab book.

2042
01:34:30,440 --> 01:34:32,720
That was the which is the basis

2043
01:34:32,920 --> 01:34:34,840
our our love of old actors.

2044
01:34:35,040 --> 01:34:35,800
It was a lot of actors.

2045
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:39,720
Let the movie version in 1981 with like Melvin Douglas,

2046
01:34:39,880 --> 01:34:41,720
Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.

2047
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:44,520
Like it's all like these million year old guys.

2048
01:34:44,720 --> 01:34:45,920
Sure. But how?

2049
01:34:46,120 --> 01:34:46,920
Let me ask you this.

2050
01:34:47,120 --> 01:34:51,000
Have you listened to a really killer Synthy Baseline lately?

2051
01:34:51,200 --> 01:34:53,200
No, you haven't.

2052
01:34:53,400 --> 01:34:57,240
And I guarantee you, Scott, I both listened to some sort of synth bass today.

2053
01:34:57,440 --> 01:34:58,680
We all have our strengths.

2054
01:34:58,880 --> 01:35:00,200
We all have our enthusiasm.

2055
01:35:00,400 --> 01:35:01,240
We all have our strengths.

2056
01:35:01,440 --> 01:35:04,920
Yeah. So that's I'm just saying if the podcast was about synth

2057
01:35:05,120 --> 01:35:08,240
baseline, synthy baselines, then you'd be on it all the time.

2058
01:35:08,440 --> 01:35:09,200
Yes.

2059
01:35:09,440 --> 01:35:11,920
But that's maybe yeah, that's easier to digest for some people.

2060
01:35:12,120 --> 01:35:15,560
I will say I'm just going to do some light roasting again.

2061
01:35:15,760 --> 01:35:16,080
Go ahead.

2062
01:35:16,280 --> 01:35:20,080
That Mike is in a better mental place, emotional.

2063
01:35:20,280 --> 01:35:21,320
Well, we'll find out.

2064
01:35:21,520 --> 01:35:22,080
We'll find out.

2065
01:35:22,280 --> 01:35:23,920
I did say you had a coffee, so it's a risk.

2066
01:35:24,120 --> 01:35:27,840
But so of you,

2067
01:35:28,040 --> 01:35:30,440
little Goldilocks present,

2068
01:35:30,640 --> 01:35:32,840
Scott read a book.

2069
01:35:33,040 --> 01:35:33,600
Yeah.

2070
01:35:33,800 --> 01:35:34,960
Oh, yeah.

2071
01:35:35,160 --> 01:35:36,520
Three books.

2072
01:35:36,720 --> 01:35:39,120
Mike read a Goosebumps.

2073
01:35:39,320 --> 01:35:41,440
What's the difference?

2074
01:35:41,640 --> 01:35:47,240
What's the length of a Goosebumps takes maybe 25 minutes like a pamphlet.

2075
01:35:47,440 --> 01:35:51,240
It's like a yeah, it's like a map, a horror pamphlet.

2076
01:35:51,440 --> 01:35:56,880
I need to get like Hypno like a hypnotherapist needs to trick, like trick me or whatever they do.

2077
01:35:57,080 --> 01:35:59,960
You probably have ADHD, right?

2078
01:36:00,160 --> 01:36:01,800
You got some form of ADHD.

2079
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:03,440
I got something. Something's wrong.

2080
01:36:03,640 --> 01:36:05,080
Like I can't read a comic book.

2081
01:36:05,080 --> 01:36:08,400
I find it very overwhelming to have to like keep track of the panels and the

2082
01:36:08,440 --> 01:36:10,920
sure the word bubbles and the visuals.

2083
01:36:11,120 --> 01:36:12,560
But I need a common

2084
01:36:12,760 --> 01:36:16,000
but hand me a layman's and I'll finish it on a plane ride.

2085
01:36:16,200 --> 01:36:19,040
I need a drawing to show me what's happening.

2086
01:36:19,240 --> 01:36:20,760
That's what is going on with me.

2087
01:36:20,960 --> 01:36:22,480
What does it look like?

2088
01:36:22,680 --> 01:36:24,720
Are there punches?

2089
01:36:24,920 --> 01:36:28,480
Mike has patience for some things and that is cues.

2090
01:36:28,680 --> 01:36:28,960
Yes.

2091
01:36:29,160 --> 01:36:30,360
Do any cue.

2092
01:36:30,560 --> 01:36:32,000
Yes. Do your homework.

2093
01:36:32,200 --> 01:36:33,200
Do your cue.

2094
01:36:33,400 --> 01:36:35,560
If it's a cue, I can handle it.

2095
01:36:35,720 --> 01:36:39,240
If there's enough stimulation for me in a cue, but not if there were

2096
01:36:39,440 --> 01:36:45,400
if it's cue on Star Trek, well, I can put up with his caddy business all day.

2097
01:36:45,600 --> 01:36:47,680
I love Q.

2098
01:36:47,880 --> 01:36:50,040
If there was a book that had the chapters

2099
01:36:50,240 --> 01:36:54,920
written on the walls of a queue at a theme park, that might be the best situation

2100
01:36:55,120 --> 01:36:59,560
because I'm very comfortable and not like fidgeting around in a queue.

2101
01:36:59,760 --> 01:37:01,520
It also comes with a lot of visuals.

2102
01:37:01,720 --> 01:37:03,160
Yes, that's true, too.

2103
01:37:03,320 --> 01:37:06,360
So, yeah, look, I'll get all visual.

2104
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:08,000
I'm trying to grow.

2105
01:37:08,200 --> 01:37:10,320
I'm trying to get better.

2106
01:37:10,520 --> 01:37:11,440
Don't grow too much.

2107
01:37:11,640 --> 01:37:14,040
You can't get unraging spirits.

2108
01:37:15,480 --> 01:37:17,280
We can.

2109
01:37:17,480 --> 01:37:18,600
You can.

2110
01:37:18,800 --> 01:37:20,680
Yes, you can.

2111
01:37:20,880 --> 01:37:24,320
But you're not necessarily getting old.

2112
01:37:26,400 --> 01:37:27,200
All right. You know what?

2113
01:37:27,400 --> 01:37:31,560
Thank you for bringing us this energy that apparently you bring us.

2114
01:37:31,640 --> 01:37:35,360
The dark, dark energy, the haunt cast, the fright energy.

2115
01:37:35,560 --> 01:37:36,720
The dark. Yes, indeed.

2116
01:37:36,920 --> 01:37:38,000
You kicked us off right.

2117
01:37:38,200 --> 01:37:38,560
Lizzy K.

2118
01:37:38,760 --> 01:37:42,120
You survived the haunt cast, the fright.

2119
01:37:42,320 --> 01:37:44,680
Is there a let's exit through the gift shop

2120
01:37:44,880 --> 01:37:50,840
covered in ornate paintings of Joe Rody getting stroked by maidens.

2121
01:37:51,040 --> 01:37:53,720
And is there anything you would like to plug?

2122
01:37:53,920 --> 01:37:57,200
Sure. Check out Infinity Train on HBO Max.

2123
01:37:57,400 --> 01:38:00,800
It is a cartoon that I wrote for and is now

2124
01:38:00,800 --> 01:38:04,880
unfortunately over, but I highly recommend it.

2125
01:38:05,080 --> 01:38:10,160
And also check out my podcast Teen Creeps on which me and my co-host,

2126
01:38:10,360 --> 01:38:15,360
Kelly Nugent, review YA pulp fiction of the 80s and 90s.

2127
01:38:15,560 --> 01:38:17,040
Right on. We have all appeared on it.

2128
01:38:17,240 --> 01:38:18,160
Check out our website.

2129
01:38:18,360 --> 01:38:20,440
A lot of fun. Mine was recent.

2130
01:38:20,640 --> 01:38:22,200
So you'll find it early as you're scrolling.

2131
01:38:22,400 --> 01:38:24,040
So check it out. Yeah, that's the quickest one.

2132
01:38:24,240 --> 01:38:28,880
Go check out Scott's episode if you need a quick, like, weigh in because you know the other person talking.

2133
01:38:28,960 --> 01:38:32,680
And if you want to hear me say Book was good,

2134
01:38:32,880 --> 01:38:35,560
then go to my episode.

2135
01:38:35,760 --> 01:38:40,800
Book had no photo, no pictures except for the front.

2136
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:44,400
As for us, you can find us on all the socials at podcast.

2137
01:38:44,600 --> 01:38:47,560
The ride merch is available in our T public store.

2138
01:38:47,760 --> 01:38:52,040
If you're interested in watching CGI characters interact with real human

2139
01:38:52,040 --> 01:38:55,200
characters inexplicably and go to YouTube and look up Tower of Terror,

2140
01:38:55,240 --> 01:38:57,000
the mystery, which we have no stake in.

2141
01:38:57,200 --> 01:38:59,680
I just want that to be viewed.

2142
01:38:59,880 --> 01:39:04,400
And for three bonus episodes every month, check out podcast, the ride, the second gate.

2143
01:39:04,600 --> 01:39:05,640
Or what was it?

2144
01:39:05,840 --> 01:39:09,920
Hunk has the fright, the cemetery gate at Patreon dot com slash podcast, the right

2145
01:39:10,120 --> 01:39:12,560
regular URL still.

2146
01:39:12,760 --> 01:39:14,280
Well, that'll do it.

2147
01:39:14,480 --> 01:39:19,360
I'm going to go relax after a queue length of getting yelled at.

2148
01:39:19,560 --> 01:39:22,680
Yeah, that's a scenario and I'm a man.

2149
01:39:22,840 --> 01:39:25,640
And then you may try to chill out until the episode comes out.

2150
01:39:25,840 --> 01:39:28,280
And then I get yelled at all over again.

2151
01:39:28,480 --> 01:39:30,240
Well, remember, Scott is right.

2152
01:39:30,440 --> 01:39:33,120
Sixty nine at Gmail dot com.

2153
01:39:33,320 --> 01:39:34,920
Scott Nation.

2154
01:39:35,120 --> 01:39:37,000
You're afraid of getting censored.

2155
01:39:37,200 --> 01:39:38,080
People are out there.

2156
01:39:38,280 --> 01:39:41,360
They're on the run from the opinion police.

2157
01:39:41,560 --> 01:39:42,880
Then

2158
01:39:43,080 --> 01:39:44,320
you can go.

2159
01:39:44,520 --> 01:39:45,120
John is right.

2160
01:39:45,320 --> 01:39:47,560
Sixty nine at Gmail.

2161
01:39:47,760 --> 01:39:50,400
I'll reserve it as soon as I get home.

2162
01:39:50,600 --> 01:39:51,280
Or you do.

2163
01:39:51,280 --> 01:39:54,000
Yeah, I don't I don't need to see him

2164
01:39:54,200 --> 01:39:54,840
anyway.

2165
01:39:55,040 --> 01:39:55,840
OK, do that.

2166
01:39:56,040 --> 01:39:58,760
And your support more scary stuff coming soon.

2167
01:39:58,960 --> 01:39:59,280
It's going to be fun.

2168
01:39:59,480 --> 01:40:01,240
October. So long.

2169
01:40:01,440 --> 01:40:02,280
Goodbye.

2170
01:40:02,480 --> 01:40:04,640
