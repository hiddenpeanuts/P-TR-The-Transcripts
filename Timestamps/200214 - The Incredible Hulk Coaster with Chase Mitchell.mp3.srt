1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:10,040
Warning, this is General Thunderbolt Ross, the Hulk's potential future father-in-law.

4
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:13,400
Thank you for volunteering for our Talked Secret government project.

5
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:16,800
This podcast episode will shoot your body full of gamma radiation.

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,840
Be prepared to have supercharged opinions on launch coasters, complicated locker systems,

7
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,520
and the music of Fallout Boy.

8
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:49,600
Chase Mitchell joins us to discuss the incredible Hulk coaster on Podcast the Ride.

9
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:55,240
Welcome to Podcast the Ride, the show where before we hit record, we say every time, I

10
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:59,760
think this time it's going to work.

11
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,960
I'm Jason Sheridan here with Mike Carlson.

12
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:05,240
Yes, I'm here and I do think it's going to work this time.

13
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,240
Yeah, yeah.

14
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,840
Now it's become a good luck charm, we have to say.

15
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,200
Scott Gertner also here.

16
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:15,560
Yeah, and I'm glad you explained what that is because this is a, I say it, we all say

17
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,840
I've never known what it meant because I've gotten braver but I have not been brave enough

18
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,360
to go on today's topic.

19
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:31,200
One of what I will say is the most intense roller coasters in the country.

20
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,320
Oh, hey, well you're cutting me slack, I appreciate that.

21
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,360
Yeah, it seems like it's probably, well that's a thing to ask about.

22
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,080
How much of a level up is it?

23
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:41,680
Do you think I can handle it next time around?

24
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:48,240
Hey, but let's bring our guest in who picked this topic with us, writer for The Tonight

25
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,520
Show with Jimmy Fallon and the upcoming inside job on Netflix, Chase Mitchell is here.

26
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,280
Hey guys, thank you for having me.

27
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,280
Thanks for being here.

28
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,280
Yeah, yeah.

29
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,280
Thanks for joining us.

30
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:02,560
Yeah, yeah, and for throwing this ride out among a bunch of other rides.

31
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,960
I guess, so you seem like a parks person to some extent.

32
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,440
Well, yeah, big time.

33
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:13,120
I mean, like, so I grew up in Atlanta, Georgia and so we were a big like drive to Orlando

34
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,120
family.

35
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,120
Oh, sure.

36
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,120
A lot of summer trips.

37
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,120
Oh, gotcha.

38
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,120
Okay, very nice.

39
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,120
How long is that drive?

40
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:24,400
Gosh, I want to say like at least like six or seven hours.

41
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,520
Okay, so you can do it in a day but it's not the most like risky.

42
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:31,720
Yeah, yeah, it's not, yeah.

43
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:34,880
Yeah, it was not fun.

44
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:39,120
There's a lot of like my dad making the same bad jokes every year because there was some

45
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:45,760
kind of like when you're driving through like South Georgia, you know, like I love Atlanta

46
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:51,600
and I feel, you know, I always kind of like vouch for it and and but like it's a very

47
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,080
blue city and a very red state.

48
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,020
And so when you leave, as soon as you like leave the perimeter of the city, it's literally

49
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:00,720
surrounded by a highway.

50
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,320
And then when you get outside of that, everything is bad.

51
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:11,080
And so we would we would there was like all kinds of like weird like nut farms and stuff

52
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:14,320
like that and like weird like side of the road kind of stuff.

53
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:18,440
And my dad would always make the same shitty jokes about the about the billboards that we

54
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,440
would see.

55
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,440
I see.

56
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,440
Yeah.

57
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,440
Would you stop ever?

58
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,080
Sorry, I was like, is it like world's largest ball of yarn, like stuff like that?

59
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:28,560
It wasn't even stuff that was that interesting.

60
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,520
Ball of yarn would have actually been great.

61
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:34,240
Yeah, no, it was it was just a lot of like a gas station.

62
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,280
It's bigger than a normal gas station.

63
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,280
Yeah.

64
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,280
Yeah.

65
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,280
And really proud of that thing.

66
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:45,920
This is kind of a great part of the the theme park experience that I think we've never brought

67
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:50,520
up because I definitely had this growing up, too, especially when it's like a regular place

68
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,680
that you go a little more frequently.

69
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:59,520
I only went to Disneyland like once a year as a kid, but we'd always always pass by camping

70
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,320
world on the way down.

71
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,640
And my dad would always say like, guess what?

72
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,640
We're good.

73
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,640
We're doing change of plans.

74
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,240
We're doing camping world instead.

75
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,440
And why can I just laugh at that?

76
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:15,160
I had to go, no, I don't want to go to camping.

77
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,240
Like, why did I have to take that?

78
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,960
Well, what age are we talking?

79
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:21,280
I probably still eight or nine.

80
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,400
I'm worried he's going to do it.

81
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,800
I guess I could say eight or nine.

82
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,440
If you said 11 or 12, I was going to be a little more worried about it.

83
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,640
I think I kept whining to that degree.

84
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,200
I was whining about plenty at 11.

85
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:39,240
I was also the sort of child who, if my parents said something like as a joke, but said it

86
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:45,720
a little seriously, you know, like, hey, we're going to this instead, I would lose it.

87
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,200
I would get very upset.

88
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:51,880
It is not surprising to me that we share that characteristic.

89
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:52,880
Yeah.

90
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,880
Weird anxiousness.

91
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:58,160
I guess you got to remember a child doesn't understand irony.

92
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,480
Yeah.

93
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,360
No, this was a statement made in jest.

94
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,320
So if I had said before we started, by the way, we're not doing Hulk, we're doing the

95
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,840
storm spinner ride.

96
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,280
You both may have flipped out on.

97
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,760
I have a lot to say about storm force acceleration.

98
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,760
OK.

99
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:15,280
So yeah, you might you might be OK with that.

100
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,280
All right.

101
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:22,200
No, all I would have done that for is if you'd said we're repeating anything from the downtown

102
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,200
Disney or deal.

103
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,200
OK.

104
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,640
We have to do level three stage two again.

105
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,640
No.

106
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,640
A new store opened.

107
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,520
We're back to Wetzel's.

108
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:41,960
Is there six flags in the six flags out like right outside of the city, six flags over

109
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,160
Georgia.

110
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:47,680
They were probably the last one to still have a Confederate flag as one of the flags.

111
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,360
Yeah, one of the six.

112
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:55,040
There is like a very like kind of uncomfortable, like plantation section of the of the park

113
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,040
that hasn't aged well.

114
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,520
I think they may have updated it.

115
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,520
I haven't been back to six.

116
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,400
I believe they have.

117
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,960
But yeah, they didn't do it soon enough.

118
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,120
Yeah, I can tell.

119
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,120
There was it.

120
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,440
There was an entire ride like a dark ride called Monster Plantation.

121
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,440
Oh, yeah.

122
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,440
Yeah.

123
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,080
So racist monsters.

124
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,080
That was fun.

125
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,080
Yeah, it was basically.

126
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,200
Yeah, it was it was sort of like the haunted mansion.

127
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,800
With uncomfortable history.

128
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,160
And they were it's not just the if because if they were racist against each other, the

129
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:29,320
types of monster is considered a race and they're racist against each other.

130
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,320
That's not really hurting anybody.

131
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:33,560
I still know one should be racist, not even against other monsters.

132
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:37,960
But I just I just wouldn't even understand the affiliations and where the problems were.

133
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,400
I just wouldn't like the message.

134
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,400
Yeah, either way.

135
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,840
It's still you could overlay the hate into your own world.

136
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,040
If Frankenstein's didn't go along with Dracula's.

137
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,000
I guess they probably.

138
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,280
That's what you're saying.

139
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,280
Yeah.

140
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,200
But if not, because they're monsters who are mad at each other in like a fighting way,

141
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:58,400
if it's just more of a hypothetical, more Dracula's moving into town.

142
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,400
I see.

143
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,400
Yeah.

144
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,120
Well, the ride is different now, right?

145
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,920
I believe they've changed the ride.

146
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,600
I think it may be called like Monster Mansion or something.

147
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,720
They just like lost the word plantation.

148
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,720
Right.

149
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:13,200
And they like changed maybe hopefully the architecture outside a bit.

150
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,200
Yeah.

151
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:17,720
They finally admitted who really won the war.

152
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,720
The monster war.

153
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,400
I like a lot of these.

154
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,800
They stopped calling it the war of northern aggression.

155
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,800
Yes.

156
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,800
Yeah.

157
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,800
Monster.

158
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,800
The monster war of northern aggression.

159
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,800
Yeah.

160
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,800
Yeah.

161
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,800
I have it.

162
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,800
OK.

163
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,800
I also do.

164
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,240
I don't want to put I don't want to put you on the spot here.

165
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:39,440
But when we were talking about potential rides that we could talk about, you did you did work

166
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,920
at you did work at Jimmy Fallon.

167
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,760
You've not been on Race Through New York.

168
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,760
I haven't.

169
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,760
I actually left.

170
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:51,000
This is I don't I don't think I'll get in trouble for saying anything.

171
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,600
I'm going to be dreaded careful.

172
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,600
Wait.

173
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:57,960
Before you do, because I thought about this and I wanted to give you an option because

174
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:03,800
not too long ago, Griffin Newman volunteered to do Race Through New York with us at some

175
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,280
point behind the paywall.

176
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,640
We feel a little bit a little bit safer.

177
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:13,640
But yeah, so if there's anything you feel is dicey, maybe leave a voicemail.

178
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:20,440
Or you can be like or you can just you can say like you can say a safe word or something

179
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:23,680
and then we can just like snip this out and move it over.

180
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:28,800
Well, I mean, I'm totally fine talking about they actually were working on that ride sort

181
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,480
of right up until the time when I left.

182
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:38,400
And during during my time at Fallon, we did I believe two years prior to that, we did

183
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,200
a week of shows in Orlando.

184
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,240
So we were there for one of the.

185
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,200
We would do a week of show.

186
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,640
We did a week of shows in Orlando and then we did a couple of weeks of shows

187
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:54,200
here in L.A. where we would stay at the Hilden that's right there on the in Universal.

188
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:58,840
And we would basically we'd be working in the studio there and then we would have access

189
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:02,800
to the park. Basically, we just like basically just like walk out and like people would do

190
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,880
that. I got to go to the bathroom and then we go ride the Jurassic Park ride and come

191
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,040
back. It was pretty sweet.

192
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,280
The in Orlando, it was it was more fun because frankly, it's it's obviously it's a much

193
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:18,080
bigger, better park because they're not dealing with they're not having to plan a park around

194
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,080
a working studio.

195
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:25,400
They're like, quote unquote studio in Orlando is like I think the biggest thing they ever

196
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,280
made there was like a Jimmy Buffett music video.

197
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:31,000
Like they have plaques on the wall of like the stuff that they made there.

198
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,680
Yes, we know.

199
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,720
I'm talking to the press.

200
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:43,560
But it was pretty cool because like we'd be working in the studio and like you just hear

201
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:49,640
of the roller coaster whoosh by like every 35 seconds because we were literally right

202
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:52,000
under the that rock and roll pride.

203
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,240
Rip right in rock. Yeah.

204
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:56,480
Oh, that's right. Because that just like took over where all the sound stages.

205
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:59,640
Yeah. Odd like kind of unthemed ride.

206
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,320
The theme is interrupting work on.

207
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,160
Yeah. Like as they stopped doing like Nickelodeon shows there and stuff like that, they just

208
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:10,400
gradually it's just become like less and less of a studio and like more and more of a theme

209
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,080
park, which is great.

210
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:15,760
But yes, we did a week of shows there and then I don't know when they made the decision,

211
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:20,680
but somewhere along the way they were like, we're going to we're going to do a Jimmy Fallon

212
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:25,320
ride, which is so I remember when they told us at work and like it was so strange because

213
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:29,360
it's like it just doesn't seem like something that's the basis for right.

214
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,280
Like there wasn't like a Johnny Carson roller coaster.

215
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,280
No wish.

216
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:37,280
No, if only or and it's a small world.

217
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,920
Yeah. Dancing Edo's.

218
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:41,280
Carnac's Haunted Mansion.

219
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Oh, his head.

220
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,040
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

221
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,120
She is well in retrospect.

222
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,080
Now there should be this.

223
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,520
Yeah. Jokes the whole time.

224
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,840
We've been missing opportunities.

225
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:54,200
So then were you part of any conversations about what?

226
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,200
No, it was pretty it was pretty high level stuff.

227
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:02,160
We had our our supervising supervising writers kind of handled.

228
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,960
They basically wrote the ride.

229
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:04,960
OK, OK.

230
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:10,800
And they worked on it kind of as a side project for, you know, I believe like a year or so.

231
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,160
And there was all kinds of like there were days where they were shooting.

232
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,120
They were shooting in the studio and stuff like that.

233
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,160
So, yeah, I still haven't seen it.

234
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:23,840
But I along the way, I did see a lot of the like kind of test art and stuff like that.

235
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:27,280
And there were there were totally weird things like I think I was telling you about this

236
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:30,920
in the DM, but like there's a character on our show.

237
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:34,800
We had a recurring character called Hashtag the Panda.

238
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:40,560
It was like if you could imagine like the masturbating bear from Conan, but like without a joke to it.

239
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,120
It's basically that.

240
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,960
But he exists.

241
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:49,240
It was it was kind of started as I mean, it was still funny for us.

242
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:52,000
I don't know why it was funny for audiences, but like

243
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:56,400
Hashtag the Panda is one of the writers, John Haskell.

244
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:01,240
And the bit kind of started because Jimmy thought it would be funny to basically torture him.

245
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:08,360
Like he puts him in this insanely hot, heavy bear costume and has him dance while the roots play.

246
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,440
And Jimmy can kind of cue up the music over and over again.

247
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:16,000
And basically what he would do is just keep going until he would wear John out.

248
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:19,560
Oh, OK. Oh, the point of it for us watching.

249
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:25,160
It was very funny because we would see our friend basically being tortured on national TV.

250
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:30,800
But yeah, then he kind of became like he became like a very often recurring character.

251
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:34,440
And he became he's kind of the big bad.

252
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,680
Did you say you guys wrote it? Yeah. Yeah.

253
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:40,960
OK, so, yeah, he's kind of the as I understand it, he's kind of the big bad on the ride.

254
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,640
Like he's there's kind of like a King Kong moment at the end or something.

255
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:50,040
Yeah, it's sort of it kind of replaces or it's the same beat a little bit as Maggie on the Simpsons ride.

256
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,720
Yeah, it's up giant. Yeah. Yeah.

257
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:57,200
So which like and then is that is that your phrase that that writer?

258
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,200
He's that he that's him. Yeah.

259
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,360
He's been immortalized in giant mode.

260
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,920
It's like are you he is he Andy circusing?

261
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,280
Yeah, I think he got paid like 200 bucks or something.

262
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,680
That's all the park rides pay. Yeah.

263
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,040
That's day right.

264
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:14,800
Now they have some poor guy in Florida who now has to wear that same suit

265
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,960
and dance around and pretend to be the same character.

266
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:20,040
Wow. It's like he planted this little torture game.

267
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:26,560
Yeah, like said, like the in the ultimate move, it's now like a virus that is spread to underpaid Orlando.

268
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:32,320
I I do think someday I'll make it back down to Orlando and check out the ride.

269
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:38,280
But it is kind of surreal because it's so they did another week of shows there when they were opening the ride

270
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,360
to kind of like go promote it and celebrate and stuff.

271
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,240
It was a big cross promotional thing.

272
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,880
It's like the same thing as like Universal putting Jimmy in Jurassic World is like the guy who's,

273
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:52,600
you know, which did feel very Jurassic World for all of its like faults,

274
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:56,480
like does feel very accurately theme parky and very universal.

275
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:04,400
That video is very and like the hijinks that happen while he's like spilling liquids in a science boat.

276
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:08,640
That feels like, well, that is what it's so true to like what that park would really.

277
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:12,320
Yeah, and extremely similar to like the videos he made for the.

278
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,800
Yeah, because he's the tram guy, which I will having.

279
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,160
When I worked there, it was the Whoopi Goldberg clips.

280
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:23,960
And I will certainly say the Fallon clips were like, yeah, I know who did the talk to the current guides

281
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:26,960
who have to watch these videos many, many times every day.

282
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:32,000
I don't know that you're slanted, but I like a better written than Whoopi.

283
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,720
But what we got eaten by scarabs. That was cool.

284
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:40,200
Well, I like that. And I like that they still use it because they didn't do a new one with Jimmy.

285
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,520
And they just couldn't.

286
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:45,120
Well, what are we going to replace the video? That's too much work.

287
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,840
So and I swear I did one tour where I like they didn't replace it.

288
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,520
And you have to say, Whoopi Goldberg, what are you doing here?

289
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,800
And she has not appeared in the tour.

290
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,400
So it's just her looking horrified.

291
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,840
I forgot that they left her in.

292
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,040
I even made that comment just now. Yeah.

293
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:03,560
So they did leave in the best Whoopi thing where she just gets eaten by bugs

294
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:06,280
and a horrifying thing like a horrifying scene.

295
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:09,440
Yeah, yeah. The entire screen is eaten.

296
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,640
And it's just this.

297
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:14,440
I mean, I like it maybe a little bit as a non sequitur that Whoopi Goldberg,

298
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,920
who you have not seen up until that point,

299
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:21,080
it's kind of like a good just like out of nowhere cameo.

300
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,680
Yeah, that's true.

301
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:25,160
I wonder, though, was it like Jimmy didn't want to get eaten by bugs?

302
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,960
I think they just forgot. That's his contract.

303
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,760
Maybe they. Yeah, he just is like, I don't want bugs.

304
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:31,480
No bugs. It's a very odd grouping of.

305
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:35,480
So it's Whoopi Goldberg, Jimmy and Chucky, I guess.

306
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:38,720
The only characters who appear.

307
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,320
Well, you have the as a guide, you have a lot of options of videos

308
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,520
that you can play or not play.

309
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:47,200
Oh, right. The writer, director of The Mummy, Stephen Summers.

310
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,440
He'll talk to you if you want.

311
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,880
I think they left one Ron Howard, who was the host before.

312
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,840
But just a weird stray.

313
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:58,080
You can make it a really confusing mess.

314
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:01,760
Oh, I think still current guides can correct me if I'm wrong,

315
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:06,080
but I still have the option to have like I'm Frankie Muniz in our new movie.

316
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,560
Big Fat Larn. Yeah.

317
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,760
Like still just promotional.

318
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,640
He says he has changed his name.

319
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:16,120
He's going by Cosmo now. Just a heads up. Is that real? Yes.

320
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:19,200
Whoa. That was a tweet he said out the other day.

321
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:22,080
I want something more mature sounding.

322
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,520
I'm going by Cosmo.

323
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:26,000
Is it Cosmo Muniz or is it just like a single word?

324
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,760
Single. That's a great question.

325
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,880
I don't know. You will figure we'll check back in on that.

326
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:32,240
I'll check on that. Yeah.

327
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,360
I that's really OK.

328
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,880
So guides don't use the big failure scene because he's Cosmo.

329
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,080
It's disrespectful to still use Frankie.

330
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,000
Yeah. Chase, can I ask a question?

331
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,200
Was the when you were in Orlando, was it the year that Jimmy went on

332
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,160
the roller coaster with Kevin Hart?

333
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,320
Kevin Hart. Yeah. Yes. OK.

334
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,040
Because I remember that, which is funny because I found a video

335
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,600
of what we're talking about today with two other celebrities going on.

336
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,600
I saw the same thing. OK.

337
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,000
We'll just tease that delicious.

338
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,040
Yeah, this is a real like torture celebrities ride.

339
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,320
Like it's a go to. I'm sorry to correct myself.

340
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:08,160
It's not Cosmo. Oh, it's Cisco.

341
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:12,720
Like Cisco systems like not like song song.

342
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,720
Cisco, see, uh, SEO.

343
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:20,520
I turn 34 next week and I think I finally outgrown the name Frankie.

344
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,600
It's very childish.

345
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:26,120
So from now on, I hereby declare I want to be called dot dot dot Cisco.

346
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,160
Cisco just screams professional adult who's got a shit together.

347
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,680
Yours truly Cisco Muniz.

348
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:35,040
S Y. Is that what you said?

349
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,400
Cisco or is SI?

350
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,800
No, see, I like communications.

351
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,600
Oh, right. Yeah.

352
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:43,680
So it's not like Benjamin Cisco from Star Trek, Deep Space Nine.

353
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:47,560
And it's not Cisco thong song Cisco. No, it's a different Cisco.

354
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,800
It's a different Cisco. Formal Cisco.

355
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:53,240
How seriously is he taking this? Do we think? I don't know.

356
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,760
I don't know. We're going to have to.

357
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:57,160
And when was this announcement made?

358
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,640
How long have we how long has it been a post Cisco world?

359
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,640
Eleven twenty eight November twenty eight.

360
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,280
Huh? Oh, wow.

361
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,560
Gee, we're going to do a whole deep thanksgiving.

362
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:08,960
I guess something's burned him on Thanksgiving Day.

363
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:12,440
Start practicing in case we have him on Cisco.

364
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:15,080
What about you changing your name, Jason?

365
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,560
Oh, I'm Cosmo now.

366
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,920
Now that you know Cosmo's free.

367
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,960
No mistakes, only gifts.

368
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:26,560
But as far as we know, Cisco hasn't been on this ride.

369
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,480
As far as celebrities have.

370
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,880
And the three of you have been on this ride.

371
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,000
And I was just in Orlando and I did not take the opportunity.

372
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:37,520
I'm curious what I might have thought.

373
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:42,680
Did you even for a second think about it after all the progress you've made

374
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,520
in your life? I.

375
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,440
And and what you're referring to is that I went to Orlando

376
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:53,000
and I was doing a lot more launching because I was dubbed a no launch queen.

377
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,400
And I've tried to overcome that.

378
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,120
And I did a lot of launches specifically in Orlando.

379
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,040
I did not do this.

380
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,560
Now that we're talking about it, I kind of wish I did it.

381
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:05,080
I feel like it was just a jam packed day a little bit.

382
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,400
That's that's a bad excuse.

383
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,640
But like not only that, but you guys did it.

384
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,920
But you also were like you kind of complained about a little.

385
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,440
You were a little as rough.

386
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,280
Well, yeah, we had to complain about it.

387
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,160
Sorry. Oh, no.

388
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,240
Has it like is it rocky?

389
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:23,320
Well, it's it's it's interesting because they've they redid the whole track

390
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,880
a couple of years ago. Yes.

391
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,040
And I have written it free and post that.

392
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,440
Yeah. OK, so yeah. OK.

393
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,400
Because I wrote it.

394
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,440
I've written it three times in my life.

395
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,000
You've written it like I've written it.

396
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,760
It does. I think I love this ride.

397
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:39,200
I love the first version of this ride.

398
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,400
I'm going to come out right away with a hot take.

399
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,480
The new version is worse.

400
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,320
Oh, yeah. It's bad.

401
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,440
It's not as good.

402
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:50,000
I miss the the the the I miss Bruce Banner.

403
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:50,880
It's the silliness.

404
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,000
I miss Bruce Banner saying, oh, I think it's going to work this time.

405
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,480
Like I miss him being locked in that cycle of failure.

406
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,800
Like you just fucking up every time.

407
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,360
Yeah. And you know, on the fourth, no.

408
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,040
Yeah. That's when you launch,

409
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:10,520
when you go from nine miles an hour to 40 miles an hour in two seconds.

410
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:15,040
And now it's just like a very sedate kind of it's it's a female voice

411
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:18,960
who just sounds kind of like a, you know, a launch code

412
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:20,760
person or something like that.

413
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,720
Just like just saying, like everybody stay calm.

414
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,480
And they kind of they change the story.

415
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,240
I have like I have complicated feelings about

416
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:32,360
roller coasters that are trying to also be a themed ride,

417
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:36,520
because I feel like it complicates things like and I think it's really hard to do.

418
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:41,440
Like I rode the Incredicoaster at Disneyland earlier this year.

419
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,600
And I think that's maybe a more successful version of it.

420
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:49,160
But I also think like it's very hard to like cram a story into a roller coaster.

421
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:53,520
Yeah. And I think that this one, they made the story like more complicated.

422
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:56,880
Like, yeah, it's the only re theming I can really think of

423
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,320
that gave it less of a story. Yeah.

424
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:03,000
Like they took out a lot of the Bruce Banner, the whole.

425
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,120
Yeah. The titular guy. Yeah.

426
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:09,120
And they added a lot more Thaddeus Ross, everyone's favorite general

427
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:15,240
Colonel Thunderbolt Ross is now of the Hulk.

428
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:18,200
Yeah. Not an enemy. Sometimes friends, sometimes enemies.

429
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:21,800
His girlfriend, wife's father, Betty Ross's father.

430
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:25,320
Yeah. So it's like he's just always he always is so mad at Bruce.

431
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,840
Yeah, it's like a real like 60s sitcom relationship.

432
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,600
Yeah, he's very mad.

433
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,960
Guys, my daughter and I hate him.

434
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:34,080
He said, bum is a little good bum.

435
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,120
Ten or 15 years.

436
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,760
He is also a hulk sometimes, but he's red.

437
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,000
He's the red hulk.

438
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,920
It's too much to get into right now.

439
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,200
I don't really know it either.

440
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,680
I feel like everyone in the orbit of Bruce Banner's life

441
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,680
just eventually becomes a hulk at some point.

442
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,000
Yes, it's true. There are a lot of hulks.

443
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,800
I read a bunch of hulk comics from the recent run, and it's kind of like a horror

444
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,920
thing where it's like in order for the Hulk come out,

445
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,360
Bruce has to die every time.

446
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,800
So he has to die.

447
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,760
And then the Hulk can only come out at night.

448
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,200
So he's just like stalking.

449
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:05,680
But then like they are touching on like everyone around the Hulk

450
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:08,080
gets infected by Gamma in some way.

451
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,440
And they're all in a hell of their own making.

452
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,600
How many people? That could be dozens of people.

453
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,520
Right. Yeah, it's a lot of hulks.

454
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,360
Well, Hulkling Hulkling is a hulk. That's his son.

455
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,600
That's his son.

456
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,920
Who's the newer hulk?

457
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,720
The main Amadeus chose on his way.

458
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,680
The show is a hulk.

459
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,840
Yeah. Bruce.

460
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,560
Jennifer Walters, she holds a horse.

461
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:34,320
Yeah, you see none of those characters you see, and you don't even see

462
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:37,520
Thunderbolt Ross. I don't know when he became Red Hulk,

463
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,000
but you don't even see Red Hulk in the ride.

464
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,960
Who is fun? He's Hulk, but he's red.

465
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,320
But it's in my.

466
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:48,080
Oh, sorry. I was just like that might be like a if you're going to put that character in

467
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:52,400
then, oh, is that a little tease of maybe they added they added stuff to they had Red Hulk?

468
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,840
No, did not do that.

469
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,320
He's hiding in a tunnel or something.

470
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:59,120
It's always like kind of historically you think of I mean, most people,

471
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,680
if they are aware of General Thunderbolt Ross,

472
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:05,160
I think he is an antagonist.

473
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,400
He hates the Hulk.

474
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:10,960
But the right now is that they want to they want to turn everyone on the ride into hulks.

475
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,640
Yes, they're going to do hulkification to you.

476
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:20,400
And they show you footage of past test subjects, but no Bruce Banner.

477
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,040
Yeah. So the Hulk, you know.

478
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:24,680
So this ride should now be called other hulks

479
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:29,080
because they have shown you other hulks and you are about to become a hulk.

480
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:31,960
Or like Hulk yourself, Hulk yourself.

481
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:34,880
Go Hulk yourself is the name of the ride.

482
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,360
The ride. Well, I did.

483
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:40,600
I did copy paste a quote, I think, from Terry Koo.

484
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,480
I could be saying both of those words wrong.

485
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,320
It was like a big universal major universal person at this point.

486
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,480
I think it's from him.

487
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,200
Is it theory? Coop?

488
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,160
Very well, I think.

489
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:51,560
Yeah. It's a mix of either one.

490
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,720
I don't know.

491
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,480
But this phrase was this press release.

492
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,720
He phrase was so odd.

493
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:58,040
I had to say it exactly.

494
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,640
We wanted to give our guests a first person experience

495
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,920
on what it's like actually hulking out.

496
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:07,360
So the whole that's the point of it is you're hulking out.

497
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,560
You kind of already did that.

498
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:13,200
Like you were helping Bruce because the original story was that Bruce

499
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:18,840
was going to try the Hulk experiment again, this time thinking it would unhulk himself.

500
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,800
That's what he thought.

501
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:21,760
Yes. Yes.

502
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,320
And he's 100 percent.

503
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:26,400
He thought he would synthesize the Hulk out of himself.

504
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:31,120
And what it really just did was wake up the Hulk and more.

505
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,640
Or just the same. Not even more.

506
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,360
He's not twice the Hulk.

507
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,320
Yeah, just the Hulk.

508
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:39,160
He's not the Hulk, but he's angry, which in.

509
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,200
But he's always rules.

510
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:43,240
But he's when the angrier he gets, the stronger he gets.

511
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:47,000
Yes. And that's why they can never kill him because it just makes him stronger.

512
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:50,080
How do you this is a little fun.

513
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,920
I get to ask all these questions having not been.

514
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:55,400
I haven't even watched the pre show, which I should have before doing this.

515
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,640
But I just get to now do Q&A.

516
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:02,440
The does he is that conveyed in videos

517
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:07,880
that he thinks that like and so the by the end of this, I will be unhulkified.

518
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:11,840
Do you watch him filling out paperwork like we check the unhulk box

519
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,080
in the older version?

520
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:17,600
Yeah, they pretty much tell you like you see clips of the Hulk destroying.

521
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:22,920
Steve said he's like, this is why I need to stop this and my experiment.

522
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:26,320
I'm going to try this to try and undo it.

523
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,560
But I'm going to try this big cannon.

524
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:32,080
This is going to get in a cannon cannon.

525
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,720
But and then something goes wrong.

526
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,600
So that's a classic theme park trope.

527
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:39,560
You're doing something with good intentions and it goes wrong,

528
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,560
especially in Universal.

529
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,280
I feel like all the ride love it.

530
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:45,760
The premise of all the rides is like it was supposed to be something else.

531
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,080
And then you get knocked off course or something like that.

532
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,600
That is a world fair.

533
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,120
It was an open house.

534
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,320
It was the set of the mummy.

535
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,800
And then real mummy things happen.

536
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:58,000
It's the set of Ghostbusters and real Ghostbusters things happen.

537
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:02,200
Feels like a needless layer to add on top of things a little bit.

538
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,840
I mean, for the Jurassic Park, right, it really works

539
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:07,160
because that's kind of that's fun.

540
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,520
That's like because that's the movie.

541
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,240
Yeah.

542
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:15,720
The now if you lay race through New York on top of this, it is not that

543
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:19,920
you are challenged to a race in the Tonight Rider and then you go on a race

544
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:20,720
in the tonight.

545
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,440
You're it's surprising what happens to you, but it's not the tonight

546
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,720
rider malfunctioned.

547
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:28,760
Yeah. And I think that the right.

548
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:32,840
So basically I left like before when they sent an email like

549
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:36,880
pick your seats on the plane because we're going back to Orlando.

550
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,040
I was like, I put in my two weeks that day.

551
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:42,160
To avoid it.

552
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:44,040
That's it. No, no, Orlando.

553
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,920
This is the last straw.

554
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:49,720
But so, yes, I didn't get to experience it.

555
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:53,560
But my understanding of it, it's really like surreal seeing it

556
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:56,800
because they created basically I know it's on like New York Street

557
00:26:57,040 --> 00:27:01,000
and they basically created a small 30 rock sort of. Yes.

558
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:03,680
So everything's kind of styled like 30 rock inside it.

559
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:04,520
Is that right?

560
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:07,400
And yeah, which I imagine would be eerie for somebody who's.

561
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,680
Yeah. There.

562
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:11,120
Yeah, I think I just didn't want the PTSD.

563
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:14,160
Sure. Yes. But it's rare that anyone's

564
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:18,600
place of work is recreated in a theme park unless you've worked in architectural

565
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:22,880
architectural ruins or a crazy man's collection

566
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,880
in a giant tower.

567
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:30,000
If you alphabetized a crazy man's collection of physical beings and dogs,

568
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,800
yeah, very, very few depicted.

569
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,760
But I guess it's like,

570
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:38,520
I guess like it's sort of based on the idea of like they will race

571
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,640
around the studio a lot and like go karts.

572
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:44,320
And I guess that's kind of where they that was the jumping off point for this.

573
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

574
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:51,800
Yeah. And things don't they they I'll give I'll give that credit

575
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:54,360
that it breaks from that. OK. Tradition.

576
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:57,200
It's not that a taping goes awry.

577
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:01,280
Although I kind of like this time now I'm spinning out like the Jimmy's kidnapped

578
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:04,760
or like just the, you know, Tariq is kidnapped.

579
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,640
The Symbionese Liberation Army is back.

580
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:10,040
It's them. They've got a real target. Yeah.

581
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,240
Oh, no. I mean, they can update.

582
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:16,120
This is a 3D movie ride. They can do a new movie.

583
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:19,760
I would kind of like to demand a different talent story.

584
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:22,960
Keep the Tonight Rider in it, like some of the elements. Yeah.

585
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:26,120
But yeah, well, if you have that at your disposal, you're going to.

586
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,960
Yeah, you're going to use it right to prevent future kidnappings.

587
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:33,320
It does feel like those rides would be easier to update than they.

588
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:37,480
I mean, maybe not like like Transformers has because it's like a hybrid

589
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,600
where you're also kind of on a track and stuff like that.

590
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,080
Yeah. Harry Potter one.

591
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:43,600
But the ones that are like Simpsons, like it feels like they could do

592
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,160
like a treehouse of horror Simpsons.

593
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,560
Oh, yeah. They just brought it out every year.

594
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,800
Yeah, absolutely.

595
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,400
Good. And they never do.

596
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,120
Yeah, very good idea.

597
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,880
Yeah. A scary Simpsons.

598
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,000
Yeah. Geez.

599
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,640
That's it. You know, they'll play the treehouse of horror music

600
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,480
and in Springfield and stuff like that.

601
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,280
And that's fun. But then you then you just ride the same ride.

602
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,320
I'm like a natural.

603
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:08,720
That's a really natural, not tortured holiday overlay. Right.

604
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:12,320
And the and a good excuse to like liven everything up and do a

605
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,960
you know, like brighten the ride.

606
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,920
Yeah, they tried. Right.

607
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,360
Didn't they try to brighten that screen?

608
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,600
I don't remember. They did.

609
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,080
That's OK. Never works.

610
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,440
Yeah. Yeah. It's a good idea.

611
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,480
They're going to do it.

612
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,680
Um, anyways. So.

613
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,320
So the current storyline of the Hulk.

614
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:32,880
Yes. Is that you are volunteering for a military experiment

615
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,200
where you will become a Hulk.

616
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,240
They're trying. Now they're trying to replicate the Hulk.

617
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,800
So that makes sense.

618
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,960
They know how to make one Hulk.

619
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:42,160
So in theory, they can make more Hulk.

620
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,640
But why do they want to?

621
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,960
Seems like it's scary to do. Yeah.

622
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:46,800
He hates those hulks.

623
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:50,920
Why? Yeah. He's a body horror story, honestly.

624
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:54,640
The other thing is like the the so the first one.

625
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,960
Yeah. Science experiment gone wrong.

626
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,120
Thing goes wrong as a theme park go to.

627
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:04,240
This is an experiment that goes exactly how it's supposed to go.

628
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:08,920
They start like as you are the launch, it starts saying initiating gamma exposure,

629
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:11,200
Hulk transformation, accelerating.

630
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,520
And then they say, do not be afraid.

631
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,880
Then they launch you like that.

632
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:19,160
Pre line. That is the pre line before the launch. Yeah.

633
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,720
And there's a totally different vibe than.

634
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,280
No, no, no.

635
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:26,440
It's kind of like you accept your fate.

636
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:29,640
Well, it's like I think that's also like the thinking now.

637
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:32,280
And you can see it with whatever they're going to do with Avengers

638
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:36,760
like campus and Disneyland, where it's like you become the Avengers,

639
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:40,640
suit up, sign forms and become a member of Blank.

640
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,320
And it's like it's all about your experience now.

641
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,160
And it's like, I don't know that people care about that.

642
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:48,440
Like, I don't think people just want to see the Hulk

643
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:50,360
or they want to see Iron Man. Yeah.

644
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:53,400
It's not like I need to like go train.

645
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:57,360
Walt Disney ran into this like with the first batch of Fantasyland rides

646
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:00,560
because you were supposed to see it from like Snow White perspective.

647
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:03,280
You know why he wasn't on the ride and everyone.

648
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:07,280
It's like, where are the characters we like? Yes. Yeah.

649
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:12,800
And I I cannot to just beat a dead horse, but I kind of like

650
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:16,640
I kind of like the ride where C3PO is in charge.

651
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:19,960
And that's why the flight goes awry in all these memorable ways

652
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:23,400
as opposed to where I'm in charge and I'm just stressed out.

653
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,800
Sure. I think that will drop it there.

654
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:30,120
But yeah, I think what you're saying,

655
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:32,640
not the requisite 20 minutes of it.

656
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,280
There's nothing I have to say about it.

657
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:38,720
Yeah, no, I mean, I think that, yeah, I think that it's like fun

658
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:41,080
being around characters you like.

659
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:44,400
And it's like, I don't know who's more fun, Iron Man or me,

660
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:47,000
Mike Carlson in an iron suit.

661
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,440
I wonder if they're kind of taking a page from Universal on that,

662
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:54,960
because I feel like Universal is very big on when the ride is over.

663
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,640
They're like, congratulations, you saved the world.

664
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:00,960
Like the Transformers ride, they say that like, hey, great job.

665
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,840
You saved. I like that, obviously.

666
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:05,360
But that's one of my favorite things.

667
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:09,320
That might also because they clap a lot, like at the end of the ride

668
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:13,360
that I think is a tie in to like when you wrap a day on set.

669
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:16,880
And it's like, all right, the wraps and everyone claps sort of thing.

670
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,320
Yeah, maybe I like that.

671
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:22,400
You're making me realize I kind of like when there's applause for me.

672
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,160
Like Harry Potter, like Harry Potter.

673
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:28,440
Yes. And I think kind of today to the Guardians clap.

674
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,000
Yeah. Well, they don't clap, but they wave.

675
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,360
It's kind of a name came out.

676
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,880
Yeah, that that works.

677
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,840
They're like end of SNL

678
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:40,640
moments where they wave and thank the host and Harry Potter.

679
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:44,400
Video of all of the characters for the movie clapping for you, right?

680
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,960
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Wow.

681
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:49,440
Is just something else have clapping or am I just thinking about a question?

682
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,280
Because I do like it.

683
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:54,800
I mean, they always on the mummy when you get off the mummy, they always clap.

684
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,080
Well, the cast members clap.

685
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:59,000
But the key other characters, universal.

686
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,200
Spider-Man takes your picture at the end.

687
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,200
Mm hmm.

688
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:05,080
No, clack like Stanley doesn't clap when he's driving a truck.

689
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,760
Somebody help us out here.

690
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:09,240
Please respond on Twitter.

691
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:11,400
Another ride that ends with applause.

692
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:16,360
I feel it doesn't do any of the Star Tours endings in with applause.

693
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,120
I don't if you land on Batu, dude, I don't think there's no one.

694
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:25,560
No, I just I just landed on Batu and Star Tours like a week ago.

695
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,720
And there were no claps.

696
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,760
No, no, no. They're going about their business.

697
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:30,000
I think, yeah.

698
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,000
When you're on the gun, when you're in Gungan City,

699
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,160
you end up just up on the ramp on the marina.

700
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:37,520
It's very interesting as I go through the scenarios.

701
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:40,680
There's the Namu one where you always get beheaded.

702
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,480
That's the same.

703
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,480
That's the same.

704
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,000
Well, should all be clapping.

705
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,600
I think maybe that's my very you like being thanked.

706
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,080
I think I like being clapped at.

707
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:51,440
Yes, because it makes me feel like I finished a show.

708
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:52,520
Yeah, that's true.

709
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:54,360
A round of applause makes everybody happy.

710
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:56,960
Yeah, tonight's show, I wonder, does that?

711
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,880
I don't remember what I'm now calling tonight's show, the ride.

712
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:02,720
It feels like that one probably ends with you back in the studio, right?

713
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,480
I assume it does.

714
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:07,600
Spoiler alert, but you're the audience.

715
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,520
Right. So why would they clap?

716
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,320
We're clapping.

717
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,440
Just help us out on Twitter.

718
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,480
Tell us if it tells another ride that ends with clapping.

719
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,800
I know there's an obvious one and I'm not coming up with it.

720
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,840
OK, so the reason I think because I was thinking about this,

721
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:22,120
like I do like aesthetically, the ride looks like a little more modern now.

722
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:24,840
It doesn't look like the gaudy great.

723
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:27,000
Don't get me wrong. I'm not saying gaudy in a bad way.

724
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,720
Marvel Superhero Island.

725
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:29,840
They stripped all your purple.

726
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:30,920
Yeah, I know. That's a bummer.

727
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:33,360
Marvel Superhero Island itself looks like it's stuck in the 90s,

728
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:35,840
but Hulk looks a little bit more modern.

729
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:39,480
And it's like, as you're saying, like there's not like characters on the ride.

730
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:43,320
So it feels like any kernel of character

731
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,680
like that has been stripped away.

732
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:49,080
So we're just like begging to just please give us a little of the Hulk.

733
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:50,440
And that's gone.

734
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,440
Yeah, it's just like that.

735
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,480
We were like, we're still we're starving.

736
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,600
We're thirsty for Hulk.

737
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:59,800
And now he's missing from the ride that barely he's not in it at all.

738
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:03,040
Well, even just character in the other sense of like

739
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:06,920
it used to there used to be a lot of purple and green everywhere,

740
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:10,320
like the color of Hulk and his cartoonish purple pants.

741
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,240
Yes. That's fun. That's kind of fun.

742
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,960
Now it's all like drab.

743
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:16,240
It's all like dark blues and silver and stuff.

744
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,600
It is sort of a color scheme.

745
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:20,400
I think you would you're going to get if there another Hulk ride gets built.

746
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,560
Like that's probably the mode.

747
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,200
We're not in a cartoon mode.

748
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:27,920
We're in a like making superheroes grounded and real.

749
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:31,200
Yeah. And that's why they took out the flat with the big Adam

750
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:35,360
Qbert drawing of Banner becoming the Hulk and put in the big Hulk statue

751
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:37,880
where he's ripping the track apart, which is cool.

752
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:38,760
Like that looks cool.

753
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:41,080
That's your old track that they replaced.

754
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:43,280
They used it for like the Hulk ripping it apart.

755
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,600
It's like, yeah, yeah.

756
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:48,040
If you went to Peter Pan, though, and it was just a Peter Pan statue outside.

757
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,480
And that was it. Yeah.

758
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,000
Like you didn't get to see him.

759
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,920
I do kind of like the I missed it.

760
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:53,840
I missed the purple.

761
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:57,520
That is like just such a fun, like comic booky color combo.

762
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,960
Yeah. You just don't see any.

763
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,440
That's so him.

764
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:04,560
I do kind of like they added a lot of like

765
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:09,240
LED kind of like sizzling, like effects and stuff like that.

766
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,440
When you're in the tunnel.

767
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:12,560
Yeah. You used to just be lights, right?

768
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:15,880
Yeah. You just be blinking colored lights and now it's kind of.

769
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,040
Yeah, it is more LED.

770
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,880
That looks nice. That stuff is clearly unimproved.

771
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,440
But at what cost?

772
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,640
Yeah. What cause?

773
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,840
I will say this, I think.

774
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:27,440
I read a site that didn't seem to have like the total,

775
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:31,280
the most confident info in this, but I think that could be the longest

776
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:34,840
array of LED screens anywhere.

777
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:37,440
Interesting. Doesn't mean it's the biggest LED, but the law.

778
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:41,480
It means it's longer than whatever's in like the Space Mountain lift.

779
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:47,360
Oh, so if length does anything for you, then that's good.

780
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:52,080
Can we talk about, though, the

781
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:56,960
maybe the most prominent plus up, which is the score?

782
00:36:57,560 --> 00:37:02,160
Oh, well, of course, yes, I was waiting for us to get to this.

783
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,840
Of course, there used to not be any score.

784
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:09,200
You that Riley just kind of roars like the Hulk screaming.

785
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,080
But there is a new score.

786
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:12,640
Would you fill us in?

787
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:19,040
Why the score added in 2016 is by Patrick Stump of Fall Out Boy.

788
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,240
Deep singer, Fall Out Boy.

789
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:24,240
We are now rocking with Fall Out Boy.

790
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:31,160
And what I put together is that, OK, so this is summer 2016.

791
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:33,120
This overlay happens.

792
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:38,320
And this is the exact same summer that Fall Out Boy is rocking the planet

793
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:41,880
with the new way, a thousand times better

794
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:45,880
theme from Ghostbusters. Answer the call, Ghostbusters.

795
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,920
I'm not afraid.

796
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:53,960
Uh, to use the example of the to use the

797
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,560
ride that we're talking about.

798
00:37:55,560 --> 00:38:00,200
Ray Parker Jr.'s Ghostbusters is a real like wimpy Bruce Banner of the song.

799
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:04,800
And they turned it into the Hulk that it was always meant to be.

800
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:07,880
So this is an all star summer for Fall Out Boy.

801
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:11,320
The 2016 the year the year of the boy.

802
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,760
Is that when the Uva Thurman song came out?

803
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,760
The monsters. Is that them?

804
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:20,840
The Fall Out Boy? Is that around that too?

805
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,840
Uh huh. Can I just I else?

806
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:25,600
I have to admit, I had it queued up on on on Spotify.

807
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,600
Oh, sure. There's just a little taste.

808
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:30,280
Yeah, baby.

809
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:31,680
Wait, let me see.

810
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:35,760
What is this? Oh, yeah.

811
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:49,200
What? Oh, um.

812
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:53,040
I think I that style of singing.

813
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,040
And when he gets around,

814
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:59,040
I'm invisible man.

815
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:03,320
What an insane phrase to scream in that way.

816
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,480
And then Missy comes in.

817
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:09,280
Mm hmm. Who is afraid of ghosts?

818
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,120
I'm not afraid of ghosts.

819
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:12,440
What would you do for the new one?

820
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:15,360
Who would you have redo it in a new the right man?

821
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,880
The new right man, Jason Reitman.

822
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,920
Oh, geez. Stumps back, baby.

823
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:19,880
Yeah. Yeah.

824
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:20,880
Boys back.

825
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,400
Follow up, follow boy again.

826
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:25,640
And we're just increasing the time, the time by 10.

827
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:28,680
It's like 10 times faster and louder.

828
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,960
Way, way, way, way.

829
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:34,160
No, no, no. Because Ghostbusters, it's a it's a team.

830
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:36,840
It's got to be a team up like fall out boy and Missy.

831
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:40,440
And I think, you know what?

832
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:45,040
Yes, yes. Well, I'll include what you said, but also add.

833
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,320
Yeah, no, this is it.

834
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,880
All star lineup.

835
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:51,360
A fallout boy meets chicken foot meets Jared Leto.

836
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,880
Oh, you're a little boring.

837
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:56,120
Or 30 seconds to Mars.

838
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:57,160
Let's get them all in there.

839
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:59,240
Yeah, let's let's get all my other favorite.

840
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:01,480
It's Mike.

841
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:03,320
Oh, yeah. Chris has got to come.

842
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,800
Yeah. Yeah.

843
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:08,200
And you know what? Bring some of your weird cult friends to bring the.

844
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,880
Yes. The backup backup chorus.

845
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:13,760
Vocals from the entire Jared Leto cult.

846
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,920
OK. And then for the.

847
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:20,560
There's 5000 singers on the new version.

848
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:23,840
For the listeners who might not know chicken foot is Sammy Hagar's band

849
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,840
that he has with Anthony from Van Halen,

850
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,280
the drummer from the Red Hot Chili Peppers and.

851
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:31,280
Hey, when who's that? I know I.

852
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:34,840
You never heard of that outrageous.

853
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,680
Who's the other? Is it Steve Vai?

854
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:38,760
Is he in the group? Oh, really?

855
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,600
And he might be in the group as well.

856
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,920
All of it. And they all get a guitar solo.

857
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,640
Yeah. Yeah. Like a minute and a half.

858
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,840
That new Ghostbusters.

859
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,200
I'm still not afraid.

860
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,280
I want to be 35 minutes long.

861
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,240
I mean, I welcome that.

862
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,880
That is right up my alley.

863
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:58,280
I'll say this for the whole school. I don't mind it.

864
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:01,280
I don't know. It's a pretty standard roller coaster score.

865
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:04,360
And the queue theme is is fine, too.

866
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:07,600
Yeah, I don't I don't hate that part of it, but I'll say this.

867
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:10,280
I just it just I just forgot about Ghostbusters.

868
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:10,920
I'm not afraid.

869
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:13,160
I just needed to I needed to express it.

870
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:17,600
They they made a big thing of like we replaced the whole track

871
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:23,040
and brand new cars, and it is I find it no smoother.

872
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:25,440
If I kind of want to rougher.

873
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,760
Yeah, I think it got harder.

874
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:30,680
Yeah, that's what I was going to say is like the first time I rode it was before.

875
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:34,000
And it was like a couple of years, a year or two before they took it down.

876
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:36,320
And it was it's it's very intense.

877
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:39,560
But I wasn't like my neck or head didn't hurt that.

878
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:42,280
I thought one of the at the time, I thought one of the smoother

879
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:44,200
like metal coasters. Yeah.

880
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:45,880
And then you had you hold up on this, right?

881
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:51,600
It's it's very weird for a track post renovation to get

882
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:56,920
to get rougher because I there was a there was a roller coaster

883
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:59,640
at Six Flags called the Ninja.

884
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:01,680
It was I remember it was a big deal when it first opened.

885
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:02,760
It was back in the 90s.

886
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,720
And it was the first

887
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:07,080
might have been one of the first metal coasters at Six Flags over Georgia.

888
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:11,280
And it was it had six loops and that was like a huge deal.

889
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:14,840
It was the most the most loops that they had in the south, I think.

890
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:22,160
And it was like a super smooth coaster when it first opened.

891
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:25,080
And then like it's almost unrideable now.

892
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:28,520
Like when you ride it, it just ping pong is your head back and forth

893
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:30,360
on the headrest.

894
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:32,760
And yeah, I mean, I think I I agree.

895
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:35,680
I think I think it's it is a little you don't

896
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,000
want to have to like force your head to the back of the headrest

897
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,440
to keep it from banging around.

898
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:42,480
Yeah, yeah.

899
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,560
Be doing any work with your own body.

900
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:47,680
Well, on a red when I wrote it two years ago,

901
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:50,120
I don't remember what I was doing with my head, but I remember getting off

902
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:53,240
and be like and Lindsay and I both were like, oh, why does our head hurt?

903
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:56,400
So this time we went on it and I was trying to like, OK,

904
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,400
I'm going to like kind of relax.

905
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,160
Yeah. So I relaxed.

906
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:03,640
And as yours is, just as you described, my head ping ponged.

907
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:06,000
Oh, no, once or twice.

908
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,080
And I went, oh, shit, I can't do that.

909
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:09,680
Which I can't relax on the ride.

910
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:13,200
The original version of this was actually pretty good.

911
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:15,520
I didn't find that happening a lot.

912
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:17,440
Yeah, like the redo.

913
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:21,520
And I admit, I'm sure part of it is also my brain is slowly decaying

914
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:24,440
as I get older and my body.

915
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:27,440
I can't do this three times in a row anymore.

916
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:33,240
But when you and I wrote it, I thought it was it was all right.

917
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:36,920
But I went back later that day and I felt like I had been in a fight.

918
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:39,600
You did it again. I did it again that day.

919
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:40,600
We did it.

920
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:43,400
We did it. And even though even though I had ping ponged

921
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:45,840
and there was a spot where I almost grayed out a little bit,

922
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:49,720
where I was like, oh, like, yeah, I was not in like

923
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:51,040
I did not have a headache after it.

924
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:52,800
It was better than the time before.

925
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,520
We wrote in the front.

926
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:56,600
We wrote front row. Yeah.

927
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:59,480
Are you guys are you guys typically front guys or back guys?

928
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:02,680
I am scared of I'm trying.

929
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:05,960
The past few years, I'm trying to get better at roller coasters.

930
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,880
So I generally don't want the front.

931
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:10,560
This just sort of happenstance. We ended up in the front. OK.

932
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:14,760
Yeah. For this one, it's kind of fun to be typically like

933
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:17,200
I don't even know. I don't even know if this is fucking true.

934
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:19,600
But the idea that like when you're in the back,

935
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:21,560
you're going faster because you're being pulled.

936
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:22,920
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

937
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:24,840
So that's like the back is faster.

938
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:27,000
The front is scary because you get to.

939
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,040
But the front is you kind of sacrifice that thing of like, oh, well,

940
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:33,280
you'll also be like further down the hill

941
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:37,200
down the first hill before you pick up speed, which doesn't really apply

942
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:39,000
on this one because it launches you.

943
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:43,120
And I still remember very vividly, I think maybe my best experience

944
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:45,880
on this roller coaster was maybe the first time that ever did it,

945
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:48,360
because I did not know that it was a launch coaster.

946
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:49,440
I didn't know that was going to happen.

947
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:53,320
And the first time that happens, it's so like unexpected.

948
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:57,200
Yes. I guess it's you're in the the time in the cannon.

949
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:59,960
Yeah. So it's possible to be looking at it, not know

950
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:02,400
that it's not just a slow climb through.

951
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:05,960
Yeah. And it was the first launch coaster that I ever been on.

952
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:09,720
So I I just didn't know that they could do that.

953
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:10,960
Like, yeah, yeah.

954
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:12,840
I'm used to the click clack all the way to the top.

955
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:15,440
Like, that's kind of the that was the traditional experience.

956
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:18,840
And that was what I'd always sure was what I was accustomed to.

957
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:23,520
And it launches you up at an angle into a zero G roll.

958
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:26,520
And then you drop one hundred and fifty feet down.

959
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:28,600
Yeah. Like it's great.

960
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:31,880
Like down heading like you're going to hit the water. Yeah.

961
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,160
There's a lot.

962
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:37,080
There's a lot of a fat cobra rolls and and

963
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:40,280
I think it's called bunny hops.

964
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:41,960
It's so like so many.

965
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:42,960
It's such a crazy thing.

966
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:45,520
But I still I prefer this launch

967
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:49,160
because the thing that gets me is the anticipation.

968
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:51,440
Yeah. Usually it was as being a scared kid.

969
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:56,160
And like I never went on most of the six flags, the Great America Coasters,

970
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:58,040
even though like when Batman came out, it was the same thing

971
00:45:58,040 --> 00:45:59,920
where I was like, oh, cool, a Batman ride.

972
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:02,520
And my mom was like, I don't think Batman's actually like on the

973
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:04,280
just a roller coaster.

974
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:07,240
I was like, oh, like it was frustrating as a kid

975
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:09,400
as I heard Batman ride.

976
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:11,960
Yeah. Your mind runs wild with what that should be.

977
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,840
Yeah. Six Flags over Georgia.

978
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:15,160
Oh, all the six flags, actually.

979
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:18,760
I went to the one in Massachusetts earlier this year, and it's a lot.

980
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:22,240
There's so many rides that are like it's the Riddler ride or the Joker ride.

981
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:24,840
And yes. Oh, I mean, not really.

982
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:27,160
Yeah, it's green or it's black or.

983
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:32,680
Yeah, six flags, coasters to age, like a fine wine

984
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:36,080
that you have just opened and the clock is ticking.

985
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:37,760
Yeah, you have to drink it.

986
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:40,840
If you drink it a few days later, it will be cooking wine.

987
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:44,920
Three days, three days. Yeah, I'm getting I was just excited.

988
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,880
We didn't really talk about it, but Jason and I just did the most

989
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,320
anxiety inducing law.

990
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:52,760
There's a thing called hang time at Knott's Berry Farm

991
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:56,360
that takes you up like that rip ride rocket 90 degrees.

992
00:46:56,360 --> 00:47:00,240
And then it just dangles you off the top for like

993
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:04,080
what feels like five minutes, probably 25 seconds.

994
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:07,640
Yeah. But you're just hanging there on the top.

995
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:12,320
And I've never if I was a kid, maybe I would have like started crying.

996
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:16,280
But I've never been that anxious in my adult years going on a ride as I was

997
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:20,400
like clinging to the front as we're ascending 90 degrees.

998
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:23,640
And I'm just laughing like I'm just laughing because Mike's

999
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:26,400
just sitting there going, oh, my goodness. Oh, my goodness.

1000
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:28,560
Well, then we got we get that.

1001
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:30,200
You said goodness.

1002
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:32,840
He was saying good. No memory of it.

1003
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:33,800
No memory.

1004
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:36,040
Yeah. You're the sweet.

1005
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:38,480
You're the most good boy in your profanity.

1006
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:41,240
If my mom is listening to this right now, she went, that's nice.

1007
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:43,920
She's very happy about it.

1008
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:46,960
You yell, I think when we got stopped, we did the stall at the top.

1009
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:50,680
You just yelled, oh, my God, it's taking so long.

1010
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:52,080
You just started yelling.

1011
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:56,160
I didn't know. I didn't realize like it just yeah, it does feel like an eternity

1012
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:59,800
up there anyway. So like the it's a dream at the launch.

1013
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:02,600
I'm sorry. They get it over with.

1014
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:06,480
Well, we later that night, right before we walked to our cars, we rode

1015
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:08,840
I think it's called Ghost Rider. Yeah, yeah.

1016
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:12,680
And it's not it just looks like a smaller wooden roller coaster.

1017
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:14,680
It's practically in the parking lot.

1018
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:16,520
And I never gave it much mind.

1019
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:17,400
And we got on it.

1020
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:20,880
And it is one of the most intense things I've ever ride.

1021
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:22,800
It is I would put it up.

1022
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:24,600
I wouldn't do it again. I did it one time.

1023
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:25,320
I'll do it again.

1024
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:27,400
But like it does like scare the shit out of me.

1025
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:31,120
I had to just hold on to my glasses at a certain point because I was worried

1026
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:34,360
there was just a wooden roller coaster, but they redid it.

1027
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:35,920
And it's just so intense.

1028
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:37,440
It doesn't appear with a hole.

1029
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:39,280
It's like a logical story.

1030
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:40,640
But it's so loud.

1031
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:43,600
Wooden coasters are scary in two ways because like

1032
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:45,760
the ride is scary.

1033
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:48,520
And then you're also just never sure if it's going to be the last one

1034
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:50,600
that they ever do. Like, yeah.

1035
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:53,800
The whole piece just snaps off.

1036
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:57,240
Do you have an ideal type of coaster or coaster?

1037
00:48:57,240 --> 00:49:00,240
Or is it a coaster guide?

1038
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:03,400
Yes, I am a big coaster fan.

1039
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:08,480
Although this is like an unexpected thing, I am finding that

1040
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:16,160
my past two theme park experiences were usually, you know, I go to Universal a lot,

1041
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:19,720
went to Disneyland for the first time this year.

1042
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:22,640
I grew up going to Disney World,

1043
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:25,760
but, you know, went to Six Flags a lot, liked coasters,

1044
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:29,760
loved them as a kid and would just do them over and over again all day.

1045
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:35,040
But like this last experience going to Six Flags in Massachusetts,

1046
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:40,240
I we did this get the line pass and I bit off

1047
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,040
like more than I could chew.

1048
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:46,440
It was like my like 35 year old stomach, like couldn't handle it

1049
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:48,560
because it was fun in the moment.

1050
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:53,320
And then like I had I had horrible anxiety for like the rest of the night.

1051
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:57,360
We were back home and like we went to dinner and stuff like that.

1052
00:49:57,360 --> 00:49:59,880
And like I just like my heart rate was jacked.

1053
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:03,280
And like, it's like I can't do that many roller coasters in a day anymore.

1054
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:05,440
It was also like I think it was because it was skipped the line.

1055
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:08,640
So we did everything and then did a couple of things twice and stuff like that.

1056
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:12,040
Yeah. But yeah, it was it was intense.

1057
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:13,720
Six Flags kind of fucked me up.

1058
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:16,920
I believe it was it more your stomach now more than your head?

1059
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:20,160
Because I just find like a little my head is a little bit my head too.

1060
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:23,640
Yeah, yeah. It was like it's just kind of a dizziness that like didn't go away.

1061
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:26,240
Yeah. When we weren't riding the rides anymore.

1062
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:28,560
Yeah, it was.

1063
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:30,560
I think I think I'm going to be more of like

1064
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:35,840
I'll go stick with like a more of theme rides and dark rides and stuff like that.

1065
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:37,880
Yeah. Nothing wrong with that.

1066
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:40,560
Nothing to be ashamed of.

1067
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:45,680
Is it sort of like were you ever was there a peak age really for any of you?

1068
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:49,480
Was there like, well, and that was a time where nothing bad ever happened to me.

1069
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:50,800
And I think bad.

1070
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:54,600
Or you mean just like the physical toll where you it's like I could do

1071
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:57,640
I could ride roller coasters the entire day, do everything five times.

1072
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:02,240
The problem with that, I think, is that I'm at my bravest

1073
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:04,920
when it comes to rides right now. Yeah, yeah, me too.

1074
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:07,200
Yeah. So I didn't.

1075
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:09,160
It's a look as a journey, you know, with podcasts.

1076
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:11,040
We all on a journey, really.

1077
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:12,400
That's where we started it.

1078
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:16,160
So, yeah, I don't physically I'm trying to remember like

1079
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:20,920
because like I've last or I guess this year I went on the Guardian six times in a row.

1080
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:26,080
And by the sixth time, I was a little bit woozy, but I still held up OK.

1081
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:30,800
Do you got do you prefer Guardians to a Tower of Terror?

1082
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:32,800
Did you guys go to Tower of Terror?

1083
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:37,120
We've taught we talked a little bit about it's tough because the theming of

1084
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:42,360
long story short, the the Florida one is better.

1085
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:45,360
Than all of them in a lot of ways, because it is a really cool

1086
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:47,160
fourth dimension room, which moves forward.

1087
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:50,760
And that's like very unexpected for that elevator to go that way.

1088
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:54,800
Yeah, I remember that because I was part of Tower of Terror as well.

1089
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:57,560
Yeah. Yeah. And that's not in the California one.

1090
00:51:57,560 --> 00:51:59,680
Not in California or I never had that.

1091
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:03,480
I always get I get annoyed when a ride is not the same in two places.

1092
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:05,320
Like one of the other

1093
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:09,840
areas that I pitched to Scott was talking about the mummy ride,

1094
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:13,760
because the one here sucks my balls and the one in Florida.

1095
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:16,680
Sure. Great. There's there's a whole leg of the ride.

1096
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:20,480
There's a false ending of the mummy returns ride in Florida

1097
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:23,600
that this one does not have. Yes. Yeah. Ceiling catches on fire.

1098
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:26,120
You see like what looks like a ride operator.

1099
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:28,680
It's a fake ride operator and they shrivel up and die and stuff.

1100
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:29,840
And it's like it's so cool.

1101
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:30,920
And that's just not.

1102
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:32,760
And also Brendan Fraser thinks you at the end of the ride.

1103
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:34,840
And that's not part of this one as well.

1104
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:36,880
And he gets does he get eaten by scarabs?

1105
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:40,440
It's implied he gets like a ghost creature.

1106
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:41,800
I don't think it's OK. It's right.

1107
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:44,880
Isn't it like a ghostly spirit?

1108
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:47,280
I was excited. Finally got his coffee.

1109
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:49,880
I like rides where people get eaten by scarabs with.

1110
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:52,240
Yeah, it's pretty limited. Yeah.

1111
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:55,280
That's what I like. I know what I like.

1112
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:58,080
That's another with that applause thing I'm saying that that's another

1113
00:52:58,080 --> 00:53:01,480
like here's there's this little like, you know, talk amongst yourselves

1114
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:03,320
or write in our comments or anything.

1115
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:06,120
But like worst ride

1116
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:10,560
ratio or what it like biggest difference,

1117
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:14,520
worst difference between rides in different places.

1118
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:15,920
And it could be mummy.

1119
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:17,960
I might have. Yeah, that's still.

1120
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:21,520
And I've like and I've gone to the park with people who haven't been on the Orlando

1121
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:22,360
and we'll ride that ride.

1122
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:23,120
That was really fun.

1123
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:25,720
I'm like, you have no idea what you're missing.

1124
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:29,000
Phil, her magic has it like really has its fan.

1125
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,920
The Florida one really has its fans.

1126
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:33,120
And found after we we talked.

1127
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:35,760
Yeah. And the theater is obviously built for in Florida.

1128
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:39,200
The Tower of Terror, though, real quick to answer the question.

1129
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:41,800
The Tokyo one is the best themed one, I think,

1130
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:43,320
even though it's missing a fourth dimension.

1131
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:45,960
But Tokyo one is a completely original story.

1132
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:48,320
And I think I like that aesthetically the best.

1133
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:50,400
The one in Florida.

1134
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:53,520
I like the Tower of Terror aesthetic better than Guardians.

1135
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:59,360
But I will say this, though, I'm used to having fun on the actual drop,

1136
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:00,560
which is what happens on Guardians.

1137
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:02,760
So you get a little fun. You get the music.

1138
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:05,800
And anytime I've been on the older, the older ones,

1139
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:08,640
I find the drops lacking. Yeah.

1140
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:10,640
So it's hard.

1141
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:13,080
The more active

1142
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:16,360
and the launch, the initial launch of Guardians.

1143
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:18,600
Yes, you like I like that.

1144
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:19,840
I did too. I like to do anything.

1145
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:21,920
You think the Guardians drop is longer?

1146
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:24,440
It is. I think it's the longest one of all of them.

1147
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:25,240
I could be wrong.

1148
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:26,600
I when I wrote it, I was like,

1149
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:28,680
didn't feel like it's as long as when it was Tower of Terror.

1150
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:29,800
But I could be totally wrong.

1151
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:31,720
It's been years since I think it's long.

1152
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:32,880
I think it's the longest one.

1153
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:33,960
Somebody probably correct me.

1154
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:38,600
Florida, Tara is partially the view is partially obscured by the letters.

1155
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:39,480
Right. Yeah.

1156
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:40,240
I'm imagining that.

1157
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:41,320
Hmm. Yeah.

1158
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:43,360
How would I think we actually let the letters of the hotel?

1159
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:44,560
Maybe. Yeah.

1160
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:47,000
I think they made that longer after a while.

1161
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:48,640
Maybe those are similar.

1162
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:50,600
The one in Tokyo is short.

1163
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:52,240
It's like closer to the original.

1164
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:55,440
But they then do a thing for a couple of months where they make it longer.

1165
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:57,640
And then the one in Paris I saw,

1166
00:54:57,640 --> 00:55:00,160
I don't I don't know when it starts or if it has started already.

1167
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:01,960
Oh, that was crazy.

1168
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:05,560
They're doing three different ride profiles for the Tower of Terror.

1169
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:08,560
And I wonder if they're doing it seems like they might be.

1170
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:11,720
I wonder if they're sort of doing a type of Guardians show

1171
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:13,960
only like Twilight Zone related.

1172
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:17,400
So maybe you do go on down and you see stuff open up

1173
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:20,520
while you're going up and down, which is cool.

1174
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:23,120
And like would plus that right up everywhere.

1175
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:25,560
And then you get to keep the cool aesthetic of the towers.

1176
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:26,760
I wonder.

1177
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:28,520
Did you feel it with your first Disneyland visit?

1178
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:31,600
Did you feel a lot of like better in Florida, better in Florida,

1179
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:34,680
like like growing up there?

1180
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:37,800
I I really enjoyed Disneyland.

1181
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:40,440
I don't know how the sizes of the parks compare,

1182
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:44,680
but there was a lot of stuff in like California Adventure that I really liked.

1183
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:46,160
And there was stuff that, you know, wouldn't have been there

1184
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:48,000
when I was a kid that was here at this.

1185
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:51,800
Like I liked the Radiator Springs, which was interesting

1186
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:56,320
because I don't care for the Cars movies, but I think that's a really fun land.

1187
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:59,320
Yeah. That ride is really well executed, I think.

1188
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:01,800
Yeah. And that might be the create.

1189
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:06,120
That might be the biggest sort of gap between people, adults,

1190
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:08,560
maybe liking a movie. Yeah.

1191
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:13,800
And everyone loving the ride is the best cars thing that Pixar has ever made.

1192
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,200
It's better. It's better than the films.

1193
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:17,040
It is a rare.

1194
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:20,200
That's an interesting category, too, like where the ride is better than

1195
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:22,840
all of the in the multiple films.

1196
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:26,000
I guess I kind of feel that way about and I'm jumping around so much.

1197
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,920
But I do. I kind of feel that way about Transformers as well.

1198
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:31,120
I enjoy that ride more than the movies.

1199
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:33,760
That maybe should have just been a ride.

1200
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:37,760
Like it probably didn't need to be a five movie franchise.

1201
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:42,000
As Marty Scorsese says, Theme Park, he's talking about these movies

1202
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,280
that have a lot of effects.

1203
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:46,440
And Transformers is honestly even a better example than the Marvel movies.

1204
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:50,440
Because Transformers is literally just metal smashing against each other.

1205
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:53,080
Like every movie is mostly that maybe not Bumblebee.

1206
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:54,080
I haven't seen it.

1207
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:56,320
But it is like such an aggressive thing.

1208
00:56:56,320 --> 00:57:00,560
You may as well just be along for the ride like you are on the ride.

1209
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:04,840
Yeah. Can I bring up a Hulk related thing?

1210
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:06,920
Because we're recording this a little bit early.

1211
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:08,480
We're doing this in December, we can say.

1212
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:10,560
And this is going to be out, I think.

1213
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:13,400
I could be wrong, but I think we're putting this out beyond the time,

1214
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:16,160
which by this point, the Oscar nominations will be out.

1215
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:20,720
And Mark Ruffalo certainly definitely will be nominated

1216
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:23,360
for best supporting actor for for the whole.

1217
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:27,680
Yeah, as we know, because they are Marvel or Disney is nominating

1218
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:31,280
13 Avengers for Academy Awards. Is that true?

1219
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:32,640
They are. Yes.

1220
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:36,320
There's four year consideration campaigns for 13 of the Avengers.

1221
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:36,920
Which one?

1222
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:39,120
There's the whole list is somewhere.

1223
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:40,520
I mean, for sure.

1224
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:44,560
I mean, I got the screener and it's Robert Downey Jr. on the cover.

1225
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:48,640
The cover of the screener looks like a like an indie drama that costs like.

1226
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:51,760
Yeah. You think it's a movie about slavery or something.

1227
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:53,920
Yeah, it's real. They change the font.

1228
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:56,040
Yeah, it is definitely not like Avengers.

1229
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:59,560
It's Avengers. I'm really surprised that this is the one.

1230
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:01,520
I mean, like, you know,

1231
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:03,760
I think all these movies do pretty well with critics and stuff like that.

1232
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:07,560
But like, I'm surprised that Infinity War wasn't the one they push more

1233
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:10,720
because that was more that was more the Empire Strikes Back

1234
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:13,320
and kind of like ends on a real downer.

1235
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:16,160
The boldest story decision made maybe.

1236
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:18,080
And then this is just wrapping it all up.

1237
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:20,720
But it's a way to honor all of their careers for.

1238
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:24,480
So go ahead and read who are now there's at some point a cap.

1239
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:29,280
There's only 10 slots, but certainly 10 of the slots are filled by some of these.

1240
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:31,880
Well, there's a is 1313.

1241
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:36,320
13. Yeah. Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth,

1242
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:38,640
Jeremy Renner, Josh Brolin.

1243
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:40,240
We know Renner is one of them.

1244
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:42,040
All right. And they're

1245
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:44,840
congratulations by now we can say congratulations, Jeremy.

1246
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:46,760
What will you be wearing if he doesn't win?

1247
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:49,120
He's going to kill himself and his wife.

1248
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:52,480
That was something that I didn't.

1249
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:53,920
He didn't just invent it.

1250
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:56,520
Google it.

1251
00:58:56,520 --> 00:59:00,680
So please, Academy and don't really doesn't have a name.

1252
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:03,840
Oh, oh, oh, oh, boy.

1253
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:08,480
Did they go straight that haven't don't have a song renters in on New Ghostbusters

1254
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:11,320
song and oh my God, why didn't I include him before?

1255
00:59:11,560 --> 00:59:14,440
Uh, did I say I said Cheetal course?

1256
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:18,320
Scarlett Johansson, Gwyneth Paltrow, Paltrow, Pepperpots will be nominated.

1257
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:20,960
You remember that she was in a movie.

1258
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:21,920
I think that's cute.

1259
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:25,400
Honestly, I like her not knowing she was in the movie, but she's barely in the movie.

1260
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:26,000
Yeah.

1261
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:31,800
Um, I and I think there's no question that Karen Gillen will be nominated as Nebula.

1262
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:33,720
Nebula is not. She's in the list.

1263
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:36,080
I forgot that movie was this year.

1264
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:40,120
I forgot I saw that in Larson who disappears from the movie.

1265
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:43,320
She starts in the movie and then they go, oh, she's got to go somewhere else.

1266
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:47,120
And then she's really whole movie pieces out for the entire second act.

1267
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:48,560
And she shows.

1268
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:49,920
Yeah, she shows up at the end.

1269
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:51,200
Everything's OK.

1270
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:52,360
Everything's good now.

1271
00:59:52,360 --> 00:59:54,960
She doesn't flinch when Thor's hammer goes by.

1272
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:59,160
Sure. Behind closed doors, Hollywood still incredibly sexist and racist.

1273
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:03,040
But she didn't flinch when Thor's hammer went by.

1274
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:04,920
Problem solved.

1275
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:06,760
We fixed her. Yes. Sexism is gone now.

1276
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:08,160
If they do the hammer there.

1277
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:11,880
I think maybe Mr. Rogers sneaks in there.

1278
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:15,600
Maybe Tom Inks, but the rest, I think we're talking.

1279
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:17,960
I think it's Renner V Downey V.

1280
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:24,880
Can you write in votes when you're like, I think you can write for Oscars nomination?

1281
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,360
I think so. Who?

1282
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:29,160
Because I honestly I'm not satisfied with this list.

1283
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:33,440
I think we should give a different Avenger an Academy Award.

1284
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:36,320
Well, they kind of did Tom Holland dirty, right?

1285
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:38,040
He was on that list. Yeah, you're right.

1286
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:39,680
Oh, he just shows up at the end, I guess.

1287
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:41,360
Yeah, but he's still nominated.

1288
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:44,120
So if you should be all Cumberbatch on there.

1289
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:45,720
No, Cumberbatchy again.

1290
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:47,160
We don't spoil his friend game.

1291
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:49,280
He shows up at the end because he was snapped out of there.

1292
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:52,240
Let's see, though, who could rock could should rock it?

1293
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:56,280
When our favorite theme park character rocket, Bradley Cooper,

1294
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:59,640
should he be her favorite James Cagney impersonator? Yeah.

1295
01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:03,440
Rocket shows up at the end.

1296
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:05,880
You know, he's going to you might have trouble getting into the event.

1297
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:07,800
Yeah, I wonder why.

1298
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:11,680
I wonder why he wouldn't be able to get in Oscars famously.

1299
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:14,760
Yeah, he's a hand scanning system.

1300
01:01:15,720 --> 01:01:19,200
And he's got to go up in the gantry lift at the Kodak Theater.

1301
01:01:19,240 --> 01:01:22,800
Busted into the Zebra Academy Awards.

1302
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:27,120
How now if that there's all these articles about who should host

1303
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:29,760
Rock. Oh, my goodness.

1304
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:31,640
He brought it and Deadpool together.

1305
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:33,120
Oh, yeah.

1306
01:01:33,120 --> 01:01:35,240
Let's just do it. Let's nominate Deadpool.

1307
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:41,160
And for the first year, and see 17 rating on the Oscars.

1308
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:44,800
Yeah. Oh, man, they would be Razzan Nicholson.

1309
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:47,280
Maybe if he's there, I guess he hasn't been there in like a decade.

1310
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:51,640
If he was there front row, Jack, your hand scan, Jack.

1311
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:56,200
And then like, he just puts him up my hand scan like they're doing a bit.

1312
01:01:56,440 --> 01:01:58,240
That's great, honestly.

1313
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:02,160
And then like, but seriously, folks, there's a lot of epidemic problems

1314
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:04,920
in Hollywood and the way women have been treated.

1315
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:09,880
It's not good. And when we're going to turn to Groot for more.

1316
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:16,200
Well, there is a nice detail, but I'm going to let Groot take this one.

1317
01:02:16,360 --> 01:02:19,320
Great. Unfortunately, back down because of old tweets.

1318
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:25,600
Excited to announce this year's host, Groot.

1319
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:29,160
All the tweets say I am Groot, but they mean really racist.

1320
01:02:29,240 --> 01:02:32,440
They mean, my God, look at this.

1321
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:34,680
I am Groot from 2012.

1322
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:36,080
You son of a bitch.

1323
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:39,720
Wow. So this is going to be an all Avengers Oscar year.

1324
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,120
Interesting. So much fun.

1325
01:02:42,120 --> 01:02:43,440
I mean, it would be fun.

1326
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:45,200
Yeah, I don't even like I don't even know.

1327
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:46,560
I've never heard the name Nebula.

1328
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:47,800
I don't know these movies at all.

1329
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:51,200
Nebula is Thanos' daughter. Oh, well, that's OK.

1330
01:02:51,240 --> 01:02:53,320
Well, no wonder they nominated her. Yeah. Yeah.

1331
01:02:53,480 --> 01:02:55,720
That's a tough role to play.

1332
01:02:55,720 --> 01:02:58,640
Anyway, let's get back to the ride.

1333
01:02:58,640 --> 01:03:00,400
Yeah, you get nominated.

1334
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:02,800
You yeah, you're asking about favorite coasters.

1335
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:04,080
I think the Hulk is up there for me.

1336
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:06,480
I think the original iteration of it

1337
01:03:07,040 --> 01:03:12,560
was like really maybe like my top five or top three or something like that.

1338
01:03:12,560 --> 01:03:13,800
I really love that.

1339
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:15,400
Do you guys think it was a teen?

1340
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:17,600
Yeah, yeah, we

1341
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:20,040
there were like several years in a row where my family just

1342
01:03:20,040 --> 01:03:24,080
we would go to to Universal Studios and I think we tended

1343
01:03:24,080 --> 01:03:26,360
to be more of a Universal family than a Disney one.

1344
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,200
I think maybe like the rides better.

1345
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:32,680
We went a lot in high school because it was just nice to stay at a hotel,

1346
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:35,040
stay at the Hard Rock and walk over to the parks.

1347
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:36,840
Yeah, we just got into that.

1348
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:40,040
That I have a very specific memory of like going a month

1349
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:44,720
before I started college and like there was like had the express pass.

1350
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:46,840
So walked right on the Hulk a bunch of times.

1351
01:03:46,840 --> 01:03:49,160
And I'm like, yeah, this year is going to be awesome.

1352
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:53,160
Don't be afraid. Yeah.

1353
01:03:54,120 --> 01:03:56,360
Well, I mean, that's it.

1354
01:03:56,360 --> 01:03:58,360
That's my best.

1355
01:03:58,360 --> 01:04:00,120
Hopefully it'll work this time.

1356
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:03,480
Hopefully it'll work this time.

1357
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:07,200
I wonder if you guys felt this way.

1358
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:10,880
I'd like I bet you guys go in there a little more often

1359
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:14,560
in closer to when ends of adventure open.

1360
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:18,240
I think like this this structure, though I didn't go on this ride.

1361
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:23,200
It rising up on the skyline, I think was very exciting.

1362
01:04:24,080 --> 01:04:29,360
It like I think it really announced a new universal and edgier universal

1363
01:04:29,360 --> 01:04:32,120
that we're going to do scary or riskier stuff.

1364
01:04:32,120 --> 01:04:36,120
And islands of adventure, it says it's going to maybe better rides

1365
01:04:36,120 --> 01:04:38,840
and scarier rides than what than what Disney's doing.

1366
01:04:39,360 --> 01:04:44,840
And like to have a big super like inversion kind of coaster.

1367
01:04:45,120 --> 01:04:46,760
Not not inverted. It's not inverted coaster.

1368
01:04:46,760 --> 01:04:50,120
But like there's a ton of loops and everything right at the entrance

1369
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:52,840
of this park. It's just like really bold.

1370
01:04:53,120 --> 01:04:55,720
Yeah, I remember when I was adventure was opening.

1371
01:04:55,720 --> 01:04:59,280
It was it was really exciting because, yeah, the up until that point,

1372
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:02,720
Universal was mostly like, oh, the Jaws ride and so it was it was rides

1373
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:05,360
that I also really like, but rides that are more about recreating

1374
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:08,320
the experience of being in these movies and stuff like that.

1375
01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:10,640
It was earthquake ride and stuff like that.

1376
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:12,920
Twister, which we all love, man.

1377
01:05:12,920 --> 01:05:15,920
RIP love that. Yeah, love that twister experience.

1378
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:20,320
Stage five. But yeah.

1379
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:24,840
But when I was a venture was it was it was much more of a push for like,

1380
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:28,880
especially I think superhero island in particular is like

1381
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:32,880
it really has like, you know, a lot of good like thrill rides right there.

1382
01:05:33,360 --> 01:05:35,560
The Doctor Doom drop and stuff like that.

1383
01:05:35,560 --> 01:05:40,360
And I kind of I also like I, you know, I grew up reading comics and stuff.

1384
01:05:40,360 --> 01:05:45,640
So it was really exciting for me to like see all that stuff

1385
01:05:45,640 --> 01:05:47,360
and see that it kind of style.

1386
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:50,240
It's very much like styled like the comic books.

1387
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:53,280
It's not like, you know, obviously it predates the MCU and all that stuff.

1388
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:58,200
But like it's very comic booky, like even the the the kind of parts

1389
01:05:58,200 --> 01:06:00,680
of the city itself and stuff that you see, everything is.

1390
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:05,360
Yeah. And and the Spider-Man ride being like one of the first rides.

1391
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:07,800
I like that. That kind of ride is copied so much now.

1392
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:10,560
And that I remember that being like the first one. Yeah.

1393
01:06:10,560 --> 01:06:14,520
And that was they spent I mean, this island was the immediate hit

1394
01:06:14,520 --> 01:06:16,760
because of Hulk and Spider-Man. Yeah.

1395
01:06:16,760 --> 01:06:20,480
And they spent so much money developing the technology for Spider-Man.

1396
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:24,720
They spent a lot of money developing like they universal creative.

1397
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:27,320
And I think it's MTS systems.

1398
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:32,720
They developed the launch for this like other rides had been launched before.

1399
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:36,240
But this was like the first time using this kind of launch system,

1400
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:40,760
like literally rigging up a dune buggy on a track

1401
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,680
at a bunch of boxcars connected together.

1402
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:46,480
And like there's footage, there's behind the scenes footage of them

1403
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:49,240
like testing out like, does this work?

1404
01:06:49,240 --> 01:06:53,840
Like and then on top of that, again, they spent something like

1405
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:56,840
30 million to 50 million on this ride alone

1406
01:06:57,040 --> 01:07:00,480
because then they had to build a power generator.

1407
01:07:01,120 --> 01:07:04,520
They had to build a specific power drawing device

1408
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:08,040
because if it draw it on the local power supply,

1409
01:07:08,040 --> 01:07:12,040
it could brown out the surrounding area every time it launched.

1410
01:07:12,440 --> 01:07:14,080
It uses that much.

1411
01:07:14,080 --> 01:07:16,920
It's got its own like energy center, its own energy source,

1412
01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:19,000
which is so marveling. Yeah.

1413
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:22,920
Big reactors. It looks like create a whole.

1414
01:07:22,920 --> 01:07:25,960
It doesn't look as fun as the stuff inside that's fake,

1415
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:27,800
but it's because I saw a picture of it.

1416
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:30,800
Yeah, but it does look pretty neat.

1417
01:07:31,040 --> 01:07:32,440
Oh, it's cool. It's cool.

1418
01:07:32,440 --> 01:07:35,920
You're saying it's not like cool, like lights and atoms flying around

1419
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:37,480
because unfortunately nothing actually looks like that.

1420
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:41,560
But like a plot could be a supervillain

1421
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:47,240
stealing the Hulk generator and using it to power a nuclear weapon or something.

1422
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:48,440
Yes. Yeah.

1423
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:51,200
From the roller coaster, you're saying? Yes. Yeah. Yes.

1424
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:55,120
So you think Dr. Doom or the Abomination is going to steal

1425
01:07:55,120 --> 01:07:58,200
the universal Orlando Hulk power source.

1426
01:07:58,200 --> 01:08:00,040
It's some world where the real Dr.

1427
01:08:00,040 --> 01:08:03,360
Doom is in the same world as the park,

1428
01:08:03,960 --> 01:08:06,840
the fake rides of based on him and his friends.

1429
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:10,160
Right. And they revamp it again in a couple of years and redo the story again.

1430
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:12,200
Yes. Yeah, that's it.

1431
01:08:12,200 --> 01:08:14,440
Yeah. Yeah.

1432
01:08:14,440 --> 01:08:19,080
It's about saving the power grid of the ride that you're on.

1433
01:08:19,320 --> 01:08:22,480
Yeah. And there should be like a like they have to throw up

1434
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:24,560
like a dummy on each ride with Dr.

1435
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:28,520
Doom holding the power grid and you hit him and you like take him out.

1436
01:08:28,520 --> 01:08:30,480
Oh, so you just shoot it.

1437
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:32,840
A dummy gets shot into the water every two minutes.

1438
01:08:34,040 --> 01:08:36,040
It's just loading.

1439
01:08:36,040 --> 01:08:37,040
I would like more.

1440
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:37,920
That would be fun.

1441
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:41,440
Coasters do and more blood and murdering people.

1442
01:08:41,440 --> 01:08:44,760
It was just like the prestige ending in the bottom of the lake.

1443
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:45,920
It's just so many Dr.

1444
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:48,560
Doom dummies.

1445
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:51,560
An open grave of Dr.

1446
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:54,000
somebody's job at the end of each day is to just like

1447
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,360
dredge out the dummy, dredge all the Dr.

1448
01:08:56,360 --> 01:08:59,120
Doom dummies and dry them out.

1449
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:00,480
Let's be in one of the tunnels.

1450
01:09:00,480 --> 01:09:03,760
They like put like then now it's oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1451
01:09:03,760 --> 01:09:06,200
Hmm. We're plusing it up already.

1452
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:07,640
Yeah, yeah.

1453
01:09:07,640 --> 01:09:08,960
They spend so much money.

1454
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:11,160
I mean, mother is the necessity of invention.

1455
01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:18,200
Dr. Doom's fearful is like an off the rack, like launch tower drop thing.

1456
01:09:18,520 --> 01:09:22,360
So, I mean, it's it's dressed up a little and then there's tons.

1457
01:09:22,360 --> 01:09:28,120
It's got a very cool like line and and videos and stuff inside,

1458
01:09:28,120 --> 01:09:30,440
but pretty much an off the rack kind of ride.

1459
01:09:30,440 --> 01:09:34,800
Yeah, because they spent all of their budget on these two massive rides.

1460
01:09:35,280 --> 01:09:37,520
Yeah. And they're still they're cloning this.

1461
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:40,320
We're they're cloning this for Universal Studios.

1462
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:43,880
Hey, right. And it's going to be transformers, though.

1463
01:09:43,880 --> 01:09:44,600
I was reading about that.

1464
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:46,960
I saw that they were cloning it and I was like, oh, interesting.

1465
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:50,600
I wonder if they're going to hold on to the the Marvel license or whatever.

1466
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:54,400
Because the Marvel license is for America east of the Mississippi River.

1467
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:56,080
Oh, specific.

1468
01:09:56,080 --> 01:10:00,920
Maybe Japan and Japan because they have Spider-Man there. Right.

1469
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:02,280
Oh, yeah.

1470
01:10:02,280 --> 01:10:05,640
Do you guys know what the future holds for Super Island?

1471
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:07,280
Are they going to be able to keep interesting?

1472
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:09,880
Well, every few years, there's rumors.

1473
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:14,720
Honestly, I think it's one of the most interesting sources of conflict

1474
01:10:14,720 --> 01:10:18,920
in the park, where it keeps it a little weird and a little interesting.

1475
01:10:19,200 --> 01:10:24,120
This piece of 1990s Marvel and Marvel 1999 is bankrupt,

1476
01:10:24,200 --> 01:10:27,240
is going through bankruptcy proceedings and

1477
01:10:28,360 --> 01:10:30,400
so that it's stuck in that period.

1478
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:35,120
But Universal is obligated to keep it up and running and looking nice

1479
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:37,280
where the contract is invalid.

1480
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:38,880
Like it's such an odd.

1481
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:39,840
Certainly. Yeah.

1482
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:44,600
The characters have to be represented in that to not to be off limits

1483
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:46,080
for Disney in Florida.

1484
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:48,200
So like there's a whole thing with like they could.

1485
01:10:48,440 --> 01:10:53,640
There's maybe like Black Panther is barely represented in the Islands of Adventure.

1486
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:57,240
So maybe they can use them, but legally they have to like still

1487
01:10:57,320 --> 01:11:01,000
like go through contracts because they had to list out all the characters

1488
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:02,680
in the original contracts, supposedly.

1489
01:11:02,680 --> 01:11:06,720
Even though there's like a Murdoch Murdoch and Nelson law offices.

1490
01:11:07,160 --> 01:11:09,160
So Daredevils off the table.

1491
01:11:09,160 --> 01:11:10,440
Right. Just for one side.

1492
01:11:10,440 --> 01:11:13,600
But since Guardians weren't that popular and it was a different version of the team,

1493
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:15,480
that's why they can use them in Florida.

1494
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:18,640
Yeah. But there's every every year or two there's like, oh, Disney.

1495
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:22,800
Their lawyers are talking to talk about like a trade, like an Al Michaels style

1496
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:26,560
trade where they Disney traded Al Michaels or did they trade for Al?

1497
01:11:26,680 --> 01:11:27,800
You know what I'm talking about?

1498
01:11:27,800 --> 01:11:29,720
With Oswald? Yeah, for Oswald. Right.

1499
01:11:29,720 --> 01:11:34,720
There was a big trade between Warner Brothers and Universal might have owned

1500
01:11:34,720 --> 01:11:37,640
Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, and they made some weird trade for

1501
01:11:38,240 --> 01:11:40,280
sports broadcaster Al Michaels.

1502
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:42,520
I've never heard of.

1503
01:11:42,520 --> 01:11:45,440
So like somehow, somehow.

1504
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:50,960
Yeah, a deal was made where they want they always wanted the rights back to Oswald

1505
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:55,320
the Lucky Rabbit, the other early Walt of Iwerks character

1506
01:11:55,640 --> 01:12:00,680
that had been tied up for decades and decades, which they still haven't

1507
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:04,080
done anything with a little bit, but not a ton.

1508
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:07,480
He's in that he's in a video game, but like not a little bit.

1509
01:12:07,480 --> 01:12:10,000
That was all how could that all have been important enough?

1510
01:12:10,280 --> 01:12:11,960
Right. And then but they yeah.

1511
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:16,200
They traded Al Michaels for some like he had traded like he's on a sports team.

1512
01:12:16,240 --> 01:12:20,040
I mean, if he makes money, I have to remember exactly the details.

1513
01:12:20,200 --> 01:12:23,160
But I but there's been talk of like, oh, well, you know, there's things now

1514
01:12:23,160 --> 01:12:26,520
that Universal wants at Disney because now Simpsons is Disney, too.

1515
01:12:26,840 --> 01:12:28,440
And they're in Universal.

1516
01:12:28,440 --> 01:12:32,680
And there's got to be some quid pro quo that they could do.

1517
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:36,600
So and then there's also we hear rumors every time we've brought this up

1518
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:37,920
a couple of times.

1519
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:40,920
There's a rumor that Jim Hill's talked about multiple times.

1520
01:12:40,920 --> 01:12:46,840
Jim Hill theme park podcasts are about the whole and getting a wicked overlay

1521
01:12:47,160 --> 01:12:51,000
and this ride specifically getting a wicked witch overlay.

1522
01:12:51,040 --> 01:12:52,600
Wicked the musical.

1523
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:53,240
Broadway musical.

1524
01:12:53,240 --> 01:12:54,040
The Broadway musical.

1525
01:12:54,040 --> 01:12:56,120
Because you're like a wicked island.

1526
01:12:56,120 --> 01:12:58,560
A wicked, wicked, wicked island.

1527
01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:00,760
They just put a wicked coat of paint.

1528
01:13:01,160 --> 01:13:06,000
Which is like some culture war shit like that is like a Fox News guy was like,

1529
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,120
well, Captain America's out of here.

1530
01:13:08,280 --> 01:13:11,320
And here come the Broadway New York actor.

1531
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:13,840
Here comes the Broadway performers.

1532
01:13:14,280 --> 01:13:15,680
He said it a couple of times.

1533
01:13:15,680 --> 01:13:16,800
It seems insane.

1534
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:19,920
I mean, it seems like I'm not accusing him of making it up or anything.

1535
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:22,160
It just sounds so absurd.

1536
01:13:22,160 --> 01:13:23,480
I mean, Universal does own that.

1537
01:13:23,480 --> 01:13:25,440
And I do expect they're going to try to make a big movie.

1538
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:26,960
The rings, too.

1539
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:27,880
That was a big rumor.

1540
01:13:27,880 --> 01:13:30,080
Yeah, but it was something like that.

1541
01:13:30,080 --> 01:13:33,320
I mean, I would it would suck to lose Super Island

1542
01:13:33,320 --> 01:13:35,480
just because I have like so many fond memories of it.

1543
01:13:35,480 --> 01:13:39,760
But if you had to really the only ride that would be super affected is Spider-Man,

1544
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:40,920
because you just can't do that.

1545
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:42,360
And I think that's the thing.

1546
01:13:42,360 --> 01:13:47,120
Spider-Man is still such a well reviewed by guests attraction.

1547
01:13:47,640 --> 01:13:52,120
And also the thing is, Universal probably wants to keep Disney,

1548
01:13:52,120 --> 01:13:57,200
Florida from having a big shiny land devoted to the most popular movies

1549
01:13:57,200 --> 01:13:58,560
right now on the planet.

1550
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:03,160
Like there's probably a there's an incentive for them to keep it away.

1551
01:14:03,480 --> 01:14:07,120
It makes more sense for them not to have Disney open this crazy thing

1552
01:14:07,120 --> 01:14:08,720
that everybody wants to go to in Florida.

1553
01:14:08,720 --> 01:14:10,200
He said it's east of the Mississippi, right?

1554
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:12,440
So is that why they can do Guardians here?

1555
01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:15,160
Yeah, and they're doing a whole land next summer.

1556
01:14:15,160 --> 01:14:16,720
So they can do they can do everything here.

1557
01:14:16,720 --> 01:14:17,800
Yeah, but they can't.

1558
01:14:17,800 --> 01:14:19,000
They don't really use Marvel.

1559
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:20,640
But they were right.

1560
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:24,480
But they can't use Marvel, the word Marvel for some weird reason.

1561
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:27,360
So that's why, like when they did a summer of superheroes last year,

1562
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:30,720
it was called the summer of heroes and not like Marvel summer.

1563
01:14:31,120 --> 01:14:33,960
That's that's especially crazy because Marvel,

1564
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:38,440
the official title for every one of those, the MCU movies is Marvel's blank.

1565
01:14:38,440 --> 01:14:40,200
And all their TV shows is Marvel's blank.

1566
01:14:40,200 --> 01:14:42,600
They love. Yes, the branding at all. Yeah. Yes.

1567
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:46,840
But it's so especially with all these companies merging and things absorbing,

1568
01:14:46,840 --> 01:14:52,960
I think there's this is probably still one of the most tangled legal things

1569
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:55,960
that they have a stake in Hulk.

1570
01:14:55,960 --> 01:14:58,320
That's one of the reasons why they have trouble getting.

1571
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:00,520
Yes. Solo movies off the ground.

1572
01:15:00,520 --> 01:15:03,800
So for some reason, there's a weird legal wrangling that you can't.

1573
01:15:04,160 --> 01:15:07,960
Marvel can't make a solo, a solo Hulk movie.

1574
01:15:07,960 --> 01:15:11,800
They would have to do the deal like what they did with Sony for Spider-Man. Right.

1575
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:13,880
But they can put Hulk in whatever they want.

1576
01:15:14,520 --> 01:15:16,760
If he's in something else, he's in something else. Yeah.

1577
01:15:17,160 --> 01:15:20,120
But you can even make like Wolverine versus Hulk,

1578
01:15:20,120 --> 01:15:22,840
which is a rumor I've seen thrown around like that's fine.

1579
01:15:23,120 --> 01:15:27,120
You can't just make like the incredible Hulk unless they make a deal with Universal.

1580
01:15:27,160 --> 01:15:29,680
I don't understand anything about that or why that is.

1581
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:31,840
But it's very confusing.

1582
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:34,880
Thank God we got that one movie to introduce

1583
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:39,280
General Thaddeus Thunderbolt Ross into the MCU beloved character.

1584
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:42,040
Still love to see him pop up. He's going to be in Black Widow.

1585
01:15:42,040 --> 01:15:43,720
He was in Black Widow, D-Aged.

1586
01:15:43,720 --> 01:15:46,560
The trailer came out last night.

1587
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:48,520
Yeah. Sorry.

1588
01:15:48,520 --> 01:15:51,760
Which which of the live action films is General Thaddeus in?

1589
01:15:52,040 --> 01:15:54,040
He's the Ed Norton Hulk. Yeah.

1590
01:15:54,080 --> 01:15:56,200
And he's William Hurt.

1591
01:15:56,360 --> 01:15:59,120
He's really the only he's really the only

1592
01:15:59,680 --> 01:16:03,760
connection that that movie kind of has to the current movies.

1593
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:08,200
And I mean, like, I think vaguely, I think Mark Ruffalo says

1594
01:16:08,200 --> 01:16:11,360
in the first Avengers movie says like, oh, I broke Harlem,

1595
01:16:11,960 --> 01:16:14,760
which is a reference to like the ending fight at the end of The Incredible Hulk.

1596
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:17,880
Oh, yeah. But it's really kind of like the bastard stepchild of the MCU

1597
01:16:17,880 --> 01:16:20,040
is the lowest grossing one.

1598
01:16:20,040 --> 01:16:21,000
Yeah. Yeah.

1599
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:25,160
Norton not Edward Norton not brought back apparently.

1600
01:16:25,200 --> 01:16:28,160
There's a Sam Jackson cameo in it.

1601
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:29,760
Is there a Downey Jr.

1602
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:32,960
There's a down at the end of the post credits is like, is it?

1603
01:16:33,360 --> 01:16:36,720
I know it's General Thaddeus Ross and Robert Downey Jr.

1604
01:16:36,760 --> 01:16:38,840
Yeah, that's so confusing.

1605
01:16:38,840 --> 01:16:40,160
Yeah. And it's the second one.

1606
01:16:40,160 --> 01:16:41,840
It's right after Iron Man.

1607
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:45,160
So it's like they put those two first into the proper MCU.

1608
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:49,000
You know how much this old Disney thing is fucking and they've taken over my brain.

1609
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:52,280
I don't remember who put out the first Marvel movies.

1610
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:54,000
Well, you talk about the ones we're talking about.

1611
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:55,560
Put out Iron Man.

1612
01:16:55,560 --> 01:16:57,120
Paramount Paramount.

1613
01:16:57,120 --> 01:16:59,280
But Marvel was no memory of it.

1614
01:16:59,280 --> 01:17:03,000
Yeah. Marvel formed its own studio at that point with whatever characters they had left,

1615
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:04,800
which they didn't have Spider-Man or the X-Men.

1616
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:06,760
It would be a hit. It was a gamble.

1617
01:17:06,760 --> 01:17:08,120
It was a real gamble.

1618
01:17:08,120 --> 01:17:08,880
In the 90s.

1619
01:17:08,880 --> 01:17:11,480
Because in the 90s, those were the characters that a lot of places were like,

1620
01:17:11,480 --> 01:17:14,480
well, no one gives a shit about Captain America or Iron Man or Thor.

1621
01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:15,560
Like, those are the boring ones.

1622
01:17:15,560 --> 01:17:19,560
And I won't say as a kid, I was like, those are the more boring ones.

1623
01:17:19,560 --> 01:17:20,920
Yeah, I was never.

1624
01:17:20,920 --> 01:17:26,680
It took it took the movies for me to give a shit about Thor.

1625
01:17:26,680 --> 01:17:31,480
I was Thor was like, wow, he talks like a fucking Shakespeare character.

1626
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:32,520
Like, I don't know.

1627
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:37,840
Because all of the big artists were on like X-Men or for a while Spider-Man.

1628
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:38,200
Yeah.

1629
01:17:38,200 --> 01:17:42,840
Which kind of is interesting how little X-Men presence there is at Marvel Superhero Island.

1630
01:17:42,840 --> 01:17:48,400
But the more I thought about it, I think Hulk and Spider-Man are so internationally identifiable.

1631
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:49,200
Yeah.

1632
01:17:49,200 --> 01:17:50,520
As part of it.

1633
01:17:50,520 --> 01:17:51,160
Yeah, I wonder.

1634
01:17:51,160 --> 01:17:55,520
I mean, the X-Men thing is odd that there wouldn't have been a big X-Men ride.

1635
01:17:55,520 --> 01:18:00,480
I'm sure that was in the thought like planning because it just makes total sense.

1636
01:18:00,480 --> 01:18:01,720
They were the biggest thing.

1637
01:18:01,720 --> 01:18:04,400
But Spider-Man probably more internationally recognized.

1638
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:04,680
Yeah.

1639
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:06,120
And anyone can be under the mask.

1640
01:18:06,120 --> 01:18:07,280
That's a big thing.

1641
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:08,280
Always talk about that.

1642
01:18:08,280 --> 01:18:10,680
Who doesn't Disney have now?

1643
01:18:10,680 --> 01:18:11,720
I get so confused.

1644
01:18:11,720 --> 01:18:17,120
OK, so they can't make the Hulk movie because universal, but they can put Hulk in anything they want.

1645
01:18:17,120 --> 01:18:17,480
Yeah.

1646
01:18:17,480 --> 01:18:18,560
They don't own.

1647
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:19,640
He can be in Lady and the Tramp.

1648
01:18:19,640 --> 01:18:22,080
He could be in Lady and the Tramp.

1649
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:22,880
Lady and the Tramp.

1650
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:23,920
Lady and Hulk and the Tramp.

1651
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:25,240
This is the night.

1652
01:18:28,240 --> 01:18:30,280
They don't have Spider-Man.

1653
01:18:30,280 --> 01:18:34,880
Sony owns the rights to make TV shows and movies about Spider-Man.

1654
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:37,240
They're just licensing or not licensing.

1655
01:18:37,240 --> 01:18:39,000
They're just borrowing the character.

1656
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,320
And they almost read, read divorced.

1657
01:18:41,720 --> 01:18:43,000
They almost read divorce.

1658
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:44,640
They went through a little thing.

1659
01:18:44,640 --> 01:18:46,040
Yeah, that was all just posturing.

1660
01:18:46,040 --> 01:18:46,760
It feels like that.

1661
01:18:46,760 --> 01:18:50,640
Well, yeah, that's I I will say I called that immediately.

1662
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:51,640
You did call that.

1663
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:54,760
And I was like, they were going to solve this in under two months.

1664
01:18:54,760 --> 01:18:55,560
And they did.

1665
01:18:55,560 --> 01:19:00,760
I do think that's an interesting thing, too, because they're they're headed for a couple different ways.

1666
01:19:00,760 --> 01:19:03,480
I don't know if that will relationship will last forever.

1667
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:05,800
Yeah, but it's really tenuous.

1668
01:19:05,800 --> 01:19:12,720
And it's also strange because Sony is really still trying to like lean into like, oh, we're going to every Spider-Man

1669
01:19:12,720 --> 01:19:14,600
villain is going to have a movie.

1670
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:18,200
And a lot of those look like they're going to be like really bad.

1671
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:18,920
Well, yes.

1672
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:22,520
So Swiss Miss might have been cross.

1673
01:19:22,520 --> 01:19:25,600
So Sony's making long fingers grow.

1674
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:28,200
Scott, have you been taking Swiss Miss meetings and all the gala?

1675
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:31,960
So I respect NDAs.

1676
01:19:31,960 --> 01:19:34,240
We should all go in the room for that.

1677
01:19:34,240 --> 01:19:38,480
So, yes, Sony's doing its own Marvel universe, but just the Spider-Man

1678
01:19:38,480 --> 01:19:44,040
characters, Jared Leto's Michael Morbius, the vampire movie coming next year or this year,

1679
01:19:44,040 --> 01:19:44,920
depending on when this comes out.

1680
01:19:44,920 --> 01:19:47,280
Oh, fucking yeah.

1681
01:19:47,320 --> 01:19:51,640
But there's also now that we're on the topic of contracts that apparently I like,

1682
01:19:52,440 --> 01:19:57,000
there's something in the contract of if if because there's rumors that Apple wants to buy Sony.

1683
01:19:57,720 --> 01:20:01,640
So Apple buys Sony, Spider-Man reverts back to Marvel.

1684
01:20:02,040 --> 01:20:06,960
So if there's any big sale of Sony as a whole studio, Marvel will get Spider-Man back.

1685
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:10,480
I'm like having trouble even wrapping my mind around that sentence.

1686
01:20:10,480 --> 01:20:11,920
Right. It's like, yeah, I know.

1687
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:14,080
There's like too many companies in the sentence.

1688
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:18,080
Well, because Sony is also weak enough that it's like Disney could just buy them.

1689
01:20:18,640 --> 01:20:20,000
Yes, I yes.

1690
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:23,640
So Apple, who if they decide that the morning show is not

1691
01:20:23,880 --> 01:20:29,360
setting their entertainment world on fire, maybe they decide we're watching us see

1692
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:31,600
all the big all the big Apple.

1693
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:32,640
We love to see it.

1694
01:20:32,640 --> 01:20:34,760
We love to see the Apple TV Plus.

1695
01:20:35,560 --> 01:20:39,360
So if they decide that maybe, you know, let's just buy Ghostbusters or whatever.

1696
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:41,120
Like that might happen.

1697
01:20:41,120 --> 01:20:43,520
Sure. And then at that point, those

1698
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,040
they won't they will lose Spider-Man.

1699
01:20:46,040 --> 01:20:49,360
There's also reports that Marvel was just thinking about like giving Sony

1700
01:20:49,360 --> 01:20:52,000
five billion dollars to buy it back.

1701
01:20:53,040 --> 01:20:56,240
Which like they valued Spider-Man it like something.

1702
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:57,920
It might be more than that, honestly.

1703
01:20:57,920 --> 01:20:59,560
I am with I'm with you, Chase.

1704
01:20:59,560 --> 01:21:02,800
I'm like I need like this needs to be a PowerPoint.

1705
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:06,760
I need logos in front of me and I need the logos to move.

1706
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:08,600
There's so many characters.

1707
01:21:08,600 --> 01:21:11,680
I'm so I don't even as I said, I don't really watch these movies.

1708
01:21:11,880 --> 01:21:16,440
I don't know who Nebula is, but like it is like such a dense web from the Sopranos

1709
01:21:16,440 --> 01:21:19,560
with like little like pieces of red string connecting.

1710
01:21:20,240 --> 01:21:23,360
And if anyone dies, cross them off just like because take them off my blade.

1711
01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:27,480
I can't deal with those reading comics in the 90s, though, actually got me trained

1712
01:21:27,480 --> 01:21:31,680
for this type of consolidation because so many companies would spring up

1713
01:21:31,680 --> 01:21:34,960
with like VC money and go under within a year or two.

1714
01:21:35,120 --> 01:21:39,560
And then sometimes they get bought by Marvel or DC or sometimes they just fold.

1715
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:44,040
Or like Jim Lee's Wildstorm imprint, which was an image originally.

1716
01:21:44,040 --> 01:21:48,440
Yes, it's just Jim's Lee Studio image was like all these guys,

1717
01:21:48,760 --> 01:21:52,080
the guys, six studios, one company seizure.

1718
01:21:52,080 --> 01:21:54,720
He sold his studio to DC.

1719
01:21:55,320 --> 01:21:57,640
Right. He sold all those characters to DC.

1720
01:21:57,640 --> 01:22:01,000
So now Warner Brothers owns all of these characters he independently created.

1721
01:22:01,160 --> 01:22:04,840
And by the way, did you know that Cindy Krover's husband, Randy Gerber,

1722
01:22:06,040 --> 01:22:07,200
has a tequila company?

1723
01:22:07,200 --> 01:22:09,240
I don't want to go to camping world.

1724
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:13,880
So it's just, you know, there's a lot going on.

1725
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:17,960
Who owns the Casamiga's IPs?

1726
01:22:17,960 --> 01:22:18,960
What do I want to know?

1727
01:22:18,960 --> 01:22:19,480
Well, someone bought it.

1728
01:22:19,480 --> 01:22:21,000
I'll get interested in Casamiga's.

1729
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:22,280
Constellation Brahms.

1730
01:22:22,280 --> 01:22:22,960
Constellation Brahms becomes the.

1731
01:22:22,960 --> 01:22:23,960
Oh, yeah.

1732
01:22:24,680 --> 01:22:26,080
Very smooth.

1733
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:29,440
Doesn't cut up my throat like Swiss Mizz.

1734
01:22:30,240 --> 01:22:34,440
A big change in this ride occurred before the re-theming

1735
01:22:34,760 --> 01:22:37,240
that we hadn't touched on in 2011.

1736
01:22:38,040 --> 01:22:40,560
Or no, sorry, I forget.

1737
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:45,960
In 2011, there were a bunch of incidents of stuff flying out of people's pockets

1738
01:22:46,240 --> 01:22:49,480
on specifically the Dueling Dragons coaster, which is the other

1739
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:53,760
BNM coaster that opened Islands of Adventure.

1740
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:57,640
And stuff flew out of people's pockets.

1741
01:22:58,360 --> 01:23:04,240
In one case, a man lost an eye from this, like got hit by something.

1742
01:23:04,360 --> 01:23:05,840
Oh, a real eye.

1743
01:23:05,840 --> 01:23:09,440
Oh, no, a real eye, like a phone or a wallet hit him in the eye.

1744
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:10,440
Oh, yeah.

1745
01:23:12,120 --> 01:23:13,320
His origin story.

1746
01:23:13,320 --> 01:23:17,960
So Universal made the rule for at the time

1747
01:23:19,560 --> 01:23:23,640
Dragon Challenge, Hulk and the Rip Ride

1748
01:23:23,640 --> 01:23:26,040
Rocket Coasters, like nothing in your pockets.

1749
01:23:26,040 --> 01:23:29,720
And you have to go through a metal detector, specifically Hulk

1750
01:23:29,800 --> 01:23:31,080
and Rip Ride and Rocket.

1751
01:23:31,080 --> 01:23:33,200
You have to go through a metal detector.

1752
01:23:33,200 --> 01:23:35,640
So there's lockers.

1753
01:23:35,680 --> 01:23:37,680
That you can put your stuff in.

1754
01:23:37,680 --> 01:23:40,560
This was not the case for the first, like

1755
01:23:41,880 --> 01:23:45,000
12 years of operation for this ride.

1756
01:23:45,760 --> 01:23:47,280
Well, what year does it start?

1757
01:23:47,280 --> 01:23:48,840
This started.

1758
01:23:48,840 --> 01:23:50,440
I guess it's longer.

1759
01:23:50,440 --> 01:23:55,360
This started around like 20 or I think with the redo, I think with like 2015,

1760
01:23:55,360 --> 01:23:58,240
when they were redoing it, they put in all the security stuff.

1761
01:23:58,240 --> 01:24:01,240
Right. I would ride with shit in my pockets all the time.

1762
01:24:01,280 --> 01:24:03,160
The whole coaster,

1763
01:24:03,160 --> 01:24:06,200
especially in the height of the popularity of cargo pockets.

1764
01:24:06,320 --> 01:24:09,840
It was very easy to just Velcro your stuff in an exterior pocket

1765
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:14,240
because I wanted to see the Q videos with my glasses.

1766
01:24:14,240 --> 01:24:16,200
I'm blind as a bat without glasses.

1767
01:24:16,200 --> 01:24:17,440
So you were what?

1768
01:24:17,440 --> 01:24:20,800
Sorry. I was going to say, I feel like in a lot of cases, like the lap bar

1769
01:24:20,800 --> 01:24:24,080
or whatever, I can't remember if this if it comes down over you

1770
01:24:24,080 --> 01:24:24,920
or if there's a lap bar.

1771
01:24:24,920 --> 01:24:29,280
But a lot of times the lap bar can do a good job of holding stuff in,

1772
01:24:29,280 --> 01:24:32,720
especially if it's like a big like, you know, rubber or plastic one or whatever.

1773
01:24:32,760 --> 01:24:33,840
That kind of covers everything.

1774
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:35,520
Sure. Yeah.

1775
01:24:35,520 --> 01:24:38,320
This is shoulder restraints that are then buckled in.

1776
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:39,760
So the restraints fail.

1777
01:24:39,760 --> 01:24:40,560
The buckles catch it.

1778
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:44,600
And like the sitting down aspect with that restraint does seem like

1779
01:24:44,600 --> 01:24:45,920
that shouldn't be much of a problem.

1780
01:24:45,920 --> 01:24:47,760
But obviously it happened a few times.

1781
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:49,360
So they don't want to chance it.

1782
01:24:49,360 --> 01:24:52,600
I get it with like the standing coasters and the day your legs dangling.

1783
01:24:52,600 --> 01:24:55,840
And then like with the one I went to at Six Flags.

1784
01:24:55,840 --> 01:24:56,760
What's that one called?

1785
01:24:56,760 --> 01:24:59,120
I always forget the one I went out with Anthony Geo.

1786
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:00,880
Oh, X2.

1787
01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:01,840
Crotch crusher.

1788
01:25:01,840 --> 01:25:05,240
Crotch crusher, which happened again, by the way, on the hang time.

1789
01:25:05,240 --> 01:25:06,320
Like his penis got crushed.

1790
01:25:06,320 --> 01:25:07,960
Yes. I said, I think I turned.

1791
01:25:07,960 --> 01:25:08,520
What did I say?

1792
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:12,960
I think the employee came by, pushed the thing on my crotch

1793
01:25:13,160 --> 01:25:15,720
and just shoved my penis into my body.

1794
01:25:15,720 --> 01:25:18,160
And I go, oh, my God, it happened again.

1795
01:25:18,160 --> 01:25:19,920
And I was trying to.

1796
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:22,560
I think it happened at Ghost Rider, too.

1797
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:25,120
And you're like, it's not as bad, but it happened again.

1798
01:25:26,120 --> 01:25:27,640
So I get it.

1799
01:25:27,640 --> 01:25:30,880
I get it why on the other ones you don't want that to happen

1800
01:25:30,880 --> 01:25:32,160
or something that's extra crazy.

1801
01:25:32,160 --> 01:25:34,880
But this one does seem like it's not that big of a deal.

1802
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:36,200
But obviously, what do I know?

1803
01:25:36,200 --> 01:25:38,520
I mean, it sucks the guy lost his eye.

1804
01:25:38,520 --> 01:25:39,160
Yeah.

1805
01:25:39,160 --> 01:25:42,520
And now his story is someone asked him like, what happened?

1806
01:25:42,520 --> 01:25:43,920
He's like, fucking Hulk, man.

1807
01:25:43,920 --> 01:25:45,480
Yeah.

1808
01:25:45,480 --> 01:25:46,320
The machine.

1809
01:25:46,320 --> 01:25:49,040
It didn't.

1810
01:25:49,040 --> 01:25:50,520
Wait, what's the line?

1811
01:25:50,520 --> 01:25:52,120
It didn't work out.

1812
01:25:52,280 --> 01:25:55,840
Oh, I think it's this time it's going to work.

1813
01:25:56,840 --> 01:25:58,680
The glasses thing, I didn't.

1814
01:25:58,680 --> 01:25:58,960
Yeah.

1815
01:25:58,960 --> 01:26:00,720
Now I remember you had to put your glasses away.

1816
01:26:00,720 --> 01:26:01,520
I put my glasses away.

1817
01:26:01,520 --> 01:26:02,600
We had to walk a lot.

1818
01:26:02,600 --> 01:26:05,960
And we were like, you have to guide me because I.

1819
01:26:05,960 --> 01:26:08,080
Magoota, because it's so dark.

1820
01:26:08,080 --> 01:26:10,240
The queue got darker, too.

1821
01:26:10,240 --> 01:26:13,200
And they're not great at chaining off or directing.

1822
01:26:13,200 --> 01:26:15,360
They're not as good at directing you where to go.

1823
01:26:15,360 --> 01:26:19,880
So everyone in this line is vision impaired, like forcibly.

1824
01:26:20,360 --> 01:26:22,400
Well, that's what I was realizing, because like.

1825
01:26:22,400 --> 01:26:24,560
I don't know if as many people as me are as.

1826
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:25,800
Or as. Yeah.

1827
01:26:25,800 --> 01:26:29,480
So do you keep them on during like, like Harry Potter and stuff like that?

1828
01:26:29,480 --> 01:26:31,760
Yeah. OK. More for that. Yeah.

1829
01:26:31,760 --> 01:26:34,640
Even some I've gone on like even some.

1830
01:26:34,640 --> 01:26:37,160
I think I've kept them on for like California Scream.

1831
01:26:37,160 --> 01:26:38,520
And I usually take them off.

1832
01:26:38,520 --> 01:26:41,080
But my dad used to keep his on all the time.

1833
01:26:41,080 --> 01:26:42,840
And we I don't know.

1834
01:26:42,840 --> 01:26:45,560
I wear plastic frames now, so they're a little looser

1835
01:26:46,600 --> 01:26:48,320
than like tighter metal ones.

1836
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:53,160
But yeah, I mean, so for so for the Hulk, when the first version of it,

1837
01:26:53,160 --> 01:26:56,680
I used to like to walk through the queue and watch the videos and stuff.

1838
01:26:56,680 --> 01:26:59,480
And then I put the glasses in a case, put it in my pocket.

1839
01:26:59,480 --> 01:27:04,640
And yeah, it's a big they have to have like a glasses case on the right.

1840
01:27:04,640 --> 01:27:07,280
And they have to put like a little there has to be some like that.

1841
01:27:07,400 --> 01:27:09,440
That is a kind of an oversight, honestly.

1842
01:27:09,440 --> 01:27:12,880
Not building people should be like maybe like a pouch in front of every seat

1843
01:27:12,880 --> 01:27:16,480
or something like that, like, yeah, that you can that seals, you know.

1844
01:27:16,520 --> 01:27:18,520
So it's not going to like nothing's going to happen to it.

1845
01:27:18,520 --> 01:27:19,320
Yeah. Yeah.

1846
01:27:19,320 --> 01:27:22,120
There's a lot of a lack of that on all like at a certain point,

1847
01:27:22,120 --> 01:27:24,280
Universal was like, nope, lockers everywhere.

1848
01:27:24,280 --> 01:27:27,200
I think the lawsuits probably cost them a fortune.

1849
01:27:27,640 --> 01:27:30,600
Yeah, maybe getting hit by stuff because then they also had to change

1850
01:27:30,600 --> 01:27:33,880
like Dueling Dragons whole thing was the coasters launched at the same time

1851
01:27:33,880 --> 01:27:35,280
and they go in and out.

1852
01:27:35,280 --> 01:27:37,320
And that's why people got hit by stuff.

1853
01:27:37,560 --> 01:27:40,960
But like there's no lockers on rock and roller coaster.

1854
01:27:41,680 --> 01:27:43,920
There's no there are or not.

1855
01:27:43,920 --> 01:27:45,600
Sorry, not you're right. No, not right.

1856
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:48,920
Yeah. And there's no California Screamin lockers. Right.

1857
01:27:49,080 --> 01:27:51,840
And there's not as many coasters, obviously, in Disney World or land.

1858
01:27:51,840 --> 01:27:56,200
But if you put if you have glasses on the ride,

1859
01:27:56,200 --> 01:27:58,400
then aren't the glasses going to halt out?

1860
01:27:58,400 --> 01:28:00,560
Mm hmm. You're going to break.

1861
01:28:00,560 --> 01:28:02,120
Yeah. Well, they'll just burst.

1862
01:28:02,120 --> 01:28:04,800
All right. You're not going to I just pictured like, you know, oh, giant.

1863
01:28:05,080 --> 01:28:06,960
Yeah. Yeah. Big mostly.

1864
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:10,440
That is a great point is glasses are often illustrated as breaking,

1865
01:28:10,440 --> 01:28:12,920
whereas his pants stay mostly together.

1866
01:28:13,600 --> 01:28:15,400
Yeah. Well, they're made selectively.

1867
01:28:15,400 --> 01:28:17,080
They're made using unstable molecule.

1868
01:28:17,080 --> 01:28:21,320
Reed Richards is invention unstable molecules, which we all know about.

1869
01:28:21,800 --> 01:28:24,320
There is a mention meaning that they can stretch.

1870
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:26,360
Oh, oh, that's why he can wear pants.

1871
01:28:26,360 --> 01:28:29,000
They just yeah, they explain it away because the fantastic four like Reed

1872
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:30,440
Richards, he stretches.

1873
01:28:30,440 --> 01:28:33,760
So his costume has to be able to stretch.

1874
01:28:33,760 --> 01:28:37,040
So we made something called unstable molecules for him and the family.

1875
01:28:37,160 --> 01:28:39,440
And then Hulk's purple ripped pants.

1876
01:28:39,760 --> 01:28:41,040
So frayed at the bottom.

1877
01:28:41,040 --> 01:28:43,200
They still rest of those. They just cover your penis.

1878
01:28:43,360 --> 01:28:46,520
Yeah. He made it so like the there was like a cool like

1879
01:28:46,520 --> 01:28:49,080
and there was a ripped pattern in the below it.

1880
01:28:49,080 --> 01:28:51,320
It was all stable molecules.

1881
01:28:51,680 --> 01:28:54,920
So those would rip out because it looked yeah, because it looked cool.

1882
01:28:54,920 --> 01:28:57,640
Yeah. Then you look like a pirate in a play or something. Yeah.

1883
01:28:58,520 --> 01:29:00,120
Yeah. Reed was interested in that.

1884
01:29:00,120 --> 01:29:04,680
But he didn't want to do like one giant Hulk ball hanging out.

1885
01:29:04,920 --> 01:29:07,320
No, no massive.

1886
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:08,960
Just what?

1887
01:29:08,960 --> 01:29:10,400
Yeah, that's what I like.

1888
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:12,760
Well, not the full penis, but just one ball.

1889
01:29:12,920 --> 01:29:15,080
To where you'd be looking up at it like, what's that?

1890
01:29:15,080 --> 01:29:17,800
Oh, oh, oh, no.

1891
01:29:19,560 --> 01:29:21,080
You distract his enemies.

1892
01:29:21,080 --> 01:29:22,280
Oh, yeah.

1893
01:29:22,280 --> 01:29:23,600
Yeah. You'd look down, huh?

1894
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:25,920
Oh, he punches you in the face. Yeah.

1895
01:29:26,720 --> 01:29:31,960
I think I may have a possible answer for why on like those two Disney coasters.

1896
01:29:32,760 --> 01:29:35,280
I think they go slower because Hulk,

1897
01:29:35,640 --> 01:29:38,440
well, it launches you up to 40 miles per hour at top speeds.

1898
01:29:38,440 --> 01:29:40,880
You reach 67 miles an hour.

1899
01:29:41,240 --> 01:29:44,400
And I think the Disney ones might scream.

1900
01:29:44,400 --> 01:29:48,080
Those are 40 scream and launch 60 or no, is it 40?

1901
01:29:48,520 --> 01:29:51,240
I thought Rock and Rollercoaster is like 50 something.

1902
01:29:51,280 --> 01:29:53,800
Am I wrong? That one might launch quick.

1903
01:29:53,800 --> 01:29:56,360
But maybe it's just the way that the cars are.

1904
01:29:56,360 --> 01:29:58,680
What are somebody will answer this is Rock and Rollercoaster

1905
01:29:58,680 --> 01:29:59,960
and rip ride rocket.

1906
01:29:59,960 --> 01:30:01,200
Two different. Yes.

1907
01:30:01,200 --> 01:30:02,800
Yes. They sure are.

1908
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:04,280
I always get them mixed up.

1909
01:30:04,280 --> 01:30:06,360
One is one Aerosmith. Yeah.

1910
01:30:06,360 --> 01:30:08,800
How are you roller coaster is Aerosmith.

1911
01:30:09,040 --> 01:30:12,640
Yes. So one gives you a choice between like six different songs.

1912
01:30:12,640 --> 01:30:14,800
The other one's like, no, it's Aerosmith.

1913
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:17,520
One gives you six different Aerosmith songs.

1914
01:30:17,520 --> 01:30:18,720
Yeah. Yeah.

1915
01:30:19,720 --> 01:30:22,160
Theme park specific Aerosmith songs.

1916
01:30:24,160 --> 01:30:26,080
Yeah. Just singing about haunted mansion.

1917
01:30:27,800 --> 01:30:29,840
Oh, Aerosmith covers of all of the.

1918
01:30:29,840 --> 01:30:31,400
Yeah. Oh, man, that would be great.

1919
01:30:31,400 --> 01:30:33,200
Mm hmm. Yeah.

1920
01:30:33,200 --> 01:30:35,720
So I don't know. Well, somebody will answer that question.

1921
01:30:36,520 --> 01:30:38,360
You know what's I think an interesting little effect about the Hulk?

1922
01:30:39,240 --> 01:30:44,360
I think also correct me if I'm wrong in this, but I think first universal launch.

1923
01:30:45,080 --> 01:30:46,200
It would have to be. Yes.

1924
01:30:46,200 --> 01:30:49,120
And I think the first launch in Orlando.

1925
01:30:50,200 --> 01:30:54,040
Oh, because because Rock and Roller not quite open.

1926
01:30:54,840 --> 01:30:56,360
A little bit later. A little bit later.

1927
01:30:56,360 --> 01:30:57,240
Yep. Yeah. I don't know.

1928
01:30:57,240 --> 01:30:58,680
I'd have to see, but you might be right.

1929
01:30:58,680 --> 01:31:04,000
Really? I that that tracks, I think, because I definitely remember writing that one before.

1930
01:31:04,800 --> 01:31:06,480
I don't think I wrote.

1931
01:31:06,480 --> 01:31:08,160
It's the same year, though.

1932
01:31:08,160 --> 01:31:09,200
Right. Yeah. Yeah.

1933
01:31:09,200 --> 01:31:13,920
Yeah. We did their first launch for this man for BNM, the manufacturer of this coaster.

1934
01:31:13,920 --> 01:31:17,040
Then they didn't build another launching coaster until what is it?

1935
01:31:17,320 --> 01:31:18,480
It's called Thunderbird.

1936
01:31:18,480 --> 01:31:19,840
It's that holiday world.

1937
01:31:19,840 --> 01:31:26,480
That is the holiday themed park in the Midwest where soda is free.

1938
01:31:28,040 --> 01:31:30,680
That's you guys know, the most Midwestern thing I've ever heard.

1939
01:31:31,320 --> 01:31:32,280
Holy shit. It. Wait.

1940
01:31:32,280 --> 01:31:34,480
So is it different holidays or is it all?

1941
01:31:34,480 --> 01:31:37,560
It's like Christmas land, Halloween land.

1942
01:31:37,800 --> 01:31:39,960
So it's all these different lands and one of their big selling.

1943
01:31:39,960 --> 01:31:43,320
They have a few great marketing techniques.

1944
01:31:43,320 --> 01:31:45,720
One, it's in Santa Claus, Indiana.

1945
01:31:47,120 --> 01:31:49,200
Two, parking is free.

1946
01:31:49,200 --> 01:31:51,360
Three, soft drinks are free.

1947
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:53,560
Well, found drinks are free.

1948
01:31:53,560 --> 01:31:56,160
It is Pepsi and just plant its dancing fountains.

1949
01:31:56,160 --> 01:32:01,280
You can just walk up to any just just like walk up to a fan, just fill your cup up.

1950
01:32:01,400 --> 01:32:07,400
I will say the the time when I went to Six Flags in Massachusetts earlier,

1951
01:32:07,760 --> 01:32:11,520
this year, and I think honestly, like when I'm at Universal,

1952
01:32:11,520 --> 01:32:16,400
I see more people drinking huge sodas than anywhere else in my entire life.

1953
01:32:17,120 --> 01:32:18,840
Yeah, sure. Yeah.

1954
01:32:18,840 --> 01:32:23,680
Because because yeah, in the hey, in the in the showbiz city,

1955
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:26,720
some people aren't like doing gallons.

1956
01:32:26,720 --> 01:32:30,520
But yeah, particularly at Six Flags, there was some kind of like

1957
01:32:30,520 --> 01:32:32,120
it was free refills or something like that.

1958
01:32:32,120 --> 01:32:33,320
So people were just walking.

1959
01:32:33,320 --> 01:32:36,200
People were lugging these from ride to ride.

1960
01:32:36,360 --> 01:32:38,800
That's what they you know, instead of their like valuables or whatever,

1961
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:40,640
they were putting like a huge Dr.

1962
01:32:40,640 --> 01:32:43,640
Pepper in the thing and like getting him and they get off the ride.

1963
01:32:43,640 --> 01:32:46,600
To wash out the taste of Panda Express Express

1964
01:32:47,560 --> 01:32:48,960
limited menu.

1965
01:32:48,960 --> 01:32:52,120
Panda Express down made with less care.

1966
01:32:52,280 --> 01:32:56,200
Well, now imagine the kind like the rollercoaster days that are challenging for you,

1967
01:32:56,200 --> 01:32:59,960
but add like more soda than you'd know in a year.

1968
01:33:01,440 --> 01:33:02,520
It would have been bad.

1969
01:33:02,520 --> 01:33:04,280
Geez. Yeah, you do it.

1970
01:33:04,400 --> 01:33:09,240
That's probably why I would like hit my limit as a child for going on coasters.

1971
01:33:09,240 --> 01:33:10,320
It wasn't wear and tear.

1972
01:33:10,320 --> 01:33:15,520
I was just terribly dehydrated from only drinking soda. Yeah. Yeah.

1973
01:33:15,520 --> 01:33:19,040
There was also some that were just like deceptively nauseating.

1974
01:33:19,040 --> 01:33:23,240
Like there was one that looked like it looked like almost like a kiddie coaster

1975
01:33:23,240 --> 01:33:25,720
or something. But I don't know if you guys have talked about this type of coaster

1976
01:33:25,720 --> 01:33:29,880
before. I feel like I've only seen them a few times, but the ones that are like

1977
01:33:30,680 --> 01:33:34,880
instead of having like, you know, being inverted or doing a lot of loops

1978
01:33:34,880 --> 01:33:38,360
or something like that, like it's kind of like a cart on a track sort of.

1979
01:33:38,560 --> 01:33:41,200
And a lot of it is like taking hard turns.

1980
01:33:41,320 --> 01:33:43,240
That's like wild mouse.

1981
01:33:43,240 --> 01:33:45,560
Wow. Just came up. Yeah.

1982
01:33:45,560 --> 01:33:48,800
We're talking about this with Danny and like how the how goofy

1983
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:52,320
Sky School we avoid and yeah. Yeah.

1984
01:33:53,200 --> 01:33:57,320
It's a surprisingly tough little.

1985
01:33:57,360 --> 01:33:58,040
And there was another one.

1986
01:33:58,040 --> 01:34:00,200
I don't think this was the same one, but there was another one that

1987
01:34:02,120 --> 01:34:05,000
you spun as you were on the track.

1988
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:09,120
So it was like doing a rollercoaster, doing a teacups and the rollercoaster

1989
01:34:09,120 --> 01:34:10,400
at the same time. Wow.

1990
01:34:10,400 --> 01:34:12,480
Which you're looking at and going, well, this is for kids.

1991
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:13,560
Right. And you're on it.

1992
01:34:13,560 --> 01:34:16,200
And I really I had to we were on it.

1993
01:34:16,960 --> 01:34:18,400
It was me and someone else.

1994
01:34:18,400 --> 01:34:22,320
And then we were there with like a little girl and she kept wanting to like

1995
01:34:22,320 --> 01:34:25,520
spend the thing. I had to be like, I can't do this anymore.

1996
01:34:25,880 --> 01:34:27,760
Stop this.

1997
01:34:29,040 --> 01:34:31,760
My insides are 35.

1998
01:34:32,640 --> 01:34:35,640
Please just go on it again with someone else who can handle this.

1999
01:34:36,960 --> 01:34:39,960
Yeah, I know we maybe need to like

2000
01:34:39,960 --> 01:34:42,240
we got to examine the wild mouse

2001
01:34:42,240 --> 01:34:47,720
for law and figure out maybe like scientifically, why is it so deceptively freaky?

2002
01:34:47,800 --> 01:34:51,720
The I think the feeling of like I am going to go over the edge.

2003
01:34:51,720 --> 01:34:54,680
That's not how it's very like psychological.

2004
01:34:54,680 --> 01:34:56,960
It's very like Temple of Doom, mine, Carti, like it.

2005
01:34:56,960 --> 01:35:00,840
Yeah. Even though you know that you're attached, like it really feels like the

2006
01:35:01,160 --> 01:35:03,600
inertia is going to like drop you off the side.

2007
01:35:03,960 --> 01:35:04,880
Yeah. Yeah.

2008
01:35:04,880 --> 01:35:08,760
And any any time heights are involved, speed

2009
01:35:09,560 --> 01:35:11,800
just makes my brain forget about the height.

2010
01:35:12,280 --> 01:35:14,760
Like that's what I like with the launch or anything.

2011
01:35:14,760 --> 01:35:17,720
It's like speed is what's tricking me into

2012
01:35:18,360 --> 01:35:21,720
not caring as much that I'm very high up.

2013
01:35:22,120 --> 01:35:22,560
Right.

2014
01:35:22,560 --> 01:35:26,160
So it's like the wild mouse coaster that's not nearly as high up as a giant

2015
01:35:26,160 --> 01:35:29,640
roller coaster, much scarier than the other one.

2016
01:35:29,640 --> 01:35:31,160
And often you can see everything.

2017
01:35:31,160 --> 01:35:32,320
Yes. In the dark.

2018
01:35:32,320 --> 01:35:35,520
Yeah, I mean, that's part of Hulk is so imposing.

2019
01:35:35,520 --> 01:35:39,680
I mean, it's it's tallest point is 150 feet above the ground.

2020
01:35:39,680 --> 01:35:42,760
And also a lot of it goes over water.

2021
01:35:42,760 --> 01:35:45,680
So like there's an unnerving feel,

2022
01:35:45,680 --> 01:35:50,080
but there is a lot of psychological stuff with when they did the revamp.

2023
01:35:50,080 --> 01:35:53,040
Did they did they add any track?

2024
01:35:53,040 --> 01:35:54,160
Did they make it longer at all?

2025
01:35:54,160 --> 01:35:58,240
Because I was just seeing on on YouTube, there was there's a

2026
01:35:58,600 --> 01:36:01,840
ride through that was pre the revamp.

2027
01:36:02,040 --> 01:36:03,520
And it's like a minute and a half long.

2028
01:36:03,520 --> 01:36:05,760
And then there's and I don't I didn't watch the whole thing.

2029
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:08,080
So I don't know if they skip some in the middle or something like that.

2030
01:36:08,080 --> 01:36:12,040
But then the all the more recent ones are like like three and a half minutes

2031
01:36:12,040 --> 01:36:14,120
or four minutes long, which is weird.

2032
01:36:14,120 --> 01:36:17,000
That is weird. Yeah, I don't think no, they it's not longer.

2033
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:20,640
I wonder if it's just they're more in show or inappropriate show.

2034
01:36:20,640 --> 01:36:21,760
I don't know. Yeah, maybe.

2035
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:25,000
Maybe there was more of like the build up to, you know. Yeah.

2036
01:36:25,040 --> 01:36:28,680
It's strange that they they replaced the track, but didn't do anything different.

2037
01:36:28,680 --> 01:36:32,040
I think people were people just so like addicted to that design.

2038
01:36:32,040 --> 01:36:33,480
Yeah, yeah, maybe.

2039
01:36:33,480 --> 01:36:37,120
I mean, it's very well reviewed, like it won a lot of awards,

2040
01:36:37,120 --> 01:36:39,160
very well reviewed by audiences.

2041
01:36:39,160 --> 01:36:43,880
It's I but from what I understand, it's very hard to add track to coasters

2042
01:36:43,880 --> 01:36:47,800
that exist because it's like it's a it's a math equation of how much

2043
01:36:48,400 --> 01:36:52,000
like energy you build up and how much you can sustain. Oh, sure.

2044
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,480
So it's like Tony Baxter was talking about Big Thunder Mountain.

2045
01:36:54,480 --> 01:36:57,280
He's always been disappointed by the last in Disneyland,

2046
01:36:57,280 --> 01:37:01,080
specifically the last like the third like exciting part,

2047
01:37:01,280 --> 01:37:03,280
because it's not as fast as the rest of it.

2048
01:37:03,280 --> 01:37:05,440
And he was like, well, there wasn't enough like track.

2049
01:37:05,440 --> 01:37:07,480
There wasn't enough room to do it. Yeah.

2050
01:37:07,520 --> 01:37:10,160
So it's all like a weird math thing that you never really think about.

2051
01:37:10,440 --> 01:37:14,360
So I think it would be like hard, very hard to extend it.

2052
01:37:14,720 --> 01:37:17,200
I would think if you were going to like change something on it,

2053
01:37:17,520 --> 01:37:21,640
you would want like a like a Hulk style yeti like on Everest,

2054
01:37:22,440 --> 01:37:26,440
like pounding at you somewhere. Yeah.

2055
01:37:26,480 --> 01:37:27,760
There's a tunnel.

2056
01:37:27,760 --> 01:37:29,880
You go through a tunnel. Yeah, right. Yes.

2057
01:37:29,880 --> 01:37:32,040
You get a hole in there, but you go so fast.

2058
01:37:32,040 --> 01:37:33,280
It does seem. Yeah, it does.

2059
01:37:33,280 --> 01:37:36,640
Because like like I was saying earlier with the credit coaster, they've they

2060
01:37:37,320 --> 01:37:42,000
have like every member of the Incredibles family, like somewhere along the things.

2061
01:37:42,920 --> 01:37:46,120
And there like kind of is a story to that one where you're like looking,

2062
01:37:46,200 --> 01:37:48,760
you're helping them look for Jack Jack or something like that. Yeah.

2063
01:37:48,920 --> 01:37:52,560
And it would be kind of cool if they added like a couple of hulks along the way

2064
01:37:52,560 --> 01:37:57,400
or something. Sure. Hulkling, a little Hulk, babies, babies, baby.

2065
01:37:58,240 --> 01:38:02,040
Like like little Shrek, like little baby Shrek's. Yeah, I

2066
01:38:02,640 --> 01:38:06,080
it's like I was trying to think of like what the most successful

2067
01:38:06,080 --> 01:38:09,000
coaster that has like characters are theming on.

2068
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:11,360
And I guess is it Everest?

2069
01:38:11,360 --> 01:38:13,240
Is that like because Everest is a giant.

2070
01:38:13,240 --> 01:38:14,840
It doesn't work. The animatronic doesn't work.

2071
01:38:14,840 --> 01:38:17,760
But when it did, it was incredible. Hagrid's now.

2072
01:38:18,360 --> 01:38:21,640
Yeah, I guess Hagrid's is probably a new standard for it.

2073
01:38:21,680 --> 01:38:26,040
So, yeah, it's like you'd probably it'd probably be too hard to do it

2074
01:38:26,080 --> 01:38:28,200
as elaborately as Hagrid's.

2075
01:38:28,200 --> 01:38:31,160
This is the new this is the motorbike one. Yeah. Yeah.

2076
01:38:31,440 --> 01:38:33,160
Which is really good.

2077
01:38:33,160 --> 01:38:35,720
Oh, really? OK, cool. It's something. Yeah. Yeah.

2078
01:38:36,200 --> 01:38:36,920
It was a sneaker.

2079
01:38:36,920 --> 01:38:39,480
Flight of the hippogriff sucks out.

2080
01:38:39,480 --> 01:38:40,520
Yeah, certainly. Yes.

2081
01:38:40,520 --> 01:38:43,880
That's another quickie fix of like that's a standard like. Yeah.

2082
01:38:44,040 --> 01:38:45,280
Yeah. No, it's right.

2083
01:38:45,280 --> 01:38:47,120
They go. Oh, right. Yeah.

2084
01:38:47,120 --> 01:38:49,640
It's no it's yeah, it's it's no that.

2085
01:38:49,960 --> 01:38:51,320
That's yeah.

2086
01:38:51,320 --> 01:38:54,040
So it's like and you can't put it under like a building

2087
01:38:54,600 --> 01:38:58,760
because I will say skyline wise, it's fantastic.

2088
01:38:58,880 --> 01:39:01,440
Like when you're when you're sitting on that porch of Margaritaville

2089
01:39:01,520 --> 01:39:04,720
at City Walk and you see it, it's really nice.

2090
01:39:05,040 --> 01:39:07,480
It's a real nice picture right there.

2091
01:39:07,880 --> 01:39:10,480
And like it would ruin the skyline to put a building over it.

2092
01:39:10,760 --> 01:39:12,360
Yeah, because that's the front of the park.

2093
01:39:12,360 --> 01:39:17,120
Well, let's you know, here, while we're plusing it up and Hulk plus ups

2094
01:39:17,240 --> 01:39:18,440
certainly are a lot.

2095
01:39:18,440 --> 01:39:21,640
But here's I to go back to the Marvel superhero island thing.

2096
01:39:21,960 --> 01:39:25,920
I was thinking legitimately, OK, the deal the deal got made.

2097
01:39:25,920 --> 01:39:29,480
We got to pull out of the Marvel is out of Universal.

2098
01:39:29,640 --> 01:39:30,720
Have to fix it.

2099
01:39:30,720 --> 01:39:34,480
They're not going to take this coaster out like that because you can re theme it.

2100
01:39:34,720 --> 01:39:36,080
What do you do?

2101
01:39:36,080 --> 01:39:39,600
Well, are we do it's probably you have to decide what the whole land is,

2102
01:39:39,600 --> 01:39:41,520
I would assume, because it's got to be a whole land.

2103
01:39:41,520 --> 01:39:43,520
I think so. I think the others could follow.

2104
01:39:43,520 --> 01:39:47,960
Certainly you could you could amend what is like the mean the drop tower.

2105
01:39:47,960 --> 01:39:50,680
But we've talked about it, I think, before.

2106
01:39:50,680 --> 01:39:54,360
But it's like, is it is it just Shrek land?

2107
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:58,840
Oh, that would be you barely got that out.

2108
01:39:59,840 --> 01:40:01,720
You know, the answer is not.

2109
01:40:01,720 --> 01:40:04,240
I'm saying it's like you hit the brake platform.

2110
01:40:04,240 --> 01:40:06,200
What universal character is riding?

2111
01:40:06,200 --> 01:40:07,760
I'm trying to think practically here.

2112
01:40:07,760 --> 01:40:10,800
Oh, Grinch paint the Grinch coaster.

2113
01:40:10,800 --> 01:40:14,520
OK, well, I mean, there's rumors of a Grinch coaster for years.

2114
01:40:14,520 --> 01:40:16,720
But there's a loose land over the land.

2115
01:40:16,720 --> 01:40:17,480
But you don't want that much.

2116
01:40:17,480 --> 01:40:19,120
So yeah, yeah.

2117
01:40:19,120 --> 01:40:22,720
To soothe the rides are kind of intense for for it.

2118
01:40:23,200 --> 01:40:24,840
Yeah, yeah, to be Grinch.

2119
01:40:24,840 --> 01:40:26,840
Yes. Yes, potentially. Yes.

2120
01:40:26,840 --> 01:40:30,720
The ride is how you're it's how you feel inside when he insults you,

2121
01:40:30,720 --> 01:40:34,000
like on his famous snarky billboards. Oh.

2122
01:40:34,480 --> 01:40:37,880
Aliens like a Nostromo evacuation.

2123
01:40:37,880 --> 01:40:39,080
Oh, shit.

2124
01:40:39,080 --> 01:40:41,720
Disney has. Oh, man.

2125
01:40:41,720 --> 01:40:44,680
I guess I could see it, even though the rides in that section of the park

2126
01:40:44,680 --> 01:40:48,440
are pretty intense, if it was like illumination land or something like that.

2127
01:40:48,440 --> 01:40:52,360
So you got minions and you got then you have the Grinch.

2128
01:40:52,400 --> 01:40:54,680
Yeah. Whatever else they've made.

2129
01:40:54,680 --> 01:40:58,160
Well, we got to see your life of pets coming bizarrely post the

2130
01:40:59,200 --> 01:41:01,240
movie kind of bombing.

2131
01:41:01,240 --> 01:41:03,320
Oh, what about Valley?

2132
01:41:03,320 --> 01:41:04,680
It's a back to the future.

2133
01:41:04,680 --> 01:41:06,680
It's a big delorium. OK. Yeah.

2134
01:41:06,680 --> 01:41:08,000
What about that?

2135
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,680
That's good. But what about mad about you?

2136
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:12,840
What about about you, Coaster?

2137
01:41:12,840 --> 01:41:16,720
Original. You have to be a spectrum customer to enter that.

2138
01:41:16,760 --> 01:41:20,000
Yes. Enter your enter your parents.

2139
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:24,800
Log in. Well, and grace your parents back to you are at a Comcast Park,

2140
01:41:24,800 --> 01:41:27,440
but enter your parents back to Jimmy.

2141
01:41:27,480 --> 01:41:28,640
I mean, Jimmy Fallon is a ride.

2142
01:41:28,640 --> 01:41:31,080
What are their famous and the Today Show Cafe now?

2143
01:41:31,080 --> 01:41:32,800
Oh, my God. This is us.

2144
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:35,320
Crockpot explosion.

2145
01:41:35,360 --> 01:41:38,000
Oh, so it's like an accident in the kitchen accident.

2146
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:39,480
Yes. Yes, that's good.

2147
01:41:39,480 --> 01:41:42,400
And then somebody dies because that happens on every episode.

2148
01:41:42,400 --> 01:41:44,400
I've been under Crockpot.

2149
01:41:44,400 --> 01:41:46,000
I don't watch the shows. Crockpot explosion.

2150
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:49,800
Apparently, one season, a character died because a Crockpot exploded.

2151
01:41:49,800 --> 01:41:53,640
And then Crockpot had to come out and go, our products do not explode.

2152
01:41:53,640 --> 01:41:56,480
You're thinking of pressure cookers.

2153
01:41:56,480 --> 01:41:58,440
Good for them. But yeah, OK.

2154
01:41:58,560 --> 01:42:03,040
You're like now the tube is like it's a cylindrical kitchen.

2155
01:42:03,080 --> 01:42:09,040
Yes. And Crockpot explodes and launches you on the on on a journey to death.

2156
01:42:09,120 --> 01:42:10,640
Yes. That's good.

2157
01:42:10,640 --> 01:42:13,720
Always heard rumors about like, I mean, this is the thing.

2158
01:42:13,720 --> 01:42:17,160
Why what you were saying, like, yeah, it was strange they made a TV show a ride.

2159
01:42:17,160 --> 01:42:22,040
Like movies kind of hang around the popular consciousness much longer,

2160
01:42:22,040 --> 01:42:24,880
even though they're so much shorter than TV shows.

2161
01:42:24,960 --> 01:42:31,240
And I feel like I remember in the early 2000s, like theme park rumors like,

2162
01:42:31,240 --> 01:42:34,440
well, heroes, everyone was curious.

2163
01:42:34,440 --> 01:42:36,440
They got to get heroes in the park.

2164
01:42:36,440 --> 01:42:38,440
Imagine if they were stuck with that.

2165
01:42:38,440 --> 01:42:40,040
They were stuck with Siler.

2166
01:42:40,040 --> 01:42:42,040
You have to save the cheerleader and save the world.

2167
01:42:42,040 --> 01:42:43,480
Save the cheerleader from Siler.

2168
01:42:43,480 --> 01:42:47,040
You did it. You saved the cheerleader and saved the world.

2169
01:42:47,400 --> 01:42:48,400
We proud of you.

2170
01:42:48,400 --> 01:42:51,080
Wow. That Horn Room classics animatronic.

2171
01:42:51,080 --> 01:42:53,280
I still often describe saying every so often.

2172
01:42:53,800 --> 01:42:54,840
You do know me.

2173
01:42:54,840 --> 01:42:57,720
I know you don't know any other heroes characters, but

2174
01:42:59,280 --> 01:43:02,480
yeah, well, you know what shows never go away or soap operas.

2175
01:43:02,680 --> 01:43:07,840
So, you know, you can do these are the days of our lives.

2176
01:43:08,360 --> 01:43:10,440
You're in the hourglass.

2177
01:43:10,440 --> 01:43:13,360
OK, I thought our marriage was going to work.

2178
01:43:14,440 --> 01:43:16,200
No, no.

2179
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:21,400
Abominable. Oh, the snow.

2180
01:43:21,400 --> 01:43:24,560
The snowman. Yeah, it can be all be abominable.

2181
01:43:24,560 --> 01:43:28,400
It's now it's a like really intense bobsled ride.

2182
01:43:30,160 --> 01:43:31,960
Superstore.

2183
01:43:32,440 --> 01:43:35,600
Yeah. What about like your yeah, like what could you

2184
01:43:35,800 --> 01:43:38,600
is there like a pneumatic tube or anything in Superstore

2185
01:43:38,600 --> 01:43:42,400
that they send messages back and forth between anyone watch Superstore?

2186
01:43:42,400 --> 01:43:46,080
Is there any NBC property with a pneumatic tube like a bank?

2187
01:43:46,120 --> 01:43:50,840
Isn't a character in a wheelchair perpetually cold and done?

2188
01:43:51,240 --> 01:43:52,640
Is in a wheelchair. All right.

2189
01:43:52,640 --> 01:43:54,480
So like where this is going.

2190
01:43:54,480 --> 01:43:56,360
Yeah. You're on a you're mad.

2191
01:43:57,640 --> 01:44:00,560
You know. Oh, yeah. OK. Yeah.

2192
01:44:00,560 --> 01:44:03,040
Handicap chair ride.

2193
01:44:03,400 --> 01:44:04,480
It works out for you.

2194
01:44:04,480 --> 01:44:06,480
You survive. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

2195
01:44:06,480 --> 01:44:13,840
Should be fine. He built he built a invented a 16 person wheelchair.

2196
01:44:14,760 --> 01:44:16,280
I'm not sure why.

2197
01:44:16,280 --> 01:44:17,960
For like, you know,

2198
01:44:18,960 --> 01:44:21,840
I always love that part of the ride in the in the pre show

2199
01:44:21,840 --> 01:44:25,480
when they're telling you why they've invented this completely impractical,

2200
01:44:25,480 --> 01:44:28,480
like bigger version of whatever is like part of that world.

2201
01:44:28,680 --> 01:44:33,640
Yeah. Yeah. Because I'm sure it would only help the let's make the DeLorean.

2202
01:44:34,560 --> 01:44:38,600
That'll help us get to 88 for carrying more luggage.

2203
01:44:38,880 --> 01:44:44,200
Is there a tie in between the video we saw of the two famous people riding the ride?

2204
01:44:44,600 --> 01:44:47,280
Oh, yeah. There's so many famous people.

2205
01:44:47,280 --> 01:44:49,080
You know, written by this.

2206
01:44:49,080 --> 01:44:51,560
Well, the video ice, of course, the best.

2207
01:44:51,560 --> 01:44:53,320
Are you talking about the best friends?

2208
01:44:53,320 --> 01:44:55,360
Ellen and Usher. Yeah.

2209
01:44:55,360 --> 01:45:01,840
Yes. Ellen and Usher wrote it together, seemingly for usher's social media,

2210
01:45:02,360 --> 01:45:04,640
because that's where this video lives. Yeah.

2211
01:45:04,640 --> 01:45:08,840
Is that it wasn't she was it wasn't part of the tape down there sometimes.

2212
01:45:08,880 --> 01:45:11,080
I don't know about that.

2213
01:45:11,080 --> 01:45:14,920
I honestly all I saw she was like, I don't know if it was a contrived thing

2214
01:45:14,920 --> 01:45:16,760
where she's like, you're going to tape this.

2215
01:45:16,760 --> 01:45:19,280
She kept like yelling at him, like, you're going to lose the camera

2216
01:45:19,680 --> 01:45:22,520
because he's just holding it unless he had it strapped to his wrist.

2217
01:45:22,520 --> 01:45:23,640
Supposed to do that.

2218
01:45:23,640 --> 01:45:27,800
And unless you have a GoPro harness or something, he was like, no, I'll be fine.

2219
01:45:28,520 --> 01:45:31,920
And then it's just a nothing really happens.

2220
01:45:32,160 --> 01:45:34,320
Like that was really I stopped watching it is boring.

2221
01:45:34,320 --> 01:45:36,560
Boring. Like the Jimmy Fallon hanging out.

2222
01:45:36,960 --> 01:45:38,360
Yeah, they just go on.

2223
01:45:38,360 --> 01:45:39,920
And Usher isn't even talking to you.

2224
01:45:39,920 --> 01:45:43,200
Right. Not like, yeah, I'm here with Ellen and we're going to go on the ride.

2225
01:45:43,200 --> 01:45:44,520
Nothing happened.

2226
01:45:44,520 --> 01:45:46,000
Nothing happens. They both enjoy it.

2227
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:48,680
Like the Kevin Hart, Jimmy Fallon video, if you haven't seen it,

2228
01:45:48,840 --> 01:45:51,000
Kevin Hart is melting down. Yeah.

2229
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:53,040
He's losing his mind. Mm hmm.

2230
01:45:53,040 --> 01:45:54,760
So at least I know I'm right.

2231
01:45:54,760 --> 01:45:55,480
Right. Rocket.

2232
01:45:55,480 --> 01:45:58,640
But like I watch the in sync and Rosie O'Donnell ride the Hulk.

2233
01:45:58,680 --> 01:46:01,320
No, I have not seen that. That's that's wonderful.

2234
01:46:02,120 --> 01:46:04,040
And the right is older than I thought.

2235
01:46:04,040 --> 01:46:06,200
Yeah, I know. Sorry.

2236
01:46:06,200 --> 01:46:08,520
Oh, 2012.

2237
01:46:08,520 --> 01:46:09,840
What? What?

2238
01:46:09,840 --> 01:46:11,960
Wait, what is this from 2012?

2239
01:46:11,960 --> 01:46:13,920
Well, do we have another unit?

2240
01:46:14,120 --> 01:46:15,560
They did ride it in 99.

2241
01:46:15,560 --> 01:46:18,520
This was OK. Oh, well, it was kind of hard to see.

2242
01:46:18,760 --> 01:46:21,400
Yeah. So 99, they wrote it for her show.

2243
01:46:21,400 --> 01:46:24,000
Her show was still going in 99. Wow. Yeah.

2244
01:46:24,040 --> 01:46:27,720
Geeze. Interesting. Isn't that Fallon taped?

2245
01:46:27,720 --> 01:46:29,800
I think it where Rosie used to tape.

2246
01:46:29,800 --> 01:46:31,760
Mm hmm. I think I could be wrong.

2247
01:46:31,760 --> 01:46:35,040
I mean, they probably just it's a nice video of them enjoying it, I assume.

2248
01:46:35,080 --> 01:46:37,480
Oh, yes. Here's them walking up to it.

2249
01:46:38,160 --> 01:46:41,200
And I'm going to I'm going to go through all the loop.

2250
01:46:41,200 --> 01:46:42,680
They've got some big shirts.

2251
01:46:42,680 --> 01:46:45,720
Was Lou Pearlman our big shirt was Lou Pearlman there?

2252
01:46:48,400 --> 01:46:51,440
Lou Pearlman and Sink and Rosie all riding together.

2253
01:46:52,120 --> 01:46:53,040
We got a vest.

2254
01:46:53,040 --> 01:46:55,440
We got a vest over short sleeve button up in shorts.

2255
01:46:55,800 --> 01:46:57,360
Pearlman, he's in dreads.

2256
01:46:57,360 --> 01:46:58,720
Real life doctor doom.

2257
01:46:58,720 --> 01:47:00,920
Real Lou Pearlman.

2258
01:47:00,920 --> 01:47:04,960
He he's not allowed in any theme parks anymore.

2259
01:47:06,040 --> 01:47:08,880
He's doing too much recruiting there.

2260
01:47:08,880 --> 01:47:10,760
They're doing a lot of bits and stuff.

2261
01:47:10,760 --> 01:47:14,120
Well, we'll watch it to see if there's anything good in there.

2262
01:47:14,440 --> 01:47:17,880
Great. So maybe maybe it's just a celebrity coaster.

2263
01:47:18,360 --> 01:47:21,200
You know, your celebrities and you're that cannon.

2264
01:47:21,200 --> 01:47:25,640
The pressure cook you're in is is to simulate what it's like to work at the Ellen show.

2265
01:47:25,640 --> 01:47:27,040
Oh, yeah.

2266
01:47:29,960 --> 01:47:32,200
They replaced the soundtrack, which is her screaming at you.

2267
01:47:32,200 --> 01:47:36,040
Is there like, boy, this is a lot scarier than the whole was.

2268
01:47:37,840 --> 01:47:40,600
All right. So it's not like that teasing from Dakota Johnson.

2269
01:47:40,600 --> 01:47:41,920
Everyone bat.

2270
01:47:41,920 --> 01:47:44,200
I saw that.

2271
01:47:44,200 --> 01:47:46,920
All right. So it's either Ellen or Shrek.

2272
01:47:46,920 --> 01:47:48,040
Got it.

2273
01:47:48,040 --> 01:47:49,560
It's oh, by the way, it's a classic.

2274
01:47:49,560 --> 01:47:51,040
Fart cannon. Fart cannon.

2275
01:47:51,040 --> 01:47:53,000
Oh, very good.

2276
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:54,040
Oh, yes.

2277
01:47:54,040 --> 01:47:56,800
We're trying to build the

2278
01:47:56,800 --> 01:47:59,360
thought attempting the world's biggest fart.

2279
01:47:59,680 --> 01:48:03,440
The fart, the the hugest fart ever attempted.

2280
01:48:03,440 --> 01:48:06,080
As I say that, that makes so much sense.

2281
01:48:06,440 --> 01:48:09,000
That universal would do it, especially when it's reboot.

2282
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:12,000
Shrek has been in a few years because the universe is more adult.

2283
01:48:12,160 --> 01:48:13,680
And they'll go there.

2284
01:48:13,680 --> 01:48:14,640
That's the humor. Yeah.

2285
01:48:14,640 --> 01:48:16,920
Well, I think I dig it.

2286
01:48:16,920 --> 01:48:18,320
Chase, any last minute thoughts?

2287
01:48:18,320 --> 01:48:21,000
Plus up Hulk memories.

2288
01:48:22,640 --> 01:48:24,880
Any the hulking out you wanted to?

2289
01:48:25,400 --> 01:48:27,240
Would you like to Hulk out?

2290
01:48:27,240 --> 01:48:32,520
Uh, no, I mean, that's yeah, it it it is a very fondly remembered

2291
01:48:32,720 --> 01:48:38,760
bride for me and and yeah, it's a regret that it's not what it once was.

2292
01:48:38,760 --> 01:48:40,880
But it's still I think it's still fun.

2293
01:48:40,880 --> 01:48:45,080
Yeah, it's just whatever reason like it's maybe just our ages, honestly.

2294
01:48:46,080 --> 01:48:47,160
Should be.

2295
01:48:47,160 --> 01:48:48,480
But yes, it's the the the.

2296
01:48:48,480 --> 01:48:52,480
They're blaming it on like LEDs and it's all like headache.

2297
01:48:52,920 --> 01:48:53,960
As far as related.

2298
01:48:53,960 --> 01:48:58,560
Yeah, as far as the headaches is our ages in the pre show, obviously, is their fault.

2299
01:48:59,200 --> 01:49:01,560
The pre show pre show you feel a little more fun.

2300
01:49:01,560 --> 01:49:05,040
Now it looks like this CG you see when like they licensed the Avengers

2301
01:49:05,040 --> 01:49:08,680
to like a park in the Middle East that doesn't have the rights to the actors.

2302
01:49:08,680 --> 01:49:11,040
License. Yeah, they just do it real quick in the CG.

2303
01:49:11,040 --> 01:49:16,600
And yeah, the way that it was before the the pre show video was it was kind of

2304
01:49:17,040 --> 01:49:19,400
it was kind of

2305
01:49:19,400 --> 01:49:21,920
cheap looking and like in like an endearing way, like it was.

2306
01:49:22,360 --> 01:49:24,720
The animation was like kind of bad looking. Yeah.

2307
01:49:25,080 --> 01:49:29,000
Marvel had a string of cartoons in the 90s and X-Men and Spider-Man were the big ones.

2308
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:31,320
And then there was like, all right, turn out some more.

2309
01:49:31,320 --> 01:49:33,840
So then there was Iron Man and Fantastic Four and Hulk.

2310
01:49:33,840 --> 01:49:36,560
And those were all just syndicated all over the place.

2311
01:49:36,560 --> 01:49:38,520
A little cheaper, a little cheaper.

2312
01:49:38,520 --> 01:49:41,280
So maybe a lot. I don't know.

2313
01:49:41,280 --> 01:49:44,360
All right. So well, we plus it up perfectly.

2314
01:49:44,520 --> 01:49:45,600
Yeah. Yeah.

2315
01:49:45,600 --> 01:49:47,280
I don't know what else there is to do.

2316
01:49:47,280 --> 01:49:51,120
Oh, can I say this is just this is really juvenile and I shouldn't read this.

2317
01:49:51,120 --> 01:49:53,880
Let's do it. But the company that's responsible for putting it up.

2318
01:49:53,880 --> 01:49:56,000
Did you see that on the Wikipedia, what it was called?

2319
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:59,560
Superior rigging and erection, which makes a lot of sense.

2320
01:49:59,560 --> 01:50:02,040
But I don't know. I've never seen a company with just erection.

2321
01:50:02,040 --> 01:50:03,680
They use the direction.

2322
01:50:03,680 --> 01:50:05,880
Superior rigging and erection.

2323
01:50:06,120 --> 01:50:07,400
Of course, that's what it is.

2324
01:50:07,400 --> 01:50:10,240
The construction company who literally lifted the beams and stuff.

2325
01:50:10,240 --> 01:50:12,680
Yes, right. But hey, they deserve credit, too.

2326
01:50:13,640 --> 01:50:16,080
I think I might. Well, here's an idea.

2327
01:50:16,080 --> 01:50:18,280
Here's how Universal can really spice it up.

2328
01:50:18,280 --> 01:50:19,640
It's the for that.

2329
01:50:19,640 --> 01:50:22,080
That island becomes the first like adults.

2330
01:50:22,320 --> 01:50:24,040
It's the first pornographic.

2331
01:50:24,040 --> 01:50:28,840
Oh, OK. And the and the Hulk is that is then the canon.

2332
01:50:28,840 --> 01:50:34,360
That is you are a you're a sperm getting shot out of an erection.

2333
01:50:34,920 --> 01:50:36,360
Well, this sounds like actually a learn.

2334
01:50:36,360 --> 01:50:39,200
It's like actually a learning tool, maybe two for kids.

2335
01:50:39,200 --> 01:50:40,640
Yes. OK, it's not.

2336
01:50:40,640 --> 01:50:42,960
Yeah, it's not. It's about.

2337
01:50:42,960 --> 01:50:43,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2338
01:50:43,880 --> 01:50:47,720
You go to in the way people, you know, sometimes schools go to Six Flags

2339
01:50:47,720 --> 01:50:49,080
to learn about physics.

2340
01:50:49,080 --> 01:50:52,320
Yeah. On the roller coasters, you start going to islands of adventure

2341
01:50:52,320 --> 01:50:54,040
to learn about the reproductive.

2342
01:50:54,040 --> 01:50:59,160
You enter in the cowper's gland and you shoot to the vas deferens

2343
01:51:00,080 --> 01:51:01,920
to the urethra.

2344
01:51:02,440 --> 01:51:03,680
Yeah, somebody. Yeah.

2345
01:51:03,680 --> 01:51:05,920
That's exactly what I assume.

2346
01:51:05,920 --> 01:51:08,720
Yeah, there's like kind of like a glass slide that people will bring around.

2347
01:51:08,720 --> 01:51:10,160
And you see you can.

2348
01:51:10,160 --> 01:51:10,800
It's an overlay.

2349
01:51:10,800 --> 01:51:13,120
You can point at the labels of all the parts.

2350
01:51:13,360 --> 01:51:15,920
And so that means you have to at the station land back

2351
01:51:16,800 --> 01:51:20,280
through a vagina, I guess, or just or land in it.

2352
01:51:20,280 --> 01:51:24,080
That's the well, if you're shooting an egg, that's the yeah.

2353
01:51:24,120 --> 01:51:26,720
No, I think that you yeah, you have to fertilize to.

2354
01:51:26,800 --> 01:51:29,200
Yeah, that's the that's a triumph.

2355
01:51:29,200 --> 01:51:31,680
It's a tantric thing. It's internal. It's all internal.

2356
01:51:32,280 --> 01:51:33,520
Yeah, because you can't see it.

2357
01:51:33,520 --> 01:51:36,760
You're already in the vagina in the universe of the roller coaster.

2358
01:51:37,120 --> 01:51:39,360
Oh, I suppose you have to be inside already.

2359
01:51:39,360 --> 01:51:41,600
Half of the yeah.

2360
01:51:41,600 --> 01:51:44,480
The implications of that not being the case, I don't even want to talk about

2361
01:51:45,320 --> 01:51:48,360
what, frankly, it's too far for me already.

2362
01:51:48,360 --> 01:51:50,480
Yeah, let's bail before it gets too uncomfortable.

2363
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:53,280

2371
01:52:09,200 --> 01:52:14,040

2372
01:52:14,040 --> 01:52:15,480
in terms of advanced.

2373
01:52:15,480 --> 01:52:16,600
