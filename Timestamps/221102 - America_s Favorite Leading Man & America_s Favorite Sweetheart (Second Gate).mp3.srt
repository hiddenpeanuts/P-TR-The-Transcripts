1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,080
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, The Second Gate.

3
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:25,320
I'm Scott Gardner joined by Jason Sheridan.

4
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,160
Hello.

5
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,160
Hi, good to be back to regular names.

6
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

7
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,600
We don't have to belabor these.

8
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:31,860
We know what they are.

9
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,920
And there's Mike Glarl-Clarkson.

10
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:37,760
No, wait, no, no, no.

11
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:38,600
I can just go back.

12
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,960
Mike Carlson, Mike Carlson.

13
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,760
I would prefer if you actually were like,

14
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,320
Mike Carlson.

15
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,160
You kept that.

16
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,000
You kept that energy.

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,560
We gotta spookify that too.

18
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,040
Just, it's fun.

19
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:52,120
We gotta come down from spooky season, I guess,

20
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:56,160
as we settle into, I was gonna say regular topics,

21
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,280
but how regular,

22
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,720
I don't know if you can call this a regular topic.

23
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,880
Oh, baby, this is a micro-targeted one.

24
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:07,280
This has been on my docket for a while.

25
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,120
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

26
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:11,880
It's hiding in plain sight, impossible to Google.

27
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:12,720
Yeah.

28
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,640
You can't even, you can't find it.

29
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,200
No, no one's ever done any media about this.

30
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,480
This is the first thing that's ever been about it.

31
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:25,960
Jason is rubbing his hands together like an evil genius.

32
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:30,120
Like a dog at a 40s nightclub

33
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,640
who was about to get a big steak.

34
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:35,280
Oh, perfect, perfect time period for this.

35
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,280
I went back, I found pictures I took in March of this year

36
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:44,600
to as like a reminder myself of like,

37
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,040
oh, let's talk about this.

38
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,680
And we had talked about it before and then it came up again.

39
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,880
And I'm glad I could still find these pictures

40
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:58,280
because again, these phrases are so vague,

41
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,080
it's hard to search.

42
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:03,680
Yeah, this episode is about two posters.

43
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,640
Two posters by the bathrooms.

44
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,800
By the bathrooms.

45
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,000
In Hollywoodland.

46
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,680
The Hollywood, even I don't know the name,

47
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:15,640
it's called the Hollywood Studios back lot.

48
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,480
What is this actual land?

49
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,840
Isn't it down to Hollywood?

50
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,680
Because it is now. Just Hollywood.

51
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,120
I did find, searching some of these terms,

52
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,920
a Yesterland article from 2015 talking about like,

53
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,400
all right, now that California Adventure

54
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,760
has been totally redone,

55
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,880
here's all the stuff that doesn't make sense

56
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,560
in Hollywoodland.

57
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,720
Here's like, okay, half of it is like

58
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,000
the golden age of Hollywood

59
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
and half of it is like facades, like girders and false fronts.

60
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,840
Yeah, when's it set?

61
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,720
When does it set?

62
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:49,200
Why is there like art deco stuff and then schmoozies,

63
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,760
day one restaurants schmoozies still has that 90s sign

64
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,800
and off the page doesn't make sense.

65
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,920
And then it's all about like moving past sound stages

66
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:02,880
and scaffolding to get to Monstropolis.

67
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,280
Monstropolis is an anachronism.

68
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,560
Yeah.

69
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,600
A word wieners doesn't really make sense

70
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,520
in the time period either,

71
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,720
but they need a place close to the entrance

72
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,360
to sell hot dogs.

73
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,280
Well, because Carthy is a classy place,

74
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,000
that's the old back in time

75
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,840
and you would think it would blend effortlessly

76
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,840
into old classic old Hollywood.

77
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,240
It does for a few steps.

78
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,080
And it does a little bit

79
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,000
and some of the buildings actually look okay,

80
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,360
but ultimately it's a bunch of like cheesy puns and

81
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,960
yeah, there's a ghost in here.

82
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,400
But these posters next to the bathrooms,

83
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,680
next to off the page are period appropriate

84
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,600
for golden age of Hollywood.

85
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,160
But like only this,

86
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:46,800
like what else around it is golden age?

87
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:50,200
It comes right after a show like that's presented

88
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,880
by Huggies Diapers.

89
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:57,880
It's between an animation store and a show for toddlers.

90
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,240
Yeah.

91
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:02,200
And then there's a trip into the past,

92
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,960
into the thirties for bathrooms only.

93
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,800
Yes.

94
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:13,240
For like trade magazine, movie magazine facsimiles.

95
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,480
So this has come, oddly,

96
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,280
this has not been a topic before,

97
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:21,640
even though one of them has been a PTR legend.

98
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,560
That's what this,

99
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,360
initially this was a throwaway joke

100
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,520
of something that we could honor.

101
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,600
Original IP, it really is like the original,

102
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,880
the California Adventure IP.

103
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,120
And one of them, the previously mentioned one here,

104
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,520
I'll let you do the second one.

105
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,600
I'll do the one that's been mentioned before.

106
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,680
Because they're both from movie news.

107
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,560
It's both, it's big blown up covers of movie news magazine.

108
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,400
Presumably.

109
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,240
Presumably.

110
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,080
Or who knows?

111
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,480
Actually, that might be too big of a jump.

112
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:56,600
Some entity called movie news is announcing

113
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,920
that America's favorite leading man,

114
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,480
dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot,

115
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:05,320
is Hollywood's biggest star.

116
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,520
And then there's a dashing,

117
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:09,320
mustachioed man with a scarf.

118
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,140
Yes.

119
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:10,980
That's one.

120
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:11,820
Then.

121
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:14,880
Then the other one, with a woman on it,

122
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,840
it says America's favorite sweetheart,

123
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,560
heart is underlined, dot, dot, dot,

124
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,440
only one ellipses.

125
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:27,120
America's favorite sweetheart is Hollywood's biggest star.

126
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:27,960
Yeah.

127
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:31,200
So really we're dealing with two characters here.

128
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,040
America's favorite leading man

129
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,160
and America's favorite sweetheart,

130
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,520
who both are Hollywood's biggest star.

131
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,360
Somehow.

132
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,180
Yes.

133
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,020
Yeah, they share the title.

134
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:43,060
It's like best actor, actress at the Haas.

135
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:45,140
We have like kind of a,

136
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:46,980
we have a binary,

137
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,700
so they both get to claim the title

138
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,340
for their respective, for men and women.

139
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:51,180
Yes.

140
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:54,380
I have looked at these for years.

141
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:56,300
For years, when I've used it in the bathroom,

142
00:05:56,300 --> 00:06:00,260
I always take a moment and try to decipher these posters.

143
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:04,900
Cause it is almost poetry.

144
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:08,020
It's like the Voight-Kampff test in Blade Runner,

145
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:09,380
where they read you statements

146
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:10,860
and see how your pupils react

147
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,260
to try and find who's a,

148
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:15,380
what is it, replicant?

149
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:16,200
Is that the term?

150
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,340
Yes, replicant.

151
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:18,900
And who's a human being?

152
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:21,460
Like how will human beings react to the phrase,

153
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:22,940
well, America's favorite sweetheart

154
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:24,300
is Hollywood's biggest star.

155
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,740
America, and it's,

156
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:28,760
when we said we should do this,

157
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,980
I don't think we got it right,

158
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:34,100
because the America Hollywood thing is very confusing.

159
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,940
It would easy, you could easily say

160
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:40,120
Hollywood's favorite leading man is America's biggest star.

161
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:40,960
Right.

162
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,840
And just the idea that these are,

163
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:46,680
if they are magazine covers, that this is news,

164
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:50,120
breaking scoop, America's favorite leading man

165
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,920
is Hollywood's biggest star.

166
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:55,480
But you could also flip those,

167
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,980
the second part could be the first,

168
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:59,880
America's, no, Hollywood's biggest star

169
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,380
is America's favorite leading man.

170
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,520
That's, it's kind of, it's a,

171
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,960
what's, is it a palindrome?

172
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:12,960
What is it when the word loops in on itself or rhymes?

173
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:13,880
Oh, I know.

174
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,320
Like tenet, what's the,

175
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,000
what is the word for what tenet is?

176
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,220
That's a good question.

177
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:19,720
Oh, the same forwards and backwards.

178
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,560
That's what you're talking about, right?

179
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

180
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,220
That's a palindrome.

181
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:23,060
That's a palindrome.

182
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:23,880
Isn't it?

183
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,720
We might be using the wrong word.

184
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,600
The second half of both these statements,

185
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,920
everything is unnecessary.

186
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,920
The second half is implicit in the first half.

187
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,320
Same backwards and forwards, palindrome, yeah.

188
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,420
Palindrome, yeah.

189
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:35,280
Second half is implicit in the first half,

190
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,080
and the first half is implicit in the second half.

191
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:38,920
Yes.

192
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,680
It's this thing that Disney does sometimes

193
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,160
where they make something so,

194
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,220
like you recognize what it is,

195
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:47,960
but they've made it so generic and so inoffensive

196
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,900
they have come up with like outsider art.

197
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:51,740
Yeah.

198
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:55,200
Like it's just a little weird.

199
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,860
Well, let's be really,

200
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:59,280
because we don't have a lot to play with here,

201
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,720
so we need to make sure that we grasp these full phrases.

202
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,080
Are we sure that,

203
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,960
is there a way that this is news?

204
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,480
Let's just really stare at it.

205
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:11,840
America's, he's America's favorite leading man.

206
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,880
This is the beginning of the story,

207
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:18,800
and, but he's entered a new phase of his life,

208
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,800
or maybe recently it's been determined

209
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,680
that he is also Hollywood's biggest star.

210
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:28,480
Favorite and biggest, maybe there's a difference there.

211
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:31,640
Maybe favorite is people's choice.

212
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:34,240
That's like quality.

213
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,480
It's not mathematical, quantitative.

214
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:42,480
This is like the most quality actor or actress.

215
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:45,260
It is now making the box office bucks

216
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:48,400
that make him the official biggest star in Hollywood.

217
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:53,400
So what we're seeing is a marriage of critical quality,

218
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:57,520
audience fandom, and the box office receipts are there too.

219
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:00,660
Like a Miles Teller situation.

220
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,180
Didn't think a whole lot of him

221
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:04,740
or think about him before Top Gun Maverick.

222
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,820
And after Top Gun Maverick, I'm like,

223
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:09,100
maybe I kinda like Miles Teller.

224
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:11,420
Yeah, I know, it's a disturbing.

225
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:12,260
But he was.

226
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,940
I didn't like that thought occurring to me either.

227
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:15,780
I didn't either.

228
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:18,980
You had to face it after Top Gun Maverick.

229
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:22,640
But if it was, if America's favorite sweetheart,

230
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,080
let's say America, I remember,

231
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:28,260
America's favorite number one sweetheart,

232
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:33,020
in what world wouldn't she be automatically the biggest star?

233
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:34,900
She's the favorite.

234
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:35,740
Yeah.

235
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:38,820
Like it just doesn't seem to me that they can be different.

236
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,860
I mean, unless she was in a different field,

237
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:44,020
like she was a newscaster or something

238
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:46,140
and she was America's sweetheart, they'd call her that.

239
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:48,840
And now she's the biggest star because she's in a movie.

240
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,900
Let me throw an example.

241
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:52,340
I'm trying to think of a real world example of this.

242
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:53,820
And look, I think, you know,

243
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:57,060
what's confusing is this is 30s, 40s or whatever,

244
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:59,700
where I think those things are gonna be married more.

245
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,940
Like there's less of a divide between what audiences want

246
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:04,340
and what they pay for.

247
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:09,340
But now, like, well, he's not frequently mentioned

248
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:13,420
so much as all of his weird business partners are.

249
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:17,500
George Clooney, who also acts in addition

250
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,500
to making phone calls in a boardroom,

251
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,020
which is what we value the most in people.

252
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:25,220
But George Clooney sometimes acts in films.

253
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:29,260
And I feel like those often box office wise

254
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:30,820
are not the biggest movies.

255
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:31,660
That's true.

256
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:32,860
Would you not possibly call him,

257
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:34,460
or at least at some point in time,

258
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:37,020
has he been America's favorite leading man?

259
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:39,180
You know, the movies are like Michael Clayton.

260
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,860
That's not the biggest film of the year.

261
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:44,340
But I wouldn't call him America's favorite leading man.

262
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:45,980
You don't think at any point George Clooney

263
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:46,820
has been America's? I think at one time

264
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:47,660
he might have been.

265
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:48,740
What can be the era?

266
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:53,220
I'm thinking post-Ocean's Eleven, I guess.

267
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:57,500
Ocean's Eleven, post the 90s action movie,

268
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:00,420
post like the Peacemaker and Batman and Robin.

269
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,020
You mean after that?

270
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:03,860
Post, yeah, after.

271
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:04,700
Not during that.

272
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:05,540
Post, yeah.

273
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:06,380
Okay, yeah.

274
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:07,700
Three Kings?

275
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:08,540
No, not very well.

276
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:09,380
No, not very well.

277
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:10,220
And he's still on the way up.

278
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:11,060
Right, right.

279
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:13,300
This is where, like, if he shows up at the Oscars,

280
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:15,340
everybody loses their shit,

281
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:17,260
and everybody makes the biggest deal of him,

282
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:19,980
and every joke at the Golden Globes is about him.

283
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,660
But maybe that's not off,

284
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:24,860
maybe that's off of a little respected movie

285
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:26,060
that he allowed to happen

286
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,940
by breathing his star force into it,

287
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:31,540
but then he did not have any of the top 10 films

288
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:32,460
of the year.

289
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:33,980
That seems like, maybe this,

290
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:36,460
I think this is the best example I could think of,

291
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:39,420
where maybe he's not, if you're not,

292
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:41,940
on a spreadsheet, he's not Hollywood's biggest star.

293
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:44,020
Well, I think America's favorite sweetheart

294
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:45,100
is Hollywood's biggest star.

295
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:48,060
Maybe Julia Roberts fits that one.

296
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:49,300
Was she America's sweetheart?

297
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,340
And she was a big star for a while.

298
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:53,700
I think she was both of these things.

299
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:54,540
Yeah.

300
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:55,460
Now, currently, we'll see.

301
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:56,300
They're both going,

302
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:58,340
they're both in this very generic-looking film

303
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:01,340
that I think will not be Hollywood's biggest hit.

304
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:04,380
But will they retain, will they be anyone's favorite?

305
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:06,140
Will this movie prove that?

306
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:08,420
I mean, I bet it'll be relaxing.

307
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:10,260
I bet it'll be a calming movie.

308
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:12,900
It's like, oh, okay, there's a couple movie stars,

309
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:15,180
and they're in an exotic locale,

310
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:18,060
and there's some young up-and-comers supporting them.

311
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:20,060
Take Clooney out of it, though.

312
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:21,980
Do you see how maybe it's possible

313
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,380
that America's favorite leading man

314
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:25,180
is not Hollywood's biggest star?

315
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:26,300
So I guess...

316
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:31,300
So, okay, George Clooney fits the mold of your Cary Grant,

317
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:37,020
Rhett Butler, classic Hollywood guy.

318
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:39,620
So I suppose he could be cast in the role

319
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:42,100
in the public's mind of America's leading man.

320
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:44,940
Even though that wasn't true, it was in 2001,

321
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:46,540
I'm looking at it was Chris Tucker.

322
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:48,820
It was other people who had much bigger hits.

323
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:51,300
Bigger movie. Biggest star is what I'm saying.

324
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:55,340
I think these maybe are, could be viewed as different ideas.

325
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:59,060
Yeah, okay, Mark Wahl, Planet of the Apes, Mark Wahlberg.

326
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:02,500
Like, Brendan Fraser, Mummy Returns is this year.

327
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,660
You'd never at that time call Mark Wahlberg

328
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,580
America's favorite leading man.

329
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:09,340
He could have been at some point.

330
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:10,980
He certainly is now.

331
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:11,820
I think...

332
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:15,140
The show about all his business ventures

333
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:17,940
and Uncle Steve or whatever that was.

334
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:18,780
Father Stu.

335
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:19,620
Father Stu.

336
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:24,420
Don't forget Uncharted, a quiet, a pretty big hit, I believe.

337
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:25,900
So I think that leading man,

338
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:29,100
the phrase leading man is left over from an old era.

339
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:29,940
Yeah.

340
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:31,980
So I think Clooney has been, they've been trying to,

341
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:36,020
they cast him as that in the film media.

342
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:36,860
Yes.

343
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:39,340
For a long time, even though people probably,

344
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:40,940
there's bigger stars, they actually like more,

345
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:43,300
even though George Clooney is a perfectly good actor

346
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:44,740
and good movies.

347
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:47,860
Yeah, I think it's fair to say at some point,

348
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:49,700
if somebody said, and here he is,

349
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,660
America's favorite leading man,

350
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:53,460
it's probably was said on a red carpet,

351
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:56,020
even if the receipts don't back it up.

352
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:59,180
I think Clooney, Clooney may be a close one

353
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:02,180
that falls into it because he can kind of do it all.

354
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:04,500
He had a television show, he was doing action movies,

355
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,540
then he was more critically acclaimed movies,

356
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:10,260
then he started doing like smaller movies and directing

357
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:11,820
and he's charming on talk shows.

358
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:12,980
And he's handsome.

359
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:14,460
Here's the thing, here's the issue.

360
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:16,700
He's traditionally handsome,

361
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:18,900
which is, I believe, what people liked,

362
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,340
why he was cast in this role.

363
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:23,180
Some of these other people aren't as traditionally handsome.

364
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:25,740
Even a Tom Hanks isn't as handsome as George Clooney,

365
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:28,220
even though Tom Hanks way more success.

366
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:29,180
But I bet you would say like,

367
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:32,900
oh, George Clooney's a better leading man than Tom Hanks.

368
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:35,900
It's a very, it's an idea from the era.

369
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:36,740
Right, but Tom Hanks is-

370
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:39,940
For some reason, leading man does imply,

371
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:42,020
look, I think to be the favorite leading man

372
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:43,380
or America's favorite sweetheart,

373
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:45,140
attractiveness does have to enter into the picture.

374
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:47,220
Because that's the old style way of thinking it.

375
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:50,420
Tom Hanks is by far America's number one leading man,

376
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:52,140
I think, for the last 30 years.

377
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:56,060
But Jepetto, think about it all, Jepetto, the terminal.

378
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:56,900
It's all-

379
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,220
Mr. Rogers movie.

380
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:00,140
Mr. Rogers movie, Waltz.

381
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:01,300
The moped one.

382
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,140
Larry Crown.

383
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:03,100
Larry Crown.

384
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:05,020
Yes, Charlie Wilson's War.

385
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:05,860
Charlie Wilson's War.

386
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:07,100
But he's made so many-

387
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:07,940
Birds.

388
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:10,380
Bigger movies that have made more money than George.

389
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:13,740
Yeah, but this poster is more the golden age of Hollywood

390
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:17,060
when people knew these stars on the big screen

391
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:18,580
or movie magazines.

392
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:20,100
He's got the affectations,

393
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,940
got a pencil thin mustache, a big scarf.

394
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:23,540
So for leading man-

395
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:25,300
And some streaks of gray.

396
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,580
So they think, so this is like

397
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:30,460
America's most inoffensive hot man.

398
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:32,860
That's sort of what people,

399
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:35,260
that's what they're saying more than leading man

400
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:37,140
in the sense that it can open a movie.

401
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:38,020
Well, that might be true,

402
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:41,940
but I think you might be dehumanizing and devaluing

403
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,660
what could be great onscreen work

404
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:46,420
from this unnamed man in the poster.

405
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:47,260
Who kind of looks-

406
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:49,980
Inoffensive implies that maybe the stuff isn't that good.

407
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:52,460
I'm just saying, George doesn't really have an edge.

408
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:55,540
I would say George is a perfectly charming guy

409
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:57,860
and I like watching him in a lot of movies,

410
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:59,100
but he's not edgy.

411
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,300
He doesn't feel like he's got a dark side.

412
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:05,140
He doesn't have a collateral in his thing.

413
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:05,980
Does he?

414
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:07,220
Does he overplay like a murderer?

415
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:09,100
Is that the American?

416
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:09,940
I've never seen the American.

417
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:11,740
Look, at some point, we're not,

418
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:13,540
George Clooney was an example.

419
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:14,540
We're not talking about George.

420
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:15,900
We're talking about this guy.

421
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:17,660
This guy. This guy in this poster.

422
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:18,740
Who kind of looks like Clark Gable.

423
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:20,180
You brought up a good example

424
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:22,460
and I'm trying to deconstruct what people might mean

425
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:23,620
by leading man.

426
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:24,460
Yes.

427
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:26,020
To understand what the poster is getting at.

428
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:28,700
My fear is that you're staying on George Clooney

429
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:31,660
because you love the fucking tequila thing so much.

430
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:33,300
No, it's nothing to do with the tequila thing.

431
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,140
I haven't talked about tequila.

432
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:36,460
I'm talking about the films of George Clooney.

433
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:37,420
Nothing to do with tequila.

434
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:39,980
I think you have to go back further.

435
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:40,820
Let's go back further.

436
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:42,820
I'm just afraid of where we're heading.

437
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:43,820
Let's go back further.

438
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:44,660
Jason's right.

439
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:45,500
Jason, yes.

440
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,540
I think you have to go back further.

441
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:48,980
Especially if you look at America's sweetheart

442
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:52,940
because she has, I was staring at that picture

443
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:55,620
and I'm like, I'm not quite sure if she kind of looks

444
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:57,060
like Mary Pickford.

445
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:58,900
She kind of looks like Rita Hayworth.

446
00:16:58,900 --> 00:16:59,740
I was gonna say Rita Hayworth.

447
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:00,580
Or Betty Grable.

448
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:01,420
Yeah.

449
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:04,220
Betty Grable, who I was reading her Wikipedia

450
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:06,580
and I never knew this.

451
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:08,020
I was looking at her filmography.

452
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:09,740
I was like, I know this name.

453
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,060
I don't know if I've seen any of these movies

454
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:17,340
but I think she was like the Julia Roberts of her time.

455
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:20,820
Her movies grossed a massive amount of money.

456
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:21,660
Yeah.

457
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:26,500
So, yeah, were they, were sweet, sweetheart has been,

458
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,980
how long has sweetheart been around is a phrase?

459
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:31,500
That's an old phrase, right?

460
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,820
I couldn't tell you offhand.

461
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:34,460
America's sweetheart. I guess I should have done research

462
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:36,740
into the entomology of the word sweetheart.

463
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:37,580
And I knew this is where.

464
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:39,660
This is an episode about atoms.

465
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:43,020
We're like, we have like four things here.

466
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:46,340
So probably I should have done that work.

467
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:47,540
She's a real sweetheart.

468
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:48,380
She's a sweetheart.

469
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:52,180
She kind of looks a little baby face.

470
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:55,180
Sweetheart isn't Marilyn Monroe necessarily.

471
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:56,540
No, this is before that.

472
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:58,660
This is a more innocent time.

473
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,340
She kind of has the puffy sleeves,

474
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:02,780
which due to fashion being cyclical

475
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:04,180
are now back in fashion.

476
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:06,740
Sweetheart made like, there's a lot,

477
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:10,540
there's a little less like a va, va, va, vroom in sweetheart.

478
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:11,380
Yes.

479
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:12,860
She is more of a girl next door.

480
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:15,580
She's even, she's more in Judy Garland mode, I would say.

481
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:16,420
Yes. For sure.

482
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:17,300
The bow and the hair.

483
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:19,420
I think this is your little sister.

484
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:21,220
This is not the sex object.

485
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:24,900
So we can't, this is maybe something we know about

486
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:28,260
the body of work of this unnamed person in this poster.

487
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:30,260
But she has some level of maturity

488
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:32,220
because it appears she is sitting in front

489
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:36,260
of a makeup mirror with like little jars,

490
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:39,420
ornate jars and a spritzing bottle, you know?

491
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:41,860
She does, she's in front of little jars.

492
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:46,420
So we can get a lot of information from the little jars.

493
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:47,260
The little jars.

494
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:48,500
The little jars.

495
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:52,580
She's got a little, looks like an expensive bracelet on.

496
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:55,580
We're, we're, we're, we're in the woods now.

497
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:56,620
We're talking, okay.

498
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:59,540
So what can we glean from the little jars

499
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:01,620
on the poster outside of the bathroom?

500
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:03,700
Who do you think America's sweetheart is?

501
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,900
She's possibly under 18, I think.

502
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,100
I don't think she's well under 18.

503
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:08,740
It's hard with old movie stars too.

504
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:11,180
Sometimes you go, they're either like 15, you don't know,

505
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:13,060
or they're like 15.

506
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:15,260
Especially the ladies, sometimes you don't know

507
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:17,220
because they would make them up in such a way

508
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:18,220
to make them look older.

509
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:21,220
Lauren Bacall, when she first started

510
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:25,020
like starring in roles opposite Humphrey Bogart

511
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:27,460
was like 18 years old.

512
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:29,340
And like in Key Largo.

513
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:30,180
He was 100.

514
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:31,020
Huh?

515
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:36,300
He was like at least 12 years older than her, probably more.

516
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:37,660
Yeah.

517
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:40,540
And she has a level, she does seem older,

518
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:42,820
but then you watch like some of the first movies.

519
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:45,580
You're like, oh, you are 18 years old.

520
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:46,780
Sure.

521
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:49,180
I will say this about America's favorite sweetheart.

522
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:51,180
The pose is a little bit like she's cool.

523
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:52,020
She's kind of cool.

524
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:52,900
She's like, hey, what are you doing?

525
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:53,740
What are you up to?

526
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:56,540
She's not like, oh my gosh, like I'm nerdy.

527
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:58,740
Like she's very comfortable, it looks like,

528
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:02,180
in whatever, her sitting in front of the little jars.

529
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:03,020
Casual. Casual.

530
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:04,780
Talk to her at a party.

531
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:05,620
Yeah.

532
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:06,460
She puts you at ease.

533
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:08,540
Even though you're intimidated to be talking to her.

534
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:11,140
Right, like you're, okay, so Jason's a cub reporter

535
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:13,100
and he works for movie news.

536
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:15,980
And he goes in there and he's got his reporter,

537
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:17,340
his cub reporter outfit on,

538
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:20,340
and he's very nervous to talk to America's favorite sweetheart.

539
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:23,020
She turns around, kind of strikes this pose,

540
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:25,620
and it's just like, what do you got for me, big boy?

541
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:28,460
So she's like, that's the vibe I'm getting from her.

542
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:31,820
I was with you on the,

543
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:34,020
that she seems chill from the posture,

544
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:35,780
but then what you put in her mouth was,

545
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:37,860
what do you got for me, big boy?

546
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:39,300
Yeah, that's a little more Mae West.

547
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:41,460
That's very aggressive, I feel.

548
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:43,420
All right, what would be a friend?

549
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:44,260
What do you wanna know?

550
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:45,620
She just chills down to earth and she says,

551
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:47,140
what do you got for me, big boy?

552
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:47,980
I think she's gonna do,

553
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,500
but I think she's gonna needle you a little bit,

554
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:52,060
cause she notices that Jason is a little nervous.

555
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:53,740
So she's gonna give it like, just playful.

556
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:55,420
She's, it's in its old times.

557
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,780
This is what somebody in the olden days would say.

558
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:01,900
This isn't necessarily what I would write for a character now.

559
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,900
I hear what do you got for me, big boy?

560
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,300
And that's flirtation.

561
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:08,300
That's she wants the fuck-cubed reporter, Jason Sheridan.

562
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,460
Well, maybe, but she knows that he's intimidated

563
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:11,980
because she's America's sweetheart.

564
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,420
And of course he has a little crush on her

565
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:14,940
because everyone in America does.

566
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,060
We all do. Right.

567
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:19,100
We all did even before she became Hollywood's biggest star.

568
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,260
So she's playing into that.

569
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:22,580
She's kind of needling him and she's like, gonna make it.

570
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:25,100
She's like, I have the power here, cause she's a big star.

571
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:25,940
She's America's favorite sweetheart.

572
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:26,860
He's gonna throw him off.

573
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:28,340
He's gonna do a worse job.

574
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:30,820
She shouldn't, that's the, she's not putting him at ease.

575
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:31,660
I think she would say.

576
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:34,220
This guy was with you on the character until the dialogue.

577
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:36,500
The dialogue doesn't fit the character you painted.

578
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,340
Look at the poster.

579
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:38,180
I feel like.

580
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:40,820
Hold, Jason, be quiet for me for one second.

581
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:42,580
You'll have time to cover port.

582
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:45,620
I'm just saying, look at this photo and then really,

583
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:47,820
I want you to sit here and I want us to sit in silence

584
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:51,020
while you look at this poster and you look at the character

585
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:54,140
and imagine the dialogue I just said

586
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:55,940
and see if you can imagine her saying it.

587
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:57,620
Because I really think when she,

588
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:59,300
she's got her head on her shoulder

589
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:00,900
and she's really leaning into it.

590
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:03,940
She's really kind of like very, very casual.

591
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:05,380
I think big boy is not a stretch

592
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:07,180
that would come out of her mouth.

593
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:12,180
I think she is on her way up,

594
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:16,900
but she knows she's gotta sell the movie

595
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:21,500
and I gotta get this story to print by 5pm.

596
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,900
Okay, so I think there's.

597
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:23,900
Movie news goes out.

598
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:26,060
Like famously prints on Wednesday night.

599
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:30,700
Movie news needs to go to press, okay?

600
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:31,540
So I think she.

601
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:33,700
What did she say to you?

602
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:34,820
Give me the line of dialogue.

603
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,340
She says to kind of like break the ice,

604
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:38,940
to meet you as the cub reporter in her dress,

605
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,860
in her dressing room.

606
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,500
What do you got for me, sport?

607
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:45,820
See, that's in the same vein as what I said.

608
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:47,780
I think it's a lot less sexualized.

609
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:48,620
Because of the big boy.

610
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:52,700
Big boy is like, and when it's what do you got for me,

611
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:54,420
that's like whip it out.

612
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:56,620
Show me your hog.

613
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:58,020
What do you wanna know?

614
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:59,500
What do you wanna know, kid?

615
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,740
What do you wanna know, kid?

616
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:01,580
Sport line.

617
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:02,400
Puts you on the level.

618
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,340
I think that's correct.

619
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:05,980
I think big boy is aggressive.

620
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:07,340
Scott, what do you think the line would be

621
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:08,940
that she would say to Jason?

622
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:10,940
This is really specific here.

623
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:11,780
You think this is.

624
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:12,620
It has to sound old for me.

625
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:14,180
You didn't prepare for this before we did this episode?

626
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:18,620
I did not think of what a sample piece of dialogue would be.

627
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:20,780
I think maybe she calls me,

628
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:23,300
sport, maybe kid, maybe,

629
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,280
even though she's probably younger than me,

630
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,340
but she sees I'm sweating

631
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:29,020
because she's got the high cards here

632
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:31,220
because she's America's favorite sweetheart.

633
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:32,060
Yeah.

634
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:32,900
Which is Hollywood's biggest star.

635
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:35,180
We're probably breaking as Hollywood's biggest star

636
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:36,020
as we speak.

637
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:36,840
I think the listeners need to vote

638
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,540
on all of our dialogue and see

639
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:41,300
what they think, whose piece of dialogue they think

640
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:43,260
is most appropriate to this poster.

641
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:46,100
I think you need to join in, Scott.

642
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,080
Is it yours?

643
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:51,000
Well, is she kind of deconstructing her own myth?

644
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,760
Is she being a little standoffish

645
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:58,000
and like, so you think you know everything about me,

646
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,200
do you?

647
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,040
Try me.

648
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:01,840
I think she's.

649
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:02,680
That's okay, that's good.

650
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:03,760
A little challenge.

651
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,440
I think I'm just trying to get a quote

652
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:10,640
to give to the American people, the viewing public,

653
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,880
and all our ships at sea.

654
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:15,040
Jay, is that your opening line?

655
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,040
Just the facts, man.

656
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:18,080
I'll be like, Joe Friday, just the facts.

657
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:22,200
I'm Jason Sheridan from Movie News,

658
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,800
and I'm just trying to get this information

659
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,360
to our boys overseas, ma'am.

660
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,740
I also don't think you're the kind of reporter

661
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:30,440
who's trying to dig up scandal

662
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,680
because remember, this is the time where we didn't know.

663
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,480
We didn't know what people were getting into,

664
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,200
and maybe it was better that way.

665
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:41,280
We didn't know about people's special salad dressing

666
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:45,940
and diving under the car, and who's spitting on who.

667
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,180
Now we know every tawdry detail,

668
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:51,820
but there was a time where we let these people live.

669
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:55,300
This isn't LA Confidential Magazine, this is Movie News.

670
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:57,280
If you wanna talk off the record,

671
00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:00,100
I'll meet you at the frolic room, okay?

672
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:01,680
Next to the Pantages.

673
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:06,660
But then maybe we end up with a blind item, not with a.

674
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:07,580
I think you're there to,

675
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:09,740
you're putting her on the cover of Movie News,

676
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:11,460
which we haven't maybe talked about

677
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:14,020
what is the prominence of Movie News.

678
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:17,740
Is it just a trade magazine, or is this Rolling Stone?

679
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:20,900
Is this the moment where you made it?

680
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:24,340
Where like, I'm on the cover of Movie News, me?

681
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:27,660
I grew up staring at the covers,

682
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:30,100
thinking the people on Movie News were gods,

683
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:32,100
and now I am one?

684
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:34,300
I mean, I think if they have the budget

685
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:37,480
for multicolored backgrounds, you know,

686
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:40,500
back then all this stuff has to be done practically.

687
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:41,340
Yes.

688
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:43,460
So they gotta have hair and makeup there,

689
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:45,700
they gotta have wardrobe there,

690
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:49,660
and we're doing like a shoot for these covers, you know?

691
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:51,620
Yeah, one that probably the big dogs,

692
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:55,300
your life's have color, but maybe not every.

693
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:57,140
Yeah, it's not a rag, you're right,

694
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:59,220
if they're committing to the color.

695
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:04,220
It's not a rag, but it might not be the most,

696
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:05,780
it might not be color throughout,

697
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:08,820
but maybe the front and back cover are color.

698
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:10,780
Yeah, I think you're right, I think inside,

699
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:14,340
maybe only the most special stories.

700
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:15,180
Yeah, yeah.

701
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:18,420
Or something big, but you know, when the war happened,

702
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:19,700
maybe some war photos.

703
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:23,260
I'm gonna write up what I think the interview, how it goes.

704
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:26,820
I'm gonna write a little one page here for just,

705
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:28,340
we'll post it when we post this.

706
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:29,180
Okay.

707
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:30,580
For the interview between Jason

708
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:33,220
and America's favorite sweetheart.

709
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:37,820
Do you think the stars, these big stars,

710
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:39,040
when they're dealing with Movie News,

711
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:44,040
are they excited or nonchalant when dealing with it

712
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:45,360
or are they scared?

713
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,320
Like, Hedda Hopper is calling,

714
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:50,040
the gossip columnists are calling.

715
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:52,240
I think this is probably a general mag,

716
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,640
like this is a very easy one.

717
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,920
This isn't gonna be like, you're not gonna get,

718
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,200
it's not gonna be a gotcha thing.

719
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,400
This is like people, this is just how we're like

720
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,640
celebrating and endorsing celebrity.

721
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,680
Right, they might've contacted, you know,

722
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,680
their own people might've put all this together.

723
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,800
Yes, this might be a breezy profile

724
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,960
where the first few paragraphs are just like,

725
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:14,360
they walked in and they ordered a croissant and a latte.

726
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:16,480
Yeah, it's the old, we have to know

727
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,600
what the famous people were eating that day.

728
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,040
What better way to get into their heads?

729
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:24,880
Are they having a Jones on third, okay?

730
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,280
The headlines itself is what tells me

731
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:29,080
what the magazine's like.

732
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:31,680
Cause it's the most generic thing you've ever read.

733
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,520
Yeah.

734
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,000
They would be trying to sell it

735
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,400
based on some sort of tawdry detail.

736
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,640
It's not about their life.

737
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,320
It's not about their personal life.

738
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:41,720
It's not about a marriage or a divorce.

739
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:44,120
We might not know anything about these people.

740
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:47,280
Look, I don't wanna go making assumptions,

741
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:50,600
but based on equivalent people at the time,

742
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:54,000
could be a lot of divorces happening with leading man.

743
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,640
It could be a drunk.

744
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:01,640
She could have a Judy Garland style pill applied by studio.

745
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,560
There could be very dark things going on.

746
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,360
There are for sure dark things going on.

747
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,520
Yes.

748
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,560
It's the old Hollywood.

749
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,480
There's gotta be something.

750
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,320
With each other.

751
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,160
They might've,

752
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,840
she might've broken up his marriage or something.

753
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:13,680
Yeah, possible.

754
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,520
Do you think they know each other?

755
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,360
Do they know?

756
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,200
They definitely know each other.

757
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,320
They for sure know each other.

758
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,280
Or it was a huge deal when they met,

759
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,560
but do you think they've,

760
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:24,280
I don't know, yeah, have they hooked up?

761
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:25,120
Yeah, is that a thing?

762
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,240
Are we gonna say have they done it?

763
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:31,280
Are they an item or a secret item?

764
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,880
Or do they hate each other?

765
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:36,360
Like Judy Garland and Mickey Rooney?

766
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,040
Later on?

767
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:38,880
Oh, yeah, they fucking despise each other.

768
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,680
I think a lot of people hated Mickey Rooney.

769
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,080
Mickey Rooney was out of his mind.

770
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:45,320
I don't know that it started that way, but like.

771
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,800
Sure.

772
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,480
Yeah, I think that they for sure,

773
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,840
obviously for sure know each other,

774
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,680
but yes, I think they probably worked with each other.

775
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,360
If they're the two biggest stars,

776
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,600
I mean, can you think of like,

777
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,800
who are the two biggest stars now

778
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,440
that have never worked together?

779
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,480
There's gotta be a couple.

780
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,320
But do we have stars?

781
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,880
I mean, there's only a handful of stars left, I suppose.

782
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:03,880
Uh-huh.

783
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,320
It's not like, but is, yeah,

784
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:09,000
is there any, there are all in oceans 11.

785
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,560
The Rock and Tom Cruise have not co-starred.

786
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:14,200
I guess The Rock is a little bit off on his own island.

787
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,040
Yeah.

788
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,600
And I guess Tom is lately.

789
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:19,520
Isn't that, I think The Rock is Hollywood's biggest star,

790
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,840
but not America's favorite leading man.

791
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:26,440
Well, only because he's too jacked to fit in the mold

792
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,400
of what you think of a leading man.

793
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,200
Yes, there's nothing, I don't think

794
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,440
there's anything romantic about The Rock.

795
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,560
Well, I like.

796
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,880
America's favorite leading man,

797
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,520
there implies like a, I don't think you would ever

798
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,120
call The Rock dashing.

799
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,040
You'd say he's cool.

800
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:41,880
But I don't think he's.

801
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:44,640
I think a lot of people are attracted to The Rock though.

802
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,760
Isn't that a, yeah, I guess so.

803
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:47,600
Yeah.

804
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:50,200
I think you can present him as dashing.

805
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,840
Isn't he wearing a suit in red?

806
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:52,800
Is he in red notice?

807
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:53,640
Which one is he in?

808
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:56,840
In Jungle Cruise, are you like,

809
00:29:56,840 --> 00:30:00,160
oh, if the, oh, The Rock could sweep me up onto his boat

810
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:02,080
and take me on a river adventure.

811
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,560
I think some people are,

812
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,880
but they're not presenting him in the movie like that.

813
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,840
But also movies are very like,

814
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,760
big movies are very sexless now.

815
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,080
There's not a lot of.

816
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:11,920
Yes.

817
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:14,120
So there's not even a lot of that anymore.

818
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:16,560
What's The Rock's sexiest scene?

819
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:19,000
Is there a scene with The Rock where people would go,

820
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:24,000
where a woman might go like, oh, that rock,

821
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,600
I don't think so.

822
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:28,800
Well, he's shirtless and stuff and that's enough, right?

823
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:31,520
Certainly, of course he's an attractive man, but like.

824
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,360
I just don't think he's like,

825
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:34,560
you don't think of like sensuality.

826
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,200
But Cluny, you think sensuality?

827
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,040
Yeah.

828
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:38,880
I'm trying to think of what.

829
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,800
Out of sight scene is sexy.

830
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:41,640
Okay, that's true.

831
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,400
I can think of why, there's a scene.

832
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:46,520
A disc in all, your favorite movie, Disclosure.

833
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:47,360
Oh yeah, yeah.

834
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,520
Oh, well, of course, yes.

835
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:51,120
Oh, well, there's no question with Michael Douglas.

836
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:52,960
Obviously.

837
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,480
The Rock, okay, here's a sexy scene from a movie

838
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:58,320
and I'm trying to see what, oh, is it Ballers?

839
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,960
Oh, is a sexy scene on Ballers with The Rock

840
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:01,800
where he's making out here in the bed.

841
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:02,640
I forgot about Ballers.

842
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:06,120
That's madness, this is not an iconic scene.

843
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:08,120
I'm just saying. Maybe it is to someone, but like.

844
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,960
There's also years of footage of him.

845
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:12,840
Ballers scene, nothing hotter than the Baller,

846
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,480
who's he with in the Ballers scene?

847
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,440
I gotta look it up, I actually, for leave it or not,

848
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,080
I haven't watched Ballers.

849
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:21,280
My question is, as we are,

850
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:24,880
I'm wondering what time we started doing this.

851
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,560
As we finished 10% of the episode, yes.

852
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:32,040
Have we thought about this more than the Imagineers did?

853
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,200
Yes, yes.

854
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,720
I'm sure the person constructing these posters

855
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:38,120
is designing these posters thought of them plenty.

856
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:42,520
This opens around the same time as Tokyo DisneySea.

857
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:44,360
And I think I've said this before on the show

858
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:47,600
that if you walk around Tokyo DisneySea,

859
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:50,640
every little plaque, every little poster

860
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:54,720
is packed with jokes and information and lore,

861
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,160
stuff that you really felt like people poured over

862
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:59,680
and were excited about, and it's dense.

863
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:02,040
And you could spend just a day at Tokyo DisneySea

864
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,960
going through and looking at that stuff

865
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:06,280
and going, oh, that's a cute little, that's funny.

866
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,840
They wrote the whole newspaper article.

867
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,880
Right, the whole newspaper, you go through all of it.

868
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:13,120
This is just like the auto,

869
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:16,040
when you open up a program

870
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,920
that just puts text on a screen.

871
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:20,680
Well, and it's very, to use a current thing,

872
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,720
it's like AI art of.

873
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:23,560
Yes.

874
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:25,720
It does, both of these people are just,

875
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:28,560
all right, put the top five actors

876
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:32,160
and the top five actresses into a visual blender.

877
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:35,080
And that is so that if you fuzz your eyes,

878
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:37,280
like, oh yeah, that might be Clark Gable, sure.

879
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:40,520
Right, and then yes, on top of it,

880
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:42,200
it doesn't, it's barely anything.

881
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,320
It doesn't mean anything.

882
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:44,640
It's meaningless.

883
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:47,680
No, even look, I, as a thought exercise,

884
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:48,960
wondered about picking these.

885
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,880
And now I do believe there's duality

886
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,200
to America's Favorite Leading Man

887
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,200
and Hollywood's Biggest Star.

888
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:56,640
But this is no, this headline is nothing.

889
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,480
Right, why not put a joke?

890
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,280
The movie news is not selling any copies with that.

891
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:02,280
What do you mean is America's, like,

892
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:05,760
I even got it wrong, America's Favorite is Hollywood's,

893
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:06,880
it's jargon.

894
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:09,120
Why not a joke, write a joke on it.

895
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:09,960
Yeah, why couldn't this be funny?

896
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,520
Award-Wieners is a joke.

897
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:12,360
Award-Wieners is a joke.

898
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,880
Whether you like it or you think it's crass or not,

899
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,480
it's a joke.

900
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,160
The issue is not that you wouldn't find it funny.

901
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,840
The issue is you might be offended by it.

902
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:20,720
I might be offended by it.

903
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,320
I don't, you think, has anyone ever walked

904
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:25,840
by Award-Wieners and gone, off, ha, oh my.

905
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:26,680
Probably.

906
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,520
You the first time you went.

907
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:31,640
Like a Christian, me, and then a bunch of Christian people.

908
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,920
Bunch of like nuns, a bunch of nuns

909
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,800
went to California Adventure.

910
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:39,280
They were all there, they were so excited.

911
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:42,840
They're walking over to go on, to see the Aladdin show.

912
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,800
And then they see that, and then they go,

913
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,160
and then they were offended and left.

914
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:48,520
Well now they know this is the golden age of Hollywood,

915
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:51,240
which nuns at the time would probably complain

916
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,880
about the coarsening of Hollywood.

917
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:53,720
That's true.

918
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:56,280
But now we forget that and we look at it as like,

919
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:58,520
everything was very squeaky clean, you know.

920
00:33:58,520 --> 00:33:59,360
Right.

921
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,720
But Award-Wieners is even too.

922
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,560
They wouldn't say that in an old movie.

923
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:06,960
No, that part is not one of the 30s parts.

924
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:10,240
Cary Grant never said wiener on the screen.

925
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:13,160
Who was the first ever to say wiener on screen?

926
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:15,320
Probably a hot dog guy in like a baseball movie.

927
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,960
Like did they say it in Damn Yankees,

928
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,800
guys selling hot dogs?

929
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,920
Peanuts, wieners.

930
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:20,760
Could be.

931
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,280
Peanuts, wieners.

932
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,120
Who said it first?

933
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,920
I wonder if even the person's family knows.

934
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:28,160
Do you realize your grandfather is the first person

935
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:29,680
to say wiener on film?

936
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:31,520
And there's maybe a difference.

937
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,320
That guy should have a poster.

938
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:36,600
First actor to say wiener.

939
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,320
Does like Babe Ruth yell at it

940
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:41,000
when he meets the little rascals?

941
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,560
Did Babe Ruth meet the little rascals?

942
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,600
I believe he did.

943
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:44,440
Really?

944
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,360
I believe a lot of baseball players

945
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:48,320
in the early days of baseball,

946
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:52,240
moonlit in other jobs in the off season

947
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:53,720
because it did not pay enough.

948
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:55,920
Like being in movies you mean?

949
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:59,120
Being in movies or like having a day job.

950
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:01,520
I mean obviously Babe Ruth made a lot of money.

951
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,360
But he would go play.

952
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,920
I'm not seeing any proof that Babe Ruth

953
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,200
was in the little rascals.

954
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,720
I swore he met the little rascals.

955
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,400
I swore I've seen footage of him

956
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,640
meeting the little rascals.

957
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,920
You also just suggested that most baseball players

958
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,560
met the little rascals back then.

959
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:14,400
No, no.

960
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,320
They had to take side work.

961
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:17,560
Like being in the little rascal shorts.

962
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,800
I mean he would go play games in Japan.

963
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:23,240
Like they would put together to play in Japan.

964
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:25,280
But you're saying that he had to make ends meet.

965
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,120
He had to act in a little rascal.

966
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,920
He was a global star.

967
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,920
Like he would get endorsement deals and stuff.

968
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:33,760
But other baseball players would have to get jobs.

969
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,600
It's like the minor leagues.

970
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:37,920
This is just a painting of Babe Ruth with some kids.

971
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,000
Not the little rascals.

972
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,440
I thought we had it here.

973
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,640
It's just someone's painting.

974
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,520
I know I'm seeing an eBay listing

975
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,760
and it has little rascals and Babe Ruth.

976
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,520
But I don't think they're in the same place.

977
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,320
Wait, wait, wait.

978
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,160
Okay, okay.

979
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,000
Hold on, hold on.

980
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,040
Babe Ruth made a cameo appearance in the film Speedy.

981
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:53,880
Wait a minute.

982
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:54,720
That's not a little rascal.

983
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:55,880
Yeah, it'd be called the little rascal.

984
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,520
It'd be called Our Gang Presents.

985
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,520
Lou Gehrig made a cameo appearance

986
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,600
within Babe Ruth's cameo appearance.

987
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,440
What?

988
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,280
Okay, wait.

989
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,480
No, that's just in the film Speedy.

990
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:06,320
Oh my God.

991
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,160
What?

992
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:11,400
It was Babe Ruth in the little rascals.

993
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:14,040
I mean this would have popped up fast, wouldn't it?

994
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:17,040
Babe Ruth, little rascals.

995
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:20,920
Baseball, how about baseball players, little rascals?

996
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:23,360
Jason, did you meet Babe Ruth when you were little?

997
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,960
I need Babe Ruth and forget.

998
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:29,200
Look, stock footage from those fucking,

999
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,320
what's his face, the documentary.

1000
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,160
Okay, Our Gang.

1001
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,000
Here's an Our Gang,

1002
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,400
because we know Our Gang was the name of it

1003
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,720
before the little rascals.

1004
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:36,560
Yeah.

1005
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,520
Okay.

1006
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,880
Giants vs. Yanks.

1007
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:42,920
Hal Roach presents his rascals

1008
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:45,320
in Giants vs. Yanks.

1009
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,280
Okay.

1010
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,120
Hold on.

1011
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,240
You think maybe?

1012
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:52,760
I just have to watch this 28 minute video to see.

1013
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,840
Let's report back on this later.

1014
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,640
Bugle Nose Davis.

1015
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:57,480
What?

1016
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,560
Squealer, his kid brother.

1017
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,480
You found a way to make this an endless episode.

1018
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,800
It's a silent film.

1019
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:06,360
The silent films will have to be announced.

1020
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,280
We should play, yeah,

1021
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,520
we should do more silent film analysis

1022
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,320
on this audio medium.

1023
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:13,040
Okay, so they're at the baseball.

1024
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:16,160
Okay, I think they're not at a real baseball stadium.

1025
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,120
Is it the little rascals or not though?

1026
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,240
Oh, it's Our Gang.

1027
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:20,080
It is Our Gang.

1028
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:20,920
Yeah.

1029
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:21,760
Okay.

1030
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:22,840
And it said his little rascals.

1031
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,680
So whoever created it, the guy's name.

1032
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:26,920
The Ken Burns documentary has a lot of old

1033
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:27,840
black and white footage.

1034
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:30,640
Hal Roach presents his rascals.

1035
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,560
So that's how they were built before they were just

1036
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:34,640
the little rascals.

1037
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:35,600
Okay.

1038
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:38,320
Look, it's not on Babe Ruth's IMDB.

1039
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,160
Scott, this is 100 years old.

1040
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,800
This was 1923.

1041
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:46,040
Like, this is a non-viral tweet.

1042
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,680
Like, wanna feel old?

1043
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:52,320
Do you know his gangs, yanks, and his rascals?

1044
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:55,280
Our gangs, his rascals, yanks.

1045
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,600
Do you realize that's 100 years old?

1046
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:58,600
Yeah.

1047
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:01,920
Yeah, that sounded, I would've guessed 110 years old.

1048
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,320
Okay.

1049
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,440
You're gonna have to find this, Jason, on your own.

1050
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,280
You have to do it?

1051
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:10,600
I'll re-watch the whole Ken Burns all 12 hours.

1052
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,240
Do you think somewhere in Ken Burns baseball,

1053
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:16,240
there's a shot of the little rascals and Babe Ruth together?

1054
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,280
I think so.

1055
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:20,320
Maybe he just met them off, like, not even in a short.

1056
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,160
I mean, it could've been an event or something.

1057
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:23,200
He might've been a big fan of our gang.

1058
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,040
Yeah.

1059
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,440
And he just wanted to meet them.

1060
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,280
Yeah.

1061
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,120
If that happens, Elvis and the Beatles.

1062
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:27,960
They shook.

1063
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:28,840
Elvis and the Beatles met,

1064
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,680
and there wasn't anything big, you know?

1065
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:31,520
Yeah.

1066
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:32,960
There's a photo of it, though.

1067
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:33,800
That's true.

1068
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,480
But there might be a photo on the Ken Burns thing.

1069
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,320
The Yankees.

1070
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,960
Was there a photo when the original Elvis

1071
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:40,400
and the Beatles met, you know?

1072
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,720
Babe Ruth and his gang.

1073
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:46,160
Oh, no, our gang, his rascals.

1074
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,760
His rascals.

1075
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:48,840
Sorry, I'd like the list.

1076
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:50,400
The listeners should just, maybe they already are.

1077
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,600
They're just running through a list,

1078
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:54,120
like, credits in their head of all the rides

1079
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:55,680
we've never talked about.

1080
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,520
As we're yelling about his.

1081
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,200
This is in a theme park, though.

1082
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,040
This is not.

1083
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:00,960
In a theme park.

1084
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,960
This is better than the Munsters.

1085
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,520
It's closer, yeah.

1086
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:06,600
This is in Cali, and you, listener,

1087
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:09,600
can go see these in California Adventure.

1088
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:13,120
You can drag your friends and significant others

1089
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:15,560
behind a wall, because that's where you have to go.

1090
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:17,400
It's kind of like a.

1091
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:21,120
Frank Lloyd Wright inspired designed wall.

1092
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,520
Yes, it's a very good.

1093
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:25,320
I find the bathrooms of high quality,

1094
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:28,280
and they are Frank Lloyd Wright inspired.

1095
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,920
So that's pretty cool.

1096
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,080
They are notable bathrooms, I would say.

1097
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:35,400
And then behind this wall, you can see these characters.

1098
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:38,040
Please tweet at us if you're hanging out with them.

1099
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:40,920
We want to see you trying to make heads or tails

1100
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,320
of America's favorite leading man,

1101
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,160
America's favorite.

1102
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:45,600
And maybe it'll provoke a discussion

1103
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:48,320
with the people you're with in the park.

1104
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,240
Do you think they knew each other?

1105
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:52,760
Did these people kiss?

1106
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,840
Is it possible to be America's favorite leading man

1107
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:55,840
and Hollywood's biggest star?

1108
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:58,120
And the other side of that conversation might be like,

1109
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:01,560
huh, should we, you want to do different things today?

1110
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:04,840
I mean, I would be very interested.

1111
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,440
Yeah, try it and see what happens.

1112
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:08,520
The person could not live on Papa Steve alone.

1113
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:11,520
When you're done looking at Papa Steve, come to these.

1114
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,360
Yeah, that's advanced.

1115
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,720
When I was going through in my head,

1116
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:16,760
what is a more obscure topic than today's topic?

1117
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:19,440
Papa Steve is in there because that's another episode

1118
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,480
about a California adventure poster,

1119
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:24,440
but it's also a real man who lived a life

1120
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:26,280
and we got to talk about his life.

1121
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:29,160
These people are not real.

1122
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,880
They don't have names.

1123
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,720
No one's ever written about this

1124
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,360
or talked about it anywhere.

1125
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,400
There's a good chance that they,

1126
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,960
somebody frantically came into Imagineering one day

1127
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,480
and said, do we have any stock photos

1128
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,720
of actor looking people?

1129
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,560
And they went, I guess they looked it up.

1130
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:43,400
They had two things.

1131
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,600
All right, we need these posters

1132
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:45,920
because it kind of looks blank there.

1133
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,560
Okay, whatever, America blah, blah,

1134
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:49,600
type, type, type, type, type, print out.

1135
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:50,840
That's it.

1136
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:54,560
This might've been not even a full day of stress

1137
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:57,400
in the year 2000 trying to jam this.

1138
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:00,600
This was repurposing two things they may have had.

1139
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,120
Or like drawing over act.

1140
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:05,720
They might've like gotten shots of the people

1141
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:10,000
in the Tower of Terror pre-ride and drawn over them.

1142
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,240
Like, okay, we got to head start.

1143
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:14,360
There's like a girl in a bow and a dress.

1144
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:16,240
Let's just kind of just like age her up

1145
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,760
and then like give the guy a mustache.

1146
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:18,920
Great, print it.

1147
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:19,760
Done.

1148
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:20,580
Yeah.

1149
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:21,420
Because yeah, why not?

1150
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:22,260
Why not?

1151
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:24,920
Imagineers like to make little fun things.

1152
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:26,480
This is really at the heart of like,

1153
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:29,920
I think a lot of this show is thinking,

1154
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:33,000
well, these places are special.

1155
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,920
Someone made this place.

1156
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:38,560
And so every item in the place must have intention

1157
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,600
and it must be special too.

1158
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:41,440
It's ordain.

1159
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:44,440
That's certainly what I assumed when I was younger.

1160
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:46,920
There's a reason for everything.

1161
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:49,000
It's not like the real world where things kind of happen

1162
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,800
haphazard and chaotic,

1163
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,360
but something like this teaches us

1164
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:55,280
that maybe things are haphazard and chaotic

1165
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,360
in that world too.

1166
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:57,480
And maybe even like,

1167
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:00,520
because when budget crunch enters into it

1168
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:03,000
and people just having to get the job done,

1169
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,880
maybe not everything is like a special gift from the heavens

1170
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:09,080
the way the best of Imagineering is.

1171
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:12,000
You know, so I think it was a recent guest,

1172
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Andrew Grissom shared a film critic posted on Instagram.

1173
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:22,760
Like, you know, people asked me about writing about movies

1174
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:24,960
and what is your thought process?

1175
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:27,680
And they came up with like three C's.

1176
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:31,160
It's like, all right, what context was this happening in?

1177
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:32,160
What is the content?

1178
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:34,360
What were the filmmakers trying to say?

1179
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:36,720
And like everything they think about when a movie,

1180
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:40,000
like what are the messages intended or otherwise?

1181
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,440
And Jason, I think what you're thinking you're remembering

1182
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,480
is what I said about the Transformers ride.

1183
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:46,840
That's what I was thinking you're remembering.

1184
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:51,840
But I saw this like around the same period of days

1185
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,760
when I was thinking about this episode

1186
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:57,080
and I started to apply these ideas to this poster.

1187
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:57,920
Oh.

1188
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:58,760
And it's like, what are we,

1189
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:00,760
what is this communicating to us?

1190
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:02,160
What is this meant to communicate?

1191
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,680
Is it just meant to be,

1192
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,320
because you kind of go in and out of the bathroom

1193
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:09,560
pretty quickly, it's just meant to be a fleeting touch.

1194
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:12,600
Did they ever think that anyone would really focus on this

1195
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:14,320
for 45 minutes to an hour?

1196
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:15,280
Yeah, yeah.

1197
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:18,800
And it's now what people are doing with this episode.

1198
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,200
They're going, well, what is the content?

1199
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:22,040
What were the hosts going through?

1200
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:22,880
Who is it for?

1201
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:27,040
How brazen were they that they thought this would be,

1202
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:29,880
this could be something to talk about for what,

1203
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:31,800
or are they not in a good place?

1204
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:36,800
Are they, should I be concerned about these podcast hosts?

1205
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:38,960
Are they unraveling after five years?

1206
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:39,880
I felt great.

1207
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:41,320
I honestly, I was doing this

1208
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:43,440
and like the scary tree simultaneously

1209
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:46,320
and I was having a ball working on these episodes.

1210
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:48,640
I think you would put these posters up in your house.

1211
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:49,480
I would.

1212
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:53,520
I did go to eBay and Etsy to try and find,

1213
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:57,680
because so many people now with decent like printers,

1214
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:59,880
you can just print out like a poster.

1215
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:02,240
If you've got a good photo of it, even on like an iPhone,

1216
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:04,360
you could potentially get a little print made up probably.

1217
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:05,880
I could blow it up and frame it.

1218
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:08,760
Well, what we need to do is put you

1219
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:11,360
in the favorite leading man.

1220
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:13,840
Like somebody, I mean, I'll ask somebody,

1221
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:14,680
I'm not gonna do it.

1222
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:17,400
Someone in the audience, if you wanna put Jason

1223
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:19,280
in that leading man poster,

1224
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:20,480
just give him a little mustache.

1225
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:22,040
America's favorite sweetheart.

1226
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:27,040
What a thing I like to think of and I don't think,

1227
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:28,640
I'm like, this is a fantasy of mine.

1228
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:31,120
I like to imagine because of the time

1229
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:34,760
that these had to be approved by Michael Eisner.

1230
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:35,600
Yeah, possibly.

1231
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:37,880
They had to go across his desk and he had to go, great.

1232
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:39,560
Yeah. Great, moving on.

1233
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:43,760
And maybe the kind of limited information

1234
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:46,120
as with our 45th president,

1235
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:50,440
he just wants to see colors and only a few words

1236
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:51,480
because he's very busy,

1237
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:53,960
because we're doing things like you wouldn't believe.

1238
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:56,440
And maybe that's where Eisner was at too.

1239
00:44:56,440 --> 00:45:00,960
So these have the USA Today effect of just like, no, don't.

1240
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:02,960
Maybe there was more information.

1241
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:04,440
Maybe they named these people.

1242
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:06,080
Maybe there was a big backstory and somebody was like,

1243
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:07,440
no, it's never gonna get approved.

1244
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:08,840
Yeah, Michael's gonna get stressed.

1245
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:10,600
He's gonna get confused.

1246
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:12,320
He's gonna say, I don't know who that is.

1247
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:13,320
I don't know who that is.

1248
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:16,000
This might be like a litmus test.

1249
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,280
Like if you're saying show it to Eisner,

1250
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:20,400
but what if we could show it to like people

1251
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:21,760
who were imaginary, you say,

1252
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:24,640
if we show this to Tony Baxter or we showed this

1253
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:28,000
to Bob Weiss and just said, do you know what this is?

1254
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,080
Oh, that's interesting.

1255
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:29,920
Yeah. Yeah.

1256
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:30,760
And what does this mean to you?

1257
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:33,960
Tony probably not because he wasn't around so much for that.

1258
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:36,040
I don't sense a lot of him in California Adventure.

1259
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:37,080
I wouldn't be shocked though,

1260
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:39,920
if he like knows every fucking square inch of everything.

1261
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:40,920
That's very true. Yeah.

1262
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:43,320
And has like tells you like, here's an hour.

1263
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:44,960
He would do like an hour just on like

1264
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:46,840
how we could fix the poster.

1265
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:48,520
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1266
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:51,120
I would be excited to like, yeah.

1267
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:54,680
Or a roadie, like anybody, you know, please.

1268
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:57,120
Cause like it'd be amazing if someone commented on these.

1269
00:45:57,120 --> 00:46:01,840
Also another guy, very eloquent at expanding ideas outwards

1270
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:04,400
and like really honing in on stuff.

1271
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:06,080
You know, it's funny what you just said about Eisner

1272
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:07,360
that he gets confused.

1273
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:12,040
I sent you guys one shot from a Lilo and Stitch

1274
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:13,960
oral history. It might've been Vulture.

1275
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:15,320
I apologize if it wasn't Vulture.

1276
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:17,800
I don't know where it was, but that I, what did,

1277
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:21,480
I sent you guys the part about how Katzenberg wanted to make

1278
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:22,320
Oh yeah. I forgot to read the story.

1279
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:24,080
West Side story, but with cats.

1280
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:26,240
Yeah. And they set up and we wanted to do it

1281
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:27,840
with Leonard Bernstein.

1282
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:28,680
Bernstein.

1283
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:30,040
It's Bernstein.

1284
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:32,440
And so they flew out and did a big presentation.

1285
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:34,360
And then it became clear like, oh, he just sent people.

1286
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:37,280
He's not even here and they don't want to do this at all.

1287
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:39,360
And this is a big fiasco.

1288
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:42,560
The only instance of poor Katzenberg judgment

1289
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:43,400
I could think of.

1290
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:44,240
Sure.

1291
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:47,840
But basically there was another part of it where

1292
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:50,160
they really wanted to make Lilo and Stitch away

1293
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:53,360
from Eisner's influence because the,

1294
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:55,160
one of the directors, one of the main people involved was

1295
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:56,520
like, I know what happens when,

1296
00:46:56,520 --> 00:47:00,200
and you have to do these fucking screenings and you end up

1297
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:02,760
just like, basically they told a story where he was clearly

1298
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:07,200
like so, so stressed in 94 and they're screening the Lion King

1299
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:12,520
for Eisner and he, he's watching the movie and then he just

1300
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:15,880
like looks down and he just looks down for a while.

1301
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:18,040
I don't know, not his phone at the time, but just like,

1302
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:20,320
or maybe he was doing something, but he clearly had so much

1303
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:22,800
on his plate that he looked down and then looked back up

1304
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:24,640
and missed a whole scene of the movie.

1305
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:28,920
What he looked down for was Mufasa appearing in the clouds.

1306
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:33,520
So then the film, he entirely did not ever have eyes

1307
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:35,000
on cloud Mufasa.

1308
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:37,280
So when the movie ended and everybody's giving notes,

1309
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:39,800
he's like, I mean, what happened with,

1310
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:41,480
we felt like I just didn't connect that like,

1311
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:45,480
what made him want to go back and save the kingdom?

1312
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:47,640
Well, when the Mufasa appeared,

1313
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:49,080
well, I didn't get that at all.

1314
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:50,880
I don't think you communicated that.

1315
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:54,600
Which is like a window into, we actually think Eisner is

1316
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:57,480
like kind of a sharp, he did things that we like.

1317
00:47:57,480 --> 00:48:00,800
So we think of him as a good executive and that happened.

1318
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:05,440
Yeah, to further that excerpt is from,

1319
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:07,880
there is an oral history, there's a whole book

1320
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:10,840
about the making of Lilo and Stitch that is newly out.

1321
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:11,680
That's all from the book.

1322
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:13,280
So that's from the book.

1323
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:16,760
So that makes me go, well, what was the fucking production

1324
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:19,920
of Lilo's Stitch like that they got a book out of it?

1325
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:21,240
I never considered it.

1326
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:22,840
The whole point of it becomes, all right,

1327
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:26,280
if you go do it cheap and in Florida where nobody's watching

1328
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:28,280
they still had the studio tour,

1329
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:30,960
the theme park adjacent studio.

1330
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:32,640
And to where it was by the time,

1331
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:34,640
when Eisner would just go like,

1332
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:35,640
what's this Lilo and Stitch thing?

1333
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:36,760
Oh, it's gonna be cool, you'll like it.

1334
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:39,120
As opposed to having to run every beat of it by him,

1335
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:40,640
which would have fucked up the movie.

1336
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:43,560
Yeah, I saw another notable thing.

1337
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:45,440
I never, it never dawned on me,

1338
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:47,880
but now I can perfectly see it from like the stills

1339
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:50,880
they posted was like the first Disney movie in a long time

1340
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:53,200
that had watercolor backgrounds.

1341
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:54,040
Oh yeah, yeah.

1342
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:55,120
And if you look at it, it's like, oh yeah,

1343
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:57,680
that is really beautiful and striking.

1344
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:00,320
This is kind of watercolor, these posters.

1345
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:01,520
It kind of is. A little bit, yes.

1346
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:06,240
Or it's like Photoshop 99, whatever.

1347
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:07,800
A watercolor filter.

1348
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:12,120
I think there's one challenge that we should take on

1349
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:15,160
because if we are like, we're grabbing this IP,

1350
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:19,160
we're fleshing it out more than the Imagineers cared to

1351
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:21,520
or got to and we can apply to it

1352
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:24,280
kind of anything that we want.

1353
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:27,400
I think a big thing, I think they need names.

1354
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:29,920
I think we could be the first to name them.

1355
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:32,080
And I don't want to put you on the spot,

1356
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:34,200
but maybe if we all just hover around,

1357
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:37,760
if we stare at them and just kind of

1358
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:39,160
toss some words around.

1359
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:40,360
Well, here's what I think.

1360
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:42,080
And you guys tell me if you think I'm wrong.

1361
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:44,400
I think we should be as lazy as they were

1362
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:45,800
in making the copy.

1363
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:50,240
So I say Rita Garland and Carrie Butler.

1364
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:52,680
I think that's good.

1365
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:54,720
And that is, that is you.

1366
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:55,760
Carrie Butler.

1367
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:58,680
You read about movie stars where it's like,

1368
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:01,200
yeah, his real name was Ronald Mush.

1369
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:04,200
And they changed his name to Carrie Grant.

1370
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:05,720
They would just come up with like,

1371
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:08,320
oh, we're not gonna call you Rebecca Claude.

1372
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:11,920
No, your name is now Gloria Graham.

1373
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:15,880
I like that your format is half of actress's real names

1374
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:19,320
and then one and then the other one is actor and character.

1375
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:20,160
That's true.

1376
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:21,000
That's true.

1377
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:21,880
That's true.

1378
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:27,480
Which you could, you know, it could be Rita Gale.

1379
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:28,320
Sure.

1380
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:31,400
But I don't know, I do like the laziness of Garland.

1381
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:32,400
Certainly.

1382
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:35,480
You could go, yeah, you could say like.

1383
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:36,880
Nathaniel King.

1384
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:39,040
Young King.

1385
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:40,240
Sure, okay.

1386
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:43,600
I mean, I don't see any reason though,

1387
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:46,120
at the end of the day to not go with what you said,

1388
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:47,760
because in the spirit of,

1389
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:49,400
you're right with the thought exercise

1390
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:50,840
of doing it like them.

1391
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:54,160
So now you know, America's favorite leading man,

1392
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:57,840
Kerry Butler is Hollywood's biggest star

1393
00:50:57,840 --> 00:51:01,000
and America's favorite sweetheart, Rita Garland,

1394
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,240
is Hollywood's biggest star.

1395
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:05,400
Yeah, right.

1396
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:08,240
And they don't make them like that anymore.

1397
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:09,680
Don't make them like they used to.

1398
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:10,680
They never will again.

1399
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:13,360
Oh boy, Hollywood peaked in 1930.

1400
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:16,680
Blah, all the numbers just merged together

1401
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:19,600
because this does not exist in a specific year.

1402
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:20,440
Right.

1403
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:21,680
If you could hear them walk by you,

1404
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:25,920
you would hear any amount of like liquid squishing

1405
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:28,680
in a bottle or pills clacking together.

1406
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:29,720
What was that first word?

1407
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:30,560
Liquid.

1408
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:31,400
Oh, liquid.

1409
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:32,240
I just thought you were using.

1410
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:33,600
I kind of got a little tongue tied

1411
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:36,000
and tried to rush past it.

1412
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,280
Like I'm a cover reporter trying to make his copy deadline.

1413
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:41,440
I thought you were like imitating.

1414
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:43,920
Like sloshing or something.

1415
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:44,880
Are we done?

1416
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:49,720
Can we be, this cannot be over an hour, right?

1417
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:51,160
We're not over an hour yet.

1418
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:52,000
No.

1419
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:52,840
Okay, well great.

1420
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:53,680
Yeah, we could be done.

1421
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:55,480
Jason, do you have any other thoughts though?

1422
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:58,080
I think listeners, if you have any stories

1423
00:51:58,080 --> 00:51:58,920
about these posters,

1424
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:00,760
if you know anything about the creation.

1425
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:02,240
They do not.

1426
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:03,200
Stories.

1427
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:06,520
I mean, look, you go with friends

1428
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:08,520
or you go with partners or family members

1429
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:10,640
and you're like, oh, we got to take a picture next to that.

1430
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:12,800
Surely there must be someone out there going like,

1431
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:15,400
I got to get a picture next to Hollywood's leading man.

1432
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:17,160
If we just nudge this a little longer though,

1433
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:19,760
Jason, who would you say your favorite leading man

1434
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:20,600
of all time is

1435
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:22,600
and your favorite America sweetheart is of all time?

1436
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:24,440
What's his face?

1437
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:26,440
Who I bought the bucket from.

1438
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:29,520
I always forget it now.

1439
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:32,120
Robert Blake.

1440
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:37,520
What's the, what is the guy?

1441
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:38,600
Speaking of our gang.

1442
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:39,880
Tom, Tom, Shadow of the Dead.

1443
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:43,960
Tom, Cotton, Joseph Cotton.

1444
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:45,160
I love Joseph Cotton, isn't that?

1445
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:46,720
He's your leading man though?

1446
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:48,800
He was a leading man a number of roles.

1447
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:50,080
He's leading man, third man.

1448
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:52,400
He's the leading kind of the sinister leading man

1449
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:54,040
in Shadow of the Downs.

1450
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:56,640
Just to do, let's take score.

1451
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:59,880
In the recent past, you forgot your favorite ice cream place

1452
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:02,000
ever on Disney property.

1453
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:05,160
You forgot the name of your favorite actor of all time.

1454
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:06,000
Yeah.

1455
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:11,280
The sands keep moving through the hourglass.

1456
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:12,720
I don't know what to tell you.

1457
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:15,800
Here's a question.

1458
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:18,040
What's your favorite name of you?

1459
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:21,080
What's your favorite name that is your name?

1460
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:21,920
Jason?

1461
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:22,760
I guess I'm okay.

1462
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:23,600
You're fine, you're fine.

1463
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:25,520
Scott, do you have an answer for this?

1464
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:27,040
Oh yeah, no, my favorite,

1465
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:31,480
like of all time leading man of sweet.

1466
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:34,440
I'd have to go Florence Pugh and Harry Styles.

1467
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:36,400
Okay.

1468
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:39,480
Harry, traditional, traditionally good looking.

1469
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:40,640
I do like Florence Pugh.

1470
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:41,800
I think she's terrific actor,

1471
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:44,640
makes very interesting choices for the roles she takes.

1472
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:47,200
I didn't see the movie.

1473
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:50,160
Oh, I haven't seen that one yet.

1474
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:51,880
I haven't seen that one yet.

1475
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:53,520
Do you have a favorite, Mike?

1476
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:55,640
Cary Grant and Jennifer Love Hewitt.

1477
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:57,440
Is that right?

1478
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:01,560
That would be an interesting pairing.

1479
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:02,400
I'm not saying they're paired,

1480
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:04,600
I'm just saying they're two different eras.

1481
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:06,920
Those are my two tops.

1482
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:08,320
I'm not sure that Jennifer Love Hewitt

1483
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:11,240
was ever America's favorite sweetheart or Hollywood's,

1484
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:12,800
certainly not Hollywood's biggest star.

1485
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:14,640
For sure, magazine cover where Jennifer Love Hewitt

1486
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:16,480
was referred to as a sweetheart.

1487
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:17,960
A sweet, that's not what I said.

1488
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:19,360
I said America's favorite.

1489
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:20,840
All right, we're gonna find this.

1490
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:22,840
I'm gonna get this thing over now or if it kills me.

1491
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:24,360
Oh come on, God damn.

1492
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:26,680
Well, hey, oh, well look at the sword I can wield

1493
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:27,520
is ending it.

1494
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:29,120
You survived.

1495
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:31,080
You survived, I guess, the ride.

1496
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:32,320
The segregated wish.

1497
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:33,640
Thank you for subscribing.

1498
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:35,280
And I'm gonna barrel through,

1499
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:37,200
just keep subscribing and go to the club three,

1500
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:38,480
you get bonus.

1501
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:39,760
We're gonna talk about Kingdom Hearts over there.

1502
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:41,520
Oh shit, there's a maxim with Jennifer Love Hewitt

1503
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:44,160
where it says America's sweetheart has a naughty secret.

1504
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:46,200
But that's not quite America's favorite.

1505
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:48,040
It doesn't say America's favorite.

1506
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:49,440
Well, she's all America's favorite sweetheart

1507
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:50,280
because I really like her movies.

1508
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:52,120
Jason, look at him.

1509
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:52,960
Jason.

1510
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,200
The proof is just that anyone ever wrote it down.

1511
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:58,440
Because if that's the proof,

1512
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:00,440
then we're all America's favorite.

1513
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:03,720
Like then Jason is America's favorite sweetheart.

1514
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:04,560
Well, of course he is.

1515
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:07,000
Well, I'm podcasting his little sweetheart.

1516
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
That's true, can't argue with that.

1517
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,960
I hate how much people are gonna start saying that.

1518
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,560
That's gonna be fucking everywhere in the comments.

1519
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:17,160
Here you go, fam.

1520
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:18,880
Start using it.

1521
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:19,720
Oh man.

1522
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:20,720
Wait, we're done.

1523
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:21,920
We're done, get stuck.

1524
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:24,000
All right, I'll turn it off.

1525
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,040
Looking on your phone.

1526
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:26,080
55 minutes.

1527
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:26,920
Yeah.
