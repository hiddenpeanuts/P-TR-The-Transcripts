1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:01,560
Forever.

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:03,560
Dog.

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:10,760
When your town has made you frown.

4
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:14,480
When your square has made you swear.

5
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:19,060
When life gives you one more punch.

6
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:24,120
You need a doughnut soaked in Captain Grunge.

7
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:27,780
You need a place, a place to stroll.

8
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:29,760
With alcohol.

9
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:33,780
A place that features part of the Berlin Wall.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,780
Where steampunk robots sell chocolate snacks.

11
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:41,760
A place where you can tattoo your lower back.

12
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:43,880
So let's go take a walk.

13
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:49,100
Let's all go to City Walk Orlando.

14
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:50,460
Tonight.

15
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:51,940
Tonight.

16
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:02,520
A daily, extremely necessary series.

17
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:06,260
Exploring the shops, restaurants, and cosmic wonder.

18
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:09,400
That make up Universal City Walk Orlando.

19
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,140
Welcome to Podcast the Ride the City Walk Orlando Saga.

20
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:14,300
Multiverse of madness.

21
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,260
I'm Scott Gardner.

22
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,360
There's Mike Carlson.

23
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,000
Yo, yo.

24
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:18,080
There's Jason Sheridan.

25
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:24,100
We just got to, you know, put a pace on this.

26
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:28,320
But also I want to get as quickly as possible to our special guest today.

27
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:30,520
Returning to the show after not too long.

28
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:37,500
A collaborator with previous Saga guest Evan Susser on Villain Con Minion Blast at Universal Studios Florida.

29
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:38,640
It's Van Robichow.

30
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:39,040
Hello.

31
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,100
Hey, it's really great to be here.

32
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,100
Hey, Van.

33
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:42,900
Hi, Van.

34
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:46,500
Just another normal appearance by me on a podcast.

35
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:50,400
Nothing peculiar going on at all that the audience can't see.

36
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,420
No, yes.

37
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:57,570
You're just hearing things like normal and it's not as if there is an item in the room that is pulling all the focus in the world.

38
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,280
Would you care to or would you rather not acknowledge it?

39
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:09,340
Would you rather like is this your part of like making this day to day to like, you know, why does it have to be the center of the tension?

40
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,180
I agree.

41
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:15,860
So just so for those who aren't here, I am I am wearing an Apple Vision Pro headset.

42
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:19,420
It's my first podcast in one.

43
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:20,120
Oh, wow.

44
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:20,740
So really.

45
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:22,260
Yeah, you're welcome.

46
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:22,800
You're welcome.

47
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,240
It's an experimental series.

48
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,860
So I think a good time to do an experimental move.

49
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:34,400
And yeah, I I feel I feel a little strange in it.

50
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:34,960
OK.

51
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:44,920
As a warm up for it with my good friend, Evan Susser earlier today, I did an hour and a half Zoom call and writing session with him while in the headset.

52
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:52,440
So I'm kind of used to talking to people in it right now, which I was I was worried I wouldn't be.

53
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:59,320
And so I forced Evan to deal with me wearing it like an idiot to help us in a way.

54
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,700
Yeah, no, it's all for the all for the content.

55
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,200
That's good.

56
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:05,780
Well, you know, Susser, I think, needs to do more to help us.

57
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:06,460
Yeah, for sure.

58
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:06,820
Give it away.

59
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:07,700
Everything's gone.

60
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:08,180
Yeah.

61
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:08,700
Oh, you know what?

62
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,880
That being said, Susser picked up.

63
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:16,100
We're watching wrestling and Susser picked up food for my family the other day that he wasn't even part of.

64
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:16,640
Wow.

65
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,280
So he helped my family out.

66
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,980
He doesn't need to help more.

67
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:21,120
Well, all right.

68
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,380
So that covers you.

69
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:22,620
Yeah.

70
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:23,760
What happens to Jason?

71
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:24,540
Oh, fair enough.

72
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:25,540
You guys didn't get helped.

73
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,820
Oh, he can pick me up food whenever.

74
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:28,340
OK.

75
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,220
That's OK.

76
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,880
He can even pick you up.

77
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:31,280
Sure.

78
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:32,860
He probably can.

79
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:39,080
But so now you were we're we're talking to you.

80
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:48,880
You know, I feel like a lot of the podcast guest connection does need to come from, you know, looking somebody in the eye and, you know, sharing moments and points and.

81
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:55,360
Well, thank goodness for the persona feature so that you can see a simulacrum of my eyes in front of my face.

82
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:55,960
Yeah.

83
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,240
And that's what it is.

84
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:02,360
It's not because what I'm seeing is sometimes I'm seeing eyes that are blinking and then I'm also seeing like a throbbing.

85
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,440
Yeah, I saw that.

86
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,340
White light.

87
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:08,060
Well, I think the throbbing white light might be because I'm recording you guys.

88
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,980
Oh, that's the.

89
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:10,380
All right.

90
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:12,100
That's like the red flashing button on the camera.

91
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:14,900
This is a way to let people know you aren't just like discreetly.

92
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:15,140
Yeah.

93
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:18,680
And then what you're seeing is a simulation of my eyes.

94
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,980
The blinks are accurate to my actual blinking.

95
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,240
They're synced up.

96
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:24,680
Yes.

97
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:24,920
Yes.

98
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:26,880
So none of these are manufactured blinks.

99
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,380
No, these are all genuine blinks.

100
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,760
They're genuine eye movements.

101
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:30,840
Oh, my God.

102
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,580
That's all a recreation of the actual physical movement.

103
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:34,540
Yes, that's correct.

104
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:37,660
The headset itself is largely controlled by eye movement.

105
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:43,920
And so there are cameras pointed at both of my eyes carefully tracking the location of my pupils.

106
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:47,800
And it uses that information to recreate my face on the front of the screen.

107
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,300
Hmm.

108
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:52,380
Can you can you add any like cosmetic adjustments to it with the visuals?

109
00:04:52,380 --> 00:05:00,480
Well, you know, there doesn't seem to be any kind of enforcement of the face you scan when you first set it up being your own.

110
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:08,800
So I think we're going to find a whole new new way to is it manatee Teo people?

111
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:09,560
Was that his name?

112
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:09,980
Man.

113
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:10,660
Man.

114
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:10,660
Man.

115
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,240
Teo.

116
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:11,700
Yeah.

117
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,220
The catfish football playing gentleman.

118
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:15,600
Right.

119
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:15,900
Right.

120
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:24,640
Because I could scan someone else and then do FaceTime calls as them with this persona and it would sync up to my eyes.

121
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,740
But and mouth.

122
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,580
But it wouldn't be me.

123
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:34,140
When I first got the headset last week, I hadn't shaved in like a week and I was looking kind of ragged.

124
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:40,680
And I scanned myself for the persona and I was like, whoa, I got to go shave because I look like a mess in here.

125
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:49,280
And so my other prediction based on this is the way people now are like, I got to get in shape for my beach body for the summer.

126
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:55,380
People are going to start to want getting in shape before their scan for their consumer device.

127
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,100
The show is a simulacrum of them.

128
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:58,900
They'll be locked into that.

129
00:05:58,900 --> 00:05:59,240
Yeah.

130
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,160
That is how people will see them.

131
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:06,860
And you can't there must be some program, though, where you can like shave or shave.

132
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:11,480
All it'll allow me to do currently now, granted, Apple says the persona feature is in beta.

133
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:15,040
It will allow me to put virtual eyeglasses on myself.

134
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:19,620
However, it does not let me make any kind of modifications to the scan.

135
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:21,200
It's just what you get when you scan it.

136
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,120
You can kind of like make a little slider.

137
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:28,040
Like if you look too red to kind of like pull that down, things like that to adjust for the lighting in the room.

138
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:28,500
OK.

139
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:31,400
But you can't like cosmetically alter yourself.

140
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,140
And those are like functional glasses.

141
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:34,980
They aren't like in a previous sector.

142
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:39,340
Ian Rickabani talked about his kids getting like glowing glasses.

143
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,660
Was that at from Bubba Gump or somewhere else?

144
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:46,140
Yeah, no fun versions of the optional glasses that I could see.

145
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:50,580
They all seems like something they could largely functional.

146
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:52,000
I don't mean to be like finding holes.

147
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:55,360
You're you're we're wearing and demonstrating incredible technology.

148
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,100
And here I am going, yeah, I'm happy to take credit for it as well.

149
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,000
Oh, sure.

150
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:02,460
Is there a podcast app on?

151
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:03,140
Yes, there is.

152
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:09,200
Yes, I could pull up past episodes and review them while we're talking.

153
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:18,560
This could be good because we have a lot of these moments of like misremembering something that have been said or like feeling like, you know, like a story is retold.

154
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,600
It's been told before.

155
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:23,520
This could be very helpful to us to be able not that we couldn't do it on our regular computers.

156
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:28,360
Yeah, but this seems more efficient maybe to like insta pull up a previous joke.

157
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:49,540
Joking aside about it, I actually do think it has actual useful potential in the world of like editing content and things like that, because I can pull up like monitors and stuff and watch videos from multiple sources and things in different like virtual screens all over.

158
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:56,660
Basically, like it's like a camera truck on my face if I needed to be, which haven't we all dreamed of a camera truck on our faces?

159
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,900
We can all film Super Bowls whenever we want.

160
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:01,620
Video Village in your sunglasses.

161
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:02,780
That's right.

162
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:03,980
All right.

163
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:06,380
And you are you're filming this right now.

164
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:14,220
Is this is it possible for you to release what I'm saying your point of view of me right now in some form for listeners to see?

165
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:40,720
Yes, not only will I release it, I will be releasing it in full immersive video so that anyone with 3D television or any 3D capable device, even a god forbid a meta quest three, two or pro, will be able to watch the first 10 minutes of this podcast in an immersive, fully dimensional vans POV way.

166
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,600
Did the meta quest, did they ever get legs working?

167
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,320
They said legs were coming.

168
00:08:45,320 --> 00:09:03,360
You know, I believe an unreleased beta does finally have full torsos and motion captured arms before they were estimating elbow positions and shoulder positions.

169
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:09,960
So they've made it all the way down to the to the hips, but they're still still not below.

170
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:27,000
It's tough because so the Apple vision pro here has lots of cameras and sensors on the front, but there are downward pointing cameras right here, which is how it's able to do stuff with my hands when my hands are down here.

171
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,460
And also, I think it gets some of the lip movement stuff for my persona from that.

172
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:38,920
And there are no downward facing cameras on any of the meta quest products.

173
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:46,720
And so they legs has to be entirely like estimated based on what the rest of your body is doing.

174
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,040
And so it's a hard problem that they haven't been able to solve.

175
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,180
They've got all their engineers on legs, though.

176
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,020
It does seem like this, but somewhere in the full weight of the former Facebook company.

177
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,920
It's like between all that, they should be able to figure out legs.

178
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,620
They've put in 20 billion dollars into R&D on their devices.

179
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,860
And I got to imagine they put at least two billion dollars into legs.

180
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:13,920
Well, and so, you know, money can't buy legs, as they say.

181
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:17,100
Maybe prosthetics.

182
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:23,560
I think Salkerberg either said it or tweeted it like legs are on the way.

183
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:28,000
Yes, there was a tweet that legs were coming, but we've yet to see them.

184
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:34,400
They did get in some trouble a few years back where they showed legs in a presentation.

185
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:37,260
It came out that those were simulated legs.

186
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:43,700
Those were post effect legs that were not actual live legs.

187
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:52,240
I'm a little concerned about where all this is going, because this whole series is about going and visiting a place,

188
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,720
and getting down and dirty in a place, and doing everything at the place.

189
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,700
And it's all about physical experiences.

190
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:03,940
And if we're able in the future to just scan our city walks,

191
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:11,100
then sure, it's great that we can all go to one virtually any time, but then what happens to the real one?

192
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,480
And then people aren't spending money at the real one.

193
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:16,800
I look forward to a world of augmented city walks.

194
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:18,040
Okay, yeah.

195
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:20,060
That's a better vision, yes.

196
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:31,780
You know, for example, we touched briefly on some of the restrictions that occur between Universal and Disney

197
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:38,200
with respect to the Marvel properties, and how you won't see the word Marvel anywhere in Disney World.

198
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:48,440
Perhaps, since their contract didn't anticipate this, could I see the word Marvel augmented on top of things at Disney World through my Vision Pro?

199
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:49,820
Perhaps I could.

200
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:50,480
Wow.

201
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,920
I think that's not conceived of by that contract.

202
00:11:54,980 --> 00:12:03,620
And I think the next thing you know, you could be at downtown Disney, and you could see a big Marvel sign saying Marvel merchandise in here,

203
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:04,920
because you can't see that now.

204
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:05,320
Right.

205
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:05,740
Wow.

206
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:09,420
Yeah, it's like an entire universe on top of our universe.

207
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:09,920
That's right.

208
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:14,480
And how can they have anticipated that in that tiny contract in the late 90s?

209
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:28,160
Plus, I think what's great about sort of a VR or metaverse city walk is that probably those goggles can make you sick at any moment.

210
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:29,520
So it'll be fine.

211
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,980
It'll just be eating at city walk.

212
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,040
Oh, sure.

213
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:32,580
Yeah, yeah.

214
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,240
You can maybe get the sickness done.

215
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,700
You don't need the food.

216
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,020
You don't need the food anymore.

217
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,320
I mean, that's kind of an innovative thing.

218
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,140
Not having to eat the food is an upgrade.

219
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:44,020
I am curious about if that would have been an upgrade for your experience.

220
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:55,080
I do feel like, because if you're going to shut off this feed, the immersive reality feed at some point, first of all, I'd like to say it almost does feel like this is maybe the chance for the listeners to feel what it's like to be on the show.

221
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:56,720
So maybe we should simulate that.

222
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:01,080
They're going to have to plug in their own name or do some AI scan of my voice.

223
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:01,580
Should we do a quick like…

224
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:02,840
That could be, yeah.

225
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:05,900
Is it like, well, I feel like if I go…

226
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:15,080
Well, you just like turned everybody, but let me start by saying like, and our guest today is one of the greatest, the greatest guest we've ever had.

227
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:18,960
I don't know how it took so long to get you on the show.

228
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:20,520
Thanks for being here.

229
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:23,420
Wow.

230
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:28,960
Are you so much more excited about this guest than any guest we've ever had before?

231
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,600
This guest is the most exciting guest of all the times.

232
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,200
Are you the most excited about this guest?

233
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,320
This guest?

234
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:37,280
Yeah.

235
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,160
You.

236
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,360
We're excited.

237
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:41,580
You're here.

238
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,000
Whoa.

239
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,020
I'm so excited.

240
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:43,940
I'm tipping over.

241
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:44,860
Whoa.

242
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,160
Oh, sorry.

243
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:47,980
That was an accident.

244
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,060
That wasn't me trying to kiss you or anything.

245
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:51,760
Let's not get into that territory.

246
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,720
I just accidentally fell in your direction.

247
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:56,280
Maybe we should kiss this guest right now.

248
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:59,440
The first guest we have all ever wanted to kiss at the same time.

249
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,820
We should all kiss together in a four way.

250
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,200
And scene.

251
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:05,780
All right, we'll cut that.

252
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:10,260
Listeners, you should know we're all doing a lot of like pointing and things in the direction of the Vision Pro.

253
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:15,860
And you should have, oh, you did a little like, what's the word, minority report.

254
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,060
Oh my God.

255
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:17,880
Okay.

256
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:20,080
Well, this is all very exciting.

257
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:20,420
Yeah.

258
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:29,420
But you know, the only thing that's maybe a little bit more interesting than this like new universe of tech is contact with the metaphysical,

259
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:33,520
and that is what we that is what we are able to bring in this series only.

260
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:39,420
So let's check in really briefly and get our official assignment today from the Sector Keeper.

261
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:47,220
Boys, boys and then face six sector three is Bob Marley, a tribute to freedom.

262
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:50,560
Pat O'Brien's and City Walk's rising star.

263
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,420
Good luck, boys and then.

264
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,080
Okay, there we have it.

265
00:14:56,080 --> 00:15:03,260
So we're kind of we're deep into the the nightlife portion, I would say, of the of the saga.

266
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:09,160
And, you know, these are kind of the upstairs clubs that we're dealing with.

267
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:17,600
First question, Susser, who was the guinea pig with your hand movements are insane.

268
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:18,360
What is this?

269
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:18,960
Are you playing?

270
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,900
Are you picking cards out of a file machine?

271
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:28,080
I'm scrolling through my camera roll to get to my photographs of my dinner at the restaurant.

272
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,620
I mean, that's good.

273
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:34,540
Only you're the only guest who's really able to literally go back while we do it.

274
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:39,180
But OK, but so I'm curious if we're going back to a positive or a negative memory for you,

275
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:45,040
because Susser, your collaborator, was kind of put out, I think, by we did.

276
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:46,720
Look, we of course, we pounced on him.

277
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,800
We asked like, you're going to be down there working on Villain Con.

278
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:50,400
You got to go.

279
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:52,060
Please go do something at CityWalk.

280
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:54,880
And it was a little bit calamitous for him.

281
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,200
We did the same for you.

282
00:15:56,400 --> 00:16:02,260
How would you characterize the evening in general that resulted in our hounding you to go there?

283
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,040
I had a wonderful evening.

284
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:05,180
OK, all right.

285
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:09,500
I had just gotten in to Orlando.

286
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:14,800
I was visiting the ride under construction for the first time.

287
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,920
I had meetings in the morning, but nothing to do that night.

288
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:23,220
So I was staying on property at the.

289
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,020
Not the Sapphire Falls.

290
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:27,160
What's the other one?

291
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:28,020
Royal Pacific.

292
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,760
Or maybe I was the staff.

293
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:31,280
No, I was at the Sapphire Falls.

294
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,800
And so there's a boat right there.

295
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,100
Takes you right to CityWalk.

296
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:35,660
Of course.

297
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:36,100
Yeah.

298
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:37,360
So I hopped on the boat.

299
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:39,440
I've got video of the boat ride right here.

300
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,120
I'm looking at right now.

301
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,280
Oh, man, I'm so jealous.

302
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,460
I want to be right here.

303
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:47,820
I am going right by the plane that's in the in the water.

304
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:52,640
Not the Jimmy Buffett plane, but the plane that you pass where like all the other boats in the river.

305
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:58,940
Here I am coming under the bridge, seeing the reveal of Toothsums Factory.

306
00:16:59,160 --> 00:16:59,700
Oh, wow.

307
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:06,640
You know, I couldn't have said this at the time, but I can now say Toothsums appears in the VillainCon ride in the final scene.

308
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:07,700
Oh, yeah, yeah.

309
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:08,280
Right.

310
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:10,200
CityWalk pulled into it.

311
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,140
You're in the park, but watching CityWalk?

312
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:15,020
That was a pitch from Evan and I to have that happen.

313
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:23,420
And so this was my first time seeing the actual Toothsums in person, even though I had pitched putting it in the game.

314
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:29,560
And so it was important for me to see how did the real thing in the game, how did those live up to each other?

315
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:29,900
Yeah.

316
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:34,500
So I was getting some work done, even though I was there.

317
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:42,680
And I went to the Universal Store at CityWalk that sells the like 90s merch.

318
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,760
Oh, yes, the Legacy Store.

319
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:45,980
We covered that a little bit.

320
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,860
And yeah, here I am at the Legacy Store.

321
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:48,900
I bought a hat.

322
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,740
I'll send you guys these pictures.

323
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:52,060
Like old logo hat.

324
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:56,020
On the old logo hat I bought one last time I was there when I was like 12.

325
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:56,700
Wow.

326
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:57,720
So I bought the same hat.

327
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,500
Oh, that's cool.

328
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:04,280
And then I was getting hungry and I said, hey, Scott, I texted you.

329
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:06,300
I might eat at the Bob Marley restaurant.

330
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,740
Has anyone covered that yet?

331
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,160
Nope.

332
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,240
And you were the first.

333
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,360
You called it.

334
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:18,260
Got to it even before before Griffin Newman, who I feel like was fishing for it maybe a little a little bit.

335
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,440
So you grabbed it.

336
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:24,380
And now I now I don't know if Griffin is going to end up being part of the series because he wasn't as on the ball.

337
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:24,780
I know.

338
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:25,220
Yeah, yeah.

339
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:25,740
I might not.

340
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:26,280
Sorry.

341
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:27,400
You have to set this one out, Griffin.

342
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,400
And yeah, I've got it all up right here.

343
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:35,220
Unfortunately, I can't see Jason anymore because all of my pictures are in front of him.

344
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:40,640
I've got actually look Bob Marley from the menu is right where he would be.

345
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:41,680
OK.

346
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:42,300
Wow.

347
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:43,300
I don't want to.

348
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:44,480
This is terrible to say.

349
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,600
I don't want to say that's an upgrade from Jason.

350
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,100
But of course, Bob Marley.

351
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:56,660
Well, the main character Bob Marley won love the hit movie, the worldwide hit in theaters as we speak.

352
00:18:56,900 --> 00:19:05,200
Indeed, which maybe I don't.

353
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:09,280
Well, I didn't go see the movie last night.

354
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:09,740
Oh, right.

355
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:12,200
Planning to and telling Scott I was going to.

356
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,220
So that's the real reveal.

357
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:19,480
We even delayed the record a little bit so that it was possible maybe for us both to go.

358
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:19,840
Yes.

359
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:26,300
And then you threw it out there with with the and I was like, I'm sorry, these are theaters that are more than a mile from my house.

360
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:29,800
There's no way that's going to work for me to see Bob Marley won love.

361
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:39,140
But, you know, I did get to watch the very enthusiastic band play for a completely empty room at Bob Marley's Tribute to Freedom.

362
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,120
And, you know, I feel like that's basically the same experience.

363
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:44,600
Can you guys hear this?

364
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,280
Let me play this.

365
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:47,720
I don't know how loud this is to everyone else.

366
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:51,120
I think I can turn the volume up to be if it's loud drums.

367
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:52,360
Then it hasn't played yet.

368
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,600
So don't you wouldn't have heard it.

369
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,500
OK, here we go.

370
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,440
I hear a little I hear.

371
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:05,440
Whoa, I do hear you hear that reggae coming from from some goggles.

372
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:11,940
Well, I wish I could put you guys in here and give you the experience of the Bob Marley.

373
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:12,460
Yeah.

374
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:18,900
You know, if only the technology had been there, I would have captured the the the room itself in the immersive video.

375
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:26,280
Does it do three six to how many degrees around or do you just have to look your head around to get this itself?

376
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,880
It actually doesn't record full.

377
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:32,360
So 180 is the kind of like standard for immersive video.

378
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:38,340
What this records like when I was recording you guys, I think is a is more of like a hundred degree kind of a box.

379
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:39,220
OK, got it.

380
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,060
A situation.

381
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:45,400
OK, so know that if you're if you're watching the immersive video, you're not getting the full periphery.

382
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:50,220
You'll get I have other equipment if that was what we'd needed that I could have brought to capture.

383
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:51,260
Yeah, but we're improvising.

384
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:51,920
We didn't know.

385
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:52,260
Yeah.

386
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:53,880
So you could bring the full camera truck.

387
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:54,380
Yes.

388
00:20:54,380 --> 00:21:07,820
Not to just not to jump around because I want to focus on your experience here, but I do just want to say just to meditate on the phrase Bob Marley, a tribute to freedom is the name of this establishment.

389
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:16,140
Yeah, I that phrase to me is like was one of the main things pulling me along to want to do this series.

390
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:23,680
I've seen this phrase in brochures and just like and passing by and signs and never never gone in.

391
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:27,860
I just and it's been this is this was an opening day thing for city walks.

392
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,700
This has been here since ninety nine.

393
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:51,580
It's millions of people have passed by the words Bob Marley, a tribute to freedom and and maybe not meditated on it like we get to do now, maybe not really reflected on the fact that it is you can't you hear just the phrase and you're like, wow, so it must be like a museum, like a tribute to his life and kind of an exploration of.

394
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,760
No, no, no, it's a restaurant.

395
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:07,720
It's a restaurant where you, you know, you get like what's there, but you know, my ties and rum punch and jerk chicken salad.

396
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:12,620
So the situation there, and I don't know if you guys have looked into this and done your research.

397
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:25,640
A lot of the Bob Marley IP is held by the Bob Marley Foundation, of which his wife and children were and are executives.

398
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:50,780
OK, and so they try, I'm sure out of the goodness of their hearts, but also to maintain their five oh one three C charitable organization status and sure to always be trying to help to spread the important legacy of Bob Marley and his message through all of their many licensing endeavors.

399
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:51,660
I see.

400
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:57,460
And so more than licensing endeavors because they're about these ideas, these ideas that change the world.

401
00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:02,020
And so I've pulled up the menu here on the screen and I can read to you guys.

402
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:05,720
There's a little some writing about Bob Marley.

403
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:06,420
Oh, please.

404
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,780
Yeah, very helpful.

405
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:10,260
Yeah, this is on the back of all the menus.

406
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:12,200
It says beyond the legend.

407
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,160
Hmm.

408
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:25,160
Bob Marley was born Robert Nesta Marley on February 6th, 1945 in the slums of Jamaica, yet he had the talent, vision and courage to become the foremost superstar of reggae music.

409
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:35,660
Always mindful of the poverty and hard times of his youth, his songs of faith, hope, rebellion and determination have brought inspiration and joy to audiences everywhere.

410
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:43,920
He made his first recording at the age of 17 and at 19 singing with the whalers originally called the Wailing Rude Boys.

411
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:53,280
Bob's astounding international acclaim as a prolific songwriter and musician earned him a place in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

412
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:53,960
Wow.

413
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:59,720
These successes pale only in comparison to his achievements as a peacemaker and humanitarian.

414
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:09,320
He was awarded the Order of Merit by the Jamaican government for his contribution to Jamaican culture and the Medal of Peace for the Third World by the United Nations.

415
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:15,180
The man who brought reggae to the world died tragically of brain cancer on May 11th, 1981.

416
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:21,440
Three decades after his death, his spirit rages on in his music and his message.

417
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:30,360
Bob Marley, a tribute to freedom, is proud to showcase his legend and his life filled with such talent and integrity.

418
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:39,640
We've worked very closely with Rita Marley and the Bob Marley Foundation in order to replicate Bob's home on 56 Hope Road, Jamaica.

419
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:45,020
We hope you enjoy your stay with us today and we look forward to your return.

420
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:55,180
Please take a moment to reflect on the artistry and words of this uncompromising artist and browse our collection of memorabilia.

421
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:56,980
Wow.

422
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:59,560
That's like the heaviest thing.

423
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:01,620
But then that's in a menu?

424
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,380
Yes, but it also ends with a quote,

425
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:09,840
Don't gain the world and lose your soul because wisdom is better than silver and gold, Bob Marley.

426
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:13,460
But then like in the middle, is there like…

427
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:15,460
Awesome.

428
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,680
Buffalo Soul Jerk Jerk Wings.

429
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:18,820
Taste of Jamaica.

430
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:23,860
A tour of island flavors featuring our veggie and beef patties, jerk wings and yuca fries.

431
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:24,840
Is there a kids menu?

432
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:26,960
Get up, stand up, mango wings.

433
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:30,380
Crispy, fried, tossed in our own mango sauce.

434
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:32,680
Is there a kids menu?

435
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:34,240
There is.

436
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:34,940
I know what it is.

437
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,160
I want to see if Van can find it.

438
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:36,520
Let's see.

439
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:36,920
Do I have the…

440
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:39,820
I have got the Rastafarian Tings drink menu.

441
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,700
I mean, it's great.

442
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,480
It's exciting that something can be both.

443
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:52,120
That it can be both a restaurant and a tribute to freedom.

444
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:55,520
I do not seem to have the kids menu, unfortunately.

445
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,200
The kids menu is called the Lil Legends menu.

446
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:02,820
And one of the items on it is Jamaican Roni and Cheese.

447
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:07,740
We should honestly have awards at the end of this for best…

448
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:09,120
Because we've encountered a lot of good…

449
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,600
with Fallen Brothers and the currently existing ones,

450
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:13,900
a lot of good themed item names.

451
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:16,880
Is Jamaican Roni and Cheese perhaps the best one we've found?

452
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:17,760
It's up there, yeah.

453
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:18,700
Maybe it's the best.

454
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,020
I'll declare it the best.

455
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:23,980
I also really like No Woman, No Cry Jerk Chicken Salad.

456
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:32,420
As someone who's gone through the process of theming a menu and naming themed menu items,

457
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:37,460
I have to say it's harder than you might think to do it.

458
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:44,860
I'm going to give them an A- on the naming of these items.

459
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:45,660
Yeah.

460
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:49,040
I got takeout from this restaurant.

461
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:54,860
And I ordered these Natty Dredd vegetable patties.

462
00:26:56,340 --> 00:27:03,280
This is two house-made patties filled with sweet potatoes, red beans, spinach, carrots, onions, coconut milk,

463
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:06,520
cocoa bread, yucca fries, and smoky ketchup.

464
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:13,800
And you can here see all the different shades of brown and yellow and tan at my takeout.

465
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,140
Oh, wow.

466
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,480
All the colors.

467
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:16,980
The red of the ketchup.

468
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,020
You're getting every color you need.

469
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,380
Sorry, you were being blocked by the menu.

470
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:22,080
Could I see that?

471
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:22,960
Oh, sure.

472
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:23,740
Yeah.

473
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:27,280
What you described seemed like a much more sophisticated dish,

474
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:29,660
and then you showed it to me and it looks like you can just get it.

475
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:34,900
I will say, this is not the best restaurant, I think, for takeout.

476
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:40,140
What with the centerpiece being a recreation of his home in Jamaica.

477
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:41,400
Of a music legend's real home.

478
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:45,040
A musical component, memorabilia on the walls.

479
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:45,920
It's definitely a funny…

480
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,380
I don't know that it's a food forward.

481
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:48,380
That was the first night was to do.

482
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:50,380
But Jason is covering…

483
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:52,920
This is part of the experience.

484
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:55,020
There's a lot more takeout and bar situations.

485
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,400
Mike got to do takeout, the glorious takeout of Toothsam.

486
00:27:58,540 --> 00:27:58,800
Of course.

487
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,820
And Jason got to do Bob Marley, a takeout to freedom.

488
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:03,920
A takeout to freedom.

489
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:04,520
I like that.

490
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:06,520
Look, the patties were delicious.

491
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,860
Really good, really fresh.

492
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:13,680
The bread was stale and the fries and ketchup were just kind of nothing.

493
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,000
The yucca fries weren't really anything.

494
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,180
The patties represent Bob's spirit.

495
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:24,040
And the stale bread represents his oppressors and everyone who didn't believe in him.

496
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:27,940
There's something that has to give you some feeling of hardship when you're eating the meal.

497
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,580
To make you appreciate what you have.

498
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:32,240
To tell the full story of Mr.

499
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:33,680
Marley in one meal.

500
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:37,780
I had the sweet plantains and the rice and peas as my sides.

501
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:43,280
And I think that those were perhaps a more Marley-esque side to have.

502
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,240
You felt the one love spirit more in the plantains.

503
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:51,280
Just to give Scott you a note, you guys can pass this around.

504
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:52,960
This is the view I see.

505
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,320
We're AR.

506
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,260
I'm looking at where you're looking.

507
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:58,980
And AR has projected…

508
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:01,400
Here, let's just do lots of layers here.

509
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:03,580
Let me take a picture with my phone.

510
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,260
I'm in it.

511
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:05,740
Great.

512
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:06,440
Okay.

513
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:06,820
And there is…

514
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:07,900
You're really…

515
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:09,940
You are bringing the City Walk saga.

516
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,980
You're bringing sagas into the 22nd century.

517
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:13,360
Yeah.

518
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,800
So I've got the menu, as you can see, right up there.

519
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:20,300
And it's very easy for me to just move it right over here and block Jason.

520
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,580
Just all I have to look at is the menu.

521
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:23,940
And really it's just because he's right in front of me.

522
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,080
Just because it's your center?

523
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:29,720
I can attest to your point of view that that is the natural place.

524
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:32,600
But can't you just slide it between me and Jason?

525
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:38,060
Maybe slide it right over here, but I guess that's fine.

526
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,660
I feel like I'm going to make you.

527
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:39,820
You've got to…

528
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:44,240
I know you've got your fake eyes, but you've got to look my co-host in the eyes.

529
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,620
If you're going to be here, that's part of the rules.

530
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,780
I think that's what Bob Marley would want, too.

531
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,660
I think he knew the eyes were the windows to the soul.

532
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,860
Yeah, go ahead and pass that over.

533
00:29:58,920 --> 00:29:59,420
What did I do?

534
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:02,340
There was a band playing outside while I was there.

535
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:02,340
Oh, wow.

536
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:02,740
You're showing it to me.

537
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,160
You started that on your phone?

538
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:09,240
You've just handed your vision out to the rest of us.

539
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,720
You're taking parts of yourself.

540
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,520
So you can see my food there.

541
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:14,460
That's the Jamaican…

542
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:16,300
That doesn't look bad.

543
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:17,640
Let me get the name right.

544
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:22,360
That is the Reggae Jamaican Jerk Chicken.

545
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:27,260
Half chicken marinated in Jamaican spices and scotch bonnet peppers,

546
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:30,560
char-grilled, chopped rice and peas, sweet plantains.

547
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:33,000
I got to say, it was pretty good.

548
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:34,800
Wow.

549
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:37,760
I wondered about the quality of this as a restaurant.

550
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,920
I didn't have great feelings about it from what Jason had conveyed.

551
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,280
But you think if you do the sit-down…

552
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:46,180
I sat down and had what was essentially a piece of rotisserie chicken

553
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:47,720
with some jerk sauce on it.

554
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,820
It's a pretty easy dish.

555
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:52,240
Sure, but again, you have no idea.

556
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:54,440
We've encountered such horrors in this series.

557
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:57,780
Something made competently is exactly what we're looking for.

558
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:58,760
He saw it.

559
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:02,480
And if you give me the Wi-Fi, I can force my view onto his iPad, actually.

560
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:03,640
Oh, wow.

561
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:04,240
Actually, we should.

562
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:04,960
That sounds good.

563
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:06,760
Do you want to be commandeered, Jason?

564
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,520
Do you want to be hacked?

565
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:11,680
Jason should be hacked.

566
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:15,320
Can you put your vision into Jason's regular glasses?

567
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:18,200
They're not hooked up to any sort of cloud or Wi-Fi,

568
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:19,500
but I don't know what this thing can do.

569
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:22,220
That might be difficult, but I can always try.

570
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:23,460
Just asking questions.

571
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:25,040
Isn't it…

572
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:26,720
The fact that it's not called…

573
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:27,960
Because there's other things.

574
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:32,560
Right down mere feet away is Jimmy Buffett's Margaritaville.

575
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:34,360
Is it a tribute to the man and his spirit?

576
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:37,200
Yes, but ultimately it's called Jimmy Buffett's Margaritaville.

577
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:40,960
It's not a tribute to any greater, deeper concept.

578
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:41,680
The fact that this isn't…

579
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:44,800
It's not Bob Marley's reggae roasters.

580
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,960
It's Bob Marley, a tribute to freedom.

581
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:54,260
It just sets the bar so high for what this experience is going to be.

582
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:55,580
Until you read that menu…

583
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:58,480
I just popped in for a drink.

584
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:02,400
The menu is clearly the primary piece.

585
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:03,740
They probably need to force people…

586
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:07,040
There should be a pre-show room where they make you read that

587
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:09,980
as if it was scripture so that the rest really lands.

588
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:12,080
As it did for me, I just went in.

589
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:16,100
I didn't even get a mojito or anything island-ish.

590
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:17,460
I just got a glass of wine.

591
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:19,120
Not a cool you down?

592
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,720
Not a mighty good drink?

593
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,400
Not a freedom freeze?

594
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,480
Is there a freedom freeze?

595
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,160
Of course there's a freedom freeze.

596
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:28,660
What better way to show you freedom?

597
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:30,220
Not Uncle Ray's rum punch?

598
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:31,240
I didn't.

599
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:32,540
No, I didn't do anything fun.

600
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:33,760
Banana jamming?

601
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:34,560
No.

602
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,100
I know it was an end of the night situation,

603
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:38,480
so I just needed to coast down.

604
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:41,640
I don't think I needed a new type of cocktail in me,

605
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,240
but I'm regretting it now.

606
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:44,740
I feel like I let Bob down.

607
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:47,260
Let me see if this is an unpopular opinion.

608
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,080
I like that they're going for something ambitious.

609
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:53,780
I like that it's where he grew up when he was little.

610
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:53,960
Yeah.

611
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:57,880
But I feel like the fun names here,

612
00:32:57,900 --> 00:33:00,520
which I'm always calling for more fun names on menus,

613
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:02,120
here it doesn't work.

614
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:05,540
I think you should have very boring-sounding names

615
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:07,880
and maybe less ambitious food.

616
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:09,600
Interesting.

617
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:11,120
I think you're really trying to give the feeling.

618
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,660
I think that if you gave boring names,

619
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:19,020
then you failed at, how should I put it,

620
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,240
the, where is it?

621
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:23,700
I'm looking at the notes.

622
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:24,200
Thesaurus.

623
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:24,700
com.

624
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:30,520
No, no, the artistry and words of this uncompromising artist.

625
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:33,020
I think if you go for boring names,

626
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:34,280
you failed to capture that.

627
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:35,520
I mean, one love, okay.

628
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,560
Yeah, you've got to put some stuff like that.

629
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,200
So you're okay with jam and drinks.

630
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,480
Are you trying to make a more successful restaurant?

631
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:41,960
No, I'm not.

632
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:44,300
I am not trying to make this more successful.

633
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:46,240
Don't gain the world and lose your soul,

634
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,540
because wisdom is better than silver and gold.

635
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,840
I understand that, and I believe that,

636
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:52,300
but I'm saying that if you're really,

637
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:54,220
if the whole place is of a piece,

638
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:56,300
I feel like the menu is in contention

639
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:58,580
with the aesthetic of the rest of the place.

640
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:00,160
That's what I'm saying.

641
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:02,380
It's too silly?

642
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,220
But his music is fun.

643
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,380
That's true, it is.

644
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,140
And reggae music is fun.

645
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:10,520
I feel like probably they're playing the greatest,

646
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:11,920
when I went,

647
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:14,360
and then the next night when I was hearing it

648
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,640
from behind me

649
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:19,100
at the cowfish sushi bar,

650
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:23,020
I definitely heard

651
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:24,720
Pass the Dutchie, both

652
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:26,920
in there and then blasting in

653
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,640
from another restaurant, which made it feel

654
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:30,480
a little less special, honestly, because I was really

655
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,380
actually digging it while they were in print,

656
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:34,740
and then it suddenly felt like, oh, well, so they always

657
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:36,480
play Pass the Dutchie, don't they?

658
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:38,760
Well, there was a private party the one

659
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:40,780
I think had taken over.

660
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:41,880
Was it there?

661
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,320
Take over that space?

662
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:44,900
It was one of those clubs.

663
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,840
There was a minute where we weren't going to get into some of these places

664
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:50,180
because there were

665
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:51,920
barricades up for some private

666
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,300
I forget which of the clubs.

667
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:56,160
We thought that was going to stop us

668
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,000
in our tracks.

669
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,920
But pretty much I feel like we're making it to everything

670
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:00,560
we're supposed to.

671
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,040
Again, we're going to check, by the way,

672
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:04,140
just to announce it, we're going to check in with the

673
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:05,780
center keeper at the very end and just make sure

674
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:07,860
that we've proceeded according to his

675
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:09,760
wishes, and we'll let you go before that, Van.

676
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:12,240
Otherwise, I think we're

677
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,900
penetrating, we're covering everything here.

678
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:15,960
Anyway, Pass the Dutchie's

679
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,640
fun, I know that's not his song,

680
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,960
but you know, so if you have

681
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,720
I guess I don't want to

682
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,580
like, sort of the elephant in the room,

683
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,860
you know, the

684
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:27,940
man practiced a religion, the center

685
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:29,980
piece of which is just getting really, really

686
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:31,160
high on marijuana.

687
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:33,800
I think to criticize the men you

688
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,920
attribute to him as being too

689
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,760
silly is really

690
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,760
kind of runs a foul of

691
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,880
the man's lifestyle

692
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:42,520
and his spirit.

693
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:43,900
I think it's really just a tribute

694
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:44,440
to freedom.

695
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:45,740
You can be silly and serious

696
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:48,020
at the same time is I think one of the messages

697
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:48,860
of Bob Marley.

698
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:49,500
Okay.

699
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:51,920
Well, but maybe it should be a tribute to freedom and

700
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:52,600
being silly.

701
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:53,840
We should say

702
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,800
that, that's maybe the title of the

703
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:56,460
place in my mind.

704
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:57,720
You know, Van could

705
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:59,360
speak to this from a corporate standpoint.

706
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:01,820
That was probably some of the thing with thinking of menu items

707
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:03,660
is like the economy of words.

708
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,720
And that does seem like, I hear what you're saying,

709
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:08,020
Mike, but it does seem like maybe a little too much

710
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:08,980
to get into one title.

711
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:09,620
I just think the title sounds

712
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:10,480
so important.

713
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:11,720
It doesn't, it almost

714
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:13,740
sounds like it's not going to be

715
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:15,900
I feel like we are like, doesn't it sound

716
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:17,900
like the name of a

717
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:19,820
museum that is going to deal with some

718
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:21,720
heavy topics that might

719
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:23,660
deal with just a little with mass killings

720
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:24,560
or stuff like that.

721
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,880
It does not sound

722
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,720
like a place to go and get drunk.

723
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:29,520
Tribute is maybe the word that is

724
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:29,520
perhaps the problem.

725
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,860
Maybe that's really all I'm responding to.

726
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:32,720
It's pretty heady.

727
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:33,220
Yeah.

728
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:34,040
Like, honestly,

729
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,780
if it were celebration,

730
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:37,900
yeah, that's a different

731
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:39,420
story.

732
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,400
Celebration does change it.

733
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:42,160
Is anything called

734
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:42,500
a tribute?

735
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,200
In those early Universal rides,

736
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,920
was anything, was Alfred Hitchcock, I don't remember,

737
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:47,340
I know we've covered a lot of these, but I don't remember.

738
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,160
That was just like magic

739
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:48,640
of the movie.

740
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:49,780
Was anything a tribute?

741
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:50,280
Lucy

742
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:50,280
A tribute?

743
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,100
Lucy A tribute?

744
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,100
And that is a

745
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:52,520
museum.

746
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:53,140
A museum, yes.

747
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:54,060
We liked it.

748
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:55,680
I think we all found memories of that.

749
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,320
I loved it, yes.

750
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,220
It was fun, but it's not as

751
00:36:58,220 --> 00:37:00,280
fun as, you can't go get like

752
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,820
Lucy themed cocktails there.

753
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:02,260
It's not

754
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:02,780
that fun.

755
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:03,720
Would be inappropriate

756
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:05,280
if they did that.

757
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:06,680
It would be.

758
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:07,800
But wasn't she,

759
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,820
she probably was a drinker, right?

760
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,180
Oh, a smoker for sure.

761
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:12,220
Probably a drinker as well.

762
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:12,820
Certainly that.

763
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:14,060
They should at least offer

764
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:14,500
cigarettes.

765
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:14,960
There should be cigarettes.

766
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,100
Yeah, what Desi

767
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:17,600
put her through?

768
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:18,040
She

769
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:19,300
had a lot of drinks, I bet.

770
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:20,240
Lucy A tribute, I believe

771
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,260
last time I was there had the

772
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,760
the Back to the Future car in it.

773
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:25,820
That building.

774
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:26,220
Yes,

775
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:26,920
yeah, yeah, yeah.

776
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:28,260
It became like a

777
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:29,460
general Universal thing.

778
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:29,920
Oh, I see what you're saying.

779
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,580
It definitely loosened up.

780
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:31,920
Yes.

781
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,540
Not Lucy A tribute to freedom.

782
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:35,960
That was not Lucy's primary.

783
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,220
That's an exhibit about her divorce

784
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:38,900
from Desi.

785
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:40,220
Yeah.

786
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:42,260
There's the tribute

787
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,020
stores.

788
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,920
They do a lot of big

789
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,220
themed stores.

790
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:47,700
Sure.

791
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:48,940
That kind of roti.

792
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:49,640
Okay, yeah.

793
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:51,340
It doesn't feel as ponderate.

794
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,860
A tribute to freedom makes you feel like

795
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:56,040
you have to go reflect on what it would be like

796
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,200
to not be free.

797
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:58,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

798
00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:00,520
It makes me think it's going to be like a dark

799
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,260
side, a grim side to it, whereas

800
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:04,320
I think you can attest to this, Van, I think you

801
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,300
go and you have a lot of fun at this place.

802
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:05,980
It's a good time.

803
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:06,260
I was

804
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:08,300
there alone, sat

805
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:10,120
at the bar, it was a little rainy,

806
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,240
and I still had a nice time.

807
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:14,280
You know, I

808
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:16,260
went to Toothsims after and got a

809
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:18,220
big giant piece of fudge with peanut

810
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:18,920
butter on top.

811
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:20,060
Was that more fun?

812
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,120
We don't need to say that.

813
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,360
That's for a different episode.

814
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:23,340
Different sector, yeah, yeah.

815
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:24,200
But

816
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:26,640
I had a generally positive experience.

817
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,860
I will say, like, yeah,

818
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:30,900
there was rain, but it does

819
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:33,140
seem to be the most sparsely attended

820
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:34,680
of the

821
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:36,240
CityWalk restaurants.

822
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:37,340
Yeah, yeah.

823
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:38,740
Well, we were there on

824
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:41,000
I went on a Tuesday

825
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,220
night, and I think the

826
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:44,760
Tuesday night of it definitely

827
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:45,740
reduced crowds.

828
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:46,840
I imagine it's

829
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,480
a little more pumping on the weekend,

830
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:50,580
but the sparse crowds

831
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:52,620
factor into some of the

832
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:53,840
things in this sector being fun.

833
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:54,780
We'll get to the

834
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:55,460
other place.

835
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,160
But what it did allow

836
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,920
for me is that I was able

837
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:01,180
to get a front row seat

838
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:02,620
at what I think is a

839
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:04,640
first class concert venue.

840
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,500
I'm looking at this in like how many,

841
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:08,900
because just the way it's a rent where it's this big, like, you know,

842
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,900
there's like, you know, the whole

843
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:12,820
upstairs component, like all

844
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:14,520
these porches, there's so many little spots

845
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:15,580
to watch something.

846
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:16,780
And you know, concert venues,

847
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:18,760
there's a lot of great concert venues out there,

848
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,800
but not a lot that have little,

849
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,940
like, nooks and overhangs,

850
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:25,020
which I feel like is what, you know, probably

851
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:26,960
what they used to be more like in the 40s and

852
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,160
50s, you know, when concerts were being held

853
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:30,760
and kind of like we're, you know,

854
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:33,060
we're turning this old church or this old movie theater

855
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:33,880
into this and that.

856
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:35,000
I was just there

857
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,780
like, boy, I'd be lucky to see any,

858
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,980
if a band I loved was playing at

859
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:40,760
Bob Marley, a tribute to freedom,

860
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:42,100
be fucking awesome.

861
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,160
Be a great

862
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:43,620
venue.

863
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:45,040
And then also that I

864
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,120
have a front row seat for whatever

865
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:47,660
it is.

866
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:48,880
It's just going to be like,

867
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:51,000
alright, it is a reggae band and they're going to play

868
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:51,820
some reggae covers.

869
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,320
It's not the greatest thing in the world.

870
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:54,300
The one band.

871
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:56,620
I think it does seem, we probably watched,

872
00:39:56,740 --> 00:39:58,220
did you also get past the Dutchie?

873
00:39:58,840 --> 00:39:59,520
Yes, yes.

874
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:01,180
They seem to have about a half

875
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:02,180
a dozen songs.

876
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,940
Yeah, yes, yeah, we got this.

877
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:06,860
It's a surprisingly showbiz

878
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:08,960
pizza-esque performance

879
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,140
despite being human beings.

880
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:12,980
Well, with a lot of repeated, I feel like

881
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:14,820
the singer was just like, was he just like

882
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:15,860
slow motion marching?

883
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:16,540
Yeah.

884
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:17,620
Like a robot.

885
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:18,880
He's got his like, his couple

886
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:19,320
moves.

887
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:20,840
And you know, it does have the thing

888
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:22,480
that happens which, look,

889
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:25,040
God bless the performers.

890
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:27,070
They added to the

891
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:28,060
experience.

892
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:28,680
But

893
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:31,040
when I arrived, there was no one

894
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,920
out there on the patio.

895
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:33,820
And they were performing.

896
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:34,400
No spectators.

897
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:35,340
No spectators.

898
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:37,020
And they just, you know, in order

899
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:39,320
to entice me to join in,

900
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:40,860
they are ready

901
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:42,920
and going and that show goes on

902
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:44,400
whether there's an audience or not.

903
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:44,880
Wow.

904
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,000
That's cool.

905
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
You know, I have to

906
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,460
I have to applaud

907
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:50,820
that.

908
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,160
It reminds me

909
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:54,100
of a good friend of mine, Mr.

910
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,400
Bugman who had a similar experience

911
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,580
at Los Angeles Comic Con.

912
00:40:58,580 --> 00:40:59,700
Oh, yeah, yeah.

913
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:00,080
Performing for

914
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:02,300
about a half a dozen people in a 500

915
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:03,960
person auditorium.

916
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:06,160
Entirely empty chairs and yet he gave

917
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:06,500
it his all.

918
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:07,920
He performed as if there were 500 people.

919
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:10,300
What we found out after is that

920
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:12,320
a board member of Los Angeles Comic

921
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:14,100
Con was one of the five people in attendance

922
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:15,260
and said it was his favorite thing.

923
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:16,340
He saw the convention

924
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:17,480
and hoped we came back.

925
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:18,080
So

926
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:19,920
you never know.

927
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:20,260
Right.

928
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:22,520
If you come to LA Comic Con, fingers crossed

929
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:23,960
after that hustle Bug put in.

930
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:25,940
Who's going to be there in that small crowd.

931
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:27,660
That's why you always give it your all.

932
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:30,040
Well, that's, you know, yeah, the

933
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:32,060
lesson that a such

934
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:34,040
an impassioned artist says Bob Marley or

935
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:36,080
Bugmane can teach us.

936
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:38,100
Bugmane a tribute to

937
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:40,120
Pudding Sauce.

938
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:42,860
So

939
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:45,200
so I end up at like

940
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,540
pretty psyched to sit down and realize

941
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:48,440
wow, whenever this band goes on we're getting a front

942
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:50,300
row seat and it was me and the level

943
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:50,660
keeper.

944
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,520
I get to have a little one

945
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:53,960
on one time with the level keeper.

946
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:56,200
And we did, it was a funny

947
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,500
just back and forth, talk about the duality

948
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:01,340
that this whole experience has where

949
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:02,660
it was

950
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:03,780
just, it was a particular moment.

951
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:06,420
We just ended up in a conversation that was kind of

952
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:08,540
about like parents health

953
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:10,940
struggles and

954
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:12,740
and mortality and kind of aging

955
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:14,520
and kind of we're talking about, you know,

956
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:16,740
as happens you're on a trip

957
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:18,180
with somebody you get into some

958
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:20,400
headier topics and we're like yeah, well you know

959
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:23,000
parents get older and it doesn't

960
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,620
you know these things don't last forever and you

961
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:25,480
just got to remember that

962
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:28,840
and then suddenly

963
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:30,520
hard wall of reggae

964
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:32,820
comes down, interrupts

965
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:33,820
the serious conversation.

966
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:36,320
And isn't that what you need in a serious conversation?

967
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,620
Just to shake you out.

968
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:38,700
Yeah, you know

969
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:40,500
I think it couldn't have gone better if you

970
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:41,100
ask me.

971
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:41,860
Yeah, yeah.

972
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:42,520
It was my

973
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:44,060
favorite, it is a tie

974
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:46,800
in terms of serious subject matter

975
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,020
mixed with environment.

976
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:50,600
It is maybe a runner up only to this other

977
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:52,480
thing and I'm gonna go back to something, I'm gonna go

978
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,320
way back a bunch of sectors

979
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:56,500
and talk about a moment, I can't let this series

980
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:57,920
pass without talking about it.

981
00:42:58,280 --> 00:42:58,280
Please.

982
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:00,280
When we

983
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:01,960
were all at the food court

984
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:04,640
we're up at the food court and we have our little potluck

985
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:05,920
of all the various things

986
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:08,640
we could sample from the food court.

987
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:10,780
And Jason, you got

988
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:12,780
into a story and the details

989
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:14,860
of the story don't matter but it was kind of a

990
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:16,720
grim story, do you know what I'm talking about?

991
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:17,420
I remember.

992
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:18,140
Yeah, kind of.

993
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:18,920
You told a

994
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:21,080
story that without getting into details

995
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:22,880
it was the stories

996
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:24,540
of a very tragic death

997
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:26,920
that had happened to somebody peripheral to you

998
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:28,960
and a neighbor with kind of

999
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:30,720
awful details and you didn't tell this story

1000
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:32,680
as this was not like a fun thing, it was not something you were

1001
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:33,640
taking lightly, the opposite.

1002
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:34,860
No, no, it was startling.

1003
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:36,860
Yes, yeah, yeah, and we all

1004
00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:38,920
kind of, you told the story and we all kind of like

1005
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:40,680
oh god, jeez, well that's

1006
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:42,720
oh that's terrible and we're all reeling

1007
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:45,040
from it and then I realized

1008
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:46,840
that as you're telling the story

1009
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:48,880
and we're all processing it, we are all

1010
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:50,680
wearing the little Burger King crowns

1011
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:54,740
and no one acknowledged it until

1012
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:55,440
now.

1013
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:56,800
Was it at least someone's birthday?

1014
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,840
No, we were

1015
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:00,800
just like, well we're at the BK Whopper bar

1016
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,080
and we have to get the crowns.

1017
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:03,380
The back of them when you walked in

1018
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:04,460
like a whole line of them.

1019
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:06,740
We're all in little crowns like, Jesus

1020
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:08,620
well that's, you know, oh you hate to hear about that.

1021
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:10,800
Well nobody took their crown off and put it over their heart

1022
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,880
or anything so at least it wasn't like

1023
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:13,460
that bad.

1024
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:14,720
It was still funny.

1025
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,320
It was more insulting or less.

1026
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:18,860
Maybe that would have addressed the

1027
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:19,140
gravity.

1028
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:20,820
Yeah.

1029
00:44:20,860 --> 00:44:22,120
Yeah, I do remember that now.

1030
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:24,520
Oh boy, that's the

1031
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:26,860
culture clash, what environments

1032
00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:28,160
can bring you at this place.

1033
00:44:28,180 --> 00:44:28,460
Yes, yes.

1034
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,340
I also got the fun of

1035
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:32,680
that I was getting a lot of texts

1036
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:34,560
suddenly about an upcoming pitch that I'm doing

1037
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:36,660
with people and I wanted to field the

1038
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:38,360
text and take them seriously but I instead

1039
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:40,520
I sent a video and said, yeah listen

1040
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:42,360
I'm gonna deal with this as soon as the reggae

1041
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:44,820
concert's over and then spun around

1042
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:46,940
to the very close reggae performer

1043
00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:48,120
in front of me.

1044
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:50,680
That was the most satisfying way to push

1045
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:51,640
notes I've ever.

1046
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:52,560
So anyway

1047
00:44:53,980 --> 00:44:54,760
let me

1048
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:56,780
before we move on to the next thing, let me just say

1049
00:44:56,780 --> 00:44:59,040
if we're gonna meditate on the title

1050
00:44:59,040 --> 00:44:59,980
of this

1051
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:02,400
the definition of freedom

1052
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:05,080
is the power or right to act

1053
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:07,120
speak or think as one wants

1054
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:08,940
without hindrance or restraint.

1055
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:11,020
Do we feel like

1056
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:13,120
do you feel like in your

1057
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:14,940
visit there, do any of us feel like in our

1058
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:16,940
visits here that we

1059
00:45:16,940 --> 00:45:18,980
did the definition, participated

1060
00:45:18,980 --> 00:45:20,760
in the dictionary definition of freedom?

1061
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:23,000
Yes because while

1062
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,680
I didn't get any substitutions

1063
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:26,680
on my sides, they do allow substitutions

1064
00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:28,840
which is not always

1065
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:30,680
the case and to me that is

1066
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:31,980
true freedom.

1067
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:33,580
Freedom to substitute.

1068
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:33,960
Beautiful.

1069
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:36,780
If they didn't have that, then you

1070
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:38,840
could scarcely put Bob Marley's name on this

1071
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:39,060
place.

1072
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:39,860
Oh wow yeah.

1073
00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:40,320
Damn.

1074
00:45:40,460 --> 00:45:40,840
Very good point.

1075
00:45:41,620 --> 00:45:42,680
Well let's talk about the other

1076
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:44,700
you went and did this and then you

1077
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:46,680
happened into another one of these places

1078
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:48,800
as part of your sector assignment

1079
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:50,220
but it worked out pretty nicely

1080
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:52,300
which is Pat O'Brien's.

1081
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:52,760
Yes it's

1082
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:54,900
right next door I believe or right nearby.

1083
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:56,200
Yeah I think they're in a store.

1084
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:56,640
Yeah.

1085
00:45:56,780 --> 00:45:59,260
Which is a New Orleans institution

1086
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:01,060
recreated in city walking.

1087
00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:03,120
Yes and I'll be honest they could have very well

1088
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:05,120
named it Pat O'Brien's

1089
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:07,120
attribute to Pat O'Brien's

1090
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:09,100
because it does

1091
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:10,960
realistically recreate

1092
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:12,980
the Pat O'Brien's courtyard

1093
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:14,940
and piano bar

1094
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:17,080
room of the Pat O'Brien's

1095
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:17,740
in New Orleans.

1096
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:19,040
It is accurate

1097
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:19,600
you feel.

1098
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:20,980
It is actually quite accurate.

1099
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:21,900
Okay.

1100
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,020
They have that fountain.

1101
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:24,800
Yes.

1102
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:27,140
It's a champagne glass that's on

1103
00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:27,720
fire.

1104
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:29,040
The flaming

1105
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:31,260
fountain in the courtyard which is a very

1106
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:32,960
nice little, they carve

1107
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:35,360
let me just say everybody who did like the production

1108
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:36,840
design of Bob Marley

1109
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:38,300
recreating Bob Marley's house.

1110
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:38,820
It looks cool.

1111
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,100
Everybody worked on City Walk the bones

1112
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:42,360
of it back in 99.

1113
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:43,360
Spectacular.

1114
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:44,440
Great job everybody.

1115
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:44,860
Yeah.

1116
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:47,020
I mean look are either of them

1117
00:46:47,020 --> 00:46:49,180
NBC Sports Grill and Brew?

1118
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:51,680
I don't see a lot of

1119
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:53,520
logos in years.

1120
00:46:54,620 --> 00:46:55,380
Not as fun.

1121
00:46:56,220 --> 00:46:57,460
But you know

1122
00:46:57,460 --> 00:46:59,320
the Pat O'Brien's I thought was a good

1123
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:01,330
recreation and that's a place that

1124
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:03,740
you know I went to

1125
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:04,220
a lot.

1126
00:47:07,060 --> 00:47:08,060
It's a

1127
00:47:08,060 --> 00:47:09,600
a lot of bars that are very

1128
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:11,300
touristy in New Orleans which

1129
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:12,560
that is a touristy place.

1130
00:47:12,820 --> 00:47:13,500
They are also

1131
00:47:14,180 --> 00:47:15,660
they can be kind of very

1132
00:47:15,660 --> 00:47:17,000
local too but

1133
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,500
for people who are in high school.

1134
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:21,300
Uh huh.

1135
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:27,100
only have to be 18 to be in a bar even though you

1136
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:28,500
have to be 21 to drink.

1137
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:31,340
And so

1138
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:33,360
it causes a sort of

1139
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:35,080
ripple effect of people who are like

1140
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:37,100
14 and 15 having a fake ID that

1141
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:38,980
says they're 18 which is more

1142
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:40,960
believable than one that said they were 21.

1143
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:43,200
So it just ages all the

1144
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:44,100
generations down.

1145
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:44,940
It just ages down

1146
00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:47,320
who's in a bar that shouldn't be

1147
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:48,100
tremendously.

1148
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:49,160
Two tears of it.

1149
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:51,280
You know not this bar but there's

1150
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:53,100
a there's another bar

1151
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:55,220
called The Boot that is a near

1152
00:47:55,220 --> 00:47:57,220
a college campus but I remember when I was actually

1153
00:47:57,220 --> 00:47:59,120
in college being like I can't go

1154
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:00,400
there everybody there's in high school.

1155
00:48:00,860 --> 00:48:03,000
Because literally only high school aged

1156
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,120
people went to this bar for the most part.

1157
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:05,820
That's weird.

1158
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:07,160
And so it's

1159
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:08,080
a strange city.

1160
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:11,080
But the drinking

1161
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:13,140
age was 18 there until the 90s when the

1162
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:15,220
federal government cut off the highway funds and forced

1163
00:48:15,220 --> 00:48:17,300
them to raise it to 21 in return

1164
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:18,280
for having highways.

1165
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,160
The same bucket

1166
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:21,540
of money.

1167
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:23,380
So I spent a lot of time at Pat O'Brien's

1168
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:25,260
in my youth

1169
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:27,140
and you know

1170
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:30,080
I

1171
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:31,060
I didn't

1172
00:48:31,060 --> 00:48:33,540
have any any drinks at the Pat O'Brien's

1173
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:34,680
in Orlando

1174
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:37,320
but I imagine they're pretty

1175
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:39,460
accurate to the

1176
00:48:39,460 --> 00:48:40,260
hurricanes.

1177
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:42,560
I hope I have to admit I don't think

1178
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:44,160
we again this was the end of night.

1179
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:47,100
You didn't get a hurricane at Pat O'Brien's

1180
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:48,180
but drink their famous.

1181
00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:50,460
I know but at the end of the night our last the

1182
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:52,560
last drink I need to coast out with a beer

1183
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:52,900
wine.

1184
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:54,580
I can't be adding a new

1185
00:48:54,580 --> 00:48:56,520
type of liquor as with both of these.

1186
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:58,460
I guess I failed the audience by

1187
00:48:58,460 --> 00:49:00,440
not getting signature drinks at

1188
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:01,300
either of these places.

1189
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:02,360
But I had a fun time

1190
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:02,660
Adam.

1191
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:04,380
I didn't even I'll be honest

1192
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:06,300
I didn't even think about getting a hurricane and

1193
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:07,640
I'm embarrassed that I didn't.

1194
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:08,540
You know what I think I

1195
00:49:08,540 --> 00:49:08,820
got.

1196
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:10,720
What's that Pennsylvania beer Jason

1197
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:12,620
that you bring up and I never know what you're talking

1198
00:49:12,620 --> 00:49:12,800
about.

1199
00:49:12,940 --> 00:49:13,260
Ying Ling.

1200
00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:16,360
I had a guy Jonah

1201
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:18,400
Sobel guy in my freshman floor

1202
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:20,300
obsessed with Ying Ling in college.

1203
00:49:20,740 --> 00:49:21,980
All he would talk about.

1204
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:24,540
Jonah if you're a listener we got a

1205
00:49:24,540 --> 00:49:25,660
Ying Ling fan here.

1206
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:26,500
Oh yeah.

1207
00:49:26,860 --> 00:49:28,340
That luring into the podcast.

1208
00:49:28,540 --> 00:49:29,260
Well he's listening already.

1209
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:31,200
I like the beer.

1210
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:32,760
I never had it.

1211
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:33,140
It's good.

1212
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:34,480
I didn't

1213
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:36,800
it used to be like it everywhere

1214
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:39,480
at Universal and CityWalk.

1215
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:39,780
Yeah.

1216
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:40,100
Ying Ling.

1217
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:43,220
And I didn't see a lot of places.

1218
00:49:43,620 --> 00:49:43,900
It was there.

1219
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:45,160
Deep in the

1220
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:47,480
piano room they had it.

1221
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:52,980
I didn't go there's one half of it I didn't

1222
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:53,460
go into.

1223
00:49:53,580 --> 00:49:54,840
I went into the courtyard I saw that fountain

1224
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:55,540
that's recreation.

1225
00:49:56,020 --> 00:49:56,900
The piano

1226
00:49:56,900 --> 00:49:59,000
room because this is this ends up function it's a tribute

1227
00:49:59,000 --> 00:49:59,920
to the whole establishment.

1228
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:00,820
But it's also

1229
00:50:02,140 --> 00:50:03,080
it is their

1230
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:04,260
dueling piano bars.

1231
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:04,860
Which

1232
00:50:04,860 --> 00:50:06,200
is the case in New Orleans.

1233
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:07,220
There is also a dueling

1234
00:50:07,220 --> 00:50:07,900
piano bar.

1235
00:50:08,140 --> 00:50:08,160
Correct.

1236
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:09,140
And this room

1237
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:10,620
seems like a really there's like a lot of

1238
00:50:10,620 --> 00:50:11,740
Steins up on the ceiling.

1239
00:50:11,740 --> 00:50:12,940
Is that how big it was

1240
00:50:12,940 --> 00:50:13,740
in New Orleans.

1241
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:15,240
It's not

1242
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:17,020
they're about the same it's not that big of

1243
00:50:17,020 --> 00:50:17,720
a how big.

1244
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:18,360
It's not that big.

1245
00:50:19,020 --> 00:50:20,180
Yeah neither is very big.

1246
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:21,080
They're both pretty

1247
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:21,380
small.

1248
00:50:21,540 --> 00:50:22,460
It's a smallish room.

1249
00:50:22,540 --> 00:50:22,900
I think that

1250
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:24,640
is pretty accurate to it.

1251
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:25,080
Okay.

1252
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:26,720
Because this

1253
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:27,660
was our experience.

1254
00:50:27,820 --> 00:50:28,940
I kind of thought we were just

1255
00:50:28,940 --> 00:50:31,080
going to pop in there and not

1256
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:32,200
really hang.

1257
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:34,680
But this this by this point it was

1258
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:35,980
it was just Mike and I.

1259
00:50:36,540 --> 00:50:38,340
And we walked into

1260
00:50:38,340 --> 00:50:40,380
I would say an ideal

1261
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:42,700
situation for

1262
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:44,300
dads approaching 40.

1263
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:48,280
Out on the town.

1264
00:50:49,580 --> 00:50:51,020
Which is a

1265
00:50:51,020 --> 00:50:52,280
mostly empty bar

1266
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:54,120
with

1267
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:56,480
almost entirely empty bar

1268
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:58,640
with plenty of space to sit and not

1269
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:00,400
loud and a guy playing

1270
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:01,580
Ben Folds cover.

1271
00:51:01,660 --> 00:51:01,960
Hey.

1272
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:02,460
Yeah.

1273
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:03,940
This is for you and I.

1274
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:04,600
This is exactly

1275
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:06,700
I heard that and I'm like oh we

1276
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:08,420
we might be sitting around for a while.

1277
00:51:08,660 --> 00:51:08,960
Yeah.

1278
00:51:09,020 --> 00:51:10,660
Two there were only two other people

1279
00:51:10,660 --> 00:51:12,020
in the room I believe.

1280
00:51:12,180 --> 00:51:14,680
Maybe there was one straight person that left quickly.

1281
00:51:14,740 --> 00:51:15,140
Yeah.

1282
00:51:15,260 --> 00:51:16,340
And then yeah there were

1283
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:18,740
there's probably room for like 80

1284
00:51:18,740 --> 00:51:19,660
people in there.

1285
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:20,280
Could be more.

1286
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:20,520
I think

1287
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:21,600
you can pack more in there.

1288
00:51:21,940 --> 00:51:21,940
Yeah.

1289
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,120
And there were four.

1290
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:23,720
Geez.

1291
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:24,660
Which now let me

1292
00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:26,320
let me back up and say

1293
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:28,700
dueling piano bars have been a

1294
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:30,840
a huge issue on this podcast.

1295
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:31,160
Well.

1296
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:31,980
Previous saga

1297
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:34,720
you know that Howl at the Moon place

1298
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:36,220
was not really my vibe.

1299
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:38,560
On this same trip the

1300
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:40,360
next night after this

1301
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:42,920
Jelly Rolls at the Boardwalk Resort

1302
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:44,660
you were drawn

1303
00:51:44,660 --> 00:51:47,080
to like a fly to sugar

1304
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:48,860
and yes I

1305
00:51:48,860 --> 00:51:50,700
I could not wait to get out of there.

1306
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:52,820
I just relistens to the Howl at the Moon

1307
00:51:52,820 --> 00:51:54,480
one where I realized

1308
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:56,620
Lindsay and Erin at the exact same both

1309
00:51:56,620 --> 00:51:58,920
of them were propelled out of this place

1310
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:00,700
like jet fighters pushing

1311
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:01,200
the button.

1312
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:02,640
How fast can I get

1313
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:04,700
out of and I guess I'm usually the

1314
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:05,140
same way.

1315
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:06,700
So to end up looking at

1316
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:08,600
a dueling piano environment and thinking I

1317
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:10,520
think I might want to be here for a little while

1318
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:11,320
was shocking.

1319
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:12,840
I think that's that Pat O'Brien's

1320
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:13,380
ambiance.

1321
00:52:13,740 --> 00:52:14,580
It was really

1322
00:52:14,580 --> 00:52:14,920
that.

1323
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:16,360
I loved the room.

1324
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:16,740
The room

1325
00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:17,060
was great.

1326
00:52:17,060 --> 00:52:17,320
Loved the style.

1327
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:18,240
Loved the ceiling.

1328
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:18,800
Loved the

1329
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:20,780
mold of the brown cozy

1330
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:21,840
intimate.

1331
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:22,560
But

1332
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:24,540
it was not the two gentlemen

1333
00:52:24,540 --> 00:52:26,900
playing the piano even though they would hit some things later

1334
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:27,720
that I would call

1335
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:30,400
let's just call them normie crowd

1336
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:31,180
pleasers.

1337
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:32,520
Which I think

1338
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:34,660
is where the line is generally drawn from

1339
00:52:34,660 --> 00:52:36,160
a Jelly Rolls to here.

1340
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:36,800
Yes.

1341
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:38,640
Generally speaking they're going to play some

1342
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:40,680
songs that are wedding songs.

1343
00:52:40,980 --> 00:52:42,240
They'll play some Journey.

1344
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:42,560
They'll

1345
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:43,760
do we've talked about it many times.

1346
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:44,860
There's three songs

1347
00:52:44,860 --> 00:52:45,640
that they play.

1348
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:46,640
I thought this was going

1349
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:48,880
to be living on a prayer city.

1350
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:50,660
Sweet Caroline City.

1351
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:52,160
That's where I was entering.

1352
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:54,320
Did they play Piano Man?

1353
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:54,820
Which one?

1354
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:55,560
Not with us.

1355
00:52:55,700 --> 00:52:56,120
Not with us.

1356
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:58,500
Does it get played there once a day?

1357
00:52:58,840 --> 00:52:59,160
Yeah maybe.

1358
00:53:00,020 --> 00:53:00,040
Probably.

1359
00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:01,600
They got to fill that room up.

1360
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:02,400
You got a problem with that?

1361
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:06,320
I figured if it was later at night it would probably

1362
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:08,000
be a little sad at midnight.

1363
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:10,480
Even if there's two pianos going back and

1364
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:11,260
forth on it.

1365
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:11,780
Sure.

1366
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:12,380
They should really

1367
00:53:12,380 --> 00:53:13,400
though make it double.

1368
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:16,160
You're the dueling piano men.

1369
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:18,280
They played the saddest, one of the

1370
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:19,700
saddest songs ever.

1371
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:20,280
Two when

1372
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:20,860
we were there.

1373
00:53:21,220 --> 00:53:22,660
What it became

1374
00:53:22,660 --> 00:53:24,300
was we realized okay

1375
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:25,180
we're in good company.

1376
00:53:25,260 --> 00:53:26,600
Even though it was the luckiest

1377
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:28,220
which is a little bit corny

1378
00:53:28,220 --> 00:53:30,160
for my taste within my Ben

1379
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:30,760
Folds.

1380
00:53:31,060 --> 00:53:31,620
However

1381
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:34,340
Ben Folds I feel like is

1382
00:53:34,340 --> 00:53:36,280
where this is where you and I

1383
00:53:36,860 --> 00:53:38,340
have a truce as far

1384
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:39,420
as 90's music.

1385
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:40,480
This is exactly

1386
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:41,300
the intersection.

1387
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:42,520
The Terminator

1388
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:44,280
the Predator Arms

1389
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:45,580
Carl Seng.

1390
00:53:46,340 --> 00:53:48,400
That is where we line

1391
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:48,400
up.

1392
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:50,500
So we both knew we were going to

1393
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:51,220
yeah yeah yes.

1394
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:54,640
And then we realized oh wait

1395
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:56,340
I bet this could just become

1396
00:53:56,340 --> 00:53:58,620
you and I throwing out old

1397
00:53:58,620 --> 00:54:00,140
man music taste

1398
00:54:00,140 --> 00:54:02,640
to these guys who I bet would like

1399
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:04,560
to play stuff that's a little bit

1400
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:06,280
not the usual

1401
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:08,280
not your Bon Jovi's.

1402
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:10,540
We were going back and forth because obviously the way this usually works

1403
00:54:10,540 --> 00:54:12,580
is there's little pieces of paper you go you write it

1404
00:54:12,580 --> 00:54:14,460
down you put it up you put a dollar or two in the

1405
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:16,800
bucket or whatever and that was happening between

1406
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:19,280
us and this couple that was there as well.

1407
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:20,980
And they had previously just been clearly

1408
00:54:20,980 --> 00:54:22,420
getting an entire concert.

1409
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:22,920
Two

1410
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:24,980
pianos playing only for you

1411
00:54:24,980 --> 00:54:25,840
cool.

1412
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:27,300
I'm sorry

1413
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:28,740
I interrupted it for those people.

1414
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:30,960
Yes but we ruined it for them and I believe

1415
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:32,160
I forced them to leave

1416
00:54:32,980 --> 00:54:34,860
not that I picked a bad thing I

1417
00:54:34,860 --> 00:54:36,080
just picked a long thing.

1418
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:36,960
Wichita

1419
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:37,800
linemen.

1420
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:39,680
That was short.

1421
00:54:40,900 --> 00:54:42,280
That might have worked.

1422
00:54:42,620 --> 00:54:43,640
What Mike ended up throwing out.

1423
00:54:43,940 --> 00:54:44,140
I think

1424
00:54:44,140 --> 00:54:46,840
I think everyone was living in harmony for a while.

1425
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:48,740
I think we all were on the same page

1426
00:54:48,740 --> 00:54:49,520
and then we weren't.

1427
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:50,600
Where did this begin?

1428
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:52,340
I think just the desire

1429
00:54:52,340 --> 00:54:54,040
for Randy Newman became

1430
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:56,320
yeah we were talking about that but

1431
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:57,200
that's not yeah.

1432
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:58,420
It's normal if you had a piano

1433
00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:00,280
bar the desire for Randy Newman becomes unstoppable

1434
00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:01,680
and uncontrollable.

1435
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:02,300
Well of course.

1436
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:04,540
Well everyone gets worked into a

1437
00:55:04,540 --> 00:55:06,280
lather as soon as his name is mentioned

1438
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:08,280
and they think of all of his high energy songs

1439
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:10,280
and then they just want to fight

1440
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:12,040
or fuck I guess.

1441
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:13,640
If you really think about it.

1442
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:16,520
I primarily have sex to Randy Newman's music.

1443
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:17,620
Yeah yeah.

1444
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:20,080
So I think I forget

1445
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:20,700
who said it.

1446
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:22,080
Maybe I said Randy Newman and I think

1447
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:24,080
he just I was a little let down because

1448
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:26,520
it was like I think he played you got a friend of me.

1449
00:55:26,820 --> 00:55:27,580
No no no.

1450
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:29,400
We're getting closer.

1451
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:31,280
I think he played maybe

1452
00:55:31,860 --> 00:55:32,660
Sail Away.

1453
00:55:33,020 --> 00:55:34,020
I think he said he

1454
00:55:34,020 --> 00:55:36,040
tried to present it as if it was like an obscure

1455
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:37,940
one and I was like this is the

1456
00:55:37,940 --> 00:55:40,260
most famous album

1457
00:55:40,260 --> 00:55:42,420
we're trying to lure the one especially

1458
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:44,560
there was one who I think like

1459
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:46,560
kept like leaving he's like I don't want to

1460
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:48,380
participate in or

1461
00:55:48,380 --> 00:55:50,560
I think there was one who was there for

1462
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:52,620
crowd pleases and another who seemed really happy

1463
00:55:52,620 --> 00:55:54,800
we were there to test his

1464
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:54,880
metal.

1465
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:56,000
He was an older guy.

1466
00:55:56,620 --> 00:55:58,020
The younger guy kept leaving

1467
00:55:58,020 --> 00:56:00,260
but then the younger guy would come back and play stuff

1468
00:56:00,260 --> 00:56:02,220
that I more liked because

1469
00:56:02,220 --> 00:56:04,260
he would play more like stuff that he

1470
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:06,440
listened to in high school or that I listened to in high

1471
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:08,380
school but then the older guy was happier

1472
00:56:08,380 --> 00:56:10,460
when you would throw a Steely Dan at him

1473
00:56:10,460 --> 00:56:12,520
or when I cleared the room

1474
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:14,460
by suggesting he play Bruce

1475
00:56:14,460 --> 00:56:16,500
Springsteen's 7 or 8 minute song Jungle

1476
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:16,840
Land.

1477
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:18,500
Which he

1478
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:19,780
did in its entirety.

1479
00:56:21,820 --> 00:56:22,780
Sweets, movements,

1480
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:24,380
it was complex.

1481
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:26,380
A lot of it was.

1482
00:56:26,660 --> 00:56:27,680
Steely Dan's complex.

1483
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:30,480
What a Fool Believes was a challenge

1484
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:32,460
that he was excited to take on.

1485
00:56:32,860 --> 00:56:34,360
But I think you know I thought it was good

1486
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:36,600
just for you and I you know how it is.

1487
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:38,000
It's like his parent mode.

1488
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:39,580
Every day is kind of the same.

1489
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:41,800
It's all wonderful but it can get a little samey.

1490
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:44,600
Now you and I were across the country

1491
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:46,720
and we're just making requests

1492
00:56:47,460 --> 00:56:48,780
of this piano.

1493
00:56:48,980 --> 00:56:50,460
Sing us a song piano man.

1494
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:52,720
I was like

1495
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:54,240
Mike and I are only one tick away.

1496
00:56:54,860 --> 00:56:56,920
What we want is to have three drinks

1497
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:57,600
exactly.

1498
00:56:58,460 --> 00:57:00,560
I want to hear Steely Dan and you want to hear Bruce

1499
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:01,320
Springsteen.

1500
00:57:02,780 --> 00:57:04,120
Dad's got what we wanted.

1501
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:06,280
It really was like

1502
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:07,260
Dad make a wish.

1503
00:57:07,460 --> 00:57:08,200
It was really

1504
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:09,900
crazy that it had happened.

1505
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:11,060
It almost lined up.

1506
00:57:11,180 --> 00:57:12,040
There was a magic

1507
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:14,400
I had a feeling of magical

1508
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,380
serendipity that happened

1509
00:57:16,380 --> 00:57:16,960
that night.

1510
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:18,320
It was the first night I was

1511
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:20,400
in Orlando and it was like wow.

1512
00:57:20,780 --> 00:57:22,180
Maybe like going to

1513
00:57:22,180 --> 00:57:24,100
City Walk every night will be

1514
00:57:24,100 --> 00:57:24,760
like this.

1515
00:57:25,220 --> 00:57:26,140
Maybe there's

1516
00:57:26,140 --> 00:57:27,000
actually like.

1517
00:57:27,140 --> 00:57:28,300
Maybe this series won't

1518
00:57:28,300 --> 00:57:30,060
work because there will be too much

1519
00:57:30,060 --> 00:57:32,080
legitimate great

1520
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:33,320
evocative fun.

1521
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:33,600
Right.

1522
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:33,800
Right.

1523
00:57:33,980 --> 00:57:33,980
Right.

1524
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:35,700
Not enough food poisoning.

1525
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:36,120
Now

1526
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:38,220
of course I love Jelly Rolls in a different

1527
00:57:38,220 --> 00:57:40,220
way but I would say this

1528
00:57:40,220 --> 00:57:42,360
might have been the highlight of City

1529
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:42,660
Walk.

1530
00:57:42,780 --> 00:57:43,360
Van just gave us.

1531
00:57:43,420 --> 00:57:43,860
I'm going to call you.

1532
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:44,200
You just

1533
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:45,040
gave us Sly Thumbs Day.

1534
00:57:45,060 --> 00:57:45,920
You've been to Jelly Rolls?

1535
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:46,080
Yeah.

1536
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:46,900
Not a fan of Jelly Rolls.

1537
00:57:47,020 --> 00:57:47,220
Wow.

1538
00:57:47,220 --> 00:57:48,280
You've done Jelly Rolls.

1539
00:57:48,580 --> 00:57:48,580
Really?

1540
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:49,280
Well where.

1541
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:50,200
I'm

1542
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:52,140
a Yachton Beach club stayer myself.

1543
00:57:52,140 --> 00:57:52,720
Oh so you have.

1544
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:53,360
We never talked about that.

1545
00:57:53,620 --> 00:57:53,700
Okay.

1546
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:54,020
Really.

1547
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:55,700
It's quite conveniently located.

1548
00:57:58,940 --> 00:57:59,940
Where would you rather be?

1549
00:57:59,940 --> 00:58:02,180
I'd end up at the ESPN Zone instead.

1550
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:03,120
Wow.

1551
00:58:03,420 --> 00:58:03,600
Yeah.

1552
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:03,840
Yeah.

1553
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:05,500
Right there but

1554
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:07,440
not a Jelly Rolls fan.

1555
00:58:07,460 --> 00:58:08,000
Too high

1556
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:08,380
energy?

1557
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:08,960
Too.

1558
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:09,840
I don't like.

1559
00:58:10,020 --> 00:58:11,540
Well first of all I don't like the space.

1560
00:58:11,820 --> 00:58:12,480
Too big.

1561
00:58:12,660 --> 00:58:13,160
It's big.

1562
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:13,700
I didn't even know.

1563
00:58:13,700 --> 00:58:15,440
I left before I could see it.

1564
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:17,280
Once they said there was a cover.

1565
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:18,060
I'm sorry.

1566
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:19,820
A cover would be involved in this?

1567
00:58:19,820 --> 00:58:20,100
No.

1568
00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:21,880
I mean like a cover when

1569
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:23,900
you're already like basically almost

1570
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:25,860
definitely staying on property at Disney.

1571
00:58:27,260 --> 00:58:27,260
Like.

1572
00:58:27,340 --> 00:58:27,580
Yeah.

1573
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:27,840
Yeah.

1574
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:29,580
Money's already going out the door.

1575
00:58:29,740 --> 00:58:32,000
There's a past guest of the show that DM'd me that

1576
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,040
she went to this place recently

1577
00:58:34,040 --> 00:58:36,040
and I think that's going to have to be an episode eventually

1578
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:37,120
full Jelly Rolls.

1579
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:37,980
I think that's probably

1580
00:58:37,980 --> 00:58:39,260
I think it's deserving of an episode.

1581
00:58:39,420 --> 00:58:39,940
I'll say that.

1582
00:58:40,300 --> 00:58:40,620
I understand.

1583
00:58:41,660 --> 00:58:43,800
I'm not a fan of it but

1584
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:45,280
that could be said about many things.

1585
00:58:45,300 --> 00:58:45,940
Deserving of

1586
00:58:45,940 --> 00:58:47,080
episodes potentially.

1587
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:48,160
Potentially.

1588
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:49,040
A lot of it.

1589
00:58:49,380 --> 00:58:49,380
Yeah.

1590
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:49,680
Yeah.

1591
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:49,920
Sure.

1592
00:58:50,980 --> 00:58:51,780
But then

1593
00:58:51,780 --> 00:58:53,900
sorry should we go back to the do you have a full

1594
00:58:53,900 --> 00:58:55,380
you didn't write the full set list down.

1595
00:58:55,580 --> 00:58:55,860
I worked down

1596
00:58:55,860 --> 00:58:58,020
anything that I took a video of.

1597
00:58:58,540 --> 00:58:58,540
Yeah.

1598
00:58:58,820 --> 00:58:59,960
So just real quick though

1599
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:01,960
none of you have been to the real

1600
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:02,800
Pat O'Brien's.

1601
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:02,960
No.

1602
00:59:03,140 --> 00:59:03,340
No.

1603
00:59:03,460 --> 00:59:03,460
No.

1604
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:03,500
No.

1605
00:59:03,500 --> 00:59:03,500
No.

1606
00:59:03,500 --> 00:59:03,700
No.

1607
00:59:03,700 --> 00:59:04,000
What about

1608
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,560
the city of New Orleans at all.

1609
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:06,160
No.

1610
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:06,380
No.

1611
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:06,480
No.

1612
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:06,520
No.

1613
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:06,520
No.

1614
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:06,520
No.

1615
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:06,920
I have not.

1616
00:59:08,140 --> 00:59:09,500
Well you know what it's not that

1617
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:11,920
close enough simulacrum of that slice I would

1618
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:12,240
actually say.

1619
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:12,980
Wow really?

1620
00:59:13,340 --> 00:59:13,940
Just that

1621
00:59:13,940 --> 00:59:14,200
slice.

1622
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:14,200
It's kind of surprising.

1623
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:15,700
As soon as you walk outside and

1624
00:59:15,700 --> 00:59:18,000
it doesn't smell like piss and everyone's

1625
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,920
not stumbling around still drinking with open

1626
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:21,980
containers then it's no

1627
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:23,160
longer the same but

1628
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:25,260
that is mostly wound down.

1629
00:59:25,340 --> 00:59:27,200
Right up until that exit.

1630
00:59:27,380 --> 00:59:29,260
Of course you can walk around with an open

1631
00:59:29,260 --> 00:59:30,780
container at City Walk Orlando though.

1632
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:31,300
Yes that is

1633
00:59:31,300 --> 00:59:31,720
the difference.

1634
00:59:31,940 --> 00:59:32,460
That is nice.

1635
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:33,160
I think those probably unless

1636
00:59:33,160 --> 00:59:35,500
it's the busiest Friday night in the summer

1637
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:36,100
I think.

1638
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:37,180
It's probably not getting

1639
00:59:37,180 --> 00:59:38,400
close to New Orleans vibes.

1640
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:39,300
Before you get into

1641
00:59:39,300 --> 00:59:41,360
your set list which I think you want to launch

1642
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:43,360
into more of because I'm sure the listeners need to

1643
00:59:43,360 --> 00:59:44,420
hear every other song.

1644
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:46,740
They love a list.

1645
00:59:47,460 --> 00:59:49,240
It's a shame none of you have had

1646
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:51,180
the hurricane because I did have a good

1647
00:59:51,180 --> 00:59:53,180
Pat O'Brien's hurricane anecdote.

1648
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:54,460
Oh yeah please.

1649
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:57,240
So my cousin's husband when he was

1650
00:59:57,240 --> 00:59:59,380
in high school he had a job mixing up the

1651
00:59:59,380 --> 01:00:01,260
hurricanes at Pat O'Brien's so they batch

1652
01:00:01,260 --> 01:00:02,500
them in the daytime.

1653
01:00:03,120 --> 01:00:05,460
And they serve them out of big giant

1654
01:00:05,460 --> 01:00:06,220
coolers.

1655
01:00:07,380 --> 01:00:09,100
So it's a rum punch

1656
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:09,560
drink.

1657
01:00:11,100 --> 01:00:13,040
He said that the Mexican

1658
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:15,140
rum that they made them from

1659
01:00:15,140 --> 01:00:17,240
was so cheap that it

1660
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:19,220
would come in crates and the crates

1661
01:00:19,220 --> 01:00:21,500
would regularly have one or two completely

1662
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:23,580
empty bottles in them.

1663
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:25,000
But they just were like

1664
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,260
that's fine.

1665
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:29,600
So that'll give you

1666
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:31,220
a sense of the

1667
01:00:31,220 --> 01:00:33,400
just the just how

1668
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:35,160
sugared up a hurricane

1669
01:00:35,160 --> 01:00:35,600
is.

1670
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:37,660
The rum

1671
01:00:37,660 --> 01:00:39,660
quality could be whatever

1672
01:00:39,660 --> 01:00:41,440
it needs to be.

1673
01:00:41,460 --> 01:00:43,460
But they would mix them up in giant

1674
01:00:43,460 --> 01:00:44,780
like

1675
01:00:44,780 --> 01:00:47,040
oil drum vats.

1676
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:49,380
And then that would get

1677
01:00:49,380 --> 01:00:50,940
spread out to the like

1678
01:00:50,940 --> 01:00:53,200
ladled into the

1679
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:55,340
like a Gatorade

1680
01:00:55,340 --> 01:00:56,860
cooler type storage.

1681
01:00:57,440 --> 01:00:59,060
To then be

1682
01:00:59,060 --> 01:01:01,000
put into their fancy little glasses

1683
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,340
and sold for $18 a person

1684
01:01:03,340 --> 01:01:04,040
to tourists.

1685
01:01:04,900 --> 01:01:07,140
Pat O'Brien's I'm seeing on

1686
01:01:07,140 --> 01:01:09,140
the website there's also about

1687
01:01:09,140 --> 01:01:11,080
10 different including

1688
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:13,300
the hurricane bottled mixes.

1689
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:15,040
Everything from

1690
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:17,620
triple sack to pina colada

1691
01:01:17,620 --> 01:01:18,960
mix, margarita mix,

1692
01:01:19,180 --> 01:01:20,100
daiquiri mix.

1693
01:01:21,580 --> 01:01:23,300
You get a good hurricane

1694
01:01:23,300 --> 01:01:23,660
mix.

1695
01:01:24,700 --> 01:01:25,020
They have a

1696
01:01:25,020 --> 01:01:27,360
they're tied up with one of the cocktail

1697
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:28,740
distributor people.

1698
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:31,160
A lot of the companies that the liquor distributors

1699
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:33,310
and the mixer distributors are actually based in

1700
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:35,100
New Orleans.

1701
01:01:35,220 --> 01:01:37,420
The cocktail was invented in New Orleans.

1702
01:01:38,020 --> 01:01:39,060
Is Bipad O'Brien

1703
01:01:39,060 --> 01:01:41,270
personally or at least the lore might go

1704
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:42,600
as such?

1705
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:45,320
Well there's a, it was actually at a pharmacy

1706
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:46,740
where it was first invented.

1707
01:01:46,980 --> 01:01:47,440
Really, really?

1708
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:47,740
Yes.

1709
01:01:49,100 --> 01:01:50,560
But so that

1710
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:52,480
business is actually still like an actual

1711
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:54,660
import export business that likes

1712
01:01:54,660 --> 01:01:56,660
where this stuff gets shipped around the world.

1713
01:01:57,060 --> 01:01:58,580
So they are hooked up with

1714
01:01:58,580 --> 01:02:00,700
one of the like people who make

1715
01:02:00,700 --> 01:02:02,800
the sour mix you get

1716
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:04,360
in a normal grocery store.

1717
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:06,760
And so like you could, you'll

1718
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:08,940
end up sometimes seeing Pat O'Brien's

1719
01:02:08,940 --> 01:02:10,660
hurricane mix just like you might see

1720
01:02:10,660 --> 01:02:12,780
in a grocery store out here just because

1721
01:02:12,780 --> 01:02:14,700
it's distributed by one of the same companies.

1722
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:16,900
But yeah they have their own set

1723
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:18,840
of mixers and mixes and the

1724
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:20,940
the powdered hurricane

1725
01:02:20,940 --> 01:02:22,760
mix that they distribute

1726
01:02:22,760 --> 01:02:24,820
is pretty accurate to the real

1727
01:02:24,820 --> 01:02:25,120
deal.

1728
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:26,280
What else is it?

1729
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:26,760
What else goes

1730
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:27,300
into it?

1731
01:02:27,460 --> 01:02:28,200
What's in a hurricane?

1732
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:29,840
It's basically

1733
01:02:30,460 --> 01:02:32,340
rum, sugar and red.

1734
01:02:32,660 --> 01:02:33,180
What's red?

1735
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:34,120
Are there three ingredients?

1736
01:02:35,140 --> 01:02:36,060
Red food coloring?

1737
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:36,800
Punch.

1738
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:38,680
You know I'll tell you the powder

1739
01:02:38,680 --> 01:02:39,100
is white.

1740
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:40,740
It doesn't turn red until you add

1741
01:02:40,740 --> 01:02:42,220
water, whatever it is.

1742
01:02:43,700 --> 01:02:44,820
But yeah it's

1743
01:02:44,820 --> 01:02:46,680
like a fruit punch type

1744
01:02:47,500 --> 01:02:49,000
rum punch beverage

1745
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:50,740
and so some sort of

1746
01:02:50,740 --> 01:02:52,680
artificial fruit punch flavoring.

1747
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:55,120
So if you would end it tonight

1748
01:02:55,120 --> 01:02:56,900
with one of these you might have

1749
01:02:56,900 --> 01:02:59,060
been going to Orlando General.

1750
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:00,660
Yes

1751
01:03:00,660 --> 01:03:02,920
and I've been a big

1752
01:03:02,920 --> 01:03:04,280
fruit punch at the end of the day.

1753
01:03:06,540 --> 01:03:08,100
Yes the like

1754
01:03:08,100 --> 01:03:10,260
sugary fruit punch disguises

1755
01:03:10,260 --> 01:03:11,860
the large amount of alcohol in it.

1756
01:03:11,860 --> 01:03:12,980
But I think

1757
01:03:12,980 --> 01:03:13,860
ultimately

1758
01:03:14,520 --> 01:03:15,480
the sugar

1759
01:03:16,100 --> 01:03:18,300
will cause you more of a hangover than the liquor.

1760
01:03:18,420 --> 01:03:20,180
Oh yeah and this is the true

1761
01:03:20,180 --> 01:03:22,260
villain of my drinking career as I

1762
01:03:22,260 --> 01:03:23,820
approach 40 is that.

1763
01:03:24,100 --> 01:03:24,160
Yeah

1764
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:26,000
the sugar is far more of a problem.

1765
01:03:28,300 --> 01:03:30,140
Now look I don't need to read

1766
01:03:30,140 --> 01:03:30,740
the list.

1767
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:31,500
I have no…

1768
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:32,600
Refresh me.

1769
01:03:32,780 --> 01:03:34,560
Give me a little bit of the list I think.

1770
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:35,340
Just quick.

1771
01:03:35,340 --> 01:03:37,540
The thing that I thought was funny is that

1772
01:03:37,540 --> 01:03:39,500
I did feel like I was saying how nice it was for dads

1773
01:03:39,500 --> 01:03:41,480
to get out but then I do feel

1774
01:03:41,480 --> 01:03:43,480
like we were punished by having to hear cats in

1775
01:03:43,480 --> 01:03:44,020
the cradle.

1776
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:45,820
Oh oh yeah.

1777
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:47,060
How dare we leave.

1778
01:03:47,100 --> 01:03:48,160
That's a penance.

1779
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:48,860
Yeah yeah.

1780
01:03:48,980 --> 01:03:49,360
We didn't

1781
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:49,840
request that.

1782
01:03:49,900 --> 01:03:51,040
We had to sit no no no.

1783
01:03:51,100 --> 01:03:51,520
It's like they

1784
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:51,780
knew.

1785
01:03:51,940 --> 01:03:52,220
Yeah.

1786
01:03:52,320 --> 01:03:53,440
Let's give these let's cut

1787
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:54,560
these guys down.

1788
01:03:55,640 --> 01:03:56,480
No I don't know.

1789
01:03:56,560 --> 01:03:57,400
Well you look you got your

1790
01:03:57,400 --> 01:03:59,160
big surprise Bear Naked Ladies is the…

1791
01:03:59,260 --> 01:04:01,400
Well that's the younger guy came back and he just

1792
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:03,240
out of nowhere plays one week

1793
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:04,640
by the Bear Naked Ladies.

1794
01:04:05,220 --> 01:04:06,860
Was not my request and then yeah

1795
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:09,260
we said this already that I dared him

1796
01:04:09,260 --> 01:04:11,020
to go deeper more obscure.

1797
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:13,180
Either gentleman to go more obscure.

1798
01:04:14,040 --> 01:04:15,140
And one of the guys like

1799
01:04:15,140 --> 01:04:16,800
I know exactly what I'm going to play.

1800
01:04:17,060 --> 01:04:19,460
I was playing this all the time when we were outside

1801
01:04:19,460 --> 01:04:21,080
during the pandemic and he made the

1802
01:04:21,080 --> 01:04:23,140
he was like this kind of became like a

1803
01:04:23,140 --> 01:04:25,320
song I really really like and I was like oh my

1804
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:26,180
god what is he going to play.

1805
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:27,340
This is going to be crazy or whatever.

1806
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:28,920
And then he played the song

1807
01:04:29,500 --> 01:04:31,420
Odds Are which is a post

1808
01:04:31,420 --> 01:04:33,540
Stephen Page leaving Bear Naked Ladies song

1809
01:04:33,540 --> 01:04:35,240
which I am not

1810
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:37,540
I don't fuck with them much

1811
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:39,500
anymore ever since Stephen

1812
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:39,880
left.

1813
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:39,920
Wow.

1814
01:04:40,280 --> 01:04:40,780
Language.

1815
01:04:40,980 --> 01:04:43,280
I apologize second time I said it twice

1816
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:45,420
but I'm so passionate about rock and roll music

1817
01:04:45,420 --> 01:04:47,400
that that sometimes just gets me all

1818
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:49,580
frothy like a Randy Newman song.

1819
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:50,460
Sugar.

1820
01:04:50,740 --> 01:04:51,520
I had a feeling

1821
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:53,450
that it was a post Stephen leaving

1822
01:04:54,080 --> 01:04:55,640
song and I think I knew it

1823
01:04:55,640 --> 01:04:57,500
because five seconds

1824
01:04:57,500 --> 01:04:59,500
in you leaned to me in a video

1825
01:04:59,500 --> 01:05:01,780
I have and said this is after Stephen left.

1826
01:05:01,840 --> 01:05:02,780
I wanted him to make sure.

1827
01:05:03,040 --> 01:05:03,640
Now that being

1828
01:05:03,640 --> 01:05:05,540
said it's one of the look at his

1829
01:05:05,540 --> 01:05:07,720
at his chaste hits ever since

1830
01:05:07,720 --> 01:05:08,120
okay.

1831
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:09,600
Ed Robertson of course who does the

1832
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:10,620
rapping on one week.

1833
01:05:10,660 --> 01:05:11,400
Stephen's the one who sings

1834
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:13,100
it's been that's his voice.

1835
01:05:13,540 --> 01:05:13,660
Jason

1836
01:05:13,660 --> 01:05:14,980
of course doesn't even know any of this.

1837
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:15,560
He didn't when he saw

1838
01:05:15,560 --> 01:05:17,620
the Bear Naked Ladies he didn't realize Stephen was out of the band.

1839
01:05:17,860 --> 01:05:19,620
So this might be an average concert

1840
01:05:19,620 --> 01:05:20,660
go or not realizing it.

1841
01:05:20,840 --> 01:05:21,180
So I have

1842
01:05:21,180 --> 01:05:23,080
been out of shape about it.

1843
01:05:23,660 --> 01:05:24,680
Let's educate everybody.

1844
01:05:24,760 --> 01:05:25,740
It's not your fault.

1845
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:27,640
Well I thought he was going to

1846
01:05:27,640 --> 01:05:29,840
be like I'll go deeper and he just pulls

1847
01:05:29,840 --> 01:05:31,880
out if I had a million dollars.

1848
01:05:32,020 --> 01:05:34,000
Well sure I mean that you could also say well it's not

1849
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:34,660
so.

1850
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:35,880
Van how lost are you?

1851
01:05:36,020 --> 01:05:38,060
What is your and are you

1852
01:05:38,060 --> 01:05:39,640
anxious to get past the Bear Naked Ladies material.

1853
01:05:39,640 --> 01:05:41,680
He's anxious to get past but I don't think he's lost.

1854
01:05:42,320 --> 01:05:43,840
He got me back at had a million

1855
01:05:43,840 --> 01:05:44,380
dollars.

1856
01:05:44,740 --> 01:05:45,140
Sure.

1857
01:05:45,660 --> 01:05:47,960
That was on a radio hit.

1858
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:49,500
Can you pull up

1859
01:05:50,580 --> 01:05:53,320
can you pull up a music video for it?

1860
01:05:53,660 --> 01:05:53,760
Can you pull up

1861
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:55,900
the Odds Are music video which I have watched which is

1862
01:05:55,900 --> 01:05:58,100
about all the different like things that could happen

1863
01:05:58,100 --> 01:05:59,800
in your life but Odds Are you're going to be alright.

1864
01:06:00,060 --> 01:06:01,740
Odds Are we're going to be alright tonight.

1865
01:06:02,180 --> 01:06:03,440
I do know the chorus too.

1866
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:04,220
I mean that's honestly

1867
01:06:04,220 --> 01:06:05,900
that's kind of a good little anthem

1868
01:06:05,900 --> 01:06:07,980
for the series because Odds Were

1869
01:06:07,980 --> 01:06:10,140
we were all going to get sick

1870
01:06:10,140 --> 01:06:12,380
and tired of lots of aspects

1871
01:06:12,380 --> 01:06:12,860
of this.

1872
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:14,120
But we were alright.

1873
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:19,800
I've got Bear Naked Ladies perform Odds Are at Billboard

1874
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:20,680
Studio.

1875
01:06:21,840 --> 01:06:21,840
Yeah.

1876
01:06:22,140 --> 01:06:24,000
You want the real you want the video where they're

1877
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:25,040
like newscasters.

1878
01:06:25,240 --> 01:06:25,900
Can you can those.

1879
01:06:26,020 --> 01:06:26,940
Oh there we go.

1880
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:27,180
Yep.

1881
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:27,760
Got it.

1882
01:06:28,120 --> 01:06:28,700
Okay good.

1883
01:06:28,780 --> 01:06:29,740
Can the Vision Pro

1884
01:06:30,700 --> 01:06:31,920
somehow insert Steven

1885
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:33,440
back into the band.

1886
01:06:33,480 --> 01:06:34,140
Yeah but the song

1887
01:06:34,140 --> 01:06:36,080
wouldn't sound right because then it'd sound like one he

1888
01:06:36,080 --> 01:06:37,300
would have worked on with him.

1889
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:39,540
We can hear that.

1890
01:06:39,540 --> 01:06:40,880
We can hear that a little bit.

1891
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:41,960
That's kind of bizarre.

1892
01:06:41,980 --> 01:06:44,000
Do I have permission to place this over

1893
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:44,980
Jason or?

1894
01:06:45,300 --> 01:06:46,160
Do you put it over me?

1895
01:06:46,280 --> 01:06:47,280
Do you place it over me?

1896
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:49,140
Because he's not a fan.

1897
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:51,540
That's just justice.

1898
01:06:51,540 --> 01:06:53,540
Is there a program that can insert Jason

1899
01:06:53,540 --> 01:06:55,100
into the Odds Are music video?

1900
01:06:55,220 --> 01:06:55,940
It's playing.

1901
01:06:56,160 --> 01:06:56,760
I haven't accidentally.

1902
01:06:57,600 --> 01:06:59,480
Jason's singing a song or whatever.

1903
01:07:01,480 --> 01:07:02,040
There's a

1904
01:07:02,040 --> 01:07:03,700
new Bear Naked Ladies song called Love and Life

1905
01:07:03,700 --> 01:07:05,600
which is maybe the most pandery song

1906
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:07,000
I've ever heard in my life.

1907
01:07:07,300 --> 01:07:07,640
Geez you

1908
01:07:07,640 --> 01:07:08,320
hate these guys.

1909
01:07:08,340 --> 01:07:09,180
No I don't.

1910
01:07:09,380 --> 01:07:09,640
I feel

1911
01:07:09,640 --> 01:07:09,800
bad.

1912
01:07:09,860 --> 01:07:11,360
I'm so negative about it.

1913
01:07:11,720 --> 01:07:13,620
There's a song called Love and Life that I'm not a big

1914
01:07:13,620 --> 01:07:14,300
fan of.

1915
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:15,900
But he then played

1916
01:07:16,840 --> 01:07:17,560
the other

1917
01:07:18,340 --> 01:07:18,780
one.

1918
01:07:20,740 --> 01:07:21,320
You're a

1919
01:07:21,320 --> 01:07:22,700
one man DJ over there.

1920
01:07:23,560 --> 01:07:24,320
I just want to make sure.

1921
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:26,420
So he played it.

1922
01:07:26,420 --> 01:07:26,820
Honestly

1923
01:07:26,820 --> 01:07:29,040
I was kind of delighted though to be

1924
01:07:29,040 --> 01:07:29,900
all kidding aside.

1925
01:07:30,140 --> 01:07:30,500
I was like.

1926
01:07:30,500 --> 01:07:31,880
It's a good test of the speakers.

1927
01:07:32,140 --> 01:07:33,360
Can it pass through

1928
01:07:33,360 --> 01:07:34,100
the.

1929
01:07:34,100 --> 01:07:34,800
Because this is going through

1930
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:35,620
so many mediums.

1931
01:07:35,720 --> 01:07:37,080
Vision Pro 2 Microphone

1932
01:07:37,080 --> 01:07:38,840
into Zoom into Podcast App

1933
01:07:38,840 --> 01:07:40,780
into Listener's car or

1934
01:07:40,780 --> 01:07:41,240
headset.

1935
01:07:41,420 --> 01:07:42,700
How did that sound?

1936
01:07:42,920 --> 01:07:43,760
Rated for me?

1937
01:07:45,840 --> 01:07:46,880
Honestly I

1938
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:48,620
was delighted that this was the choice.

1939
01:07:48,760 --> 01:07:49,020
I was

1940
01:07:49,020 --> 01:07:50,880
just not expecting this of anything.

1941
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:52,840
And he was just like he gave a

1942
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:55,020
little moving speech about how this

1943
01:07:55,020 --> 01:07:56,900
song kind of meant something to him because he was playing

1944
01:07:56,900 --> 01:07:58,500
it outside and there's so much

1945
01:07:58,940 --> 01:08:00,820
uncertainty about the pandemic and

1946
01:08:00,820 --> 01:08:02,900
they moved the piano out there and he's

1947
01:08:02,900 --> 01:08:04,860
playing this late period

1948
01:08:04,860 --> 01:08:06,960
Bear Naked Ladies song tearing up every night.

1949
01:08:07,020 --> 01:08:09,020
I'm imagining this whole story he's got.

1950
01:08:09,700 --> 01:08:10,940
So I was like ah this is

1951
01:08:10,940 --> 01:08:11,260
good.

1952
01:08:11,640 --> 01:08:12,040
This is good.

1953
01:08:12,060 --> 01:08:12,800
Now I kind of like

1954
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:14,580
the song because of that.

1955
01:08:14,580 --> 01:08:15,120
Wow.

1956
01:08:15,300 --> 01:08:15,660
Wow.

1957
01:08:15,780 --> 01:08:16,740
Because of that performance.

1958
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:17,420
You know what.

1959
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:18,300
And I like the guy in general.

1960
01:08:18,340 --> 01:08:18,760
We went up

1961
01:08:18,760 --> 01:08:19,700
and talked to them after.

1962
01:08:19,840 --> 01:08:20,320
We were like what?

1963
01:08:20,500 --> 01:08:21,880
They're just playing everything we like.

1964
01:08:22,220 --> 01:08:22,720
And I

1965
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:24,660
think the guy was Rob the piano guy.

1966
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:26,020
I sent him a memo.

1967
01:08:26,320 --> 01:08:26,320
Yeah.

1968
01:08:26,460 --> 01:08:26,800
Oh geez.

1969
01:08:26,900 --> 01:08:27,080
Oh great.

1970
01:08:27,080 --> 01:08:28,220
I could look it up.

1971
01:08:29,220 --> 01:08:30,540
I think he was

1972
01:08:30,540 --> 01:08:32,660
a Howl at the Moon person around when I

1973
01:08:32,660 --> 01:08:34,380
worked at Universal Hollywood.

1974
01:08:35,060 --> 01:08:36,000
So great job.

1975
01:08:36,380 --> 01:08:36,580
They

1976
01:08:36,580 --> 01:08:38,180
closed it out with a bunch of Abbey Road.

1977
01:08:38,440 --> 01:08:38,900
We got a bunch of.

1978
01:08:38,900 --> 01:08:39,180
Oh yeah.

1979
01:08:39,360 --> 01:08:39,740
We forgot all about that.

1980
01:08:39,760 --> 01:08:40,720
What a great way to

1981
01:08:40,720 --> 01:08:40,740
end.

1982
01:08:41,560 --> 01:08:42,740
Did Dave Matthews

1983
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:43,640
play the song.

1984
01:08:43,640 --> 01:08:44,000
I texted Mitch.

1985
01:08:44,040 --> 01:08:44,780
I'm like there's a guy

1986
01:08:44,780 --> 01:08:46,240
playing like two step

1987
01:08:46,240 --> 01:08:48,240
by Dave Matthews.

1988
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:48,640
Wow.

1989
01:08:49,020 --> 01:08:50,320
Mitch got excited about that.

1990
01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:50,820
Wow.

1991
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:51,280
Wow.

1992
01:08:51,380 --> 01:08:52,980
You're lighting up people across the

1993
01:08:52,980 --> 01:08:53,220
country.

1994
01:08:53,440 --> 01:08:54,980
Keep Me in Your Heart for a While is the one

1995
01:08:54,980 --> 01:08:57,040
the saddest song ever they wrote when he was dying.

1996
01:08:57,340 --> 01:08:58,080
Oh I forget that.

1997
01:08:58,120 --> 01:08:59,100
So yeah I was like

1998
01:08:59,100 --> 01:08:59,680
like touched.

1999
01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:01,000
I was touched many times.

2000
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:01,520
You know what.

2001
01:09:01,760 --> 01:09:03,100
It was like an intimate

2002
01:09:03,100 --> 01:09:04,800
cool performance that reminded

2003
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:05,040
me.

2004
01:09:05,160 --> 01:09:07,200
Mike you and I are both very fond of the Largo.

2005
01:09:07,280 --> 01:09:07,680
Yeah.

2006
01:09:07,820 --> 01:09:08,580
John composer John

2007
01:09:08,580 --> 01:09:10,880
Bryan's performances at the Largo where he kind of

2008
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:13,000
goes through the great American songbook

2009
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,200
and you can request off the wall things

2010
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:16,560
and see what inspires you.

2011
01:09:16,680 --> 01:09:16,680
Yeah.

2012
01:09:16,720 --> 01:09:19,200
I could not believe how much this dueling piano

2013
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:20,840
bar in Orlando was giving

2014
01:09:20,840 --> 01:09:22,420
vibes of these Largo shows.

2015
01:09:22,680 --> 01:09:22,880
I liked

2016
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:24,420
the candlelit atmosphere.

2017
01:09:24,820 --> 01:09:26,820
This was one of the big shockers

2018
01:09:26,820 --> 01:09:27,580
of the trip.

2019
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:28,880
I would say go to Pat

2020
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:31,020
O'Brien's but do it on an

2021
01:09:31,020 --> 01:09:32,800
empty Tuesday or Wednesday.

2022
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:34,820
Unless you do

2023
01:09:34,820 --> 01:09:35,600
want to hear.

2024
01:09:35,620 --> 01:09:36,740
But not on an empty stomach

2025
01:09:36,740 --> 01:09:37,860
if you're going to get a hurricane.

2026
01:09:37,860 --> 01:09:38,620
Yeah.

2027
01:09:38,620 --> 01:09:39,280
Very smart.

2028
01:09:39,620 --> 01:09:40,000
Get a

2029
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:41,400
cup of gumbo with it.

2030
01:09:41,660 --> 01:09:42,180
Cup of gumbo

2031
01:09:42,180 --> 01:09:42,500
to go.

2032
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:44,100
Cup of gumbo and a hurricane.

2033
01:09:44,240 --> 01:09:46,040
Boy that seems like a

2034
01:09:46,040 --> 01:09:47,440
classic city walk.

2035
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:48,080
Yum yum.

2036
01:09:48,140 --> 01:09:49,020
Poor decision.

2037
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:51,980
And yet a tribute to the freedom

2038
01:09:51,980 --> 01:09:53,200
that you have when you're there.

2039
01:09:53,500 --> 01:09:53,780
Freedom

2040
01:09:53,780 --> 01:09:54,700
is a tribute to freedom.

2041
01:09:54,700 --> 01:09:55,640
Fuck yourself up.

2042
01:09:55,780 --> 01:09:58,080
Have we missed anything about one of these places?

2043
01:09:58,840 --> 01:09:59,760
Any important

2044
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:00,080
details?

2045
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:00,940
I don't think so.

2046
01:10:01,020 --> 01:10:02,200
Because I think this is a great

2047
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:02,540
revisit.

2048
01:10:02,540 --> 01:10:03,060
I think we've covered

2049
01:10:03,060 --> 01:10:04,040
most of it.

2050
01:10:04,220 --> 01:10:05,060
No I think we got it.

2051
01:10:05,100 --> 01:10:06,040
Both these places

2052
01:10:06,040 --> 01:10:06,160
are important.

2053
01:10:06,160 --> 01:10:07,120
I think also

2054
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:08,280
I was going to say benefit.

2055
01:10:08,340 --> 01:10:08,920
That's not the word.

2056
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:11,420
But like are victims of their placement

2057
01:10:11,420 --> 01:10:12,780
in City Walk at this point.

2058
01:10:13,260 --> 01:10:14,920
Pat O'Brien's way back there.

2059
01:10:15,300 --> 01:10:17,560
I've been airdropped a photo from Van.

2060
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:18,240
Great.

2061
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:19,220
Thank you.

2062
01:10:19,400 --> 01:10:20,800
This is so efficient for just

2063
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:23,180
getting all our future content out.

2064
01:10:23,380 --> 01:10:24,020
Thank you.

2065
01:10:25,260 --> 01:10:26,900
So I almost wish like

2066
01:10:26,900 --> 01:10:28,840
there were more people like

2067
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:30,320
oh I missed my airdrop.

2068
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:31,760
Okay I've accepted it now.

2069
01:10:32,200 --> 01:10:32,880
Is it Ed

2070
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:34,000
in the music video?

2071
01:10:34,100 --> 01:10:34,820
I think it is.

2072
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:37,760
Over Jason?

2073
01:10:38,040 --> 01:10:38,740
Well almost.

2074
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:40,100
I scooted it over.

2075
01:10:40,920 --> 01:10:41,740
Jason's spoken through.

2076
01:10:42,280 --> 01:10:42,280
Okay.

2077
01:10:43,340 --> 01:10:43,860
Great.

2078
01:10:45,020 --> 01:10:45,020
So

2079
01:10:45,020 --> 01:10:47,160
yeah I think you know there should be

2080
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:49,240
people there that are more like directing people

2081
01:10:49,240 --> 01:10:50,940
towards these establishments.

2082
01:10:51,560 --> 01:10:52,980
There's signs with arrows.

2083
01:10:53,200 --> 01:10:54,340
Yeah but you don't see those.

2084
01:10:54,660 --> 01:10:56,500
Something that says like food, drink, shops.

2085
01:10:56,760 --> 01:10:57,940
And then there's an escalator.

2086
01:10:58,020 --> 01:10:58,720
But it's not enough.

2087
01:10:58,940 --> 01:11:01,000
You want to make sure these places don't disappear.

2088
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:02,640
They do have unique menus.

2089
01:11:02,900 --> 01:11:04,380
Like unique food offerings.

2090
01:11:04,700 --> 01:11:07,220
I'm surprised our family never made our way back.

2091
01:11:07,420 --> 01:11:09,140
It's because of placement I bet.

2092
01:11:12,980 --> 01:11:14,180
It's part of the

2093
01:11:14,180 --> 01:11:17,000
I like the sprawling nature of this place

2094
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:18,960
with these little secret rooms almost.

2095
01:11:19,340 --> 01:11:20,980
But maybe they suffer because of them.

2096
01:11:21,320 --> 01:11:22,340
So listeners check them out.

2097
01:11:22,680 --> 01:11:24,840
You want the intimacy as I always say.

2098
01:11:24,920 --> 01:11:27,000
You want the intimacy so you don't want it

2099
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:28,080
to be completely packed.

2100
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:28,960
But you don't want it

2101
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:30,440
to become closed either.

2102
01:11:31,140 --> 01:11:32,020
And I don't like

2103
01:11:32,020 --> 01:11:34,960
you don't want it to become more of a douchey

2104
01:11:35,820 --> 01:11:36,140
jelly rolls.

2105
01:11:36,300 --> 01:11:36,580
Because again

2106
01:11:36,580 --> 01:11:39,060
you get your jelly rolls filled at Disney World.

2107
01:11:39,540 --> 01:11:39,540
Yeah.

2108
01:11:39,720 --> 01:11:40,840
Well I will say

2109
01:11:40,840 --> 01:11:42,520
both of these places have been open

2110
01:11:42,520 --> 01:11:45,020
without change since 1999.

2111
01:11:45,820 --> 01:11:46,940
So I'm not terribly concerned.

2112
01:11:46,940 --> 01:11:48,720
So Universal forgot that they're there.

2113
01:11:48,820 --> 01:11:51,040
And with other ones that have changed a ton.

2114
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:53,220
Motown Cafe didn't make it.

2115
01:11:53,220 --> 01:11:55,260
I do think their tucked away

2116
01:11:55,260 --> 01:11:57,260
placement has helped them

2117
01:11:57,260 --> 01:11:59,400
to weather the storms.

2118
01:11:59,760 --> 01:11:59,760
Oh!

2119
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:01,100
As opposed to like that

2120
01:12:02,120 --> 01:12:03,480
Motown Cafe got

2121
01:12:03,480 --> 01:12:05,200
asked for Bubba Gump because it was

2122
01:12:05,200 --> 01:12:06,180
prime position.

2123
01:12:06,620 --> 01:12:07,260
They're eyeing

2124
01:12:07,260 --> 01:12:09,280
those ones kind of on the

2125
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:10,380
main alley more.

2126
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:11,620
Yeah.

2127
01:12:11,720 --> 01:12:12,500
That's a good point.

2128
01:12:12,660 --> 01:12:13,320
Well I hope they

2129
01:12:13,320 --> 01:12:15,640
stay tucked away there forever.

2130
01:12:16,580 --> 01:12:17,400
Fun and freedom

2131
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:18,940
is what you can find in this sector.

2132
01:12:19,220 --> 01:12:21,420
And Van we thank you for experiencing both of those

2133
01:12:21,420 --> 01:12:21,640
things.

2134
01:12:21,900 --> 01:12:22,880
And technology.

2135
01:12:23,080 --> 01:12:25,480
Thank you for the tribute to technology.

2136
01:12:25,480 --> 01:12:26,540
Of course.

2137
01:12:26,660 --> 01:12:27,520
Van Roche Show You Survive

2138
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:29,800
podcast, The Ride, The City Walk Orlando Saga

2139
01:12:29,800 --> 01:12:30,860
Multiverse of Madness.

2140
01:12:31,180 --> 01:12:31,620
Let's exit

2141
01:12:31,620 --> 01:12:32,640
through the plug portal.

2142
01:12:32,780 --> 01:12:33,480
Is there anything you'd like

2143
01:12:33,480 --> 01:12:33,940
to plug?

2144
01:12:34,780 --> 01:12:35,480
First the

2145
01:12:35,480 --> 01:12:36,840
Apple Vision Pro.

2146
01:12:37,860 --> 01:12:39,500
My buddy Tim wanted me

2147
01:12:39,500 --> 01:12:40,900
to plug that on the show.

2148
01:12:41,240 --> 01:12:41,520
Sure.

2149
01:12:41,780 --> 01:12:43,720
And then if you're in the Los Angeles area

2150
01:12:45,160 --> 01:12:46,120
April 24th

2151
01:12:46,120 --> 01:12:47,240
will be the next

2152
01:12:47,240 --> 01:12:49,740
edition of Bugmane's Manifesto.

2153
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:50,940
Manifesto 3.

2154
01:12:51,260 --> 01:12:51,560
Oh I didn't

2155
01:12:51,560 --> 01:12:52,460
this is breaking news to me.

2156
01:12:52,460 --> 01:12:53,720
This has not been announced.

2157
01:12:53,720 --> 01:12:55,800
This is being announced here for the first time.

2158
01:12:55,800 --> 01:12:56,280
PTR exclusive.

2159
01:12:57,540 --> 01:12:59,740
That is at the Lyric Hyperion Theater

2160
01:12:59,740 --> 01:13:00,800
in Los Angeles.

2161
01:13:03,620 --> 01:13:03,800
And

2162
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:05,960
you know I want to say it's at

2163
01:13:05,960 --> 01:13:07,640
like 9 or 10 o'clock

2164
01:13:07,640 --> 01:13:09,860
but I don't really know the time exactly.

2165
01:13:10,160 --> 01:13:12,180
But just search for the Lyric Hyperion

2166
01:13:12,180 --> 01:13:13,700
Theater and it should be up.

2167
01:13:14,460 --> 01:13:15,760
It's a great time.

2168
01:13:16,240 --> 01:13:17,740
I've been to both Manifestos.

2169
01:13:17,820 --> 01:13:19,840
They've both been very educational and great

2170
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:21,600
for just grounding, centering,

2171
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:23,600
and comedic extravaganza.

2172
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:25,580
Yeah, highly recommended.

2173
01:13:25,680 --> 01:13:26,420
Not to be missed.

2174
01:13:26,660 --> 01:13:27,600
I do perform

2175
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:29,200
in them as well myself.

2176
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:29,920
It's a rare

2177
01:13:30,500 --> 01:13:32,060
occasion to see me perform.

2178
01:13:32,520 --> 01:13:33,720
And I have a feeling if you

2179
01:13:33,720 --> 01:13:35,780
want to see me in this Vision Pro headset

2180
01:13:35,780 --> 01:13:37,600
I may be wearing it

2181
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:38,380
during the show.

2182
01:13:38,700 --> 01:13:39,480
I'd believe it.

2183
01:13:39,720 --> 01:13:40,560
Okay, okay.

2184
01:13:40,600 --> 01:13:41,900
So look for the guy in the Vision Pro

2185
01:13:41,900 --> 01:13:43,480
unless everyone is wearing them.

2186
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:45,920
But you know it's well over a month from now

2187
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:47,660
so it could be have taken

2188
01:13:47,660 --> 01:13:49,220
over the world by storm by then.

2189
01:13:49,220 --> 01:13:50,920
Based off of this appearance.

2190
01:13:51,940 --> 01:13:54,080
Can you make that look more like

2191
01:13:54,080 --> 01:13:55,260
Cyclops' visor?

2192
01:13:56,360 --> 01:13:57,160
Say more.

2193
01:13:57,740 --> 01:13:59,060
You know what I'm talking about Cyclops?

2194
01:13:59,580 --> 01:14:01,180
He has a gold visor with a red strip.

2195
01:14:01,180 --> 01:14:02,960
He has a gold visor with a red strip in there.

2196
01:14:03,660 --> 01:14:04,520
It's like energy beams.

2197
01:14:04,520 --> 01:14:05,320
You know what I'm talking about.

2198
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:06,880
But how would this

2199
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:09,640
are you asking if I could

2200
01:14:09,640 --> 01:14:09,940
make the…

2201
01:14:09,940 --> 01:14:11,760
what are you asking me to do?

2202
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:13,220
Could your eyes go away

2203
01:14:13,220 --> 01:14:15,120
and it could be sort of that red strip?

2204
01:14:15,500 --> 01:14:15,920
Sort of.

2205
01:14:15,940 --> 01:14:17,200
So if I go into an immersive

2206
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:18,060
experience.

2207
01:14:18,220 --> 01:14:18,420
Yeah.

2208
01:14:19,160 --> 01:14:20,160
Let me pull one up.

2209
01:14:20,200 --> 01:14:21,240
Because you could mod the outside

2210
01:14:21,240 --> 01:14:23,540
to be yellow like Cyclops.

2211
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:24,500
You know like you could just paint it.

2212
01:14:24,520 --> 01:14:25,220
So when I go to an immersive

2213
01:14:25,220 --> 01:14:27,340
experience you guys don't see my eyes anymore.

2214
01:14:27,480 --> 01:14:28,140
No, okay.

2215
01:14:27,480 --> 01:14:29,360
That's…

2216
01:14:28,420 --> 01:14:29,360
That looks like the

2217
01:14:29,360 --> 01:14:31,400
punch-drunk love psychedelic scene break.

2218
01:14:31,780 --> 01:14:32,480
Speaking of John Bryan.

2219
01:14:32,780 --> 01:14:33,080
And so

2220
01:14:33,080 --> 01:14:35,060
I could say because I am a developer right now

2221
01:14:35,060 --> 01:14:37,200
they don't give me access to really

2222
01:14:37,200 --> 01:14:39,100
control what's on this screen.

2223
01:14:39,100 --> 01:14:41,500
But I have a feeling that sort of thing will open

2224
01:14:41,500 --> 01:14:42,340
up eventually.

2225
01:14:42,380 --> 01:14:42,860
Because you can get

2226
01:14:42,860 --> 01:14:45,260
I'm sure somebody's going to make the outside yellow

2227
01:14:45,260 --> 01:14:46,460
and then put a red strip there.

2228
01:14:46,460 --> 01:14:47,360
Well the issue is there's

2229
01:14:48,160 --> 01:14:49,300
cameras all throughout.

2230
01:14:49,540 --> 01:14:49,840
Right.

2231
01:14:49,900 --> 01:14:50,800
It's not going to be perfect.

2232
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:53,480
And so it's limited in what you could do to

2233
01:14:53,480 --> 01:14:54,820
cover things up.

2234
01:14:54,920 --> 01:14:55,180
Right.

2235
01:14:55,200 --> 01:14:56,180
But I'm just saying the outside…

2236
01:14:56,180 --> 01:14:57,120
the stuff around here.

2237
01:14:57,780 --> 01:14:58,920
But there's cameras all around.

2238
01:14:59,140 --> 01:15:00,260
There are sensors.

2239
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:01,340
This thing's covered in sensors.

2240
01:15:01,340 --> 01:15:02,500
You could paint it yellow I bet.

2241
01:15:03,580 --> 01:15:04,320
Agree to disagree.

2242
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:05,280
I'm not going to do it because

2243
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:06,660
I think I'll mess with the camera.

2244
01:15:06,820 --> 01:15:08,060
You're not doing it to mine.

2245
01:15:08,080 --> 01:15:09,460
You have to be a confident painter

2246
01:15:09,460 --> 01:15:10,360
I think for that.

2247
01:15:10,360 --> 01:15:11,260
Well somebody do that

2248
01:15:11,260 --> 01:15:12,100
out there in the audience.

2249
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:13,640
Mod your

2250
01:15:13,640 --> 01:15:13,640
headset.

2251
01:15:13,900 --> 01:15:15,700
I don't think that's so crazy.

2252
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:17,700
Can you make it just display the lyrics of

2253
01:15:17,700 --> 01:15:18,980
Bruce Springsteen's Jungle Land.

2254
01:15:19,460 --> 01:15:21,820
Look that's why I've got the developer strap

2255
01:15:21,820 --> 01:15:23,720
because I want to get Jungle Land on there.

2256
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:24,740
Okay good.

2257
01:15:25,140 --> 01:15:26,560
You taught yourself a Jungle Land pass.

2258
01:15:26,940 --> 01:15:29,660
Alright well Van we're going to let you go and we're going to do a quick

2259
01:15:29,660 --> 01:15:32,000
end of it check in with the Sector Keeper.

2260
01:15:32,060 --> 01:15:33,800
Thank you Van and let's see if we can

2261
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:34,360
get him in here.

2262
01:15:34,580 --> 01:15:35,760
Alright say hi to the Keeper for me.

2263
01:15:36,020 --> 01:15:36,140
We will.

2264
01:15:36,820 --> 01:15:36,820
Thanks.

2265
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:37,760
Yeah have a good trip.

2266
01:15:38,080 --> 01:15:38,160
Okay.

2267
01:15:38,160 --> 01:15:38,760
Sector Keeper.

2268
01:15:39,080 --> 01:15:39,380
Boys

2269
01:15:39,380 --> 01:15:40,520
boys you did it.

2270
01:15:40,520 --> 01:15:41,140
You did it.

2271
01:15:41,140 --> 01:15:41,620
Thank you.

2272
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:42,280
Thank you.

2273
01:15:42,280 --> 01:15:42,900
It was fun.

2274
01:15:42,940 --> 01:15:43,540
We like this one.

2275
01:15:43,540 --> 01:15:44,480
This one was pretty fun.

2276
01:15:44,600 --> 01:15:45,200
We like this one.

2277
01:15:45,580 --> 01:15:46,900
No one got sick huh?

2278
01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:47,300
No.

2279
01:15:47,560 --> 01:15:48,120
No.

2280
01:15:49,220 --> 01:15:50,180
That's great boys.

2281
01:15:50,440 --> 01:15:52,080
You covered Pat O'Brien's

2282
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:53,980
Bob Marley a tribute to freedom.

2283
01:15:54,100 --> 01:15:55,360
Yeah we tributed freedom already.

2284
01:15:55,360 --> 01:15:57,540
And of course City Walk's rising star

2285
01:15:57,540 --> 01:15:59,380
the live band karaoke bar.

2286
01:15:59,420 --> 01:15:59,980
You can't

2287
01:15:59,980 --> 01:16:01,340
forget it if you've been there.

2288
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:02,600
It's the best.

2289
01:16:03,240 --> 01:16:03,240
Wow.

2290
01:16:04,420 --> 01:16:04,420
Yeah.

2291
01:16:07,260 --> 01:16:07,680
Wait wait.

2292
01:16:07,780 --> 01:16:08,140
Boys.

2293
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:09,640
You know this was

2294
01:16:09,640 --> 01:16:11,680
the same day about

2295
01:16:11,680 --> 01:16:13,120
as the Margaritaville.

2296
01:16:13,200 --> 01:16:13,600
Yeah I remember

2297
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:14,980
all the Margaritaville.

2298
01:16:16,260 --> 01:16:17,920
We like hit a wall there

2299
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:18,520
basically.

2300
01:16:18,520 --> 01:16:19,320
You didn't feel great.

2301
01:16:20,220 --> 01:16:21,760
We all just kind of went back to

2302
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:22,140
the hotel.

2303
01:16:23,220 --> 01:16:23,580
Well Mike you

2304
01:16:23,580 --> 01:16:25,840
did the Velocicoaster after eating

2305
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:27,320
two hamburger patties.

2306
01:16:27,620 --> 01:16:29,040
Most of the patties I ate.

2307
01:16:29,740 --> 01:16:29,780
Yeah.

2308
01:16:29,780 --> 01:16:31,480
Mike was in a different place I guess.

2309
01:16:31,700 --> 01:16:33,720
Yeah yeah but we just like we got like a

2310
01:16:33,720 --> 01:16:35,700
tip that it like because we were going to

2311
01:16:35,700 --> 01:16:37,680
do this and we were going to sing but when we heard it's like really

2312
01:16:37,680 --> 01:16:38,740
hard to get up there.

2313
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:39,600
Yeah that's one thing.

2314
01:16:39,780 --> 01:16:41,640
Okay so yeah of course singing with a live band

2315
01:16:41,640 --> 01:16:43,600
would be cool but then we heard like you got to wait all night.

2316
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:45,440
It's like a random order.

2317
01:16:45,620 --> 01:16:46,720
It's just like a hassle.

2318
01:16:47,540 --> 01:16:47,660
We didn't

2319
01:16:48,580 --> 01:16:49,480
do it okay.

2320
01:16:49,660 --> 01:16:50,120
I'm sorry.

2321
01:16:50,560 --> 01:16:51,980
You didn't do

2322
01:16:51,980 --> 01:16:52,620
City Walk's rise.

2323
01:16:52,680 --> 01:16:53,820
No if somebody told us

2324
01:16:53,820 --> 01:16:55,600
it would be impossible for us to sing

2325
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:56,000
okay.

2326
01:16:56,020 --> 01:16:57,940
Don't you realize what you've done

2327
01:16:57,940 --> 01:16:58,140
boys.

2328
01:16:58,140 --> 01:16:59,760
Who cares what do you mean what have we done.

2329
01:17:00,040 --> 01:17:00,500
We haven't done anything.

2330
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:01,760
It doesn't

2331
01:17:01,760 --> 01:17:02,120
matter.

2332
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:03,840
You created a new rift.

2333
01:17:04,060 --> 01:17:04,460
No.

2334
01:17:05,180 --> 01:17:05,180
What?

2335
01:17:05,680 --> 01:17:06,160
What?

2336
01:17:06,760 --> 01:17:08,600
What's happening to this room you guys?

2337
01:17:08,920 --> 01:17:09,700
Just because we didn't sing

2338
01:17:09,700 --> 01:17:12,040
Pour Some Sugar On Me in a live band karaoke.

2339
01:17:12,380 --> 01:17:13,740
Nobody said don't stop believing.

2340
01:17:13,960 --> 01:17:16,220
You didn't sing Sweet Caroline Boys.

2341
01:17:16,220 --> 01:17:17,300
Oh come on.

2342
01:17:17,320 --> 01:17:19,200
You didn't sing Cracklin' Rosie.

2343
01:17:19,680 --> 01:17:21,280
There's a whole I can see the rifts.

2344
01:17:21,500 --> 01:17:22,020
There's some tears.

2345
01:17:22,440 --> 01:17:23,080
There's a lot of

2346
01:17:24,080 --> 01:17:25,040
indecipherable like

2347
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:26,660
colors and goo.

2348
01:17:26,660 --> 01:17:27,460
Jason you

2349
01:17:27,460 --> 01:17:29,420
promised me you said you were going to do

2350
01:17:29,420 --> 01:17:30,420
Gong Gong Style.

2351
01:17:31,340 --> 01:17:33,260
I crashed down in bed.

2352
01:17:33,260 --> 01:17:35,040
He didn't even do the little dance.

2353
01:17:35,040 --> 01:17:35,360
He didn't

2354
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:36,200
dance like a horse.

2355
01:17:36,240 --> 01:17:37,280
But who cares why

2356
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:38,560
this will be happening.

2357
01:17:38,760 --> 01:17:39,520
This is what you've

2358
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:39,620
done.

2359
01:17:39,780 --> 01:17:40,940
You've created a new rift.

2360
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:41,600
Everything's

2361
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:42,540
being pulled apart.

2362
01:17:42,660 --> 01:17:43,420
I can see

2363
01:17:43,420 --> 01:17:43,920
it now.

2364
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:44,900
You can too.

2365
01:17:45,300 --> 01:17:47,080
You're all being pulled into different

2366
01:17:47,080 --> 01:17:47,900
Maltiper's.

2367
01:17:47,900 --> 01:17:48,240
Oh my god.

2368
01:17:48,360 --> 01:17:49,460
The room is swirling

2369
01:17:49,460 --> 01:17:49,700
around.

2370
01:17:49,880 --> 01:17:50,820
This looks horrible.

2371
01:17:51,180 --> 01:17:53,500
This looks like one of those shitty Marvel CGI

2372
01:17:53,500 --> 01:17:54,200
goop things.

2373
01:17:54,420 --> 01:17:54,840
It's awful.

2374
01:17:55,120 --> 01:17:57,040
This looks worse than the Flash.

2375
01:17:57,240 --> 01:17:57,980
It's really dark.

2376
01:17:58,360 --> 01:17:59,300
Well there's some okay

2377
01:17:59,300 --> 01:18:01,280
scenes in the Flash though visually I think.

2378
01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:02,600
You're still arguing that.

2379
01:18:02,660 --> 01:18:03,320
The effects

2380
01:18:03,320 --> 01:18:04,420
you can't think were good.

2381
01:18:04,460 --> 01:18:05,440
The rift I'm being pulled

2382
01:18:05,440 --> 01:18:07,120
into actually the effect looks okay.

2383
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:09,400
That was a world where they finished it all

2384
01:18:09,400 --> 01:18:09,620
right.

2385
01:18:09,720 --> 01:18:11,520
Don't you see you're being split apart

2386
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:12,120
from each other.

2387
01:18:12,140 --> 01:18:13,600
This isn't the time to have

2388
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:15,880
quick quibbles about the Flash.

2389
01:18:16,100 --> 01:18:16,560
What do you mean?

2390
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:17,360
I can

2391
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:19,340
barely see Mike and Jason anymore.

2392
01:18:19,440 --> 01:18:21,240
Wait so we're going somewhere

2393
01:18:21,240 --> 01:18:21,560
else.

2394
01:18:21,580 --> 01:18:23,120
We're not going to be with each other.

2395
01:18:23,560 --> 01:18:25,780
Completely different Maltiverses.

2396
01:18:26,060 --> 01:18:26,440
What?

2397
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:27,260
Do I at least

2398
01:18:27,260 --> 01:18:28,660
end up with Scampi?

2399
01:18:29,440 --> 01:18:30,320
No then

2400
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:32,420
maybe in this world.

2401
01:18:32,540 --> 01:18:32,840
I don't

2402
01:18:32,840 --> 01:18:33,040
know.

2403
01:18:33,080 --> 01:18:34,900
Have you fucked Scampi in this world?

2404
01:18:35,400 --> 01:18:36,200
I don't know.

2405
01:18:36,400 --> 01:18:36,720
He has.

2406
01:18:36,720 --> 01:18:38,340
You can see the smile on his face.

2407
01:18:38,340 --> 01:18:38,820
Even from

2408
01:18:38,820 --> 01:18:39,540
back here I can see it.

2409
01:18:39,540 --> 01:18:40,780
This isn't the time to talk

2410
01:18:40,780 --> 01:18:40,800
about fucking Scampi.

2411
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:42,840
It was just one special night.

2412
01:18:42,940 --> 01:18:43,660
What do you want?

2413
01:18:43,780 --> 01:18:45,040
Harry admitted it

2414
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:46,280
right before we die.

2415
01:18:46,380 --> 01:18:46,660
We knew

2416
01:18:46,660 --> 01:18:47,640
we'd get it out of him.

2417
01:18:48,380 --> 01:18:48,520
Focus boys.

2418
01:18:48,520 --> 01:18:48,520
Wait

2419
01:18:48,520 --> 01:18:50,720
can I get Mike to admit that he never thought

2420
01:18:50,720 --> 01:18:52,180
maybe Aladar was cute?

2421
01:18:52,380 --> 01:18:52,860
No.

2422
01:18:53,100 --> 01:18:54,800
I'm a truthful man.

2423
01:18:55,900 --> 01:18:56,560
Listen listen.

2424
01:18:56,560 --> 01:18:58,260
There's one way to save this.

2425
01:18:58,280 --> 01:19:00,460
There's only one way to stitch up the rift.

2426
01:19:00,460 --> 01:19:02,660
You'll have to create new Jump Points

2427
01:19:02,660 --> 01:19:03,140
boys.

2428
01:19:03,140 --> 01:19:03,380
What?

2429
01:19:03,380 --> 01:19:03,680
How?

2430
01:19:03,860 --> 01:19:04,720
Record separate

2431
01:19:04,720 --> 01:19:06,700
podcasts about malls next to

2432
01:19:06,700 --> 01:19:07,220
theme parks.

2433
01:19:07,680 --> 01:19:08,640
Go on your own.

2434
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:10,060
Completely autonomously.

2435
01:19:10,360 --> 01:19:10,640
Your

2436
01:19:10,640 --> 01:19:11,640
own podcasts.

2437
01:19:12,020 --> 01:19:12,640
And hope

2438
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:14,880
that I'll be back at some

2439
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:15,300
point.

2440
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:16,300
Wait wait wait.

2441
01:19:16,460 --> 01:19:18,420
The only way to reunite is for us to

2442
01:19:18,420 --> 01:19:20,580
record separate different podcasts

2443
01:19:20,580 --> 01:19:22,320
from our parts of the Maltiverse?

2444
01:19:22,840 --> 01:19:24,620
I'm turning to dust

2445
01:19:24,620 --> 01:19:27,280
like Peter Parker with Iron Man.

2446
01:19:27,780 --> 01:19:28,320
Oh no.

2447
01:19:29,040 --> 01:19:30,740
That CGI effect looks pretty good

2448
01:19:30,740 --> 01:19:32,400
I thought when I saw it in IMAX.

2449
01:19:32,660 --> 01:19:34,540
That one's a little better than the rest of it.

2450
01:19:34,720 --> 01:19:36,020
The world we're in is pretty

2451
01:19:36,020 --> 01:19:37,980
I just can't even tell what's happening.

2452
01:19:38,080 --> 01:19:38,320
It seems

2453
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:40,200
kind of off the shelf but oh god.

2454
01:19:40,480 --> 01:19:41,340
We're stretching.

2455
01:19:41,720 --> 01:19:43,000
We're pulling apart.

2456
01:19:43,180 --> 01:19:44,340
Pulling apart.

2457
01:19:45,320 --> 01:19:45,880
Good luck.

2458
01:19:47,240 --> 01:19:47,580
Jason.

2459
01:19:48,580 --> 01:19:50,740
Jason's calling his own

2460
01:19:50,740 --> 01:19:50,740
name.

2461
01:19:50,740 --> 01:19:52,680
Jason yelled his own name.

2462
01:19:52,680 --> 01:19:53,820
Jason.

2463
01:20:00,480 --> 01:20:00,920
Dog.

2464
01:20:01,440 --> 01:20:02,820
