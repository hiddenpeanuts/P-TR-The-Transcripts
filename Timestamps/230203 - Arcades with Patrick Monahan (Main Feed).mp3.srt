1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:12,440
Warning, the following podcast may contain ruthless pinball racketeering, bat wielding

4
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:16,280
leather haters, and an evil horny energy.

5
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:22,400
Patrick Monahan joins us as we share formative memories of our favorite arcades on Podcast

6
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:45,560
the Ride.

7
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:50,280
Welcome to Podcast the Ride, the podcast that withdraws all their Patreon money straight

8
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,280
to tokens.

9
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,040
I'm Scott Gardner, joined by Mike Carlson.

10
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:57,000
I am here, yes, tokens.

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,640
Tokens is something that was, I was obsessed with having tokens.

12
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:06,360
And when you'd accidentally take a token home from wherever you were in an arcade, it would

13
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:10,080
feel like you took like a, I don't know, like something wrong, you did something wrong,

14
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,080
you stole.

15
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:14,180
Oh, you've, I didn't know if you were gonna say that that's neat that that's a collectible

16
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:15,180
from whatever local arcade.

17
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:16,180
It is now.

18
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:17,180
Uh huh, sure.

19
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:20,360
But I guess immediately you made me think of like being guilty and being scared.

20
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:23,640
You've talked before about how you were afraid of prison as a child.

21
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,880
Oh yeah, yeah, for any minor infraction.

22
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:30,480
And I felt like if I had a token at home, it meant Chuck E. Cheese himself was coming

23
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,520
to get me.

24
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:36,540
You smuggled tokens across state lines or county lines, some line, any line, the line

25
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:38,320
of where the store ends.

26
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,320
Yeah, exactly.

27
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,320
That's not okay.

28
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,200
This is currency within this nightclub, this pizza time theater only.

29
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,200
You're right.

30
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,400
Jason Sheridan, feelings about tokens?

31
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,760
Quite the polar opposite of Mike.

32
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,840
I love taking tokens home because it meant one or two things.

33
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:59,360
I had a little souvenir from a fun time or it was the promise of like, we'll be back.

34
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,280
I get to come back and cash these in.

35
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,520
We're going to have to.

36
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,200
It would be a financial loss.

37
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,760
It would be a financial loss.

38
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,920
It's the reverse of like leaving something at a date's house.

39
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,840
So you have to get that second date.

40
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,840
Oh yeah.

41
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,840
Yeah.

42
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,040
I, if my family was like, oh, what do we do this week?

43
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,040
What are we doing?

44
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,920
I was like, well, we got a 250 in tokens.

45
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,600
250?

46
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,200
You would bring home a lot of tokens.

47
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,200
Yeah, that's a heavy pocket.

48
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,960
Well, usually when people would tap out every now and then, you'd end up with like, oh,

49
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,960
we got too much.

50
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,960
I accidentally put a five.

51
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:33,200
I feel like I was like, when I was like, oh, you have 15 minutes left, I would just be

52
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:38,320
like just feeding tokens into every machine to get like, to get rid of them.

53
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:41,840
Because again, you don't want to be shaken down at the state line.

54
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,840
Right.

55
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,840
Yeah.

56
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,840
Yeah.

57
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,840
I don't want to go to prison.

58
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,520
We'll see if our guest wants to go to prison.

59
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:49,920
Or not.

60
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,360
What a segue.

61
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,480
Hey, look, we're first of all, wait, first things first.

62
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,920
We're back on video here.

63
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,880
We haven't been in video for a little bit.

64
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:01,000
And this is on the forever dog YouTube channel if you want to watch along.

65
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,840
And this will also help us with a cleaner, nice, more professional connection with our

66
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,560
guest who's joining us from New York City.

67
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,600
He's a writer and comedian from the podcast.

68
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,920
What a time to be alive.

69
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,240
Patrick Monahan.

70
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,240
Hello, Patrick.

71
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,080
Hello.

72
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,480
You asked if I want to go to jail.

73
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,040
I would say I prison rather.

74
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,120
I'm always in a prison of my own making.

75
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,480
That is my general state of being.

76
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,920
What a thing for me to say.

77
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,680
I've just I've agitated you right at the top here.

78
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,240
Well, apologies for that.

79
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,840
I hope we can have a fun time.

80
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,840
Yeah, I know.

81
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:40,840
Tokens, you know, I think I was in between, you know, the different polls we've set up

82
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,280
here, I would take like maybe two home.

83
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:46,880
You know, I'm not going to like not spend six or seven.

84
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,000
But, you know, I like the idea of having a little souvenir.

85
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:54,000
And I don't know, it's not legal tender, but if it just felt like a yeah.

86
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,080
And then being able to kind of cash in, maybe play a little play one round of the Simpsons

87
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,320
game with money that you came, you know, you came with without having to ask mom.

88
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,960
You know, that was that was useful, I think.

89
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,560
Yeah, that makes sense.

90
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:12,120
I feel like also I was maybe this is something everyone shares, but I also was just like

91
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:16,560
I felt it was dirty and maybe it was because my mom told me like you wash your hands when

92
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,640
you touch coins.

93
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:23,560
So there was something extra like gross about it to me to have like coins from the Chuck

94
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:23,640
E.

95
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:27,320
Cheese. Not that I was some smart kid who knew, oh, this is a disease factory.

96
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,840
But I also was just like, oh, I don't want to touch.

97
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,000
I don't want to touch it when I'm outside of Chuck E.

98
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,080
Cheese's boundaries.

99
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,760
Oh, sure. You want these off of you.

100
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:37,800
You want these flying into machines as quickly as you can.

101
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:38,320
Yes.

102
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,240
To pass the germs.

103
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:39,760
Yeah.

104
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:40,360
Uh huh.

105
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:45,480
Do we think tokens from a given arcade are more or less disgusting than just regular

106
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,480
U.S. change?

107
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,720
What do we less?

108
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:54,360
I bet it's less less because it's mostly just kids using them for games versus who knows

109
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,240
adults are using pennies for.

110
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:58,880
We've seen the line.

111
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,720
We've seen the UCB sketch.

112
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,640
Yeah, we've all been taught it.

113
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:05,200
You have to write in classes as pennies.

114
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:05,880
Yes.

115
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:09,240
So we know that you're taking as pennies literally.

116
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:12,440
A lot of people are using it as an intimidation move.

117
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:12,800
Right.

118
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,440
Uh huh.

119
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,880
Or just as like a fun.

120
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,320
They don't even.

121
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,560
There might be people who don't even know the sketch who are putting pennies up their

122
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:18,920
ass.

123
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:18,960
Right.

124
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,520
There might be some people who don't know the sketch from 25 years ago.

125
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,200
There may be some comedy show.

126
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,440
Don't know all the sketches.

127
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:26,760
Yeah.

128
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,800
UCB show.

129
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:33,200
So I think, yeah, it's just like candies on the tokens and like syrup sticky like like,

130
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:39,680
you know, pancake syrup like stuff like that entire pancakes like having syrupy

131
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,520
fingers.

132
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,040
I think kids always have maple syrup on their fingers.

133
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,240
At Chuck E Cheese.

134
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,760
Sir, capital of kids.

135
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:51,080
Well, they do say in the for breakfast Chuck E Cheese would have like little sticks like

136
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:51,760
French toast sticks.

137
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,960
What are you talking about?

138
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,480
That's 100% true.

139
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,240
My sister had a birthday there.

140
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,640
And if you got there at 11 a.m., they would give you French toast sticks instead of pizza.

141
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,680
Like Saturday mornings.

142
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,240
Exactly.

143
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,960
OK, here's what I think.

144
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,720
I think that both sides of that voice raising was wrong.

145
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,720
I think that you might got very agitated.

146
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:14,400
But Jason, how could you find that so unbelievable?

147
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:18,400
That's not so preposterous that there would be a takeaway breakfast.

148
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,480
It's not.

149
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,280
I just never thought about.

150
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:26,960
I know I've been to morning Chuck E Cheese, but I have no memory of breakfast like that.

151
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,480
You had an omelet at Chuck E Cheese in the morning.

152
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:30,960
I did.

153
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,600
I had eggs Benedict.

154
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:37,640
I had to send it back because the hollandaise was not correct.

155
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:37,960
Right.

156
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:38,200
Right.

157
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,960
You had Scrapple.

158
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,880
I had I'm in California.

159
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:45,560
We had a California omelet at our Chuck E Cheese with our precious avocado.

160
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,760
You had your avocado and spinach.

161
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,360
We were just it was the Scrapple plate would come out.

162
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,920
The pork roll plate would come out.

163
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:54,920
You know, Pedro was your favorite breakfast.

164
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,520
Have you ever had breakfast at Chuck E Cheese?

165
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,240
I have I will say I've never actually been to a Chuck E Cheese.

166
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,120
There were no cheese near me growing up or near enough.

167
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,680
So sorry. No kidding.

168
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,440
Yeah. Wow.

169
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,800
But I had I this is a recent subject of an episode,

170
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,480
but we did have Discovery Zone for as long as that.

171
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:17,120
Oh, yes. We just covered on the second gate on our Patreon.

172
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,920
Oh, yeah. Right. Which of what you mentioned to us.

173
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,280
OK, so that was and where did you grow up also?

174
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,360
Because that'll that'll factor in.

175
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,200
Yeah. Fairfield County, Connecticut.

176
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:28,840
OK, OK. Oh, so that is the location of just full disclosure.

177
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:29,680
And we won't get into it yet.

178
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,400
We're all going to talk about basically today.

179
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:35,600
We're talking about arcades that we're very fond of, that were formative for us.

180
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,600
We had important experiences.

181
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:42,440
And this was sort of inspired by by Patrick's childhood arcade,

182
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,240
which you sent me some stuff about.

183
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:49,280
And I thought I looked it up and I thought this is an unusual amount

184
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,720
of information for one Connecticut arcade.

185
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:55,440
This was written about in the newspaper a strange amount of times

186
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,600
as a tease for what we're going to we're going to get into.

187
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,920
But that's kind of what we're so.

188
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:05,160
So that particular arcade we'll talk about.

189
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:08,240
But that was a go to Discovery Zone was a go to

190
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,920
any anything else you want to shout out?

191
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,720
Yeah.

192
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:17,360
The the there in the Trumbull Mall, which I think is I think is called Westfield

193
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,920
Trumbull or something now, I don't know, whatever.

194
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:23,400
But but it's they had an FYE, the four year entertainment store.

195
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:27,080
But half of it was like a big arcade, basically.

196
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:31,520
So that was that was the arcade because it was like that was the arcade at the mall.

197
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,160
When like, you know, you know, when you're like in middle school,

198
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:36,480
you just get dropped off at the mall and just kind of do whatever people do at the mall.

199
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,280
That's where we go spend our time.

200
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,640
Discovery Zone, the only thing I remember other than the ball pit

201
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,240
is that Big Bertha game.

202
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,200
Do you guys remember that?

203
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,040
Oh, absolutely. Yeah.

204
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,920
I felt like I was kind of good at Big Bertha.

205
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,840
Yeah, that's skee ball and Big Bertha.

206
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:54,360
That was the extent of the arcade part of Discovery Zone that I remember.

207
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,880
It's a very strangely particular memory now that I think about it.

208
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:02,320
But we talked about how their arcade component was kind of diminished

209
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,120
because if you haven't heard this on our Patreon, Discovery Zone

210
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:09,280
was more of a run around, climb ball pit kind of place.

211
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:13,720
We stress that we stress the the physical activity for the kids

212
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,840
because we don't want kids being lazy with TVs.

213
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:20,800
That's why we only have 10 arcade games instead of 24.

214
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,160
Like they still did it.

215
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,520
So it was a weird posturing for them to have.

216
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:29,480
But I know now what kind of kid were you, Patrick?

217
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:33,000
Did you were you more of a physical run around kid?

218
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Or were you just like, take me straight to the arcade stuff?

219
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:36,800
God, no, no.

220
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,840
I mean, I think I like the ball pit conceptually.

221
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:42,800
Like, I think that was like something that I couldn't believe existed in real life.

222
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:47,240
But at the same time, I wasn't like aching to do any kind of physical activity.

223
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,560
I was a video game and arcade type kid.

224
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:53,160
So not really an ideal place for me, given the focus.

225
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,040
So for a lot of kids.

226
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,040
Yeah, I think. Yeah.

227
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:00,480
I should say big, big Bertha probably not around anymore, right?

228
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,680
I mean, they're not making new big Bertha machines.

229
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,560
That's sort of a mess.

230
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,600
Oh, interesting. Yeah, probably not.

231
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,200
Probably a sort of cancel for those who don't.

232
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:12,320
For those who don't know, it's a it's a thing where it's an arcade.

233
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,520
Were you a game where you throw?

234
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,840
I think they were like those balls that were like in the ball pit.

235
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:22,400
They were like those hollow kind of balls into the mouth of a large woman.

236
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,520
And she had a huge, you know, like opening and closing mouth.

237
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,760
So you had to time it.

238
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:31,160
And I think the points were weight that was being gained by Bertha,

239
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,640
I believe was really that was the right.

240
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,920
I forgot that she inflated.

241
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,880
Yeah. And it does say feed Big Bertha that you're given the express

242
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,560
instruction and you kind of you got a uvula to hit.

243
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:49,480
Oh, yeah. That's dangling there, which I don't know.

244
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,840
I was how they knew it went in, right?

245
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,800
You had to hit the uvula otherwise, I guess you wouldn't get the point.

246
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:57,280
This feels like this could be become some sort of part of the culture war

247
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,600
now that we've put it out there.

248
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,200
Like you could see like Ben Shapiro saying he's going to start his own line

249
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,280
of arcade games and we're going to not cancel the Big Bertha game.

250
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:07,800
And a bunch of senators will start playing the Big Bertha game in

251
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,600
like the capital.

252
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,360
Fox News will get mad at like and they're removing the Big Bertha.

253
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,400
Like they got mad because of the M&M's campaign.

254
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:20,640
Recently, they just got mad at the A&W Root Beer

255
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:24,240
Bear, post parroting the M&M's campaign.

256
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,680
Really? Yeah.

257
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,760
What's the name of that mascot again?

258
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,880
I forget. It's a bear.

259
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,800
But the joke was that like our bears going to wear pants now.

260
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:35,600
Oh, OK. And there was a segment on Fox Business where it's like unbelievable.

261
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:39,120
And they're making the A&W Root Beer Bear wear pants now.

262
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,640
Yeah. Wearing pants is, of course, woke, as we all know,

263
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,200
and something that should be shunned.

264
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,240
That's true. Yeah.

265
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,840
Oh, his name is in the last.

266
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,920
When did women start wearing pants?

267
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,040
It's been in the last like two years, right?

268
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,800
I think until this this woke, crazy time.

269
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:56,440
That's right. Never as a woman worn pants.

270
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,040
Things are getting out of control.

271
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,920
Rudy. His name is Rudy.

272
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,160
Rudy. R-O-O-T-Y.

273
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:06,080
And we will do an episode about him that will be at least 90 minutes.

274
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,680
Not this year, necessarily, but at a certain point.

275
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,960
OK. Yeah.

276
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,760
Rudy. Rudy.

277
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,240
Since we bring up a mascot,

278
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,120
Patrick, on on your show, What a Time to Be Alive,

279
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:22,440
you talked about recently, I think, on a Patreon episode of your show,

280
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,800
a mascot that I have seen, but never fully processed.

281
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,920
And I'm talking about Duncan Cuppy.

282
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:34,360
And Jordan, if we could bring up that video I sent.

283
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:43,720
So that's just a clip, a quick clip of

284
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:49,760
titled Cuppy Does the Hashtag D Dance for Dark Roast at NASDAQ.

285
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,760
That is Cuppy at the NASDAQ.

286
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,000
Can you describe a cuppy also?

287
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,080
It's a bit. This is a Dunkin Donuts. Yeah.

288
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,080
You have the Ropomorphic Cup. It's a big cup.

289
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,160
It's a big cup.

290
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:04,760
And I was just poking around to see what cuppy I could find.

291
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:07,760
And I guess eight or nine years ago, they did a campaign

292
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,080
where they were pushing a new dark roast.

293
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,520
And so there's lots of videos,

294
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:16,240
Cuppy dancing at Dunkin Donuts franchises here, Dunkin,

295
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:21,440
Dunkin, dancing at the NASDAQ exchange.

296
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,320
And he's having a great time.

297
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,400
Do you know what's his full name again?

298
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:30,880
I've seen it both as Cuppy and as Dunkin Cuppy.

299
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,280
So Cuppy might be his last name.

300
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:36,040
Yeah, I've also seen like feminine Cuppy.

301
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,440
So I think there's an iced coffee cuppy and a hot coffee.

302
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,200
Jeez, we have to have feminine cuppy, don't we?

303
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,760
We just, oh, it all has to be.

304
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,640
Is the lady the iced coffee?

305
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,920
I think so.

306
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,040
I think that's what I encountered.

307
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,800
Yeah, we didn't get into that level of the lore.

308
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,960
I have met only the iced cuppy.

309
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,360
Oh, you met iced cuppy?

310
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,400
Oh, wow.

311
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:00,240
Yeah, at a Jimmy Buffett concert this summer.

312
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,880
What? In Massachusetts.

313
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,360
Yeah, no, the cuppy was just there.

314
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,720
It was not part of the thing.

315
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,880
They probably got fine.

316
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,120
I think you've completed the podcast, The Ride Bingo Card already.

317
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:10,800
Yeah.

318
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,320
You said all the key words.

319
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,760
Bob Iger was also there.

320
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,960
And let's see, what else?

321
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,120
Michael Eisner was there.

322
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:24,200
Unfortunately, Green Day.

323
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,160
Green Day came out and played.

324
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,920
I don't know why these are on the card, but they are.

325
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,120
Wait, I'm sorry.

326
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,640
Explain these circumstances, Patrick.

327
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,200
Oh, no, I know.

328
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:38,680
My fiance's family, her dad is a big parrot head and his wife.

329
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:42,000
And so we went with them and she and she's also a fan.

330
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,560
I am. I would call myself a novice.

331
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,720
What is that? What is the gross term?

332
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,440
This call me.

333
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,440
They just call me a virgin the whole time I was there.

334
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,600
Is that what they do?

335
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:53,520
Like a rocky like a rocky horror.

336
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,480
Yeah, like, yeah.

337
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,240
No, maybe they were all just all these old people were just bullying me.

338
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:01,200
No, I think it's like a they call you like a Buffett Virgin or something.

339
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,040
I don't know.

340
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,200
Oh, huh.

341
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,720
And it's just it's just that.

342
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:10,160
I mean, I guess that's look, it works because there's an alcoholic connotation.

343
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,680
So it's like in right.

344
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,040
But it does feel like there could be something a little more.

345
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:16,640
I'm looking it up. Buffett specific. Right.

346
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:19,440
Because you're a you're a baby pelican or something.

347
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:22,640
Right. A baby pelican because you're a parrot head.

348
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:26,880
Now, there are people wearing here that said like Buffett Virgin,

349
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,880
and they had like a shock glass, you know, on a necklace.

350
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,560
You know what I mean? I guess the idea of right.

351
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:36,240
Right. If I look at something Buffett Virgin, I get Sierra's buffet

352
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:39,120
dining in the Virgin River Hotel and Casino first.

353
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,200
Maybe this is just I don't know.

354
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:45,600
We'd have I'd have to go on to the various Facebook groups

355
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,680
of different parrot head fan club that I am part of.

356
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,680
I'm not like in the like on the board or anything.

357
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,840
I just following these groups on Facebook.

358
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:58,160
I'm just thankful that like they didn't like because the thing is like there's a

359
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:01,280
I mean, at these shows, there's a it's the, you know,

360
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,280
boomer or just sub boomer, you know, folks.

361
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:08,280
And there's a lot of kind of like sexual energy that I would prefer not.

362
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,240
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

363
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,240
Yeah, we did. We saw. Oh, yeah. Go ahead.

364
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,960
Oh, yeah. So I'm just thankful that the expression doesn't involve like, you know,

365
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,560
popping one's cherry or something.

366
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,440
No one said that to me.

367
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,720
Well, you're popping a lime traditionally.

368
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:29,360
The the we were all that we went to a Jimmy

369
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,760
Buffett concert at the Hollywood Bowl, which I believe was lacking

370
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:36,600
in the horny energy of an average Jimmy Buffett concert, because then

371
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,640
I went to one in Anaheim right before the pandemic.

372
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:45,360
And boy, was that a boat, a horny boat people concert.

373
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,840
Everyone was drunk.

374
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:50,600
We were getting like yelled at by like 60 year olds in line.

375
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:54,240
Well, the Hollywood Bowl is kind of safe, like sectioned off.

376
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,920
It's a little like that's part of it.

377
00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:00,920
A lot of hoops to jump through to like get get there, get inside and do it.

378
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,600
But like was the Anaheim one at Angel Stadium?

379
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,840
No, no, it was that whatever the is at the Hanna Center, whatever it's called.

380
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:10,360
Oh, OK. But massive parking lot, right?

381
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,360
Yeah. So they got tailgate like the only hotel.

382
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:14,680
And we, of course, went to the Sammy Hagar's

383
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:17,760
Cabo Wabo Cantina at Hollywood and Highland first and then walked up,

384
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,320
which was great, but it was still lacking in that.

385
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,240
I would say evil horny energy that you're talking about.

386
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,920
The like sinister, it's not even good.

387
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:29,720
It's not good.

388
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:32,000
It's it's like the end of hereditary.

389
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,200
Yeah. All the naked people are standing around.

390
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:37,040
You know, it's it's it's yeah. Yeah.

391
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,720
Yeah. I mean, they had like there were a lot of them

392
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:44,240
or we saw at least one where there was like a sheet of, you know,

393
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:48,320
like that, like, I don't know what to call fiberglass, but like clear,

394
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,520
you know, plastic.

395
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,840
And it had two holes cut out.

396
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,560
And it was like, put them on the glass for a shot or something.

397
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,160
Oh, and it's just like, all right.

398
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:01,520
What is the average age of the concert goer that is putting them on the glass?

399
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,800
And I don't want to know.

400
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:06,000
And then we walked by that and it gives us like everyone has RVs and stuff set up.

401
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:10,040
And there was like a group of like a half dozen men between the ages of like,

402
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:14,080
let's say, 40 and I don't know, 50, 60 that were just kind of like

403
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,800
pretending they weren't standing there, waiting to see who would put them

404
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,640
on the glass. But we're clearly just like just far enough away

405
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,560
that they had plausible deniability to see them on the glass.

406
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:27,000
Yeah, it's our friend of the show.

407
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,600
It's malevolent. I think you're right. Yeah.

408
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,960
There's an evilness.

409
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,120
A friend of the show, Anthony Geo, worked at a concert venue in Indiana.

410
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:38,120
And he said, by far the biggest maniac crowd was the Buffett crowd.

411
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:40,280
Worse than any metal show or anything.

412
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:44,680
The Buffett crowd was just it was it was anarchy on the lawn.

413
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:47,120
It's one of those places was like an amphitheater with a big lawn.

414
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,960
Yeah, it was just debauchery.

415
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:53,840
People definitely had to get woken up that like have like kids in college,

416
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:57,120
like to get like kicked out of there, you know, like an hour after the show.

417
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,680
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, that's I went to Billy Joel,

418
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,280
which is probably the Long Island version of this as well.

419
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,800
I garden a few weeks ago and it was the same.

420
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:09,560
It's like, man, these ladies are out of like out of control.

421
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:12,560
It's something I said about like another adult, like this is too much like

422
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,400
Penn Station is just a war zone.

423
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,960
Because these are people that are not used to being told like they can't do

424
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,240
something. You know what I mean?

425
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,560
What do you mean? I can't like sit in the stairs.

426
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:27,200
It's like, well, you know, if something happens, people have to be able to leave

427
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,280
or just, you know, because they want to go get a drink or something.

428
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,840
Oh, OK, whatever. I'm just having fun.

429
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,120
You know, that kind of thing.

430
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:37,000
Just very. Yeah. And that turns hostile very fast.

431
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,360
Anyhow, Buffett is a much sunnier version.

432
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,920
Some of the some of the some of the Billy stuff was getting a little dark.

433
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,800
But people probably come to these things ready to fight.

434
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,600
So it's on their checklist. Oh, yeah.

435
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,960
Tonight. Yeah.

436
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:51,320
Fuck. Hope to have to have all the two

437
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,960
two apps and Buffett to apps for that we're going to do.

438
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,880
Oh, yeah. Lines up with his name.

439
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:57,680
Yeah. Yeah.

440
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,760
The apps is in his name.

441
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:03,280
Mm hmm. Do you want to want to steer back to to some arcade stuff here?

442
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:06,960
Yeah. Sure. You mentioned this FYE, which is very strange

443
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,920
that that was the childhood

444
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:12,600
because it's mostly that's a music store, like a poster store mainly.

445
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:16,200
Yeah, it was. Well, I think it was all all in media.

446
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:20,560
It was the the the yeah, I guess posters were there.

447
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:24,200
Yeah. Yeah. The CDs and those like the tall things.

448
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,920
Remember when they had them in those like rack things

449
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:28,000
that were like twice the height of a CD case?

450
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
It was like that's what I and then, yeah, right.

451
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,120
I guess, you know, VHS and eventually DVD.

452
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,440
I don't know if they sold video games.

453
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,520
Maybe they had a small and then also obviously

454
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,640
collectibles of various kinds.

455
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,680
Yeah. Little statuettes and things like that.

456
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:45,280
All of the FYEs that I went to growing up, they used to be the wall.

457
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,960
It was the wall got flipped to FYE and the wall was the name of the store.

458
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,800
The wall was like all music.

459
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:55,360
And you could I remember you could take any CD to the front and go like,

460
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,600
can I listen to this? And they had listening booths.

461
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:02,840
And then, yeah, it was kind of like like more like a borders

462
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:07,400
and that it was like kind of dimly, you know, a lot of dark colors and stuff.

463
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:10,200
And then when it became FYE, it became very bright.

464
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:14,480
And FYE to me always seemed like a store that as soon as it opened,

465
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:18,000
it was flailing like Discovery Zone.

466
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:22,200
Discovery Zone had a few years where they were really going strong.

467
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,040
And then they started to lose their way.

468
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:28,320
FYE immediately seemed like this is a sinking ship.

469
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,280
Media is changing.

470
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:34,800
And I'm scared. FYE would feel like it was it would feel like anytime

471
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:37,680
I've been in one, it feels like a spirit Halloween in the sense like,

472
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,840
oh, they just threw all this stuff up on the wall, I guess.

473
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,640
Like, oh, OK, because they have a lot of stuff I would like collectible, etc.

474
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,880
But you'd be like, oh, this is this is on its way out, right?

475
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:48,080
Or this is a temporary store.

476
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,600
But it's it's hung on for a while.

477
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,520
Yeah, yeah.

478
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:55,120
But yeah, it always seemed like like they're planning on being out of there

479
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,880
in three weeks. Yeah. Yeah.

480
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,400
They could they could get everything in a big sack and get out the door

481
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,640
pretty quickly.

482
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:04,680
And it's funny that I'm saying this because all the arcades I have notes

483
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,920
are are are gone are pretty much gone.

484
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,040
There's one of them still going.

485
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:13,160
But the rest like ate it very, you know, in the recent past.

486
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,200
Yeah. Yeah. Well, let's talk about yours then, Jason.

487
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,680
So let's let's let's hear some of the your formative arcades.

488
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:22,760
And we'll talk about stuff that we love about any of these as we go.

489
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:25,840
What arcade tastes are where game tastes are and such.

490
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:30,160
Jordan, can you pull up that first picture of this was the arcade

491
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,720
and mall, Aladdin's Castle growing up.

492
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,000
This was a chain.

493
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,080
And there there's a couple different versions.

494
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,600
You can just cycle through the Aladdin's Castle pictures.

495
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,720
This is what I remember it as also very dark.

496
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:47,200
Not just another amusement center, it says. Yeah.

497
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:52,160
This is it started on that is the very last Aladdin's Castle

498
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:54,680
that closed, I believe, last year.

499
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:59,040
And so you can see kind of the design changes over the years.

500
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:03,560
By the time it got to the 90s of like the height of like X-Men

501
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:07,120
and Ninja Turtles and fighting games, I think they had removed

502
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,360
a lot of the like decorations and stuff.

503
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,720
Again, I just remember it being very dark.

504
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:17,840
And my my big memory of it is that we took a trip with the Cub Scouts

505
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,640
on like a Sunday night.

506
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:23,720
And as the mall was closing, they kept the arcade open for us.

507
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,960
And everyone got ten dollars and quarters.

508
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:32,520
And when everything cost a quarter or 50 cents, we were there for a few hours.

509
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,760
Like you could really make that last.

510
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,720
And the the other

511
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,720
and you're emotional about it.

512
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,640
Yeah, I am.

513
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:45,240
And Time Out was the other big chain.

514
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,240
Like one mall had an Aladdin's Castle.

515
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:49,520
The other malls had Time Out Arcade.

516
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:53,680
And I think we have a picture of that, too.

517
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,680
And this was very color.

518
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,600
This is how Time Out.

519
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,000
Oh, my God. We're looking at this.

520
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,360
Looks like the world of Sid and Marty Croft kind of stuff.

521
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:05,840
Yeah. And and so this is never looked like this.

522
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:08,200
This is how it used to look in the 70s and 80s.

523
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:11,640
Aladdin's Castle, too, used to have a lot of features,

524
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,920
but I think they're on a downswing.

525
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:17,280
Also, look, not to keep being gross,

526
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:21,160
but if this picture that we're looking at is kind of you descend the layers

527
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,680
and then it can go ahead, go ahead.

528
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:26,600
It gets more kind of like oval shaped.

529
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:27,680
I don't know.

530
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,160
Does this does this remind anybody?

531
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,000
Yeah, it's a little canal.

532
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,040
Are you saying birth canal or rectum?

533
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,600
Because the circle to me more suggests rectum.

534
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,880
I think that's that's that's where I thought you were going.

535
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,080
I didn't see all the way down.

536
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,640
Yeah, it could really could go either way.

537
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:45,160
Yeah. OK. You guys are going off of circle, which seem I'm looking at,

538
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,600
which seems a little bit more vaginal.

539
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:49,400
The colors suggest vaginal. Yeah.

540
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:52,200
Yeah. Well, yeah, you start heading into some purple.

541
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,000
Yeah. Yeah.

542
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,480
I also looks like it's like bored into like flesh.

543
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:01,400
So it's kind of Cronenberg is, you know, also this looks like it's a natural orifice.

544
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,560
This looks like the AI art that's been going around

545
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,960
where people make like fake movies from the 80s.

546
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:08,760
It's like David Cronenberg's arcade. Yeah.

547
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,920
That one about the arcade.

548
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:14,440
Yeah, it's like a giant crutch living woman.

549
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,640
Who an arcade is in her.

550
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,760
Yeah.

551
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:22,520
The timeout tunnel is much more suggestive than probably Jason imagined.

552
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,880
So I was it like this?

553
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:25,920
No, no, no, no.

554
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:28,600
Both of them were just like neon sign.

555
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,640
No decorations inside by the end.

556
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,160
You get to pass through the tunnel.

557
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:35,440
No, I think this is a holdover from like the 70s and 80s,

558
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:39,520
because when the rise of arcades kind of lines up with the rise of indoor

559
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:43,360
shopping malls, because before that, right before arcade cabinets,

560
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,280
there were, you know, pinball machines.

561
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:48,280
But those were like sleazy.

562
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:53,080
They were like in bars and bowling alleys and stuff and often run by the mob.

563
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:58,320
Like pinballs, pinballs, pinballs, and jukeboxes and slot machines

564
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,640
were like of the piece because it's an all cash business.

565
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:05,920
That like that the rest of the business and facility was not,

566
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:08,200
but they ran the machines.

567
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,960
Yeah, somewhere down the line.

568
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:15,240
There's like old photos of like just piles of destroyed pinball machines

569
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:18,440
and like the local sheriff giving thumbs up

570
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:22,840
because it was just seen as like gross and seedy.

571
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:23,880
So wait a minute.

572
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:28,560
Is this was it just a phenomenon that there were a lot that were mob run

573
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:32,080
or what percentage do you think in America

574
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:36,640
in the in the 60s or 70s of pinball machines were mob run?

575
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:41,040
I can't speak to that, but they had to change.

576
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,000
I I don't know.

577
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,240
You know, I think they had to change the perception

578
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:50,440
and like having these Daigo colored family oriented centers

579
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:54,320
as arcade cabinets, as you know, Pong and Centipede

580
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,640
and all these early games are starting to catch on.

581
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:01,480
Yeah, like it became a real profit, you know, profitable place

582
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:04,120
for like your Aladdin's Castle or your time out.

583
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:09,640
Aladdin's Castle eventually bought by Bally's, the slot machine company,

584
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,640
and then bought by Namco.

585
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:15,200
And at some point, Namco own time out and Aladdin's Castle.

586
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,760
Do you think that the mobsters who ran?

587
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,040
I knew this would be back to mob immediately.

588
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:20,920
Jason's going to talk.

589
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,360
And then as soon as mob.

590
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,880
Yeah, I know what you said.

591
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,880
I ignored the last couple sentences of what he said.

592
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:30,200
I literally I knew usual to not talk about.

593
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,240
We got to go back to the mob room.

594
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:33,880
I didn't discover this as a last moment.

595
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,800
Like I was baking and I was like, oh, this will be an oddly enough thing.

596
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,880
Or we're going to talk about it for half an hour.

597
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,840
It'll be half an hour. So yeah, continue. Yeah.

598
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:42,640
I mean, I look this.

599
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,560
I was going to do some comedy ideas here, really.

600
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,640
So we don't have to actually have a real discussion about it.

601
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:51,600
But like, was that like a lower level of the mob or was it the high level guys

602
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,080
doing the was there like a lower level?

603
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,920
Yeah, I mean, the pinball.

604
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:59,680
I do the pinball circuit and you're like, oh, well, I I run drugs.

605
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:02,160
I'm the guy who's like, you're a fucking loser.

606
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:02,680
Yeah, right.

607
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,480
You're a loser, Tony.

608
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,760
Pinball, small potatoes.

609
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:09,560
Well, we got we got an Adams family machine coming up

610
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:12,040
and all the kids are going to put the tokens in it.

611
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:14,240
It's like you you're a loser.

612
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:18,440
I'm the Irishman steals steaks and he paints houses.

613
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,400
Huh?

614
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,720
You're not doing as well as Henry down the street.

615
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,520
He's friends. Henry Hill.

616
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,600
He's friends with the teamster guy.

617
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:31,000
Oh, OK. Well, we got we got a Laverne and Shirley machine coming out soon, too.

618
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:33,520
That's been off the air for 10 years.

619
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,200
We couldn't figure out the rights.

620
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,680
You know, but when the ball goes up, you get it right in Lenny's mouth

621
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:42,200
and the kids are going to love it because he says his catchphrases.

622
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:47,120
I like imagining that they were a mob run until like the death of John Gotti.

623
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,120
Like, I love the idea.

624
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:51,400
It's like we're talking like the Terminator two machine is mob run.

625
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:54,760
I was partnering with Cameron.

626
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:59,960
John, I feel for real legitimizing John Gotti took care of the city.

627
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:04,720
John Gotti, John Gotti got us a dozen kiss slot machines.

628
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,440
We were never on tilt when John Gotti was.

629
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:12,680
Do you think anyone got killed over pinball?

630
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:17,680
That's how far did this guy probably if that that is true, probably.

631
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,640
That's that's tough stuff, man.

632
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,280
Your last few moments like real.

633
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,080
OK, all right. This is it.

634
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:25,680
This is how it ends. Yeah. Killed with pinballs.

635
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:31,600
If you could get the right projectile to show, I mean, they're they're bullet

636
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,800
esque, they're silver, they're hard.

637
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:37,560
If they came flying hundreds of miles an hour at you, I think you could.

638
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:40,440
You could kill somebody with a barrage of pinballs very easily.

639
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,880
I think, yeah, if you took the back off of a pinball machine

640
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:48,080
and just pointed the pinball machine at your enemy and just shot the pinballs

641
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,640
from the whatever that thing is just bring.

642
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:53,760
Yeah. Like in Goodfellas, when Pesci thinks he's going to get made,

643
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:56,200
they've actually they're actually lining up a pinball machine behind.

644
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:59,560
Yeah, they took the back off of it. Oh, no. Oh, what the hell?

645
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,080
Yeah. Bad news. Multi ball.

646
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:10,440
I have one more arcade.

647
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:13,520
This one a little little more wholesome.

648
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,080
This one is still open.

649
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:19,440
If you can bring up the pictures of Gillies Arcade,

650
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:24,000
this is on the boardwalk in Ocean City, New Jersey, still going strong.

651
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:29,240
And for a long time, it was one of the few 24 hour businesses

652
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,960
on the island of Ocean City.

653
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:36,400
And I this is how it looks now.

654
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:41,320
And they have expanded the Gillies company.

655
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:45,160
That's how the storefront I remember it a little less.

656
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:49,240
Intense, a little less decorated.

657
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:53,040
And then there's one more picture of like what it looks like inside

658
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:55,080
as a big tall ceiling.

659
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,880
I see a Rolling Stones pinball machine.

660
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,720
They have like every pinball machine.

661
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,920
I feel like Batman for Batman forever.

662
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,480
But is it is it dark?

663
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,040
That's dark night. It's got Ledger Joker.

664
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,880
I think it was Batman and Robin.

665
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,600
I assume that would be great.

666
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,920
I was there last summer.

667
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:12,160
I think I played the Munsters machine. Sure.

668
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:14,800
But they have so many pinball machines next to each other.

669
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:17,440
I think they have a lot of the music and sound effects turned down

670
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,760
because I think it would just sound like hell. Sure.

671
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,800
Yeah, they're doing it.

672
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:26,360
But I had not really processed that the Gillies family in Ocean City,

673
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:31,400
like the Gillies company now has a million other businesses, too.

674
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:35,840
They have a candy factory, ice cream factory, French fry factory,

675
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:41,440
T-shirt factory, bike rentals and a parking lot

676
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,960
and multiple vacation rental properties.

677
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,680
So this is they are they are just like the conglomerate,

678
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:52,000
the vacation conglomerates, like the waterside vacation conglomerate.

679
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,760
Yeah, a lot of these beach towns, there's like two or three companies

680
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:56,840
that own a lot of stuff.

681
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:59,840
Like the biggest amusement park on the island is called Gillians.

682
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:03,640
And the mayor is named his name is Jay Gillian.

683
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:09,400
And his father, Roy Gillian, is also was also the mayor in the late 80s.

684
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:12,040
So this is a mob of its own.

685
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:13,960
I was going to ask, is this sort of a mob?

686
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:16,800
I don't know. It's always a car. It's a carny town.

687
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:20,920
I know this is like one of the most wholesome Jersey shore towns

688
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:23,200
like this and Cape May.

689
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,920
But yeah, yeah, I was going to say it seems like arcades

690
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:30,400
in the US, at least like the only places that they're really left

691
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:34,440
and thriving like this are like waterside, like where you take the kids

692
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:37,480
on vacation to like get them out of your face if you're like parents.

693
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:40,120
You know what I mean? Yeah, I feel like that's like the last place

694
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:42,440
where they exist like this, like kids in the suburbs.

695
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,040
Like, I don't know, they just I don't know.

696
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:47,560
They just go scream slurs at each other while playing Call of Duty or whatever.

697
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,040
They don't need to leave the house to play video games

698
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:51,920
or to be social in that way.

699
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:52,640
I guess. Right.

700
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:55,040
Under it's like malls still have them.

701
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:59,440
Every mall I can think of around here still has an arcade, but they're

702
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:03,240
they're smaller, they're not as stacked, I wouldn't say.

703
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:07,040
And they're also not there's not a ton of kids and people.

704
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:10,760
It feels like the whole genre has shifted more to

705
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:15,400
to adults and to the like the version where you can drink.

706
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:18,080
It's the day investors in the round one ones.

707
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,160
Yeah, yeah, round one.

708
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:21,280
And it's got ever it's got karaoke and bowl.

709
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:23,160
It has to have a lot of different things.

710
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:27,160
And yeah, it's got it can't just be arcade games anymore because that's not so novel.

711
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:31,080
It's got to have as a party that you put together, Mike, it has to have karaoke

712
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:35,480
in the brightest room, karaoke that feels like a library meeting room.

713
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,960
Yeah, it's an odd choice at round one if you do karaoke,

714
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,920
which I had a perfectly fun time.

715
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:45,680
Yeah, I mean, but it is like it's like somehow brighter than their main floor,

716
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,720
the main show floor or whatever you call it.

717
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:50,000
Is where like a city council would meet.

718
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,240
Yes. Yeah, yeah.

719
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:55,400
And it's bright enough that they can broadcast it to local TV.

720
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,120
Right. And and the web.

721
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:00,360
I feel like you need to bring in like intravenous alcohol or something

722
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:03,240
with that level of like we need people to get drunk immediately.

723
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,680
We need instant drunk.

724
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:06,960
People cannot come in here sober.

725
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:11,560
Yeah. That's karaoke where you can see the wrinkles in veins in someone's face.

726
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,480
The dream.

727
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:18,800
But yeah, I know what you're looking I'm looking forward to, by the way,

728
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,680
speaking of how everything is becoming like drinking and video games.

729
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:24,720
I think we're all around the same age as we become.

730
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:27,360
You know, once the boomers start to kind of, you know, die off,

731
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:31,200
culture is going to shift around to be people our age.

732
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:33,600
And it's going to be fun for about 20 years, probably.

733
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:37,000
Right. Aside from the whole, you know, the oceans boiling and,

734
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,200
you know, all that kind of stuff.

735
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:41,800
But, you know, just in terms of the the way that things are

736
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:45,760
bent to make us try to spend money, you know, I'm pretty psyched for that.

737
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:50,600
Yeah. I mean, just the way like at theme parks like Universal and Disney

738
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:55,960
pulling out like retro merchandise or like stuff for rides that have closed.

739
00:34:56,400 --> 00:35:00,760
I always am wondering, it's like, is this for the parents who remember it

740
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:04,920
or like the kids who like throwback stuff, you know?

741
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:07,920
Yeah. And like when I'm 60, I'll be like

742
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:11,480
in an evil, horny mode at a bare naked ladies concert.

743
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:15,200
Like that'll be when they finally

744
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:18,800
well, when they bring struck back to Steven when they bring Steven Page back,

745
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,120
which is, of course, my big thing is they need to.

746
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:23,120
I think they're keeping him out of the band.

747
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,800
You think it's that way? I believe it's that.

748
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,600
And I believe I will not see them until he's back in the band.

749
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:31,560
Mike, I if you remember, I went to a bare naked ladies concert

750
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:34,760
with my family in Atlantic City about 10 years ago.

751
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:39,600
Yes. Right. And my brother and I were easily some of the youngest people.

752
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,400
Oh, I believe that. Yeah. Yeah.

753
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,920
And Steven was out of the band at that point. I think so.

754
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:47,160
I think you were saying the bare naked ladies have not made

755
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,960
the transition to a Gen Z audience.

756
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,480
We are we are failing the generation behind us. That's true.

757
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,760
But they did the Big Bang. They got the Big Bang theme.

758
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:59,680
So there are some they were a bunch of there was just one group of people

759
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,960
in Bazinga shirts. And now we just need that.

760
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:04,000
We just need a tick tock dance to one week.

761
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,520
And that should set things off.

762
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:09,640
Or or tick tock dance to if I had a million dollars from the live album.

763
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:11,560
Sure. And figure out a way to make it takes is one.

764
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:14,120
We just need to like we need the situation.

765
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:16,720
Right. We would make dreams situation.

766
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:21,640
And Megan, too, if in the sequel to Megan, she could dance to.

767
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:24,960
Oh, wow. What a good idea to the old apartment.

768
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:26,760
Oh, yeah.

769
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,320
A really danceable song. Oh, yeah.

770
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:33,320
One of their most danceable songs.

771
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:35,600
You know, yeah, it hits pretty hard, you know.

772
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:38,200
So I think it's perfect for Megan. Yeah. Yeah.

773
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:42,440
I'm picturing now like in an old folks home, you know,

774
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:44,440
when everyone ends up there, that's our age.

775
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:46,120
They're going to have like

776
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:49,480
instead of watching like, you know, I don't know, old war broadcasts

777
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:50,880
or whatever they do for like people.

778
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,520
Now it's going to be watching like class classic era Simpsons

779
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:56,040
between seasons three and eight Simpsons.

780
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:59,120
And all the all the men are going to know all the lines

781
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:02,440
and all the women are going to be annoyed looking at whatever the

782
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,760
whatever the version of the phone is then.

783
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,800
I don't know what's going to be.

784
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:12,280
Well, and everybody like, you know, see, it got a lot worse in season nine.

785
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:14,240
Yeah, that's what I was.

786
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:18,480
That's the most like any people who are like about to die.

787
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:21,000
That's their last gasp of energy is.

788
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Yeah, that's right. Wait, wait a minute.

789
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,160
Well, the carny one was OK behind the laughter.

790
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,920
That had some spark to it.

791
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:31,920
Disney Plus converted them all to high definition and they stretched

792
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:36,680
they stretched the four by three orderlies

793
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,920
having to pull apart two guys just fighting about the principal

794
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,680
and the pauper and whether that was when the show

795
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:46,080
they made too big of a deal of it.

796
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:48,720
Oh, it betrayed that we love the character.

797
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,960
The show, of course, would still be on the air then,

798
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,440
and El Jean would still be running it.

799
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:56,040
That's right. So

800
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:58,240
it's a lot of bionic parts.

801
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,800
Yeah. Yeah. Wow.

802
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:04,960
I never thought we'd make it to episode 4000 season 102.

803
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:10,680
Wow. There are three shows, Family Guy, Graze Anatomy and The Simpsons.

804
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,160
That's all that's left.

805
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:15,320
And every other she just started gathering up characters

806
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,320
from other shows, you know, like like the Stranger Things

807
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:21,640
characters got added to Graze Anatomy.

808
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:22,480
Mm hmm.

809
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:27,000
Bob's Burgers just morphed with it like the Belcher's moved in with Family Guy.

810
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,000
So that that just Family Guy just swallowed Bob's Burgers.

811
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:32,400
Everybody's represented. Yeah, yeah.

812
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,880
That's right. All the all the TV, all the media companies

813
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:39,040
consolidated and soon the TV shows will consolidate as well.

814
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,720
That's what you're saying.

815
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,280
We're just heading towards Game Master Anthony being

816
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:48,040
just a ready player one. Right. Right.

817
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:50,560
Is going to happen.

818
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:53,800
If you know, if you're if you can't, if you're kind of tribal about like

819
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,440
I like Star Wars, no, I like Marvel. No, I like Avatar.

820
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,600
Well, they're all going to be one thing. That's right.

821
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:02,320
We'll find out which characters are officially the best when they all fight.

822
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,840
That's right. That's entertainment soon.

823
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,680
I want to I want to talk more about

824
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:12,960
the idea of the arcades in the same way that

825
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:16,960
the Hall of President talks about the idea of a president.

826
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,920
And I don't know, because to me,

827
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:24,080
yeah, when we grew up, we had Nintendo, we had Super Nintendo,

828
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:30,200
but the arcade would give you a better like graphical presentation.

829
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:33,880
It feels like it was a different like a high octane version of a video,

830
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:36,280
especially if it was like a racing game and you got to sit in a seat

831
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:41,840
because it finally was like it just it was obviously like more horsepower,

832
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:45,960
whatever the actual name of a graphical processor, whatever that is.

833
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:50,320
Was there even the issue at some point of like, can home consoles,

834
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:55,160
will home consoles ever be as good as what you can just drive a short distance to go?

835
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:58,000
Probably. Probably.

836
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:03,040
You forget what a big sea change it was that it was an arcade centric medium,

837
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,440
and then it completely switched to a home. Right.

838
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:09,640
I'm not smart enough to know exactly when like that threshold was met.

839
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:14,640
But it feels like around Nintendo 64 is when you start going,

840
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:17,120
oh, this is pretty good and pretty close.

841
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:20,600
Like I think graphics were still better in arcades for a while longer.

842
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:25,480
But your mic minds in USA type like well that like, yeah,

843
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:28,280
like there's there's bigger flashier stuff. Yeah.

844
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:30,200
Go to a place to see it.

845
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:33,320
So yeah, we so all this stuff like I we've talked about on the show before.

846
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:37,560
Enchanted Castle was a crazy place that I loved,

847
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:41,120
which had so many arcade games and had an animatronic show.

848
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:43,400
Of course, the jam and jesters.

849
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:47,320
Oh, yes. This came up because of Sally Dark Rides on the Patreon, correct?

850
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:51,840
Yes. That was it was this really odd only there and now gone.

851
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:54,840
OK, but it involved a lot of songs from the musical Pippin.

852
00:40:55,960 --> 00:41:00,520
For some reason, it was a lot of Pippin in the Jam and Jester show.

853
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,760
But yeah, there was an Aladdin's Castle as well.

854
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:10,120
But I remember just being in the same way that I would go into like a retail store

855
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:14,520
and be like desperate to find the toy section.

856
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:19,200
Any time we went to like a roller skating party, an ice skating party,

857
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:22,040
I had my eye on where is the arcade?

858
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:25,840
And the really when I think about what the most exciting arcade was for me,

859
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:31,320
it was in Poplar Creek Bowl, which was a bowling alley that had three or four games.

860
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:34,040
And it's still there. It's still in Schomburg.

861
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:39,080
And it was primarily because I was so obsessed with Ninja Turtles

862
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:41,920
that it had the Ninja Turtles game.

863
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:44,360
And in the same way that when we watch a movie in school

864
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:48,200
and the New Line Cinema logo would come up, I had I had a mono focus

865
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:49,400
when it came to arcades.

866
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:51,720
And it was do they have that Ninja Turtles game?

867
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:54,520
I love the Simpsons game. I like a bunch of other games.

868
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:58,880
But I was almost more consumed with just being near my friends

869
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:04,080
than I was being with a big option, a big bunch of options.

870
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:06,560
When I was little, when I was a little older, there was other stuff.

871
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,480
By your friends, you mean the Ninja Turtles?

872
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,680
Yes, I thought that was clear.

873
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:10,320
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

874
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,680
OK. Just make it.

875
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:14,080
It's possible that there could be friends around.

876
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:15,400
No, I don't.

877
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,400
I was going to say this.

878
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:19,440
The actual social aspect of arcades were a big

879
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:22,560
component of their success, because with with malls

880
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:27,560
spraddling up, like parents could leave the kid with a few bucks.

881
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:28,760
Yes. And come back.

882
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:32,880
Now, now my mother would not do that, but that was for sure happening.

883
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:37,360
But I remember, yeah, anytime you go to a place

884
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:41,800
that you kind of got like a sense like, oh, this place might have a couple of games.

885
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:45,000
Like it would be I would be almost more interested in that,

886
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,680
primarily for Ninja Turtles than the actual activity.

887
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:51,200
I like bowling fine, but I wanted to just stay in there

888
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:54,920
and wait for the older kids to be done playing the Ninja Turtles game.

889
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:57,680
So I could sneak in there and play.

890
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:00,240
Yeah, this is when you talk arcades in general.

891
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:03,360
That's a big thing I flash to is like, oh, older kids.

892
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:06,360
Oh, older kids are doing the thing that I want to do.

893
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:08,840
Yes. Older kids are behind me wanting to do

894
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:12,440
my thing and I will cave immediately or I will get so sweaty

895
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:17,240
and start playing this thing so badly that I that it's game over and I have to go.

896
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:19,520
Yes. The older kids situation

897
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:21,960
makes this all dark to talk about.

898
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:26,400
Yes, I have such strong memories of that turtle, like a bunch of older kids.

899
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:29,120
And when we say older kids, they were probably two years older.

900
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:30,560
They're probably nine years old.

901
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:31,840
I'm seven and they're nine.

902
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:33,560
And I think these are like 30 year olds.

903
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:36,560
This is so interesting because I never encountered this.

904
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:42,320
I think I had like short by default of being short and always young looking.

905
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:46,240
They probably all thought I was five or six years younger than I actually was.

906
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:48,160
So I didn't get in any trouble.

907
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:51,880
But there was I'm remembering there was another Ocean City

908
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:55,720
arcade called Aquaport, and that was by like the center of town.

909
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:58,640
It was by a big ice cream parlor, big playground.

910
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:03,680
And that's where the teenagers would smoke and poorly skateboard outside.

911
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:06,640
But it was more of an ordeal to go there.

912
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:08,120
So you were never more of a rigmarole.

913
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:10,040
You were never scared of them at the arcade.

914
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:12,440
The older kids. No. Really? Yeah.

915
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,600
This is wild, Patrick. Yeah, Patrick.

916
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:15,200
You have an older kid.

917
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:19,360
I mean, I don't think I definitely didn't have any run ins that I can remember.

918
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:21,400
I think I was probably intimidated.

919
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:24,760
But I also kind of I never played anything that was competitive

920
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:28,440
unless I was with like, you know, you can't leave an open

921
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:32,000
play the computer in like a fighting game and leave the option for somebody to come in

922
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,560
because then you could get beat and it's embarrassing. Yeah. Right.

923
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:37,080
So so you got to make sure you have a pair for that.

924
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:38,840
But I mean, other than that, I played a lot.

925
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:43,000
I played a lot of like the, you know, X-Men or anything with the three screens

926
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,440
or the use of Ninja Turtles. Yeah. Yeah.

927
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:46,600
The four player kind of thing.

928
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:48,840
Yeah. Anything that was like Simpsons was that way.

929
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:53,040
Certainly, if there were older kids there, I would want I would find something else to do.

930
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:54,880
That's OK.

931
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:57,480
So you weren't afraid of them, but maybe you steered clear.

932
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:00,560
I'm not going to I'm not going to like put my quarter on the, you know,

933
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:03,480
you put it on the little things to mark your place.

934
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:04,840
Like, I'm not doing that.

935
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:07,040
Oh, when there's somebody who's 11 there.

936
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:09,720
Oh, 11. Oh, God.

937
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:14,040
Yeah, because like also I remember even do it when like fighting games

938
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:16,600
really like Mortal Kombat, which we've talked about before.

939
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,400
I was obsessed with playing Mortal Kombat with the blood.

940
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:23,200
And I had Super Nintendo and Super Nintendo did not have blood in Mortal Kombat.

941
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:24,600
It would not allow it.

942
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:27,120
And I hated that. I wanted to see the blood.

943
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:29,840
I was a child who loved blood, I guess.

944
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:32,560
But it felt like adult or whatever.

945
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:38,360
But this could the blood situation ever come across your mother's desk.

946
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:41,040
Was she aware that you had this blood fascination?

947
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:42,480
Did you keep it secret at all?

948
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:45,560
I'm sure I kept my blood lust secret from my mother.

949
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:47,520
I had to. I had no choice.

950
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:49,960
She didn't catch you playing the blood version.

951
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:52,560
And there were I never had the blood version of you.

952
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:54,560
Did you have Super Nintendo or Genesis? Super Nintendo.

953
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:57,040
Yeah, so you couldn't get the blood, couldn't get the blood

954
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:58,520
because that was only on Genesis.

955
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:00,120
It's like main selling point was the blood.

956
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:01,720
Yes. Was Mortal Kombat two?

957
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:02,800
Did the Super Nintendo allow it?

958
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:04,720
Have it have the blood?

959
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:05,880
Oh, maybe for two they did.

960
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:08,160
I'm talking about for the first one. That's what I was talking about, too.

961
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:10,960
Yeah. But any time I would try to play it,

962
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:15,840
you would I would I never I would never win a fighting game in an arcade.

963
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:17,920
I never won a round. Yeah, yeah.

964
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:20,480
You get killed by an older kid. Yeah.

965
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:22,080
I don't recall a single time.

966
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:24,760
So I play Street Fighter, I play Mortal Kombat, and I would feel

967
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:27,520
I would be humiliated, which we've talked about recently.

968
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:30,560
Like when you were a little kid, we talk about it a lot, I guess.

969
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:35,280
And you were humiliated by you were humiliated

970
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:38,600
because the older kids would literally dominate you.

971
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:41,720
And then you just because you get a dollar or whatever.

972
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:43,760
It is literal domination. Yes.

973
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:45,440
Yeah. Technical sense. Yes.

974
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:47,920
Yeah. Because, yes, I'm talking about in a video.

975
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:50,120
You would be dominated in a video game. Yeah.

976
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:53,800
And I would just be like, I felt like shit.

977
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:57,920
I would be feeling so bad about myself because I could never beat anybody.

978
00:46:58,080 --> 00:47:01,040
And even to this day, I don't think I don't think I've ever beaten

979
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:04,280
a stranger in an arcade setting. Wow. Yeah.

980
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:08,960
I I would play those occasionally, but I think I gravitate it more towards

981
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:14,200
besides Turtles and X-Men and Simpsons, the shooting game, light gun games.

982
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:18,320
Yeah. Like the Aerosmith Revolution, Revolution X.

983
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:19,120
Yeah. Revolution X.

984
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:21,080
Excuse me. Terminator two.

985
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:24,680
And then I don't know if anyone remembers the oddly

986
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:27,680
photorealistic lethal enforcers. Yeah.

987
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:29,600
Yeah. You were shooting. Yeah.

988
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:33,200
You were just shooting bad guys in normal clothes.

989
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:36,960
Like it was just regular people, but they had mean sunglasses on

990
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:40,800
or like a flashy jacket and they'd be shooting at you. Sure.

991
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:44,320
And this is a great it's a wonderful poster.

992
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:46,480
The poster. Yeah.

993
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:49,320
Who I can't imagine they look like that in the game.

994
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:52,840
Well, that's such a great well, but there was there was that era of video games

995
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:55,840
where they were used in Mortal Kombat.

996
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:57,000
We've talked about this, I think, before.

997
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,920
Mortal Kombat does a little of like it was actual people

998
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:02,320
and using whatever technology of the day.

999
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:05,760
It would look a little bit more like they were actually scanning them in.

1000
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:09,040
Yeah. I remember the Batman Forever Super Nintendo game was like that.

1001
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:11,000
And then there were a lot of arcade games.

1002
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:15,200
There was that Scottie Pippen Sega CD game where it was like live action.

1003
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:19,000
Scottie Pippen, which I'm sure was impossible to play.

1004
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,840
I'm sure it was a bad game. Yeah.

1005
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:23,280
There were four people played that game. Right.

1006
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:24,920
I don't think I've ever even heard of that game.

1007
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:28,000
Sega CD as in and of itself was already kind of one of those. Yes.

1008
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:31,880
Formats like it was like the what is it like the babysitter murder game?

1009
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:34,240
Right. Was on the right night stalker or whatever.

1010
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:36,120
And then Sewer Shark.

1011
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:38,600
That's like all I remember. Yeah.

1012
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:41,000
I never had it, but a friend had it.

1013
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:44,200
And yeah, it was it was a similar virtual boy situation

1014
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:47,360
where it sounded cooler than when it lived up to be.

1015
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:51,080
Slam City with Scottie Pippen is the name of the game.

1016
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:53,920
Which is great.

1017
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:58,200
Revolution X, I remember at a lot of the Disney World hotels

1018
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:01,920
had Revolution X like no one was thinking at the time,

1019
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:05,200
like, should we have all these gun games at the happiest place on earth?

1020
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:06,160
You know?

1021
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:08,960
But I the arcade.

1022
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:10,400
Maybe that was part of their contract.

1023
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:12,160
Like if we're not doing the right thing, I'm doing it.

1024
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:17,040
Point those machines and brand expansion opportunity for us. Right.

1025
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:20,080
The arcade, I remember.

1026
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:21,280
What is that? What is that?

1027
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:23,840
What was that? That was very arcade.

1028
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:24,800
That sounded cool.

1029
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:28,040
It's the it's the evil whatever they're called.

1030
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:32,040
The bad guys from Revolution X have hacked into. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no.

1031
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:36,800
We'll need a gun that shoots both bullets and compact discs at them.

1032
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:38,160
Yeah. Yeah.

1033
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:40,520
They're called the New Order Nation Regime.

1034
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:41,720
That's that's the.

1035
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:48,160
The Disney arcade memory I have very weirdly is

1036
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:52,840
I think a lot of people fondly remember like, oh, the contemporary hotel

1037
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:54,280
used to have a big arcade. Oh, yeah.

1038
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:58,520
They're arcade, you know, getting all space bound in Florida and California.

1039
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:02,720
But I remember a very small arcade at the beach and Yacht Club

1040
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:07,160
that we would end up going to to kill time before we ate at the Cape

1041
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:09,160
May Seafood Buffet.

1042
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:12,400
That was one of my family's like, all right, we're here too early

1043
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:15,080
for our seafood buffet.

1044
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:17,480
So we're going to kill time at the arcade.

1045
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:21,560
Sounds like such a chore for you. I know. I know.

1046
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:25,760
Oh, what a time for my seafood, my endless seafood.

1047
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:28,720
You also called it the Beach and Yacht Club.

1048
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:30,800
Oh, instead of the beach club.

1049
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:32,120
I found that interesting.

1050
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:33,680
That was bullshit.

1051
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:35,600
I'm glad you called Jason on it.

1052
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:38,120
I'm getting my ass roasted today.

1053
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:43,120
I consider that a roast of Mike for thinking that was enough to care about.

1054
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:46,240
Just to clarify where my roasting is.

1055
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:48,000
Yeah, yeah, he roasted me.

1056
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,760
You're clean. Fair enough.

1057
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:50,920
You're doing fine.

1058
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:52,880
Fired a bunch of pinball. Eventually.

1059
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:54,800
Oh, is this some slam city with Scottie Pippen?

1060
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:58,760
This is the full game.

1061
00:50:58,760 --> 00:50:59,760
Oh, yeah. 55 minutes.

1062
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:01,760
This is a whole version of it.

1063
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:04,760
So you're in space.

1064
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:07,760
I hope I'm right and it's actually a video and I don't look like a fool here.

1065
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:10,760
The iconic Sega CD logo has appeared.

1066
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:11,760
Yeah, there's Sonic.

1067
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:12,760
You know that sound.

1068
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:13,760
That's Sonic.

1069
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:15,760
And it's got the little Sonic chime.

1070
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:19,760
Somehow sounds worse than the Sega Genesis chime.

1071
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:20,760
There's Sonic.

1072
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:22,720
Oh, wait.

1073
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:24,720
Oh, but it transitioned to a basketball.

1074
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:25,720
Yeah.

1075
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:27,720
A 3D looking basketball.

1076
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:28,720
Look out.

1077
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:30,720
That's the power of the processing you get with the Sega CD.

1078
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:32,720
Oh, they're showing off there.

1079
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:35,720
I like, by the way, I like how this is gearing up.

1080
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:36,720
This is fun.

1081
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:37,720
You and me.

1082
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:39,720
Yeah, Scottie, my man.

1083
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:41,720
I love it.

1084
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:42,720
Wait, wait, let's just watch that.

1085
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:43,720
Yeah, I love it.

1086
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:44,720
I love it.

1087
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:45,720
I love it.

1088
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:46,720
I love it.

1089
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:47,720
I love it.

1090
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:48,720
I love it.

1091
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:49,720
I love it.

1092
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:51,680
You and me.

1093
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:52,680
Can we find the top of the Scottie?

1094
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:53,680
Oh, here we go.

1095
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:54,680
Yeah, yeah.

1096
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:55,680
All right.

1097
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:56,680
Let's just hear Scottie.

1098
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:57,680
High quality video.

1099
00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:05,680
Is this like Mad Dog McCree but with Scottie Pippen playing basketball?

1100
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:06,680
Dominate the court.

1101
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:07,680
Earn some real respect.

1102
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:08,680
Dominate.

1103
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:09,680
You and me will play one on one.

1104
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:10,680
What do you say?

1105
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:11,680
I say I'm in.

1106
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:14,680
That is way too much pressure for me.

1107
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:16,680
I love, this is great.

1108
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:21,800
You're playing that at home and then you just press eject silently back in the case and

1109
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:22,800
walk away.

1110
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:27,160
There is no way I will earn enough respect to top one of the best NBA players.

1111
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:28,160
Of all time.

1112
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:29,160
Yeah.

1113
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:30,160
Sir, I don't believe I can dominate you.

1114
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:31,160
I still.

1115
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:32,160
I am seven years old.

1116
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:33,160
I am not.

1117
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:36,160
Jason talking to the screen.

1118
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:39,520
Mr. Pippen, I apologize.

1119
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:40,520
Thank you for your sir.

1120
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:41,520
I'm saluting you.

1121
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:43,840
I didn't know it was a one on one situation.

1122
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:46,240
I thought maybe you were the host of this.

1123
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:49,600
I didn't realize you were a participant and frankly I can't go toe to toe with you.

1124
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:51,680
Sir, I thought this was the musical Pippen.

1125
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:53,120
I was very confused.

1126
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:59,440
I am returning this to Wesco's video to live vicariously through the adventures of Vector

1127
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:00,440
Man.

1128
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:01,440
I will be.

1129
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:03,760
Gee, I am more comfortable with Vector Man.

1130
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:09,000
Yeah, this, oh by the way, I still have unopened the Scottie Pippen Digits bourbon.

1131
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,760
I'm saving it for a special occasion.

1132
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:12,760
Geez.

1133
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:14,720
And that was not the birth of your child.

1134
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:16,200
I was thinking that was good.

1135
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:17,200
That's not special enough.

1136
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:19,520
I was thinking that was good what was going to happen, but it didn't happen.

1137
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:20,520
So it's going to have to be different.

1138
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:22,560
You made digits.

1139
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:25,360
You produced, those digits didn't exist before you.

1140
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:26,360
Very true.

1141
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:28,360
And those are your, you made the digits.

1142
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:29,680
You had to open some digits.

1143
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:30,680
Okay, well soon.

1144
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:33,520
We'll figure, we'll figure out maybe the first birthday or something.

1145
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:34,520
That's nice.

1146
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:35,520
Uh huh.

1147
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:38,400
I hope, well I hope that's at a park or something and you got to discreetly, hey I got this

1148
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:39,400
digits under the table.

1149
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:40,400
I got digits.

1150
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:43,040
Did you ask Scottie Pippen's birth, you know, Scottie Pippen.

1151
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:44,040
Uh uh.

1152
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:45,360
Uh uh.

1153
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:46,360
You want to take it?

1154
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:47,360
It's not the musical.

1155
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:48,360
Not the musical.

1156
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:49,360
Scottie from the Bulls.

1157
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:51,480
It's not a branded bourbon to the musical Pippen.

1158
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:55,040
You know, ex-husband of Larsa Pippen, come on.

1159
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:58,600
Oh and Larsa was dating Michael Jordan's son.

1160
00:53:58,600 --> 00:53:59,600
Yeah that's right.

1161
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:00,600
What?

1162
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:01,600
I was picturing the intimidation video.

1163
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:02,600
Oh yeah.

1164
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:03,600
I was being sent to Michael Jordan's son.

1165
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:06,080
I said that in both Jason and Scott you started typing.

1166
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:07,080
What do you mean?

1167
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:09,560
Wait, she was, okay she was a real housewife?

1168
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:12,360
Yeah, yeah, Larsa, yeah they divorced a couple years ago.

1169
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:14,000
And she dated, whoa.

1170
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:18,040
And she's been like going places with Michael Jordan's son and they're like, we're just

1171
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:19,040
friends.

1172
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:20,040
I know, I know.

1173
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:22,040
Yeah, I love to be friends with somebody who's 18 years younger than me.

1174
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:23,040
Yes, this is wild.

1175
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:24,040
And uh, yeah.

1176
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:27,000
This is like Jada and that guy.

1177
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:30,040
I think they need a red table of their own.

1178
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:32,040
I guess they gotta pick a different color.

1179
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:33,040
Red's taken.

1180
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:34,040
Well the Bulls was red.

1181
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:35,040
Bulls is red.

1182
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:36,040
Well black was in there too.

1183
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:37,040
I don't know.

1184
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:38,040
The black and red table.

1185
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:39,040
The black and red table.

1186
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:40,040
There we go.

1187
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:41,040
Now it's Bulls branded.

1188
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:43,040
We're taking this to Michael Jordan's steakhouse.

1189
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:44,080
Oh man.

1190
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:50,080
Real quick before I, I also, we should just do a future episode on this.

1191
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:53,080
The arcade shows of the era too.

1192
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:56,080
Like in Nick Arcade, remember Nick Arcade of course.

1193
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:58,080
Nick Arcade was a dream.

1194
00:54:58,080 --> 00:54:59,080
A dream.

1195
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:00,080
Oh my god.

1196
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:02,080
It probably was the dumbest thing in the world to try to play.

1197
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:04,080
But man, when I was like, I'm in the game.

1198
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:06,080
I can't believe this.

1199
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:08,080
Probably a nightmare.

1200
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:09,080
Nightmare to play.

1201
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:10,080
Super not fun.

1202
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:16,120
The final round where you go inside the game, it was basically you were just like in a green screen.

1203
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:23,120
And you were trying, I think the kids were like looking at a monitor or something, trying to see what the digital elements of the video game.

1204
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:24,120
Trying to like dodge something.

1205
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:25,120
Right.

1206
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:28,120
And they're confused and like, it's like you're looking at two places.

1207
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:30,120
Like it would, because you'd always get mad as a kid.

1208
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:32,120
Like why are they doing better?

1209
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:34,120
They've achieved my dream.

1210
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:35,120
Yeah.

1211
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:36,120
They are flushing it down the toilet.

1212
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:39,120
Like the girl just got hit in the head with a ghost.

1213
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:40,160
Just duck.

1214
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:41,160
Idiot.

1215
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:45,160
And that's how every kid felt watching kids somehow not be able to put together the silver monkey.

1216
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:46,160
Right.

1217
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:47,160
Oh, yes.

1218
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:48,160
There's three pieces.

1219
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:49,160
For god's sakes.

1220
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:50,160
100 percent.

1221
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:53,160
That one feels like, well, OK, let's pull the room.

1222
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:57,160
I think that I'd be bad at Nick Arcade despite all that.

1223
00:55:57,160 --> 00:55:58,160
Like, come on, idiot.

1224
00:55:58,160 --> 00:55:59,160
Do it.

1225
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:00,160
I think I would be horrible at it.

1226
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:02,160
And the green screen is really confusing.

1227
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:06,160
But the silver monkey, I kind of feel like I could have done.

1228
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:08,160
But maybe it's like darker, stressful.

1229
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:09,200
I don't know.

1230
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:10,200
You mean the whole thing?

1231
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,200
I think.

1232
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:12,200
Oh, no, no, no.

1233
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:16,200
Oh, I'd be bad at much of the physical effort involved in Legends of the Hidden Temple.

1234
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:20,200
But the actual putting together of the puzzle, I don't seem that hard to me.

1235
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:22,200
But what do you think, Patrick?

1236
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:23,200
Yeah.

1237
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:27,200
Well, the only thing I would say is if there hadn't already been like the scary guy that

1238
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:31,200
gets you that came through, I think maybe I'd be distracted by waiting for like the jump

1239
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:34,200
scare and thinking I was going to have a heart attack at age 10.

1240
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:35,200
Right.

1241
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:38,240
Maybe that would like derail the monkey thing.

1242
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:41,240
I can't count on myself under pressure in that kind of situation.

1243
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:45,240
So, you know, as much as I'm talking shit, I think I probably have a little trouble.

1244
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:49,240
I wouldn't like it wouldn't be like blowing the whole thing for my team, but it would

1245
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:51,240
definitely cost a few seconds, I would guess.

1246
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:52,240
Gotcha.

1247
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:57,240
And real quick, the show I also I learned about because I never saw it was a show

1248
00:56:57,240 --> 00:57:02,240
called Video Power that was similar to Nick Arcade and it was hosted by a kid named

1249
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:06,280
Johnny Arcade, very excited about diving into more.

1250
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:08,280
I don't remember that one.

1251
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:09,280
Johnny Arcade.

1252
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:10,280
I don't rather lazy.

1253
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:11,280
He's OK.

1254
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:13,280
So he's the video game master.

1255
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:14,280
Yeah.

1256
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:15,280
He's the guy you have to like beat or something.

1257
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:16,280
I've never seen this.

1258
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:18,280
There was trivia, I think, involved in it.

1259
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:20,280
But also there was, yeah, an element of playing video games.

1260
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:23,280
You didn't go in the game like Nick Arcade, but it was a similar show.

1261
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:25,280
This is like a Beat the Geeks.

1262
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:27,280
But yeah, one guy.

1263
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:28,280
Similar.

1264
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:29,280
Yeah, I think.

1265
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:32,320
But yeah, I just came upon it while I was looking around for stuff.

1266
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:34,320
So aesthetically, it's wonderful.

1267
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:40,320
And I'm looking at a kid who's the most like Bobby Budnick red hair mullet kid ever.

1268
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:41,320
This is one of the streets.

1269
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:44,320
A bowl cut with a mullet underneath.

1270
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:47,320
It manages to be too unflattering hairstyles.

1271
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:50,320
When you're let me show you so you guys can see at least.

1272
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:51,320
Oh, sure.

1273
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:52,320
That's an insane look.

1274
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:53,320
That's interesting.

1275
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:55,320
Why would they punish children with these?

1276
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:56,320
But that's not Johnny Arcade.

1277
00:57:56,320 --> 00:57:57,320
Johnny Arcade.

1278
00:57:57,320 --> 00:57:58,320
That's not Johnny Arcade.

1279
00:57:58,360 --> 00:58:00,360
Johnny Arcade is like this cool dude.

1280
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:01,360
Yeah, yeah.

1281
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:02,360
And the big chair.

1282
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:03,360
Yeah, yeah.

1283
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:05,360
Played by actor Stevie Paskowski.

1284
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:07,360
Yeah, of course.

1285
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:09,360
Stevie Paskowski.

1286
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:12,360
Yeah, Academy Award nominee.

1287
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:15,360
He was in the he's on Agents of Shield.

1288
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:18,360
So Johnny Arcade is in the MCU.

1289
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:19,360
That's great.

1290
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:24,360
That finally Johnny Arcade is joining the MCU.

1291
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:25,360
I love when they have those announcements.

1292
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:26,360
Yeah.

1293
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:27,360
Mr. Arcade.

1294
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:29,400
Morgan Freeman is joining the MCU.

1295
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:32,360
That was one of the feel like Agents of Shield like Ike

1296
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:35,360
Parramutter had his iron grip on it.

1297
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:37,360
It's like, OK, we can't use most characters.

1298
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:40,360
We're clear to use Johnny Arcade.

1299
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:44,360
They're letting us everything's consolidating.

1300
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:45,360
Much expense.

1301
00:58:45,360 --> 00:58:50,360
I have purchased the character Johnny Arcade from what's the show called?

1302
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:51,360
Video Power.

1303
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:52,360
Video Power.

1304
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:53,360
Yeah.

1305
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:54,360
I faintly remember.

1306
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:57,360
The last time Ike ever put on a television.

1307
00:58:57,360 --> 00:58:58,360
That's what was on.

1308
00:58:58,360 --> 00:59:01,360
So he assumed Johnny was big with the kids.

1309
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:05,360
He catches it every now and then at Mar-a-Lago out of the corner of his eye.

1310
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:07,360
Before he says turn that shit off.

1311
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:08,360
Yeah.

1312
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:09,360
Put on a golf match.

1313
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:12,360
No, this is like a Heim Saban thing.

1314
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:13,360
Apparently.

1315
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:14,360
Oh, I didn't actually know that.

1316
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:15,360
Video Power.

1317
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:16,360
That makes sense.

1318
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:22,360
Another kind of like notorious odd, right?

1319
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:25,360
He's like a cantankerous scumbag guy.

1320
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:26,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1321
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:33,360
It's a big time political donor, but made a lot of his money underpaying all those child actors.

1322
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:34,360
All the Power Rangers.

1323
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:35,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1324
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:36,360
That's right.

1325
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:37,360
That's right.

1326
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:44,360
Well, when the Hollywood Reporter reported that he did not actually compose all the music in all of the shows he made.

1327
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:45,360
What?

1328
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:48,360
Which totals 3,700 pieces of music.

1329
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:49,360
Oh, I don't believe that.

1330
00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:55,360
So he did not himself compose 3,700 songs while also producing all of the shows.

1331
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:56,360
Oh my.

1332
00:59:56,360 --> 00:59:57,360
I thought he did.

1333
00:59:57,360 --> 00:59:58,360
Mr. Saban.

1334
00:59:58,360 --> 00:59:59,360
I thought he did.

1335
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:00,360
Okay.

1336
01:00:00,360 --> 01:00:13,360
Well, having branched out into arcade world a little bit more, I think we should narrow focus a little bit and talk about the place that Patrick came in to talk about, which inspired this episode, which I'm so excited to get into.

1337
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:21,360
Do you want to introduce us to the general premise and place and the basics here?

1338
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:22,360
Yeah.

1339
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:26,360
So this is, I'll start from my perspective as a kid.

1340
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:30,360
This is a place that opened in, well, eventually opened in 1982.

1341
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:39,360
We can get into sort of that whole thing, but it was called Arnie's Place in Westport, Connecticut, which is a couple of towns over from where I grew up.

1342
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:43,360
And apparently it was much more controversial than I knew.

1343
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:53,360
But by the time I was, you know, paying attention and going to the place when I was probably 1990 or so, you know, it closed in 94.

1344
01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:57,360
But it was just a, it was a freestanding building that was an arcade.

1345
01:00:57,360 --> 01:01:04,360
It had a, now it's like a, it became an anthropology after Arnie's closed, I believe.

1346
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:06,360
And now I think it's an Ulta.

1347
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:19,360
But they took off this, there was like this weird, I want to remember it as being either brown or like a dark purple, kind of like a very dark, you know, purple, kind of like, you know, maybe a little tinged, like almost like a rubber skin.

1348
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:22,360
Like that was like the facade of the building.

1349
01:01:22,360 --> 01:01:24,360
I don't know how else to explain it.

1350
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:30,360
Like it was coated in something almost kind of like think like, like Legos, but not with his raised circles.

1351
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:32,360
You know, does that make sense?

1352
01:01:32,360 --> 01:01:36,360
But it looks like it looks like a toy type building.

1353
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:37,360
That's that's really crazy.

1354
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:39,360
But they were they were small.

1355
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:40,360
They were like quarter sized.

1356
01:01:40,360 --> 01:01:41,360
I'm trying.

1357
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:44,360
I'm trying to like, like, but so it was anyway, it was very like distinctive.

1358
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:48,360
Like it wasn't like in a mall is what I'm saying, because like, you know, it was like its own.

1359
01:01:48,360 --> 01:01:51,360
This guy built this place and it was built by this guy named Arnie K.

1360
01:01:51,360 --> 01:01:55,360
It had, you know, arcade machines.

1361
01:01:55,360 --> 01:02:00,360
It had pool tables, I guess.

1362
01:02:00,360 --> 01:02:10,360
It had also like a little ice cream parlor off to the side, which had a little very weird animatronic little performance thing called George.

1363
01:02:10,360 --> 01:02:13,360
The ice cream place is called Georgie Porgy's.

1364
01:02:13,360 --> 01:02:15,360
How far is this from your house?

1365
01:02:15,360 --> 01:02:19,360
You have an animatronic show this this close to you.

1366
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:22,360
What's that? You have an animatronic show this close to where you live.

1367
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:24,360
That's that's incredible. Well, I did.

1368
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:29,360
I did. Yeah. And then and I'm trying to think what else there was.

1369
01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:31,360
I think there was some kind of food.

1370
01:02:31,360 --> 01:02:38,360
I don't I don't think there was like a well, there was a there was a deli is what I found, which will also be the specters.

1371
01:02:38,360 --> 01:02:45,360
Yeah, there was a yeah, there was a deli and that later became I think I think the deli was like it was not it was on it was like next door.

1372
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:49,360
It wasn't like part of the same building, I don't think.

1373
01:02:49,360 --> 01:02:54,360
But I think it became like a ball, do cheese, which is like a higher end kind of Italian marketplace.

1374
01:02:54,360 --> 01:02:57,360
That's like a chain up around here.

1375
01:02:57,360 --> 01:03:02,360
So that's yeah, that's there's a lot of details, obviously, but that's the general.

1376
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:09,360
And that's where they had their own their own tokens, like custom tokens, which I thought was very high end considering.

1377
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:11,360
It's just one establishment. Yeah, yeah.

1378
01:03:11,360 --> 01:03:15,360
You know, Chuck E. Cheese will have them. But these are these are for Arnie's place only.

1379
01:03:15,360 --> 01:03:19,360
It's great. Right. And like, I mean, even like and they were metal.

1380
01:03:19,360 --> 01:03:23,360
They were like subway tokens. Like that's kind of what they almost look like.

1381
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:29,360
As opposed to like a you go to like, was it Fun Spot? Right.

1382
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:32,360
Don't they have wood? They have metal ones there. I guess they have metal ones there.

1383
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:37,360
Never mind. The place in New Hampshire where the King of Kong. Oh, right. Oh, that's right.

1384
01:03:37,360 --> 01:03:43,360
Yeah. Yeah. I've been there a couple of times because I have friends who have like a, you know, lake house kind of nearby.

1385
01:03:43,360 --> 01:03:52,360
So I made it a point to go there and take the picture framed like that awful toady guy who like is like Billy Mitchell's number two.

1386
01:03:52,360 --> 01:03:56,360
That guy like the kill screen coming out of the. We got a kill screen coming.

1387
01:03:56,360 --> 01:04:01,360
So I tried to like frame a shot like the, you know, where his talking heads are.

1388
01:04:01,360 --> 01:04:04,360
There's like a door right by the machine. They haven't moved the machine anyway.

1389
01:04:04,360 --> 01:04:10,360
That's a place, by the way. I'm curious. You haven't been there because that seems to me like I forgot where that was.

1390
01:04:10,360 --> 01:04:16,360
But I remember watching the documentary thinking like, well, this is like the casinos that you go into where you're not supposed to be having fun.

1391
01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:21,360
Like sometimes you walk into a casino and like the vibe is not good. I need to leave.

1392
01:04:21,360 --> 01:04:25,360
These are all people playing hardcore. They are.

1393
01:04:25,360 --> 01:04:29,360
They have they're glaring at me because an outsider has come in.

1394
01:04:29,360 --> 01:04:31,360
I need to get the fuck out of here. That's always the vibe.

1395
01:04:31,360 --> 01:04:39,360
I assumed Fun Spot would have just given the like insane nature of everybody and the very competitive nature of everybody in King of Kong.

1396
01:04:39,360 --> 01:04:43,360
But is that is that true, though? Is it is it is it fun and fun spot?

1397
01:04:43,360 --> 01:04:48,360
Yeah, I would say I mean, it's a little bit color by the fact that it was like summer of twenty twenty one is when we went.

1398
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:54,360
So it was like, oh, my God, like that was the same weekend I went to the movies for the first time in like, you know, a year and a half or whatever.

1399
01:04:54,360 --> 01:04:57,360
So I'm probably but I mean, it was there.

1400
01:04:57,360 --> 01:05:04,360
I think probably when they have that tournament or whatever, if you're anywhere near the Donkey Kong machine, you're not supposed to be having any fun.

1401
01:05:04,360 --> 01:05:07,360
But it's a lot of kids. They have a lot of stuff.

1402
01:05:07,360 --> 01:05:17,360
They have those really old machines where like you're just like there's like lights that are moving and you're just trying to hit a button when they're on the middle like the really old like trying to time things, you know.

1403
01:05:17,360 --> 01:05:23,360
And then you exchange your tickets for spider rings or the classic all those classic kind of toys.

1404
01:05:23,360 --> 01:05:26,360
All that stuff or like a joy buzzer. You know, it's kind of old timey.

1405
01:05:26,360 --> 01:05:30,360
But at the same time, yeah, it's it's I would recommend it's a good place.

1406
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:32,360
Huge. Also, which is just kind of fun.

1407
01:05:32,360 --> 01:05:37,360
I think it's a good place to have like every kind of old arcade machine in that in that in that hall where Donkey Kong is.

1408
01:05:37,360 --> 01:05:43,360
Here's the question before we return to Arnie's maybe to touch on briefly prizes.

1409
01:05:43,360 --> 01:05:47,360
What are prizes that you want today? What are prizes that you wanted then?

1410
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:50,360
What's everybody's prize taste?

1411
01:05:50,360 --> 01:06:01,360
I a lot of the ones that I talked about weren't really prize centric or if they were, I didn't really occasionally I think time out had a small prize counter.

1412
01:06:01,360 --> 01:06:05,360
I think I was going to play like video games, not like ticket games.

1413
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:09,360
Oh, sure. OK. Oh, so you were kind of out. You were not necessarily racking up a ton for.

1414
01:06:09,360 --> 01:06:22,360
Yeah, I mean, I often with my family and then like around like 12 or 13, if I'd go to the mall with friends, we'd like stop in the arcade between like the comic store and the pizza place.

1415
01:06:22,360 --> 01:06:29,360
You know, but then they all pretty quickly shut down by the time I got in my mid to later teens.

1416
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:32,360
You know, Mike, prices plush.

1417
01:06:32,360 --> 01:06:33,360
Oh, OK. Sure, sure.

1418
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:37,360
I needed plush and as much of it as I could get.

1419
01:06:37,360 --> 01:06:43,360
And if it was I didn't have a Chuck E. Cheese plush, but I think they had like a decent size one and I never got it.

1420
01:06:43,360 --> 01:06:48,360
But if I was looking for like a stuffed animal or a toy, but they had more.

1421
01:06:48,360 --> 01:06:53,360
I feel like they usually had more like plush than they did some sort of good action figure driver.

1422
01:06:53,360 --> 01:06:55,360
Right. Yeah. Patrick price.

1423
01:06:55,360 --> 01:06:58,360
The shittiest little stuffed animal that you've ever seen in your life.

1424
01:06:58,360 --> 01:07:01,360
Basically, that's like and that's for 10,000.

1425
01:07:01,360 --> 01:07:04,360
Yeah, that's impossible to get.

1426
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:07,360
Yeah, I'll just give you money. I'll give you 100 US dollars.

1427
01:07:07,360 --> 01:07:16,360
Right. No, something it should cost to the I don't think if there was any kind of price situation, I don't remember.

1428
01:07:16,360 --> 01:07:19,360
It probably was crooked in some way, I would guess.

1429
01:07:20,360 --> 01:07:25,360
But Discovery Zone, I was a big ticket collector for sure.

1430
01:07:25,360 --> 01:07:27,360
You know, skeeball and all that.

1431
01:07:27,360 --> 01:07:30,360
Probably Big Bertha. I don't know if you got tickets or worth it.

1432
01:07:30,360 --> 01:07:33,360
I assume probably a ticket one.

1433
01:07:33,360 --> 01:07:34,360
I'm trying to think of what I would have wanted, though.

1434
01:07:34,360 --> 01:07:45,360
There was always some I don't know what are those like dumb like like, you know, they're like a kaleidoscope thing where it's like it's like a yeah, it's like crystal on one end.

1435
01:07:45,360 --> 01:07:46,360
And it's kind of shaped like a funnel.

1436
01:07:46,360 --> 01:07:51,360
And you're and you look into the narrow end and it's like that's about the best you could do.

1437
01:07:51,360 --> 01:07:53,360
I feel like like a like a like a cheap version of that.

1438
01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:55,360
I never really collected a ton of prize tickets.

1439
01:07:55,360 --> 01:07:59,360
So little to right. Yeah.

1440
01:07:59,360 --> 01:08:03,360
My just spider. I mean, spider rings always welcome, you know, black or orange.

1441
01:08:03,360 --> 01:08:05,360
Oh, sure. Yeah.

1442
01:08:05,360 --> 01:08:07,360
And think about my favorite arcade memories.

1443
01:08:07,360 --> 01:08:13,360
I like, you know, I had plenty that I went to growing up that I like, but there were not a lot of stories necessarily.

1444
01:08:13,360 --> 01:08:21,360
But my favorite time ever at an arcade was when I was on a Funny or Die shoot that was in Oklahoma City.

1445
01:08:21,360 --> 01:08:27,360
It was a shoot that involved me acting as a massage therapist to Kevin Durant and James Harden.

1446
01:08:27,360 --> 01:08:32,360
OK, so that was an odd experience I got to have while Kate Upton looked on.

1447
01:08:32,360 --> 01:08:34,360
This was a star study.

1448
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:40,360
These were the glory days of of branded Web content for headphone brands.

1449
01:08:40,360 --> 01:08:50,360
But a whole group of people was in Oklahoma City and we had time to kill one day and we passed by a mall on the side of the freeway like, oh, that's what we're doing.

1450
01:08:50,360 --> 01:08:54,360
We're going there. We went to the Quail Springs Mall and we had the most wonderful time.

1451
01:08:54,360 --> 01:08:57,360
It must have been a tilt. I think it was probably a tilt.

1452
01:08:57,360 --> 01:09:03,360
And we played the deal or no deal game, which is a good one.

1453
01:09:03,360 --> 01:09:04,360
I recommend that in general.

1454
01:09:04,360 --> 01:09:08,360
You can like get a couple rounds of action on it, even if you end up losing.

1455
01:09:09,360 --> 01:09:15,360
It's one of the like roulette or something where like, well, it's at least fun even if you sure just eat it.

1456
01:09:15,360 --> 01:09:21,360
But but this this brain trust of five folks involved Andrew Grissom and Matt Mazzani.

1457
01:09:21,360 --> 01:09:23,360
You've been on the show and other friends of the show.

1458
01:09:23,360 --> 01:09:28,360
Buzz Buzz. We all got the full hundred in deal as well.

1459
01:09:28,360 --> 01:09:33,360
She said Kate come as well or she Kate Upton was with you.

1460
01:09:33,360 --> 01:09:43,360
Oh, no, Kate, Kevin and James did seem to be they did seem to have no interest in associating with us as soon as they were.

1461
01:09:43,360 --> 01:09:47,360
Some of those people trying to leave the shoot while it was occurring.

1462
01:09:47,360 --> 01:09:52,360
And I was demanded to go dance around like a clown to get them to stop.

1463
01:09:52,360 --> 01:09:55,360
What? Yes, that is something that happens.

1464
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:57,360
Like, yeah, here's all the story.

1465
01:09:57,360 --> 01:10:00,360
The yeah, I was just brought on to this thing is like, I don't know, maybe we'll throw you in there.

1466
01:10:00,360 --> 01:10:01,360
We'll give you a part or something.

1467
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:03,360
You're like an on set writer or something.

1468
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:07,360
And the basketball players wanted to leave.

1469
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:09,360
They've been there for an hour and a half.

1470
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:12,360
And they're like, this is longer than anything should ever take.

1471
01:10:12,360 --> 01:10:19,360
But they also heard one of them on the lav mics say like, like, hey, that that dude's pretty funny.

1472
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:22,360
And I like it. So like that's some inside information.

1473
01:10:22,360 --> 01:10:24,360
Like, maybe that's a way. And they said, just go entertain him.

1474
01:10:24,360 --> 01:10:29,360
Go. And I literally had been walked up to these very famous basketball players.

1475
01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:35,360
Just like, hey, what's I just like I just like acted like I mean, they were much younger than me.

1476
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:43,360
Also, which is hard to think about when they are they are giants and sure.

1477
01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:46,360
Those multimillionaires. Does anyone have eyes on Kevin Durant?

1478
01:10:46,360 --> 01:10:48,360
Yeah, I know we were all taking lunch.

1479
01:10:48,360 --> 01:10:51,360
He said he was heading to the airport.

1480
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:55,360
Does anyone know what that did at your dancing work?

1481
01:10:55,360 --> 01:10:57,360
It did. It did keep him around. We finished.

1482
01:10:57,360 --> 01:11:00,360
Technically, there were like all the shots were completed.

1483
01:11:00,360 --> 01:11:07,360
Yeah, I did just like a goof around as like I was a babysitter to Kevin Durant in Oklahoma.

1484
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:09,360
This was a this was an odd thing.

1485
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:11,360
And did you talk ever again after that?

1486
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:16,360
The relation I mean, I should hit him up again.

1487
01:11:16,360 --> 01:11:19,360
But I think he'll have such fond memories of that day.

1488
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:24,360
Member Oklahoma City. He's probably been, you know, probably been lonely.

1489
01:11:24,360 --> 01:11:27,360
Like, sure, he's successful, but does he have this on?

1490
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:29,360
He misses true innocent fun.

1491
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:31,360
Do you have any thoughts on like the Matterhorn or something?

1492
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:33,360
He could do the show.

1493
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:35,360
You know, I'll try to get all of him.

1494
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:38,360
But I think it's just like literally you'd have too much space in the room.

1495
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:40,360
Right. I think you guys would have to.

1496
01:11:40,360 --> 01:11:41,360
That's true. You're the tall one.

1497
01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:44,360
So he's going to replace you. That's true.

1498
01:11:44,360 --> 01:11:46,360
You probably get a reply on Twitter, at least. Right.

1499
01:11:46,360 --> 01:11:47,360
He's pretty active on there.

1500
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:49,360
I'll send a nice screenshot of memory.

1501
01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:53,360
I remember the funny massage scene you were in for 15 minutes.

1502
01:11:55,360 --> 01:11:58,360
Hey, Jason, I'll pick the two of us thinking of you.

1503
01:11:58,360 --> 01:12:00,360
Yeah, I'm thinking of you, Kev.

1504
01:12:00,360 --> 01:12:09,360
Anyway, the point is in Oklahoma City, the victory, the victory like the thunder had when we saw them the night before,

1505
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:12,360
we had a victory of 100 tickets in Deal or No Deal.

1506
01:12:12,360 --> 01:12:17,360
And the game was right at the like we basically like fed the tickets out into the mall.

1507
01:12:17,360 --> 01:12:19,360
Like it was right at the door. Right. Right.

1508
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:20,360
Just like kept going into the concourse.

1509
01:12:20,360 --> 01:12:26,360
And I bring all this up to say having 100 tickets and then a group of dudes was so fun, like, OK, let's put our heads together.

1510
01:12:26,360 --> 01:12:28,360
What are the ultimate prizes that we want to do here?

1511
01:12:28,360 --> 01:12:30,360
And I recommend these to anybody.

1512
01:12:30,360 --> 01:12:32,360
Little parachute guys. Oh, yeah.

1513
01:12:32,360 --> 01:12:40,360
Which we threw off the third level into the court and donated them to some to some local 10 year olds.

1514
01:12:40,360 --> 01:12:43,360
And then this is a really good prize.

1515
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:48,360
Whether you have kids or you're a 30 something hillbilly teeth.

1516
01:12:48,360 --> 01:12:50,360
Do we have this picture, Jordan?

1517
01:12:50,360 --> 01:12:54,360
Here's me in the Oklahoma City Disney store with.

1518
01:12:54,360 --> 01:12:56,360
Yeah. Wow.

1519
01:12:56,360 --> 01:12:58,360
That I'm so happy here.

1520
01:12:58,360 --> 01:13:03,360
We invented a whole we were we invented a whole lineup of characters called the Hokels.

1521
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:06,360
OK, we had a whole mythology, yes, with our hillbilly teeth.

1522
01:13:07,360 --> 01:13:12,360
Hokels, I guess, you know, sort of like yokel, but with Hokem added to it.

1523
01:13:12,360 --> 01:13:17,360
And it was just like, you know, now the governor of New York, Kathy, one of your classic.

1524
01:13:20,360 --> 01:13:23,360
Anyway, just fun, fun memories of my Hokel days.

1525
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:27,360
You want me to bust out a little Hokel, I'd be I'd be happy to hear some.

1526
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:32,360
What the what the heck is all this is equipment in front of me here?

1527
01:13:32,360 --> 01:13:35,360
I don't know about this big city equipment.

1528
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:37,360
I'm just a huckle.

1529
01:13:37,360 --> 01:13:39,360
I'm nothing but a huckle.

1530
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:42,360
Have you written the Hokels into any sort of script?

1531
01:13:42,360 --> 01:13:45,360
No, I've thought maybe is that like a juncture?

1532
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:48,360
Like, was that a sign at the time that Hokel should have?

1533
01:13:48,360 --> 01:13:50,360
Yes. Been a show that we try with.

1534
01:13:50,360 --> 01:13:53,360
This could be a whole different universe if we just had done it.

1535
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:58,360
You know, the Hokels causes Peacock to lose yet another billion dollars.

1536
01:13:58,360 --> 01:14:03,360
So we're all Peacock is all in on the Hokel.

1537
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:05,360
This had better work.

1538
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:10,360
It's kind of like Yellowstone, but silly, but all silly like it's called Hokel.

1539
01:14:10,360 --> 01:14:16,360
After an abbreviated first season, poker face canceled due to money being diverted to the Hokel.

1540
01:14:19,360 --> 01:14:23,360
If only poker face was as fun as us, the Hokels.

1541
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:25,360
I still have the teeth.

1542
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:27,360
I still have the teeth.

1543
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:30,360
I use them as a Christmas ornament each year.

1544
01:14:30,360 --> 01:14:34,360
So, you know, that's a budget right there.

1545
01:14:34,360 --> 01:14:36,360
We're already four dollars ahead.

1546
01:14:36,360 --> 01:14:38,360
We do already have the teeth.

1547
01:14:38,360 --> 01:14:39,360
Great.

1548
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:40,360
Yeah, yeah.

1549
01:14:40,360 --> 01:14:42,360
I'll get pitching soon.

1550
01:14:42,360 --> 01:14:47,360
Anyway, I just recommend those as prizes if you get the chance.

1551
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:48,360
Here's Arnie's place.

1552
01:14:48,360 --> 01:14:49,360
Oh, great.

1553
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:50,360
Oh, I didn't know we had this photo.

1554
01:14:50,360 --> 01:14:51,360
Oh, great, great, great.

1555
01:14:51,360 --> 01:14:52,360
Oh, wait.

1556
01:14:52,360 --> 01:14:53,360
You can kind of see.

1557
01:14:53,360 --> 01:14:54,360
Yeah.

1558
01:14:54,360 --> 01:14:59,360
Wait, this weird brown texture that's kind of bumpy.

1559
01:14:59,360 --> 01:15:00,360
It's brown and bumpy.

1560
01:15:00,360 --> 01:15:01,360
Interesting.

1561
01:15:01,360 --> 01:15:04,360
You know how you like buildings to be.

1562
01:15:04,360 --> 01:15:07,360
I mean, it does look like a building that you want to hug.

1563
01:15:07,360 --> 01:15:10,360
It's like it's a big, soft, foamy building.

1564
01:15:10,360 --> 01:15:11,360
That's nice.

1565
01:15:11,360 --> 01:15:13,360
It has like a token cut out of the wall, kind of.

1566
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:22,360
It's got like this like two like semicircle windows above and below the Arnie's place logo.

1567
01:15:22,360 --> 01:15:24,360
A big space in between Arnie's in place.

1568
01:15:24,360 --> 01:15:31,360
Not sure what the decision there on the font was, but just give give kids a break from reading.

1569
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:33,360
You read one word and take a breather.

1570
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:34,360
You read the next.

1571
01:15:34,360 --> 01:15:35,360
Yeah, you read all day.

1572
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:36,360
You know, you come in here.

1573
01:15:36,360 --> 01:15:37,360
You don't have to read in here.

1574
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:38,360
That's what you did in school.

1575
01:15:38,360 --> 01:15:40,360
Oh, and look at this interior of.

1576
01:15:40,360 --> 01:15:41,360
Oh, my God.

1577
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:42,360
Like this is really straight.

1578
01:15:42,360 --> 01:15:43,360
Yeah, this is so glorious.

1579
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:44,360
It's like, I don't know.

1580
01:15:44,360 --> 01:15:51,360
Can you describe this to like every game is in this glorious like Goldenwood.

1581
01:15:51,360 --> 01:15:53,360
Liberace's bedroom is an arcade.

1582
01:15:53,360 --> 01:15:56,360
Yes, just big round.

1583
01:15:56,360 --> 01:15:58,360
It's like incredible woodwork.

1584
01:15:58,360 --> 01:16:02,360
This is this is like this is a top shelf arcade for sure.

1585
01:16:02,360 --> 01:16:07,360
Every game has its own slot, its own peep show like privacy.

1586
01:16:07,360 --> 01:16:08,360
Yeah, yeah, that's true.

1587
01:16:08,360 --> 01:16:10,360
It's like a urinal with dividers.

1588
01:16:10,360 --> 01:16:13,360
It's very strip clubby in retrospect.

1589
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:18,360
That's something I obviously did not cotton to when I was a kid, but it is very much.

1590
01:16:18,360 --> 01:16:19,360
Yeah, it's me.

1591
01:16:19,360 --> 01:16:21,360
It's mirrored ceilings essentially right.

1592
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:22,360
The Bracci's bedroom.

1593
01:16:22,360 --> 01:16:23,360
Oh, sure.

1594
01:16:23,360 --> 01:16:24,360
Yeah.

1595
01:16:24,360 --> 01:16:30,360
But so the things that why are why are we talking about Arnie's place in general?

1596
01:16:30,360 --> 01:16:32,360
What is the big why have I built up Arnie's place?

1597
01:16:32,360 --> 01:16:36,360
And I think it's because I looked into this owner, Arnie K.

1598
01:16:36,360 --> 01:16:39,360
And Arnie K. was out of his mind.

1599
01:16:39,360 --> 01:16:41,360
This guy was nuts.

1600
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:48,360
I as alluded to earlier, I could not believe how much literature there was about Connecticut arcade.

1601
01:16:48,360 --> 01:16:58,360
Connecticut arcade owner Arnie K, which which Patrick, you and our DMS alluded to a little bit like you had you had like the legends from your parents of Arnie Lord.

1602
01:16:58,360 --> 01:17:01,360
You recall anything in particular?

1603
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:03,360
Yeah, I mean, there was something about him.

1604
01:17:03,360 --> 01:17:11,360
I remember being told he like chained himself to City Hall or something because because they were like the town didn't want it to open.

1605
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:23,360
Like there was like a neighborhood or town association or something that like opposed the arcade opening because and this is all very quaint in retrospect, you know, but like it was 1982 and 1981.

1606
01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:27,360
I guess this was taking place and it was like it's going to be a hangout for teens.

1607
01:17:27,360 --> 01:17:31,360
They're going to smoke and play addictive video games and et cetera.

1608
01:17:31,360 --> 01:17:36,360
You know, they should go to the YMCA or, you know, school groups or church.

1609
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:41,360
You know, it's not very convincing in retrospect, listening to listening to whoever the opposition was.

1610
01:17:41,360 --> 01:17:47,360
But yeah, as part of that, I think he chained himself to Westport City Hall or Town Hall.

1611
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:51,360
And there's a bunch of other stunts that he obviously did or threatened to do.

1612
01:17:51,360 --> 01:17:53,360
Let's pull up a picture of him.

1613
01:17:53,360 --> 01:17:56,360
This is Arnie K. as in the New York Times.

1614
01:17:56,360 --> 01:18:01,360
The New York Times covered this local arcade drama an astounding amount of times.

1615
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:12,360
I got a subscription so that I could read, not keep up with current events, but look up 1984 articles about arcade drama for the listener.

1616
01:18:12,360 --> 01:18:15,360
Well, here I am reading this from the newspaper.

1617
01:18:15,360 --> 01:18:21,360
Some were described him as a hulk of a man, probably around 350 pounds.

1618
01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:24,360
And it was his dream to build a video arcade.

1619
01:18:24,360 --> 01:18:30,360
He was the heir to a pinball fortune, which now after what Jason said at the beginning, a lot of color.

1620
01:18:30,360 --> 01:18:32,360
OK, all right. Yeah.

1621
01:18:32,360 --> 01:18:42,360
And I hate to profile off of his physical appearance, but you know, there's look, he's he's got a Paul Sorvino certainly has a Paul Sorvino thing going on.

1622
01:18:42,360 --> 01:18:45,360
So what does pinball fortune mean?

1623
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:46,360
I don't know.

1624
01:18:46,360 --> 01:18:50,360
He he was so he's very, very wealthy.

1625
01:18:51,360 --> 01:19:03,360
He lived in Connecticut in a house previously owned by a Gershwin, like George Gershwin's sister, Francis, who was married to the inventor of Kodachrome photography.

1626
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:05,360
So that's who had those before.

1627
01:19:05,360 --> 01:19:08,360
And then pinball heir Arnie K.

1628
01:19:08,360 --> 01:19:11,360
So this is like clearly a very nice estate.

1629
01:19:11,360 --> 01:19:13,360
And he really anybody wanted to give back.

1630
01:19:13,360 --> 01:19:17,360
He wanted to give Connecticut kids like you some fun.

1631
01:19:17,360 --> 01:19:25,360
But he ran afoul of something called the Greens Farms Association, who said, we don't want our town to become a city.

1632
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:27,360
That's what.

1633
01:19:27,360 --> 01:19:29,360
Oh, yes, I see what you mean.

1634
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:30,360
Oh, the so city life.

1635
01:19:30,360 --> 01:19:32,360
But we are but a quaint town.

1636
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:42,360
But he in in starting this arcade, he's like, this is not going to be, you know, just some scuzzy kid hang out.

1637
01:19:42,360 --> 01:19:45,360
This is going to be, you know, a classy top shelf place.

1638
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:48,360
We're going to have attendance in blazers.

1639
01:19:48,360 --> 01:19:50,360
Everyone who works here will be in a blazer.

1640
01:19:50,360 --> 01:19:56,360
And I know that everyone in the town is worried about kids skipping school to go to the arcade.

1641
01:19:56,360 --> 01:20:07,360
And that's why our three uniformed attendants will be on duty and they will all have copies of all the school calendars in a 25 mile radius in their pockets.

1642
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:13,360
And so if a young person unaccompanied by an adult enters, we ask them no school today.

1643
01:20:13,360 --> 01:20:15,360
And then it's weird.

1644
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:20,360
They said no school today while making this like a pay up.

1645
01:20:20,360 --> 01:20:23,360
Oh, oh, there's no school.

1646
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:33,360
I hear there's no school if you can like scratch the scratch, you know, well, Arnie did his training and then he did his off the books training.

1647
01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:35,360
Yeah, that's not everyone the gestures.

1648
01:20:35,360 --> 01:20:39,360
So anyway, so look, we can we're cross checking the calendars.

1649
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:44,360
We have a PA system to announce the names of children called home for dinner.

1650
01:20:44,360 --> 01:20:49,360
Imagine the embarrassment of Patrick.

1651
01:20:49,360 --> 01:20:58,360
This is how I thought everywhere was all the time, actually, when I was a kid, I thought everyone would know if I ever did something wrong or like knew what like they knew my name.

1652
01:20:58,360 --> 01:20:59,360
They knew who my parents were.

1653
01:20:59,360 --> 01:21:02,360
So I never decided to do anything bad.

1654
01:21:02,360 --> 01:21:05,360
Michael Carlson stopped playing the turtles game.

1655
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:06,360
Right.

1656
01:21:06,360 --> 01:21:11,360
The arcade should know he got a B plus on a recent social studies test.

1657
01:21:11,360 --> 01:21:12,360
That's right.

1658
01:21:13,360 --> 01:21:17,360
Oh, I was going to say as a kid, Mike's motto was call me whatever you want.

1659
01:21:17,360 --> 01:21:21,360
Just don't call me late for dinner.

1660
01:21:21,360 --> 01:21:24,360
Well, that's that's true.

1661
01:21:24,360 --> 01:21:25,360
Be on your tombstone.

1662
01:21:25,360 --> 01:21:29,360
You that I mean, it's something very quaint about the idea.

1663
01:21:29,360 --> 01:21:30,360
You've been called home for dinner.

1664
01:21:30,360 --> 01:21:34,360
It's like, well, unless your mom is outside in the Volvo, like this is not Little House on the Prairie.

1665
01:21:34,360 --> 01:21:38,360
Like this is on a this is on the post road in Westport.

1666
01:21:38,360 --> 01:21:41,360
It's like a road that everyone goes like 40 on.

1667
01:21:41,360 --> 01:21:43,360
There's car dealership across the street.

1668
01:21:43,360 --> 01:21:47,360
You know what I mean? It's not a this is not like a walk home type, you know, area.

1669
01:21:47,360 --> 01:21:53,360
So just from a purely from a distance perspective, forgetting about, you know, being on the side of like a main road.

1670
01:21:53,360 --> 01:21:54,360
So, yeah, mom's outside.

1671
01:21:54,360 --> 01:21:58,360
So I guess I guess if that's what's being called home for dinner is then sure.

1672
01:21:58,360 --> 01:22:04,360
The security guards didn't have like some sort of giant index of like, OK, little Billy's dinner is at six thirty.

1673
01:22:04,360 --> 01:22:07,360
Little Sally's is at seven forty five.

1674
01:22:07,360 --> 01:22:09,360
Mom gets home late.

1675
01:22:09,360 --> 01:22:13,360
We're going to be consulting with all the local children's meal calendar.

1676
01:22:13,360 --> 01:22:15,360
Right. You got to submit.

1677
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:16,360
You go you go door to door.

1678
01:22:16,360 --> 01:22:23,360
Part of the census in the town was to give the meal calendar out to let everyone know when meals happen in the family.

1679
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:25,360
Talking five thirty six.

1680
01:22:25,360 --> 01:22:26,360
And then what do you do?

1681
01:22:26,360 --> 01:22:27,360
Do you like a steak night?

1682
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:30,360
Do you like like Mexican tacos?

1683
01:22:30,360 --> 01:22:34,360
Preparation of the meal take is going to go into account when we're calling your kids.

1684
01:22:34,360 --> 01:22:36,360
So you got to tell us what is taco night?

1685
01:22:36,360 --> 01:22:37,360
Is it Tuesday?

1686
01:22:37,360 --> 01:22:38,360
Is it Tuesday?

1687
01:22:38,360 --> 01:22:39,360
You're making a roast.

1688
01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:40,360
Is it going to take longer?

1689
01:22:40,360 --> 01:22:47,360
Yeah, because we got to have a grace 15 to 30 minute grace period depending on how hot your oven cooks.

1690
01:22:47,360 --> 01:22:51,360
You give us your amperage.

1691
01:22:51,360 --> 01:22:55,360
So oh, and then and then one more thing, because he's looking at Arnie is trying all that he can.

1692
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:57,360
He's ingratiating himself to the town.

1693
01:22:57,360 --> 01:22:59,360
I want to get this arcade built.

1694
01:22:59,360 --> 01:23:01,360
I'm going to have the school calendars.

1695
01:23:01,360 --> 01:23:03,360
And you're worried about kids sneaking out of high school.

1696
01:23:03,360 --> 01:23:05,360
I'll build a gate.

1697
01:23:05,360 --> 01:23:06,360
The thing he offered.

1698
01:23:06,360 --> 01:23:08,360
I will build a gate.

1699
01:23:08,360 --> 01:23:09,360
This is Trump's plan.

1700
01:23:09,360 --> 01:23:10,360
Yeah, I know how to stop.

1701
01:23:10,360 --> 01:23:18,360
What if we just build a very high wall that will stop high school miscreants?

1702
01:23:18,360 --> 01:23:21,360
But anyways, the city still will not budge.

1703
01:23:21,360 --> 01:23:24,360
We will not open this place.

1704
01:23:24,360 --> 01:23:26,360
We just and we aren't zoned for it.

1705
01:23:26,360 --> 01:23:28,360
Frankly, we don't want an arcade in our town.

1706
01:23:28,360 --> 01:23:31,360
So Arnie started going apeshit.

1707
01:23:31,360 --> 01:23:33,360
He called the he called the rules unconstitutional.

1708
01:23:33,360 --> 01:23:37,360
He called the opponents of of his plans snobs and racists.

1709
01:23:37,360 --> 01:23:38,360
Wow.

1710
01:23:38,360 --> 01:23:40,360
Not sure where racism enters the picture.

1711
01:23:40,360 --> 01:23:43,360
Arnie K seems like a white fella.

1712
01:23:43,360 --> 01:23:48,360
Anyway, then he, as you said, chained himself to town hall.

1713
01:23:48,360 --> 01:23:59,360
Then then he had a guy dressed as Pac Man hand out fifty dollar bills to anyone wearing an I support Arnie's place shirt.

1714
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:03,360
This goes all the way up and up to the Connecticut Supreme Court.

1715
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:06,360
And then finally, dream achieved.

1716
01:24:06,360 --> 01:24:07,360
It is opening.

1717
01:24:07,360 --> 01:24:08,360
Great.

1718
01:24:08,360 --> 01:24:10,360
Arnie's place is open for business.

1719
01:24:10,360 --> 01:24:12,360
Three weeks later, it is closed.

1720
01:24:12,360 --> 01:24:18,360
A judge orders it closed again because it had something to do with zoning.

1721
01:24:18,360 --> 01:24:20,360
We're like, OK, well, let you do this.

1722
01:24:20,360 --> 01:24:23,360
But Max 50 games, he put in 80 games.

1723
01:24:24,360 --> 01:24:32,360
So now he's like going back and forth with them like, OK, what if all right, I'm going to have seventy five games.

1724
01:24:32,360 --> 01:24:34,360
And so a lot of them are just backups.

1725
01:24:34,360 --> 01:24:36,360
So it's only if the other games go down.

1726
01:24:36,360 --> 01:24:38,360
But then, of course, he's just running all the games at once.

1727
01:24:38,360 --> 01:24:41,360
So he's this is immediately shut down.

1728
01:24:41,360 --> 01:24:43,360
How this place is such a firestorm.

1729
01:24:43,360 --> 01:24:44,360
I don't know.

1730
01:24:44,360 --> 01:24:47,360
But Arnie thinks about other angles.

1731
01:24:47,360 --> 01:24:50,360
What else can we do to keep my place open?

1732
01:24:50,360 --> 01:24:59,360
And he realized, wait a minute, the the city's not OK with arcades, but I've checked the Constitution and they say nothing about porno theaters.

1733
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:01,360
So here's what I'm going to do.

1734
01:25:01,360 --> 01:25:05,360
There's this this is city councilman William Siden.

1735
01:25:05,360 --> 01:25:08,360
And he has a bug up his butt about my arcade.

1736
01:25:08,360 --> 01:25:13,360
What if I open a porno theater called the William Siden Pornography Theater?

1737
01:25:13,360 --> 01:25:23,360
He's opening a spiked porno theater that he doesn't even want to open, named after a local politician.

1738
01:25:23,360 --> 01:25:27,360
That is one of the canniest moves I've ever heard of.

1739
01:25:27,360 --> 01:25:34,360
If you don't let me open my business, I will open a porno theater and name it after you.

1740
01:25:34,360 --> 01:25:38,360
So this idea is he didn't copyright it.

1741
01:25:39,360 --> 01:25:41,360
Anybody can do this.

1742
01:25:41,360 --> 01:25:46,360
If there's listeners who are trying to, yeah, restaurant, a cafe, a laundromat, anything.

1743
01:25:46,360 --> 01:25:47,360
Yeah, yeah.

1744
01:25:47,360 --> 01:25:49,360
Just start start doing this for fun.

1745
01:25:49,360 --> 01:25:58,360
I do wonder if the initial like scapegoating of this place of like this place going to be trouble was by a traveling boys band.

1746
01:25:58,360 --> 01:26:05,360
Connard is salesman because it sounds very close to the set up of the music band where he's like, you have a pool hall.

1747
01:26:05,360 --> 01:26:06,360
It's a real life music.

1748
01:26:06,360 --> 01:26:10,360
They're playing the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

1749
01:26:10,360 --> 01:26:13,360
Is that what you want your children?

1750
01:26:13,360 --> 01:26:17,360
You want them experimenting with ooze at home with their pets?

1751
01:26:17,360 --> 01:26:18,360
That's the only place this could lead.

1752
01:26:18,360 --> 01:26:23,360
You want them to know martial arts and the art of being seen and not seen?

1753
01:26:23,360 --> 01:26:25,360
You're not going to be able to call them home for dinner.

1754
01:26:25,360 --> 01:26:27,360
You can't even see them at plain sight.

1755
01:26:27,360 --> 01:26:29,360
Now do that in a little bit more of a musical way.

1756
01:26:29,360 --> 01:26:31,360
You're not going to be able to call them home for dinner.

1757
01:26:31,360 --> 01:26:34,360
These kids are becoming lethal enforcers.

1758
01:26:34,360 --> 01:26:36,360
They're trying to stage a revolution.

1759
01:26:36,360 --> 01:26:37,360
They're living in the sewers.

1760
01:26:37,360 --> 01:26:39,360
They're sleeping on the sewer floor.

1761
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:41,360
They're going to start a revolution X.

1762
01:26:41,360 --> 01:26:44,360
They're not looking at their local youth group pastor.

1763
01:26:44,360 --> 01:26:46,360
They're looking at an old rap band.

1764
01:26:46,360 --> 01:26:48,360
Tell you we got trouble.

1765
01:26:48,360 --> 01:26:50,360
I'm going to tell you what.

1766
01:26:50,360 --> 01:26:52,360
I'm going to tell you what.

1767
01:26:52,360 --> 01:26:54,360
I'm going to tell you what.

1768
01:26:54,360 --> 01:26:56,360
I'm going to tell you what.

1769
01:26:56,360 --> 01:27:00,360
I'm going to tell you what.

1770
01:27:00,360 --> 01:27:01,360
I'm going to tell you what.

1771
01:27:01,360 --> 01:27:02,360
I'm going to tell you what.

1772
01:27:02,360 --> 01:27:03,360
I'm going to tell you what.

1773
01:27:03,360 --> 01:27:06,360
I'm going to tell you what.

1774
01:27:06,360 --> 01:27:08,360
I'm going to tell you what.

1775
01:27:08,360 --> 01:27:10,360
Tell you we got trouble.

1776
01:27:10,360 --> 01:27:11,360
Uh,

1777
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:12,360
porno theater, not enough of a threat.

1778
01:27:12,360 --> 01:27:13,360
Then he's like, all right.

1779
01:27:13,360 --> 01:27:14,360
Here's what.

1780
01:27:14,360 --> 01:27:16,360
I'm going to do that nice house that I have that I got from the Gershwins.

1781
01:27:16,360 --> 01:27:22,360
Uh, I'm going to let the hell's angels live.

1782
01:27:22,360 --> 01:27:23,360
Um,

1783
01:27:23,360 --> 01:27:24,360
so,

1784
01:27:24,360 --> 01:27:25,360
I'm going to let the hell's angels live.

1785
01:27:25,360 --> 01:27:26,360
Um,

1786
01:27:26,360 --> 01:27:27,360
and then he's like,

1787
01:27:27,360 --> 01:27:28,360
Hey,

1788
01:27:28,360 --> 01:27:29,360
you're going to go to the porno theater.

1789
01:27:29,360 --> 01:27:30,360
Residents are going to drop dead.

1790
01:27:30,360 --> 01:27:32,360
Um,

1791
01:27:32,360 --> 01:27:33,360
so things are heating up and people are like,

1792
01:27:33,360 --> 01:27:35,360
why is this guy so.

1793
01:27:35,360 --> 01:27:36,360
Nuts.

1794
01:27:36,360 --> 01:27:37,360
And he says, well,

1795
01:27:37,360 --> 01:27:38,360
I'm look,

1796
01:27:38,360 --> 01:27:41,360
I'm just very determined why an example of this is when there was a burglar in

1797
01:27:41,360 --> 01:27:43,360
my home and I shot and killed him.

1798
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:44,360
Isمر.

1799
01:27:44,360 --> 01:27:45,360
Is that a one to one.

1800
01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:46,360
Is that a good example?

1801
01:27:46,360 --> 01:27:47,360
Of what it.

1802
01:27:47,360 --> 01:27:48,360
Well,

1803
01:27:48,360 --> 01:27:49,360
William Seidon is,

1804
01:27:49,360 --> 01:27:55,300
is attempting to kill

1805
01:27:55,300 --> 01:27:56,300
my business.

1806
01:27:56,300 --> 01:27:57,300
My entrepreneurship.

1807
01:27:57,300 --> 01:27:58,300
Look,

1808
01:27:58,300 --> 01:27:59,300
I don't want to be severe,

1809
01:27:59,300 --> 01:28:00,300
but if you don't let me over the arcade,

1810
01:28:00,300 --> 01:28:01,300
I'm going to shoot and kill you.

1811
01:28:01,300 --> 01:28:06,300
I'm going to run for city council.

1812
01:28:06,300 --> 01:28:07,300
When for sure.

1813
01:28:07,300 --> 01:28:09,300
And then for order of business,

1814
01:28:09,300 --> 01:28:10,300
clear my throat,

1815
01:28:10,300 --> 01:28:11,300
pour myself some water,

1816
01:28:11,300 --> 01:28:12,300
bang,

1817
01:28:12,300 --> 01:28:13,300
bang,

1818
01:28:13,300 --> 01:28:14,300
bang,

1819
01:28:14,300 --> 01:28:15,300
bang,

1820
01:28:15,300 --> 01:28:16,300
bang,

1821
01:28:16,300 --> 01:28:17,300
bang,

1822
01:28:18,240 --> 01:28:19,240
bang,

1823
01:28:19,240 --> 01:28:20,240
bang,

1824
01:28:20,240 --> 01:28:21,240
bang,

1825
01:28:21,240 --> 01:28:22,240
bang,

1826
01:28:22,240 --> 01:28:23,240
bang,

1827
01:28:23,240 --> 01:28:24,240
bang,

1828
01:28:24,240 --> 01:28:25,240
bang,

1829
01:28:25,240 --> 01:28:26,240
bang,

1830
01:28:26,240 --> 01:28:27,240
bang,

1831
01:28:27,240 --> 01:28:28,240
bang,

1832
01:28:28,240 --> 01:28:29,240
bang,

1833
01:28:29,240 --> 01:28:30,240
bang,

1834
01:28:30,240 --> 01:28:31,240
bang,

1835
01:28:31,240 --> 01:28:32,240
bang,

1836
01:28:32,240 --> 01:28:33,240
bang,

1837
01:28:33,240 --> 01:28:34,240
bang,

1838
01:28:34,240 --> 01:28:35,240
bang,

1839
01:28:35,240 --> 01:28:36,240
bang,

1840
01:28:36,240 --> 01:28:37,240
bang Pennies.

1841
01:28:37,240 --> 01:28:42,240
So this guy was just a.

1842
01:28:42,240 --> 01:28:45,240
Trouble maker in general.

1843
01:28:45,240 --> 01:28:49,280
In all of this, a guy said, I don't understand this man's persistence.

1844
01:28:49,280 --> 01:28:54,280
He's worth 119 million dollars and he works 90 hours a week.

1845
01:28:54,280 --> 01:28:55,980
You explain it.

1846
01:28:55,980 --> 01:28:59,180
And then a reminder, Kay's family manufactures pinball machines.

1847
01:28:59,180 --> 01:29:03,340
Jason, I everything you said at the beginning, I didn't know you were said that you were

1848
01:29:03,340 --> 01:29:04,340
doing the prologue.

1849
01:29:04,340 --> 01:29:05,340
Yeah.

1850
01:29:05,340 --> 01:29:06,340
Wow.

1851
01:29:06,340 --> 01:29:07,340
I don't know.

1852
01:29:07,340 --> 01:29:08,340
I don't get it.

1853
01:29:08,340 --> 01:29:09,340
How does he have all this money?

1854
01:29:09,340 --> 01:29:10,340
And he's just from a pinball machine family.

1855
01:29:10,340 --> 01:29:11,340
Right.

1856
01:29:11,340 --> 01:29:12,340
This was big money.

1857
01:29:12,340 --> 01:29:13,340
So what I was saying was wrong.

1858
01:29:13,440 --> 01:29:14,440
Well, there he is.

1859
01:29:14,440 --> 01:29:15,440
There's Arnie.

1860
01:29:15,440 --> 01:29:16,440
Was he eventually elected mayor?

1861
01:29:16,440 --> 01:29:17,440
Like, that'd be the fitting end of the story.

1862
01:29:17,440 --> 01:29:18,440
Then governor.

1863
01:29:18,440 --> 01:29:19,440
No, I will say, OK, here's here's the next few steps.

1864
01:29:19,440 --> 01:29:20,440
Oh, he also in this article where he's doing a lot of threatening says, if the town does

1865
01:29:20,440 --> 01:29:21,440
me harm, I will do the town harm.

1866
01:29:21,440 --> 01:29:22,440
And all this is enough for Arnie's place to victoriously open with this.

1867
01:29:22,440 --> 01:29:23,440
Wow.

1868
01:29:23,440 --> 01:29:24,440
Many.

1869
01:29:24,440 --> 01:29:25,440
Many.

1870
01:29:25,440 --> 01:29:26,440
Many.

1871
01:29:26,440 --> 01:29:27,440
Many.

1872
01:29:27,440 --> 01:29:28,440
Many.

1873
01:29:28,440 --> 01:29:29,440
Many.

1874
01:29:29,440 --> 01:29:30,440
Many.

1875
01:29:30,440 --> 01:29:31,440
Many.

1876
01:29:31,440 --> 01:29:32,440
Many.

1877
01:29:32,440 --> 01:29:33,440
Many.

1878
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:34,440
Many.

1879
01:29:34,440 --> 01:29:35,440
Many.

1880
01:29:35,440 --> 01:29:36,440
Many.

1881
01:29:36,440 --> 01:29:37,440
Many.

1882
01:29:37,440 --> 01:29:38,440
Many.

1883
01:29:38,440 --> 01:29:39,440
Many.

1884
01:29:39,440 --> 01:29:40,440
Many.

1885
01:29:40,440 --> 01:29:41,440
Many.

1886
01:29:41,440 --> 01:29:42,440
Many.

1887
01:29:42,540 --> 01:29:43,540
Many.

1888
01:29:43,540 --> 01:29:44,540
Wow.

1889
01:29:44,540 --> 01:29:45,540
Games as he wants.

1890
01:29:45,540 --> 01:29:49,760
Mr. Mayor Alderman, I've killed before, I've killed again.

1891
01:29:49,760 --> 01:29:52,780
Now onto my business today.

1892
01:29:52,780 --> 01:29:58,100
My, my real concern with Arnie K and this is a memory is coming back to me of like a

1893
01:29:58,100 --> 01:30:02,380
regular carbon side arcades where you put a quarter in and the game wouldn't start.

1894
01:30:02,380 --> 01:30:08,140
So then you find the put upon worker and they would like jam their finger on the coin and

1895
01:30:08,140 --> 01:30:14,060
sometimes use the key to open the machine and like toggle some stuff.

1896
01:30:14,060 --> 01:30:17,900
And eventually they go like, all right here and then close it back up and just give you

1897
01:30:17,900 --> 01:30:20,660
a few quarters and walk away.

1898
01:30:20,660 --> 01:30:23,180
You know, like, all right, it should be fine now.

1899
01:30:23,180 --> 01:30:27,020
I feel like Arnie K maybe not as generous.

1900
01:30:27,020 --> 01:30:30,860
I feel like I'd be scared to ask him to like, hey, can you open this directly?

1901
01:30:30,860 --> 01:30:31,860
Yes.

1902
01:30:31,860 --> 01:30:32,860
Yeah.

1903
01:30:32,860 --> 01:30:33,860
Waggle it around.

1904
01:30:33,860 --> 01:30:34,860
Yeah.

1905
01:30:34,860 --> 01:30:35,860
Yeah.

1906
01:30:35,860 --> 01:30:36,860
Yeah.

1907
01:30:36,860 --> 01:30:37,860
But one of his business suit wearing employees.

1908
01:30:38,580 --> 01:30:39,580
I don't remember who worked there.

1909
01:30:39,580 --> 01:30:40,580
I assume they were mostly teenagers.

1910
01:30:40,580 --> 01:30:42,900
Well, it said there were off duty cops working there as well.

1911
01:30:42,900 --> 01:30:46,260
I don't remember.

1912
01:30:46,260 --> 01:30:48,540
It is getting much more strip clubby.

1913
01:30:48,540 --> 01:30:50,300
The more, the more details you find out.

1914
01:30:50,300 --> 01:30:56,300
But I mean, I don't remember everyone looking like legs, you know, from fat Tony's.

1915
01:30:56,300 --> 01:31:02,900
Any of this vibe that I'm discussing, does this ring true or was it like, was that in

1916
01:31:02,900 --> 01:31:07,300
the past now thing things were innocent as far as you knew at Arnie's place?

1917
01:31:07,740 --> 01:31:08,980
That was all before I was born.

1918
01:31:08,980 --> 01:31:10,500
I was born a year after that.

1919
01:31:10,500 --> 01:31:14,380
I didn't live in the area until like a few years after that.

1920
01:31:14,380 --> 01:31:20,420
So that was Arnie's was just a business that was open, I believe, at that point.

1921
01:31:20,420 --> 01:31:26,860
But it was like, you know, it had like patterned, like, I think it was like kind of space ish,

1922
01:31:26,860 --> 01:31:33,140
you know, that kind of like 80s, like futuristic looking kind of pattern carpet also.

1923
01:31:33,140 --> 01:31:35,700
And it was just like, yeah, you know, it was just an arcade.

1924
01:31:35,700 --> 01:31:37,020
I had no idea about the backstory.

1925
01:31:37,020 --> 01:31:39,900
I think I think my dad must have found out about it like retroactively because obviously

1926
01:31:39,900 --> 01:31:40,900
he wasn't around either.

1927
01:31:41,100 --> 01:31:43,220
But it was then again, it was in The New York Times.

1928
01:31:43,220 --> 01:31:45,580
It seems like every week another discussion.

1929
01:31:45,580 --> 01:31:51,420
So there's so many articles baffled by how much this was talked about.

1930
01:31:51,540 --> 01:31:54,260
And and also, that's not the end.

1931
01:31:54,260 --> 01:31:59,020
Every single business that he had, every sub business had other stuff like this.

1932
01:31:59,140 --> 01:32:06,300
So just to close out that story, William Seidon, the almost but not named owner of the

1933
01:32:06,300 --> 01:32:08,740
pornography theater, lost his election.

1934
01:32:09,180 --> 01:32:11,980
Arnie got his way, but Seidon lost.

1935
01:32:12,060 --> 01:32:17,980
And then years later, when it was about to close circa 94, like you said, he the newspaper

1936
01:32:17,980 --> 01:32:20,740
asked him for comment and he said it was a good place and I will miss it.

1937
01:32:21,340 --> 01:32:22,780
I made a mistake.

1938
01:32:22,820 --> 01:32:26,740
He like, wow, he was the kiss the ring lately owned by Arnie.

1939
01:32:27,260 --> 01:32:31,820
They didn't mention it in the article, but there was a red dot that appeared on the side of his.

1940
01:32:33,620 --> 01:32:34,900
I have to go now.

1941
01:32:35,140 --> 01:32:36,300
No more comments.

1942
01:32:36,900 --> 01:32:42,780
Um, then then just like general memories that I saw on a message board about Arnie's place,

1943
01:32:42,780 --> 01:32:44,460
like, oh, yeah, lots of good times.

1944
01:32:44,660 --> 01:32:49,420
I remember one time when Arnie just snapped and everyone with a leather jacket was permanently

1945
01:32:49,420 --> 01:32:50,740
banned and thrown out.

1946
01:32:52,500 --> 01:32:54,860
He had the bat in his hand and everything.

1947
01:32:54,940 --> 01:32:55,740
The bat?

1948
01:32:55,740 --> 01:32:56,540
Good time.

1949
01:32:56,540 --> 01:32:57,260
The bat.

1950
01:32:58,860 --> 01:33:00,300
Don't make me get the bat.

1951
01:33:00,300 --> 01:33:00,660
Wow.

1952
01:33:00,660 --> 01:33:04,300
He was like, sting the wrestler sting with this trademark bat.

1953
01:33:05,220 --> 01:33:05,740
Wow.

1954
01:33:05,740 --> 01:33:08,100
He was up in the, he was up in the rafters the whole time.

1955
01:33:08,140 --> 01:33:08,420
Yeah.

1956
01:33:09,300 --> 01:33:09,540
Yeah.

1957
01:33:09,540 --> 01:33:11,060
Every now and then a spotlight.

1958
01:33:11,700 --> 01:33:12,620
Come on Arnie.

1959
01:33:13,300 --> 01:33:17,180
Then they had the whole thing where there was a fake Arnie also.

1960
01:33:17,180 --> 01:33:17,500
Yeah.

1961
01:33:17,500 --> 01:33:17,820
Yeah.

1962
01:33:17,820 --> 01:33:18,740
Too many Arnie's.

1963
01:33:18,780 --> 01:33:19,140
Yeah.

1964
01:33:19,140 --> 01:33:19,740
The decoy.

1965
01:33:19,740 --> 01:33:22,940
He had Arnie a decoys like Saddam Hussein.

1966
01:33:27,380 --> 01:33:31,100
Hey, are you 350 pounds in the Westport area?

1967
01:33:31,100 --> 01:33:32,420
Would you take a bullet for me?

1968
01:33:33,420 --> 01:33:34,420
Arnie's not here.

1969
01:33:34,420 --> 01:33:35,420
Arnie's not here.

1970
01:33:35,420 --> 01:33:39,420
His sons Uday and Kusay are running the Florida Hades.

1971
01:33:39,420 --> 01:33:39,940
That's right.

1972
01:33:41,940 --> 01:33:43,740
Man, the bat.

1973
01:33:43,740 --> 01:33:45,140
Yeah, the bats.

1974
01:33:45,140 --> 01:33:50,140
And what do you, to break down the story also, everyone with a leather jacket was banned?

1975
01:33:50,620 --> 01:33:54,340
Must have been like one kid with a leather jacket did something that annoyed him.

1976
01:33:54,340 --> 01:33:54,740
Yeah.

1977
01:33:54,740 --> 01:33:56,140
So that's it.

1978
01:33:56,140 --> 01:33:57,500
You leather-otties.

1979
01:33:57,500 --> 01:33:57,900
Yeah.

1980
01:33:57,900 --> 01:33:58,260
Yeah.

1981
01:33:58,260 --> 01:34:00,340
You never said Arnie's again.

1982
01:34:00,340 --> 01:34:01,860
Never said Arnie's again.

1983
01:34:01,860 --> 01:34:04,220
Leather blazers caught on in the 90s.

1984
01:34:04,220 --> 01:34:08,060
So did Arnie have to go like back in his office and think about banning that kid?

1985
01:34:09,820 --> 01:34:13,620
I come to think of it, I was a big leather jacket kid when I was seven.

1986
01:34:13,620 --> 01:34:15,860
So my parents like, whoa, whoa, whoa, you can't go in there like that.

1987
01:34:16,860 --> 01:34:18,100
I did not own any leather.

1988
01:34:18,100 --> 01:34:18,740
I don't believe.

1989
01:34:20,300 --> 01:34:22,220
You can wear this anywhere, but not there.

1990
01:34:24,140 --> 01:34:24,940
Don't want to die.

1991
01:34:24,940 --> 01:34:26,820
Hide it in the bushes outside.

1992
01:34:27,260 --> 01:34:28,260
Not allowed to bring that in.

1993
01:34:28,380 --> 01:34:33,740
Maybe Arnie just heard like the song, Leader of the Pack, and he got really upset.

1994
01:34:35,380 --> 01:34:37,220
He was like, no more.

1995
01:34:38,660 --> 01:34:40,660
All doo-wop based grievances.

1996
01:34:42,060 --> 01:34:43,980
Jersey boy. He hated Jersey boys.

1997
01:34:44,700 --> 01:34:49,460
The day, the day they opened the door to the Brill building, this country went downhill.

1998
01:34:50,460 --> 01:34:52,140
All that popular music.

1999
01:34:53,900 --> 01:34:54,860
He is a child.

2000
01:34:54,860 --> 01:34:57,380
A child wearing a leather jacket. Yeah.

2001
01:34:57,420 --> 01:34:58,620
Thank you, Jordan.

2002
01:34:58,620 --> 01:35:00,260
Yeah, this kid. No, he's out of there.

2003
01:35:00,260 --> 01:35:02,220
They were not alone. That kid's up to no good.

2004
01:35:02,540 --> 01:35:03,940
Leather jackets banned.

2005
01:35:03,940 --> 01:35:06,820
A snapping and unison banned.

2006
01:35:07,340 --> 01:35:09,540
Definitely banned. Yeah, definitely banned.

2007
01:35:10,900 --> 01:35:13,580
So then he opened a deli

2008
01:35:14,540 --> 01:35:18,340
and the and again, he ran a foul of the town.

2009
01:35:18,340 --> 01:35:22,220
They're like, yeah, I wish that this time we'll impose some stuff on Arnie

2010
01:35:22,220 --> 01:35:24,300
and I'm sure it'll be fine.

2011
01:35:24,300 --> 01:35:26,700
No, he did. He was denied a liquor license.

2012
01:35:26,940 --> 01:35:29,100
So he just started giving it away.

2013
01:35:29,100 --> 01:35:31,380
He's just giving away booze.

2014
01:35:31,380 --> 01:35:34,660
He said, this is like this is the new Boston Tea Party.

2015
01:35:36,540 --> 01:35:40,580
And then he like they were like, guy, there were like secret shoppers

2016
01:35:40,580 --> 01:35:43,340
coming in, like to see if like I've heard I've heard that.

2017
01:35:43,460 --> 01:35:46,140
All right, we'll see if we can get some of the

2018
01:35:46,140 --> 01:35:47,340
we'll see if we can order some wine.

2019
01:35:47,340 --> 01:35:50,220
But they gave themselves away because they came in and only ordered

2020
01:35:50,460 --> 01:35:53,660
two cans of clam stock at 1030 a.m.

2021
01:35:53,660 --> 01:35:54,500
I don't know.

2022
01:35:55,740 --> 01:35:57,700
He's done it. He's done it.

2023
01:35:57,700 --> 01:35:59,220
It seems fine to me.

2024
01:35:59,220 --> 01:36:00,780
Your next CVS for dollars.

2025
01:36:00,780 --> 01:36:03,900
You got to ask for a pound of Capacola, a pound of Provalo

2026
01:36:03,900 --> 01:36:06,380
and then the clam stock.

2027
01:36:07,100 --> 01:36:08,900
And it's like, oh, you have any wine floating around?

2028
01:36:08,900 --> 01:36:10,500
You're throwing some wine.

2029
01:36:11,740 --> 01:36:14,100
Free wine. You're going away for free.

2030
01:36:14,100 --> 01:36:15,380
So there was that.

2031
01:36:15,380 --> 01:36:18,100
And then the last this is the most inane lawsuit

2032
01:36:18,620 --> 01:36:22,940
ever that Arnie lost a 1991

2033
01:36:22,940 --> 01:36:28,300
lawsuit against Nabisco, then the owner of the trademark for a one sauce

2034
01:36:28,580 --> 01:36:32,060
because his deli was selling a sauce called a two sauce.

2035
01:36:37,380 --> 01:36:38,420
Yeah, fuck it.

2036
01:36:38,420 --> 01:36:41,900
Those A1 guys sitting up on their high horse.

2037
01:36:42,020 --> 01:36:45,220
They think they're the only sauce in this country.

2038
01:36:45,220 --> 01:36:46,820
I mean, he is he is.

2039
01:36:46,820 --> 01:36:50,060
I mean, if he's really worth 100 million dollars and he's this

2040
01:36:50,740 --> 01:36:54,940
willing to like to go to like I looked up the case,

2041
01:36:54,940 --> 01:36:56,060
I went to summary judgments.

2042
01:36:56,060 --> 01:36:58,300
That means it went all the way through discovery all the way through.

2043
01:36:58,300 --> 01:36:59,740
We're getting deposed.

2044
01:36:59,740 --> 01:37:03,340
They did probably trademark surveys to see like what the public

2045
01:37:03,660 --> 01:37:07,540
how famous a one is, you know, and who is associated with what all that kind of stuff.

2046
01:37:07,940 --> 01:37:10,260
And so it's probably cost hundreds of thousands of dollars.

2047
01:37:10,460 --> 01:37:15,060
And he got his clock absolutely cleaned in the decision because, yeah, of course.

2048
01:37:15,940 --> 01:37:20,340
And but somebody got paid a lot of money to work on that for probably

2049
01:37:20,340 --> 01:37:23,260
like a couple of years, like it's completely insane.

2050
01:37:24,180 --> 01:37:26,620
Right. That he would not think like that.

2051
01:37:26,940 --> 01:37:27,820
He has no case.

2052
01:37:27,820 --> 01:37:31,540
Probably somebody told him right away, you are not going to win this like hell.

2053
01:37:31,540 --> 01:37:35,460
I ain't we're going because his attitude was, you know, fuck them.

2054
01:37:35,500 --> 01:37:37,740
You know, and it's like, well, Nabisco has a little bit more

2055
01:37:38,420 --> 01:37:43,060
of an ability to fight things and maybe inclination than, you know, a suburban town.

2056
01:37:43,060 --> 01:37:44,340
That's just like, oh, God.

2057
01:37:44,340 --> 01:37:47,060
OK, he has like he's willing to spend any money.

2058
01:37:47,100 --> 01:37:48,820
All right. We're going to roll over here.

2059
01:37:48,820 --> 01:37:51,540
You know, well, there is a of an obscure.

2060
01:37:51,540 --> 01:37:53,620
Going to open the Nabisco porno theater.

2061
01:37:53,620 --> 01:37:54,420
That's his big.

2062
01:37:56,260 --> 01:37:58,740
And then he gets sued for trademark infringement again.

2063
01:37:58,900 --> 01:38:00,420
Is that so? That's what would happen.

2064
01:38:02,500 --> 01:38:07,540
We got a wall with a glory hole and the hole is in the hole of Nabisco.

2065
01:38:10,340 --> 01:38:14,180
I looked up a two sauce and just got a lot of results for recipes

2066
01:38:14,180 --> 01:38:16,060
for homemade yum yum sauce.

2067
01:38:17,060 --> 01:38:18,860
OK, you guys make it now.

2068
01:38:18,860 --> 01:38:23,540
Yum yum sauce is that I'm disturbed by the phrase homemade yum yum sauce.

2069
01:38:23,980 --> 01:38:25,700
That sounds like something you would hear in a buffet.

2070
01:38:27,860 --> 01:38:30,660
Hell, yeah. Yum yum sauce.

2071
01:38:31,820 --> 01:38:34,940
It's just hot sauce, cayenne mayonnaise, sugar, garlic.

2072
01:38:34,940 --> 01:38:36,620
It's just like a spicy mayo.

2073
01:38:36,620 --> 01:38:38,900
It seems that's one way to make.

2074
01:38:38,900 --> 01:38:41,220
Yeah, I know. I know another.

2075
01:38:42,180 --> 01:38:45,380
Hey, I got another idea for your sauce to.

2076
01:38:46,260 --> 01:38:49,660
I'm probably not tasting good.

2077
01:38:49,660 --> 01:38:50,980
I'm just a huckle.

2078
01:38:50,980 --> 01:38:54,980
Final preparation step says put yum yum sauce on the glass.

2079
01:38:59,380 --> 01:39:01,180
You could get kicked out of a concert for that.

2080
01:39:01,180 --> 01:39:04,380
Yeah, I think even the even the parking lot.

2081
01:39:04,900 --> 01:39:06,820
All right. Let's let's wind this guy down.

2082
01:39:06,820 --> 01:39:10,740
We've this is I'm exhausted by the story of Arnie,

2083
01:39:10,740 --> 01:39:12,900
but so excited by it because, you know, we've been taught

2084
01:39:13,220 --> 01:39:16,900
there's been this phrase guys on the show lately.

2085
01:39:16,900 --> 01:39:20,580
And I when Patrick, when you told me the vague

2086
01:39:21,620 --> 01:39:25,220
situation with Arnie and I started looking in like, I think we have

2087
01:39:25,300 --> 01:39:27,820
I think we have a local guy on our hands.

2088
01:39:27,820 --> 01:39:30,340
It's hard to describe what guy is exactly.

2089
01:39:30,340 --> 01:39:32,660
But I was thinking qualities of it are just like

2090
01:39:34,060 --> 01:39:38,100
it like endless wealth, endless determination

2091
01:39:38,500 --> 01:39:42,260
to make a really like limited dream happen.

2092
01:39:42,900 --> 01:39:48,260
And that like you are it like fail.

2093
01:39:48,500 --> 01:39:49,780
It fails a bunch.

2094
01:39:49,780 --> 01:39:53,860
Wait, this is the phrase that you are your failure prone,

2095
01:39:53,980 --> 01:39:56,180
but also failure proof.

2096
01:39:56,180 --> 01:40:00,780
Yes. Anybody who fails over and over again and yet just gets up

2097
01:40:00,780 --> 01:40:02,940
and does it again immediately. Right.

2098
01:40:02,940 --> 01:40:04,900
And that's definitely Arnie.

2099
01:40:04,900 --> 01:40:07,420
That's definitely Arnie. Yeah. Yeah. Man.

2100
01:40:08,380 --> 01:40:10,380
A two saws.

2101
01:40:10,980 --> 01:40:12,180
That's that's really good.

2102
01:40:12,180 --> 01:40:13,860
You can't sue me. It's you know, take two.

2103
01:40:13,860 --> 01:40:15,060
What? It's way different.

2104
01:40:15,060 --> 01:40:16,380
If I could direct.

2105
01:40:16,380 --> 01:40:18,220
Yeah, you found a bottle.

2106
01:40:18,220 --> 01:40:20,260
Found a bottle.

2107
01:40:20,260 --> 01:40:22,740
Wow. Arnie would be so so proud.

2108
01:40:22,780 --> 01:40:28,460
If I could direct the jury to the second numeral in the

2109
01:40:28,580 --> 01:40:30,580
I assume he represented himself.

2110
01:40:30,580 --> 01:40:32,140
Oh, yeah, he would have to.

2111
01:40:32,140 --> 01:40:36,460
Does this look like a one to you is the most bent up one I've ever seen.

2112
01:40:36,820 --> 01:40:39,020
If that's the one.

2113
01:40:39,020 --> 01:40:41,380
Um, I'm sorry. I think this case is not.

2114
01:40:41,380 --> 01:40:44,260
Oh, then can I direct your attention to the bat?

2115
01:40:46,020 --> 01:40:47,420
He's got a bat.

2116
01:40:48,820 --> 01:40:50,900
His trademark bat.

2117
01:40:50,900 --> 01:40:55,060
My client is prepared to offer not to name a porno theater after your client.

2118
01:40:56,300 --> 01:40:58,420
We will not budge on this.

2119
01:41:02,740 --> 01:41:04,420
All right. Well, what a delight.

2120
01:41:04,420 --> 01:41:06,820
Thank you for bringing us this this local flavor,

2121
01:41:06,820 --> 01:41:10,980
giving us something to cut loose on Patrick Monahan.

2122
01:41:12,620 --> 01:41:16,100
Unless you if you cross us, you will be Patrick Monahan of the Patrick Monahan

2123
01:41:16,260 --> 01:41:17,500
pornography theater.

2124
01:41:17,500 --> 01:41:19,220
But for now, we've had a good time with you.

2125
01:41:19,220 --> 01:41:21,580
So we'll just say you survived by guess the ride.

2126
01:41:22,980 --> 01:41:23,900
What a blast.

2127
01:41:23,900 --> 01:41:24,980
Let's take it to the gift shop.

2128
01:41:24,980 --> 01:41:27,180
Is there anything you'd like to plug?

2129
01:41:27,900 --> 01:41:28,700
What a time to be alive.

2130
01:41:28,700 --> 01:41:32,340
It's a let's see, it's the podcast that counts down the things each week

2131
01:41:32,340 --> 01:41:34,220
to make you say the thing that's the title of podcast.

2132
01:41:34,220 --> 01:41:35,980
It's dumb news.

2133
01:41:35,980 --> 01:41:36,820
Nothing too serious.

2134
01:41:36,820 --> 01:41:40,380
It's me, Eli Yudin, Kath Barbador, all comedians.

2135
01:41:40,780 --> 01:41:42,740
And that's the main thing.

2136
01:41:42,740 --> 01:41:45,540
And I don't know. I'm like Patty Moe on the social stuff, I guess.

2137
01:41:45,540 --> 01:41:48,420
So that's about it. Fantastic.

2138
01:41:49,260 --> 01:41:50,660
Yes. And you're super funny on there.

2139
01:41:50,660 --> 01:41:51,900
And so super funny with us.

2140
01:41:51,900 --> 01:41:53,620

01:41:53,620 --> 01:41:56,580

Check out podcast, the ride, the second gate where Patrick, you'll be happy here.

2148
01:42:12,820 --> 01:42:14,900
There is an episode coming up that's in the can

2149
01:42:15,340 --> 01:42:18,620
that does involve Mr. Belvedere sitting on his own balls.

2150
01:42:19,700 --> 01:42:21,780
The great tale will be told.

2151
01:42:23,260 --> 01:42:25,460
But only behind the the second gate,

2152
01:42:26,180 --> 01:42:29,620
which you can find at Patreon dot com slash podcast, the ride.

2153
01:42:29,620 --> 01:42:31,500
Well, what a delight.

2154
01:42:31,500 --> 01:42:35,660
And I also, by the way, on the fly, I cut, you know,

2155
01:42:35,660 --> 01:42:37,380
have a little music to go out on.

2156
01:42:37,700 --> 01:42:40,460
Jordan, there's one more thing I want to say about Arnie's place

2157
01:42:40,460 --> 01:42:44,460
is that apparently it was a great place to play the game Journey.

2158
01:42:44,460 --> 01:42:46,300
You guys know the game Journey?

2159
01:42:47,300 --> 01:42:48,740
I don't. I can't say.

2160
01:42:48,740 --> 01:42:52,060
And when I say Journey, it is the Journey that you might be thinking of.

2161
01:42:52,060 --> 01:42:53,860
Really? There is a game.

2162
01:42:53,860 --> 01:42:55,940
I think the home game was called Journey, the Escape.

2163
01:42:55,940 --> 01:42:58,780
But the other one is just Journey, the arcade game.

2164
01:42:58,900 --> 01:43:00,500
You know, just screw it.

2165
01:43:00,500 --> 01:43:02,500
Let's just play. What video do you got?

2166
01:43:06,500 --> 01:43:10,500
Data Age presents the world's first rock video game Journey Escape.

2167
01:43:10,500 --> 01:43:11,780
The concert's over.

2168
01:43:11,780 --> 01:43:14,780
Now you must help each member of Journey escape to mobs.

2169
01:43:14,780 --> 01:43:17,540
Each member. Shifty eyed promoters.

2170
01:43:17,540 --> 01:43:18,780
Neil and Steve.

2171
01:43:20,780 --> 01:43:24,540
Find your roadies and manager and run for the escape vehicle

2172
01:43:24,540 --> 01:43:26,540
and live to rock another day.

2173
01:43:26,540 --> 01:43:29,740
Journey Escape for the Atari 2600 from Data Age.

2174
01:43:29,740 --> 01:43:34,780
Yeah, Journey, the video game, which, yeah, apparently you could play

2175
01:43:34,780 --> 01:43:37,460
at Arnie's and a lot of places and people did pride themselves

2176
01:43:37,460 --> 01:43:40,060
in having high scores in that game, which you would, of course, get

2177
01:43:40,060 --> 01:43:42,340
by playing as each member. And I mean all of them.

2178
01:43:42,340 --> 01:43:44,740
So, yes, really, you can be Neil Sean.

2179
01:43:44,740 --> 01:43:46,940
You have to retrieve Neil Sean's guitar.

2180
01:43:46,940 --> 01:43:50,500
And then once you do, you can shoot energy bullets, of course,

2181
01:43:50,500 --> 01:43:52,740
or you can play as Jonathan Cronin.

2182
01:43:52,740 --> 01:43:54,940
You can play as the guy who's playing the guitar.

2183
01:43:54,940 --> 01:43:59,100
Or you can play as Jonathan Kane, where you descend a series of ramps

2184
01:43:59,100 --> 01:44:02,940
while jumping over moving hurdles to reach Kane's keyboard.

2185
01:44:02,940 --> 01:44:05,700
Then shoot lines of it. The whole thing, it actually becomes that

2186
01:44:05,700 --> 01:44:12,660
you're playing a concert in space and you have to watch out for alien groupoids.

2187
01:44:12,660 --> 01:44:15,020
Oh, wow. Really? Yeah. Yeah.

2188
01:44:15,020 --> 01:44:18,940
That's what would happen if you were Journey in space.

2189
01:44:18,940 --> 01:44:22,060
But that all with that exciting commercial having just been played.

2190
01:44:22,060 --> 01:44:26,220
And we'll let this music play us out in this clip from the game.

2191
01:44:26,220 --> 01:44:27,980
So that's how they dressed up the game on TV.

2192
01:44:27,980 --> 01:44:31,660
Then you go play it in an arcade and this is what you get.

2193
01:44:31,660 --> 01:44:34,980
Here's some sweet sounds and thanks for listening, everybody.

2194
01:44:34,980 --> 01:44:36,740
And watching on forever, dog.

2195
01:44:42,700 --> 01:44:46,020
Steve is going to get his microphone and stand up.

2196
01:44:46,020 --> 01:44:48,420
He got it. That sound was him getting it.

2197
01:44:48,420 --> 01:44:51,500
Now he's about to die.

2198
01:44:51,500 --> 01:44:54,260
Oh, my God, Steve Perry has been compromised to a permanent end.

2199
01:45:00,700 --> 01:45:05,340
This has been a forever dog production executive produced by Mike Carlson,

2200
01:45:05,620 --> 01:45:11,460
Jason Sheridan, Scott Gardner, Brett Boehm, Joe Sileo and Alex Ramsey.
