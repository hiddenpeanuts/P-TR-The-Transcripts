00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,520
Warning, today's episode may include mild lust over an anthropomorphized Hershey's kiss,

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:11,280
pregnancy-threatening chocolate spa treatments, and talking toilets begging for a meal. If you're

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:30,960
a Twizzler or higher, you may join special guest Evan Susser for a trip to Hershey Park on Podcast The Ride.

4
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:44,240
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, the theme park podcast hosted by three men who are very used to a gym teacher yelling,

5
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:50,720
come on, hustle at them. My name is Mike Carlson and I'm joined as always by Scott Gairdner.

6
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:57,040
That's right. And Jason Sheridan. A familiar refrain if I've ever heard one. Yeah, I think we all have

7
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:03,200
nightmares about that. And today we have a very special guest. He's a screenwriter of the movie

8
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:08,480
Fist Fight and he's the rabble-rousing commissioner on the podcast Doughboys. Ladies and gentlemen,

9
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:16,080
it's Evan Susser. Guys, great to be here and no rabble-rousing here. It's a different kind of podcast here.

10
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:24,160
I'm just here to have fun and talk about amusement. Thank you. You didn't insert yourself. You're here politely.

11
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:32,320
I did Imbarge In. You didn't play walk-in music? I didn't play walk-out music. I can add that in post.

12
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:39,840
No. The Vince McMahon music. No, no, no. No walk-in music. We're doing great guys. I do actually even have a gift.

13
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:48,800
Whoa, what? This is a first. Very on theme. I've got a bunch of Hershey's milk chocolate bars and I

14
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:54,880
thought that very fittingly, you know, David Letterman, a broadcaster if ever there was one.

15
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:00,960
To this day. Do you know what I'm going to say? Before he would do his shows, he would have, I think it

16
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,920
changed throughout the years. I think it used to be multiple, but he would just scarf down some

17
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:12,400
Hershey's bars to get like the adrenaline going. So if anybody wants to eat some of a Hershey

18
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:17,360
bar to kind of get their adrenaline going. And I thought I would bring that element of Doughboys,

19
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,800
the chewing on microphone. Yes, please. That is, thank you. First of all, thank you very much.

20
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,640
Today we're talking Hershey Park. I will say there's a good chance Jason's already eaten a

21
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:33,600
couple of these before we started. Entirely possible. You know, my usual routine on a film or TV set is to

22
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:41,360
drink a few coffees and eat peanut M&Ms for hours before doing anything. You spend a lot of time

23
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:46,320
just sitting around on those sets and so may as well make the most of them. Do I have to eat it

24
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:51,360
fast? Is that the Letterman way? I think the Letterman way is like right before, and I should

25
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:57,280
have looked up this story. And so there'll be more complaints about the research on this podcast.

26
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:03,680
But I think he would originally, I think he would shove a bunch of his mouth right before he would

27
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:09,920
run on stage. Then I think in the later years it became snacking on them and pineapple slices,

28
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,760
kind of in the green room before. But you know, I thought that, you know, there's something if

29
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:20,560
Letterman does it. If David Letterman does it, the king of late night. I also thought that, you know,

30
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,960
when we're going to be talking about Hershey and we'll be talking about the amusement park element

31
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:30,640
of it, you know, maybe it'll be easy to forget about the candy itself. And I do not want to

32
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:36,080
forget about the candy. Well, you're at Hershey Park, which I went to God knows how many times

33
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:42,560
growing up, they do not let you forget about the candy and you are given a taste and then offered

34
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:47,200
the option to buy giant versions of the candy. Uh-huh. And you're offered the opportunity to

35
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:53,600
meet giant versions of the candy. They're walking around, they're all your favorite characters. Mr.

36
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:59,120
Hershey, Reese, Jolly Rancher. Oh yeah, yeah. I'm a big Jolly Rancher fan. We'll get into that.

37
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,200
Yeah, yeah. There's so much to cover. I'm very excited about those characters. I don't know

38
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:06,320
where to begin exactly. I mean, we can, we can begin with you. You grew up, I guess,

39
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:13,920
I don't, I think I don't know where, but near Hershey Park, presumably. Yep. I ate a lot of it.

40
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:19,040
It is a thick chocolate. Everyone wrestling with these wrappers probably sounds horrible.

41
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:23,120
Also annoying. And you told us not to fumble with the mic cords. And so those are getting

42
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:30,880
fumbled with. I grew up in a suburb of Washington, DC, Rockville, Maryland. So yeah, Hershey,

43
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:37,120
Pennsylvania, not too far. Uh, well, like three hours. So, uh, not very far. And we would go on

44
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:43,280
family trips. I think I was talking with my mother, I think we went two times, which is not

45
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:52,480
a ton, but you know, um, and the first time we stayed at one of my dad's friends from college,

46
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:56,400
uh, at his apartment building in Hershey. And that like felt like a real thing to do.

47
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:04,400
Wait, at what age are you? About like five or four when that happened. And then I went again

48
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:10,640
later when I was like 10. Okay. Um, anything, anything shady about this apartment? No,

49
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:17,680
I think that, uh, I think that just the idea of, I don't know if we had stayed at too many people's

50
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:25,280
like places that they lived besides family members. Right. Um, and also like apartment,

51
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:29,200
like, you know, I think that just like the whole thing about him, like, oh, this is interesting.

52
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,560
Like there was just something interesting about the whole situation. Was he a single man?

53
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,440
I think he had a wife with no kids. That's still weird. I think too. Having a, yeah. When you're a

54
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,680
family, you have a family like your dad, like why don't these people have kids? Exactly.

55
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,560
Something's weird. You can't articulate it. You live in a chocolate town. Well, that was also

56
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:53,040
in my memory, Jason or Scott. So Jason and Scott, you guys have both been Mike. You've not been,

57
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:58,240
I've never been. Okay. My memory is that the whole town smells like chocolate that maybe is wrong.

58
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:04,000
That's my memory too. It's funny. I grew up much closer. I grew up about an hour and 45 minutes

59
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:11,280
from Philadelphia. My mom, uh, has since moved like outside of Lancaster. So even closer or

60
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:16,000
sorry, I grew up an hour and 45 minutes from Hershey. My mom now lives outside of Lancaster,

61
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,360
Pennsylvania. Now an hour from Hershey, which has made me realize like, oh, I should go back.

62
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:26,240
One of the times that I go to visit, we would go the other direction. We would go down to Washington

63
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:32,400
DC for like long weekend like short trips. Uh, so we were going the opposite, but yeah, we went to

64
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:40,080
Hershey a lot growing up. Uh, there's a famous, uh, story within my family where we were going to

65
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:48,080
Hershey for like a long holiday weekend. And, uh, my parents forgot the bag that all my clothes were

66
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:55,280
in like at like five. So we had to go to Kmart and buy me a few outfits for the weekend. I was

67
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:59,040
horrible. I was hoping that that was that you bought all the clothes at the Hershey park. Yeah.

68
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:03,600
So you were wearing like Milk Dud shirts and Reese's pants. That would have been more,

69
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:10,720
more fun. Hershey kiss Halloween costume kept wearing at school the next year. A peppermint

70
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:17,120
Patty hat. And then I think that both times that we went to, uh, Hershey, my family wrapped in

71
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:23,840
going to Amish country. Uh, so it was like a two in one trip, uh, which is a fun juxtaposition.

72
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:31,360
It's a thrilling experience that children hate. Does Amish country have anything like any not

73
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:37,680
rides, but well they have, I guess, pony rides or like horse and buggy, but is there stuff for like

74
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:42,800
us, uh, technology users to do it? Is there like, do they have stuff set up? I guess is what I'm

75
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:48,320
saying. You can like turn butter. Okay. It's like worse than colonial Williamsburg if you've ever

76
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:54,000
been there. Never been there. All right. Um, yeah, it's, uh, there are, um, smorgasbord,

77
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:00,240
which is like a large buffet of buttered noodles and other unseasoned foods. Uh,

78
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:06,960
is seasoning against, uh, I don't think it's against, but spice is not traditionally associated

79
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:13,760
with the, a lot of pickling, a lot of German kind of inspired without the internet. They haven't

80
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:19,680
gotten to look up and learn about salt and pepper. It's eluded them. No one's brought them salt and

81
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:25,840
pepper yet. There's a number of pretzel and potato chip factories in Pennsylvania,

82
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:32,400
specifically in Amish country, hers and why also, I also went to hers potato chip factory,

83
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:37,280
which is also, you know, Hershey is also the fact, I mean, you know, we should get into that,

84
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:42,960
but Hershey is Hershey, Pennsylvania. There's the factory element of it too, where they make

85
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:48,400
the chocolate. Right. Um, yes, it really is. And, and, uh, where the factory, where they make the

86
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:55,920
chocolate and it looks very much, uh, turn of the century, it looks very 1900s, the big smokestacks

87
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:01,680
and it feels very factory town. And when I went, when I was 12 or so, uh, we stayed at the big,

88
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:06,800
beautiful hotel Hershey, which I think was built in the thirties. Yeah. Weren't you fancy? Yeah.

89
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,720
Dad's college roommate apartment for you. No, no preppy Preppington.

90
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:20,640
Lobby boy at the hotel. Oh, look at these faucets. Look at these fixtures, daddy.

91
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:30,080
They're candy. I have some, I was looking through the hotel and they have a chocolate spa there.

92
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:37,600
They sure do. From the website, uh, you can, there's yeah, chocolate spa and the specific

93
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:42,960
stuff they offer. There's they have a spa treatment called the chocolate bean polish,

94
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:49,120
which is sort of suggestive to me somehow. And, uh, and they know it on the website,

95
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:54,320
whipped cocoa bath and chocolate fondue wrap are not recommended for guests who are pregnant.

96
00:09:54,320 --> 00:10:03,920
Oh, weird. Yeah. There's the Hershey hotel and the Hershey lodge are both sort of associated with

97
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:12,160
the parks and the hotel is classy and the lodge is trash. The lodge is a water park inside of it

98
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:19,760
with the Hershey kisses people and stuff. How gauche. Uh, yeah. Uh, sorry, Scott. Sorry. It's

99
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:25,520
not off to your, don't bedevil my ears with the tie with this peasant talk. You didn't stay there

100
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:32,640
ever. I think we stayed at the hotel once, once or twice, maybe. Um, we did a lot of day trips

101
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:37,920
up to Hershey cause we were so close. Uh, we would go around Christmas time cause there's,

102
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:43,120
there's a park and at right at the entrance of the park, technically a separate entity is Hershey's

103
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:49,200
chocolate world, which is it's separate, but it's really the crown jewel of the park. Like it is the

104
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:54,960
money part of the most of my information is about yes. Yeah. And, and, and we would also, I would go

105
00:10:54,960 --> 00:11:00,880
on school field trips to, or like the band and the chorus would go up and do like competitions

106
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:06,480
up there and you would sing like two songs and then be released onto the park for six or seven

107
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:13,920
hours. Uh, I, I, I spoke to, um, my wife, uh, Jamie was also from, uh, the East coast and she

108
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:19,760
used to go every summer with her summer camp and she said there were all sorts of like summer camp

109
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:25,680
shenanigans that they would get into. Oh yeah. Uh, including they would in the world of chocolate,

110
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:29,920
I guess the counselors would like flash the camera at the end, like taking the picture,

111
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:36,720
like the splash mountain thing and they all got in trouble. The counselor? Yes. Um, and then, uh,

112
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,400
and then I guess the whole competition was trying to get people to give the name tags,

113
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:45,280
the people who worked at the park, but that was like a pride to be able to have someone

114
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:49,920
give you their name tag. So an employee that you were trying to like coerce them into giving the

115
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:55,760
name tag to you. Right. And that was just like a, that was like a lion's head at the end of the day.

116
00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:01,280
So you're trying to get a low level employee in trouble. Yeah, exactly. I mean, kids are mean.

117
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:08,240
Yeah. Um, my shenanigans, I remember specifically going one year with, uh, uh, some friends when we

118
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,560
were in school and none of them liked heights, none of them wanted to ride the roller coasters.

119
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:16,960
And I was really pissed because we just like rode the monorail and the bumper cars a bunch.

120
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:23,040
And the next year I remember going into the park with them and going, well guys, see ya.

121
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:28,480
And just went off on my own so I could ride the comment and eat a big chili dog was not supposed

122
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,400
to be separate from groups. It was not supposed to be, you were not supposed to be walking around

123
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:37,600
the park alone. And I like, no, fuck that. I'm riding some rides. How old were you? Uh,

124
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:42,320
I would have been like 12. Wow. I mean, this is, this is a ballsy or move than I would have ever

125
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:47,760
made. I think you were really probably the coolest of the three hosts of the show. I don't know that

126
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:55,760
that's accurate. Uh, but maybe now, but when you were young, Oh, okay. Uh, we've leveled off to,

127
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:02,000
on the scale of a one to 10, 10 being the coolest we're all hovering around. Yeah. 1.5. I'll be a

128
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,760
little generous, but it was just, it was just to feed the disease we talk about. It was the feed

129
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:13,760
that like, no, I'm here. I want to ride some coasters and I want to go ride Chuck, the

130
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:19,280
chocolate tour a bunch of chocolate. So should we just get into the chocolate? Yeah. Let's roll

131
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:25,040
right into the park. Now there was a time until like 1973 where you used to actually tour the

132
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:29,760
factory. There were public tours of the factory. My mother told me that she went on one of these

133
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:35,600
public tours cause she's also, she's from New York. Uh, and she said, now when I went, we actually

134
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:42,160
went on the tour of the actual factory. Yeah. And I thought that was amazing. Anything, uh,

135
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:46,080
interesting beyond that? Probably probably more boring than what they have now. Yeah. I think

136
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:51,760
that, uh, it's like, there's, it wasn't a child like that fell on the chocolate river. No, it was

137
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:58,000
not. I think it was just like a factory. There was no magic. No psychedelic musical numbers.

138
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:07,440
Just that's a lot of vats and stirring. Um, okay. But so they, because the demand was, was so high,

139
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:12,720
uh, to, uh, tour this magical chocolate factory, probably, especially in the wake of the film,

140
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:18,640
Willy Wonka and the chocolate factory. Isn't that around 1973? Maybe that's why. Maybe the movie

141
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:25,760
blew it out so hard. People pounding down the doors, uh, drunk turned into, into blueberries.

142
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:31,840
Well, this, this is also like when you grow up in this area, it is a popular activity for families

143
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:39,760
is tour factory junk food factory, get free, Jerry's a big one and Jerry's because your other

144
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:46,240
option is tour battlefields. Like, well, like I have seen Gettysburg, I've seen Valley forge,

145
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:51,680
uh, uh, uh, you know, uh, just where the, where the Wright brothers took off. You ever been there?

146
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:55,840
You've been to Kitty Hawk. No, that's further. Is that North Carolina? I guess that's out of there.

147
00:14:55,840 --> 00:15:01,440
That's kind of out of the zone. All right. Uh, I don't know my geography. Uh, uh, yeah. Further,

148
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:07,760
further South. Uh, so yeah, popular, popular thing that everyone can kind of agree on, you know,

149
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:14,240
and especially for Hershey's chocolate world, the Hershey's visitor center is free. Oh yeah. And

150
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:21,040
still to this day, I think I forgot that now I guess elements within chocolate world cost money,

151
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:27,680
such as the build your own chocolate bar exhibit, but the main attraction I'm, I'm, I'm really

152
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:34,640
surprised it's still free. And so this, to replace having to have the mechanism in the factory to do

153
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:41,600
an actual tour. Now there is a dark ride that simulates a magical chocolate factory experience.

154
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:46,560
So what is it called? Do we, uh, is it just called the world of chocolate? It's I believe

155
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:52,000
it's just called the, um, chocolate factory tour. Hershey's chocolate tour. I have a no chocolate

156
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,360
tour, but it's going to take me a second to. Well, in the meantime, the main thing that I know about

157
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:03,200
it and that has echoed in my head since I was 12, I didn't have to look this up on YouTube. It is so

158
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:09,040
deeply in my head is that song. Yeah. Much more of an earworm, perhaps even than it's a small world.

159
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:16,880
The Hershey's chocolate, Hershey's chocolate, Hershey's chocolate world. Okay. Wait. All right.

160
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:21,360
You're probably correct. I have the lyrics here. You guys are getting the old acapella group back

161
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:28,480
together. See, we said the harmony is perfect. Wherever you go, no matter how far you're always

162
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:39,920
near a Hershey bar. I know it. Hershey's chocolate chocolate. Hershey's the great American chocolate

163
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:46,240
bar. Oh, deeply, deeply in my head ever since. Just for the listener is, uh, this, that was

164
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:52,800
actually Scott and Jason singing, not a recording. Not a professional. We didn't pipe in a, uh,

165
00:16:52,800 --> 00:17:00,640
yeah, but this is amazing. This, uh, ride because it is like a dark ride, but then there are also

166
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:07,360
incorporated, like you go over seeing what seems to be parts of the actual factory because there

167
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:14,160
are these big vats of chocolate. Yeah. And I think that this is also with Hershey park, what I kind

168
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:19,440
of, one of the reasons why I was excited to talk about it is, I think you guys have touched on this.

169
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:23,920
Like when you're a little kid and you're like figuring out what's real and not real

170
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:31,680
amusement parks, throw a wrench in that. And then even more so, so I think I was listening,

171
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:35,360
which when you guys are talking about ET and like, you know, Steven Spielberg telling you,

172
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:40,880
you have to do this to save ET. You believe it's real. And then you kind of become to realize,

173
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:47,120
okay, wait, that's not exactly true. But then you go to Hershey park and it's being explained to

174
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:53,840
you that this is a real factory and it seems like it is real because you're seeing these big vats

175
00:17:53,840 --> 00:18:00,160
and it's very practical, but then there are also singing cows and then you kind of are like, well,

176
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:06,240
wait, do the cows or the singing cows real too. All right. I got to talk about the singing cows.

177
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:12,960
Singing cows are new, like in the last five years. Okay. The singing cows, uh, uh,

178
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:18,640
I, the singing cows are dead to me. They, the singing cows are not cannon. There's a real

179
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:26,160
little one named cupcake. Fuck you cupcake. Uh, my, my version of this ride is I found

180
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:33,360
there's a really good quality, a ride through from 1991. So when digitized like a family VHS tape

181
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:39,440
of the 91, 1991 ride through, and once again, another case of one of us preferring the older

182
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:46,400
dryer version of the ride. Uh, it's mostly that song. And then a man like telling you like, no,

183
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:54,560
we go through the beans are roasted and chocolate liqueur is extracted. Whereas now it is the,

184
00:18:54,560 --> 00:19:03,120
uh, animated there's kind of, uh, uh, 3d holograms of the, uh, of, of Hershey and Reese and kiss.

185
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,560
Yeah. The three primary, the big three, the Hershey park.

186
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:14,560
And there's also Alex, your, your I'm fine with Alex. Your, your factory employee. Oh,

187
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:22,160
he's the guy, uh, she, she, Oh, and, and, and so, and there's also a lot more like

188
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:29,520
Vox kind of info graph along the walls. I did see that they've added a lot of info graphs. Yeah.

189
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:34,720
But it used to be, they kept a lot. Yeah. They kept a lot of the vats. They kept a lot of the,

190
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:41,040
well, the vats are very important. The vats are important. Um, there's a roasting. You go through

191
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:45,200
like a heat tunnel. This is a very vivid memory I have as a kid. You're talking about like the

192
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:50,240
blurring of reality and fiction. You go through like, uh, the beans are then roasted and you go

193
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:55,200
through like a tunnel. That's probably all of like five degrees warmer than the rest of the building.

194
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:01,040
I was scared to death. The ride would break down in this tunnel and I would be cooked alive

195
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:06,560
because it's, it's, they're blasting hot air at you. And I did hear what's like, Oh yeah, someone,

196
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:11,520
yeah, it's, it's, the ride stopped on us before. And I'm like, what if we're going to really sweat

197
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:16,880
if we break down in that tunnel? And it's like, yeah, it's not, it's a few degrees warmer. Like,

198
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:25,600
it's a trick. Yeah. I'm going to be roasted and sold. Yeah. Mini Jason's Jason chose.

199
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:29,920
And you had so much chocolate on you. It would have like seasoned you, but I will.

200
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:36,560
Say like my, my big feeling is like, why are there not more of these kinds of rides everywhere in

201
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:41,040
the world? That's like when, you know, I went to it as a kid, I was like, Oh, this is great.

202
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:46,560
And then I would go to like the hers potato chip factory or the Ben and Jerry's factory. I'm like,

203
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:51,680
well, I can't even do a little, yeah. Something like, it doesn't seem that hard. Like, and I guess

204
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:56,960
it's my, and also it's not really animatronics weren't as much of a part of it, but in general,

205
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:01,920
like all this stuff, I'm like, why is there not more theme park and animatronic and all that kind

206
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:06,800
of stuff just running around in the world? Like there seems like there's less than there should

207
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:13,280
be. I think it's part of the magic of Chuck E Cheese that in random strip malls that, you know,

208
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:18,720
that there's animatronics clanking around in there, although increasingly less so. But yeah,

209
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:23,920
I totally agree. We're actually very near Mike's apartment where we record this. There is the,

210
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:28,800
there is the, the Burbank mall. Do you know that there was, I forget if we've talked about this

211
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:33,440
really, but there were that the Burbank mall was going to be a thing that Disney built like a

212
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:42,480
shopping dining district that had the great movie ride in it. What? Yeah. You blew the levels out.

213
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:47,280
Level popping exciting. That would be great. We need to do a whole episode about it. We weren't

214
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,880
able to talk about it on the great movie ride episode. Cause our podcast got hijacked. Oh no,

215
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:56,160
that's horrible. Yeah, it was a real mess. But anyway, but yeah, that, that to me that like,

216
00:21:56,160 --> 00:22:01,360
we would have been able to walk to the great movie ride from here. Although it also would have shot

217
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:05,920
up the property values all around this area so much. We wouldn't have been able to remotely

218
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:13,280
afford to live probably anywhere in the 10 mile radius of this surely beloved ride. It's not,

219
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,760
it wouldn't have been replaced by apartments like two years later.

220
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:20,480
It would have been a, like a weird hodgepodge to have like there, the great movie ride, and then

221
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:26,800
essentially downtown Disney meets pleasure Island, like a really weird, there was going to be a

222
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:32,480
restaurant that was a, it's, it, that looked, it was going to be a ship teetering out over the five

223
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:38,240
freeway over like a fake ocean and you would go into the ship, but it would not be a seafood

224
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:44,560
restaurant. It would be like a steak restaurant. What a, what a theme, huh? Surf, surf, surf.

225
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:51,680
Surf and turf. When I was a kid, the local mall had like a clock that like, you know, on the hour,

226
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:56,400
the whole little show of characters would come out, even that kind of stuff. Sure. There should

227
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:01,840
be more of a bit of magic. A little bit of magic. Were you near that? Like, were you near the,

228
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:08,400
again, my geography's up, but the King of Prussia mall, which is like, I think a more spectacular

229
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:14,880
than usual mall in Pennsylvania, but I forget what, uh, I went a lot growing up. It's actually

230
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:22,880
two malls next to each other. And, uh, uh, is the second largest. It's got some weird qualifier.

231
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:27,280
It's it's the mall of America is the biggest in America. This might be like the second biggest

232
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:33,440
shopping complex when you take all the both malls into account. Okay. Whereas they were married at

233
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:39,120
some point. Any magic in there though? Any robots, anything that elevated it? Uh, it did have,

234
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:44,320
it was one of the malls that had a Warner Brothers store. Okay. Pretty good. The one mall was

235
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:48,800
literally like as a kid, I was like, Oh, this is the fancy mall. Cause it had like Bloomingdale's

236
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:53,040
and Neiman Marcus. And then the other mall was like, that's the one I like. It's got the comic

237
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:58,880
book store and the Walden's books in it. Okay. Okay, sure. Uh, more cash. I've taken us off the

238
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:04,960
rails, which on this podcast is even more inappropriate. We don't, we don't, we don't like

239
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:09,520
our tangents. Honestly, we want to discuss our years and facts. Yeah. I was sitting here steaming

240
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:13,600
as we were off the rails and now I'll calm it down. You know, before we get back on though,

241
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:18,160
can I check in about how the, how the candy's affecting everybody? Everybody, anybody getting

242
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:24,240
that sugar high? I'm getting a little riled. I was already a little logie cause I had a big

243
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:30,960
buttermilk donut right before coming here. So logie more of your cool slang words from where

244
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:35,920
Oh, Holly's donuts in beautiful studio city, California, corner of Moore park and to hunger.

245
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:43,120
Great donuts. Wonderful. Oh no. He's giving it a plug. How many forks? Uh, four forks for Holly.

246
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:49,360
All right. Four forks. Did the buttermilk donut go along with your morning glass of buttermilk?

247
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:55,520
Uh, no, I need to have that right before I wake up or I just go to pieces. All right, good.

248
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:00,960
A little warmed up five degrees like the chocolate tunnel. Um, yeah. What else about this,

249
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:05,680
about this ride? You're right that the original, the nineties version seems a much drier and more

250
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:12,640
like more Epcot-y. The music is more like Mu-zack-y. I think the music is kind of,

251
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:19,280
as is characteristic of 2010s music, the current music is just sort of nothing. It is no genre. You

252
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:23,680
know what I mean? Like music and commercials I think was much more dynamic in the seventies,

253
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:28,640
eighties, nineties. Now I, what is it? Do we, do you, do they, they still play the song?

254
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:33,680
They play a little of the song and it's, yeah, they've scaled back. I mean, the,

255
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:39,040
a lot of the vats are still there. I remember there's like a big tray of like endless Hershey

256
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:44,720
kisses at one point. There's like a conveyor belt of those. Um, the roasting tunnel, but yeah,

257
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:52,320
there's a lot more screens, like a lot of rides. There's a screen on the ride. Uh, yeah. And, and,

258
00:25:52,320 --> 00:26:01,040
uh, yeah, a lot more projections stuff at the end. It is kind of a confusing montage of just like

259
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:08,000
people eating chocolate and being at the factory. Like, like pictures are flying by you in a video

260
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,560
tunnel. It's sort of, they, they, I think if I remember correctly in the ride through, they say

261
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:17,440
goodbye. And then you go through that, you just look at photos for a minute and a half.

262
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:21,840
Yeah. You shouldn't say bye in the ride. And then it continues for that long.

263
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:26,720
Yeah. There's also like a weird line. I can't find where I put this now. There, there's a weird line

264
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:31,840
in it. Like where they go like, all right, friends, let's go share some of that goodness.

265
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:38,080
Like the talking of Hershey bar says that at the very end and, uh, it's unnerving. Hey friends,

266
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:45,200
keep buying. Would you? So, uh, what else about this ride? Yeah. I mean, both versions very much

267
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:52,000
products of their time. Apparently in 1982, they had a version and I found a clip of this online,

268
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:58,240
just of the parts that he's in. They tried to put in a bumbling robot, like an annoying bumbling

269
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:03,840
robot and everyone hated it. So they switched it back and it's just a robot who was like,

270
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:08,800
Oh, is that chocolate? I want more chocolate. And what it was not chocolate. Are you like,

271
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:13,600
could wandered into like a bathroom or something? No, I think he literally poochy style at the end,

272
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:18,320
wanders back home planet with chocolate. And they're like, Oh, he was actually an alien.

273
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:25,840
Like it looks like it sucked. So he's the Jar Jar of the Hershey's chocolate world franchise.

274
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:32,400
Um, Susser, do you remember when you exit this ride, what happens, but you get the Hershey.

275
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:36,400
Yeah. You got a little free Hershey. You got a little fun size. Of course. I remember that

276
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:43,040
no matter how many times you ride it in a row, you get that. Yeah. How, what do you do? How

277
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:47,600
many times would you ride it to get it? I think I probably read it like two or three times in a row.

278
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:54,800
Well, also, um, like you guys, I do not like the roller coasters. Oh, I didn't know that. So, uh,

279
00:27:54,800 --> 00:28:00,320
you know, it's one of, uh, it was one of the attractions to really do, uh, cause it was nice

280
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:06,960
and easy, low speeds, free chocolate at the end. And then it also like any, you know, good, uh,

281
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:12,080
theme park ride. It lets out into a gift shop, right? Into a gift shop where they're selling,

282
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:18,960
uh, candy as you'd imagine. And this is though of a different era where certain things are just not

283
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:26,240
available everywhere. So the giant King size Hershey bars, which now you could probably get

284
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:32,480
at a lot of candy stores or online, certainly. But as a kid, this was the only place to,

285
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:39,040
right. You know, where you could buy a huge giant Hershey bar. Um, and even some varieties,

286
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:43,840
like that was the first time I saw the cookies and cream, uh, Hershey bar, which I love.

287
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:50,640
That would be my thought. That was great. Like that moment was a little bit of that Willy Wonka

288
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:56,960
feeling. It really was. Well, cause when you see like a two foot by three foot KitKat package,

289
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:02,000
you're like, Oh, I should get that. It's just going to fucking start to congeal.

290
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:07,200
Like there are million problems. Also the unsatisfying thing you open it up and it's like,

291
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:13,600
Oh, it's just a bunch of little ones. It's just one package. It's a real trick. I mean,

292
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:17,520
they still have that. I mean, there's all these different things that are giant, supposedly candy

293
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:22,160
bars are like giant packages and nerds. And it's just like, they're nerds. Aren't giant.

294
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:27,360
No, they're just regular. Yeah. And there's, and there's multiple packages inside. So it's

295
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:32,800
just a trick. But this is part of the fun of being a kid where your parents won't let you get that

296
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:38,240
because either it's just the thing. It's just a waste of money or they know it's like a scam.

297
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:42,960
But then the idea of it is like the not having it is almost better than being able to have it.

298
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:50,000
Yeah. Yes. Imagine I get my life if I had that huge Hershey. One of the times I went to Hershey

299
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:56,160
park was it was during operation desert storm and the free candy bar they were giving out

300
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:04,960
was called desert bar and it was kind of chocolate manufactured to withstand here. I have it here

301
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:10,640
withstand heat in excess of 140 degrees Fahrenheit. So it's essentially a ration.

302
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:16,960
It's essentially military surplus ration. The operation desert store apparently ended before

303
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:22,000
they could ship most of them. So they wrapped it in camouflage wrapping and sold them very briefly

304
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:30,400
as desert bars. What a name for a food. Do you remember liking or not liking? I do remember like,

305
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:35,440
I didn't remember like noticing a difference. I thought like, wow, so this won't melt. That's

306
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:41,680
crazy. But you asked to be enlisted as soon as you need it. Yeah. I signed up in 1990. I signed up

307
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:47,600
as a child. Six year old mom. I want to serve. You know, that's a little, this is a little bit

308
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:52,560
jumping around in the order of things, but I it's, it's related to the, what is the order?

309
00:30:54,800 --> 00:31:01,520
Well, it's not exactly chronologically through the park. Well, clearly we're covering chocolate

310
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:07,280
world first. And what I'm about to say is more centered around the stadium. But I think, but it's

311
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:16,320
topic wise related to you know, odd you know, evacuations and emergencies that the I read a

312
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:23,280
in like a, like a Hershey history book, part of which was online, that there was a kind of a drop

313
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:28,720
in tourism in the, or in the early eighties. And actually I was just talking to John Daly,

314
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:33,280
who was here talking about Kennywood and he recalls being at Hershey park at that time

315
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:36,800
and thinking, Oh, this is like a worst Kennywood. This is like Kennywood. They don't keep up. Oh

316
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:41,360
yeah. Which feels like I think that might've been the era he was there because it seems like it's

317
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:47,040
okay now. But in the early eighties, I think they were struggling because they had a giant tourism

318
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:54,400
drop in the wake of three mile Island. Oh yeah. Yeah. Only I don't think I, yeah. I don't think

319
00:31:54,400 --> 00:32:00,320
I knew where three mile Island was and it is half an hour away from Hershey, Pennsylvania.

320
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:05,600
And tourists were like people passing through commuters were discouraged from going through

321
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:10,880
Lancaster County if they didn't have to. So Hershey took a big dive and in the immediate

322
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:16,880
candy took a dive for, Oh, if people were worried that it was, there was radiation,

323
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:21,600
any bar you bought at the old end, finally you're getting your Willy Wonka stuff. Like

324
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:25,360
this could turn you into, it could turn you into a giant chocolate Jason. Yeah.

325
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:30,640
Was three mile Island the inspiration for making the candy bars giant?

326
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:38,640
Or maybe that maybe they just ended up giant. And I was going to say, John also told me he did get a

327
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:45,120
giant chocolate bar around that time. It was not a scam and it was good. Yeah. Yeah. And they kept

328
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:49,760
it around for a couple of years and slowly ate and it stayed a couple of years. Yeah. He's like,

329
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:54,080
he said like two years later, he and his brothers are still trying to gnaw at it and it's turning

330
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:58,400
white, but they don't want to like admit defeat. Was it the cookies and cream one? No, no, no,

331
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:02,240
regular. Yeah. It is. Then it would have had it. And it wasn't a transforming bar either.

332
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:07,840
It was a regular chocolate bar. Yeah. Hmm. Maybe, maybe a little bit of nuclear fallout. It's the,

333
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:14,320
it's like the Godzilla effect. Three mile Island fact, one of my college roommates grew up close

334
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:20,800
to three mile Island and he learned either right at the end of high school or like after he graduated

335
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:28,080
the teachers at the school and administration had a code where they, if someone came into the

336
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:36,560
classroom and said, Hey, have you seen Mr. Harvey's red pen? That was code for,

337
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:43,040
there has been an accident at the plant. And the color of the pen meant the severity of the

338
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:49,200
nuclear accident. So it's like green pen, blue pen, red pen. So like if someone came in and

339
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:54,320
said like, have you seen the green pen? That means like, okay, we need to start getting people out of

340
00:33:54,320 --> 00:34:02,480
here. Uh, or we need to shelter in place. That is so terrible. Imagine like having to hear that

341
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:08,960
fret, the one horrible phrase that certain death and having to stay calm in front of a bunch of

342
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:15,920
children. And imagine all those kids being like, Mr. Harvey, hold on to your pen. You're an adult.

343
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:23,760
Third time this year, Mr. Harvey, uh, uh, the, the immediate aftermath also through

344
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:29,440
my island was that the like re like people who were being evacuated, women and children

345
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:35,200
were moved to Hershey park stadium, like all law moved going to the Astra dome in the wake of

346
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:40,960
Katrina. So like, and again, you got to wonder like, were people concerned about that stadium?

347
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:47,120
Do people think like all the seats were going to turn nuclear? Um, yeah. Isn't that weird? Like,

348
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:52,400
yeah, no idea. This like dark side of Hershey park history. Uh, and perhaps the darkest part of all

349
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:58,000
that dark or in some ways that's almost like, that's nice because Hershey was able to rescue.

350
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:03,360
Yes. That they had a big enough space to save those evacuees enough chocolate,

351
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:07,920
the dopamine levels just go through the, where you say them and they called it nuclear chocolate

352
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,480
that would withstand a blast. Yeah. They make a point of updating the names of the

353
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:19,760
chocolate for every disaster that's hurricane chocolate. Uh, but, but while let me say the

354
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:23,840
dark side of the tail though, which is that in, because of this disaster and moving all the

355
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:31,440
refugees, uh, to the stadium, a Billy Joel concert was canceled. So don't go making light of it until

356
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:37,440
you hear the full story. Yeah. It could have, uh, Allentown could have been called Hershey park.

357
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,480
We have ended up with giant heads.

358
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:51,200
The nuclear blast. Uh, all right. Well now that I've, now that I've bummed everyone out,

359
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:55,680
that Billy Joel story, wait, let's go back to, to, uh, wait, we were talking about chocolate

360
00:35:55,680 --> 00:36:01,840
world. Let's get back to the world. Um, the, well, there's other stuff going on. Uh, uh,

361
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:07,600
Hey, the opposite of a refugee situation, something much more fun than that. I saw a great video of a

362
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:13,920
parade happening within an indoor parade in chocolate world with all the characters marching

363
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:20,000
around with them, with a marching band, following them who have collars that look like chocolate

364
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:25,520
splats, like chocolate has melted on top of them. And they are all playing a marching band version

365
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:31,280
of Tio Cruz's dynamite. And it's the most delightful video you could ever see. Yeah.

366
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:40,880
The characters. It's tough. I don't have mixed feelings. I love it. It's not, uh, I mean,

367
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:49,120
look for me, I think maybe, maybe people disagree, but you know, Hershey big rival Mars in the candy

368
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:55,680
world. Yeah. I think maybe people disagree, but Mars is the better candy. I would say what is

369
00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:04,640
Mars M and M's. Yeah. But Reese's Reese's who's peanut butter M and M's are very good. Yeah.

370
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:13,040
I want to say Mars is a Twizzler Twizzler. Oh, really? Yeah. There's a Twizzler character.

371
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:18,240
I miss Twizzler Mars bars, Mars bars. Wait, I didn't mean I meant Twix. Oh,

372
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:25,520
yeah. In terms of stuff, I don't know why as a kid, I convinced myself like, oh yeah,

373
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:29,920
I got to get a bunch of whatchamacallits when I go there. Cause I can't, you can't find those

374
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:35,520
regularly. Of course you can find whatchamacallits in stores. Like Hershey got really good. Hershey

375
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:41,680
is nut rages. Not rages. Take five, take possibly the best. Five is good. Hard to find rollos.

376
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:47,680
Okay. So maybe, maybe there's some disagreement. I would say I prefer Mars. Also Mars has more

377
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:55,840
iconic characters, the M and M's or characters that anyone knows outside of the park. Hershey

378
00:37:55,840 --> 00:38:00,400
just show up and it's like, yeah, like the candy bars are characters. It's like, oh,

379
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:07,280
oh fuck. Like what are their characteristics? They're all the same. Cool. Nice. They all are

380
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:12,800
like, it's not like, well, they didn't Mars put the M and M's in advertising and they successfully

381
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:18,080
made them kind of lovable characters. And if you see the pictures of the Hershey park characters,

382
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:23,520
most of them are terrifying. There's a real, they're just called like kiss. The

383
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:28,880
RC kiss is just called kiss. So her there's her, I wrote these Hershey there's Reese's pieces is

384
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:34,640
called Reese Reese. There's jolly rancher. The Hershey kiss is just called kisses.

385
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:41,440
Right. And then there's your milk duds. Nut radius, nut radius looks like some dad.

386
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:46,240
I saw him referred to his name, his name being nut. Oh, okay. Let's get that on the record.

387
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:50,800
Sorry. There's and then there's a couple different variations of the jolly rancher character.

388
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:55,600
There's one where like the rancher, the jolly rancher here, I'm showing a photo is like the

389
00:38:55,600 --> 00:39:00,800
whole body is the jolly rancher, but then there's some where jolly rancher is just the head is a

390
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:07,200
jolly ranch, which I have. I wanted to save him on my own. I think that's worse. What? Oh, I love

391
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:12,480
him. I don't know. He looks similar to, he looks like Mac tonight a little bit. Maybe that's why I

392
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:16,240
like it, which is your favorite character of all time. Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. But I think,

393
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:23,280
you know, I love again, cause I'm a scary cat like you guys. Uh, the characters were a big part of

394
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:28,800
what I liked about theme parks, but I think a big part of it is having any sort of awareness of the

395
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:33,520
character before you go in and meet them. And then it's like, this is why you have autograph books.

396
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:37,920
Cause it's like, you're meeting a celebrity. This is a kind of treading on, well, you've had the

397
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:45,520
candy, so you're meeting a candy. Yeah. And there's no, yeah, there are no ads. It is only within

398
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:51,200
Hershey park that you meet these characters. Yeah. I love to look the source of my childhood

399
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:56,960
chubbiness directly in the eye, but directly in the face. You did this to me. You did this,

400
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:03,120
you piece of shit. Reese. All that said, if the option is get rid of the characters or keep the

401
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:07,600
use underdeveloped characters, I would say, keep them. I would say, keep them. Would you plus them

402
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:13,040
up? I would plus them up. I wish they, well, my big thing is I think they could be designed a

403
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:18,720
little better, but I also think too, just like incorporate them in some advertising or just like

404
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:22,800
a little bit, get to know these characters a little bit better. Big signs as you're driving

405
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:28,160
into town, they're waving at you. We're seeing you soon. Kisses does not hold a torch to that

406
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:33,600
green M&M. You know what I'm saying? You guys know, fellas, fellas, you know what I'm talking

407
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:41,440
about fellas. Oh, yeah. I'll give you some palm on that one brother. All right. There's a lot of

408
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:46,320
pictures of Hershey, the Hershey character wearing like that backwards, like George Wallace hat.

409
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:55,040
Do you want to think about him at the baseball stadium or he's actually in the park?

410
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:59,840
That's enough. That should be pointed out. So chocolate world and the park and there's a huge

411
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:05,200
state are all in one complex. They're all like sort of on top of each other related. The Hershey

412
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:12,160
syrup also is just called syrup. That's the name. There's also a cuter name there somewhere.

413
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:18,960
You can see a syrup. Hey, syrup, how are you? Sir. Sir, sir up.

414
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:25,120
The I also there's a symphony bar marching around and I'm not sure I know what a symphony bar is.

415
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:30,160
Symphony. I remember because we always used to give it to my parents as stocking stuff or like,

416
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:36,880
oh, this is the fancy. I have the same thing. That's like a fancy bar. It's just slightly

417
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:42,800
better than regular Hershey where it might've had a little toffee in it. Not like full Heath.

418
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:48,080
Yeah, I think it is toffee. It's all that they had at the hotel Hershey.

419
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:53,120
None of this trash regular bar. That's what they rub on you in the spa.

420
00:41:54,560 --> 00:42:02,160
You and your pregnant wife, it'll kill a fetus. So don't, if you're pregnant, don't

421
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:09,360
March for life organizers out against symphony bars, burning a pile of symphony bars,

422
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:16,640
famously toffee, terrible for the womb. I think that's just sheer marketing. That's just sheer,

423
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:22,480
like this is Hershey's adult candy bar. Like, Oh, like the arch deluxe.

424
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:26,400
Yeah. The arch deluxe was the one for adults that failed almost instantly.

425
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:30,880
This, this kind of brings up Hershey, the Hershey hotel. It like you're saying a nice hotel. I feel

426
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:34,880
like this was like, if your parents went out of town and you lived an hour or so away from,

427
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:39,200
maybe they stayed at the Hershey and they didn't necessarily go to the park, but maybe they went

428
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:43,920
out there for the weekend and there's a ton of outlets up there and other tours and nice

429
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:52,080
restaurants. I have like, like, like plug outlets, uh, outlet malls, not just places to plug in here.

430
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:59,200
You know, not just places. That's nice. I had a question actually. Uh, if world of chocolate was

431
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:06,000
the extent of Hershey park, would you guys have still covered it on the podcast? And then extending

432
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:14,800
that would things like the M and M store or Chuck E Cheese or the Coke museum, would those, would

433
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:21,120
you consider those inbounds for this podcast or are those something else? No, I think so. I think

434
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:26,640
they're, they're attractions and, uh, uh, they're silly. They're oddities in the world, but a museum,

435
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:37,920
just some art museum. Fuck no. That's garbage. If a statue isn't alive, I don't want to see it.

436
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:43,120
Yeah. But if there's a store, if there's just an M and M store and they have one, like, like

437
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:47,840
not moving M and M in the middle of it, we'll consider that a robot and we'll talk about,

438
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:54,560
we'll do two hours on it. The, uh, yeah, the M and M store in Vegas has like scheduled sessions with

439
00:43:54,560 --> 00:44:00,800
like, okay, we got blue coming out. So, uh, blue fans that over ran Brown coming up next sort of

440
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:13,280
like a, like the next stripper kind of fashion. I was with, uh, Mike Mitchell and Vegas for a

441
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:24,400
bachelor party and he blew 300 bucks getting a private room with blue. It's five grand to eat

442
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:34,560
me entirely. I had to consume my, consume my entire body. Uh, what, there is a ride and there,

443
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:39,440
there's like a 3d show in chocolate world right now, which I did not. It's called like the mystery

444
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:49,840
is called a Hershey's great chocolate factory mystery in 4d. And it seems to be similar to the

445
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:56,640
turtle talk with crush concept at Epcot and other parks where there is a 3d character who is being

446
00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:02,880
live puppeted somewhere in the back. I watched a video about the special skills that are required

447
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:08,480
to be a, one of the operators of Reese or kiss because you are not only have to be able to

448
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:14,160
improvise and, uh, talk to kids, but also puppeteer this live, a 3d character. It looks pretty

449
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:20,400
impressive. It's a genuinely good animation that renders instantly. I didn't see this video. What,

450
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:26,320
uh, what is Reese's character? Do you guys have an impression? Like, what does he sound like?

451
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:32,320
What's his whole, what's his toad? What does he have an attitude or, um, well the according to,

452
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:38,320
I think he's a little more extreme possibly if I am extrapolating from the Reese, the Reese's

453
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:44,880
extreme cup challenge ride, which is maybe only extreme on the extreme cup challenge ride. Okay.

454
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:48,080
I don't know. I mean, this is again, my problem with the year. It's not clear.

455
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:55,360
He's also not really present in the extreme challenge ride from what I know. So there's,

456
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,600
there's no characterization. And also both of these, I think all of the characters wear

457
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:06,720
brown slacks. They like it isn't, oh, do you want him to be naked? Well, no, but I can't

458
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:12,880
anatomically correct candy genitals. Well, but they don't look, they're there. They are a bar,

459
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:18,080
right? So their, their genital region is already covered by the bar part. Right. So it could be

460
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:25,040
like Mickey where it's just kind of like black legs. Like it, and so it is like their pants feel

461
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:29,840
chocolatey, but they also just seem to be just slacks. They're like, if you look at it,

462
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:34,480
if anybody looks at a picture, I find it a little confusing what they're, what they are anatomically.

463
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:39,280
It's hard because everyone, all the candies are different, but like for instance, Reese,

464
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:44,720
Reese's head is one of the cups. So the cup is pushing out of the package. So that's where

465
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:50,560
Reese's head is, but there's another cup in there. Yeah. And is it another head? No, it's not.

466
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:58,080
Yeah. You think it's just clear that's where it's all your knitting picks. It's snowman logic. Only

467
00:46:58,080 --> 00:47:04,160
the top ball can talk. The torso and the leg balls cannot. I like to think though that it's

468
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:10,000
a separate head he has in there that if you were to rip the package open, he has like, it's like a,

469
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:18,400
another twin in the womb or something. Or like when the muppets all stand on top of each other

470
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:23,360
to be a person. Yeah. To, or when kids act, when the little rascals act like an adult.

471
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:28,560
Do you think like those other, the other Reese's are like squished in there under a big coat? I

472
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:32,720
think that's right. I think that's what I'm thinking. But so, so yeah, it is unclear the

473
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:38,960
biology of the, of the characters. So other than the not understanding the biology, the autonomy,

474
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:45,040
or the personalities, I love the, the Hershey characters. I love them. I haven't seen them in

475
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:50,640
person, but I love them. I think they're great. I like them as silent walk around characters,

476
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:54,400
but in the ride, the weird ones in the ride who talk to you. I'm not feeling like that. Beyond

477
00:47:54,400 --> 00:48:00,560
just existing, what do you like about them? I like the candies. I like seeing the candies with eyes.

478
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:05,280
I like that there's so many different, like, like I was impressed that they go to milk. There's a

479
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:09,920
little milk, that boy running around. They're your friends. They're your friends. You like to see

480
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:16,480
your friends. It's odd. It's so odd. I like that. So I, I haven't really, I think most of that falls

481
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:22,480
into the category of existing. Yes. That's fair. I mean, that's fair, but I, they, I like, I like

482
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:28,800
the way they look. I will say yes. You could definitely imagine them just saying, you know what,

483
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:33,920
a Hershey bar and a Reese's, that's enough. We don't need to do any more than that. And we'll

484
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:41,280
have like seven guys in Hershey costumes, seven guys in Reese's. And you know what, for the

485
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:49,840
fellas, few kisses. Kisses is for dad. They could have just cut it off there. And I do think there

486
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:55,520
is something admirable to the commitment to, oh, we're all of the characters covering every brand.

487
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:59,680
Covering every brand. And I love this Jolly Rancher. You talk about plus it up. I don't know

488
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:04,960
how you plus up this guy. He's already got sunglasses. He's got headphones. He's got gloves.

489
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:11,920
He's got a really long scarf. Cool, cool kicks. What way do you plus up this Jolly Rancher?

490
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:15,040
It looks like a costume that like a high school theater department could make.

491
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:20,400
Sure. It's a budget beast. There's charm to it.

492
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:26,080
I'm a bottomless pit for just characters like this. I mean, I love the Burger King Kids Club.

493
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:27,280
I like those guys.

494
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:33,120
Yeah, but do they have, what do you remember? Wheels's personality or Kid Vid? Like who cares?

495
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:37,520
It's just like, I liked that they existed. I like when a corporation markets to me.

496
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:41,920
I like them like just pandering with like, here, you like some cute shit,

497
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:43,600
don't you kid? And I did. I liked it.

498
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:48,000
Yeah. Well, Cesar, you will learn all of their personalities when you are asked to read the

499
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:54,640
deck to write the film of every single thing we've talked about. I look forward to the Burger King

500
00:49:54,640 --> 00:50:00,560
Kids Club movie, you being strung along with that for seven years and then it getting canceled.

501
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:05,280
Is that how most big budget screenplays are started nowadays? Someone gives you a PowerPoint

502
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:06,720
deck as your inspiration? Yes.

503
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:11,280
You can tell us that. When the podcast is over, I'll show you a bunch.

504
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:17,040
Tantalizing Hollywood inside scoops. You're not getting them out of Susser.

505
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:23,600
Is that why you're stumping for Mars so hard? You're writing the Mars bar movie?

506
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:25,680
Conspicuously silent.

507
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:31,600
I also was like, I'm going to take the bet that one of these characters is,

508
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:35,680
in some regard, Jason-esque and I might vote for Milk Duds.

509
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:40,880
Oh, yes. You should have, first of all, polled us and I would have said Milk Duds in a heartbeat.

510
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:48,720
What if I were to tell you that a young Jason loved his Milk Bars? Milk Duds.

511
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:50,880
I would believe Milk Bars, Milk Duds.

512
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:56,960
Milk Duds. What is the, I just saw it. What's the toffee candy bar that Hershey makes?

513
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:04,160
Is it Honkor? Oh God, this is going to drive me nuts. I have a chart with all the Hershey

514
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:11,680
brands on here. Almond Joys. I like those a lot. Hershey's, I believe, owns Cadbury or owns a part

515
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:18,320
of Cadbury now. People have been asking when will Jason read a list of candy he likes? And here we

516
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:24,560
are. God damn it. But yeah, just a weird little kid. Score, Score Bars. That's Hershey's Chocolate

517
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:30,400
Bar or Chocolate Toffee Bar. And it's just like this weird little kid who's like, I want toffee.

518
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:35,920
They have, in addition to these characters, they have other, they have like holiday characters.

519
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:40,640
They do dress the characters up too, like for Halloween. And there's some pictures of like

520
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:45,360
all the characters wearing like kind of creepy like Zorro masks and stuff, but there's still

521
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:51,520
like, but I'm getting to Christmas time. There's a gingerbread character that's an original character

522
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:58,080
named Gingy that I really like as well. It's funny because ginger is a name. Yes. And it

523
00:51:58,080 --> 00:52:03,600
makes more sense to just call the gingerbread, but it's no, it's Gingy. So Christmas at Hershey

524
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:08,240
Park was a bit, that's when my family would go a lot. That was a common Christmas week off

525
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:13,360
trip for a day. You go up, you spend most of your time at Chocolate World and then the park is free

526
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:17,920
to get into and you would just buy individual tickets for rides because there was only about

527
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:22,880
five rides open. You're really not supposed to run a lot of rides in 30 degree. Well, that was

528
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:28,240
interesting. And maybe this is just all East Coast parks. You guys would know this, but if we wanted

529
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:32,560
to hop on a plane right now and go to Hershey Park, guess what? We couldn't do it. Yeah, it's

530
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:37,840
closed. It's closed. It's closed a lot actually. Cause my wife and I have talked about like,

531
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:44,160
you know, it might be fun one time or on the East Coast, maybe drive up to Hershey and very seldomly

532
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:50,800
seldomly open opens in April until like the fall. And then it's kind of, but even like in April,

533
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:56,720
yeah, it's just weekends at some point. It's not, it's not always open. That is a normal thing,

534
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:01,840
I think for a lot of places like Disneyland used to be closed on Mondays, right? Was it Monday or

535
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:07,920
Tuesday? Like it was maybe both. I think two days early on that used to be common for, you know,

536
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:14,720
people don't need this open 24 seven Magic Mountain right up the highway from here.

537
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:21,760
It just started advertising open 365 days a year, like just this year. But this, yeah,

538
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:27,920
the Six Flags in Chicago was not open year round. Great Adventure was not. And then also the other

539
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:31,440
thing that they use the characters for, I don't know if any of you guys had this in the note, is

540
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:40,080
for determining your height. Yes, this is very fun. Well, Jason, go ahead and talk about it.

541
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:46,400
So yeah, there are, there are not also at a lot of, you know, amusement parks, if you're not above

542
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:53,360
this height, you can't ride this ride. But rather than having that, you know, a certain, you know,

543
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:58,160
thing at different rides, they just, when you get to the park, you got to measure and you got to see

544
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:04,880
which candy you are. There are six categories. That's miniatures. This is the newest high

545
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:13,520
category created in 2005. And that is zero to 36 inches. That's three feet and below.

546
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:19,680
Then you got your kisses. That's between three feet and three foot six. Reese's.

547
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:27,840
That's three, six to four feet. Hershey's four to four, six Twizzler, four, six to five feet,

548
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:33,520
and Jolly Ranchers, five feet and above. So then so rather, they'll just say like,

549
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:38,400
oh, this ride is for Reese's and up and that kind of, that's how they do it.

550
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:43,040
But isn't that isn't a little more complicated to have to remember your height class?

551
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:48,000
Yeah, yeah, way more complicated. I think that, I don't know how it works exactly.

552
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:52,400
Do you remember, but there's something. Well, there's, there's, I think they,

553
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:58,800
there's kind of a chart like at every ride. So they do have, you could do it again at every

554
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:03,360
ride, but you know, it's kind of just, you can see the sign and all that. Right. I mean, it's,

555
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:09,120
that seems fun. I was hoping there'd be more categories. More, even more. Like every three

556
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:13,360
inches, it would be a new one. Yeah. Because there are so many different bars. There's so

557
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:16,960
many different things you may as well use them all. And what a great way to reward somebody

558
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:26,400
who's over seven foot six who comes to the park. There is a swingers club in downtown Hershey,

559
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:31,840
and that's only for symphonies, baby. It's only for symphony bars. That's just for mom and dad.

560
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:38,160
How does Disney do it? Is it just like they rides have a height thing and you have to do it?

561
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:41,520
Yeah, just as a height, but they don't give you like a character or something. Like,

562
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:48,240
are you a Goofy or are you a Donald? Are you a Chip and Dale? Yeah. Are you two inches?

563
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:54,240
Or are you a Groot? Are you big and tall? Or are you baby Groot? Yeah. I think it is fun.

564
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:58,400
Use it like this. Be like the Mickey and Friends parking structure. We talked so much about

565
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:04,640
to. Yeah, it is a little way to bring some color and fun to a dry theme park. And I think it's

566
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:09,920
more fun to be like, oh, I'm a Reese's, not a Hershey rather than I'm just short. I think

567
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:14,320
it's more fun to have a different identity. I feel like though kids would get upset because if you

568
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:19,360
like Reese's better and you like, say your brother is older and he's Reese's, it would be like kind

569
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:22,400
of like, oh, he's Reese's. And then there'll be like kind of a fight because that would be

570
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:26,320
something my sister and I would fight about when we were little. You know, you know, you saw that

571
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:31,920
just by a bunch of fucking Reese's and shoving in the rest. And then they're satisfied. They forgot

572
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:36,800
all about the fight because they're parenting 101. Parenting 101. Just shove some candy in your

573
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:42,720
kid's mouth. Of all the places to fill your kids with candy. I mean, you can't do much better than

574
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:48,720
Hershey Park. It's just everywhere. There's also, do you guys, did you end up looking into the king

575
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:56,320
sized shakes? This is, I think maybe since all of us have been there. I wish I had a photo of it.

576
00:56:56,320 --> 00:57:02,400
Is this about bubbles? No, it's just like, they just have like, at a store called Simply

577
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:09,360
Chocolate, they have a giant mugs, 32 ounces that are just exploding. It's pure milkshake,

578
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:15,360
32 ounces. And then it's exploding with other materials at the top. The one that I saw,

579
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:21,680
it looks completely insane. We'll post a photo, but the description I found on top of the shake,

580
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:27,360
you'll find, this is the Reese's one. You'll find two generous sized pieces of peanut butter pie,

581
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:33,200
as well as two chocolate covered pretzel rods, which my wife didn't recognize when we were

582
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:38,400
looking at these photos. Like are these hot dogs? Are they like plus size Slim Jims? They're so

583
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:44,640
crazy looking, but they're pretzel rods. And then around the rim of the cup is like caked on

584
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:50,960
chocolate frosting when shit is like jammed into the salt, like stuck in sprinkles, Reese's pieces

585
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:58,240
and mini Reese's cups. It is a really insane sight. Oh man. Yeah, there you go. We're looking

586
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:02,640
at one now. These are getting very popular. Yeah, I was gonna say, this is a trend. This is a trend.

587
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:07,840
Any tourist area place has one place, one thing that if you want to go in and have a shake that's

588
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:13,280
5,000 calories, no joke, that you can do it. Yes. Like it'll have a piece of cheesecake sticking out

589
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:17,440
and then there's a full birthday cake sticking out of the piece of cheesecake. And it's just,

590
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:22,960
it's insane. It's an alive gingerbread man. He can speak. He has feelings, but you have to kill him.

591
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:31,120
Please talk about this. Also in the park has a s'mores stand where they will make you a

592
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:35,840
traditional s'mores like, and you can walk around and eat it, or you can design your own s'mores

593
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:39,760
where it's like, Hey, what if instead of graham crackers, it was chocolate chip cookies. And what

594
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:47,360
if instead of a Hershey bar, it's a Reese's cup. So they'll just cram. Now I was also looking into

595
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:53,120
the rest of the dining and it seems like these days, at least, it's just like chains. It's like,

596
00:58:53,920 --> 00:59:00,400
what's that Italian familia, pizza, familiar. And normally I think I would not like that,

597
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:05,280
but I like that at Hershey, they're like, look, just like you need the calories. So just get

598
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:12,000
some chain for food, but dessert. That's where we shine. Well, there is a Dunkin Donuts as soon as

599
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:16,880
you walk into the park. Well, you need your coffee. You got to be allowed to sell donuts.

600
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:24,240
That is true. They should only have like bagels, coffee, breakfast sandwiches, no donuts.

601
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:27,840
Did you guys have a treat that you would get regularly when you would go? Like,

602
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:30,560
is there something you would go like, I'm going to go to Hershey park. I'm going to get this

603
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:34,480
specific thing. Like at Disneyland, you do a Dole whip or everyone has their own treat.

604
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:40,240
Uh, I either like a chocolate milkshake or just pure Hershey's chocolate milk. Like Hershey's

605
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:44,320
chocolate milk is very sweet. But you would, you get like a little carton, but you get like a

606
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:50,640
gallon, just like cart, a gallon of chocolate milk around making it there or, or just like,

607
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:54,000
yeah, a carton or a chocolate milkshake or something like that. I was a big chocolate boy.

608
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:59,040
Still am sure. I'm a chocolate man now. This is funny. Cause like I, as a kid, I don't know about

609
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:07,360
you guys. I was not a chocolate boy. I was more of a Wonka type candy. I like sprees. I like sweet

610
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:14,560
tarts. I like nerds. I like the, uh, quickly canceled dweebs. I like tartan tiniest. They

611
01:00:14,560 --> 01:00:21,200
were like nerds. It's it's the cracked to mad magazine. Yes. Yes. Slightly different name.

612
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:25,520
Tartan tiniest, which are, uh, which were discontinued. But I, when I would go to Disney,

613
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:29,840
I would always get a character head full of tartan tiniest. Like I would get goofy,

614
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:33,680
a plastic goofy head and it was full of tartan tiniest and I would eat it. It's like my favorite

615
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:39,280
thing in the world. I realized recently some other company bought the right to tartan tiniest and

616
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:44,480
they're making them again. I need to order, but the only option is to order like a 10 pound bag

617
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:50,960
of tartan tiniest. So I like chocolate fine, but it was not my go-to ever. You have a halo as

618
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:56,240
you're talking about this. You have a literal glow. I am, I am lifted off the couch. Ages of

619
01:00:57,040 --> 01:01:00,640
streaming from your face. You're younger. We went to the movies the other night, Mike,

620
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:06,160
and you got a bag of bulk candy or like a vat and it was all gummy. Yes. Well, yes, I, I like

621
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:11,200
chocolate more now, but yes, before when we go to universal city walk, uh, I always go into the

622
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:15,440
it's sugar candy store, which is, you know, it's a candy store. That's got a lot of those fun,

623
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:21,040
big candy bars, but it's also a little sexy. Let's be honest. You know, there's, there's these weird,

624
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:27,360
they're a lot of edible underwear, a lot of edible underwear, a lot of like a bikini top,

625
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:32,400
uh, like it's candy necklace, like candy necklace candy, but it's a bikini top. And you're like,

626
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:36,960
what practical use does this have? Uh, and then there's like pictures of like a school

627
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:41,120
girl with a lollipop. It's not as aggressive as some of these Vegas candy stores that are

628
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:46,480
like trying to be like, you know what candy makes you horny or whatever. But so yeah,

629
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:48,880
so your asshole,

630
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:58,880
I was just gonna say that. Yeah. For a while my wife and I, this, our go-to gift was actually

631
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:05,600
getting, uh, stupid stuff from that, uh, sugar candy store, like the giant thing of nerves that

632
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:10,800
we talked about or other things. And then we did, uh, give someone a gift from there and they just

633
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:17,360
hated it so much. And so then we stopped. Okay. Just like literate physically literal or did it

634
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:22,080
make them sick? No, they were like, why would you get this? This is stupid. Oh geez. Pretty bad

635
01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:27,520
manners. Honestly. Uh, Mike, were you saying that you, do you just like buy edible underwear and

636
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:33,840
then eat it during a movie? During a movie. I had a film at the city walk, stadium seating.

637
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:39,200
I put it on and I eat it off my body. Much higher markup than just buying bulk smarties.

638
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:43,680
I don't know why you're doing this, but there's no challenge in that. Yeah. That's, it's fun.

639
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:48,160
It's a fun thing to do. Um, yeah. So my point was just the Jason's point was that I still,

640
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:55,680
uh, favor the, the colorful sugary fruit ish, fruitish candies over the chocolate candy. So

641
01:02:55,680 --> 01:03:01,840
then, uh, if there was going to be a theme park of that, is there a brand that you trust the most in

642
01:03:01,840 --> 01:03:07,040
that world? Would it be sweet tart land? It's been, most of these candies have been bought by

643
01:03:07,040 --> 01:03:13,120
the Wonka candy, which is a part. I know it's crazy. That's all Nestle. Nestle owns Wonka now.

644
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:18,800
So there should be a, I mean, there's been talk, I think of universal studios before.

645
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:24,080
Is that what you're saying? Or are you just pointing at me to point? No, I'm not pointing

646
01:03:24,080 --> 01:03:30,080
at you at all. Your finger was pointing at me like that. Oh, I was just kind of adjusting my grip.

647
01:03:30,080 --> 01:03:35,280
Mike sugar high. The Hershey kicked in things. I'm crazy. Uh, so yeah, there's been a rumor

648
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:40,160
universal studios will make a Wonka ride, but I mean, you could do a full park. You want to do

649
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:44,640
a full park of universal tooth, some chocolate factory, which Mike and I have both been to is

650
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:50,560
very clearly a, a non licensed Willy Wonka factory. It's another place where you can get that

651
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:55,600
crazy shake. Um, and it, and I'll show you the photo of it, but it's, it's clearly, I think

652
01:03:55,600 --> 01:04:02,800
they were sued by whoever owns sued by the doll estate. Yeah. Um, so yeah, I would want that if

653
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:08,400
that park existed though, I don't want that Wonka candy Wonka. I don't like him. He feels off.

654
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:15,840
Oh yeah. Uh, yeah, that's a rip off. Yeah. I see. Uh, yeah, that's a question is who would the

655
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:22,320
character be? You want Gene Wilder. You don't want to certainly don't want Johnny Depp, but whoever

656
01:04:22,320 --> 01:04:28,000
is the next Wonka, maybe that's going to be like Jared Leto Wonka. I'm assuming that's who it'll

657
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:35,280
be. Oh God, it has to be. There's only one quirky actor today. And it's a, do you remember the weird,

658
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:38,800
like, I think we, I think a couple of us passed around this bizarre trailer of, uh,

659
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:46,080
Tom and Jerry in Willy Wonka. Yes. That was just the original movie. It seemed like all the scenes

660
01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:49,520
and songs from the original movie. They've made a few of, they've also made a Wizard of Oz,

661
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:55,920
one of the same genre where the whole movie happens, but Tom and Jerry are just there in

662
01:04:55,920 --> 01:05:00,800
the background, kind of a Rosencrantz and Gilderoy. This is no, they've made multiple

663
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:04,480
of their just commenting on the, yeah, it's a nice song. She's thinking about being over the rainbow.

664
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:14,480
Munchkin hang itself. Yeah. And I don't quite get why someone explained to me why they were like,

665
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:18,800
it was cheaper to make that or something, but it doesn't, it didn't really make sense to me. Yeah.

666
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:24,160
Like wife, why Warner Brothers had to jam these properties together and is Tom and Jerry even?

667
01:05:24,160 --> 01:05:30,400
Well, I understand why the jam them together because that's just like, you know, that's what

668
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:36,960
all entertainment is now. But, um, but it's still weirder and shadier. But this is just like the

669
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:42,880
movie is happening and they're not even interacting with the movie. It's not like they're like, Hey,

670
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:47,920
like I'm Dorothy, who are you? I'm Tom, I'm Jerry. It's almost, you know, it's almost like mystery

671
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:52,640
science theater, except they're there. Right. It's like almost commenting. Are they fighting

672
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:57,840
during the movie or they just literally watching? No, I think they're fighting sometimes, but

673
01:05:57,840 --> 01:06:02,720
silently it's like they're ghosts. It's like they are ghosts who cannot interact with the story.

674
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:08,800
They're in limbo. It's Tom and Jerry in limbo, witnessing these events with all the unbaptized

675
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:17,120
babies. Yeah. We should have mentioned that. Yeah. Millions and millions. Do Tom and Jerry talk like

676
01:06:17,120 --> 01:06:23,920
in the nineties movie? Yeah, they do. Right. Or maybe they don't. I don't know. We got to look

677
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:29,520
into this. We got a recent, no three stars. Okay. Well, we know researcher Tom and Jerry direct to

678
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:34,000
streaming. Fair to complain about not being researched. That was a tangent.

679
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:40,720
Yeah. That's true. The other basic facts about the theme park itself is pretty, once you outside

680
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:45,360
of the Hershey characters walking around and like some of the chocolate based treat stands,

681
01:06:45,360 --> 01:06:52,000
pretty standard amusement park, very coaster heavy nowadays. The coasters are good. Yeah.

682
01:06:52,000 --> 01:07:00,160
I've written a few has some historicals to the super duper looper. Very fun name. In Halloween,

683
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:06,960
it comes to super boo per looper. One of the first full looping coasters on the East coast,

684
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:12,560
the comment, a great wooden coaster. Here's something I was reading though,

685
01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:18,800
that it's pretty uncomfortable to ride the pretty rough ride. They have a Skyway still

686
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:24,000
sort of like Disneyland used to. They, they have like, but it's like just a bench almost.

687
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:29,600
This is a terrifying, it's like a bench you sit in and you see an aerial view of some of the park

688
01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:36,400
and a lap bar. I'm amazed they keep it around. Right. Right. And the lawless lands outside

689
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:41,600
Disney, you can still do this. Yeah. There is a monorail that just does a round trip,

690
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:46,960
sort of around part of the park that has giant, uh, blue cross. The insurance company is the

691
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:52,800
current sponsors of here's giant blue cross locos. That's pretty ballsy that Hershey is bringing in

692
01:07:52,800 --> 01:08:02,720
outside sponsors sponsored out. Yeah. Uh, the big ride, the big dark ride, like along our

693
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:07,360
interest lines is the Reese's extreme cup challenge. I'm going to, I'm going to jot in

694
01:08:07,360 --> 01:08:13,280
here. You see Reese's that drives it's Reese's right. What does everyone say? Does everyone say

695
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:21,520
Reese's I'm Reese's Reese's pieces, but that's not right. Yeah. Well, wait, I grew up in a place

696
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:26,560
where you, what would you call a small body of water? Uh, that might be behind your house.

697
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:33,200
Pond. No, that's like, it's like a creek, a Creek. Yeah. Uh, we grew up calling that a Creek.

698
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:40,000
What's wrong too. Well, we also say wooder in Pennsylvania, but that's just, that's just the

699
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:45,360
dialect. Yeah. Creek is a dialect thing. Reese's is not a dialect. It's even, it's pronouncing the

700
01:08:45,360 --> 01:08:51,920
word it's like a fudgical or it's like a Sherbert Sherbert is wrong. Sherbert is the right way to

701
01:08:51,920 --> 01:09:01,200
say it. I say Sherbert. Sure. There's no R in Sherbet. I'm outnumbered here. I guess PCs is fun.

702
01:09:01,200 --> 01:09:08,240
It is fun. It's like nails on a chalkboard to me. I'm more on your side, Mike. Yeah. It's I find it

703
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:13,280
a little cutesy, a little cloying. This appears to be the last episode of the podcast. This is

704
01:09:13,280 --> 01:09:21,680
the maddest we've been at each other. It's spewed over the pronunciation. Um, you know, you guys,

705
01:09:21,680 --> 01:09:30,320
again, uh, we talked about the ET, uh, you know, what you guys did. Do you think now that they're

706
01:09:30,320 --> 01:09:36,080
getting rid of it at some of the universals, Hershey could steal it because of moving over.

707
01:09:38,320 --> 01:09:44,400
Oh, wow. That's very good. That's a good idea. This is why you get paid the big bucks.

708
01:09:45,280 --> 01:09:51,600
This is yeah, this is a very good idea. I don't know if you guys know that story, but, uh,

709
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:57,600
Spielberg wanted M and M's and M and M's would not sign off on that. What a bunch of fucking idiots.

710
01:09:57,600 --> 01:10:02,080
Yeah. I mean, they really, they blew it. And so that's why it was Reese's and kind of put

711
01:10:02,080 --> 01:10:09,680
Reese's PCs on the map. Uh, so it's very important to the Hershey company and Reese's in general,

712
01:10:09,680 --> 01:10:15,680
ET. I think it's a good idea. I think it's a good idea. It will certainly be the best ride at the

713
01:10:15,680 --> 01:10:22,080
park instantly upon. I think that you can certainly fit a couple of the characters on the ride. Like

714
01:10:22,080 --> 01:10:28,080
Reese maybe shows up on the green planet when ET goes home. Oh, you start putting it because,

715
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:32,240
you know, you guys were complaining that the green planet characters were not that good.

716
01:10:32,240 --> 01:10:36,320
So yeah, you put some of these better characters like Reese. And honestly

717
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:40,320
answering questions of the movie, why did he love those Reese's so much? That's right.

718
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:47,600
His money. Wow. I could help out ET. And very much like Rogue One, you know,

719
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:54,080
solved some kind of plopable questions in Star Wars. Now the ET ride will solve them.

720
01:10:54,080 --> 01:10:57,760
Reese, it's you. I ate something that was like you.

721
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:03,360
Yeah. Look, that's great. Do they have a Reese's pieces walk around character? I don't think they

722
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:08,800
do. I don't know. It's just the cup. It's just the cup. So then he's too busy on the green planet.

723
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:16,000
Reese, I hate your droppings on earth. On the green planet, those are what he poops.

724
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:23,840
Wait, is that canon? Does Reese the cup poop? I'm Reese's pieces. Again, anything you think

725
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:28,800
of about any of these characters is canon because they don't have one. We are the first ever to

726
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:36,240
think or talk about any of this. Well, they have the Reese's extreme cup challenge, a ride sort of

727
01:11:36,240 --> 01:11:42,480
like Buzz Lightyear, except it's themed to extreme sports and you are not shooting at people or

728
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:48,160
creatures. You're shooting around human beings doing extreme sports. Doing kick flips. Doing

729
01:11:48,160 --> 01:11:52,960
kickflips. Yeah, it's confusing. When I watched the ride through, I didn't really, there are

730
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:59,280
targets, but I only, all you can see are like skateboarders and X Games people jumping around,

731
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:05,200
but you're not supposed to shoot them. They are not enemies. They're sending you out to shoot

732
01:12:05,200 --> 01:12:12,720
past. They chose an extreme sports event to have a shooting match concurrent with Enduring.

733
01:12:13,360 --> 01:12:17,840
There's also animatronic commentators, like sports commentators.

734
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:21,200
Who look like mannequins. They look like mannequins.

735
01:12:21,200 --> 01:12:27,680
Yeah, the sports people are more like wooden cutouts, but then there's like fleshed out,

736
01:12:27,680 --> 01:12:34,560
dressed up sort of Ron Burgundy-ish announcers who at the end, when you get to the wrong,

737
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:40,000
when you get to the end, they say like, well, and at the end here, it's, I guess,

738
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:44,960
hey, I guess we figured out there's no wrong way to play Reese's Extreme Cup Challenge.

739
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:47,680
Yeah, it's a little tenuous.

740
01:12:47,680 --> 01:12:50,400
Modify the slogan.

741
01:12:52,160 --> 01:12:56,720
Yeah, it's ironic that Hershey, a company very much in the food preparation business,

742
01:12:56,720 --> 01:12:58,800
has such a half-baked ride.

743
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:01,680
God damn.

744
01:13:01,680 --> 01:13:06,080
Should we dig in on how to make this ride better? Like, what do you think?

745
01:13:06,080 --> 01:13:07,120
It's a good idea.

746
01:13:07,120 --> 01:13:07,680
Yeah, yeah.

747
01:13:07,680 --> 01:13:08,560
Can I swipe this one a little bit?

748
01:13:10,240 --> 01:13:16,000
Well, why don't the targets look like, I mean, I get why they don't look like Reese's cups.

749
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:20,880
I get why they don't look like that because it's probably too dark to pop.

750
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:22,560
Because you're not shooting Reese's cups.

751
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:23,200
No, you're not.

752
01:13:23,200 --> 01:13:23,520
Right.

753
01:13:23,520 --> 01:13:28,800
So why not just make it look like the rectangular wrappers and then have the target like in the

754
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:31,040
center of the wrap, I guess, then you're shooting.

755
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:35,280
Well, how about this? How about this? How about it? How about it's the wrappers?

756
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:38,800
It's like a Reese's candy in the wrapper. You shoot it, the wrapper falls off.

757
01:13:39,440 --> 01:13:40,000
That's fine.

758
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:40,880
That's better.

759
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:43,520
Yeah, like you're trying to expose the delicious candy and then like,

760
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:46,560
maybe you have like a swarm of kids go and eat it after that or something.

761
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:49,840
Yeah. Now, yeah. So are we getting rid of the extreme sports?

762
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:50,640
Yeah, let's get rid of that.

763
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:52,560
I don't think yes. I don't think that's held up well.

764
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:53,920
I don't think that tracks.

765
01:13:53,920 --> 01:13:55,920
Probably from the X Games or something.

766
01:13:55,920 --> 01:13:59,120
Well, they put it in in, they put it in in 2006,

767
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:01,760
which is a little late to catch on to extreme sports.

768
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:04,480
Also, were the X Games ever popular?

769
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:07,120
There was a year, I think.

770
01:14:07,120 --> 01:14:08,560
When was the time period?

771
01:14:08,560 --> 01:14:12,080
So you're shooting it so that the kids can have the candy?

772
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:14,000
Yeah, I think so.

773
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:19,440
So maybe it's like someone has stolen all of the Reese's and you're like liberating the candy,

774
01:14:19,440 --> 01:14:21,680
but also the competitive element.

775
01:14:21,680 --> 01:14:22,160
Yeah, that's true.

776
01:14:22,160 --> 01:14:25,360
Maybe it's very thinly veiled evil M&M's.

777
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:28,720
Oh, that's interesting.

778
01:14:28,720 --> 01:14:30,960
Oh, like M&M's. Like they're slightly off.

779
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:32,320
What if they're evil vegetables?

780
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:35,360
Yeah, that I feel like it's too much for them.

781
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:37,440
Yeah, like Michelle Obama will be after them.

782
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:39,840
Right. But no, Melania would love it.

783
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:42,960
Melania hates vegetables.

784
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:46,560
I hate them. We should bully them. They're the only things we should bully.

785
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:49,760
Reese's fetus is the greatest meal for a child.

786
01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:51,760
I don't know if we solved it. It's a tough one.

787
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:55,120
What if you shoot off the clothing of the characters?

788
01:14:56,720 --> 01:14:57,840
You mean the rappers?

789
01:14:57,840 --> 01:15:01,040
Yeah, so the rappers are their clothes or their skin?

790
01:15:01,040 --> 01:15:04,080
Oh, that's well, if it's their clothes, this is okay.

791
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:07,040
But if it's their skin is certainly not. It's certainly problematic.

792
01:15:07,040 --> 01:15:10,960
But like Reese's naked and he covers his lower head, his lower cup.

793
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:13,520
Because you shot his clothes out.

794
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:16,160
You don't end up looking at any chocolate genitals.

795
01:15:16,160 --> 01:15:18,480
They cover up out of embarrassment right away.

796
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:20,240
Yes, it's just you're seeing the lower ball.

797
01:15:20,240 --> 01:15:24,960
Why are we shaming these characters and putting them in embarrassment?

798
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:26,160
We're brainstorming here.

799
01:15:26,160 --> 01:15:31,840
Are we sure about no like because I think maybe blasting apart heads of broccoli

800
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:36,160
and cauliflower and relieving only the sweet chocolate.

801
01:15:36,160 --> 01:15:38,160
In Trump's America, that is a good idea.

802
01:15:38,720 --> 01:15:42,320
And in Pennsylvania is often a red state.

803
01:15:42,320 --> 01:15:48,080
I do think Hershey Park, you know, I think that just like the cigarette industry,

804
01:15:48,080 --> 01:15:53,200
like kind of had a reckoning of like advertising this unhealthy lifestyle for kids.

805
01:15:53,200 --> 01:15:54,720
I do feel like Hershey Park maybe.

806
01:15:54,720 --> 01:15:55,920
Doesn't want that.

807
01:15:55,920 --> 01:16:00,800
For a reckoning of if they're like too much promoting an unhealthy lifestyle.

808
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:02,560
Oh, well, why not then you just said it.

809
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:06,720
Let's unite against the common enemy and there's a bunch of cigarettes around.

810
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:08,960
Yeah, that's good.

811
01:16:08,960 --> 01:16:11,760
You're shooting cigarettes and only chocolates remain.

812
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:12,400
Yeah, that's good.

813
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:12,640
All right.

814
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:13,680
Well, we solved it, I think.

815
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:20,240
Just tobacco, like loosely like hand wrapped tobacco cigarettes blasting apart into embers.

816
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:21,520
Cool.

817
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:23,360
Hey, that's a good message to that ride.

818
01:16:23,360 --> 01:16:23,760
Yeah.

819
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:27,680
Yeah. Can we talk a little about Milton S. Hershey?

820
01:16:27,680 --> 01:16:28,480
Absolutely.

821
01:16:28,480 --> 01:16:28,720
Yeah.

822
01:16:28,720 --> 01:16:30,400
I learned a great fact about him.

823
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:31,040
The founder.

824
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:33,520
I'm going to assume.

825
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:35,200
Are you coming out with something dark?

826
01:16:35,200 --> 01:16:36,320
Do you want to start?

827
01:16:36,320 --> 01:16:36,720
All of these.

828
01:16:36,720 --> 01:16:37,920
I got a couple dark things.

829
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:39,040
We could start with a lighter.

830
01:16:39,040 --> 01:16:43,760
All of these captains of industry of that time period had some sort of darkness.

831
01:16:43,760 --> 01:16:45,760
His middle name is Snavely.

832
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:47,280
I'd like to point that out.

833
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:49,200
I mean, that's could be a more evil name.

834
01:16:49,200 --> 01:16:50,320
He asked for Snavely?

835
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:52,160
But is there evil stuff with him?

836
01:16:52,160 --> 01:16:56,160
Because I feel like I'm probably watching a lot of self-company produced stuff.

837
01:16:56,160 --> 01:16:59,280
I'd dig for like five minutes to find it.

838
01:16:59,280 --> 01:17:03,040
It didn't take a long time, but most of it is just like, what a great philanthropist,

839
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:05,680
always giving to charity and the charity still exists.

840
01:17:05,680 --> 01:17:07,520
A lot of charities with his name on it.

841
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:09,440
But he owned the town essentially.

842
01:17:09,440 --> 01:17:13,680
He built the park for his employees to have a recreational space.

843
01:17:13,680 --> 01:17:14,400
Which is nice.

844
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:14,800
That's nice.

845
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:18,000
A little product of his time, you know, company down.

846
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:18,400
Yes.

847
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:19,440
You know, yeah.

848
01:17:19,440 --> 01:17:24,960
Kohler, Wisconsin, you know, which my parents have been to and have returned to.

849
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:26,800
Several trips to Kohler.

850
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:27,440
Where?

851
01:17:27,440 --> 01:17:28,640
Kohler, Wisconsin.

852
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:29,120
Wow.

853
01:17:29,120 --> 01:17:29,360
Really?

854
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:30,240
You've been to Kohler?

855
01:17:30,240 --> 01:17:30,560
Yep.

856
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:31,600
What'd you do in Kohler?

857
01:17:32,160 --> 01:17:39,920
My dad went to a conference there and he brought my whole family along for a family vacation.

858
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:40,320
And you know what?

859
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:41,920
We had a great time and we went back.

860
01:17:41,920 --> 01:17:42,560
Wow.

861
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:44,080
You returned to Kohler.

862
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:45,040
Who built Kohler?

863
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:47,120
The Kohler toilets.

864
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:48,560
Oh, Kohler.

865
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:49,600
Kohler, oh, okay.

866
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:51,440
I'm a huge fan of their products.

867
01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:53,840
They make a fine product.

868
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:57,920
I honestly was very loyal to Kohler toilets for years.

869
01:17:58,560 --> 01:17:59,760
Ride or die for Kohler.

870
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:00,000
Yeah.

871
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:05,600
Which now that there's a good example of a place that should have a factory tour that's

872
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:06,240
a little more fun.

873
01:18:06,240 --> 01:18:07,440
They do have like a...

874
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:08,480
Is there a talking toilet?

875
01:18:08,480 --> 01:18:12,480
They have a museum of toilets in Kohler, which is kind of fun.

876
01:18:12,480 --> 01:18:12,960
But yes.

877
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:14,880
I'm going to book some plane tickets right now.

878
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:16,640
It should definitely be plussed up.

879
01:18:16,640 --> 01:18:18,000
There could be a talking toilet.

880
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:22,320
There should be like a 25 year old behind a wall that makes the toilet talk and talks

881
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:23,440
to kids that come in.

882
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:24,800
And you've got a built in...

883
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:25,280
Oh, sorry.

884
01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:27,200
Put your waste in my mouth.

885
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:32,080
Yeah, he just says, put your waste in my mouth over and over again.

886
01:18:32,080 --> 01:18:32,960
It's food to me.

887
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:33,440
I love it.

888
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:35,840
Nothing wrong with that.

889
01:18:36,640 --> 01:18:39,600
And you've got a built in female character with Miss Biday.

890
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:43,040
Serves up, seats down.

891
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:50,160
We're saying Milton Snape made her own town.

892
01:18:51,520 --> 01:18:52,000
Here's a...

893
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:52,720
What is like...

894
01:18:53,360 --> 01:18:58,400
Well, he was almost on the Titanic.

895
01:18:58,960 --> 01:18:59,200
Whoa.

896
01:18:59,200 --> 01:19:00,160
That was not bad.

897
01:19:00,160 --> 01:19:00,640
Not bad.

898
01:19:00,640 --> 01:19:01,520
So yeah, so there's a business...

899
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:04,560
Something business came up and they had to cancel their tickets.

900
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:05,520
So they did not.

901
01:19:05,520 --> 01:19:06,000
And they...

902
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:06,640
Seth MacFarlane.

903
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:08,640
Seth MacFarlane, it was time.

904
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:16,720
Oh God, what would happen if Seth MacFarlane had been on one of those planes and Milton

905
01:19:16,720 --> 01:19:18,800
Hershey had been on the Titanic?

906
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:19,280
Butterfly effect, man.

907
01:19:19,280 --> 01:19:21,840
They might not have made Hershey's with almonds.

908
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:22,320
That's true.

909
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:25,040
The mutual, the combined list.

910
01:19:26,720 --> 01:19:34,240
Milton S. Hershey though, did crush the workers union hopes.

911
01:19:34,240 --> 01:19:35,120
Oh yeah.

912
01:19:35,120 --> 01:19:35,760
He brought a lot.

913
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:37,920
I mean, but that, I guess it's dark, but you're right.

914
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:39,120
It's a product of the time.

915
01:19:39,120 --> 01:19:44,320
Disney also famously hated unions and thought his workers were communists.

916
01:19:44,320 --> 01:19:46,960
So there goes our Hershey Park comps.

917
01:19:49,040 --> 01:19:50,960
They were writing our names on them right now.

918
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:51,760
Let's get to this.

919
01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:53,600
I sent an email to Hershey.

920
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:54,080
Okay.

921
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:55,920
I said, hey, we're a podcast.

922
01:19:55,920 --> 01:19:57,280
We talk theme parks.

923
01:19:57,280 --> 01:19:59,920
We would love to come cover something or talk...

924
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:00,720
No response.

925
01:20:00,720 --> 01:20:02,640
Did you say that Evan Susser was going to be the guest?

926
01:20:02,640 --> 01:20:03,920
I didn't say Evan Susser.

927
01:20:03,920 --> 01:20:07,600
This is weeks ago before we even had booked Evan Susser as the guest.

928
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:07,760
Yeah.

929
01:20:07,760 --> 01:20:08,880
But there's no response.

930
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:10,480
So I, you know what?

931
01:20:10,480 --> 01:20:11,440
Let's rip it up.

932
01:20:11,440 --> 01:20:12,640
Let's rip them up.

933
01:20:12,640 --> 01:20:13,120
Fuck them.

934
01:20:13,120 --> 01:20:13,760
Yeah.

935
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:14,720
Is there anything else about...

936
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,560
So when they originally, it was just sort of a park.

937
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:19,360
It was like a time.

938
01:20:19,360 --> 01:20:23,440
It wasn't a full theme park or anything, but this is like in the early, like 1908 or something.

939
01:20:23,440 --> 01:20:24,160
Something very...

940
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:26,320
And they had like one merry-go-round.

941
01:20:26,320 --> 01:20:31,120
They had a baseball team and they had a Hershey, the Hershey baseball team.

942
01:20:31,120 --> 01:20:36,800
Like this was at the opening of the park, beat the Crescent Club team 13 to one, which

943
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:43,280
I'm suspicious that this wasn't a set up, like a Washington General situation where Milton

944
01:20:43,280 --> 01:20:48,640
S. Hershey was like, and then we'll have the team win in a resounding victory.

945
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:48,880
Yeah.

946
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:49,120
Yeah.

947
01:20:49,120 --> 01:20:49,600
Yeah.

948
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:51,280
Wasn't that like the toothpaste company?

949
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:52,960
No, Crescent.

950
01:20:52,960 --> 01:20:53,600
Crescent Club.

951
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:54,400
I don't know actually what that...

952
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:55,920
From Harrisburg, I think, right?

953
01:20:55,920 --> 01:20:56,640
The competing team from Harrisburg.

954
01:20:56,640 --> 01:20:57,920
Yeah, I think that's right.

955
01:20:57,920 --> 01:20:59,360
They probably, people are very...

956
01:20:59,360 --> 01:21:01,040
Harrisburg sucks so much ass.

957
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:02,720
Like no one has good...

958
01:21:02,720 --> 01:21:03,920
Everyone's just tired.

959
01:21:03,920 --> 01:21:06,080
So you think they just lost for fair and square?

960
01:21:06,080 --> 01:21:07,120
I think they probably lost.

961
01:21:07,120 --> 01:21:07,600
You're defending Milton.

962
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:10,320
Harrisburg is our state capital and it's such a nothing...

963
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:12,560
Like many state capitals, it's a nothing town.

964
01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:15,840
Sorry Harrisburg, I'm roasting your ass.

965
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:20,240
So yeah, it's nothing too crazy, but a lot of charities...

966
01:21:20,240 --> 01:21:20,960
There's some like...

967
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:25,120
The charity is right now, I think embroiled in some sort of like scandal where they're

968
01:21:25,120 --> 01:21:26,640
giving money to the Republican party.

969
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:29,680
But I think that's about it as far as...

970
01:21:30,400 --> 01:21:36,000
The Republican party, I believe famously has like a year long retreat, or not a year

971
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:41,200
long, like a retreat once a year, most recently in the news, because a bunch of them were

972
01:21:41,200 --> 01:21:43,280
on a train and there was a train accident.

973
01:21:44,320 --> 01:21:45,440
Oh, that was going there?

974
01:21:45,440 --> 01:21:48,640
Going to like this congressional retreat, I think.

975
01:21:48,640 --> 01:21:52,800
I believe in the past, a number of times that retreat has been at the Hershey hotel.

976
01:21:53,360 --> 01:21:56,080
But this year, this recent train accident was not going to Hershey.

977
01:21:56,080 --> 01:21:58,160
West Virginia or Virginia or something.

978
01:21:58,160 --> 01:21:58,800
Gotcha.

979
01:21:58,800 --> 01:21:59,360
Okay, okay.

980
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:02,640
So there's some darkness around.

981
01:22:02,640 --> 01:22:08,080
Hershey has convention and meeting facilities in abundance, if you're looking for that sort

982
01:22:08,080 --> 01:22:08,400
of thing.

983
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:09,760
Great concert venue.

984
01:22:09,760 --> 01:22:11,200
That's like the main...

985
01:22:11,200 --> 01:22:12,800
Like, did you guys see concerts there?

986
01:22:13,440 --> 01:22:13,920
No.

987
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:14,880
No, a little too far.

988
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:18,880
But for that part of the state, it is a very popular venue for big acts.

989
01:22:18,880 --> 01:22:20,720
Where like the Warped Tour goes.

990
01:22:20,720 --> 01:22:21,920
You guys didn't catch the Warped Tour?

991
01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:22,640
Jimmy Buffett.

992
01:22:22,640 --> 01:22:23,200
Jimmy Buffett.

993
01:22:23,200 --> 01:22:24,640
Oh, okay.

994
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:25,200
Very, very good.

995
01:22:25,200 --> 01:22:30,160
But I would say overall, it sounds like as far as these titans of industry of his time

996
01:22:30,160 --> 01:22:32,240
go, not particularly.

997
01:22:32,240 --> 01:22:33,840
Not something extra evil.

998
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:37,120
Just the normal evil of the day, mostly.

999
01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:39,200
The evil you needed to be competitive.

1000
01:22:39,200 --> 01:22:39,520
Yeah.

1001
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:45,360
If we are starting to pick at this place and have some problems with it, this isn't a huge

1002
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:45,520
deal.

1003
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:50,880
It's just something maybe something I want to put on their radar as a potential problem

1004
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:51,600
down the road.

1005
01:22:53,280 --> 01:22:57,440
In addition to the theme park, there is a small zoo called Zoo America.

1006
01:22:57,440 --> 01:23:02,400
And I was watching video of Zoo America and for being pretty tiny on the map, there's

1007
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:05,440
a lot of like, there's a cool array of animals in there.

1008
01:23:05,440 --> 01:23:07,040
There's bobcats.

1009
01:23:07,040 --> 01:23:11,760
There's mountain lions and some kind of wild, dangerous animals.

1010
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:14,880
And I'm watching videos of these animals at the park.

1011
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:21,040
And then in the background are just houses, like clearly people's houses within easy

1012
01:23:21,040 --> 01:23:23,840
distance of wolves and such.

1013
01:23:23,840 --> 01:23:27,760
And I looked at it, I did some Google Street view.

1014
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:30,560
I wound my way through the area.

1015
01:23:30,560 --> 01:23:32,960
And I have a little diagram that I want to show you guys.

1016
01:23:32,960 --> 01:23:35,760
And we'll tweet this so you can follow along.

1017
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:41,680
But here is on the left, we have part of the zoo.

1018
01:23:41,680 --> 01:23:45,360
And here are the houses that are in the adjacent area.

1019
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:50,720
This part that is the very closest to the houses is the wolf pen.

1020
01:23:50,720 --> 01:23:55,840
And two gray wolves, at least.

1021
01:23:55,840 --> 01:23:59,200
And I looked on the street view on Trinidad Avenue here.

1022
01:23:59,200 --> 01:24:02,480
And it is just, it's not like a fortified fence.

1023
01:24:02,480 --> 01:24:07,920
It's just a regular chain link fence with a little bit of barbed wire at the top.

1024
01:24:07,920 --> 01:24:12,480
It's like the barbed wire you put on, you know, like to thwart a burglar who forgot

1025
01:24:12,480 --> 01:24:13,760
to bring gloves.

1026
01:24:13,760 --> 01:24:15,680
It's just like a mild amount.

1027
01:24:15,680 --> 01:24:24,000
And I also, using Google Maps technology, I counted out, I think you've got active alive

1028
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:28,080
wolves like 100 feet away from the front porch of this house.

1029
01:24:29,280 --> 01:24:32,160
So, and you know, not that it's a problem.

1030
01:24:32,160 --> 01:24:34,000
I mean, the wolves are probably fairly docile.

1031
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:37,200
It would probably take, you know, like they probably wouldn't freak out unless there was

1032
01:24:37,200 --> 01:24:44,320
a big loud noise, you know, like a monorail going by directly over the wolf pen.

1033
01:24:44,320 --> 01:24:49,440
So I have some concerns about what's going on about the proximity of the neighborhood.

1034
01:24:49,440 --> 01:24:50,800
I also was curious.

1035
01:24:51,680 --> 01:24:55,360
Also, like, and this is more the animal safety.

1036
01:24:57,120 --> 01:25:00,160
Like chocolate is horrible for all of these animals, right?

1037
01:25:00,160 --> 01:25:01,280
Especially if they're pregnant.

1038
01:25:01,280 --> 01:25:01,760
Yeah.

1039
01:25:01,760 --> 01:25:05,360
So, you know, all these people in the park, they've got all these chocolate bars.

1040
01:25:06,480 --> 01:25:09,920
Rappers with like kind of the shiny, the glint on the side.

1041
01:25:09,920 --> 01:25:10,720
Maybe they're eating them.

1042
01:25:10,720 --> 01:25:12,400
Maybe it's a choking hazard.

1043
01:25:12,400 --> 01:25:19,680
It should also be noted that a hurricane hit Hershey Park at one point and destroyed some

1044
01:25:19,680 --> 01:25:22,000
rides and damaged some buildings.

1045
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:25,760
I'm sure could easily take out a chain link wolf fence.

1046
01:25:26,480 --> 01:25:32,560
I believe, I think I read that something happened to the bison that like maybe the bison died.

1047
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:39,200
Maybe they like were drowned or like went off in a flood or something into the neighborhood.

1048
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:43,520
I don't, I feel like this zoo is a newer thing, which is weird because there's also like the

1049
01:25:43,520 --> 01:25:47,920
boardwalk at Hershey, which is what they call like, they have a small water park, I guess,

1050
01:25:47,920 --> 01:25:53,440
included in your admission now, which water parks in most of the country, those are very

1051
01:25:53,440 --> 01:25:54,000
seasonal.

1052
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:58,080
Like there's three months out of the year, you're lucky if you can operate those.

1053
01:25:59,760 --> 01:26:00,880
Yeah, I'm not sure the deal here.

1054
01:26:00,880 --> 01:26:02,320
One of these wolves is going to eat me.

1055
01:26:02,320 --> 01:26:03,520
One of these wolves, yes.

1056
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:10,480
He started at his middle face and worked his way up to the top sentient face.

1057
01:26:11,440 --> 01:26:18,160
I also want to say that I went on realtor.com and I looked up the price of the houses that

1058
01:26:18,160 --> 01:26:20,400
are in such proximity to the wolves.

1059
01:26:20,400 --> 01:26:25,280
The one sold just a month ago, I don't want to go calling out addresses, but they in a

1060
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:29,360
house in this area just sold for $165,000.

1061
01:26:29,360 --> 01:26:33,440
And I know probably a lot of people listening are frustrated with the high price of rent,

1062
01:26:34,080 --> 01:26:38,240
maybe can't afford a house and know that there's a fairly affordable house in Hershey,

1063
01:26:38,240 --> 01:26:38,880
Pennsylvania.

1064
01:26:38,880 --> 01:26:43,120
You just have to deal with the fact that a wolf could easily hop a fence and be in your

1065
01:26:43,120 --> 01:26:45,040
kitchen at a moment's notice.

1066
01:26:45,040 --> 01:26:50,240
Smell like chocolate, even the parts that aren't meant to, at a certain point, it just

1067
01:26:50,240 --> 01:26:53,280
becomes psychosomatic and you think you smell chocolate all the time.

1068
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:55,040
So you go mad.

1069
01:26:55,040 --> 01:27:01,360
Although according to Wikipedia, beginning with the 2012 season renovations, the famous

1070
01:27:01,360 --> 01:27:04,880
chocolate smell in parts of the park was dampened.

1071
01:27:04,880 --> 01:27:09,760
The park once used chocolate smelling chemical in building material, but discontinued.

1072
01:27:09,760 --> 01:27:10,260
What?

1073
01:27:11,520 --> 01:27:13,520
Concerns about safety.

1074
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:14,240
That's wild.

1075
01:27:15,120 --> 01:27:19,760
That also seems like such a lie because it seems like they tell you that the reason it

1076
01:27:19,760 --> 01:27:23,360
smells like chocolate is because like they're making so much chocolate.

1077
01:27:23,360 --> 01:27:24,880
But it's in the building.

1078
01:27:24,880 --> 01:27:25,600
Well, probably.

1079
01:27:25,600 --> 01:27:27,680
But is there a Disney-fied thing?

1080
01:27:27,680 --> 01:27:30,960
Because Disney famously pumps in smells of like fried chicken.

1081
01:27:30,960 --> 01:27:34,800
Like there's no fried chicken in Tomorrowland, but all of a sudden if you go by Space Mountain,

1082
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:36,800
there's this strong fried chicken smell.

1083
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:40,000
And it's just like you're naturally your brain starts, oh man, I really should have some

1084
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:40,800
fried chicken.

1085
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:41,680
But it's not around.

1086
01:27:41,680 --> 01:27:42,400
It's just the smell.

1087
01:27:42,400 --> 01:27:44,080
So are they doing stuff like that too?

1088
01:27:44,080 --> 01:27:48,480
Probably because the plaza in the kitchen is not too far.

1089
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:52,240
I'm talking about all the way over by Star Traders and like the Captain EO Theater.

1090
01:27:52,240 --> 01:27:54,560
I'm not talking about over by Plaza Jason.

1091
01:27:54,560 --> 01:27:56,560
That's still like backstage.

1092
01:27:56,560 --> 01:27:58,320
No, there's no way that the restaurants.

1093
01:27:59,200 --> 01:28:01,680
No, I'm talking about the exit to Space Mountain at Disneyland.

1094
01:28:01,680 --> 01:28:04,640
Space Mountain is built out of Cartons chicken batter.

1095
01:28:04,640 --> 01:28:06,560
We were there a couple a month or two ago.

1096
01:28:06,560 --> 01:28:07,840
Remember we were standing outside.

1097
01:28:07,840 --> 01:28:12,720
We had all gone to the bathroom and I said, hey, it smells like fried chicken here.

1098
01:28:12,720 --> 01:28:14,960
But if you think about it, there's no chicken anywhere.

1099
01:28:14,960 --> 01:28:16,720
I think it's backstage kitchens.

1100
01:28:16,720 --> 01:28:17,280
I think you're right.

1101
01:28:17,280 --> 01:28:18,560
And then we all went to.

1102
01:28:18,560 --> 01:28:21,520
Are you are you doubting that they're pumping in those fake smells?

1103
01:28:21,520 --> 01:28:22,320
You know that.

1104
01:28:22,320 --> 01:28:24,000
I know they're pumping in the fake smells.

1105
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:27,680
I think just I can point to a place that has fried chicken pretty close.

1106
01:28:27,680 --> 01:28:33,200
This is also this is riling me up, but there's no way that that fried chicken smell is floating

1107
01:28:33,200 --> 01:28:34,240
from the restaurant.

1108
01:28:35,120 --> 01:28:39,360
Maybe they pump it in because you go, oh, I know there's fried chicken around the corner.

1109
01:28:39,360 --> 01:28:40,800
So maybe I'm maybe I'm wrong.

1110
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:41,440
I'll see you guys.

1111
01:28:41,440 --> 01:28:42,640
Don't say chicken.

1112
01:28:42,640 --> 01:28:43,600
It's chicken.

1113
01:28:44,960 --> 01:28:47,600
What is this regional pronunciation of chicken?

1114
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:51,760
Uh huh. Anyway, so so Hershey Park is maybe doing this.

1115
01:28:51,760 --> 01:28:52,240
We don't know.

1116
01:28:52,240 --> 01:28:55,920
We don't know if they're also like artificially chocolate smelling.

1117
01:28:55,920 --> 01:28:58,000
I had a stuffed Hershey Kiss growing up.

1118
01:28:59,040 --> 01:29:03,680
I have to think maybe it smelled like chocolate or maybe it's just like the industrial plastic

1119
01:29:03,680 --> 01:29:04,480
smell.

1120
01:29:04,480 --> 01:29:10,000
We need to fortify fences and we need to check the we need to reevaluate the building codes

1121
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:14,720
and make sure that everything's made out of safe materials and not aging chocolate.

1122
01:29:14,720 --> 01:29:18,880
Because as we learned, even those giant chocolate bars go white eventually.

1123
01:29:18,880 --> 01:29:20,240
We didn't talk about the log flume.

1124
01:29:20,240 --> 01:29:23,920
Is that a big thing or is it just a big thing in my memory?

1125
01:29:23,920 --> 01:29:24,960
The cold cracker?

1126
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:26,160
Is that what it's called or something?

1127
01:29:26,960 --> 01:29:28,320
The big log flume ride.

1128
01:29:28,880 --> 01:29:32,960
I think that maybe just in my mind it was a big deal because I had not seen one before.

1129
01:29:32,960 --> 01:29:36,480
And I also it's like the classic log flume.

1130
01:29:36,480 --> 01:29:40,560
And there's a bridge that you can observe and you can get wet on the bridge and the

1131
01:29:40,560 --> 01:29:42,560
opening credits for step by step.

1132
01:29:42,560 --> 01:29:45,440
There's a log flume and you can get wet.

1133
01:29:45,440 --> 01:29:50,560
And I just was when I went to Hershey Park, I thought that must be the park where that

1134
01:29:50,560 --> 01:29:51,120
was shot.

1135
01:29:51,120 --> 01:29:53,360
Even though of course it was.

1136
01:29:53,360 --> 01:29:54,400
Why would it have been?

1137
01:29:54,400 --> 01:29:58,720
No, famously the opening step by step was at Magic Mountain, which at the end of the

1138
01:29:58,720 --> 01:30:02,960
credits is superimposed to look like it is on the Great Lakes.

1139
01:30:02,960 --> 01:30:04,880
Well that makes much more sense.

1140
01:30:04,880 --> 01:30:09,360
There's this bizarre shot at the end of the sequence where there's a poorly tracked like

1141
01:30:09,360 --> 01:30:13,600
darting around lake for some reason on the shores of Valencia.

1142
01:30:13,600 --> 01:30:14,960
It's one of the strangest things.

1143
01:30:14,960 --> 01:30:18,240
I'm sure we'll talk about this for longer at some point.

1144
01:30:18,240 --> 01:30:23,120
But like why the show is set in Green Bay, Wisconsin, but who in the world is going to

1145
01:30:23,120 --> 01:30:25,840
be going like there should be a lake in there.

1146
01:30:27,680 --> 01:30:28,160
Odd.

1147
01:30:28,720 --> 01:30:31,120
And I don't think they had the graphics to pull it off.

1148
01:30:31,120 --> 01:30:32,400
Let's go into step by step.

1149
01:30:32,400 --> 01:30:33,360
Is the family gone on vacation?

1150
01:30:34,160 --> 01:30:35,680
Yeah, absolutely.

1151
01:30:35,680 --> 01:30:35,920
I don't know.

1152
01:30:35,920 --> 01:30:36,800
That's a lot of family.

1153
01:30:36,800 --> 01:30:40,960
There's like six, seven kids.

1154
01:30:40,960 --> 01:30:42,560
That's kind of a hassle, but you can.

1155
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:42,800
Yes.

1156
01:30:44,800 --> 01:30:45,600
Hey, good point.

1157
01:30:46,560 --> 01:30:48,240
You can trust that guy too.

1158
01:30:48,240 --> 01:30:49,920
He's not up to no good.

1159
01:30:49,920 --> 01:30:51,360
Getting his man, dude.

1160
01:30:52,080 --> 01:30:53,280
I said it so confidently.

1161
01:30:53,280 --> 01:30:53,760
It's Cody.

1162
01:30:53,760 --> 01:30:55,440
Yeah, it's the code Meister man.

1163
01:30:57,760 --> 01:30:58,720
What have we not covered?

1164
01:30:58,720 --> 01:31:00,560
We've covered a lot.

1165
01:31:00,560 --> 01:31:03,200
The only one thing I had written down is the laugh track.

1166
01:31:03,840 --> 01:31:06,240
Oh, that's the roller, the indoor roller coaster.

1167
01:31:06,240 --> 01:31:06,480
Yeah.

1168
01:31:06,480 --> 01:31:09,680
And there's a character on the, this is, I don't know if you guys know more about this

1169
01:31:09,680 --> 01:31:10,240
than I do.

1170
01:31:10,240 --> 01:31:12,720
There's a character supposedly named laughing cell.

1171
01:31:13,440 --> 01:31:14,880
Are you familiar with this character?

1172
01:31:14,880 --> 01:31:16,240
I have seen laughing cell.

1173
01:31:16,240 --> 01:31:20,960
Laughing cell is a character that appears on like many different things.

1174
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:24,720
Like in different, I think there's a video of laughing cell on my Instagram.

1175
01:31:24,720 --> 01:31:26,640
So let me show everyone here.

1176
01:31:26,640 --> 01:31:28,160
Do you know, are you familiar with laughing?

1177
01:31:28,160 --> 01:31:28,480
Okay.

1178
01:31:28,480 --> 01:31:33,600
Laughing cell is a, like a creepy kind of, it looks like a woman.

1179
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:34,000
I'm not sure.

1180
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:35,280
Is cell a lady's name?

1181
01:31:35,280 --> 01:31:37,520
Laughing cell was like a penny arcade thing.

1182
01:31:37,520 --> 01:31:37,760
Yeah.

1183
01:31:37,760 --> 01:31:38,800
Where you, there's one.

1184
01:31:38,800 --> 01:31:40,480
This is laughing cell.

1185
01:31:40,480 --> 01:31:42,480
Oh, she's terrifying.

1186
01:31:42,480 --> 01:31:45,520
There's one at the museum mechanic in San Francisco.

1187
01:31:45,520 --> 01:31:46,640
That's where this video is from.

1188
01:31:46,640 --> 01:31:52,000
It's a scary toothless lady who I feel like is on the outside of fun houses or in, uh,

1189
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:55,920
yeah, I think, yeah, this may have been a mass produced cause it's like, like a Zoltar,

1190
01:31:55,920 --> 01:31:57,760
like a movie big Zoltar.

1191
01:31:57,760 --> 01:31:59,360
That's what entertainment was.

1192
01:31:59,360 --> 01:32:02,080
Just a laughing puppet back then.

1193
01:32:02,080 --> 01:32:08,480
Uh, yeah, laugh track is an indoor rollercoaster sort of themed after fun houses and just everything's

1194
01:32:08,480 --> 01:32:13,200
in black light and there's a lot of horrifying Calliope music playing.

1195
01:32:13,920 --> 01:32:14,240
Yeah.

1196
01:32:14,240 --> 01:32:17,520
I, I, all I really wanted to just talk about was laughing cells.

1197
01:32:17,520 --> 01:32:17,840
Yeah.

1198
01:32:17,840 --> 01:32:20,240
So, but yeah, that's, it's sort of, yeah.

1199
01:32:20,240 --> 01:32:22,640
Anyways, did you guys know, did you ride it?

1200
01:32:22,640 --> 01:32:24,400
Did you, were you scared by laughing cell?

1201
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:26,720
I think that's a newer ride.

1202
01:32:26,720 --> 01:32:26,960
Really?

1203
01:32:26,960 --> 01:32:30,400
They so laughing cell, even though she's very old, like a hunt, like they've been putting

1204
01:32:30,400 --> 01:32:30,880
her on things.

1205
01:32:30,880 --> 01:32:37,040
I, I, I don't know, a quarter or a dime into the laughing cell at San Francisco sketch

1206
01:32:37,040 --> 01:32:39,040
Fest a few years ago and was scared of it then.

1207
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:40,000
Oh, okay.

1208
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:41,920
So you have had a run in with her?

1209
01:32:41,920 --> 01:32:42,160
Yeah.

1210
01:32:42,160 --> 01:32:44,160
The video you played, I've seen that one.

1211
01:32:44,160 --> 01:32:44,480
Oh wow.

1212
01:32:44,480 --> 01:32:45,600
She laughed in your face.

1213
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:46,240
She laughed at me.

1214
01:32:46,240 --> 01:32:46,480
Yeah.

1215
01:32:46,480 --> 01:32:47,120
Oh God.

1216
01:32:47,120 --> 01:32:47,680
Terrifying.

1217
01:32:47,680 --> 01:32:49,440
Anyway, that does not seem up my alley.

1218
01:32:49,440 --> 01:32:52,960
So if there was something associated with her, I don't think I would have.

1219
01:32:52,960 --> 01:32:54,080
No, you would have been too scared.

1220
01:32:54,640 --> 01:32:56,000
I think I'm too scared today.

1221
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:59,920
Um, why are we too scared to go on a ride with laughing cell?

1222
01:33:01,520 --> 01:33:02,320
Maybe.

1223
01:33:02,320 --> 01:33:02,720
Yeah.

1224
01:33:02,720 --> 01:33:03,760
Um, yeah, that's it.

1225
01:33:03,760 --> 01:33:05,120
I mean, was everybody, what else?

1226
01:33:05,120 --> 01:33:11,360
Well, so just keep laughing Sal out of there and let's keep the focus on our beloved fully

1227
01:33:11,360 --> 01:33:12,720
fleshed out characters.

1228
01:33:12,720 --> 01:33:13,280
Yeah.

1229
01:33:13,280 --> 01:33:18,720
I think Hershey parks going to stretch into the new millennium, which we're already in

1230
01:33:18,720 --> 01:33:22,720
it, but it's going to keep a stretching into that new keeps stretching.

1231
01:33:22,720 --> 01:33:24,160
So do we want to give our final thoughts?

1232
01:33:24,160 --> 01:33:24,880
Do we want to plus?

1233
01:33:24,880 --> 01:33:26,640
Do we want to talk about what do we do?

1234
01:33:26,640 --> 01:33:30,720
Keep as is, do we want to demolish the park for insurance money or do we want to plus

1235
01:33:30,720 --> 01:33:30,880
it up?

1236
01:33:30,880 --> 01:33:32,080
But what do we think?

1237
01:33:32,080 --> 01:33:34,880
Build a wall, keep those houses safe.

1238
01:33:35,920 --> 01:33:37,840
This is a wall we can all agree on.

1239
01:33:37,840 --> 01:33:39,280
A wolf protection.

1240
01:33:39,280 --> 01:33:39,920
Wolf wall.

1241
01:33:39,920 --> 01:33:41,840
It is private before we build that other wall.

1242
01:33:41,840 --> 01:33:44,640
This one doesn't require, it's only like 50 feet.

1243
01:33:44,640 --> 01:33:46,240
Let's protect those houses.

1244
01:33:46,240 --> 01:33:50,160
I'm going to say, I'm going to plus it up, but I'm not going to, it's not, I haven't

1245
01:33:50,160 --> 01:33:54,400
been to the park, so I can't give such a great critique of it.

1246
01:33:54,400 --> 01:33:58,560
But I'll plus it up in the sense that we need these characters in more media.

1247
01:33:58,560 --> 01:34:01,840
That's the problem is that you go there and you don't have the connection to them.

1248
01:34:01,840 --> 01:34:08,560
So we need TV shows starring Reese and Jolly Rancher and they need to be cool and kids

1249
01:34:08,560 --> 01:34:10,080
need to like them and they need to know all about them.

1250
01:34:10,080 --> 01:34:13,360
We need a movie obviously written by Evan and his writing partner, Van.

1251
01:34:14,480 --> 01:34:20,800
We need that Simpsons joke, like the Mars bar choco-bot hour, like the lesson about

1252
01:34:20,800 --> 01:34:22,800
commercialism at the end of that Simpsons.

1253
01:34:22,800 --> 01:34:24,240
You're like, no, I want that.

1254
01:34:24,240 --> 01:34:24,480
Yes.

1255
01:34:24,480 --> 01:34:26,800
That's that's a show we need right now.

1256
01:34:26,800 --> 01:34:27,040
Yeah.

1257
01:34:27,040 --> 01:34:28,560
It's the show we need right now.

1258
01:34:28,560 --> 01:34:32,080
We need to indoctrinate kids with these characters before they head to park.

1259
01:34:32,080 --> 01:34:33,440
So the park is more enjoyable later.

1260
01:34:33,440 --> 01:34:35,600
So that they know how hard to hug them.

1261
01:34:35,600 --> 01:34:36,000
Yes.

1262
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:37,840
Do I love you a little or a lot?

1263
01:34:37,840 --> 01:34:40,160
We need to make sure kids love these characters a lot.

1264
01:34:40,160 --> 01:34:40,660
Yeah.

1265
01:34:41,760 --> 01:34:42,320
Great.

1266
01:34:42,320 --> 01:34:42,820
Yeah.

1267
01:34:43,440 --> 01:34:47,840
You know, I think, I think it's not plus up Hersy Park, but let's keep them on their

1268
01:34:47,840 --> 01:34:54,800
toes by make it like, let's, let's get more food brands making theme parks as we talked

1269
01:34:54,800 --> 01:34:55,280
about.

1270
01:34:55,280 --> 01:34:58,560
There's the, there's the possibility of Willy Wonka.

1271
01:34:58,560 --> 01:35:02,800
I think, I think all of them, you know, all of these places are probably flush with cash

1272
01:35:02,800 --> 01:35:04,640
and it's time to put it back in the community.

1273
01:35:05,360 --> 01:35:08,240
I thought of the Heinz factory, which is nearby.

1274
01:35:08,240 --> 01:35:09,360
It's in Pittsburgh.

1275
01:35:09,360 --> 01:35:13,040
I think they could siphon some of the business away from Hersy Park.

1276
01:35:13,040 --> 01:35:18,080
And there's obviously, I mean, who wouldn't love to go meet relish and mustard, you know,

1277
01:35:18,800 --> 01:35:25,120
like Worcestershire sauce could be kind of a, you know, sadder, more cantankerous Eeyore

1278
01:35:25,120 --> 01:35:26,240
type character.

1279
01:35:26,240 --> 01:35:27,840
There's a lot of possibilities.

1280
01:35:27,840 --> 01:35:31,920
Heinz also owns a Bagel Bites, or right at Tater Tots.

1281
01:35:31,920 --> 01:35:36,160
And they have their own competitor to Jolly Rancher, the cool character.

1282
01:35:36,160 --> 01:35:41,520
What would that purple and neon blue ketchup that they were doing for a little while there?

1283
01:35:41,520 --> 01:35:41,920
Wow.

1284
01:35:41,920 --> 01:35:47,600
The bad kids, the, you know, the Jason's of the world, the bad boys would want to go,

1285
01:35:47,600 --> 01:35:51,120
you know, do something, do something naughty with the purple ketchup.

1286
01:35:51,120 --> 01:35:52,720
Eat a chili dog alone.

1287
01:35:54,080 --> 01:35:59,440
When he should be socializing with people his own age and not just compulsively riding

1288
01:35:59,440 --> 01:36:00,160
attractions.

1289
01:36:00,880 --> 01:36:06,320
Go on a roller coaster a half hour after eating instead of the requisite 45 minutes.

1290
01:36:06,320 --> 01:36:06,800
Hell yeah.

1291
01:36:07,600 --> 01:36:08,320
Let's get, yeah.

1292
01:36:08,320 --> 01:36:08,640
All right.

1293
01:36:08,640 --> 01:36:11,600
Let's get bad with purple ketchup at Heinzland.

1294
01:36:11,600 --> 01:36:15,600
I was thinking too, you were talking about other food, food parks.

1295
01:36:15,600 --> 01:36:21,600
I think Yum Brands who owns Taco Bell KFC and Pizza Hut, they should have their own

1296
01:36:21,600 --> 01:36:23,360
park called like Yum Park.

1297
01:36:23,360 --> 01:36:28,000
And you can have walk around cheesy guritti crunches and stuffed crust pizzas.

1298
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
And they're going to look just like the Hershey Kari.

1299
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:31,280
I mean, that's, oh yeah.

1300
01:36:31,280 --> 01:36:32,480
The Taco Bell Chihuahua.

1301
01:36:32,480 --> 01:36:33,040
Yeah, I guess.

1302
01:36:33,040 --> 01:36:35,200
I mean, he's been gone for a while, but you could bring him back.

1303
01:36:35,200 --> 01:36:36,080
He could bring him back.

1304
01:36:36,720 --> 01:36:36,880
Yeah.

1305
01:36:36,880 --> 01:36:39,360
We got to loosen the rules a little bit.

1306
01:36:39,360 --> 01:36:42,960
Although I do want to focus on alive foods as much.

1307
01:36:42,960 --> 01:36:45,120
I would love to see all the mascots, but I agree.

1308
01:36:45,840 --> 01:36:50,640
Imagine being in a fun house designed by Doritos Locos Taco.

1309
01:36:50,640 --> 01:36:51,280
Yes.

1310
01:36:51,280 --> 01:36:51,840
Yes.

1311
01:36:51,840 --> 01:36:53,760
That twisted mind.

1312
01:36:53,760 --> 01:36:55,520
Imagine what's going to happen in there.

1313
01:36:55,520 --> 01:37:00,080
Like a Gravitron where, how about the Gravitron where it spins around, but it's like a giant

1314
01:37:00,080 --> 01:37:01,920
stuffed crust pizza inside.

1315
01:37:01,920 --> 01:37:03,680
So there's like toppings on the wall.

1316
01:37:03,680 --> 01:37:05,200
Maybe it gets everyone messy.

1317
01:37:05,200 --> 01:37:06,080
I don't know.

1318
01:37:06,080 --> 01:37:07,040
I just, you don't know.

1319
01:37:07,040 --> 01:37:11,200
You have to sign a waiver, but you're covered in pizza toppings when you come off.

1320
01:37:11,200 --> 01:37:11,600
Oh yeah.

1321
01:37:11,600 --> 01:37:18,800
Like kids getting to jump into like pizza sauce and like the ball pitch that is the

1322
01:37:18,800 --> 01:37:22,640
ingredients of pizza and then rolling around in dough afterwards.

1323
01:37:22,640 --> 01:37:22,800
Yeah.

1324
01:37:22,800 --> 01:37:23,840
There's a lot of possibilities.

1325
01:37:24,800 --> 01:37:27,040
I have to agree with both of you guys.

1326
01:37:27,040 --> 01:37:30,960
I would also like to see more brands get involved in this, but the ones you have mentioned,

1327
01:37:30,960 --> 01:37:34,160
I feel like people already have like affection for Yum!

1328
01:37:34,160 --> 01:37:36,160
Brand stuff or Heinz stuff.

1329
01:37:36,160 --> 01:37:38,560
Uh, I want to see like a Unilever Park.

1330
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:39,520
Now look at these brands.

1331
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:41,520
Unilever.

1332
01:37:41,520 --> 01:37:44,560
I mean, you can get Ben and Jerry's in there.

1333
01:37:44,560 --> 01:37:52,320
You can get a Lipton attraction, a Dove attraction, nor those powdered envelopes of different

1334
01:37:52,320 --> 01:37:53,520
noodle flavors.

1335
01:37:53,520 --> 01:37:56,080
You could have a whole nor tasting area.

1336
01:37:56,080 --> 01:37:57,120
An Axe.

1337
01:37:57,120 --> 01:37:58,800
Axe body spray.

1338
01:37:58,800 --> 01:37:59,280
Oh yeah.

1339
01:37:59,280 --> 01:38:03,760
And I mean, there's even more brands in this bigger picture.

1340
01:38:03,760 --> 01:38:05,280
Country Croc.

1341
01:38:05,280 --> 01:38:06,080
Okay.

1342
01:38:07,440 --> 01:38:08,080
The Country Croc.

1343
01:38:08,080 --> 01:38:08,960
Rama.

1344
01:38:08,960 --> 01:38:10,880
We all Rama and Ravona.

1345
01:38:10,880 --> 01:38:16,800
How about like a tea cup style thing where you get in the Country Croc tins or tubs and

1346
01:38:16,800 --> 01:38:17,680
it spins around.

1347
01:38:17,680 --> 01:38:19,120
Slim Fast Racers.

1348
01:38:19,120 --> 01:38:19,680
That's great.

1349
01:38:19,680 --> 01:38:20,640
Slim Fast Racers.

1350
01:38:21,760 --> 01:38:27,920
After you pig out at the Ragu Italian restaurant, you go to the Wishbone Salant Bar to balance

1351
01:38:27,920 --> 01:38:28,640
it out.

1352
01:38:28,640 --> 01:38:31,760
I mean, I think this makes it right to itself.

1353
01:38:31,760 --> 01:38:35,040
And like a Fun House Mirror sponsored by Slim Fast.

1354
01:38:35,040 --> 01:38:38,800
Hey, she looked alternatively very skinny and very fat.

1355
01:38:38,800 --> 01:38:43,600
And like some sort of Dove attraction that has good intentions, and then they immediately

1356
01:38:43,600 --> 01:38:47,280
get dragged for it because they fucked it up how they went about it.

1357
01:38:47,280 --> 01:38:49,680
As the history of Dove advertising shows us.

1358
01:38:49,680 --> 01:38:50,160
Oh sure.

1359
01:38:50,160 --> 01:38:50,640
That's great.

1360
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:56,480
Yeah, I think we're all on the same page that there are some minor plus ups to the park

1361
01:38:56,480 --> 01:38:56,880
itself.

1362
01:38:58,320 --> 01:39:00,800
Some of the rides could be a little more thought out.

1363
01:39:00,800 --> 01:39:04,400
The characters could be a little bit better, but I think we're all in favor of just more

1364
01:39:04,400 --> 01:39:05,600
parts with more brands.

1365
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:10,000
I also love that Hershey is in Hershey, Pennsylvania.

1366
01:39:10,880 --> 01:39:13,920
So just like other brands, Hershey can't really control that.

1367
01:39:13,920 --> 01:39:18,400
So I would say open up like a satellite location in like Tuscan, Arizona.

1368
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:22,320
Just like just another town, like a little off the beaten path.

1369
01:39:22,320 --> 01:39:24,160
And yeah, there's an amusement park here now.

1370
01:39:24,160 --> 01:39:28,160
Like how Universal Studios Hollywood opened up Universal Orlando, but it's not a real

1371
01:39:28,160 --> 01:39:29,360
working Hollywood.

1372
01:39:29,360 --> 01:39:31,040
It's not a working studio.

1373
01:39:31,040 --> 01:39:31,360
Yes.

1374
01:39:31,360 --> 01:39:33,120
But it's sort of copying.

1375
01:39:33,120 --> 01:39:34,800
Yes, they're copying the factory.

1376
01:39:34,800 --> 01:39:38,800
But I also just like too that, you know, not in Orlando, not in Los Angeles.

1377
01:39:38,800 --> 01:39:39,300
Yes.

1378
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,560
Just in maybe the Burbank Mall.

1379
01:39:42,560 --> 01:39:43,920
Maybe the Burbank Mall.

1380
01:39:43,920 --> 01:39:44,480
It's time.

1381
01:39:44,480 --> 01:39:44,960
Yeah, right.

1382
01:39:44,960 --> 01:39:45,520
I'm in a real estate.

1383
01:39:45,520 --> 01:39:47,040
I'm going to put a theme park right here.

1384
01:39:47,040 --> 01:39:51,600
In keeping with pronunciation issues, did you just say Tuscan as opposed to Tucson?

1385
01:39:52,320 --> 01:39:52,800
I did.

1386
01:39:53,600 --> 01:39:54,000
Wow.

1387
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:54,560
What?

1388
01:39:54,560 --> 01:39:56,240
I thought you were talking about a different place.

1389
01:39:56,240 --> 01:40:03,440
Uh, I was, I was like scrambling to look up a city that would be the right.

1390
01:40:03,440 --> 01:40:04,880
And I was like Tuscan, that sounds right.

1391
01:40:04,880 --> 01:40:07,680
And I think I have heard people, I would normally say Tucson.

1392
01:40:07,680 --> 01:40:08,240
Uh huh.

1393
01:40:08,240 --> 01:40:08,480
Right.

1394
01:40:08,480 --> 01:40:10,640
But I think I was just like, what's the thing?

1395
01:40:10,640 --> 01:40:11,520
In your haste.

1396
01:40:11,520 --> 01:40:15,760
But I don't know if, if like greasy species is Tuscan a more fun way to say Tucson.

1397
01:40:15,760 --> 01:40:17,840
No, I think that was just an embarrassing mistake.

1398
01:40:17,840 --> 01:40:18,480
There might be a Tuscan.

1399
01:40:18,480 --> 01:40:20,240
I'm having fun talking about it.

1400
01:40:20,240 --> 01:40:24,720
And maybe I have actually heard people, other people, I'm realizing that this is maybe a

1401
01:40:24,720 --> 01:40:30,160
mistake other people have made because I have heard people say Tuscan, Arizona and been

1402
01:40:30,160 --> 01:40:31,120
like, what the hell is that?

1403
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,240
Yeah, probably that's what they maybe just another puzzle.

1404
01:40:35,920 --> 01:40:36,800
We'll figure it out.

1405
01:40:36,800 --> 01:40:37,520
All street.

1406
01:40:37,520 --> 01:40:38,960
You say tomato.

1407
01:40:38,960 --> 01:40:40,160
I say tomato.

1408
01:40:40,160 --> 01:40:41,360
Let's call the whole thing off.

1409
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,960
Evan Sesser, you have survived podcast, the ride.

1410
01:40:44,960 --> 01:40:46,480
Thank you so much for being here.

1411
01:40:47,120 --> 01:40:50,640
Thanks for taking us on a chocotastic journey.

1412
01:40:50,640 --> 01:40:51,200
Guys.

1413
01:40:51,200 --> 01:40:52,240
I had a great time.

1414
01:40:52,240 --> 01:40:53,360
It was great to be here.

1415
01:40:53,360 --> 01:40:53,760
Thank you.

1416
01:40:53,760 --> 01:40:54,640
Thanks for coming.

1417
01:40:54,640 --> 01:40:55,760
Are we all crashing now?

1418
01:40:55,760 --> 01:40:57,200
We're all a little mellow at this point.

1419
01:40:59,200 --> 01:41:00,000
I got rowdy.

1420
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,160
I feel like I was yelling at a certain point.

1421
01:41:02,160 --> 01:41:03,360
The chocolate did.

1422
01:41:03,360 --> 01:41:06,720
I thought it was like a joke that it would have any sort of effect on the podcast.

1423
01:41:06,720 --> 01:41:07,280
I think it did.

1424
01:41:07,280 --> 01:41:12,960
I think that first of all, the sounds of people opening it definitely always helps.

1425
01:41:12,960 --> 01:41:16,000
I do think it got everyone riled up and now I'm ready to crash.

1426
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:23,120
Yeah, but I think we clearly delivered a show that was equal to or greater than Letterman

1427
01:41:23,120 --> 01:41:25,360
circa the mid 90s.

1428
01:41:25,360 --> 01:41:27,760
I think that was height of Letterman, what we just did.

1429
01:41:27,760 --> 01:41:30,800
We're like Chris Elliott era Letterman.

1430
01:41:30,800 --> 01:41:31,760
Yeah, absolutely.

1431
01:41:31,760 --> 01:41:32,880
Good stuff was happening.

1432
01:41:32,880 --> 01:41:34,320
It was innovative.

1433
01:41:34,320 --> 01:41:35,120
It was fresh.

1434
01:41:35,120 --> 01:41:37,280
It wasn't like Carson.

1435
01:41:37,280 --> 01:41:39,280
It wasn't like the stodgy old, which I get.

1436
01:41:39,280 --> 01:41:41,440
I'm going to say his dough boys and this.

1437
01:41:41,440 --> 01:41:42,640
We're the edgier.

1438
01:41:42,640 --> 01:41:43,840
They're the stodgy.

1439
01:41:43,840 --> 01:41:50,400
Them having started two years ago, they're the old Carson to our hip Letterman.

1440
01:41:50,400 --> 01:41:55,920
And you're the link to the new generation of I disagree with this entirely.

1441
01:41:55,920 --> 01:41:58,160
He had a well down the later show.

1442
01:41:58,160 --> 01:42:01,520
He had Carson's producer a little bit to start the show.

1443
01:42:02,080 --> 01:42:02,800
Oh, that's great.

1444
01:42:02,800 --> 01:42:04,320
You're Fred de Cordova.

1445
01:42:04,320 --> 01:42:07,200
I think you are the Fred de Cordova of dough boys.

1446
01:42:07,200 --> 01:42:08,400
Not the first time I've heard that.

1447
01:42:11,760 --> 01:42:12,260
Wow.

1448
01:42:12,640 --> 01:42:13,920
Glad there's agreement on this.

1449
01:42:14,560 --> 01:42:19,520
Well, anything you'd like to plug beyond your participation as executive producer of dough

1450
01:42:19,520 --> 01:42:20,240
boys.

1451
01:42:20,240 --> 01:42:23,280
Well, Doughboys Tournament of Champions.

1452
01:42:23,280 --> 01:42:23,780
Doughboys.

1453
01:42:23,780 --> 01:42:26,240
Much madness happening now.

1454
01:42:27,440 --> 01:42:30,560
Listen, maybe and you guys this year.

1455
01:42:30,560 --> 01:42:32,160
Well, maybe you're not allowed to say yet.

1456
01:42:32,160 --> 01:42:35,840
Maybe a future year in the tournament because you cover a different topic every time.

1457
01:42:35,840 --> 01:42:37,840
Maybe some maybe at some point candy.

1458
01:42:39,840 --> 01:42:40,800
I said desserts.

1459
01:42:40,800 --> 01:42:45,600
I tweeted that doughboys when they asked like, what should we do this year?

1460
01:42:45,600 --> 01:42:47,280
I'm like, you got to do fast food desserts.

1461
01:42:47,280 --> 01:42:48,640
You got to do the treats.

1462
01:42:48,640 --> 01:42:52,960
Desserts and treats, I think is a very, very promising.

1463
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:54,800
TCBY.

1464
01:42:54,800 --> 01:42:55,920
Well, talk to the boys.

1465
01:42:55,920 --> 01:42:56,720
I'll talk to the boys.

1466
01:42:56,720 --> 01:42:57,600
I'll see what I can do.

1467
01:42:57,600 --> 01:42:58,080
Right.

1468
01:42:58,080 --> 01:42:59,680
Maybe two tournaments of chocolates.

1469
01:42:59,680 --> 01:43:01,440
Man, this is such a low energy ending.

1470
01:43:01,440 --> 01:43:02,000
I know.

1471
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,000
I was honestly true.

1472
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:05,360
We did crash.

1473
01:43:05,360 --> 01:43:05,600
All right.

1474
01:43:05,600 --> 01:43:08,560
The top 10 reasons why you're cheating.

1475
01:43:08,560 --> 01:43:09,280
Pennsylvania.

1476
01:43:09,280 --> 01:43:09,780
Okay.

1477
01:43:11,040 --> 01:43:12,000
Milk chocolate.

1478
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:13,920
Why you threw the pens out the window?

1479
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:15,360
Just to keep the energy up.

1480
01:43:15,360 --> 01:43:16,640
Give your Twitter out.

1481
01:43:16,640 --> 01:43:18,320
Tell everyone where to find you.

1482
01:43:18,320 --> 01:43:20,160
Find me at Evan Susser.

1483
01:43:20,160 --> 01:43:20,720
And that's it.

1484
01:43:21,920 --> 01:43:24,960
Rent fist fight on all your digital on demand.

1485
01:43:24,960 --> 01:43:25,680
Your red box.

1486
01:43:27,680 --> 01:43:28,320
Yeah.

1487
01:43:28,320 --> 01:43:29,840
And keep listening to this.

1488
01:43:29,840 --> 01:43:30,080
Yeah.

1489
01:43:30,080 --> 01:43:30,800
Listen to us.

1490
01:43:30,800 --> 01:43:34,960
Hey, podcast the right at Gmail and on Twitter at podcast the right.

1491
01:43:34,960 --> 01:43:35,840
And we have Instagram.

1492
01:43:35,840 --> 01:43:36,560
That's the same thing.

1493
01:43:36,560 --> 01:43:40,880
And then do all that and tell your friends about it and rate us on iTunes and say, oh,

1494
01:43:40,880 --> 01:43:41,360
we're great.

1495
01:43:41,360 --> 01:43:42,160
Say we're fine.

1496
01:43:43,760 --> 01:43:45,040
He never lapses.

1497
01:43:45,040 --> 01:43:45,280
Yeah.

1498
01:43:45,280 --> 01:43:50,720
And only no criticisms, even if constructive.

1499
01:43:50,720 --> 01:43:52,720
No, no, thank you.

1500
01:43:52,720 --> 01:43:55,760
No, thank you enough of that to ourselves.

1501
01:43:55,760 --> 01:43:57,360
Just keep it only positive.

1502
01:43:57,360 --> 01:43:58,160
We're perfect.

1503
01:43:58,160 --> 01:44:00,209
Goodbye.
