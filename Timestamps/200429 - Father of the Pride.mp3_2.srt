1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Welcome to Podcast the Ride, the second gate today containing

3
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
one of the stupidest experiments in the history of Podcast the Ride.

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm Scott Gardner going boldly where no man should ever go.

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Joined via satellite by Jason Sheridan.

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Yeah, I'm here.

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
And Mike Carlson.

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I am here and I am terrified.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
The brave three, we really are like the Apollo 13 astronauts.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:57,000
We may regret boarding this mission or contemplating it, the hubris involved.

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Because what you're hearing right now is the Father of the Pride episode.

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
And we'll talk about what Father of the Pride is, but the, you know,

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
we've talked about doing this for a long time.

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
And for some reason we landed on rather than let's just kind of like be vaguely

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
aware of the show and, you know, kind of poke fun at some highlights of it.

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
We landed on that we will be watching the series in its entirety.

17
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Yeah, I bought the DVD a number of months ago and because we said we were going to do this

18
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
and I was fully prepared for like the days leading up to it.

19
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I just watched like two or three at a time.

20
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:49,000
But then the world changed and we, Scott, I think it was your idea to watch them all in one day

21
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
and check in on each other.

22
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I mean, it seemed like we were always heading to something like,

23
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I feel like in my head all of the discussion of this has been that we would have to watch the entire series.

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:07,000
And then the rise of coronavirus, yes, caused this to be a necessity, I feel.

25
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
There's no choice, right?

26
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I can't see how we have a choice here.

27
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Yeah, no, we're powerless to stop this.

28
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It's one of the, yes, there's ways that the world has changed indelibly.

29
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:27,000
And one of them is that for sure we have to do all this in one day, check in from our separate apartments.

30
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Now, one good thing about it is that I think it would have been a little hellish to do this in person.

31
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I think we would have gotten truly sick of each other.

32
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:43,000
And the way, doing it via satellite means we can have snacks, we can take a little break,

33
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:50,000
be with our significant others, we can watch it all in our underwear if we want.

34
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Yeah, I think this is going to be a lot more comfortable.

35
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I don't know, it might be a higher chance that we go completely mad, some sort of internalized madness.

36
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Yes.

37
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Like if we're not, I mean, I guess, yeah, there'll be a significant other route,

38
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
but I don't know if I'm going to make Lindsay watch this with me.

39
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I don't think I am.

40
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
So I may just melt down alone on the couch is what I'm saying.

41
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Sure.

42
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Would you say you might be feeling like Larry when his father-in-law, Sarmati, moves in?

43
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
All right.

44
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
As far as characters go, if that's a reference to the show we're about to watch, I don't know those characters.

45
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I know there's a character named Blake.

46
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I've seen Blake. Is that correct, Jason? Blake?

47
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I think there's a Blake.

48
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I should say there's a shocking number of characters with known actors voicing them.

49
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
It's an incredible voice cast.

50
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:55,000
It's a truly robust, I feel like I'm cheating by having the Wikipedia in front of me.

51
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I think we all know John Goodman is the star,

52
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
but I'm being reminded by the Wikipedia that Carl Reiner is in this series.

53
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I want to be surprised, but I do have the Wikipedia open and I see something about Darryl Hannah.

54
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Darryl Hannah, I think we may be looking at a CGI Kelsey Grammer coming at some point.

55
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Oh my God.

56
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
The random one that I flipped to has that, yes.

57
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I mean, maybe if we're getting into it, yeah, maybe this is a good time to say we wanted to check.

58
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
We haven't started this yet.

59
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:38,000
That's why our plan was to check in right at the top where this is as good of spirits as we're going to be in this episode.

60
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I thought we would just kind of corral all of the information that we know about this show.

61
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Now, the reason that I think it's memorable and why it came up the first time on the show is that

62
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
this show aired on NBC from 2004 to 2005.

63
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
It was a single season show.

64
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I forget how many aired exactly.

65
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
It aired for the first time in 2004.

66
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
The show was being prepped for a number of years.

67
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,000
According to Wikipedia, Jeffrey Katzenberg, the king of Quibi himself,

68
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:20,000
had this idea when he visited Siegfried and Roy's secret garden in 2002.

69
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
So, 2002, they had the idea.

70
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
2004, it airs.

71
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:30,000
In 2003, Roy is attacked by one of his own white lions,

72
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
and they are still very deep budget-wise into this show.

73
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
They are committed to it.

74
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
It is far too late to stop it.

75
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,000
So, they now, in 2004, had to air a series about the lions of two characters,

76
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
one of whom in real life was mauled by one of the lions.

77
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Yes, and Siegfried encouraged them.

78
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
They pumped the brakes, and they're like,

79
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
can we not do this anymore?

80
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
And Siegfried said, no, we need to push ahead.

81
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
This is important to us.

82
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
This is important to Roy.

83
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Was the...

84
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Okay, so, wait.

85
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Was a lion that attacked Roy?

86
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Yes.

87
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Yes?

88
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
And was it that...

89
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
It was not Montecore.

90
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Montecore was the tiger.

91
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I don't think that Montecore is reflected in the series.

92
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I think it is all fictional lions.

93
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
All right, that's, first of all, that's one huge strike against this show.

94
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
It's crazy.

95
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:35,000
See, I'm seeing White Tiger, that mauled Roy Horn, here, and it's Montecore.

96
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
So, it was a tiger, but the show is about lions.

97
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I guess.

98
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I mean, as far...

99
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Again, I don't know much about the show, but I see, yes.

100
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:52,000
380-pound White Tiger is Montecore, and that's the one who was involved in the attack.

101
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Do we think they changed it to lions just to put some distance?

102
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I don't know.

103
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
It's a good question.

104
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I mean, I assume they had a lot of different types of animals in the secret garden that

105
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
they apparently have in Las Vegas.

106
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I assume it's in Las Vegas.

107
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Well, they have a lot of everything.

108
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Like, reading about the production, they made a lot of sets, you know, in the computer.

109
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:25,000
They made a lot of sets, a lot of props, a lot of original characters.

110
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:35,000
And back in the early 2000s, that took an obscene amount of manpower and processing power to do CGI.

111
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,000
That was probably some of the rationale behind, we can't cancel this thing.

112
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Yeah, because it was like...

113
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Yeah, they had built so many assets.

114
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I may have mentioned, I don't want to remind people his name in case he doesn't want to be associated with this,

115
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,000
but I do know someone who wrote to, for some extent, an onfather of the pride.

116
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
And he joined kind of late in the process.

117
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:04,000
And what he said was that were just like, he was showing the assets and it's just thousands and thousands of sets

118
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
and characters and animals, many of which weren't used.

119
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
It was all rewritten so much that it was all thrown away.

120
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,000
So what we're going to see is, you know, 10% of what was built for Father of the Pride.

121
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,000
So maybe Montecori was involved before and they got him out of there?

122
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Could have been, could have changed his name.

123
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I went on the Wikipedia, I did a little search for Tiger without trying to find out too much.

124
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:36,000
And there is a Tiger character played by John O'Hurley, one of my favorite voice actors and a wonderful guy.

125
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,000
He plays a character named Blake, who is a Tiger.

126
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,000
So that is, yes, Blake that you mentioned is a Tiger and he is a rival of Larry played by John Goodman.

127
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I don't want to find out much more, but so there's like there's lion Tiger combativeness, apparently, in this series.

128
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,000
So could perhaps Blake was like an analogous Montecori?

129
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Definitely could.

130
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I think it's best for us to assume that he is Montecori and that all of the actions that we watch him do in the show are reflective of Montecori.

131
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I will not call Blake Blake. I will call him Montecori.

132
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
We all know.

133
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:21,000
So if you catch me saying Blake, correct me, please, because Montecori, I would like to think of it as Montecori.

134
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I would like to think of him as Montecori.

135
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Do you do you guys know?

136
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
And do you guys know, like, really like what the setting of the show is?

137
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Like, if do we have any idea what a home base is at this point?

138
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I do know.

139
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I don't. I do not know.

140
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I assume it's like I assume it's like their house.

141
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I assume it's like a big like palatial mansion in the deserts of Las Vegas.

142
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I don't know.

143
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Well, do you want to know?

144
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
No, I will find out is what we'll find out.

145
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I'm just like sussing out everyone's awareness of the series.

146
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I think what else do we do?

147
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:16,000
We know. I mean, we when the first time we talked about it on the show and I cannot remember why, but I know we discussed that that we're pretty confident that donkey from Shrek shows up in the show, that it ties the Father of the Pride does take place in the Shrek averse.

148
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Yeah, I don't want to spoil anything, but I believe he shows up in the episode solely titled Donkey.

149
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Oh, wow.

150
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
That would add up.

151
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
So he's a big part of it.

152
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
He's a get. He's a big get.

153
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Yeah.

154
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Shrek characters for Fergal, Farkas and Felicia, perhaps.

155
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Oh, this is way before they were even a twinkle in Shrek's eye.

156
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Oh, yeah. Good point.

157
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Good point.

158
00:10:44,000 --> 00:11:03,000
That's I guess another important thing to note is that this very expensive series was done in the wake of Shrek mania and that Katzenberg was a golden boy and they're just throwing money as much as we can possibly throw at him to do this show as soon he will be post to the launch of Quibi.

159
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,000
You may be hearing this after the launch of Quibi, and by that point we will.

160
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Everyone listening will have every Quibi show memorized.

161
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:24,000
You will have watched every Daily Essential many times over because we are as ravenous as lions and tigers for Quibi content during this boring quarantine of Penta.

162
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
We're really the caged animals.

163
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I think we might be able to relate to Larry, especially well.

164
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
We're all in cages.

165
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
No, Larry's the lion.

166
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Oh, Larry. Sorry, sorry.

167
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Yeah, but yes, Montecore.

168
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Yeah. Are we all going to be like Montecore and and like let our rage loose on this series by the time we've watched 13 of them?

169
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Well, I like to think of the way when Roy, because after the fact Roy started to do some, you know, like damage control and say that Montecore was actually just trying to help him.

170
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:04,000
So I'd like to think that I'm going to be more helpful in this situation than rageful, but we'll see.

171
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
It's hard to know.

172
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I would guess some rage on at least one of our parts.

173
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
And maybe we should explain how we're going to do this.

174
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
We're going to take it four at a time.

175
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
We're going to break it up.

176
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
You know, it's sort of like the imagine us.

177
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
This is the podcast equivalent of the climb and free solo.

178
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,000
And we're, you know, we're going to like make it to a summit, make it through the various pitches.

179
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Let's think of the episodes as pitches climbing a cliff wall.

180
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
And we're going to do one through four and then we're going to rest.

181
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:47,000
And by rest, I mean, we're going to podcast about it for a little while and then go back and do five through eight.

182
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:52,000
And then and then the final leg, the most harrowing, we're going to close with five.

183
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
We're going to do episodes nine through 13.

184
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:01,000
But there's there's some confusion in this because Mike and I will be going off of YouTube links.

185
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:07,000
And if you want to follow along at home, you can also look it up on YouTube and we'll tell you what episodes we're doing.

186
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Jason's going off the DVD.

187
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:17,000
And that's creating some chaos in terms of which episodes we watch and what is the true order of Father of the Pride?

188
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Yeah, it seems like I mean, on Wikipedia, the list, the episode list, I think might be based off the DVD run order,

189
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:33,000
because if you look on that chart, it is not the list of air date order.

190
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Now, this said that used to be a very common TV thing that would just air episodes out of order.

191
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:48,000
And then especially with new shows, they'd air episodes out of order and then be shocked that these shows weren't a big hit.

192
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I feel like so many shows where it's like, oh, that was a fun one or two season show.

193
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:59,000
It's like, yeah, but then they just started airing the episodes in whatever order and they wouldn't make sense.

194
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Hmm. Hmm. That sounds like a problem. Well, so do we so we probably need to like check in here.

195
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Well, this is so confusing. I'm looking at the Wikipedia original pilot and then it says, no, this episode wasn't aired on US television.

196
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
So where do we go? That episode was not aired on US television.

197
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:23,000
And the Siegfried and Roy fantasy experience movie episode was not aired on US television.

198
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:33,000
And then the episode titled The Lost Tale was never animated and is solely a storyboarded, you know, animatic on the DVD.

199
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
So Lost Tale is off the table. We already said that.

200
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I think it has to be. If you if Jason, if you'd been able to deliver the DVD to us and like so that we could all rip it and then watch The Lost Tale.

201
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:52,000
But we didn't have the foresight that, you know, the corona got out and we just we just had to act.

202
00:14:52,000 --> 00:15:01,000
So we are stuck with the YouTube links. Yeah, I'm should we go through the names?

203
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Is that like, is that what we should do to make sure because I want to make sure I think the names, the episode names you mean?

204
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Yeah, yeah, sorry. Yes. OK.

205
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:16,000
OK, well, yeah, so let's just let's just decide what we're watching for block one.

206
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Yes. Why don't you let's maybe you have to dictate it as the keeper of the cleanest copy.

207
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Well, do you have the can you see that the user who uploaded all the YouTube ones?

208
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I just want to make sure all of the ones that I'm seeing are available.

209
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
That's that's a good point. Yes. We shouldn't name something that we don't have.

210
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:44,000
OK, I am. Yeah, the user is Top Tunes and there's he certainly has a lot,

211
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
but the order seems wildly different than the Wikipedia.

212
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,000
So, yeah, tell us and we'll make sure we got them all.

213
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Well, do you have original pilot? Does he have original pilot?

214
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I don't know that we if it's just called that, I don't know that we have it.

215
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I think Top Tunes, because I looked at him earlier, I think he may have listed it in.

216
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:15,000
He might have it as air date because he does he have episode one is what's black, white and depressed all over.

217
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Yes, correct. And that is episode two.

218
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Larry's debut and sweet Darryl Hannah, too. That's correct.

219
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:33,000
OK, and then that would mean episode three is probably catnip and trust.

220
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Yes. Yes. Catnip and trust number three is the name.

221
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Yeah. Do you approve of this order or is this wildly different than what you're seeing?

222
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Well, so on the original on the DVD menu, it kind of grows, goes in, I guess, the order of production.

223
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,000
They have original pilot Sam Roddy moves in catnip and trust.

224
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
But then they have one man's meat is another man's girlfriend.

225
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
And then what's black and white and depressed all over.

226
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:16,000
So I think for the sake of trying to replicate what 2004 America was like, we should go in the air date order, which I again think is Top Tunes is order.

227
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:24,000
So why don't we say for the first block, it'll be what's black, white and depressed all over.

228
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Great. Then Larry's debut and sweet Darryl Hannah, too.

229
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Great. Go ahead. And then catnip and trust.

230
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Catnip and trust. Yeah, I've been trust.

231
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,000
And then and the revolution continues.

232
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
OK. OK.

233
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Revolution continues.

234
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:54,000
So that will be our order if you're following along with it for some I think.

235
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:00,000
How many of the people listening to this Patreon, you know, it's like getting close to 2000 people.

236
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:06,000
But how many you think I want to say like five people might be doing this along with us.

237
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Mm hmm. So I'm like, right.

238
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Most people will say, yeah, you know what?

239
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I'll hear what they say about it before I make a decision.

240
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Yeah, I'm sure by the end we'll have our highlights of like our our phases, you know.

241
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. So we can give you a Cliff Notes version and the ideal order, much as you would with with with Star Wars or with Twin Peaks.

242
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
All the great pieces of art will be able to do it with Father of the Pride.

243
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,000
We may have our own preferred order, I think, by the time this is done.

244
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Yeah, yeah, we'll confer on that.

245
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:42,000
And of course, we already have our preferred naming system, which is that Blake is Montecor.

246
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Blake is Montecor. Yes.

247
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Blake is Montecor. And I'll put this on the table.

248
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Like, I'm not married to this, but like if if one of our breaks is like an extended lunch break, maybe I will I will suffer.

249
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Like maybe I will suffer and fall on the sword and watch the additional two unaired ones.

250
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Jesus. Just wait, wait a minute.

251
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Hold on. I think I know what's going on here.

252
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,000
You want that lunch break to be longer than a normal lunch break.

253
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
So you've stuck to TV shows lengths in there.

254
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
So you get an extra hour of lunch.

255
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Well, these TV shows aren't very long.

256
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
And also 35 minutes of lunch.

257
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I wouldn't say I have the biggest appetite at the moment.

258
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
All right. Fair enough.

259
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:38,000
But also, if we're just like, let's get this done, I don't have to do that.

260
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,000
We'll discuss this. I can give an update on another episode or something.

261
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
We'll see how we're doing.

262
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
The first four might dictate how much more how much you want to watch more of this.

263
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
That may be one more question before we start.

264
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Mike, you said you probably not going to make Lindsay do it.

265
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I think so far the plan is for Aaron, my wife, to do this in solidarity with me.

266
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:04,000
And that's the plan because there is jack shit else to do in this world.

267
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
So I think she's going to she's going to join.

268
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:13,000
That's the plan now. But I could see her bending very quickly once she sees the quality of the CGI.

269
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Yeah. So, yeah, we'll we'll update you on on on viewing patterns.

270
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Yeah, I my girlfriend, Jane, is watching this with me.

271
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:32,000
She has decided to do this journey with me to nice to nice to have support.

272
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Is she excited? Are you excited?

273
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Yeah, because I'm pretty stoned.

274
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
She says she says yes, because she's stoned.

275
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
That'll help. That will certainly help.

276
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,000
OK, then, well, gentlemen, we'll let's all talk.

277
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
We'll figure out it. So let's just text each other when we're heading towards the end.

278
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
But I'll talk to you soon.

279
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I'll see you see on the other side of the moon here.

280
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
We should at the summit. All right. Great.

281
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
And break, break.

282
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Well, we're back.

283
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
We haven't talked at all.

284
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Let me just say this.

285
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I'd like to quote the downtown Disney ordeal theme and just say, why do we do this to ourselves?

286
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:32,000
This is what no one was even like asking for this one really or for this to be done in this way.

287
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I well, I mean, yeah, not in this way.

288
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I think somebody actually I was just Twitch streaming yesterday.

289
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I was playing a video game.

290
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Somebody did ask for Father of the Pride.

291
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:48,000
But no one said why you should punish yourself with Father of the Pride in a short amount of time.

292
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Mm hmm. But when the alternate option is Twitch streaming, you know, look, we're all the bar of how we can entertain ourselves has been significantly lowered.

293
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:07,000
And I don't know. I think, you know, why not attempts to really rapidly rot our brains?

294
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Yeah, for sure.

295
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Yeah. I do want to get ahead.

296
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I do have to apologize.

297
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:27,000
The last episode we watched in this block and the revolution continues, I believe it was called the lobster one that that technically aired after donkey.

298
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:32,000
I had the air dates transposed on that.

299
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:40,000
So the first block in episode the first episode in block two that we're going to watch would actually be the fourth episode airing in sequence.

300
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:48,000
That said, I think it worked out because at least we have something to look forward to going into block two.

301
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:55,000
That's a good point. Yes, because I need a little bit of a I need a little bit of a boost here to get me into block two, I think.

302
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,000
So don't you definitely I'm definitely lagging.

303
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:06,000
And even though, you know, usually hearing Danny DeVito would be considered a treat.

304
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
I don't know that it really gave me the bump that I need.

305
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:14,000
That might have been the worst one. I think of these four.

306
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
I struggled the most through that one.

307
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:22,000
But I bet you know, why don't we let's go through it in order, I suppose.

308
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Starting with I don't have the full title in front of me, black and white and what?

309
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Black, white and depressed all over.

310
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
It's bleak. It's bleak and like.

311
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Well, that was that that was the Panda one. But was that the was that the first one?

312
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,000
That was the first one I watched. That was the very first one that aired.

313
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Oh, did I watch? Did I? I didn't. Did I watch them out of order?

314
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Well, we look we spelled it out. Jason really, at least all that out.

315
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
So it's on you if you did.

316
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,000
What's black, white and depressed all over was the first one to air in August 2004.

317
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:06,000
That said, I think of fitting one to air from what I read because they bombarded the airways

318
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:11,000
with commercials for this show during the Summer Olympics that year.

319
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:16,000
And apparently a lot of the commercials were about the animals being horny.

320
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,000
And this episode certainly lived up to that promise.

321
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Did you not see an episode about horny pandas, Mike?

322
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
No, no, I saw it. I watched it. I just think I watched it out of order.

323
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Oh, I see. That's OK. Yeah, I think we're all right. OK.

324
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:38,000
I think that was kind of a big revelation on my part that I didn't know.

325
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:44,000
I think I thought this was a little bit more in the Shrek zone where it was for families,

326
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
but kind of a little bit, as we love to say, bawdy.

327
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:53,000
And instead, what we found is it is a very edgy show.

328
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:59,000
It's like about fucking a lot. Yeah, it's a very horny show.

329
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
I guess we should also say what it's about now that we know.

330
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Yeah, that's yes. Yeah. The bigger primer. Yeah.

331
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:16,000
So, so, yeah, so it's a horny show for adults about John Goodman as a lion named Larry

332
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:21,000
and his wife, Cheryl Hines. And I'm blanking on her name already.

333
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
I have it written down. What's the wife, the lion wife's name?

334
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Can somebody help me here? I don't remember either.

335
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:32,000
And I'll tell you why, because I was so distracted by hearing Cheryl Hines' voice say Larry.

336
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:39,000
My first note is was this was where they like, you know, we can do like kind of an inception thing

337
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:44,000
and make people like this if people hear Cheryl say Larry, like on Curb Your Enthusiasm.

338
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,000
My first note just says the lions are horny.

339
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
You're paying very close attention. Yes.

340
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,000
My second note just says, quote, good wife time.

341
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Larry says the phrase, I still I can still have some good wife time if I get home now.

342
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Cheryl's character's name is Kate. Kate.

343
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
I was hoping Helen, but it's Kate.

344
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:20,000
The only other time I can remember one character, like an actor saying the name of a character in a movie

345
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
that's the same name as a character he played in the movie.

346
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Excuse me, a character he was addressing in a different movie is when Michael Douglas has to keep saying Scott in Ant-Man.

347
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:36,000
And of course, he has to say Scott a lot in Behind the Candelabra.

348
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Scott. Scott. Scott. What's wrong, Scott?

349
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:45,000
So when he's talking to Paul Rudd and he says Scott, I just would flash back to Behind the Candelabra.

350
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,000
This isn't with names, but the names of the characters.

351
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
I think I got a laugh in the theater when I saw it.

352
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:59,000
But when I saw Dark Knight Rises and Liam Neeson shows up and I think everyone forgot Liam Neeson was ever in the Batman movies

353
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:06,000
because Batman Begins had been so long ago and he says something in the movie about like she was taken from me.

354
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:11,000
He really enunciates taken and it really took everyone out of it.

355
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Just use a different word.

356
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Stolen, removed. Just go to the thesaurus.com.

357
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
There's no reason he has to say taken. Right.

358
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Unless it was on purpose.

359
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Could have been. I guess to Inception.

360
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
And this is from the maker of Inception.

361
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Yeah. So that's true.

362
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
I think you're onto something with your theory, Mike.

363
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Yeah, you're right about the.

364
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Well, OK, so it's the two of them.

365
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
And then they've got kids and one of them is in the movie.

366
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Yeah, he really likes Lord of the Rings, which pays off to much comedic effect.

367
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:57,000
And a younger daughter is kind of unruly and, you know, dating and doing drugs, including lady in one of these dating someone with a child, even though she's 16.

368
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Jesus Christ.

369
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
But the end, you know, it throws it off.

370
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:06,000
So that's at least that's how I wrote it off in my head as being OK.

371
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Some very confusing.

372
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
I don't want to say racial politics.

373
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:20,000
I guess I'll say racial mapping really pops in this one in that, like, there's a lot of racial mapping in this one.

374
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
I don't want to say racial politics.

375
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:41,000
I guess I'll say racial mapping really pops in this one in that, like, there's an elephant with an Indian accent, but all of the pandas have like names like Foo, Lin and Bong Bong, but are voiced by Lisa Kudrow and Andy Richter.

376
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

377
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,000
There's a slave name joke like that's my slave name.

378
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
That's my first thing he says.

379
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Yeah, there there is some weird shit in this.

380
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:59,000
I mean, you said it quickly, but like Foo Lin is obviously fooling.

381
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:07,000
I mean, right. Like, that's that's the joke is like it's like something from like that 1950s like old movie.

382
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Yeah, like an Asian name.

383
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Yeah, yeah, that it would be another word.

384
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Yeah, that's pretty it's pretty rough.

385
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Bong Bong, that's my slave name.

386
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:23,000
This is how they wanted to present themselves to America.

387
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Can I also say this is 6.8 on IMDB. That's far too high.

388
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Yeah, how is it so high?

389
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:38,000
I don't this is the when it premiered this one the week this was the most watched show of the week.

390
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,000
She is wow.

391
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:51,000
And the ratings apparently quickly fell off, often interrupted apparently by 2004 election coverage and debates and such.

392
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:57,000
I was going to save this for the episode after which they pulled it from the lineup because they kind of they skipped it.

393
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
They skipped this show for November sweeps.

394
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:03,000
They said we want to really keep the ratings good for this November this month in November.

395
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,000
This show can't be a blight on our schedule.

396
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:17,000
And the one that last aired in October before they dumped the rest in December only was watched by six point six million people.

397
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
I wanted to compare this to 2020.

398
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,000
And I was thinking about what does NBC have now?

399
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
I mean, well, they are.

400
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Which feels like about as big of a phenomenon as there could possibly that definitely feels like event viewing in 2020.

401
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Everyone's talking about it.

402
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,000
This is us gets a weekly average of six point four million.

403
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Well, oh, my God, wow.

404
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Eating show about a lion and a guy who got mauled did better than this is us today.

405
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Wow. They would kill for a hit like Father of the Pride today.

406
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:57,000
The glory days of Father of the Bride long past.

407
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:04,000
It's like if you look at the ratings for like, you know, the Magic Hour or the Chevy Chase talk show, like they were just incredible.

408
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Oh, yeah. They were just like, you know, doing the Super Bowl numbers now.

409
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Yeah, really? Yeah.

410
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:17,000
These like the steadily nose diving Oscars every year just gets worse and worse.

411
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:26,000
And I, yeah, it's yeah, if only it could have been if it could only get to the level of Kenan Iver Wayans talk show vibe.

412
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
No, he wasn't. No, I'm sorry.

413
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Sinbad was a vibe. Kenan Iver Wayans had the Kenan Iver Wayans show.

414
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:38,000
I almost that was really look, I blame it on watching too much Father of the Pride today.

415
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Of course, I know what all the bad 90s stardust work and they had 25 million viewers a night.

416
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:53,000
They were always in trouble. Everyone was always mad about 25, only 25 million.

417
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,000
You're fired.

418
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,000
I am going to be so tired by the end of this viewing.

419
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:07,000
I'm going to I lasted two episodes without my phone and I said, you know what, I'm going to sit here and I'm going to watch.

420
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
I'll put a note down once in a while.

421
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,000
And by episode three, I was like, I got to get on my phone at least a little.

422
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,000
I don't know. I need to.

423
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:21,000
I'd rather be looking at very distressing statistics about the virus.

424
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:27,000
I got to look at live updated numbers to scare and depress me.

425
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:33,000
You have to watch the live climb of the graph to distract me from Father of the Pride.

426
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:37,000
A nice, nice distraction from this cartoon.

427
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:44,000
I halfway through the second episode, I just started handwriting out the air dates of the remaining episode

428
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:50,000
because I'm like, oh, I'd rather just organize a list than watch this.

429
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,000
That gives us my full attention.

430
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:59,000
You know, it gets hard to pay attention to also because while there is a bevy of different animals,

431
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:05,000
there's like a little squirrel or something pops in all the time and there's, you know,

432
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:09,000
there's like a little snail snack.

433
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Yeah. Squirrel by played by Orlando Jones.

434
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Yeah. Jones. Yeah.

435
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:19,000
He's in there. There's, you know, there's a snail in one of these.

436
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
So they vary it up a little.

437
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:27,000
But for the vast majority of it is either white lions or white tigers.

438
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:31,000
And it gets really difficult to tell them apart.

439
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Now we did get an answer.

440
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000
There is a rivalry between the lions and tigers.

441
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:41,000
So they do explain that there are white lions and white tigers.

442
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:45,000
I think, you know what, talking about Siegfried and Roy, I was a bit confused.

443
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,000
I always thought it was mostly a tiger show.

444
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:54,000
I had never seen Siegfried and Roy like many of people around the world.

445
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,000
I was captivated by the idea of them and the idea of the show.

446
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:01,000
But I was really thinking it was just tigers and not lions.

447
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:07,000
But apparently the show was like a bunch of lions and a bunch of tigers together.

448
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:12,000
So either of you seen Siegfried and Roy? I don't think Jason has.

449
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Live? Yeah.

450
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,000
No, I've seen the like TV specials.

451
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Right. Scott, have you seen Siegfried and Roy live ever?

452
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
No, no, no, I never got to see them.

453
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:28,000
OK. Yeah, I definitely visited like the lion habitat in the Mirage.

454
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:33,000
The Mirage heavily brands each episode of the show.

455
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Yes, there's a lot of branding. Yeah.

456
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,000
You're referring to the secret gardens.

457
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Yes, that's that's we should say that's where they they live.

458
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,000
We're kind of wondering if it's about like a house or a cave.

459
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,000
And it's it's sort of both. It's kind of the middle of both.

460
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Yeah. Yes. And if I could if I can explain the opening credits and the theme song real quick.

461
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:06,000
It's the song Viva Las Vegas sung by John Goodman as you're going through like a reboot.

462
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:11,000
The CGI cartoon from the 90s level of CGI Las Vegas.

463
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Yeah. I mean, maybe a little bit better than reboot.

464
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,000
A little. Yeah, that's about as good of a critics quote as you could give it.

465
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Yes. As you pass by again, the very clear logo of every MGM resort on the strip and no others.

466
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:41,000
It threw me for a loop because in my just awful taste in quarantine boredom viewing.

467
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Recently, I watched the Flintstones Viva Rock Vegas, which has several performances of Viva Las Vegas with one key change.

468
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
And I think you know what it is.

469
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:59,000
But it was jarring for me to hear John Goodman singing it because John Goodman is not in Viva Rock Vegas.

470
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Right. Do you think this was part of the pitch?

471
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:10,000
He was so regretful about not doing the sequel and not getting to go to Rock Vegas that they said, well, now you got to actually like you got to your wish fulfillment.

472
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,000
You'll get to like right or wrong in the history of your career.

473
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,000
And he was like, that does sound good. I'd like to do that. Thank you.

474
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Always wanted to sing that song.

475
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Well, he was looking at this is this was a he had just come off Blues Brothers 2000 a couple of years prior.

476
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,000
So he was in a singing mood.

477
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
He always is. Yeah.

478
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:49,000
I actually I've let the opening play every time just because it's I it's more pleasant than watching them talk and hearing them talk about sex and just the like barrage of quips that fills every spare second of this series.

479
00:36:49,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Dated quips, I want to say, like in the first episode, this sad female panda is referred called crazy bitch and fat middle aged virgin.

480
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,000
I believe directed at one character.

481
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:12,000
The other character also shamed for being a virgin panda.

482
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,000
It doesn't Carl Reiner's character Samadhi.

483
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Did you say that harsh to her?

484
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
I believe so.

485
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
And she likes it.

486
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,000
So are very crude, but probably the most horny.

487
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
He's an old man.

488
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:29,000
He's very horny and he says inappropriate things.

489
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
He's he's not PC.

490
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:41,000
I think I think a lot of the right wing in the country today would be big Saramati fans because he doesn't let the PC police tell him what to do.

491
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:49,000
You know, he's he's kind of out of step with the world, even the world of the of Larry and the younger lions.

492
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,000
He's clearly a relic from another era.

493
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:56,000
But then you finally see him with somebody like correctly matched to him.

494
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:06,000
He gets he has like a girlfriend who is voiced by Jennifer Coolidge, who as many of her characters are is, you know, kind of a dummy, kind of a dingbat.

495
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:12,000
And he she she gets easily confused about something and he's like, you're the perfect woman.

496
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:18,000
You know, he like loves is just airbrained as a lioness can be.

497
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,000
I could see Saramati on a Ben Shapiro show.

498
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
I could see him on Huckabee.

499
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:29,000
I could see him really I could see him like really liking what like the Proud Boys are doing.

500
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Like I could see him everywhere.

501
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:38,000
I think that stand up snail would probably be there's a snail who's a stand up comedian.

502
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:47,000
And Larry the lion makes a very tame comment about his material and the snail goes, you're gay.

503
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:52,000
And I was like, whoa, yeah, jaw dropping.

504
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,000
So many of these jokes are so upsetting, even for the times.

505
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
It's like, whoa, that's not OK.

506
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Come on.

507
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Really, Steven, with the sex jokes in the in the pretty early, I still was surprised when in a pretty quick succession, they said crap, slutty and bitch.

508
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Yeah, yeah, this show is to first of all, obviously, it's it's problematic, but also just the language is maybe too much for our sensibilities.

509
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:28,000
We had the same thing you did, Scott, were like I knew it was a prime time TV show, but we were really like, oh my God.

510
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Yeah, this is not this is another level from like Shrek, like, oh, he farts or like, oh, there's a matrix joke like we were just like, ah, I also don't think like we did prime time shows in 2004 say bitch a lot.

511
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
I know it's like question.

512
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Yeah, I don't think so.

513
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:58,000
So like maybe whatever aired at nine thirty, like one network would have like one one network would have one show a year where it's like, well, this one's a little little crass.

514
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,000
This show should have been like on Cinemax.

515
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,000
This is like one of the dirtiest shows I've ever seen.

516
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Yeah.

517
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:13,000
I mean, I guess all the animals are nude, but like other than like graphic sex, I wouldn't be surprised.

518
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:19,000
I mean, I all bets are off with what they're going to say on these next few episodes.

519
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:34,000
There's a they use the word whore like because the well the character now who he realizes is who we will be deeming Montecore the portrayal of the tiger did the mauling is voiced by John O'Hurley.

520
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:40,000
He he says I'm a whore in the way of like wanting the spotlight like he can't resist the spotlight.

521
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,000
He just loves attention leads an attention whore.

522
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:49,000
But then that leads to him saying like, yeah, and you wouldn't slap a whore, would you?

523
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:59,000
It's really I try to be, you know, I try to not have steam coming out of my ears on stuff on this show if I can.

524
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:03,000
But I think I think I am offended by Father of the Bride.

525
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
You know what? You know what joke offended me?

526
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
I know we're jumping around here now.

527
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Yeah, we don't have to one by one.

528
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:22,000
It was a cover all through when when the Tigers are inside the house and they kind of let themselves in a Blake, a Montecore and his wife and then Larry and Kate.

529
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:26,000
And then they say like, I forget who says it, but somebody goes like, oh, what a nice surprise.

530
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:32,000
And Larry goes, yeah, like when the gas wears off and the dentist is buckling his pants.

531
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Oh, oh, I miss that one.

532
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Oh, no, I rewound it because I went, what?

533
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Geez.

534
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:47,000
And I guess the joke is like, that's bad because they don't want to see the Tigers.

535
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:53,000
But I'll be honest with you, the company doesn't always land perfectly on Father of the Pride.

536
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:59,000
I mean, let's not even look.

537
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Maybe there were rumors at the top, but see the whole second episode has a major plotline about a CGI Matt Lauer, who is called non threat.

538
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:20,000
I mean, there's a there's a great now you can pull it out of its context quote from either Siegfried or Roy.

539
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Or is it now because they kind of hate him through it.

540
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:28,000
I'm not sure who says it, but there is the phrase I have had it up to here with you besmirching the good name of Matt Lauer.

541
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
I.

542
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:38,000
They they couldn't have known they couldn't have known what was happening.

543
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:44,000
They yeah, I don't think it was rumored then I know who's who's to know.

544
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:49,000
I mean, honestly, they probably all the top people already knew, but they just weren't saying anything.

545
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
That's usually what happens with all this stuff.

546
00:42:52,000 --> 00:43:02,000
But this is typically I mean, this is a real product of like NBC, like cross promoting itself, which was really bad in the arts.

547
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Like, oh, cool. Look, everyone, Matt Lauer's on this.

548
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:18,000
The next episode had a lot of what I believe the term is integrated marketing where you have products in the shows because that was just like a 20 minute long 7-eleven ad.

549
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Yes. So OK, so let's let's talk a little bit about how they portray Siegfried and Roy.

550
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:38,000
They're sort of like side characters in a way, like kind of goofy comic relief side characters that do like they they live like by the animals because the animals are like kind of in their backyard.

551
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:54,000
But they're sort of just like cartoon character versions of Siegfried and Roy and they go on like little wacky jaunts, especially when they go to 7-eleven because there's one of them is thirsty, I believe.

552
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
I was confused why they were there.

553
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,000
I think I was watching a commercial and it's like, are you thirsty?

554
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,000
He's like, I told you I am.

555
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:10,000
And it's like that's that's the oh, that's the impetus for them going to 7-eleven and then ultimately working a shift there.

556
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Yeah.

557
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Which I'll say, like, I don't hate the premise of Siegfried and Roy working at a 7-eleven.

558
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:21,000
I also will say I don't actually hate the premise of this show.

559
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
It's kind of a funny idea.

560
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
I will give it to Jeffrey Katzenberg.

561
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:29,000
It's not a bad idea for a show that I'll be positive there.

562
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Have we said to Jeffrey Katzenberg gets the created by credit?

563
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Yes, he does.

564
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,000
It's really jarring when that comes up.

565
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,000
The created by created by Jeffrey Katzenberg.

566
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:48,000
You just don't you picture the creator being someone who would actually be able to write a joke or something.

567
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Yeah, that would help.

568
00:44:51,000 --> 00:45:04,000
I think the I should say the behind the scenes stuff that I know that then the the next credit is developed by and I think this is the guy who was actually doing the nuts and bolts of it.

569
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:18,000
A guy named Jonathan Groff, who was the head writer of Late Night with Conan O'Brien from ninety five to two thousand and extremely well regarded in that time and what he did there and what he's done elsewhere since.

570
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:22,000
I like all I've ever heard is that this Jonathan Groff is great.

571
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:39,000
And this show is a real proof that when you're just handed an idea by Jeffrey Katzenberg that even some of the funniest writers could not working their hardest and who were their brains at full capacity still cannot fully polish it dirt.

572
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:57,000
I would I would love to know like the full Tom Shales book about the making of this should come up like somebody should do an oral history of this because you know the notes were just like I don't want to use the word it's overused but the notes were epic.

573
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Well, here's here's one of the one other bit of buying the scenes knowledge as I said I've been I've been texting my my friends not Jonathan Groff but I just said Tommy Blotcher this writer a very funny writer ended up like was pulled in he made me work to like here and there consulted on the show a little bit like as it was pretty deep in production.

574
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:26,000
I think it was like we were you know that point where you're limited we've already animated so much we spent so much money.

575
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:41,000
There's only so much we can do but just can you watch what we've done so far and see what you think and he before I these episodes even started I texted him about it and he said well I remember them showing me a bunch and the only thing I liked at all was Siegfried and Roy.

576
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:48,000
These guys are kind of funny and there was some scene where they were in a 7-Eleven or something and I was like that's okay you just make the show way more about them like I know they're the scene stealers or just push Siegfried and Roy there's so much more interesting than these lions and them being these

577
00:46:48,000 --> 00:47:01,000
way 20 euro guys in a you know mundane place like a 7-Eleven that's all right maybe do more like that and they were like yeah you know I think so I think we will do more like that so the show from then on became more Siegfried and Roy focused and then Roy and I was like I'm going to do more like that.

578
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:11,000
So they were like in the process of more Roy the way that people have spoken this needs more Roy and then insane.

579
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Yeah well Siegfried and Roy do not do their own voices.

580
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,000
No.

581
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,000
No.

582
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,000
But we're in voices.

583
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Yeah.

584
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
I think that's what they were doing.

585
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Yeah.

586
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Yeah.

587
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Yeah.

588
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Well Siegfried and Roy do not do their own voices.

589
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
No.

590
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,000
No.

591
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
But we're involved in the show.

592
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Right.

593
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:41,000
And I you know you got to give it you got to give it up to them they're they're getting goofed on a light like lightly goofed on and they were obviously game for that.

594
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Yeah.

595
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
I too will to be willing to be.

596
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Yeah.

597
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:55,000
They don't seem to have noted it to death in terms of like we can't look stupid and they're a little fun but also kind of exhausting.

598
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,000
I don't like the voices are not my favorite.

599
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:02,000
I don't know if they're the highlights.

600
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:05,000
I'm still not they can't save it you know.

601
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Well look I agree with you.

602
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:13,000
I was just trying to be positive and say that I like them OK.

603
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:34,000
And if we're looking for if we're looking for the highlights you know what here do one of the I didn't know this existed before this episode and I think I watched 7-Eleven first when there's a scene where one of them like retrofits the Coke or Pepsi machine to play music and shoot

604
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:50,000
lasers and fog and there's a song that plays and I'm sure Scott has Scott knew this song before and I certainly did I may have heard it but I had to look it up and went oh yeah OK.

605
00:48:50,000 --> 00:49:01,000
And it is of course the theme Siegfried and Roy's like theme song in real life essentially in their Las Vegas show and it's called is it called Siegfried and Roy.

606
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,000
No the song is called Mind is the Magic.

607
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Oh right right Mind is the Magic and it is of course by Michael Jackson.

608
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,000
Yeah.

609
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
They use it.

610
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:24,000
This is a song that plays like three times every episode that they use every episode every time they walk into a room like yes.

611
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Yes.

612
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:48,000
The logic of the Siegfried and Roy characters really starts with like Looney Tunes kind of logic but then just becomes like it's like bad it's like early 2000 like webcomic stuff where people are like talking about video games and that the in the last panel someone's got like a sword like it's just like look folks it's it's funny because it's random you see.

613
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,000
A little bit.

614
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Yeah.

615
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:54,000
I heard some story.

616
00:49:54,000 --> 00:50:20,000
This this might be really super game of telephone but I feel like I heard somewhere that he Michael Jackson was obsessed with Siegfried and Roy wrote them a song just like out of the you know nobody asked him to is just like here I made you a theme song which they used and then he like you know brought it to them and like oh thank you so much and then he you know came to the show again and again and again and was at the show so much that Siegfried and Roy

617
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:25,000
were kind of like maybe if we get Michael out of here he's he's hanging around a lot.

618
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:28,000
They were like trying to get away from him.

619
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:32,000
Like this guy's a friggin weirdo.

620
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:36,000
As they're like surrounded by tigers and sparkles.

621
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:40,000
This weirdo is ruining our vibe.

622
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:43,000
I can't concentrate he's in the front row.

623
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:47,000
He's staring at me and it creeps me the fuck out.

624
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:50,000
He dresses like a freak.

625
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Correct me if I'm wrong to Siegfried and Roy by like 2002 or so.

626
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:04,000
Still very successful I'm assuming doing a Vegas residency but we're not like on TV every month anymore right like.

627
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,000
No.

628
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:09,000
Were they ever on TV every month.

629
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Were they ever on TV every month.

630
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:21,000
Or like at least every few like a Copperfield Lance Burton and Siegfried and Roy were like the TV magicians right.

631
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:29,000
I really I don't remember watching Siegfried and Roy specials on TV but I do think they had they had to have a couple right.

632
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
I'm not sure.

633
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:34,000
And when you said Lance Burton you're talking about the star of Billy Toppett.

634
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Billy Toppett yeah.

635
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
Our next torture.

636
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,000
Your next self inflicted torture.

637
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:55,000
I'm looking by the way at if you Google image Michael Jackson mind is the magic you'll end up on a photo of Siegfried and Roy helping Michael Jackson feed a baby tiger with a bottle.

638
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
Geez.

639
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,000
I don't think I've seen that.

640
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,000
I don't need to look at it.

641
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:04,000
I don't need to see that.

642
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
You can you can imagine it.

643
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,000
No I don't know.

644
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:23,000
It's even the fact that that Katzenberg wanted to do a show about this all of a sudden it is such a like rich person idea like you know I was hanging out with Siegfried and Roy and like no one did something no one was doing or thinking about in 2002.

645
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,000
Right.

646
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:30,000
You know what I think we should make a show about David Geffen's anthropomorphic boat.

647
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:36,000
You're like oh yeah okay that's everyone can relate to a expensive boat.

648
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:43,000
If we're worried about the Kevin Spacey episode getting us killed David Geffen episode will.

649
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,000
Oh my gosh.

650
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,000
Surely be the final podcast.

651
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
Yeah we're not doing that.

652
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,000
I love David Geffen.

653
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:54,000
He's great guy David Geffen has given us a lot of great music over the years.

654
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,000
He's the G and Dreamworks SKG.

655
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,000
Yes.

656
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,000
God bless you David.

657
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:02,000
But let's get back to the K a little bit.

658
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,000
Yeah yeah yeah.

659
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,000
I.

660
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:08,000
What have we what have we missed in this.

661
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,000
This is a cat.

662
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
I feel catnip.

663
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,000
Yeah.

664
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,000
When they realize.

665
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,000
When they.

666
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,000
She.

667
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:23,000
Yeah there's a cat has a drug problem and it's a little green baggy and you're like oh what's it going to be and when they say catnip I moaned really loud.

668
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:28,000
That was still probably the best of the four episodes I would say.

669
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:31,000
Maybe we'll add a seven eleven runner.

670
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
The seven eleven runner.

671
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:36,000
The seven eleven runner is the best thing so far.

672
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,000
So that episode is the best.

673
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:52,000
And it was nice to be reminded of products that we like like seeing the perfect big gulp logo and like the Sony just like seeing the just you know I get used to on a show like The Simpsons to seeing you know some funny drugs.

674
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:57,000
Or some funny joke or one of my favorite logos should be and I get confused.

675
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Where are we.

676
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,000
Yeah.

677
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:04,000
I see Mountain Dew so featured so well.

678
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,000
It's very relaxing.

679
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:13,000
There was the one gag where they were just showing an old talk show bit about fondue.

680
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,000
That was all right.

681
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:18,000
That was kind of funny weird non sequitur.

682
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
Who was in that who was in the clip again.

683
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,000
Was it.

684
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:24,000
Oh God I forget who that was.

685
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
Barbara Streisand in that clip or no.

686
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
No Barbara Walters.

687
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Thank you.

688
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Barbara Streisand is in the other episode.

689
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Barbara Streisand who what other real people.

690
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,000
Lauer's in it does his voice.

691
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:39,000
Streisand's not Streisand obviously.

692
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Dick Traney is not Dick Traney.

693
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,000
The chainsaw.

694
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,000
They call him the chainsaw.

695
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:50,000
Yeah.

696
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:55,000
James Brolin is in right because Mary DeBarbara Streisand.

697
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,000
That's James Brolin.

698
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,000
Am I wrong.

699
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,000
Oh right.

700
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Yeah.

701
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,000
He's in there.

702
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
He gets like a little bit of something to do but not much.

703
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,000
Yeah.

704
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,000
They're not them.

705
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,000
They're not playing themselves.

706
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,000
No.

707
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
They're being they're being parodied I guess.

708
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:15,000
They're in an episode called and the revolution continues that in which Danny Devito plays

709
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:23,000
Emerson an activist lobster who is fighting for different kinds of animal rights.

710
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:31,000
I mean really it's just kind of general you know like not letting you know the the the

711
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:36,000
the upper class oppress us and it's it's kind of like an animal unionized.

712
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:43,000
Plot and John Goodman's reaction throughout is like would you shut up get a hobby.

713
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,000
This is true.

714
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:49,000
I mean look they're trying to pad like we could be in unions.

715
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:56,000
We know we know what maybe the opinion is of the higher ups trying to make of course

716
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:03,000
the very relatable everyman hero Larry show his distrust for these type of hits.

717
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:09,000
Show his distrust for these type of hippies who want to unionize and want to give more

718
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
power to labor you know.

719
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,000
Yeah.

720
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Yeah.

721
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:17,000
Well when you're dealing with a movie or a TV show you know there's union rules about

722
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,000
that.

723
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
But when it's a quibi you know who's to say.

724
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,000
Yes.

725
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,000
All bets are off.

726
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:27,000
I mean who's to say we need to work with unions in any regard.

727
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
And they have a fair argument there.

728
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,000
Mm hmm.

729
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,000
Yes.

730
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:35,000
I was going to tell a story about a friend of mine who was going to be working on a quibi

731
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:40,000
and then this whole thing happened and the writers guild or excuse me the editors guild

732
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:46,000
wouldn't cover health insurance or anything because it was not technically the contract

733
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
for a regular TV show.

734
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
It was the contract for a quibi show.

735
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:57,000
So he didn't get any of the benefits that he would have gotten because of quibi anyway.

736
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,000
Cool.

737
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,000
That's a cool thing.

738
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:05,000
And also this is coming from the brain trust that made the show Father of the Pride.

739
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:08,000
So it's all cool.

740
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:11,000
Also who said part of your world should be cut from Little Mermaid.

741
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:14,000
So there is a lot of good stuff.

742
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:17,000
My good stuff happening here.

743
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:22,000
You know he gave us a show with gay rabbits.

744
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:25,000
It sounds like the voice of Bender from Futurama.

745
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,000
I think.

746
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,000
Yeah.

747
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,000
Yeah.

748
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:31,000
He does a very like Lamont and I or what like a guy.

749
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,000
Yeah.

750
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,000
Life partner joke.

751
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:39,000
There's a this had no aquatic access joke like a like a wheelchair ramp kind of very

752
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:44,000
strange very like oh OK that's not good.

753
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,000
That's not good.

754
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Probably wasn't cool back then let alone now.

755
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:54,000
Different time 2004.

756
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,000
Six.

757
00:57:55,000 --> 00:58:01,000
I mean it is it is 16 years ago years ago but it's not I mean yeah lifetime ago.

758
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
Yeah I'm watching.

759
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,000
Hello.

760
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,000
No God.

761
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:10,000
I was gonna say I just clicked on a YouTube thing called Siegfried and Roy the Magic Returns

762
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:16,000
and within a minute Steve Wynn is doing an interview of another guy who we probably shouldn't

763
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:21,000
do an episode about but I love to do an episode about Steve Wynn.

764
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:24,000
I mean his commercials as a big fan.

765
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,000
Yeah.

766
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
His feud with Joe Francis.

767
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
The girl's gone wild man.

768
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,000
Oh yeah.

769
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:33,000
Talk about that too.

770
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
There's a lot of rights.

771
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
There's a lot of right material.

772
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
The war for the shore.

773
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:45,000
The war between Trump and win for Atlantic City which Trump won and then practically

774
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:48,000
torpedoed the city a few years later when all his casinos went under.

775
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,000
Don't worry.

776
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,000
Don't worry.

777
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:54,000
Steve Wynn still a big fan of big friend and supporter of the president.

778
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,000
Yeah.

779
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
Still still on the Republican National Committee.

780
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
So yeah Steve Wynn episode.

781
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
We'll figure it out.

782
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
Yes absolutely.

783
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:11,000
I should mention that around episode four you know if you if you can if you're surprised

784
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:17,000
that Emerson the activist lobster did not quite hold my attention that episode four was around

785
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:22,000
where I started like Googling other stuff and not not focusing on the plot so much.

786
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:32,000
And that's where I discovered that Father of the Pride was honored with the Ursa Major

787
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
Award in 2004.

788
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:37,000
Do you guys know what the Ursa Major Award is.

789
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,000
I don't.

790
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,000
That's it.

791
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Tell us.

792
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:44,000
That's an award that's given out at furry conventions.

793
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,000
Oh good.

794
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:54,000
I discovered this on there's a pretty dense Father of the Pride area on wiki fur dot com.

795
00:59:54,000 --> 01:00:03,000
And so it won best anthropomorphic dramatic series in 2004.

796
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:12,000
So you know they award important works that involve I guess you know furry characters who walk on their hind legs.

797
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:22,000
So you know throughout this I might kind of be just checking in on what else you know what else the Ursa's felt it fit to honor.

798
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:33,000
Actually 2004 a big year for Katzenberg because at Anthrocon 2005 best series was Father of the Pride and best motion picture Shrek 2.

799
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:34,000
Wow.

800
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
Anthro, Anthrocon?

801
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
Anthrocon 2005.

802
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:45,000
There's they it's always called the Ursa Awards but it's always a different event.

803
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:51,000
It used to be Con Fur-ence but then since then it's been Morphicon.

804
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
It's been All Fur Fun.

805
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:59,000
It's what the Fur 2016.

806
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:06,000
So you know I'll be checking out the rest of the history of the Ursa's throughout this.

807
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:17,000
I'll say this we've championed a lot of anthropomorphic animal characters on this show and I would like an official invitation to come to this convention.

808
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
I think we should be there.

809
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:20,000
I think we should be hosting panels.

810
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:27,000
I don't need any like sexual element to the anthropomorphic animals or the love for them.

811
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:31,000
But I do believe we should have a presence there at Anthrocon or whatever it's going to be called.

812
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:32,000
Sure.

813
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:37,000
Sure I respect and fear the fairy community so I'd happily make an appearance.

814
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:46,000
Their taste lines up with us a lot because you know they gave best anthropomorphic motion picture 2009 to Avatar.

815
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:47,000
Yes.

816
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:54,000
In 2017 best motion picture Guardians of the Galaxy volume 2.

817
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,000
Alright.

818
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,000
Yeah.

819
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:59,000
Hey they're they're honoring me at a convention.

820
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
What kind of convention?

821
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:05,000
Oh I heard about this convention.

822
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:09,000
But you know what Rockets a freak.

823
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:15,000
I'll be here with bells on.

824
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:20,000
I don't care if it's a real rabbit or a person dressed up as a rabbit.

825
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
Don't make no difference to me.

826
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:26,000
I should pick a safe word huh.

827
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:29,000
How about my hands don't scan.

828
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:42,000
That's his password like that's his password for all of his stuff on his computer like he just uses that for everything in his life.

829
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
Hey give Rockets some credit.

830
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:48,000
Sometimes it's my hands don't scan one two three.

831
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:52,000
And sometimes it's gantry lift.

832
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:55,000
Oftentimes it's just gantry lift.

833
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:58,000
Gantry lift but the A is a four.

834
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:01,000
So that's how they that's how I keep them out.

835
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:09,000
That's how my password goes from weak to mildly weak.

836
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
And not strong.

837
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:14,000
Rockets always gets that bar to orange.

838
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,000
I don't keep it at red.

839
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:18,000
You think I'm stupid.

840
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
I'm smart.

841
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,000
All right we're talking too much.

842
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
We have to watch this show.

843
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:24,000
Let's let's keep going.

844
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:31,000
Okay so yes you Jason in this episode you're the you're the father keeper.

845
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
Tell us where we're going to go next.

846
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:39,000
Well okay so block to donkey.

847
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
So we're starting on a high note.

848
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:44,000
One of our friends make an appearance.

849
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:47,000
Second episode possession.

850
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:52,000
Third episode I believe it's called one man's meat is another man's girlfriend.

851
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
I don't care for that.

852
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:57,000
And then an episode called rehabilitation.

853
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:00,000
So and to put these all in perspective.

854
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:07,000
So donkey aired September 21st of 2004 possession aired October 12th.

855
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:16,000
One man's meat aired October 26th and then a long break rehabilitation aired December 21st.

856
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,000
So OK.

857
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:22,000
So the first three aired before the reelection of George W. Bush.

858
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:30,000
And then there was we knew the last ones all aired in firmly in a Bush Bush second term.

859
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:37,000
Yeah and then the air dates get even funnier in the final block of the day.

860
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:38,000
Great.

861
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:39,000
Good tease.

862
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:40,000
All right.

863
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:43,000
Meet you back here in a couple of grueling hours.

864
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:44,000
All right.

865
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:45,000
Fantastic.

866
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:46,000
Goodbye.

867
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:51,000
OK bye.

868
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
And we're back.

869
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:57,000
Unfortunately we're all here.

870
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:02,000
We left into these let's get into these hate crimes.

871
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:08,000
We left in the last one and then it is like all right back to it right back down on the couch immediately.

872
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:18,000
It's a bunch of lions all ogling a young lion's butt just instantly straight back to gross and it only got worse from there.

873
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,000
Yeah I am.

874
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:23,000
I think we were saying a little I am so sleepy right now.

875
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:27,000
I've gotten so tired in the last hour and a half.

876
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:33,000
And also I keep getting taunted by YouTube with much better videos.

877
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:38,000
And when I say like because I'm watching I've watched these of this last four on my phone.

878
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:51,000
So I'm getting all these suggestions under the video I'm watching like listen to the 22 minute soundtrack for a Tokyo Disney show called Minnie's Tropical Splash from 2016.

879
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:59,000
And I'm like I would like to listen to this 22 minutes of Minnie's Tropical Splash but I can't.

880
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:04,000
I'd rather listen to that 45 minute Bob Dylan song than watch more of the show.

881
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
Oh man I haven't listened to that yet.

882
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:07,000
I got to listen.

883
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:12,000
I will not but if somehow I was given a choice but I don't think I do have that choice.

884
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:22,000
Unless you'll let me so unless I can work out a deal with you guys that instead of watching two of these I can listen to the Bob Dylan song and report on it.

885
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
The JFK one?

886
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:25,000
Yeah.

887
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:26,000
Can we make deals?

888
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:32,000
Can we make deals to not have to do one episode but we have to do a different homework assignment?

889
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:39,000
You know this is the kind of eye jinks that like Larry and his friend Snack get up to.

890
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:40,000
Wait wait.

891
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,000
All right here's here's what we should do.

892
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
We each don't have to watch one.

893
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:47,000
We each can say no to one of the next five episodes.

894
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:54,000
But we have to be assigned a different video by another by one of us to watch in its place.

895
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:59,000
Oh so then is it still a choice or do you have to watch the other thing?

896
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:11,000
Let's you know what here in the interest of time I will say you can pick one episode you don't have to watch but you do have to listen to the Bob Dylan song and report it back to us.

897
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:14,000
All right I will I will take that deal and is that on the episode of my choosing?

898
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:17,000
Can I do it based on the episode titles?

899
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:18,000
Yes.

900
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:25,000
Do it on the episode titles and then we'll go around and each one of us won't have to watch one.

901
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:30,000
But you'll you get the first pick for which episode you don't have to watch of the next five in the block.

902
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
Oh wow okay okay thanks.

903
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:35,000
But so we need to think of punishments for for each other then?

904
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
For me and Jason.

905
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:41,000
Now Jason and I have to have so unless Jason wants to do all five.

906
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:45,000
Well yeah I'm going to say I have to see this through.

907
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:53,000
I have to I have to see them all but Mike I'll give you the option if there's some other thing you would rather do.

908
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:56,000
I absolutely would rather do anything else.

909
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:59,000
Please give me an assignment.

910
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:04,000
But it's got to be punishing to some extent because I don't want to hear that Bob Dylan song.

911
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:07,000
It has to be something you don't want to do.

912
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
So we got to think we got to think on that.

913
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:15,000
Maybe if we all talk and if Jason I kind of trade focus on that.

914
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:22,000
So we like because if the fouls are the faster we get through this discussion the faster we're done with all of it.

915
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:28,000
Well let's have the discussion if something pops into your head while we're talking you can throw it at me at the end.

916
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:29,000
Okay.

917
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:30,000
Gotcha.

918
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:31,000
Okay okay.

919
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:38,000
So let me start with you know I'll start with the this just an observation.

920
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:46,000
So this run of episodes it's a lot of sitcom go tos.

921
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
Character has to lose weight.

922
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:53,000
Character is laid up with an injury but he's actually faking.

923
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:57,000
Bring your parents to school day.

924
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:00,000
We never do anything fun anymore dear.

925
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:14,000
And they really transform those tropes into a slog just a really paid full like upsetting experience.

926
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:18,000
This makes the first four we watch look like masterpiece.

927
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
These were especially bad.

928
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:23,000
I will say I think donkey is good.

929
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:28,000
I think donkey if we're on the sliding scale donkey is easily the best one.

930
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,000
Yes.

931
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:35,000
Yeah it is really nice to hear Eddie Murphy no matter what he is better than anything else.

932
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:36,000
Yes.

933
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:37,000
Yeah.

934
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:48,000
I did not I don't I did not care for donkey's kind of his stunt double.

935
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
He's like campy.

936
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:54,000
So there are so many weird gay jokes in this show.

937
01:09:54,000 --> 01:10:00,000
Like it seems like when they couldn't think of something they would just make a just out of nowhere gay joke.

938
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:06,000
It is every single episode with such like veracity.

939
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:11,000
I can't believe this might be the most homophobic series in history.

940
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:17,000
By the way when I say I think the donkey episode is the best I am not sanctioning each joke in the episode.

941
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:20,000
No I know I know I didn't think you were.

942
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:21,000
Yeah.

943
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:31,000
So you're saying you didn't like when somebody mentioned Justin Timberlake and then Larry the funny lion said is he into dudes.

944
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
What's going on there.

945
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:36,000
I did not like that joke.

946
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:40,000
I will say that I was not I was not hooting and hollering.

947
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:48,000
John Goodman was had to say this while he is work that day was to wonder if Timberlake is gay.

948
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:49,000
Yes.

949
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
The worst thing that anyone could be.

950
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:54,000
What is that I don't understand.

951
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:59,000
And it's the next episode where the grandpa thinks the son is gay.

952
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:00,000
Yes.

953
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,000
Yeah.

954
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
It's all of them to some extent.

955
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:08,000
Even the daughter makes a joke under her breath about like oh that's a little gay.

956
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:11,000
Like what is going on.

957
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:14,000
Is every character that's making these jokes.

958
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:18,000
And I haven't watched the episode of The Simpsons where Homer thinks Bart is gay.

959
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:29,000
But in my mind that episode is more about a close minded person being opened up to like his own prejudices a little bit.

960
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:30,000
Am I wrong.

961
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:34,000
That episode is like years prior to this too.

962
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:35,000
Yes.

963
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:39,000
Years and years before and Homer learns a lesson and gets closer to his son.

964
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:43,000
Like yeah there are some redeeming elements of that.

965
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:44,000
Sure.

966
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
But that's not what that's not what's happening.

967
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:55,000
This is the show is so it's so crazy that there's there's slurs that I have I've never heard before.

968
01:11:55,000 --> 01:12:01,000
It's like taught me gay slurs that I've never heard in any I know what you're talking about.

969
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:04,000
Yeah I don't know that I want to say it even.

970
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:14,000
But how in the world how can a CGI something that we until right now thought like they try to do kind of an ill-fated trick as a show.

971
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:18,000
Let's go laugh at who knew it would illuminate slurs.

972
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
I didn't know it's yeah.

973
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:31,000
I and it's like I'm trying to think like once in a while on like stuff from the 90s or like I go oh shoot that's that didn't age well.

974
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:32,000
This is every couple of minutes.

975
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
This is every minute every two minutes.

976
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:46,000
It's it's unbelievable and I don't I really am now that we've watched so much of this it's like why didn't you guys just make something that like totally was like Shrek.

977
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:51,000
Like I don't there's no reason there's no audience more for this.

978
01:12:51,000 --> 01:13:01,000
Why would you be less like Shrek the biggest hit the most surprise like across the board said in years like we're not really going to do the whole Shrek thing.

979
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:02,000
Why not?

980
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:14,000
You should then families are watching like imagine people tuning in and like like a family and around this like a like a young boy who's like probably just discovered that he's gay.

981
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:21,000
He goes and watches this show and like oh God and he like stays closeted for longer because the show was mean to him.

982
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:24,000
This is the least for families thing ever.

983
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:28,000
It is it is why I mean it is wild.

984
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:31,000
I really I didn't expect this element.

985
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:34,000
This is the most surprising element of the show to me.

986
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:49,000
It is truly infuriating and even if we when we aren't dealing in gay slurs which every episode does then there'll be some other thing like I wrote to this some phrase about I wouldn't go to that Southern Fried Hags bitchfest.

987
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:52,000
Why do they say so much?

988
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:53,000
So much.

989
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:56,000
So bad.

990
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:58,000
It is wild.

991
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:08,000
You could really teach this like they need they need to have like if they ever show this anywhere ever again they need to have like one of those messages before it of like you know it was a different time.

992
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
And this was acceptable humor.

993
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:17,000
And really though of course like it really wasn't acceptable humor for the time.

994
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:19,000
No.

995
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:20,000
But you know.

996
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:21,000
There really should be warnings.

997
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:24,000
This season was like when Queer Eye for the Straight Guy blew up.

998
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:29,000
Like we've got like a major influx of gay culture that's very popular.

999
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:33,000
Why on just up the up the dial on NBC?

1000
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:34,000
Why are they so mad?

1001
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:38,000
Look there's a lot of confusing things happening in this show.

1002
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:53,000
The donkey episode features the Siegfried and Roy storyline where I have to give them credit this is kind of a clever idea that Siegfried and Roy are protesting a small business because it is not a good corporate.

1003
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:55,000
That's kind of funny.

1004
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:59,000
And then Siegfried fucks grandma to like get her to change her ways.

1005
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:01,000
Like that's kind of weird.

1006
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
I'm kind of that's funny.

1007
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:13,000
The premise is Siegfried and Roy are upset because some sort of small business has moved on the Las Vegas strip and they don't like that.

1008
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
They like everything being like corporately owned.

1009
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:19,000
So it's very it is I was like oh this is a very funny idea.

1010
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:20,000
I like this idea.

1011
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:32,000
And then they just quickly get out of it by having Siegfried have sex with an old woman who owns the bed and breakfast and it turns into like a horrible casino type of place.

1012
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:48,000
Yeah there's also in this episode a joke about oh Larry yells at a pig the pig agent or manager that you people killed mama Cass.

1013
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:50,000
That was very confusing.

1014
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:56,000
And then they step back the joke in a meta way for too long.

1015
01:15:58,000 --> 01:15:59,000
Yeah.

1016
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:06,000
It's yeah I'm getting ahead of my there's so much happening in the donkey episode.

1017
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:10,000
Yeah we can we can focus on on donkey for a little bit.

1018
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:21,000
You know maybe to brighten the mood I can say one thing that I liked which is that it's about the Larry's son who I don't know the name of just by watching eight episodes of the show.

1019
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:23,000
The hunter I think it's hunter.

1020
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:25,000
It's hunter.

1021
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:26,000
Hunter.

1022
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:46,000
So Hunter is at there's like a parents day like a show and tell where your parents talk about their job and the the John O'Hurley eventual mauler tiger cheats essentially but he doesn't really talk about himself.

1023
01:16:46,000 --> 01:17:03,000
He brings in his pal the MGM lion and the MGM lion puts the crest around his head and does the roar like the exact roar from the opening of all the MGM movies and and the kids go nuts and he does it again.

1024
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:04,000
I liked that.

1025
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:13,000
I liked that because maybe partially because it reminded me of entertainment that I enjoy more that begins with the MGM logo.

1026
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:14,000
I enjoy that.

1027
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:25,000
And I like that everyone calls him donkey from Shrek like everyone uses the phrases normal people use donkey from Shrek MGM lion like.

1028
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:34,000
Well yeah when it happened when the when is when Kate tells Larry that donkey is in town or I think that's what happens he goes donkey from Shrek.

1029
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:36,000
Yes.

1030
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:55,000
Which so we should note that that though donkey from Shrek is in this episode it's one of those scenarios where he's a celebrity rather than he it's not he's not from we're assuming that he played himself in the movie and he's visiting in like a celebrity way.

1031
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:59,000
He's shooting a commercial in Las Vegas.

1032
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:00,000
That's correct.

1033
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
Yes a car commercial.

1034
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
Donkey from Shrek.

1035
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:22,000
Specifically a Japanese SUV commercial and donkey says he will not get in the SUV because he's concerned because they roll over which is a very 2004 joke a lot of a lot of worry about SUV rollovers back then.

1036
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:26,000
Oh I didn't even that didn't register with me oh my god.

1037
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:30,000
Yeah you end up in this weird zone.

1038
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:46,000
Well well first of all you know another part that I liked that made me hopeful for block the two here but and then my hopes faded but when donkeys finally revealed and all stars playing like it's a song that was wonderful.

1039
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
Yes, that made me very happy.

1040
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
All star plays wherever he goes.

1041
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:59,000
And he has some self reflexive dialogue where he says babe but tell your tell your boy Shrek 3 is coming out in 2006.

1042
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
That was good.

1043
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:02,000
I like that.

1044
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:03,000
Did enjoy that.

1045
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:19,000
Then I less enjoyed what Jason alluded to which is that donkey refuses to it says oh so the MGM lion Larry has to compete with that like how can I impress my son's class and he lies.

1046
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:31,000
And he says these friends with donkey from Shrek and so then he like how am I going to find donkey from Shrek and he does so by walking right up to him in the next scene because when donkey walks through his town.

1047
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:34,000
There's no particular struggle to find donkey.

1048
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:37,000
It's just a logistics issue is manager says no.

1049
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:46,000
So instead he finds donkeys stunt double who has a very list be gay voice.

1050
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:47,000
Wonderful.

1051
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:51,000
Once again that's the great comedy of Father of the Pride.

1052
01:19:51,000 --> 01:20:00,000
So it's like don't talk as long as you don't talk then we'll get through this and all it'll make sense and we'll show and tell.

1053
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:11,000
That was all very painful to watch but you guys happen to catch an interesting name in the credits that was the voice of donkey stunt double.

1054
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
I did not.

1055
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:17,000
Donkeys stunt double was voiced by Reeve Kearney.

1056
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:21,000
Do you know offhand Reeve Kearney is.

1057
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:24,000
He's a boy who fell from the sky.

1058
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:35,000
Spider man in Spider-Man turn off the dark is the voice of the gay donkey look alike which I should mention Reeve Kearney.

1059
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:41,000
We haven't talked about this Reeve Kearney has remained very relevant on Broadway because he's in Hadestown.

1060
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:44,000
And do you know who else is in Hadestown.

1061
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
The guy who played the Green Goblin.

1062
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
Yes.

1063
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:51,000
This is an extremely popular play.

1064
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:55,000
It's Spider-Man and Green Goblin together again.

1065
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:58,000
Well yeah they both are big stars on Broadway.

1066
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:01,000
Yeah yeah usually relevant.

1067
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:09,000
So anyway I guess I felt better about this horrible scene knowing there was a connection to Spider-Man turn off the dark.

1068
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:16,000
When Broadway opens again in a year and a half we really got to go see Hadestown.

1069
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:19,000
And then just yell do the Goblin.

1070
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:22,000
Make a topical joke.

1071
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:27,000
What kind of circus tragedy is this.

1072
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:35,000
So anyway what are your guys thoughts on Donkey though.

1073
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:40,000
About the I like seeing Donkey.

1074
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:43,000
I kind of like the bit with his manager.

1075
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:48,000
His manager is a pig and I kind of like the bit where Larry has to go.

1076
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:52,000
He goes can you come to my kids school and Donkey is like of course go talk to my manager.

1077
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
And she goes not going to happen.

1078
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
And then he keeps saying yes.

1079
01:21:56,000 --> 01:22:03,000
And it felt like a very Larry Sanders style joke about like you can't you know you got to talk to the person in charge.

1080
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:07,000
And the person that's actually the celebrity doesn't have to deal with saying no.

1081
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,000
I kind of like that bit.

1082
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,000
That was a well observed yeah.

1083
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:19,000
There's a weird bit or there's a weird line when Larry says to the pig manager nice nipples.

1084
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
Yeah that's weird.

1085
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
It's not the last.

1086
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:27,000
There's another episode where he brings up someone's nipples.

1087
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,000
There's a lot of nipple talk I feel.

1088
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:30,000
A lot of nipple talk.

1089
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:35,000
When all the female characters have just these wide shapely hips.

1090
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:39,000
It's very very unnerving.

1091
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
Everything in this show.

1092
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:52,000
I was just going to say like as I was watching I noticed everything in this show is somehow very smooth but angular at the same time.

1093
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:53,000
And it's upsetting.

1094
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
It creates an unease.

1095
01:22:56,000 --> 01:23:07,000
It's just nothing's very emotive but they're trying with like probably the best technology at the at Hollywood's disposal at their time.

1096
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:11,000
But yeah it looks like shit 16 years later.

1097
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:12,000
It's really awful.

1098
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:20,000
I've tried to get through this while the kind of kind of absorbing the plots without looking at the screen very often.

1099
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,000
Just in my periphery.

1100
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:24,000
Mm hmm.

1101
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
Yeah it's.

1102
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:33,000
So I don't know I think I've said all I've had to say about donkey the episode donkey but.

1103
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:39,000
I think we can keep moving as fast as anyone wants to.

1104
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:45,000
Well let me just say I just wrote down the phrase this is upsetting and I don't remember what that was in reference to.

1105
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:51,000
It could really it was under my donkey notes but it could apply to most of these episodes.

1106
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:57,000
I wrote down the phrase this shows so bad I can't believe I'm not interviewing to write on it.

1107
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:05,000
It's surprising it's not coming back surprising it hasn't come back yet.

1108
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:06,000
For Quibi yeah.

1109
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:07,000
Give it time.

1110
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:11,000
Obviously I mean you know what can I say big fan of the original.

1111
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:17,000
I love the you know that the old man lion whose name is Sar modi Sar modi.

1112
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:21,000
I love obviously big Sar modi fan and just God bless the car.

1113
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:24,000
Reiner's still here with us to voice Sar modi.

1114
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
Don't have to replace him.

1115
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:27,000
That is insane.

1116
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:35,000
I would like that he was I believe he was 82 years old when he voiced to the show in 2004 and he is still alive.

1117
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
He's 90 years.

1118
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:38,000
Incredible.

1119
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:39,000
That is great.

1120
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:40,000
That is what you like.

1121
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:41,000
Betty White.

1122
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:44,000
Oh yeah.

1123
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
I'm also still great great.

1124
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
So that's some good news.

1125
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,000
Yeah.

1126
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,000
Good entertainers and good health.

1127
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:57,000
You got to feel good about that even if you don't feel good at all about the show they participated in a long time ago.

1128
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:58,000
Yeah.

1129
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:01,000
Gotta feel good about that.

1130
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:07,000
My question here real quick about the logistics or like the the reality of the show.

1131
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:13,000
The characters Larry Kate and then their her dad's name is Sar modi.

1132
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:18,000
Why aren't the characters all fun names like Montecore like isn't it.

1133
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:28,000
Wouldn't it be better if they were all like like like like lavish named eccentric like Siegfried and Roy.

1134
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:29,000
Wouldn't that make sense.

1135
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:33,000
They were like exotic tigers or exotic.

1136
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:44,000
So yeah and you know them being sort of like snooty stuck up or they're being a mix the one you know like there could be a real green acres thing here.

1137
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:52,000
They're like you know one of them could sound like a Gabor and and then you know mixed with a more down to the salt of the earth.

1138
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:56,000
John Goodman guy like one of them being a yes darling like that.

1139
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:57,000
That's more fun right.

1140
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:58,000
More fun.

1141
01:25:58,000 --> 01:25:59,000
I agree.

1142
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:04,000
I mean just like white lions are not generally American I guess is what I'm saying.

1143
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:12,000
I guess I guess the idea being they were probably raised here but then Carl Reiner should have an accent of some kind.

1144
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:17,000
Yeah the only only old ones are all they're all like old Jewish actors.

1145
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:23,000
There's like nobody's from Africa or any there the places where these lions would probably come from.

1146
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:24,000
Right.

1147
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:28,000
So however that is licensed to get in.

1148
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:39,000
I don't like anything they're doing but again hearing Gary Marshall and Dom DeLuise I'm reminded of other things that I like that they're part of.

1149
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:40,000
That's true.

1150
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:45,000
I'm not saying I don't want Dom DeLuise to be involved because of course I do.

1151
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:46,000
Always in anything.

1152
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:49,000
From a conceptual standpoint these are these are questions I have.

1153
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:50,000
Anyway.

1154
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:53,000
They spent so much money on guest stars for the show.

1155
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:57,000
Yeah Eddie Murphy just just that.

1156
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:05,000
What a get what a cue that Eddie Murphy was doing something on primetime that night and no one ever wants to think about it again.

1157
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:09,000
I wonder we got to find out how much he made.

1158
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:15,000
Yeah or unless it was just he just got like swindled as part of some Shrek package deal.

1159
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,000
Oh yeah maybe.

1160
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:20,000
Part of the Shrek 3 deal maybe.

1161
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:21,000
I think maybe.

1162
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:29,000
I have some little nitpicks actually there are a lot of these Aaron's nitpicks because she's she's paying better attention than I am.

1163
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:39,000
There's some some lion where the guy who's obviously the voice of Bender from Futurama says you can you can watch me lunch and but the scene is at night.

1164
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:43,000
So they should have they should have noted that one better.

1165
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:55,000
And then also there's like I lit up at this one part because there's a bottle of wine that you know that made me think about wine and that is it you know what right now it's three 30s it too early to drink some wine to get through the rest of this.

1166
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,000
I don't I don't think so necessarily.

1167
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,000
I don't think so.

1168
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,000
Quarantine there are no rules in quarantine.

1169
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:04,000
Yeah I can have a big bowl of wine for breakfast.

1170
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
That's right.

1171
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:29,000
But there's a bottle is a really clearly labeled bottle of 1997 Cabernet Sauvignon and then in the next episode the same bottle appears it's just such a like specific year and variety so you see it sticks in your head sticks in your head but that the label is you see the label and then it's read as a Shiraz is a totally different type.

1172
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:35,000
So they shouldn't like I get reusing props but they change the wine name.

1173
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:45,000
Yeah, I did not notice that detail. I've been noticing all the mirage logos on everything which is very funny so many so many mirage logos.

1174
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:56,000
Yeah, I was everywhere which is kind of like, I'm sure they were, I'm sure it's there for the practical reason of synergy. But it's kind of funny that mirage is everything.

1175
01:28:56,000 --> 01:29:01,000
Yeah, I did you kind of like that. Yeah, you're watching just casino ads.

1176
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:04,000
Night after night.

1177
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:16,000
I also wait the you know we don't like glaze past with the use of the wine is that there's there's an episode one of these there's a lot of stuff at a bar, and all these animals are just drinking human wine.

1178
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
Yes.

1179
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:28,000
Yes, I don't like liquor and beer and martinis in the opening there's a beer can all the time. Yeah, it's about a bunch of alcoholic animals.

1180
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:37,000
If they had done the analogous like catnip to weed thing what wouldn't there be an animal version of alcohol. You'd think.

1181
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:44,000
Yeah, if they don't smoke weed because I'm amazed they didn't just do that just it's just animals getting high.

1182
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
What would it do that.

1183
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:54,000
2004 I was just going to say like maybe on prime time TV they couldn't do any weed jokes, they could do a bunch of homophobic joke sure but weed.

1184
01:29:54,000 --> 01:30:04,000
You can't say we're not television in 2004 that's pretty far yeah yeah I don't know what would what animals respond to like alcohol, the tranquilizers.

1185
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:07,000
This is a big glass tranquilizer.

1186
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:10,000
They did a little of that earlier, little of that.

1187
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:13,000
So you can say that.

1188
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:22,000
I mean, a lot of this feels like really limited imagination like limited executive imagination of like well if it's a sitcom you got to have a nuclear family.

1189
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:40,000
You got to have the bar and the job and the school and it's like I don't remember is the public really that dumb or is it just you keep shoveling the same slop you know if it's just like well it's a cop show or a firefighter show or lawyer show or a family show.

1190
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:45,000
There's a show about lions who perform in a fancy show covered in diamonds.

1191
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:49,000
Why is it still just a house in a bar.

1192
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:50,000
Yeah, exactly.

1193
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:57,000
Yeah why yeah why aren't they like, like a bunch of animals like hanging out on the strip.

1194
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,000
Yes, Vegas is right there.

1195
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:06,000
It's like a fence, and we know the strip the literal strip is behind the fence, and we never get to go.

1196
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:14,000
There's a bunch of weird stuff they could get up to on the strip and all the weirds like what are the other animals in Vegas but like they're confined to this other world.

1197
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:30,000
Yeah, like part zoo and part. And if yeah if they were like we're in the casinos and then everybody would just assume they were like imagining it because they're so drunk or so high, like everybody is like wiping their eyes like an old 40s movie drunk and like boy now I've seen it.

1198
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:35,000
Oh Vegas. Boy, what happens here. Easy.

1199
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:55,000
Yeah, the circ they get talked to the Cirque du Soleil maybe maybe I'm getting ahead of myself maybe we're really going to open it up in these next five episodes and they're going to get out there and mingle with like the cast of, they see Zumanity they see the cast of the Cirque du Soleil show Zumanity which is the sexy animal show, and they get confused, you know they think these are actual animals but they're people.

1200
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:58,000
That's a good plot.

1201
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:19,000
You know, there's a lot of horniness in this show and just a few miles up the strip. One of the horniest creatures on the strip lives, David Copperfield's pal blue 32. Oh my god can you imagine dating the daughter blue date blue dates, whatever her name is.

1202
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:24,000
David Copperfield gets a shout out. He does get a shout out in this.

1203
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:30,000
They refer to the good. He's not the good kind of lady killer like Billy Dee Williams or David Copperfield.

1204
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:35,000
Not the term I would use to describe David Copperfield.

1205
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:39,000
Allegedly allegedly parody parody.

1206
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:46,000
Probably not what you should say about Billy Dee either. Just take a Google, just take a quick Google. Oh, oh no.

1207
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:56,000
Oh god. Yeah, I just, you know, maybe it's a more a character we met like, I guess, you know, who's best paired with blue 32.

1208
01:32:56,000 --> 01:33:03,000
It seems like that there was a little like squirrel or something that didn't get along too well with the snack.

1209
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:06,000
Maybe maybe she could cook up with blue.

1210
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:15,000
That's good. Whatever that character's name is. Yes, I agree. Making love, Larry.

1211
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:20,000
I don't. We should probably head back in for the final round.

1212
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:26,000
I know we should, but not without mentioning that it's not all downhill from Eddie Murphy.

1213
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:31,000
There's a there's an exciting cameo in one of these episodes from Peter Fonda.

1214
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:37,000
It was Peter Fonda. I mean, that's who they refer to him. I don't know if he did his own voice.

1215
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:42,000
I don't know if he did his voice. Yeah, he literally like that's the episode where they're working Larry too hard.

1216
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:50,000
So he fakes an injury. And one of the working things is he has to go out and hang out with Roy and Peter Fonda.

1217
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:56,000
And Peter Fonda says, where's the bong? Like, it's like, come on.

1218
01:33:56,000 --> 01:34:01,000
Are we still mystified by Peter Fonda in 2004?

1219
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:11,000
That reminded me of the first time Peter Fonda came up on the show when he opened the Harley store at City Walk and said, are you ready to start partying?

1220
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:15,000
Maybe happy to go back to that.

1221
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:23,000
Peter Fonda was just making like easy rider based cameos for like decades, I guess, because that's what this is.

1222
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:31,000
Like he's got Larry's got like a do-rag, an American flag do-rag on. Right? That's the same episode.

1223
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:35,000
Oh, yes. That's it. Yeah, I think so. That's right.

1224
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:43,000
In the previous episode, of course, One Man's Meet is Another Man's Girlfriend, a very upsetting title.

1225
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:50,000
You had Arlie Emery as a fitness drill instructor rabbit. That was cute.

1226
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:55,000
The famous always a drill instructor, Ermi, I think it's Arlie Ermi.

1227
01:34:56,000 --> 01:35:09,000
From Toy Story. If we're ready to assign the episodes, I have an idea of something of sort of equivalent length that could be Mike's alternate entertainment.

1228
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:11,000
Will he suffer?

1229
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:18,000
Well, I'm worried it won't be enough, but it does sound it sounds like suffering to me.

1230
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:24,000
I'll say. But I guess I'm worried I'm I mean, I might have more fun listening to the Bob Dylan song, too.

1231
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:28,000
There's always a chance with these alternate options. Right.

1232
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:34,000
Though it is a little bit longer. You could just watch an equivalent amount, I suppose.

1233
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:46,000
Inspired by Peter Fonda's appearance in this episode and the reference to the film that he's in, Yuli's Gold.

1234
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:57,000
I thought that maybe you could instead of watching one of these five episodes, you could watch a 1998 interview with Peter Fonda on Charlie Rose,

1235
01:35:57,000 --> 01:36:05,000
where he discusses his role as a beekeeper in Yuli's Gold and his memoir, Don't Tell Dad.

1236
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:11,000
All right. I accept that. I accept that as my alternative.

1237
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:18,000
I mean, I look, I honestly it sounds it sounds really good compared to what you guys are what Jason's going to have to do.

1238
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:25,000
So guys lived an interesting life. Probably a good day about his memoir film legend.

1239
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:29,000
He was an easy rider. Did you hear motorcycles?

1240
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:39,000
I'm reading the transcript, you know, they're talking about dirty Mary, crazy Larry.

1241
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:43,000
And he just won a film critic circle award.

1242
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:48,000
1998 was a big time for Peter. So I'm excited to send you back to that era with him.

1243
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:51,000
That's great, Jason. Let's let's.

1244
01:36:51,000 --> 01:37:01,000
The last thing I wanted to say was that there was a bunch of like weird jokes about like people cutting themselves and like like weird upsetting like suicide jokes that weren't funny.

1245
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:09,000
Yeah, there was a really like there was an odd Kirstie Alley fat joke that then the characters like, why did I make that joke?

1246
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:20,000
That's a Siegfried and Roy drinking in the lobby of the Betty Ford Center was one of the grimest psych acts I've ever seen.

1247
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:27,000
Yeah, yeah, I don't. All right. That's unless you got something else. Let's do the next episode.

1248
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:32,000
So it's Jason. All right. So this is where the episodes start to get even stranger.

1249
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:39,000
So let me read you off the OK. So the first three, I'm going to tell you the titles together.

1250
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:44,000
And there's a reason I'm doing that. So our money moves in is one.

1251
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:49,000
Then there's another episode called Road Trip.

1252
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:53,000
And then there's another episode called the Thanksgiving episode.

1253
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:57,000
Now, you're probably going, oh, I know when that one aired, but you're wrong.

1254
01:37:57,000 --> 01:38:03,000
All three of those aired the same night, December 28th, 2004.

1255
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:12,000
You know, New Year's, the week between Christmas and New Year's, when new shows don't typically air.

1256
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:17,000
Well, they did the burn off. They did the one night burn off.

1257
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:25,000
Then there's an episode called Stage Fright, which on the DVD they refer to as an alternate pilot.

1258
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:34,000
Stage Fright is the last episode to air in the United States that aired May 27th, 2005.

1259
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:44,000
And then the very last full episode, the Siegfried and Roy fantasy experience movie never aired in America.

1260
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:49,000
It only aired in the UK and it's on the DVD. It is on that YouTube playlist.

1261
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:59,000
So I'll leave it to you guys if you would like to choose from those titles what you want to skip.

1262
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
Do you have a knee jerk?

1263
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:10,000
I would like to skip Sarmati Moves In because Sarmati is so unpleasant.

1264
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:14,000
I'm really, I'm really sick of Sarmati.

1265
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:20,000
I, yeah, that's a really good pick.

1266
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:27,000
So I think I'm going to need the break the most later on.

1267
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:34,000
So I'm going to I'm going to cancel that stage fright and come back for the Siegfried and Roy fantasy experience movie.

1268
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:37,000
Though I don't think I'm going to like any of these episodes.

1269
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:45,000
I do know in advance that the Thanksgiving episode and Siegfried and Roy fantasy experience both have writing credits from David Goodman,

1270
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:53,000
the head of the WGA who has led a fight that I believe in leaving the agents and the ATA.

1271
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:59,000
And he's very good and funny in these meetings and just seems like a good guy.

1272
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:08,000
So in support and solidarity with David Goodman, I'm going to watch both of his episodes and I will skip stage fright.

1273
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:11,000
OK.

1274
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:19,000
All right. So, Mike, I will email you Charlie Rose's 1998 interview with Peter Fonda, which you'll get to first.

1275
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:24,000
It would seem I will listen to this inscrutable Bob Dylan song.

1276
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:34,000
And we I don't think the reports have to be very lengthy, but, you know, we should say make sure we should show our work, make sure that we did actually check these things out.

1277
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:37,000
All right. I'm also going to eat something so I don't pass out.

1278
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:40,000
Yes, sure. OK, so we'll be looser on the return time.

1279
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:46,000
But for you, the audience, it'll happen in just a moment. Bye bye. Bye.

1280
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
Well, welcome back, everyone.

1281
01:40:52,000 --> 01:41:01,000
We've completed the gauntlet, finished the series, and I'm going to go ahead and say, much to my surprise,

1282
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:08,000
that last block of episodes were the most pleasant of them all.

1283
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:13,000
Am I crazy? Am I wrong? You guys seem surprised that I am surprised.

1284
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:16,000
Yeah, I look, I missed one of them.

1285
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:22,000
The last one I did like more, but, you know, it's still very relatively speaking.

1286
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:27,000
I'll say this. There's two. There's two jokes. One is in the one with David Spade is the Fox.

1287
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:32,000
First of all, I kind of thought Spade was OK as the Fox. I kind of like that character.

1288
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:40,000
He he says he's going to like take care of something and he's going to distract a bus and he like stops in front of the bus as if it's like he's going to make it stop.

1289
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:43,000
And then the bus rolls over him. Pretty good gag. That was a good gag.

1290
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:46,000
Yeah. And there's a joke later. I forget which episode.

1291
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:53,000
Oh, I think it's the it's the Kelsey Grammer one where one of Siegfried Roy tells Kelsey Grammer that as a child,

1292
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:57,000
his dad made him watch a son of music and root against the von Trapps.

1293
01:41:57,000 --> 01:42:01,000
Yeah, that's a good joke. I like that joke. That's a solid joke.

1294
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:05,000
Other than that, I don't know. It wasn't that much different than the rest.

1295
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:09,000
I thought these were less hateful overall.

1296
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:15,000
The Thanksgiving one. Well, OK, the Thanksgiving one did not land. Yeah, the Thanksgiving. OK.

1297
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:19,000
But the Thanksgiving one is maybe the worst one of all of them.

1298
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:22,000
That is probably the it it.

1299
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:25,000
But don't you think it was trying something?

1300
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:29,000
I guess it was trying something.

1301
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:33,000
It really ate shit every single place it tried to go.

1302
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:37,000
That episode was so unpleasant. Extreme. That's that's the word.

1303
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:41,000
Yeah. Yeah. You watched that one, right? That was that was still on my list.

1304
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:47,000
Yeah, it was sort of a the what's your name?

1305
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:49,000
I already don't remember her name.

1306
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:52,000
Karen Kate Kate Kate.

1307
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:56,000
Cheryl Hines is running for president of the PTA

1308
01:42:56,000 --> 01:43:03,000
and finds that there's like a block of voters that she has to please or she offends them or something.

1309
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:05,000
And that's the that's turkeys.

1310
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:09,000
She says all turkeys look alike. That's OK.

1311
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:12,000
Yeah. But it was so confusing.

1312
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:15,000
The metaphor got so confusing at some point.

1313
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:17,000
Like it didn't really mean did you.

1314
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:21,000
Jason, did you get high in between the last time you recorded it now?

1315
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:29,000
OK, I'm drinking a beer and and and I took a few puffs out of a.

1316
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:32,000
Yeah, we figured it out.

1317
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:37,000
What is the missing element that made it more?

1318
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:42,000
No, I thought something Thanksgiving was the worst.

1319
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:45,000
But like I thought stage fright, the one was Kelsey Grammer.

1320
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:48,000
So that's what the DVD says.

1321
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:49,000
That is the reworked pilot.

1322
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:51,000
So I think that was supposed to.

1323
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:56,000
I think the intent of the show was that that would be the first one.

1324
01:43:56,000 --> 01:44:03,000
And then the second one would be Sam Roddy moves in, which somewhere along these episodes,

1325
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:06,000
I think they started pronouncing his name differently.

1326
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,000
Am I crazy?

1327
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:13,000
You you could have said anything and I would have gone, oh, yeah, OK.

1328
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:16,000
And I've said his name like three or four times already.

1329
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:17,000
I don't remember it.

1330
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:19,000
Or Moody's Sarmo.

1331
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:26,000
I think storyline wise, it would make more sense that he retires and then he moves in with the family.

1332
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
It was just happening without explanation.

1333
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:31,000
Like suddenly, like we've seen him there before.

1334
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:37,000
Right. I think those were meant to be the first two episodes and then shit aired.

1335
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:40,000
Fucked up, you know.

1336
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:43,000
That's a good description of the entire series.

1337
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:44,000
Shit.

1338
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,000
I fucked up, yo.

1339
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:53,000
But the Siegfried and Roy fantasy experience movie had a I like the gag where they there's one bulb out in their giant sign

1340
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:57,000
and they skydive out of a helicopter to fix it.

1341
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:59,000
Oh, yeah, that's all right.

1342
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:02,000
I like the commercial for the competing magician.

1343
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:03,000
I like that, too.

1344
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:04,000
That was good.

1345
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,000
That was finally something good.

1346
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:09,000
And I like that they're performing at a casino called the Fandango.

1347
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:13,000
I think that's a really good approximation of a casino name.

1348
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:15,000
I agree with that.

1349
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:20,000
But then also, I don't tell me if I'm wrong.

1350
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:30,000
I don't think there is a single one that didn't fulfill the the the father of the pride base of having a homophobic joke.

1351
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:35,000
I think every single one had had one at least, if not way more.

1352
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:37,000
I think that's correct.

1353
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:42,000
I think one or two of these later ones did not.

1354
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:48,000
Maybe I all I know is that I did like this one more for the most part.

1355
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:52,000
And then right at the end, they got like, oh, they just checked them off.

1356
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:54,000
There's the gay one. There's a trans joke.

1357
01:45:55,000 --> 01:46:06,000
And then that one is about, yeah, Kate is in like a women's group and Larry is wondering what's going on, what crazy ideas are they putting in her head?

1358
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:14,000
And right at the end of the episode, he charges into the women's group meeting and says, give me back my wife, you crazy lesbians.

1359
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:17,000
Yeah, yeah, that's true.

1360
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:20,000
OK, yeah, that wasn't great.

1361
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:25,000
But I like seeing that same bottle of wine again.

1362
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:28,000
It was nice to see it for a third time.

1363
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:34,000
And I love that this episode was a good chance to reference Bill friggin Murray.

1364
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:41,000
All we was a big Larry's plan with all of his buddies, like his orangutan friend and everybody else is there.

1365
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:46,000
All the guys are going to get together and watch all their favorite Bill Murray movies.

1366
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:51,000
Let me tell you, if Bill Murray is referenced, that's all I need.

1367
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:54,000
No more jokes needed. No more content needed.

1368
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:57,000
Say the name and I'm satisfied.

1369
01:46:57,000 --> 01:47:02,000
You love it and you go deep like you're a broken flowers guy, you know.

1370
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:05,000
Well, he doesn't need broken flowers.

1371
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:11,000
He just needs a picture of that icon of partying and chilling out.

1372
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:12,000
That's all you need.

1373
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:14,000
You just need like a reddish t-shirt.

1374
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:15,000
Give me meatballs. Give me.

1375
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:18,000
Let me see that floppy caddy shag hat.

1376
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:20,000
That's that's all I need, man.

1377
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,000
He's the king of the bros.

1378
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,000
Dolly Llama.

1379
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,000
He carried for him.

1380
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:32,000
Yeah, the dolly Murray in Murray, we trust.

1381
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,000
I think so.

1382
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,000
I would say that's right.

1383
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:37,000
I'm a Murray bro.

1384
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:39,000
Murray or bust.

1385
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:41,000
I call him like like my boy Danny A.

1386
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:44,000
I like to call him the Murray Kane.

1387
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,000
That's what Danny Danny Ackroyd calls him.

1388
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:47,000
Oh, boy.

1389
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:48,000
Oh, boy.

1390
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:49,000
Murray Kane.

1391
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:51,000
And that's what his friends call him is Danny Ackroyd.

1392
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:53,000
So you feel like like a friend there.

1393
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:56,000
They're all their friends.

1394
01:47:56,000 --> 01:48:00,000
The one where OK, the episode now we're getting all over the place here.

1395
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:09,000
Can you have a work where Larry's wife, Kate goes and goes to a women's group is like the most sitcommy.

1396
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:16,000
Homer Simpson ripoff episode that I just so I just oh, I checked out.

1397
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,000
You must have been having a fun party over there, Jason.

1398
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:22,000
I don't know what you must have been like really comparably.

1399
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:31,000
I just thought the second block of episodes was so grim that there was the slightly more competence.

1400
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:38,000
I guess I was just so drained after the second block, the slight appearance of competence in a couple of these episodes.

1401
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:39,000
Perked me up.

1402
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:46,000
Well, look, dear listeners, when you watch all 13 of these episodes, you'll have to let us know.

1403
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:54,000
Did you find the last five more competent or is CGI, CGI, Kelsey Grammer and cat cat.

1404
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:56,000
But didn't look very good.

1405
01:48:56,000 --> 01:49:00,000
No, but it but was Kelsey Grammer.

1406
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:01,000
That was his voice.

1407
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:04,000
Unlike CGI Martin Scorsese, which was clearly not.

1408
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:08,000
I just feel like you got CGI, Kelsey Grammer.

1409
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:10,000
They don't really do much with him.

1410
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:11,000
That's true.

1411
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:19,000
I can't believe of all the ones that I sat out that the one that I arbitrarily said out that was the one with a creepy CGI, Kelsey Grammer.

1412
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:21,000
Yeah, I really fucked up.

1413
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:22,000
That's a tragedy.

1414
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:25,000
Although it's not because the episode was not good.

1415
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:28,000
OK, which one did you sit out?

1416
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,000
What's his name?

1417
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:32,000
The old man on the stage.

1418
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:34,000
The state's are moody moves in.

1419
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,000
Moody moves in.

1420
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:40,000
I have the least I I left my body in now.

1421
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:41,000
I don't I have no idea.

1422
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:43,000
I really don't know.

1423
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:44,000
I it's early.

1424
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:48,000
Somebody in it says, I know you won't come here without my money.

1425
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,000
Beotch.

1426
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,000
I know that about it.

1427
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:55,000
They explain how they get the rug.

1428
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:58,000
They explain how they get the zebra rug.

1429
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:01,000
Is that in other episodes?

1430
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:04,000
And then this does appear in other episodes.

1431
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:05,000
That's right.

1432
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:06,000
So there's a rug.

1433
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:08,000
There's a rug the entire time.

1434
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:15,000
But then oddly nine episodes in, you find out why they have a rug because they aired in a bizarre order.

1435
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:16,000
Yes, I believe so.

1436
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:22,000
This episode also features snack, kind of gets tossed or is running away.

1437
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:33,000
He he runs over three women lying on rafts in a pool and each woman's bosom plays the NBC jiggle.

1438
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:36,000
Ding ding ding ding ding ding.

1439
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:38,000
Fuck that shit.

1440
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:43,000
Garbage all garbage.

1441
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:45,000
I don't want to jump.

1442
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:46,000
I'm all over the place.

1443
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:50,000
I'm now I'm just mad now looking through my notes in my picture.

1444
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:53,000
I took pictures of the show.

1445
01:50:53,000 --> 01:51:02,000
They're like the joke of like the turkeys are coming over and then the old man is really racist against turkeys and then they're about to feed him corn and he's like, no, that's a stereotype.

1446
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:05,000
But then the turkeys like corn afterward.

1447
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:07,000
They're like, I guess they like corn.

1448
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:10,000
And then the old man accuses the turkeys of stealing his watch.

1449
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:11,000
Excuse me.

1450
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:14,000
Saramati accuses the turkeys of stealing his watch.

1451
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:17,000
But then they did steal his watch at the end.

1452
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:22,000
Like the whole episode, that's the sucks so bad.

1453
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:23,000
It's so bad.

1454
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:26,000
Principal appears to be Tress McNeil.

1455
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:27,000
Is that right?

1456
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:28,000
I believe that's right.

1457
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:30,000
Yes. Sounds like Lindsay Nagle.

1458
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:31,000
Yeah.

1459
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:34,000
There's a James Carville turtle.

1460
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:35,000
Huh?

1461
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:36,000
Huh?

1462
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:39,000
That was I didn't catch that metaphor at all.

1463
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:42,000
I thought that was like they were doing a James Carville voice.

1464
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:43,000
I don't know.

1465
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:44,000
That episode was such a mess.

1466
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:50,000
It was the turkeys are kind of stand ins for for Jewish people at times,

1467
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:54,000
but also Mexicans, but also Native Americans.

1468
01:51:54,000 --> 01:52:00,000
Like it's all it's it changes and bends what exactly they're a metaphor for.

1469
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,000
And then are they good or are they bad?

1470
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:04,000
And they're sort of all at once.

1471
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:07,000
And they accused the turkish appearance.

1472
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:10,000
So they go like, yeah, you know, the white man took the land from the Native American,

1473
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:13,000
but the Native American took it from the turkey.

1474
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:16,000
You're like, oh, my God, what is what are we doing here?

1475
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:17,000
I'm worried.

1476
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:20,000
What is the more that we talk about this episode?

1477
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:22,000
It's someone that will say a quote that's just from the show.

1478
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:25,000
And then someone will just snip only that.

1479
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:28,000
And then we'll get we'll get Shane Gillis.

1480
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:31,000
Then where it'll be a wrongful Shane Gillis thing.

1481
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:33,000
Well, right. I mean, his wasn't taken out of context.

1482
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:36,000
It was. No, I'm saying it's an incorrect being incorrect.

1483
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:39,000
Shane Gillis thing, which is was correct.

1484
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:43,000
When like you'll have to like distance yourself from me online.

1485
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:47,000
Yeah, we're all going to have to do it because we watched the show.

1486
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:49,000
They're going to stitch together a bunch of stuff.

1487
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:54,000
Somebody else stitched together me saying it was wrong to get rid of Shane Gillis.

1488
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:57,000
I just said it. I just volunteered it.

1489
01:52:57,000 --> 01:53:03,000
What am I doing? The longer I talk, the more we're all providing cancelable quotes.

1490
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:08,000
I mean, the weirdest part is that Mike substitute watch

1491
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:14,000
the fine print on Mike watching that interview is that he has to do a long segment

1492
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:18,000
about how Charlie Rose was robbed and he's actually innocent.

1493
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:20,000
Right, Michael? You agree to that?

1494
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:23,000
No, I did not agree to that. That was not part of the deal.

1495
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:27,000
You said I am the head of the Charlie Rose Innocence Project.

1496
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:32,000
I have not. I know. I disavow any knowledge of the Charlie Rose Innocence Project.

1497
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:39,000
They're going to just say somebody's going to clip out this and just I avow the Charlie Rose Innocence Project.

1498
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:43,000
Oh, I do not avow. I do not avow. We're screwed.

1499
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:47,000
I'm about to go ahead.

1500
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:55,000
I was going to how about Larry on the no his wife's and his anniversary when he loves to put on a Jimi Hendrix wig

1501
01:53:56,000 --> 01:54:00,000
and play Jimi Hendrix music. That's the thing he does.

1502
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:04,000
He wears a wig that looks like Jimi Hendrix's hair.

1503
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:10,000
And they cleared the songs that like clear the pain for Jimi Hendrix music.

1504
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,000
They cleared the songs.

1505
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:16,000
But what about the Ghostbusters sound alike song that plays over the credits?

1506
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:20,000
That's not that one. No, they didn't do that.

1507
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:23,000
They didn't clear that with the logins.

1508
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:35,000
What with all these Jimi Hendrix song clearances, you know, you don't wonder how the math sorted out to where each episode cost two point five million dollars.

1509
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:39,000
Hmm. I wonder. God.

1510
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:43,000
There's a broader issue in a lot of episodes.

1511
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:46,000
And again, I credit Aaron with this observation.

1512
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:53,000
How come so they were soon as Siegfried and Roy show up anywhere, they all they dropped to all fours.

1513
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:57,000
Right. That's that's kind of the premise that they all stand on hind legs.

1514
01:54:57,000 --> 01:55:02,000
But there's sort of a Toy Story thing going on where like they are Rugrats more accurately.

1515
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:07,000
We're like Siegfried and Roy don't know they talk in the way the parents don't know the Rugrats talk.

1516
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:11,000
That's right. So there's this ruse being kept up.

1517
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:15,000
But they like it's always like we got caught like quick on all fours, everyone.

1518
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:25,000
But that's what that happens when Siegfried and Roy walk up and talk to them in front of their homes where they have television sets and furniture.

1519
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:28,000
Why? So they're allowed to have all that.

1520
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:36,000
They all have like recliners and, you know, Wi-Fi routers, but they don't have they can't stand up and talk.

1521
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:42,000
They also always look very indifferent at Siegfried and Roy or mad.

1522
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:48,000
I would say there is no relationship between the animals and Siegfried and Roy.

1523
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:57,000
I mean, the most relationship happens when Snack becomes friendly with Roy on the Thanksgiving episode.

1524
01:55:57,000 --> 01:56:00,000
He says his hair smells like home.

1525
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:08,000
Yes, we can snack and also Roy hugs Snack and then he comments on the fact that Snack has a penis as a boner.

1526
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:11,000
It's probably a boner, right?

1527
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:14,000
Because there's like a romantic thing between Snack and Roy.

1528
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:23,000
But then Roy takes another animal as a pet and they play it off like Roy is caught Roy's caught between two lovers.

1529
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:26,000
This show is so weird.

1530
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:29,000
I just wanted to put some stuff in perspective for you guys.

1531
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:30,000
Yes.

1532
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:36,000
Since Scott, you said two to two point five million an episode for the budget of this show.

1533
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:37,000
Yeah. Yeah.

1534
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:46,000
The it appears the average budget for an episode of Mad Men, a very expensive prestige television, was two to three billion.

1535
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:47,000
What?

1536
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:48,000
Yes, that's right.

1537
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:58,000
A show filled with period details and like actors who were multi seasons in like, you know.

1538
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,000
Dear Lord.

1539
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:01,000
Oh, my God.

1540
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:03,000
Sometimes the same as Mad Men.

1541
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:04,000
This cost.

1542
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:05,000
Sometimes the same.

1543
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:06,000
Yeah.

1544
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:08,000
Sometimes the same.

1545
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:12,000
May cost more than an episode of Bad Men.

1546
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:13,000
Fuck God.

1547
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:24,000
I think I knew the show was going to be not good, but I didn't think it would be so just abrasive and headache inducing and that there'd be things about erections and pitching tents.

1548
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:32,000
So often and again, I cannot underline enough gay jokes in every single one of them.

1549
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:33,000
Yeah.

1550
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:34,000
Yes.

1551
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:35,000
Why?

1552
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:36,000
I never go to see this coming.

1553
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:37,000
A larger.

1554
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:45,000
Even for again, for the time being, I think it's the show is really just a show that's not going to be a good show.

1555
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:47,000
It's not going to be a good show.

1556
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:49,000
It's not going to be a good show.

1557
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:51,000
It's not going to be a good show.

1558
01:57:51,000 --> 01:58:00,000
A large about even for again, for the time, a lot to me, like you wouldn't be like, oh, well, that's obviously every show was like that at the time.

1559
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:01,000
It wasn't.

1560
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:02,000
I don't think.

1561
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:09,000
No, I just I've watched shows from before this from the 90s from the 80s.

1562
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:10,000
What?

1563
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:19,000
Like unless things suddenly turned really toxic just for like a year there and we'd go back and watch any like According to Jim is just full of like I mean, maybe that's right.

1564
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:20,000
Yeah.

1565
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:21,000
Well, of all the shows.

1566
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:22,000
Yes.

1567
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:23,000
That one's the most likely.

1568
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:24,000
You picked According to Jim.

1569
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:25,000
I don't know.

1570
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:27,000
It could be every other every other sentence.

1571
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:33,000
But just Jag has a monologue in every episode about keeping those homosexuals out of this.

1572
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:37,000
I really said, no one's ever actually paid attention to Jag before.

1573
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:39,000
That's why you did.

1574
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:40,000
Yes.

1575
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:41,000
All of the show.

1576
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:42,000
That's all the CBS shows we all make fun of.

1577
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:43,000
Who watches this?

1578
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:48,000
It's because touched by an angel is excessively homophobic every time.

1579
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:56,000
Hawaii Five-O is still on the air nine seasons in and it's just full of gay jokes still in 2020.

1580
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:59,000
And I think it's how crass they are in this.

1581
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:02,000
Like, well, you didn't need to fill that time.

1582
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:09,000
Like you could have just ended that scene or just had a non sequitur about something else like it.

1583
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:10,000
Yeah.

1584
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:11,000
Yeah.

1585
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:12,000
Anything else could have been done.

1586
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:19,000
And speaking of doing other things, Mike and I got to take some well-deserved breaks.

1587
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:24,000
Mike, how did you feel about your break time?

1588
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:37,000
Oh, I loved listening to one of the great actors of our of our time, I guess of a different time, talk about making the Oscar nominated Golden Globe nominated winning.

1589
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:39,000
Julie's gold.

1590
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:45,000
Of course, Peter Fonda played Julie Jackson, sort of a reclusive beekeeper.

1591
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:49,000
And I learned a lot about sort of the making of the movie.

1592
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:56,000
I learned I forget that I'm forgetting the director's name, but they referred to him as the gentle bear on set.

1593
01:59:56,000 --> 02:00:03,000
And Peter Fonda, he he basically he loves working with this with this director and he would he said he'd love to work with him.

1594
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:05,000
He said he'd carry water on the set.

1595
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:07,000
That's how much he liked working with this guy.

1596
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:10,000
And he was just sort of explaining his process.

1597
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:13,000
You know, he's just he looks smaller is better, he thinks.

1598
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:21,000
And he was talking about his father, the great Henry Fonda, who was a bit of a withholding type, to be very honest, towards the end of their life.

1599
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:24,000
Let's see who the Dan refers to in the book.

1600
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:27,000
His memoir, which is also discussed.

1601
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:32,000
His memoir memoir is discussed and he was a bit withholding when he was a youth.

1602
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:41,000
But toward the end, I think they had a better relationship and he was talking about acting and, you know, playing things more internal, throwing things away.

1603
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:52,000
And it's like how is Dad Henry Fonda threw away the last line of of Grapes of Wrath, which, of course, laid John Steinbeck's work bare for the audience to really absorb it.

1604
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:58,000
And I found this interesting process, a little bit of personal history, show business history.

1605
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:01,000
This is by far the highlight of my day.

1606
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:09,000
I would say without question, but in Saramani moves in Siegfried develops a gambling problem.

1607
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:12,000
He almost blows the whole fortune.

1608
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:14,000
He almost blows the whole fortune.

1609
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:16,000
They finally go to a casino floor.

1610
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:23,000
And I'm surprised for a movie that probably got some kickbacks from Vegas or the Mirage MGM company.

1611
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:27,000
They were showing a negative portrayal of gambling.

1612
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:33,000
Hmm. Well, you know, they got they were allowed to get a little irreverent in some of these storylines.

1613
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:37,000
Look, that sounds great. Will I ever watch that?

1614
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:41,000
No, I will say I will never watch that episode.

1615
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:45,000
Never, ever, ever watch Saramani moves in.

1616
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:47,000
I will never watch Saramani moves in.

1617
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:50,000
What if I were to tell you that Dick Cheney is back?

1618
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:53,000
There's another Dick Cheney site gag.

1619
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:56,000
Why is Dick Cheney in so many episodes?

1620
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:59,000
It was just a zeitgeisty reference.

1621
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:02,000
So sticking it to the man.

1622
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:07,000
The reelection committee like slipped them some like we'll cover an episode.

1623
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:09,000
We'll cover an episode for you.

1624
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:11,000
We just got to get our boy in there.

1625
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:16,000
They were probably wondering if we could, you know, like, can we use his likeness?

1626
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:20,000
Is that OK? And then Katzenberg caught wind of it and like, I'm on a boat with him right now.

1627
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:21,000
I'll ask.

1628
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:24,000
Mm hmm. It's OK. It's not going to look like him anyway.

1629
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:26,000
Who gives a shit?

1630
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:32,000
How good do you think our rendering is?

1631
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:35,000
It's going to look like a sim.

1632
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:40,000
I do think you're likely to watch the film Yulis Gold.

1633
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:49,000
If in the next couple of weeks I just happen upon it, if it happens to be like free streaming on crackle or to be, do you know to be?

1634
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:52,000
I do. I do have to be downloaded. Yes.

1635
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:55,000
T-U-B-I to be they have some free movies on there.

1636
02:02:55,000 --> 02:03:00,000
I've recently learned if it's if it happened to be streaming, would I throw it on?

1637
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:03,000
Oh, sure. I got news for you, Mike. It's on Hulu.

1638
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:05,000
Is it really?

1639
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:10,000
I almost thought about having you watch 22 arbitrary minutes of it.

1640
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:17,000
And then I realized it'd be more enriching for you to learn about Peter Fonda and his process.

1641
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:25,000
I think you made the right call, but that does not that does not mean I don't want to see the story of Yuli Jackson.

1642
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:28,000
He was a beekeeper.

1643
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:32,000
Why is he reclusive?

1644
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:37,000
He doesn't really get into that so deep, but he did win the Golden Globe for it.

1645
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:38,000
I'll say that.

1646
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:40,000
I mean, that speaks for itself.

1647
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:44,000
In the end, Yuli's gold was the globe.

1648
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:45,000
Mm hmm.

1649
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:49,000
Yuli Jackson, a beekeeper.

1650
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:58,000
Well, I mean, my my experience is skipping road trip.

1651
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:00,000
No, I watched road trip.

1652
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:03,000
Why skip the stage fright?

1653
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:04,000
Skip stage fright.

1654
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:13,000
And Scott, what if I were to tell you you missed another occurrence of the Dick Cheney's like, yes, Dick Cheney was in stage fright.

1655
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:19,000
And Saramadi talks about growing up in Africa, which is even weirder.

1656
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:20,000
He did not.

1657
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:22,000
He did not grow up there.

1658
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:23,000
No.

1659
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:24,000
Yeah.

1660
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:25,000
Saramadi.

1661
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:29,000
Well, I keep thinking it's like Scaramucci in my head.

1662
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:34,000
Sierra, the daughter there.

1663
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:35,000
They OK.

1664
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:36,000
So they're watching.

1665
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:40,000
There's a psych ag where the daughter and the son are watching The Lion King.

1666
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:45,000
And she has filled the son's cone with popcorn.

1667
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:46,000
How about that?

1668
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:49,000
And then he says, what's happening in the movie?

1669
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:52,000
And she says the line Simba was sad.

1670
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:56,000
And then Darth Vader said some made up Africa crap.

1671
02:04:56,000 --> 02:05:00,000
So that made it onto network television.

1672
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:01,000
That line.

1673
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:07,000
Father of the pride decided to be higher and mightier than the Lion King.

1674
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:12,000
Get Katzenberg got wind of the what do you mean?

1675
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:15,000
He was going to put a dream jerks in California adventure.

1676
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:17,000
That won't stand.

1677
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:20,000
Time to shit on my old work.

1678
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:25,000
This was the episode that we should have made the big pitch for Eisner to be on.

1679
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:29,000
Yeah, we're going to sink up and watch it with him.

1680
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:30,000
We screwed up.

1681
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:33,000
Eisner should have done all episodes with us.

1682
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:38,000
And he should have watched the Peter Fonda clip or listen to the Bob Dylan song.

1683
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:42,000
And then we should have all gone on here because he would have loved to give us some Katzenberg stuff.

1684
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:44,000
Oh, yeah, that'd be great.

1685
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:46,000
I mean, we should pitch him like Mike.

1686
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:49,000
We're going to call it settling scores with Michael Eisner.

1687
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:50,000
Huh?

1688
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:54,000
He has no venue to do that other than our show.

1689
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:55,000
Yeah.

1690
02:05:57,000 --> 02:06:02,000
Yeah, I mean, we'll create a stern like environment where he feels comfortable, you know,

1691
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:04,000
revisiting old feuds.

1692
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:16,000
I also feel very rewarded because like you, Mike, I got to, you know,

1693
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:22,000
sit and hear wisdom from one of the great artists of the 20th century and beyond.

1694
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:29,000
And the song Murder Most Foul Bob Dylan not only relives the JFK assassination,

1695
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:36,000
but also much of the pop culture that shaped him, that shaped America in the 60s and 70s

1696
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:46,000
and via a series of endless couplets for 17 straight minutes over a drone of piano and cello.

1697
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:56,000
We go back, we time travel with Bob and we hear lines like November 12th, 1963,

1698
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:59,000
a day that will live in infamy.

1699
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:09,000
That does sound like Bob Dylan, but it also sounds like Kenan's Pierre Escargot character.

1700
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:15,000
They blew off his head while he was still in the car.

1701
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:21,000
I thought it was sort of Sandler-esque a little bit too.

1702
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:22,000
Oh, yeah, that too.

1703
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:23,000
Oh, yeah, that's a sub.

1704
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:26,000
I do JFK shoot a room.

1705
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:38,000
The one that I made it through the song without stopping until I needed a breather when he I got to the line

1706
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:41,000
the day they blew out the brains of the king.

1707
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:45,000
What are they talking about?

1708
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:46,000
What's that?

1709
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:48,000
What they blew up the brains of the king.

1710
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:49,000
They're talking about who?

1711
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:50,000
The JFK.

1712
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:51,000
Kennedy?

1713
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:54,000
The best guy.

1714
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:56,000
And how long is this song again?

1715
02:07:56,000 --> 02:08:02,000
17 minutes and it's lyrics nonstop and it's all like that.

1716
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:05,000
It's very Dr. Seuss.

1717
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:19,000
Which I felt inspired to relive my own history in the same format.

1718
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:21,000
And I decided to try my hand.

1719
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:26,000
You know, I'm no Dylan, but you know, there's a little poet in all of us.

1720
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:35,000
And I decided to see if I could write some murder most foul type lines about what I've experienced today, which father of the pride.

1721
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:36,000
Father of the bride.

1722
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:38,000
Oh, I love it.

1723
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:46,000
Which with this experience today, watching this entire series felt as long as living through the 1960s.

1724
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:51,000
So with that, let me see if I can convey the experience here.

1725
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:53,000
Yeah.

1726
02:08:53,000 --> 02:08:58,000
See Sigfried and Roy, the magicians are rich.

1727
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:10,000
Some old here likes to say crappy and bitch lesbian gophers stronger and shimmy Larry likes to wear a wig like Jimmy.

1728
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:16,000
Wig like Jimmy play smash mouth for donkey from Shrek.

1729
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:21,000
Cheryl Hines cashes a paycheck.

1730
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:24,000
Smoking cat nip make the lions all growl.

1731
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:30,000
Father of the pride is a serious most foul.

1732
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:31,000
You have it.

1733
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:34,000
I mean, I think that was all worth it.

1734
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:38,000
And hey, Jimmy and Chaga definitely trust McNeil voices.

1735
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:39,000
That's confirmed.

1736
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:40,000
I think so.

1737
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:41,000
Yeah.

1738
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:42,000
And they made out.

1739
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:44,000
That was a lot of fun.

1740
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:45,000
Yeah.

1741
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:47,000
So there you have it.

1742
02:09:47,000 --> 02:10:03,000
I mean, this also it as we record this much 29, 2020, a day that will live in it for me as the worst thing I guess I ever did to ourselves or to the audience.

1743
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:08,000
I think I was in a fuzz bucket, tested my will, tested my relationship.

1744
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:11,000
You know, it's not like you had a great time.

1745
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:14,000
Yeah, you got high on catnip with your girl.

1746
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:18,000
I think I came around with the catnip at the end.

1747
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:22,000
I wish you like the lions could have eaten it from sausages.

1748
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:23,000
I will.

1749
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:25,000
That's you know, that is a good idea.

1750
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:28,000
I should run my once a week trip to the store.

1751
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:31,000
I should pick up some sausages because I don't know what I have.

1752
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:33,000
Once a once a week, you're daring.

1753
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:35,000
You're real daredevil.

1754
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:36,000
Yeah, really.

1755
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:37,000
What do you mean?

1756
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:38,000
No, that's what they're saying.

1757
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:39,000
You're supposed to do.

1758
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:40,000
Oh, that's what they're saying.

1759
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:41,000
Yes.

1760
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:43,000
I'm trying to I'm trying to do it, you know, two or more.

1761
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:46,000
I'm afraid to go outside anyway.

1762
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:48,000
I admire your bravery.

1763
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:50,000
Oh, I've been walking every day.

1764
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:51,000
I haven't done that.

1765
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:52,000
I've been.

1766
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:55,000
I took a walk after all this after Father of the Pride.

1767
02:10:55,000 --> 02:10:58,000
That felt good for getting the getting kissed from the sun.

1768
02:10:58,000 --> 02:10:59,000
I've never tried.

1769
02:10:59,000 --> 02:11:03,000
I don't really think I have the the, you know, grinder type utilities

1770
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:06,000
and the casings probably gross.

1771
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:11,000
Well, I have a suggestion for what to grind up and stick in a sausage.

1772
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:12,000
The DVD.

1773
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:15,000
This four-dollar DVD.

1774
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:18,000
You know, maybe for Twitch, I'll watch the automatic.

1775
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:21,000
I'll watch the automatic and I'll watch the DVD.

1776
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:22,000
I'll watch the DVD.

1777
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:23,000
I'll watch the DVD.

1778
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:24,000
I'll watch the DVD.

1779
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:25,000
I'll watch the DVD.

1780
02:11:25,000 --> 02:11:26,000
I'll watch the DVD.

1781
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:31,000
I'll watch the automatic and the original pilot and do commentary on that.

1782
02:11:31,000 --> 02:11:33,000
Not for this.

1783
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:34,000
I'll wait.

1784
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:38,000
I'll wait for the episode to drop and then I'll be like, folks, I got to close the loop.

1785
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:39,000
I got to close the circle.

1786
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:44,000
It's going to drive the OCD part of my brain nuts if I don't finish this DVD.

1787
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:53,000
I was going to say we give this away at a live show, but I'm afraid to put my signature on this item.

1788
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:56,000
Well, that's yeah, that's OK.

1789
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:57,000
We don't have to sign it.

1790
02:11:57,000 --> 02:12:02,000
You just mean you don't want and you don't want it to be in someone's home because of you.

1791
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:09,000
I mean that and also just having our names like even just written on it and marker.

1792
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:11,000
Why are we signing it though?

1793
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:13,000
Why are we so we don't have to sign it?

1794
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:16,000
People might ask, you know, someone might add something else.

1795
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:18,000
Yeah, we should probably sign something else.

1796
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:20,000
It's a presumptuous autograph, I feel.

1797
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:22,000
OK, fair enough.

1798
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:26,000
In your scenario, people are like, I demand the three of you sign this.

1799
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:27,000
I would.

1800
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:28,000
I would.

1801
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:31,000
If there's like a funny giveaway, be like, hey, would you sign it?

1802
02:12:31,000 --> 02:12:33,000
I think that'd be fun.

1803
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:40,000
If I ever saw if I had the copy with me in my car and I ran into Cheryl Hines or Orlando Jones,

1804
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:42,000
maybe I'd have them try to sign it.

1805
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:47,000
But then I think they might like throw smack it out of my hand onto the ground.

1806
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:52,000
We'll have the wait for the DVD to break and then press it against my neck and threaten me

1807
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:54,000
or just go, what are you talking about?

1808
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:56,000
I wasn't in that.

1809
02:12:56,000 --> 02:13:01,000
That's a solid move, I think, on the part of anyone involved in this show.

1810
02:13:01,000 --> 02:13:03,000
Let's get out of here.

1811
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:05,000
Let's let's let's end this.

1812
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:08,000
You know what I think is funny just as a closing thought?

1813
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:12,000
You know, a lot of the throughout the downtown Disney ordeal, I was trying to reduce things,

1814
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:14,000
get out of things, avoid doing things.

1815
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:19,000
I like how we came up with an escape patch for us to miss some of this and everyone agreed it was fine.

1816
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:20,000
Oh, yeah.

1817
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:22,000
There's no argument.

1818
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:27,000
I was thinking, though, that and we're still in the middle of a quarantine situation here.

1819
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:33,000
I was thinking if after the first few, if we had said like, hey, instead of doing this,

1820
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:39,000
let's throw it out the window and I'll drive down and just review the exteriors of the businesses on Harbor Boulevard.

1821
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:42,000
I would have 100 percent said, you know what?

1822
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:44,000
Let's do that. Let's go do that instead.

1823
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:45,000
Yeah.

1824
02:13:45,000 --> 02:13:51,000
This. Yeah, I think we all we all saw the writing on the wall very quickly, very quickly.

1825
02:13:51,000 --> 02:14:00,000
And no, no, even amount of funny bit, no even amount of funny bits were going to like make us stick to some sort of some sort of structure to this.

1826
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:03,000
I guess Jason insisted on watching all of it.

1827
02:14:03,000 --> 02:14:06,000
And it turns out that the show is going to be a lot of fun.

1828
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:08,000
Jason insisted on watching all of it.

1829
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:11,000
And it turns out he's just one of the biggest fans of the show.

1830
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:18,000
I mean, I, you know, at this point, I would love to ask.

1831
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:21,000
Yeah, I would love to hear from people involved in the show.

1832
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:25,000
I would love to hear more stories because I'm so curious.

1833
02:14:25,000 --> 02:14:35,000
I mean, if it's early 2000 Dreamworks coming off of Shrek's like massive success and it's got a huge budget.

1834
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:39,000
How could you how do you say no? How do you say no?

1835
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:47,000
How? I don't know. I I I would never say no to Mr. Katzenberg to Mr. Zigg to Mr. Roy or Mr. Ziegfried.

1836
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:58,000
I would never. But then another question is how do you see a script that on every page contains a gay joke that is gone?

1837
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:03,000
There's such a circuitous lengthy path to get to it.

1838
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:11,000
How do you not take a really thick sharpie and exit out as many times as possible?

1839
02:15:11,000 --> 02:15:16,000
Hmm. Yeah, that is also very fair. That's a great question as well.

1840
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:19,000
Who is the script editor on this show? Sarmody?

1841
02:15:19,000 --> 02:15:25,000
Could you imagine if you had to work for Sarmody?

1842
02:15:25,000 --> 02:15:28,000
Oh, man, that would probably lead to some some tales.

1843
02:15:29,000 --> 02:15:31,000
Get out of my office, you dumb bitch.

1844
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:38,000
Never refers to being a lion.

1845
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:41,000
There's so little of the show is about being a lion.

1846
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:44,000
If it had been about lion stuff, I would have loved it.

1847
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:47,000
But it's like my boss is coming over.

1848
02:15:47,000 --> 02:15:50,000
My mother's an election to my kid's school.

1849
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:56,000
The night like it's sparingly occasionally accidentally about being a lion.

1850
02:15:56,000 --> 02:16:03,000
Yeah, barely about magic shows like hardly any magic.

1851
02:16:05,000 --> 02:16:10,000
Yes, but the mind is not the magic when it comes to the show.

1852
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:12,000
Look, here's what's going to happen.

1853
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:15,000
I mean, we've all been through a real psychological journey today,

1854
02:16:15,000 --> 02:16:19,000
and we're going to have to sit and recover from this,

1855
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:25,000
just like you, Lee Jackson recovers from a knife wound at the end of the show.

1856
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:28,000
At the end of the film, Uly's gold.

1857
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:35,000
But will be the more enriched for it will grow and will be better people.

1858
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:36,000
That's right.

1859
02:16:37,000 --> 02:16:39,000
Uly Jackson.

1860
02:16:39,000 --> 02:16:41,000
That's us.

1861
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:45,000
And what you're listening to right now is you is Uly's gold.

1862
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:50,000
Uly's gold, the gold of the three Uly's is what you just heard.

1863
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:54,000
No longer the good boys were referred to as the three Uly's.

1864
02:16:56,000 --> 02:17:02,000
And you just endured the three Uly's, the new our new catchphrase,

1865
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:08,000
as that is what we are three solitary in hiding beekeepers.

1866
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:15,000
Making trying to make honey or harvest honey from terrible television shows.

1867
02:17:15,000 --> 02:17:18,000
And I hope you enjoyed that honey today.

1868
02:17:19,000 --> 02:17:23,000
Dear fucking Lord, let's never do anything like this again.

1869
02:17:23,000 --> 02:17:25,000
My least favorite episode.

1870
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:27,000
It's nice to have a definitive.

1871
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:30,000
I think for sure I would say 100 percent.

1872
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:32,000
This is the first episode we've ever done.

1873
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:39,000
If you would like to watch Father of the Pride, retrain your brain to do anything else.

1874
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:43,000
What's the order? What's the correct order?

1875
02:17:43,000 --> 02:17:47,000
And I think the order is none.

1876
02:17:47,000 --> 02:17:50,000
The order is if you happen upon it,

1877
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:55,000
maybe the order is go to YouTube, look up the episodes on the channel TopTunes,

1878
02:17:55,000 --> 02:18:00,000
report the top tunes to YouTube for crimes against humanity.

1879
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:02,000
We'll get all these episodes removed.

1880
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:06,000
Copyright strike. Take down notice.

1881
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:12,000
I don't like to be a narc on copyright issues, but in this case, yes,

1882
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:15,000
something must be done. The government must be alerted.

1883
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:20,000
Yes, everything I think everything you can get out of this show.

1884
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:25,000
There's one JPEG of like donkey standing next to Larry the lion.

1885
02:18:25,000 --> 02:18:28,000
That's what you need. You just need that JPEG.

1886
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:35,000
You just. Well, I have I have one picture of Kelsey Grammer that I captured on my phone.

1887
02:18:35,000 --> 02:18:38,000
I mean, that's good. Yeah. I mean, that's that's all right, too.

1888
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:41,000
You'd like that to become a meme.

1889
02:18:41,000 --> 02:18:44,000
Well, definitely. We'll be posting that for sure.

1890
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:47,000
Yes, we need to popularize bizarre, stiff CGI.

1891
02:18:47,000 --> 02:18:50,000
Kelsey Grammer, the guy, Kelsey Grammer.

1892
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:55,000
And of course, Martin, you know, he's got those big eyebrows, a precursor to shark tail

1893
02:18:55,000 --> 02:19:01,000
precursor to Martin Scorsese showing up at Shark Tale where they got the real guy

1894
02:19:01,000 --> 02:19:03,000
and where they got the real guy. More money.

1895
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:05,000
You know, let's never let's not watch that.

1896
02:19:05,000 --> 02:19:07,000
Let's not watch anything. Let's take a break.

1897
02:19:07,000 --> 02:19:09,000
Let's not record one for like a month and a half.

1898
02:19:09,000 --> 02:19:11,000
Yeah, I don't really.

1899
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:13,000
I prefer to not to

1900
02:19:15,000 --> 02:19:16,000
restore Kelsey.

1901
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:19,000
I sent you the photo of Kelsey Grammer on your phones.

1902
02:19:19,000 --> 02:19:21,000
And that's the last we ever hear from Mike.

1903
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:25,000
That's the last it's a screen grab a Kelsey Grammer.

1904
02:19:25,000 --> 02:19:31,000
And then last night when he texted us the Disney Plus page for returned Oz, an upsetting image.

1905
02:19:31,000 --> 02:19:34,000
This is a terror. I'm deleting this thread.

1906
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:35,000
This is the end.

1907
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:38,000
Return to Oz compared to the return.

1908
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:40,000
Return to Oz is a masterpiece compared to this.

1909
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:42,000
I don't. I don't doubt that.

1910
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:43,000
I certainly don't doubt that.

1911
02:19:43,000 --> 02:19:48,000
And every other episode of podcast the ride is a masterpiece compared to this.

1912
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:49,000
Listen to the rest.

1915
02:19:59,000 --> 02:20:00,000
Let's get out of here.

1916
02:20:01,000 --> 02:20:02,000
All right. All right.

1917
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:03,000
All right. Good riddance.
