1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:25,720
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, The Second Gate, where if you like speculation with a side of

3
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:30,880
Florida transportation infrastructure talk, this is the episode for you.

4
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:38,960
Folks, as we record this mere hours ago, Universal announced Universal's Epic Universe.

5
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,960
I'm Jason Sheridan here with Mike Carlson.

6
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:42,960
Yeah, I'm here.

7
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:43,960
And Scott Gerrider.

8
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:44,960
An epic day.

9
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:45,960
We can feel it.

10
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:46,960
An epic day.

11
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,760
I think we're all exhausted from all of the epicness, but we're forcing ourselves to stay

12
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,800
up and process all of this.

13
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,760
You joke, but I have been up since 730 AM reading live tweets and drinking coffee.

14
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:06,200
The dog woke me up at 7 AM, which he's been doing lately, and I saw you just texting furiously.

15
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:10,840
And then I was a little underwhelmed by the announcements and I went back to bed sort

16
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:14,520
of like disappointed, but you seemed like you were riled and ready to go.

17
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,520
I was ready to go.

18
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,520
You seemed very genuinely psyched.

19
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:18,520
I mean, I'm excited about it.

20
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,360
I'm not saying I'm not excited.

21
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:25,000
I think also this is the 20 years we just passed the 20 year anniversary of Islands

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,360
of Adventure, the last park built in Orlando.

23
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,680
And this is the first major park built since then.

24
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,160
New theme park with Disney or Universal.

25
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,160
Or Universal.

26
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,160
Yeah.

27
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,160
Except the theme water park, Volcano Bay.

28
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:41,160
But for the sake of today, we will not.

29
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,160
It's going to grind my ears.

30
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,160
I know.

31
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:48,440
There's blood coming out of your ear.

32
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:55,120
Can we get a quick comic con recap from you?

33
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,120
Oh, OK.

34
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,120
You want to do?

35
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,120
I wasn't sure if this was the chaser.

36
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,120
That's where this is an epic episode.

37
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:04,120
There's a little bit of an anecdote I wanted the listeners to hear.

38
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,400
And this let's let's just do it real quick here.

39
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,360
I think we're not too far out from Comic Con.

40
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,840
You guys went to go.

41
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,840
Yeah.

42
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,440
A story has been saved for me to hear.

43
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,440
Yeah.

44
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,320
So here's the set up.

45
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,640
I go down to Comic Con every year.

46
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,320
Jason usually goes for a couple of days.

47
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:27,760
I stay at Lindsay's mom's place to save a little money.

48
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,520
It's only like 10 minute lift from the convention center.

49
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,800
So I was trying to get Jason to go down.

50
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,200
I'm like, I'm sure you can find an Airbnb that'll be good.

51
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,440
And I send him some links.

52
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,280
He's looking up stuff himself.

53
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,040
And we actually I'm checking a lot.

54
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:43,320
And finally you land on a place that looks pretty good.

55
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,320
Price is good.

56
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:47,880
Looks like it's a nice location and like a nice, you know, look.

57
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,880
It's a scenic.

58
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:49,880
It's nice.

59
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:50,880
Yeah.

60
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:54,640
Tenth floor of a high rise looking down like first J Street.

61
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,640
Right.

62
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,640
Beautiful view.

63
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,640
That was the second one I booked.

64
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,640
Yes, that's right.

65
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,920
I was condensing.

66
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,920
And you found a nicer looking one.

67
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:02,920
Yeah.

68
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,920
So I switched.

69
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:04,920
I switched to that one.

70
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:08,600
Also, Mike now living his dream, booking fun experiences for other people.

71
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,520
Yeah, which I do do fairly often.

72
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:15,880
If you give me the rope, I will.

73
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,960
I will lasso a hotel for you or an Airbnb.

74
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,960
You were helpful.

75
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:25,440
And in the long run, this part of this worked out in that like it seemed like there was

76
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,640
like two or three people I could have potentially shared this room with.

77
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,640
Yeah.

78
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,200
And that didn't end up happening, which thank God.

79
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,200
Yeah.

80
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,560
So so this is what this is the important part to the setup.

81
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,120
So you said to me, you said, you know what?

82
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,840
I'm just going to do it myself.

83
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,120
I'm not going to stay with anyone.

84
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:46,960
I'm going to have a nice night in this nice Airbnb stretch out.

85
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:47,960
Was there a pool?

86
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,960
There was a pool.

87
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:49,960
There was a pool.

88
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,960
You're like, I'm going to go to the pool.

89
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:54,800
I'm just going to have a nice, you know, 48 hours in San Diego with the convention.

90
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,640
This is going to be a time when I get to treat myself.

91
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:01,000
This is going to be a really nice 48 hour little mini trip for myself.

92
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,640
So you were very excited about it.

93
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,880
It sounds like the first act of a sitcom.

94
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,480
It certainly anyone else saying any of this.

95
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,840
Maybe you can trust it would go OK.

96
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,960
But it's a hapless character.

97
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:22,400
So I it was on Saturday and I had just found my way into Hall H.

98
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:29,640
And I well, is this when I started texting about what was going down?

99
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:32,240
So because for me, it started a little earlier.

100
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,520
You'll be able to tell that part of it.

101
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:41,520
I receive a text in the middle of Hall H from our friend, Anthony Geo, friend of the show.

102
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:42,600
My savior.

103
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,440
It is so it is such a great text.

104
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,160
And it's not great for you, but it's such a ridiculous text.

105
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:51,280
And now I will let you take it from here.

106
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:54,040
OK, unless you want me to say no, no, work backwards.

107
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,240
We'll catch up to the text.

108
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:57,960
Got it. Got it.

109
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,280
If you want to.

110
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,520
I'm going to find the text.

111
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:04,400
So my trouble began when we all went to lunch.

112
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,840
We went to this Greek place.

113
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:13,880
And I started the host, the Airbnb host starts calling me.

114
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:21,160
And he goes, hey, man, wanted to check in, wanted to see when we could meet up

115
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,200
so I could give you the keys.

116
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:28,400
And I was like, that's not great, because the listing said pick up at concierge,

117
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,880
pick up at front desk.

118
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:32,120
I was like, oh, this is an apartment building with a front desk.

119
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:35,360
So and he's like, yeah, I just checked.

120
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,280
I can't do that.

121
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,320
Sorry, it's my first weekend hosting.

122
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:44,160
So a couple of flags never asked.

123
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,280
Oh, my God. Never asked.

124
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,840
But it felt OK putting it on his list.

125
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,120
So I was like, OK.

126
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,560
And he's like, can you meet up?

127
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,120
Do you want to hop in a quick lift?

128
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:54,960
Come over and get them.

129
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:59,080
And I'm like, I don't want to hop in a quick lift and come over and get them at all.

130
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:04,960
Because I was like going to scarf food down and run back to go to an X-Men panel

131
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:11,920
at the Convention Center, which also all weekend, any panel I tried to go to,

132
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,440
I did not get to.

133
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,760
I did not either get in or I just fucked up the timing.

134
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,880
It did not make it to.

135
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:22,080
So eventually we set a time to meet up to exchange the keys.

136
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,440
He pushes his back 15 minutes.

137
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,280
I then I get there right at like 345 or whatever.

138
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,880
I'm standing on a street corner.

139
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,400
Five minutes past, 10 minutes past, 15 minutes past.

140
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,520
And finally, I'm like texting.

141
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,680
Hey, man, where are you?

142
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:42,920
About 10 minutes later, he finally calls and he's like, OK, I'm coming up.

143
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,320
Man, a lot of traffic today.

144
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,400
It's like, yeah, it's comic.

145
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,240
Anything going on in town?

146
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,120
Anything going on?

147
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,000
Text, I have the text.

148
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,720
Yes. And so I I had found a street corner.

149
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:57,920
I actively found a street corner that was not blocked off from traffic.

150
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:02,480
So eventually he pulls up and he gives me the keys.

151
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,640
And I'm like, OK, great.

152
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:07,120
So just leave them on the kitchen table when I like check out or leave them on,

153
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,320
you know, a hook or something.

154
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:12,080
He's like, oh, no, they're my only set of keys.

155
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,760
Can you just leave them under the mat when you check out?

156
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,600
I'm like, yes, sure, man.

157
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,040
I'll leave them under the. OK.

158
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,480
And at this point, he's like, all right, I'm out.

159
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,160
See you. Have a good time.

160
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,640
And so I'm like, well, at this point, I'm like three blocks from the place.

161
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,040
So I don't just go put my bag down and check it out.

162
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:34,160
So I walk over and I go up to it and it's very nice and very clean.

163
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:38,480
The sun is setting and I go to just

164
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:43,120
just as a habit in the last five, ten years,

165
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,440
I've gotten to when I go to stay at a hotel or a rental place.

166
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,720
I check the sheets for bed bugs.

167
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:52,160
Can I read the text now?

168
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:56,120
So yes. So this is when my troubles really began.

169
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,640
So here's the text.

170
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,920
A little update from.

171
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:02,000
So this is Anthony texting me a little update from the convention floor.

172
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,840
Jason will be staying with me because this Airbnb bed was wet.

173
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,720
So I. Oh, I.

174
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:15,920
I pulled the sheets back on the bed and I am like, these are damp

175
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:20,920
and it is not cold because the windows are all open.

176
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,760
He did not leave the air.

177
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,960
Are they let the windows up?

178
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,640
I think just to get some fresh air in there.

179
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,520
Like this is wet.

180
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,920
And I'm like, how wet is it?

181
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,200
And then I touch the comfort.

182
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:33,320
I'm like, oh, the comforter is more wet.

183
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,920
The comforter is the source of the wetness.

184
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:41,480
This is the fire festival scenario, despite there not having been a flood.

185
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:47,120
Or I'm sorry. I would like a, you know, a storm that rained down on a

186
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:50,480
very thin tent. How did this happen in a?

187
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,600
How did this or apartment complex?

188
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,280
So I pull I was like, well, maybe I'm OK.

189
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,600
Let me see how wet.

190
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,480
So I check all the quarters and they are all wet.

191
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:05,400
And so I text, hey, man, just got to the apartment.

192
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,880
The bedding is wet.

193
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,600
And then the guy promptly calls.

194
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,440
He's like, I'm so sorry.

195
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,080
The person who stayed last night checked out late, which may push the cleaning

196
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:20,080
lady back. And like I was racing to pull the bedding out of the,

197
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:25,000
you know, the comforter out of the dryer so I could put it on the bed.

198
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,720
And I guess I didn't check.

199
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:31,240
I didn't notice. And I'm like, I don't know if you would not be able to check.

200
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,680
Yeah. And so I'm like, all right.

201
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:37,640
Well, that's you know, if it's in your hands, you know, if it is wet or dry.

202
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:41,880
That's true. So I'm going to say Airbnb hosting tip by two shed

203
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:47,920
sets of bedding by two, just maybe ask your building if you can do this.

204
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,880
And do that. Yes. And I had to give it.

205
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,120
He was very polite. He was very nice.

206
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,240
And that's you for keeping it. Hey, man.

207
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,120
You kept it. I kept it.

208
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:59,240
Cash, you know, therapy and meditation.

209
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,320
And also I had a look.

210
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,760
I was just low key stoned all weekend.

211
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,280
And so I was pretty chill.

212
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,880
And I'm like, I don't want to yell at this guy

213
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,400
because he's very tall and I think could easily kick my ass.

214
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,560
Throw you just throw me

215
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,880
into a muscly, sleeved, tattoo sleeved arms.

216
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,520
I'll make you wet.

217
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:26,400
And he was like, I'm so sorry.

218
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:30,120
But then and thankfully, this only went on for like a minute.

219
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,560
He was like, you know what?

220
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,440
I'm really sorry. I'll give you 20 bucks back.

221
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,400
And I'm like, no.

222
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,080
He went, OK, OK, 50.

223
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:42,320
And I was like, I'm not not really cool with that.

224
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,560
I don't want to sleep on the couch.

225
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,520
He's like, no, no, I don't want you to sleep on the couch.

226
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:49,680
What if I came back and put the comforter in the dryer?

227
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,000
Or you could put it in the dry.

228
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,960
I'm like, I am on vacation.

229
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,400
I don't want to do launch.

230
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,720
So what if you slept on my warm back?

231
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,480
I'll cradle you to sleep.

232
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:03,360
And I had already before I called the guy, I called Anthony Gia,

233
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:07,960
who had offered he last minute got a hotel room that had a sofa bed in it.

234
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,240
He's like, if you want it, it's available.

235
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,400
And I was like, is that still available?

236
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,080
And he's like, yes.

237
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,760
And I'm like, OK, I'm going to play.

238
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,960
And I was like, hey, man, I think I just really want to refi.

239
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,760
I'm not going to stay here tonight.

240
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,320
I want to refund. I'll leave the key under the.

241
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,280
I'm not going to stay. I'm going to stay with a friend.

242
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:28,160
And after a split second of him going like, well, not a lot of places to stay.

243
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,880
You know, San Diego is pretty busy right now.

244
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,640
And I'm like, you miss you did not hear.

245
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,560
I got a place to I'm good.

246
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:36,320
So just he and he's like, OK, all right, no problem.

247
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,560
I'll call you. Airbnb.

248
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:40,480
And to his credit, he did promptly call Airbnb and said

249
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:44,120
they would give a refund and they called me like 10, 15 minutes later.

250
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,760
And they call you the next day as well.

251
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,680
They called me the next day just to make sure, you know,

252
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,000
if I had any other questions.

253
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,200
They knew you were like a travel influencer, probably.

254
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,400
Sure. You would be talking about this experience.

255
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,680
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

256
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,000
They're going to lose points.

257
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,160
So bad review on that second gate.

258
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,680
The good karma, the Spring Hill suites.

259
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,400
Wonderful buffet breakfast.

260
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,280
Great customer service.

261
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:10,360
That's where I stay at the Spring Hill suites.

262
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,920
If I do an overnight at Disneyland, if I if I want to, you know,

263
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,360
be able to be able to very sleek.

264
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:20,120
Yeah. Very modern fan of the brand from my one experience.

265
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,040
Yeah. Yeah.

266
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:26,520
There's a they have a Anaheim one as a social hour, they call it.

267
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,120
There's a big pile of hamburgers.

268
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,640
None of it's it's he all seems inedible, but I like the idea of it.

269
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:37,040
So this had a sunset toast and also a beautiful terrace

270
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,480
that overlook the one the

271
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,280
God, I forget what it's called.

272
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:45,080
I don't know if it's the harbor at that point, but we were looking down

273
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,440
at an aircraft carrier.

274
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,240
OK, and it was really beautiful.

275
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,600
And they're like sunset toast.

276
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,440
And I was like, I was like, well, I have to kill time for the train.

277
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,560
The next day back, I'll just hang out here for the sunset toast.

278
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,640
And I was like, I'd like the sunset toast, please.

279
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:01,080
And they're like, well, it's brought to you by Cut Water Spirits,

280
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,400
which is the canned cocktails that are so popular.

281
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,720
And they poured me two sips of a whiskey lemonade.

282
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,920
And that was it.

283
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,000
And I was like, oh, right.

284
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,960
OK, so enough in the glass to make a toast.

285
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:18,840
So whiskey of pre combined whiskey, pre combined whiskey.

286
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:22,760
Other than that, that was but it was the funniest note to to end on.

287
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:26,120
I mean, better than what you had better than what I had in the spring.

288
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,520
Sweets, the most important thing, they give you the option of

289
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:32,240
do you want a dry or a wet comforter?

290
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:37,880
They ask you when you check in, would you like it damp or soaked?

291
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,760
There's a gray area in between.

292
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,880
How wet you want it?

293
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:45,400
Jason, depending on his mood, does sometimes want a very wet bed.

294
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,600
But he just wasn't feeling it that weekend.

295
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,280
I wasn't feeling it.

296
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:53,440
Some days he likes it sloshing around in a hotel bed or an Airbnb bed.

297
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,400
But not this weekend.

298
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,480
This was a relaxing.

299
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,160
We get humid real quickly.

300
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,680
Yeah. So anyway, like a frog on a lily pad.

301
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,000
Yeah. Splashing around the swamp.

302
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,640
So anyway, that's the continuing saga of Jason vacationing.

303
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,320
You get another wrinkle.

304
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:12,520
Yeah, but we took the the surf liner back like in business class

305
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,800
and they give you a snack box, a little bottle of wine.

306
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17,160
Very nice. Very nice. Yeah.

307
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,560
Yeah. All right.

308
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,560
So epic. That was epic.

309
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,120
Yeah, that was epic.

310
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:25,920
Step one of a very epic episode.

311
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:31,320
Yeah. And it's an episode of surprises for me because you guys saved that info.

312
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,960
Yeah. Thank you for telling it to me.

313
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:39,320
And then this epic universe announcement, the info about the

314
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:45,240
fourth gate at Universal Studios.

315
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,560
We we can call apart.

316
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,800
We can just call it the new part.

317
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:53,040
You don't have to worry about the to leave numbers out of it.

318
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,720
If we could.

319
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,080
Maybe I don't like to play these companies games.

320
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,360
Maybe that's what's going on.

321
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,880
But anyway, you know, this announcement was made this morning.

322
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,520
Unlike you, I was not up at six a.m.

323
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:08,560
I wanted to discover all of this information live on the air.

324
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:12,560
I wanted you to feel the emotion as I saw epic universe for the first time.

325
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:15,880
Slash, I did not have time to look at it earlier.

326
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,240
That's so that's fair.

327
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,520
So you're going to get three like

328
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:25,480
real world job stuff, things go hitting you at once as I'm sitting there going,

329
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,720
oh, interesting, that's a lot of parking spots.

330
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:33,280
I had a scenario in which a

331
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:38,920
I was on the I was on a phone call with like a like an agency

332
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:44,000
in another country while a right at the moment that a

333
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:51,360
1800s era costume with big like man capes was being delivered to my door.

334
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:55,080
These these are two types of things that don't happen to me every day.

335
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:58,480
So why would they both happen within the same 15 minutes?

336
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,240
Another epic epic.

337
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,040
Oh, fuck me.

338
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,440
I don't know. Epic happening.

339
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,720
Now you're thinking about having to call it the fourth gate.

340
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,960
Yeah, that too.

341
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,920
Make this running gag run.

342
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:13,440
I put the picture behind you in a funny way.

343
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,240
Oh, oh, boy.

344
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,400
I have the whole problem.

345
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,200
I had you. Well, I got to spin around.

346
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,920
This is the concept art.

347
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,240
OK, here we go. Take a look.

348
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,840
I'm going to veer from my usual podcast.

349
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,360
This is called Epic.

350
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,200
What is it called?

351
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,000
Universal's epic universe.

352
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,600
A lot of universe.

353
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,480
And it is OK.

354
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,480
Now it's not the Disney California venture.

355
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,440
They are still using the apostrophe and the S.

356
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,080
Is that right? Universal's universal.

357
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,160
You know, this is very important.

358
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,640
It's very important to have this out because we don't know anything else

359
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,160
because they didn't announce the IP.

360
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,320
And I like how you're holding the mic stand like a stick.

361
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,640
Steven Tyler holds.

362
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

363
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,720
I'm rocking out. I got aero Smith.

364
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,520
I got energy.

365
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:54,480
So now for briefly speculated, leaked last year.

366
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:57,360
Fantastic World seemed like there was some trademark

367
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,400
funny business with Warner Brothers, who they need to keep on good terms

368
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,360
with because they have the Harry Potter stuff.

369
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,440
Yeah. So this is so the way.

370
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:08,200
Yeah, the name for for a long time rumored was Fantastic Worlds.

371
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:12,160
Now you think or have you read that that was a Warner Brothers problem or

372
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,760
I believe supposedly there was a trademark dispute, but they did

373
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:22,440
register both Fantastic Worlds and Epic Universe around right off the bat.

374
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:26,520
I will say Fantastic World's better name than Epic Universe.

375
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:32,520
Better name epic sort of ties it to right now or maybe to like seven years ago.

376
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,760
When did people start calling things seven years ago?

377
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:37,120
I think is right. So, yeah, that feels a little bit more.

378
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,600
Ties it to 20 or 20 surfers.

379
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:43,760
Yes. I mean, they're friggin epic.

380
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:48,200
I would I would think with the vibe of this,

381
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:52,600
they would be reaching for the traditional version of the word epic.

382
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,720
Grant, you know, grand in scope.

383
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,120
Sure. I would think so, too.

384
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:59,760
It's a word that hasn't been used in a theme park title before.

385
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,360
I'll give you that. Yeah.

386
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,760
They didn't go with the third choice.

387
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,880
Awesome Acres.

388
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:11,480
Awesome Acres sounds good.

389
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:14,520
I should say what I'm looking at here.

390
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:17,640
I just said wow, as if it was interesting to say, wow, OK.

391
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:20,080
So it's in processing this for the first time.

392
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:24,400
I mean, it's very yellow and very green.

393
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,160
I think it feels very city of Oz to me.

394
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:34,200
It feels like does it remind you of something else in the theme parks here recently?

395
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,640
Because it reminded me of something.

396
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,400
Really? I'm not sure what you're getting at.

397
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:46,680
Well, in the dead center is an extremely discovery mountain looking building.

398
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:50,760
It looks like it's like a dome ish structure that is very space

399
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:54,000
mountainy with a glow coming out of it, but a little more ornate.

400
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,120
And I don't know what I'm looking at there.

401
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:56,840
Well, we don't.

402
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:02,160
My thing was that it looks not dissimilar to the Epcot

403
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:07,600
redo. Yeah, the Epcot redo concept art that's already they've already moved past

404
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:11,600
just for the abundance of greens and black and purple.

405
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:15,520
Right. There's a lot of yeah, like plant life and trees.

406
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,640
So basically a lot of this stuff is kind of confirmed from rumor.

407
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,760
Basically, you'll be able to supposedly and Jason, correct me if I'm wrong.

408
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:28,480
And the park for free in the middle of the hub, we get to that hotel for free.

409
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,520
So basically, there's a new city walk.

410
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:33,120
What we're looking at in the middle is new city walk.

411
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,920
What the shops, I don't know if they're going to call it that.

412
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:36,640
They should.

413
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,120
But that's a new city walk.

414
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,520
So like that thing with the light shining out the top of it is maybe a restaurant

415
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,520
of some kind.

416
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,760
Wait, there's going to be.

417
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:45,680
Wait, I'm confused.

418
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,920
That entirely new shopping area.

419
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:51,480
Yes. And this is the whole park is about what, two miles away from the other two

420
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,840
parks. Sure.

421
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:55,040
Let me show off. So it's maps its own.

422
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,040
It is its own.

423
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,840
Twelve minutes away down I for.

424
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:01,720
And it's because this is the former site of Wet n Wild.

425
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,360
No water part. No, it's not.

426
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:07,720
This is this is actually maybe my favorite fact I learned today.

427
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:12,840
This is a site that Universal originally bought in 1998

428
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,360
to expand into.

429
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:21,640
Unfortunately, that site was previously owned by Lockheed Martin.

430
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:27,320
So after they cleaned up the landfills and toxic sludge left behind.

431
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:30,320
Whoa. They got to about the point of

432
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:35,920
2001 when the theme park industry took a very sharp dive in business

433
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:39,560
due to the September 11th attacks in 2003.

434
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,840
Vivendi Universal sold this plot of land.

435
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:49,120
And in the mid like around 2015, thereabouts, they started buying it back

436
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,640
piece by piece.

437
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,000
Would they sell it to?

438
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Do we know that?

439
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,400
Oh, I don't know. I don't know that.

440
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,960
That's a good question to find out.

441
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,200
So, yeah, this is where sludge used to be.

442
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,720
It was going to be low income housing.

443
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,240
And then they were like, yeah, let's get let's get that back.

444
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:07,400
This is what they're making. Yeah, let's make it a fancy park.

445
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:12,480
So, yeah. So there's a former sludge depot sludge deep formally the sludge depot.

446
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:18,800
So, yeah. So this is about the whole site is almost as big as the entire

447
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,120
Islands of Adventure, Universal and City Walk site.

448
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,160
Yes. That's right.

449
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,880
Yeah. Equals the two existing parks.

450
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,200
And you can see three.

451
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:33,560
And then, yes, so no tells.

452
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:38,480
Is there a that here are the numbers that I could find the number they threw out

453
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:42,360
today is that the whole site is seven hundred and fifty acres.

454
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:47,920
A previous public filing had a picture to to show five hundred and forty one

455
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,480
point five acres.

456
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:53,400
The park itself being one hundred thirty five acres.

457
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:57,000
To put that in perspective, Islands of Adventure, one hundred and ten acres.

458
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,760
Universal, Florida, one hundred twenty five acres.

459
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:04,200
Magic Kingdom, one forty two, Epcot, three hundred.

460
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,560
Hollywood Studios, one fifty four.

461
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,720
Animal Kingdom, five hundred acres.

462
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:14,760
And I'll say those are estimates because I was having a real tough time

463
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:17,160
finding numbers that everyone could agree on.

464
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:21,800
It seems like there's a lot of different numbers floating around out there.

465
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:26,880
I see. Yeah. This will the park itself will be bigger than the other two

466
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,920
universal parks.

467
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:33,160
A large portion of this land will be dedicated to five thousand and eighty

468
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:38,640
nine parking spaces, which is speculated to possibly be a surface lot.

469
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:41,640
That's the comparison. Now we're talking parking lots.

470
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:45,920
So you see how like that's the green is the universal existing property.

471
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:49,280
It looks like it's like Indiana or something.

472
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:53,960
And then Louisiana down on the bottom right is new epic universe.

473
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,400
And they're comparable in size.

474
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:02,160
Yes. I think it's pretty crazy to they ran out of room like they they did stuff.

475
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:05,240
How does it come? Do we know you didn't look this up if we had to guess

476
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:08,120
Tokyo Disney property? Oh, that's a good question.

477
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,800
Pretty sprawl. Oh, that's a good question.

478
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,840
Yeah. Those numbers are out there.

479
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:15,720
I just wrote down the Orlando once Disney sees one seventy six.

480
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:19,120
So this is and to use in one fifteen.

481
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,040
Yeah, this is massive. Right.

482
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:24,200
I mean, this this amount of size is epic. Yeah.

483
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:30,200
So now factoring in the epicness of it, though, you can see on the art.

484
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,920
And they haven't said anything.

485
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:36,240
We're going to get into what we think these these little lands are, because

486
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,840
they look exactly even deconstructed in a matter of hours.

487
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:44,680
Yeah, yeah. But there are like, as you can see, there are big plots

488
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:47,840
of undeveloped land spokes in the

489
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:53,040
various slots between the other lands.

490
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:57,040
So like there's still room for, you know, who knows, four different

491
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:00,000
I don't know how many tons of expansion, tons of expansion.

492
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,840
So as much as that site is very big, it's not going to be all developed

493
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,280
on right away, seemingly.

494
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:08,560
Universal's map where they showed like here's the current property

495
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:12,200
and here's where the expansion is going to be kind of conveniently

496
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,720
erases the rest of the world.

497
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:20,080
I pulled up with the map looks like with the rest of the world, including I for

498
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,640
if you can see.

499
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:25,200
So this little spot right here and we'll post all these pictures

500
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,320
on the Twitter account.

501
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:30,320
So this little red dot is where the property is over here.

502
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:33,520
This little red dot is the Orlando Convention Center.

503
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,680
So that's a huge convention center.

504
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,840
And right in the middle of the Kisiby St.

505
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,800
Clement, right in the middle.

506
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:43,760
Further up, you can see the giant Ferris wheel, the wheel at Icon Park,

507
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:46,920
kind of like the big one in Vegas or the London Eye.

508
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:52,960
Fun Spot America also on the way to the original universal.

509
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,560
So they've got to carry you over other theme park.

510
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,160
Yes.

511
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,920
Site properties. Yes.

512
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:06,320
And how do you get from this property to the original mainland universal park?

513
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:12,560
Well, I think the answer for now is probably going to be buses,

514
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,720
although on a few.

515
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,040
I'm disappointed by that answer.

516
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:20,320
Well, Jim Hill has been speculating that there are alternative

517
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:27,960
transportation methods being considered like what I some sort of large birds,

518
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:33,000
some sort of gondola system, or I don't think they can extend waterways.

519
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,720
Yeah. Fantastic.

520
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,640
Epic catapult. Yeah.

521
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,840
Just individual universal employees driving you in their car.

522
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,720
You got to like move Taco Bell rappers out of the way.

523
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:44,800
Hey, buddy.

524
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,960
In the back.

525
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,560
You just have to say, hey, buddy, can I get a ride?

526
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:51,360
And then it's the right you say it in the right way.

527
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,240
I get an epic ride.

528
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,720
Now you may enter.

529
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,040
Ask gas or grass.

530
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:59,960
No one rides for free to this epic universe.

531
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,320
One of your famous phrases.

532
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,920
I'm looking at this art, too.

533
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:06,160
Are you still talking about something?

534
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:10,640
No, I mean, it is it is not going to be self-contained

535
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,360
in the way that Disney World is, obviously, because you start hitting

536
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:18,360
ponds and neighborhoods and other theme parks and ferris wheels

537
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:22,440
and major highways cutting right through the center of Orlando.

538
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:23,960
Or I guess the outskirts.

539
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:26,960
I don't know where the center of Orlando is, but it would be.

540
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,800
It's interesting to me to see how this will all play out

541
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:33,640
because Universal's original property is not dissimilar

542
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:38,360
to Disneyland's of the two parks kind of adjacent to each other.

543
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:41,920
Hotels and shopping area all connected.

544
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,160
And this kind of breaks that.

545
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:47,040
And if Disneyland never gets a third gate, they're going to need to do

546
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,520
something similar.

547
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:51,040
So they might have to be universal, might have to be the guinea pig

548
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:55,840
in the scenario of theme parks that are related,

549
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,920
but not literally right next to each other and where there's public space in between.

550
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,680
Right. It's Disney World.

551
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:03,160
The parks are all very spread out, but they own it all.

552
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,440
This will be the first time you're dealing with how do you get people

553
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:09,280
down the street in a convenient manner? Right.

554
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:12,920
Do we know where the land they own is on that map?

555
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,600
Has somebody put that together?

556
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:17,280
It's this right corner, right?

557
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:20,200
No, but I'm saying what else do they own?

558
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:23,760
Oh, like, like I would assume really sure I would assume they're

559
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,440
I think I think I've said this on the show before.

560
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:30,320
I assume Disney has some sort of plan over here in Anaheim

561
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,320
where if they could maybe choke all these businesses out,

562
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:35,600
they can start buying stuff up so cheap.

563
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,200
And I would imagine that in 20 years, they would want Anaheim

564
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,720
to resemble Orlando if they could do it.

565
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,640
Yeah. If they can get there won't even be roads anymore.

566
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:46,280
Herb Boulevard's gone. They filled all that in. Right.

567
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:50,160
Well, yeah. Or it's just private roads somehow.

568
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:54,160
Like I would assume Universal has it because Universal is very aggressive.

569
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:59,040
Universal wants to, as Jim Hill has said, flip the script on the Orlando vacation

570
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:03,200
and make or and make the Universal your number one destination.

571
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:06,040
And then you'll go, oh, maybe we'll do a couple of days at Disney,

572
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:10,520
which, of course, would be unprecedented, which they are slowly colonizing

573
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,600
down the road there.

574
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:15,880
You can see the endless summer resort already kind of breaking.

575
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:19,240
This is the best word pattern colonization. Yeah. Yeah.

576
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,680
That's sort of what's going on.

577
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:24,040
These are these kind of what do they call James Tan like encampments?

578
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:27,040
Essentially. Oh, oh, I know. Yeah.

579
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,440
Settlements. Yeah. Settlements.

580
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,520
Probably a good word. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

581
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:34,360
This is like original America, except cooler, because they everywhere

582
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:35,960
has roller coasters. Yeah.

583
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:39,120
And I feel like I've heard rumors that like universal

584
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:43,960
like fun, oh, was fun spot was going to go on the market, like Fun Spot America.

585
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,520
Like they had their eyes on that.

586
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,360
What's fun spot America?

587
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:50,560
Fun Spot America is just kind of like a collection of rides.

588
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,360
It's kind of like a carnival.

589
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:54,120
Generic generic. I don't know.

590
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:56,000
Blow it up. Kill it.

591
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,840
Phil, that's what leaks sludge into the land surrounding it.

592
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,600
Make them have to get foreclosed.

593
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,240
And then we get more universal sea world every now and then.

594
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:07,000
It's like, well, universal just by the sea world property.

595
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,440
Well, that's been a rumor forever, too.

596
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:12,880
Or like, are they just going to sell all of them off and maybe?

597
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,200
I mean, they've already stopped the Shamu show.

598
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,240
So what's the point of this sea world anyway?

599
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:20,320
Like, who cares? They no longer have a thing that I just found out about.

600
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:23,640
A Baywatch stunt show that.

601
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,400
Yeah, they had a Baywatch. Wow.

602
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:31,560
I know that kind of show, which I knew about because it factored into an episode

603
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:34,880
like the Baywatch stunt show exists in the world of Baywatch.

604
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,600
Whoa. The lifeguard.

605
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:39,800
So Mitch Buchanan goes to watch the Baywatch stunt show

606
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,720
in which he's done a voice.

607
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,280
You hear him over the loudspeaker.

608
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,080
This is Mitch Buchanan from Bay.

609
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:47,360
You're like in this world, you're a lifeguard.

610
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,280
Right. Not a famous person.

611
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:52,360
Why would you this Baywatch is in a universe

612
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:55,600
where lifeguards are the most famous people on Earth.

613
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,200
It's similar to now you see me.

614
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:01,480
One of my favorite franchises in that that's a film where

615
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:04,800
magicians are the center of everyone's universe.

616
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,040
We're thinking about magicians.

617
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:08,040
I mean, the horsemen certainly are.

618
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,320
Yes. Yeah. Yeah.

619
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:13,280
It would it be that way in our world if there were magicians as good as the horsemen.

620
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:17,240
But but but there are not, sadly, only in the now you see me universe.

621
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:19,280
Love those fucking movies.

622
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,280
You got to join up next time.

623
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,160
I haven't seen them.

624
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:25,800
I don't think I knew you were in the club, the Nicem Club and YSM.

625
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:28,360
Is there going to be a third one? Yeah, I believe so.

626
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,400
Oh, wow. Yes.

627
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:32,200
And it's one of those where they're drastically expanding the role of

628
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:37,240
a Chinese side character to make it do better in China, where it secretly did well.

629
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:40,240
Oh, no, that's a separate.

630
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,840
Yeah, separate as a spin off.

631
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:45,480
Well, because a lot of the second one takes place in Macau.

632
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:49,520
Was there going to be a theme park attraction somewhere in like the Lions

633
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,640
Gate line? Yes, in the Lions Gate.

634
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,960
I'm sorry. So sorry, then that that's not going to.

635
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,520
Well, but it could still have.

636
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:59,280
So now the Lions Gate stuff again, we call that we call that

637
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:01,200
would never happen in Times Square.

638
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,200
Very early on, we are. Yeah.

639
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:06,920
Yeah. But we will call the Quibi will be a smash.

640
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,560
We're going to be a smash hit.

641
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:11,320
We're putting all of our eggs in that basket.

642
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:12,680
Yeah. You want to.

643
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:17,360
So let's just can we direct deposit the Patreon money straight into Quibi stock?

644
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:18,760
Can we just so there's no middle.

645
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:21,640
It goes straight into shares of Quibi.

646
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,360
Sure. Yeah, let's do it.

647
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,000
I think we're all agree.

648
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,080
A guy in the train to Comic Con said, don't sleep on Quibi.

649
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:31,160
And I never did. I haven't yet.

650
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:33,960
Were you going to like pass out on a dog or something on the train?

651
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,600
It was his dog, Quibi.

652
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,920
Yes, that's what he's talking about.

653
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:39,160
He was a hobo with a dog named Quibi.

654
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:42,800
Similarly, a few summers ago, I was at an audition

655
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:46,000
and I heard a guy in the waiting room go, well, you know,

656
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:48,560
biggest name of comedy right now, see. So.

657
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:52,840
And I had just shot something for see.

658
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:56,760
So and been told, hey, it's going up.

659
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,440
But then see, so shutting down.

660
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:04,760
So it was great to hear your thing was up for it was like in that

661
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:09,720
if you turned on see, so in the minute before, like from eleven fifty

662
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:13,320
nine to midnight, you could watch the flu philanthropy

663
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:15,960
starring Flula Borg, Ed Helms and me.

664
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,920
And you are the I've seen this.

665
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:20,080
It's great. And you're the third.

666
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,920
No, no, you're the second lead of the show.

667
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,320
Essentially. Yes.

668
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:25,480
Yeah. This is a thing the world doesn't get to see.

669
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:29,000
Yeah, it was up for one for 60 seconds and then.

670
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,080
Yeah. Maybe you'll get a quibby pickup.

671
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,160
Maybe maybe, you know, why not?

672
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:37,120
We'll see. But did you shoot it in two formats?

673
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,760
Oh, shit. Long ways.

674
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,240
Oh, shit.

675
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,080
Yeah. Yeah. That's going to be hard.

676
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,720
I kill you, unfortunately.

677
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,320
All right. Well, it's all the next one.

678
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,640
You know, they're on it.

679
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,840
It'll air on Epic.

680
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:52,400
The epic universe only

681
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:55,360
streaming site that you can only watch it

682
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,000
while you're in epic universe.

683
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,800
Probably not far off, honestly.

684
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:03,520
It'll be epic how they will somehow pay me even less.

685
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,600
Yeah. Which is which would be

686
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:09,400
I don't know how they would be able to do that unless they paid me

687
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,200
in the company's script.

688
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,880
Yeah. They'll be able to figure it out, I think.

689
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:16,800
Yeah. They have people working on the chairs from our office.

690
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,480
You need it. Do you need an office chair?

691
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,680
No. If you can imagine, we don't need it anymore.

692
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,920
We don't need any of these push pins or sticky notes.

693
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,200
Well, it turns out I do need all of those things.

694
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,960
So I'm taking those. Thank you.

695
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,280
All right. So back to this map

696
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:34,160
with all these lights shooting into the air.

697
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:36,000
Yeah. So walk us.

698
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,200
You beautiful glowing lights.

699
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,640
It's a very glowy.

700
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:41,000
Yeah. So we're indicating.

701
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,480
I mean, it needs its own hotel in city walk because it's so far away

702
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,200
from everything else. Right.

703
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,200
Own city. You think they'll call it city walk?

704
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,360
I don't know.

705
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:53,200
And maybe probably like the marketplace.

706
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,160
That's probably right about that.

707
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,680
It's probably not going to be called city walk.

708
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:59,680
As this looks like a village, maybe maybe.

709
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,960
I'm going for epic walk.

710
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,960
And maybe I should trademark that word.

711
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:08,080
Epic Square, maybe.

712
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:13,560
Epic Square, like it does feel like this is going to be like a classier overall.

713
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:17,160
They're like, oh, they're going for a Disney sea from at least the look of this art.

714
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:20,200
We'll see if it actually looks like that detail wise when they build it.

715
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:23,760
It's kind of an architectural style that isn't specific to it.

716
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,440
It's not emulating a current place.

717
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:30,320
It feels very future.

718
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,400
It's the future of the Middle East.

719
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,440
I feel maybe like Dubai.

720
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,680
Yeah, sort of.

721
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:36,960
Yes, I agree with that.

722
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,680
Money is what you're looking at.

723
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:40,240
That's what you're feeling.

724
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:41,480
Yes. Yeah.

725
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:44,840
But it's very but a lot of domes, a lot of domes, atriums.

726
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:45,880
I'm a fan of that stuff.

727
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:49,800
I heard there was a rumor that there would be like a couple like mild rides for free.

728
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,800
Now, I'm looking at this thing.

729
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,080
Does this seem like a Ferris wheel?

730
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:54,600
Perhaps someone's guessing Carousel Carousel.

731
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,920
That's what I meant. I'm sorry.

732
00:34:56,920 --> 00:35:01,200
So maybe they have like a couple little kiddie kind of rides that you can ride for free.

733
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:05,320
Get you get you a little taste of those rides and then very generous.

734
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:06,400
You get a ticket.

735
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:09,120
I mean, where does this where does the park start?

736
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,880
Well, but now that's the thing.

737
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:16,760
So a big credit to theme park university because it they they called what.

738
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:19,160
Yeah, so it seems like it was going to be the art.

739
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,560
So the art of this confirms all these rumors for the most part.

740
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:27,800
Now, I will say Universal is saying basically we're not going to announce any of the lands yet.

741
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,680
We're not announcing when it's opening.

742
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:30,680
This is still art.

743
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:32,640
We're not announcing the cost.

744
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:33,640
Well, yeah. Yeah.

745
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,400
But this is subject to change.

746
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:39,600
But I would imagine this is going to look pretty similar if they're releasing it.

747
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:46,640
But yes, theme park university basically called it that you enter here at the bottom here on the bottom.

748
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,760
And that's probably free to enter.

749
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:52,000
They haven't confirmed that.

750
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:57,120
And then this is all walkable, free shops, restaurants, maybe a few rides.

751
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,640
You're showing me most of the place.

752
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:03,160
Right. And this is the hotel, which is found at the opposite side of the park.

753
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:07,440
Yeah. So supposedly all that is going to be able to be gone into for free.

754
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:11,960
And then these four sections are the actual park.

755
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,600
So that's the park.

756
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:14,960
That's the park.

757
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,400
That's the park.

758
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,560
Strange.

759
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:18,600
And this is the park.

760
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:23,000
And they won't. You will have to go in and out and leave to get to the other parts.

761
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,040
So you will not be able to get to the other worlds.

762
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:27,360
Constant going in and out of admission gates.

763
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:29,040
Yes. That's weird.

764
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:31,800
It's all I get the idea of it.

765
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:34,360
I'm I'm of two minds about it, honestly.

766
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:39,920
Yeah. I mean, they've experimented with a little because to ride that you have not been to Diagon Alley yet.

767
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:45,960
So if you're going to take the Hogwarts Express while both parks are open, you need to card

768
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:48,520
in because you are entering a second park.

769
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:50,480
Yeah. I mean, it's like Disney.

770
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,160
It's like Disneyland, the California adventure.

771
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:55,320
It's not like that's not it's not like that has no precedent.

772
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,840
I've had four of them.

773
00:36:56,840 --> 00:37:02,200
But is that why that all four of those are like as sizable as a well, that's what's the theme.

774
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:06,760
I think that could you only buy admission for one or two?

775
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:09,160
That's a question that I has not been answered.

776
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:13,960
I'm guessing no, I'm guessing that's going to be too complicated because somebody is going to get

777
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:17,280
confused and they'd rather just sell a day pass to all of them.

778
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,360
But it's possible. I mean, yeah, I don't know.

779
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,520
I'm confused.

780
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:23,320
It's possible that you could just buy in.

781
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:28,520
But I think the rumors are that it's a one day pass and then you can go anywhere you want.

782
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:32,120
And right now, the rumor was there'll be four different lands when it opens.

783
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:35,280
And that's what we see on this map and this piece of art.

784
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:40,840
And now we should really clarify here that we are dissecting a label free map.

785
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,480
Yes, no piece of IP is clear whatsoever.

786
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,960
And that's the big thing from today.

787
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:53,240
We don't know what the lands are, but we do also if we're going off of this, I think, because it looks well, because it looks OK.

788
00:37:53,240 --> 00:38:00,680
So people have already identified we're late to the start in the lower left and let's just go clockwise.

789
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,120
The one over that's my dog.

790
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,880
That's not so OK.

791
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,800
So here. So people have already named these online.

792
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,240
We're slow to get here.

793
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:09,800
This, to me, is Nintendo.

794
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,880
This looks just like it.

795
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:17,480
And someone on a YouTube video points out like this looks so they've decolored

796
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:26,120
a lot of it to make it a little more generic for whatever, because I guess they just don't want us to know, even though it's pretty clear, like it's boxy and blocky.

797
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:31,840
And then somebody pointed out this is identical to the Donkey Kong land art that's been released.

798
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:36,400
And you can see like the little like Tiki, Hutter, Towers or whatever you call them.

799
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,760
And like there's a track there that would be the mine cart coaster.

800
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:45,480
I think you're right. So it's pretty and Nintendo is not going into islands or main universal.

801
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:49,200
So I think this is maybe this is the most safe bet of all four.

802
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,560
This for sure is going to be Nintendo.

803
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:54,120
I think you're correct. And yeah.

804
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:59,160
And from the look of it, they'll be this is probably the Mario Kart show building right here.

805
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,280
There's a massive show building.

806
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:03,760
Yeah. And it's a big black box.

807
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:07,160
So I guess everybody will freak the fuck out like that Guardians thing.

808
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:10,120
Yes. Everybody cool it about the black.

809
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:11,600
What else are you going to put up?

810
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:12,680
It was tall, I guess.

811
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:14,280
Well, it means you get a big old ride.

812
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,000
Yeah, I don't know.

813
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,640
Where do people are?

814
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:17,880
Here's a little.

815
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:22,280
I might say, am I talking to anyone who is like, am I is anyone on the other side of this argument?

816
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:25,560
And be like, I will choose to stay mad about the black box.

817
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:27,440
I don't know. Are you guys mad about the big box?

818
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:30,320
I mean, I'm sure it's also not done.

819
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,600
I don't know. I mean, the universe.

820
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,320
Is it a blue is in a big blue box?

821
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:37,880
Is it blue? I mean, but it's still how many years from open?

822
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:40,520
Like I have to think to put something on it like.

823
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,520
I don't know. I mean, I was just like, OK, I don't know.

824
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,600
I didn't really think that much.

825
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,760
Spray paint. Sorry, it's a box.

826
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,440
Yeah. Then then that's OK.

827
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:50,360
Star Lord, like he wrote it.

828
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:54,080
And that's a reverent and people like that in one of the public filings.

829
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:59,560
The site's maximum allowed building height is 400 feet,

830
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:05,160
which is about 37 stories, just under 37 stories.

831
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:08,360
I remember that when my grandparents were alive,

832
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:11,200
their neighbors were mad at them because they built a like a little

833
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:15,160
like outdoor house on their deck and they couldn't see the boring road

834
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:18,680
that was passed because they used to be able to see the road

835
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:21,120
through my grandparents here and they had a big fight about it.

836
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,120
I remember this now.

837
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,360
So I think it's a similar thing.

838
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:26,320
It's just like a thing goes up and people get mad

839
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:29,640
because they're used to being able to see where they used to be able to see.

840
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,240
Same thing as my grandparents.

841
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:32,320
They weren't building a third.

842
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:34,120
It wasn't a 37 story.

843
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:38,280
My grandparents did not build a 37 story roller coaster in the back.

844
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,920
It would have been unbelievable.

845
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,800
We have had the finest.

846
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:44,880
Wait, but what are you missing out on a view of now that there's a box?

847
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:48,200
No, nothing. I'm just saying it's the idea that you're being deprived

848
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:50,320
of something, even if it's nothing.

849
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:54,760
Just the feeling of it is like you're taking something away from certain people.

850
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:57,080
Sure. Now, I will agree that

851
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:01,840
when I was in Disney, see, there's a big there's a big old theater.

852
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:06,360
I didn't see a show in the theater, but then a big old theater has to be in a big box.

853
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:11,680
But they took the time to theme it and make it bricks that looked nice.

854
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,720
And I appreciated that because that's your view coming into the park.

855
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:17,960
So I look, I want things to be a city.

856
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:19,720
I don't want a box, I guess.

857
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:22,240
But I think people are very mad about this.

858
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,080
I haven't. I mean, I've seen a little of it.

859
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:26,080
Well, let's make our judgment when we go there.

860
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:29,040
Maybe we will hate the box and it be agreeing with everyone.

861
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,320
We may yet. Maybe so.

862
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:32,240
I share with you. We'll see how mad we get.

863
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:36,360
It might be balanced out that all my friends from Guardians of the Galaxy are inside.

864
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,200
Yeah, think about that.

865
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,960
Yeah, sure. All your buds are there.

866
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:42,800
Stuber's in there. Stuber is in there.

867
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,920
I don't know which one's Stuber.

868
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:48,000
I think Kumail is Stuber, but Kumail is not there.

869
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,520
Kumail is joining the Marvel Universe.

870
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:52,240
So he will be able to reteam with. Is he?

871
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:54,360
Dave Batista. Yeah, he's in the new.

872
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:55,720
Was that one of the announcements?

873
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:57,160
One of the. Yes, it was.

874
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:58,640
OK. And he's jacked now.

875
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:00,040
He's getting jacked.

876
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:02,080
So he's going to be as big as Dave Batista.

877
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:03,840
Wow. So, yeah.

878
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,480
Stuber will be. People are getting the call that they want.

879
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:07,560
Like we've chosen you to get jacked.

880
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:12,480
Yeah. So maybe when they do Stuber too, they'll both be the same size.

881
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:15,880
Wow. There's a decent chance of that.

882
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:18,040
Stuber's not going to take your shit anymore.

883
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:19,720
He says. The whole new dynamic.

884
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:21,320
Stuber is jacked now.

885
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:23,560
Super Stuber. That's the tagline.

886
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:26,000
Oh, Stuber. Super Stuber is a good.

887
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,440
That's a good title. Yeah.

888
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,280
I mean, it's the format of that.

889
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,800
There was a Mario Brothers game and then a Super Mario Brothers.

890
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:35,640
Some franchise has to go from regular to why not?

891
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:38,080
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

892
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:40,480
From a date night to super date night.

893
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,680
Good boys to super good boys.

894
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:44,920
I mean, which but we have.

895
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:46,600
Well, that's us. Yeah.

896
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:47,280
Yeah.

897
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:50,720
We are super good boys today.

898
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:52,000
And clean our plates.

899
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,680
All right. Anyway, there's another land here.

900
00:42:56,680 --> 00:43:00,640
So this is now bottom right when you're looking at it.

901
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:04,240
And people are saying because these are the four that were rumored.

902
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:07,520
And this is the one I would be least sure of.

903
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:12,360
But how to train your dragon land is probably this bottom right.

904
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:15,240
There's a big, long dual launch coaster.

905
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:19,920
And really all nice and very big, huge, very huge.

906
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:20,920
Looks fun.

907
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:24,720
I honestly I don't see anything else that would make me think it's

908
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:26,280
how to train your dragon land.

909
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:29,280
Other than just reasonably certain that land will be.

910
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:31,360
But that's what the strong rumor is.

911
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:34,360
So I'm assuming that it's some sort of dragon coaster.

912
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:40,760
I think those are like little like places like little like, I don't know.

913
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:43,320
Like it looks like houses from the movie.

914
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:44,160
I've never seen it.

915
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:46,760
I think little like huts and stuff from the movie.

916
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:48,600
I've never scolded about needing to see these.

917
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:49,600
Zach did.

918
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:50,120
These are.

919
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:52,320
Yeah, I believe people like these a lot.

920
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:53,320
I haven't done it yet.

921
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:54,320
I haven't.

922
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:55,320
Three of them now.

923
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:56,320
I like to start.

924
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:57,680
You know, I got to start at the beginning.

925
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:01,800
Although I saw now you see me too before one and I was so taken with it.

926
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:05,320
I like immediately ran home and when it was spoiled.

927
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:06,320
Oh, that's it.

928
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:07,320
I had already.

929
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:08,320
You knew the horseman.

930
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:09,320
Yeah.

931
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:11,320
I still got a lot of wrestling to catch up on.

932
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:12,320
So I can't watch it.

933
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:13,480
Although I did watch Hello.

934
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:14,480
I did watch Hellraiser.

935
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:15,480
Lindsay and I watch Hellraiser.

936
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:18,480
Oh, you went to a world beyond pleasure and pain.

937
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:19,480
Yeah, I guess.

938
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:20,480
Yeah.

939
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:23,480
If you think because I was thinking like, you know, I'm in a haunts and I was saying,

940
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:26,480
well, but like I never wanted to watch horror movies and as a kid, I went into blockbuster

941
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:29,480
and I would see Hellraiser and I would think, why would you ever?

942
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:30,480
Yeah.

943
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:35,480
Why would you ever scared by the very idea, the idea of pinhead and the thing sticking

944
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:36,480
into his face?

945
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:37,480
And I was like, I don't know.

946
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:38,480
I don't know.

947
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:39,480
I don't know.

948
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:40,480
I don't know.

949
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:41,640
I don't know what's sticking into his face.

950
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:45,200
And I was like, well, and she was like, yeah, I felt the same when I go, well, let's see

951
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:48,200
what I go because I have no concept of what it's like.

952
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:49,200
I really don't.

953
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:50,200
So I was like, all right.

954
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:52,840
And it is gross as shit.

955
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:55,480
It's so gross.

956
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:57,160
And then pinhead doesn't show.

957
00:44:57,160 --> 00:45:01,920
This spoiler alert from a movie came out in 1987.

958
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:05,760
Pinhead and his cronies don't show up until like an hour into it.

959
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:08,400
And he and his cronies are great.

960
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:13,160
He's like an English guy and they're like maybe all English and they have cool designs.

961
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:15,080
And then when they show up, you're like, oh, that's cool.

962
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:16,640
They come out of this weird box.

963
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:17,840
The lament configuration.

964
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:18,840
You've seen it.

965
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:19,840
I haven't seen it.

966
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:22,040
It's just been a running thing on Twitter lately.

967
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:24,480
Like everyone keeps seeing hell raiser jokes.

968
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:27,120
I've just like you have just most.

969
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:30,880
I've watched Hellraiser because people because I'm not.

970
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:32,160
What do they say in that?

971
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:35,480
Like I have such wonderful things to show you or like something like that.

972
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:36,480
Something like that.

973
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:37,480
The plot is insane.

974
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:43,880
The plot is a woman wants starts killing people to help resurrect her dead ex-boyfriend that

975
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:46,600
she used to have like hot sex with.

976
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:49,360
And she's like so in love with him still.

977
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:50,960
She starts killing people.

978
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:56,480
And then the daughter of her current husband like meet Pinhead and his cronies and they

979
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:59,080
want to like take the other guy's soul back.

980
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:01,080
So she gets mixed in with all of it.

981
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:05,000
But then I was like once Pinhead showed up, I was like, OK, I like this.

982
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:10,840
Before that, it is a lot of like hooks going into fake skin and ripping the skin and blood

983
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:11,840
everywhere.

984
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:13,080
And there's tons of these movies.

985
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:15,360
I think there was just a direct to Netflix.

986
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:19,840
There's like 10 hell raisers and I think they're all bad except maybe the first two.

987
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:20,840
Yeah.

988
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:25,640
But anyway, so now I'm Fred Durst has directed like three of them that we don't know.

989
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:26,640
All right.

990
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:29,360
So this is the Hellblazer portal.

991
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:31,440
This is the next one is Hellblazer.

992
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:34,560
You have to solve a puzzle box to get into it.

993
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:36,280
There's 30 pictures of Edwin.

994
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:38,320
Well, he does.

995
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:39,120
He gets his own.

996
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:42,120
My phone is, of course, like overheated now and it doesn't want to.

997
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:43,120
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

998
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:44,520
There's a lot of pressure on your phone.

999
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:49,280
So thanks for bouncing your phone to the TV to give us an epic view.

1000
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:53,040
Also, I'm glad the park will always have fireworks.

1001
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:54,040
Yeah.

1002
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:56,360
Going just all hours of the day.

1003
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:57,640
Just once an hour.

1004
00:46:57,640 --> 00:46:59,400
Eight hours.

1005
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:01,360
Oh, yeah. Maybe it just never stops.

1006
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:02,080
I hope so.

1007
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:02,920
It's just. Yeah.

1008
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:04,520
That's where all the money goes.

1009
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:09,760
So we go up here and the fantastic beasts and where to find them.

1010
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:11,560
The Harry Potter spin off.

1011
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:13,520
I would think this is that was a rumored land.

1012
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:18,240
And this looks like fantastic beasts because it looks like old time New York City.

1013
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:20,000
And what I like about is that right?

1014
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,360
No, I zoom in a little.

1015
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:23,120
I think it's supposed to be Paris.

1016
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:23,800
Oh, is that right?

1017
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:26,600
See the blue and the yet potentially.

1018
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:27,600
Where is that? Where am I looking at?

1019
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:28,680
The old time New York.

1020
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:30,600
Zoom in on just like the windows.

1021
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:31,800
No, to the right.

1022
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:33,440
I can only zoom so far here.

1023
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:40,400
The people were speculating, I think, just because the tan, those blue roofs are kind of all over Paris.

1024
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:40,920
Sure.

1025
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:41,440
OK.

1026
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:42,440
I think you're right.

1027
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:43,200
OK.

1028
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:44,560
So where's that movie set?

1029
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:46,880
This is in place in Paris.

1030
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:49,360
OK, because the original was in New York.

1031
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:50,960
So now it's who knows?

1032
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:52,760
Subject to change city.

1033
00:47:52,760 --> 00:48:00,400
What I do like about this is that it appears to be the whole land is in a show building from the look of this, maybe past the fireworks.

1034
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:08,440
But that means you can do a lot, obviously, of like, you know, setting a scene and a mood if you can control the sky.

1035
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:08,960
Sure.

1036
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:10,360
So they can control the sky.

1037
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:21,680
Do you feel at all, though, now with Fantastic Beasts and How to Train Your Dragon, we're pretty specific to franchises?

1038
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:27,920
Well, this is and this is, yeah, people have been talking about Star Wars and people were upset that such a big thing was was devoted to an IP,

1039
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:35,680
which, you know, we all like Cars Land and I think we kind of aren't too hard saying, agreeing with those people.

1040
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:44,160
But I think with Dragon and especially Fantastic Beasts, the bloom is a little bit off the rose on the Fantastic Beasts at this point,

1041
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:47,440
unless this next movie like resuscitates it.

1042
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:54,800
So it is, you know, this thing will open in two years, three years, probably, probably three years at least.

1043
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:55,640
Yeah, at least.

1044
00:48:55,680 --> 00:49:01,760
If not, but Universal does build fast and then half of it doesn't work, but they do get it open.

1045
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:04,680
So, yeah, Fantastic Beasts is done.

1046
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:06,640
The next movie eats shit.

1047
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:11,440
And there's a whole one of the quarter of the park is devoted to it.

1048
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:12,960
It is a little weird.

1049
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:23,480
I do wonder if they didn't announce all the lands because they're wondering if they could just maybe generically call this Harry Potter three version three or something.

1050
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:24,560
You know what I mean?

1051
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:33,880
There might be a chance that like if they had developed a magic based attraction, just call it Harry Potter or call it like Harry Potter's Paris or whatever.

1052
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:36,600
Well, like, you know, even Star Wars.

1053
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:39,120
Yeah, it's a land based on the biggest IP of all time.

1054
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:45,000
And the fact that it is, you know, it's probably largely episode seven through nine, but, you know, it's sort of mendable.

1055
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,040
Flexible.

1056
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:48,640
Star Wars in general and its own thing.

1057
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:53,320
And yeah, but yeah, I mean, you're right that Cars is not a pro.

1058
00:49:53,360 --> 00:50:01,880
I don't know why I'm bringing this up with them that these feel a little less like, well, classic or like, will they all matter in five years or?

1059
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:05,600
I think a couple of that one universal has always been ride the movies.

1060
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:11,960
So it's movies people know I have to think they focus group like tested enough of that.

1061
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:18,200
These are things people have a positive association with and like I mean, Nintendo feels like a slam dunk.

1062
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:23,440
Well, that's why I like of all four and we'll get to the last one of all four Nintendo slam dunk.

1063
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:28,520
How the Train Your Dragon sustained three movies, I think pretty well reviewed universally.

1064
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:31,640
Like not like my Edwin is having a nightmare.

1065
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:37,880
If that's the noise you're hearing on the mics, it sounds like he's underwater when he has a bad dream.

1066
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:43,400
But yeah, so Nintendo, obviously, that's going to be around forever, seemingly forever.

1067
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:47,600
Like, there's no slowing down. All the games are still great.

1068
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:49,440
But yeah, I don't know.

1069
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:56,720
I wonder because because for a while it was this was going to be called Fantastic Worlds, which was fantastic, similar to Fantastic Beasts.

1070
00:50:56,720 --> 00:51:00,400
Like maybe they were like, oh, this is the anchor that his nightmare is getting worse.

1071
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:02,360
Yeah. Wow. Oh, boy.

1072
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:05,400
Edwin, who's who's good? Edwin.

1073
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:08,120
So many yips. Edwin.

1074
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:09,920
Oh, gosh. Wow.

1075
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:11,440
I wonder if the listener can hear.

1076
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:17,280
Is this a common thing on a podcast where the hostess to apologize for his dog having a loud underwater nightmare?

1077
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:20,880
You know, we really haven't apologized for technical difficulties, maybe ever.

1078
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:25,360
So, yeah, we got a good track record with that, but that is a very distracting sound.

1079
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:27,040
I think he's out of it right now.

1080
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:32,360
See, what's is he having a nightmare about there being another giant deaf robot in the park world?

1081
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:33,520
Yeah, he doesn't like this.

1082
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:36,640
A Grindelwald. He specifically he likes Jack.

1083
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:41,960
OK, but Grindelwald, he hates Grindelwald is the mascot for the whole park.

1084
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:44,640
Grindelwald walking around.

1085
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:46,560
It's a nightmare, but I for traffic.

1086
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:52,240
You want to get stuck on it? Look, there's a bunch that's closed right now.

1087
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:55,200
You can't even take that off.

1088
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:56,720
Well, they are going to have to fix that.

1089
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:58,160
They're going to have to fix. I do wonder.

1090
00:51:58,160 --> 00:51:59,360
Oh, it went off the screen.

1091
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:04,120
I do wonder if it's just like, yeah, Harry Potter's New York or whatever.

1092
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:05,680
You call me Paris.

1093
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:08,200
Magical, the magical world, the Wizarding World.

1094
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:10,600
There I guess that.

1095
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:12,200
I guess that's true.

1096
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:13,520
Wizarding City.

1097
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:16,680
But the last quadrant is classic.

1098
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:21,440
Well, so the last quadrant, it was the rumor and we talked about it a little bit,

1099
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:25,680
but it's on the map and it looks to be the smallest of the four,

1100
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:29,040
potentially, maybe Fantastic Beasts.

1101
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:34,440
But it looks like Universal Classic Monster Land is here,

1102
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:38,320
which is the most exciting of all four and me.

1103
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:40,720
And maybe just I mean, Nintendo, very exciting, too.

1104
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:46,480
But the idea of like probably having more leeway, honestly, of all four.

1105
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:50,520
Yeah, because these are like they're supposedly based again on the classic

1106
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:53,840
monster movies, so probably they can do whatever they want.

1107
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:59,000
So you're looking at like what appears to be like a castle and like a small town,

1108
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:03,520
like a creepy town that I'm sure they'll do, like a flash mob of like Frankenstern

1109
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:06,160
chasing Frankenstein's monster with pitchforks.

1110
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:07,680
Like that would be fun.

1111
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:10,040
And every like at nine o'clock at night,

1112
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:12,600
you get to grab a pitchfork and chase a monster out of town.

1113
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:15,400
That's my kind of interactive experience.

1114
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:18,280
You'll you'll be I'll be I'll be a pig.

1115
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:20,160
We'll be part of chasing him away.

1116
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:21,640
Yeah, well, I guess that's no, no, no.

1117
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:25,680
Oh, I'll be the one who like gets in front of the mob and is like, no,

1118
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:27,520
you don't understand.

1119
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:29,400
He's he has feelings.

1120
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:31,720
We are the monsters. Right.

1121
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:33,360
I love him. I love him.

1122
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:34,720
I'm in love with him.

1123
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:36,280
So they'll pick somebody out of the crowd to do that.

1124
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:37,320
And it'll be me.

1125
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:39,880
I mean, I think I feel like maybe pitchforks,

1126
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:43,440
but I don't think Universal's going to willingly have a torch wielding mob.

1127
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:44,440
Yeah.

1128
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:46,520
2019. That's true.

1129
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:48,440
A tiki torch mob.

1130
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:50,040
That would be a bad optics, maybe.

1131
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:53,120
Yeah. Or may our regular or honest to God torches.

1132
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:54,920
It's still in vogue.

1133
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:56,320
Are they still? Yeah, that's a good.

1134
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:57,960
Societal with classic monster movies.

1135
00:53:57,960 --> 00:54:02,320
Or they'll sell like a kiddie version of a torch with like a light up fire.

1136
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:05,120
So they'll make like thirty dollars per torch.

1137
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:07,160
Pretty good idea, I think.

1138
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:11,240
And then like there's there's like monsters that will interact with in the land.

1139
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:13,480
So you wave. It's like the Harry Potter ones.

1140
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:17,720
You wave your child's torch at like a Frankenstein robot and he goes,

1141
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:20,200
and like that'll be fun for the kids.

1142
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:23,480
Because they can sell RFID crosses to like word off.

1143
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:25,720
That would be a poor taste. Yeah.

1144
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:28,120
Mm hmm. But they can sell garlic.

1145
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:31,480
Oh, that's better. That's yeah, that is good.

1146
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:32,840
So there'll be different things.

1147
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:36,080
You can buy that a Bluetooth in them to ward off the monsters.

1148
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:38,000
Met a Dracula monster.

1149
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:41,680
Yeah, I don't know how the Dracula a Dracula, you know, a Dracula monster.

1150
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:44,800
I didn't think a second thought of when you said it.

1151
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:48,640
I think we're all agreed in the way we like to say these monster names.

1152
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:51,400
And you're with a hunchback.

1153
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:55,800
You can also see there's like an empathy.

1154
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:59,400
No one's quite sure what the do you have a guess of what the empathy or is?

1155
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:00,840
Just his graveyard review.

1156
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:03,040
A giant beetle juices graveyard.

1157
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:06,480
Finally, the 5000 seats that he's been asking for.

1158
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:08,800
Yeah, the capacity, because it's always sold out.

1159
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:10,680
You can never get in finally.

1160
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:13,600
Or just a permanent Bill and Ted show.

1161
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:15,120
Oh, my God.

1162
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:20,280
An epic Bill and Ted show, maybe rewritten topical every night.

1163
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:22,280
Yeah. You can go to the warm up.

1164
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:24,280
You can watch them rehearse at three thirty.

1165
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:27,880
They're doing it more casually in plain clothes, throwing cards out. Right.

1166
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:31,640
John Hickenlooper.

1167
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:33,920
John Delaney.

1168
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:36,320
Jay Inslee.

1169
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:40,680
Yeah. But what was the one?

1170
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:42,920
Biden 3033.

1171
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:44,680
Oh, yeah.

1172
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:46,240
Was this be all by the time this comes out?

1173
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:47,720
But what was Biden three?

1174
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:49,400
Was Joe 303?

1175
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:51,280
So he fucked that up.

1176
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:54,000
I believe he said it was a website.

1177
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:57,800
And what he was supposed to say is if you text Biden

1178
00:55:58,040 --> 00:56:01,200
to that sequence of numbers, all right.

1179
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:04,080
He also fucked up deductibles and copays.

1180
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:07,480
Kind of an important distinction for a health care debate to have.

1181
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:08,560
Sort of big this year.

1182
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:09,280
Sort of big.

1183
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:11,360
Might not have the stamina for this. Yeah.

1184
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:16,000
Anyway, yeah. Go to 303.

1185
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,480
What do you mean? Go to it.

1186
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:19,160
Is it a physical place?

1187
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:21,280
You talk about a box I have to find.

1188
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:23,720
Walk to the box. Walk to the area.

1189
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:24,720
All right.

1190
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:28,520
It's going to be a lot now. That's going to be a lot of traffic.

1191
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:29,920
Everybody going to three or three.

1192
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:33,520
Oh, it once had you think Biden has ever taken the Hogwarts Express?

1193
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:36,640
He loves trains. He loves trains.

1194
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:37,960
I mean, he goes to Universal.

1195
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:39,240
That's all he does. Yeah.

1196
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:40,520
He has the Hogwarts.

1197
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:43,720
Well, we can circle back around to closing thoughts on this.

1198
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:45,760
But I since you bring up trains.

1199
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:47,720
Oh, I cannot help this segue.

1200
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:51,440
Do you guys know about Virgin Trains USA?

1201
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:53,760
Yeah. So no reason to go into it.

1202
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:55,480
I know all about it.

1203
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:56,560
I'm covered.

1204
00:56:56,560 --> 00:56:57,840
No, I don't know. What's this?

1205
00:56:57,840 --> 00:57:01,720
So this is currently the United States is only privately owned

1206
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:05,120
and operated intercity passenger railroad.

1207
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:11,080
Virgin Virgin Richard Branson owned Richard Branson.

1208
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:13,640
Trains. Yeah, they took over.

1209
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,080
I think it was called Brightline previously.

1210
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:19,840
And he owns it unlike because he sold Virgin Airlines to Alaska Airlines.

1211
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:21,280
Right. He still owns this.

1212
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:23,000
He still owns some Virgin stuff.

1213
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,520
So this is a line connecting

1214
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:31,120
the downtowns of Fort Lauderdale, West Palm Beach and Miami.

1215
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:34,080
And they are expanding to Orlando,

1216
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:38,960
to a terminal at the Orlando International Airport.

1217
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:41,040
The what is it called?

1218
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:44,800
I believe it's the Intermodal Terminal.

1219
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:48,560
An Intermodal Terminal uses multiple forms of transportation.

1220
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:52,400
In this case, the train probably in the future, a regional rail,

1221
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:57,320
people movers to get you to the main, of course, the famous Orlando Airport

1222
00:57:57,320 --> 00:58:01,640
people movers, the main airport terminal is about a mile away

1223
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:04,320
from this intermodal terminal that's still being built.

1224
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:09,000
It reuses the plans for the former Florida High Speed Rail,

1225
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:12,120
which Florida scumbag Rick Scott, the former

1226
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:18,080
Florida governor, said he would not take federal funding for that project.

1227
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:18,920
Right.

1228
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:23,160
Current Florida scumbag governor

1229
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:26,480
Rick DeSantis was at this announcement today at the convention center.

1230
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:28,880
He didn't really say anything.

1231
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:33,160
But he's OK with he's OK with intermodal intermodality.

1232
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:39,040
I look well, I think because private industry is paying for it.

1233
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:41,040
Oh, I see that changes. Oh, yeah.

1234
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:43,680
Yeah. So no skin off his back. So no skin off his back.

1235
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:47,040
So this so this is connecting Miami to Orlando,

1236
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:50,040
which is a big deal. It's connecting at the airport.

1237
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:55,760
There's rumors that they've been talking to Disney to have a stop at Disney World.

1238
00:58:56,080 --> 00:58:59,000
And at this event today, you know,

1239
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:04,160
Universal had said, like, you know, with every bit of strength we've got,

1240
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:08,880
we're trying to get a stop at the convention center,

1241
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:12,000
which is right across from where this new park will be.

1242
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:16,080
OK, so high speed rail, a privately owned rail,

1243
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:18,760
which in Japan, there's hundreds of rail.

1244
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:19,800
Yeah, it's everywhere.

1245
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:20,960
It's everywhere. Sure.

1246
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:24,400
And a convenient way to get to the parks, among other things.

1247
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:27,440
So this that would be nice because it's like it's hard.

1248
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:31,560
You have to get a long list to get to these places from the airport.

1249
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:33,920
Yeah, we know that's always a bummer.

1250
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:36,680
And you get like, wow, I'm in Orlando.

1251
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:42,760
And it's really if it's five p.m., it's like 45 minutes to an hour drive sometimes.

1252
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:44,960
Yeah. If it's like in the middle of rush hour. Yeah.

1253
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:47,120
So, yeah, high speed rail. Great.

1254
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:50,000
Richard Branson save us, I say. Yeah.

1255
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:55,320
He seems like we love him among the lesser of the evils of well, mega billionaires.

1256
00:59:55,320 --> 00:59:58,880
Yeah. I mean, just search like Richard Branson picking up women.

1257
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:00,040
And it's strange.

1258
01:00:00,040 --> 01:00:04,240
You'll see like 30 different pictures of him, like forcibly holding a woman

1259
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:06,400
in his arms, like at a photo op.

1260
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:09,080
And you're like, oh, something going on there. Yeah.

1261
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:13,400
But even but something going on is better than like specifically

1262
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:16,960
a utter piece of trash specifically.

1263
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:20,480
Yeah. I mean, I think wasn't he accused of something to a couple of months ago?

1264
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:22,800
Probably. Probably. Yeah.

1265
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:28,880
Yeah. But I guess in the scheme of cues is better than if you're still at large.

1266
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:31,560
If you're comparing him to Cosby, 100 percent better than.

1267
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:32,960
Oh, you didn't say you said mogul.

1268
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:36,520
So I would not take Cosby's high speed rail line.

1269
01:00:36,560 --> 01:00:39,760
Steve Wynn, I guess, has been he's pretty bad.

1270
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:43,680
You know, he's not so good as the president of Trump enterprises.

1271
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:45,600
Donald Trump. I don't believe that.

1272
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:47,480
Yeah. I've heard some not so good things about him.

1273
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:48,720
I don't believe it.

1274
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:50,000
He seems like a nice guy.

1275
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,080
I like when he's on TV. He's very dynamic. Yes.

1276
01:00:52,680 --> 01:00:56,360
Tom Williams, chairman and CEO getting back to the park now.

1277
01:00:56,360 --> 01:01:00,200
So Tom Williams, chairman and CEO of Universal Parks and Resorts says

1278
01:01:00,680 --> 01:01:04,560
today at this event, a universe is bigger than a world,

1279
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:09,120
which I feel like is a line that I am shocked we did not hear

1280
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:10,280
in the Democratic debate.

1281
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:13,360
So congratulations to Tom Williams for throwing his hat in.

1282
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:16,800
I'm sure him and his people thought that was a slam dunk line.

1283
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:20,760
Yeah. So that's like the other shots fired shot fired world

1284
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:25,560
here. So, yeah, I mean, we're looking I mean, we'll just anything.

1285
01:01:25,720 --> 01:01:28,960
Like, I'm fascinated by what this Epcot looking building is.

1286
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:30,800
Looks a lot like mission space. Yeah.

1287
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:35,000
Yeah. I mean, the thing with any concept movie concept art, especially,

1288
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:36,240
like, well, it could be.

1289
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:39,680
There's no specifics, but it gives an impression.

1290
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:40,840
It gives a vibe. Right.

1291
01:01:40,840 --> 01:01:43,720
Here's the hall of presidents over here. Sure.

1292
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:46,000
They're just going to do their own. Yeah.

1293
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:49,240
Universal presidents.

1294
01:01:49,240 --> 01:01:52,520
So like was Harrison Ford in Air Force One?

1295
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:55,160
Was he was he a universal movie?

1296
01:01:55,160 --> 01:01:56,760
Oh, that's a good question. Yeah.

1297
01:01:56,760 --> 01:01:59,200
Any anyone who was ever in a universal movie?

1298
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:01,920
Yeah. Was the my fellow Americans?

1299
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:04,520
Was Dave Universal?

1300
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:07,520
No, it's in universal films.

1301
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:10,560
We got any Google results for that?

1302
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:11,640
They're all like from the past.

1303
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:12,480
There's an old movie.

1304
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:16,240
No, that's just that Ronald Reagan was in a movie called Law and Order.

1305
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:18,280
That counts. Put him in. Yeah.

1306
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:21,720
OK, great. From 1953, he stopped at an all time high.

1307
01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:23,200
Yes. This very week.

1308
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:25,240
Yeah. Anything horrible.

1309
01:02:25,240 --> 01:02:29,200
But let's go. Let's think about those better days when he played

1310
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:31,760
a character named Frame Johnson.

1311
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:34,840
What? Frame.

1312
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:36,440
Know what he was called? Frame?

1313
01:02:36,440 --> 01:02:39,800
Not even in 1953. That's fake. That's madness.

1314
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:42,800
It'll be the hall of current universal executives.

1315
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:47,640
The hall of C-suite in the hall of VP executive VPs.

1316
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:51,400
Dwight Cain's co-president domestic marketing.

1317
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:54,360
Cobbcast CEO Brian Roberts.

1318
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:57,400
Rowan Kahn.

1319
01:02:57,800 --> 01:02:59,440
Some more numbers.

1320
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:01,280
Fourteen thousand jobs.

1321
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:05,000
They're saying this will bring to the area at fifteen dollars an hour,

1322
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:08,240
which the current universal rate is twelve dollar base salary.

1323
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:09,880
They said what they're going to pay.

1324
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:13,520
They're saying well, because I think it makes it tries to get them some goodwill.

1325
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:17,120
But people, I mean, you know, there's a lot of the fight for 15 now,

1326
01:03:17,120 --> 01:03:17,920
which is great.

1327
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:21,760
But even by this year, fifteen dollars is not enough.

1328
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:24,440
Like the people already talking about like twenty.

1329
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:27,200
It should be a twenty dollar minimum wage to keep up with.

1330
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:30,400
Well, it's cost of living and inflation and that sort of thing.

1331
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:33,920
So right now is a great time for them to say and fifteen dollars.

1332
01:03:34,360 --> 01:03:37,960
And also the park will be opening twenty twenty nine. Bye, everybody.

1333
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:40,600
Yeah. And then we'll put two and two together.

1334
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:43,960
Florida minimum wage currently is eight forty six.

1335
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:45,160
Is it really? Yeah.

1336
01:03:45,160 --> 01:03:47,560
So they do pay more than minimum wage.

1337
01:03:47,560 --> 01:03:52,120
But as people who live down there and travel down there regularly have told us,

1338
01:03:52,120 --> 01:03:54,960
like it is getting like everywhere else, it's getting more expensive.

1339
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:58,800
Sure. So, yeah, that's kind of a transparent move.

1340
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:03,240
Like we're going to pay everyone fifteen dollars and five years, three to five years.

1341
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:04,240
Yeah.

1342
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:08,840
There's yeah. So I'm just looking if there's anything else interesting on this map.

1343
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:11,160
I like the intro.

1344
01:04:12,360 --> 01:04:16,080
The intro, like the little there's like a little like thing you have to enter.

1345
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:18,520
Oh, you can't see it there. No, there it is.

1346
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:21,240
There's like a little like creepy looking like mouth.

1347
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:24,680
Oh, to get into this universal classic monsters.

1348
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:28,120
That's the one where I wish that I had a higher, even higher res

1349
01:04:29,120 --> 01:04:32,680
to see into it, because it looks very, very cool.

1350
01:04:33,120 --> 01:04:35,520
Yeah. It's just like an old timey town square.

1351
01:04:35,640 --> 01:04:37,680
Yeah. Like they all live in one place.

1352
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:42,120
And the rumor is, yeah, you ticket maybe Kuka arm.

1353
01:04:42,120 --> 01:04:45,040
Dracula's castle ride with all the monsters. Wow.

1354
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:46,320
Which would be great.

1355
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:51,680
And I think I've said before, like they make so much money off of scary stuff

1356
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:53,240
at horror nights.

1357
01:04:53,240 --> 01:04:56,560
It is surprising to me it would be it's taken this long to like just get

1358
01:04:56,560 --> 01:05:00,440
something like kind of scary into one of the parks, like at a high level,

1359
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:02,440
not like just a walk through maze.

1360
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:05,640
But you would think, yeah, that's so much of their business that.

1361
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:07,360
Yeah. So that that's good.

1362
01:05:07,360 --> 01:05:09,320
Like, let's do that. That's fun.

1363
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:12,440
They should. They also a plus up I have already.

1364
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:15,120
Throw the Munsters house on that place.

1365
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:17,040
Yeah. In that area, too.

1366
01:05:17,040 --> 01:05:18,680
Absolutely. That would be great.

1367
01:05:18,680 --> 01:05:20,440
I have a fun one. Scary one.

1368
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:23,440
Bachelor pad have his first beer with him.

1369
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:28,040
Yeah. And it's you can get a big sandwich there, too, like Dagwood.

1370
01:05:28,840 --> 01:05:32,040
Oh, well, I mean, Dagwood should be in every park.

1371
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:34,840
Yeah, there should be a whole Dagwood land.

1372
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:36,640
You're all this thing epic.

1373
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:40,280
And it's not even you can't even buy one lousy Dagwood in here.

1374
01:05:41,160 --> 01:05:43,560
Well, there's still as we said, there's there's room for expansion.

1375
01:05:43,560 --> 01:05:48,040
So maybe the Blondie expansion will happen in a couple of years.

1376
01:05:48,280 --> 01:05:53,200
Well, I mean, will Disney, though, fight this now that they own

1377
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:57,280
the rights to 20 20th Century Fox's epic

1378
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:02,080
featuring Nimgaloo, our beloved character, Nimgaloo.

1379
01:06:02,080 --> 01:06:04,280
I wanted to be Nimgaloo.

1380
01:06:04,280 --> 01:06:07,160
I can't even wish I forget how much we've

1381
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:10,320
did we have people have people seen the video.

1382
01:06:10,320 --> 01:06:11,800
Did we play the video?

1383
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:13,640
I think people are talking about it.

1384
01:06:13,640 --> 01:06:15,320
Yeah, I felt a little bit of resonating.

1385
01:06:15,320 --> 01:06:17,440
We tweeted people know about Nimgaloo.

1386
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:24,000
Nimgaloo, Nimgaloo, who talks to like some snails, eyes bang together.

1387
01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:25,240
Uh huh.

1388
01:06:25,640 --> 01:06:26,760
It's something like here.

1389
01:06:26,760 --> 01:06:28,360
Anything's possible.

1390
01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:30,680
Anything you can imagine is possible.

1391
01:06:30,680 --> 01:06:33,800
And then they make a silly face and go, even this.

1392
01:06:34,080 --> 01:06:36,680
He says, yes, even this.

1393
01:06:36,680 --> 01:06:38,320
They make a sillier face.

1394
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:42,400
Yes. It's a real it's a remarkable scene.

1395
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:46,240
And then he does like, and you know, I had to do a song for this movie.

1396
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:51,320
Let's get a bit of a diva diva diva diva diva diva diva diva diva diva diva.

1397
01:06:51,320 --> 01:06:53,080
My name is Galu.

1398
01:06:53,080 --> 01:06:54,680
Is Nimgaloo in the song?

1399
01:06:54,680 --> 01:06:56,160
I don't I'm not sure about that.

1400
01:06:56,160 --> 01:06:57,120
We've got to look that up.

1401
01:06:57,120 --> 01:06:58,240
Yeah, we'll do a whole name.

1402
01:06:58,240 --> 01:07:01,720
Galu, I think they were character episode, the Tyler.

1403
01:07:02,040 --> 01:07:05,520
That's another we've been talking a lot about these voices like, yeah,

1404
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:09,600
the acting voice of Steven Tyler, right?

1405
01:07:09,600 --> 01:07:13,400
Who I guess was on The Simpsons, but playing the less challenging role

1406
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:15,600
of Steven Tyler.

1407
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:16,280
Yeah.

1408
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:17,200
Hmm.

1409
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:20,520
Well, maybe, yeah, maybe if did if you were Jason's proposing

1410
01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:24,880
that Disney will fight back with its own epic expansion, literally epic,

1411
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:30,000
the movie that will be more Steven Tyler acting and much more Nimgaloo.

1412
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:34,080
Is there a way that they can like put a really tiny

1413
01:07:34,640 --> 01:07:38,920
semicolon or something in there to make it epic universe?

1414
01:07:39,320 --> 01:07:43,280
And then they technically like built they build that name first.

1415
01:07:43,960 --> 01:07:47,720
Like it's is that little colon is the key to separating it.

1416
01:07:47,720 --> 01:07:49,520
That would be they should do that.

1417
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:51,920
We'll give you the Marvel characters back.

1418
01:07:51,960 --> 01:07:54,520
OK, you can doom in Orlando.

1419
01:07:54,520 --> 01:07:56,760
Just let us have a Nimgaloo.

1420
01:07:58,920 --> 01:08:01,080
Let us have this company.

1421
01:08:01,080 --> 01:08:03,240
Fantastic piece, three, eight shit.

1422
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:05,160
That's the thing.

1423
01:08:05,160 --> 01:08:07,360
Maybe it maybe that's with how to train your dragon.

1424
01:08:07,360 --> 01:08:08,600
It's like it was consistent.

1425
01:08:08,600 --> 01:08:10,680
It was solid. It was well reviewed.

1426
01:08:10,680 --> 01:08:13,640
It it doesn't have like the baggage of like

1427
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:19,040
secret life of pets to or crimes of Grindelwald, where it's like, oh, no.

1428
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:22,840
That's right. You're saying the perception is actually important.

1429
01:08:22,840 --> 01:08:26,040
I'm just going all this with three movies that we liked and not like, oh, no,

1430
01:08:26,040 --> 01:08:28,040
that thing, that thing ain't shit.

1431
01:08:28,040 --> 01:08:31,640
Yeah. I mean, it's like that rumor that was going around a few years ago.

1432
01:08:31,680 --> 01:08:34,880
It's probably a Jim Hill thing or a guest on his podcast said like

1433
01:08:36,160 --> 01:08:38,000
people like Shrek.

1434
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,760
People fondly think of Shrek and the Shrek universe.

1435
01:08:40,800 --> 01:08:44,880
Yeah, they do not necessarily want any more of this current run of Shrek.

1436
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:46,360
Well, that is for sure.

1437
01:08:46,360 --> 01:08:48,680
I mean, there's going to be new Shrek movies for sure.

1438
01:08:48,720 --> 01:08:49,920
They got to spice them up.

1439
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:52,400
They got to redesign them.

1440
01:08:52,400 --> 01:08:56,440
We well, the rumor I think was live act like Disney live action Shrek

1441
01:08:56,680 --> 01:08:58,320
with CGI Shrek.

1442
01:08:58,320 --> 01:09:00,840
That's what I heard. At least really different, though.

1443
01:09:00,840 --> 01:09:03,840
It's barely different, but they'll have like real humans.

1444
01:09:03,840 --> 01:09:06,880
Maybe Farquaad could be played by a real man.

1445
01:09:07,720 --> 01:09:09,320
Yeah, that's right.

1446
01:09:09,320 --> 01:09:12,000
And then like it's in a lot of prosthetics.

1447
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:16,480
Yeah. And then the same voices for Shrek and Fiona and Donkey.

1448
01:09:16,680 --> 01:09:19,480
Sure. Malibu Stacey has a new hat.

1449
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:22,640
Yeah, they would keep all the same people.

1450
01:09:22,840 --> 01:09:24,800
That's what I've heard. I mean, this is a real.

1451
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:25,600
This hasn't been been.

1452
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:29,400
There was also rumors that one of these worlds was going to be the swamp

1453
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:30,200
was going to be Shrek's.

1454
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:31,680
Well, the swamp real quick.

1455
01:09:31,680 --> 01:09:34,840
We'll talk about some rumors I've heard over the years was there was going to be a full

1456
01:09:35,080 --> 01:09:39,360
one of the hubs was going to be Shrek and it was going to be a take on Disney.

1457
01:09:39,360 --> 01:09:42,000
So you'd walk down like a weird main street, but it was Shrek.

1458
01:09:42,320 --> 01:09:44,360
So it was a little bit

1459
01:09:44,360 --> 01:09:48,400
a little ribald, a little ribald, a little bit irreverent, you know.

1460
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:53,360
They would have dared to make a joke about it's a small world being an annoying.

1461
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:56,080
We went there.

1462
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:59,000
Yeah. Edgy. That's if the park was edgy.

1463
01:09:59,240 --> 01:10:01,080
Yeah. Yeah.

1464
01:10:01,080 --> 01:10:03,840
But I mean, maybe one of the extra lands will be edgier.

1465
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:09,080
Other rumors, Jurassic World, which we don't see any evidence of that.

1466
01:10:09,560 --> 01:10:12,240
So maybe they will just totally because for a while it was like,

1467
01:10:12,240 --> 01:10:15,240
maybe they'll just do Jurassic Park and Jurassic World in two different parks.

1468
01:10:15,560 --> 01:10:18,840
And there's the rumor that the second gate to begin with was going to be all

1469
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:20,560
Jurassic Park. Yeah.

1470
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:23,240
It was an interesting alternate universe, but probably would have been limited.

1471
01:10:23,240 --> 01:10:25,680
I think it's probably worked out that it's one of five.

1472
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:28,520
And yeah, that would have been interesting.

1473
01:10:28,520 --> 01:10:32,400
But yeah, I don't know how long that would have how long that would have sustained.

1474
01:10:32,600 --> 01:10:35,880
Yeah. Rumors of Star Trek land.

1475
01:10:36,160 --> 01:10:40,360
Yeah. But I think they don't like that's still paramount.

1476
01:10:40,360 --> 01:10:43,320
So I don't know if you know, well, no, Universal doesn't own Nintendo

1477
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:44,840
and doesn't own Harry Potter.

1478
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:46,360
So they're still working with things.

1479
01:10:46,360 --> 01:10:50,800
I think when they partner with people, they want to make sure it's safe bets.

1480
01:10:51,200 --> 01:10:55,720
Like Harry Potter or Nintendo after Picard comes out and it's a smash.

1481
01:10:55,800 --> 01:10:57,920
Then maybe we'll see a Picard land.

1482
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:01,800
Did you guys see the wine, the official Picard wine? No, but I will.

1483
01:11:02,120 --> 01:11:04,640
I will have a really. Yeah, I am excited.

1484
01:11:06,240 --> 01:11:09,600
I think a red a red and white ones is Infidel.

1485
01:11:10,040 --> 01:11:12,560
I love that. The other is a Bordeaux.

1486
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:15,840
Oh, because Picard has been now on his winery for 20 years.

1487
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:16,680
That's the premise of the show.

1488
01:11:16,680 --> 01:11:17,880
Something bad happened.

1489
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:22,720
And he went back to France where he has his winery, where he and that's

1490
01:11:22,720 --> 01:11:23,520
that's in canon.

1491
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:26,560
He fought with his brother at the winery on Next Generation

1492
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:29,120
in one of the early seasons.

1493
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:32,600
So I thought the show was about boring spaceships or something.

1494
01:11:32,600 --> 01:11:36,160
Now that I know it's about it's about property disputes on wineries.

1495
01:11:36,280 --> 01:11:40,080
Yeah, I think they like literally were in the mud in front of the grapes.

1496
01:11:40,280 --> 01:11:41,520
I believe on the episode.

1497
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:45,520
Oh, boy. Star Trek, as I said, I think there is an in for you somewhere

1498
01:11:45,680 --> 01:11:49,240
because of how old TV it is. Next Gen specifically.

1499
01:11:49,400 --> 01:11:53,080
Yeah, there's some old TV and like good boring stuff on it.

1500
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:55,480
Yeah, I know. There's got to be there's got to be an angle.

1501
01:11:55,480 --> 01:11:56,960
I'd like to figure it out. An alien.

1502
01:11:56,960 --> 01:11:57,840
So, yeah, put heart.

1503
01:11:57,840 --> 01:11:58,960
Maybe that will be the land.

1504
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:00,440
It'll just be a big winery.

1505
01:12:00,440 --> 01:12:03,800
Wine always a good wine's been my in for scary roller coasters.

1506
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:06,080
So it might be my in for the show.

1507
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:08,360
Cool bottles. Whoa, it is.

1508
01:12:08,360 --> 01:12:12,800
Oh, yeah. Well, I mean, more so the red on the left.

1509
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:17,640
If that is a red jeez, that's a that's a space angled bottle.

1510
01:12:17,640 --> 01:12:19,920
That's cool. I think it's made by a company called

1511
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:23,160
is it called Rockstar Wines?

1512
01:12:23,160 --> 01:12:24,520
Is that what it's called?

1513
01:12:24,520 --> 01:12:26,360
Yeah, stock sinking fast.

1514
01:12:27,160 --> 01:12:30,680
But we'll try to get a hold of of those.

1515
01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:33,400
Yeah, we'll review that on the show.

1516
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:35,840
Total totally bad ass wine.

1517
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:39,360
Lord of the Rings rumored.

1518
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:40,520
Yeah, for a long time.

1519
01:12:40,520 --> 01:12:43,680
Not sure that they've worked even the deal out with having the rights to that.

1520
01:12:43,680 --> 01:12:46,000
But there's a big Amazon, like

1521
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:49,600
five hundred million dollar TV show Lord of the Rings coming.

1522
01:12:50,040 --> 01:12:52,440
So you would think that might end up somewhere.

1523
01:12:52,440 --> 01:12:54,400
Your questions are finally answered.

1524
01:12:54,440 --> 01:12:58,520
Yeah, we had a lot of questions after with the three Hobbits,

1525
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:02,560
three Hobbits, three Lord of the Rings with extended editions.

1526
01:13:02,600 --> 01:13:03,160
Four books.

1527
01:13:03,160 --> 01:13:04,840
That's the scenario.

1528
01:13:04,840 --> 01:13:07,400
Yeah. Now we're getting like 60 episodes of television.

1529
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:09,120
It's not like that. Something crazy.

1530
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:10,760
It's not good. Oh, really?

1531
01:13:10,760 --> 01:13:15,480
Oh, well, well, that was I've only heard that replacing Marvel Superhero Island.

1532
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:18,040
It's a really Jim Hillie rumor.

1533
01:13:18,040 --> 01:13:19,200
That's a Jim Hill rumor.

1534
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:22,560
And he's heard him say it multiple times is that they'll re theme

1535
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:25,280
the whole coaster to the Wicked Witch coaster.

1536
01:13:25,880 --> 01:13:29,400
Seems a bit implausible to me because it's green.

1537
01:13:29,440 --> 01:13:31,080
I guess because it's green.

1538
01:13:31,080 --> 01:13:33,040
Yeah. Well, you would have to paint.

1539
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:35,840
And they're supposed the Wicked Movie eventually is coming.

1540
01:13:36,160 --> 01:13:36,640
I don't know when.

1541
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:42,040
So you're in a the canon that transformed her into a witch.

1542
01:13:42,160 --> 01:13:43,200
I guess. Yeah.

1543
01:13:43,200 --> 01:13:46,360
So when you would be transformed into the Hulk, you'd be transformed into the Wicked

1544
01:13:46,360 --> 01:13:48,160
Witch. Maybe that's what it is.

1545
01:13:48,920 --> 01:13:53,480
Which would feel like you're shot out of a cannon.

1546
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:54,320
Yeah. Yeah.

1547
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:55,560
If riding around on a road.

1548
01:13:55,560 --> 01:13:56,640
That's it. Exactly.

1549
01:13:58,040 --> 01:14:01,400
So you take the Hulk's head off and you put the witch on in the statue

1550
01:14:01,400 --> 01:14:02,600
below the coaster.

1551
01:14:03,280 --> 01:14:05,400
And then Spider-Man, I don't know what you do to it.

1552
01:14:05,680 --> 01:14:08,040
Dr. Glinda's fear fall.

1553
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:10,200
Dr. Glinda's fear fall.

1554
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:15,200
I mean, Lord and Lord of the Rings and all rumor to replace every island.

1555
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:16,400
I think. Yeah.

1556
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:17,840
Hold on. I have one more joke.

1557
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:19,120
Sorry. Wicked and Marvel.

1558
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:23,040
They all come out on ATVs every 45 minutes.

1559
01:14:23,800 --> 01:14:25,760
Which and. Well, he got the ATVs.

1560
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:30,240
Yeah, they repaint them green and they all come out in ATVs every 45 minutes.

1561
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:34,720
Yeah. And also, well, and the other rumor that is not for this one, but is

1562
01:14:35,480 --> 01:14:38,800
Zelda replacing Lost Continent.

1563
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:42,560
Yes. So there's more Nintendo on the way potentially.

1564
01:14:42,840 --> 01:14:45,760
OK. So that's what we know now.

1565
01:14:46,120 --> 01:14:47,800
That's what we know to speculate.

1566
01:14:47,800 --> 01:14:49,720
It's fun to imagine.

1567
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:53,840
The one question I have and I saw this a couple of days ago and I swear

1568
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:56,000
I booked Mark the tweet and I could not find it.

1569
01:14:56,960 --> 01:15:01,640
If anyone who is looking at the logo for Epic Universe can tell me,

1570
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,680
tweet at me, what is this thing called?

1571
01:15:04,680 --> 01:15:05,960
It's a star finder.

1572
01:15:05,960 --> 01:15:07,720
It's a navigational tool.

1573
01:15:07,720 --> 01:15:08,360
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

1574
01:15:08,360 --> 01:15:11,200
Is it like a centuries old navigational tool?

1575
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:13,160
It's not a compass, not a compass.

1576
01:15:13,160 --> 01:15:15,680
OK. It's kind of like a compass.

1577
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:17,720
Not a compass or a compass.

1578
01:15:17,720 --> 01:15:18,680
OK. Neither of them.

1579
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:19,680
All right.

1580
01:15:19,680 --> 01:15:22,160
Well, I've been trying to be better.

1581
01:15:22,160 --> 01:15:23,520
I've let like two mispronunciations go.

1582
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:25,440
I know it'll go lately too.

1583
01:15:25,440 --> 01:15:28,120
It's fine. It's the three of us and I feel like it wouldn't derail.

1584
01:15:28,760 --> 01:15:30,720
No, no, it's fine.

1585
01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:35,720
Now I've got to go back and listen to see all these ones you let go.

1586
01:15:35,720 --> 01:15:36,920
No, I don't even remember them.

1587
01:15:36,920 --> 01:15:38,880
Can you spot them? Yes.

1588
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:41,320
Yeah. If someone could tell me what that's called, because I had it

1589
01:15:41,320 --> 01:15:44,000
a few days ago and I cannot find out what the name is.

1590
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:45,160
Chloe Goldring.

1591
01:15:45,160 --> 01:15:46,000
Chloe Goldring.

1592
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,960
Ball. Gold ball.

1593
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:54,920
So, yeah, that's your in depth analysis of no information.

1594
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:58,080
One picture and the information.

1595
01:15:58,080 --> 01:16:03,240
Thing to do on a podcast and the information, all that we sort of knew already.

1596
01:16:03,240 --> 01:16:06,920
And you could have found easily three weeks ago on various websites.

1597
01:16:07,040 --> 01:16:08,880
I do think that people are not.

1598
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:10,360
I mean, I'm one of the hosts.

1599
01:16:10,360 --> 01:16:12,040
I wasn't looking at these rumors.

1600
01:16:12,040 --> 01:16:12,520
That's true.

1601
01:16:12,520 --> 01:16:16,280
So at least some people won't be disappointed by the information they already know.

1602
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:18,760
I was surprised by all of it today.

1603
01:16:18,760 --> 01:16:19,400
That's good.

1604
01:16:19,400 --> 01:16:23,000
This has taught me a lesson, which is don't prepare ever.

1605
01:16:23,160 --> 01:16:24,680
Yeah, it does. It doesn't matter.

1606
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:26,960
Honestly, the quality of the show probably doesn't suffer at all.

1607
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:29,080
If any of us are prepared or not.

1608
01:16:29,080 --> 01:16:30,040
I don't think so either.

1609
01:16:30,040 --> 01:16:32,920
Because people like when we, you know, go on tangents and do, you know,

1610
01:16:33,720 --> 01:16:37,880
the comedy bits and I end up stressing about like,

1611
01:16:37,880 --> 01:16:41,680
well, I need to make sure I know when the when they went to the council

1612
01:16:41,680 --> 01:16:44,440
to get the proper zoning in 1962.

1613
01:16:44,520 --> 01:16:47,120
So far, people are like, oh, this episode's real dry.

1614
01:16:47,320 --> 01:16:49,600
Oh, man, Jason said compass again.

1615
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:51,000
Hell, yeah, this is funny.

1616
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:51,400
They're good.

1617
01:16:51,400 --> 01:16:52,200
His ass.

1618
01:16:52,200 --> 01:16:52,720
Get him.

1619
01:16:53,880 --> 01:16:55,040
Maybe the one thing.

1620
01:16:55,040 --> 01:16:56,000
And then they'll talk to me.

1621
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:59,440
If they do have a friend that listens, which they don't, they'll say.

1622
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:00,840
And that's not a slight against them.

1623
01:17:00,840 --> 01:17:04,280
I'm just saying how would there be no way that multiple people subscribe

1624
01:17:04,280 --> 01:17:06,400
to this Patreon, right, that know each other?

1625
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:06,960
Yeah.

1626
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:10,360
For from separate means and then talk to each other about it.

1627
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:13,880
And sanity, if you subscribe to the Patreon, obviously you're very shameful,

1628
01:17:13,880 --> 01:17:16,240
shame, shameful feeling about it.

1629
01:17:16,840 --> 01:17:17,920
Every time that five dollars.

1630
01:17:17,920 --> 01:17:18,840
Are you?

1631
01:17:18,840 --> 01:17:21,160
What I'm just saying, you know,

1632
01:17:21,160 --> 01:17:23,520
oh, I'm paid another five dollars to hear these idiots.

1633
01:17:24,040 --> 01:17:26,440
But now that they know that they're

1634
01:17:26,440 --> 01:17:29,640
they're helping us get in on the ground floor of the future of entertainment.

1635
01:17:29,640 --> 01:17:31,320
Yeah, would be. Yeah.

1636
01:17:31,320 --> 01:17:32,280
Right. Yes.

1637
01:17:32,280 --> 01:17:36,440
So, yeah, they're helping the we're going to be the next Richard Branson's.

1638
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:37,280
Mm hmm.

1639
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:40,880
Off of our Quibi earnings.

1640
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:42,400
And we're going to be so much better.

1641
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:45,640
We're not going to pick up a woman or whatever it was.

1642
01:17:45,640 --> 01:17:48,400
I was actually about to pledge that in five years we will pick up

1643
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:50,160
a lot of women at press events.

1644
01:17:50,160 --> 01:17:52,600
So I was going to go the other way with it.

1645
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:54,240
I'll stick to desserts.

1646
01:17:54,240 --> 01:17:56,000
Thank you very much.

1647
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,120
Google Jason Sheridan picking up desserts.

1648
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:02,600
Fifty different things of you like holding a dessert.

1649
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:04,720
The dessert seems like it doesn't want to be picked up,

1650
01:18:04,760 --> 01:18:07,200
but you're holding it over your head on a plate.

1651
01:18:07,200 --> 01:18:09,360
I wouldn't seem like it. It's melting.

1652
01:18:09,360 --> 01:18:11,920
Yeah, it's trying to escape from the bowl. Right.

1653
01:18:12,200 --> 01:18:14,120
Well, because it doesn't want to get eaten.

1654
01:18:14,120 --> 01:18:15,880
Yeah, that's true. But too bad.

1655
01:18:15,880 --> 01:18:18,360
Don't make this nice new park tawdry.

1656
01:18:22,600 --> 01:18:25,480
I don't know that we really tawdried it up that bad, but

1657
01:18:26,320 --> 01:18:30,400
I do by saying that ice cream will be melted or wasted.

1658
01:18:30,760 --> 01:18:32,680
My love of ice cream is pure.

1659
01:18:32,720 --> 01:18:36,200
Yeah. Well, we'll do a full another speculation episode about like

1660
01:18:36,200 --> 01:18:40,120
what types of ice cream each land will have. Oh, green.

1661
01:18:40,120 --> 01:18:42,960
You know, flavor dragon berry ice cream.

1662
01:18:43,440 --> 01:18:47,520
Oh, oh, tour or berry ice torch cone torch.

1663
01:18:48,440 --> 01:18:52,360
Orange cream, orange cream and a black black or brown

1664
01:18:52,360 --> 01:18:55,600
cone, darker brown little strawberry drizzle like blood.

1665
01:18:56,200 --> 01:18:58,240
Yeah, that's good.

1666
01:18:58,240 --> 01:19:01,640
And Frankenstein sees that and is like fire. Good.

1667
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:04,160
I think we can't top that.

1668
01:19:04,160 --> 01:19:05,320
Let's get out of here now.

1669
01:19:05,320 --> 01:19:09,400
And that's so folks at the universe.
