Thank you.

19
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:52,040
Thank you.

20
00:08:52,040 --> 00:09:05,560
Thank you.

21
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:22,360
Thank you.

22
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:35,880
Thank you.

23
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:52,680
Thank you.

24
00:09:52,680 --> 00:10:06,200
Thank you.

25
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:23,000

Thank you.

29
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:23,640
Thank you.

30
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:37,160
Thank you.

31
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:51,960
Thank you.

32
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:58,760
Thank you.

33
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:07,480
Thank you.

34
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:15,400
Thank you.

35
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:28,920
Thank you.

36
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:42,440
Thank you.

37
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:55,960
Thank you.

38
00:12:55,960 --> 00:13:07,960
Thank you.

39
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:15,480
Thank you.

40
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:23,480
Thank you.

41
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:31,480
Thank you.

42
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:39,000
Thank you.

43
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Thank you.

44
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Thank you.

45
00:13:51,000 --> 00:14:02,520
Thank you.

46
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:08,520
Thank you.

47
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:12,520
Thank you.

48
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:16,520
Thank you.

49
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:23,240
Thank you.

50
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:26,040
Thank you.

51
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:30,040
Thank you.

52
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:34,040
Thank you!

53
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:42,920
Thank you!

54
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:45,320
You'll get a gist of sort of Gramps' mood.

55
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,820
Oh, Gramps, isn't it wonderful?

56
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,820
Isn't it beautiful?

57
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:51,320
To waste the time and money.

58
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,320
Come on, Gramps, I want to see everything.

59
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,320
You've seen enough. You've seen one for you, you've seen them all.

60
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,320
I didn't want to come here in the first place.

61
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,320
Sorry, I let you kids drive me into it.

62
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,320
Now let's get going.

63
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,320
I've already missed a half-day's business.

64
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,320
I'm sorry.

65
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,320
Missed a half-day's business.

66
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,320
We just got here, and you promised us a good time.

67
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,320
A good time? I'll tell you what a good time is.

68
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,320
A good time is worth earning money,

69
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:18,320
not running around some park laughing and singing.

70
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,320
So, Gramps is just a real pain in the ass.

71
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,320
He talks about he missed a half-day of business,

72
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,320
he doesn't specify what the business is.

73
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,320
It's just that he, you know,

74
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,320
he loves earning money and that's it, and no fun.

75
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:37,320
And today, in 2017, he could be checking stocks or trading or whatever from the park.

76
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,320
But this was not the case at the time.

77
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:44,320
Right, you have to, he's like, I hate fun, I hate sunshine, and pollution is good.

78
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,320
Like, this is Graham Gramps.

79
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,320
I am the stereotypical angry man.

80
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:57,320
He didn't even have an internet cafe brought to you by Treasure Planet to go check his email at.

81
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,320
That is made up, but could also be real.

82
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:02,320
Again, I thought that was real, possibly in whatever special you're going to be talking about.

83
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,320
There was definitely internet cafes at the...

84
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:10,320
InnoVentions must have had like previews of Prodigy or whatever in 1997.

85
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:16,320
In the Dudley Do Right episode, I talked about the store that briefly sold

86
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:22,320
Rocky and Bullwinkle merchandise very quickly morphed into an internet cafe.

87
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,320
Internet cafe?

88
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:26,320
But our old, yeah, Gramps didn't have this at the time.

89
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:30,320
Right, and this is, by the way, they've also been in the park for maybe under an hour.

90
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,320
Yeah, they're like outside, they haven't even been in there.

91
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,320
It's like outside, it's at the main gate.

92
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:39,320
Well, they go in a little bit and then they just come out and it's like under an hour and it's like,

93
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,320
I don't know, Gramps is really being a dick.

94
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,320
Like, he could have given it a couple hours.

95
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,320
It doesn't make any sense.

96
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,320
They didn't go on a ride.

97
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,320
He's just like, no, we're not doing this.

98
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:51,320
Gramps should have loved that part of the park because it's an old timey town.

99
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,320
Like, he probably grew up in it.

100
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,320
What the hell, Gramps?

101
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,320
I know.

102
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,320
So, okay, Gramps tries to leave.

103
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,320
He tries to take the kids out, which, God, he's just a big pain in the ass.

104
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:02,320
Hope you had a good time with us today at Disneyland.

105
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,320
It was fine, everything was fine, just fine.

106
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,320
Give my regards to Mickey Mouse.

107
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:07,320
Tell me there's a nice place there.

108
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:08,320
Goodbye.

109
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,320
Well, what about your kids, did you enjoy it?

110
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:13,320
I'm sure you would have loved it if we got to see it.

111
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,320
But Gramps wouldn't let us.

112
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:17,320
He doesn't believe in having a good time.

113
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:20,320
I don't believe in your kind of good time.

114
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:23,320
While we're on the subject, I don't believe in Christmas either.

115
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:26,320
Or fairy tales, or talking mice, or dancing penguins.

116
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,320
Well, what do you believe in?

117
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,320
I believe in making money and minding my own business.

118
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,320
I wish more people would.

119
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,320
Goodbye.

120
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,320
Gee, do anything, miss, so that we can stay?

121
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,320
I'm sorry, there's nothing I can do.

122
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:42,320
It's a shame, too, but I have a feeling your grandfather would have won that prize money hands down.

123
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,320
Hands down.

124
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,320
What prize money?

125
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:49,320
Oh, no, they give a prize at Disneyland for the biggest disbeliever,

126
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:54,320
but you have to go before the head of the Department of Disbelief, you know, to see if you really qualify.

127
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:59,320
All right, so that's Sandy Duncan, another star of stage and screen.

128
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:03,320
She's writing a first draft script, apparently.

129
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:06,320
Just have the characters say what they think and want.

130
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,320
Say how they're different from each other.

131
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,320
Don't embed it into your exposition.

132
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:17,320
So Sandy Duncan shows up, but she's wearing that like mouseketeer, like, horse racing jockey outfit.

133
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:22,320
Oh, yes, the old tour guides had like this riding crop and jockey hat kind of.

134
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,320
They still kind of do.

135
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,320
Yeah, the VIP ones.

136
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,320
It's like a weird, I was thinking it's sort of a weird,

137
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:33,320
like the Playboy Mansion had the bunnies, like Walt must have had sort of a jockey fascination maybe.

138
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,320
Kind of a plaid thing.

139
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,320
He's a plaid man.

140
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,320
Scott style.

141
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,320
We'll get it.

142
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,320
You mean you, Scott style?

143
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,320
No, I didn't.

144
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,320
The Scotts style.

145
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:46,320
The Scotts people of Scotland.

146
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,320
Sure, sure.

147
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:50,320
Oh, no, oh, but I'm into the riding crop.

148
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,320
And you refer to it as Scott style.

149
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,320
Yeah, you want to do it Scott style?

150
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,320
Pick your tartan.

151
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,320
Pick your shade of plaid.

152
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,320
I'll tell you exactly where to aim.

153
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:06,320
All right, pretend that's the bullseye and my ass is Kissimmee St. Cloud.

154
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:11,320
By the way, I just Googled and it just seems like the tourism website now is just Kissimmee.

155
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,320
It seems like they changed the branding.

156
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,320
There is still like St. Cloud.

157
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,320
St. Cloud.

158
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:21,320
I think it was just like towns, like the twin cities or two cities next to each other.

159
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:25,320
Like it seems like it was just a couple of towns.

160
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,320
Is there a redistricting?

161
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,320
Jerrymandering.

162
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:30,320
Jerrymandering affected the Kissimmee St. Cloud tourism budget.

163
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,320
St. Cloud, hard Trump voters, Kissimmee.

164
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:39,320
After the Bush election in 2000 in Florida, I just think there's probably some funny business up down there.

165
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,320
Catherine Harris, right?

166
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,320
Yeah.

167
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,320
That was her.

168
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,320
Catherine Harris.

169
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:48,320
Another host of the Disney Parade, Catherine Harris.

170
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:53,320
So anyway, back to this unpleasant old man.

171
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:56,320
Wish he had a chance to vote for George W. Bush.

172
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,320
Probably didn't make it that long.

173
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:59,320
I don't think he did.

174
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,320
Sandy Duncan.

175
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:07,320
So she lies to the old man and says there's a disbeliever prize that they award to the biggest disbeliever at Disney.

176
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:10,320
And this guy falls hook, line and sinker for it.

177
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,320
Ironically believes.

178
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,320
Oh, sorry.

179
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,320
I'm getting ahead of myself.

180
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,320
Here are the titles.

181
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,320
We'll do this first.

182
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:59,320
That's that Mad Men era golden age of advertising.

183
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:03,320
You come up with slogans like kids love pudding.

184
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,320
It's a camera.

185
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:09,320
It's a done a Don Draper as a guy and episodes worth of angst and turmoil.

186
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:13,320
He had to go to Palm Springs and fuck some lady.

187
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:20,320
He got beat up in the dead left in the desert, had to walk back to town and came back to a meeting with kids like pudding.

188
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,320
No, kids love.

189
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:30,320
But if New York thinking it was just kids like pudding and then came back from his eyes, he would get pudding.

190
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,320
I realized something on my journey.

191
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:35,320
Post raisin brand to also a fun series.

192
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:38,320
I love post raisin brand and you love pudding.

193
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,320
I assume I do love pudding.

194
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:45,320
I would clarify myself as both a raisin brand man and a pudding man pudding boy.

195
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:50,320
Yes, I'm a raisin brand man and a pudding boy and a little pudding boy, a little pudding boy.

196
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,320
Very appropriate for Christmas.

197
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:54,320
You would have a glass of pudding every morning for breakfast.

198
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,320
Yeah.

199
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:00,320
Why does that feel so bad at the start of every school day?

200
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:10,320
Every Christmas morning, your parents kept up the tradition of foods that stopped existing after 1911.

201
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:15,320
Yeah, we exclusively ate food from Christmas songs.

202
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:19,320
Partridges, roasted partridges.

203
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:23,320
So they go underground and they meet Dr. Wunderbar.

204
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:31,320
And Dr. Wunderbar is also played by Art Carney and he looks like a Sid and Marty Croft style Albert Einstein character.

205
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:36,320
And they don't really address why he's there, but he's a kooky wizard and he has like a magic,

206
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:40,320
he keeps talking about his magical screen where he can see everything in the park.

207
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:46,320
And he's somehow in on this con immediately that they're fooling this old man and they tell him there's a list.

208
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:51,320
He has 10 things that he has, there's 10 things that he cannot do by the end of the day.

209
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:52,320
It's a little convoluted.

210
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,320
We're already in the world of disbeliever contest.

211
00:22:55,320 --> 00:23:04,320
Dr. Wunderbar was definitely gotten out of Germany by the OSS secretly to help us build rockets.

212
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:08,320
Oh yeah, he's too crazy for the German government, for the Disney corporation.

213
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,320
Too crazy for NASA, Disney picked him up.

214
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,320
Kissinger hired him.

215
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:15,320
He's a sleepy, kooky old Nazi, basically.

216
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:19,320
So like they go down and they see him and he's like, he's sleepy, they gotta wake him up and it's a whole thing.

217
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:29,320
Excuse me, Dr. Wunderbar, we thought your office was always open.

218
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,320
Office is always open, that is true.

219
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:34,320
It's never closed, day or night I'm on the job, wide awake and full of peps.

220
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,320
What can I do for you?

221
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:39,320
But there's never, they don't address who he is, why he's there.

222
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,320
He's not even a Disney character.

223
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:46,320
Like it would have made more sense if he was like, you know, a witch or like a fairy from, you know,

224
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,320
one of the fairies from Cinderella or something.

225
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:52,320
Just like David S. Pumpkins, he's not even from something.

226
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,320
Yeah.

227
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:57,320
I'm so in the woods with Dr. Wunderbar.

228
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:59,320
So they tell him there's 10 things that he cannot do.

229
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:03,320
As long as there's one thing that he doesn't do by the end of the day, he gets this prize.

230
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:10,320
So it's like, if he just believes somebody, that's taking off one of the items on the list.

231
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,320
So like just having faith in someone.

232
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:15,320
So he has faith in them by the end and they go, oh, you've done one of them.

233
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,320
And he's like, oh, you're tricking me or whatever.

234
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:19,320
But he has nine more to go.

235
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,320
So obviously it's a very convoluted.

236
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,320
I don't want to bog you down.

237
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:27,320
Just show me someone going on the Haunted Mansion and getting spooked.

238
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:29,320
That's all I want out of my specials.

239
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:31,320
Too much plot.

240
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,320
Too much plot.

241
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:36,320
Sandy Duncan then shrinks down and has a song and dance on Small World.

242
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,320
Not going to show it.

243
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,320
Not going to play any of it.

244
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,320
We're not going to.

245
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:41,320
You can have a fun time on Christmas.

246
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:54,320
Sandy Duncan also, by the way, we didn't explain Sandy Duncan, but she was like sort of, she's this like chipper, like 60s TV perennial, who I believe was Peter Pan in some prominent version of Peter Pan.

247
00:24:54,320 --> 00:25:04,320
She's the kind of person my mom grew up with and who I'm still disturbed by because my childhood had a lot of, I feel like I knew who all the Peter Pans were.

248
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:11,320
Like my mom, you got to, I have to teach my son about Sandy Duncan and Mary Martin and.

249
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:14,320
Pretty sure I got a lesson on Mary Martin and Sandy Duncan as well.

250
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:18,320
Just because there were TV personalities and TV was king.

251
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:29,320
I haven't, I have not been to therapy yet, but when it comes, I'm sure the first session will, I'll be getting a lot off my back about Sandy Duncan and Mary Martin.

252
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,320
That would mix me up as a child.

253
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:33,320
Sure.

254
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:39,320
So I spent a good amount of time talking to my therapist about the.

255
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:42,320
Okay, just like, like that they're great.

256
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:47,320
Usually positive, usually positive, but also to contextualize other stuff.

257
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:51,320
Your therapist is like a listener of this podcast, just hearing news.

258
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:54,320
So they're converting Paradise Pier into Pixar Pier.

259
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,320
Like no problem, no problem is being addressed.

260
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,320
How does that make you feel?

261
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,320
Great.

262
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,320
I'm very happy.

263
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,320
Hey, this was a fun session.

264
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,320
Here's $200.

265
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:06,320
So Mike, is that, is that all you have from this?

266
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:09,320
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, we still have the best part.

267
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:12,320
This is the first, we're still on the first special.

268
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,320
I don't have nearly this much.

269
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,320
My book report isn't as in depth.

270
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,320
So, so yeah, we're getting to the good stuff here, the real good stuff.

271
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:22,320
Art Carney is not the only angry man in this.

272
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:28,320
They meet up with Santa Claus played by Glen Campbell and Glen Campbell as Santa Claus is pissed.

273
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:31,320
What seems to be the trouble Santa?

274
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,320
Well, it's the elves.

275
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:36,320
They're just not putting out enough stuff this year.

276
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:40,320
I'm afraid there's going to be a lot of disappointed children this Christmas.

277
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,320
Good for them.

278
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:47,320
I saw Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs a while ago and they were busy.

279
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:49,320
I'm sure they'd love to pitch in.

280
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,320
Well, that would be nice.

281
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,320
I can certainly use all the help I can get.

282
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,320
Nope, they're not elves.

283
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,320
Doesn't count.

284
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,320
Meet you all at the workshop.

285
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:56,320
Okay.

286
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:00,320
And then he tells the kids that they're not going to get presents this year.

287
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,320
There's a good chance you guys won't get presents.

288
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,320
And then that makes Art Carney mad.

289
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:09,320
So they go and they recruit the Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs to just do free labor.

290
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:13,320
First of all, Santa's a real dick here, obviously, because he doesn't explain why the elves are making toys.

291
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:17,320
He's putting all of the onus on them for not actually making the toys.

292
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:20,320
Like there could have been a baby boom this year.

293
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,320
That's why there's more kids that need toys.

294
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,320
There should be some reason here.

295
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:32,320
So it's a classic like evil boss putting all of his problems on the workers and not taking any of the credit or the blame.

296
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:36,320
Being offered solutions but not pouncing on them.

297
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,320
Yeah, I think it's Santa.

298
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:40,320
The fish stinks from the head down and I think this is Santa's issue.

299
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,320
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

300
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:44,320
So we go and Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, they go help.

301
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:48,320
And this is all shot like on the Alice in Wonderland ride in a very strange way.

302
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:51,320
And there's just like, they set up a couple of shops.

303
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:54,320
They set up some tables where the elves are working.

304
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:58,320
And Snow White is singing about how good this is.

305
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:05,320
And you see like these lifeless elves and they're just like hammering at half speed.

306
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:09,320
And you're like, God, what happened to these poor motherfuckers?

307
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:11,320
And obviously it's like Santa's the problem.

308
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:15,320
So Snow White, they all go help, but it's not enough.

309
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:21,320
So who has a skill in this group that could help make this situation better?

310
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:23,320
It's clearly Gramps.

311
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:36,320
So basically Gramps' solution to this is saying hurry up to them.

312
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,320
And this works.

313
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:41,320
So he goes, I got an idea.

314
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:44,320
Hurry up. Hurry up.

315
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,320
Something Santa never thought to do.

316
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,320
Right. Santa never thought about this.

317
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,320
And then all of a sudden it was like, oh, we should hurry.

318
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,320
And they do. And then everything is fine.

319
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:57,320
And that was Gramps' contribution to this situation.

320
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,320
So he has helped.

321
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,320
Why does Disney have to be involved in Santa and making toys?

322
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:04,320
And how is this Disneyland's responsibility?

323
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,320
You know what? They don't really explain it.

324
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:10,320
They don't explain why Santa's workshop is set up in the middle of Fantasyland.

325
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,320
They don't really go into it.

326
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:14,320
I guess it adds up to the North Pole's kind of like Disneyland.

327
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,320
It's all just one stop shop.

328
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:21,320
So basically after this, then there's the saddest song, and this will be the last bit.

329
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:23,320
There's plenty more, but this will be the last bit.

330
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:29,320
Is that Gramps basically lets the kids know why he's so sad.

331
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:32,320
I know I've been dying to know.

332
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:37,320
I mean, he's very general, but there's actually some character work being done here is what I'm saying.

333
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:40,320
Oh, this is what Art Carney won the Oscar for.

334
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:44,320
You must learn never to trust anyone. You stick with me and I'll show you the ropes.

335
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:48,320
And you two get to be my age, you'd be glad you listen to me.

336
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:54,320
Also, these kids are the worst singers.

337
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,320
All kids are the worst singers.

338
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:01,320
I am your age, will life be sad?

339
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:05,320
Will I be grouchy? Will I be mad?

340
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:11,320
Will I be everyone who happens to come my way?

341
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:16,320
And will I say love's not what I need?

342
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,320
Love's not what I need.

343
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:23,320
What is happening? Why was he sad?

344
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:25,320
Hold on, hold on, we get to it.

345
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:29,320
Will I be joyful?

346
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:34,320
Or still believe in Santa Claus?

347
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:37,320
And all of the things he does?

348
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:40,320
I'll have when I go.

349
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:43,320
That I have never told.

350
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:48,320
There's nothing to believe anymore.

351
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,320
There's nothing to believe anymore?

352
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,320
When I'm your age.

353
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,320
When I'm your age.

354
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:55,320
Isn't it easy for me?

355
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,320
You think I enjoy the way I am?

356
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:01,320
I'm this way because of what happened to me many, many years ago.

357
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,320
You never told us that story, Gramps.

358
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:08,320
I never told anyone that story.

359
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:14,320
When I was your age, nobody cared.

360
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:17,320
Nobody helped me.

361
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:22,320
Nobody shared.

362
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:26,320
Not even a crust of bread.

363
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:29,320
Nobody said,

364
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:36,320
Don't cry, little boy, to my little boy.

365
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,320
When I was your age.

366
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,320
Alright, that's enough sadness.

367
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,320
Oh my God.

368
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:44,320
So this is, you will not find this in the last 25 years of Disney specials,

369
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:51,320
just bleak sadness, just a poor man who seems like he was an orphan as a boy.

370
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:56,320
We just set up a world where, boy, I wish the specials were the way they used to be.

371
00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:01,320
Then we listen to Art Carney moan about never having a crust of bread.

372
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:06,320
And today you would watch the Christmas parade, and it would be like Carrie Underwood saying,

373
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,320
Merry Christmas!

374
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:12,320
Now I'm questioning why we want things this way.

375
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,320
What's wrong with us?

376
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,320
Yeah, I don't know.

377
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,320
What does life mean?

378
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,320
There is no joy.

379
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:20,320
I guess I'm sad now that I'm old.

380
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:28,320
Hey, in the spirit of this special, my iPhone has like bricked in the middle of this.

381
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,320
What?

382
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:31,320
Hooked my iPhone up to my computer and it says,

383
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:33,320
We see your iPhones in recovery mode.

384
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:35,320
Reset the factory settings.

385
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,320
Everything's going wrong on this episode.

386
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:39,320
My pacemaker stopped working.

387
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:41,320
I'm dying.

388
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:44,320
It's all going to shit.

389
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:49,320
So this is 1976, and it was an exciting special.

390
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:53,320
At the end, he makes a wish, and then there's ice everywhere on Main Street,

391
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:57,320
and Mickey and Minnie go ice skating together.

392
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:59,320
And then it ends very nicely.

393
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:05,320
But this is a wacky, weird special, and it is not that way anymore.

394
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:07,320
Yeah, hey, it was a big swing.

395
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:14,320
I might declare it to be a miss from the brief moments that we've heard of it.

396
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,320
Oh my god.

397
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:17,320
What a, yeah.

398
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:19,320
This song is so sad.

399
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:23,320
It's just so sad, and it's crazy that they would allow it on...

400
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:29,320
Does he end up, what's the end of the arc of Mr. Gramps?

401
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:34,320
Gramps, at the end, he finally believes a little bit, and he gets presents finally.

402
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:37,320
The first time he ever, he mentions somewhere he's never gotten a present before,

403
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:40,320
which kind of doesn't make sense because he obviously has kids because he has grandkids,

404
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:44,320
so you would think somebody gave the old man a present at a certain point.

405
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:49,320
But he sees, he makes the wish for it to be like snow and be ice in Disneyland,

406
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:51,320
and they're like, we can't even do that.

407
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:54,320
And then Sandy Duncan's like, oh, maybe if we wish really hard,

408
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,320
and they of course wish really hard, and then it happens.

409
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,320
So he gets to see Mickey and Minnie ice skating,

410
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:01,320
which I guess was his dream as a child or something.

411
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:04,320
And then he gets presents from the characters.

412
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:07,320
When he watched them in cartoons, he's like, but I want to see him skate.

413
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:11,320
I bet someone's feeling about these two that he'd be good at skating.

414
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:16,320
When he would watch TV through a drug store window as a child

415
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,320
because he didn't have a home or a television.

416
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:22,320
Trying to spot on the shelves if they have bags of bread crust.

417
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,320
Just the crust.

418
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:25,320
Just the crust, please.

419
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:33,320
He'd go buy a bag of crust for four nickels, try to make it last a month.

420
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:35,320
I think, honestly, I think Gramps should come back,

421
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:37,320
played by a new actor in one of these specials,

422
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:39,320
but that's what I'll be pitching to Disney when I go in.

423
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:41,320
A character worth rebooting.

424
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,320
Christopher Plummer.

425
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,320
Sure.

426
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:47,320
Christopher Plummer is the new choice for replacing people

427
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:49,320
as old crusty guys in movies.

428
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,320
So Christopher Plummer is Gramps. I'm excited for it.

429
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:55,320
And he'll be great at singing this song, When I Was Your Age.

430
00:34:55,320 --> 00:35:01,320
I was sad. I was never happy. I was just, I was never glad.

431
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,320
Oh boy.

432
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,320
All right.

433
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,320
Well, that's our first miserable special.

434
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:09,320
Okay, here's what I will say about mine.

435
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:15,320
I don't have a ton of clips, and I don't have a clip of this song specifically,

436
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:19,320
but I'm going to talk about the Christmas at Walt Disney World 1978 special.

437
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:23,320
And the clips that I do have are more on the depressing end,

438
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:28,320
although not that depressing compared to the saga of Gramps.

439
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,320
But let me talk about this special a little bit.

440
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:34,320
Christmas at Walt Disney World 78, maybe the first Disney World Christmas special.

441
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:37,320
It includes appearances from Shields and Yarnell,

442
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:43,320
who are a mime troupe, a husband and wife mime troupe,

443
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:46,320
who are 70s variety show staples.

444
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:50,320
And most of the special is them, which I will not play for you,

445
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:54,320
because mimery is silent. It won't translate on a podcast.

446
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:58,320
But a lot of the special are these two mimes who are insanely creepy,

447
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:02,320
if you can imagine that, and them playing different characters.

448
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:08,320
You watch them go... They have sort of like that Blue Man group vibe,

449
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:13,320
where they're strange and inquisitive, and they don't know what these human things are.

450
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:16,320
So you watch them go from LAX to the Orlando airport,

451
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:21,320
and then the baggage comes out, and they crawl out of the baggage.

452
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:25,320
They got in the suitcase, because they're mime people.

453
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:28,320
They don't understand that you're supposed to sit on a seat, not be in a suitcase.

454
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,320
Doesn't that sound charming?

455
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:34,320
You want what I just said to play out over the course of seven minutes.

456
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:38,320
Is it called like the Click Clackers or something?

457
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,320
I don't know.

458
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:43,320
Is this the same... There's a special where like a robot couple goes...

459
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,320
Yes, this is the robot couple.

460
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:47,320
This is the robot couple.

461
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:51,320
They are similar to, although I would say less creepy than,

462
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:54,320
Bernadette Peters and Andy Kaufman in Heart Beeps.

463
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:57,320
But they probably get along with the Heart Beeps couple.

464
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:59,320
They could go on a double date with the Heart Beeps couple.

465
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:05,320
I think they might use all of their secret genital compartments to have a good old time.

466
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:11,320
There's also this sequence where, if that doesn't sound fun to you, a robot mime couple,

467
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:17,320
there's a very long sequence in which these two grown adult mimes are babies in the park.

468
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:24,320
In like respective blue and pink baby onesies, and they kind of crawl around.

469
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:30,320
I mean, as soon as I saw that beginning, I stopped watching, so I can't recap the man-baby part.

470
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:36,320
It is something that is clearly a mass of content that is only meant for fetishes.

471
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:39,320
Utterly disturbing.

472
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:46,320
So, and yet I claimed that this special was less depressing than what we were just talking about.

473
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,320
And here is why.

474
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:52,320
Because it contains one of my favorite sequences in any Disney special.

475
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,320
And you can look up just this part on YouTube.

476
00:37:54,320 --> 00:38:01,320
Please, just you at home, put in the phrase, Pablo Cruz rocks Disney's Discovery Island.

477
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:06,320
This is a delightful sequence in which the band, the 70s band Pablo Cruz,

478
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:14,320
performs their hit song, Worlds Away, and over at the Seven Seas Lagoon at Disney World.

479
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:18,320
Which, if you're not familiar with that, is the big lake that's outside of the Magic Kingdom

480
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:21,320
and surrounding the Polynesian contemporary hotels.

481
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:27,320
The thing you forget about old Disney World is that it was this like water sports outdoor destination when it opened.

482
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:29,320
Something that I think was a lot more important in the 70s.

483
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:32,320
Then, like they needed to have that as well as the theme parks.

484
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:35,320
So, you know, you had your golf courses and you also had boats and stuff.

485
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:41,320
And this music video lets you see Pablo Cruz trying out all the different types of water sports.

486
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:48,320
You're watching these cool mustachio dudes on catamarans and jet skis and paddle boats.

487
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:54,320
And it's all set to this song that's kind of like, I would describe it as a sub-Come Sail Away.

488
00:38:54,320 --> 00:39:02,320
It's sort of as the Odyssey aquatic vibe of Come Sail Away, except for way less interesting sections.

489
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:06,320
Like the solos are a lot more limited in their musical dexterity.

490
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:09,320
That being said, this sequence is so charming.

491
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:13,320
It's like, you know, there's split screens and the song is so,

492
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:19,320
The world's away and if you just if you if you look this one up and watch it,

493
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:24,320
just know that my like happy place, Scott Gardner's happy place in his head,

494
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:30,320
if I'm feeling low, I just imagine that I'm in the Pablo Cruz Rocks Discovery Island video.

495
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:33,320
Just catamaranin around with the bass player.

496
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:38,320
It's it's it's if you watch this sequence and you don't smile, there's something wrong with you.

497
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:43,320
There's a story in my family about one of the first times my parents went to Disney.

498
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:46,320
And I hope I haven't told this before.

499
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:51,320
But my parents rented a boat in the seven seas.

500
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:56,320
They rented two of those like putt putt boats where Mike, I know you've done this before.

501
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:04,320
It's just literally like there's a brake pedal and a gas pedal or or there might just be a gas pedal and you take your foot off.

502
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:07,320
It's like an idiot proof, like tiny little one or two person boat.

503
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:10,320
You can rent a variety of boats and take it around Bay Lake.

504
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:17,320
And yeah, so we would take out the little boats and yeah, you would drive it around the second to last time I was at Disney World.

505
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:22,320
I drove it around and tried to figure out if I could get out of the boat and get into river country.

506
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:25,320
But in water park. Yeah, because you can kind of see it.

507
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:29,320
I knew where it was. So we like pulled up and I was like, I mean, I'm look, I'm not a bad kid.

508
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:34,320
So I'm not going to get in trouble. But I was like, oh, here's where you would park and pop out.

509
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:39,320
And I think I could make it over into the abandoned water park if you were if I was a bad kid, which I'm not.

510
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:41,320
I'm a good boy. I'm a good, good kid.

511
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:44,320
So, yeah, so my parents rented two of those boats.

512
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:48,320
My dad in the middle of the lake ran out of gas. So he's just stranded.

513
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:52,320
My mom's like, all right, I'll go back to the dock and I'll get someone to come out.

514
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:54,320
So my dad's just sitting there in a boat.

515
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:59,320
And then one of the boats that take people to the Magic Kingdom started coming right at him.

516
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:06,320
And they they he's like, wait, like he's like, yeah, like, like, I don't have to.

517
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:10,320
I can't do anything. And they they realize it and like move out of the way.

518
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:12,320
But he's still they're still awake.

519
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:18,320
They're still like waves from the boat so that he gets like moored on the rocks.

520
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:24,320
So miserable. It's the 70s, probably in polyester.

521
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:31,320
Just miserable on the rocks waiting for a cast member in a different boat to come get his broken down boat.

522
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:37,320
And that always was so we so that's why we never when I came along, we never did any of those rentals.

523
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:39,320
Dark memories. Dark. Yeah.

524
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:44,320
It didn't go as smooth as Pablo Cruz's journey through the Seas Lagoon.

525
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:54,320
I'm just like, but your dad coincidentally is named Pablo Sheridan, correct? Yes. Pablo. Pablo Sheridan.

526
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:56,320
Old Pablo. Yeah.

527
00:41:56,320 --> 00:42:01,320
But so another thing about this music video is that in addition to the water sports stuff,

528
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:07,320
the band is performing the song next to like a little shipwreck set on the shores of Discovery Island.

529
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:10,320
And Discovery Island, we've talked about a tiny bit on the show.

530
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:17,320
It's this like abandoned former zoo that's an island within the Seven Seas Lagoon at Disney World.

531
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:20,320
And once they opened Animal Kingdom, they abandoned this.

532
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:27,320
They got they they stopped keeping tabs on this on this old zoo and thought that they cleared a lot of the animals out, but they did not.

533
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:35,320
There's still like some there was like some urban exploration thing where people found like weird like vulture eggs, like corners of these.

534
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:43,320
Anyway, what I'm getting at is like there's a part where a vulture features really heavily into the main shot of the singer of Pablo Cruz.

535
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:50,320
And you come out of it thinking like, oh, cool, I should go to this island, go pretend I'm a pirate and hang out with these vultures.

536
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:54,320
But like looking up the history of the vultures at Discovery Island in 1989,

537
00:42:54,320 --> 00:43:01,320
Disney was specifically sued by the state of Florida for their poor treatment of the vultures. Oh, the vulture.

538
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:05,320
Oh, no. Are you getting to the shed? Yeah. Yeah.

539
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:11,320
Apparently there was a time. Well, first of all, the vultures like attacked people like they attacked the other animals.

540
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:14,320
They were not kept in check by Disney.

541
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:23,320
And at one point it was discovered that there was a to the vultures were just being kept kind of unruly in a big shed and maybe not a big shed.

542
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:29,320
It might have been a small shed. And at one point there were 72 vultures all just kept in,

543
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:34,320
so it's like something you run into in Donkey Kong country.

544
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:42,320
That's like a boss level going into the old rusty shed of vultures and Donkey Kong having to punch them all out one at a time.

545
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:46,320
Unless the vultures were gold, unless it was a bonus level.

546
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:49,320
We were trying to collect them. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Now that I would like.

547
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:55,320
But just imagine opening that door, a door, a rusty shed full of vultures.

548
00:43:55,320 --> 00:44:05,320
Wait, but isn't the ending of that that that was just like a sheet metal like shed and there was a heat wave and the vultures just kind of cooked?

549
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:08,320
Oh, God. Oh, what? Jesus.

550
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:14,320
Didn't they have to pay a significant fine because of a bunch of cooked vultures?

551
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:19,320
Oh, Jesus Christ. Anyway. Oh, we're trying so hard to steer this out of misery.

552
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:22,320
It's the most wonderful time.

553
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:26,320
Vultures for cooking. Oh, no.

554
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:34,320
So but, you know, back in 78, the vultures were just a fun part of a Pablo Cruz music video.

555
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:41,320
And there were a lot of great songs in the 1978 Christmas at Disney World special, including one that is so notable.

556
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:45,320
A song sung by an old character actor named Avery Schreiber.

557
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:50,320
And he in this special exclusively plays one of Disney's great characters, Gepetto.

558
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:54,320
And I'm going to play a couple of clips of this this for you now.

559
00:44:54,320 --> 00:45:07,320
All right. So old Avery Schreiber as Gepetto is reminiscing on I think he's he's finished reading a letter from Pinocchio, who I guess is not coming home for the holidays to be with Gepetto.

560
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:11,320
Oh, Jesus. But it's still a very nice letter.

561
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:17,320
And it's making him look back fondly on happy Christmas memories with Pinocchio.

562
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:20,320
So that sets the stage for this.

563
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:27,320
He's still a my boy. Pinocchio's grown up. He moved to America, but he's still my boy.

564
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:32,320
That can it is now. What a crazy wooden puppet I make.

565
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:37,320
What a man he has turned into.

566
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:42,320
I remember Pinocchio when he was a little child.

567
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:47,320
What a wooden head he was. What a wooden head he was.

568
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:53,320
Every time I get a splinter at the work table here, I remember the time I gave him the only spanking I ever gave him.

569
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:57,320
This is going to hurt me more than it's going to hurt you.

570
00:45:57,320 --> 00:46:02,320
Boy, was I right.

571
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:14,320
It's also now can now we know that it wasn't just in theory that Gepetto had to raise Pinocchio like a baby. He like spanked him and punished him. And as we're about to learn, gave him a bath.

572
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:21,320
Say, do you remember the time that I gave a Pinocchio the first bath? Oh, was he scared? He was so frightened.

573
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:25,320
He's telling the story to a wooden horse, by the way.

574
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:29,320
Gepetto's just a crazy man in his work shed talking to inanimate objects.

575
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:33,320
What's a water? I put him in it. He floats.

576
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:42,320
Then I couldn't get him out. It's all soaked. He gets the wood inside of me gets twisted, gets warped.

577
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:49,320
It wasn't funny then. Now we can laugh about it.

578
00:46:49,320 --> 00:47:03,320
Here's a nice bit of education for the holiday boy. You know, forget about the story of Christ. This Christmas reflect on the story of Gepetto giving Pinocchio a bath and him warping.

579
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:09,320
This is this sounds like he's like like about to take a bunch of pills or they're on the way.

580
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:12,320
They're kicking in right now and he's having crazy false memories.

581
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:23,320
He's going to get in the tub with a toaster. I make my new son. This is a toaster. I'll just give this toaster a big hug and a bath.

582
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:31,320
Pre dates Disney's live action remakes. This Avery Shriver as a live action Pinocchio.

583
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:35,320
Yeah, you think that Lion King with Beyonce is going to be fun? Give me.

584
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:42,320
I want the full hour and a half tale of Pinocchio's first bath and first spanking.

585
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:47,320
Oh, ouch. It's at a splinter. But again, this would never fly.

586
00:47:47,320 --> 00:48:03,320
This stuff would never fly. Now they would never let a precious Disney property, a beloved character like Gepetto ramble on with like semi improvised stories that you've never seen in any actual Disney product.

587
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:08,320
Not a lot of spank Pinocchio. That's out. No. Yeah, yeah, that's that's problematic.

588
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:25,320
King is bad. Yeah, we don't get to hear about like, you know, like Lumiere having to like, you know, the first time as a candle, he had to take a shower and use a loofah, which was one of his friends.

589
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:41,320
Also an enchanted. If you're an enchanted washcloth in the in the castle, I guess you just have to know you would have to be used as a in a bath or shower situation for one of your friends.

590
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:47,320
You got to do your part. Darkest episode we've ever done. Does Pinocchio come back? He never comes back.

591
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:57,320
He shows up in a different plot unrelated to Gepetto in in Disney World. He's in Disney World, although and but Gepetto is back in Italy.

592
00:48:57,320 --> 00:49:05,320
Wait, wait, wait. But who's playing him in Disney World? I think one of those mimes. I think it's one of them mimes. Oh, jeez. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

593
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:12,320
Which also is a sequence not worth discussing watching this like creepy little bar, perhaps woman. It might be it might be a grown woman playing Pinocchio.

594
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:19,320
What is happening? I don't know. You know, now that we look at was this a not a correct idea to do here?

595
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:29,320
I'm sure I'll only make it worse by playing this bizarre song. Gepetto is so lonely for Christmas because Pinocchio isn't coming home that he decides to make a new friend for himself.

596
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:37,320
And we watch him pick up a full a complete puppet. We can see as he's picking it up and then he starts kind of pantomime banging it as if he's building a new one.

597
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:47,320
But we already saw the finished puppet he was picking up. And here we go. Today, I take some wood from an old tree.

598
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:58,320
Don't you worry, Christmas tree today, I try to make it company.

599
00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:09,320
Today, I try to make Gepetto's clone. What? Gepetto's clone, did he say? Gepetto's clone.

600
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:18,320
And let me skip ahead to what the hell he's talking about there. We, Aaron and I, my wife and I at home quite often, if one of us just like, hey, when is that happening?

601
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:31,320
We say today, then we there will always be a pause. We say today, today. He repeats that so many times in this song. Also, I love that Gepetto is just losing his mind whenever he's not singing.

602
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:37,320
It's just bizarre, unhinged cackling.

603
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:44,320
So so then let's cut to the end of the song. We get to see what puppet he's making. And I'll turn this to face you guys.

604
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:56,320
I give my love to you. I give my love to me. Oh my God.

605
00:50:56,320 --> 00:51:04,320
Fuck off. Oh my God. He's making a puppet of himself. He's dressed in the same little vest and same wig.

606
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:13,320
Gepetto just turned around revealing a puppet of himself. Oh my God. I give my love to me.

607
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:23,320
This is far more disturbing than the one I played. A crew got together and made the made this filmed it, built a set, built that puppet.

608
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:30,320
This was in a time. Now there's endless recorded media. There were only so many TV specials filmed in 1978.

609
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:38,320
And one of them, like 70 crusty guys had to get together and film Gepetto giving his love to a puppet of himself.

610
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:43,320
Let me ask a question. If you were to keep playing it, does he start kissing it? I believe so.

611
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:49,320
I'll just like oh yes immediately. He does. It took three seconds to tell that yes he kisses himself.

612
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:57,320
Is it one kiss or is it like he's making out with it? No, it's a sweet little kiss on the forehead. Oh, you look just like me.

613
00:51:57,320 --> 00:52:04,320
Oh my God. Oh my dream of me coming into the room, giving myself a big enough hug.

614
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:11,320
All right. The puppet Gepetto. This is a world of sin and it's time to clean this, cleanse the sinners.

615
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:15,320
From now on, Gepetto only have time for people who look like me.

616
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:20,320
The great cleansing will happen and only mustachioed old man will exist.

617
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:25,320
All right. The Gepetto puppet. We're going to the top of the clock tower.

618
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:30,320
Now you watch that to the door and I'm going to dish out the vengeance.

619
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:35,320
Anyone who's not an older man, they got to go.

620
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:38,320
You should have come home, Benokia. You should have come.

621
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:46,320
You could have stopped at this. One of the visits to old withering memory Gepetto.

622
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:53,320
Gepetto carved his own gun out of his workshop. Oh, hello gun.

623
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:56,320
I wish a gun to come to life.

624
00:52:56,320 --> 00:53:01,320
You are such a good gun. Oh my God. Is yours fun, Jason?

625
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:04,320
Yes, it is fun. Can we jump to one of mine?

626
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:07,320
Please, dear God, let's do it.

627
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:11,320
Sometimes you discover while making an episode you shouldn't have done this one.

628
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:16,320
All right. Like America coming out of the malaise that was the 1970s,

629
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:23,320
it's time to jump ahead to the go go 80s for the Disney very Merry Christmas parade in 1988.

630
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:29,320
Yeah, which I believe my family, I believe we had this probably taped off of TV

631
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:33,320
and I would watch this on repeat because a lot of it seemed very familiar to me.

632
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:41,320
So I want to start by just playing like the like the credit, the opening like here's who's here credit.

633
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:45,320
Because I could do a whole episode just on the credits of these parades.

634
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:48,320
Like I said earlier, they're like a perfect time capsule.

635
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:51,320
So exciting knowing which of your favorite stars are joining you.

636
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:54,320
Yeah. Christmas morning. Here we go.

637
00:53:54,320 --> 00:54:03,320
Walt Disney World holiday greetings to all of America, Canada, South America, Europe, Australia, the Far East and service men and women around the globe.

638
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:08,320
It's the annual Walt Disney World very merry Christmas parade.

639
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:17,320
Join our host, Joan London and Alan Thicke along with Regis Philbin right here at Walt Disney World in Florida and from Disneyland in California.

640
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:27,320
Join Sarah Purcell and Family Tie's Scott Valentine for all the holiday magic and fantasy of a coast to coast Disney Christmas extravaganza.

641
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:31,320
Share all the laughs and holiday cheer of a visit to Mickey's birthday land.

642
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:34,320
Celebrate Christmas Caribbean style with Minnie and all her friends.

643
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:40,320
Say hello to Oliver, Dodger and Francis and take a behind the scenes look at the making of Oliver and company.

644
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:46,320
Join Family Tie's Scott Valentine as he previews Disneyland's great new thrill ride Splash Mountain.

645
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:52,320
Catch a sneak peek at the movie magic coming soon to the Disney MGM Studios theme park.

646
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:55,320
All this and more is on its way.

647
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:58,320
OK, so a very exciting year for the Disney company.

648
00:54:58,320 --> 00:55:01,320
There's so much going on. It's the Disney Decade.

649
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:03,320
Splash Mountain is opening. Wow.

650
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:07,320
Mickey's birthday land, the predecessor to Toontown.

651
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:09,320
And Scott Valentine is there to cover it all.

652
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:12,320
And Scott Valentine is there. So Alan Thicke and Joan London.

653
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:13,320
Vibrant neon colors.

654
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:17,320
Regis Philbin, like we were saying earlier, Regis Philbin does man on the street in this.

655
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:22,320
And there is a point where he's just going down Main Street and he starts by like talking.

656
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:24,320
Where are you from? Are you having a good day?

657
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:30,320
Like asking everyone where they're from and like at a certain point realizes, oh, this is going to take too long.

658
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:33,320
And he just starts shouting at people. Where are you from? New Jersey.

659
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:35,320
Where are you from? Canada.

660
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:39,320
Like it's just people going down, down the line.

661
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:41,320
So some of the stuff previewed in that.

662
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:44,320
And OK, the Caribbean Beach Resort.

663
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:47,320
This is a very special clip.

664
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:50,320
The Caribbean Beach Resort was new that year.

665
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:51,320
It was just opening.

666
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:55,320
Again, like I said, we had this special taped off TV when I was a kid.

667
00:55:55,320 --> 00:56:00,320
So the following is one of those things that is burned into my mind.

668
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:15,320
And I'll hit play and turn this around so you can see this.

669
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:18,320
Minnie is dancing on top of a float.

670
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:23,320
Flamenco routine.

671
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:28,320
This is there's a lot of dancers dancing to this popular song at the time.

672
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:32,320
Especially Chip and Dale, a very festive outfit.

673
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:34,320
Flamenco sleeves.

674
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:40,320
Feathery those flowery sleeves.

675
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:42,320
Yeah, this goes on for a while.

676
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:46,320
Imagine that pace for the interest of fair use laws.

677
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:47,320
I'll stop it there.

678
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:54,320
But yeah, I looking through these specials, I had convinced myself that it was Gloria Estefan doing this.

679
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:58,320
I saw there is a lot of clips of Gloria Estefan performing at Disney World.

680
00:56:58,320 --> 00:56:59,320
She is not in this.

681
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:02,320
But like this is just a thing burned into my mind.

682
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:06,320
People dancing around the Chip and Dale dancing around the Caribbean Beach Resort.

683
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:08,320
As a boy, were you like, this is great.

684
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:10,320
I love that song.

685
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:11,320
I love that song.

686
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:14,320
I love Chip and Dale.

687
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:20,320
So yeah, but this is essentially just a music video slash commercial advertising a new hotel.

688
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:22,320
Caribbean themed hotel.

689
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:24,320
They did have a great pool.

690
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:26,320
I remember my family pool hopping.

691
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:30,320
Is that the one with the slide that's the dragon's tongue?

692
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:32,320
No, I think that's a different hotel.

693
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:37,320
I think that this is the one that looks like an old like fort and there's like cannons and stuff.

694
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:40,320
So yeah, we would go there a lot.

695
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:44,320
Here's that earnestness after hearing old men contemplate their lives.

696
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:49,320
Now let's remember when we were four and all we wanted was cool water slides.

697
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:53,320
Just to come out of some animal's mouth.

698
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:57,320
I want to be spit out of a big animal.

699
00:57:57,320 --> 00:58:01,320
Can I just say also with your fondness for for conga?

700
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:02,320
Sure.

701
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:07,320
I had a very pleasurable experience two years ago when I the last time I was in New York City.

702
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:11,320
My wife Erin really wanted to see the Gloria Estefan musical.

703
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:13,320
Get on your feet.

704
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:17,320
And there we went to get last minute tickets for that day's matinee.

705
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:22,320
There were only two seats left and they were they were reserved because they were a little more expensive.

706
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:27,320
And they were the guy at the box office told us these are the conga seats.

707
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:29,320
And it was it was pricey.

708
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:31,320
But I had a feeling what that might mean.

709
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:37,320
And indeed, at the end of Act one, the showstopping closer of the first act was conga.

710
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:43,320
And before I knew it, my wife was up on her feet and in the conga line.

711
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:47,320
Escorted up by Gloria Estefan's father from the musical.

712
00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:49,320
And she's going up and down the aisle.

713
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:51,320
She's in the play.

714
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:55,320
The happiest memory could not have been.

715
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:58,320
You know, we I had a feeling what conga seats was going to mean.

716
00:58:58,320 --> 00:59:01,320
And they they didn't they did not disappoint.

717
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:03,320
Oh, what a what a what a time.

718
00:59:03,320 --> 00:59:05,320
If you if you're in New York, go see.

719
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:07,320
Get on your feet. Get on your feet.

720
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:08,320
Unless it's not playing anymore.

721
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:10,320
It may have closed a very long time ago.

722
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:11,320
There's no way to know.

723
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:21,320
OK, so again, in the in the interest of Young Jason, a big part of this special or of this parade,

724
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:26,320
a preview of Oliver and Company behind the scenes of Oliver and Company,

725
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:32,320
which if I'm remembering correctly, was the first movie a young Jason would have seen in the movie theater.

726
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:33,320
Me too.

727
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:41,320
The same. So I have that like, yeah, that that very nascent baby barely there memory

728
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:46,320
is full of holes and crazy as a Geppetto memory.

729
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:49,320
I do remember being in the theater and watching Oliver and Company.

730
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:52,320
It might be mine. I'm a year older than you guys, I feel like.

731
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:55,320
But I feel like it might be it's one of the first movies.

732
00:59:55,320 --> 00:59:59,320
I don't know if it's the first one I saw, but it's it's for sure like one of the one of the first three.

733
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:01,320
You might have been a great mouse detective guy.

734
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:03,320
I don't think I saw that in the theater. I think I saw.

735
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:07,320
Was that before? Sure. Land Before Time was also in the mix.

736
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:09,320
They were all. It's hard to know. Yeah.

737
01:00:09,320 --> 01:00:13,320
I'll tell you what else I saw in the theater pretty year after this.

738
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:18,320
Dick Tracy, a horrific looking movie to show a four year old.

739
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:21,320
Anyway, Oliver and Company. This is the big movie of the year.

740
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:26,320
You know, there's another clip in in the special of Jeffrey Katzenberg going like, you know,

741
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:31,320
we're committed to making one animated movie a year and we're on track to do it.

742
01:00:31,320 --> 01:00:35,320
And you know what those were? Those are the Little Mermaid and the Beast.

743
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:38,320
All the best ones. But this clip is real quick.

744
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:44,320
And we'll post this on social media because this one's kind of visual and it's it's pretty funny.

745
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:46,320
It's just very funny to me.

746
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:50,320
So I'll play it for you guys to see and then I'll describe what is happening.

747
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:53,320
Billy Joel suggested really early on.

748
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:56,320
Billy Joel is in sunglasses, the white T-shirt.

749
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:59,320
Billy Joel, he can sing great, but can he act?

750
01:00:59,320 --> 01:01:03,320
And then it worked out great. He can really act. He's really into the bar.

751
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:05,320
Hey, keep it down, guys.

752
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:07,320
It's Billy. Oh boy, that's right.

753
01:01:07,320 --> 01:01:09,320
That never.

754
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:11,320
He can really act.

755
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:17,320
It's just this very, just Billy Joel just grooving inside in a sound booth like we are.

756
01:01:17,320 --> 01:01:22,320
But he's got sunglasses on and he's grooving and it's very soft spoken Disney

757
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:28,320
animator just going like, yeah, he can sing, but can he act?

758
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:30,320
I don't know why this is so fun. I'm just imagining.

759
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:32,320
Can I ask you to role play?

760
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:34,320
Can I ask you to be Billy Joel in that moment?

761
01:01:34,320 --> 01:01:36,320
I'll just be the director of Oliver and Company.

762
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:38,320
Now, remember, now you're great.

763
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:40,320
You're great on stage, a lot of great stage presence.

764
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:46,320
But remember, this this part really requires you to act and really just a moat and really just just give it your all.

765
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:50,320
And it's got to be huge. It's got to jump from the microphone onto the screen.

766
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:52,320
OK, so you think you're ready, Billy?

767
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:53,320
Yeah. All right. Here we go.

768
01:01:53,320 --> 01:01:55,320
Really act, really do it.

769
01:01:55,320 --> 01:01:56,320
And action.

770
01:01:56,320 --> 01:01:58,320
Come on, the game's on.

771
01:01:58,320 --> 01:02:01,320
Oh my God.

772
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:04,320
You can really act, sir.

773
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:06,320
Thank you, Mr. Joel.

774
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:08,320
We are all weeping on the other side of the glass.

775
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:10,320
All right.

776
01:02:10,320 --> 01:02:11,320
Stay cool.

777
01:02:11,320 --> 01:02:13,320
All right. Back to the Hamptons.

778
01:02:13,320 --> 01:02:21,320
I knew it would be easy just like writing songs.

779
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:22,320
Oh, boy.

780
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:25,320
I mean, that's the that that movie I would loved.

781
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:26,320
I loved it.

782
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:28,320
I love. Yeah. Why should I worry?

783
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:30,320
Mm hmm. Yeah.

784
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:32,320
Yeah, it was great.

785
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:33,320
Is there more?

786
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:35,320
Yeah. I was waiting for more stuff.

787
01:02:35,320 --> 01:02:37,320
Hey, that's all I have from 88.

788
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:39,320
OK, cool. Hey, let's let's take a little break.

789
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:43,320
We'll be back with more Christmas magic.

790
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:48,320
All right. And we're back with podcast, The Ride, the very merry non denominational holiday special.

791
01:02:48,320 --> 01:02:53,320
And let's step through a couple more moments from some of some of these holiday specials.

792
01:02:53,320 --> 01:02:54,320
Jason, I think you had one more to talk about.

793
01:02:54,320 --> 01:03:03,320
Yeah. So just real quick, I watched the 1996 parade hosted by Suzanne Summers and Jerry Van Dyke.

794
01:03:03,320 --> 01:03:04,320
And can I say?

795
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:10,320
Chemistry, if you if you had to define the word chemistry, it would be these two together.

796
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:17,320
Chemistry, you know, knowing what the other person you're on TV with is talking about the two parts,

797
01:03:17,320 --> 01:03:21,320
the ends of the conversation lining up and actually connecting.

798
01:03:21,320 --> 01:03:29,320
I was like really upset that year to like I was so I loved Regis and Joan Lundin so much.

799
01:03:29,320 --> 01:03:34,320
And then like, who are these people? And Jerry Van Dyke is so like strange and doddering.

800
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:38,320
And I was like, I still have sour memories about this special.

801
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:41,320
How dare you play it here?

802
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:47,320
Yeah, this is also the year of the cake castle, which I love.

803
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:49,320
I also love the cake castle.

804
01:03:49,320 --> 01:03:50,320
I don't like the cake castle.

805
01:03:50,320 --> 01:03:54,320
So for those of you who don't know, for the anniversary of Disney Disney World,

806
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:59,320
they made the castle into a giant birthday cake. So it's a big pink monstrosity that looked like,

807
01:03:59,320 --> 01:04:03,320
you know, a cake or cupcake instead of the famous Cinderella Castle.

808
01:04:03,320 --> 01:04:08,320
And Jason and I as a boy loved it. Many people hated it. It was gaudy.

809
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:10,320
It was bizarre. It was strange.

810
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:14,320
I we went that year and I loved it. Yeah, I thought it was great.

811
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:16,320
You ate up the cake.

812
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:18,320
I would have. Yeah, because I scarfed down a big slice of it.

813
01:04:18,320 --> 01:04:20,320
If I could have taken a bite of it, I would.

814
01:04:20,320 --> 01:04:24,320
Jason tried and I tried and did not succeed.

815
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:26,320
What your nightmares are about still.

816
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:33,320
So this clip, real quick, let me just make sure I have the right spot.

817
01:04:33,320 --> 01:04:41,320
OK, so this is a gospel singer named Sandy Patty doing a little number in the parade.

818
01:04:41,320 --> 01:04:43,320
I'm going to play it.

819
01:04:43,320 --> 01:04:45,320
Fabulous Sandy Patty.

820
01:04:45,320 --> 01:04:57,320
Remember the magic, remember the magic. It's time to remember the magic.

821
01:04:57,320 --> 01:05:03,320
Your heart could just take wing. You could live out all your dreams.

822
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:09,320
No matter how, no matter when, you could reach that world again.

823
01:05:09,320 --> 01:05:16,320
It's like a dream come true that lives inside of you.

824
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:22,320
It's time to remember the magic.

825
01:05:22,320 --> 01:05:26,320
It's time to remember the magic.

826
01:05:26,320 --> 01:05:31,320
Remember the magic, remember the magic.

827
01:05:31,320 --> 01:05:39,320
A new rock destination, a new celebration.

828
01:05:39,320 --> 01:05:42,320
Twenty five years of Disney magic.

829
01:05:42,320 --> 01:05:44,320
All right, we'll stop it there.

830
01:05:44,320 --> 01:05:46,320
Twenty five years of Disney magic.

831
01:05:46,320 --> 01:05:52,320
Now, what do you think they're standing on, singing Zippity Dooda?

832
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:55,320
A big log, a giant splash mountain log?

833
01:05:55,320 --> 01:06:01,320
No, she's standing on the Cinderella float and a bunch of like royal like people are dancing.

834
01:06:01,320 --> 01:06:04,320
But here's what happens later in the parade.

835
01:06:04,320 --> 01:06:08,320
For the winner now with the showboat from Song of the South.

836
01:06:08,320 --> 01:06:11,320
Song of the South. Here it comes right now.

837
01:06:11,320 --> 01:06:13,320
Song of the South.

838
01:06:13,320 --> 01:06:20,320
And here is Square Rabbit, Bear Bear and Bear Fox on a big boat.

839
01:06:20,320 --> 01:06:26,320
So this is also weird to look at now, like Disney acknowledging Song of the South.

840
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:32,320
Yeah, because Song of the South, this old controversial movie, is always part of the parks with Splash Mountain,

841
01:06:32,320 --> 01:06:35,320
but they don't really like shove those characters out there.

842
01:06:35,320 --> 01:06:38,320
They don't make them such a strong part of the.

843
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:41,320
Yeah. What I was going to say is that Jerry Van Dyke, famous.

844
01:06:41,320 --> 01:06:44,320
Jerry Van Dyke is the one who introduced the song of the.

845
01:06:44,320 --> 01:06:49,320
He screwed it up. Jerry Van Dyke is, if always cast as like a fuck up,

846
01:06:49,320 --> 01:06:54,320
he always is a guy who like he was that on when he was on the Dick Van Dyke show and when he was on.

847
01:06:54,320 --> 01:06:58,320
I just watched a Mary Tyler Moore episode where Mary's dating Jerry Van Dyke.

848
01:06:58,320 --> 01:07:02,320
He's a loser guy who tries to be a stand up comedian and he sucks.

849
01:07:02,320 --> 01:07:05,320
So Jerry Van Dyke in real life, I think, is like a screw up.

850
01:07:05,320 --> 01:07:09,320
That's like the whole thing. And then he proves it here in the Disney,

851
01:07:09,320 --> 01:07:15,320
unless he's trying to tie continuity together through all of his various roles throughout TV history.

852
01:07:15,320 --> 01:07:24,320
As soon as the special was done, he walked out of the announcer booth the wrong way and fell down onto Main Street, cracked his head.

853
01:07:24,320 --> 01:07:26,320
He got his head caught in a bucket of paint.

854
01:07:26,320 --> 01:07:29,320
Like he was walking around, he couldn't. Then he tripped down some. Yeah.

855
01:07:29,320 --> 01:07:36,320
And ever since then, he's been talking to wooden horses and toasters trying to get him in the bath.

856
01:07:36,320 --> 01:07:39,320
Jason, does that take us through the. Yeah, that's all myself.

857
01:07:39,320 --> 01:07:41,320
I also I flipped through that special as well.

858
01:07:41,320 --> 01:07:46,320
You get a special sneak preview of the live action Glenn Close 101 Dalmatians.

859
01:07:46,320 --> 01:07:55,320
And there's this one part where they show you how baby puppies are made and they pull an inanimate sort of foam rubber Dalmatian out of a mold.

860
01:07:55,320 --> 01:07:58,320
And it's one of the creepiest images I have ever seen.

861
01:07:58,320 --> 01:08:02,320
It was like kind of like birthing of like unpainted puppy fetus.

862
01:08:02,320 --> 01:08:05,320
It's one of the most disturbing images.

863
01:08:05,320 --> 01:08:11,320
In keeping with the nightmare, I could have let that go and not talked about that foam puppy fetus.

864
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:14,320
And yet I had to. You felt compelled to.

865
01:08:14,320 --> 01:08:17,320
It's in my brain and I had to spread it to yours.

866
01:08:17,320 --> 01:08:20,320
I couldn't hold on to that memory. No.

867
01:08:20,320 --> 01:08:23,320
So I have I have one I have one more.

868
01:08:23,320 --> 01:08:28,320
And after all of this depression, let me just play like the happiest thing that I could imagine.

869
01:08:28,320 --> 01:08:33,320
And and by the way, I want to give a shout out to this one was put on the Internet by our friend Doug Jones,

870
01:08:33,320 --> 01:08:35,320
a.k.a. Dante Fontana.

871
01:08:35,320 --> 01:08:41,320
And if you're if after all this, you're somehow still interested in clips from Bazaar,

872
01:08:41,320 --> 01:08:47,320
Disney holiday specials and other specials from all year round, Doug made these amazing mashup.

873
01:08:47,320 --> 01:08:54,320
Have you guys seen these these things Doug's made these these like feature like the way what are they called?

874
01:08:54,320 --> 01:08:59,320
The Mouseketeers escape to Splash Mountain and Golden Girls return from Space Mountain.

875
01:08:59,320 --> 01:09:06,320
These are on these are on Vimeo or you can order them, I believe, as DVDs off of Dante Fontana dot com.

876
01:09:06,320 --> 01:09:10,320
Just a shout out. He made me aware of so many bizarre, wonderful moments from these these Disney specials,

877
01:09:10,320 --> 01:09:14,320
including this one, which he's responsible for putting on YouTube.

878
01:09:14,320 --> 01:09:39,320
Ladies and gentlemen, a performance from the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles with special guest Alan Thicke.

879
01:09:39,320 --> 01:09:44,320
So what we are looking at right now and please do yourself a favor and look this one up.

880
01:09:44,320 --> 01:09:52,320
It is Alan Thicke dressed kind of like the Schwarzenegger Schwarzenegger in Terminator mode with leather jacket and sunglasses

881
01:09:52,320 --> 01:10:01,320
doing kind of a kind of a rap rock version of Santa Claus is coming to town while the Ninja Turtles do a roundhouse flips around him and the like.

882
01:10:01,320 --> 01:10:07,320
And I won't play the whole thing, but you end up with slightly customized Ninja Turtles related lyrics like

883
01:10:07,320 --> 01:10:15,320
he sees you eat your pizza. It is a real delight.

884
01:10:15,320 --> 01:10:19,320
I remember this and this was a big because I think this is the end of the special. Am I wrong?

885
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:23,320
Or there's another maybe there's another Ninja Turtle. I can't imagine how they would top it.

886
01:10:23,320 --> 01:10:26,320
Yeah, because they would they teased me for like an hour or two.

887
01:10:26,320 --> 01:10:30,320
And I remember just killing me to wait to see the Ninja Turtles.

888
01:10:30,320 --> 01:10:33,320
And I don't my memory Alan Thicke has been erased from my memory.

889
01:10:33,320 --> 01:10:38,320
It's just that I remember the Ninja Turtles and they're with the party wagon, the turtle van.

890
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:44,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah. And it was thrilling to see them in one of my favorite places.

891
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:49,320
Pretending to kick nothing, kicking at the audience, which didn't register.

892
01:10:49,320 --> 01:10:54,320
It's practice. If there were foot soldiers here, consider them kicked in the face.

893
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:57,320
I think Alan adds a lot to it. Please look this up.

894
01:10:57,320 --> 01:11:04,320
Please look a look up my other favorite Alan Thicke musical number Sweaty and Hot from the 1987 Aerobics Championships.

895
01:11:04,320 --> 01:11:11,320
It's a song that he wrote that's a like a love song with the gymnastics metaphor strength throughout.

896
01:11:11,320 --> 01:11:13,320
We're giving you a lot of homework on this one.

897
01:11:13,320 --> 01:11:18,320
Pablo Cruz, the many musical numbers of Alan Thicke, check them out.

898
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:24,320
So there's a there's a there's our brief jaunt through the history of Disney holiday specials.

899
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:29,320
There's more. We could save some for next year or we could never discuss these again.

900
01:11:29,320 --> 01:11:37,320
But what a incredibly miserable area if it's not the Ninja Turtles doing around house flips and singing about.

901
01:11:37,320 --> 01:11:39,320
Or Caribbean Shippendale.

902
01:11:39,320 --> 01:11:46,320
Yes, some of it some of it is a pure delight and some of it is a dark night of the soul.

903
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:52,320
But that's what's great. These are these specials are a fun grab bag as this episode been apparently.

904
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:58,320
Ho ho ho. Merry Christmas. Happy holidays.

905
01:11:58,320 --> 01:12:01,320
And now to send off this holiday episode with a bang.

906
01:12:01,320 --> 01:12:05,320
We have come up with a segment called Holiday Overlay.

907
01:12:05,320 --> 01:12:10,320
Now what we're going to do is we're each going to choose a ride that exists at any theme park across the world.

908
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:18,320
And much like Disney does or Universal would do, we'll put a overlay on it related to, you know, Christmas or the holiday season.

909
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:28,320
Contemporary holiday re-theming, a la the Haunted Mansion holiday that they do with Nightmare Before Christmas or the Jungle Cruise becomes the Jingle Cruise.

910
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:30,320
That's been a recent thing. I don't know if you've seen it.

911
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:35,320
But I've seen it. They put like Santa hats on the hippos. There's not much to it. That's really all it is.

912
01:12:35,320 --> 01:12:36,320
They're not doing it this year.

913
01:12:36,320 --> 01:12:38,320
But they're not doing it this year. Right.

914
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:44,320
But there is an example of a not successful one, one that they haven't kept up, but Small World Holiday, Haunted Mansion Holiday.

915
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:48,320
These are some treasured parts of the holidays at Disneyland.

916
01:12:48,320 --> 01:12:55,320
At Halloween, they do Space Mountain Ghost Galaxy where they project an evil space ghost that follows you around.

917
01:12:55,320 --> 01:13:00,320
And it kind of like lightly claws at you. And it's scary. And it's not much different.

918
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:04,320
But it's fun. You know, it's fun to have a little bit of a change up on the rides.

919
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:10,320
So we're each going to take a ride and we're going to present what we think a holiday overlay for that ride would be.

920
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:16,320
All right. So we're all familiar with the famous ride that is Avatar Flight of Passage.

921
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:20,320
OK, it just opened this year. It is in the Avatar land, which is in Disney World.

922
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:23,320
And it's the ride itself is like a simulator ride.

923
01:13:23,320 --> 01:13:27,320
And it's where you take part in the beautiful journey of becoming one with the mighty Akron,

924
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:31,320
aka the Banshee, which are those flying creatures in the movie Avatar.

925
01:13:31,320 --> 01:13:34,320
You don't need to tell us both of their names. We all know.

926
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:35,320
I know. I know you guys know.

927
01:13:35,320 --> 01:13:40,320
I just want to case there's one person out there that doesn't know about flying majestically over the Moara Valley, you know,

928
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:44,320
the Hallelujah Mountains. Yes. And take your take your place along the other Navi.

929
01:13:44,320 --> 01:13:51,320
So get ready to experience Pandora in a whole new way with Avatar Flight of Passage.

930
01:13:51,320 --> 01:13:58,320
Ho ho holiday. So here's the thing. Navi Santa Claus is really sick, like very sick.

931
01:13:58,320 --> 01:14:04,320
No. OK. And he's not going to make the Christmas Forest Gift Festival, the name of which, you know,

932
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:07,320
I can't pronounce because it's in Navi, but they'll come up with a lot of apostrophes.

933
01:14:07,320 --> 01:14:10,320
Yeah, they'll come up with a better Navi name for it.

934
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:15,320
So Navi Santa Claus has enlisted all of you to ride on the backs of the mighty Akron

935
01:14:15,320 --> 01:14:18,320
and deliver gifts for all the Navi boys and girls.

936
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:22,320
So, you know, you give like a new like a leather groin cloth for little.

937
01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:26,320
And I put these in the Navi name generator. What would be Michael in Navi?

938
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:29,320
Samukin would be my name. So like he gets that.

939
01:14:29,320 --> 01:14:35,320
Or you get like a necklace that says I see you, which is, of course, the famous line from Avatar.

940
01:14:35,320 --> 01:14:41,320
Again, I don't have to tell you guys, but we all know I see you is the is the famous thing that Navi say to each other.

941
01:14:41,320 --> 01:14:46,320
And you have to go over and you fill everyone's stockings with unobtanium.

942
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:49,320
And, you know, and you give cheer to everyone.

943
01:14:49,320 --> 01:14:54,320
So it's basically the same ride system. It's just that now you're distributing presents.

944
01:14:54,320 --> 01:15:00,320
And there'll also be some virtual reality gloves where you'll be able to, you know, throw presents at different things.

945
01:15:00,320 --> 01:15:04,320
So there'll be a point system as well. We're adding a different whole different element to this ride.

946
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:11,320
Who spread the most cheer, aka the Narzan, the Navi word for cheer.

947
01:15:11,320 --> 01:15:14,320
So you're taking the ride and it's basically, you know, it's not going to be that expensive.

948
01:15:14,320 --> 01:15:17,320
But now you're adding another element to it that's super fun.

949
01:15:17,320 --> 01:15:22,320
And of course, there's going to be an original song sung by Leona Lewis, who sung, of course,

950
01:15:22,320 --> 01:15:25,320
the very famous I See You, the hit song from Avatar.

951
01:15:25,320 --> 01:15:27,320
Why are you even bothering to explain it?

952
01:15:27,320 --> 01:15:30,320
I'm just in case there's one person out there that doesn't remember the detail from Avatar.

953
01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:32,320
I know everyone mostly does.

954
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:35,320
It'd be like saying, you know, my heart will go on from Titanic.

955
01:15:35,320 --> 01:15:38,320
Those songs from James Cameron films are exactly equal.

956
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:44,320
Of course, yes, they are. So look, she sings a song, I See You parentheses at Navi Christmas.

957
01:15:44,320 --> 01:15:46,320
And that's the ride. And I think it would be a big hit.

958
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:47,320
And a Happy New Year.

959
01:15:47,320 --> 01:15:50,320
And a Happy Navi New Year.

960
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:53,320
Oh, wow. So the Ho Ho Ho holiday. What was it?

961
01:15:53,320 --> 01:15:56,320
The holiday ride of our passage?

962
01:15:56,320 --> 01:16:00,320
Avatar Flight of Passage. I mean, we can workshop the title specifically, you know,

963
01:16:00,320 --> 01:16:03,320
to get maybe something that is maybe more Navi friendly.

964
01:16:03,320 --> 01:16:06,320
But that's the working title. Ho Ho Holiday. Avatar Flight of Passage.

965
01:16:06,320 --> 01:16:09,320
That's a blast. And you know, they have the technology.

966
01:16:09,320 --> 01:16:11,320
They have the screen. It's easy to change that stuff out.

967
01:16:11,320 --> 01:16:13,320
Like Guardians of the Galaxy Mission Breakout.

968
01:16:13,320 --> 01:16:16,320
Let's get that done. Next holiday season, Disney World.

969
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:20,320
Yeah, we'll inject a little holiday spirit into Pandora.

970
01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:22,320
Jason, you want to do it or I can go next?

971
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:29,320
Sure. Well, you know, we recorded this episode lately, so it's fresh on my mind.

972
01:16:29,320 --> 01:16:35,320
And I thought to myself, what better way to incorporate Christmas

973
01:16:35,320 --> 01:16:40,320
than a ride that already involves trees to some extent.

974
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:45,320
So Dudley Do-Rites rips off Christmas, everyone.

975
01:16:45,320 --> 01:16:49,320
OK, you Dudley has to save Christmas.

976
01:16:49,320 --> 01:16:53,320
You change the story of the ride and you want to talk about inexpensive.

977
01:16:53,320 --> 01:16:59,320
This is inexpensive. You just put a Christmas tree outfit over the Nell animatronics.

978
01:16:59,320 --> 01:17:01,320
You don't have to change anything.

979
01:17:01,320 --> 01:17:06,320
You put the Christmas tree outfit right over her, cut out a thing for her face.

980
01:17:06,320 --> 01:17:10,320
So it's like, oh, it's Nell, but she's also a Christmas tree somehow.

981
01:17:10,320 --> 01:17:14,320
And then you hang some balls throughout the ride.

982
01:17:14,320 --> 01:17:19,320
Maybe at some point there's a wild sound take of just Dudley going like,

983
01:17:19,320 --> 01:17:22,320
Merry Christmas, everyone, and the horse neighs.

984
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:26,320
So Snidely Whiplash is trying to kidnap a Christmas tree?

985
01:17:26,320 --> 01:17:29,320
Yes, he's trying to kidnap one Christmas tree.

986
01:17:29,320 --> 01:17:32,320
And he's tying one to the train tracks, the Christmas tree to the train tracks.

987
01:17:32,320 --> 01:17:36,320
Yes, you can very easily paint him, just give him a new hat and a new mustache.

988
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:38,320
And then he's evil old Jack Frost.

989
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:42,320
Oh, sure. That's going to make the money go up a little bit.

990
01:17:42,320 --> 01:17:44,320
They will have to buy one new hat.

991
01:17:44,320 --> 01:17:46,320
Yeah, you got to buy that new hat.

992
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:49,320
Or just paint it and paint and repaint it. But paint costs money too.

993
01:17:49,320 --> 01:17:52,320
Ayla, I know you're trying to be budget conscious with this ride.

994
01:17:52,320 --> 01:17:54,320
So, you know, this is just a quickie.

995
01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:59,320
You know, it's fun, fun for the folks.

996
01:17:59,320 --> 01:18:04,320
It helps distract people from the fact that Florida is starting to get colder

997
01:18:04,320 --> 01:18:06,320
and they're on a water ride.

998
01:18:06,320 --> 01:18:09,320
Yeah, so Dudley do rides, rips off Christmas.

999
01:18:09,320 --> 01:18:13,320
And maybe the horse has a little Santa hat too.

1000
01:18:13,320 --> 01:18:15,320
Oh, wow. Okay. Yeah, yeah.

1001
01:18:15,320 --> 01:18:17,320
That sounds great. Why not?

1002
01:18:17,320 --> 01:18:19,320
I think we can make that happen very easily.

1003
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:21,320
Could you dye the water a Christmas color?

1004
01:18:21,320 --> 01:18:24,320
Could it be a red or green or alternatingly both?

1005
01:18:24,320 --> 01:18:29,320
Could you freeze the water and have the raft slide on the ice?

1006
01:18:29,320 --> 01:18:30,320
Ooh, that'd be fun.

1007
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:31,320
I mean, look.

1008
01:18:31,320 --> 01:18:32,320
And then it'll go faster.

1009
01:18:32,320 --> 01:18:35,320
These ideas change the properties of the physics of the ride.

1010
01:18:35,320 --> 01:18:36,320
That's true.

1011
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:39,320
It may not be scientifically literally possible, but hey,

1012
01:18:39,320 --> 01:18:42,320
this is a blue sky brainstorming sesh.

1013
01:18:42,320 --> 01:18:43,320
Sure.

1014
01:18:43,320 --> 01:18:45,320
And anything goes.

1015
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:47,320
That's delightful.

1016
01:18:47,320 --> 01:18:54,320
Mine's a little bit, I'm going to do something that's a little more of a thinker.

1017
01:18:54,320 --> 01:19:00,320
It might, you know, it's not necessarily, well, you'll see.

1018
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:06,320
It's a bit of a grim situation, but it all works out in the end.

1019
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:12,320
I'm going to take a ride that has never really had any particular stakes to it or any story.

1020
01:19:12,320 --> 01:19:13,320
It's just kind of a ride that puts along.

1021
01:19:13,320 --> 01:19:15,320
You look at stuff passively.

1022
01:19:15,320 --> 01:19:19,320
And I think it could use kind of a bigger sense of mystery or intrigue.

1023
01:19:19,320 --> 01:19:25,320
I'm going to take you guys now on submarine voyage, journey to the sunken pole.

1024
01:19:25,320 --> 01:19:31,320
And the story here is that it's a future in which the polar ice caps have melted.

1025
01:19:31,320 --> 01:19:37,320
And the rumor is that in those events, in the events of that tragedy,

1026
01:19:37,320 --> 01:19:43,320
Santa's workshop and the entire North Pole compound where he works was buried and lost.

1027
01:19:43,320 --> 01:19:48,320
Nobody has eyes on Santa's whereabouts or the elves or the reindeer.

1028
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:51,320
So we're going to board a submarine and we're going to submerge

1029
01:19:51,320 --> 01:19:55,320
and we're going to see if we can find what happens to Santa's workshop.

1030
01:19:55,320 --> 01:19:59,320
And like your attraction, this one can involve James Cameron.

1031
01:19:59,320 --> 01:20:01,320
He's now in the Disney family with Avatar.

1032
01:20:01,320 --> 01:20:06,320
And he's big into discovering sunken remains like that of the Titanic.

1033
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:07,320
He loves submarines.

1034
01:20:07,320 --> 01:20:10,320
He loves remains. He loves sunken remains.

1035
01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:13,320
So let's give him a shot to keep talking about it.

1036
01:20:13,320 --> 01:20:15,320
He'd be your narrator on this journey.

1037
01:20:15,320 --> 01:20:18,320
And for a while you'd just be submerging and it would seem like,

1038
01:20:18,320 --> 01:20:20,320
well, maybe we're never going to figure this out.

1039
01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:21,320
Maybe we're never going to get there.

1040
01:20:21,320 --> 01:20:25,320
Maybe we won't have any closure on this this North Pole burial.

1041
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:33,320
But then hovering just above an iceberg, we see a little a little red and white weather vane shaped like a reindeer.

1042
01:20:33,320 --> 01:20:34,320
And that's the proof.

1043
01:20:34,320 --> 01:20:37,320
That's the up at the top of Santa's workshop cottage.

1044
01:20:37,320 --> 01:20:39,320
So we know there's there we go. That's the proof.

1045
01:20:39,320 --> 01:20:48,320
If we keep digging. So in the submarine, you blow a hole in the iceberg and you go and you keep sinking and you and you discover,

1046
01:20:48,320 --> 01:20:53,320
oh, my God, it is true. These are the remains of Santa's North Pole workshop.

1047
01:20:53,320 --> 01:20:57,320
And it's you know, it's it's it's a little it's a little bit upsetting.

1048
01:20:57,320 --> 01:20:59,320
You know, you you a little bit.

1049
01:20:59,320 --> 01:21:08,320
You get you get a sense of the full depth of whatever occurred there when the ice caps in the avalanche, whatever it was that happened.

1050
01:21:08,320 --> 01:21:16,320
You see you see errands, candy canes and Christmas scarves and sweaters drifting around through the ice flow.

1051
01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:30,320
You see unworn Santa suits and belts and boots, toys that could never find a home, dollies and little horses that, you know, that will never be given to a child.

1052
01:21:30,320 --> 01:21:34,320
It's very it's been now at this point, kids, the kids are upset, right?

1053
01:21:34,320 --> 01:21:38,320
This isn't like kids are going to be upset.

1054
01:21:38,320 --> 01:21:41,320
You all are both tearing up as I as I described this ride.

1055
01:21:41,320 --> 01:21:57,320
But I think it's important. It's it involves it sheds a light on the ravages of global warming and what is happening to our earth to know that we could we could lose something as precious as as Santa's workshop.

1056
01:21:57,320 --> 01:22:07,320
And just when things seem the most grim, as we as we're arriving back at the port, the hatch opens up and a beam of sunlight comes in.

1057
01:22:07,320 --> 01:22:13,320
And who should be there but a little old driver so lively and quick, you know, that he is St. Nick.

1058
01:22:13,320 --> 01:22:18,320
You hear his ho ho ho and you discover, oh, my God, Santa made it out in time.

1059
01:22:18,320 --> 01:22:20,320
He made it out before the avalanche.

1060
01:22:20,320 --> 01:22:25,320
Imagine you've been in that summary, you think like things are as grim as they could ever be.

1061
01:22:25,320 --> 01:22:28,320
But then you come back out and, oh, my God, he made it.

1062
01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:30,320
There's Santa. There's Mrs. Claus.

1063
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:34,320
There's there's all of the elves and all of the reindeer and old Rudolph himself.

1064
01:22:34,320 --> 01:22:41,320
They made it out in time and they moved Santa's workshop to the Canadian province of Nunavut.

1065
01:22:41,320 --> 01:22:45,320
And so so Santa's workshop is up and running and it's green now.

1066
01:22:45,320 --> 01:22:50,320
They learn their lesson. It is no longer coal emitting workshop.

1067
01:22:50,320 --> 01:23:00,320
And and you get to celebrate with them and have a eat gingerbread cookies and share a candy cane, which is, of course, what Mrs. Claus makes.

1068
01:23:00,320 --> 01:23:01,320
She makes the candy canes.

1069
01:23:01,320 --> 01:23:07,320
If you have the lore of so it's I like this because it's a story with a lot of push and pull.

1070
01:23:07,320 --> 01:23:14,320
Imagine the the terror of thinking that Santa and all his friends have died, but discovering that they that they made it out and they're stronger than ever.

1071
01:23:14,320 --> 01:23:17,320
So the ride itself is just bleak.

1072
01:23:17,320 --> 01:23:20,320
The ride itself, it feels like the ride portion of it just feels like it's a sloth.

1073
01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:23,320
It's a it's a horrible nightmare. Yeah.

1074
01:23:23,320 --> 01:23:25,320
And then when you get off the ride, then you're like, oh, everything's OK.

1075
01:23:25,320 --> 01:23:27,320
But the ride itself is horrible.

1076
01:23:27,320 --> 01:23:34,320
The ride itself, the ride itself when you're journeying through crumbling gingerbread houses.

1077
01:23:34,320 --> 01:23:39,320
Right. And I mean, it's you can't deny it would be it would be effective.

1078
01:23:39,320 --> 01:23:42,320
It would stick with you. It would cause a conversation on the way home.

1079
01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:47,320
It would make you talk about global warming and what's happening to our planet.

1080
01:23:47,320 --> 01:23:52,320
I think it'd be more more effective than the inconvenient truth films like touring a disaster site basically.

1081
01:23:52,320 --> 01:23:57,320
Or going to Disney with an aging Art Carney.

1082
01:23:57,320 --> 01:24:03,320
It's the North Pole is frozen over just as his icy heart has.

1083
01:24:03,320 --> 01:24:05,320
And and that's sort of what's happened here.

1084
01:24:05,320 --> 01:24:08,320
Look, I'm yeah, I'm not I'm not saying it's it's it's fun.

1085
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:11,320
But what do they all do? They all have to be. They don't.

1086
01:24:11,320 --> 01:24:14,320
I mean, Lincoln, Lincoln is not fun at all.

1087
01:24:14,320 --> 01:24:18,320
Great moments with Mr. Lincoln. Yeah, there's a there's a precedent for depressing stuff in the parks.

1088
01:24:18,320 --> 01:24:22,320
You learn about the Civil War, you learn about a family torn apart.

1089
01:24:22,320 --> 01:24:27,320
So why not see a lot of elf workstation with no one filling them?

1090
01:24:27,320 --> 01:24:29,320
So always that will never be given.

1091
01:24:29,320 --> 01:24:37,320
While I think your idea sounds just totally miserable, I do have to appreciate the lesson it's teaching the youth of today.

1092
01:24:37,320 --> 01:24:43,320
Yeah, so and and these are things, you know, Epcot Center teaches about what might be happening to our futures.

1093
01:24:43,320 --> 01:24:47,320
We discussed the universe of energy and its discussion of fossil fuels.

1094
01:24:47,320 --> 01:24:51,320
You know, there are issues in the park and it's time to bring them back for the holidays.

1095
01:24:51,320 --> 01:24:55,320
Make people realize that if we aren't careful this Christmas, there may not be another.

1096
01:24:55,320 --> 01:24:58,320
Hmm. That's something to think about. Yeah.

1097
01:24:58,320 --> 01:25:02,320
So Imagineers Journey to the Sunken Pole.

1098
01:25:02,320 --> 01:25:05,320
I think I think everybody's sold, right? Yep. We're all sold. Great.

1099
01:25:05,320 --> 01:25:08,320
Well, have a Merry Christmas and a happy holiday, everyone.

1100
01:25:08,320 --> 01:25:10,320
Thank you so much for listening. Make it so happy.

1101
01:25:10,320 --> 01:25:14,320
Hey, look, as we reach the end of the year here, we've thank just anybody who's listening.

1102

Thanks so much for listening. I hope I hope other than this episode that you've had some fun and enjoy.

1103
01:25:20,320 --> 01:25:23,320
Enjoy yourself as we've taken you on this little podcast ride.

1104

Thank you for all your your nice comments on Twitter. Thank you for your iTunes reviews.

1105
01:25:28,320 --> 01:25:34,320
They warm our hearts. And hey, if you have any questions, we'd like to do a mailbag episode at some point.

1106
01:25:34,320 --> 01:25:41,320
