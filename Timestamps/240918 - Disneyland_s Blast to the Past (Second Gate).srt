1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
5, 4, 3, 2, 1

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Ayy, callin' all daddy-os and nifty chicks

3
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Why don't you doo-wop a doobie down to the podcast

4
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
The Ryder Rooney's Big Second Gate Hop

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Unless you're cruisin' for a bruisin'

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Ayy, it's me, it's Scott Gertner

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Oh, no more of that

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Scott Gertner, it's Jason Sheridan

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Hey, you better watch yourself, Scott

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Or I'm gonna tell you to sit on it

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Boy, you drop characters so fast

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
You look like you wanna shooby-dooby down into my fist-a-roony

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Hey, yakity yak, don't talk back, Jason

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
We all caught on to the same type of thing about this

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Which requires some backtracking, some explaining

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
But clearly the same type of thing as a vice grip on all of us

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Today we are talking about a Disneyland event called Blast to the Past

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
To the Past, not from the past

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
That's the movie about the people in the bomb shelter

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
This is Blast to the Past

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Where Disneyland blasted you to the past

22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Specifically the 1950s mixed with a little bit of 60s

23
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
This is an event that was held in 1988

24
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
And was successful enough to carry over into 1989

25
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
And we are piecing together what this event was

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
From some photos, some parade videos

27
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:59,000
And from a syndicated TV special that Disney put together

28
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
In I think the first year of doing it

29
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Hosted by Bowser from Sha Na Na

30
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
This is sort of what we're working with

31
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
John Bowman

32
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Is that how you pronounce it?

33
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
John Bowser Bowman

34
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Who has never come up on this show before

35
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I don't think so

36
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Unless it's just a stray thing

37
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I mean it feels like impossible that we haven't somehow

38
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Because was Sha Na Na or at least him

39
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Not on like the Brady Bunch variety hour

40
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Which we covered a while back

41
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
It seems very possible

42
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
But that's sort of I think what we're dealing with here

43
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Is 80s nostalgia for the 50s

44
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Which was pretty strong

45
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I mean there was a lot of this in the 70s

46
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
And I guess a little bit in the 80s as well

47
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
50s by way of 80s

48
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Sha Na Na started

49
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Sha Na Na was like a revival band comedy act

50
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
That started in 69

51
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
So they started their 50s nostalgia in 69

52
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Because they were at Woodstock, correct?

53
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I believe so, yeah

54
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
They are the main

55
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I feel like I've said before on the show

56
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
In my theory that Woodstock actually kind of sucked

57
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Because if you really look at that lineup

58
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I mean I think the best of the best of that lineup

59
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Was unbelievable and historic

60
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
And rightfully praised

61
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
But you look at the full Woodstock

62
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Especially Sha Na Na

63
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Sha Na Na makes no sense

64
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Because they were a 50s doo-wop

65
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
It's the harmonizing

66
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Where somebody's

67
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Wa-wa-wa-wa-wa

68
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
And then Bowser

69
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Who kind of had celebrity beyond and outside of

70
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Sha Na Na was the

71
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Bop-a-bop-a-bop-doo-doo-doo-doo

72
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Yeah, he had the deep voice

73
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Let's unpack your attitude

74
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Because you're groaning

75
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
You're huffing and puffing

76
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I just

77
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
The 50s nostalgia

78
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Specifically for the

79
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Grease happy days

80
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
50s nostalgia

81
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Not even happy

82
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I feel like happy days is more nuanced than

83
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
This is like

84
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Throwback burger shop

85
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Nostalgia

86
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
And that's the only place I think I really like it

87
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
It's like oh if I'm eating a hamburger

88
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
And I can pick out the song

89
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
On a tiny jukebox on the table

90
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
You're right

91
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I like the feeling of flipping

92
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Those little metal pages

93
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
And having something to do with the table

94
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I don't think I've been near one of those in a long time

95
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Having the milkshake

96
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
In your glass and then they leave

97
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
The silver

98
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
The gnarly silver cup

99
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
That exists so people's hands

100
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Don't get destroyed by a milkshake

101
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Machine

102
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
The 50s nostalgia you tolerate is mainly food oriented

103
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Yes

104
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Johnny Rockets style

105
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Yeah, Johnny Rockets probably the most

106
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Known

107
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
You have nostalgia for Johnny Rockets

108
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
A place that was absolutely

109
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
God-awful when we went there years ago

110
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
In the first city walk

111
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I had a nice day though

112
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I remember

113
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I ate like a hot dog I think alone

114
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
And I was watching out into the fountain area

115
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
And I remember going this is pretty good

116
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I'm having a good time here

117
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I think that might have been one of my outings at Johnny Rockets

118
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Where everything is like wet

119
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
You had the wet burger

120
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
You had the ketchup bottle and just a bunch of water fell out

121
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
And I'm like how

122
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
How is that possible?

123
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
It's not even ketchup water

124
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
My guess is all the same things happened to Mike

125
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
But you were having a nice city walk day

126
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
And you didn't even notice

127
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
It was soaking wet hot dog

128
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
But I liked it because I was enjoying myself

129
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Just day wise

130
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Watching this

131
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Which

132
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Saying it's syndicated makes sense

133
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Because there's a lot of Southern California stuff in it

134
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
But like

135
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Bowser has the

136
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Writing credit as well

137
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
And there's really not a lot of sketch

138
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Like there's like him on the

139
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Jungle cruise going whoa

140
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I got lost

141
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I was trying to find the

142
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Wait who is it?

143
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
The main singer

144
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Little Anthony

145
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I was trying to find Little Anthony

146
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
And then I got on his boat

147
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
What's this all about?

148
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I wrote that line

149
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I was impressed to see the writing credit

150
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
When we finished recording

151
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I had to go right to getting an MRI

152
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
And watching him

153
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Watching him do some of these

154
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Oh can you believe I've been

155
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Doing this for 15 years

156
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I'm like I wish I was in the tube

157
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I wish I was

158
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Xanned out in the MRI

159
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Tube

160
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Rather than watching his bits

161
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I'm going to be thinking about

162
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Palmin

163
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Start tossing

164
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
And turning and they're going to go like sir

165
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Please no movement

166
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
What are those sounds? Those are normal

167
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
The other sounds

168
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
We're not hearing that Jason

169
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I think that's in your brain Jason

170
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Splish splash

171
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Just craving the metal grind

172
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Just craving the loud poop

173
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I wish I had the earplugs

174
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I wish I was in the tube

175
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
This is fascinating to me Jason

176
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I'm just fully preparing to come in here

177
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
As the negative Nellie

178
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
And the one to

179
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I didn't know

180
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I assume if there's something that I

181
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Viemently dislike that you two are going to like it

182
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
That's just my assumption at this point

183
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
So to hear this from Jason is great

184
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Because I'm like 5 minutes into the special

185
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
And I'm watching some of this parade

186
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Which is very much in that

187
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Like bang da wang da wang

188
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Shibby wibby wibby

189
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
And I'm like it had never occurred to me

190
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
So much until watching this

191
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I hate 50s shit

192
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I didn't know it

193
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Now I can shout it from the rooftops

194
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I don't think I knew

195
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
And now this special has taught me

196
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
50s shit sucks

197
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
We've okay so I don't remember how many years ago it was

198
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
But there was a discussion on this show

199
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I don't know if it was specifically like

200
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Doo-wop style music

201
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
But the two of you were very much in lockstep

202
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Against Doo-wop in general

203
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
We've been through this before really

204
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
So we blasted before

205
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Now I was not saying

206
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I love bang cha bang cha bang

207
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Like I was not arguing that

208
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
But I was arguing I like some of it

209
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
But you two were both in lockstep about like

210
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I hate the doo-boo-boo-wop

211
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Yeah you both said that

212
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I remember this and I don't remember what episode it was

213
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Some of this

214
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Like the songs removed from the like

215
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Hey it's a 6th grade dance

216
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
And it's bobby sock themed

217
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
And I'm like oh god

218
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I don't care about that either

219
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I was never a big happy days guy

220
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
And I recently too

221
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I guess I didn't watch a lot of happy days

222
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
But apparently they kind of like quietly got rid of the 50s

223
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Toward the end of happy days

224
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I don't know what season it was

225
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
But they kind of just like quietly were like

226
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
They're not in the 50s anymore

227
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Well especially as like Joni

228
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
And Chot and then the spin off Joni Loves Chot

229
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Yeah cause 50s is too exhausting

230
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
But like yeah I don't have any

231
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Affection for this

232
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I don't have any affection in general

233
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
For like the poodle skirt

234
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Grease is okay

235
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Some of the songs are okay but I'm not a big grease guy either

236
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I'm not a grease guy at all

237
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I think maybe though

238
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Because alright I started watching this

239
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
And that was my big alright 50 shit

240
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
And then I started analyzing

241
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I was kind of arguing with Erin a little bit

242
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Because she likes some 50 stuff

243
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
And she was like I think you need to

244
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Create a separation here

245
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Because there's probably like

246
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Some stuff from the 50s that's not so mired

247
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
In the shuwapawada

248
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
You probably like

249
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I think what she's saying what you don't like

250
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Is latter day

251
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Retro for the 50s

252
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Which is that's what grease is

253
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
That's what happy days is

254
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
But I think happy days is a whole other thing

255
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Happy days doesn't annoy me whatsoever

256
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I mean it went for so many years

257
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I think there is nuance in there

258
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
And I really like

259
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
American Graffiti

260
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Like that's a little more gnarly

261
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Aggressive cartoonish 50s

262
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
It's a very like down beat

263
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Tonal like yeah

264
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
No that's not like oh gee whiz

265
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
It's like it's a you know

266
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I feel like he actually really takes you to

267
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
His 50s

268
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
But shauna na clearly is the worst

269
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Of it right

270
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Because we

271
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I like Fonzie

272
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I love Henry Winkler

273
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I got no problem with any of that

274
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I got no copy of a copy to

275
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
We're gonna shooby dooby

276
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
To the main street pop

277
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
And also see the fantasy land hop

278
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
And I'm like kill me

279
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Kill me

280
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
But you know Fonzie may have stolen the bit

281
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
From Bowman from Bowser here

282
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Because it started

283
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
It's like a year later or something

284
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
So maybe he stole it

285
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I'm not saying I know that

286
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Bowser looks like John Casavetti

287
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
John Casavetti

288
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
With no charisma

289
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Like John Casavetti is a very

290
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Good like interesting

291
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Kind of weird guy like weird

292
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Performer

293
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I don't want to be wrong here

294
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Well when is the

295
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Pilot made for love american

296
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Style

297
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Oh it doesn't start until 74

298
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
74 okay

299
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
And the love

300
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Love and the television set

301
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Later retitled love and the happy days

302
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Was 72

303
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
American Graffiti 73

304
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
So Shawna is before

305
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
All of this stuff

306
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
They are leading

307
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
We're not even out of the 60s and we're doing 50s throwback

308
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Is really interesting

309
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Here's a little

310
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Bit of history

311
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Related to everything we're talking about

312
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
And some of this

313
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I got from Jim Hill

314
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I was like did they ever do an episode

315
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
And they did a little mini episode about

316
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
The past event and he provides some very

317
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Interesting context that

318
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
So apparently I think they had

319
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
The title blast to the past and they were doing

320
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
These sorts of seasonal

321
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Events

322
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Or that ran for like a long time

323
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
That like you know blast to the past

324
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Is going to be a big deal that goes for a lot of

325
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
The year and before that they had done

326
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
A state fair thing

327
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Circus

328
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Event circus fantasy

329
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
We'll do circus fantasy

330
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
But this had been

331
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
They had been starting to do these in the mid

332
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
80s at Disneyland

333
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
As Jim said

334
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Part of the reason for these events was

335
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
To adjust

336
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Like local Disneyland

337
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Goers to the idea that Disneyland

338
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Is now open 7 days a week

339
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
All year. This was not the case

340
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Until Eisner

341
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I think Eisner era becomes

342
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
What do you mean we close the parks

343
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
That makes no sense. But then how do we teach

344
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
People to come on a Tuesday while there's this special

345
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Event

346
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
So Eisner had an

347
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Influence on this thing happening

348
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
At all but then also I think they

349
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Realized some nostalgia based

350
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Event would be good to do

351
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
And maybe it's something about eras

352
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Right and over here you know

353
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Here in frontier land

354
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
There'll be a little like 1910

355
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Zone and then the 80s or

356
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
It's in the 80s the 60s

357
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Or what in Tomorrowland or whatever

358
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
And it was all pitched to Eisner and he said just 50s

359
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
50s only that's the only thing we care about

360
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
That's all we should push

361
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
And this sort of

362
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Ties into some Eisner history

363
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Because when he was

364
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
The head of paramount pictures

365
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
He green lit Greece

366
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
And when he ran

367
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
ABC he green

368
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Lit happy days. So

369
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Eisner is sort of behind

370
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
These big pillars of 50s

371
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Throwback you know this

372
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Pop culture that kept the 50s alive

373
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
In these giant ways and

374
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Also on top of that

375
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Happy days is going there's a

376
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Pilot I love American

377
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Style episode that started it

378
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
And he

379
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
His note to Gary Marshall

380
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Early on was like I think we're

381
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Missing a big area we don't have like a greaser

382
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Guy we need a tough

383
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Greaser guy and I think that's what's going to

384
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Push this show over the top

385
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
So Eisner created

386
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
The Fonz. Eisner created the Fonz

387
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Isn't that nuts? That is nuts

388
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
No he didn't name the character

389
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I think what was in his head was a

390
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Six foot tall tough

391
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Mostly silent guy

392
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Which is now what the Fonz ended up

393
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Being but the general area

394
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Of the Fonz comes

395
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
From Eisner which this is another

396
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
One of those things this you know

397
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
So much of the Disney media

398
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
That we look at and that we're forced

399
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
To mire through so

400
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Veemently anti-Eisner

401
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
And this is where like

402
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Before even the Disney

403
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Stuff starts he created the Fonz

404
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Let's give this man that's

405
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Insane and compared to like how network

406
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Notes are today

407
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Does anybody does any

408
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Dumb executive suggest anything nearly

409
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
As good as what leads

410
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
To the Fonz that's insane

411
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Yeah probably not

412
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
A lot of other horrible ideas but

413
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Of course but they didn't

414
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
We don't remember those necessarily

415
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Compared to Eiger I mean here I'm picking the worst

416
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Of Eiger but compared to Eiger

417
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Suggesting a TV show based on

418
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Fountains of Wayne Stacey's mom

419
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Week after

420
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Week underage

421
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Sexual hijinks this will be

422
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
A huge hit

423
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Well if he gave it to Gary Marshall maybe it would have worked

424
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Maybe Gary Marshall could have made Stacey's mom

425
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
The show work I can work with this

426
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
He's an

427
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Attractive mom

428
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I like it

429
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Have you considered Penny

430
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I think Penny would knock this out of the park

431
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Tie it in

432
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Tie it in to your already successful

433
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Show she's the blackish

434
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Family's neighbor

435
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
She lives next door and sometimes they stop

436
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
By then the whole neighborhood

437
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Is a big universe of shows

438
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
He's very smart did Eiser

439
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Say also make him as cool as I was

440
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
When I was 20 something

441
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Here I have some reference photos and

442
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
It's all him

443
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
He brought the blue windbreak

444
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Put him in this blue windbreaker

445
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Or was he

446
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Switch it to a leather jacket

447
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
That's good because Fonzie

448
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Didn't wear his signature leather jacket

449
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
In the first season

450
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I think it was tan wasn't it

451
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
His windbreaker

452
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
What the fuck

453
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
That's not in the Smithsonian

454
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Fuck you windbreaker

455
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I was very

456
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Excited like 12 year old

457
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
11 12 year old we went to the Smithsonian

458
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
And I was like

459
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I gotta see Fonzie's jacket

460
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
And I gotta see the ruby

461
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Red slippers

462
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
You liked Happy Days despite not liking the 50s

463
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I liked Fonzie

464
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Happy Days aired a lot

465
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
When Nick and I first got

466
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
The rights to Happy Days

467
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
They showed it so much

468
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I watched it

469
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
It didn't stick with me like other old shows

470
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Sure sure

471
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
But you see any of it and you appreciate it

472
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
And yeah look that's an end of this 50s stuff

473
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
That is fine and good

474
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Sometimes and more

475
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Good than what we're dealing with here

476
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Now let's talk a little

477
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
You know I don't think the special

478
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Is required viewing for this

479
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Episode I think we can talk about stuff from it

480
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
But you know I don't want this to be like a

481
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Play by play of the special because there was also

482
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
This event going on

483
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
That has some stuff worth talking about

484
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I don't think I realized in my head I'm like

485
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Well this is like to get LA locals in

486
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Something different

487
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
As an excuse to go to Disneyland

488
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I didn't realize this was a national event

489
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
With a tie in to McDonald's

490
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
A national TV ad

491
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
With one of the

492
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Biggest stars of the time

493
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Wow

494
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Okay yeah that's about how

495
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Much in video form

496
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
That 15 to 30

497
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Seconds I can kind of handle that

498
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
And also little Richard

499
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Is you know great

500
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Yeah sure

501
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
He gives us all and that's a kick

502
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Ass ad for listeners who aren't looking

503
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
At that this is a giant juke box

504
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Which I think might have been part of the staging

505
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Of the whole thing

506
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
And also I mean what a good

507
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Event like besides the Disneyland stuff

508
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
McDonald's is doing throwback prices

509
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
That you could

510
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
It was like the monopoly game where you

511
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Peel and win and there were a lot of like

512
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
If you

513
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
If you peeled the right

514
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Stick or whatever you might

515
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
End up getting to go to Disneyland

516
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
For 6 dollars

517
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Back when the regular

518
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Price I think was 25

519
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Dollars that's a good

520
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Deal

521
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Right now they're doing like I think you can get

522
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
A ticket for 69 dollars because it's the

523
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
69th anniversary of Disneyland

524
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
So that's the close yeah

525
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
That's tricky for them

526
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I know they're trying to skate through this

527
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Somebody said that they're saying it's the

528
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Welcome it's the journey

529
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
To the 70th birthday of Disneyland

530
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Let's try

531
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Let's not acknowledge what year

532
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
No they are selling

533
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Pins that say 69

534
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
On it oh really but are they

535
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Any shirts or anything I don't know

536
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
They didn't have like a big 69 Disney

537
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
And Mickey like giving a thumbs up

538
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Yeah

539
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
We should find

540
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Come on down to Disneyland in 69

541
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Can you get

542
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Walk around Deadpool to

543
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Talk about 69

544
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
No 69th anniversary

545
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Walk around Deadpool has a lot of limits on him

546
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Walk around Deadpool should cuss

547
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
He should cuss

548
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Hey what's up dip shits

549
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
You know

550
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
He might say well what up dip

551
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
He might say like

552
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
If he could self censor that would be funny

553
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
That would be funny yeah

554
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Do you have

555
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Jason you've now just watched you boasted

556
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
About now having actually watched two of the

557
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Deadpool films yeah do you have a better sense of

558
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
The kind of thing he would say I

559
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Yes well

560
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I've read a fair amount of Deadpool comics

561
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
So but

562
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I like the movies I thought

563
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I mean the second one if you follow the

564
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Logic too far becomes like

565
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Wait that's a puzzle like

566
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
The first one's logic is rock solid though

567
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
No I didn't say the first one but there's

568
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Time travel elements in the second one

569
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
It's a little more convoluted I guess in the second one

570
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Yeah but I think it's just a gag

571
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Don't think about it too hard because it kind of pays

572
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Off with some jokes in

573
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
The credits but if we're

574
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Trying to expand what we know Deadpool

575
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Says beyond Chimichanga

576
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Do you have like a greater sense

577
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Of his vocabulary now

578
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I think so yeah fuck like

579
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
If Deadpool

580
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
If Deadpool and California

581
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Adventure like hey what's up fuck

582
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Now calls are like

583
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Is that the kind of thing that's what this is

584
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
He does and also he only says

585
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Chimichanga is like once or twice a movie

586
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
It is I thought it was going to be every

587
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Scene

588
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I thought it was

589
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I thought he said it a lot but he mostly

590
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Says it towards the finale

591
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Like towards the climax

592
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
That's funny you thought it was going to be in every

593
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Is there any movie where like a character says a

594
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Thing in every like a catch phrase in every

595
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Scene well I am Groot

596
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
That's true

597
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
That's at least limited yeah

598
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Yeah yeah

599
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I haven't seen the movies in a while so

600
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Yeah it's the first one especially

601
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I feel like there's some outdated

602
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
References even for the movie I like movies

603
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Fine but

604
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Look Scott we can get into like characterization of Deadpool

605
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
And what my favorite characterization of Deadpool

606
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Is and it's not quite the Ryan Reynolds

607
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Jim Carrey light

608
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Sort of delivery we could get into that

609
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Or we could talk about almost anything

610
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
That's true

611
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Alright John Bowser Bauman

612
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
These are my choices

613
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
And it's

614
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Either I hear comic book artist names

615
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Or I hear John Bowser Bauman

616
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Here's the rule Scott if you want us to get back on topic

617
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
You have to go do do do do

618
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
That could carry outside

619
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Of this episode

620
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
You know a thing we talked about

621
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
On a recent episode was like

622
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Knowing something primarily as a comedy

623
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Reference point and that's how I knew

624
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Seananah

625
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Well yes I was like why do I have

626
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Bowser from Seananah

627
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
In my head in a musical way and it's because

628
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Of Adam Sandler's Hanukkah song

629
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
This is the main way I think he is known today

630
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Bowser from Seananah

631
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
And Arthur Fonzarelli

632
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Look at that

633
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
They're on the comedy

634
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Bang Bang podcast Andy Daly

635
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
I believe is Donnie character

636
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Of like the other guy from Seananah

637
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
And just mostly

638
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
I know Seananah from him going like

639
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Like

640
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Over and over again

641
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
I remember now that I think

642
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I was saying you guys don't like 50s

643
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Do-wop stuff and I go

644
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Do you like the Heathcliff theme

645
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
That was your example of 50s music

646
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
I was like well

647
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
The Heathcliff theme is good

648
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Heathcliff Heathcliff

649
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
No one should terrorize the neighbors

650
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
You offered and you remembered

651
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
And you're willing to admit that you offered as an example

652
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Of good 50s culture

653
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
The Heathcliff theme

654
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
You know what I was

655
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
I was trying to think of like

656
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
In this special

657
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Little Anthony appears

658
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
And I like these songs that he plays

659
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
And he does think I'm going

660
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Out of my head

661
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
I'm like oh wait this I like a lot

662
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
I guess I do like 50s stuff then I look it up

663
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
That's a 60s song that came out a little later

664
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
I realized there's not

665
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
A lot from the 50s proper

666
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
A lot of I think what we imagine

667
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
In movies and TV

668
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Is like popular culture

669
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
This is what the 50s look like

670
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
It's like well it's kind of what the start of the 60s

671
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Look like

672
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
It all bleeds together

673
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
I was also in trying to conjure

674
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
50s stuff I like

675
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
I realized Everly Brothers

676
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
I like all those Everly Brothers songs

677
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
And then on the way out the door

678
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
I caught this fact that I'd never heard before

679
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Did you know that the Everly Brothers

680
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Took up on stage

681
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
At Knott's Berry Farm

682
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Yeah how about that theme park

683
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
History we never talked about

684
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
They were in the second

685
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Of three sets

686
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
In 1973

687
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
And they just broke

688
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Enough was enough

689
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Let's see Don

690
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Is clearly incapacitated

691
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Playing erratically and forgetting lyrics

692
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
In frustration Phil smashes his guitar

693
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
And says I'm tired of

694
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Being an Everly Brother

695
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
The Everly Brothers died 10 years ago

696
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
And then he stormed off stage

697
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
And then they still had to do the third set

698
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
So which

699
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
That was just Phil and Don

700
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Did not

701
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Then did a solo set and then that was the end

702
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Of 73

703
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
So there's a little bit of

704
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
That's cool

705
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
They didn't just kind of quietly

706
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Fuck you I'm leaving

707
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Backstage

708
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Fuck it I'm going on Montezuma's Revenge

709
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
And then I'm getting out of here

710
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
I was imagining him pissed on a roller coaster

711
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Like trying to clear his head

712
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
And calm down so he could drive

713
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Like on

714
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Soapbox

715
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Is it soapbox racers

716
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Wacky soapbox racers

717
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
I need to go on a wacky soapbox race

718
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Clear my head and then I'm getting the fuck out of here

719
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
No more Everly Brothers

720
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
But anyway

721
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Let me say some stuff about the

722
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Events generally

723
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Beyond the special

724
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
So let's see Big McDonald's

725
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Promotion

726
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
They as part of

727
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
They had several special events within the big event

728
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
One was

729
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
A world record

730
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Attempt at

731
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
The most hula hooping

732
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
At once

733
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
The super duper hooper

734
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
A bunch of people

735
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
A ton of people

736
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
1,200 hula hoopers

737
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
All hula hooped

738
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
In a super duper fashion in front of the castle

739
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
So that happened and then there was also

740
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
The world's biggest twist

741
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Also occurred

742
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
With Chubby Checker himself

743
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
That was even more people

744
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Those 2,000 twisters

745
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
That the world's largest twist party

746
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Both of these records

747
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Have been usurped

748
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Since

749
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
By spirited groups of people

750
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Backing up a corporation and I say good job

751
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
I mean I wouldn't know how to get

752
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
A big twist party together

753
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
A world record breaking one

754
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Could we get our listeners all to twist

755
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
At the same time one day

756
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
How long do they have to twist for

757
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Good question I don't know

758
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
What constitutes you'd have to talk to the Guinness people

759
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
We could do that I think we could do that

760
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
It's just one back and forth count

761
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
And does it count if everybody's doing it separately

762
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
In their homes or cars

763
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Or gyms

764
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
They could record it with a time stamp

765
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
On video

766
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
That's proof that everybody did it at the same time

767
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
In today's

768
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
With today's technological advancements

769
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
And in our fractured world

770
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
There's no need for everyone to be twisting in one place

771
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Isn't it more beautiful

772
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
To create the ultimate twist party

773
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Internationally

774
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
In a lot of ways

775
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
There was so much stuff going on

776
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
At this event

777
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
More than stuff happens now I feel like

778
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Is it very committed to

779
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Lots of mini events

780
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Within the big event

781
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Tomorrowland Terrace transformed into

782
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
The Rainbow Diner

783
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
There was a beach party

784
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Everybody's rocking with Goofy

785
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Which was a different show over by

786
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Small World

787
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Which I saw listed as a big show happening

788
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
In Small World Mall

789
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Small World Mall

790
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Never heard that characterization of that area

791
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
I like it

792
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Where the Disney Afternoon Avenue happened

793
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
The original

794
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Term of mall

795
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Like an outdoor promenade

796
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Taking it back to the roots

797
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Very cool

798
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
There is

799
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
I think a quick version

800
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Of that in this special where

801
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
It's in

802
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Frontierland I feel like

803
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
But Goofy and

804
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Donald are arguing about being

805
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
The big Kahuna

806
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
I think that's still in Small World

807
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
I think that's where it is

808
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
You can see that deep back there

809
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Although it's

810
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Tough because

811
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
This special

812
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
We end up having to look for

813
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
And for fun looking for old Disney specials

814
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
On YouTube a lot

815
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
If it comes straight out of your VHS

816
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Warts and all

817
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
I'm happy

818
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
We've done it quote

819
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
AI restored

820
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Get the fuck out of here

821
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
What do you mean AI restored

822
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Have you guys noticed this

823
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
This is a thing with a lot of old stuff on YouTube

824
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
That people think that you can clean it up

825
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
By running it through

826
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
So I just ran it through this filter

827
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
And then it made it all sharp

828
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
And yeah it made everybody's faces mush

829
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
And look like weird squish monsters

830
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
With strangely sharp noses

831
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
And features

832
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
The colors are fucked up on this

833
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Just put it out

834
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
On your tape

835
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Don't AI restore

836
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
This is a garbage process

837
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
This one has

838
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
The one I watched had the commercial blacks in it

839
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Like the 10 seconds

840
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
The really long

841
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Long black space

842
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
I'm feeling cranky

843
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
And cantankerous about this

844
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
I watched

845
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Some guy's home movie

846
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
And I don't think he AI

847
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Restored it

848
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
And it's pretty good footage

849
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
This shows the parade and the music performance

850
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
What it was like on the ground

851
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Yes and there's a gift shop

852
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Footage which I love

853
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Just going into the different shops or whatever

854
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
In the description he complains about

855
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Splash Mountain going away

856
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
But other than that everything is pretty good

857
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Video wise to look at

858
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Yeah Jane was

859
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
In the background

860
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Like recent like one or two hours

861
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Like home movies

862
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Disney World

863
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
And Universal like 91

864
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Or 92

865
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
And just a raw rip

866
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Right from VHS and upload it

867
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
And that's good shit

868
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
At the Rainbow Diner they would have

869
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Like a different show too

870
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
And there was a woman in a red dress

871
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Who would run around while she was singing

872
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
And sit on all the dads

873
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Laps and like touch

874
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Their faces like very aggressively

875
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
And I was like

876
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Let's get back to this

877
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Let's bring this back to Disneyland

878
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
I started getting really fired up

879
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
About it

880
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
But I was interested to see

881
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
We should go let's go this weekend we're gonna go

882
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Hey why don't we go

883
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Pack up the trailer we're going

884
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Let's go today

885
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
It's interesting though cause like I wonder

886
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
What year that they were like

887
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
You cannot touch the guests anymore

888
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
When did that go away?

889
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
What year? Cause obviously like in modern

890
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
There's no performers touching a guest

891
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Anymore at Disneyland I assume

892
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
But like this had to go away

893
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
I don't know if something happened or if it was just

894
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Maybe it was recent maybe somebody out there

895
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Knows the answer when did Disney say

896
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
By the way you cannot touch the guests if you're a performer

897
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Something tells me it was Biden

898
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Oh is it Biden? Oh yeah maybe it was

899
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Maybe at the start of his term

900
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
He slipped that into a big bill

901
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
And nobody noticed

902
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
It's in Build Back Better

903
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Oh it's in Build Back Better

904
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
No aggressive face touching

905
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
No love for the dads

906
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
We love our dads

907
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
But we don't show them love

908
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
I would be pretty upset if a character

909
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Just started touching my face

910
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
This is a woman

911
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
It wasn't even like Mickey or Minnie

912
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
I guess you hug the characters

913
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
If they want

914
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
But as far as a human performer

915
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Sitting on a dads lap

916
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
In the middle of the day are you kidding me

917
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
There's no way that's happening ever again

918
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
That's not going to be

919
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
What I can't tell is if you are

920
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Mike if you're like good

921
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
This filth is gone or if you are

922
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Pining for a bygone era

923
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
That's the conflict in all of us isn't it

924
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
This shouldn't be happening

925
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
But oh

926
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
If only a performer would come and touch me with one finger

927
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
On the forehead

928
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
It's a weird

929
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Struggle we all have right?

930
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
If it's in me it's deep deep

931
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Deep down in me

932
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
It's less at the forefront I'd say

933
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
But okay

934
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
It's so funny

935
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Because the 80's were not that far removed

936
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
From the fit

937
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
It was only 30 years

938
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
And I wish there was a parade on Main Street

939
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Right now where everyone's dancing

940
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
To like Maisie Star

941
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
They're dancing

942
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
To the hits of 1994

943
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
It is interesting in general because I think there's

944
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Like there's I don't think there'll ever be

945
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Like a big revival

946
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
That sweeps the nation

947
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
There's not going to be like popular music

948
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Like Big Band again or something

949
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Because there's just pockets of

950
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Revivals happening now

951
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
And you can just go and choose whatever

952
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
I'm sure there's somebody doing

953
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
50's music right now that's 25

954
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Years old

955
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Can I just check something really fast

956
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Maisie Star

957
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
I had a feeling

958
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Okay I had heard both

959
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Just checking I wasn't sure myself

960
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
That song had a revival

961
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Because a few seasons in

962
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
The Riverdale gang

963
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Goes to prom and they slow dance

964
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
To that song

965
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
That's why you remember that

966
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Then I started to really like that song

967
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
I forgot about that song

968
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
But I think the Zoomers

969
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Also like

970
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
That's one where it's like a two day

971
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Like it just gets a ton of Spotify

972
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Streams and Tiktok videos

973
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
But yeah I don't know if

974
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Like we'll ever have like a full night

975
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Like indie rock and stuff

976
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
There's so much stuff you can listen to that sounds like

977
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Early 90's rock and roll

978
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
But it's not on the radio

979
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
It's not sweeping the nation like

980
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Brian Setzer Orchestra did or

981
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Big Bad Voodoo Daddy where it was like

982
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
This is one of those like

983
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
In the 90's no one on

984
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Earth was calling it rock and roll

985
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
This is the most perma 60's

986
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Brain you have

987
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
In the 90's Nirvana rock and roll

988
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Some good old

989
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Stone Temple Pilots here with some good old

990
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Fashion rock and roll

991
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Mr. Rock and roll is in this

992
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Special

993
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
That's a good point but it doesn't help Mike's case

994
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Oh it doesn't at all

995
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
1996

996
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
1996 Wilco's being there

997
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Jeff Tweedy is a fairly young man

998
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
He talks about rock and roll

999
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
In the songs a couple of those songs

1000
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Well that's one band yes that's where he's at

1001
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Musically am I crazy with this are you

1002
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
This is one of these things it's just like a needle

1003
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
In my brain is the rock and roll

1004
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
That's really what it is

1005
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
You really do rock and roll

1006
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Rock and roll is fun to say

1007
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
You know I would say boy you know Pavement

1008
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
For my money has to be one of the great rock and

1009
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Rock and roller bands

1010
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
I don't say rock and rollers like

1011
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
In a casual conversation I would say you know one of my

1012
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
New favorite rock and rollers are

1013
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
I'm really interested boy genius

1014
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
They really are great rock and rollers

1015
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
There is a cut off

1016
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
What is the cut off of rock and roll then

1017
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Smash Mouth

1018
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Rock and roll I think it is rock and roll

1019
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
I mean I guess boy genius is kind of rock

1020
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
And roll it's just very like low key

1021
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
I don't know it's sadder

1022
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
A lot of it is sad

1023
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
A lot of the Phoebe Bridgers music is sad but is it rock

1024
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
And roll I don't know is it rock

1025
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Even what would I call it I'm not sure

1026
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
I know I know I like

1027
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Saying rock and roll though and I don't think

1028
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
I shouldn't take this away from me it's just a big

1029
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
It's a big semantics argument

1030
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Hey hey my my rock and roll will never die

1031
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
That's my motto

1032
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
When it comes to the phrase rock and roll

1033
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
More so than the music

1034
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
I would love to hear Mr. Rock and roll go like

1035
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
We've got a new song from Phoebe Bridgers

1036
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Coming right up

1037
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Tay off in Kehoe

1038
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Is he alive?

1039
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
That was another question I had

1040
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Is Mr. Rock and roll still alive?

1041
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Well rock and roll will never die

1042
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
I know that

1043
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
But Mr. Rock and roll can die

1044
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Because he's a DJ from K-earth that they bring out

1045
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
In one of these specials or in the special

1046
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
I should say

1047
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
I thought Mr. Rock and roll

1048
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Was Alan Freed

1049
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
The DJ who is name checked

1050
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
I believe the guy

1051
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
There's a movie called Mr. Rock and roll

1052
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
The Alan Freed story

1053
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
But somebody says Brian Byrne

1054
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
From K-earth is Mr. Rock and roll

1055
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
They refer to him as Mr. Rock and roll

1056
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
A number of times

1057
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Unless he picked up the moniker

1058
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
I'm seeing him also

1059
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
But that doesn't seem fair

1060
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
I feel like there was a lot

1061
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Of Mr. Rock and roll

1062
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
He has registered the trademark

1063
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
So he owns it

1064
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
While it's associated with Alan Freed

1065
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
He's the only one

1066
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Who is legally Mr. Rock and roll

1067
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
So I can't argue with that

1068
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
I'm Mr. Rock and roll

1069
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
That's what I feel about it

1070
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Call me Mr. Rock and roll

1071
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Because I like the phrase rock and roll

1072
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
So fuck you Brian and Alan Freed

1073
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
I don't care what you did, who you discovered

1074
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
I'm Mr. Rock and roll from now on

1075
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Do you consider, let's go into new metal

1076
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Do you consider Papa Roach rock and roll

1077
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
It is rock and roll

1078
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
That's what it is ultimately

1079
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
It's all rock and roll

1080
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
How many Papa Roach fans are like

1081
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Oh man, let's go see some goddamn fucking rock and roll tonight

1082
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
I wanna rock

1083
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
That's different

1084
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
But that's what it means, rock and roll is the part of the phrase

1085
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Papa Roach doesn't roll, Papa Roach never rolled

1086
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Not once

1087
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
I don't know about that, I haven't listened to a lot of Papa Roach

1088
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
I haven't either

1089
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
I know the hits, they may roll

1090
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Point me to some deep cuts where Papa Roach rolls

1091
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Cut my life in two pieces

1092
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Let's all go rock and roll

1093
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
That's the lyric, yeah

1094
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Would you say Mike

1095
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
It's still rock and roll to you

1096
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
That's what the song is about

1097
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
He's right

1098
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Billy Joel was right

1099
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
It's still rock and roll

1100
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
These artists who said these phrases

1101
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
40 years ago

1102
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Are still right

1103
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
People go new wave and he goes

1104
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
New wave, what are you kidding me

1105
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
This is rock and roll to me

1106
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
And that's how I feel

1107
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
What a cool opinion

1108
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Let's arc and back to what Billy Joel

1109
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Said

1110
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
I take a lot of life advice from

1111
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
And philosophy and wisdom from

1112
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
And by the way, I'm sorry about your recent DUI in the Hamptons

1113
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Well, Billy did it

1114
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
You had to do it

1115
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
No, he hasn't gotten one

1116
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
No, Mike did

1117
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Oh, you did, okay

1118
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Billy Joel is like

1119
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Hey, how about some rock and roll music

1120
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
At his own stage at Madison Square Garden

1121
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
And it's like, please welcome Papa Roach

1122
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Wait, what?

1123
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Did he do that?

1124
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
He's saying like if Billy Joel is trying to be hip

1125
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
He brings some hip

1126
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
He's had Olivia Rodrigo

1127
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Yeah, that's what I mean

1128
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Hip music like Olivia

1129
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
She rocks

1130
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
She does rock and roll music

1131
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
I also, as we're on this point

1132
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
I disagree with hip

1133
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
I think calling something hip is the least

1134
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Hip way

1135
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
I think you prove you are not hip by saying that

1136
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Olivia Rodrigo, now that's hip

1137
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
That's some hip cat stuff

1138
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
That's hip drive there

1139
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Hip cat is really what you're looking for

1140
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
She is a hip cat

1141
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
That's what I would say, Olivia Rodrigo

1142
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
She's cool

1143
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Can I see your badge?

1144
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
What?

1145
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
He's calling me a cop

1146
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
How do you do, fellow kids and all that

1147
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Listening to some nifty music

1148
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Like Chapel Rowan, are ya?

1149
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
I heard that tip from my pal Jason Sheridan

1150
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Anyway

1151
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
The new Beba Doobie song

1152
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
What?

1153
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
There's an incubus sample

1154
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
That I just was made aware of

1155
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
What's Beba Doobie?

1156
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
She's an artist, she's probably in her 20s

1157
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
You weren't quoting Sha Na Na with that?

1158
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Beba Doobie

1159
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
It does sound like a Sha Na Na song though

1160
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Hey Dua Lipa

1161
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
A lot of the modern artists sound like

1162
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Sha Na Na songs

1163
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
That's why it's all rock and roll

1164
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
It all sounds like that

1165
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Do you know the Hot to Go dance?

1166
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
The what?

1167
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
The Chapel Rowan

1168
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
H-O-T-T-O-G-O

1169
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
I know that

1170
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
You know this dance

1171
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
I know the dance a little

1172
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Who's hip for Jason or I?

1173
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Jason

1174
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Jason by a lot

1175
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Which is crazy because I wouldn't call Jason hip either

1176
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
I wouldn't

1177
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
I think by far Jason

1178
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
That's okay

1179
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
I'm more of a classic guy

1180
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Who's sort of timeless in a lot of ways

1181
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Jason is hip

1182
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Jason's going to fade out though

1183
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Faster because he's so hip

1184
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
He's going to become more obsolete

1185
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
He's too much hip to handle, he's going to burn out

1186
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
The human body can't handle that much hipness

1187
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
I know all about the Rizzler and Big Justice

1188
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
And all the families on TikTok

1189
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Doing videos that I don't

1190
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Understand

1191
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Let's be clear, he doesn't understand it

1192
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
But he knows it, he can say the names of it

1193
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Mr. Rock and Roll

1194
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
That's my name from now on

1195
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
That will help with the hip cause

1196
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
If it's long enough

1197
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
I could just start calling myself

1198
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
The Nature Boy

1199
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Well there's been multiple Nature Boys

1200
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
You want to be associated with the Nature Boy

1201
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
With Ric Flair?

1202
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
No, I'm taking it back

1203
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
We're stealing people's names

1204
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
If it's like someone did it 40 or 50 years ago

1205
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
It's like fair game

1206
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
It's the wrestling

1207
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Copyright

1208
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Now Jason is apparently the Nature Boy

1209
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
And I'm the Noid

1210
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Oh shit

1211
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
There might only be a Noid

1212
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
I'm the Noid

1213
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
What else about this?

1214
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
His weird

1215
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Open mic night standup

1216
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Where do they find these

1217
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Where do they find these

1218
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Cafeteria workers

1219
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
And that is 5 minutes after

1220
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
These guidance counselors always telling you

1221
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
What to do, hey

1222
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
If they knew what to do

1223
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
They would have a better job than guidance counselors

1224
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
These hair nets

1225
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
So the special just to be clear

1226
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Mainly

1227
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Strings together

1228
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
50's music performances

1229
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Some from little Anthony

1230
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Authentic performer

1231
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
From the era

1232
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Some are like the kind of the doo-wop groups around Disneyland

1233
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
And they show a lot of the parade

1234
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
The main street hop

1235
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
It was the main

1236
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
I'd say big show piece

1237
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Of this Disneyland event

1238
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
But it's all strung together with these

1239
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Bowser from Sha Na Na

1240
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Who's like what he's like it's sleeveless shirt

1241
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
It's black sleeveless shirt

1242
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
And slick back hair

1243
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
And yeah he's that guy

1244
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
He's a sub Fonzie right

1245
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
And I guess I didn't know that was his deal

1246
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
Is that he is like a the way things used to be

1247
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Type standup

1248
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
I knew about like

1249
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Bowser is like grease I didn't know

1250
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
He might be playing up to it in the

1251
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Special the cold open

1252
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
I think is worth watching

1253
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Yeah you alerted us to that I had watched it

1254
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
When you texted me you were like oh my god this opening

1255
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
So then I was anticipating it and it didn't let me down

1256
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
That it's him

1257
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
I don't think I recognized him at first

1258
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
Imagine that I didn't recognize Bowser

1259
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
But he

1260
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
He's like fixing a car

1261
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
He's just in front of a house with a car

1262
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
It's like the cheapest little set up you're seeing

1263
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
And he's he says like

1264
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Don't you

1265
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
You ever want to just sometimes

1266
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
Get out of the 80s

1267
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Go back to a time

1268
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
When Madonna

1269
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Wait what

1270
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
I remember that one line

1271
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Madonna and child

1272
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
We said with twisted sister

1273
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
What would happen when

1274
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Parents would come home after your sister

1275
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Was babysitting or something

1276
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Twisted sister in

1277
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
My 88 we're still we got a

1278
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
I'm sick of it I'm so sick of

1279
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Twisted sister everywhere

1280
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
I go there are some lines

1281
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
In over

1282
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Like just a black screen and they do

1283
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Say the computers are out

1284
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
And I'm like very funny we just had

1285
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
A giant computer outage what you're saying

1286
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
That history repeats itself

1287
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Now this I don't know when

1288
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
This episode yeah this might come out in a while

1289
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Well

1290
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
I think it was still impactful

1291
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
I think people still be talking about the crowd strike

1292
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Outage because

1293
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Good justification actually you know

1294
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
What's crazy is that the 50s

1295
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
To the 80s were actually as long

1296
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
Ago as the crowd strike outage

1297
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Was from when you're hearing this

1298
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
Time kind of folds in you sort of forget

1299
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Weird yeah

1300
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
Because

1301
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
When a time when Madonna

1302
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
And child weren't a rock

1303
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Singer and her ex

1304
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Husband

1305
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
Is it Sean Penn at this time

1306
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
Is that who we're talking about

1307
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Sean Penn is like Sean Penn

1308
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Is like a child is what he's

1309
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Saying so actually really

1310
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
He's planning for religion

1311
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
In the 50s when we all

1312
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
When the Virgin Mary

1313
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
When there weren't the dirty songs about

1314
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Virgins we all just worshiped

1315
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
The greatest virgin of all

1316
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
They got these crucifix

1317
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
Now instead of Jesus this fucking

1318
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Alpha there

1319
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Alpha puppet

1320
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Why is everybody talking about this alien

1321
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
See an alien

1322
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Or a puppet make up your mind

1323
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
I don't even understand

1324
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
The show concept I guess

1325
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Harry and the Endersons

1326
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
I'm done good with Harry

1327
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
He's scary oh thank you

1328
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
With time when we had Harry Truman

1329
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Not Harry and the Endersons

1330
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
What's your problem dude

1331
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
One is about when a heavyweight

1332
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
A time when a heavyweight champ

1333
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
Is scarier than his wife

1334
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Like what was this

1335
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Was this a Mike Tyson

1336
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
I don't know what he's

1337
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
Good news for Bowser that if he was

1338
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
Frustrated with this time and the pop culture

1339
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Of the time it all soon imploded

1340
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
And none of it is anything we even

1341
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
Remember or know what he's talking about

1342
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Yeah this whole

1343
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
Event let me ask

1344
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
Obviously you don't like 50s

1345
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
In general but this whole

1346
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Event feels cheap to me

1347
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
When you look at like the way that the jukebox

1348
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
Is set up on the stages

1349
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
It looks kind of low rent

1350
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
Even though there's a lot of stuff going on

1351
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Think about it as on the spectrum of Disney

1352
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Parades

1353
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
They're tall set pieces

1354
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
They're pretty big and I think they

1355
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
I didn't watch a video of the full

1356
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Parade but I read that they were like

1357
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Here's a big platter of records

1358
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
And here's a big

1359
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
This float looks like a drive in

1360
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
Movie scene

1361
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Within if you're

1362
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Maybe it doesn't pop on TV

1363
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
But I bet if you were there watching the parade

1364
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
You'd think these are pretty big parade floats

1365
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
The parade actually looks better than everything else

1366
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
I guess maybe what it is

1367
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
It feels so different than what Disneyland does now

1368
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
And it feels like such a weird

1369
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Thing to overlay on Disneyland

1370
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
That it's just like

1371
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
It's jukebox and 50s and you're like

1372
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
And then they're playing different music when you get there

1373
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
It gives it a different vibe

1374
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Which I like but it also kind of

1375
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
Feels low rent to me at the same time

1376
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
I'm not even saying low rent is a bad thing I guess

1377
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
I'm just saying it's like

1378
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Well we're maybe also in a time

1379
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
When

1380
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
This is pre

1381
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
They start doing things like the Lion King

1382
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Celebration where there's a big pride

1383
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
Rock float and it stops and all

1384
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Show happens in mainstream and it looks like

1385
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
The movie I don't think we've

1386
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
Done a lot of massive

1387
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
Temporary

1388
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
Build

1389
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
I think you got to view it from like well at the time

1390
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
This was a pretty committed

1391
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
To overlay

1392
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Not to be defending it

1393
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
I know what you're saying that it's kind of chintzy

1394
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
But I think they hadn't done a lot of this nature

1395
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Yeah

1396
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
We recently of course talked about the country bears

1397
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
As far as recordings could come out

1398
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
Years later we don't know

1399
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
But I guess also though

1400
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
I do like it because

1401
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
They would never do this again in Disney

1402
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
I feel like

1403
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
There's songs that they probably don't own

1404
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
In the park

1405
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Celebrating the fifth

1406
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
There's no opportunity there for synergy

1407
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
They don't have

1408
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Happy days on the air or something

1409
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
Where they have to celebrate the fifties

1410
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
You're right

1411
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
It's Star Wars

1412
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
It all has to be

1413
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
It's Pixar thing

1414
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
At Disneyland

1415
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
It's all stuff that they own

1416
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
Guess what's coming to Disneyland

1417
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Right

1418
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
So the idea that it would be some sort of

1419
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Unrelated tie in

1420
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Or unrelated event

1421
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
To unrelated Disney event

1422
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Is cool and that makes me also feel like

1423
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
It's different from anything they'll ever do again

1424
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
I don't know if there's a good equivalent

1425
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Like what I would want them to do

1426
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
I can't think of a good pitch off the top of my head

1427
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
They're going to

1428
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
It's Disney's big celebration of like

1429
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
Late nineties Miami

1430
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Jock jams

1431
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
I would like that

1432
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
That would be good

1433
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
The real

1434
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
The real McCoy at Disneyland

1435
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Would be awesome

1436
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
And that's what

1437
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
Gets me high

1438
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
Had a way

1439
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Yeah

1440
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
This summer at Disneyland had a way

1441
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
That's awesome

1442
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
That's not going to happen

1443
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
Oh no I think it's going to come out

1444
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
But I was talking about like an alien invasion

1445
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
At Disneyland or something

1446
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
Which would be cool like an event at night

1447
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
For Halloween

1448
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
With aliens

1449
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
But it would have to be like the aliens from Toy Story

1450
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Or something

1451
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
It just feels like

1452
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
We're in a world where we'll never get

1453
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
Something truly unique

1454
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Even this

1455
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Even in an overlay way or even some

1456
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Limited time events

1457
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
Even something you said is chintzy

1458
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
Which is annoying

1459
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
We should still be pining for

1460
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
We should still want something like this

1461
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
Alien invasion Toy Story aliens

1462
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
That might be on board for us

1463
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
Because they're cute

1464
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
The discussion we had is that the aliens could be scary

1465
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
That's what we were talking about

1466
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
This on a second gate

1467
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
Tomorrowland 2055

1468
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
Yeah

1469
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
It was like Henson, Labyrinth, Dark Crystal

1470
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Puppet like

1471
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
And they're just horrific

1472
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
I said maybe they could be attractive

1473
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
They could be hot aliens

1474
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
That was my plus up to it

1475
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
But I don't know if we figured out a really good middle ground

1476
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Could they be both horrific and hot?

1477
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Sure

1478
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
I don't know what it looks like

1479
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
But if you want to draw that up

1480
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
As long as they sit on Dad's lap

1481
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
That's your other requirement

1482
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
If the aliens could flirt with Dad

1483
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
By brushing their

1484
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Three-fingered hand

1485
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
Across Dad's face

1486
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
That would be beautiful

1487
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
But the only sound they make is a blood-curdling scream

1488
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
Okay, sure

1489
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
But louder

1490
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
Obviously

1491
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
It translates to come up and see me sometime

1492
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
There I did one

1493
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
Sorry, I'm stealing your

1494
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
We're all stealing other people's names

1495
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
And I'm stealing your catchphrase

1496
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
Which is also stolen

1497
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
So yeah

1498
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
I also just was like

1499
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
They used to do

1500
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
Weirder stuff

1501
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
And it'll never happen again

1502
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
Characterizing this as weird

1503
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
I'm not sure I agree

1504
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
I did say weirder

1505
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
So that's the Disneyland scale of weird

1506
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
Okay, right

1507
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
We're always dealing with grading

1508
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
There's levels

1509
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
Let me talk about one part of the special that jumped out

1510
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
Which is you get a music

1511
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
Performance in that

1512
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
Carnation gardens kind of stage

1513
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
And this is a thing

1514
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
Where you get the characters

1515
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
We get to see the characters

1516
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
At like a malt shop

1517
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
Counter

1518
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
Mickey and Minnie and Donald and Goofy

1519
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
And they're all in their sweaters

1520
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
And Mickey's in a letterman jacket

1521
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
And Minnie's in a poodle skirt

1522
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
And he's got like

1523
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
M written in cursive

1524
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Like Laverne and Shirley

1525
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
And they perform an

1526
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
Acceptable 50s

1527
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
Kind of routine

1528
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
And then it ends

1529
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
And Mickey talks

1530
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
And I'm like, yes, wrong Mickey

1531
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
Wrong Mickey is back

1532
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
This is a piece of wrong Mickey

1533
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
Content that I have been missing

1534
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
And he

1535
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
Says

1536
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
I didn't write it down exactly

1537
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
But it's something about

1538
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
Alright, let's go win the big game

1539
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
Disney High is number one

1540
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
Disney High

1541
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
We have new mythology

1542
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
The characters all go to Disney High

1543
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
So they're all teenagers now

1544
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
In this version

1545
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
Which is great

1546
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
As Muppet Babies and Flintstone

1547
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
Babies have taught us

1548
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
All your characters who you love

1549
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
Also were babies together

1550
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
And probably went to elementary school

1551
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
They've all been with each other

1552
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
Their whole lives

1553
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
I think about this era of

1554
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
High school

1555
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
Of the primaries in high school

1556
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
So yeah, I guess you could think of it

1557
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
They just went back in time a little bit

1558
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
I was thinking if you have

1559
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
Geez Mick, if you haven't

1560
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
Are you

1561
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
What do they call being exclusive

1562
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
Going steady

1563
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
If they

1564
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
I notice you and Minnie aren't going steady

1565
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Do you mind if I take her out

1566
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
To the mulch shop

1567
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
Go sit on it

1568
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Go soak your head

1569
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Go soak your head

1570
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
By sit on it I mean this

1571
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
My comb that's actually a blade

1572
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Sit on it right now

1573
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
I'm sticking it up

1574
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
It's a blade up on the chair

1575
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
Sit down on this Goofy

1576
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
You, me

1577
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
We're drag racing down Main Street

1578
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Right now

1579
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
Get your hat right, we're going

1580
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Geez, you shouldn't be drunk for that Mick

1581
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
Don't tell me you want a tattoo

1582
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
It gives me the courage to go faster

1583
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
Courage you don't have

1584
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
See that is a very stressful scene

1585
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
In American Graffiti where they destroy

1586
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
At least one car

1587
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
Oh where oh where

1588
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
And Harrison Ford, young Harrison Ford

1589
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
Has my baby been

1590
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
There's a Mickey version of that song

1591
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
Maybe there was like a primary

1592
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
Who we forgot like Petey Pig

1593
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
If you were with the characters

1594
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
In Disney High days

1595
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
Petey Pig was in the group

1596
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
But then he went after Minnie

1597
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
Got into a gnarly drag race

1598
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
Mickey cheated

1599
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
Rammed him and that was the end of

1600
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Petey Pig

1601
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
Donald take some pieces out of the engine

1602
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
Here's what I want you to do

1603
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
Cut the brakes

1604
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
This never happened

1605
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
Zip that beak okay

1606
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
Then he's

1607
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
Then Petey Pig is burning

1608
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
Alive and Minnie's like

1609
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
Oh no oh geez

1610
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
You still want to go out with him now

1611
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
Look how bad of a driver he is

1612
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
Would you rather go out with a guy

1613
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
Who's not

1614
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
A shard corpse

1615
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Who's captain of the football team

1616
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
And currently alive

1617
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
Suddenly I'm looking a little better

1618
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
Aren't I

1619
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
God he never changed he was always like that

1620
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
Mickey

1621
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
He never changed

1622
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
The anger issues started in middle school

1623
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
And by Disney High

1624
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
They were raging

1625
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
I mean how are you going to get to the top though

1626
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
If you don't have a personality like that

1627
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
How do you rise to the top of the cartoon heap

1628
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
You need confidence

1629
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
You need drive

1630
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
Principal Walt tried to expel me

1631
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
I put my blade up to that old

1632
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
Bastard's neck

1633
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
You could expel me

1634
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
Then you'd be dead

1635
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
You smell like booze Walt

1636
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
You shouldn't be at school

1637
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
If you smell like liquor

1638
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
Who are you to talk

1639
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
I can turn on this intercom right now

1640
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
One flip of this button

1641
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
And everybody will know

1642
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
Your breath reeks Walt

1643
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
You just had your last laugh

1644
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
You just laughed

1645
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
For the last time

1646
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
To do run run run

1647
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
To do run run

1648
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
I was going to go

1649
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
There were cars parked in the front

1650
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
Of Disneyland too

1651
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
Which made it look kind of like a car show or something

1652
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
I think that's maybe part why

1653
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
I thought it looked low rent

1654
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
It was almost like a showroom

1655
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
What would happen in a park

1656
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
A couple cars just parked right by the

1657
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
Mickey face

1658
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
By the flowers

1659
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
I think that was a hit though

1660
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
I think people were like wow

1661
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
You know certain types of guys

1662
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
You see people

1663
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
People of a certain age

1664
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
Going to 50's cars

1665
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
Flies to honey

1666
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
I'm not one to talk about that

1667
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
Because when the Bob's big boy

1668
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
If I see old cars

1669
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
Driving along the street

1670
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
I'm like whoa that's a cool car

1671
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
But my first instinct is like Jay

1672
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
Jay Leno

1673
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
Are you driving that

1674
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
Sometimes it is him

1675
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
Sometimes it is

1676
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
They get together what Friday night?

1677
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
Saturday night? Friday night cuff up your jeans

1678
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
Slick back your hair head down there brother

1679
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
I think you're a couple big boy nights

1680
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
Away from being a 50's guy

1681
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
I don't like rockabilly

1682
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
Either

1683
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
I think I don't know

1684
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
Try to puff up that hair see what happens

1685
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
You can do a whole thing

1686
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
A little setzer

1687
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
Grow those sideburns

1688
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
I know you like setzer you're not too far from it

1689
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
You're a setzer guy

1690
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
I knew the Bryan setzer orchestra

1691
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
They were doing big band music

1692
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
You don't like rock this town?

1693
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
I do actually like rock this town

1694
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
You like this stuff I think

1695
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
He was really close

1696
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
I think it's almost like

1697
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
Maybe you don't like poodle skirts

1698
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
There's some part of it you don't like

1699
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
But actually you are a 50's guy

1700
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
I know we did

1701
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
The Ellie Greenwich leader of the pack

1702
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
Jukebox musical in high school

1703
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
Did you perform it?

1704
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
I was just ensemble

1705
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
They would just hand out

1706
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
They would like hey come on Jeff

1707
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
Like you know Ellie's ex husband Jeff

1708
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
Sorry I don't know this

1709
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
I know that name as you wrote that song

1710
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
This is a musical

1711
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
With very little story

1712
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
And it's mostly

1713
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
I think it made me

1714
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
I like the songs

1715
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
I was trying to understand

1716
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
Barely any story

1717
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
They were brill building songwriters

1718
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
People wrote a lot of the early rock and roll songs

1719
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
But it's about the life of

1720
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
It's about the life of Ellie Greenwich

1721
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
Yeah

1722
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
And I think

1723
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
He knows more stuff

1724
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
I know I didn't particularly like it

1725
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
But like

1726
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
He thinks he doesn't like the 50's stuff

1727
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
Because it's 30 years after his era

1728
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
His general era being the 1920's

1729
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
But I think you do like the 50's

1730
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
He resents rock and roll

1731
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
For shutting out the old music that he prefers

1732
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
Where are all the tucks and tails

1733
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
Why do all these cardigans have letters on them

1734
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
I really should

1735
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
Just real quick I haven't brought him up on the show

1736
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
And I've seen him a couple times at the smokehouse

1737
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
There's a performer named Jimmy Angel

1738
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
That guest of the show Trevor Zamet

1739
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
Has turned me on to

1740
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
Who's an 89 year old man who does 50's music

1741
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
The first Saturday of every month at the smokehouse

1742
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
And he hates the Beatles

1743
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
Because he feels that they ruined rock and roll

1744
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
That's how hardcore he is

1745
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
When he says he loves the 50's

1746
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
That's an opinion

1747
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
Yes there's still

1748
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
I would say my own mother is a person of that

1749
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
Who has that kind of opinion

1750
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
But who's not 89 years old

1751
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
Not 89 years old but she was

1752
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
Oh these Beatles I don't know about these Beatles

1753
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
This slightly longer

1754
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
Hair than other people have

1755
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
Right now

1756
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
But then he always says Jimmy always says 50's is best

1757
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
Or whatever but then he does like Del Shannon's

1758
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
Runaway and I'm looking it up I go this is from 1961

1759
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
This is what I'm saying

1760
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
So there are hangover

1761
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
Songs that people who love the 50's

1762
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
Consider 50's even though

1763
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
They were in the 60's

1764
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
Culturally it's 50's that's ours we claim that

1765
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
Leader of the pack

1766
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
That's interesting

1767
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
Is there a video of that?

1768
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
No

1769
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
New York Times writer Frank Rich called the show

1770
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
An embarrassment

1771
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
Jason did?

1772
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
I wondered who that guy was

1773
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
I wondered who that guy was

1774
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
Taking a lot of notes

1775
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
It would have been fine save for one

1776
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
Member of the ensemble who was

1777
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
Distractingly flat footed

1778
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
He couldn't find his leather jacket

1779
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
When they did the leader of the pack

1780
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
Number yes someone else took it

1781
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
That's why I had a black t-shirt

1782
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
On and sunglasses good enough

1783
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
Who cares

1784
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
If we're in this 50's area

1785
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
Can I throw out one more little ramp

1786
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
That's something you just said Mike

1787
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
You referenced poodle skirts

1788
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
I have a theory perhaps an easily disproven theory

1789
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
But I'm going to throw this theory out there

1790
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
I think poodle skirts are fake

1791
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
I think that's not something that was real

1792
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
That anybody actually did

1793
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
I think like a dozen people

1794
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
I think

1795
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
Maybe one famous person

1796
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
Wore a skirt with a poodle on it

1797
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
Once and then many years

1798
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
Of Halloween costume culture

1799
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
Made us think that

1800
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
Every girl every day in the 50's

1801
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
Wore a skirt with a poodle on it

1802
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
And I think it's pretend

1803
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
I think it's like now

1804
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
If you're like 11 years old

1805
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
And you kind of poke around

1806
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
What were things like a couple decades ago

1807
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
Well everybody wore their

1808
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
All the girls wore their hair in

1809
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
Pigtails with pink puffs and they wore

1810
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
Schoolgirl outfits and you go no

1811
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
One person did that

1812
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
Britney Spears only did that

1813
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
That was not a common style of the time

1814
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
That is my theory about poodle skirts

1815
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
Fake

1816
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
I bet you're on to something I don't know

1817
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
I don't have a good opinion of what the actual

1818
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
Usage

1819
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
Of poodle skirts was

1820
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
I bet it's more

1821
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
I bet you're right I bet it's also like

1822
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
The Goldberg's version of the 80's

1823
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
Where it's like

1824
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
Everyone on the Goldberg's dress is like

1825
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
A cartoonish 80's character

1826
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
And it's like that was not how everybody looked

1827
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
Yes your neighbor

1828
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
Has Duran Duran hair

1829
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
Yeah yeah

1830
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
And then your neighbor on the other side is like

1831
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
A poppin locker

1832
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
Breaking two electric boogaloo guy

1833
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
Like certainly there weren't just people

1834
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
Who were normal people

1835
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
I was alive in the 80's

1836
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
There's footage of us in the 80's

1837
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
Yeah I have some memories

1838
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
We did not look like that my parents

1839
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
Did not look like that though hair was maybe a little

1840
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
Different and you can poke fun in it

1841
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
But it did not necessarily look like

1842
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
A cartoon 80's person

1843
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
You know I wanted to talk though

1844
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
Because my dad was like

1845
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
He was like a

1846
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
Really plastic looking

1847
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
Kind of digital man

1848
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
Who would jitter a lot

1849
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
And he didn't come home a lot so he'd just send videos

1850
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
And the videos would have like a striped pattern

1851
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
Going and he would kind of go hello

1852
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
Son

1853
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
So I guess my dad was kind of a stereotypical

1854
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
80's guy

1855
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
Max Headroom type

1856
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
Max Headroom much

1857
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
Now what's that? What are you referring to?

1858
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
I'm just talking about my own father

1859
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
I don't know what you're referencing

1860
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
This is my life

1861
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
I don't really know that much but actually

1862
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
I just kind of know it as a reference

1863
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
And my mom always wore a belt

1864
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
That said boy toy

1865
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
Every day of my childhood

1866
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
My mom did too

1867
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
I think in the 90's

1868
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
In 2000

1869
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
Sock hop 50's throwback

1870
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
For like a school dance or something

1871
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
It's like alright these

1872
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
Freaks, these nasty little

1873
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
Teenagers

1874
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
Who's this character?

1875
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
This angry principal who's mad at nothing

1876
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
This is like

1877
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
The school administration

1878
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
Okay if we play tears on the

1879
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
Pillow they won't be grinding on

1880
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
Each other

1881
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
Tears on my pillow

1882
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
We don't have to play hot in here tonight

1883
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
Okay if we

1884
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
Get them all riled up

1885
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
If we play leader of the pack

1886
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
I hear that kids today are talking

1887
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
They enjoy songs about backing

1888
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
Asses up

1889
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
And ass is misspelled

1890
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
The spelling isn't good either

1891
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
There was nothing sexual in those old rock and roll songs

1892
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
No!

1893
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
That didn't rile kids up

1894
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
No Britney Spears only Andrews

1895
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
Sisters hits

1896
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
Did you have a 50's themed dance?

1897
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
At least one

1898
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
Wait a minute this character it's not

1899
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
It's not some principal this is what Jason thought

1900
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
This is what 18 year old Jason thought

1901
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
At the time

1902
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
I did not want to be there

1903
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
Like most dance I did not want

1904
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
To be there

1905
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
I wanted to be home running blockbuster

1906
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
Video movies eating General So's chicken

1907
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
Like

1908
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
What a detail

1909
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
Are you eating a lot when you're 18?

1910
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
I could be sewing it right now

1911
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
When I was like 16 or 15

1912
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
I could be eating stromboli

1913
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
And watching the fight club again

1914
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
You know

1915
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
I could be innovating

1916
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
I could be stuffing a stromboli with

1917
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
General So's chicken

1918
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
Oh boy

1919
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
That would be something

1920
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
I could be watching Memento

1921
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
That movie is backwards

1922
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
I'm innovating

1923
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
Like Christopher Nolan

1924
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
Innovated storytelling

1925
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
You're eating backwards now?

1926
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
I'm eating General So's chicken stuffed

1927
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
In an Italian stromboli

1928
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
You're the Nolan of snacking

1929
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
You're pushing the medium forward

1930
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
Pennsylvania

1931
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
What have we not gotten to here

1932
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
My other

1933
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
They show a bunch of

1934
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
This main street hop and there's kind of a medley

1935
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
Of

1936
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
Let me really isolate the kind of 50's I don't like

1937
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
What they show is a medley of

1938
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
We go together from Greece

1939
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
Who put the bomb

1940
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
And what I realized

1941
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
Here's where the heart of

1942
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
We go together is not from the 50's

1943
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
This is a nostalgia from the 50's

1944
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
As is Bowser

1945
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
I think this is what I don't like

1946
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
That song obviously has all the

1947
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
But then

1948
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
There's a part where they just do it for a lot

1949
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
Clingity clang

1950
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
A shibity shoe

1951
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
A poopity blip

1952
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
I realize my version of

1953
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
Hell is that

1954
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
If that block

1955
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
Of We go together was

1956
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
Infinite

1957
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
Or if my afterlife

1958
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
If it was otherwise paradise

1959
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
But

1960
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
Guess what

1961
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
Part of heaven is that there's a constant sock hop

1962
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
Going take a listen

1963
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
Clang de clang de clang shimity shmoo

1964
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
Bibbity blip be blip zoobity zoo

1965
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
I would choose hell

1966
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
I will take my chances on whatever

1967
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
Hell is

1968
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
That is like

1969
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
What if hell was more big band

1970
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
Sort of a big band revival

1971
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
Because I think I could deal with

1972
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
If I sometimes get a

1973
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
Ba do ba do

1974
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
I can relax to that a little bit

1975
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
But it like shimity shmoopy

1976
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
But what if they played the

1977
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
Heathcliff theme once in a while in heaven

1978
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
We cover all the 50's greats

1979
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
Heathcliff Heathcliff or that pound puppy song

1980
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
That used the let's go to the hop

1981
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
But they said let's go to the pound

1982
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
Do you remember that? Did you guys have that video?

1983
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
Just the stuffed animals

1984
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
There was a pound puppy movie

1985
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
I think it was direct to video that was like

1986
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
Let's go to the pound

1987
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
Dogs famously would not like

1988
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
To be at the pound

1989
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
That's a song you use to

1990
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
Trick dogs

1991
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
I thought that was like the main

1992
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
Theme for the

1993
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
Show but I did look it up and it's from

1994
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
It's from the movie pound puppies

1995
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
And the legend of big paw

1996
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
So we must have had the legend of big paw

1997
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
Tape and that's what I'm thinking

1998
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
I can play it I don't have to play it

1999
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
Do it at the end

2000
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
Do it when I

2001
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
Have the option of getting up and leaving

2002
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
Yeah yeah

2003
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
Have we missed anything though

2004
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
Anything about the special

2005
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
Look again this is also

2006
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
Like it's

2007
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
All this

2008
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
Introspective and mainly

2009
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
It's Bowser this is a

2010
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
Little thing and it just bothers me so much

2011
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
Is that he goes and finds like

2012
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
The doo-wop group that's cruising

2013
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
Around in one of the main street cars and harmonizing

2014
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
And like hey why don't I

2015
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
Join you for a so why don't I

2016
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
Join youse guys there's one

2017
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
It's the word is you

2018
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
The S does nothing

2019
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
You make a fool out of yourself

2020
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
Out of youse self when you talk that way

2021
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
And then

2022
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
He like hey let's do a number

2023
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
What about blue moon

2024
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
Bowser

2025
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
I believe you say

2026
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
Blue moon the enunciation

2027
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
It is on the emphasis is on

2028
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
Moon blue moon

2029
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
Blue moon god

2030
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
Why does that annoy me so much

2031
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
It's one of the worst things I've ever heard

2032
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
What about blue

2033
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
Moon that's not the way

2034
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
Like words go together

2035
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
And get said you don't put

2036
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
S's on the end of random words

2037
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
The emphasis goes on

2038
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
Moon did you go to school

2039
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
Bowser or did you put your busy

2040
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
Cutting class

2041
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
Smoking in the boys room

2042
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
Getting away from those cafeteria workers

2043
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
With the hand nets

2044
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
In their arms you eliminate

2045
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
Wobble a ref

2046
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
Oh mystery meat

2047
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
Like can we talk about

2048
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
Mystery meat for a second

2049
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
It seems to me somebody should have

2050
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
Solved that mystery so I could

2051
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
Know what I'm putting down in my

2052
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
Tum tums

2053
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
Who likes this? Why would you like

2054
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
This? I don't think anyone

2055
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
Did I don't think there was ever any audience

2056
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
Feedback on shenanah

2057
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
But shenanah had a show that ran for like three or four years

2058
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
I'd never heard

2059
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
That I've completely thank god I've completely

2060
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
Missed the shenanah show

2061
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
And did you I didn't know this

2062
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
Song that's been playing in commercials for

2063
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
Decades is the shenanah theme

2064
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
Maybe this was what is that

2065
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
Shananah shananah

2066
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
Shananah

2067
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
But that's a song that existed before them

2068
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
Isn't it I think that's shananah

2069
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
Theme song but that's also another

2070
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
Song isn't that like get a job or something

2071
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
Oh is it yeah isn't it

2072
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
So they took their theme

2073
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
Their name from the song

2074
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
Unless it's a different unless they like amended

2075
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
That but like

2076
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
Yeah that's get a job but the

2077
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
Silhouettes so they took

2078
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
Shananah from the background singers

2079
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
Of the background

2080
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
Vocals from that song yes

2081
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
Yeah they did nothing

2082
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
They did nothing I was actually even giving them

2083
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
The credit because I was like oh I like that that's

2084
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
Shananah huh well never mind

2085
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
No no unless I'd have to hear

2086
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
The version that you're talking about

2087
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
No you're probably right then it doesn't make

2088
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
Sense because I was listening to their albums and it was all

2089
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
Covers and not covers I even

2090
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
Enjoyed very much so I was surprised

2091
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
That I was like oh that actually I kind of

2092
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
Like I guess that's their theme

2093
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
I'm glad you've gotten ahead of that you didn't really care

2094
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
For Shananah because I was also

2095
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
As soon as I read that they had a variety

2096
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
Show and this is unfair of me but

2097
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
As soon as I read that detail I was like

2098
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
I got mad at you Mike

2099
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
I got mad I assumed

2100
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
That this is something that you would like

2101
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
And that's unfair that's like

2102
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
Inventing a fight in your head that isn't

2103
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
There but as soon as I saw that I'm like this is

2104
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
Some fucking madam shit I'm gonna go in there

2105
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
And Mike's gonna like it and I got

2106
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
Everybody's gonna be yelling about Shananah

2107
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
For like 30 more episodes

2108
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
Beyond this alright let's

2109
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
Let's just get you to one chocolate

2110
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
Malt with two straws

2111
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
And you share it yeah right

2112
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
I have no problem if all the stuff we're talking about I have

2113
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
No problem with malt culture

2114
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
Malt we can agree on but madam I saw

2115
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
Specifically with madam I saw madam in a sitcom

2116
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
Where her weird little legs were

2117
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
Walking that's a lot more

2118
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
Interesting than just the guy doing this

2119
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
Like

2120
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
That's a lot weirder

2121
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
To my credit

2122
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
Is it not but we are dealing with things from

2123
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
The 70's variety show

2124
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
Maybe if I had watched

2125
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
More Shananah show I would have found some clips

2126
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
And maybe that's in our future

2127
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
But no it's not

2128
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
No it's not this is the ultimate

2129
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
We were talking about wanting to put something in the club 3 poll

2130
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
That got zero votes

2131
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
Shananah variety show is a very viable option

2132
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
We want to run the experiment

2133
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
No one wants this

2134
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
I'm interested to see the Patreon

2135
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
Back end of the software

2136
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
Can get something

2137
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
Negative votes in a poll

2138
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
Yeah

2139
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
I don't want anybody to hack

2140
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
Our system but it would be

2141
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
Interesting could you take

2142
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
Votes away and can you teach me

2143
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
To do it in case I need that

2144
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
If madam sneaks into any future poll

2145
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
Just trying to get a cloud strike

2146
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
And join the Shananah poll

2147
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
You're dying

2148
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
Jason's thing this year is cloud strike

2149
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
The blue screens of death are very funny

2150
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
Scott would you rather

2151
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
Add a future cause I've brought this up before

2152
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
The Sid and Marty Croft produced

2153
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
Variety show starring the Bay City Rollers

2154
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
Or Shananah

2155
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
No one wants this

2156
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
No one is clamoring the Bay City

2157
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
Rollers

2158
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
Time moves on

2159
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
Time ignores these things

2160
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
For a reason

2161
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
We move forward we don't have to blast

2162
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
To the past

2163
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
I have a video of Bowser

2164
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
Performing seven years ago

2165
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
Oh god

2166
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
Who is this guy to talk about

2167
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
Underarm shape on lunch

2168
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
Ladies this is precisely how he

2169
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
Looks

2170
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
He's still around too

2171
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
By the way I cannot believe

2172
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
In reading the full Bowser

2173
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
Wikipedia I am shocked

2174
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
That this guy is not a major

2175
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
Maga guy

2176
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
In fact he is a big Democrat

2177
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
Donor and I'm so good

2178
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
You know what I'll lay off Bowser

2179
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
A little bit

2180
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
To his credit Shananah is kind of also

2181
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
A comedy act

2182
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
In some ways

2183
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
So he is doing it whether we think it's funny or not

2184
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
Is another story

2185
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
Clearly Jason and I are big fans of the material

2186
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
But there is no one else

2187
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
To balance him out

2188
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
So Fonz

2189
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
Fonz was a subtler character

2190
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
And he had levels he could play with

2191
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
In this instance I think you can call

2192
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
The Fonz subtle

2193
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
I think Fonz was kind of subtle

2194
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
Fonz can be subtle

2195
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000
Again Henry Winkler a very charismatic

2196
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
Performer

2197
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
We are universes apart

2198
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
I don't care that they both go

2199
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
These people are not

2200
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
In the same league

2201
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
Even though the talent level

2202
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
Is miles apart

2203
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
What if quietly

2204
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
Bowser has been a listener to this show

2205
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
The whole time

2206
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
Oh they did one where they are going to talk about me

2207
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
Oh no

2208
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
Tears on my pillow

2209
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
I got to call up little Anthony

2210
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
Who is also still alive

2211
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
I looked him up

2212
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
I love this

2213
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
I found the press kit on eBay

2214
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000
I love this art

2215
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
Or not art I should say this is a photo

2216
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
Of Mickey and Minnie

2217
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
With their 80's character

2218
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
Mascot costumes in this big red

2219
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
Some kind of car

2220
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
I should know what it is

2221
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,000
Convertible

2222
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,000
Mickey's got his sweater on

2223
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
They got a surfboard in the back

2224
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
A guitar in the back

2225
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
I would like a poster of this

2226
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
All the art and some of the

2227
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,000
Signs from this thing go up for auction sometime

2228
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
I like the logo

2229
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
I think this was probably a fun

2230
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
You could engage with this event

2231
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,000
A little bit but otherwise go about your

2232
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,000
Disneyland day

2233
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
A little bit of extra character

2234
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,000
They got legit acts

2235
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
I think the Righteous Brothers played

2236
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,000
I forget the full

2237
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
They definitely got

2238
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
Good 50's performers

2239
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
To play the big stage over

2240
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
Videopolis

2241
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,000
This was probably fun

2242
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
Bowser mentions it's going over

2243
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
Videopolis

2244
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,000
I wish they would do

2245
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
Would they ever have

2246
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
There's a question

2247
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
When was the last time they would have like

2248
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,000
An act play at Disneyland that you knew

2249
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
Like not just for some sort of

2250
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
Holiday special

2251
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,000
They used to have like Righteous Brothers

2252
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
They used to have like somewhat known

2253
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
I mean Righteous Brothers really known

2254
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
When was the last time you could see

2255
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,000
A band that was known

2256
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,000
Play somewhere at Disneyland

2257
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,000
Jim Belushi and the Sacred Hearts

2258
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
Might be the answer

2259
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
He single handedly

2260
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
Killed the

2261
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
Never again

2262
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
After that

2263
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
He rocked them too hard

2264
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
So many people were there to see the Sacred Hearts

2265
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,000
Because they're such big fans of the band

2266
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
That they probably crowded

2267
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
We can't handle it

2268
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
We can't get this level

2269
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
Of crowd surge

2270
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
The system's breaking down

2271
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
I wonder if the parks just are too crowded now

2272
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
Where if you had like a band play

2273
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
Even a moderately popular band

2274
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
That it would just be like overwhelming

2275
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
To the park? I don't know

2276
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
They don't need to do it anymore to bring

2277
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
People in? I don't know

2278
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
Yeah I don't know

2279
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
I'd be nervous if they did

2280
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
Alright, Disneyland rock and roll summers

2281
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
And then Papa Roach is playing in front of

2282
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
Sleeping Beauty Castle

2283
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
That whole park's gonna bottleneck

2284
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
Everybody's dyin' to see them roll

2285
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
There's like multiple bands playing

2286
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
At Disney that day

2287
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,000
Avenged Sevenfold would play

2288
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
Somewhere in Tomorrowland

2289
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
You'd have to have a full

2290
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
New metal night

2291
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
I would call it rock and roll but people would call it

2292
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
New metal

2293
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
New metal night at Disneyland

2294
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,000
We'd all be there

2295
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
If it was new metal night

2296
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
But that's what we want

2297
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
That's what we want something coming out of the left field

2298
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,000
That would be the equivalent of this

2299
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,000
It's still 25 years old at this point

2300
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,000
The famous

2301
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,000
The corn ever traveling bullet

2302
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,000
Will fly through Disneyland

2303
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000
They'll put it on the Tinkerbell wire

2304
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
Whoa, corn's bullet

2305
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,000
Is going through the top

2306
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000
Spire of the castle

2307
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,000
Yeah, yes we should

2308
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,000
Limp Bizkit, corn

2309
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
Ultimately still rock and roll

2310
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
Swing revival night?

2311
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
Swing revival night, okay

2312
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
Don't you dare

2313
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000
Whether we talk about that, wait a minute

2314
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
I could end the episode right now

2315
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
Before we even do the thought excerpt

2316
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
Before we even start naming the bands

2317
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
Let's do it, do we got anything else?

2318
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,000
I don't think so

2319
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
Other than naming bands

2320
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
I mean get them in while you can

2321
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
But otherwise I'm going to wrap it up

2322
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
You survived podcast
