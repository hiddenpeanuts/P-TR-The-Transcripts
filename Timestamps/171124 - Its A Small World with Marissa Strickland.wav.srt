Feral Audio.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,740
Warning. Today's episode contains a scandalous discussion of drugs at Disneyland, a thrilling

3
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:16,100
Cliff Notes-style history of H.H. Holmes and his Chicago murder house, and an alarmingly

4
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:20,780
sincere journey through It's a Small World with guest Marissa Strickland. Strap yourself

5
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:44,340
in, it's Podcast The Ride.

6
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:48,220
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, a podcast about theme parks where three men talk at each other

7
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:53,460
in a way that alienates their wives and girlfriends. We are part of Feral Audio, home of great podcasts

8
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:59,140
like Dough Boys and Teen Creeps and a whole bunch of other great things. Joining me as always,

9
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:00,140
Jason Sheridan.

10
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:01,140
Hi.

11
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:02,140
And Scott Gardner.

12
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:08,460
Hi. I think it helps to not do this around my wife because it saves her in person from

13
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:12,500
having to hear, for having to be talked at about these topics.

14
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:16,140
Yeah, I think that's why we kind of did this. We could get out of the house and then we

15
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,660
could take the burden off of our significant others.

16
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:22,220
Yeah, they can only take so much. And by the way, I don't even mean to act like they're

17
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:26,540
like so, oh my God, like Lindsay listens to a lot of this. My girlfriend, Lindsay, listens

18
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:28,100
to a ton of this stuff.

19
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:33,260
Yeah. Oh, it's primarily what Erin and I talk about and do together.

20
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:38,380
It's just that when hour five rolls around, that's when it starts to become tiresome for

21
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:39,380
her.

22
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:43,300
And you're actually in the park talking about the, complaining about the park.

23
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:48,700
Yeah, well that too. I mean, it's everywhere. It's in bed, it's in the park, it's in Red

24
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:51,580
Lobster, it's in wherever you go, it's coming.

25
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:58,140
It's in your ears here on Feral Audio, which is what this podcast is on with lots of other

26
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:01,260
great podcasts you can check out and you should.

27
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:02,760
Yes, please do.

28
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:07,700
And listeners, more importantly, Mike said, wives and girlfriends, but Jason is single

29
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:11,500
and ready to wiggle for all of you folks out there.

30
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:15,060
Well, let's bring our guest in because I want to talk about some things. We're going to

31
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:20,220
get into a whole discussion about It's a Small World, the great Disney ride.

32
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:27,580
And joining us today to talk about it is Marissa Strickland, writer, actor, improviser, lover

33
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:30,300
of things. Welcome to the show.

34
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:33,300
Oh my gosh, thank you so much for having me. I love things.

35
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,300
I wouldn't say that.

36
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:39,340
You hadn't listed her credits before. Now that I know, I'm intimidated.

37
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:42,780
That just sort of came, lover of things just sort of came in. It just seems like it does

38
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:44,140
fit, right?

39
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:49,940
I think I'm a person that wants to love in this world, so sure, I'll throw out some things.

40
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:58,100
Geez. So what a perfect topic we have. What a delightful, earnest, love worthy ride we

41
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:02,060
have today. Very excited.

42
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:06,740
But first, I just wanted to talk, Jason came in a little late today.

43
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:10,020
Oh boy, we are going to do this, huh?

44
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:13,660
Yeah, it was his birthday yesterday, so happy birthday to Jason.

45
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:14,660
Thank you very much.

46
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:20,140
And we had a nice time at a bar and Jason had, I think what, three beers?

47
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:26,900
I had three beers and I feel like I am dying.

48
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:30,400
So I just wanted to put that out there because the audience is going to sense, oh, something's

49
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,620
wrong with Jason. And I just want them to be put at ease that he's okay.

50
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:35,700
Yeah, I'm fine.

51
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:40,420
It's just that when you're in your thirties, three beers and only 10 hours of sleep will

52
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:42,620
really knock you out.

53
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:50,220
Not peaceful, not good sleep. I usually sleep like the dead. That was not the case yesterday.

54
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:56,220
I drove Jason home from this event and you made a real point out of not only I knew the

55
00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:01,800
number of the beers, you were listing stats, three beers and 9 a.m. I will happily wake

56
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:10,940
up, do some research, get in the game on today's podcast. And then you sense it was more, it

57
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:11,940
was an 11, 15?

58
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:19,380
Yeah, something like that. Yeah, you know, it's much like the blue sky process that happens

59
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:27,060
in theme park ride creation. Very early on, they've got very grand visions and eventually

60
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:32,980
they scale that back. So 9 a.m. quickly went to 11, 15 and I went, oh no, I have to be

61
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:33,980
there at noon.

62
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:36,980
I think blue sky also sticks to a schedule.

63
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:43,060
They do! Kind of, sure.

64
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:49,020
I just like the very specific announcement of the plans, which as soon as you walked

65
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:52,540
in you communicated the plans were not adhered to.

66
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:54,460
Did not happen.

67
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:58,620
You texted like at 11, 45 that you were running a little late and I was like, oh, he just

68
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:02,860
woke up. That was my assumption that you had woken up and texted that and then possibly

69
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:08,820
fell back asleep. But it was not true. So yeah, everything's fine. You're here, you're

70
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:09,820
doing all right.

71
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:16,860
But we had to have that Marin-esque moment of true confessional content to discuss your

72
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:18,300
three beer issue.

73
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,300
Oh yeah.

74
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,300
Well, that's it. Yeah, that's a feedback.

75
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:21,860
We're brave of you to go into it today, honestly.

76
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:26,500
The feedback we're getting is that they want a lot more personal dirt from us and stuff,

77
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,380
like really what's going on behind the podcast.

78
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:37,580
We'll shortly get to who my guys are, right? Who are your guys?

79
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:40,700
I assume it's Imagineers. It's Raleigh Crump.

80
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:41,700
Raleigh Crump.

81
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:44,780
Yeah, I'm sure. Joe Roady.

82
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:47,620
Both Davises. Jeff and Alice.

83
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:52,980
And head of parks and resorts, Bob Chapek as well. Disney parks and resorts.

84
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:54,980
Had a lot of Chapek talk lately.

85
00:05:54,980 --> 00:06:01,180
Why would any wife or girlfriend be alienated by the references we're pulling out here?

86
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:02,980
These names. Anyway.

87
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:03,980
Anyway, Marissa.

88
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:04,980
Hi.

89
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:05,980
Hey.

90
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:08,540
Marissa, Marissa Siklin's still here.

91
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:15,460
She's still here listening to this. Thank you for that. So what, like you love Kitsch

92
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:21,420
and Fun and theme park and do you, like what is your personal relationship with the concept

93
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:22,420
of a theme park?

94
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:28,580
Oh, that's interesting. I feel like as a child, I mean I grew up in Southern California, so

95
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:33,380
I would go to Disneyland once a year, but my parents hated theme parks. So like they

96
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:38,380
pondered off on my mom's best friend's daughter to take me to Disneyland. So we'd go like

97
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:42,100
once a year and it was like a big event, even though we lived an hour away from Disneyland.

98
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:46,660
It's like we could have easily gone much more frequently, but my parents like don't like

99
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:52,060
corporate things. They're very like, uh, like the kind of music they gave me to listen to

100
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:57,540
was like, um, you know, protest music from Nicaragua. So it was like a six year old like

101
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:03,460
listening to like Nicaragua protest music. I thought that was cool. And I like brought

102
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:08,620
it to school and everyone was like, what are you doing? So, um, my parents were very like

103
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:12,860
anti Disneyland. Like they thought it was gross. They gave me the opportunity to go

104
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:18,100
cause they're like, oh, this is fun for kids, but it's not, yeah, it's not what we want

105
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:21,020
to do with our kids. So our kid and only one.

106
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:25,600
Right. And haven't you told me that then in your, in the later years, your mom and your

107
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:29,500
stepdad went, go to Disneyland and enjoy it?

108
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:36,180
Yeah. So basically my step, I have a step brother and he has two children and like they've

109
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:42,500
gone to Disneyland with those kids who are now like, uh, you know, early teens and, uh,

110
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:46,940
my stepdad, which is the funniest thing, he's like in his seventies and he got stuck on

111
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:51,140
the roller coaster in California adventure, like on the top of the roller coaster.

112
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:53,700
California screaming, the ride broke down, right?

113
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:57,580
Yeah, it broke down. So he was just stuck up there and he was like, Hey, you're just

114
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:58,580
like happy.

115
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:00,500
You could see him from,

116
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:05,220
I wasn't there, but everyone was like, Bob's just up there. Um, and then he was like, happiest

117
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:12,460
can be. He's like a very sweet round man with a gray ponytail.

118
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:17,540
Sounds like a typical theme park goer. Yes. Um, we're working on ours. We'll grow ours.

119
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:22,220
I've already got the round part.

120
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:25,300
Three beers will do that to you.

121
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:32,020
Okay. But like, yeah, let lifelong Disneyland go in spite as a rebellion against your, your

122
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:34,860
parents. That was the way perhaps to,

123
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:38,860
I slightly like, I feel like it was just like a childhood thing. Like I loved going and

124
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:44,620
I thought it was like fun and enjoyable. Um, and then the last time I went until recently

125
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:49,940
was like for grad night when I was 18. Cause like everybody in Southern California, many

126
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:51,580
people go to grad night there.

127
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:55,180
I did a grad night. I did two grad nights. I got to go again with my sister a couple

128
00:08:55,180 --> 00:09:01,820
years later. Yeah. Very exciting to do too. Very privileged. Yeah. Yeah. I don't think

129
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:02,820
we've talked about grad nights.

130
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:08,380
Cause Jason and I don't have this. We're not from around here. We, uh, we would have to

131
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:11,580
go to Disney world once in a while. So I did go with the high school band when I was 18,

132
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:16,140
which is the closest thing to a grad with like all a bunch of like scumbag 18 year olds.

133
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:19,380
Did they just cram you guys into the, an all star hotel?

134
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:23,500
No, it was offsite. We had to stay offsite from it. We did not stay at Disney property.

135
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:27,540
It was like some Hyatt or Hilton that was like off. They'd have to bus us in. Living

136
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:32,780
like animals. Yeah. We took a bus down there, four kids to a room.

137
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:38,100
Did they tape you in? Did they tape us in? I know when I went on like a school trip to

138
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:43,700
Washington DC, they taped the, uh, the doors of the hotel so they'd know if you opened

139
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:48,940
your door overnight. Cause the tape would be, the seal would be broken. Like a fucking

140
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:59,020
spy movie. Yeah. Not as advanced as lasers. Yeah. It's an, an intrusion alarm you could

141
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:02,760
trip. I don't remember if there was tape. I remember there was some controversy of some

142
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:07,740
kids getting like getting out at night, but I don't, well, first of all, it was not me.

143
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:12,420
I would never, I would never go against the rules of the, of the school and the teachers.

144
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:17,340
I would never make them upset with me. Certainly not. That's just not who I am or was. Let's

145
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:24,500
make one thing clear. 15 years ago, Mike was, uh, I remember the big, yeah, yeah. The biggest,

146
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,720
I think the biggest thing I felt like I was getting away with was I would have Sprite

147
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:33,820
for breakfast every morning. We would eat breakfast and whatever the hotel place was.

148
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:36,460
And I would just like, I'd be like, you know what, I'm going to have Sprite. Like, I don't

149
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:38,860
know. I get to have Sprite for breakfast. And I was like, I'm going to have it every

150
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:44,100
day. And I did. I was very proud of myself. Meek rebellion is the theme of this episode

151
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:49,140
and the podcast in general. Did you pour it into your cereal? No, no, that's too far.

152
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:53,820
That would be insane. I'll get you to the insane asylum if you're doing something like

153
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:59,580
that. But Grad, I mean, what was Grad night like from two Grad night goers? Um, neither

154
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:06,680
of you. I, uh, well as like a then theme park nerd, I really enjoyed it, but I was all snobby

155
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:13,020
because they were playing like hits of 2003 instead of, you know, the charming barbershop

156
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:20,220
quartet and country shanties that you'd typically hear in the park. Uh, you know, I didn't want

157
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:26,300
to hear ushers. Yeah. And in the club. Yeah, that's the way they make it for teens. Yeah.

158
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:31,300
They do. They do. Uh, to, you know, turn it into some damn teen nightclub. And I didn't,

159
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:36,740
I didn't like it, but I had fun anyway. Uh, I mean, running around the park like all nights

160
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:42,620
and, uh, uh, you know, yeah. Staying up all night and the ultimate rebellion, the ultimate

161
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:50,780
unique rebellion. After you have your Sprite, you can stay up. Oh man, I'm getting such

162
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:53,380
a sugar high right now. Uh, I dunno. What was your, uh, what was your Grad night? Um,

163
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:58,660
what I remember is that like they bused us down cause it was like an hour bus ride and,

164
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:03,500
um, I remember I was in the bus I didn't want to be in. So like, that's one of my biggest

165
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:08,900
memories is being like, all my friends are in the other bus. Um, but, uh, I was with

166
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:15,380
a group of people that, that definitely, uh, snuck some illicit drugs into the park. Um,

167
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:19,820
this is the other end of the spectrum to Mike's. Mike's are probably at sneak, uh, sneaking

168
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:24,820
Sprite at breakfast. Like Sprite and pill form. What kind of drugs are we talking about?

169
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:36,020
Sugar pills. Shoei sprees. Shoei sprees. This one pill packs the power of four Sprites.

170
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:45,500
I'm afraid man. Uh, no, it was like ecstasy and cocaine. So just like crammed into your

171
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:50,460
belly button and taped in or, uh, finding all the little spots that they didn't frisk

172
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:57,780
you. Um, and like the, the country, they frisked us. Oh wow. Did they do that to you? Um, I

173
00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:01,100
remember there was, there was kind of a drug pat and maybe, maybe a dog was led onto the

174
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:06,900
bus as well. Wow. And I also remember people like, like taping drugs and then sneaking

175
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:12,260
them in and also puritanical 18 year old, like, but you can enjoy Disneyland perfectly

176
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:21,340
sober. What do they need that for? Usher. I was such a grouch. Um, I'm chiller now if

177
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:26,660
you can imagine as I do my theme park podcast. Um, wait, okay. So how did, how did the night

178
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:30,820
play out for? Um, the night was really fun at the time. Like I was a cigarette smoker

179
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:37,620
too. And, um, so like I had this like genius move to like, um, I know you guys are men,

180
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:45,740
so maybe you don't have as, as much familiarity with tampons. Um, but I like open tampon wrappers,

181
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:50,540
took out the tampon and put cigarettes inside of the applicator, the cardboard applicator

182
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:54,860
and then smoked them inside the, you know, opened them up and then smoke them, uh, in

183
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:58,420
the park. And that's what I remember being the scariest part was like trying to find

184
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:03,020
a smoking area because like none of us were supposed to smoke at all. But wait, no one

185
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:08,540
in the park. Yeah. Yeah. You, you were 18 at the time. Yeah, but it still was grad night.

186
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:12,300
So there's like lots of like funky rules. Extra rules. Okay. Yeah. And I don't know

187
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:16,780
if I was 18. I turned 18 in April and I don't, I assume grad night was probably in May or

188
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:20,940
June. So I'm guessing I was 18, but I don't know. But they have to have these uniform

189
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:24,980
rules. Totally. Yeah. And I remember just like going by like the bathrooms by like the

190
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:29,460
Matterhorn or something and be like, Oh, I'll smoke this cigarette really fast. Fast cigarette.

191
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:35,900
What a pleasure. Oh yeah. It's a nice suck down. That's the best part about cigarettes.

192
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:42,700
They're so efficient. And in and out. Was there, was that your innovation to hide them

193
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:45,980
in there? Yes. And I still think it's a really good, it is good. That's what I wondered.

194
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:49,980
Like I super glued the packet back together. So like if anybody looked at them, they would

195
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:53,140
be like, Oh, this is a tampon and it feels like a tampon because it's inside the cardboard

196
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:57,460
applicator. But then if you open it up, there's two cigarettes. It's pretty cool. Yeah. I

197
00:14:57,460 --> 00:15:02,540
remember, I mean, this isn't theme park related, but I remember like I had, I had, Oh, I shouldn't

198
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:06,900
say this, but marijuana. My mom will be mad. Uh, somebody had given it to me in like college

199
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:12,260
and I didn't want it. So I like put it like in a, like a tube, like I think it was like

200
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:18,260
a tennis ball case and put those are see-through. Yeah. Well, wait, wait, that's true. That's

201
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:22,660
true. But then they like stuffed like different things in there. And then I put, I'm trying

202
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:26,220
to think like it was in like an air freshener or something. And I was like, well, no, no,

203
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:30,100
no one will ever find this. I got it. If somebody, and I was like, I was very nervous about it.

204
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:33,620
And of course, like who's looking, who cares? And I think I may have put it in my trunk

205
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:38,660
and then like, I don't know even know what happened to it. So the, a much more calm process

206
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:42,820
probably than me trying to hide drugs. Well, if they had found that they would have just

207
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:46,980
thought you were a weird man. It's like, wait, why is he carrying around a tennis ball holder

208
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:52,500
filled with air fresheners? Like the Christmas tree kind? No, I think, you know what I think

209
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:56,460
maybe I sprayed like Febreze, like whatever the version of that is in it. So it'll be

210
00:15:56,460 --> 00:16:02,700
like, well that'll throw off the dogs. The dogs will never smell if they smell the Febreze

211
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:08,420
or the air freshener, Pine Sol. Your intense weeks long home alone-esque plan.

212
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:15,740
Oh God, so sad. Just the saddest. If they catch me, the string will trigger the bowling

213
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:21,860
ball that smashes the door in that'll distract them. And the catabolt will shoot them across

214
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:28,660
the yard. There was a story just recently of people like being asked to leave, like

215
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:34,700
they had marijuana edibles on them and they had their California medicinal marijuana cards,

216
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:41,380
but Disney still, I think has a no zero tolerance, like not on property. And they, they just

217
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:45,460
either I think they just threw them out and let them in the park or they're like, eh,

218
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:51,060
we got to let you, you can come back tomorrow. But I don't know. Oh, but they got found out

219
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:55,620
because there was a plain clothes security guy. There's, there's plain clothes security

220
00:16:55,620 --> 00:17:01,500
people scattered throughout the parks and they, the guy was behind them in line. Like

221
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:06,020
he was just a regular guest and heard them talking about like, right. So it's an important

222
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:10,020
thing to remember if you're at the park and you see a guy with a giant Jack Skellington

223
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:16,540
sweatshirt and a big beard, that could be a cop. You always got to be on your toes. It

224
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:27,300
could just be a sad guy. Oh, how nice to know you can get secret shops as a Disney ticket

225
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:34,500
holder. I paid my under dollar admission and now can't bring in legal drugs that I was

226
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:43,700
prescribed. Yeah. We're making the park sound real fun and salonating for any potential.

227
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:50,940
So what was, what was the experience like being a little bit out of your mind? The main

228
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:54,980
thing I remember from grad night is just like, it was fun that it was dark. Like, do you

229
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:59,300
know what I mean? Like it was nighttime. It's just like colors. And I found $20 on space

230
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:03,380
mountain. So that's like the thing that like sticks out to me. And I was like, whoa, it

231
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:09,660
was very cool. Jason's hat just flew off. That would be the best day of my life. One

232
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:14,540
of my favorite rides and finding $20. It was very cool. And I like looked around. It was

233
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:18,620
just a $20 bill. And I was like, there's no way to return it. So it's mine, you know?

234
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:22,940
Right. Sure. Yeah. Yeah. You're not going to go report it. No. Although if you had,

235
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:26,980
if you were talking loudly about it, a secret shopper behind you may have requested that

236
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:30,300
you take it to the lost and found. And if you were Scott Jason or I, you would have

237
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:35,280
run up immediately to the employee and say, excuse me. I found $20 on the ride. I'd like

238
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:43,340
you to find the rightful owner, please. Where's the sprite? I've had too much sprite. Stop

239
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:50,620
the ride. It is a financial emergency. Shut all the rides at the park down. We need to

240
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:59,220
find the owner. Oh, we're fucking losers. So now that you're trapped here in a, in a

241
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:05,820
den of nerds, let's get into it. It's a small world. This was, this was your area of discussion

242
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:11,340
and yeah, let's hear about it. Let's hear your, your personal connection to this ride.

243
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:18,100
Why did you choose it? What's the deal? I think, um, I, it's, it's a ride I've always

244
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:21,340
liked. Basically there was like a 10 year gap where I didn't go to Disneyland and then

245
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:26,860
I started going, you know, in the last like five years. And, um, every time I go on it,

246
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:34,660
I think I cry. I cry most, most of the times I go on it. Um, because it like, that is the

247
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:40,540
world I want to live in like so bad. So for those of you who might not know this iconic

248
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:44,820
ride, it's, it's basically a boat ride, uh, at Disney. It's most, at most of the Disney

249
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:49,980
parks. It's a little boat ride through an idealized world where a bunch of little children

250
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:54,580
from all the nations of the world sing the same song in different languages and they

251
00:19:54,580 --> 00:20:00,180
just, they're having a G rated party basically. Yeah. And it's just like, like just the idea

252
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:05,660
of everyone singing the same song, bringing what they have, like it's about inclusion.

253
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:10,180
It's about like celebrating our differences and like in the positive way rather than like

254
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:16,940
seeing them as like dividing factors. And it's colorful and I love color. Sure. It's

255
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:23,060
interesting because the small world is probably the most earnest ride ever maybe. And maybe

256
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:26,100
not ever. I don't know. That's a crazy thing, but like it's very earnest and I feel like

257
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:32,500
it gets a bad rap. I think people think it's like for kids, like little kids. When people

258
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:40,060
are like terrified by it, I think, like I think it is so hyper positive that some people

259
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:46,780
are like afraid of it. Our, our engineer Brendan was just talking about his, uh, his friends

260
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:51,700
who like, like had a bad trip on the ride and uh, like, like they were, they were on

261
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:55,820
acid or something and it was going well until that ride and then all of the dolls freaked

262
00:20:55,820 --> 00:21:00,540
them out. Uh, but I think like, I don't know. It's like, yeah, it's gotten that rap over

263
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:05,100
the years, which is funny because I don't think there's anything nefarious, certainly

264
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:13,020
not in the creation of it. It is like so disarmingly sweet and sincere. Um, I think too, maybe like

265
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:17,160
people being afraid of it is because of like horror movies. Like anytime you see anything

266
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:21,080
really like sweet and childish or something like that, people are like, ah, that that's

267
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:24,460
going to come to life and eat me or something. I don't know.

268
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:32,220
And like lots of tiny dolls altogether. I can see the potential for, for terror in it.

269
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:36,140
There's, there's probably something psychological. If you were to meet a person that just feels

270
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:42,700
completely like everything is good. Like there's something a little bit like strange about,

271
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:47,700
about something like that, that doesn't have any sort of, like there's an apparent lack

272
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:51,460
of like anything cynicism or, or,

273
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:55,820
I will say on, on it's a small world. They do say it's a world of laughter and a world

274
00:21:55,820 --> 00:22:00,020
of tears. So they're, they're aware that they're, you know what I mean? We've got both sides

275
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:01,020
in the way.

276
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,020
Let's get it out in the open.

277
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:03,020
Yeah.

278
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:07,740
There's tears. We help each other. We, uh, we move on together. We work together. It's,

279
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:12,620
uh, yeah, I don't know. Looking at the purely sweet side of it. I, uh, yeah, let's, let's,

280
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:14,580
let's stick with that. I like the sweet side of it.

281
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:21,740
I think part of the, like the weird, the, the, uh, fear of the rock that is the song,

282
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:30,340
that song just, uh, uh, plays forever. Like it's just a loop and, uh, uh, uh, it's a lovely

283
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:37,400
Sherman Brothers song. Uh, but according to, uh, the Wikipedia entry, uh, of this ride,

284
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:43,420
the original soundtrack was even more horrifying because, and I'm reading here, it's tentative

285
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:48,940
soundtrack featured the national anthems of each country represented throughout the ride,

286
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:58,220
all playing at once, which resulted in a disharmonic cacophony. Uh, and Walt is the, you know,

287
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:04,220
walk through or heard this and was like, this is, uh, bad. We can't do this.

288
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:12,900
What a lesson to learn about, uh, separatism and not working together.

289
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:16,420
I love that they did it like that. They were like, no one questioned that that would be

290
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:19,660
a bad idea. They were just like, yeah, we'll play all the songs at once.

291
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:25,380
Well, if you're moving throughout, I can see how it's that idea would seem like a good

292
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:28,940
idea until like sound bleeds, you know?

293
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:37,180
Also like all of these meandering tempo lists, different keys, different languages, all clashing.

294
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:43,040
Uh, no, uh, national anthems are not really like hummable, uh, is, is the thing. Maybe

295
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:47,260
you could, maybe you know your own national anthem, but, uh, you know, the, the stress

296
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:52,620
spangled banner is not like a real hooky poppy kind of song. Uh, it's difficult to say, let

297
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:56,740
alone like, does anyone know any other national anthem?

298
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:58,460
Oh Canada.

299
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:03,300
Yeah. But then like you, if I said, start singing, Oh Canada, you're gone. And like

300
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:05,340
four lines, I would imagine.

301
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:10,180
I think after our home in native land, that's where I. Sure. Yes. Okay. After seven words.

302
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:14,580
Yeah. I don't, I, the only one I can think of is Radiohead's national anthem, but that's

303
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:22,260
not a real one. That's not real. Uh, yeah. So it is, so the hist, let's go to a little

304
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:26,340
history. Uh, this was originally, uh, created for the world's fair.

305
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:29,660
Yeah. The 1964 New York world's fair.

306
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:34,980
Uh, right. And it was sponsored by Pepsi. And a weird fact about it is that it was approved

307
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:36,260
by Joan Crawford.

308
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:42,340
Yeah. Joan Crawford, uh, so this ride came together in 11 months. Like Disney was doing

309
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:48,060
multiple pavilions at the world's fair. And for whatever reason, Pepsi just did not have

310
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:53,660
their shit together. And Joan Crawford was married to the late head of Pepsi at the time.

311
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:58,460
And she was the one who reached out to Walt Disney and was like, you can fix this. You

312
00:24:58,460 --> 00:24:59,460
can turn this around.

313
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:00,460
And he did.

314
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:01,460
And he did.

315
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:02,460
Because he could do anything.

316
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:08,180
In a very short amount, in like 11 months, a very short amount of time. He was also doing

317
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:14,860
the pavilions for the state of Illinois, Ford, General Electric, and Kodak.

318
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:20,860
Which is where the Abraham Lincoln animatronic came from and the, the carousel of progress,

319
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:25,700
right? And the dinosaurs, the primeval world, major block of attractions, which I think

320
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:30,540
like spread, imagineering thin, like there was not as much stuff going on in Disneyland

321
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:34,740
for a little while, but then all of those rides moved over to Disneyland.

322
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:40,060
Except for the magic skyway where you rode a Cadillac shaped ride vehicle.

323
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:41,700
Is that what that was? Really?

324
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:44,620
Yeah. I think that was, was that the first Omni mover?

325
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:47,140
Oh, maybe. I don't know.

326
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:53,020
Um, I guess the fantasy land arc rides were kind of around, but I think the, uh, that

327
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:54,980
debuted there. Also Circle Vision.

328
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:55,980
Right.

329
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:59,420
They, they had an early version of Circle Vision before this, but this was the one,

330
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:00,700
the Kodak Pavilion.

331
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:04,340
This is one of the things we should ask the listeners. Do they know what the first Omni

332
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:08,620
mover was? If you do, let us know, tweet at us or send us an email.

333
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:14,760
Do you understand any of what we're talking about? Because several times I've been talking

334
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:18,260
about the fact that we're doing this and people have said, no, okay, now Disney world, that's

335
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:22,660
the one in Florida, right? And I realized, we're just throwing out Omni mover willy nilly.

336
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:25,580
You forget people do not have these things memorized.

337
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:27,860
I think some people do though. I think people are.

338
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:32,140
And hopefully some of them are listening to this and enjoying it and thrilled at the discussion

339
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:35,020
of the 1964 world's fair.

340
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:36,020
What an exciting time.

341
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:40,860
World's fair sounded pretty cool, I will say.

342
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:41,860
Yeah.

343
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:45,620
Like this, this is, they exist in the world, but you never hear about them. They aren't

344
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:49,380
as big of a deal as they used to be. Uh, but this is where like, you know, it wasn't like

345
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:53,460
television debuted at a world's fair and massive deals.

346
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:58,260
The Ferris wheel, the Ferris wheel was at the Chicago world's fair.

347
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:01,860
Isn't the Eiffel tower, I don't know if that was a world's fair, but something similar

348
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:04,020
like an exposition is a similar term.

349
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:13,180
Yeah, I think the Eiffel tower, the statue of Liberty was going to, but it wasn't ready.

350
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:18,580
There is a TV special called Disneyland goes to the world's fair where Walt walks you through

351
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:24,580
Imagineering and shows each attraction and it includes an animated short, which is a

352
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:29,140
very weird short about the histories of fairs period.

353
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:30,140
Whoa.

354
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:33,860
But it looks like a Hanna-Barbera cartoon. It doesn't look like a Disney cartoon.

355
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:36,260
Oh, they outsource it maybe?

356
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:44,140
Yeah, it's so, it's very strange to watch. Also, they gloss right over H.H. Holmes and

357
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:48,820
his murder castle at the Chicago world's fair. They don't mention it at all in this cartoon

358
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:49,820
about the history of world's fair.

359
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:52,420
I think wife has glossed this over for me. What's this story?

360
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:58,460
Oh, he was like one of America's first serial killers. He built, this is the book Devil

361
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:04,780
in the White City, bestseller a few years ago was about this. He was a crazy con man

362
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:12,440
and he built an insane house in Chicago around the time of the Chicago world's fair and it

363
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:20,380
had all sorts of trap doors and like false walls and like gas pipes and a giant industrial

364
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:26,380
furnace and like 30 people disappeared in this murder house. And then he went on the

365
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:27,380
run.

366
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:28,380
Your hero?

367
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:33,180
Yeah. This is my, this is one of my guys. H.H. Holmes.

368
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:36,180
Oh, you seem like an H.H. Holmes guy.

369
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:39,020
Jason would use all those places just to hide snacks though.

370
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:40,020
Yeah.

371
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:45,460
Treats for the, so that only he could get to them.

372
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:46,460
No one will not be.

373
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:47,460
My cereal.

374
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:52,900
Wait, what's his connection to the world's fair?

375
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:59,580
Oh, well he would rent out rooms in this house. He turned it into a resident hotel and so

376
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:04,820
people would come, people from all around the world were like flooding Chicago for the

377
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:10,380
world's fair. So there, all these places got converted into hotels or like boarding houses

378
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:18,120
and he would rent rooms and you know, back then sometimes family members, you know, would

379
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:23,900
leave their hometown and sometimes you just never hear from them again. And that's sometimes

380
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:28,980
because they started a new life and sometimes because they were disappeared by H.H. Holmes.

381
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:32,940
Were some people so inspired by the world's fair that they didn't go back to their families?

382
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:38,820
I'm going to go invent a new bed, better, something better than electricity.

383
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:42,620
I think that's probably right. I mean, Walt Disney remade himself, you know, he was a

384
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:44,180
self-made man. He left.

385
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:47,620
Sounds like you didn't just take off from his family though.

386
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:52,140
No, but he had to restart, you know, that was easier back then. You could just like

387
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:56,140
have a fresh start before there was like a long history.

388
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:57,140
Like if you started a mother house.

389
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:58,140
This feels like I'm about to confess.

390
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:02,580
No, I know. It feels like we're leading somewhere with this.

391
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:08,380
What happened in this three fear, drunken stupor? What did you do?

392
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:10,900
Oh, last night.

393
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:11,900
Yeah.

394
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:14,740
Went to sleep with all the lights on as usual.

395
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:16,220
Like a real murderer.

396
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:17,220
That's because you're scared.

397
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:18,220
Oh, that's true.

398
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:22,220
Were you scared of the ghost of H.H. Holmes?

399
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:32,540
H.H. Holmes might break into my place and build a trap door for me while I'm sleeping.

400
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:37,660
Well you did it. You forced H.H. Holmes into the podcast. You've been threatening to do

401
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:40,900
it for weeks now and you finally did it. So good work.

402
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:46,100
Hey, and if you're out there, if you're doing Airbnb, just ask if there's any scary trap

403
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:47,100
murder doors.

404
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:52,180
Yeah, make sure all the doorknobs work and there's no gas pipes emptying into the room.

405
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:55,740
When you do your advanced search, don't click the trap door box.

406
00:30:55,740 --> 00:31:05,860
But the 1964 World's Fair, that's sort of where my family's Disney fandom can kind of

407
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:13,580
trace back to because my dad grew up in Philadelphia and went to, he was a child and went to the

408
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:21,540
New York World's Fair like four or five times and saw all these Disney attractions. His

409
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:26,500
older brother would take him out of school on weekdays. The nuns at the Catholic school

410
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:30,540
were like, oh, you're going to the World's Fair? Yeah, that's educational. Just go for

411
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:38,100
it. And it's not that far of a drive. So it was sort of like going to Disneyland. And

412
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:45,980
then eventually, yeah, a lot of the, so he grew up, him and my mom both would have grown

413
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:51,340
up watching The Wonderful World at Disney and he saw the World's Fair so much. So then

414
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:57,140
like when Disney World opened in Florida, they went down there a bunch pretty early

415
00:31:57,140 --> 00:32:03,860
on. Did he see all these rides before they were in the parks? Yeah, he rode all of them,

416
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:12,300
I believe. Can we get them on the phone? Now? Well, we'll have an episode with him. We can

417
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:20,420
in the future. Yeah. So he's saying it's a small world to you every morning, isn't it?

418
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:27,820
Every morning. All nights, every night. And little did he know that little seed of small

419
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:33,740
world singing and his World's Fair, like love of the World's Fair, would lead to him raising

420
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:44,140
a weird little son. A son who looked like one of the dolls. With the most mild facial

421
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:51,580
hair. All right, we've gotten to the portion of the podcast where Scott owns my ass. Yeah,

422
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:57,620
finally. I'm just whipping him. I do love the dolls though. I truly love the style.

423
00:32:57,620 --> 00:33:03,500
Like I love how everything looks. I love how everything's like spindly wood with just like

424
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:11,780
cheerful painted faces. I think I grew up with like a lot of like Swedish, like my mom's

425
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:15,900
side of the family is Swedish American and like there's a lot of like folkloric things.

426
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:23,260
And so like Mary Blair's style feels very folklorish. And just like vibrantly colorful

427
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:30,100
1960s, which is like all I love being like immersed into a whole feeling. And I feel

428
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:35,500
like with the ride, it's like a feeling you're like on it. It's not like, what's this about?

429
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:41,420
Like, you know. It's a very like exploded out illustration come to life. Like, and if

430
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:46,820
you look at concept art from the ride, the real like it so reflects what ended up being

431
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:51,420
there. Yeah, I think that's the big thing it has going for it is, yeah, so many great

432
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:57,700
aesthetics. There's sort of like a, you know, kind of a kooky semi psychedelic feel, but

433
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:02,720
also this like little kid arts and crafts vibe. And yeah, they like they everything

434
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:06,460
sits together really well. Well, we should talk about some of the people who made the

435
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:11,100
who made the thing you mentioned. Yeah, Mary Blair. She was responsible for the overall

436
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:16,820
like design sense of the ride. Mark Davis, I think did the scenes and characters and

437
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:22,300
his wife, Alice Davis did the costumes. Okay. I think I called him Jeff Davis earlier. I

438
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:27,020
think he did. Yeah. Is that a comedian? Could be. Is that like a whose line is that anyway?

439
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:31,100
Jeff Davis. I don't know. Or I may have just made a mistake. Let us know. Mark Davis, the

440
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:35,620
real imagine all of these people, imagineering legends, Disney legends. Yeah, that's the

441
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:38,940
thing. I think in looking at the list of the major figures who put the thing together,

442
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:43,700
it seemed to be like by this point, they had kind of an all star team, like the people,

443
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:47,660
the imagineers that you you read about being major figures in all of the rides. By this

444
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:52,220
point, they're all assembled and add imagineering because a lot of the early imagineers moved

445
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:57,300
over from working on the movies in the forties and fifties. And by now they were settled

446
00:34:57,300 --> 00:35:01,660
into their creative roles at imagineering. So Mary Blair was a big one because she did

447
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:10,580
a lot of concept art on Peter Pan and Cinderella. Another guy, Blaine Gibson, who I believe sculpted

448
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:14,780
all of the dolls. I don't know if you guys can affirm this. I think that's true. I don't

449
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:18,500
know the name Blaine Gibson. You don't know Blaine Gibson? Blaine Gibson was like one

450
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:24,180
of the big animatronic sculptors who did like did not only like that base of Small World

451
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:29,380
Doll. And I think they do all have the same face. I think that's part of the I mean, there

452
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:33,100
are some different faces, I think, because some of them feel more paper mache and some

453
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:36,380
of them feel wood. And then now they have the like more rubbery like when they've like

454
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:39,820
retrofitted it with like Little Mermaid and stuff. Oh, yeah. Some of them look a little

455
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:44,660
different. Oh, that's true. Yeah. And they look a little more like their their characters.

456
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:48,580
But maybe originally there was one. So I don't know. It was all sort of based on the original.

457
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:53,180
But Blaine Gibson did all of the he did the statue of Walt and Mickey that's in the center

458
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:59,140
of Disneyland. And he did, I think, all of the Hall of Presidents, maybe up through Obama

459
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:02,900
or at least up through Clinton. I think he had done like when they added new ones. This

460
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:09,660
was the guy who always made them. And he died just in time to not have to make it. It was

461
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:14,100
a big assignment he didn't have to do. They're never going to reopen that all the time. I

462
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:17,660
don't think so. They're just going to keep pushing it. Yeah. Once in months. Yeah, they

463
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:21,020
keep. Apparently there was a date on the website. I was just looking into this and they were

464
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:26,340
saying November 2017 and that got taken off. So I think, yeah, I think Hall of Presidents,

465
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:31,540
I think the technical errors of I don't know what it is. Just the wiring is giving us so

466
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:36,500
many problems. The Muppet thing, the Muppet thing we built above it. It's just I don't

467
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:42,140
know. It's really hard to work with. It's hard to do both. The Muppet infrastructure.

468
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:47,700
But the other one, Raleigh Crump is the other the other big name who I hadn't really until

469
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:51,700
preparing for this, I hadn't really looked into how all these things were made. And the

470
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:57,860
doll, the dolls are more kind of rubbery, but all of those, they call them the toys,

471
00:36:57,860 --> 00:37:02,740
like all of the, you know, like the yeah, like the rocking horse and all of these. Now

472
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:08,420
I can't remember any of these characters. But like a lot of these a lot of these characters

473
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:14,900
were made out of paper mache, like you said, and styrofoam and they still are like they

474
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:19,980
like the arts and crafts that was quickly done in the 60s in New York. It's still the

475
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:24,260
same things and they've been like refurbished and touched up. But like I think that's a

476
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:28,860
very charming thing about the ride that it's joyful. I love it. You have the little kid

477
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:33,780
vibe because like little kid materials were used to make the ride. Was there a time or

478
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:37,020
someone that was there a time do you because when you were younger, this didn't affect

479
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:42,500
you emotionally like it did now. Do you remember the first time as an older person when you

480
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:47,180
went on and you were like, oh my God, I think it was when I went back like five years ago

481
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:52,060
or something. Yeah, the first time I went back because I was like I like as a kid, my

482
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:55,900
favorite rides were Pirates and Haunted Mansion. Like I was like always like those were my

483
00:37:55,900 --> 00:38:01,420
number one rides that I would go to. But then as an adult, I'm like, oh my God, Small World

484
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:09,220
like is so good. Like it really is so good. I love it. I don't know. I like in my mid

485
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:17,380
20s a woman without children. I was like, oh, I love this. Were you imagining adopting

486
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:26,020
a child from each country maybe? No, no, I just want to like be around them. If you could

487
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:33,580
adopt for a day. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Rent a kid. But I also love like at the end, like

488
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:37,780
everybody comes together and it's like a mishmash. Like you've seen everybody and now they're

489
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:44,500
together like that is so great. It's pretty and in white versions of what they were originally

490
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:49,860
wearing, which is a precursor of Captain EO. When he takes he transforms. I guess, well,

491
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:54,460
no, they're all like multicolored dancers and stuff. But I like the idea of like everybody's

492
00:38:54,460 --> 00:39:00,260
wearing like, you know, like dark frumpy evil clothes and then all this now they're all

493
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:06,860
white and peaceful. And yeah, it's a delightful finale. Yeah, it's it's like all white and

494
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:11,420
gold. Right. Isn't it gold also? Yeah, yeah. There's gold in there. And then like Ferris

495
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:18,020
Wheel going. Happy sun. I think we're looking at heaven being depicted. And let's not forget

496
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:26,580
that big pink, leering purple hippo. There's a big hippo. Yeah, he's just kind of like,

497
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:31,380
hey, I think he's in like the fun jungle section. Yeah, I don't think he's like celebrated in

498
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:37,100
heaven. Everything is all white and the hippo comes back like we're going to heaven gang.

499
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:41,860
I would love a hippo. Who wants to party? The hippo does not talk for everyone who knows.

500
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:47,340
Jason is adding a voice to him. That hippo is really I do know exactly the hippo because

501
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:51,460
like there's a lot of different animals and kids on the ride and it's hard to, you know,

502
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:55,300
hard to remember them all. But when you say pink hippo, I know exactly who we're talking

503
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:58,820
about. I think they sell stuffed animals of it, right? There's a couple. There's a couple

504
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:03,180
of them. There's like a crocodile to write. There's like one with an umbrella. Yeah, very

505
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:08,420
fun. Oh yeah. He jumps out. Yeah. Who's who are other characters within the dolls and

506
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:15,820
the toys who have had an impact on you? That's a good question. I like the I like the girl

507
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:25,700
leading the geese in song and they're distinctly back in the in the white heaven version. She's

508
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:33,140
still trying. She'll teach them one day. Yeah, they stand out. I have I collect OK, believe

509
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:39,140
this or not. I collect these toys called Park Stars, which are Disney. Here the thing. There

510
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:45,500
are toys, but they're exclusively just characters that you'll find only in Disney parks. So

511
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:51,060
you're not going to find it's not going to be a Peter Pan toy, but it will be Sonny Eclipse,

512
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:55,860
the alien robot who plays. That's who you were talking. Marissa started playing a piano.

513
00:40:55,860 --> 00:41:01,180
I think she knew I was going to say that the international sign language for Sonny Eclipse.

514
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:09,180
That's the animatronic. Yeah. Tomorrowland only hamburger restaurant. Lounsinger in Walt

515
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:16,860
Disney World only. Yeah. And he has a brother in Japan, though. Yeah, there's a pizza robot.

516
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:22,900
Oh, yeah, I saw the pizza robot. Yeah, I saw the pizza robot and a woman that I guess my

517
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:27,020
my brain. I don't think about the rides and the things as much. But what happened at that

518
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:31,820
moment, this woman came up to me and she was like, what's up with Donald Trump? Like this

519
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:36,620
sweet little Japanese woman? And I was like watching the pizza robot and I was like, we

520
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:40,820
all hate it. You know, and then she was like, OK, because we do, too. And I'm like, yeah,

521
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:44,420
yeah, yeah. Can you see how longingly I'm staring at this pizza robot? Do you think

522
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:49,180
I'm a Trump support? Yeah, because it was like it was in November. It was like a week

523
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:54,580
after the election. So what a wonderful thing to get to answer for this when you go like,

524
00:41:54,580 --> 00:42:02,220
no, look, I truly I think everyone hates it. I don't know the people who like it.

525
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:07,020
So you're the only one here has been to the international Disney parks. Scott's been to

526
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:12,380
France. Oh, you went to Paris. Oh, that's right. Oh, where? Oh, you went on your honeymoon.

527
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:19,660
One one thing there, international exclusive characters. Rex, the Paul Rubin's voiced pilot

528
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:26,580
in Star Tours, has a girlfriend who is only in the Star Tours in France. Although it's

529
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:32,640
just a robot that now is just silently flapping around and you can tell it's missing something.

530
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:38,500
It's after the ride. You go into a Star Wars themed arcade and there is a robot just flapping

531
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:42,240
around and just making hydraulic sounds for nobody. And I looked it up later what it was

532
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:47,300
and it used to have a soundtrack and it was Rex's girlfriend or at least maybe Rex's wannabe

533
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:52,900
girlfriend who was like bragging about how brave he is and how the pilot training is

534
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:59,500
going really well. And she's like a fawning Rex fan, which is really strong female character.

535
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:06,900
A thirsty, a thirsty French robot. What is that? What is that test that measures how

536
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:12,780
often a female character says anything other than just loving the main character? That's

537
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:20,420
how you pass it, right? As if you never say anything that isn't just a strong male pilot

538
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:26,100
or firefighter. I don't remember her name. Were you going to ask me the name? I was going

539
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:30,420
to ask you that. Yeah, maybe look it up. What about your park? Your park pals. They're called

540
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:34,460
park stars. Now, OK, your park pals. Let's be accurate. They're called park stars and

541
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:41,820
stars is spelled with a Z at the end just for like a flourish. And I have maybe 60 of

542
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:48,060
these, but they have a lot of the small world. They're blind box. They come in the in boxes

543
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:52,700
and you don't know what you're getting and sort of inspired by like kid robot collectible

544
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:58,220
vinyl toys. Or yeah, Funko. I mean, those are bigger. Also, the thing is, yeah, blind

545
00:43:58,220 --> 00:44:01,420
boxes are you don't know what you're buying until you open it after you've paid for it.

546
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:06,460
That being said, you know what you're getting when you buy a case like I do. And it has

547
00:44:06,460 --> 00:44:10,540
the whole thing in it because I'm a mad man. But anyway, they have some of the some of

548
00:44:10,540 --> 00:44:16,380
the toys are the small world. So like you get, you know, like little like Dutch girl

549
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:23,880
with a blue hippo. You get a Japanese girl with a penguin. There's the little like Mexican

550
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:31,300
boy with a pink poodle. There's a goat, right? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. I have. He's. He's

551
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:36,220
got a cute little like a blue goat with I guess it's flowers on the side. You have that

552
00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:40,060
cactus one too, don't you? And I have the yes, I do. I have this. I don't know what

553
00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:45,420
country he's from. Hmm. I don't know. He's got bright orange hair. Probably Ireland would

554
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:49,100
be my guess. That's what. Why does he have a cactus? Well, it doesn't make sense that

555
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:53,300
poodles coming from Mexico. I don't think poodles are traditionally. But I could see

556
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:57,260
a poodle living in Mexico. You can't see a cactus living in Ireland. I can't see a cactus

557
00:44:57,260 --> 00:45:04,420
living in Ireland. My people, it rains too much. It would kill the cactus. Wait, your

558
00:45:04,420 --> 00:45:11,860
people. My people. Irish. You're Irish? I never knew that. Huh? I never knew that. The

559
00:45:11,860 --> 00:45:16,780
Sheridan's, the Sheridan side of the family is Irish and then my mom's maiden name is

560
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:22,580
Murphy. So that's all Irish. So what percentage are we talking? I don't know. I think I could.

561
00:45:22,580 --> 00:45:33,940
Uh, I mean. Jason doesn't do anything. I'm 100%. I'm 100% a true blue American brother.

562
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:42,380
And I personally hated all that negative Donald Trump talk earlier. I think we gotta give

563
00:45:42,380 --> 00:45:52,260
him a chance. Ugh. Heel. Yuck. Yeah. Even as a bit. Don't let him into that small world

564
00:45:52,260 --> 00:45:59,220
right? He'll have all kinds of terrible ideas. Building walls between the rooms and what

565
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:05,660
happens. Well that would fix the sound bleed. Look, the sound is a disaster. We need separate

566
00:46:05,660 --> 00:46:15,260
national anthems. Full volume. This will make it possible. By the way, Rex's girlfriend

567
00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:25,540
is hanging on pins and needles. It's ROX-N which I assume is like Rox-Anne. And in the

568
00:46:25,540 --> 00:46:33,220
Star Wars wiki she is listed as having feminine programming. What? That's the gender they

569
00:46:33,220 --> 00:46:43,060
put on. I just listed all of her characteristics. They gotta make a toy about her. They gotta

570
00:46:43,060 --> 00:46:50,980
make her a toy and I have to buy it. Someone get on it. Buy it today. One purchase at least.

571
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:56,620
So yeah, what other things like robots do we like on the ride? I mean I just like it

572
00:46:56,620 --> 00:47:02,100
all. I feel like I'm the kind of person in this world that I like a collection of things

573
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:07,180
at once. Like when I go into a fabric store I love all the fabrics together. I love all

574
00:47:07,180 --> 00:47:11,820
the papers together in a stationery store. I like all of it. So I think to me it's just

575
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:17,140
like the experience of all the kids together. But I do like those giraffes too if you want

576
00:47:17,140 --> 00:47:20,720
a specific. If there was a piece, we talk about this sometime, and Scott has a piece

577
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:26,320
of memorabilia from the parks. Like a piece from the parks. So say for some reason everyone

578
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:29,860
got too cynical and we're gonna close all the small worlds which would be horrible of

579
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:33,540
course. But say there was a big auction and you had a nice amount of money and you could

580
00:47:33,540 --> 00:47:38,700
afford. Is there a piece on small world you think you would want or a particular kid?

581
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:47,420
You really want to give me a child? I think two things jumped into my brain. One if I

582
00:47:47,420 --> 00:47:51,180
had to take something specifically from the ride I would take the sun. Because it's this

583
00:47:51,180 --> 00:47:57,380
very fun happy sun. It's something I could see in a living room. The clock sun? It's

584
00:47:57,380 --> 00:48:01,900
just kind of rotating. It might also have a clock face. I don't remember it. On the

585
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:07,020
outside or within the ride? Inside. Inside the ride. It's a very happy sun. It's like

586
00:48:07,020 --> 00:48:13,780
a 1960s, 70s sun that is just living its dream. It's just happy. Basking in its own mid and

587
00:48:13,780 --> 00:48:23,060
late. He's like I'm cool. Very friendly sun. Or and whichever. I love, this isn't really

588
00:48:23,060 --> 00:48:28,660
specific but it is Mary Blair related, I would take those murals. Those tile murals that

589
00:48:28,660 --> 00:48:36,500
are in Tomorrowland. I would 100% buy those. Say you had like, you say you had five million

590
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:42,300
in the bank. Okay. How much would you be willing to spend for those? Just off the top of your

591
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:48,420
head. Do I have other money coming in? Okay, I set up a scenario that I have to flesh out

592
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:53,180
a little more. Now we're talking my life. Say you have a decent sized house already

593
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:59,140
in Los Angeles. Say like most things are paid for. So you know you probably have, like you

594
00:48:59,140 --> 00:49:03,180
could probably lose a couple mil and it would be okay. Sure. So how much, I'm saying. This

595
00:49:03,180 --> 00:49:12,820
is a fantasy not even Walt Disney himself could dream of. A home in LA. I don't know.

596
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:19,820
I mean. 50 grand? Yeah, sure, sure. I would definitely do that. 500 grand. I don't know.

597
00:49:19,820 --> 00:49:25,340
Like I don't know what kind of person I am with those conditions. Okay. You know maybe

598
00:49:25,340 --> 00:49:32,540
I want to spend my money in other ways. But definitely I would throw money to fulfill

599
00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:37,300
a little dream of mine of course. Okay, so how about this. You could also go the Michael

600
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:42,460
Jackson route. I don't want to. Okay, well I'm not talking about everything. I'm just

601
00:49:42,460 --> 00:49:46,820
talking about in the sense of like building your own. Actually we could do a better reference.

602
00:49:46,820 --> 00:49:51,940
Bobby Sherman, the singer from the 60s that my mother's obsessed with that was on like

603
00:49:51,940 --> 00:49:56,580
some episodes of the Monkees which everyone's looking at me like who the hell. Not a Sherman

604
00:49:56,580 --> 00:50:01,540
brother. I just don't know where you're heading. Just like a doofy. He also has a little main

605
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:05,340
street in his backyard. He built that as well. I guess that's a thing that certain people

606
00:50:05,340 --> 00:50:09,820
have done. You could just also go that route. This is what I would do. Okay. Yeah, yeah.

607
00:50:09,820 --> 00:50:17,780
I would have a room in my house that's big. You know like I don't know. Not the size of

608
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:23,180
a gym but maybe a quarter of the size of a gym. Like a basketball court. You know what

609
00:50:23,180 --> 00:50:30,740
I mean? Like a big like a child you know a children's gym. I don't know. A gymery? No,

610
00:50:30,740 --> 00:50:33,980
I just didn't. Once I said gym I was like oh do people think like LA Fitness? That's

611
00:50:33,980 --> 00:50:39,940
not what I'm talking about. Like a basketball court you'd play in in school. And I would

612
00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:45,220
make it super fun and themed. Like I would have like a cool like tiki bar and then I

613
00:50:45,220 --> 00:50:51,740
would love like it'd be so fun to have kind of like tropical or like you know what I mean

614
00:50:51,740 --> 00:50:57,900
Mary Blair room that like feels like that jungle room or even a little bit of that heaven

615
00:50:57,900 --> 00:51:02,100
room. I don't want a full heaven room but like a slice of heaven would be fine. Oh nice.

616
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:09,180
A heaven closet. Oh seven minutes in heaven. Oh yeah so people could. You know who else

617
00:51:09,180 --> 00:51:17,180
designed a very specific room? A lot of murderers. He's going to say something about a murder.

618
00:51:17,180 --> 00:51:23,480
He was an architect. He designed his own. He designed and built his own houses. No one

619
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:29,500
give Jason these millions, these hypothetical millions we're discussing. Patreon cancelled

620
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:35,300
now. Not happening.

621
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:41,740
Mentioning the Sherman Brothers a couple times. The way the timing works out on the creation

622
00:51:41,740 --> 00:51:47,420
of this ride. They said when they were writing the song one of the things that influenced

623
00:51:47,420 --> 00:51:55,380
them like not I think to try and do the opposite of this event but they wrote it's a small

624
00:51:55,380 --> 00:52:01,980
world around the time of the Cuban Missile Crisis. So like that was on everyone's mind.

625
00:52:01,980 --> 00:52:07,780
They wanted to like it made them realize how like yeah the world is very small. Although

626
00:52:07,780 --> 00:52:17,140
the opposite of the Cuban Missile Crisis is a missile. Launching. We don't want the opposite.

627
00:52:17,140 --> 00:52:21,220
But they wanted people to realize the world was small not because like oh you get that

628
00:52:21,220 --> 00:52:25,900
missile. The missile's real close. It's like it's small and we need to work together and

629
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:31,680
foster a spirit of cooperation. Let's talk about this song because the song is like people

630
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:36,980
claim it's the most like listened to or heard song of a time. I have a record of it. Like

631
00:52:36,980 --> 00:52:42,940
I have an LP of the act. Oh okay. I just found I didn't I forgot that I had this. I forgot

632
00:52:42,940 --> 00:52:47,780
where it came from. But like I have a souvenir wreck like like a 45 that was given out at

633
00:52:47,780 --> 00:52:53,500
the World's Fair. Yeah that has it's like it just has the song but it is enough space

634
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:59,940
to have it in like Italian and and Spanish and like a few different languages. Yeah.

635
00:52:59,940 --> 00:53:06,500
With like a little Mary Blair design cover. Yeah. Wonderful. Yeah. So I was going to say

636
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:10,700
let's go through the lyrics real quick. Let's just do the lyrics of the song because people

637
00:53:10,700 --> 00:53:14,980
it's such a there was a period in the 90s especially where it kept creeping in like

638
00:53:14,980 --> 00:53:21,140
there's a there's a jab at it and Lion King. What. Yeah. Lion King. He starts singing.

639
00:53:21,140 --> 00:53:24,860
I think what is it's one of the characters start singing it and like Scar. It's like

640
00:53:24,860 --> 00:53:29,180
one of the hyenas start singing. It's a small world or Zazou. I forget who does it but like

641
00:53:29,180 --> 00:53:37,260
it started to become I feel a very like Gen X kind of like the cynical you know. Yeah.

642
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:42,700
Like screw this. Lame. Right. They're they're in the epic Mickey video game where you play

643
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:47,820
as Mickey Mouse and it's like a mashup of different Disney stuff. There is I think either

644
00:53:47,820 --> 00:53:54,820
the sun or the giant clock. It's a clock on the outside. Yeah. Of the ride is is a boss

645
00:53:54,820 --> 00:54:01,500
is a villain and he's been driven insane by hearing the song for 50 years like so. Oh

646
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:05,780
wow. Yeah. Between that and the Lion King thing like Disney will do self referential

647
00:54:05,780 --> 00:54:10,900
like can. Can I say one thing about the Lion King really quickly which gives a window into

648
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:17,620
also my parents parenting style. I went to see a double feature when I went to see the

649
00:54:17,620 --> 00:54:22,100
Lion King when I was in like fifth or sixth grade whatever grade it was. But my parents

650
00:54:22,100 --> 00:54:26,100
didn't take me to the Lion King. I saw the last 30 minutes of the Lion King and then

651
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:34,100
natural born killers. Oh wow. At like eight or nine. Yeah. So so wait wait why didn't

652
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:37,500
you. Why did you only see the last 30 minutes. Oh because we were interested in natural born

653
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:43,420
killers. So I didn't want to see the line. Oh yeah. Right. Right. Right. Right. Because

654
00:54:43,420 --> 00:54:50,420
I was like oh that's for kids. And I'm like 11 and I'm not a kid anymore. Eleven. Also

655
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:55,100
my parents were like yeah this is normal. Let's take her to this. And also what what

656
00:54:55,100 --> 00:54:59,500
cinema pairs those movies. That's crazy. Well wait a minute you're saying it was back to

657
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:05,860
back in the same theater. It was a double feature. What. Yes. Yes. You didn't leave.

658
00:55:05,860 --> 00:55:10,380
You didn't exit the theater just started rolling on to the next one. What do you remember what

659
00:55:10,380 --> 00:55:17,180
theater it was. Beverly. I don't know where. Screwed up Hollywood. We got to look at this.

660
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:20,940
This is weird. This seems like they would not be allowed to do that. Well that's why

661
00:55:20,940 --> 00:55:24,900
it sticks out in my mind because it's insane. Are you sure you didn't switch theaters. No

662
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:30,140
it was a one theater. It was like one of those old one theater. Are you sure that to save

663
00:55:30,140 --> 00:55:34,580
money there was a crossover like from seven o'clock to like nine o'clock and they start

664
00:55:34,580 --> 00:55:37,700
switching and like you guys like crouched down in the back of the theater when they

665
00:55:37,700 --> 00:55:41,700
came to clean it out to me and like you were pretending you were like garbage or something.

666
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:46,780
And then and then you just sat down again when they were leaving and then the new movie came

667
00:55:46,780 --> 00:55:51,980
on. I don't think so. I really think it was a double feature. I'll ask my father. Yeah.

668
00:55:51,980 --> 00:55:58,540
He would be one to crouch around and look like garbage. Like you brought a trash bag

669
00:55:58,540 --> 00:56:06,020
and like threw it over the top. Or like hide in the garbage in the backyard. So you have

670
00:56:06,020 --> 00:56:11,420
to pay the two to movie price. If you can save a couple of bucks. So also if you at

671
00:56:11,420 --> 00:56:18,260
home went to a similar double feature like if you saw like you know the great mouse or

672
00:56:18,260 --> 00:56:24,660
the rescuers down under and sliver it is a double feature. If this per review or part

673
00:56:24,660 --> 00:56:34,540
of this perverse theater Oliver and company and Caligula re-released killing. That was

674
00:56:34,540 --> 00:56:39,180
not the same year. Caligula was many years earlier. Wait till you see who Oliver's company

675
00:56:39,180 --> 00:56:47,580
is. I just looked this up because I have remembered another pop culture connection to the song

676
00:56:47,580 --> 00:56:56,060
so the A.V. club used did a series a few years ago where they interviewed people about songs

677
00:56:56,060 --> 00:57:02,660
they hate and they asked David Lynch and he said it's a small world and he's one of the

678
00:57:02,660 --> 00:57:09,060
things he said about the song. It got stuck in my head and it was like having a disease.

679
00:57:09,060 --> 00:57:15,380
And this is David Lynch creator of nightmares. So on the nose it does feel very on the nose.

680
00:57:15,380 --> 00:57:19,980
Like that feels premeditated. I feel like he knew what he was going to do. Yeah. Yeah.

681
00:57:19,980 --> 00:57:26,140
Well that's what I think it became a very like standard opinion to have like saying

682
00:57:26,140 --> 00:57:31,340
like disco sucks or that kind of thing. I feel like that or like this era we talk a

683
00:57:31,340 --> 00:57:37,380
lot about the Beatles and now there was this time this awful time when people were forsaking

684
00:57:37,380 --> 00:57:45,140
Paul McCartney as a bubbly light frothy substance guy and ignoring all these wonderful songs

685
00:57:45,140 --> 00:57:50,660
through the 70s and 80s. What a cynical dark time. I mean you can like John too but oh

686
00:57:50,660 --> 00:57:57,300
my God what a weird cynical folks who can't handle silly love songs. That's exactly who

687
00:57:57,300 --> 00:58:03,740
silly love songs is about. That's true. Yes. I like that song. He was goofing on people.

688
00:58:03,740 --> 00:58:07,580
People were saying he was too schmaltzy and he was like oh that was his little like comment

689
00:58:07,580 --> 00:58:13,580
on himself way before Taylor Swift was addressing her public persona and doing nothing else

690
00:58:13,580 --> 00:58:20,740
in any songs ever. Yeah. McCartney did a little critic jab and we were all tapping our toes

691
00:58:20,740 --> 00:58:30,500
to it. Some of us were. Jason didn't because he doesn't enjoy toes. I don't enjoy toes.

692
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:38,180
I don't understand music. I think it's passing fat. We'll get over it one day. Well in that

693
00:58:38,180 --> 00:58:44,180
but in the service of that this very positive song. So the lyrics are it's a world of laughter

694
00:58:44,180 --> 00:58:50,220
a world of tears it's a world of hopes and a world of fears. All right. So that's true.

695
00:58:50,220 --> 00:58:54,820
I love it. I love it because it's giving you all like you know in life you get to choose

696
00:58:54,820 --> 00:58:58,060
what you see. You know what I mean. You're going to be confronted with everything but

697
00:58:58,060 --> 00:59:01,320
you get to choose how you're going to interpret it and what you're going to do. So they're

698
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:04,620
not lying to you about what's going on in life. That's a good let's go. Yeah we'll do

699
00:59:04,620 --> 00:59:09,420
this. We'll analyze the lyrics line by line here. There's so much that we share that it's

700
00:59:09,420 --> 00:59:16,020
time we're aware it's a small world after all. And obviously that's saying you know

701
00:59:16,020 --> 00:59:30,260
wake up. Yeah. Why is it time now. It's there's so much that we share that it's time. I think

702
00:59:30,260 --> 00:59:34,820
they're just saying saying like calling to the president being like hey like we can make

703
00:59:34,820 --> 00:59:38,540
a choice in this moment. You know I don't know why they're saying time now but I guess

704
00:59:38,540 --> 00:59:43,900
it's speaking to them. When when the ride was first graded to it was it was also Pepsi

705
00:59:43,900 --> 00:59:50,460
was the sponsor but it is originally acted as a tribute to UNICEF the United Nations

706
00:59:50,460 --> 00:59:55,940
International Education Fund. Is that right. I don't know. Right. Yeah. I know it's for

707
00:59:55,940 --> 01:00:04,740
children and all that the tickets sold at the fair like all of that money went to UNICEF.

708
01:00:04,740 --> 01:00:12,180
I love that. That's nice. Wonderful. Yeah. Well but the song is annoying. That good is

709
01:00:12,180 --> 01:00:18,500
outdone by and the Disneyland version of the ride is the world's fair one. I mean it's

710
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:23,380
been you know stuff's been rebuilt and added over the years but many of the same set pieces

711
01:00:23,380 --> 01:00:27,260
a lot of the same stuff. Yeah. It came from New York. But what did not come from New York

712
01:00:27,260 --> 01:00:34,420
was the giant sculpture the oh God what is it called the Tower of the Four Winds. Oh

713
01:00:34,420 --> 01:00:38,780
yeah. Is that it's I know there's four of them. I can't think of the name the official

714
01:00:38,780 --> 01:00:42,540
name you can look that up. I'll go through the last lyrics here. Yeah. The Tower of the

715
01:00:42,540 --> 01:00:47,380
Four Winds. There is just one moon and one golden sun. So you wanted the sun in your

716
01:00:47,380 --> 01:00:52,380
love the secret or your little room. I mean Google image that sun. Yeah. Is it the same

717
01:00:52,380 --> 01:00:54,780
thing. Yeah. There are multiple sons because I'm remembering the one where there's the

718
01:00:54,780 --> 01:01:00,740
crisscrossing there's the like spy spikes the sun spikes. That's the correct term the

719
01:01:00,740 --> 01:01:05,300
rays. Yeah. And the other one that is the sun you're too. OK. OK. Because that I love

720
01:01:05,300 --> 01:01:09,980
that effect a lot like the little like that. What a neat little like in person optical

721
01:01:09,980 --> 01:01:14,340
illusion watching that little flash of the rays go by. I love it. Love that son. There's

722
01:01:14,340 --> 01:01:19,940
no moon. You got to step it up in this room. The moon.

723
01:01:19,940 --> 01:01:27,660
And a smile means friendship to everyone which I love like that like speaks to my heart.

724
01:01:27,660 --> 01:01:31,420
You sounded like your voice was cracking. I like you're trying to get to her. That's

725
01:01:31,420 --> 01:01:36,380
what's happening. I mean I secretly have been trying to get her to break down and try on

726
01:01:36,380 --> 01:01:43,340
the podcast. It would be good. It's good podcast. People on the red it'll go nuts. Oh my god

727
01:01:43,340 --> 01:01:50,380
they got me broke down broke her down three white men broke down. Yeah. The Internet just

728
01:01:50,380 --> 01:01:59,900
celebrates. That is we drag her in a room. That doesn't sound like red it at all. Also

729
01:01:59,900 --> 01:02:05,900
that that's not 100 percent true though. A smile means friendship to everyone. You dogs

730
01:02:05,900 --> 01:02:09,900
dogs you don't necessarily want to bury. They're not talking about dogs. They're talking about

731
01:02:09,900 --> 01:02:16,780
folks. Also like a not smiles not friendship if it's a scary it clown or something. Oh

732
01:02:16,780 --> 01:02:23,460
yeah. There's scary smiles. That's true. The type of smile a joker would put on your face.

733
01:02:23,460 --> 01:02:28,780
Yeah. Not a good one. No. But that's not what the Sherman Brothers meant. No. Oh the mountains

734
01:02:28,780 --> 01:02:34,700
divide and the oceans are wide. It's a small world after all. Yeah right. So it is true

735
01:02:34,700 --> 01:02:45,700
that it's a small world. Vague lyrics are true. Never were. Yeah. Like we're all on this planet

736
01:02:45,700 --> 01:02:50,940
guys. We're all here and like we are connected like I don't care. Anybody can have whatever

737
01:02:50,940 --> 01:02:56,540
feelings they want. But like we're all part of this one living earth. You know that's

738
01:02:56,540 --> 01:03:04,420
cool. Well and children aren't born to hate. They all think as a child you love everyone.

739
01:03:04,420 --> 01:03:15,780
You have to be taught. Yeah. Now I'm going to break down. You don't deserve. No we got

740
01:03:15,780 --> 01:03:20,980
to honor everybody. You know let's let's love each other guys. I think it's the time for

741
01:03:20,980 --> 01:03:26,700
this ride to be pushed a lot stronger into that. You know what they should do. Don't

742
01:03:26,700 --> 01:03:31,260
build the new Hall of Presidents. Take it at rip it out builds an extension of it's

743
01:03:31,260 --> 01:03:37,660
a small world or just a second. It's a small world. Small world too locked and loaded.

744
01:03:37,660 --> 01:03:43,660
How about you replace all the presidents with tiny little small world versions of the presidents.

745
01:03:43,660 --> 01:03:48,180
Oh my god. You can sit in their little suits and stuff. Oh jeez. That group will be a lot

746
01:03:48,180 --> 01:03:57,500
less diverse than the small world dolls. Only one black one. Yeah we can fudge that. We

747
01:03:57,500 --> 01:04:01,780
can switch it up. No one will notice. There actually there were some girl presidents back

748
01:04:01,780 --> 01:04:06,620
in the. I don't know why it was such a big deal recently because there are a few. You

749
01:04:06,620 --> 01:04:12,380
totally forget it was so long ago. Oh there's a hippo president too. 1890 was our first

750
01:04:12,380 --> 01:04:19,500
president in a top hat and a tie. He looked very short. Great. A lot of social reforms

751
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:26,300
he passed. It was really wonderful. So it's a seated theater theatrical experience. Yeah.

752
01:04:26,300 --> 01:04:35,820
The cute hall of the hall of cute presidents. So yeah I mean this is it's so I mean when

753
01:04:35,820 --> 01:04:42,300
you're a teen and when you like Hot Topic it's so nice and easy to be cynical. And you're

754
01:04:42,300 --> 01:04:48,060
still we're all still railing against 18 year old. Railing against high school you I guess.

755
01:04:48,060 --> 01:04:53,100
I don't know. You like Hot Topic. You're drinking Sprite for breakfast. You're watching natural

756
01:04:53,100 --> 01:05:01,260
born killers got a big H.H. Holmes poster on your wall. Typical cynical kid. Hey no but

757
01:05:01,260 --> 01:05:07,500
hey look you came around you were yeah you were a no good Nick. It sounds like. Now you

758
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:13,260
weep at this at this doll ride. So there's hope for everyone. There's hope for Marissa.

759
01:05:13,260 --> 01:05:18,780
Yeah for sure. I mean you know just ride that ride. I think everybody just rode that ride

760
01:05:18,780 --> 01:05:25,340
and really thought about it took it in. Maybe we'd be nicer to each other. Mr. Trump ride

761
01:05:25,340 --> 01:05:31,340
this rock. I guess this is what the podcast is going to be about. Is that Reagan telling

762
01:05:31,340 --> 01:05:37,180
Mr. Gorbachev to tear down the wall. Was that the same voice. I guess it kind of inadvertently

763
01:05:37,180 --> 01:05:41,620
kind of. I was just trying to do one of those Twitter guys one of those people on the Internet

764
01:05:41,620 --> 01:05:46,580
who's always like Mr. Trump how dare you sir. I thought the ghost of Reagan was telling

765
01:05:46,580 --> 01:05:51,060
Donald Trump to ride. It's a small world to understand the world better. Donald Trump

766
01:05:51,060 --> 01:05:59,180
I would call the natural heightening of Ronald Reagan. I like that. Yeah. The second beat.

767
01:05:59,180 --> 01:06:03,460
Yeah well so I like this fantasy though of Trump writing it which he now could because

768
01:06:03,460 --> 01:06:12,380
they widen seats for larger writers. So wouldn't sink. And once he made it safely back like

769
01:06:12,380 --> 01:06:18,460
imagine him like they've set up a press conference for him and this ride has melted my heart.

770
01:06:18,460 --> 01:06:26,220
I now say open borders. I say it's a delightful little fancy. It would be great. The last

771
01:06:26,220 --> 01:06:33,300
all it takes 15 minutes of Disney fun. The other question I wanted to ask is about they

772
01:06:33,300 --> 01:06:38,900
added a few years ago. We briefly mentioned that they added to the ride little sort of

773
01:06:38,900 --> 01:06:44,100
Mary Blair style. She's shaking her head. She's very upset about this. They added like the

774
01:06:44,100 --> 01:06:49,940
positivity is gone. The positivity is gone. Don't give me a little paper machine nemo.

775
01:06:49,940 --> 01:06:53,940
So they added Disney. So there's a like a little Aladdin and Jasmine flying around on

776
01:06:53,940 --> 01:06:58,100
a flying carpet and it is in my opinion tastefully done. But what is your feeling about. I will

777
01:06:58,100 --> 01:07:07,900
say it is so much better than like the pirates editions and stuff like that. But I love I

778
01:07:07,900 --> 01:07:11,740
think one of the reasons why I love it's a small world is because it isn't linked to

779
01:07:11,740 --> 01:07:17,180
any kind of intellectual property. Right. I love that it just is the heart and the truth

780
01:07:17,180 --> 01:07:23,820
of things rather than and like one particular stylized version of the world rather than

781
01:07:23,820 --> 01:07:27,540
character character character character. I mean we get those everywhere else in the park.

782
01:07:27,540 --> 01:07:32,740
Can we just have one space that was originally not that. You know. But I do think they did

783
01:07:32,740 --> 01:07:38,940
a good job making them appear in the style of. Yeah. Yeah. The doll. Yeah. The dolls

784
01:07:38,940 --> 01:07:43,780
themselves the new Little Mermaid and everything. Yeah. It's kind of an inexplicable change.

785
01:07:43,780 --> 01:07:48,020
I don't know why they needed to put those in. I would guess it's because they do these

786
01:07:48,020 --> 01:07:53,620
surveys and I kids go on these rides and the kids probably went like I don't know any of

787
01:07:53,620 --> 01:07:58,460
these characters. Yeah. But I hate that. Like that's what I want to rail against. Like let's

788
01:07:58,460 --> 01:08:04,380
enjoy a world without characters sometimes learn some new characters. Yeah. Children

789
01:08:04,380 --> 01:08:10,340
are born. They have to be taught to only like intellectual properties. When I was a kid

790
01:08:10,340 --> 01:08:16,860
I liked one of the things I liked about going to the parks is seeing stuff that you could

791
01:08:16,860 --> 01:08:21,700
only see there is like there's not a small world movie or TV show or that sort of thing.

792
01:08:21,700 --> 01:08:28,700
You just have to go to the park. Sony. Sony Eclipse. I love Sony Eclipse. Like I was a

793
01:08:28,700 --> 01:08:36,340
weird. Sony. I heard Sony too. I love my Sony Eclipse. That's my phone. It's like a zoom.

794
01:08:36,340 --> 01:08:40,940
I'm sticking with it. It'll come back one of these days. But I love that. I made the

795
01:08:40,940 --> 01:08:46,860
parks feel special to me. Sure. And I think it is. It is a thing. And now they just. Yeah.

796
01:08:46,860 --> 01:08:51,820
I think it's tastefully done in small world. But it is a little like you know when they

797
01:08:51,820 --> 01:08:57,140
shove characters into stuff when they closed Alien Encounter and kept the ride system.

798
01:08:57,140 --> 01:09:01,900
But it's like it's Stitch who comes out now. I went on that. It's so weird. It's really

799
01:09:01,900 --> 01:09:06,340
weird. They've pretty much shut it down. It's a seasonal. The only if the park is like at

800
01:09:06,340 --> 01:09:11,420
max capacity. They're like let's get some people in here to like ease up the other lines.

801
01:09:11,420 --> 01:09:16,900
It's purely Space Mountain relief. Stitch especially is also like I think Lilo and Stitch

802
01:09:16,900 --> 01:09:22,780
is a very lovely movie with a very nice message too. You know the Ohana means family. Family

803
01:09:22,780 --> 01:09:29,140
means no one gets left behind. But the way they. Can you do a Stitch impression by any

804
01:09:29,140 --> 01:09:40,140
chance? What does he say? Mr. Gorbachev. Mr. Gorbachev. Ohana means family. No you don't

805
01:09:40,140 --> 01:09:52,540
have to. But doesn't it be like. Very good. Very good. But when it came out and from there

806
01:09:52,540 --> 01:09:57,860
on out afterwards it really the marketing of Stitch to me always seems like here's Stitch

807
01:09:57,860 --> 01:10:03,460
and you like Stitch now. Like Disney pushed Stitch so hard there for a while and they're

808
01:10:03,460 --> 01:10:09,340
still like I think it is like a popular like plush. Like I feel like there's always Stitch.

809
01:10:09,340 --> 01:10:13,480
But they were I think it was there was such a dearth of successful animated films and

810
01:10:13,480 --> 01:10:17,740
characters at the time that it was like oh you kind of like this great we're. That's

811
01:10:17,740 --> 01:10:22,300
true. I'll say I definitely agree with that like that they're like hey you should like

812
01:10:22,300 --> 01:10:29,580
this. You like Stitch now. When I was in Tokyo I went on the their version of Tower of Terror.

813
01:10:29,580 --> 01:10:34,280
What is it the Harrison and Hyde Tower. I don't remember. But there's like this little

814
01:10:34,280 --> 01:10:39,900
guy who's like causing all the ruckus this guy little Shiriki Utundu like he's this little

815
01:10:39,900 --> 01:10:45,900
like statue. And I was like oh I want to get a piece of merchandise with this character

816
01:10:45,900 --> 01:10:52,060
on it. Like I'm very excited. And I went into the gift shop and it was all Stitch. That's

817
01:10:52,060 --> 01:10:57,620
the exit of the like of that ride. That's the dumbest thing I've ever. Yeah. That's

818
01:10:57,620 --> 01:11:03,220
very straight like that. That happened with Tower of Terror in Orlando and Anaheim where

819
01:11:03,220 --> 01:11:07,500
the original the actual like Tower of Terror merchandise just got the section got smaller

820
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:13,580
and smaller and more and more nightmare before Christmas. Just because it's like a perennial

821
01:11:13,580 --> 01:11:21,540
bestseller I guess. And people weren't really looking for Rod Serling action figures. I

822
01:11:21,540 --> 01:11:26,420
was. Yeah. We're the type who all want those weird fit characters but most tourists are

823
01:11:26,420 --> 01:11:30,580
like give me some Stitch. Give me a sweatshirt with Stitch on it. Why would you want Stitch

824
01:11:30,580 --> 01:11:35,540
at the end of a ride that Stitch has nothing to do with. We were in Orlando and a couple

825
01:11:35,540 --> 01:11:39,180
years ago when we got off the Country Bear ride and we were high from it we loved it

826
01:11:39,180 --> 01:11:43,940
so much. Oh my god we haven't seen this in years. This is the greatest show and we ran

827
01:11:43,940 --> 01:11:47,100
up to them. Where's the merch? Give us the merch. We want everything you've got. And

828
01:11:47,100 --> 01:11:51,100
they're like oh we don't really have any. And I was like what the hell. And it must

829
01:11:51,100 --> 01:11:56,860
just be people for some reason most tourists don't want like a hillbilly bear on a shirt

830
01:11:56,860 --> 01:12:01,540
or like they. It's weird. Or it's like they had it but they wanted you to go away. That's

831
01:12:01,540 --> 01:12:06,860
possible too. Did you see what Liver Lips were all doing? Did you see? And they're like

832
01:12:06,860 --> 01:12:11,620
yeah yeah yeah. Been here for a while buddy. I feel like Disney goes back and forth on

833
01:12:11,620 --> 01:12:16,820
that where they they will have like a lot of park exclusive merch for a while. They

834
01:12:16,820 --> 01:12:21,540
have a lot of variety and then for a while it'll just be like the same shirts the same

835
01:12:21,540 --> 01:12:27,580
stuff to animals at every store. Yeah like the it's it's all like crap like Peter they

836
01:12:27,580 --> 01:12:34,260
have a Peter Pan shirt on that just says like I'm so fly. Oh I hate that. You're a ghast

837
01:12:34,260 --> 01:12:39,140
Marissa's a ghast at it. Oh that is like that that was like a gut punch that feels horrible.

838
01:12:39,140 --> 01:12:44,940
Yeah it's it's bad. Wait this maybe wasn't Disney but didn't Lindsay post like a crazy

839
01:12:44,940 --> 01:12:49,860
it was like the Popeye characters as Breaking Bad or something. Oh yeah my girlfriend when

840
01:12:49,860 --> 01:12:54,660
we were in Orlando a couple weeks ago or a couple months ago I guess. Yeah there's a

841
01:12:54,660 --> 01:13:02,460
Popeye and Bluto Breaking Bad parody shirt in Orlando in Universal Studios. Who for who

842
01:13:02,460 --> 01:13:09,700
why? Yeah. That's even weirder. Stop mixing two. Don't mix yeah. Completely unrelated.

843
01:13:09,700 --> 01:13:13,540
I will say Disney is losing money though if they don't have a shirt of the Queen of Hearts

844
01:13:13,540 --> 01:13:20,300
from Alice in Wonderland with her giant axe sword thing going and it says Slay Queen right.

845
01:13:20,300 --> 01:13:24,580
That seems like a give it. Oh that is good honestly they should make that everyone would

846
01:13:24,580 --> 01:13:29,580
would absolutely get that. It's funny we are all saying we used to not fit in with like

847
01:13:29,580 --> 01:13:35,020
teenagers of the time but clearly you've got a grip on the youth culture that is very you

848
01:13:35,020 --> 01:13:43,900
should work for Hot Topic. Our new shirts conceptual artist. Well if anyone from Hot

849
01:13:43,900 --> 01:13:48,900
Topic corporate is listening Jason Sheridan is his name. Line of shirts about all the

850
01:13:48,900 --> 01:13:56,580
different American World's Fairs Knoxville Seattle New York Chicago Philadelphia. You

851
01:13:56,580 --> 01:14:04,240
wouldn't get it it's a Chicago World's Fair thing. The Philadelphia World's Fair shows

852
01:14:04,240 --> 01:14:11,180
up in the American adventure or American experience. What's the Epcot ride. Oh yeah the American

853
01:14:11,180 --> 01:14:15,100
experience or American adventure. I can't. One of the robots. I just saw robots fell

854
01:14:15,100 --> 01:14:20,460
over while the show was going on a couple of days ago. Oh the best thing that can happen.

855
01:14:20,460 --> 01:14:25,340
That's the one where like Mark Twain talks to Ben Franklin. Ben Franklin and Thomas Edison.

856
01:14:25,340 --> 01:14:29,460
They co-host the show. They shake hands. But then the World's Fair segment there's like

857
01:14:29,460 --> 01:14:35,780
four or five luminaries all standing in their booths and they're all talking at each other.

858
01:14:35,780 --> 01:14:40,940
It's very strange. That ride is super weird. We have to do an episode. I think I said in

859
01:14:40,940 --> 01:14:44,420
a previous episode when the first time I went to Disney World I read about it in a book

860
01:14:44,420 --> 01:14:49,940
on the way that attraction and then it was closed for refurbishment and I cried and cried

861
01:14:49,940 --> 01:14:56,660
say seven year olds who really wanted to see Benjamin Franklin shake hands with Mark Twain.

862
01:14:56,660 --> 01:15:00,300
And they're like at least a foot apart. Their hands are a foot apart when they're shaking.

863
01:15:00,300 --> 01:15:07,060
It's so great. That's very funny. They both seem to give it a go for five weird seconds

864
01:15:07,060 --> 01:15:12,580
and then kind of look up like close enough. We did it gentlemen. In my mind there's like

865
01:15:12,580 --> 01:15:17,660
a creaking noise too. It's like signify that they're touching but that might be in my own

866
01:15:17,660 --> 01:15:24,940
brain. Is there an overall statement to make about that we missed anything. Morris do you

867
01:15:24,940 --> 01:15:29,980
have any final thought. We have a little wrap up for this section but do you have any final

868
01:15:29,980 --> 01:15:34,100
thoughts or anything. I mean I feel like I've been saying it the whole time. Sure. You know

869
01:15:34,100 --> 01:15:39,780
what I mean. Your message is clear. Oh sorry. You believe in people getting along and harmony.

870
01:15:39,780 --> 01:15:49,020
Yeah yeah yeah. Inclusion inclusion inclusion. Colors are fun. I love like fun style. I love

871
01:15:49,020 --> 01:15:53,620
like the joy of togetherness and to celebrate that rather than you know tearing each other

872
01:15:53,620 --> 01:15:59,660
apart. Well that's I mean that's wonderful. I mean we all can agree on that stuff. So

873
01:15:59,660 --> 01:16:05,420
what we do is when we're doing a ride we have a we have a scale basically and there are

874
01:16:05,420 --> 01:16:09,160
three choices you can have when dealing with this ride. Would you keep it exactly the same

875
01:16:09,160 --> 01:16:13,500
as it is? Would you plus it up and then what would you do with it or three would you just

876
01:16:13,500 --> 01:16:18,860
burn it down in a mysterious fire for insurance purposes. So we'll each go around and we'll

877
01:16:18,860 --> 01:16:22,420
choose what we would do to it's a small world and we're probably talking about the Disneyland

878
01:16:22,420 --> 01:16:26,420
version because we all know what the best. Yeah. Does anyone want to start. I can start.

879
01:16:26,420 --> 01:16:31,460
Sure. I'll start. OK. I would plus it up. Here's the thing that kind of bothers me about

880
01:16:31,460 --> 01:16:37,100
it. You can clearly see that the sky is a building and I don't like it and on Pirates

881
01:16:37,100 --> 01:16:41,540
and on Haunted Mansion at least when it's not Haunted Mansion holiday you can't really see

882
01:16:41,540 --> 01:16:45,500
that it's you could see it might be sky because it looks just very convincing. It's dark in

883
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:49,220
there and I understand that's a big part of it but I don't like it that it just looks

884
01:16:49,220 --> 01:16:54,140
like you know there's air ducts up there. It's a Costco ceiling. Yeah. Like a BJ's brewery.

885
01:16:54,140 --> 01:16:59,820
It looks like a BJ's which by the way is a wonderful restaurant. They don't need to simulate

886
01:16:59,820 --> 01:17:04,180
a sky and they aren't obliged but it's a small world. There's a reason most dark rides take

887
01:17:04,180 --> 01:17:10,140
place at night. It's hard to hide. And they're called dark rides. You know what though I

888
01:17:10,140 --> 01:17:16,060
actually have it in my notes that I like I like the ceiling. Really? And it's a there's

889
01:17:16,060 --> 01:17:21,220
a really specific detail that I noted and really appreciated in the Simpsons ride at

890
01:17:21,220 --> 01:17:25,820
Universal Studios that you're like crashing into different rides at Krusty Land in that

891
01:17:25,820 --> 01:17:30,240
ride and you go into the Happy Little Elves ride and if you look at the ceiling it is

892
01:17:30,240 --> 01:17:35,340
very clearly the unadorned small world ceiling. It's just dropped tile right? Yeah. Yes. I

893
01:17:35,340 --> 01:17:39,420
know exactly what you're talking about. Really deep theme park nerd detail that I'm very

894
01:17:39,420 --> 01:17:45,140
happy that they did. Like a small world ceiling. So I might not even maybe I don't change anything.

895
01:17:45,140 --> 01:17:51,220
So do you like it because the Simpsons referenced it? I like it more now for that reason. But

896
01:17:51,220 --> 01:17:56,060
that reference definitely read to me. I find it sort of I think it's kind of charming and

897
01:17:56,060 --> 01:18:01,660
connects it to the the world's fair roots. That it's like just like an it's an industrial

898
01:18:01,660 --> 01:18:06,980
building and they didn't they did a little bit to it but didn't go didn't go nuts. I

899
01:18:06,980 --> 01:18:12,400
mean I'm not saying it has to be some immersive sky but I almost want at least like a cartoon

900
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:17,480
something on the top of the ceiling that looks more like a child. Like happy stars? Maybe

901
01:18:17,480 --> 01:18:24,680
happy stars that's a good idea. Maybe just you know like stuff hang more hanging things

902
01:18:24,680 --> 01:18:28,940
like you could put you know things that may fit to the jungle part it feels like there's

903
01:18:28,940 --> 01:18:35,100
vines or something. I just feel like I want to be immersed more in the ride and I look

904
01:18:35,100 --> 01:18:40,180
up and it takes me out of it a little bit. Fireworks at the end. Fireworks would be good.

905
01:18:40,180 --> 01:18:44,620
Two if it was possible I know it would be a total I think part of the thing that makes

906
01:18:44,620 --> 01:18:51,180
people like roll their eyes at the ride is that it is so slow and pleasant. I want let's

907
01:18:51,180 --> 01:18:58,700
do a couple drops. Get out of town. Well that does happen in the movie Tomorrowland. Yes

908
01:18:58,700 --> 01:19:01,780
that's true. Which we had not talked about I've never seen that movie but I know there

909
01:19:01,780 --> 01:19:06,420
is a sequence where they get on the small world boat it stops and like a track tour

910
01:19:06,420 --> 01:19:16,480
opens. Is this your fanfic Jason? No it's Brad Bird's fanfic. I'm not saying Splash

911
01:19:16,480 --> 01:19:20,820
Mountain level drop I'm saying just like some fun maybe twirls where the boat would twirl

912
01:19:20,820 --> 01:19:27,780
or they would go up. I'm just saying if you give it a little pizzazz in the feeling department

913
01:19:27,780 --> 01:19:31,980
I think you're going to get more people that are on board for a message of unity and hope

914
01:19:31,980 --> 01:19:38,820
that's all I'm saying. I think if you give the body a visceral thrill it's more willing

915
01:19:38,820 --> 01:19:45,700
to accept a message of hope and peace. No way. No. Like you see if you're trying to

916
01:19:45,700 --> 01:19:50,980
get someone to donate to a charity you spin them around. That is exactly what I'm saying.

917
01:19:50,980 --> 01:19:57,460
Alright so that's me. Who wants to go next? I don't think I have my I think there's so

918
01:19:57,460 --> 01:20:02,620
many things you should do in Disneyland before you start changing it's a small world too

919
01:20:02,620 --> 01:20:07,220
much and they did this little change that isn't a great change. It is really it's real

920
01:20:07,220 --> 01:20:12,220
slow at the end there. I think that actually is a bummer about it that you leave and then

921
01:20:12,220 --> 01:20:18,620
you still got the two minutes of sort of like boat parking and I don't know what you can

922
01:20:18,620 --> 01:20:24,900
do there to speed that up just I don't know put some extra dolls outside add some dolls.

923
01:20:24,900 --> 01:20:29,180
That bugs me about pirates. Pirates of the Caribbean in Disneyland they will let boats

924
01:20:29,180 --> 01:20:33,820
back up before you go up that lift hill at the end and I know they just run too many

925
01:20:33,820 --> 01:20:40,020
through the per hour or whatever but I don't remember that happening as a kid. Yeah and

926
01:20:40,020 --> 01:20:43,780
it does like it's not horrible it doesn't like kill your experience on the thing but

927
01:20:43,780 --> 01:20:50,660
you do have that moment like hey well that was great I'm glad we went on this. Two minutes

928
01:20:50,660 --> 01:20:56,580
go by. It's a real deflation that happens as opposed to Indiana Jones or something where

929
01:20:56,580 --> 01:21:00,700
you're like right off it immediately pretty much. There's something to do that's tight

930
01:21:00,700 --> 01:21:07,340
let's tighten up that ending. I don't like videos explaining how we can donate to UNICEF

931
01:21:07,340 --> 01:21:14,700
and if we want to create a small world in our own community what can we do. Give me

932
01:21:14,700 --> 01:21:20,940
like a QR code that I can scan and donate right then and there. Yeah let's do some good

933
01:21:20,940 --> 01:21:28,220
with those extra two minutes. How about that. Plus it up. Jason. I was going to say keep

934
01:21:28,220 --> 01:21:40,180
it keep it as it is. All right next Marissa. I try not to go in too hard when Disney does

935
01:21:40,180 --> 01:21:47,460
make changes to rides and stuff like I feel like people can get very upset but I do think

936
01:21:47,460 --> 01:21:57,020
it is a good idea to preserve some stuff as they are like the original or not original

937
01:21:57,020 --> 01:22:01,340
but early attractions like the Tiki Room or like some of the stuff from the World's Fair.

938
01:22:01,340 --> 01:22:06,100
They become kind of historical documents at a certain point like an old movie you want

939
01:22:06,100 --> 01:22:13,100
to maybe watch it as it was intended to be. Yeah and I think I mean Disney himself said

940
01:22:13,100 --> 01:22:18,100
you know Disneyland will always be growing and changing it'll never be complete so like

941
01:22:18,100 --> 01:22:22,420
but you can't change everything all the time but then you can't keep everything the same

942
01:22:22,420 --> 01:22:28,100
all the time so I think it's a balancing act so I think like and I think the company does

943
01:22:28,100 --> 01:22:36,020
tend more towards preserving the stuff that Walt did work on. Like the Tiki Room and and

944
01:22:36,020 --> 01:22:42,820
and the stuff that came out when he was alive especially the animatronics stuff. Sure. Yeah

945
01:22:42,820 --> 01:22:48,140
sure. Hey wait wait a minute I have a I have an idea in retrospect also that we haven't

946
01:22:48,140 --> 01:22:51,260
talked about the Christmas version there's not much to talk about but they think they

947
01:22:51,260 --> 01:22:55,620
did a great job with it and the exterior looks really great with Christmas lights Halloween

948
01:22:55,620 --> 01:23:03,660
version everybody. Yes that would be fun I would love to see that. 300 different and

949
01:23:03,660 --> 01:23:10,180
also my wife and I are both we love like there's a specific costume term called baby bunting

950
01:23:10,180 --> 01:23:15,740
like when you see a costume for babies that doesn't require feet like if a baby is like

951
01:23:15,740 --> 01:23:23,540
a carrot or a like like bees in a pod or or like a minion or something. Like an egg. Yeah

952
01:23:23,540 --> 01:23:28,180
yeah yeah when a baby's just in a bag so let's put a bunch of baby buntings on all these

953
01:23:28,180 --> 01:23:34,860
dolls. I love that phrase what a boring what's a bunting it's a baby bag. It's a fun baby

954
01:23:34,860 --> 01:23:40,500
bag. Do they make those for adults that sounds very comforting. That'll be our first merch

955
01:23:40,500 --> 01:23:46,340
podcast the ride adult buntings. Also you know what let's throw some minions in there

956
01:23:46,340 --> 01:23:55,460
they're fun. Marissa looks aghast. I hate it. That is cross company cooperation it's

957
01:23:55,460 --> 01:24:00,220
the inclusiveness you were talking about Disney and Universal coming together to shoehorn

958
01:24:00,220 --> 01:24:06,980
minions into its small world. The minions and the dolls. I would hate that. I would

959
01:24:06,980 --> 01:24:20,220
hate it. That is a nightmare. Oh my god. Mr Gorbachev here's a banana. My version of the

960
01:24:20,220 --> 01:24:28,380
ride I would plus it by getting rid of the new guys. Take it back to like 10 years ago.

961
01:24:28,380 --> 01:24:33,260
And yeah I was like thinking about the I'm like oh I like your idea about changing the

962
01:24:33,260 --> 01:24:38,020
ceiling like I don't hate that. But then once you spoke that I was like no let's keep it

963
01:24:38,020 --> 01:24:45,940
the same. Good excuse. 60s tiles perfectly preserved. One thing I also enjoy about like

964
01:24:45,940 --> 01:24:52,060
the end which is too long I agree like after you after they're like Ben Benu and like bye

965
01:24:52,060 --> 01:24:59,540
bye whatever. I do like that you're like which lane am I going to go in. The boats separate

966
01:24:59,540 --> 01:25:05,060
and you don't know which one you're going to get. That's kind of fun. So keep that.

967
01:25:05,060 --> 01:25:09,300
Keep the lane. Keep the lane splitting up for the boats. I'll keep things moving traffic

968
01:25:09,300 --> 01:25:17,660
wise too I'd imagine. So we land at basically keep it. I've been overridden. My ideas have

969
01:25:17,660 --> 01:25:21,500
been overridden and it's going to be keeping being kept the same. I don't need mine to

970
01:25:21,500 --> 01:25:27,220
happen if they did I wouldn't mind. Well there you have it. I would like mine to happen.

971
01:25:27,220 --> 01:25:34,340
Can we rip out the new guys. That's on you to do next time you ride it. Jump off and

972
01:25:34,340 --> 01:25:41,620
rip them out. We'll be right back. All right. So we're so we're agreed. Small world kind

973
01:25:41,620 --> 01:25:47,020
of as it basically as is. But I mean I'm fine with taking out the new characters. That's

974
01:25:47,020 --> 01:25:52,140
fine with me. So Marissa thank you so much for joining us today and sharing your love
