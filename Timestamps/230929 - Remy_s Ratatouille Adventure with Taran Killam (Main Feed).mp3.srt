1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Attention.

4
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:13,640
The following podcast may contain frank discussion of Tiki Mug Addiction, secret closed door kiss

5
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:17,160
goodnights, and crepe rope drops.

6
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:22,720
Special guest Taryn Killam takes the good boys on, as the French would say, a totally zany

7
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:27,880
adventure through his favorite parts of the theme park world, including Remy's Ratatouille

8
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,040
Adventure.

9
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:30,640
And Podcast The Ride.

10
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:56,600
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, the show that provides Anton Ego-esque sensory flashbacks

11
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,320
to old bullshit you were better off forgetting.

12
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:02,120
I'm Scott Gardner, joined by Jason Sheridan.

13
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,120
Hi.

14
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,120
Hi, yeah.

15
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,120
Oh, okay.

16
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:13,400
I took a sec, it was right there, I know who Anton Ego is now, but I was like, I hope he

17
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,600
goes to Mike first.

18
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,400
Okay, oh sorry, well look at that.

19
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,320
I made the choice, which is usually the order.

20
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,680
Let's rectify that, Mike.

21
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,880
I was bad, I was changing the levels a little bit, I was fixing some of the technical aspects,

22
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:24,880
so I was unable to respond.

23
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:27,400
I also was hoping you went to Jason first.

24
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,840
Well, you did, thank goodness.

25
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:36,160
No Ratatouille experts among us, or people at least remembering the vague.

26
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:39,680
I mean, I was excited, oh yeah, Peter O'Toole, right.

27
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,680
Sure, yes.

28
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,920
What a voice cast, Brian Dennehy, Peter O'Toole, Patton Oswalt.

29
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,320
It is a very good voice cast, some of them factor into this attraction that we're going

30
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:54,160
to talk about, which we're so excited to do, and especially given the guest who we have.

31
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:59,840
We've heard for a long time that he is the rare combo of comedy, luminary, and parks

32
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,840
guy.

33
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:06,080
The best combo there could be, and we're here to confirm that and to celebrate it from Saturday

34
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:09,680
Night Live from Single Parents from Hamilton on Broadway, it's Tarrin Killam.

35
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,680
Hi guys.

36
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,680
Hey.

37
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,680
Buckle up.

38
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,680
Oh boy.

39
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,680
Permanent ser sentados, por favor.

40
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,680
Oh baby.

41
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:21,280
We're used to buckling at least, other people might not be so comfortable.

42
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,280
Yeah, yeah.

43
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,280
Yes, so happy.

44
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,240
As you're representing with Powerline shirt.

45
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:29,640
You know, I'm happy to be here seeing you eye to eye.

46
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,640
Wow.

47
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,640
Wow.

48
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:34,120
It's nice to hear that, nice to be told that eye to eye.

49
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,120
Yes.

50
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,120
Beautiful message.

51
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,120
Beautiful message.

52
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:44,800
In high school, I used eye to eye as an audition song for my high school production season.

53
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,800
And did it get you the?

54
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,440
I did, not the musical.

55
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,440
No, no.

56
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,440
Really?

57
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,440
No, I ended up in Mousetrap.

58
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,440
Okay.

59
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,440
Geez.

60
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,480
So let them, well at least let them calibrate.

61
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,480
Do not let him sing.

62
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,480
I think I want to murder this guy.

63
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,600
Was it acapella eye to eye or is it a little?

64
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,600
Yes.

65
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

66
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,600
Gotcha.

67
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,600
I'm trying to think how that, I guess, I think that would play though.

68
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,600
That's a strong melody.

69
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,600
Is it okay?

70
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,600
Yeah.

71
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,600
You need a lot of, there's a lot of production.

72
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,600
I find myself a notion.

73
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,600
One, I know that you'll understand.

74
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,600
Yeah, that did.

75
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,600
He set my world in motion.

76
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:27,760
By reaching out for each other's hands, baby we'll discover what we should have known all

77
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,760
along.

78
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,760
I just want to do the whole thing now.

79
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,760
Would anyone be mad?

80
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,760
We'll just do the entire thing.

81
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,760
Just do the show.

82
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,760
I don't know if you're going to do the middle, the Rosie Gaines.

83
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,760
After today.

84
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,760
Wow.

85
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,760
I mean that's the musical.

86
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,760
If you're going to go musical, the more theatery one.

87
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,760
For sure.

88
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:47,760
Well, at least with Mousetrap, you were able to tell your fellow high schoolers, you know,

89
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,920
that's the longest running play on the West End.

90
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,920
Exactly right.

91
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:53,920
Maybe period.

92
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,920
It is.

93
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:55,920
It is to this day.

94
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,920
I took my now 14 year old daughter, eight year old, when we were there in London, that

95
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,760
was like one of the only things that I said, we have to do it.

96
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:09,360
And it was one of the best, best decisions of my life because no audience is more earnest

97
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,720
and invested in an Agatha Christie mystery than an eight year old child.

98
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,720
Sure.

99
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:19,960
And we saw, you know, like they're probably at like 70% capacity and it's been there for

100
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:20,960
forever.

101
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:25,160
So everybody's and she, it was so real.

102
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:29,960
Like I remember, you know, the first act ends with like the whistling of three blind mice

103
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:33,680
and the old frumpy woman who's insulted everybody dying.

104
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:39,100
And she like lights go down, her body's on stage and like my daughter's just like squeezing

105
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:42,240
my arm harder and harder and the curtain comes down for intermission.

106
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,520
She looks at me, she goes, this is pretty scary, dad.

107
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:50,640
You know, which was wonderful because the performance was like, I say I've never been

108
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,320
to a bed and breakfast with less service.

109
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,320
You know, very arch.

110
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,320
Very.

111
00:04:55,320 --> 00:05:00,080
Don't worry, that's going to lose a child that that level of British theatricality won't

112
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,520
work, but it seems like it did.

113
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,560
Wait, this is, I mean, I've got a thousand theme park questions, but this reminded me

114
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,660
of this one.

115
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:13,700
If you were the theater kid growing up and also a fan of this stuff, did you, and I know

116
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:20,660
you acted as a kid, did you ever consider theme park performance, theme park musicals

117
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:21,660
or whatever?

118
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:22,660
Did you ever pursue that?

119
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:23,900
I didn't.

120
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:26,180
I had friends in college who did do that.

121
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:32,660
And my best friend Hunter was in the very first California adventure parade, like the

122
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:39,060
He had a hang glider, like a, like a, like a base jump parachute hang glider that he

123
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:44,260
would dance to down the center of California adventure to celebrate.

124
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:47,020
Soren in a, in float form.

125
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:48,020
Yes.

126
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:49,020
He was a float.

127
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:53,300
He lasted, I think like two months because of the commute, just, you know, like we're

128
00:05:53,300 --> 00:06:00,740
in LA to Anaheim is tricky, but I definitely like, I was more hoping for like, cause, cause

129
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:05,620
As I was in high school, like beauty and the beast, the musical was a big deal and like,

130
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:07,140
and like fairly legit.

131
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:12,460
Um, I'd, I'd hoped in my early twenties that they would do like a Hercules musical then

132
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:15,940
and like maybe do a young, young Hercules would have been, that would have been the

133
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:16,940
ideal for me.

134
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:17,940
Yeah.

135
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:18,940
Yeah.

136
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:19,940
The way that they, there is that now they do that now.

137
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:20,940
They do it now.

138
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:25,340
Now there's a really, really, uh, a great production that I think they did a paper mill.

139
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:26,340
Okay.

140
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:27,340
Yeah.

141
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,820
Do you have some, do you have a dream Disney park?

142
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:29,820
Oh yeah.

143
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:31,980
In the theatrical realm.

144
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:34,020
Is it still, is it Hercules somewhere?

145
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:36,780
I've, I've so aged out of that.

146
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:47,100
Like, I think the Paul Schaeffer, um, I had a, who did, who did design the flower?

147
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,740
Isn't that just kooky?

148
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:50,740
Say babe and cat.

149
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:54,980
Hey babe, it's just a wacky, it's like, Oh my God, I'm captured.

150
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:55,980
I'm captured.

151
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:58,980
This is the worst.

152
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:00,140
Wow.

153
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:01,140
Jeez.

154
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:02,140
All right.

155
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:03,140
Just slap a bald cap on you and you're set.

156
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:04,140
Yeah.

157
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:05,140
I'll roll with that.

158
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:08,220
I feel like, I feel like a good role, like a good dramatic role is like, um, who is the

159
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,220
arch bishop or whatever from hunchback.

160
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:11,220
Oh my God.

161
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:12,220
Frollo.

162
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:13,220
Yeah.

163
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:14,220
Yeah.

164
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:15,220
The fire.

165
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:16,220
The serious song.

166
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:18,140
Like that burn, like she'll burn, will burn and yeah.

167
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:19,140
Evil.

168
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:20,140
Yeah.

169
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,140
Like pervy, but he's religious.

170
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,140
Yeah.

171
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:23,140
That's, that's, that feels meaty.

172
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:24,140
Like fuck it up.

173
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:25,140
Yeah, that'd be great.

174
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:27,140
If you were doing that for a few months or something, you stay in that headspace.

175
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:28,140
Yeah.

176
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,300
Exactly.

177
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,300
Don't take that home.

178
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,300
Sniffing hair weirdly.

179
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:32,300
Don't give, don't give that role to Jared Leto.

180
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,300
Cause he's going to go.

181
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,300
God.

182
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,300
That's too hard.

183
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,300
Yeah.

184
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,300
Protect the women.

185
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,300
Um, okay.

186
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:41,300
Question I do have right off the bat though.

187
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:50,300
Um, given the day that this is coming out, uh, which is right at the end of September,

188
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:55,980
I believe, I think that this episode is being released in the dead center of the final voyage

189
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:56,980
of the Halcyon.

190
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:57,980
Oh yeah.

191
00:07:58,820 --> 00:07:59,820
Galactic star cruiser.

192
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:03,100
The last weekend is happening right as people are hearing this.

193
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,100
Yes.

194
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:07,860
And you are among probably the few, well, the few people in general, it's like a, it's

195
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:10,100
a select club at this point of people.

196
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,100
Yes.

197
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,100
Did galactic star cruiser.

198
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:19,940
We chatted about this, Scott, and I listened, um, with open ears, but, but also with, with,

199
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:23,980
um, with a differing opinion, uh, the, the gentlemen from, from no hard feelings.

200
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:24,980
Oh yes.

201
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:25,980
Andrew Barth Feldman.

202
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:26,980
Yeah.

203
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:30,100
The most positive episode of this show in history.

204
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:33,260
And maybe ever we'll never do that again.

205
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:39,380
It was infectious cause I, cause it definitely like rewrote some of my experience where I

206
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:41,180
was like, yeah, that was all right.

207
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:42,180
Actually.

208
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:49,980
I mean, not to say that my experience was all negative, but now I'm so glad I went,

209
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:54,420
like I feel like I have like, you know, like the autograph of someone who's passed away

210
00:08:54,580 --> 00:09:00,500
by having embarked on the Halcyon, you know, and I would have been furious had I not had

211
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,140
that experience while it existed.

212
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:10,540
Um, but it was, it was far from perfect as the business model is demonstrating as they

213
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:11,780
shut shutter up.

214
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:12,900
Yes, that's true.

215
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:16,700
If it were, yeah, if it were so an utterly perfect experience in every way.

216
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:17,700
Yeah.

217
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,780
It needed some things needed to change, I think, to keep it going.

218
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:25,260
And not to get, cause there are, there was clearly so much effort and passion that went

219
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:30,060
into it and a lot of like talent and, and some impressive achievements.

220
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:34,420
Um, and, and I don't want to get too philosophical, but I'm, I was born and raised in LA, so I'm

221
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:36,420
very pro Disneyland.

222
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:40,580
Uh, uh, Disney world was always like, I gotta get there.

223
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,580
That's the dream.

224
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:42,580
That's going to be even better.

225
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:46,820
And I've, and, and went, I think the first time I went was like 2017 and there were things

226
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:50,980
that met expectations, but there's a lot that fell short.

227
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:51,980
Oh, interesting.

228
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:56,380
And that, and that I think like, to just summarize, like, I feel like Disneyland does such a great

229
00:09:56,380 --> 00:10:00,380
job of protecting the attendee from backstage.

230
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:01,380
Yeah.

231
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:05,900
Once you are, once you are in downtown Disney, once you're in the land, once you're in California,

232
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:11,740
you rarely get a peek of, of backstage and, and, and Orlando by nature, like there's no

233
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:15,980
way to hide an entire county from the thousands of people there.

234
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:17,140
Yeah.

235
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:18,140
Fire stations and infrastructure.

236
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:19,140
Yeah.

237
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:23,460
But because of that, as you're approaching these parks, you're seeing the girders and

238
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:25,100
the steel infrastructure.

239
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,100
You know what I mean?

240
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:31,180
Like you're seeing your, your first visual impression is this isn't real.

241
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:36,580
And I feel that Disneyland works pretty hard to protect that, that you are entering a magic

242
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:40,620
realm where all of this is tangible and real.

243
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:46,820
And that was my experience with the Halcyon is that like, as you pull up in the Southwest

244
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:52,940
corner of Hollywood studios parking lot, the first thing you see is the scaffolding at

245
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:53,940
the back of Batuu.

246
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:59,620
Like you just see like a mountain cap held up by a steel girder and you're like, Oh yeah,

247
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:06,480
I guess I did splurge and life savings to dress up like a Jedi, pull up in my rental

248
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,780
car into this parking lot to pretend for 48 hours.

249
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:11,340
Of all the spots for sure.

250
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:15,020
That is weird to not like maybe there, when you open that hotel, you would do have to

251
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:17,060
do the other side of the mountain.

252
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:18,420
Maybe that becomes required.

253
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:24,220
I think I expected a little more curation in terms of your entry and, and departure.

254
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:30,140
And like that's, that's just my biggest criticism of it is that as you enter, there's that the

255
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:35,380
sign for it was just a shipping container with like, you know, galactic star cruiser

256
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:37,580
spray painted on it basically.

257
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:41,100
And then the, and then the security guard, which is important and I get, but he's like

258
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:44,460
playing clothes, you know, he's in the white fedora and the short sleeves.

259
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:45,780
He's like, do you have any blaster?

260
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:49,740
You know, you can't have blasters and he like, there's just a lot of denial out of the gate.

261
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:52,380
They're like, you can't role play.

262
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:53,380
Yes.

263
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:58,900
This is thousands of dollars for you to fulfill a lifetime dream of, of existing in a universe

264
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,900
that inspired you to dream.

265
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:04,500
Just speaking for myself, but you can't do it all out.

266
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:10,980
You can go 85% and then like, like pulling up the valets there and like the guys like,

267
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:11,940
what kind of car is this?

268
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:16,140
I'm like, don't ask me that I'm wearing, I'm wearing a vest.

269
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:20,060
I bought off eBay that like, oh, you get, you arrived in it.

270
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:22,020
I read, I read every breakdown.

271
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:24,420
They said, come dressed, get ready to explore the ship.

272
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:25,100
Come ready.

273
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,340
And that was a huge mistake.

274
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:33,380
Cause I felt like, I felt like the fool I was, which is a 40 year old man dressed up

275
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:40,020
as a force sensitive smuggler, like, like spacecraft collector with a name named Jorgan

276
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:40,540
Mel.

277
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:41,060
Wow.

278
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,060
Wow.

279
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:45,940
And then you're pulling up and someone's like, Oh, is this a new Chevy Malibu?

280
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:47,740
Exactly.

281
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:50,300
Like, I think you mean spaceship.

282
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,700
Is this a Chevy Malibu spaceship?

283
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:54,460
It's a lane cruiser.

284
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:55,060
It's a Chevy.

285
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:56,860
It's a speeder bike.

286
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:00,540
Yeah, exactly.

287
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:03,060
And then like, once you're in it, there's so much that's great.

288
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:07,980
Like, I like the rooms, the windows, the digital windows are so impressive.

289
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:08,780
Are you like that?

290
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:10,060
You didn't feel like trapped by that?

291
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:11,020
I did not know.

292
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:14,220
And then they have their like atmospheric recreated, which is just like, you know, a

293
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:15,540
smoking area outside.

294
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:18,740
We're like, we're recreating the temperature on Batu.

295
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:20,820
And it's just like, truly a smoke break area.

296
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,380
It's like where your dog pees at the airport.

297
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:22,900
Yeah.

298
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:28,420
And like, and, and probably like 200 square feet.

299
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:30,260
Like it's, it's like very.

300
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:31,900
A box of outside.

301
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,100
Yes, it just is.

302
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:38,300
And again, like you can kind of hear like people waiting in line for smugglers,

303
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,620
runner, whatever, just on the other side of the wall, you know?

304
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:46,660
But also in that area, like was the experience that I did hope for, which like

305
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:52,140
a Sajay, which was established on the sort of Jedi students, they tell you to

306
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:54,860
collect these rocks and you put it on a big boulder and they're like, place them

307
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:55,580
anywhere you want.

308
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:57,260
And they're like, we can tell you're force sensitive.

309
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:01,420
I've been talking to my fellow crew members that you are in touch with the

310
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:02,900
force. I'm like, yes, yes, that's true.

311
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,980
And he goes, you established that.

312
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,180
So they knew to bring it up.

313
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:06,380
Yes.

314
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:06,620
Wow.

315
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:07,100
Wow.

316
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:10,740
Cause a lot of it's on the phone, which there's good and bad about that.

317
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,940
It's like, why am I staring at my phone when I want to be taken?

318
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:14,780
But also that's how they keep track.

319
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:15,980
And that's very smart.

320
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:19,740
Um, and he goes like, reach out and you reach out and the three rocks you've

321
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:22,660
been like shake on the boulder and then goes, try again.

322
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:26,060
You reach out and they all like swoop towards you with, with

323
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:26,740
our powers.

324
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:27,420
So cool.

325
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:29,780
Like moments like that fully worth it.

326
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:34,260
Like seeing two, like 10 year old kids who are the people I think that

327
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:35,260
experience is really meant for.

328
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:38,940
Um, seeing Chewbacca like hiding in the corner and like freaking out and going

329
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:40,180
like, we'll protect you Chewbacca.

330
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:41,260
Like, wow.

331
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:41,620
Yeah.

332
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:42,580
I still get chills.

333
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:43,500
Like loved all that.

334
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:49,100
But then the tail end is like, they do this big dinner show and the sort of

335
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:53,460
atrium and Kylo Ren fights Ray and they use force things and like he pulls her

336
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:55,220
and she slides and that looks cool.

337
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:58,620
And they're doing, they're doing, you know, stunt show lightsaber battles where

338
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:00,980
the soundtrack of the hits don't always align.

339
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:03,540
So it's like clash.

340
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:06,900
Um, do you think they have, is somebody like live doing it?

341
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:09,740
Is it that style or they have to learn a soundtrack?

342
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:11,020
I think it's choreographed.

343
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:11,180
Yeah.

344
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:15,260
I think that that's too, I think, you know, they choreographed the, like where

345
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:18,100
things land so they can like burn the pipe or whatever.

346
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:18,660
Exactly.

347
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:21,820
I think it's like, my guess would be a soundtrack, but it's fun.

348
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:22,500
It's a spectacle.

349
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:27,140
It's impressive, but like the lightsaber that I purchased there, like Ray goes,

350
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:30,620
you know, like together as one or whatever and puts the lightsaber up and I turn my

351
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:35,580
lightsaber on and then a woman very much in, in, in Taron language goes, sir, sir,

352
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:36,420
please put that down, please.

353
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:37,300
You can't turn that on right now.

354
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:40,300
And I was like, okay, sorry about that.

355
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:44,660
Um, of all the part, you would think that would be allowed and encouraged.

356
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:45,620
Let's kill this guy.

357
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:46,460
They very much.

358
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:49,220
Cause we, let's go Kylo.

359
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:49,500
Yeah.

360
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,700
I'm gonna murder him.

361
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:51,300
Um,

362
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:56,220
and then, and then the next morning, you guys, 7 a.m.

363
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:59,100
you hear the, um, you hear the chime.

364
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:03,260
There's this chime, um, do do do do, you know, and they're like, it's

365
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:05,620
time to disembark it's timed.

366
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:07,780
Get off the ship.

367
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:09,260
Get off.

368
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,220
We have to clean this.

369
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:12,860
We have to turn it around for the next people are coming at 1 p.m.

370
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:14,460
Get out of here.

371
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,060
Wow.

372
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:19,980
And it just, that left me feeling real chilly of like, oh, but, but this was,

373
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:22,580
isn't there going to be some sort of like, thank you.

374
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:23,860
And you saved it.

375
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:28,460
Here's your, here's your, you know, at least a late checkout option.

376
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,780
Blue milk vouch something.

377
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:36,220
They're like, get out of here.

378
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:39,260
Um, I thought you left after the S this whole time.

379
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:41,900
I thought it was the ceremony and then goodbye soldier.

380
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,580
And then, but now you sleep weirdly.

381
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:45,660
And I didn't know that either.

382
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:46,980
That's a weird seam.

383
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:47,740
That's weird.

384
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:52,700
It's, it was, it was a bummer because it's, it's like a full like walk of shame.

385
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:53,900
You know what I mean?

386
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:58,300
Like you're gathering your like motorcycle Jedi boots and like shoving them into

387
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:02,460
your suitcase, the world where it's not encouraged anymore.

388
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:03,500
Like, what am I wearing?

389
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,100
What am I doing?

390
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:04,860
Kids are crying.

391
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:06,060
They don't want to leave.

392
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:07,540
Like, you're just like, and they're like, thank you.

393
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:07,740
Thank you.

394
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:08,980
This way, this way, this way.

395
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:13,420
And then you pull out, you know, like you drive away and you're like, you kind of

396
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:14,660
look back, like, I want to take it in.

397
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:18,180
And it's fully just an office, a square office building.

398
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:18,860
You know what I mean?

399
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:21,900
With like, it's a sound, it's just a square sound stage.

400
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:24,260
And now you're back with the scaffolding of Batu.

401
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:30,580
And it's, I was just like, ah, the entry and the exit are really rough, but, but

402
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:33,700
while in there, there are some real magical moments.

403
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:34,020
Sure.

404
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:34,180
Sure.

405
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:34,460
Sure.

406
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:39,660
So if they had massaged some of this experience, that could have been a way to help it.

407
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:40,940
Wait, that's a good question.

408
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:46,940
If you, if you had to save it, not to make you put on the president of parks hat,

409
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:48,260
that's a high pressure hat.

410
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:53,940
But if you had, if there was some move, is it, is it, well, it feels like cost or

411
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:57,780
size or, yeah, those seem like big ones.

412
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:58,780
Yeah, it's tricky.

413
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:02,020
I mean, cause, cause all that presentational stuff is like the trees hadn't grown in

414
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:05,180
yet or whatever, you know, like that's like, we'll fix that over time.

415
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:13,060
I think it's like, uh, in the podcast where you covered it, they, he talked about

416
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:18,780
the, um, the heist and that was by far like the coolest thing to be a part of an

417
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:23,060
adventure of a narrative story that's happening that only 12 of the passengers

418
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:27,660
know about and other now that's full immersion that ruled.

419
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:32,860
And like, so I think it's like folding more of that in, but I definitely think

420
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:37,540
you, I could feel the performance union limitations.

421
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:38,780
That makes sense.

422
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:44,060
I could feel people like needed a break, like the, the person, somebody, somebody

423
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:47,340
couldn't come into your room and like with a secret mission at two in the morning

424
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:48,660
because they need a sleep break.

425
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:49,540
Exactly.

426
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:51,460
And like they weren't on the clock till 4 PM.

427
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:52,300
You know what I mean?

428
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:56,900
Like, um, so like that's that like, how, how do you massage that?

429
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,180
How do you figure that out?

430
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:00,380
Um, yeah.

431
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:07,380
And I just think, yeah, I think, I think more is the most unfair, simplest answer,

432
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:12,660
but it just like, even in 48 hours, you started to feel some of the repetition

433
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:13,420
too, right?

434
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:15,740
So it's tricky.

435
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:19,860
It's tricky, but also let people have their lightsabers on mainly that

436
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,340
first one, especially you.

437
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:25,660
And if you go back to galaxy's edge, you should be able to do it wherever you

438
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:27,900
want in a restaurant line in the bathroom.

439
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:34,260
If you're charging close to $200 for a lightsaber, let the, let the people turn

440
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:34,580
it on.

441
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:35,020
Yeah.

442
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:37,340
If it looks weird, like they brought it from home.

443
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:37,820
Yeah.

444
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:38,860
Clock that person.

445
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:40,260
If it's burning actual metal.

446
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:47,860
If there's a smell or a sound that isn't like the ones that you know, we sell.

447
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:48,140
Yeah.

448
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:50,340
You know, that's bullets somehow.

449
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:50,740
Yeah.

450
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:52,740
And they've maybe rigged it up to be more of a gun.

451
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:52,900
Yeah.

452
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:53,980
They checked on the blast.

453
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:55,060
A gunsaber.

454
00:19:56,940 --> 00:20:01,460
Did you ever, you did like, you did star Wars material on Saturday Night Live and

455
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:06,180
other like, I feel like you got to like use that position to explore your like

456
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:07,460
childhood interests.

457
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:11,100
And was there ever, was there ever some moment where you're like, wow, I'm being

458
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:15,260
oddly specific about this costume or this set because it has to be this way,

459
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:16,740
because I know it so well.

460
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:17,980
Certainly.

461
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:24,580
But the beauty, particularly of those star Wars sketches is that like the film

462
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:28,660
crew, like they have like the film unit and there's the like digital short unit,

463
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:32,380
you know, like they broke off all these like small production units.

464
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:36,620
The crews of those were equally about Star Wars.

465
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:37,780
So we would show up.

466
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:40,740
I remember for like undercover boss, Kylo Ren.

467
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:41,020
Yeah.

468
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:41,340
Yeah.

469
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:46,380
I'd been there at that point, five or six years, and it was the most impressive

470
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:49,940
build in specificity, in caliber and scale.

471
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:50,300
Wow.

472
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:55,260
And Reese Thomas, the director, was like, yeah, we were talking, we want to have

473
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:57,340
some some TIE fighters flying in the background.

474
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:57,900
You'll see the hangar.

475
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,860
We're like, OK, that rules.

476
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:00,660
That's awesome.

477
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:06,020
Like seeing, we did like the Force Awakens where it's like all, you know, all of

478
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:10,140
our favorite heroes from the original trilogy aged up and they made a Millennium

479
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:11,340
Falcon cockpit.

480
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:16,060
And that was like a labor of love because the board was just like, you know, like

481
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:21,780
a Yamaha sound mixer and then and then game buttons taped to a black.

482
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:26,060
But yeah, but you could tell so much effort went into trying to recreate it as

483
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:26,820
much as possible.

484
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:27,540
Sure, sure, sure.

485
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:28,660
As close as they could get.

486
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:28,940
Yeah.

487
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:29,260
Yeah.

488
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:30,100
Oh, that's incredible.

489
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:35,260
So pre Galaxy's Edge, you've you had built yourself immersion experiences.

490
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:36,420
Essentially a few of them.

491
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:36,980
Yeah, yeah.

492
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:37,540
A few of them.

493
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:37,820
Yeah.

494
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:41,940
And then Galaxy's Edge happens and you got to go to the opening, you were saying.

495
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:42,540
Correct.

496
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:49,500
I've I have reached out to my air quotes people for two favors ever for two, like

497
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,620
outside of work favors.

498
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:54,860
One was for to connect me to somebody for season tickets when the Rams were coming

499
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:55,260
back.

500
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:56,540
I'm a big football fan.

501
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:57,100
I love the Rams.

502
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:01,940
And so that that was an awesome connection and a huge perk.

503
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:06,940
And the second one, honest to goodness, was you have to get me into the opening of

504
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:07,620
Star Wars land.

505
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:07,980
Wow.

506
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:12,340
Like if you can't swing that for me, I think I'll quit the business.

507
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:13,180
I'll quit.

508
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:13,900
I'll just stop.

509
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:16,060
If all this work isn't worth that then.

510
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:20,940
And I was such a pain in the ass about it that by the time the day like the day the

511
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:25,220
event started, like 4 p.m., but I made my wife go like it like we dropped the kids

512
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:25,660
off at school.

513
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:27,900
We went to the parks and I was like, let's just take in the parks.

514
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:29,260
Let's see if we can check in early.

515
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:30,140
Let's see if we can get in.

516
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,500
And they're like, no, you cannot.

517
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:32,980
Please enjoy the parks.

518
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:34,820
And we walked around and we had a nice day.

519
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:37,340
And then I was there like 3 30 for the 4 p.m.

520
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:37,860
Check in.

521
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:44,060
And they had like Disneyland PR person greet us and they're like, hello, Taryn.

522
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:45,420
We're so happy to have you here.

523
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:46,460
You're very excited.

524
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:51,460
Seattle dossier preparation for sensitive.

525
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:52,740
Perhaps is what we heard.

526
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:53,820
Hello, Tara.

527
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:54,220
Where is it?

528
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:54,820
Jorgen.

529
00:22:56,060 --> 00:23:00,020
And yeah, I just like Star Wars is it.

530
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:02,100
It's it is like I love Disney.

531
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:02,380
I love it.

532
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:05,420
Like Star Wars is my number one has been since before.

533
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:06,780
I can remember.

534
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:07,100
Yeah.

535
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:07,260
Yeah.

536
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:12,700
And so they are like, we've we've arranged for a very special evening for you.

537
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:18,020
And they brought us into 21 Royal Suite, like the dream suite above pirates.

538
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:18,660
Oh, yeah.

539
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:21,740
And so we walked through there and we saw the two good night kisses.

540
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:26,900
Like there's a there's there's a like so guests who stay there get

541
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:28,460
locked in when the park closes.

542
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:29,700
Oh, I don't know any of this.

543
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:32,060
They have a butler that stays there with you.

544
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:32,460
Really?

545
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:33,260
Wow.

546
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:36,780
To help if you need anything, but also make sure you don't sneak back into the

547
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:37,460
park or whatever.

548
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:37,820
Yeah.

549
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:39,780
And it's a two bedroom suite.

550
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:43,500
And there's like there's the prime bedroom, which has the big king bed and is

551
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:46,780
much more part of its adventure land.

552
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:48,820
It's like adventure land, fairy tale land.

553
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:51,820
And the and there's something called a good night kiss.

554
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:52,780
Do we know this term?

555
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:53,060
Yeah.

556
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:53,380
Yeah.

557
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:55,740
No, it's from characters waving before you leave.

558
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:56,340
Yes.

559
00:23:56,380 --> 00:24:02,020
So this is they put it into the room in that as you go to bed, you hit the good

560
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:07,100
night kiss button and the lighting changes and it starts to rain and the

561
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:12,340
painting above the bed, like mermaids come to life and dive in the water.

562
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:17,300
And then you see Captain Hook's pirate ship fly in silhouette across the bed.

563
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:18,340
As you wild.

564
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:19,460
Yeah, beautiful.

565
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:23,700
And then in the sort of like kids bedroom, which is like two twin beds, which has a

566
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:28,580
much more frontier land themed vibe inside the good night kisses, there's a

567
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:31,500
toy train that goes around a shelf at the top of the room.

568
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:36,380
And what you realize is that all the little chotch keys behind that represent

569
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:37,660
different lands in the park.

570
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:41,780
So there's like a Matterhorn where little people hike and there's like, yeah, it's

571
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:44,020
really, it's beautiful and specific and awesome.

572
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:46,220
Can you activate it or is it do it like on a time?

573
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:47,300
There's a button you hit.

574
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:47,460
Yeah.

575
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:47,780
Okay.

576
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:48,900
You turn out the lights.

577
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:51,100
There's like a good night kiss button that they show you.

578
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:54,980
And can you do it a 25 to 40?

579
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:55,780
That's my question.

580
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:55,980
Yeah.

581
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:59,700
I didn't get to find that out, but you shouldn't get to stay there.

582
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:01,980
Do you know where the Butler stays?

583
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:07,300
Um, I know the hallway he enters from, if that makes sense.

584
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:08,820
He doesn't have like a room in the room.

585
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:10,340
He does not have his own quarters.

586
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:11,620
It's not like Downton Abbey.

587
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:11,780
Okay.

588
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:12,580
That's what I was picturing.

589
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:15,060
Disney Downton, Downton Disney Abbey.

590
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:17,300
There's like a little bell on your nightstand.

591
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:17,860
Yeah.

592
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:18,100
Yeah.

593
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:18,260
Yeah.

594
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:18,340
Yeah.

595
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:18,980
Yeah.

596
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:21,060
And it comes in just in a character.

597
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:23,300
Like it's Smee in a character.

598
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:25,140
Um, he's bumbling.

599
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:25,460
Yeah.

600
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:25,540
Yeah.

601
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:25,860
Yeah.

602
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:26,900
Yeah.

603
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:29,140
He can't talk though, cause he's got the character head on.

604
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:32,420
So he's still, it's all miming like thirsty.

605
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:35,700
Raising it up to his mouth.

606
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:39,540
Um, so we got to see that and then they're like, okay, the, the Star Wars land,

607
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:40,900
galaxy's edge is open.

608
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:43,060
And we go in and I was like, so emotional.

609
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:46,980
And my wife is filming me and laughing hilariously because she like doesn't share the same

610
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:49,860
enthusiasm, but she knew what it meant for me.

611
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,980
Um, but like seeing an X-wing, you know what I mean?

612
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:57,380
Just seeing an X-wing in scale there and an A-wing parked next to it.

613
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:04,180
And, and, and that transition on through the cave is just like, they did such a great job.

614
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:05,860
They did such a good job.

615
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:10,420
And I said, my only goal while I'm here is I want to build a lightsaber cause I just

616
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:11,780
hear that that's going to be awesome.

617
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:12,420
And they're like, sure.

618
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:12,820
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

619
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:13,940
We can help arrange that.

620
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:18,740
And they said, we have a little, uh, area for you to sit in before the show starts.

621
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:19,380
And I was like, great.

622
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:22,820
And I go and I sit and it's in a booth and it's kind of like attached to the restaurant

623
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:28,420
across from like, um, Savi's workshop or where they like sell the nice lightsabers, the,

624
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:31,220
the hammerhead, uh, uh, yeah.

625
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:32,260
The end of antiquities.

626
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:32,660
There we go.

627
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:33,160
Exactly.

628
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:33,460
Yeah.

629
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:33,940
Yeah.

630
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:34,980
Doc on dark.

631
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:35,220
Yes.

632
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:35,700
Thank you.

633
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:37,140
We're looking for you.

634
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:39,060
We were looking for doc on dark.

635
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:40,580
I'm sorry, but you get no points.

636
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:45,540
And I'm sitting there and a guy walks up and he's like, hi, Terran.

637
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:46,500
Hey, nice to meet you.

638
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,020
I work for Lucasfilm.

639
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:49,460
We know you're a big fan.

640
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:50,260
Mark Hamill's here.

641
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:51,060
Would you like to meet him?

642
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:51,940
Ah, wow.

643
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:52,420
Oh yeah.

644
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:54,100
Yeah.

645
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:54,420
Yeah.

646
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:54,980
I'd like that.

647
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:55,620
No, thanks.

648
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:59,140
More green milk, please.

649
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:01,460
That guy is weird.

650
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:08,180
So I walk over and I get to say hi to Mark and he'd sent a video as a favor for a birthday.

651
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:11,620
And like, so we talked about it and we're, you know, and I got to say to him like,

652
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:18,180
this has got to be so surreal for you because like, at one point you were a 21 year old kid

653
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:20,740
looking for parking for this audition for a space movie.

654
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:22,740
Like, and now you're here.

655
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:24,260
And he was so kind.

656
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:25,140
He's like, yeah.

657
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:28,660
And at one point he's talking to me and he looks down and I'm wearing star wars shoes

658
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:32,660
with like Luke Skywalker, like they're like vans.

659
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:36,820
So it's just Luke Skywalker on the flat part of my foot.

660
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:38,260
He's like, I like your shoes.

661
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:41,460
And I had to go, I'm so sorry.

662
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:42,420
I'm such a big fan.

663
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:46,980
And so like, that was like just the right amount of embarrassing.

664
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:49,140
And then the show starts and we all cruise.

665
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:51,620
Oh, this is a fun tangential.

666
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:56,580
But at that, in that area, Kevin Feige was there and that's where he told Kobe that she

667
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:58,740
was a scroll at the end of the Spiderman.

668
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:00,020
Really?

669
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:00,740
Yes.

670
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:01,140
Wow.

671
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:08,340
Because that, that credit scene of her and Sam in the car was scripted for the very beginning

672
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:12,820
of the movie and they took pieces from that and then added that whole thing.

673
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:14,660
Kobe's like, what's a scroll?

674
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:17,540
And I had to explain it to her as we were walking towards the Millennium Falcon.

675
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:18,820
That's actually very cool.

676
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:19,140
Trust me.

677
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:20,340
It's a big deal.

678
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:21,140
Very exciting.

679
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:23,860
It's going to blow it is literally like expand the world.

680
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:24,740
Like you wouldn't believe it.

681
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:25,780
Jack Kirby, Jack Kirby.

682
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:27,380
Yeah, exactly.

683
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:30,340
Remember that shirt that you hate washing and folding with all the faces on it.

684
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:31,220
That's Jack Kirby's art.

685
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:39,380
And so we get there and like, you know, I'm, I'm next to Kevin Feige and Peyton Reed

686
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:42,260
and like Brie Larson is nearby and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.

687
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:44,020
Like that's the kind of gathering it was.

688
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:45,540
Oh my God.

689
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:46,900
Weird and like.

690
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:48,420
Different kind of Avengers team, but.

691
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:51,860
Still a powerful one.

692
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:52,100
Yeah.

693
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:52,260
Yeah.

694
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:52,500
Yeah.

695
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,380
Like he's a smart one.

696
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:54,580
He's written a lot of books.

697
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:55,540
That's right.

698
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:56,260
The wisest.

699
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:59,220
He knows how to organize.

700
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:06,100
And so it starts in Bob Iger's they're doing his spiel and George Lucas talks and it's like,

701
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:06,900
that's awesome.

702
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:08,900
And then he brings out Mark and that's awesome.

703
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:12,180
And then they bring out Billy Dee Williams and that's even awesomer.

704
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:17,140
And then Bob Iger goes, well, without further ado, let's start up this millennium, you know,

705
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:19,940
bucket of bolts or whatever like pattern they've written for him.

706
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:25,140
And a Chewbacca shows up in the cockpit and goes, and he does the started, but he goes,

707
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:28,020
like the hyperdrive is not working.

708
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:33,060
And Iger goes, oh, dang, does anybody have any experience with millennium falcons?

709
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:39,300
And you hear like, Aldous and Harrison Ford marches out and the crowd loses its mind.

710
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:41,700
Like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, like had tears in his eyes.

711
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:42,740
He's like screaming.

712
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:47,380
And Peter Mayhew had just passed away like weeks earlier.

713
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:48,020
Right.

714
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:51,780
And you could like look back and see the teleprompter that they were reading off of

715
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:53,620
because they were like televising this.

716
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:58,500
And there's this beautiful moment that comes up where it says like, Harrison crosses to

717
00:29:58,500 --> 00:29:59,140
Millennium Falcon.

718
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:00,980
He goes, Peter, this is for you.

719
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:05,060
And then he hits the thing and I'm like, welling up already and just reading the teleprompter.

720
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:11,860
But the way the way it was executed was great because he walks over and Harrison does like

721
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:12,980
a dramatic pause.

722
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:17,380
So he goes like, and Peter and he raises a fist.

723
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:20,580
But I think the fist was the visual cue for the sound guy.

724
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:22,180
So he goes, Peter.

725
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:28,660
And it starts and they launch fireworks and Harrison Ford screams, this is for you.

726
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:33,380
The whole it was fantastic.

727
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:34,260
It was everything I wanted.

728
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:37,060
The least somber tribute to anyone ever.

729
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:37,700
Exactly.

730
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:40,100
I'm sure Peter, wherever he is, is rolling his eyes like that, man.

731
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:40,980
That makes sense.

732
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:41,620
That's fine.

733
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:42,100
Yeah.

734
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:44,660
Rugged for 30 years, sweat my butt off.

735
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:46,260
They can't give me one quiet.

736
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:47,940
Nice little moment.

737
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:51,140
Everybody bottlenecks and the smugglers run.

738
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:54,740
We get off and I'm like, I'd like to make a lightsaber.

739
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:56,660
They're like, of course we can do that.

740
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:59,300
We also would like to invite you to Club 33.

741
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:00,660
And I'd never been.

742
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:01,940
Yeah.

743
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:04,900
And I was like, oh my gosh.

744
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:05,780
Oh my gosh.

745
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:07,460
You have a choice now.

746
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:09,540
Can I build the lightsaber first?

747
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:09,860
No.

748
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:10,500
I said that.

749
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:13,620
And the Disney PR people had to talk me down.

750
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:17,140
Like the tartan I was with was like, I think just go to the club.

751
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:19,060
The lightsaber experience will be here.

752
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:20,980
Just go to beer for a while.

753
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:22,340
And so I compromised.

754
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:25,540
I said, OK, let's at least walk through the shops.

755
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:31,060
So I bought like a Jabba's Hut toad and a T-shirt, a Black Spire T-shirt.

756
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:36,180
And I have like three Disney employees following me around as I'm holding bags of merch.

757
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:37,780
You just supermarket sweeped it.

758
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:38,580
Let's throw that in.

759
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:39,060
Exactly.

760
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:39,700
That's OK.

761
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:41,700
I'm technically going in the direction of Club 33.

762
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:43,860
Living with Michael Jackson in Dock on Dars.

763
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,060
I'll take that one.

764
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:46,020
I'll take that one.

765
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:46,660
I'll take that one.

766
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:47,300
I'll take that one.

767
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:48,260
I'll take those.

768
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:48,980
Take that robe.

769
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:53,780
And so we go to 33 and it's just Kobe and I in there and the staff.

770
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:54,100
Oh my god.

771
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:56,820
And I'm like, this is unbelievable.

772
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:57,620
This is incredible.

773
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:59,780
This is the greatest night of my life already.

774
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:02,980
And we sit there for 45 minutes just kind of shooting the shit with the bartenders.

775
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:04,580
And we get to see the jazz club.

776
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:05,700
We get to see the dining room.

777
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:08,420
And this is, I'd heard about this since like third grade.

778
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:09,460
Like, that's not real.

779
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:11,620
And it was so crazy to be there.

780
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:13,540
And then employees start filing in.

781
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:16,340
And there's only like eventually like 10 or 12.

782
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:21,620
But we realize that we're at Disney corporate's PR celebration party.

783
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:28,420
So it's like, it's like the head, like, Iger's number two in command hosting a party for her team.

784
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:28,980
Oh my god.

785
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:30,420
And then Kobe and I.

786
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:31,140
Geez.

787
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:31,780
Wow.

788
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:35,940
All the people who've all been in crazy succession stories in the newspaper articles.

789
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:36,420
100%.

790
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:37,380
We could see the Tom.

791
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:38,980
We could see, yeah.

792
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:39,540
Christine.

793
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:40,020
We could see the world.

794
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:40,740
Yeah.

795
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:41,220
Wow.

796
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:42,100
Geez.

797
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:43,460
Wheelers and dealers.

798
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:47,700
And they go around the room like, when they announced this five years ago,

799
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:49,220
this was the night we were building towards.

800
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:53,540
And every person in this room is responsible for the success of this evening.

801
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:57,300
Bill, the way your marketing campaign was extraordinary.

802
00:32:57,300 --> 00:33:00,500
And Kirsten, the way that you handled press for this.

803
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:03,220
And our two guests who are also here.

804
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:05,060
So Kobe and I.

805
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:06,180
You helped too.

806
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:06,660
Yeah.

807
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:09,460
We're happy you're here to grab onto our coattails.

808
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:10,820
Why is it only you?

809
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:12,100
Where's Kareem?

810
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:13,380
Kareem didn't even want to.

811
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:14,580
Kareem didn't even want to.

812
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:15,780
Never heard about this.

813
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:16,980
Never heard of this club.

814
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:19,380
I think he probably had already done that.

815
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:21,140
He's like, I want to ride Smuggler.

816
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:23,940
I want to be an engineer on Smuggler's Run and I want to go home.

817
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:24,660
Sure.

818
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:25,540
Can he fit in there?

819
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:26,100
I wonder.

820
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:27,300
That's a good question.

821
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:28,180
Yeah, that's a great question.

822
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:30,820
He has to sit sideways like English style.

823
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:32,420
You can do it if you go on the floor.

824
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:32,920
Right.

825
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:40,260
And so we took our cue, but not before getting an application for 233.

826
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:44,820
You just put that when the tab comes and one membership please.

827
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:45,380
If you don't mind.

828
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:52,660
Literally have never been more charismatic and charming and like, hi, this is so not.

829
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:54,340
What a dream job to be here.

830
00:33:57,780 --> 00:34:01,460
And so they're like, if you're serious here, email this tomorrow.

831
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:01,700
Wow.

832
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:04,020
Email, I think, at about 10 AM in the morning.

833
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:06,820
On the way home.

834
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:07,460
Exactly.

835
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:08,740
Like, I had a draft ready.

836
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:10,180
And then.

837
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:10,660
Wow.

838
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:10,900
Yeah.

839
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:17,700
And then, yeah, so we, and it was like, I had to kind of talk Kobe into it because it's like.

840
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:20,500
Some major decision.

841
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:21,000
Exactly.

842
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:25,300
And being the superb wife she is supported it.

843
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:29,460
So yeah, in August 2019, we became Club 33 members.

844
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:29,940
Wow.

845
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:34,820
And then in March 2020, we were no longer on the membership because of COVID.

846
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:36,660
Dude, was there ever.

847
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:41,540
But was there ever to do like that you were able to do it a little sooner?

848
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:45,780
Was there any early or just like, can we just go there and look at the empty park?

849
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:46,980
Or was it like fully shut off?

850
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:49,060
Could you get the vaccine early at Club 33?

851
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:50,660
Yeah, they had the Mickey vaccine.

852
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:51,140
Yeah, yeah.

853
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:53,860
October 2020.

854
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:59,860
They had a soft opening the day before it reopened.

855
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:00,420
Okay.

856
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:02,340
But I would imagine you felt the same way.

857
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:07,860
Like when Disney closed, that was even after Tom Hanks, like the Tom Hanks of it all is when

858
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:09,300
people are like, this is important.

859
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,900
I was like, it will be fine.

860
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:14,020
When Disney closed, I was like, oh no.

861
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:15,700
Yeah, yeah, that was a day.

862
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:18,820
Hey, and for us who have to talk about these things for like.

863
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:19,140
Yeah.

864
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:23,540
Well, I hope this doesn't keep us out of here for the year and a half.

865
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:29,780
Keep us killing time because we can't talk about new attractions for a long time.

866
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:33,300
You can only talk about Silver Dollar City so many times.

867
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:35,300
Somehow we haven't.

868
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:36,660
That's one of them amazingly.

869
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:37,700
Is that Branson?

870
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:38,020
Yes.

871
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:38,660
Oh, wow.

872
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:39,460
Back pocket.

873
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:48,260
I remember when that all was happening, like we were going to get together and record in person

874
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:51,540
an episode about the Main Street Electrical Parade.

875
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:56,580
And then they're like, maybe we address what's going on first.

876
00:35:57,300 --> 00:36:02,420
Maybe we do an episode that's a little more topical and maybe let's try this video chatting

877
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:04,260
software and make sure it works.

878
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:06,100
I think it's called Zombs.

879
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:07,220
Yeah, exactly.

880
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:12,900
So once we got a little more used to that, we circled back around to the electrical parade

881
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:16,980
because we're like, anything else we could talk about would be great right now.

882
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:22,580
The moment where we all met our horrible master for the many years to come,

883
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:26,020
the zoom windows, we got acquainted to the Zombs.

884
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:28,180
Hey, we're here in person now.

885
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:28,660
Love that.

886
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:29,160
Next.

887
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:34,500
As you just, you're still COVID still a thing in our lives.

888
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:35,460
Glad you made it through.

889
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:36,660
Delayed this episode.

890
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:37,140
Yeah, yeah.

891
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:37,640
Right.

892
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:41,140
Phantom of COVID is still in our lives.

893
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:41,380
Yes.

894
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:42,020
Yeah.

895
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:44,340
But now, as you say, you're like, you're stronger than ever.

896
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:45,140
You're the least.

897
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:46,420
If we all had it, if we were all.

898
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:47,780
Dare me to punch through that wall.

899
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:48,020
Wow.

900
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:48,500
Yeah, yeah.

901
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:48,980
Let's do it.

902
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:49,480
Let's do it.

903
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:51,620
Whoa.

904
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:53,620
I don't know if you know that was not a sound effect we added.

905
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:54,660
I need a doctor.

906
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:55,380
All right, that's the end of that.

907
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:56,180
We're going to check on you.

908
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:56,660
Wow.

909
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:57,140
You kind of survived.

910
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:58,340
If I guess I read, you hurt yourself.

911
00:36:58,340 --> 00:37:00,340
I didn't know anyone had that much blood in them.

912
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:02,820
Weld up in their fist.

913
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:03,320
Yeah.

914
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:06,180
Geez, well, what a crazy journey.

915
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:07,540
Wait, you know what else about that?

916
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:11,300
Club 33 must have been that like, because I thought about kids at college at that time.

917
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:16,740
So you just still have to keep paying for college while you can't be at the college.

918
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:16,820
Yes.

919
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:22,900
In Club 33, it's like, do we still, does this apply to us for this year and a half?

920
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:29,940
What they would do, the way that they sort of helped reinforce it, they paused membership.

921
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:30,420
They did.

922
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:31,220
Oh, OK.

923
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:31,700
They did.

924
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:32,500
They handled it great.

925
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:38,020
And then they would send you recipes for different appetizers they were going to do or cook.

926
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:40,020
They handled it really, really well.

927
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:40,340
Wow.

928
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:40,820
Yeah.

929
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:41,540
Yeah.

930
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:43,540
Did you try them or were those intense?

931
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:44,420
Every single one.

932
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:44,740
Really?

933
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:48,420
I became such a barista for my wife and I in that time.

934
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:48,740
Wow.

935
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:50,980
I don't know if anybody else took to drinking during that time.

936
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:52,420
Yeah, yeah.

937
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:54,260
Picked up an escalator.

938
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:57,220
I was doing Carthay Manhattan's a let home.

939
00:37:57,220 --> 00:37:59,380
Better go get that specific kind of bullet.

940
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:01,300
Barnum's Vacation.

941
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:05,540
That's my favorite that I've had at the 33.

942
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:06,180
What is that?

943
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:10,660
It's like, it's a rum peach drink and it is exquisite.

944
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:15,780
Like a peach liqueur, white rum, a little egg white.

945
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:17,220
It's superb.

946
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:17,540
Wow.

947
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:22,500
We got to go once to Club 33 and I was, I don't even know if I knew it at the time,

948
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:27,060
but I'm very captivated by the exclusive merch.

949
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:28,580
Are you like the teeth?

950
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:31,460
They have like a Walt Tiki mug recently I saw.

951
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:32,340
Do you have these?

952
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:33,060
I own this.

953
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:33,300
Yeah.

954
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:33,620
Yeah.

955
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:34,420
Familiar with this.

956
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:39,140
The Tiki mugs in particular are my sweet spot.

957
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:39,460
Okay.

958
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:40,820
So Trader Sam's as well.

959
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:41,220
Yep.

960
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:44,740
And I really have to like pace myself.

961
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:45,060
Sure.

962
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:49,620
I bought myself one windbreaker, like my first official visit as a member.

963
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:50,500
I was like, this is it.

964
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:51,860
This is all I'll need.

965
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:57,220
And with every new hat, sweatshirt, like, you know, a duster that they come out with.

966
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:57,380
Wow.

967
00:38:57,380 --> 00:38:58,340
Do you have a duster?

968
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:00,980
No, I would love a duster though.

969
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:01,860
That'd be amazing.

970
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:04,740
It's, it's a dangerous thing and they know it.

971
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:05,140
They know.

972
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:05,380
Yeah.

973
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:05,780
Yes.

974
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:06,180
They know it.

975
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:07,460
They're your dealer.

976
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:07,940
Yes.

977
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:08,340
Exactly.

978
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:09,300
They know what's going on.

979
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:15,860
Do I want, do I want the shag Tiki mug in blue or the metallic gold reflective Tiki mug?

980
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:17,540
I think probably both.

981
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:18,180
Just do all.

982
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:19,380
You may as well get both.

983
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:20,900
I should get both.

984
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:21,140
Yeah.

985
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:24,100
And probably backups just in case accidents happen.

986
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:25,860
Just pre-order them all.

987
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:29,940
Just like assume, just put it on my tab when you have a new, don't even make me read about what it is.

988
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:32,340
If you tell me where the factory is, I'll pick them up.

989
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:34,180
I'll save it.

990
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:36,260
I want it as fast, I want it still hot.

991
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:37,540
I want it not safe to touch.

992
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:42,660
I want to like put my thumb print into the bottom when it's still like just malleable enough.

993
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:44,180
Write my name really quick.

994
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:47,620
Having a baby has prevented me from driving down just to get the Tiki,

995
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:49,780
like the Haunted Mansion Tiki mug first day.

996
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:50,180
Yeah.

997
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:50,500
You know.

998
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:52,820
I have the, I have the two busts.

999
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:54,180
We have those Tiki mugs.

1000
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:55,060
They did that a few years back.

1001
00:39:55,060 --> 00:40:00,660
I have the first round of Hatbox ghosts from both coasts because one has the face on the face and

1002
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:03,460
one has the face in the Hatbox and they sold them different.

1003
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:04,260
They were different.

1004
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:06,980
So I had to pay a premium to get the one from the.

1005
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:08,580
From the East Coast.

1006
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:10,020
So you have all my respect.

1007
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:10,420
Yeah.

1008
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:11,620
This is a viable tech.

1009
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:14,740
It could have been the topic is the actually that's the topic.

1010
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:16,420
The mugs from all of these.

1011
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:16,740
Yeah.

1012
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:17,060
Yeah.

1013
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:17,700
Oh yeah.

1014
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:20,020
Also haven't gotten to the topic so we still.

1015
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:20,180
Yeah.

1016
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:20,500
Yeah.

1017
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:22,180
Well, we can decide whatever we want.

1018
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:22,900
That is true.

1019
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:25,460
I was thinking, yes, we can completely change.

1020
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:25,940
Yeah.

1021
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:28,500
This is an interactive choose your own adventure experience.

1022
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:37,060
But having said that, we talked about Remy's Ratatouille adventure as a ride.

1023
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:41,780
You've been on recently and passionate about it and that you've been on in both of its forms.

1024
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:42,340
Correct.

1025
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:43,940
Because it is in Paris.

1026
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:48,260
It's in Walt Disney Studios Paris Park and it is in Epcot as of two years ago.

1027
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:48,580
Yes.

1028
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:55,620
So when I went to Galactic Star Cruiser, I gave myself an extra two days to take everything in.

1029
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:56,500
Oh, great.

1030
00:40:56,500 --> 00:41:00,900
I was two weeks before Tron opened so I didn't get to do Tron.

1031
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:01,220
Yeah.

1032
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:04,100
But I did Galactic Rewind.

1033
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:05,220
Oh, you made it for that.

1034
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:06,660
We were saying we would love to talk about that.

1035
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:07,460
We haven't gotten to do it yet.

1036
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:08,340
We're going soon.

1037
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:09,060
Luckily.

1038
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:10,340
I can't wait to hear what you think.

1039
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:13,380
I'm two very enthusiastic thumbs up.

1040
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:13,620
Wow.

1041
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:14,020
Wow.

1042
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:14,260
Great.

1043
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:14,900
What was your song?

1044
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:15,380
What did you get?

1045
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:17,460
My first one was Gloria Estefan.

1046
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:18,500
Come on, everybody.

1047
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:18,820
Yeah.

1048
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:19,540
Come get it.

1049
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:20,340
Sure.

1050
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:21,060
That's what I want.

1051
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:21,940
I want that one.

1052
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:23,140
I want Tears for Fears.

1053
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:23,540
Tears for Fears.

1054
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:24,260
That's what I want.

1055
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:24,740
Oh, right.

1056
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:25,860
They have you.

1057
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:27,060
I like September too.

1058
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:27,460
These are all.

1059
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:28,100
They're really good.

1060
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:28,740
We went twice.

1061
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:29,780
We got September and we got...

1062
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:30,180
Okay.

1063
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:30,420
Yeah.

1064
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:35,140
I feel like they're better even selections than Mission Breakout.

1065
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:37,140
Even though I like Mission Breakout songs a lot.

1066
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:38,580
I like the songs.

1067
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:40,820
I liked these songs in advance more.

1068
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:41,540
That's what I agree.

1069
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:45,860
My understanding is that it was when it opened, it was a huge library.

1070
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:47,620
It was like 99 different songs.

1071
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:48,100
Oh my God.

1072
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:48,260
Really?

1073
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:51,940
And that they aired it down to the six or seven that everybody,

1074
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:55,140
all the Imagineers agreed on were like, that's always good.

1075
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:55,380
Okay.

1076
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:55,700
Okay.

1077
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:59,220
I heard they can't all work on roller coaster patterns.

1078
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:00,660
That's a tall order for a song.

1079
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:01,700
Mad World by...

1080
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:03,700
Oh, yeah.

1081
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:04,980
It's an eerie effect.

1082
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:05,620
It's interesting.

1083
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:09,620
People are jumping off the ride.

1084
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:10,580
Who raised both hands?

1085
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:14,660
I heard they played September on the all day on the 21st.

1086
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:15,860
On the day on the 21st.

1087
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:16,980
They did it.

1088
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:17,380
Yeah.

1089
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:18,740
That's a nice thing.

1090
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:19,860
They should keep doing that.

1091
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:22,020
So you covered that.

1092
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:29,860
And then I went to see Paris and the Ratatouille area, which was wonderful.

1093
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:33,460
I had done the original one in Paris in 2018.

1094
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:40,740
Koby was shooting a movie in UK and because she's a superb wife and I'm a not good husband,

1095
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:43,220
I said, let's take the train to Paris.

1096
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:45,220
And she's like, yes, Disneyland.

1097
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:46,980
Oh, I'm waiting for it.

1098
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:48,740
A little farther away from Paris.

1099
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:53,540
And so, yeah, so we got to do it there.

1100
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:59,460
And the Paris one's wonderful because you're in Paris, so that feels appropriate.

1101
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:01,380
And the restaurant is really special.

1102
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:05,700
The restaurant, which is kind of like as you exit the ride,

1103
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:07,540
you can kind of even just peek in then.

1104
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:08,100
And we sat there.

1105
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:09,860
You get a view of it when the ride land.

1106
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:10,740
We're going backwards.

1107
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:16,340
But when you land at the end of it there, there's kind of a window open to the restaurant.

1108
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:19,940
And the last scene of the ride proper is the restaurant.

1109
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:22,260
So that's a nice through line.

1110
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:22,740
Transition.

1111
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:23,620
You get to go into it.

1112
00:43:23,620 --> 00:43:24,340
How was that?

1113
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:27,860
I got to do it in Paris and I haven't done it in Epcot,

1114
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:31,300
but I didn't do the restaurant, which I wonder if I should have.

1115
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:32,420
What's your review?

1116
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:34,020
I was really happy with the restaurant.

1117
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:34,340
Really?

1118
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:35,220
Very, very happy.

1119
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:35,620
Yeah.

1120
00:43:35,620 --> 00:43:37,540
It was like everything's oversized.

1121
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:38,740
It's like you've been shrunk down.

1122
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:40,580
Food was really good.

1123
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:45,140
You can get your little ratatouille stew kind of thing that they have there.

1124
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:49,940
Can you get the magical little ball of ratatouille?

1125
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:54,980
It's closer to, speaking of Anton Ego,

1126
00:43:55,060 --> 00:44:01,220
it's closer to his childhood version than to the Remy prepared version is my memory of it.

1127
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:06,260
Like it's a little more stewier than the version where they're all sliced so nice.

1128
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:13,380
I mean, that's a magical, it's so hard to make that it is the crux of the film about

1129
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:14,500
cooking.

1130
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:19,060
So that's probably bad to crank 2,000 of those out a day.

1131
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:21,540
They probably tried and they were like, this is not feasible.

1132
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:22,040
Yes.

1133
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:24,660
I think that's right.

1134
00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:27,220
This does not cook in that form.

1135
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:28,580
Yeah, right.

1136
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:29,060
Right, right.

1137
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:29,780
Yeah, sure.

1138
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:30,260
Yeah, yeah.

1139
00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:31,540
It is not bone.

1140
00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:33,460
It is mouth.

1141
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:33,780
It is.

1142
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:35,060
It is not bone.

1143
00:44:35,060 --> 00:44:35,940
Yeah, yeah.

1144
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:37,540
No, no, it's very bone.

1145
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:40,340
So this was a question I had.

1146
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:45,700
It was like, will anyone attempt to say the name of the version in Paris?

1147
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:47,060
I didn't even write it down.

1148
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:49,460
That's how much I'm not going to attempt.

1149
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:50,100
No clue.

1150
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:50,820
I know it.

1151
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:57,380
I just wrote down the English translation, which is it's very like the fancy French,

1152
00:44:57,380 --> 00:44:57,880
too.

1153
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:03,140
And then they're actually the English one, Remy's Totally Zany Adventure.

1154
00:45:05,860 --> 00:45:07,700
What's the French word for Zany?

1155
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:09,060
What do the French call Zany?

1156
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:09,560
Remy.

1157
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:19,460
Zan-dyo.

1158
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:21,460
Do they have the notion of zaniness in Paris?

1159
00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:23,460
Yeah, Jerry Lewis.

1160
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:24,820
Oh, he's a god.

1161
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:25,380
That's why.

1162
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:26,900
Comedian de l'artè.

1163
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:27,380
I love that.

1164
00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:34,180
Remy and Jerry Lewis are kind of on equal footing in France.

1165
00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:35,780
They put his name in the title of the ride.

1166
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:36,740
That's how important he is there.

1167
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:40,100
But OK, so you did it in Paris.

1168
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:44,100
I also have to, I always got to ask, because not a lot of guests on the show have made

1169
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:45,060
it to Paris.

1170
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:49,140
Overall Paris experience, because I have complained about mine.

1171
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:49,540
OK.

1172
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:51,140
Listeners have heard this before.

1173
00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:54,340
I'm curious if like, did they work out those kinks?

1174
00:45:54,340 --> 00:45:56,420
Was 2014 a weird time?

1175
00:45:57,060 --> 00:46:03,140
Yeah, mine will be slightly different than yours, because my first time ever was New

1176
00:46:03,140 --> 00:46:04,660
Year's 2009.

1177
00:46:04,740 --> 00:46:06,500
Our baby moon was to Paris.

1178
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:10,340
And again, I've divorced my poor pregnant wife to go to Disneyland Paris.

1179
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:11,860
And it was freezing.

1180
00:46:11,860 --> 00:46:13,620
But I was so excited to be there.

1181
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:14,660
But it was freezing.

1182
00:46:15,620 --> 00:46:18,180
Mine was honeymoon in December.

1183
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:19,460
And that, I think, was the key.

1184
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:22,420
That is just bitter.

1185
00:46:22,420 --> 00:46:23,060
It's so cold.

1186
00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:23,700
It's like being in ice.

1187
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:30,660
Yeah, you kind of forget that a big city like that is so much higher up on the latitude

1188
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:31,940
than you'd imagine.

1189
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:37,220
Paris, you always kind of picture, I picture at least, like the Seine at night, twinkling.

1190
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:39,220
Sure, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1191
00:46:39,220 --> 00:46:43,460
You don't feel it as much as in the converted field, essentially.

1192
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:48,500
I just remember being in a corner of frontier land, where then it's not developed past that,

1193
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:49,860
where it is just still a field.

1194
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:52,900
And like, why is our honeymoon in a field?

1195
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:55,060
I know we love Disney, but this feels crazy.

1196
00:46:55,220 --> 00:47:02,020
Yeah, yeah, no, well, like that first trip, I did enjoy the design.

1197
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:08,900
And the consistent positive takeaway from my first and second trip was that the layout

1198
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:13,780
of that, that you can see Sleeping Beauty's castle from anywhere in the park and the flatness

1199
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:17,060
of it compared to anything else, I really, really, really loved.

1200
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:18,900
Sure, that castle's incredible.

1201
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:19,460
It's so beautiful.

1202
00:47:19,460 --> 00:47:20,900
It's all incredible to look at.

1203
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:22,180
The design.

1204
00:47:22,180 --> 00:47:25,860
And like Main Street's like a little heightened, a little rounder, a little brighter.

1205
00:47:26,340 --> 00:47:28,100
Yeah, good Main Street for sure.

1206
00:47:28,100 --> 00:47:30,820
Yes, but we barely lasted half a day.

1207
00:47:30,820 --> 00:47:35,860
We didn't even go into Hollywood Studios or Walt Disney Studios because I remember

1208
00:47:35,860 --> 00:47:43,220
doing Space Mountain and I do like the sort of steampunk element of Tomorrowland in Paris.

1209
00:47:43,220 --> 00:47:45,220
I love every one of those buildings.

1210
00:47:45,220 --> 00:47:49,300
And that you launch from outside into Space Mountain.

1211
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:50,740
Was I too afraid to do that?

1212
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:50,980
Yes.

1213
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:51,140
You were, okay.

1214
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:52,740
Did I wait while my wife did it?

1215
00:47:52,740 --> 00:47:56,580
Yes, but I liked watching her waving from the cannon.

1216
00:47:56,580 --> 00:47:59,060
We had the inverse experience.

1217
00:47:59,060 --> 00:48:02,900
I got off the ride after doing it by myself to my pregnant wife, like shivering.

1218
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:04,740
Let's go.

1219
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:06,420
This is wrong.

1220
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:07,300
Silly way to be.

1221
00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:12,740
So when I did Ratatouille was the summer of 2018, much more pleasant experience.

1222
00:48:13,620 --> 00:48:15,540
I love Disneyland Paris.

1223
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:17,300
After that experience, I love it.

1224
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:20,100
It's the best Big Thunder Mountain.

1225
00:48:20,660 --> 00:48:20,900
Right.

1226
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:21,860
Hands down.

1227
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:22,420
Yeah.

1228
00:48:22,420 --> 00:48:25,540
I didn't get to, I got the, which was cool in its own right.

1229
00:48:25,540 --> 00:48:28,420
I got the walk off, the best walk off I've ever gotten.

1230
00:48:28,420 --> 00:48:29,620
You went through the tunnel?

1231
00:48:29,620 --> 00:48:33,060
Yeah, through at the deepest possible point it could be.

1232
00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:35,380
So I'm in on the third lift hill.

1233
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:37,140
So there was so much walking.

1234
00:48:37,140 --> 00:48:41,140
It was the longest walk through all of through I'm inside the mountains.

1235
00:48:41,140 --> 00:48:44,020
It was crazy, but it's also, so that's cool.

1236
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:47,380
But I've also heard that the finale is the whole thing about it.

1237
00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:49,540
And that's what Tony Baxter designed it to that.

1238
00:48:49,940 --> 00:48:51,780
The other Big Thunder's kind of just end.

1239
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:52,580
They're okay.

1240
00:48:52,580 --> 00:48:54,660
And then this actually, because what is it?

1241
00:48:54,660 --> 00:48:56,580
You're just like, you're right along the water.

1242
00:48:56,580 --> 00:48:57,940
It's like really whipping you around.

1243
00:48:57,940 --> 00:49:01,620
So for, yeah, for Disneyland Paris is Big Thunder Mountain.

1244
00:49:01,620 --> 00:49:04,820
You enter like at the edge of Tom Sawyer's Island.

1245
00:49:04,820 --> 00:49:09,700
So kind of where it is in Disneyland, but as it takes off, you immediately dip

1246
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:13,380
into this dark tunnel filled with bats that takes you under the water.

1247
00:49:14,020 --> 00:49:17,300
So the mountain itself is like Tom Sawyer's Island.

1248
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:19,700
In the center of the water and it's amazing.

1249
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:22,740
And yeah, it doesn't have that tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick of Disneyland

1250
00:49:22,740 --> 00:49:25,620
where you just kind of go and do the little hump and then turn the right.

1251
00:49:26,580 --> 00:49:27,060
Yes.

1252
00:49:27,060 --> 00:49:28,100
No, there's a big finale.

1253
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:29,860
And then you come back through the tunnel.

1254
00:49:29,860 --> 00:49:31,940
Like you go down, boom, back through the tunnel.

1255
00:49:31,940 --> 00:49:32,660
And now you're back.

1256
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:37,540
It's so well designed and Phantom Manor was amazing.

1257
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:37,860
Yeah.

1258
00:49:37,860 --> 00:49:38,100
Yeah.

1259
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:38,900
That's beautiful.

1260
00:49:39,620 --> 00:49:42,580
Again, I like that you can see the castle from anywhere in the park.

1261
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:44,340
I love the steampunk Tomorrowland.

1262
00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:50,100
I love that in Disneyland Paris, and I can't wait to go to the parks in Asia

1263
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:54,820
because I'm sure there's a similar thing, but the Alice in Wonderland labyrinth.

1264
00:49:54,820 --> 00:49:55,460
Oh yeah.

1265
00:49:55,460 --> 00:49:56,900
Which is not a ride.

1266
00:49:56,900 --> 00:49:57,300
Right.

1267
00:49:57,300 --> 00:49:57,780
Yeah.

1268
00:49:57,780 --> 00:50:01,620
They have found a way to make a line so fun.

1269
00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:05,460
Like that was our daughter's favorite thing was just to run around this like

1270
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:08,580
hedge maze labyrinth of Alice in Wonderland stuff.

1271
00:50:09,620 --> 00:50:11,860
And it's so well designed and it's brilliant.

1272
00:50:12,820 --> 00:50:16,900
But you're just standing in a line pretty much going from vignette to vignette.

1273
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:19,140
So smart.

1274
00:50:19,140 --> 00:50:22,340
And then we did Walt Disney Studios.

1275
00:50:22,340 --> 00:50:23,140
Rattatouille is fun.

1276
00:50:23,140 --> 00:50:24,500
My favorite was the Crush Coaster.

1277
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:29,620
That was such an oppressive line and we only had half a day and I regret it.

1278
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:30,340
Carly Wiseau.

1279
00:50:30,340 --> 00:50:31,380
You've talked to Carly Wiseau.

1280
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:32,580
She has that one up.

1281
00:50:33,620 --> 00:50:34,180
That's a regret.

1282
00:50:34,180 --> 00:50:34,980
I should have done it.

1283
00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:36,660
It is a really great ride.

1284
00:50:36,660 --> 00:50:36,980
Yeah.

1285
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:38,260
It's really, really awesome.

1286
00:50:38,260 --> 00:50:38,740
Crap.

1287
00:50:38,740 --> 00:50:40,740
Well, I really blew it.

1288
00:50:40,820 --> 00:50:42,100
You really fucked it up.

1289
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:42,820
I did.

1290
00:50:42,820 --> 00:50:43,700
I know.

1291
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:44,900
Wrong time of year.

1292
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:45,460
Missed a bunch of stuff.

1293
00:50:45,460 --> 00:50:46,660
So many problems with it.

1294
00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:47,160
Yeah.

1295
00:50:47,700 --> 00:50:48,260
One year maybe.

1296
00:50:48,260 --> 00:50:49,140
Bad attitude.

1297
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:51,620
Maybe you were the problem.

1298
00:50:51,620 --> 00:50:53,860
I also keep saying it was the end of the honeymoon.

1299
00:50:53,860 --> 00:50:55,300
Maybe you end with Paris.

1300
00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:57,940
Maybe you end with like the beauty of the city.

1301
00:50:57,940 --> 00:51:01,220
Not like staying at a Radisson and getting on a shaky shuttle.

1302
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:04,580
That's the last nice thing.

1303
00:51:04,580 --> 00:51:05,060
Not last.

1304
00:51:05,060 --> 00:51:09,940
I mean, I could say many, but my biggest positive takeaway from my second trip

1305
00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:13,380
was we stayed in the Disneyland Hotel, which is their front gate.

1306
00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:14,100
Oh, yeah.

1307
00:51:14,100 --> 00:51:15,460
It's so genius.

1308
00:51:15,460 --> 00:51:16,260
Yeah.

1309
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:17,620
That seems like a pretty epic location.

1310
00:51:17,620 --> 00:51:20,820
You get out of the elevator and you walk 50 feet and you're in the park.

1311
00:51:20,820 --> 00:51:22,340
It's so smart.

1312
00:51:22,340 --> 00:51:22,500
Awesome.

1313
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:23,540
Did you do a view?

1314
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:24,980
Were you facing out to the park?

1315
00:51:25,620 --> 00:51:28,180
No, we were back towards the train station, I think.

1316
00:51:28,180 --> 00:51:29,940
So you saw the planet Hollywood.

1317
00:51:29,940 --> 00:51:30,340
Yeah, exactly.

1318
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:31,700
I would choose that view, actually.

1319
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:33,060
All right, Pete.

1320
00:51:33,060 --> 00:51:33,940
Dearly departed.

1321
00:51:33,940 --> 00:51:34,440
Yeah.

1322
00:51:35,140 --> 00:51:38,660
Well, this ride, I was thinking how it's in the genre,

1323
00:51:38,660 --> 00:51:45,700
the rare genre of park saver, where it's so good and clearly designed to be that way,

1324
00:51:45,700 --> 00:51:49,780
that a park opens, and by that I mean the Disney Studios Park,

1325
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:55,700
that's considered kind of weak for a while and we need to put in reinforcements.

1326
00:51:55,700 --> 00:52:00,100
Something really great and unprecedented in the parks has to go in.

1327
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:01,540
I guess you'd consider that.

1328
00:52:01,540 --> 00:52:06,180
Soren kept Government Adventure afloat, but then his Radiator Springs, I guess,

1329
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:08,900
the park saver or Tower of Terror.

1330
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:10,820
California Screamin', I think, was pretty fun, right?

1331
00:52:10,820 --> 00:52:11,620
Sure, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1332
00:52:11,620 --> 00:52:13,300
I think California Screamin' was decent.

1333
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:14,500
It wasn't as dire as...

1334
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:15,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1335
00:52:15,380 --> 00:52:20,980
It's closer maybe to Mystic Manor, which I've never done, but where that was, again,

1336
00:52:20,980 --> 00:52:25,220
kind of a cheaped out on park and then, okay, to make up for this,

1337
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:31,220
the first big addition has to be something so crazy, high tech, that you can't do anywhere else,

1338
00:52:31,220 --> 00:52:35,460
at least at that time, and that's, I think, what Rats at Zooey was.

1339
00:52:35,460 --> 00:52:39,300
Hong Kong, to me, is like, that is the one I want to get to more than,

1340
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:45,860
even though Tokyo Disney and DisneySea, they say, but Hong Kong was, the land was built.

1341
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:47,060
Oh, yeah.

1342
00:52:47,060 --> 00:52:47,940
It was in the bay.

1343
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:51,380
They showed them a bay of water and they're like,

1344
00:52:51,380 --> 00:52:55,140
we'll build you an island, basically, to bring Disneyland.

1345
00:52:55,140 --> 00:52:57,300
Yeah, it's like one of those man-made islands in Dubai.

1346
00:52:57,300 --> 00:52:57,940
Yes.

1347
00:52:57,940 --> 00:52:58,440
Yeah, yeah.

1348
00:52:58,500 --> 00:52:59,000
Yeah.

1349
00:52:59,860 --> 00:53:02,740
Island-making technology that I'm not familiar with.

1350
00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:03,240
Same.

1351
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:05,380
I don't know how it works, but yeah, that's crazy.

1352
00:53:05,860 --> 00:53:07,460
If you are, you can make a buck.

1353
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:07,960
That's true.

1354
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:09,460
If you get into the island-making racket.

1355
00:53:09,460 --> 00:53:10,100
I'll look into it.

1356
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:11,700
I'm very profitable.

1357
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:12,260
Yeah, I'll look into it.

1358
00:53:12,260 --> 00:53:13,460
I'm not going to need a new gig.

1359
00:53:13,460 --> 00:53:14,980
It takes a while, but it's a lot of work.

1360
00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:18,100
But yeah, no, Ratatouille was really fun.

1361
00:53:18,100 --> 00:53:23,460
I would say my experience was slightly dulled just because I'd already done

1362
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:30,580
Transformers at Universal and it is very similar in its execution of the tech.

1363
00:53:30,580 --> 00:53:31,080
Yes.

1364
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:37,160
Almost the same shape car going from room to room and this movie screen,

1365
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:39,240
the digital projection kind of interaction.

1366
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:41,800
It's supposed to be seamless.

1367
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:43,800
Yeah, yeah, blending practical sets.

1368
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:44,300
Yeah.

1369
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:52,280
So I was like, okay, and I had a better experience in Florida than Paris.

1370
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:52,780
Sure, sure.

1371
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:56,760
You know, I felt similar.

1372
00:53:56,760 --> 00:54:00,680
This is a funny thing you've stepped into because Transformers is a big runner on the show.

1373
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:04,840
Mike has made the argument that Transformers is better than Rise of the Resistance.

1374
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:09,240
And some of it is now, and one of the only avenues where I can stand firm on that.

1375
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:12,360
We may have to derail the topic after I introduce that.

1376
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,640
If you have anything you want to say about that, we can get back on it.

1377
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:16,520
Too much fog.

1378
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:19,880
Too much fog on Transformers.

1379
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:20,920
Okay, that's a good note.

1380
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:21,720
There's a lot of fog.

1381
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:26,280
Too much fog and are we going there?

1382
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:27,160
We could if you want.

1383
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:28,040
Sure, yeah.

1384
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:30,120
It's not even a competition.

1385
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:36,600
It's not even because already you are existing in a fully immersive land, off world.

1386
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:41,160
The design of what you think is the initial line is beautiful.

1387
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:44,040
Then you get an interactive experience within the line where you see Rey,

1388
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:46,040
you see a tangible BB-8.

1389
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:53,000
Then you see a full scale Poe Dameron X-wing, black painted.

1390
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:58,520
Then you board a transport, you get star tours before anything is really started.

1391
00:54:58,520 --> 00:55:05,240
You get a Mon Calamari talking to you and Nine Nub piloting a star tours ride.

1392
00:55:05,240 --> 00:55:07,720
You're like, this is wholly satisfying in itself.

1393
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:09,000
You can stand right next to them.

1394
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,400
You can be creepily, you can really bother Lieutenant Beck.

1395
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:15,480
Do you know that Nine is a reflection when you're seeing him?

1396
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:16,200
He's below.

1397
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:17,500
No.

1398
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:19,000
No, I didn't know.

1399
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:19,560
Really?

1400
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:20,520
Isn't that insane?

1401
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:22,360
I was told to be most recently.

1402
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:25,800
That those way the space because you're on that, the lazy Susan,

1403
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:27,560
they needed to consolidate space.

1404
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:33,000
So he is actually a reflection that's happening underneath the Mon Calamari.

1405
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:33,640
Really?

1406
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:34,600
But isn't there a head?

1407
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:36,360
Isn't there a tangible head?

1408
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:36,600
Yes.

1409
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:41,560
There, but then it's under it is, but you're seeing the reflection of it underneath.

1410
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:43,240
Oh my God.

1411
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:43,480
Wow.

1412
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:45,560
I gotta take a look at this guy again.

1413
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:46,040
I know.

1414
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:47,400
Maybe I have to rethink the whole thing.

1415
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:48,520
It's it's hard.

1416
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:52,280
And by the way, you're still in the line.

1417
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:52,840
Yes.

1418
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:54,280
Still the line.

1419
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:58,360
I think that's actually my favorite part is the Lieutenant Beck part of the whole thing.

1420
00:55:58,360 --> 00:55:58,840
Yeah.

1421
00:55:58,840 --> 00:55:59,240
Yeah.

1422
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:02,760
Because that feels like so much like I can walk up to him and he's there.

1423
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:03,480
That feels.

1424
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:03,880
Yeah.

1425
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:06,200
That feels the warmth that I'm looking for.

1426
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:12,280
I mean, that area for me, the reveal of the hanger, nothing will beat that.

1427
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:17,720
I would never storm troopers and you're looking out into space and it's the actual side,

1428
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:22,120
you know, like that reveal and it's the same door you entered in.

1429
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:24,520
Like that is amazing.

1430
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:30,200
Isn't this funny, by the way, just for Inside Baseball, that just several days ago,

1431
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:35,480
we were with Tom Sharpling on the best show and he was doing the exact inverse of what you were saying.

1432
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:36,360
He did not like it.

1433
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:36,680
Yeah.

1434
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:37,240
Interesting.

1435
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:40,840
Then you get in this box, you gotta see this box and it shakes around.

1436
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:41,960
And he goes, and you realize you're.

1437
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:42,760
Is this the ride?

1438
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:43,400
He goes, yeah.

1439
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:46,120
And you just realize this is all a line.

1440
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:47,720
This is all just still a line.

1441
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:48,760
I'm still in the line.

1442
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:54,520
Then the door opens, the most tired person you ever see and says, hey, you're a prisoner now.

1443
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:55,800
I like seeing two sides of the.

1444
00:56:56,520 --> 00:56:56,760
Yeah.

1445
00:56:56,760 --> 00:56:58,840
The beauty of the spectrum of the fandom.

1446
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:03,960
Well, he also had a rough, the first time it broke down, second time he had to buy the lightning

1447
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:06,680
lane, you know, so that adds a little more friction.

1448
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:08,680
Emotional connection to some of this.

1449
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:09,180
Yeah.

1450
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:12,200
I sense that you're a bigger Star Wars fan than Tom Sharpling.

1451
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:13,880
It's a guess, but we don't, we're thinking.

1452
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:14,600
We're willing to debate it.

1453
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:15,100
But.

1454
00:57:15,100 --> 00:57:15,800
Oh, that'd be good.

1455
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:16,300
Yeah.

1456
00:57:17,020 --> 00:57:19,020
That like, yeah, for me it is.

1457
00:57:19,020 --> 00:57:20,220
We're still in the line.

1458
00:57:20,220 --> 00:57:20,540
Yes.

1459
00:57:20,540 --> 00:57:21,100
Yeah, I know.

1460
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:21,500
Of course.

1461
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:22,220
We can bet.

1462
00:57:22,220 --> 00:57:22,860
It's a trick.

1463
00:57:22,860 --> 00:57:23,900
That's a good thing.

1464
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:25,180
And there's a line.

1465
00:57:25,180 --> 00:57:26,220
There's a ride in the line.

1466
00:57:26,220 --> 00:57:27,260
Has it never happened before?

1467
00:57:27,260 --> 00:57:28,540
You want more line, please.

1468
00:57:29,020 --> 00:57:34,540
The performative like, like other than I was trying to think about it in the Hollywood ride

1469
00:57:34,540 --> 00:57:40,460
was the only other ride where mid line ride experience, there's a human performative

1470
00:57:41,020 --> 00:57:45,020
element of it that, you know, you are now under the.

1471
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:48,860
You know, the protection of the first order come this way.

1472
00:57:48,860 --> 00:57:52,220
And then we, I had the first time I ever went on rise.

1473
00:57:52,220 --> 00:57:57,820
I had the best resistance person come through the jail cell.

1474
00:57:58,860 --> 00:58:00,460
I had the best performer.

1475
00:58:00,460 --> 00:58:01,260
I had the best.

1476
00:58:01,260 --> 00:58:02,300
It was so fun.

1477
00:58:02,300 --> 00:58:05,260
And so, and it was still a little like, are we jungle cruise?

1478
00:58:05,260 --> 00:58:06,300
Are we messing with you?

1479
00:58:06,300 --> 00:58:06,800
Are we?

1480
00:58:07,420 --> 00:58:10,860
Because you go in those hallways and those hallways are so beautiful because you're like,

1481
00:58:10,860 --> 00:58:12,540
this is new hope.

1482
00:58:12,540 --> 00:58:13,260
Star Wars.

1483
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:14,540
Like these hallways.

1484
00:58:14,540 --> 00:58:18,220
This is Princess Leia jail breakout, Star Wars hallways.

1485
00:58:18,780 --> 00:58:23,500
Then you're in the jail cell and then the surprise like I'm getting, I've been given two

1486
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:25,500
huge surprises already.

1487
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:27,500
And the real ride hasn't even begun.

1488
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:30,220
When you didn't know what was coming, when you didn't know how you were going to get out

1489
00:58:30,220 --> 00:58:31,580
of that were the first time.

1490
00:58:31,580 --> 00:58:36,620
And where that I maybe we'll agree with Tom that some of the energy has lagged a little.

1491
00:58:36,620 --> 00:58:42,220
We were the first day there and that's when everybody's putting the mustard on the performance.

1492
00:58:42,700 --> 00:58:43,980
Let me shout it out.

1493
00:58:43,980 --> 00:58:46,460
This is the moment they've been waiting for for months.

1494
00:58:46,460 --> 00:58:49,980
I had a guy come in who just like, we're here to rescue you.

1495
00:58:50,940 --> 00:58:52,220
Come to it.

1496
00:58:52,220 --> 00:58:53,020
Move your butts.

1497
00:58:53,660 --> 00:58:55,660
If anybody asks, it's just a prisoner transfer.

1498
00:58:55,660 --> 00:58:56,860
Let me see your innocent face.

1499
00:58:57,900 --> 00:58:58,540
Good luck.

1500
00:58:59,180 --> 00:59:01,100
I was like, this is perfect.

1501
00:59:01,100 --> 00:59:04,460
They've been running this in the mirror every night for so long.

1502
00:59:05,100 --> 00:59:05,820
And it's joyful.

1503
00:59:05,820 --> 00:59:08,780
And then the ride begins and I still to this end.

1504
00:59:08,780 --> 00:59:13,260
So I was on it as I'm sure you were when all cannons were firing.

1505
00:59:13,260 --> 00:59:14,220
Oh, I know.

1506
00:59:14,220 --> 00:59:15,100
That's my favorite.

1507
00:59:15,100 --> 00:59:16,060
And it's not working.

1508
00:59:16,860 --> 00:59:17,660
Has it not been working?

1509
00:59:17,660 --> 00:59:18,380
Yeah, that's what I heard.

1510
00:59:18,380 --> 00:59:18,940
I haven't been in a while.

1511
00:59:18,940 --> 00:59:22,620
They limited it to two because they found that that was what was eating up a lot of power.

1512
00:59:22,620 --> 00:59:24,700
That's what was shutting it down a lot.

1513
00:59:24,700 --> 00:59:29,660
Or the mechanisms that are bigger than the ride vehicles constantly miss.

1514
00:59:29,660 --> 00:59:33,900
The Yeti in Expedition Everest ripping the foundation out.

1515
00:59:33,900 --> 00:59:36,380
That makes me sad because that's my favorite room in the whole thing.

1516
00:59:36,620 --> 00:59:39,500
It's the first time you hear the theme to the Star Wars.

1517
00:59:40,620 --> 00:59:43,100
And you're looking at the screens and those digital screens.

1518
00:59:43,100 --> 00:59:43,900
Yeah, they're amazing.

1519
00:59:44,460 --> 00:59:47,020
I'm looking out into space and they're playing Star Wars.

1520
00:59:47,020 --> 00:59:49,020
I get emotional every time in that hallway.

1521
00:59:50,220 --> 00:59:51,820
The most ho hum part.

1522
00:59:51,820 --> 00:59:52,700
There's no animatronics.

1523
00:59:52,700 --> 00:59:55,420
There's no, you know, but it is you just you feel it.

1524
00:59:55,420 --> 00:59:58,300
Yeah, I love and then, you know, the drop.

1525
00:59:59,180 --> 01:00:00,380
Yeah, they draw it's really good.

1526
01:00:00,380 --> 01:00:01,100
So good.

1527
01:00:01,100 --> 01:00:03,580
Now all that said, is there anything you want to say about Transformers?

1528
01:00:03,580 --> 01:00:04,620
Well, again, I don't want to.

1529
01:00:05,260 --> 01:00:06,140
I don't want to derail.

1530
01:00:06,140 --> 01:00:07,020
We did the whole episode.

1531
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:07,820
We did a whole episode.

1532
01:00:08,540 --> 01:00:09,420
All I'll say is that.

1533
01:00:09,420 --> 01:00:09,980
The power point.

1534
01:00:09,980 --> 01:00:11,500
There was a literal power point.

1535
01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:14,220
That now that it feels like it's going to be the ultimate Star Wars ride,

1536
01:00:14,220 --> 01:00:17,500
there's almost things I'm missing in it in a way of like,

1537
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:20,540
I don't think we're getting another e-ticket Star Wars ride ever.

1538
01:00:20,540 --> 01:00:21,100
Maybe not.

1539
01:00:21,100 --> 01:00:22,940
We might not get another e-ticket ride ever.

1540
01:00:22,940 --> 01:00:24,380
We may never ever ride again.

1541
01:00:27,020 --> 01:00:29,500
Then they're like 60 billion they're investing in.

1542
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:31,580
They're claiming this number.

1543
01:00:31,580 --> 01:00:32,860
We hope this is true.

1544
01:00:32,860 --> 01:00:33,420
We'll see.

1545
01:00:33,420 --> 01:00:34,460
It's too vague for our.

1546
01:00:34,460 --> 01:00:35,820
So we need a little more info.

1547
01:00:35,820 --> 01:00:36,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1548
01:00:36,700 --> 01:00:37,580
I just don't want to get.

1549
01:00:37,580 --> 01:00:39,100
I don't want to pull the football away from me.

1550
01:00:39,980 --> 01:00:43,260
And to be fair, I feel like maybe there's a timeline issue,

1551
01:00:43,260 --> 01:00:44,700
which I could come to your side.

1552
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:46,620
Well, timeline is definitely part of it.

1553
01:00:46,620 --> 01:00:47,900
But it's also.

1554
01:00:47,900 --> 01:00:48,220
Yeah.

1555
01:00:48,220 --> 01:00:48,940
How did you guys put it?

1556
01:00:48,940 --> 01:00:49,980
Like your friends?

1557
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:50,700
Like there's none of your friends.

1558
01:00:50,700 --> 01:00:53,020
I certainly want my friends there.

1559
01:00:53,020 --> 01:00:53,740
Not these new.

1560
01:00:53,740 --> 01:00:55,100
I like the new people fine.

1561
01:00:55,100 --> 01:00:56,220
I'm not mad at the new people.

1562
01:00:56,220 --> 01:00:57,660
Saved by the new class though.

1563
01:00:57,660 --> 01:00:58,780
We're my friends.

1564
01:00:58,780 --> 01:00:59,420
Yes.

1565
01:00:59,420 --> 01:00:59,660
Yeah.

1566
01:00:59,660 --> 01:01:01,740
They just give me a little of my friends in there.

1567
01:01:01,740 --> 01:01:02,940
I'm with you on that.

1568
01:01:03,340 --> 01:01:04,380
At least you have Chewy.

1569
01:01:04,380 --> 01:01:07,340
Chewy takes the place of building as in all the shows.

1570
01:01:07,340 --> 01:01:07,820
Yeah.

1571
01:01:07,820 --> 01:01:09,580
Chewy is the building of Star Wars.

1572
01:01:09,580 --> 01:01:11,420
And R2D2 is Screech.

1573
01:01:11,420 --> 01:01:12,380
Yeah, yeah.

1574
01:01:12,380 --> 01:01:12,860
Chewy.

1575
01:01:12,860 --> 01:01:14,860
Oh.

1576
01:01:14,860 --> 01:01:15,820
So you got some of your friends.

1577
01:01:15,820 --> 01:01:18,620
Chewy had those rough few years where he was at that karaoke bar

1578
01:01:18,620 --> 01:01:21,260
and fur bank every night when the whole food is now.

1579
01:01:21,260 --> 01:01:23,340
He can't stand up for a time.

1580
01:01:23,340 --> 01:01:24,380
Oh, well, of course.

1581
01:01:24,380 --> 01:01:24,860
Yeah.

1582
01:01:24,860 --> 01:01:27,900
But he does good cameos, quick turnaround.

1583
01:01:27,900 --> 01:01:28,380
Yeah.

1584
01:01:28,380 --> 01:01:28,940
He's always nice.

1585
01:01:28,940 --> 01:01:29,580
He's always nice.

1586
01:01:29,580 --> 01:01:30,620
He's a character actor.

1587
01:01:30,620 --> 01:01:31,100
He's so nice.

1588
01:01:31,100 --> 01:01:32,300
He's so nice.

1589
01:01:32,300 --> 01:01:33,260
Now he's in the building.

1590
01:01:36,140 --> 01:01:39,100
The thing I was going to say to this argument,

1591
01:01:39,100 --> 01:01:42,940
one point where I could relate to your mostly impenetrable argument

1592
01:01:42,940 --> 01:01:45,580
was that I felt a little dead.

1593
01:01:45,580 --> 01:01:46,140
Sorry.

1594
01:01:46,140 --> 01:01:47,500
Impenetrably good argument.

1595
01:01:47,500 --> 01:01:48,060
That's what I meant.

1596
01:01:48,060 --> 01:01:48,540
Yeah, yeah.

1597
01:01:48,540 --> 01:01:49,420
So well presented.

1598
01:01:49,980 --> 01:01:54,540
But I felt this was probably the first trackless ride I went on

1599
01:01:54,540 --> 01:01:55,420
was Red Zatui.

1600
01:01:55,420 --> 01:02:00,300
And I could feel that I do like that a Transformers or a Spider-Man

1601
01:02:00,940 --> 01:02:08,300
has that whip that it can really spin you, whip you, just tight, precise moves.

1602
01:02:08,300 --> 01:02:12,220
And I think maybe a common thing about Rise of the Resistance and Red Zatui

1603
01:02:12,220 --> 01:02:14,620
that I think the trackless is really cool.

1604
01:02:14,620 --> 01:02:15,580
I really like it.

1605
01:02:15,580 --> 01:02:18,540
And I like what it opens up in terms of you go different paths.

1606
01:02:18,540 --> 01:02:21,900
But there's something that can be a little puttering about it.

1607
01:02:21,900 --> 01:02:22,620
That's not the most thrilling.

1608
01:02:22,620 --> 01:02:25,900
A little sterile, a little too robotic in a way.

1609
01:02:25,900 --> 01:02:28,940
Because I want Transformers fucks you up.

1610
01:02:29,420 --> 01:02:30,940
It fucks your body up.

1611
01:02:31,660 --> 01:02:33,340
You're smacking the back of it.

1612
01:02:33,340 --> 01:02:34,940
You kind of leave a little sore.

1613
01:02:34,940 --> 01:02:38,220
But isn't that what you want from Transformers, like a Michael Bay movie?

1614
01:02:38,940 --> 01:02:41,500
So like you go on Rise of the Resistance or Red Zatui.

1615
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:43,340
And I haven't actually gotten to do Red Zatui yet.

1616
01:02:43,980 --> 01:02:46,060
And not that I think Red Zatui should fuck you up.

1617
01:02:48,060 --> 01:02:51,020
Just getting slammed into those pantry shelves.

1618
01:02:51,740 --> 01:02:53,180
The fire should burn you.

1619
01:02:53,180 --> 01:02:56,060
You're under Linguini's hair.

1620
01:02:56,060 --> 01:02:56,460
Whatever.

1621
01:02:56,460 --> 01:02:58,540
Oh, you want to feel there should be mice pulling your hair.

1622
01:02:58,540 --> 01:03:00,380
Yeah, there should be mice pulling your hair on the ride.

1623
01:03:00,380 --> 01:03:02,620
Where you should pull his hair.

1624
01:03:02,620 --> 01:03:03,100
It was honey.

1625
01:03:03,100 --> 01:03:03,900
Yes, exactly.

1626
01:03:03,900 --> 01:03:07,900
There's like hair as you go by and you can pull on it to go right away.

1627
01:03:08,860 --> 01:03:13,260
That's how you control the ride vehicle.

1628
01:03:13,260 --> 01:03:16,060
It's like he looks under a counter and his hat falls off.

1629
01:03:16,060 --> 01:03:17,180
And the hair is down there.

1630
01:03:17,180 --> 01:03:19,820
And then you on the ride can pull which direction you go.

1631
01:03:19,820 --> 01:03:20,380
Jeez.

1632
01:03:20,380 --> 01:03:21,420
That would be awesome, actually.

1633
01:03:23,020 --> 01:03:23,740
But yeah, I agree.

1634
01:03:23,740 --> 01:03:25,980
The track list for Mickey and Minnie's Runway Railway.

1635
01:03:25,980 --> 01:03:26,620
Perfect.

1636
01:03:26,620 --> 01:03:30,780
For Pooh's Honey Hot, which is in Japan, which we got to do a couple of times.

1637
01:03:30,780 --> 01:03:32,140
It's amazing and it's perfect.

1638
01:03:32,140 --> 01:03:33,900
The perfect property for that type of thing.

1639
01:03:33,900 --> 01:03:37,820
But yeah, for Star Wars, when they're shooting the blasters, I want the thing tip and all.

1640
01:03:37,820 --> 01:03:43,340
I want it to be Indiana Jones where my brain is a little concussed from the motion at the end.

1641
01:03:43,340 --> 01:03:47,260
Because when you're playing with figures as a kid, you're like, argh.

1642
01:03:47,260 --> 01:03:47,980
You want that shake.

1643
01:03:49,340 --> 01:03:50,860
Something needs to shake you.

1644
01:03:50,860 --> 01:03:55,420
You definitely define the line that we are on other sides of.

1645
01:03:55,420 --> 01:03:57,740
Because I will avoid Indiana Jones at all costs.

1646
01:03:57,740 --> 01:03:58,140
There you go.

1647
01:03:58,140 --> 01:03:58,620
Oh really?

1648
01:03:58,620 --> 01:03:59,100
How interesting.

1649
01:03:59,100 --> 01:04:00,300
It's a little bit.

1650
01:04:00,300 --> 01:04:02,620
And then the snake doesn't need to be that loud.

1651
01:04:02,620 --> 01:04:03,820
And I'm just like.

1652
01:04:03,820 --> 01:04:07,180
I kind of recoil from the snake every time.

1653
01:04:07,180 --> 01:04:09,500
It broke down next to the snake once.

1654
01:04:09,500 --> 01:04:10,540
Yeah, so it kept doing.

1655
01:04:10,540 --> 01:04:11,180
It kept doing it.

1656
01:04:11,180 --> 01:04:12,380
Oh, it didn't stop.

1657
01:04:12,380 --> 01:04:13,340
No.

1658
01:04:13,340 --> 01:04:14,300
Oh, I hate this.

1659
01:04:14,940 --> 01:04:16,860
For like 15, 10, 15 minutes.

1660
01:04:16,860 --> 01:04:21,500
And then I think we rode through with all the sound effects playing, but all the work lights.

1661
01:04:22,140 --> 01:04:24,620
Yeah, which is great because we were, of course, begging for a walk-off.

1662
01:04:24,620 --> 01:04:25,500
We wanted that.

1663
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:26,060
We wanted that.

1664
01:04:26,060 --> 01:04:28,460
Just praying to the god we never talked to.

1665
01:04:31,340 --> 01:04:33,100
I know you don't hear from us a lot, but.

1666
01:04:33,100 --> 01:04:33,980
I was waiting for this.

1667
01:04:33,980 --> 01:04:35,180
We've got a theme park thing.

1668
01:04:35,180 --> 01:04:35,980
This is important, sir.

1669
01:04:35,980 --> 01:04:36,700
We've got a favor.

1670
01:04:38,620 --> 01:04:43,340
Someone told us, talking about the Star Wars cannons, it's come up a couple times.

1671
01:04:44,300 --> 01:04:48,220
Someone said when they were building that and they were testing those,

1672
01:04:48,220 --> 01:04:51,260
there was one of them that was not properly aligned.

1673
01:04:51,260 --> 01:04:57,660
And they move with such force, it hit the wall and it shook the foundation of the building.

1674
01:04:59,020 --> 01:05:05,580
So if you want some increased tension, just go like, oh, this thing's going to mess us up.

1675
01:05:05,580 --> 01:05:06,540
If it hits us.

1676
01:05:06,540 --> 01:05:10,940
Yeah, well, I mean, maybe that's part of what you're missing too is there was some back and forth.

1677
01:05:10,940 --> 01:05:11,580
Yeah, yeah.

1678
01:05:11,580 --> 01:05:12,620
Yes, it was jerky.

1679
01:05:12,620 --> 01:05:13,340
Yes, yes.

1680
01:05:13,340 --> 01:05:14,860
That is for sure.

1681
01:05:16,700 --> 01:05:19,100
And because it's so big, it's like the Stormtroopers, you're like,

1682
01:05:19,100 --> 01:05:20,700
I want to feel like I'm in danger.

1683
01:05:21,660 --> 01:05:22,780
But it's a little bit more.

1684
01:05:22,780 --> 01:05:26,300
You want to ride that that's partially destroying the city of Anaheim's power grid.

1685
01:05:26,300 --> 01:05:26,800
Yes.

1686
01:05:27,980 --> 01:05:30,860
Residents can't cook a meal tonight because...

1687
01:05:32,860 --> 01:05:38,540
If it's working properly, people are suffering in Anaheim as far as their electric consumption.

1688
01:05:38,540 --> 01:05:42,140
It's like the whole coast are causing all those brownouts back in 99.

1689
01:05:42,140 --> 01:05:44,060
Yes, that's what needs to happen.

1690
01:05:44,620 --> 01:05:47,580
So yeah, I like Ryzer's a lot.

1691
01:05:48,140 --> 01:05:51,900
But this was so much smoke on Transformers though.

1692
01:05:51,900 --> 01:05:52,860
There's so much smoke.

1693
01:05:52,860 --> 01:05:53,820
It's with the glasses.

1694
01:05:53,820 --> 01:05:55,180
Then you add to that.

1695
01:05:55,180 --> 01:05:57,260
You're wearing goggles and then it fogs.

1696
01:05:57,260 --> 01:05:57,760
Yeah.

1697
01:05:57,760 --> 01:05:58,460
Yeah, yeah.

1698
01:05:59,580 --> 01:06:01,820
But anyway, I was just saying that is an area where I could relate.

1699
01:06:01,820 --> 01:06:06,780
Where this is an attraction that is meant to be madcap and it has that feeling.

1700
01:06:06,780 --> 01:06:10,060
And I think the ride films part of it are fantastic.

1701
01:06:10,060 --> 01:06:14,860
But then I could feel that you would sort of like leave a part that does feel very

1702
01:06:14,860 --> 01:06:19,580
manic from the screen and then just slide into the pantry.

1703
01:06:19,580 --> 01:06:22,620
And now we drift over here and it's all good.

1704
01:06:22,620 --> 01:06:23,740
Everything's really well done.

1705
01:06:25,100 --> 01:06:27,740
I was sort of craving a more Transformers ride vehicle.

1706
01:06:28,780 --> 01:06:29,980
But in my mind, did you feel...

1707
01:06:30,700 --> 01:06:34,460
You were saying it was like a better experience somehow in Epcot for him.

1708
01:06:34,460 --> 01:06:41,820
Yeah, and I wonder because the last time I'd ridden it was five years previous in Paris,

1709
01:06:41,820 --> 01:06:47,180
I wonder if the screen technology caught up and what the actual design differences of the track

1710
01:06:47,180 --> 01:06:48,460
are, if any.

1711
01:06:48,460 --> 01:06:54,140
But some of those transitions and the oversized kind of prop pieces of the room that move in,

1712
01:06:55,180 --> 01:06:57,180
I enjoyed more this time.

1713
01:06:57,180 --> 01:06:57,740
Sure, sure.

1714
01:06:58,940 --> 01:06:59,420
Oh, good.

1715
01:06:59,420 --> 01:07:00,460
Oh, yeah.

1716
01:07:00,460 --> 01:07:03,340
I rode it like a month after it opened at Epcot.

1717
01:07:03,340 --> 01:07:06,380
And there's not a fancy restaurant.

1718
01:07:06,380 --> 01:07:09,420
There's just a casual creperie next to it.

1719
01:07:10,380 --> 01:07:17,340
And a crepe window, which I think my affection for this place is partially due to

1720
01:07:20,300 --> 01:07:27,740
post-COVID opening stuff where we're so happy to get down there and see this new land.

1721
01:07:27,740 --> 01:07:32,700
And we were at the crepe window when it opened at 10 a.m.

1722
01:07:32,700 --> 01:07:34,300
You hope dropped the crepe window.

1723
01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:34,700
Yes.

1724
01:07:34,700 --> 01:07:38,540
Well, because we had gotten trapped at the yacht because of Run Disney.

1725
01:07:38,620 --> 01:07:38,940
Oh, yeah.

1726
01:07:38,940 --> 01:07:39,900
I remember you complaining.

1727
01:07:39,900 --> 01:07:40,860
Oh, the famous marathon.

1728
01:07:40,860 --> 01:07:45,180
We got trapped there and Disney Springs wasn't open yet.

1729
01:07:45,180 --> 01:07:47,180
It's a 20-minute ordeal.

1730
01:07:47,180 --> 01:07:48,140
It was 20 minutes.

1731
01:07:48,140 --> 01:07:49,260
It was 20 minutes.

1732
01:07:49,980 --> 01:07:51,500
It was like a few hours.

1733
01:07:52,860 --> 01:07:58,380
Anyway, we got down there and so it was so nice to go in that area.

1734
01:07:58,380 --> 01:08:01,660
But it took a couple days to get on Ratatouille because we had like

1735
01:08:02,220 --> 01:08:05,100
two or three days reserved at Epcot the first day.

1736
01:08:05,100 --> 01:08:07,180
Just wasn't getting the virtual queues.

1737
01:08:07,180 --> 01:08:08,540
And then I finally got it.

1738
01:08:09,180 --> 01:08:11,020
And then, oh, thank God.

1739
01:08:11,020 --> 01:08:16,140
Like we got on, got in the queue and I was like so stressed about like trying to get

1740
01:08:16,140 --> 01:08:18,460
on, make sure my family got on this.

1741
01:08:18,460 --> 01:08:23,100
And then when you come around the corner and there's a big Gousseau sign

1742
01:08:23,100 --> 01:08:26,620
and it's playing the music for the movie, I'm like, OK, the vibes are very good.

1743
01:08:26,620 --> 01:08:27,660
I'm very relaxed.

1744
01:08:27,660 --> 01:08:28,940
Yeah, that's good.

1745
01:08:28,940 --> 01:08:29,340
Oh, sure.

1746
01:08:29,340 --> 01:08:30,700
Yeah, the music does.

1747
01:08:31,580 --> 01:08:37,180
I had totally forgotten there were 3D glasses until I was rewatching the ride through.

1748
01:08:37,180 --> 01:08:38,060
I didn't really remember.

1749
01:08:38,060 --> 01:08:40,060
I remember the track list.

1750
01:08:40,060 --> 01:08:46,060
Like this was one of the first, probably the second track list ride I had done.

1751
01:08:46,060 --> 01:08:47,260
Second or third, maybe.

1752
01:08:48,540 --> 01:08:50,860
And so maybe that was a little decreased.

1753
01:08:51,980 --> 01:08:52,860
The excitement.

1754
01:08:52,860 --> 01:08:57,500
Maybe if I had done this first of like, oh, a new ride system.

1755
01:08:57,500 --> 01:08:58,140
Cool.

1756
01:08:58,140 --> 01:09:00,060
If it's the first track list you've ever done.

1757
01:09:00,460 --> 01:09:01,260
Oh, for sure.

1758
01:09:01,260 --> 01:09:07,340
But yeah, I also had forgotten, you know, I always like this movie.

1759
01:09:08,300 --> 01:09:12,860
And of course, there's always a joke now of like a cartoon rat pulling on your hair

1760
01:09:12,860 --> 01:09:14,460
and make you do things.

1761
01:09:14,460 --> 01:09:15,260
But I forget.

1762
01:09:15,260 --> 01:09:15,980
Always.

1763
01:09:15,980 --> 01:09:16,480
The.

1764
01:09:17,580 --> 01:09:18,380
Yeah, always.

1765
01:09:18,380 --> 01:09:19,900
That's how I do good stuff.

1766
01:09:19,900 --> 01:09:20,540
Common thing now.

1767
01:09:20,540 --> 01:09:23,260
That's why I let my hair get a little higher sometimes.

1768
01:09:25,020 --> 01:09:26,300
So the rat can hop on.

1769
01:09:26,300 --> 01:09:31,420
The rat controls Linguini, but then a ghost chef tells the rat what to do,

1770
01:09:31,420 --> 01:09:34,140
which I forget is a big part of the movie.

1771
01:09:34,140 --> 01:09:34,780
Yes.

1772
01:09:34,780 --> 01:09:35,900
A lot of constructs.

1773
01:09:35,900 --> 01:09:36,700
Yes, true.

1774
01:09:36,700 --> 01:09:39,580
Yeah, a little chef and then a little another ghost little chef.

1775
01:09:39,580 --> 01:09:42,780
Also Linguini is the bastard son of the chef.

1776
01:09:42,780 --> 01:09:44,380
Of the ghost chef.

1777
01:09:44,380 --> 01:09:44,860
Yes.

1778
01:09:44,860 --> 01:09:46,460
He's very Hamlet-esque.

1779
01:09:47,180 --> 01:09:47,740
Yeah.

1780
01:09:47,740 --> 01:09:48,140
Wow.

1781
01:09:48,140 --> 01:09:48,860
Yes.

1782
01:09:48,860 --> 01:09:50,860
Ratatouille, the Hamlet of Pixar.

1783
01:09:50,860 --> 01:09:51,580
Oh, interesting.

1784
01:09:51,580 --> 01:09:53,660
Lion King is at Disney, I know, but.

1785
01:09:53,660 --> 01:09:54,220
Oh, sure.

1786
01:09:54,780 --> 01:09:55,820
I guess that's the closest.

1787
01:09:55,820 --> 01:09:57,340
Dramatic family dynamics.

1788
01:09:57,340 --> 01:09:57,820
Yeah.

1789
01:09:57,820 --> 01:09:59,100
Yeah, what are your feelings about the film?

1790
01:09:59,100 --> 01:09:59,900
You're a fan of the film.

1791
01:09:59,900 --> 01:10:00,460
I love.

1792
01:10:00,460 --> 01:10:02,300
Top three picks are.

1793
01:10:02,300 --> 01:10:04,700
Coco's number one, Ratatouille's probably number two.

1794
01:10:05,420 --> 01:10:08,300
Maybe Inside Out or Toy Story 2 is number three.

1795
01:10:08,300 --> 01:10:08,860
One of those.

1796
01:10:08,860 --> 01:10:09,340
Good picks.

1797
01:10:09,340 --> 01:10:10,300
Really good picks.

1798
01:10:10,300 --> 01:10:11,340
Emotional picks.

1799
01:10:11,340 --> 01:10:12,140
Yeah, I like to feel.

1800
01:10:14,140 --> 01:10:16,220
Well, you should like the end of Transformers, the ride.

1801
01:10:18,220 --> 01:10:20,780
I like to feel catharsis, not sore joints.

1802
01:10:21,500 --> 01:10:23,340
His head, he comes out and he says he's proud of you.

1803
01:10:23,340 --> 01:10:25,500
This is a big, well, this is actually relevant.

1804
01:10:25,500 --> 01:10:27,500
I was thinking about it because the ride does.

1805
01:10:28,700 --> 01:10:34,300
Mike has pressed that of one of the great moments in ride history is Optimus Prime

1806
01:10:34,300 --> 01:10:36,220
reaching down to you and saying.

1807
01:10:36,220 --> 01:10:38,780
Down and he goes, your bravery saved the planet.

1808
01:10:38,780 --> 01:10:40,220
Well done, freedom fighters.

1809
01:10:40,220 --> 01:10:41,340
And I feel something there.

1810
01:10:41,340 --> 01:10:41,980
I get that.

1811
01:10:41,980 --> 01:10:42,220
Yeah.

1812
01:10:42,220 --> 01:10:42,780
I'm with you.

1813
01:10:43,420 --> 01:10:43,660
Yeah.

1814
01:10:43,660 --> 01:10:45,820
But if it was only that part of the ride, you'd like it.

1815
01:10:45,820 --> 01:10:46,700
Defense rest.

1816
01:10:46,700 --> 01:10:49,500
If it was just that again and him revealing like.

1817
01:10:49,500 --> 01:10:50,140
Yeah.

1818
01:10:50,140 --> 01:10:51,420
And you're my son now.

1819
01:10:51,420 --> 01:10:52,060
Yeah.

1820
01:10:52,140 --> 01:10:55,500
And he goes one by one in the car and says something personal about each of you.

1821
01:10:55,500 --> 01:10:55,980
Yes.

1822
01:10:55,980 --> 01:10:56,940
Yes.

1823
01:10:56,940 --> 01:10:58,220
And you're a good father.

1824
01:11:00,220 --> 01:11:02,700
You've listened to the Olivia Rodrigo album.

1825
01:11:02,700 --> 01:11:03,420
You are cool.

1826
01:11:03,420 --> 01:11:05,180
Over and over again.

1827
01:11:05,180 --> 01:11:06,700
You may be a parent.

1828
01:11:06,700 --> 01:11:06,940
Yeah.

1829
01:11:06,940 --> 01:11:07,740
But you like it.

1830
01:11:09,180 --> 01:11:09,340
Yeah.

1831
01:11:09,340 --> 01:11:14,060
And he calls you by your name, Taron, as opposed to ET, you always called me Tram.

1832
01:11:14,060 --> 01:11:14,300
Yeah.

1833
01:11:15,180 --> 01:11:15,660
Tram.

1834
01:11:16,380 --> 01:11:16,780
Friend.

1835
01:11:16,780 --> 01:11:18,220
He's just doing his thing.

1836
01:11:18,220 --> 01:11:20,540
Not going to try it today, friend.

1837
01:11:20,540 --> 01:11:21,420
Buddy pal.

1838
01:11:22,540 --> 01:11:23,500
Hey, you.

1839
01:11:23,500 --> 01:11:24,140
Hey, guy.

1840
01:11:26,380 --> 01:11:27,100
Slick.

1841
01:11:27,100 --> 01:11:27,660
This guy.

1842
01:11:29,500 --> 01:11:33,180
This ride does have a, maybe you wouldn't call it a moment of intimacy.

1843
01:11:33,180 --> 01:11:37,340
I know it can't rival what you like about Transfers, but it is, I like when rides end

1844
01:11:37,340 --> 01:11:39,900
with a little round of applause for what you just did.

1845
01:11:39,900 --> 01:11:40,380
Oh, yeah.

1846
01:11:40,380 --> 01:11:44,460
You get a nice little welcoming committee at the mouse restaurant.

1847
01:11:44,460 --> 01:11:44,780
Yeah.

1848
01:11:44,780 --> 01:11:45,420
Oh, right.

1849
01:11:45,420 --> 01:11:46,620
The rat restaurant, I guess.

1850
01:11:47,740 --> 01:11:49,820
I just, I don't know, I like that in Harry Potter.

1851
01:11:49,820 --> 01:11:54,300
I just tend to like, wow, this ending is a big round, a group has gathered.

1852
01:11:54,300 --> 01:11:58,620
Maybe that's my version of, I don't need a robot to get right up in my face,

1853
01:11:58,620 --> 01:12:01,580
but I like that a crowd is, it makes me feel like I'm at a surprise party.

1854
01:12:02,380 --> 01:12:04,140
You don't like a robot and kissing distance?

1855
01:12:04,860 --> 01:12:05,820
I guess I don't.

1856
01:12:06,940 --> 01:12:09,260
I did before COVID, and now it's just personal space.

1857
01:12:09,260 --> 01:12:10,060
I hear you.

1858
01:12:10,060 --> 01:12:11,180
More of a thing for me.

1859
01:12:11,180 --> 01:12:12,700
Everyone likes a round of applause.

1860
01:12:12,700 --> 01:12:14,460
You ever just clap for a dog?

1861
01:12:14,460 --> 01:12:15,180
They love it.

1862
01:12:15,820 --> 01:12:17,180
We clap for our dogs sometimes.

1863
01:12:17,180 --> 01:12:18,380
We clap for a dog.

1864
01:12:18,380 --> 01:12:19,180
And he likes it.

1865
01:12:19,180 --> 01:12:20,460
Yeah, he likes them a lot.

1866
01:12:20,460 --> 01:12:21,740
Humans like it too.

1867
01:12:21,740 --> 01:12:26,540
To your point about the layout of Epcot though, I did feel a little trapped.

1868
01:12:26,540 --> 01:12:27,100
You know what I mean?

1869
01:12:27,100 --> 01:12:29,420
It is one way in, one way out.

1870
01:12:29,420 --> 01:12:29,980
Yeah.

1871
01:12:29,980 --> 01:12:35,020
And that the creperie is there, and then the space between the creperie and the ride

1872
01:12:35,020 --> 01:12:38,220
looks like it goes that where the restaurant is, but that's just part of the line.

1873
01:12:38,220 --> 01:12:39,100
That's just part of the queue.

1874
01:12:40,540 --> 01:12:44,620
And I feel my memory of Paris is that it is all kind of,

1875
01:12:45,260 --> 01:12:48,540
the flow of it is there's much better feng shui to it.

1876
01:12:48,540 --> 01:12:51,740
You kind of just walk up to the whole district essentially.

1877
01:12:51,740 --> 01:12:52,700
The square there.

1878
01:12:52,700 --> 01:12:55,340
Whereas I haven't gotten to do it in Epcot yet.

1879
01:12:55,340 --> 01:12:56,140
It's tucked around.

1880
01:12:56,140 --> 01:12:57,340
You could be around a corner a little.

1881
01:12:57,340 --> 01:13:03,260
Because it doesn't disrupt the main, they added this on to the France Pavilion in World

1882
01:13:03,260 --> 01:13:06,860
Showcase, which is a cool thing that they got to just expand.

1883
01:13:06,860 --> 01:13:08,620
Nothing ever happens in World Showcase.

1884
01:13:08,620 --> 01:13:14,460
That's kind of a nuts thing that they got a huge ride, that they added more beautiful

1885
01:13:14,460 --> 01:13:15,820
Parisian vibes.

1886
01:13:15,820 --> 01:13:16,620
So that's all cool.

1887
01:13:16,620 --> 01:13:19,660
But there's something awkward about the wraparound of it.

1888
01:13:19,660 --> 01:13:20,380
I thought so.

1889
01:13:20,380 --> 01:13:25,020
And you're walking by the sky chairs there as you come in.

1890
01:13:25,020 --> 01:13:26,460
So it's a little bit more of that.

1891
01:13:26,460 --> 01:13:27,420
Oh yeah.

1892
01:13:27,420 --> 01:13:28,620
Well, it's a little, yeah.

1893
01:13:28,620 --> 01:13:34,620
If you're coming in the back entrance by Boardwalk Beach Club, Yacht Club, it's a little,

1894
01:13:35,740 --> 01:13:39,980
in England, yeah, it's a little easier to just walk right into Ratatouille.

1895
01:13:39,980 --> 01:13:40,780
For sure.

1896
01:13:40,780 --> 01:13:43,740
But it's like you're in the tail of the rat.

1897
01:13:43,740 --> 01:13:44,540
It's an alleyway.

1898
01:13:44,540 --> 01:13:45,500
Yeah, it's an alleyway.

1899
01:13:45,500 --> 01:13:47,100
It's a classic theme park alleyway.

1900
01:13:47,100 --> 01:13:47,600
Yeah.

1901
01:13:48,300 --> 01:13:48,800
Yeah.

1902
01:13:51,820 --> 01:13:56,060
You'd have to take Frozen out of this, I guess, because Frozen's like a redo of an

1903
01:13:56,060 --> 01:13:56,300
already.

1904
01:13:56,300 --> 01:14:03,820
So I would say this is the first truly new World Showcase ride from scratch in over 30

1905
01:14:03,820 --> 01:14:04,300
years.

1906
01:14:04,300 --> 01:14:05,740
I think you got to go back to Maelstrom.

1907
01:14:05,740 --> 01:14:08,460
And there's only, how many rides you got there?

1908
01:14:08,460 --> 01:14:08,940
Three?

1909
01:14:08,940 --> 01:14:09,580
Three, yeah.

1910
01:14:09,580 --> 01:14:12,300
This is only the third of, yeah, yeah.

1911
01:14:12,300 --> 01:14:13,900
And former Maelstrom.

1912
01:14:13,900 --> 01:14:14,940
And yeah.

1913
01:14:14,940 --> 01:14:21,260
And the biggest scale one, as much as I love my narrow boat rides, I really do love my

1914
01:14:21,260 --> 01:14:22,060
narrow boat rides.

1915
01:14:22,060 --> 01:14:22,460
Yeah, sure.

1916
01:14:22,460 --> 01:14:24,940
But so it's exciting that they did this.

1917
01:14:24,940 --> 01:14:32,700
And also exciting that they were willing to do a big expensive ride of not one of their

1918
01:14:32,700 --> 01:14:34,460
biggest money makers ever.

1919
01:14:34,460 --> 01:14:34,700
Sure.

1920
01:14:34,700 --> 01:14:36,460
Like that's a hit movie and everything.

1921
01:14:36,460 --> 01:14:41,420
But you know, I don't like the world where they only will do a ride of something where

1922
01:14:41,420 --> 01:14:44,220
like the merch is through the roof.

1923
01:14:44,220 --> 01:14:46,700
And like this has to be a billion dollar generator.

1924
01:14:46,700 --> 01:14:48,540
But the theming was too good to pass up.

1925
01:14:49,500 --> 01:14:53,660
You have a whole area dedicated to France and specifically Paris, it feels like.

1926
01:14:54,540 --> 01:14:57,100
What's our most Parisian film?

1927
01:14:57,100 --> 01:14:57,900
It's that.

1928
01:14:57,900 --> 01:14:58,300
Yeah, yeah.

1929
01:14:58,300 --> 01:15:02,540
And the clone from France, because it was in France because of the movie taking place

1930
01:15:02,540 --> 01:15:02,700
there.

1931
01:15:02,700 --> 01:15:05,580
So it's like, well, you can't deny these two things.

1932
01:15:05,580 --> 01:15:06,140
Correct.

1933
01:15:06,140 --> 01:15:09,820
Save a little money, which always feels like they say they save a lot of money.

1934
01:15:09,820 --> 01:15:11,260
Then you go, well, it still costs $200 billion.

1935
01:15:11,260 --> 01:15:12,220
$200 billion.

1936
01:15:12,220 --> 01:15:13,500
Put on their scale.

1937
01:15:13,740 --> 01:15:16,220
OK, well, I guess they say original billion dollar.

1938
01:15:16,220 --> 01:15:19,180
Like guardians of the mission breakouts like, well, you know, it costs $300 million.

1939
01:15:19,180 --> 01:15:21,020
You're like, we could build a new ride, too, I guess.

1940
01:15:21,020 --> 01:15:22,860
Like, it doesn't seem like you save that much money.

1941
01:15:22,860 --> 01:15:24,060
Completely gutted it.

1942
01:15:24,780 --> 01:15:26,300
But what do I know?

1943
01:15:26,300 --> 01:15:27,340
I'm not I don't work there.

1944
01:15:28,300 --> 01:15:29,660
I'm just a caveman.

1945
01:15:29,660 --> 01:15:32,940
Yeah, I just like to go up and down on a ride.

1946
01:15:34,140 --> 01:15:35,100
Hear pop music.

1947
01:15:35,820 --> 01:15:38,380
Moments that anybody enjoys it that might even go to.

1948
01:15:38,380 --> 01:15:42,860
Yeah, but like particular moments that stick with anybody about the attraction.

1949
01:15:42,860 --> 01:15:44,940
I mean, I just like the pantry, the pantry.

1950
01:15:44,940 --> 01:15:47,660
That's what I was going to say from just watching a video, the pantry.

1951
01:15:47,660 --> 01:15:51,820
That feels like the big thing is for like your kid brain of like, I'm little.

1952
01:15:52,540 --> 01:15:54,860
This is what it's like to be little, which is fun.

1953
01:15:54,860 --> 01:15:55,100
Yeah.

1954
01:15:55,100 --> 01:15:56,700
Many great attractions have done that.

1955
01:15:57,260 --> 01:15:58,940
You get a big ham in this one.

1956
01:15:58,940 --> 01:15:59,980
You can order a big ham.

1957
01:15:59,980 --> 01:16:00,460
Delicious.

1958
01:16:01,980 --> 01:16:06,300
The load in and load out like the Parisian skyline and the

1959
01:16:06,300 --> 01:16:10,700
bill listing into the windows and stuff like I really, really love that.

1960
01:16:10,700 --> 01:16:11,100
Yeah.

1961
01:16:11,420 --> 01:16:15,180
You know, that was a being that I did it so long ago when I read somebody's review of it

1962
01:16:15,180 --> 01:16:20,060
and they called that out as like the when you're about to board that it's pretty magical

1963
01:16:20,060 --> 01:16:21,980
and like the soundscape of Parisian.

1964
01:16:21,980 --> 01:16:24,860
I think maybe I didn't take that in fully then.

1965
01:16:24,860 --> 01:16:27,020
So I'm excited for that in Epcot.

1966
01:16:27,020 --> 01:16:28,460
Another thing I forgot.

1967
01:16:28,460 --> 01:16:30,060
I don't know what the smells are.

1968
01:16:30,060 --> 01:16:31,500
There's smells in this.

1969
01:16:31,500 --> 01:16:32,140
Anybody know?

1970
01:16:33,020 --> 01:16:33,660
I'm not sure.

1971
01:16:33,660 --> 01:16:35,340
Actually, they don't stand out to me.

1972
01:16:35,340 --> 01:16:36,380
Can't really pinpoint.

1973
01:16:36,380 --> 01:16:36,940
So they wouldn't.

1974
01:16:36,940 --> 01:16:38,220
They're not in the great pit.

1975
01:16:38,220 --> 01:16:39,900
Do you have a favorite theme park smell?

1976
01:16:39,900 --> 01:16:40,700
Oh, yeah.

1977
01:16:40,700 --> 01:16:41,980
The oranges in Soarin.

1978
01:16:41,980 --> 01:16:42,540
Yeah.

1979
01:16:42,540 --> 01:16:43,020
Yeah.

1980
01:16:43,020 --> 01:16:43,420
Great.

1981
01:16:43,420 --> 01:16:44,300
Coming back soon.

1982
01:16:44,300 --> 01:16:45,100
Or it's in Epcot.

1983
01:16:45,100 --> 01:16:45,980
It's in Epcot right now.

1984
01:16:45,980 --> 01:16:46,220
Now.

1985
01:16:46,940 --> 01:16:49,340
I saw a massive line on Twitter or whatever.

1986
01:16:49,340 --> 01:16:49,820
X.

1987
01:16:49,820 --> 01:16:50,220
I what?

1988
01:16:50,220 --> 01:16:52,940
Look, there's people going crazy for the return.

1989
01:16:52,940 --> 01:16:53,420
Yeah.

1990
01:16:53,420 --> 01:16:54,460
So I'm very excited about it.

1991
01:16:54,460 --> 01:16:54,780
Yeah.

1992
01:16:54,780 --> 01:16:58,860
Do you care about that distinction, the Soarin California versus world?

1993
01:16:59,900 --> 01:17:01,900
I appreciate both for different reasons.

1994
01:17:01,900 --> 01:17:09,100
I do find, you know, specifically just talking about Paris, the Eiffel Tower in Soarin over

1995
01:17:09,100 --> 01:17:13,180
world always takes me out a little bit because unless you're dead center, it's a little bendy.

1996
01:17:13,180 --> 01:17:13,900
It's crazy.

1997
01:17:13,900 --> 01:17:14,300
Yes.

1998
01:17:14,300 --> 01:17:15,740
And I find that more in world.

1999
01:17:15,740 --> 01:17:20,140
Like they shot that first without taking into consideration the half bowl screen they're

2000
01:17:20,140 --> 01:17:20,700
going to be.

2001
01:17:20,700 --> 01:17:24,460
And California has far less of that.

2002
01:17:24,460 --> 01:17:24,940
Yeah.

2003
01:17:24,940 --> 01:17:26,860
Maybe Golden Gate a little bit.

2004
01:17:27,580 --> 01:17:28,140
Only that.

2005
01:17:28,140 --> 01:17:29,420
But not nearly as much.

2006
01:17:29,420 --> 01:17:29,580
Yeah.

2007
01:17:29,580 --> 01:17:30,460
They're insane.

2008
01:17:30,460 --> 01:17:31,020
Depending.

2009
01:17:31,020 --> 01:17:33,500
You can watch write-throughs and photos of that Eiffel Tower.

2010
01:17:33,500 --> 01:17:35,180
It's like, yikes.

2011
01:17:35,180 --> 01:17:35,900
Is it sick?

2012
01:17:35,900 --> 01:17:36,460
Completely.

2013
01:17:36,460 --> 01:17:36,960
Yeah.

2014
01:17:37,120 --> 01:17:41,200
This is the Salvador Dali Eiffel Tower.

2015
01:17:41,200 --> 01:17:42,480
I didn't know it could melt.

2016
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:42,980
Yeah.

2017
01:17:42,980 --> 01:17:43,760
It should be.

2018
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:47,760
Wait, that's a, just, you know, before we say a little more ratatouille stuff, are there

2019
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:52,160
any, are there like big theme park stances that come to mind?

2020
01:17:52,160 --> 01:17:56,160
Did they, you know, any of the debates where you've got like a firm, you know, anything

2021
01:17:56,160 --> 01:18:02,640
like that, you know, the Haunted Mansion holiday goes too long or anything you're like, this

2022
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:04,800
is something, this is a hill that I die on.

2023
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:12,320
I'm not as much of a purist in terms of like, you know, like even this resurfacing of Splash,

2024
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:17,520
I'm all for, I'm excited because it like makes sense and to have a thrilling princess ride

2025
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:22,240
is like, you know, Frozen was the closest, you know, Frozen gets the close.

2026
01:18:22,240 --> 01:18:22,320
Sure.

2027
01:18:25,120 --> 01:18:33,040
And I feel like as a collector of things that matter to me, it's fun, you know, to collect

2028
01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:36,960
the things that are finite, right? So I like change over.

2029
01:18:37,680 --> 01:18:38,640
Oh sure, yeah, yeah.

2030
01:18:39,120 --> 01:18:45,760
I don't have a strong, like I'm not, so I don't have any like firm lines of like, don't do,

2031
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:48,640
I could do without Captain Jack and pirates.

2032
01:18:49,360 --> 01:18:50,560
Yeah, that's a good one.

2033
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:51,520
Yeah, yeah, maybe that's-

2034
01:18:51,520 --> 01:18:55,600
Yeah, that's not so controversial, but like, get it out of here.

2035
01:18:55,600 --> 01:18:58,640
And even like female red pirate.

2036
01:18:58,640 --> 01:18:59,280
The new one?

2037
01:18:59,280 --> 01:19:01,520
Yeah, like, I'm not,

2038
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:05,440
I, great. I understand in yes and fine and great.

2039
01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:06,640
Do that, do a change.

2040
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:12,880
But why the voice is so distracting, like she's so cheery, it's so like,

2041
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:17,520
it's the run they want, you know, like I'm just like, a little great, like if,

2042
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:21,680
girls can be pirates. I've always said that.

2043
01:19:22,720 --> 01:19:24,480
On record years ago, the search any podcast.

2044
01:19:24,480 --> 01:19:29,040
But like, make her the fiercest of all, you know what I mean? Like make her like-

2045
01:19:29,040 --> 01:19:30,640
Oh yeah, crazy. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2046
01:19:31,120 --> 01:19:34,960
Like, oh, you know, back off or I'll fire one in your gut, you know, like,

2047
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:35,280
yeah, yeah.

2048
01:19:35,280 --> 01:19:36,400
Like that'd be dope.

2049
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:36,960
Yeah.

2050
01:19:36,960 --> 01:19:38,320
Taking a pig hostage.

2051
01:19:40,320 --> 01:19:41,920
It feels so apologetic in it.

2052
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:42,640
Yeah, yeah, sure.

2053
01:19:42,640 --> 01:19:43,520
That I kind of like-

2054
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:49,120
It's a little too digital too, the Rosita bird, back by the Dole Whip.

2055
01:19:49,120 --> 01:19:49,600
Oh true.

2056
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:56,000
It's all just a little too clean, like it needs some filters to make it sound like it was done on

2057
01:19:56,000 --> 01:20:04,400
analog or like, you know, a tired imagineer or like an aging character actor is like grinding this.

2058
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:07,760
Chain smoking and they're like, get Cheryl to do it, you know what I mean?

2059
01:20:07,760 --> 01:20:08,000
Yeah, yeah.

2060
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:09,440
Iron Actress, get Cheryl to do it.

2061
01:20:09,440 --> 01:20:12,080
Hey, we love your voice, we love your take on the character.

2062
01:20:12,080 --> 01:20:15,600
Could you just drain this carton of Paul Moss and then do it?

2063
01:20:16,720 --> 01:20:18,640
We will give you hazard pets.

2064
01:20:18,640 --> 01:20:21,040
We recognize this is an insane request.

2065
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:24,160
We will take care of your family after you are gone.

2066
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:24,820
Yes.

2067
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:26,560
Yeah, they need it.

2068
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:30,800
You can run analog tape through things and add extra hiss and crackle,

2069
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:34,560
but you can't really throw a hard drive down the stairs to get a safe path.

2070
01:20:36,240 --> 01:20:38,480
Just breaks it, doesn't add any nice qualities, no.

2071
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:40,640
Yeah, that's true.

2072
01:20:40,640 --> 01:20:45,360
They could have a little more, yeah, at least, and like get some teeth out of there or something.

2073
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:47,920
Yeah, dirt, she doesn't look dirtier up.

2074
01:20:47,920 --> 01:20:48,240
Yeah.

2075
01:20:48,240 --> 01:20:53,280
Like she's just like, there's a bunch of the almost hideous men with the craziest voices.

2076
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:55,840
Hello there, I'm a beautiful woman pirate.

2077
01:20:55,840 --> 01:20:58,320
You're like, this isn't quite what you think it's doing.

2078
01:20:59,040 --> 01:21:01,040
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

2079
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:01,600
You're not making-

2080
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:02,880
Inspiring a generation.

2081
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:06,800
Your coworker is napping in the mud with pigs.

2082
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:07,300
Yeah.

2083
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:11,520
He's taking his Union 15.

2084
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:11,840
Like-

2085
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:15,200
Give me a dirty lady pirate in the mud with the other one.

2086
01:21:15,200 --> 01:21:16,560
Be pretty dope, yeah.

2087
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:17,920
Yeah, and they're making out or something.

2088
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:20,400
Yeah, yeah, but get rid of Captain Jack first.

2089
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:21,120
Yeah, sure.

2090
01:21:21,120 --> 01:21:22,320
Yeah, yeah, more animatronics.

2091
01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:23,760
Take all those guts.

2092
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:26,800
We like an animatronic that moves that quickly.

2093
01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:27,600
Yeah.

2094
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:28,480
Oh, for sure.

2095
01:21:28,480 --> 01:21:29,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2096
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:32,160
Make them all new lady pirates.

2097
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:32,400
Yes.

2098
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:34,480
Make them all like disgusting lady pirates.

2099
01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:38,240
Holding jugs of neutral spirit.

2100
01:21:38,240 --> 01:21:38,720
Yeah, sure.

2101
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:40,960
If that's what it has to be, yeah.

2102
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:43,760
And they're doing like worse stuff than the men too.

2103
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:44,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2104
01:21:44,240 --> 01:21:46,560
Like they're doing really despicable things.

2105
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:48,880
One giving a tattoo, you know what I mean?

2106
01:21:48,880 --> 01:21:49,520
With just like squitting.

2107
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:51,840
And they're not licensed to do it.

2108
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:53,040
Squitting can a dagger.

2109
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:58,640
Yes, yes, somebody walks up just with a squid, puts it right in there.

2110
01:21:58,640 --> 01:21:59,140
Yeah.

2111
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:01,360
Inks it live.

2112
01:22:02,720 --> 01:22:08,160
Let's see, what have we missed about like about the rat tattoo?

2113
01:22:08,160 --> 01:22:13,680
You get a fun champagne cork burst at the end that fires you backwards.

2114
01:22:13,680 --> 01:22:16,640
Some of the force pers- I like some of the perspective.

2115
01:22:16,640 --> 01:22:19,680
Like they do the falling through the ceiling.

2116
01:22:19,680 --> 01:22:20,160
Yeah, yeah.

2117
01:22:20,160 --> 01:22:22,240
And skittering under stuff.

2118
01:22:22,240 --> 01:22:27,200
And then, oh well, Linguini talks to you, sweeps you out of the way.

2119
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:27,680
Yeah, sure.

2120
01:22:27,680 --> 01:22:29,680
That I think is done pretty well.

2121
01:22:29,680 --> 01:22:32,160
I do have a question or maybe a complaint.

2122
01:22:32,160 --> 01:22:33,200
This is one of these rides.

2123
01:22:33,200 --> 01:22:37,120
They end up in awkward territory sometimes where like the events of the film change the

2124
01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:39,040
universe and then you got to do the ride.

2125
01:22:39,040 --> 01:22:42,240
And this is one where it's like, when is this happening?

2126
01:22:42,240 --> 01:22:46,400
He has the restaurant, but Chef Skinner still works there.

2127
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:47,120
Still around, yes.

2128
01:22:47,120 --> 01:22:49,200
And Linguini's in the kitchen.

2129
01:22:49,200 --> 01:22:52,560
He has it because it's the end of the movie that they're all out of there.

2130
01:22:52,560 --> 01:22:56,400
All our friends are out of Gusteau's.

2131
01:22:56,400 --> 01:22:59,760
Yeah, they're in Sacre Cure up by Montmartre or whatever.

2132
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:01,440
They're in the hip part of the neighborhood.

2133
01:23:01,440 --> 01:23:02,240
Different district.

2134
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:03,360
Yeah, yeah, wait.

2135
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:08,400
Chez Remy is not above Gusteau's, is it?

2136
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:08,640
No.

2137
01:23:08,640 --> 01:23:10,800
I haven't seen the end in a long time.

2138
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:16,800
I'm pretty sure it's in the area called Montmartre, which is where Sacre Cure is up on the hill

2139
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:18,560
and there's all the artists there and stuff.

2140
01:23:19,040 --> 01:23:19,680
Oh, is that it?

2141
01:23:19,680 --> 01:23:22,720
They did move to like a hip upstart restaurant?

2142
01:23:22,720 --> 01:23:28,480
Yeah, at the end of the movie, it's revealed and the restaurant closes down and the critic

2143
01:23:28,480 --> 01:23:29,600
is fired.

2144
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:35,600
But then Remy and Tattoo and Linguini make a little bistro.

2145
01:23:35,600 --> 01:23:36,240
Ego invests on there.

2146
01:23:36,240 --> 01:23:38,160
Yeah, and Ego invests and he's very happy there.

2147
01:23:38,160 --> 01:23:43,360
I understand, having seen it enough times, like Gusteau's is sort of like Notre Dame

2148
01:23:43,360 --> 01:23:48,720
adjacent maybe, like east of Notre Dame, kind of closer to the river too, because he rides

2149
01:23:48,720 --> 01:23:50,080
his bike there to get rid of him.

2150
01:23:50,720 --> 01:23:53,840
And then at the end of the movie, the last shot of the sign, they're up on a hill.

2151
01:23:54,640 --> 01:23:59,760
So I feel fairly confident it's near Montmartre.

2152
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:03,040
Is Gusteau's somehow more touristy?

2153
01:24:03,040 --> 01:24:04,320
Are they trying to convey that?

2154
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:06,160
Maybe they franchised out or something.

2155
01:24:06,160 --> 01:24:08,560
Yeah, like a Bubba Gump at this point.

2156
01:24:08,560 --> 01:24:09,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2157
01:24:11,200 --> 01:24:13,200
The film was a documentary that exists.

2158
01:24:13,200 --> 01:24:14,240
Within the world.

2159
01:24:14,240 --> 01:24:14,640
Right.

2160
01:24:14,640 --> 01:24:15,120
And now.

2161
01:24:16,160 --> 01:24:16,800
Y'all hear?

2162
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:18,480
Branson's got a Gusteau's.

2163
01:24:18,480 --> 01:24:20,320
Yeah, right.

2164
01:24:20,320 --> 01:24:21,600
This is Silver Dollar City.

2165
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:24,080
It's in Silver Dollar City.

2166
01:24:24,080 --> 01:24:24,580
Yeah.

2167
01:24:25,440 --> 01:24:29,040
Anyway, you know, logic complaint, but that stuff happens.

2168
01:24:29,040 --> 01:24:35,120
It's a weird thing when like, because I don't like in finding Nemo, the submarines,

2169
01:24:35,120 --> 01:24:36,960
that the same stuff just happens again.

2170
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:39,120
Nemo is lost again.

2171
01:24:39,120 --> 01:24:39,600
Right.

2172
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:41,200
But this happens in rides.

2173
01:24:41,200 --> 01:24:44,400
Most dark rides are just sort of telling you the same story.

2174
01:24:44,960 --> 01:24:45,920
Yes, I guess so.

2175
01:24:45,920 --> 01:24:50,880
For example, the Transformers ride is mostly doing the beats of the Spider-Man ride,

2176
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:52,960
which was my big argument.

2177
01:24:52,960 --> 01:24:54,560
Oh, take that.

2178
01:24:54,560 --> 01:24:58,160
And at the end, Spider-Man says like, thanks guys, and takes your picture.

2179
01:24:59,120 --> 01:25:01,360
But he doesn't say it in an emotional way though.

2180
01:25:01,360 --> 01:25:03,840
No, but it's less intense.

2181
01:25:03,840 --> 01:25:04,400
Yes, right.

2182
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:04,880
That's true.

2183
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:07,680
And I have a more emotional connection to Spider-Man from my childhood.

2184
01:25:07,680 --> 01:25:08,000
Yeah, I do too.

2185
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,640
But optimists in my adult years.

2186
01:25:10,640 --> 01:25:11,920
I connect with so much better.

2187
01:25:12,560 --> 01:25:14,480
And not from the films, from the ride.

2188
01:25:14,480 --> 01:25:15,120
From the ride, yeah.

2189
01:25:15,120 --> 01:25:16,160
I don't care about the movies.

2190
01:25:16,160 --> 01:25:16,660
Uh-huh.

2191
01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:20,720
I've seen the first movie once or twice and that's about it.

2192
01:25:20,720 --> 01:25:24,000
You connected with him at the end of the first time you wrote it,

2193
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:27,440
so that at the start of the second time you wrote it, you're like, I love you now.

2194
01:25:27,440 --> 01:25:28,800
Yes, I love you now, yeah.

2195
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:29,280
Beautiful.

2196
01:25:29,280 --> 01:25:33,680
Yeah, Spider-Man ride is great, and better than the Transformers ride, technically.

2197
01:25:34,960 --> 01:25:35,520
Technically.

2198
01:25:36,160 --> 01:25:37,280
But not emotionally.

2199
01:25:37,280 --> 01:25:38,160
But not emotionally.

2200
01:25:38,160 --> 01:25:39,520
I see, it's about emotion.

2201
01:25:39,520 --> 01:25:40,800
Wait, that's a question.

2202
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:42,000
Emotional moments in theater.

2203
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,560
It seems like your top ones happen.

2204
01:25:44,560 --> 01:25:50,320
You got to meet beyond the characters, the real Mark Hamill and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.

2205
01:25:50,320 --> 01:25:50,820
Sure.

2206
01:25:51,760 --> 01:25:58,480
But are there still, who do you like 10-year-olds out about?

2207
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:04,640
Or do you remember any time in your life like, I met this character and this was?

2208
01:26:04,640 --> 01:26:08,800
Oh, I mean, I'm a hardcore goofy fan.

2209
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:13,360
Anytime I see Goofy in the parks, I'll go out of my way to take a photo.

2210
01:26:13,360 --> 01:26:13,920
Yeah, yeah.

2211
01:26:14,640 --> 01:26:18,560
I like when Goofy's kind of fancy in 1930s over in...

2212
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:19,360
I do too, yeah.

2213
01:26:19,360 --> 01:26:21,760
...California Adventure, Newsy Caps.

2214
01:26:21,760 --> 01:26:23,840
It's a sharp out for the high-pips.

2215
01:26:23,840 --> 01:26:24,340
Yes.

2216
01:26:26,160 --> 01:26:30,720
Yeah, in terms of like, Mickey will always be Mickey.

2217
01:26:32,560 --> 01:26:33,680
I love Mickey.

2218
01:26:34,320 --> 01:26:41,840
My dad's a big Jiminy Cricket fan, loves Jiminy Cricket.

2219
01:26:41,840 --> 01:26:42,320
Oh, wow.

2220
01:26:42,320 --> 01:26:44,480
So there's like an emotional connection.

2221
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:46,160
He's my Optimus Prime.

2222
01:26:46,160 --> 01:26:46,800
I see.

2223
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:47,440
Yes.

2224
01:26:47,440 --> 01:26:48,400
He's emotional, yeah.

2225
01:26:50,160 --> 01:26:59,120
Yeah, but I will say like some of these, like seeing the new Captain America out there is freaking dope.

2226
01:26:59,120 --> 01:26:59,600
Oh, sure, yeah.

2227
01:27:00,320 --> 01:27:03,760
Sam, you know, is cool.

2228
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:05,120
Is this the question that you asked?

2229
01:27:05,120 --> 01:27:07,280
I think so, yeah, yeah, sure, why not?

2230
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,400
Because it started emotional and then it was like 10-year-old,

2231
01:27:11,040 --> 01:27:13,920
who am I excited to see is how I took it.

2232
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:14,720
Yeah, I think so.

2233
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,320
Who leaps past the construct?

2234
01:27:18,320 --> 01:27:22,960
I know what this is and yet this still is giving me the moment of yeah, yeah, yeah.

2235
01:27:23,680 --> 01:27:27,840
Any kid superhero stuff kills me just because it's like...

2236
01:27:28,160 --> 01:27:28,660
Yeah.

2237
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:33,360
Yeah, superheroes feeling real was always my desire throughout childhood.

2238
01:27:33,360 --> 01:27:34,160
Yeah, yeah.

2239
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:38,160
But I think goofy is the more succinct answer.

2240
01:27:38,160 --> 01:27:39,680
Goofy, I'm always like, oh man.

2241
01:27:42,720 --> 01:27:43,600
Taught me how to ski.

2242
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:46,480
You try to put your pajamas on after.

2243
01:27:47,840 --> 01:27:49,600
Your legs spread so far apart.

2244
01:27:49,600 --> 01:27:51,920
There was no way you were going to get down the hill that far apart.

2245
01:27:53,200 --> 01:27:54,400
You thought you could golf.

2246
01:27:55,040 --> 01:27:55,840
I could use that.

2247
01:27:57,680 --> 01:28:00,000
That voice, I could use that in the park somewhere.

2248
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:03,600
When skiing, it's important to remember.

2249
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:04,240
Oh, I know.

2250
01:28:04,240 --> 01:28:06,400
I could use that voice in the park somewhere.

2251
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:08,640
That would bring me happiness.

2252
01:28:08,640 --> 01:28:13,360
Has that ever been, I think there was some obscure Epcot thing in Wonders of Life that

2253
01:28:13,360 --> 01:28:14,800
was kind of structured like that.

2254
01:28:14,800 --> 01:28:16,080
Oh, the goofy.

2255
01:28:16,080 --> 01:28:17,600
Oh God, a ride of the goofy.

2256
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:24,240
When ordering a corn dog from corn dog castle, you must decide what is best.

2257
01:28:24,240 --> 01:28:27,360
Do I have a meat or cheese focused corn dog?

2258
01:28:28,240 --> 01:28:30,880
Make your choice before you have reached the window.

2259
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:32,160
It's always preferable.

2260
01:28:32,160 --> 01:28:34,400
That's got to be, you could put that in Toontown somewhere.

2261
01:28:34,400 --> 01:28:37,680
Yeah, that would be an easy thing.

2262
01:28:37,680 --> 01:28:39,040
Even if it's like a photo booth.

2263
01:28:41,200 --> 01:28:46,800
When selecting the picture to best capture your visage, please remember.

2264
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:47,600
That'd be awesome.

2265
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:50,080
Yeah, you can't really go in Goofy's house, right?

2266
01:28:50,800 --> 01:28:51,840
There's something in there.

2267
01:28:51,840 --> 01:28:52,400
I don't know what it is.

2268
01:28:52,400 --> 01:28:54,720
Maybe you wander about a little bit.

2269
01:28:54,720 --> 01:28:55,200
Yeah.

2270
01:28:55,200 --> 01:28:56,320
Like it's not like that old.

2271
01:28:56,320 --> 01:28:57,600
I don't know what Mickey's house.

2272
01:28:57,600 --> 01:29:00,080
What's the limit of Mickey's house now that Runaway Railway is there?

2273
01:29:01,040 --> 01:29:02,080
Mickey hasn't been shifted.

2274
01:29:02,080 --> 01:29:05,280
Mickey's house hasn't been shifted, I don't think, because it was always closer to the

2275
01:29:05,840 --> 01:29:06,160
gadget.

2276
01:29:06,160 --> 01:29:09,520
But they got rid of the whole long line to get to the meet and greet, I believe.

2277
01:29:09,520 --> 01:29:11,600
Because remember, you used to go from his house into the back.

2278
01:29:11,600 --> 01:29:13,040
Well, Minnie's house came first.

2279
01:29:13,040 --> 01:29:16,400
Minnie's was always closer to where Runaway Railroad is.

2280
01:29:17,440 --> 01:29:22,080
Town Hall is my memory, City Hall that they kind of shoved.

2281
01:29:22,880 --> 01:29:23,440
Yeah, I think so.

2282
01:29:23,440 --> 01:29:24,160
But I don't think any of these things are there.

2283
01:29:24,160 --> 01:29:25,200
His house is the same.

2284
01:29:25,200 --> 01:29:28,720
I just mean that you used to be able to walk through it and then you could walk through

2285
01:29:28,720 --> 01:29:30,000
the movie barn.

2286
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:30,480
Yeah.

2287
01:29:30,480 --> 01:29:31,200
And that's all you think.

2288
01:29:31,200 --> 01:29:31,920
Is that still there?

2289
01:29:31,920 --> 01:29:32,880
I think that's all still there.

2290
01:29:32,880 --> 01:29:33,360
I think that's all still there.

2291
01:29:33,360 --> 01:29:34,720
Then I'm wishing you're correct.

2292
01:29:34,720 --> 01:29:42,320
Because again, it's more north and Minnie, they folded part of a gift shop, but they took

2293
01:29:42,320 --> 01:29:46,000
over a storage, like a sound stage behind it.

2294
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:49,920
So I don't think that they took away anything that was in the footprint.

2295
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:52,160
Really all I want to say is I want Goofy's house to be that long.

2296
01:29:52,880 --> 01:29:54,160
That was my guy too.

2297
01:29:54,160 --> 01:29:55,600
So yeah, that's true.

2298
01:29:55,600 --> 01:29:57,440
I want to see this silly guy's house.

2299
01:29:57,440 --> 01:29:57,760
Yeah.

2300
01:29:57,760 --> 01:29:59,120
Silly dog.

2301
01:29:59,120 --> 01:29:59,920
It's just a bounce.

2302
01:29:59,920 --> 01:30:02,400
It's like, hey, there's just a couple of rooms, like Goofy's bounce house.

2303
01:30:02,400 --> 01:30:04,880
It's not that bouncy because that's not safe.

2304
01:30:04,880 --> 01:30:05,200
Right.

2305
01:30:05,200 --> 01:30:10,160
And there's a lot more garden now since Toontown has reopened, which is nice.

2306
01:30:10,160 --> 01:30:11,040
AstroTurf.

2307
01:30:11,040 --> 01:30:11,540
Yeah.

2308
01:30:12,880 --> 01:30:16,640
But Donald's boat is certainly more, you can explore it much more.

2309
01:30:16,640 --> 01:30:17,140
Yeah.

2310
01:30:17,840 --> 01:30:18,240
Sure.

2311
01:30:18,240 --> 01:30:18,740
Yeah.

2312
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:20,640
You're right about that, Narendra.

2313
01:30:20,640 --> 01:30:23,440
Just anywhere by default, where they need.

2314
01:30:23,440 --> 01:30:27,360
When using the urinal, try to not splash on the ground.

2315
01:30:27,360 --> 01:30:27,860
Yes.

2316
01:30:30,400 --> 01:30:33,600
So also more people might use the app, I would say.

2317
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:34,720
If the app talked to you like that?

2318
01:30:34,720 --> 01:30:36,720
Yes, if that's the guide of the...

2319
01:30:37,840 --> 01:30:40,080
What about just having your ways do the voice?

2320
01:30:40,080 --> 01:30:40,580
Yeah.

2321
01:30:40,580 --> 01:30:41,280
Oh, that's good.

2322
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:41,780
Lancashire.

2323
01:30:41,780 --> 01:30:42,660
Lancashire.

2324
01:30:44,500 --> 01:30:51,780
When turning onto Anaheim Boulevard, please veer to the right for downtown Disney.

2325
01:30:52,740 --> 01:30:56,740
Do not exit Disney Way, even though it has Disney in it.

2326
01:30:56,740 --> 01:30:57,700
That'll trip you up.

2327
01:30:58,580 --> 01:31:00,420
Harbor actually is the better.

2328
01:31:00,420 --> 01:31:03,700
Please close other apps using significant power.

2329
01:31:05,140 --> 01:31:06,900
Your phone is getting hot.

2330
01:31:06,900 --> 01:31:09,860
Are you using the Disneyland app right now?

2331
01:31:10,820 --> 01:31:16,420
Allow us to track all the time or only while using the app.

2332
01:31:16,420 --> 01:31:18,900
Don't you want to see ads tailored to you?

2333
01:31:20,900 --> 01:31:23,620
Can the Disney Company use your information?

2334
01:31:23,620 --> 01:31:25,540
Allow all cookies?

2335
01:31:27,060 --> 01:31:28,980
This is just a formality.

2336
01:31:28,980 --> 01:31:30,260
We already have it.

2337
01:31:31,540 --> 01:31:33,220
I was just being polite.

2338
01:31:33,220 --> 01:31:35,460
Scanned your eyes many times.

2339
01:31:36,820 --> 01:31:38,020
All right, well, any final thought?

2340
01:31:38,020 --> 01:31:40,980
We've been all over the map, but is there anything else to get out of it?

2341
01:31:40,980 --> 01:31:42,180
Really, of anything?

2342
01:31:43,540 --> 01:31:50,340
Kiss good nights to this ride, or anything you're looking forward to in near theme park future.

2343
01:31:50,340 --> 01:31:52,020
Was there merch from this ride or anything?

2344
01:31:52,660 --> 01:31:53,460
I don't know.

2345
01:31:53,460 --> 01:31:54,740
I'm sure there was.

2346
01:31:54,740 --> 01:31:56,900
I didn't seek that out.

2347
01:31:56,900 --> 01:31:58,260
You know what there was when it...

2348
01:31:58,260 --> 01:32:00,580
I don't know if they ever did it in Paris for the ride.

2349
01:32:01,780 --> 01:32:05,460
I assume that they would in Chez Remy or whatever,

2350
01:32:05,460 --> 01:32:09,140
but in World Showcase, they used to have in the French restaurant,

2351
01:32:09,140 --> 01:32:14,020
they had a really delicate little animatronic of Remy,

2352
01:32:14,020 --> 01:32:15,460
who they bring up to the table,

2353
01:32:15,460 --> 01:32:18,740
and he's surrounded by strawberries and cheese and what have you,

2354
01:32:18,740 --> 01:32:21,060
and you could hang out with him while you eat.

2355
01:32:21,060 --> 01:32:23,060
Like what they do with Grogu now kind of thing,

2356
01:32:23,060 --> 01:32:24,100
because they'll bring around...

2357
01:32:24,100 --> 01:32:25,300
What do they do with Grogu?

2358
01:32:25,300 --> 01:32:26,100
He's in a bag.

2359
01:32:26,100 --> 01:32:27,300
They're wandering through.

2360
01:32:27,300 --> 01:32:28,500
He's in a bag with New York.

2361
01:32:28,500 --> 01:32:29,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2362
01:32:29,300 --> 01:32:30,100
I think I'd see that.

2363
01:32:30,100 --> 01:32:30,900
He looks around and does a thing.

2364
01:32:30,900 --> 01:32:31,700
It's pretty cool.

2365
01:32:31,700 --> 01:32:32,500
Huh, huh.

2366
01:32:32,500 --> 01:32:32,660
Yeah.

2367
01:32:32,660 --> 01:32:34,100
Can you feed him?

2368
01:32:34,100 --> 01:32:35,700
Can you feed him anything?

2369
01:32:35,700 --> 01:32:36,740
Can you do anything for him?

2370
01:32:36,740 --> 01:32:37,940
You're doing those eggs?

2371
01:32:37,940 --> 01:32:38,500
Don't touch.

2372
01:32:40,420 --> 01:32:41,300
This is not the way.

2373
01:32:42,260 --> 01:32:42,740
Yeah, yeah.

2374
01:32:44,260 --> 01:32:46,340
In terms of merch that I'm excited about,

2375
01:32:46,340 --> 01:32:48,660
I've started collecting the 100 coin,

2376
01:32:48,660 --> 01:32:52,980
like the 100th anniversary, 100 years of Disney coins around Disneyland.

2377
01:32:52,980 --> 01:32:54,500
And you get them at different spots?

2378
01:32:54,500 --> 01:32:55,000
Yeah.

2379
01:32:56,180 --> 01:32:59,300
Not inexpensive for a vending machine collection,

2380
01:32:59,300 --> 01:33:03,300
but they do feel significant once you have them.

2381
01:33:03,300 --> 01:33:05,060
Right. Are there 100 of them?

2382
01:33:05,060 --> 01:33:07,060
It's like, I don't know.

2383
01:33:07,060 --> 01:33:07,780
I don't know.

2384
01:33:07,780 --> 01:33:10,500
It's like the updated pressed penny.

2385
01:33:10,500 --> 01:33:10,820
Yeah.

2386
01:33:10,820 --> 01:33:14,980
But I'm up to, if you can get four at every machine,

2387
01:33:15,700 --> 01:33:16,980
close to 30.

2388
01:33:16,980 --> 01:33:17,460
Oh, wow.

2389
01:33:17,460 --> 01:33:18,020
I like that.

2390
01:33:18,020 --> 01:33:18,820
That's pretty good.

2391
01:33:18,820 --> 01:33:19,300
I like them.

2392
01:33:19,300 --> 01:33:19,780
I like this feel good.

2393
01:33:19,780 --> 01:33:21,860
You pick the design or they're randomized?

2394
01:33:21,860 --> 01:33:22,820
There's like four options.

2395
01:33:22,820 --> 01:33:23,380
Yeah, they're random.

2396
01:33:23,380 --> 01:33:23,780
Oh, four options.

2397
01:33:23,780 --> 01:33:24,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2398
01:33:24,660 --> 01:33:26,580
You can do one or all.

2399
01:33:27,540 --> 01:33:33,620
In terms of Ratatouille, Kiska, some more Anton Ego,

2400
01:33:33,620 --> 01:33:38,900
because you started with him and his sort of soliloquy at the end of that movie is like,

2401
01:33:39,700 --> 01:33:42,100
I always get very emotional about it.

2402
01:33:42,100 --> 01:33:47,460
That's another Optimist Prime moment for me of understanding that creation and making art,

2403
01:33:47,460 --> 01:33:49,700
no matter the quality, has more value than anything.

2404
01:33:49,700 --> 01:33:55,620
Tearing it down is one of the best written monologues, I think, in any movie,

2405
01:33:55,620 --> 01:33:57,140
but certainly any Disney movie.

2406
01:33:57,140 --> 01:33:57,700
Geez, yeah.

2407
01:33:57,700 --> 01:33:58,580
I gotta re-watch that.

2408
01:33:59,300 --> 01:34:03,460
So you should hear that monologue or a monologue equivalent to it.

2409
01:34:04,260 --> 01:34:07,860
You should just sit in a room in front of a squaw, he says that to you.

2410
01:34:07,860 --> 01:34:08,260
Yes.

2411
01:34:08,260 --> 01:34:09,700
And then says he's proud of you.

2412
01:34:09,700 --> 01:34:10,260
Yes.

2413
01:34:10,260 --> 01:34:13,620
About like, but instead of creating art, it's about waiting in line for a long time.

2414
01:34:14,260 --> 01:34:15,860
Then ultimately the payoff is worth it.

2415
01:34:16,820 --> 01:34:18,580
Yeah, tailor it to a theme park experience.

2416
01:34:20,580 --> 01:34:21,700
Just use the AI voice.

2417
01:34:21,700 --> 01:34:22,340
Use his voice.

2418
01:34:23,460 --> 01:34:25,220
Yeah, yeah, take Peter O'Toole's voice.

2419
01:34:26,020 --> 01:34:27,620
We're all in favor of that.

2420
01:34:27,620 --> 01:34:29,780
Yeah, yeah, don't pay his family any money.

2421
01:34:29,780 --> 01:34:30,260
No, no, no.

2422
01:34:31,220 --> 01:34:32,980
You've got something important to do here.

2423
01:34:34,580 --> 01:34:38,340
And I do thank you on behalf of Mike for calling that an Optimist Prime moment.

2424
01:34:38,340 --> 01:34:38,820
Yeah, thank you.

2425
01:34:38,820 --> 01:34:39,940
For using the parlance.

2426
01:34:39,940 --> 01:34:40,820
I appreciate that.

2427
01:34:42,580 --> 01:34:44,340
Intimacy equals Optimist Prime.

2428
01:34:44,340 --> 01:34:44,840
Yes.

2429
01:34:45,540 --> 01:34:47,140
Well, I feel like we made it.

2430
01:34:47,140 --> 01:34:50,420
I think we can say, Tarrant Killam, you survived podcast The Ride.

2431
01:34:51,220 --> 01:34:51,940
What a thrill.

2432
01:34:51,940 --> 01:34:53,300
So happy to get to do this.

2433
01:34:53,300 --> 01:34:58,980
And thank you for filling us in on your whole emotional journey from Galaxy's Edge

2434
01:34:58,980 --> 01:35:03,620
into Club 33 and into an ever growing coin collection.

2435
01:35:03,620 --> 01:35:04,120
Yes.

2436
01:35:06,420 --> 01:35:10,820
Knowing that strikes are going on, at least as we record this, I don't know.

2437
01:35:10,820 --> 01:35:11,940
We haven't checked.

2438
01:35:11,940 --> 01:35:13,620
Yeah, we all gotta check our phones.

2439
01:35:13,620 --> 01:35:17,380
And then later this episode, like they thought it was going to end that day.

2440
01:35:17,380 --> 01:35:21,060
It went another two years after this episode.

2441
01:35:21,060 --> 01:35:24,260
Anyways, nonetheless, let's exit through the gift shop.

2442
01:35:24,260 --> 01:35:25,620
Is there anything you'd like to plug?

2443
01:35:27,540 --> 01:35:28,420
No, no.

2444
01:35:29,220 --> 01:35:32,500
Solidarity, Union Strong.

2445
01:35:34,340 --> 01:35:35,460
I've been a fan.

2446
01:35:35,460 --> 01:35:39,860
Kyle Mooney told me about this podcast, I think, at this point, like five or six years ago.

2447
01:35:39,860 --> 01:35:40,900
Oh, wow.

2448
01:35:40,900 --> 01:35:42,740
And so I've been listening for a long time.

2449
01:35:42,740 --> 01:35:43,460
Oh, gee.

2450
01:35:43,460 --> 01:35:44,260
Thank you.

2451
01:35:44,260 --> 01:35:45,220
Thank you.

2452
01:35:45,220 --> 01:35:45,860
Appreciate it.

2453
01:35:45,860 --> 01:35:46,660
I'd be here with you all.

2454
01:35:46,660 --> 01:35:48,020
We're so happy to have you.

2455
01:35:48,100 --> 01:35:49,860
Yeah, same thing.

2456
01:35:49,860 --> 01:35:54,020
I've heard you're a big fan of this stuff and I knew it would be super fun to talk to you.

2457
01:35:54,020 --> 01:35:56,020
So thrilled you could make the time.

2458
01:35:56,020 --> 01:35:57,860
So thank you, Kyle, for setting it up.

2459
01:35:57,860 --> 01:36:05,700
And also then the Twitter user who nudged it, who is Reggie's Reggie Woogity Woogity.

2460
01:36:06,900 --> 01:36:07,400
Wow.

2461
01:36:08,420 --> 01:36:10,500
Who also says abolish ICE in their bio.

2462
01:36:10,500 --> 01:36:10,900
OK.

2463
01:36:10,900 --> 01:36:12,820
All right, so that's good.

2464
01:36:12,820 --> 01:36:15,380
And then getting Taron on the show, also good.

2465
01:36:15,380 --> 01:36:16,020
So thank you.

2466
01:36:16,020 --> 01:36:16,900
Thank you for that.

2474
01:36:38,100 --> 01:36:43,620
Yeah, we fire it in the space and we it implodes, I guess they load it with explosives.

2475
01:36:43,620 --> 01:36:44,120
Together.

2476
01:36:44,840 --> 01:36:46,040
Oh, yeah, what is one?

2477
01:36:46,040 --> 01:36:46,920
Is that the thing?

2478
01:36:46,920 --> 01:36:47,720
That's the thing.

2479
01:36:47,720 --> 01:36:48,200
Wow.

2480
01:36:48,200 --> 01:36:51,000
From from Jorgun Mel himself.

2481
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:51,480
Yes.

2482
01:36:51,480 --> 01:36:51,960
Wow.

2483
01:36:51,960 --> 01:36:52,440
All right.

2484
01:36:52,440 --> 01:36:53,400
Jorgun says bye.
