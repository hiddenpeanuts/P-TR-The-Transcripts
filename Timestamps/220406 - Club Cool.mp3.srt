1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,560
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, The Second Gate,

3
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:26,240
a show hosted by three thirsty men.

4
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,240
Thirsty for Coca-Cola products from around the globe.

5
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,200
I'm Jason Sheridan joined by Mike Carlson.

6
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,520
Yes, I am here and I am thirsty.

7
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,000
Thirsty, thirsty.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,800
Sense us being some very thirsty boys.

9
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,120
I just wanted to clarify that it was for delicious

10
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,120
soft drink beverages.

11
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:48,960
Yeah, that's right.

12
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,080
And not the other definition.

13
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,200
There's gonna be a lot, I wanna warn everyone,

14
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,080
there's gonna be a lot of mouth noise on today's show,

15
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,720
which I know everyone out there loves.

16
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:56,600
They love us.

17
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,280
Not discussion of mouth feels.

18
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,120
There's gonna be mouth feels.

19
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,200
Here, I made everyone some Coca-Cola cake.

20
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,040
Here, let's get it out.

21
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:02,880
Okay.

22
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:03,720
Nom, nom, nom, nom, nom.

23
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:04,560
What do you think of this?

24
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,380
Is this good?

25
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:06,360
Nom, nom, nom, nom, nom.

26
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,720
So yeah, prepare for that.

27
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:10,080
Coca-Cola, very versatile ingredient.

28
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,680
Barbecue sauce and cake mixes,

29
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,800
you can really use it for a lot of things.

30
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:15,640
Is it, have you?

31
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,480
Have you had Coke and stuff that you like?

32
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,760
I have had Coke and stuff.

33
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:22,920
It helps break down, it helps tenderize meat

34
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,520
and I think it just adds a sweetness or sweetness.

35
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,880
I see that, but I always feel that that's,

36
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:30,480
I don't know, I know nothing of what I'm talking about,

37
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:34,040
but anytime I see like, oh yeah, like Coca-Cola,

38
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:37,720
not infused, but like, I don't know what you would say even,

39
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,540
like Coca-Cola ribs or some shit.

40
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,640
It never tastes like, like what's the point?

41
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,460
What is it?

42
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:43,480
It seems like it's a trick.

43
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,880
It seems like I'm being tricked.

44
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:45,720
Yeah.

45
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,400
And it's even, I feel that way sometimes about like,

46
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,640
the Planet Hollywood Captain Crunch or something,

47
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,800
like cereal infused something.

48
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:55,280
What are you, you were questioning the Captain Crunch,

49
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:56,960
you're questioning the quality.

50
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:57,780
Well I'm just saying sometimes when they-

51
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:58,840
This fine dish.

52
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,720
I'm just saying sometimes they have like something

53
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,360
that sounds like, oh, a fun, weird thing

54
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,200
that has like a big sugary addition to it

55
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,640
and I'm let down by it because I want it to taste

56
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,040
like the thing that is like the special treat in it.

57
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,920
You're thinking it might be like a quarter Captain Crunch

58
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,400
and three quarters breadcrumbs

59
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,240
or three quarters corn flakes or something.

60
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,060
Here's what I'm thinking.

61
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:19,960
I'm thinking that it's like,

62
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,160
there's some sort of chemical element to Coca-Cola

63
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,800
that's more important than the actual taste of it

64
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,440
because like it's some sort of weird goopy corn syrup sludge

65
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,400
and maybe it's like a bonding agent

66
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,840
and that's actually more helpful

67
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,840
in the preparation of the dish

68
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,920
than actually the taste of Coca-Cola.

69
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,840
That's possible, yeah.

70
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,680
I don't want to talk about that.

71
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,480
Well I think, yeah, I think you're at a very corporate

72
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:46,260
chain restaurant and then you're looking at a menu item

73
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:49,400
with the trademark in the name of the dish.

74
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,240
Yeah.

75
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,080
I think you're asking for trouble.

76
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,320
That just feels like, you know,

77
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:57,240
this is the product of some kind of, you know,

78
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,600
not merger but.

79
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,840
It's like, you know what it's like?

80
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:04,520
It's like, it's like, it's like, it's like barbecue ribs

81
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:08,420
like infused with Coca-Cola, a Coca-Cola story.

82
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:09,680
You know, it's like, and it did,

83
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,600
it's like something that's like a satellite

84
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,760
off of something I know.

85
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,240
It's Star Wars, it's a Star Wars story.

86
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:19,000
Yeah, yeah, it's a Coca-Cola story.

87
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,540
Well. So you shouldn't expect

88
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:22,760
what you expect with regular Coca-Cola.

89
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,120
It's often a big marketing, but like I've talked before

90
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,520
about when TGI Fridays were like,

91
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,680
and we've got Jack Daniel's chicken wings

92
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,200
or Jack Daniel's glaze.

93
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,080
And you're trying to get, yeah,

94
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,100
you're trying to get dad's mouth watering

95
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:35,840
for delicious Jack Daniels.

96
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,680
Getting dad thirsty, yeah.

97
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,800
You're trying to get dad thirsty.

98
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,020
And it's just like a fraction of it

99
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:43,400
and a different cut of corn syrup.

100
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,000
Yeah, so this is my point, yes, yes.

101
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,480
Or a different configuration of corn syrup.

102
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,280
It's interesting to say that we're talking today

103
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,360
about Club Cool and it's, you know,

104
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:55,360
many different forms and its predecessor Ice Station Cool.

105
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,960
Because Yesterland, you know, a great blog

106
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,840
that documents like long gone attractions and stuff,

107
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,960
put in, it's planted a seed of doubt

108
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,760
that like, are these sodas, this is Club Cool's,

109
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,940
has soda samples from around the world

110
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:12,280
from the Coca-Cola company.

111
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:15,720
They suggest it like, are these drinks this sweet

112
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,880
in other countries, some of these drinks?

113
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,940
Oh, really? Interesting, yeah.

114
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:23,460
And I didn't see that come up many other places.

115
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:25,860
But there is a pretty common thing

116
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:28,180
that the American palette is like,

117
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:30,480
everything is much sweeter here.

118
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,900
Okay, sure. Right, yes.

119
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:32,980
And that makes sense too,

120
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:36,580
because if you've had the different sodas of the world,

121
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:41,180
yeah, they all do taste as sweet as anything we have here.

122
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:42,760
But it would make sense that like,

123
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,500
we don't need everything to be that sweet.

124
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,860
And I know you're gonna say, oh, this is coming from,

125
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:49,300
this is a hypocritical statement from you.

126
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:51,820
You maniac, and maybe it is.

127
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:55,580
But I do think like- Blue goo oriented cocktails.

128
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:57,220
I think blue goo could be less sweet.

129
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:59,560
I don't think it actually has to be as sweet as it is,

130
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,560
I think.

131
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,180
But yeah, it's an interesting question.

132
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:05,020
I bet, I don't know,

133
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:07,780
whether it's true that the actual brand name sodas

134
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:09,680
we're having are not that sweet.

135
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,300
I think in other countries, yeah,

136
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:14,380
I've had different drinks and sodas where you go,

137
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,740
oh, this wouldn't fly here

138
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:19,660
is like a fun brightly colored sugar drink.

139
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:21,940
Like this would, somebody would go, what happened to this?

140
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:23,180
Something's missing here.

141
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:25,340
But they do have brightly colored sugar drinks

142
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:26,260
in other countries.

143
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:27,620
Yeah, I'm just saying- Less sugar,

144
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:29,100
or less chemical. Exactly, that's what I'm saying.

145
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:31,260
I've had other drinks like that,

146
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:32,820
where it's, in America,

147
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:35,660
you would expect a certain sugar level.

148
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:38,380
Yeah. So we say, oh, that's interesting.

149
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:42,300
Yeah, it doesn't feel to me like any of these drinks are,

150
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,580
I don't feel like there's a popular one in terms of,

151
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:47,060
oh, I wish we had this.

152
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:50,420
Like we, I'm sure we all saw the lists of the sodas

153
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:53,220
from around the world that are available at this place.

154
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,260
But I don't think there's like a super stud.

155
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:57,500
There's not a hit single in there, right?

156
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:01,580
Well, I recently back in the last few months,

157
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:04,540
I have seen what as of November, 2021

158
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:06,780
was the current Club Cool lineup.

159
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:08,300
I sampled them.

160
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:12,020
I left a hint for myself in the past

161
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:16,060
where I took a picture of the current lineup

162
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:18,980
and then drew on it on my iPhone

163
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:21,180
to circle the ones I liked the most.

164
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,580
So you're the- Oh, your favorite.

165
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:23,580
So, okay. This is great.

166
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:26,140
Because I was, yeah, I knew you had been recently.

167
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:28,820
So we do have a pretty recent-

168
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,540
Oh, good, there has been a taste test.

169
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:31,740
Exactly, because I didn't want to-

170
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:32,580
In the relative limits of the past.

171
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:34,500
Yeah, I feel like we weren't giving the listeners here

172
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,620
authenticity and actual reviews.

173
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:38,220
So Jason, thank goodness,

174
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:40,300
has recently tasted these on his lips.

175
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,540
Well, we remember, of course,

176
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:43,740
that we got the text from Jason,

177
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:45,620
one of my favorite texts from Jason,

178
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:48,060
when you told us, yeah, the park is crazy.

179
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:51,060
I made it to Club Cool by the skin of my teeth.

180
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,260
Or whatever, what phrase is that?

181
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:53,260
Probably not skinnier teeth.

182
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:54,420
Doesn't it? Yeah, skinnier teeth.

183
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:57,540
That may have been, was the context,

184
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:59,180
I think the crowds were overwhelming

185
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:01,700
and that Epcot construction,

186
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:04,540
it never gets old, how annoying it is.

187
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:06,580
Yeah, there's so many giant walk-arounds.

188
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:07,820
But my thing was just,

189
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,580
it's funny that you ended up in a scenario

190
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:11,780
where like, oh God, are we gonna make,

191
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:14,260
are we going to get to sample all the sodas in the world?

192
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:16,860
Oh God, like you're apologizing your family,

193
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:20,940
like please look, if we can hold together and bond,

194
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,980
maybe we can forge through the fire

195
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:25,060
and make it to the soda stand.

196
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:27,300
If memory serves, that was a combination of like,

197
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,620
the crowds were overwhelming that day

198
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:32,780
and thunderstorms kept like popping in and out.

199
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:35,060
Oh geez, so the elements are trying to get you-

200
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:37,700
Yeah, God himself is trying to stop Jason

201
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,260
from getting to Club Cool.

202
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:41,780
You will not try these fancy Fentas.

203
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:45,180
Jason's diving out of the way of lightning bolts.

204
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:49,540
We did, and Jay and Jane and my brother did wait in the,

205
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:50,980
admittedly there was a short line,

206
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:52,620
there was like five or 10 minutes to get in

207
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:55,580
because it was, they were giving each party

208
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:57,860
their own tasting fountain.

209
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,780
Right, which is the COVID protocol.

210
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:05,780
COVID protocol, which actually made sense.

211
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:08,940
We were able to sample everything else and even go back

212
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,380
and like, I wanna try that one again.

213
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:14,060
So was able to get a good bearing on it, I thought.

214
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,940
How many hours were you there?

215
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:17,460
How many hours did you spend?

216
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:18,300
Out?

217
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:23,300
And did you bring a big plastic jug to take any home?

218
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:27,900
Yeah, a big Nalgie, I dug out my college Nalgie bottle.

219
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:31,020
It's perfectly in a mini fridge.

220
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,980
This is our breakfast tomorrow.

221
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:37,060
The Super Soaker 200 backpack that usually has water in it.

222
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:38,820
Yeah, I had a Camelback.

223
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:44,140
I had a moldy college Nalgie bottle that I hyper bleached

224
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:47,700
to fill up with a country club meringue.

225
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:52,780
Yeah, so, and this was still pretty new

226
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:56,780
because Club Cool closed down in 2019.

227
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:58,060
It's had many lives.

228
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:00,780
It reopened in September, 2021.

229
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:03,740
So it was only a couple months old when I was there.

230
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:08,020
It's adjacent to the place whose name

231
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:12,620
I never remember the Creations Shop,

232
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:16,740
the new big Epcot store that is a name that means nothing.

233
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:17,580
I don't know what it means.

234
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:18,420
Yeah, that's a nice name.

235
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:20,540
Sounds religious to me.

236
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:22,620
The Creationism Shop.

237
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:25,340
Before you say flavors and flavors that you like,

238
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:27,020
let me just say really quickly,

239
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:29,740
if you don't know, if you've never been,

240
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:32,380
this is in Epcot Center, it's in Future World,

241
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:36,260
and it is a Coca-Cola store, an ongoing exhibit,

242
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:38,060
and a tasting station, as we've said,

243
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:40,540
of where you can try different Coca-Cola products

244
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:42,460
and sodas from around the world.

245
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:43,660
Just wanted to say that really quick,

246
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:45,020
but there are going to be some listeners

247
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:48,860
who think that what I just did was beyond the pale

248
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:52,140
to even stop and explain this in any way

249
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:55,700
as if this isn't the most important thing

250
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,180
in all of Disney World.

251
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:00,540
And I say this because I've fallen into some pits

252
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:02,340
when it comes to Club Cool.

253
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:04,460
And that's part of wanting to do an episode

254
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:06,780
to work through some of this stuff.

255
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,500
Club Cool came up on the show once before.

256
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,220
I sort of knew that this was there.

257
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:12,060
That was the thing where you try the sodas of the world.

258
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:12,900
Got it.

259
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,540
I'll admit fault on this one.

260
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:19,220
I laughed at you guys, and I said,

261
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:21,140
this thing is not a big deal.

262
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:23,580
And everybody went, Rob, Rob, Rob,

263
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,700
Scott's wrong, Scott wrong, blah.

264
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:26,980
Okay, I get it.

265
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:28,980
Club Cool is apparently one of the most

266
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:31,900
crucial attractions in Disney World.

267
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:34,580
Was this your guys point of view,

268
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:36,860
or have you ramped up your Club Cool feelings

269
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:39,140
in the wake of yet another Scott gate?

270
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:39,980
Well, no, no, no.

271
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:42,940
Yes, this is one of the many Scott gates on the show.

272
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:44,580
But I think that what happened was,

273
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:47,180
and I kind of remember it was a remote episode

274
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:49,300
a year, maybe a year ago.

275
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:51,020
And I think both Jason and I initially,

276
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:53,700
without having seen any comments or feeling a vibe,

277
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:57,300
both were very excited by the prospect of doing Club Cool.

278
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,140
So I don't think-

279
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:59,780
I think it was less like, you don't know Club Cool.

280
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:01,740
On our end, it was more like, Club Cool.

281
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:03,700
Well, I appreciate it.

282
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,780
The vibe was great on your end.

283
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:09,380
So thank you, my friends.

284
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:11,700
This was not a set sir incident.

285
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:12,780
This is not one of those.

286
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:15,460
This was like, I do think as a kid,

287
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:17,580
I was very excited to do this.

288
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:18,860
And I think a lot of kids,

289
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,140
then maybe I'm getting too,

290
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:23,660
I'm analyzing too much too early.

291
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:26,260
But I think as a kid,

292
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:30,020
the idea of going and getting unlimited soda

293
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:32,300
is loom so large.

294
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,860
Yeah, I hadn't thought of that.

295
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:36,900
Yeah, that's exactly right.

296
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:39,260
Like the idea of even being like a 12 year old,

297
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:41,100
13, whenever I was allowed to go to seven,

298
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,780
like inside a 7-Eleven alone.

299
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:46,820
Oh, and have free rent where you are not,

300
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:50,580
it might be tough to even remember this in the COVID age.

301
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:54,180
You're just let loose with eight different streams.

302
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,540
And if you're a thirsty boy,

303
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:59,580
What size do you want?

304
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:01,340
Mom only lets you get the medium.

305
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:02,820
But you know, if you're alone,

306
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:05,980
you can get the extra large or you can get the whatever,

307
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:08,980
whatever they call it now, big gulp, ultra gulp.

308
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:13,260
So like all, like I do think I like fetishized

309
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:15,500
the soda machine or whatever.

310
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:19,420
Like I definitely like it turned into this like awesome thing.

311
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:21,420
And then I only got a little bit of it sometimes.

312
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:22,300
It's a place that it's something

313
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:25,620
that you had some choice in, some free will.

314
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:26,460
Finally.

315
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:27,420
Is everything else in your life

316
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:28,980
dictated by your mom?

317
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:29,820
Yes.

318
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,380
Lots of rules put in place.

319
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:32,220
Yes.

320
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:33,420
What you can do and listen to.

321
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,260
Exactly.

322
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:37,620
But as long as her back was turned at the soda station.

323
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:39,900
But when you were in club cool,

324
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:41,660
you're in charge.

325
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:42,500
You're in charge.

326
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,740
Well, it's almost educational if you think about it.

327
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:46,460
You're learning about the different countries

328
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:47,300
and their tastes and stuff.

329
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,140
I have to do this.

330
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:48,980
I have to learn.

331
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:50,540
Epcot's the educational part.

332
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:52,100
I have to give a brief presentation

333
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,820
that my teacher will forget about

334
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,740
because we came during the school year.

335
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:59,820
You could totally get away with a book report type thing.

336
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:00,660
Oh yeah.

337
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:01,860
Yeah.

338
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:04,180
You could knock it out in half a day,

339
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:06,660
just talking about a couple of Epcot attractions.

340
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:07,700
Even now.

341
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:08,540
Yeah.

342
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:09,380
You could swing that.

343
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:10,220
I think so.

344
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:12,340
Yeah, there's still enough little bits of education

345
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:13,220
here and there.

346
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:14,980
Maybe even in club cool.

347
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:16,540
I mean, that's what we're essentially doing

348
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:18,140
a little book report about club cool.

349
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:18,980
That's right.

350
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:19,820
Yes.

351
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:20,660
I found some things that I found interesting.

352
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:23,100
So I guess I have to thank everyone for yelling at me

353
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,860
about club cool.

354
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:27,140
I don't even remember how much yelling there was about.

355
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,180
I don't know if it was that bad.

356
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:30,540
Well, here's what I do know

357
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:33,100
is that there was a little bit of that maybe on club cool.

358
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,380
I also maybe amplify.

359
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:37,980
I saw one thing and it turns into 20 things in my mind.

360
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:40,980
But more recently than that,

361
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:43,260
I felt the need to take the time to say that there,

362
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:45,540
and we'll kind of save the discussion of this,

363
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:47,340
but let me get it out now.

364
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:49,980
In a notorious part of club cool

365
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:51,380
is that you try all of these sodas

366
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:54,580
and there is one soda that is a very bad soda

367
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:56,140
or very bitter and you spit it out

368
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:58,100
and maybe it's a little prank that you play on people.

369
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:59,460
This does not taste good.

370
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:01,940
And it is called Beverly.

371
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:04,980
This was new information to me recently.

372
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:05,820
Oh, right, right.

373
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:08,740
I felt the need to say Beverly is the name of the soda

374
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:11,180
that tastes bad at Epcot's club cool.

375
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:14,900
There were people who were mad that I would even do that.

376
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,340
Someone wrote me on Twitter

377
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:18,180
and was so fucking mean about it.

378
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:19,020
Really?

379
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:19,860
Yes.

380
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:20,700
Somebody added me like,

381
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:23,140
you think we don't know.

382
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:26,660
As if like, why don't you explain what Jurassic Park is?

383
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:27,500
How about that?

384
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,100
That obscure art film.

385
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,180
Lindsay was mad at me during,

386
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:32,180
that's when it came up.

387
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:35,860
Lindsay said, you think people don't know what Beverly is?

388
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:39,180
Okay, I don't, look, I didn't know what Beverly may,

389
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:40,260
perhaps, perhaps.

390
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:41,940
Maybe everyone was making a joke.

391
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:42,780
I don't know.

392
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:45,460
But I have, there's just been a lot of emotion

393
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:48,300
coming my way about club cool and,

394
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:50,260
I just don't understand why there's any,

395
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:52,260
why anybody's so amped up.

396
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:53,300
We should be mellow.

397
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,940
This is a fun, keep it cool, everybody.

398
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:57,860
Like mellow yellow, like the flavor of soda mellow yellow.

399
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:58,700
Yeah.

400
00:14:58,700 --> 00:14:59,940
I was interested to learn,

401
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:02,980
I was legitimately surprised.

402
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:05,020
What I didn't know about Beverly is they

403
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:09,380
have not really manufactured it since 2009.

404
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:13,540
Except for these various tasting locations.

405
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:16,420
At Club Cool, at the Atlanta plant,

406
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:19,940
the Vegas Coca-Cola store,

407
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:22,820
the Disney Springs has a Coca-Cola store

408
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:24,180
with a bar on top,

409
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:26,100
and some of these you can get in cocktails,

410
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,340
like the cocktail Beverly's Revenge.

411
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:29,380
Beverly's Revenge.

412
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:33,260
They tried to contextualize it in a better drink,

413
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:36,020
in sort of a gin and tonic kind of situation,

414
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:39,900
which still seems like it's sort of mixed reviews on that.

415
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:40,980
Right.

416
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,540
But I think, yeah, by the way,

417
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:43,740
I just really wanna say, you know,

418
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:45,060
we have to hold that off.

419
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:48,340
We have to hold over to talk about the Coca-Cola store off.

420
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:49,860
Wait, wait, wait, so what was that?

421
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:51,380
Well, it's just, it's a part of a different thing.

422
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:52,740
I'm just saying Coca-Cola stores, you know,

423
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:55,540
I mean, what you guys have said here is fine.

424
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:56,820
The Coca-Cola store at the Vegas

425
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:58,620
has a big animatronic polar bear.

426
00:15:58,620 --> 00:15:59,460
Different story, Jason.

427
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:00,300
It always seems like it's breaking.

428
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,540
Different story.

429
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:02,820
Different episode.

430
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:04,300
Do they have Beverly there?

431
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:07,740
I definitely saw that it's at the Atlanta thing,

432
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:09,860
which people have recommended,

433
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:12,860
when we throw out what are some good episodes we should do,

434
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:14,260
I went and found these,

435
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:15,660
some comments that said,

436
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:17,740
you guys gotta talk about World of Coca-Cola in Atlanta.

437
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:18,820
And again, we'll do it separately.

438
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:19,660
It's a different story.

439
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:20,700
It's a different thing, yeah.

440
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:21,900
World of Coca-Cola in Atlanta,

441
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:24,460
big Coca-Cola exhibit in kind of the, you know,

442
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:25,900
the land of Coca-Cola.

443
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:28,420
There's some kind of movie or presentation

444
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:30,700
called In Search of the Secret Formula,

445
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:32,540
in which you meet a character named

446
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:36,100
Professor Rigby Addison Wet Whistle III.

447
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:36,940
Fantastic, yeah.

448
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:38,620
Because our audience has alerted us to this.

449
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:42,780
So we do clearly need to go in search of the secret formula.

450
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:45,300
But we'll deal with Atlanta later.

451
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:49,740
Yes, but basically, yeah, this soda is now,

452
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:53,740
even though they present it still on the little placard,

453
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:58,740
as it is a popular drink in Italy,

454
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:02,100
it hasn't had the chance to be popular in a very long,

455
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:05,300
because it only exists as a prank soda

456
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,540
in themed environments.

457
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:09,540
It's a prank soda at tourism locations.

458
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:12,820
In Italy, it was a non-alcoholic aperitif,

459
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:15,660
which you're meant to drink before a meal,

460
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,660
because it activates your taste buds

461
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:20,060
and supposedly helps with digestion.

462
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:21,380
Now, let me ask about this,

463
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:22,780
because, and that is the case,

464
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:26,540
that the idea is before a meal as opposed to after a meal.

465
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:28,700
Right, it's not a palate cleanser?

466
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,380
Because like sometimes there's things, you know.

467
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:31,500
I feel like I've seen it presented as that.

468
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,580
I mean, I think both could work.

469
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:33,820
Both could work, I think.

470
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:35,940
I'm no expert on this, I don't know.

471
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:40,940
I ask partially because my main experience with aperitifs

472
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:47,380
is the restaurant Little Dom's in Los Feliz,

473
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:51,780
where, which is a cool, good restaurant

474
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:52,940
people should go to.

475
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:54,500
I associate it now with it's the place

476
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:58,340
where Donald Glover had lunch with Billy Dee Williams

477
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:00,020
to learn about how to be Lando.

478
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:03,580
But non-celebrities can go there as well.

479
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:05,020
And basically, so I would,

480
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:06,620
and like, now where's the fun of your day?

481
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:09,140
A lot of fun of your day people would go every Monday

482
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:10,900
because they had this deal and we'd get,

483
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,100
it would be very indulgent.

484
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,660
We would drink so much and eat so much.

485
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:16,260
And there's this producer, Sean Boyle.

486
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:17,860
This is really specific for anyone listening

487
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:20,100
who personally knows Sean Boyle.

488
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,700
But he's, you know, kind of a gourmand

489
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:24,260
and kind of a Lord Michael's voice a little bit.

490
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:26,060
And I just remember he'd throw out,

491
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:27,140
there's this thing for nets.

492
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:28,900
Anybody had for net?

493
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,580
I know what for net is,

494
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:34,780
but I think I maybe had it in a cocktail.

495
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:35,620
Uh-huh, that makes sense.

496
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:36,460
Yeah, yeah, sure.

497
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:37,540
But I don't think I ever had it on its own.

498
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:39,220
It's one of the, yeah, it's many there to be made.

499
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:42,260
It's in and of itself kind of not a great taste,

500
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:45,140
which I didn't know until we do these big grand dinners.

501
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:48,100
And then Sean would throw out like,

502
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:49,820
I had a runoff for nuts for the table.

503
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:51,340
And we'd all get them.

504
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:53,020
And then the first time,

505
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:55,260
if you aren't prepared for what that is,

506
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:58,220
for this little shot glass of like bitter syrup,

507
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:00,540
it's real, it's just, it's not my vibe.

508
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:02,380
And we had to start saying,

509
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:04,220
it became at every one of these meals,

510
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:05,060
we're brought up for nuts.

511
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:07,500
And we'd all go, no, no, we don't want this.

512
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,980
And it would be at the end,

513
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:12,460
we're already like so drunk and I don't need another.

514
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:13,980
This is actually going to do the opposite.

515
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:18,460
This might make me throw up and make me feel worse.

516
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:22,460
Cause this isn't, this one is an alcoholic aperitif.

517
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:24,340
So I was no fan of that.

518
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:25,900
And if the idea is that you're supposed to take them

519
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,980
before you eat, that makes more sense to it.

520
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:31,220
Cause why do you take like bitter cough syrup

521
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:33,500
at the end of the meal when you're stuffed?

522
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:36,380
I think I prefer like after dinner,

523
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:38,220
if I'm going to have like a liqueur,

524
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,700
it's like something sweet.

525
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:42,220
Like I like amaretto and coffee.

526
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:43,060
Okay.

527
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:46,380
Or Frangelico, it's a kind of amaretto and coffee.

528
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:51,460
I guess I understand the premise of these things.

529
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:54,780
It just hasn't, I haven't really taken to them,

530
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:58,460
but this is, I guess the thing with Beverly.

531
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:03,540
Cause I dug into Beverly a little bit.

532
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:07,300
And there's this really good blog called

533
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:11,060
Passport to Dreams Old and New

534
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:14,060
that goes like really deep on,

535
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:16,540
they have incredible articles about the contemporary.

536
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:18,420
Yeah, you've been there for stuff.

537
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:21,380
They go really into Beverly and without dragging it out

538
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:22,620
and saying everything, they said,

539
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:25,340
the premise that this blog has is

540
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:28,380
what is served in the theme parks cannot be

541
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:32,780
what Coke actually sold as Beverly in Italy in the 60s.

542
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:35,540
Because from any accounts you can find of that,

543
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:37,700
it wasn't nearly as bad.

544
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:40,420
The, like his ideas, or I don't know who writes this,

545
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:43,980
but they're saying that like, okay,

546
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:48,100
if this is made, not even by regular Coca-Cola anymore,

547
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:50,300
if it only exists as a prank soda.

548
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:54,100
And basically you're like, cause of other aperitifs,

549
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:57,180
you would maybe pre-mix with carbonated water.

550
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:59,780
Like it's made that way in the factory.

551
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:05,740
And this is like carbonated theme park tap water

552
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:10,100
in like kind of a warm environment mixed with this.

553
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:14,060
Basically they're saying that drinking only the Beverly

554
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:17,820
is almost akin to drinking only the Coke sludge

555
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:20,020
and saying, here's Coca-Cola.

556
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:21,580
That's not necessarily right.

557
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:24,580
It's only part of the, part of the mix.

558
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:26,940
So like Beverly would be best put in a cocktail

559
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,900
as they've done with Beverly's revenge.

560
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:30,660
Almost like as if you just drank

561
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:32,940
a spoonful of vanilla extract.

562
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:33,780
Sure.

563
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:37,140
Where it's like the slightest bit can flavor a whole cake.

564
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:37,980
Yeah.

565
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:41,500
But it's so hyper concentrated, it would just be nasty.

566
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:44,060
It's nasty if you tried on its own.

567
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:44,980
Yeah, yeah.

568
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:48,540
I think the idea with, they mentioned Campari

569
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:51,460
and how Campari on its own is kind of weird,

570
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:53,980
a little cough syrupy, but you mix it with stuff

571
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:57,180
and then it transforms and brings flavors out of the,

572
00:21:57,180 --> 00:22:00,420
so I think, so maybe Beverly is getting a raw D,

573
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:05,180
like Beverly is being made a mockery of unfairly.

574
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:06,580
Maybe that's the idea here.

575
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:08,300
It's taken on a life of its own

576
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:11,460
beyond its original intent.

577
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:12,300
Cause even when you have,

578
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:14,940
sometimes if you go to fountain soda,

579
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:17,700
sometimes the mix is way off.

580
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:19,100
In either direction.

581
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:20,020
Sometimes you get, when you go,

582
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:22,980
this is the syrupy as shit and it's awful.

583
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:27,060
So if you were to have a concentration

584
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:31,100
that's not what has been liked by humans,

585
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,820
or I don't know why,

586
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:35,940
I could imagine that easily being unpleasant.

587
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:36,780
Yeah.

588
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:37,580
It doesn't seem like it would be hard

589
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:42,140
just to get the equation wrong and have it be bad.

590
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:42,980
Yeah.

591
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:45,060
I mean, a lot of these sodas evolve over the years.

592
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:47,140
You mentioned Italy in the 50s.

593
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:49,300
That was when they, you know,

594
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:53,660
launched what we think of as the modern version of Fanta.

595
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:57,540
The original Fanta was made with like Italian oranges

596
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:58,900
in Italy.

597
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:01,580
Of course, the original Fanta was made

598
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:06,020
under the Nazi regime in Germany by Coca-Cola, Deutschland,

599
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:08,140
because there was a US embargo

600
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:10,020
before the US entered the war.

601
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:12,180
So it was hard to get ingredients.

602
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:13,380
That's why it exists.

603
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:15,460
We need to make something entirely here

604
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:16,940
where we don't need to bring in any.

605
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:21,620
So they used beet sugar, whey, and apple pommice.

606
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:23,980
I don't know what the hell pommice is.

607
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:26,620
So pommice, I looked this up just to be sure.

608
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:30,140
When you like juice grapes for juice or wine,

609
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:32,660
or you juice apples for cider or juice,

610
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:36,700
the goo that's left, the mush that's left, that's pommice.

611
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:39,060
It's not the juice, it's the like,

612
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:42,500
you know, I guess goo is the best word to describe it.

613
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:47,500
So they, in Germany and I, is it in Amsterdam,

614
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:52,260
were both, they couldn't get the, you know,

615
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:53,660
Coke syrup from America.

616
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:55,380
They couldn't get the Coke ingredients from America.

617
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:57,460
So they made Fanta.

618
00:23:57,460 --> 00:24:01,100
That was how Fanta was introduced under the Nazi regime.

619
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:05,140
All of this stuff, I'm guessing,

620
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:07,660
and maybe I'm wrong and somebody correct me if I am.

621
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:12,060
All of this stuff would have tasted better initially.

622
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:15,980
Because it's all like been replaced by corn syrup

623
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:16,900
and this like shit.

624
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:18,660
Like somebody told me a couple years ago

625
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:21,620
that a lot of cereals I had as a kid,

626
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:26,060
they replaced like ingredients with just corn syrup.

627
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:27,380
And I remember being a kid,

628
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:28,420
and I've said this before, I think,

629
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:30,820
where like I ate like tricks or something one day

630
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:32,700
and I was like, oh, they taste different.

631
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:33,900
Huh, okay.

632
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:35,620
And it's like, oh yeah, they like replaced,

633
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:38,540
they don't do like necessarily whole grains anymore.

634
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:39,860
And I feel like if you went back

635
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:42,860
and had some of the original versions of sodas,

636
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:46,340
they would taste a lot less like crazy sweet

637
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:50,420
and probably have more like natural tasting flavor.

638
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:51,260
Yeah.

639
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:56,260
So when you go out weekly and get a Trix-Tini at CityWalk,

640
00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:01,700
do you have any change in the ingredients of Trix-Tinis?

641
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:04,140
Well, I mean, they've been the same since I was 12, I think.

642
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:07,220
So I haven't noticed recently any difference.

643
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:09,180
By the way, a very good idea if,

644
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:13,620
if Telly's would offer it or something,

645
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:16,220
or maybe I could make it myself probably.

646
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:17,740
I could infuse it, but.

647
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:19,620
Yeah, I might've picked the wrong base.

648
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:20,940
I don't know what liquor,

649
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:23,060
if anyone's experimented at home and you know a liquor

650
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:26,740
that goes best with Trix, with ground up Trix,

651
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:29,060
with mixed, which, and then you rim the glass

652
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:31,660
with a couple of them, like for, you know, for decoration.

653
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:32,500
Oh yeah, yeah.

654
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,460
And so you get that one bite.

655
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:35,820
I would, yeah, I would like that

656
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:39,060
or a fruity pebbles based drink.

657
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:40,140
Is there not that?

658
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:40,980
There's gotta be that.

659
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:41,820
There's gotta be, right?

660
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:42,640
Somewhere, right?

661
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,480
Yeah.

662
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,320
Somebody has to have made that.

663
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,620
I feel like it's almost getting a little,

664
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:47,740
like some places make the crazy milkshakes

665
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:50,420
or they put a little whipped cream on a dessert

666
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:52,220
and sprinkle some fruity pebbles on top.

667
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:55,300
We had like funnel cake fries with.

668
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:58,260
Oh, that's true, but I was gonna say at Black Tap,

669
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:00,020
I think one of the milkshake I had

670
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:02,140
had like fruity pebbles like stuck to the glass.

671
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:05,140
It was rimmed, it was like an icing rim.

672
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:07,660
And instead of salt or sugar, it was fruity pebbles.

673
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:08,500
Yeah, yeah.

674
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:13,300
Tipsy bartender.com has a recipe for fruity pebble shots,

675
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:17,140
pink shooters that combine vodka, blue curacao.

676
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:17,980
There it is.

677
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:18,820
Oh my gosh.

678
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:19,640
Milk.

679
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,540
Milk, granadine, whipped cream,

680
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:22,980
and of course some fruity pebbles.

681
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:23,960
Uh huh.

682
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:24,800
Jesus Christ.

683
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,100
That seems a little too much.

684
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:28,340
Too much.

685
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:29,160
Yeah.

686
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,000
No thanks.

687
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,400
I mean, my current soda thing, I don't drink soda a lot.

688
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:36,100
That was like when I was in high school.

689
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:38,100
Soda wasn't like when I was growing up,

690
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:39,740
soda was a treat for a little while.

691
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:42,700
And then I think it became so ubiquitous

692
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:44,700
with like combo meals at fast food.

693
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:47,700
And then like family restaurants just gave you soda,

694
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,500
like unlimited soda.

695
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:52,500
And it was just like, there was one summer in high school

696
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,580
where I was like, all right, I'm gonna exercise more

697
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:57,380
and I'm gonna switch from drinking soda to water.

698
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:59,580
And I dropped weight immediately

699
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:01,580
from just cutting soda from my diet.

700
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:05,660
And then in my 20s, like production company offices

701
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:08,180
where I would PA, there was always piles and piles

702
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:09,020
of Diet Coke.

703
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:11,740
Like the city runs on coffee and Diet Coke.

704
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:13,380
The whole entertainment industry runs on Diet Coke.

705
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:16,980
As did the nation from 2016 to 2020.

706
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:19,100
They had a Diet Coke fueled president.

707
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:19,940
Well there was a button.

708
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:21,980
There was a button on the desk.

709
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:23,900
He did hit that button a lot.

710
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:24,740
That's true.

711
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:25,760
Well he didn't hit the other button.

712
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:29,920
I was never super crazy about diet sodas,

713
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:34,440
but the zero sugar sodas, they have hooked me.

714
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:37,280
A Coke Zero, Dr. Pepper Zero,

715
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:40,400
and Baja, Mountain Dew Baja Blast Zero.

716
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,320
That is my blue drink of choice.

717
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,600
Oh my gosh.

718
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:47,400
I don't have a ton of soda anymore,

719
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,200
but I will say I was feeling a little sleepy

720
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,640
and I had to play a tennis match recently.

721
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:56,320
I stopped into a gas station and I got a Coke Zero cherry.

722
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,440
And boy was that delicious.

723
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,560
It's really good.

724
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:01,480
I was on cloud nine.

725
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,800
I was so, I was like, oh my,

726
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:03,800
because I always as a kid,

727
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:06,120
Cherry Coke was like my favorite thing ever.

728
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:09,920
And somebody, they're doing retro Cherry Coke clothing

729
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:12,360
at the Coke store in Disney Springs.

730
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:14,960
And I got so excited because every Cherry Coke logo

731
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:15,840
is a masterpiece.

732
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,280
It's like black and purple.

733
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,800
Yeah, you know what I'm saying?

734
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:19,640
I get you.

735
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,480
You remember the old?

736
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,300
I remember the logo, yeah.

737
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:22,140
I'm so excited.

738
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:25,360
Even like the, even the like extreme version in the 90s.

739
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,080
I still have so much affection for that Cherry Coke.

740
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,280
I really liked it.

741
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,120
Yeah, Cherry Coke logo.

742
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,280
And every movie theater had it.

743
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,320
I went to the movie.

744
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:35,800
I saw Spider-Man, you know, back in December,

745
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,800
I was like, I'm going to get a Cherry Coke.

746
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:41,160
Discovered that that Regal had switched over to Pepsi

747
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:44,160
and didn't even have any Cherry Pepsi, which is fine,

748
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,920
but it's not really ideal.

749
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:48,320
Yeah. Well, you know, left the movie.

750
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,160
Yeah.

751
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,000
Throw it at the screen.

752
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,600
I was like, what has happened to our country?

753
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:54,880
Woke mob.

754
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,480
Joe Brandon, what have you done?

755
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,920
Regal cinema says Pepsi now?

756
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:00,760
What?

757
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,280
I did this little sticker of Joe.

758
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,120
Oh man.

759
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:04,940
I saw that.

760
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:07,240
I saw an, I did this on a toilet recently,

761
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:10,400
like at a grocery store, like a Trader Joe's toilet.

762
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,080
I'm like, what are you doing?

763
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,920
Joe Brandon messed up the Trader Joe's toilet.

764
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:15,960
I guess.

765
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,520
I'd be proud.

766
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:21,760
I don't, if there's any bowel movements going on

767
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,680
with Joe Brandon, I'd be impressed.

768
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,020
I'd applaud him.

769
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:26,200
Scott, can you see these or no?

770
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,040
That's too far.

771
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:27,860
Yeah, yeah.

772
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:29,560
There's some Cherry Coke, Cherry Coke logo.

773
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,400
Sure.

774
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:31,800
I love this shit.

775
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:32,640
Oh, the extreme-ish one.

776
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,480
Oh, the 90s.

777
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,320
I see what you're saying.

778
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

779
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:37,000
I love that garbage too.

780
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,120
It's like a 2002 No Doubt album cover.

781
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,320
Right.

782
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,160
Yes.

783
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,240
It doesn't look like that now.

784
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:45,240
Even that, I like the Cherry Coke.

785
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,240
But I did have a Zero recently.

786
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,840
I'm not a Mountain Dew guy though.

787
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,200
But I guess I would try it.

788
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,880
I was not in a test market either.

789
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:56,100
Do you guys remember OK Soda?

790
00:29:56,100 --> 00:30:00,280
It had the Dan Clout, like the Gen X ass logo.

791
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,000
It had the Dan Clout's art on it.

792
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,680
Oh, Clout's art on a soda?

793
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:08,160
This was like the 90s, like Coke's attempt, I believe.

794
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:10,640
The 90s, like slacker Gen X.

795
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,920
Oh, wow, no, I've never seen this before.

796
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,760
That's weird, what they have to do there.

797
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:15,600
That is weird.

798
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,420
Yeah.

799
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:17,260
Wow, and you had that?

800
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:18,100
No, I didn't.

801
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:20,640
I remember seeing the art when I was young

802
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,800
and then it just comes up every now and then

803
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:26,720
on those listicles of like, remember these foods?

804
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,560
Yeah.

805
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:30,040
I, yeah, I'm trying to think.

806
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,280
When I was a kid, I've said,

807
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,760
sure, I've said this before, playing soccer

808
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:36,020
when I was like in kindergarten,

809
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:37,600
I could have given a shit about.

810
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:42,600
But after the game, you got a hot dog and a can of soda.

811
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:45,960
This is my baseball, we got fountain soda.

812
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:48,080
They usually got a hot dog or a slice of pizza

813
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,640
and just around the seventh inning, I was like,

814
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,920
oh, I really gotta get out of this outfield

815
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,160
and at that snack bar.

816
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,080
And what would happen is, yeah, what happened is

817
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:58,880
a parent had, like one parent had like a little like

818
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:01,640
tray of hot dogs and one parent had a tray of the soda

819
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,520
and they had a lot of different sodas.

820
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:04,640
It was not all the same.

821
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,480
Like a club cool.

822
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,480
So on the go.

823
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,040
The only time I would run very fast

824
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:11,760
is when the game was over because I knew

825
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:14,720
to get the cherry Coke or to get the grape soda,

826
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:18,520
you had to be first because kids would take those.

827
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:19,360
Yeah.

828
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,200
So I would sprint,

829
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,440
cause like depending on where you were

830
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:24,120
at the end of the game, you would have an advantage.

831
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:26,640
Oh, if that's, if it's out in the dugout

832
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,400
and you're in deep right field.

833
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,760
Well, this soccer that was, that was baseball.

834
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:31,600
Oh, I'm sorry.

835
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,440
Okay.

836
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,260
Okay.

837
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:34,100
Yeah.

838
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:34,920
I'm sure we had, we think we had a similar thing

839
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:35,840
with baseball, but soccer is the memory I have.

840
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,920
So I would, if I knew how much left time was left

841
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,680
in the game, I think I would kind of try to position

842
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:44,240
myself ahead of the game to be able to run,

843
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:47,240
to get the cherry Coke or the grape soda.

844
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,920
You're only at the end or half point or,

845
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,240
or I would take orange too.

846
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,040
I liked orange soda a lot as well,

847
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,440
but the grape and the cherry Coke

848
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:56,360
were the very desirable ones.

849
00:31:56,400 --> 00:32:01,400
So it's like a really mopey perfunctory soccer playing,

850
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,480
tripping over your own legs.

851
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:08,920
And then we get to the end and you sprint like an Olympian.

852
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,400
I turn into Pele.

853
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:14,760
I'm a little Pele and I'm running as fast as possible,

854
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:17,080
checking kids out of the way.

855
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:17,920
And then like,

856
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,800
What happened to Mike?

857
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:21,040
There's only this Mike shaped cloud

858
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,240
that was left in his wake.

859
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,080
Yes.

860
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:25,840
That was, my parents, I think noted this too,

861
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:29,560
that I appeared to move faster at the end of the game

862
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:31,920
than I did during the game.

863
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:34,360
Except for the time when my dad said, if you score,

864
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:36,560
cause I was being placed in offense, I think,

865
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:39,600
because my dad like negotiated with the coach.

866
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,960
And he said, if you score a goal, I'll buy you a toy.

867
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,000
And I scored a goal within fucking minutes,

868
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,240
a couple of minutes.

869
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,200
See, yeah, I had a similar thing too,

870
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,800
where it's like, if we had a Saturday morning game

871
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:52,320
or Friday, like usually Saturday morning game,

872
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,960
you're finished by like noon or one or whatever.

873
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,120
And so I'd be like, well,

874
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,600
does anyone need to run to the supermarket or the mall?

875
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,240
Like just suggesting places

876
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:04,480
where I knew there was a comic store close by.

877
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:07,480
Like, I don't know why I didn't just come out and say like,

878
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,320
Hey, we're out.

879
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,360
Can we go buy a comic book store?

880
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,080
Lenscrafters is in close proximity.

881
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,360
If anyone needs to get their prescription check.

882
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:18,520
Every two years we need to do lenses.

883
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,080
Yeah.

884
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:23,480
So I, and then as I got older,

885
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,880
I was like, there was one or two years

886
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:29,280
where I was doing like school plays and playing baseball.

887
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:32,240
And I was joking about this with my dad recently,

888
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,760
where it's like one coach was like,

889
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:36,520
you know, you're missing some practices

890
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:37,520
with the school play ground.

891
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:39,080
You're gonna have to make a decision soon.

892
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:41,120
And like the next year was like,

893
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,840
yeah, I know what I'm deciding.

894
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:45,080
Yeah, I'm going to the play.

895
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:48,680
I spend more time on stage than I do on the field.

896
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:52,440
So I think this is wherever the action is for me.

897
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,840
Did you play sports when you were little?

898
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:56,680
A little bit.

899
00:33:56,680 --> 00:34:01,240
I made it up to, I did coach pitch baseball.

900
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,080
Okay.

901
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,120
So I first grade.

902
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:06,720
A little bit like second or third.

903
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:10,080
And then yeah, once there was an opposing team

904
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:12,760
throwing the ball, I checked out of that

905
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:15,240
when it was not a friend on the other side

906
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:16,440
of the pitching mound.

907
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:18,880
See, we had an in between that

908
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:21,040
before the other kids started pitching,

909
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,560
there were machines.

910
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:23,680
Yes, we did that too.

911
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:27,160
Yeah, the coaches feeding balls into the machine,

912
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:31,520
I think was more reliable than just like

913
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:34,080
nine year olds throwing wild pitches.

914
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,400
Like it would have just been chaos

915
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,880
if they had nine or 10 year olds throwing.

916
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:39,920
I did a year of whatever that was, second or third grade.

917
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,560
I did a year of kids pitching

918
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:43,880
and then I was out of baseball.

919
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:44,720
Yeah.

920
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:46,040
I retired from, I did the whole speech

921
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:48,320
with my cat over my heart.

922
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,360
You consider yourself the luckiest.

923
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,200
The luckiest second grader.

924
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:55,760
He's like, is he dying?

925
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,600
He must be dying.

926
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,000
He's got Mike Carlson's disease.

927
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:58,840
Yeah.

928
00:34:58,840 --> 00:34:59,880
He's just a coward.

929
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:01,200
Plus my priority shifted.

930
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,120
I was like, mom, dad, I gotta be home

931
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,840
to watch the Simpsons and Seinfeld

932
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,320
if I'm gonna have anything to talk about

933
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,920
at school the next day.

934
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:12,600
This is what nerdy too smart for their own kids do

935
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,440
in seventh grade.

936
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,280
Too smart for their own kids.

937
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,840
Too smart for their own good.

938
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,080
You had kids when you were a kid.

939
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:21,280
I mean, they shouldn't have kids, you know.

940
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:26,120
Well, should we talk about some of these other,

941
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:29,080
and we've established the place

942
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:32,160
and describe what Beverly is?

943
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,080
Sorry.

944
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:35,800
Now let's get into Jason,

945
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,680
some of the tastes that you got to test.

946
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,240
Yeah, let's do that.

947
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:43,280
I do wanna go back and talk about the

948
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,120
Oh, by all means.

949
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:44,960
World of Ice Station Cool.

950
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:45,800
Yes, absolutely.

951
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,360
But a recent check-in.

952
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:50,680
So yeah, like I said,

953
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:55,160
me, my dad, or me, my brother, and Jane went

954
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:57,600
and tried the sodas.

955
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,280
I'll say off the gate,

956
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,760
our favorite, out the gate, our favorites,

957
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:05,000
Bon Bon Englaise from Madagascar,

958
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:09,640
and Country Club Meringue from the Dominican Republic.

959
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:10,480
Delicious.

960
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,840
Not like Meringue?

961
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,400
Probably Meringue, not Meringue.

962
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,240
It wasn't a Meringue soda.

963
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,440
Is that Meringue?

964
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,280
That makes more sense.

965
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:18,320
Because it's Dominican Republic and that's the music.

966
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,520
Okay, that makes a lot more sense.

967
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,200
But that is how Meringue is spelled.

968
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:26,320
It says it on the thing, how to pronounce it, Meringue.

969
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,400
Oh, so it does.

970
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:30,800
It's a bit in front of you, but.

971
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,160
This guy was being nice and I was being an asshole.

972
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:36,680
Sometimes there's other sweetness.

973
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:39,520
Some of these are so sweet or just have

974
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,480
a different clarifier.

975
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,840
Those are your favorites, they're sweeter.

976
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,800
Would you go out of your,

977
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:53,040
did you like this taste test and the results so much

978
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,120
that if these were available to you,

979
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:58,400
or at a store slightly out of your way,

980
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:01,360
would you be hitting up this Madagascar

981
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,800
and Dominican Republic soda?

982
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,400
Yeah, these two I think I would.

983
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,200
And I think the one I used to like

984
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,640
that they don't have anymore was Bebo.

985
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,880
I think that one was pretty good.

986
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,720
The Sprite.

987
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,040
South African drink, it looks like?

988
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,400
I think that was from, yeah,

989
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,560
then 80s or 90s South Africa.

990
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:24,320
Oh, they had characters apparently.

991
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:28,920
Johnny Orange, Taka Strawberry, and Paolo Peach.

992
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:33,800
Well, I haven't seen them, but I love Paolo Peach.

993
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:34,920
Yeah, that's great.

994
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:38,560
Yes, any mascot I haven't heard of, it's an instant love.

995
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,920
I can't find a photo of them.

996
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,720
How do we know these characters exist?

997
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:45,520
If somebody knows how to see Paolo Peach, let us know.

998
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:49,080
I think the other one, less sweet,

999
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:54,080
I think a little drier was the Sprite Cucumber from Russia.

1000
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,640
Now who knows if they've yanked it.

1001
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:00,640
We've got to do our freedom fries part.

1002
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,600
Get Russian cats out of competitions,

1003
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:04,800
get that soda out of Disney World.

1004
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,680
Yeah, this is one of those where I don't think

1005
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:08,680
anyone is even paying attention.

1006
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:10,600
They're not paying attention

1007
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,800
to the marching band's lead screen.

1008
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,640
They're not paying attention to sodas either.

1009
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:16,480
No.

1010
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,300
Oh, right.

1011
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:18,140
Or whatever that was.

1012
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:21,520
They're not paying attention to the show

1013
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:25,480
about socially progressive youths

1014
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:29,840
doing a scene at a homeless sweep protest.

1015
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:30,680
What are you talking about?

1016
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:31,500
What is this?

1017
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:34,680
Oh, there's this free form show called Good Trouble.

1018
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:36,080
Oh, I've heard of the show.

1019
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:40,680
They swept a homeless encampment in Los Angeles.

1020
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,160
That's where the police come in.

1021
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:44,880
To shoot there and what they were filming

1022
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:48,200
was a scene of a protest about homeless sweeps.

1023
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,040
Really?

1024
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:49,860
Yeah.

1025
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:51,200
Oh, I didn't see this.

1026
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,800
Yeah, extremely grim stuff.

1027
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,680
Bad, bad, a couple months for the company.

1028
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:56,920
So the Russian Sprite is not on their radar

1029
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:57,760
is really what we're saying.

1030
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,800
I don't think so, but it was pretty good.

1031
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,040
But they're still selling,

1032
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,400
the Russian Sprite's still available,

1033
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,760
it's not free anymore.

1034
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:07,000
It's now $6.99 a gallon.

1035
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:11,520
Will Brandon is letting the price of Russian Sprite,

1036
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,640
cucumber go through the roof.

1037
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:15,600
Will has JPEG though,

1038
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,640
as it come across his desk,

1039
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:20,240
he started charging per sip for.

1040
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,480
For all the club cool.

1041
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:22,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1042
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,920
We're giving, do you know how much soda

1043
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,440
we're apparently giving away at Epcot?

1044
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:28,320
Apparently there's this free thing.

1045
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:32,160
This, I was just informed of this free soda place.

1046
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,680
Somebody said it was a big deal.

1047
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,000
I'd say they're wrong.

1048
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,840
See, he wants to, when you go into Club Cool,

1049
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:40,240
he's gonna have them put a magic band on your neck

1050
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:42,640
and it's gonna measure how many sips you take

1051
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:46,600
and then it'll charge you immediately to your app.

1052
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:50,400
Oh, like it's one of those fill your own beer kind of places.

1053
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:53,160
Well, no, it's like Mickey dog collar that you're wearing

1054
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:55,720
that can measure how many sips you've taken

1055
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:58,360
and then you can charge, get charged on the way out.

1056
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:01,440
It's a hands-free tab.

1057
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,280
Yeah.

1058
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,120
You're putting them all in your tab,

1059
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:04,680
it's scanning you at each, yeah.

1060
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:07,680
And then, all right, that'll be $17.98.

1061
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,520
Right.

1062
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:10,080
So I only had Beverly.

1063
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,760
Yes, that's what it costs now.

1064
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:12,680
Yes, we know.

1065
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:16,240
Beverly kind of has a prime spot in the new,

1066
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:19,840
right on the end, right on the end where you can see it

1067
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:22,320
in some of the earlier soda fountains is like,

1068
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,600
it was kind of in the middle where if you weren't looking

1069
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:27,760
or thinking, you might accidentally in between like,

1070
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:30,200
oh, watermelon soda or raspberry soda.

1071
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:32,400
No, Beverly is off on its own.

1072
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,560
All the way on the side.

1073
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:35,880
Well, and this is interesting that they have,

1074
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:39,960
several times they have replaced the entire lineup

1075
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:43,440
of the sodas and this facility stopped existing

1076
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,760
and moved entirely and yet the one,

1077
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,760
the constant is Beverly.

1078
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:50,280
They've kept Beverly going despite it not being

1079
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:52,120
a real mass produced drink.

1080
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:53,600
It'll never leave.

1081
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:54,440
Yeah, yeah.

1082
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:56,240
Which I get, you know, now I'm glad I've been educated

1083
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,160
about this now.

1084
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:59,720
It is kind of fascinating that this is a,

1085
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:03,440
it does actually feel like Epcot and the Disney parks

1086
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,480
paying attention to an important detail.

1087
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:08,520
You could see them missing the cult of Beverly

1088
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:09,720
that seems to exist.

1089
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:10,640
Yes.

1090
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,840
But they've kept this detail alive.

1091
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:15,840
Well, they want, yeah, it's like preserving

1092
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:18,360
one of their like dark rides or something that, you know,

1093
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,600
it's not always happening.

1094
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,560
You know, they're not always keeping things around

1095
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:24,200
just for tradition's sake, except for it's good to see

1096
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:27,360
one thing in Epcot is sticking around

1097
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:29,200
in the way that people remember and love it.

1098
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,960
One bit of Epcot being kept weird.

1099
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:31,800
Right.

1100
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:34,160
Now I do need to direct your attention

1101
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:38,360
to what I think I've seen some people refer to

1102
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:41,240
in the same breath as Beverly in the current lineup.

1103
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:42,080
Yeah.

1104
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:44,320
And that is Smart Sour Plum.

1105
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,160
Oh.

1106
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:49,000
Smart is a line of soft drinks in China

1107
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:53,880
and sour plum tea is listed as a traditional Chinese beverage.

1108
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:56,080
So this is a soft drink version of that.

1109
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:59,240
This drink to an American palette,

1110
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:01,960
I would say is pretty unpleasant.

1111
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:02,800
Okay.

1112
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:06,080
And that it tastes like barbecue sauce.

1113
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:06,920
Wow.

1114
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:09,840
It is listed as like having a savory flavor

1115
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:11,920
and that it is.

1116
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:15,520
It is pretty overwhelming.

1117
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:16,360
Okay.

1118
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:17,200
And they have that now?

1119
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:20,480
Yeah, it's like the, in the picture I sent you,

1120
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:24,080
it's like the third one in on the right.

1121
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:24,920
Oh, okay.

1122
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:25,760
I see it now.

1123
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:26,580
Sorry.

1124
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:27,420
And yes.

1125
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:28,260
That sounds weird.

1126
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:29,200
That sounds very odd.

1127
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,040
Yeah.

1128
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:32,800
That is probably the most like of the new crop

1129
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,480
or like the current crop of sodas.

1130
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:35,320
I mean.

1131
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:37,440
There's the potential to dethrone.

1132
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,480
Like if anything was gonna take the Beverly spot

1133
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:40,880
of the gross soda.

1134
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:41,720
Yeah.

1135
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:44,480
The Sweet Sour, Smart Sour Plum is on the rise.

1136
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,280
Is that new or do you know?

1137
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:47,120
I should really look and see.

1138
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:48,240
It's new in the new lineup.

1139
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:49,640
It's new in the new lineup.

1140
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:53,640
I think Smart is a newer line of like,

1141
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:56,080
I mean, it's so wild as you go through

1142
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:58,200
and you read all these different generations of soda.

1143
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:01,880
Some of these are like only dating back to like the,

1144
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:04,280
the eighties or nineties and stuff.

1145
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:08,120
And there's one, the weirdest one that I forgot about.

1146
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:11,640
I did know about this Mezzo mix in Germany,

1147
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:13,320
not on the current lineup.

1148
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:16,720
And it's kind of cola and orange.

1149
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:19,680
And the description says Germans often mix their beer

1150
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,240
with non-alcoholic beverages.

1151
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:23,680
I was like, they do?

1152
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:26,040
And then I started reading, I was like looking it up

1153
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:27,360
and yeah, they do.

1154
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:29,480
And it's different cocktails.

1155
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:31,760
I think in America, we know the Shandy,

1156
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:33,320
that's lemonade and beer.

1157
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:34,160
Okay, yeah.

1158
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:35,920
But then there's also a Radler,

1159
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:37,440
which is a phrase I had heard before,

1160
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:41,240
which is often a beer and lemon lime soda.

1161
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:42,080
Okay.

1162
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:47,080
And then there's cola beer, which is beer and cola.

1163
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:50,320
And I think it's usually more beer than cola

1164
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:51,960
because it'll be way too sweet.

1165
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:55,520
I think the idea being you can drink a lot more beer

1166
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:59,200
cocktails than you could just mugs of beer.

1167
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:00,040
Okay.

1168
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:01,720
So if you want to stay out and continue drinking,

1169
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:04,360
you cut it with like something else.

1170
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:07,080
Yeah, at some point you might hit that fill of beer.

1171
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:08,640
None of that sounds good to me.

1172
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,880
And by the way, I've never done any of these beer cocktails

1173
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:13,720
at the Ant Man bar.

1174
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:14,640
Has anybody done one of them?

1175
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:15,480
Oh, we did.

1176
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:17,320
Yeah, the first day I think I did.

1177
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:18,160
That's what I did.

1178
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:20,160
But then when I realized I accidentally ordered

1179
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:21,200
an ice cream float.

1180
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:23,360
What?

1181
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:25,560
Remember I was not sure what I was drinking

1182
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:26,680
and I was like, what did I get?

1183
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:29,280
And then I was like, oh, this is a big scoop ice cream beer.

1184
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:31,680
Oh, accidentally.

1185
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:32,520
Wow.

1186
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:34,640
You keep accidentally ordering these milkshakes.

1187
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:36,080
I swear it was an accident.

1188
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:40,040
You didn't again say, this is the best drink I've ever had.

1189
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:41,080
Like the, yeah.

1190
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:42,120
Or was it marshmallow?

1191
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:43,240
Was it a big marshmallow?

1192
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:44,080
Was that what it was?

1193
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:44,920
It was something like that.

1194
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:47,080
It was the ice cream or big, let me find a picture of it.

1195
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:49,880
I had the one that was like had Boba Pearls

1196
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:52,360
and it was the Golden Road mango cart,

1197
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:55,920
which is a very sweet, kind of pleasant summery beer.

1198
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:58,200
And then I think maybe there was a shot of vodka.

1199
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:00,920
There was a float of some sort of liquor in it.

1200
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:01,920
It was pretty pleasant.

1201
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:04,320
I thought it was pretty refreshing.

1202
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:05,160
It didn't,

1203
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:10,800
Boba and beer, like in a souvenir glass

1204
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:13,320
is kind of a pain in the ass.

1205
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:14,160
Yeah, yeah.

1206
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:17,080
You're like, oh, I gotta scoop out these Boba Pearls

1207
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:20,240
and then I gotta rinse this glass out somewhere.

1208
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:21,920
I don't think I get,

1209
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:24,520
there was a period where I was sort of understood Boba

1210
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:25,520
and now I'm not so sure.

1211
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:29,040
I just yesterday, I saw a license plate holder

1212
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:31,160
that said addicted to Boba.

1213
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:33,000
And I was like, wow.

1214
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,280
Are you also addicted to stomach aches?

1215
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:38,040
I love it in milk tea, like a Thai iced tea

1216
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:40,400
or different milk teas and stuff.

1217
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:42,200
When we were doing the Carly episode,

1218
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:44,080
I stopped just like,

1219
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:47,440
and had a Thai iced tea.

1220
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:48,920
And they're like, do you want Boba?

1221
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:50,600
And I was like, oh, I could go for some Boba.

1222
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:53,280
And I was like, oh, I probably shouldn't be munching Boba

1223
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:54,640
as I talk into a microphone.

1224
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:57,120
No, no, no, the audience loves,

1225
00:45:57,120 --> 00:46:00,680
the audience loves as much sound up on that mic.

1226
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,760
I ordered the molecular meltdown,

1227
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:06,200
which is a garage marshmallow milk stout

1228
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:09,040
with vanilla ice cream and miniature marshmallows.

1229
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:09,880
Milk stout?

1230
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:11,600
So is there alcohol in that?

1231
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:12,880
Yeah, stout, yeah.

1232
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:13,720
That stout implies?

1233
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:15,960
Stout is like a, yeah, like Guinness or something.

1234
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:16,800
Okay.

1235
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:19,760
Guinness is, yeah, Guinness is already a thick,

1236
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:22,680
I don't know, that was good, but it was a little deserty.

1237
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:23,520
You can do a lot.

1238
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,960
I think stouts are usually like,

1239
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:28,120
you can put chocolatey flavors

1240
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:29,920
or like a scoop of vanilla ice cream

1241
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:31,600
and make like a Guinness float or something.

1242
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:32,440
Yeah.

1243
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:35,920
What else in terms of,

1244
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:38,680
what else in your recent Club Cool findings?

1245
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:43,040
Yeah, I mean, I thought the rest were okay.

1246
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:48,040
I think the Royal watermelon from the Philippines was good.

1247
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:52,520
The Viva raspberry from Moldova,

1248
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:54,840
I think was probably the sweetest

1249
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:56,680
if I'm remembering correctly.

1250
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:57,840
Okay.

1251
00:46:57,840 --> 00:47:00,760
Yeah, I like the tropical.

1252
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:02,560
I think the tropical sodas are good.

1253
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:05,360
Like I'll get a Fanta pineapple every now and then.

1254
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:06,200
Sure.

1255
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:10,000
If I see it or like Doritos,

1256
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,200
we can get those a lot of Mexican restaurants out here.

1257
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:13,360
I like those.

1258
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:17,080
I just, I like my sugary sweets.

1259
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:22,080
I just, I'm very conscious of not taking sugar in drinks.

1260
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:29,760
Not like drinking sugar without thinking.

1261
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:30,600
Sure.

1262
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:32,160
So I can have my sugary treats.

1263
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:34,000
So that you, yes, okay, okay.

1264
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,280
Because then you feel like the drink counteracts.

1265
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:38,960
Like that is, you just did your dessert as a beverage

1266
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:41,800
and then you don't get to have your milk and cookies at home.

1267
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:44,320
It's hard when you just want like a granola bar

1268
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:46,560
or a Clif bar or something like that.

1269
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:48,960
At least if that's like, oh, I just need something.

1270
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:50,720
I need a quick breakfast or something.

1271
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:53,240
So much of those have so much sugar in it.

1272
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:56,000
And then I find myself just drinking a lot of water

1273
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:58,320
to counteract that.

1274
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:00,920
But even my coffee, I usually just take with like cream

1275
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:02,440
or almond milk or something like that.

1276
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:04,640
I'm pretty light on those.

1277
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:08,360
Wait, so now did you do Beverly during this expedition?

1278
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:09,720
Have you, do you,

1279
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:12,200
do we know how Beverly is tasting these days?

1280
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:14,640
I mean, it's still pretty shocking.

1281
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:15,800
It's still pretty unpleasant.

1282
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:20,800
I think there's a Mr. Morrow video where he mixes Beverly

1283
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:23,720
with the Smart Sour Plum.

1284
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:26,080
And it's just like a very shocking.

1285
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:28,000
It's a wild, a wild episode.

1286
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:29,960
He does that a lot.

1287
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:30,960
I noticed he was doing that.

1288
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:32,760
There was an episode where he went to Gideon's

1289
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:34,880
and he mixed like the banana coffee

1290
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:36,200
with the peanut butter coffee.

1291
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:38,600
And he was making, so he's making his own mashups

1292
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:39,440
as far as liquid.

1293
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:41,480
Yeah, he's really, he's a culinary daredevil.

1294
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:45,840
This is kind of a, he's kind of a food jackass in a way.

1295
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:46,680
Yeah.

1296
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:47,520
He dares to go there.

1297
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:48,360
I think in a lot of ways, yeah,

1298
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:51,560
he is doing outrageous stunts with your food mashups.

1299
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:54,240
Would you guys like to attempt say

1300
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:56,880
an outrageous food stunt of your own?

1301
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:58,160
I would, yes.

1302
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:01,600
Because I went and, you know,

1303
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:04,080
we start thinking about this, doing this episode and like,

1304
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:06,520
well, it'd be great to, I mean, initially I'm like,

1305
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:08,240
I wonder if there's some way to find Beverly.

1306
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:10,200
Then you realize Beverly doesn't exist

1307
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:11,880
besides at these places.

1308
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:13,720
You start looking up other of these sodas

1309
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:16,440
and even at specialty soda stores in our area,

1310
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:18,000
this does not really exist.

1311
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,800
So I'm like, there's gotta be some way

1312
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:21,920
to try something equivalent to one of these

1313
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:23,960
or equivalent hopefully to Beverly.

1314
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:27,520
And I wasn't sure where to begin there exactly.

1315
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:30,400
But after some Googling, I found this is pure conjecture.

1316
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:33,880
This is just comments on Reddit and on various blogs

1317
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:37,000
that compared Beverly to something.

1318
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:42,000
And let me read a couple comments that I found.

1319
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:43,600
Let's see.

1320
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:46,920
Beverly is bad, but not as bad as Chinoto.

1321
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:49,920
Italy loves soft drinks that taste like poison.

1322
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:51,800
Ha ha ha.

1323
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:53,600
Chinoto tastes all right to me as you sip it,

1324
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:55,600
but the aftertaste is quite vile.

1325
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:57,840
And then, let me see.

1326
00:49:57,840 --> 00:49:58,760
Oh, somebody else.

1327
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:02,680
Let's count your lucky stars and hope that Beverly

1328
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:04,880
is never replaced by Chinoto.

1329
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:08,760
Chinoto is brownish in color and might be slightly heavier.

1330
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:11,200
Even its aesthetic is not appealing to me.

1331
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:12,320
Looking around your garage,

1332
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:13,960
trying to figure out where Chinoto is hiding.

1333
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:16,600
The Chinoto is not here in the garage.

1334
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:18,160
We'll have to step down for a second

1335
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:20,520
and I'm gonna go grab it because I thought to be

1336
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:22,720
kind to ourselves, let's keep it cold.

1337
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:25,160
If we're getting lukewarm with that Chinoto,

1338
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:28,480
let's try to get this in its best possible state

1339
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:30,120
because as this blog said,

1340
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:31,960
maybe they aren't treating the Beverly right.

1341
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:35,520
Maybe there is a way to be presenting this Beverly better.

1342
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:39,560
In this case, this is like a packaged soda by Pellegrino.

1343
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:42,680
This is a Pellegrino product that is available

1344
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:45,280
at the Italian market near where I live.

1345
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:48,880
It was just in the grab and go bottle section

1346
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:51,000
as if it was Coke or something.

1347
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,320
I'm just grabbing a quick Chinoto

1348
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:54,120
and then I'm gonna get to my tennis match.

1349
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:55,840
So now you can the next time you do that.

1350
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:58,840
If you like it, but we have to see if we like it.

1351
00:50:58,840 --> 00:50:59,680
Should I go grab?

1352
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:02,760
Should we be brave and try some Chinoto?

1353
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:04,880
Maybe worse than Beverly.

1354
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:06,400
We'll see, I'm excited.

1355
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:09,400
The counter point, the soda I really like,

1356
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:14,400
it's not a club cool, is Barrett's ginger beer from Bermuda.

1357
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:16,720
When I was a kid and we took a cruise to Bermuda,

1358
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:19,480
it was just everywhere and just drank,

1359
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:21,320
didn't really drink Coke that week,

1360
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:23,360
it was just drinking this ginger beer.

1361
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:27,200
And it does have a full day's worth of sugar in it,

1362
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:30,440
but it is somehow less sweet than most ginger beers.

1363
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:31,280
Oh, weird.

1364
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:32,120
Okay.

1365
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:32,940
Huh, huh.

1366
00:51:32,940 --> 00:51:35,640
There's so much ginger, it will burn your throat

1367
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:37,040
if you drink too much of it.

1368
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:38,960
That's how ginger it is.

1369
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:42,360
Well, when I come back, I'll have a handful of Chinotos

1370
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:45,080
and we'll see if you get as addicted to these.

1371
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:45,920
Let's give it a shot.

1372
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:46,760
Okay.

1373
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:50,160
Okay, we got the bottles, we're charmed by the bottles.

1374
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:52,600
The bottles are nice and cute.

1375
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:55,520
Yes, we all agree the bottles are very cute.

1376
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:56,440
Very cute.

1377
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:59,920
And San Pellegrino branding, so they're sticking by this.

1378
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:01,880
Yeah, yeah, uh-huh.

1379
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:03,120
And it's brown.

1380
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:06,400
As I learned from this blog, the original Beverly was,

1381
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:07,720
because Beverly is clear now.

1382
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:08,560
Right, right.

1383
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:11,240
So that's kind of a clue that maybe it isn't what they,

1384
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:13,240
what product was actually made in Italy.

1385
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:17,280
So let's give it a shot.

1386
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:18,840
As close to the microphone.

1387
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:19,680
Close to the mic.

1388
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:21,960
And try to chew it if you can.

1389
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:24,600
No, here, I'll back up.

1390
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:25,440
We'll do it here.

1391
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:27,400
Says citrus flavored.

1392
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:29,360
Oh yeah, that's an important note.

1393
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:30,200
Yeah, and Wade is.

1394
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:31,040
I'm smelling it too, I'm smelling it.

1395
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:32,360
Do I know anything else about the,

1396
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:35,520
somebody said that they thought this was like prune juice.

1397
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:37,400
We'll see if that's accurate.

1398
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:41,520
Somebody said it's like anise,

1399
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:44,960
oh no, no, anise is more prominent in Beverly.

1400
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:48,880
Beverly, I think I also saw one of the flavoring elements,

1401
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:50,600
grapefruit rind.

1402
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:53,880
So the most bitter part of an already bitter fruit.

1403
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:55,240
Yeah, yeah, so that might be part of it.

1404
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:58,320
But maybe we're dealing with more pleasant stuff here.

1405
00:52:58,320 --> 00:52:59,400
I don't know.

1406
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:00,240
You wanna give it a try?

1407
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:01,080
Let's try.

1408
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:02,160
I do like the smell.

1409
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:03,120
I do like the smell as well.

1410
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:04,320
I think it's a pleasant smell.

1411
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:05,160
Okay.

1412
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:12,800
I'm fine with this.

1413
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:13,840
I think it's fine.

1414
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:15,720
I don't know if I'd do it again.

1415
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:19,920
Everybody really get up, get right up on their.

1416
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:23,880
Yeah, I kinda like it.

1417
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:27,080
There is an after taste.

1418
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:29,880
Yeah, yeah, it's a little bitter in the, yeah.

1419
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:34,880
If this is what those Reddit comments are talking about,

1420
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:38,120
and I find it hard to believe that a Reddit comment

1421
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:41,040
would be incorrect in its information

1422
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:43,280
or express some strange points of view.

1423
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:45,960
I don't think this is disgusting whatsoever.

1424
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:46,920
Mike, your thoughts?

1425
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:49,360
No, no, I think it's good, yeah.

1426
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:51,080
It's interesting.

1427
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:56,160
It's like, there's some vaguely medicinal taste in there.

1428
00:53:56,440 --> 00:54:00,360
Well, I think that's what a lot of the original formulas

1429
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:03,280
for sodas were medicine, essentially,

1430
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:04,600
and more medicinal.

1431
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:06,080
You can still buy cola syrup.

1432
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:08,320
I remember once as a kid, I had a bad stomach ache,

1433
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:10,640
and my mom's like, let's try cola syrup.

1434
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:11,640
Oh, sure, yeah.

1435
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:13,360
Which you can get at pharmacies,

1436
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:15,240
and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.

1437
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:17,960
I think it kinda helps settle my stomach a little.

1438
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:20,840
Yeah, and there's no corn syrup in this.

1439
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:22,520
I think it is sugar.

1440
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:24,120
I'll say this, the size of these bottles,

1441
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:27,800
this is the amount of soda I want.

1442
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:30,640
Yes, not like a massive, yeah, absolutely.

1443
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:31,800
A reasonable amount.

1444
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:33,120
Yeah, that would be good, you're right.

1445
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:34,600
This is a little charming.

1446
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:38,200
Erin tried it inside before I came out.

1447
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:41,520
She's like, I would make a cocktail with this anytime.

1448
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:42,480
This is great.

1449
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:45,760
I think so, and I think the Beverly's Revenge cocktail

1450
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:48,000
that they have at Disney Springs is gin and-

1451
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,480
Careful.

1452
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:52,200
Some other ingredients, but I thought,

1453
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:54,960
my first thought was, well, you wanna mix it with gin,

1454
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:57,680
because gin's a pretty potent liquor.

1455
00:54:57,680 --> 00:55:00,040
I would think you would wanna mix it with

1456
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:02,480
whiskey or something, right? Lemonade or limoncello,

1457
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:05,080
like something, yeah, or bourbon, like something sweeter.

1458
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:07,280
Yeah, maybe, yeah.

1459
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:08,560
I think that's interesting.

1460
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:11,200
Okay, you've had Beverly in the last two years,

1461
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:12,440
which I have not.

1462
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:14,960
Is there any equivalency between what we just had

1463
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:16,440
and Beverly? This is significantly

1464
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:18,440
more palatable than Beverly, I think.

1465
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:19,320
It's gotta be.

1466
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:22,320
If what we just had is anything close,

1467
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:25,240
then it can't be, but I've also, now Mr. Morrow,

1468
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:28,200
he seems, well, maybe he's just, you know,

1469
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:29,520
he's hardened to it.

1470
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:31,240
He goes to these places a lot.

1471
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:33,960
He seemed, I watched a video where he did Beverly

1472
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:35,080
down to no problem.

1473
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:36,960
He's just like, I'm into it.

1474
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:38,640
I think it's, I don't know if it's like a weird

1475
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:43,000
contrarian thing to say you like Beverly,

1476
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,480
or again, you're just not getting it in the right context.

1477
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:46,440
Yeah, that's interesting.

1478
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:49,200
He will, I mean, he's a very positive guy.

1479
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:51,280
I don't think he would go out of his way

1480
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:52,640
to say no, I like it.

1481
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:53,480
Yeah, no, I have.

1482
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:54,320
He's more performative.

1483
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:55,160
Yeah.

1484
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:56,160
It's true to himself, you could tell.

1485
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:58,520
I think he mixed Beverly in Sour Plum.

1486
00:55:58,520 --> 00:55:59,640
Did I say that already?

1487
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:00,480
Yeah, you said he mixed, yeah.

1488
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:01,960
And I think he was like, that's gross.

1489
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:05,920
Right, I think he, when he doesn't like something,

1490
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:08,320
you can tell, but he's still nice about it.

1491
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:10,000
He's never. Like a bee in his pocket.

1492
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,080
He doesn't, yeah, yeah, exactly.

1493
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:13,920
He doesn't trash something, but you could tell.

1494
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:15,240
He tries to understand why you might like

1495
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:16,320
having a bee in your pocket.

1496
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:18,000
Look, you don't want to be in your pocket,

1497
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:18,840
you don't want to be in your bonnet, you know?

1498
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:20,400
You don't want them anywhere.

1499
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:21,840
That's what I say.

1500
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:23,520
Yes, like the people who were mad

1501
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:25,040
that I explained what Beverly is.

1502
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:26,600
That's the definition of a bee in your bonnet.

1503
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:27,560
Or the bee in the bonnet.

1504
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:29,560
But you know what, we got it, we're moving on,

1505
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:31,720
we're chilling out at Club Cool,

1506
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:32,880
and we're doing an episode.

1507
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:33,880
I think we're having fun.

1508
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:36,080
Now, podcasting like comic books, every issue,

1509
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:38,240
every episode is someone's first episode,

1510
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:40,920
which is kind of insane to think about in podcasting

1511
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:45,040
if someone's hopping in on part 17 of the City Walks.

1512
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:45,880
True, true.

1513
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:48,280
I don't know if people start in the middle of that,

1514
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:49,680
but in the middle of the show.

1515
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:52,680
Sure, somebody probably tried and probably hated it.

1516
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:55,280
Spit it out like Beverly.

1517
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:56,120
Yeah.

1518
00:56:56,120 --> 00:56:58,080
Well, yeah, my point, I know we do so many things

1519
00:56:58,080 --> 00:57:00,440
that we just talk about and don't give any context for,

1520
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:02,200
but when you hear that like,

1521
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:04,640
oh, they've said E-ticket a number of times,

1522
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:06,520
and I don't know what E-ticket means.

1523
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:09,000
I don't know what they're, so that makes you think,

1524
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,160
well, maybe we should give a little more context.

1525
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:13,760
But then I say one sentence about Beverly,

1526
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:17,240
and it's like I went on a racist tirade.

1527
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:18,680
That's what that seemed like.

1528
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:21,960
You wrote that, like complaining about cancel culture

1529
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:23,800
in the New York Times editorial page.

1530
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:26,440
It's like, everyone was like, what are you talking about?

1531
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:28,080
You're the New York Times.

1532
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:34,000
Yes, well, yeah, cancel culture's out of hand.

1533
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,440
What was, sure, it didn't stop me

1534
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:37,680
from explaining what Beverly is.

1535
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:38,560
Yeah.

1536
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:40,040
Anyway, this is fine.

1537
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:43,800
I, again, let me just quote this blog directly.

1538
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:46,080
I'm not convinced that what Coke is distributing here

1539
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:48,520
is actually a fair representation of Beverly.

1540
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:51,400
And when I look back into like, they also,

1541
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:55,040
they provide some links to some cool YouTube videos

1542
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:57,720
of some very artsy, like, you know,

1543
00:57:57,720 --> 00:58:01,240
Mad Men era Beverly television commercials

1544
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:02,800
that are so cool.

1545
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:07,800
They use the Beverly slogan, which is really weird.

1546
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:09,160
They had a tagline.

1547
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:14,080
Cold is Helsinki, sparkling is Rio, dry is El Paso.

1548
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:16,320
And then there's like a, you know, some suave guy

1549
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:18,960
who's dressed like he's a cowboy when it's El Paso

1550
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:21,320
when he's in a furry hat when it's Helsinki.

1551
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:22,640
I don't know what the hell that means.

1552
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:25,200
I don't know how one beverage can be all of those things.

1553
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:26,800
But there had to have been something

1554
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:30,920
to the 60s Beverly for it to, like, maybe we have,

1555
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:33,160
I think we've perverted potentially

1556
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:34,880
with Chinoto as the proof.

1557
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:36,120
Right.

1558
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:37,800
If it was anything close to this,

1559
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:40,200
then maybe it's getting a bad rep today.

1560
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:41,640
Yeah, that's probably right.

1561
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:42,920
This is only tangential.

1562
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:46,880
Oh, it's related, but like this sort of, yeah,

1563
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:48,920
maybe what we're tasting as Beverly

1564
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:52,200
is like the aggressive version of this or something.

1565
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:53,440
Like take this.

1566
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:54,520
Dialed up all the way.

1567
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:55,760
Yeah.

1568
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:59,160
Because they're worried that, I don't know,

1569
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:01,120
that it wouldn't register even as anything.

1570
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:02,400
I don't know, cause it feels weird to me

1571
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:04,560
that Disney would be like, or Coke even,

1572
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:06,720
like we need to make sure people like hate it

1573
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:08,720
or have a strong reaction.

1574
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:12,320
But maybe they think, like, do the people at Coke know

1575
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:13,960
or whoever's giving, like the people hate this

1576
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:15,120
and this is funny.

1577
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:17,560
That doesn't make sense to me.

1578
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:19,000
So like, I feel like they were like,

1579
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,640
well, we're putting the amount of sugar or whatever

1580
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:25,280
that we were saying earlier that the normal American palate

1581
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:28,680
would desire for a soda.

1582
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:29,600
Like I just, it's weird.

1583
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:32,240
I don't, I can't quite tell.

1584
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:34,920
I mean, I think a cup of Beverly

1585
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:36,640
could use a tablespoon of sugar.

1586
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:39,800
Like I think that could be sweeter.

1587
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:40,640
Yeah.

1588
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:42,280
You think that would solve its problem?

1589
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:43,280
Potentially.

1590
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:46,760
More sugar or like, yeah, if you're mixing it with something.

1591
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:50,240
Like Beverly and lemonade might not be too bad.

1592
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:52,520
Interesting.

1593
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:53,480
I don't know.

1594
00:59:53,480 --> 00:59:54,920
Yeah, maybe they are playing into,

1595
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:57,320
because it seems like kind of a recent phenomenon

1596
00:59:57,320 --> 01:00:01,080
that YouTubers do videos of making people try Beverly

1597
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:03,720
and you get the grossed out faces.

1598
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:04,720
So maybe they're like, okay,

1599
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:06,920
we gotta keep these videos coming.

1600
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:10,880
So I'm worried that people are gonna get calloused

1601
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:13,840
to this soda or somebody with a more mature palate

1602
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:14,680
might come in.

1603
01:00:14,680 --> 01:00:16,320
So we gotta start getting this thing grosser.

1604
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:17,160
Right.

1605
01:00:17,160 --> 01:00:18,560
This is a new Coke scenario

1606
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:22,800
in the way that that is a conspiracy maybe

1607
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:24,320
to change out the formula.

1608
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:27,160
And maybe that like, they're trying to,

1609
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:29,520
it's a new grosser Beverly.

1610
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:30,720
Who knows what they're doing to it?

1611
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:31,560
Huh.

1612
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:33,560
Or it's like, yeah, it's like the,

1613
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:36,280
what's the Harry Potter jelly bellies called?

1614
01:00:37,320 --> 01:00:39,040
Bernie, the every flavor beans.

1615
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:39,880
Yeah.

1616
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:41,400
And there's one of his like fart flavored or something.

1617
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:43,000
Fart or vomit or something like that.

1618
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:43,840
Yeah.

1619
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:44,880
But jelly bellies do that too, right?

1620
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:46,720
There's like a couple of really gross ones.

1621
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:47,560
Yeah, they do.

1622
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:48,400
I think so.

1623
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:49,240
Yeah.

1624
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:50,800
But that's for sure like part of their fun, I guess.

1625
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:52,920
Even though I find that whenever I get it,

1626
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:54,400
I go, oh God, why?

1627
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:59,400
Well, it also helps re the Beverly placement.

1628
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:04,120
It also helps it like reinforce the idea of like,

1629
01:01:04,120 --> 01:01:06,080
you know, from American perspective of like,

1630
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:09,280
oh, other countries, so does how they sure are something.

1631
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:12,680
You know, like it's a little, you know.

1632
01:01:12,680 --> 01:01:14,800
Well, is it possible that this is some

1633
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:16,920
anti Italian propaganda?

1634
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:17,760
There we go.

1635
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:19,360
Yes, here's where we're landing.

1636
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:23,080
Where it's like to make you feel like,

1637
01:01:23,080 --> 01:01:25,040
how kooky these people could be.

1638
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:28,120
They drink this is like a sweet drink to them.

1639
01:01:28,120 --> 01:01:28,960
Are they crazy?

1640
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:31,520
Are they trying to stir up distrust

1641
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:33,080
in the Italians for some reason?

1642
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:36,280
Maybe, or yeah, maybe it's even less nefarious

1643
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:38,000
and it's yeah, it's more just trying

1644
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:42,240
to make it feel so exotic that it would shock you.

1645
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:44,240
They're trying to shock you in the same way

1646
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:47,640
that they're trying to shock you with a mission to space,

1647
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:52,640
or they're trying to shock you with a 60 mile an hour turn

1648
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:54,840
and straight away on the end of test track.

1649
01:01:54,840 --> 01:01:58,040
It's the palette equivalent of that.

1650
01:01:58,080 --> 01:01:58,920
Exactly.

1651
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:00,360
It's the harrowing acts.

1652
01:02:00,360 --> 01:02:01,720
Splash mountain drop.

1653
01:02:01,720 --> 01:02:05,920
It's the big moment that makes you go, what?

1654
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:08,200
Places are different than our place?

1655
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:12,160
Like that's the whole point of Club Cool.

1656
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:16,000
So maybe that's the reason that they need it to, yeah.

1657
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,800
Cause like the watermelon soda, you don't have it,

1658
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:21,720
but like we've had, you've had weird juice.

1659
01:02:21,720 --> 01:02:22,920
Cactus cooler.

1660
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:24,520
Yeah, that's not so wild.

1661
01:02:24,520 --> 01:02:26,840
Most of it's not that wild.

1662
01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:31,240
So they have to have one in there that makes you feel

1663
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:33,280
like it's from a different planet.

1664
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:37,000
What if they're routing water from a nearby ride?

1665
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:41,000
Like we're not that far from, you know, frozen ever after.

1666
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,760
What if there's a pipe that goes straight from the water

1667
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:47,920
in that river, right into that fountain for Beverly?

1668
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:50,480
What if you're not, this isn't even, this isn't remotely,

1669
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:52,680
it's not a formula of a soda at all.

1670
01:02:52,680 --> 01:02:56,480
Well, it's even closer to the living with the land.

1671
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:58,560
So there could be pomace.

1672
01:02:58,560 --> 01:02:59,680
They could be having pomace.

1673
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:02,840
They're trying to get rid of filtering the water through it.

1674
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:07,480
Maybe they're diffusing like through a pipe that is nearby.

1675
01:03:07,480 --> 01:03:09,240
Yeah, that they've like shaved off

1676
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:11,520
of some of their hydroponics.

1677
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:15,120
So it's like, so it's theme park boat water running

1678
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:18,520
through a pomace laced tube.

1679
01:03:18,520 --> 01:03:19,600
Yeah.

1680
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:20,440
Hmm.

1681
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:23,080
This is a good, I think we need to see, open the pipes,

1682
01:03:23,080 --> 01:03:25,480
Disney, we need to see your pipes.

1683
01:03:25,480 --> 01:03:27,200
Where is that Beverly coming from?

1684
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:28,480
What are we drinking?

1685
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:30,000
Hashtag open the pipes.

1686
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,120
There's a lot of Imagineers that have been laid off

1687
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:34,320
and have left recently.

1688
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:36,960
And will anyone go off the record, at least with us,

1689
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:38,520
that is listening now?

1690
01:03:38,520 --> 01:03:39,720
Do they know?

1691
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:41,680
You say yes, you know, or are you disagreeing with them?

1692
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:42,800
Yeah, I'm agreeing with you.

1693
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:43,840
Yes, I would love that.

1694
01:03:43,840 --> 01:03:46,760
I mean, I would also love, you know, we,

1695
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:50,080
I mentioned earlier, the previous iteration of Club Cool

1696
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:52,520
was called Ice Station Cool.

1697
01:03:52,520 --> 01:03:57,080
And it had a very unique theme.

1698
01:03:57,080 --> 01:03:59,360
It looked like a big snowy cavern

1699
01:03:59,360 --> 01:04:03,920
with a giant snowcat like machine outside.

1700
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:07,160
And just gonna read this chunk from Yesterland.

1701
01:04:07,160 --> 01:04:09,000
In an odd bit of theatrical theming

1702
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:10,960
at Epcot's otherwise modern commuter core,

1703
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:14,240
Ice Station Cool was themed as an exploration site

1704
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:15,840
in a polar region.

1705
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:18,800
A snow cap with Coca Cola shaped,

1706
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:20,600
Coca Cola bottle shaped shreds

1707
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:23,640
sat in front of a tunnel into the ice.

1708
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:26,040
A plaque on the outside read,

1709
01:04:26,040 --> 01:04:28,600
Refreshes Maximus Expeditions,

1710
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:31,520
led by Coca Cola Coolologists.

1711
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:32,560
Love Coolologists.

1712
01:04:32,560 --> 01:04:34,400
Love Coolologists have explored

1713
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:36,000
the farthest reaches of the globe.

1714
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:39,720
Their mission, to discover the origins of cool.

1715
01:04:39,720 --> 01:04:42,280
Cool capitalized like God.

1716
01:04:42,280 --> 01:04:44,320
Yeah, much like God.

1717
01:04:44,320 --> 01:04:45,160
And...

1718
01:04:46,760 --> 01:04:48,320
That's better, right?

1719
01:04:48,320 --> 01:04:49,840
We agree that was better.

1720
01:04:49,880 --> 01:04:50,720
I think so.

1721
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:52,120
I mean, there's a backstory.

1722
01:04:52,120 --> 01:04:53,320
Right, exactly.

1723
01:04:53,320 --> 01:04:55,560
And you really go to a place.

1724
01:04:55,560 --> 01:04:57,000
I mean, not to take anything away

1725
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,720
from the theming of the club,

1726
01:04:59,720 --> 01:05:01,400
but it's a little more Epcot-y

1727
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:03,360
that you're going into a research base.

1728
01:05:03,360 --> 01:05:04,440
Sorry, was there more, Jason?

1729
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:09,360
Oh yeah, because there's a further audit goes,

1730
01:05:09,360 --> 01:05:12,680
guess all that Refreshes Maximus Expedition

1731
01:05:12,680 --> 01:05:15,080
had made a gruesome discovery.

1732
01:05:15,080 --> 01:05:17,640
The perfectly preserved frozen corpse

1733
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:20,960
they called Thirsty Man was behind glass.

1734
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:24,040
He was collecting a prehistoric Coca Cola.

1735
01:05:24,040 --> 01:05:26,040
The plaque below the glass read,

1736
01:05:26,040 --> 01:05:27,960
this early human ancestor,

1737
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:30,400
frozen in his hunt for refreshment,

1738
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:33,600
was discovered in the sub-Arctic.

1739
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:37,480
The Coca Cola Coolologists named him Thirsty Man

1740
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:39,160
for obvious reasons.

1741
01:05:39,160 --> 01:05:42,200
The object found frozen just beyond his grasp

1742
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:46,200
leads us to ask, what came first, man or refreshment?

1743
01:05:47,160 --> 01:05:52,160
So a man frozen in his death,

1744
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:55,160
clutching a bottle of Coke

1745
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:59,000
that somehow existed in caveman times.

1746
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:04,000
Prehistoric man, like the monolith from 2001 has landed.

1747
01:06:04,840 --> 01:06:08,560
And instead of reaching for a bone to turn into a tool,

1748
01:06:08,560 --> 01:06:11,120
he's reaching for an old Coke.

1749
01:06:11,120 --> 01:06:13,200
I had no memory of Thirsty Man.

1750
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:14,040
No idea.

1751
01:06:14,040 --> 01:06:15,440
He's now a PTR favorite.

1752
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:16,280
I'm gonna call it now.

1753
01:06:16,280 --> 01:06:17,440
We all like Thirsty Man.

1754
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:19,040
We all love Thirsty Man.

1755
01:06:19,040 --> 01:06:19,880
Yes.

1756
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:22,480
But I was saying to Jay and I was like,

1757
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:24,720
hey, did you know Club Cool used to be something else?

1758
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:27,480
Cause I remember going when I was much younger

1759
01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:29,040
and I was like, oh, it had a different name

1760
01:06:29,040 --> 01:06:29,920
and like a different end.

1761
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:32,160
She's like, yeah, the dead guy.

1762
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:33,000
And I was like, what?

1763
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:34,000
And she was like, there was this,

1764
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,080
when I was a kid, there was a scary man,

1765
01:06:36,080 --> 01:06:38,240
like frozen in the ice.

1766
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:39,080
And I'm like.

1767
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:40,920
So she knew Thirsty Man.

1768
01:06:40,920 --> 01:06:41,760
She knew Thirsty.

1769
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:43,920
She had a memory of being scared,

1770
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:45,840
having to run by Thirsty Man.

1771
01:06:45,840 --> 01:06:47,000
And I had no memory at all.

1772
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:47,840
I'm like.

1773
01:06:47,840 --> 01:06:49,000
We gotta get past this fast

1774
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:50,520
cause he might break out of the glass.

1775
01:06:50,520 --> 01:06:51,600
How dead is he?

1776
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:53,800
What if he's just temporarily frozen?

1777
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:56,520
And I did not understand what she was talking about

1778
01:06:56,520 --> 01:06:57,640
until I saw these pictures.

1779
01:06:57,640 --> 01:07:00,080
I was like, they had a preserved corpse?

1780
01:07:00,080 --> 01:07:03,480
There's no way they just have a corpse in Epcot.

1781
01:07:03,480 --> 01:07:05,200
That's pretty crazy.

1782
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:06,040
Yeah.

1783
01:07:06,040 --> 01:07:06,880
Yeah.

1784
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:07,840
Thirsty Man.

1785
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:08,720
Thirsty Man.

1786
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:12,120
Well, am I, wait, am I crazy?

1787
01:07:12,120 --> 01:07:13,400
I'm fact checking this right now.

1788
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:14,240
Oh, no, no, no.

1789
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:16,160
I'm not crazy.

1790
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:17,400
This, this,

1791
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:18,520
Syndra, this,

1792
01:07:18,520 --> 01:07:23,640
a caveman frozen in ice.

1793
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:25,720
This is the plot of a classic film

1794
01:07:25,720 --> 01:07:27,920
that Disney made and owns,

1795
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:29,600
a film called Encino Man.

1796
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:30,440
Yes.

1797
01:07:30,440 --> 01:07:31,280
Oh, of course.

1798
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:33,280
And everything is IP crazy.

1799
01:07:34,120 --> 01:07:35,000
But if we,

1800
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:38,960
and I could see the desire to remake Encino Man.

1801
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:40,640
You know,

1802
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:44,000
you know, Brendan Fraser's riding a wave.

1803
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:45,840
I think people are fond of him again.

1804
01:07:45,840 --> 01:07:46,920
But if we want to open it up,

1805
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:49,040
if people, if we want to make it more international,

1806
01:07:49,040 --> 01:07:52,160
if people in other countries are like, what's Encino?

1807
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:54,480
The way maybe to broaden it out is to,

1808
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:56,160
is to make it Thirsty Man.

1809
01:07:56,160 --> 01:07:57,360
Yeah, that's right.

1810
01:07:57,360 --> 01:08:00,160
And to make a fully funded feature film

1811
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:03,000
in cooperation with the Coca-Cola Company.

1812
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:04,680
We know that they're great at making movies.

1813
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:06,840
People have said great things about

1814
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:10,840
this World of Coke movie with Professor Wet Whistle.

1815
01:08:10,840 --> 01:08:12,520
Professor Wet Whistle could get in on,

1816
01:08:12,520 --> 01:08:13,360
I haven't seen him,

1817
01:08:13,360 --> 01:08:14,840
but again, PTR favorite already.

1818
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:16,880
And now before you've even seen the thing.

1819
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:17,720
So Professor,

1820
01:08:17,720 --> 01:08:18,560
Professor Wet Whistle,

1821
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:21,640
let's tie together the entire Coca-verse.

1822
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:24,920
Professor Wet Whistle discovers Thirsty Man.

1823
01:08:24,920 --> 01:08:26,800
And then the,

1824
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:30,560
we'll have the polar bears and Santa Claus in it as well,

1825
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:31,640
from the Coca-verse.

1826
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:33,240
Oh, absolutely.

1827
01:08:33,240 --> 01:08:35,800
And then other Coca-Cola celebrities,

1828
01:08:35,840 --> 01:08:37,000
I'm trying to say. Santa Claus.

1829
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:37,840
I just said him.

1830
01:08:37,840 --> 01:08:38,680
Oh, you said him.

1831
01:08:38,680 --> 01:08:41,120
I was just, yeah.

1832
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:45,920
But yeah, cause our modern image of Santa Claus

1833
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:49,000
goes back to like Coca-Cola ads and stuff.

1834
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:50,600
Paulie Shore is Santa Claus.

1835
01:08:52,520 --> 01:08:53,360
Well, does then,

1836
01:08:53,360 --> 01:08:54,800
well, is this also,

1837
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:58,840
does the Santa Claus universe tie into this as well?

1838
01:08:58,840 --> 01:08:59,680
Yeah.

1839
01:08:59,680 --> 01:09:04,040
The Santa Claus movies have always quietly been

1840
01:09:04,040 --> 01:09:06,240
Coca-Cola branded products.

1841
01:09:06,240 --> 01:09:07,080
Yes.

1842
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:08,640
Coke just never stepped up and said,

1843
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:09,960
give us money for that.

1844
01:09:09,960 --> 01:09:10,880
Right. Are we getting,

1845
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:12,240
I forget, is it a,

1846
01:09:12,240 --> 01:09:14,400
are we getting a Santa Claus show with Tim Allen

1847
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:15,240
on Disney plus,

1848
01:09:15,240 --> 01:09:16,760
or is it a movie?

1849
01:09:16,760 --> 01:09:17,840
I think it's a show.

1850
01:09:17,840 --> 01:09:19,080
It's a show series.

1851
01:09:19,080 --> 01:09:19,920
Sign on.

1852
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:21,960
Yeah. We're getting more than a movie.

1853
01:09:21,960 --> 01:09:23,320
We're getting, finally.

1854
01:09:23,320 --> 01:09:28,080
We're getting eight hours of Tim Allen, Santa Claus.

1855
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:29,600
It is mid seventies.

1856
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:34,000
What if it was like a Sopranos or like a PG Sopranos

1857
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:36,320
or Breaking Bad Santa Claus.

1858
01:09:36,320 --> 01:09:37,760
I think that would be a great idea.

1859
01:09:37,760 --> 01:09:39,000
We know it's not that.

1860
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:39,840
I know.

1861
01:09:39,840 --> 01:09:41,200
Yeah. But we, I don't know,

1862
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:43,080
but you know, in a way do we know?

1863
01:09:43,080 --> 01:09:46,040
Cause we're, this is the post Bel Air world.

1864
01:09:46,040 --> 01:09:49,160
We know we're taking stories more seriously.

1865
01:09:49,160 --> 01:09:50,760
And I think it's kind of,

1866
01:09:50,760 --> 01:09:52,800
it's, I'm a little offended honestly,

1867
01:09:52,800 --> 01:09:56,040
that they threw away Santa Claus's death

1868
01:09:56,040 --> 01:09:58,360
to create the premise of the first Santa Claus.

1869
01:09:58,360 --> 01:10:00,240
They do, we're so flippant about it.

1870
01:10:00,240 --> 01:10:02,960
I think episode one is just fully the death,

1871
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:04,280
hiding the body.

1872
01:10:04,280 --> 01:10:09,280
I think they let Tim Allen out of it easily.

1873
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:12,560
In the first one by the body just disappearing.

1874
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:15,480
I think they have to dissolve it, Breaking Bad Asid style.

1875
01:10:15,480 --> 01:10:17,320
Can I add to this?

1876
01:10:17,320 --> 01:10:21,920
The new version, Tim Allen murders Santa Claus on purpose.

1877
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:22,760
Yeah.

1878
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:23,640
He kills Santa Claus.

1879
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:27,040
This members him in a long scene.

1880
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:30,880
Body part by body part into the chimney, into the fireplace.

1881
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:31,720
Yeah. Yeah.

1882
01:10:31,880 --> 01:10:33,560
Okay. So this is like a Dexter sort of thing.

1883
01:10:33,560 --> 01:10:34,400
Yes.

1884
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:35,840
And he did it just cause he wanted to like,

1885
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:37,000
I want to see a man die.

1886
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:38,840
The first scene is just Tim Allen.

1887
01:10:38,840 --> 01:10:41,560
The first episode is Tim Allen killing him.

1888
01:10:41,560 --> 01:10:43,400
It's just a long first step.

1889
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:48,000
Methodical, slow, heartless, jokeless, gruntless.

1890
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:51,720
He's not doing, we're pushing Tim Allen's acting.

1891
01:10:51,720 --> 01:10:54,040
We're going to make him go there finally,

1892
01:10:54,040 --> 01:10:56,440
give him like the late period performance

1893
01:10:56,440 --> 01:10:58,960
that lets you know what he's capable of.

1894
01:10:59,360 --> 01:11:02,480
Yes. I think that's what we're headed for here.

1895
01:11:02,480 --> 01:11:03,320
Sounds great.

1896
01:11:03,320 --> 01:11:05,560
Does he kill him because he wants to be Santa Claus

1897
01:11:05,560 --> 01:11:07,560
or kind of Jason, like what you just said,

1898
01:11:07,560 --> 01:11:10,120
that maybe he just wants to, he's out for blood.

1899
01:11:10,120 --> 01:11:12,520
Is it like, oh, and on top of that,

1900
01:11:12,520 --> 01:11:14,840
this man I murdered was Santa Claus?

1901
01:11:14,840 --> 01:11:18,880
Maybe it's a twisted version of the meaning of like,

1902
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:21,680
you know, peace on earth, goodwill to men.

1903
01:11:21,680 --> 01:11:25,800
He's experienced that and he wants to see the full range

1904
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:29,560
of human possibilities and see the mirror opposite.

1905
01:11:29,560 --> 01:11:30,960
Like what is the darkest?

1906
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:35,320
If that's the best we can be, what is the darkest?

1907
01:11:35,320 --> 01:11:37,240
What is the darkest we can be?

1908
01:11:37,240 --> 01:11:40,560
I mean, this has so much more going on

1909
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:42,880
in terms of issues and complexity

1910
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:45,520
than the original Santa Claus.

1911
01:11:45,520 --> 01:11:48,520
This is a, it requires a complex palette,

1912
01:11:48,520 --> 01:11:49,840
but that's today's viewers.

1913
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:51,440
We want more, we want to go there.

1914
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:53,280
That's right. That's true.

1915
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:55,040
But together, all quadrants,

1916
01:11:55,040 --> 01:11:58,280
the second episode will introduce Krampus

1917
01:11:58,280 --> 01:12:00,160
and Krampus will do TikTok dances.

1918
01:12:00,160 --> 01:12:02,000
You know, you got to hit the quadrants, you know.

1919
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:03,400
Keep it fun. We'll keep it fun for everybody.

1920
01:12:03,400 --> 01:12:04,280
Yeah. Yeah.

1921
01:12:04,280 --> 01:12:06,240
Well, I think, and also, I just went looking for,

1922
01:12:06,240 --> 01:12:08,600
is there more Coca-Cola IP to tie in?

1923
01:12:08,600 --> 01:12:10,440
And I'm pretty horrified at what I found,

1924
01:12:10,440 --> 01:12:14,680
which is the character named Sprite Boy.

1925
01:12:14,680 --> 01:12:16,080
Anybody ever seen Sprite Boy?

1926
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:17,680
I have seen Sprite Boy.

1927
01:12:17,680 --> 01:12:20,160
Yeah. He's kind of reminiscent of,

1928
01:12:20,160 --> 01:12:21,000
well, this is what you do.

1929
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:23,640
Jack Frost, forget Jack Frost.

1930
01:12:23,640 --> 01:12:25,480
You kind of reset Jack Frost,

1931
01:12:25,480 --> 01:12:28,040
as played by Martin Short, as Sprite Boy,

1932
01:12:28,040 --> 01:12:30,200
because we're basically looking at Jack Frost,

1933
01:12:30,200 --> 01:12:33,880
but with a giant bottle cap fused to his head.

1934
01:12:33,880 --> 01:12:36,280
This is a freak of nature, this character.

1935
01:12:36,280 --> 01:12:40,000
Oddly not a Sprite promoting character.

1936
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:40,840
Right. He's not a,

1937
01:12:40,840 --> 01:12:43,880
but he's a Sprite in the former sense of Sprite,

1938
01:12:43,880 --> 01:12:46,640
not the product sense of Sprite.

1939
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:50,560
And if we're, if we want this thing to be terrifying,

1940
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:52,000
Sprite Boy is.

1941
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,200
It's played by a 75 year old Martin Short.

1942
01:12:55,280 --> 01:12:56,120
Is that what you're getting at?

1943
01:12:56,120 --> 01:12:56,960
Sure. Yeah. Yeah.

1944
01:12:56,960 --> 01:12:58,480
Or, or, or Jason.

1945
01:12:58,480 --> 01:12:59,320
Well, Jason, please.

1946
01:12:59,320 --> 01:13:00,160
Well.

1947
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:02,680
More than welcome.

1948
01:13:02,680 --> 01:13:03,840
You know, send in a tape.

1949
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:04,680
We'll look at it. Sure.

1950
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:07,240
We'll look at both Martin's audition and Jason's audition.

1951
01:13:07,240 --> 01:13:08,060
Well, I was going to say,

1952
01:13:08,060 --> 01:13:10,240
if you need to broaden the cast a little,

1953
01:13:10,240 --> 01:13:12,280
they could do a Who Framed Roger Rabbit,

1954
01:13:12,280 --> 01:13:15,200
do a little licensing and get some seven up characters

1955
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:17,960
in there. Cause of course we all know Cool Spot.

1956
01:13:17,960 --> 01:13:22,960
There was also the brief 80s character, Fido Dido.

1957
01:13:23,080 --> 01:13:24,880
Kind of looks like Pepper Anne.

1958
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:26,280
What's Fido Dido?

1959
01:13:26,280 --> 01:13:27,560
Fido Dido looks like,

1960
01:13:29,240 --> 01:13:32,680
I don't, I don't know how to describe this.

1961
01:13:32,680 --> 01:13:34,760
Fido Dido is a little doodle.

1962
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:41,000
A little doodle like guy in a t-shirt and shorts.

1963
01:13:41,860 --> 01:13:42,700
I don't know.

1964
01:13:42,700 --> 01:13:44,920
How would you describe Fido Dido?

1965
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:46,680
Oh yeah. You're right about Pepper Anne.

1966
01:13:46,680 --> 01:13:47,840
Kind of a squiggle guy.

1967
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:50,480
Yeah. Kind of a squiggly character.

1968
01:13:50,480 --> 01:13:51,840
Fido Dido.

1969
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:53,600
Well, why can't the, you know,

1970
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:56,480
why can't the soda companies wage war and like,

1971
01:13:56,480 --> 01:14:00,600
it should be about the Coke characters, you know,

1972
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:03,960
going on a killing spree against the seven up character.

1973
01:14:03,960 --> 01:14:06,080
Oh, the polar bear kills Cool Spot.

1974
01:14:07,680 --> 01:14:10,320
Eating each spot, just like grabbing it,

1975
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:12,480
like stripping all of the red,

1976
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:16,120
leaving whatever skeleton would be under a Cool Spot.

1977
01:14:16,280 --> 01:14:19,160
Just the legs, I guess, spits out the sneakers.

1978
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:24,440
There was a cool, I had the Cool Spot video game growing.

1979
01:14:24,440 --> 01:14:26,280
I loved the Cool Spot video game.

1980
01:14:26,280 --> 01:14:27,120
It was a little good.

1981
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:29,240
Like you had to make fun of it.

1982
01:14:29,240 --> 01:14:30,360
But I- Like side scroll.

1983
01:14:30,360 --> 01:14:32,120
Visually, it seems like, yeah,

1984
01:14:32,120 --> 01:14:33,760
there was something going on in design.

1985
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:36,360
There was a Noid video game too.

1986
01:14:36,360 --> 01:14:37,520
Domino's Pizza Noid.

1987
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:38,960
So yeah.

1988
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:41,400
So they should bring all that stuff back.

1989
01:14:41,400 --> 01:14:44,640
There should be a PS5 Cool Spot game.

1990
01:14:46,160 --> 01:14:47,840
And we'll get there.

1991
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:48,800
Yeah, sure.

1992
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:53,160
How many steps are we away from movies or just brands?

1993
01:14:53,160 --> 01:14:54,880
And then there's- Oh yeah.

1994
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:56,840
Like, and Aaron brought this up the other day,

1995
01:14:56,840 --> 01:14:59,840
like, well, how soon is it just gonna be Target the movie?

1996
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:01,320
Best Buy the movie.

1997
01:15:01,320 --> 01:15:03,240
And then there's people like vehemently defending,

1998
01:15:03,240 --> 01:15:06,480
like why, no, why can't Coles the movie be good?

1999
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:07,320
I don't understand.

2000
01:15:07,320 --> 01:15:10,280
Like, how cynical are you that you think that Coles,

2001
01:15:10,280 --> 01:15:12,000
they're gonna nail Coles the movie.

2002
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,520
Look, don't gatekeep Coles the move, okay?

2003
01:15:15,080 --> 01:15:16,360
Let's not, you know.

2004
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:21,520
Those Jimmy John commercials with Brad Garrett.

2005
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:22,680
Actually, don't make those a movie.

2006
01:15:22,680 --> 01:15:24,160
I didn't get the part of the assistant.

2007
01:15:24,160 --> 01:15:25,960
I don't want, I don't wanna see it ever again.

2008
01:15:25,960 --> 01:15:28,280
You say those commercials, I don't know them.

2009
01:15:28,280 --> 01:15:29,440
I'm not tracing them.

2010
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:31,120
Oh, they're a lot.

2011
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:32,640
90 year old Martin Scorsese,

2012
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:34,920
like the Coles movie is just something we shouldn't,

2013
01:15:34,920 --> 01:15:37,800
like we should really cherish the movies that are made

2014
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:40,840
by like auteurs and that and shut up old man.

2015
01:15:40,840 --> 01:15:41,760
Idiot.

2016
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:45,920
Old man farts a lot, has opinion.

2017
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:49,160
You did. Good for you.

2018
01:15:49,160 --> 01:15:51,000
How'd you squeeze that one out?

2019
01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:56,120
Show the hell, we want to see Marshall's too.

2020
01:16:01,080 --> 01:16:04,720
Well, I mean, hey, we're the ones pitching brand movies.

2021
01:16:04,720 --> 01:16:05,560
That's true.

2022
01:16:05,560 --> 01:16:09,560
And enjoying clubs brought to,

2023
01:16:09,560 --> 01:16:13,000
clubs and ice expeditions and the range

2024
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:16,080
of great themed experiences, crucial themed experiences

2025
01:16:16,080 --> 01:16:19,360
brought to us by our friends at the Coca-Cola company.

2026
01:16:19,360 --> 01:16:20,200
Yeah.

2027
01:16:20,200 --> 01:16:24,520
You know, I, when reading about like old Epcot stuff

2028
01:16:24,520 --> 01:16:27,760
recently, we're coming up on the anniversary of Epcot.

2029
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:29,920
Is that 40 years?

2030
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:30,760
Of Epcot?

2031
01:16:30,760 --> 01:16:32,400
I don't, well, I don't know,

2032
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:33,440
cause I'm not keeping track.

2033
01:16:33,440 --> 01:16:36,280
I start, it's kind of a BCAD for me,

2034
01:16:36,280 --> 01:16:38,400
where I started at Club Cool.

2035
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:41,760
Like I don't acknowledge any Epcot before Club Cool.

2036
01:16:41,760 --> 01:16:45,640
But there was, you know, a window of time, you know,

2037
01:16:45,640 --> 01:16:47,160
you could play Genesis games

2038
01:16:47,160 --> 01:16:48,800
and you could drink unlimited soda.

2039
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:50,440
And for as much as they're like,

2040
01:16:50,440 --> 01:16:52,360
what if there's a weird circus in Epcot?

2041
01:16:52,360 --> 01:16:55,000
What if there was a water show with a millennium

2042
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:58,360
celebration and the language sounds like all language.

2043
01:16:58,360 --> 01:17:01,280
Like there's a lot of, you know,

2044
01:17:01,280 --> 01:17:03,680
negotiating from points of weakness.

2045
01:17:03,680 --> 01:17:06,160
But then every now and then they do know what kids want.

2046
01:17:06,160 --> 01:17:09,400
They want unlimited soda and they want free video games.

2047
01:17:09,400 --> 01:17:10,760
Yeah. Yeah.

2048
01:17:10,760 --> 01:17:12,920
And one went away, but one stays.

2049
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:15,520
One came back even though its venue was taken away.

2050
01:17:15,520 --> 01:17:17,120
Come back multiple times,

2051
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:18,480
like shut down for a few months

2052
01:17:18,480 --> 01:17:20,280
to become the first Club Cool.

2053
01:17:20,280 --> 01:17:23,280
Then it shut down, survived the pandemic

2054
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:25,320
and became new Club Cool,

2055
01:17:25,320 --> 01:17:27,400
which kind of has a beveled glass center.

2056
01:17:27,400 --> 01:17:29,040
Kind of looks like the Coke.

2057
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:30,680
If you would ever get a fountain Coke

2058
01:17:30,680 --> 01:17:32,920
at like a soda shop or something.

2059
01:17:34,200 --> 01:17:35,920
Yeah, it's fun.

2060
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:37,160
I was going to say, is there a plus?

2061
01:17:37,160 --> 01:17:38,240
Do you have a plus up?

2062
01:17:38,240 --> 01:17:39,440
Does anybody have a plus up real quick

2063
01:17:39,440 --> 01:17:40,640
before we get out of here?

2064
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:42,160
Oh, interesting.

2065
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:47,240
Cause like I obviously froze the frozen man,

2066
01:17:47,240 --> 01:17:48,080
whatever he was called.

2067
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:48,920
Thirsty man. Thirsty man.

2068
01:17:48,920 --> 01:17:50,240
Bring him back, animate him.

2069
01:17:50,240 --> 01:17:52,520
He's serving the sodas.

2070
01:17:52,520 --> 01:17:54,240
More for you.

2071
01:17:54,240 --> 01:17:56,160
Right. Yeah.

2072
01:17:56,160 --> 01:17:57,840
How was the plum?

2073
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:00,200
If they could have,

2074
01:18:01,680 --> 01:18:03,760
I was going to say if they could be served by somebody

2075
01:18:03,760 --> 01:18:04,760
like in the world showcase,

2076
01:18:04,760 --> 01:18:07,480
where they have people from the separate countries.

2077
01:18:07,480 --> 01:18:09,080
If you could get like an Italian,

2078
01:18:09,080 --> 01:18:10,760
could give you the Beverly.

2079
01:18:10,760 --> 01:18:11,600
Okay.

2080
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:12,760
Maybe you could like tell you,

2081
01:18:12,760 --> 01:18:14,800
or you had like a sommelier,

2082
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:16,720
even in general doesn't have to be from the country

2083
01:18:16,720 --> 01:18:19,160
that could explain the different intricacies.

2084
01:18:19,160 --> 01:18:22,880
And like, then we could ask the questions we're asking here

2085
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:26,040
and it could be a much more learning experience

2086
01:18:26,040 --> 01:18:28,320
than we have now where we just have to guess a lot.

2087
01:18:28,320 --> 01:18:30,440
I would love a soda sommelier.

2088
01:18:30,440 --> 01:18:31,400
That sounds great.

2089
01:18:31,400 --> 01:18:33,320
I'm sure at the Atlanta tour,

2090
01:18:33,320 --> 01:18:35,720
all these companies have like someone whose palette

2091
01:18:35,720 --> 01:18:37,680
is like the super taster or something.

2092
01:18:37,680 --> 01:18:38,640
Right. Yes.

2093
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:39,760
And yeah.

2094
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:42,240
Well, I was going to say simpler.

2095
01:18:42,240 --> 01:18:44,400
If you like, you know,

2096
01:18:44,400 --> 01:18:47,480
country club or you like Bebo,

2097
01:18:47,480 --> 01:18:49,760
you should then be able to walk up to the counter

2098
01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:51,600
and buy like a bottle.

2099
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:52,440
This is a great idea.

2100
01:18:52,440 --> 01:18:53,280
Oh yeah.

2101
01:18:53,280 --> 01:18:55,160
I'm surprised they don't have.

2102
01:18:55,160 --> 01:18:56,280
That is strange.

2103
01:18:56,280 --> 01:18:57,120
Yeah.

2104
01:18:57,120 --> 01:18:59,000
Cause you would think it would be a no brainer

2105
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,400
that they could sell some, at least, at least yes.

2106
01:19:01,400 --> 01:19:03,960
They could sell not maybe a two liter,

2107
01:19:03,960 --> 01:19:05,520
but sell something you could sip and drink.

2108
01:19:05,520 --> 01:19:06,600
A 16 ounce bottle.

2109
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:07,440
Like the other size ones.

2110
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:08,840
This little Pellegrino bottle we just had.

2111
01:19:08,840 --> 01:19:09,680
Right.

2112
01:19:09,680 --> 01:19:10,520
Yeah. A little sipper.

2113
01:19:10,520 --> 01:19:11,360
Yeah. Why not?

2114
01:19:11,360 --> 01:19:12,200
Right.

2115
01:19:12,200 --> 01:19:13,920
So yeah, that's interesting that they don't.

2116
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:18,920
I think the beverage distribution is still so chaotic.

2117
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:20,480
Like, and stuff like in,

2118
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:23,080
especially once you get into like alcoholic beverage,

2119
01:19:23,080 --> 01:19:25,600
like we still can't get yingling in California.

2120
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:27,600
They keep saying it's coming.

2121
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:31,120
Like, you can't get yingling beer from Pennsylvania.

2122
01:19:31,960 --> 01:19:33,280
You can't get it in California.

2123
01:19:33,280 --> 01:19:34,120
I don't know about this.

2124
01:19:34,120 --> 01:19:34,960
Texas and stuff.

2125
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:35,800
This is Pennsylvania.

2126
01:19:35,800 --> 01:19:39,320
Has that been, what is the start is one of the questions.

2127
01:19:39,320 --> 01:19:40,160
What do you mean?

2128
01:19:40,160 --> 01:19:41,880
Like, is it something that was available

2129
01:19:41,880 --> 01:19:42,880
and is not available now?

2130
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:45,720
No, it's just, it's not really available much,

2131
01:19:45,720 --> 01:19:47,760
like a certain part of the country.

2132
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:50,320
You can get it like on the Eastern Sea of board.

2133
01:19:50,320 --> 01:19:53,040
And like they, I think we're just figuring out

2134
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:57,680
the licensing it to brewers in like Texas

2135
01:19:57,680 --> 01:19:58,520
to get it in other places.

2136
01:19:58,520 --> 01:20:00,040
So this has been something that's ongoing

2137
01:20:00,040 --> 01:20:01,240
that you've been tracking.

2138
01:20:01,240 --> 01:20:04,240
Well, I have been tracking a friend of the show,

2139
01:20:04,240 --> 01:20:06,120
Marissa Strickland and I regularly check in

2140
01:20:06,120 --> 01:20:08,920
and see what the status of yingling in Los Angeles is.

2141
01:20:08,920 --> 01:20:12,120
Cause there were some bars that would get kegs

2142
01:20:12,120 --> 01:20:14,840
and kind of serve it on the down low.

2143
01:20:14,840 --> 01:20:15,680
And this is your favorite.

2144
01:20:15,680 --> 01:20:17,040
And then they get in trouble.

2145
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:17,880
Oh, interesting.

2146
01:20:17,880 --> 01:20:19,600
And this is your favorite beer?

2147
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:20,920
One of your favorite beers?

2148
01:20:20,920 --> 01:20:22,040
I, yeah.

2149
01:20:22,040 --> 01:20:23,600
Have I had it with you?

2150
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:24,760
I think we've had, I mean,

2151
01:20:24,760 --> 01:20:27,400
it's pretty easy to get in like New York and Philadelphia.

2152
01:20:27,400 --> 01:20:29,760
And they have it all over Disney World.

2153
01:20:30,440 --> 01:20:31,280
Oh, really?

2154
01:20:31,280 --> 01:20:32,120
I've heard of it,

2155
01:20:32,120 --> 01:20:34,520
but I didn't realize it was such a thing.

2156
01:20:34,520 --> 01:20:37,880
Is it America's oldest brewery or one of the oldest?

2157
01:20:37,880 --> 01:20:38,720
Huh.

2158
01:20:38,720 --> 01:20:40,000
That's a mate like, oh really?

2159
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,560
I didn't know you get yingling at Disney World comments.

2160
01:20:42,560 --> 01:20:44,360
Yingling is the most popular beer.

2161
01:20:44,360 --> 01:20:46,480
This is a crucial beer I could do right now.

2162
01:20:46,480 --> 01:20:48,160
Well, I mean, the most, any time,

2163
01:20:48,160 --> 01:20:50,760
sometimes when it comes up, everyone sends the like,

2164
01:20:50,760 --> 01:20:52,920
well, and here's the one yingling son

2165
01:20:52,920 --> 01:20:54,320
with Donald Trump Jr.

2166
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:55,760
And it's like, yes, business owners

2167
01:20:55,760 --> 01:20:57,880
love to give Republicans money.

2168
01:20:57,880 --> 01:20:59,440
We know that.

2169
01:20:59,440 --> 01:21:01,400
That's all we've been talking about for weeks now.

2170
01:21:01,400 --> 01:21:02,240
Oh geez.

2171
01:21:02,240 --> 01:21:03,720
Sorry, you have to carry that crowd.

2172
01:21:03,720 --> 01:21:04,560
That's nice.

2173
01:21:05,960 --> 01:21:07,600
Where were we?

2174
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:08,760
Beverage distribution.

2175
01:21:08,760 --> 01:21:10,320
We were flossing up and then we ended up in yingling.

2176
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:13,240
I would love to get like a 16 ounce bottle

2177
01:21:13,240 --> 01:21:18,240
of like a Bebo or Viva or any of these things.

2178
01:21:18,680 --> 01:21:21,160
But I think it's probably just too chaotic to get it.

2179
01:21:21,160 --> 01:21:22,000
Even just a shirt.

2180
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:25,040
They should sell a Beverly shirt now, you know?

2181
01:21:25,040 --> 01:21:25,880
It's a good question.

2182
01:21:25,880 --> 01:21:26,700
Do they have Beverly shirt?

2183
01:21:26,700 --> 01:21:27,760
They have a lot of Coca-Cola,

2184
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:29,440
the Coke logo in different languages,

2185
01:21:29,440 --> 01:21:31,600
but I don't know that they have Beverly merch.

2186
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:33,200
They don't think they do.

2187
01:21:33,200 --> 01:21:35,840
But has anyone even on T public made a Beverly shirt?

2188
01:21:35,840 --> 01:21:36,960
I think there is that.

2189
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:38,400
Yeah, I think there's enough of a,

2190
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:41,600
so we would not be the first to attempt to.

2191
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:43,640
Oh, I don't want to, I don't want to cash in.

2192
01:21:43,640 --> 01:21:45,160
I just wanted to know if they had done it.

2193
01:21:45,160 --> 01:21:46,920
I mean, I know some of the soda,

2194
01:21:46,920 --> 01:21:48,440
like some of the sodas like, well,

2195
01:21:48,440 --> 01:21:50,240
we introduced this 15 years ago.

2196
01:21:50,240 --> 01:21:52,520
And like the reason they introduced it is cause like,

2197
01:21:52,520 --> 01:21:54,120
well, this soda in Brazil,

2198
01:21:54,120 --> 01:21:56,960
like based on this local fruit was very popular.

2199
01:21:56,960 --> 01:21:58,840
So Coke introduced a competitor.

2200
01:21:59,720 --> 01:22:01,640
I don't know that they're pumping out merchandise

2201
01:22:01,640 --> 01:22:03,920
for the soda where it was like, you got to try this.

2202
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:05,240
It fucking sucks.

2203
01:22:05,240 --> 01:22:07,800
You got to try the shitty one.

2204
01:22:07,800 --> 01:22:10,000
You got to try the prank soda.

2205
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:11,360
Yeah, probably not.

2206
01:22:12,280 --> 01:22:15,160
And start, you know, get Beverly in regular stores.

2207
01:22:15,160 --> 01:22:16,880
Why should we have to go to this place

2208
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:20,560
to have a shitty prank soda?

2209
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:21,400
Yeah.

2210
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:25,040
This should be a ability that we have for all occasions.

2211
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:27,880
You know, for all the people,

2212
01:22:27,880 --> 01:22:29,640
a prank we should be able to play

2213
01:22:29,640 --> 01:22:31,960
on all the loved ones in our lives.

2214
01:22:31,960 --> 01:22:34,600
Or whether it be our dad's birthday or a bachelor party,

2215
01:22:34,600 --> 01:22:38,120
we need to, we should be cheersing this shitty drink

2216
01:22:38,120 --> 01:22:38,960
all year round.

2217
01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:40,080
Human Beverly-ed.

2218
01:22:41,040 --> 01:22:42,880
Yes, what was the thing?

2219
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:45,360
What was the like, the Smirnoff,

2220
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:49,840
there was some like stupid soda challenge.

2221
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:51,480
Oh, you got iced.

2222
01:22:51,480 --> 01:22:52,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2223
01:22:52,320 --> 01:22:53,840
You got iced, you had a Smirnoff ice.

2224
01:22:53,880 --> 01:22:54,680
That's too easy.

2225
01:22:54,680 --> 01:22:56,440
Smirnoff ice tastes like candy

2226
01:22:56,440 --> 01:22:58,440
and it's like very easy to drink.

2227
01:22:58,440 --> 01:22:59,280
Right, right.

2228
01:22:59,280 --> 01:23:01,800
Yeah, yeah, that was a being a treat.

2229
01:23:01,800 --> 01:23:02,640
That's not a big deal.

2230
01:23:02,640 --> 01:23:03,480
Depending on your taste.

2231
01:23:03,480 --> 01:23:04,800
Yeah, yeah, but a Beverly is,

2232
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:06,960
drinking a whole bottle of Beverly is a slog

2233
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:08,240
and doing it without vomiting.

2234
01:23:08,240 --> 01:23:09,960
Oh yeah, the Beverly challenge.

2235
01:23:09,960 --> 01:23:11,880
But the next time any of us are in Vegas,

2236
01:23:11,880 --> 01:23:13,040
we should go check.

2237
01:23:13,040 --> 01:23:15,160
I mean, that is my preferred section of the strip

2238
01:23:15,160 --> 01:23:17,520
to stay in the Coca-Cola store.

2239
01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:18,360
The world of Coke.

2240
01:23:18,360 --> 01:23:23,200
To be across from the world of Coke and the Hard Rock Cafe

2241
01:23:23,200 --> 01:23:25,040
that is above a Marshall's.

2242
01:23:25,040 --> 01:23:28,440
You stay in there until the store closes

2243
01:23:28,440 --> 01:23:30,800
and get like, bring a sleeping bag up

2244
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:32,640
into the top of the big bottle.

2245
01:23:32,640 --> 01:23:34,040
Well, I gotta kiss the polar bear.

2246
01:23:34,040 --> 01:23:36,080
Good night. Good night.

2247
01:23:36,080 --> 01:23:37,080
Yeah.

2248
01:23:37,080 --> 01:23:39,080
All right, well, we'll all get a room in the world of Coke

2249
01:23:39,080 --> 01:23:40,240
soon enough.

2250
01:23:40,240 --> 01:23:45,080
As for now, you survived podcast the ride,

2251
01:23:45,080 --> 01:23:46,880
club cool edition.

2252
01:23:46,880 --> 01:23:51,120
I'm so glad we chilled out and kept it cool today.

2253
01:23:51,160 --> 01:23:53,960
You guys keep it cool day to day

2254
01:23:53,960 --> 01:23:57,200
and talk to you next time, I suppose.
