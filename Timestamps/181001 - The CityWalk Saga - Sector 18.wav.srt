1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Forever...

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Dog!

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
When your town has let you down

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
When your porch has fallen short

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
When you're too worn out to run

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
And need some ribs or a Cinnabon

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
You need a place, a place for rock

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
A place for roll, a place where Oakland Raiders merch is sold

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
A sublime hot topic and billabong

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
A place where you can purchase a candy thong

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
So let's go take a walk

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Let's all go to City Walk

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Tonight, tonight...

14
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
That's...

15
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
A lot of days, and I...

16
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
For me, this is the first time I don't go back and listen to the podcast so much.

17
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I so much don't want to hear my own voice.

18
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I have been listening to these, I think because the pressure's off.

19
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
They're less, they're more loose and less fact-based.

20
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,000
And I don't feel like I'm getting anything wrong or I'm not as worried about rambling or whatever,

21
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
because we're just talking about these inane experiences.

22
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
And I was getting pretty delighted around five or six.

23
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I wasn't like, oh, this isn't too much.

24
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
It's like fun and funny how much there are.

25
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
And right around 10, 11, I'm getting like this.

26
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Oh, now you're hitting a wall.

27
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
It is too much.

28
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Yeah, I've already hit the wall.

29
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I hit several walls recording them.

30
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Now I'm hitting a listening wall.

31
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Right.

32
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I listened to sectors two through six in one day just to help Mike with the QC-ing.

33
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And I was physically tired by the end of the day.

34
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Well, I was also writing the descriptions, prepping the descriptions and scheduling some posts.

35
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Got very, like I had to divide it up because it just gets so, it gets a little monotonous.

36
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I've had less to like, some of them I've had a lot of ideas of ancillary content.

37
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
And what was the one where I realized I had no ideas of what to tweet?

38
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I think it was the one with like, Skechers.

39
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Yeah, I did the same thing.

40
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It's really thin.

41
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Some of them are just thin.

42
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,000
And we don't, but that's I think the beauty of the sector division is you don't know,

43
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
some of them seem like they're going to be nothing and then there's so much there.

44
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
And others are cursed or yeah, some are barren.

45
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
But you know, before we go too much further, we should find out what today's lies,

46
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:39,000
what lies in store today and will it be full of material or a barren desert?

47
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Boys, boys, today's sector is sector 18, the Universal Hotels Hilton and Sheraton.

48
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Good luck, boys.

49
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Well, now I'm in your back.

50
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Jason's back too.

51
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
The hotels, baby.

52
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Yeah, I've been looking forward to this one the whole time.

53
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Oh, me too.

54
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
And research for this, not a chore.

55
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I've done plenty of research in the past.

56
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I, well, I have not.

57
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Well, no, I did actually one time for my birthday, Aaron got us a room at the Universal Hilton.

58
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
So I did stay at that one.

59
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:23,000
But Sheraton and I haven't stayed at, but I've spent many a night at these hotels wandering around.

60
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
And I'm just a hotel fan in general.

61
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Jason, I believe you have with your family stayed at.

62
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I have stayed at both multiple times.

63
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Wow.

64
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
How many times, if I may ask?

65
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I think two for the Sheraton and maybe four times.

66
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Really?

67
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Yeah.

68
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
And you just for the listener, you live within five minutes.

69
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Yes.

70
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I was going to give a street address.

71
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I walked over to City Walk sometimes.

72
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
If you DM me, I will give you Jason's street address.

73
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Hey, you stop that.

74
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Yes, I live close by.

75
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
But when my family comes to visit, it feels like more of a vacation for me if I stay with them.

76
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Wait a minute, though.

77
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
But you choose.

78
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Are you in the same room as them?

79
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
No, usually we get connected.

80
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I think the one time my mom came out just because it was their first time out here and I wanted to make sure they saw everything.

81
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
We got an early start.

82
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
That's the thing to avoid with me.

83
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,000
And I will go hang out with my parents at a hotel if I have my own space within it.

84
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
But being in the same room as them gets real.

85
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I think the very maybe the first time like 10 or 11 years ago when my dad first came out, we stayed in the same room.

86
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
But other times that he's gotten like two hotel rooms.

87
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Did you share a beer?

88
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
And was he like, I'm proud of you.

89
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Did you have a moment?

90
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I think we did.

91
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I did it at the late great rainforest cafe.

92
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I think was the first place we had some beers.

93
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
That was the first time you had a beer with you.

94
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I turned 21 when I was out here for school.

95
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Good morning, son.

96
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Oh, yeah.

97
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
We saw a concert where Ben Folds, the backstage had just had his first beer with his grandson.

98
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
With 18, with Louie, right?

99
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Wait, what's that?

100
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Louie is his son's name?

101
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I don't know.

102
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Louie and Gracie, I believe.

103
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
When I hear the name Louie, I just get a shiver.

104
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I think of the great Louie Anderson.

105
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
No other comedy Louies.

106
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Do you remember where you first had a beer with your dad or has it not happened?

107
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
He doesn't drink.

108
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
No drink.

109
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I see.

110
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
So not applicable.

111
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
We have had a sip of wine with him out in California.

112
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I mean, literally, I think he sipped, somebody put wine in front of us out here and I think he was just being polite and sipped some.

113
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
So that's as close as it's gotten.

114
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Okay.

115
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Yeah.

116
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I think I did it at an El Torito one time.

117
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
How old?

118
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Hills.

119
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:53,000
22, 23, something like that.

120
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Nice moments.

121
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
So sometimes we can talk about nice, meaningful things.

122
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Yeah, sure.

123
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Sure, yeah.

124
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
People like that.

125
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I think this one might be a more positive episode in general because we've all had a lot of good times at these hotels.

126
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I think the outing that we had, we did a little hotel bar hop, one of my favorite activities to do.

127
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:19,000
And I think this was one of the most pleasant CityWalk outings we've had the whole time,

128
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,000
partially because Aaron and Lindsay and tomorrow's guests were there.

129
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
That was a blast.

130
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:32,000
And that to me, that's kind of the heart of hotels and being cool and fun to explore.

131
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Those bars.

132
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I've been a noted hotel bar fan for a long time.

133
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I think partially because I've never taken to crowded Silver Lake at water downtown kind of places.

134
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I don't ever understand why do you want to be in a crowded, loud bar?

135
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Why you ever want to be shouting over music?

136
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
It doesn't make any sense to me.

137
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:02,000
And hotels are just naturally soothing, often 75% empty.

138
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
They're wonderful.

139
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
They're relaxing.

140
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:12,000
And you also, as you've had staycations essentially with your parents when they come into town,

141
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:19,000
to even go spend a couple hours in a hotel, you get that little endorphin of vacation feeling without even leaving your city.

142
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:28,000
And there's like, there's two, this is going to sound weird, but there's a level of anonymity at hotel or discretion.

143
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Like sort of like, yeah, it's its own little contained, you can kind of disappear.

144
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
You forget about the outside world a little.

145
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
You mean like, you know, if you feel like you check your troubles at the door.

146
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I think so.

147
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
That may just be me.

148
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I'm sure there's plenty of people who don't like hotels.

149
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Certainly with the...

150
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I can't imagine who hates hotels.

151
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I know some people seem to gravitate more towards Airbnbs, which I find a little...

152
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I don't care.

153
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I'm fine with it.

154
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I'll stay in an Airbnb.

155
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Don't care for it though.

156
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I find it very utilitarian.

157
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I also don't like sleeping in someone's bed.

158
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I don't like it.

159
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I don't like sleeping in a stranger's bed.

160
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I know plenty of strangers stay in a hotel, but for whatever reason, I don't associate that with.

161
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I think it's become a necessity that people do Airbnb financially.

162
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
And that makes sense.

163
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:20,000
It's often a way, especially if you're spending more than a week, if you're spending a long time out of town.

164
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:26,000
And that to me also is why like just going to a hotel in your city and hanging out there for a while,

165
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
you get that little fix without spending a ton of money.

166
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
And maybe a fix you haven't had for a long time.

167
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Probably a lot of us more likely spend a lot of time at hotels as kids.

168
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,000
We're with our parents who had money and were willing to splash around.

169
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Not to make any assumptions.

170
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
But yeah, you're a vacation club kind of guy.

171
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Oh yeah.

172
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
We would always stay at hotels in Florida.

173
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I don't think I had an appreciation for the hotel bar though until I started going to Comic-Con for multiple days.

174
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
It's a big part of the culture.

175
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Because you try to get into big parties.

176
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
And once in a while, I like some insane thing.

177
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Because on Comic-Con on occasion, I can sneak in somewhere and there's like acrobats and the music's way too loud.

178
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Maybe it's an open bar.

179
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
And like that's fun to see that.

180
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,000
But you know, one of the best traditions of Comic-Con is going to that Hyatt bar.

181
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Oh yeah.

182
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Is the Hyatt at the top of the...

183
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Well, I usually it's...

184
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I like that.

185
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
You and I shared a sunset at that Hyatt.

186
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
We had a romantic sunset.

187
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Two or three years ago.

188
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Staring at John Lennon quotes written on the glass.

189
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Yes, but I'm more referring to the low level or the first level.

190
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
The lobby bar.

191
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Thank you.

192
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
The lobby bar.

193
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Where the old comics perl.

194
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Old comics writers and artists are just hanging out there and you go and get a little table.

195
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
And that's a nice tradition of Comic-Con for the last, God, maybe seven years now.

196
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Where the legends and the riff-raff can meet and mingle.

197
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
It's pretty actually cool.

198
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
But it's great.

199
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Yeah, I totally agree.

200
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I had more fun at that.

201
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Comic-Con, it's so strange, all that, the kind of jostling to get on the list and are you on the list?

202
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
No, you should be in this line and then you get in there and there's nowhere to move.

203
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I remember the first time I went to Comic-Con, there was a bunch of that.

204
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
And there was a party at the Hard Rock Hotel down there.

205
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Oh, it's impossible.

206
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
It's impossible.

207
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Four knocks.

208
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Lockdown.

209
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Yeah, yeah.

210
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Seventh Hard Rock episode where I reference Hard Rock.

211
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
We're going to keep climbing them up.

212
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
But it was whatever this party was, was promised to be star studded.

213
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:40,000
They'd wait till you when you were mingling with the top tier talent in Hollywood up there.

214
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,000
And the one recognizable figure was Wolf from American Gladiators.

215
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Is that the correct name or was he named like Coyote or something?

216
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
He's a real sweetheart.

217
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Oh, really?

218
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
He was like the nicest guy.

219
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Jason was a PA or an intern?

220
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I was an audience page, which became like a catch-all for Do Anything.

221
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
So you knew Wolf?

222
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Yes.

223
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Wolf was very...all the Gladiators were nice.

224
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
That's good.

225
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
You didn't get to have a beer with Wolf though.

226
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Wolf didn't say he was proud of you.

227
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
No, we had some late nights.

228
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I think that might have been the latest I've ever spent on a studio lot,

229
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
is I spent 21 hours straight on the Sony lot once.

230
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
How much did you get paid for that day?

231
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Did you get overtime?

232
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I think I did get overtime.

233
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Okay.

234
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
It did get overtime because...

235
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
At least double time.

236
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I double time if it's 21 hours.

237
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
It was definitely double time at a certain point, but it was writer strike filler.

238
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
And so they were churning stuff out.

239
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
They were throwing money at these reality shows.

240
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Right after that, the arena was converted into, I believe, the set for My Dad Is Better Than Your Dad,

241
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,000
which is, as I say that out now, it's such a bad taste of my mouth that that was a TV show.

242
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
You find that offensive?

243
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Yeah, I find it kind of a poor taste.

244
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Everyone's dad has their good qualities.

245
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
We shouldn't be judging dads one second one against each other.

246
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Yeah, I know.

247
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Give them a break.

248
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Can you imagine being in that scenario where that phrase comes out of your mouth and you mean it?

249
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Awful.

250
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Yeah.

251
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:08,000
What if things had gone the wrong way on our night of hotel bar drinking,

252
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
and we were all shouting that at each other?

253
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Oh, yeah.

254
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Yeah, that would have really devolved.

255
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
What a nightmare.

256
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Let's put all of our dads at an official truce right now.

257
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
They're at a truce.

258
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Yeah.

259
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I agree.

260
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
So where were we going with all that?

261
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Wolf, Comic-Con, hotels, hotel bars.

262
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Hotel bars.

263
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Affection for hotels.

264
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Great spots, room to breathe, oxygen to the brain, and we did a little tour of both of them,

265
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
and maybe we should go in the order that we hit them up.

266
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Sure.

267
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Now, is, okay, not to question the sector keeper's logic,

268
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Right.

269
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,000
but I have no problem, obviously, with talking about these places

270
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
and them being part of the City Walk saga,

271
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,000
would you really consider these part of City Walk?

272
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Well, yeah, I mean, it's part of the resort overall, so it is.

273
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
You can make an argument either way.

274
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,000
If City Walk is just in the boundaries of that map,

275
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
but on the map, are the hotels sort of indicated or no?

276
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I don't think they're on the map.

277
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I forget.

278
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
If they're not on the map.

279
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Not in like an Alaska and Hawaii kind of thing in the corner?

280
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Yeah, they're not just separate.

281
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I mean, probably not technically on City Walk because they're not connected to the street.

282
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:28,000
But I guess the further we question this, we would be robbing the sector keeper of strength.

283
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Right, and he needs that going into this final one.

284
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
He's almost there.

285
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
We're kicking him out of the finish line.

286
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Not kicking him, no, that would take strength away.

287
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
No.

288
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Okay, let's put him up on a pedestal.

289
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
The sector keeper's wonderful.

290
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
The hotels are wonderful.

291
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I'm glad to be talking about them.

292
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
So, but if you are leaving City Walk,

293
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
actually we started our journey around the globe, like around the park,

294
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,000
and then we went kind of back the far way to the east of the property,

295
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
but now we're going all the way back to the west.

296
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:02,000
So if you're leaving the theme park and you go from the fountain,

297
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,000
you have to like walk on side streets or through this weird pedestrian bridge

298
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
to get over to the Hilton.

299
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
And the Hilton's the one more atop the hill.

300
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
It's higher up and it's the more recently added hotel.

301
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
It was added in the 80s and the Sheraton is,

302
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I'm really putting a T on Sheraton because it's confusing because you're Sheraton.

303
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Yeah, I don't see anything from this hotel chain.

304
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Oh, you're not an heir?

305
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
My family sees no benefit.

306
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Yeah.

307
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Sorry to hear that.

308
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
You've tried, but no one's going to...

309
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Oh yeah, I've tried, yeah.

310
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
You've tried to claim you're a long lost child of the Sheraton family.

311
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Yeah, that didn't work.

312
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I remember claiming I was DB Cooper's son didn't work.

313
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
You know, you got to try some cons to get ahead in this town.

314
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I got to see if I can claim that I'm,

315
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
if I started claiming I'm Scott Starwood to try to get Starwood awards points.

316
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Oh, well, you know, the family keeps growing.

317
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
The Starwood family keeps growing.

318
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
At the very least, that's a good professional wrestling name.

319
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Ooh, yeah.

320
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Yeah.

321
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I'll file that away.

322
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Scott Starwood, the heir to the Starwood hotel chain.

323
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
So anyways, this one was added, this is the second hotel added at Universal.

324
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
It was added in the 80s.

325
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
And to really get it into my wheelhouse,

326
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I want to talk about the architect of this hotel because I think this place is beautiful.

327
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
This is like exactly my aesthetic.

328
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:32,000
It's steel and big brass poles and those, like that super reflective glass and giant atriums.

329
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
It just makes me...

330
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Multiple atriums.

331
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Yes, there's so many atriums.

332
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,000
And that walk that you can do, kind of the way you end up entering,

333
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
because the official entrance is on the other side, like closer to the freeway into the hill.

334
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
That's where the cars enter from.

335
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,000
But as a pedestrian, you get to go through all these weird empty ballrooms.

336
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I mean, I'm sure they're not always empty.

337
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:58,000
But typically late at night, there's no weddings going on or anything.

338
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
But like, yeah, amazing grand event spaces and chandeliers.

339
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Huge chandeliers.

340
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Lift drivers, very easy to confuse.

341
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Lift drivers of where the hotel lobby or where they should pick you up.

342
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Yeah, yeah.

343
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Because if you type in...

344
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
At least this used to be the case.

345
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I was up there once and called for a lift.

346
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:24,000
And the button, the like pin drops when you look up Sheraton or Universal Hilton,

347
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
it drops by the ballrooms.

348
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
It doesn't drop by the lobby.

349
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Okay, very confusing.

350
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
So, yeah.

351
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I think Aaron and Cheryl were getting there.

352
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:38,000
And then when we picked up a lift on the way back, the lift driver said,

353
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
so you guys from out of town?

354
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Oh, no, we were just hanging out at the hotel.

355
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Okay.

356
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Are you like visiting friends from out of town?

357
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
No.

358
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
So what were you doing there?

359
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
We were just like at the bar.

360
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Oh, really?

361
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
So they have a good bar?

362
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Is it like, what is it like, you know, like good prices?

363
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Is it kind of cheap?

364
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
No, no, absolutely not.

365
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Way more expensive than it would be at a regular bar.

366
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Oh, silence.

367
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Rest of the ride.

368
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
It is a little hard to explain.

369
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:11,000
But as we'll get to, that is not an uncommon thing to do for the Sheraton bar,

370
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
or at least it didn't used to be.

371
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Wait, what do you mean?

372
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
It used to be a big haunt for people to hang out.

373
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Including one notable luminary who we'll get to.

374
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Oh, yes.

375
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I think a lot of people would...

376
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
One famous denizen of the Sheraton and the Sheraton bar.

377
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I think a lot of people would go, the articles I read seem to indicate that people would go and watch games.

378
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
It seemed like...

379
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
And the bar.

380
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
It was really happening.

381
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Yeah.

382
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
But let's let me talk about another luminary for a second.

383
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,000
William Pereira is the architect of this, of the Universal Hilton.

384
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:46,000
And let me just list some of the other things that he, or perhaps his firm, it might not all be literally this man.

385
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,000
But William Pereira, one of the great architects, we talked about John Jertie who built CityWalk.

386
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,000
He's one of those figures I've looked up and found very cool to read.

387
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
But you just like, some of these people, you look at their works and your jaw drops.

388
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
How could this all have been the same person?

389
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
And his is one of the craziest.

390
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
The main one, the main feather in his cap, the LAX theme building.

391
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Which is that central Jetsons pod, that LAX.

392
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
That's cool.

393
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Which at one point had a Disney alien bar on the top of it.

394
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
The accountant.

395
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Yes.

396
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Yeah.

397
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Which that thing is like the only pleasant aspect of LAX.

398
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
It's like the only thing that makes you okay with being there.

399
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,000
That you get to see this cool, bizarre piece of architecture.

400
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I think, I believe there was a Beck tour where he used that, a picture of that as a backdrop.

401
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Oh, I'm sure.

402
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I mean that is so much shorthand in pop culture.

403
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I feel like this is shorthand for, you're in LA now.

404
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Here's the weird airport for this weird city of stars and celebs.

405
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Yeah, it gets you in the state that LA is a little bit kooky.

406
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
It's different.

407
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Like you just landed in a UFO.

408
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
You're not going to recognize, you landed in the UFO.

409
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I'm getting confused by my own point here.

410
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Some of these celebs do seem like aliens.

411
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Am I right, fellas?

412
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
If there's any truth to Men in Black.

413
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Men in Black too.

414
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Sure.

415
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Some of the other things this guy's built, the Geisel Library named after Dr. Seuss.

416
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:23,000
This crazy abstract, brutalist library at UCSD in San Diego where Aaron went.

417
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
If anybody knows this offhand, what I'm talking about, it looks like an Escher painting.

418
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
It's totally insane.

419
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
The Transamerica Pyramid in San Francisco, also this guy.

420
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Big famous San Francisco pyramid.

421
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
The Disneyland Hotel was this guy.

422
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,000
The original Carthay Circle was this guy.

423
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Not just the theme park, but the real restaurant that is now.

424
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
The theater.

425
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Yes.

426
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Oh yeah, it was a theater, not a restaurant.

427
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:51,000
The original place that now is the main landmark at California, but it's sorely needed.

428
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
The original architecture was by this guy.

429
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Also built CommuniCorps at Epcot.

430
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Really?

431
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Yes.

432
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I get a pretty Epcot-y vibe from this universal.

433
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:05,000
It definitely seems like a lost pavilion and a very tall one at that.

434
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:10,000
This guy, indelible influence on theme park world and theme park architecture,

435
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,000
and did awesome stuff in the 60s, 70s, and 80s.

436
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Also built most of Irvine and Newport Beach.

437
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Almost every primary building in those weird cities.

438
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:29,000
If his works are Beck albums, what would this Hotel Universal be?

439
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Carthay was early, cool one out of the gate.

440
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
That's Mellow Gold.

441
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:41,000
LAX theme building, just primary classic, so that's Odellay.

442
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Bizarre experimental one is the Geisel Library, and that would be Midnight Vultures.

443
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Then the acoustic ones, maybe those are more functional buildings.

444
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Those are just buildings that work well and keep people inside calm.

445
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Irvine is the whole of Irvine.

446
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Is it just Sea Change?

447
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Yeah.

448
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Too sad for me, Sea Change.

449
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
That's true.

450
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
That's the breakup album.

451
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Beautiful album art, though.

452
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:18,000
You never want to return to Sea Change, actively put it on.

453
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I'll go in just on Lost Cause once in a while, but I don't do the whole one.

454
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,000
That's the one little bit of, boy, that one gets grim.

455
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:32,000
I don't know that William Pereira built a prison or anything,

456
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
but maybe that would be Sea Change if he ever constructed a prison.

457
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Also, Beck doing pretty great work here later in his career.

458
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I thought Colors was cool.

459
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
He's had singles recently.

460
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Beck's staying relevant decades in, just like William Pereira,

461
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,000
the final building this guy built, and it was opened after his death,

462
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
but the last one that he worked on, Fox Plaza,

463
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,000
the biggest skyscraper on the 20th century Fox Club, which of course,

464
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Nakatomi Plaza from Die Hard.

465
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Also this guy.

466
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Insane.

467
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
That list is so crazy.

468
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
That really is crazy.

469
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Staying relevant, just like Beck.

470
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Just like Beck.

471
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Yeah.

472
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I would love to keep doing these architects as albums.

473
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,000
This is a real wheelhouse for me, and thanks for setting me up.

474
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
But anyway, we're talking about the hill.

475
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
I don't know which, Beck.

476
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
It's just a random, Beck.

477
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
This is One Foot in the Grave.

478
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
It's in there. I don't know.

479
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
What came after Midnight Vultures?

480
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Sea Change.

481
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
What was before Midnight Vultures?

482
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Did it also start with that?

483
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Mutations.

484
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:46,000
I always confuse those too, because they're back to back.

485
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,000
He was kind of going back and forth of like acoustic and electric one,

486
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
and then it all kind of melded in the middle.

487
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Although the one has a very distinct, abstract, weird cover,

488
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
and the other is just a picture of him, if I remember correctly.

489
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Yeah, that's true.

490
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
It's just kind of a cool GQ photo.

491
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:09,000
And we have now established that we know about one band past 1981.

492
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Aerosmith.

493
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Oh, yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

494
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Which is kind of where it started in the 70s.

495
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
We'll do an Aerosmith equivalent.

496
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
So we'll compare Aerosmith to the works of Bob Gurr.

497
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
We'll do that whole crowd section at some point.

498
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Look out for that chart on our Twitter.

499
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
But let's talk about the stuff inside the building.

500
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:30,000
We had an excellent night at one of the probably the grandest atrium

501
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:37,000
in all of the Hilton, which I've seen referred to as just the atrium bar,

502
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
but I also saw menus calling it 21 and over.

503
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Very catchy.

504
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
But the Sierra Cafe is at the sit down restaurant with the buffet.

505
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Yes.

506
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Okay.

507
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,000
And that is, I mean, I had been to the bar before, but I've eaten at the buffet.

508
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
My mom and stepdad love buffets.

509
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:58,000
So when they checked in and saw there was a seafood buffet and a breakfast buffet,

510
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
we hit up both the last time they visited.

511
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Wow.

512
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
And I think that is an interesting part of this hotel.

513
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:10,000
I mean, Universal Studios Hollywood caters to a large international tourism crowd.

514
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
So I just remember the first day we went to that breakfast buffet,

515
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
and there's all the American breakfast go-tos,

516
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:20,000
and then there was baked beans and cooked tomatoes for the British tourists.

517
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
And then there was also like pork shumai,

518
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,000
and this is the first and only place I've ever had jellyfish salad.

519
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:32,000
So I think those were some of the more geared more towards the Asian population.

520
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
You had it.

521
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Yeah.

522
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
And it kind of tasted like gummy worm salad.

523
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
It didn't have a huge flavor.

524
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
It had more of like a soy sauce flavor.

525
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
It was just kind of gummy.

526
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Strange.

527
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
But it was a strange mix.

528
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
And then at night, at least on the weekends,

529
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:50,000
very decked out like giant sculpture filled with shrimp,

530
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
multiple prime rib carving station.

531
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Like it's a lot.

532
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
It's very intense.

533
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
You're going to your happy place.

534
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Yeah.

535
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Just remembering.

536
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
How was it? Do you remember?

537
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
It was pretty good.

538
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:08,000
I am more of a, you know, I like to sit and I like buffets in theory,

539
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:13,000
but sometimes the quantity over quality can be a little overwhelming.

540
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
But it was a fun experience.

541
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
You can't control the quality of each food that way.

542
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:23,000
You know, so like half the stuff is OK or even more sometimes depending on the buffet.

543
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Yeah.

544
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
And we didn't but we did not eat there.

545
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,000
We ate in the lounge bar and which, you know,

546
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
there's nothing much to talk about food wise there.

547
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:38,000
You guys split a pizza, a burger is just largely basic stuff.

548
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
But we need to talk about Jason's meal.

549
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Oh, yes.

550
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Which you knew this would be discussed.

551
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Yeah, absolutely.

552
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
This should be half the show.

553
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Yeah.

554
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Yeah.

555
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
So I was looking at I mean, they had a lot of interest.

556
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
It was a surprisingly large menu for a lobby bar.

557
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
And not that pricey.

558
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:59,000
I mean, still more expensive than the quality you get, but a little marked up.

559
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,000
But not the worst you ever found in a hotel.

560
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
But I was hungry, but not that hungry.

561
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,000
And sometimes when that happens, I like to just have dessert.

562
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:15,000
So I walked into the bar and got the dessert menu and just ordered the apple strudel.

563
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Right. With the ice cream.

564
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
It came with ice cream on it.

565
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
And it was delicious.

566
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Giant slice of apple strudel.

567
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Big thing of vanilla ice cream.

568
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
And then some sort of like I don't know if it was a condensed milk sauce,

569
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,000
but there was a very sweet like cream sauce on top.

570
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Milk sauce.

571
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,000
So we all, of course, had a nice laugh and Jason had dessert.

572
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Ha ha.

573
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
We were all eating.

574
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Not that what we're eating is some gourmet perfectly nutritious thing.

575
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
It's just bread and cheese.

576
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Someone had a Caesar salad.

577
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Someone had like some bites.

578
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Small bites from the appetizers.

579
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:59,000
So I just to ask what your day had been like, I said, what else have you eaten today?

580
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Oh, yeah.

581
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
So like you were saying you were full.

582
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
So I said, well, what's been the meals today?

583
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,000
So if you wouldn't mind repeating what you ate on Friday.

584
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
I had lunch with friend of the show, Marissa Strickland.

585
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,000
I had some sort of breakfast sandwich at a cafe.

586
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
It was like bacon, egg and cheese and like braised greens.

587
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Pretty standard.

588
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Pretty standard, tasty.

589
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
You know, a place with avocado toast on the menu all day.

590
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Kind of one of those cafes.

591
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Right. And then to say what your next meal was.

592
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
I was a little hungry when I got home.

593
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:33,000
I was stuck in traffic for a while and I just had some cookies and milk as a snack.

594
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Uh huh. So breakfast, breakfast sandwich, lunch, cookies and milk, dinner, apple strudel and a big ice cream.

595
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
And a vodka soda.

596
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
And a vodka soda.

597
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
With a few limes.

598
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Now I decided to ask another question that everyone I think would want to know.

599
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,000
I said, what kind of milk are we talking here?

600
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
And you said.

601
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Whole milk.

602
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Whole milk because the current thinking is that whole milk is better because it, it usually, I believe it's, it's more protein.

603
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,000
It makes you feel more, a little more protein, a little more milk fat in there.

604
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,000
It's going to fill you up and trick you into eating less.

605
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:21,000
That's why it's recommended for babies.

606
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,000
And what cookies were you dunking in the milk?

607
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Oh, those ones that you get at like supermarkets that are like kind of a chewy sugar cookie with like a chunk of icing on top, like neon icing on top.

608
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,000
And they were neon icing specific because this sounds like a thing I would want to buy.

609
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
But also already kind of a soft cookie.

610
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
So to dunk.

611
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Already kind of a soft cookie.

612
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Yeah.

613
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Because a chocolate chip seems.

614
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Didn't it disintegrate instantly?

615
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:46,000
No.

616
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
And frosted in there?

617
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Because it was a hardy cookie.

618
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:53,000
I just only, I feel like I do something with a chocolate component.

619
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Chocolate chips, Oreos.

620
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Absolutely.

621
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,000
If I dunk cookies in milk once every four years.

622
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,000
But this is a, is this a frequent occurrence for you?

623
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Yes, but I usually have chocolate chip in the house.

624
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
I see.

625
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:14,000
And when we say frequent, six times a month.

626
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Frequent cookies and milk?

627
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Yeah.

628
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,000
How often a month, how many times a month are you indulging in cookies and milk?

629
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Well, sometimes I'll just have a cookie when I'm just puttering around the house.

630
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
But that's not what I'm talking about.

631
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
I'm talking about you making cookies and milk.

632
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Sitting down with cookies and milk.

633
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Or literally making a meal of it.

634
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Maybe like, oh, making a meal of it.

635
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Usually before like after dinner or before bed.

636
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Maybe like a handful of times a month.

637
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Five?

638
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Five, yeah, sure.

639
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Six?

640
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Five, six sounds reasonable.

641
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
And do you.

642
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
If I have cookies in the house, I'll probably have a cookie every day though.

643
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
I get that.

644
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,000
I think there's something different about doing the setup, creating the little Santa

645
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
display.

646
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
That is the difference.

647
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
That's what I'm wondering.

648
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:59,000
This was definitely, I was looking at what I was in the house and I didn't really feel

649
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,000
like having a grill at the bar and I was like, oh, I'll have some cookies and milk.

650
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Because we were also trying to figure out when to meet up.

651
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,000
I wasn't sure when I was going to eat again, but I didn't.

652
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Right.

653
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
I'd had a very salty lunch, so I wanted something more sweet.

654
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
And is it a tall glass of milk?

655
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,000
No, usually like a rocks glass size.

656
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
What's a rock?

657
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Like a whiskey glass or something basically?

658
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Yeah.

659
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:25,000
And then do you end up using all the milk for the cookies or do you end up drinking?

660
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
No, I drink what's left.

661
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Yeah.

662
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
But is there a lot left?

663
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Usually.

664
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:33,000
OK, so it's not like you're completely submerging the cookie in each time you're going in for

665
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
a bite.

666
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
No, I'm pretty light dunk.

667
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
So light?

668
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
OK, so it's a light dunk and then you're just finishing the glass.

669
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
I'm just finishing the glass and I'll usually have some water with it too.

670
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
OK.

671
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:51,000
But let's also the other meal revelation because since earlier in the series, we just we there

672
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
was.

673
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Are you talking about the hot dogs?

674
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
There was the hot dog revelation.

675
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Right.

676
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,640
And the hot dog situation was recapped and in such a way that it made it seem almost a

677
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:03,320
little more reasonable than when it came up for the first time on the show.

678
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:04,320
And you almost made it.

679
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,320
I almost made it.

680
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:06,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

681
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,320
Out the door until you explained.

682
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:11,000
And then, wait, and then I shared a trick that Mike knew of.

683
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,200
It's like if you want to microwave a hot dog, the way to do it is you wrap it in a wet paper

684
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,840
towel so it kind of de facto steams it.

685
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,640
And I accidentally added on.

686
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:21,120
So if you need something quick and you're in a rush.

687
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,120
Yes.

688
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:25,880
And I didn't think that's I still don't think that's so you sometimes you plan your day

689
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:28,240
raw or like you're running late and you wait.

690
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,280
So you're running late.

691
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:32,920
So oh, God, I have almost no time left.

692
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:35,760
Better cook this hot dog in the microwave really quickly.

693
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:39,400
If you want some protein and you want something hot.

694
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,680
So are you so then you throw it in a bun.

695
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:42,940
Do you have buns on hand?

696
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:44,320
We actually didn't even get into that.

697
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:48,040
That's usually no, because I usually have I always buy bread.

698
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:50,840
OK, so just a regular slice of bread.

699
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:53,000
Yeah, a regular slice of bread.

700
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
It's OK.

701
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,400
That's this is the worst detail to me.

702
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:59,760
As a child, I hated hot dog with regular bread.

703
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,320
You don't want to buy hot dog.

704
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:02,320
No.

705
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,240
Well, the hot dog buns are the lowest form of bread.

706
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:07,720
Hot dog buns is like 99 cents.

707
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:14,120
So I usually will get like a sourdough or a potato bread or a wheat bread.

708
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,120
You're OK.

709
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,480
The quality thing makes sense to me.

710
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:21,720
But doesn't it like am I the only person who like those things have always been they they

711
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:22,880
cancel each other out.

712
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,600
I didn't use to like it either when it was like Wonder Bread.

713
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:31,160
But if it's slightly it's a bit if it's a better bread, you can also butterfly it.

714
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:36,200
You can butterfly the hot dog, cut it down the middle, flatten it and make like a sandwich.

715
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,280
Oh, I see what you're saying.

716
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,280
You get it.

717
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,280
We are.

718
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:42,960
For some reason, I've always just like cut up pieces of hot dog.

719
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,720
I don't like splitting it down the middle.

720
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:45,720
Yeah, it's less fun.

721
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:50,280
If you go to like a beer hall sort of German restaurant, some of their sausages, they'll

722
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:55,160
they'll butterfly and put between two slices of thick sourdough bread that you knew that

723
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:57,960
you knew the verb on the butterfly, the hot dog.

724
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:00,800
Yeah, I don't think that's a crazy turn.

725
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,920
You do home butterflying.

726
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:07,040
But if you don't have time, you just wrap it like a dumpling in a paper towel.

727
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:10,640
Well, and when I was younger, I briefly experimented because I saw this on the spoon.

728
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:13,920
I was experimenting in college.

729
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:17,360
My experiment was trying to cook hot dogs and butter.

730
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,360
Uh huh.

731
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,560
And it is very good.

732
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:25,080
It was like a comfort food episode of one of the but you know, I don't really do that

733
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:28,600
anymore because hot dogs or sausage are usually there's enough grease.

734
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,240
Don't really do it anymore.

735
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:31,240
But have you at all?

736
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:32,600
Once in a while, do it butter.

737
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:33,600
No, not really.

738
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,600
I don't really.

739
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,600
It's too.

740
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,600
It's too much.

741
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,600
Hmm.

742
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,680
OK, well, I think I'm on a question for now.

743
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:41,560
I think we can go back to the hotels.

744
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,560
Yeah.

745
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,400
And I feel a little bad that this is a bit of an inquisition.

746
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:47,000
You're literally in the corner of the room and we're all pointing.

747
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Yeah.

748
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
And asking.

749
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,760
But the first hot dog revelation was one of my favorite parts of the saga.

750
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,800
And there was more meat on the bone.

751
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:58,840
Just something to me about if you're in a rush, the quick hot dog.

752
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:01,720
If you're eating hot dogs, there's no bone to worry about.

753
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:05,040
It's just meat.

754
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:10,960
You mainly eat hot dogs six times a month because of, you know, part of it is I really

755
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,320
rarely buy raw meat.

756
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,320
I, I. Yeah.

757
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:17,440
I rarely buy raw chicken.

758
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,440
I buy deli meat.

759
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,440
Yeah.

760
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:24,320
Deli meat or I usually had pepperoni or salami growing up, grew up in heavy, heavily Italian

761
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,440
neighborhoods.

762
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:30,260
I don't think I ever went to a Jewish deli until I was like in high school.

763
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:32,880
My conception of a deli was like an Italian deli.

764
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,880
When was the last time you bought Scrapple?

765
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:38,480
I don't think I personally have ever bought Scrapple.

766
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,480
Okay.

767
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:42,960
And in not, I think there's one or two butchers in LA that'll do it.

768
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,040
Let's keep it that way.

769
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:49,520
The next time we have some kind of live appearance or something, I want, I want a fan to bring

770
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:55,080
Jason Scrapple as a gift for all of the episodes we've given you.

771
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,400
Which is another East coast thing.

772
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,400
Borg roll.

773
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,720
Or Taylor Ham as it's sometimes called.

774
00:35:58,720 --> 00:35:59,720
Yeah.

775
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:00,720
Which is not fun.

776
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:04,240
I want fans coming with either soaps or Scrapple.

777
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,440
Scrapple is usually a raw loaf.

778
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,640
So be careful with that.

779
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,520
Oh, you don't have to eat it.

780
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:11,520
Get it fresh.

781
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,520
Get it fresh.

782
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:13,520
Get the Scrapple fresh hours before the show.

783
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,000
I just want to see the exchange.

784
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Yeah.

785
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,360
Although you're going to be tempted if free Scrapple comes your way.

786
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:22,760
Well, I'm going to want to cook a big meal for everyone, you know.

787
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:23,760
When we're doing these shows.

788
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:24,760
For all the fans.

789
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:25,760
For all the, no, for you guys.

790
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:26,760
So if you guys get experience.

791
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:30,800
That's the live show I like is Jason Cook's Scrapple and hot dogs for everybody.

792
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,360
And we don't talk about theme parks at all.

793
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:36,160
Live show, that is the one thing I've been asking.

794
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:39,220
When it comes to live shows, more labor, please.

795
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:41,440
More preparation required.

796
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,160
Now you cater our live shows.

797
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,160
Now I cater them.

798
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,560
Let our fans bring the ingredients.

799
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:47,560
And that balances out the workload.

800
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:49,440
I guess that's true.

801
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:52,560
Anyway, the universal Hilton Hotel.

802
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,560
Right, go back to this.

803
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:54,560
Yes.

804
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:57,040
What else is there to say about this?

805
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,760
Several television episodes filmed up there.

806
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:05,240
There was a Beverly Hills 90210 season one episode called the Spring Dance.

807
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:08,360
And the Spring Dance took place at the Universal Hilton.

808
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:11,520
It's mainly a darkened ballroom so you don't get to see a lot of that sweet architecture.

809
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:16,560
But you see the fountain outside while Gabrielle Carteris shows up.

810
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:22,480
And you can, with the view of the valley behind them, you get a sense of how this was the

811
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,160
height of luxury in 1991.

812
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:31,640
Also, this is where Jerry and George stayed in the two part episode, The Trip, where they

813
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:35,920
come to LA, which of Seinfeld, I probably didn't say Seinfeld.

814
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:41,520
Jerry and George stay there in the quest to find Kramer that ends up leading to the, wait,

815
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:44,240
is that separate from when they get the TV show?

816
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,240
I'm not totally sure.

817
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:50,960
Kramer is to try his luck in LA and then he gets for the people think he's a murderer?

818
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:54,080
Yeah, but that has nothing to do with the getting of the TV show.

819
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,360
Of the Jerry show.

820
00:37:55,360 --> 00:38:00,560
Anyway, point is, they show an exterior shot of the Universal Hilton, which makes me happy

821
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,560
to see.

822
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:02,560
I'll skip the rest of the episode.

823
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:03,560
I just want to see that lobby.

824
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:08,320
But then it goes to Jerry in the room and there's a window and there is an ocean view

825
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,440
in the window.

826
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:13,080
But there would not be an ocean view at the Universal Hilton.

827
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:16,640
This was an egregious error on the part of the makers of Seinfeld.

828
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:19,520
And the show is dead to me forever now.

829
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,280
No more Seinfeld ever again.

830
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,560
No more Seinfeld for me.

831
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:28,400
I feel like these hotels are used a lot in filming, especially Universal owned stuff

832
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,400
because it's easier, it's easy to coordinate.

833
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:35,360
I feel like I've seen at least the Sheraton in an episode of The Office or two.

834
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,360
Oh, perhaps.

835
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:39,880
You can also dress these as like hotels in anywhere USA.

836
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:40,880
Yes, true.

837
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,840
If it's just a ballroom or a generic kind of lobby.

838
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:45,080
And it's right in the backyard of Hollywood.

839
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:49,200
And I don't want to skip around too much, but this does seem like a perfect opportunity

840
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,200
to take us.

841
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:57,080
Well, first of all, let's take the outside elevator down the parking garage to the Sheraton.

842
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:58,680
So here's how it works.

843
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:04,800
You exit the Hilton through like halfway to the ballroom part of the hotel.

844
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,120
By the Peet's Coffee.

845
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:07,120
Yes.

846
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:13,480
You exit at a pretty arbitrary unlabeled point and you go to just a very minimal elevator

847
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:17,360
bank and you press the button and you wait for a very long time.

848
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:23,160
But then you get in a glass elevator with a beautiful view, with the same view that

849
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:26,280
the 90210 gang got.

850
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:29,040
I really honestly am recommending this.

851
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:32,160
And that takes you down the parking garage.

852
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,720
And that's a fun little ride.

853
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:41,360
I think you guys are with me that, especially glass elevator rides or like little bonus

854
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:43,160
rides outside of parks.

855
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:45,520
I like when they show up in hotels.

856
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,640
I like when they're in malls.

857
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:50,600
It gives me a little ride fix without paying an admission.

858
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:53,600
Yeah, I would have completely agree with that.

859
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:56,160
I like going between the hotels.

860
00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:02,880
I think it's not labeled well, but if you're staying at the Sheraton, you can in theory

861
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:07,320
get up to the theme park without waiting for the shuttle bus that runs between all of the

862
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:10,320
two hotels and then city walk in the theme park.

863
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:14,360
You can take that glass elevator up, walk around the Hilton property and then take that

864
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:18,640
pedestrian footbridge up the block to the theme parks.

865
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:24,200
It's a little bit when I was first out here and my dad stayed at the Sheraton, it was

866
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:26,960
a little bit of a like, how do we?

867
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,800
They said like, oh, there's an elevator and you go up and there's a path.

868
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:35,880
And in Florida, since it's a full resort property, there's signs.

869
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:40,640
There's kind of some pathways like that at University of Florida, little kind of hidden,

870
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,920
but then every 10 feet there's a sign.

871
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:48,040
There needs to be like some expressway though from these hotels to city walk proper.

872
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:51,720
They might run shuttles, but that's not a run for all day.

873
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:52,720
Right.

874
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:55,240
But like, yeah, we'll make it a little bit more like Orlando where you can just walk.

875
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:58,580
I mean, obviously they have more space there, but they're they just built that big thing

876
00:40:58,580 --> 00:41:02,760
over Lancashire, the big walkway in the last year or two to make it easier to get from

877
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:05,120
the metro to the tram.

878
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:06,400
There's got to be a version of that.

879
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:09,360
That's like your express walkway right into city walk.

880
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:15,600
Because getting from city walk and the parks to the hotels is downright dangerous.

881
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:16,600
Very.

882
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,480
Do we, there's a real sector question.

883
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,480
I know.

884
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:21,480
Or maybe we save it for tomorrow.

885
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:22,480
I think this is part of the park.

886
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,480
I think we save it.

887
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:24,480
Yeah.

888
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,600
Without the sector keeper here to make the ruling, it's a little tougher.

889
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:32,960
But what if he was here, he might cough and have us move on down to the universal Sheraton.

890
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:38,160
And if you're going to go, if anybody does this, does this path that we're describing

891
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:43,280
starts gets a, you go get a drink at the Hilton, then take the glass elevator downstairs.

892
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:48,680
It's the best way to arrive at the universal Sheraton because you get to see that beautiful

893
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:52,120
view, the flickering lights of a van eyes or something.

894
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:53,120
I don't know.

895
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:58,180
But then you really get to land on this like perfect sixties mod hotel.

896
00:41:58,180 --> 00:42:03,500
This place opened in 1969 and it was called the hotel of the stars.

897
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:09,760
And you can feel this, this sixties height of luxury as you can with the eighties in

898
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,480
the Hilton.

899
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:13,800
You're traveling a little bit back in time.

900
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:16,280
You go a couple of decades back.

901
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:18,200
And that's the thing I like about these two hotels.

902
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:25,320
It's a similar vibe to Disney world where if you do a pass of hotels, you can feel the

903
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:29,540
eras that they were all built in and you're in totally different themes.

904
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:31,800
It's like a much lighter version of that.

905
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:35,640
But if they were two hotels cut from the same cloth, I wouldn't like it nearly as much as

906
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:38,000
super eighties hotels, super sixties hotel.

907
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:42,440
I have to give them credit because they've redone these hotels a number of times.

908
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:47,080
I feel like even in just the last 10 years, although the one time I stayed at the Hilton

909
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:51,800
that led to a very funny sort of bit of business where the elevators were being redone.

910
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:57,000
So they had employees running the elevators, like an old style hotel with walkie talkies.

911
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:04,880
Like you had to like someone had to call up and get like someone was downstairs and there

912
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:09,100
would be a person there and they would radio down to one of the other.

913
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:10,880
It was very confusing.

914
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:12,000
And then that was the same year.

915
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,760
I think both my parents visited like six months apart.

916
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:19,900
And I was like, God, I hope the elevators are fixed.

917
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:20,900
And they were.

918
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:21,900
They did.

919
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:25,960
They turned it around pretty quickly, but it was very odd because you think like, oh,

920
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:27,960
old style hotels with hotel operators.

921
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:32,240
This is much more like a guy who works at the front desk usually.

922
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:36,280
And he's just like pressing the button and the override and going like, I'm going out

923
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:37,280
to this.

924
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:38,280
Shops off.

925
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:43,040
OK, I'm going back down like because only half the elevators were working.

926
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,040
I disagree.

927
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:45,040
They should have stuck with this.

928
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:46,440
I want a guy on every floor.

929
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:49,960
I want operators that really makes me feel like that.

930
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:50,960
Now we're in like a 30s.

931
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:53,860
Yeah, it was a little I don't know.

932
00:43:53,860 --> 00:43:55,200
It was a little bizarre.

933
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:56,200
I want you.

934
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:57,640
I want you to be the elevator operator.

935
00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:00,560
I mean, I want a beautiful lobby boy.

936
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:01,560
Lobby boys here.

937
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:02,560
Grand Budapest.

938
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:03,560
Oh, yeah, totally.

939
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:05,120
And it's not a walkie talkie.

940
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:08,160
You answer a little like Dixie Cup string phone.

941
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:09,160
Oh, yeah.

942
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:12,600
Has to go all the way up to 40 floors of the hotel.

943
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:15,840
But the Sheraton, when my family first stayed there, we're like, it's pretty nice.

944
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:17,800
But they had let it fall off a little.

945
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:19,760
But they've really restored that lobby.

946
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:21,240
Done a good job.

947
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:22,240
Really good.

948
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:23,240
Keeping with the times.

949
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:28,920
However, I'm not super pleased with I don't know exactly what it was like in the 1990s.

950
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:36,160
But while I did have a good time at that bar, they are no longer paying homage to the primary

951
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:41,360
epicenter fact about the Universal Sheraton, the most famous resident.

952
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:47,440
This was so fun to find out the Universal Sheraton, highly associated for many decades

953
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:52,600
with the actor, Telly Savalas, Telly Savalas, TV's Kojak.

954
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:54,920
Lived there for like 20 years.

955
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:55,960
He died there.

956
00:44:55,960 --> 00:45:00,000
He died in this hotel on the third floor on a third floor suite.

957
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,680
Ninety three or ninety four.

958
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:04,040
It was in ninety four.

959
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:05,040
He died.

960
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:06,040
This is what's crazy.

961
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:08,840
He died in January 1994.

962
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:10,880
You know what else was in January 1994?

963
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:16,440
The Northridge earthquake, which did substantial damage to the Universal Sheraton.

964
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:25,040
So this this place, which through the 80s and 90s was beautiful and, you know, teeming

965
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:30,880
with life because of the constant presence of Telly Savalas walking around the lobby,

966
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:36,480
playing pool with people, walking around with slippers, say, hey, baby, what's happening?

967
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:38,360
He was like the heart of the hotel.

968
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:39,440
And then he died.

969
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:41,040
And then the life went out of it.

970
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:42,040
Yeah.

971
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:46,040
And then the earthquake, maybe Telly Savalas' death in some cosmic way triggered the North

972
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:49,480
Ridge Northridge earthquake.

973
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:50,480
God was too sad.

974
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:51,480
Yeah.

975
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:55,240
He just he was he stopped holding the plates, the lines together.

976
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:56,240
Yeah.

977
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:57,240
Yeah.

978
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:58,240
The phone lines.

979
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:00,600
And it seemed like he was very friendly to guests like people would come up to him and

980
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:01,600
talk to him.

981
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:04,560
It seemed like he would shoot pool and gamble on Sportsgate.

982
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:06,960
Like, yes, he was just hanging around.

983
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:12,160
I found one quote from his obituary where a friend said the following.

984
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:16,680
He could be eating a sandwich, you know, putting something in his mouth and someone would come

985
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:19,840
over and slap him on the back and say, how you doing?

986
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:20,840
He'd say delightful.

987
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:21,840
How wonderful.

988
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:25,320
Which is, it sounds so fun and full of life.

989
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:26,320
I know.

990
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:29,920
As opposed to like you hear the stories about like late in life, Dean Martin sitting at

991
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:30,920
hamburger.

992
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:31,920
Marys?

993
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:32,920
Hamburger Marys.

994
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:33,920
Yeah, at sunset.

995
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:34,920
Really?

996
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:35,920
He was there?

997
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:36,920
Yeah.

998
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:37,920
And it seems much sadder.

999
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:45,800
My friend of mine has a story where he was at the Coppola Winery where and he was there

1000
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:51,160
on a weekend where Francis Ford Coppola himself was walking around.

1001
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:53,960
And you might think he's in his element.

1002
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:55,200
He's at his wine place.

1003
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:59,180
He's probably more invested in that these days than the movies.

1004
00:46:59,180 --> 00:47:00,680
And you might think wine's flowing.

1005
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:02,920
He's boisterous guy.

1006
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:06,920
You could come up to him and say, I just want to say Godfather, greatest thing, apocalypse

1007
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:07,920
now.

1008
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:09,320
Hey, put her there.

1009
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:10,320
Shake your hand.

1010
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:14,720
He just, my friend just said, you know, you inspired me to be a writer and to do the creative

1011
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:15,720
stuff that I do.

1012
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:21,480
And he just stared, didn't look away, stared at him while all this was said and then walked

1013
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:22,480
away.

1014
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:24,240
Didn't acknowledge him or say anything.

1015
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:27,360
Just stared daggers as if to say you are dirt to me.

1016
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:28,360
Man.

1017
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:32,120
How awful, how heartbreak to meet you, to sell someone you're, you're my hero and then

1018
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:33,640
get hard dissed.

1019
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:38,080
But in the universal share it and you could walk up to telly Savalas whether or not you

1020
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:40,800
loved sell your Savalas or only slightly knew who he was.

1021
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:43,080
Need say, how you doing, baby?

1022
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:44,800
We're in Telly town now.

1023
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:46,280
How awesome.

1024
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:47,280
So cool.

1025
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:48,280
The Coppola thing.

1026
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:50,080
I mean, that's not even an Irish guy.

1027
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:52,400
That's like a full on Sicilian goodbye.

1028
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:57,280
Like that's like an Irish goodbye, but there's more, more of a threat of menace behind it.

1029
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:00,800
It feels like I should mention my friend was slaughtered in his hotel that night.

1030
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:01,800
Oh, okay.

1031
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:03,120
Well, you know, didn't make it.

1032
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:04,120
Disrespect the outfit.

1033
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:05,120
Possibly at Francis's orders.

1034
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:06,720
You can only assume.

1035
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:10,360
I'm trying to think of another equivalent of like where like a famous person was hanging

1036
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:12,120
around and they were just like the greatest.

1037
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:13,760
They would hold court or something.

1038
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:14,760
Yeah.

1039
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:16,160
Is there such a thing?

1040
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:19,880
The closest thing I can think of is Lemmy Kilmister from Motorhead would be at that

1041
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:25,240
rainbow bar and grill on Sunset a lot if he wasn't on tour and like you could buy him

1042
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:28,520
a drink and you know, that was his hangout.

1043
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:29,520
Yeah.

1044
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:33,880
I mean, it's not, we can establish ours.

1045
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:38,120
It wouldn't be that rare to find us at the Burbank Holiday Inn.

1046
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:39,120
That's true.

1047
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:40,120
Yeah.

1048
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:41,120
Up at the Crystalview Lounge.

1049
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:42,120
Yes.

1050
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:43,120
We were there one night.

1051
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:44,680
We closed it down and it's not open terribly late.

1052
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:48,920
There was maybe five other people in it and we met a very nice listener.

1053
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:49,920
Yeah.

1054
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:57,240
There's like no one in this bar except like us and maybe Aaron and Lindsay and of all

1055
00:48:57,240 --> 00:49:00,200
the places, one person was like, oh hey.

1056
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:01,200
Weird, right?

1057
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:05,280
This is the dream is, well, I don't want to, I guess I don't want to change it from the

1058
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:07,400
Crystalview Lounge because that's a perfect name.

1059
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:08,400
Yeah.

1060
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:13,320
But if it got, if the name got changed to the PTR Crystalview Lounge and there was a

1061
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:14,320
booth name for us.

1062
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:15,320
Sure.

1063
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:19,440
That weird booth with a very low ceiling where you're kind of trapped that I want, I want

1064
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:23,120
that whole part of the, hey, we know the bartender.

1065
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:24,120
He's our friend.

1066
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:25,120
I think we can make them.

1067
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:31,360
I want to be the Telly Savalas of the Burbank Holiday Inn and I also want to get a very

1068
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:32,880
large and shave my head.

1069
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:33,880
Yeah.

1070
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:35,600
I will be living there by 75.

1071
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:37,480
I think we can make the booth happen.

1072
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:38,480
Yeah.

1073
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:40,040
I think also like, how about this?

1074
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:44,920
Just if you like work at a restaurant or a bar in the Los Angeles area or Orlando area,

1075
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:46,440
will you name a booth after us?

1076
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:48,640
Can we have multiple booths at multiple places?

1077
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:49,640
Or design sandwiches.

1078
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:50,640
Sure.

1079
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:52,400
That's a good way to get us to show up somewhere.

1080
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:53,400
Yeah.

1081
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:54,400
Name a booth after us.

1082
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:59,240
And, and offer a special of a butter flied.

1083
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:01,040
Butter flied hot dog.

1084
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:02,040
Hot dog.

1085
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:03,040
Yeah.

1086
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:04,040
Cookies and milk.

1087
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:06,480
With the side of cookies and milk.

1088
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:09,400
Note on the menu, prepared in a napkin.

1089
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:10,400
And then a wet napkin.

1090
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:12,760
I guess you couldn't do a butterfly that was prepared in a napkin.

1091
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:13,760
Well, you could have either or.

1092
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:14,760
You would want to do it after.

1093
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:15,760
It's complicated.

1094
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:16,760
Yeah.

1095
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:17,760
Yeah.

1096
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:18,760
The Jason one and the Jason two.

1097
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:19,760
Yeah.

1098
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:25,920
And this, this is reminding me of the, one of the times my family visited and we're staying,

1099
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:30,000
I guess we were in St. Ann at Hilton, but we went to, my dad always wanted to go to

1100
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:36,040
Spago in Beverly Hills and we went and who was walking around shaking hands, but Wolfgang

1101
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:37,040
Puck himself.

1102
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:38,040
Whoa.

1103
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:39,040
It was great.

1104
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:40,040
He was so nice.

1105
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:41,040
He was so charming.

1106
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:47,280
Shook our hands, gave every, he's like, Oh, you know, Oh yes, just here.

1107
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:48,280
Just checking in.

1108
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:51,200
And he, he gave out like little slices of pizza.

1109
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:55,880
He gave us some little like a mousse, a mousse bouche sort of thing.

1110
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:59,880
And it was just a delightful like experience.

1111
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:04,680
How often do you get to go to like a celebrity chef's restaurant and they're there.

1112
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:05,680
Yeah.

1113
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:10,120
And yet we went into the Bubba Gump and the actor who played Bubba Gump was nowhere to

1114
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:11,120
be found.

1115
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:12,120
No, no.

1116
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:13,120
What's his name?

1117
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:14,120
Something.

1118
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:15,120
Yeah.

1119
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:16,120
Williamson.

1120
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:21,440
Maybe we'd know who he was if he would put in a little FaceTime and I guess, wait, he

1121
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:22,800
didn't play Bubba Gump.

1122
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:23,800
He played Bubba.

1123
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:26,800
Oh, so I'm also calling out Tom Hanks.

1124
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:32,160
Tom Hanks, you should be at Bubba Gump's far more frequently and the other actor should

1125
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:33,160
be as well.

1126
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:35,200
They should be at a booth shaking hands.

1127
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:36,640
They can cover more ground.

1128
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:37,800
They can do double duty.

1129
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:38,800
One can go into one room.

1130
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:40,060
The other can go into the other.

1131
00:51:40,060 --> 00:51:41,060
One can hang out.

1132
00:51:41,060 --> 00:51:42,480
Tom can hang out in the gift shop.

1133
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:45,440
They can divide and conquer.

1134
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:49,360
I think you can for sure find Dennis Haskins at that Save by the Bell pop up.

1135
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:51,160
If I would imagine.

1136
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:53,720
Well, now that Dimples is gone.

1137
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:56,600
America's first karaoke bar.

1138
00:51:56,600 --> 00:52:02,320
You know, actually what we forgot to say is that so the reason Telly Savalas was here,

1139
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:06,840
was hanging out at the Sheraton was because he filmed Kojak on the Universal Lot and I

1140
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:08,320
think he lived much further away.

1141
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:11,520
He was like, let me just start staying up at the hotel because we film late and then

1142
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:13,160
I can just pop back in in the morning.

1143
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:15,160
He loved it so much.

1144
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:19,320
I saw an interview where he talks about why he loved hotel living and one of the things

1145
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:24,200
was you know, I come downstairs while the maids go clean up after sloppy Telly.

1146
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:27,560
I go back in everything's sparkling clean.

1147
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:28,560
Sloppy Telly.

1148
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:31,560
I love it so much.

1149
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:35,700
So he loved it so much he just moved in and in fact raised his children up there.

1150
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:38,600
He moved his mother several floors up.

1151
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:44,840
The whole Savalas family was living in the hotel and then one time he's hanging out in

1152
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:49,080
the bar and one of the owners or something is bemoaning the fact that there hasn't been

1153
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:53,680
enough business in the bar lately and how do we drum it up and he says, why don't you

1154
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:59,520
call it Telly's and before you know it, it is officially Telly's bar and then he's walking

1155
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:01,080
around Telly's bar.

1156
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:03,920
How cool and you could walk up asking to play pool.

1157
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:10,880
He would play pool and then unfortunately he passed away but you know, but stayed there,

1158
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:15,320
was living there when he passed away and on the third floor outside the door there was

1159
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:21,800
a sign to ward off potential intruders that said no one can enter without permission from

1160
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:24,040
the king.

1161
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:25,040
So neat.

1162
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:26,040
Wow.

1163
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:27,200
Telly Savalas running around.

1164
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:33,120
They need a new celebrity to live and raise her children there.

1165
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:34,120
Yeah.

1166
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:35,120
That's the thing that's missing.

1167
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:39,200
I don't know who it is.

1168
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:43,160
Well, I mean, you got Paul with Garland.

1169
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:49,440
To me, Garland is like TV legend royalty, gregarious guy.

1170
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:52,440
He's a guy who you can walk up to.

1171
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:57,680
I feel like your whole relationship formed from him just pointing at you and saying,

1172
00:53:57,680 --> 00:53:58,680
you're funny.

1173
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:00,960
He says, what an inviting man.

1174
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:01,960
That's true.

1175
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:04,960
This, if there was ever a person who should just be-

1176
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:05,960
That's a good idea.

1177
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:06,960
Yeah, yeah.

1178
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:09,320
That's what I would really like if you planned it this way.

1179
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:11,880
He'll come back on the show and we'll present it to him, I think.

1180
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:13,120
That he should live.

1181
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:14,840
We have a plan for him.

1182
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:20,600
It's an old Hollywood, it's been on an old Hollywood classic, living in a nice hotel.

1183
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:21,600
Sure.

1184
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:25,160
But I also would like him to shave his head bald like Telly Savalas.

1185
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:28,040
So that's probably an aspect of it that he's got to follow.

1186
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:29,040
We should say-

1187
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:30,600
He's got to crank the drinking way.

1188
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:31,600
Oh, yeah.

1189
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:32,600
Oh my gosh.

1190
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:36,600
Get much more unhealthy to make this entire thing work.

1191
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:41,800
For our younger listeners, Telly Savalas was a TV detective named Kojak.

1192
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:45,480
He was also Blofeld in On Her Majesty's Secret Service.

1193
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:50,120
And I believe nominated for an Oscar for his role in The Birdman of Alcatraz.

1194
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:51,120
Dirty Dozen too.

1195
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:55,920
Robert Osborn back in action over here.

1196
00:54:55,920 --> 00:55:00,280
One of my neighbors used to work in the gift shop at the Sheraton Universal.

1197
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:04,280
And I mentioned it too, that I'd been out there at the bar and they were like, you know,

1198
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:05,280
Telly Savalas used to live there.

1199
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:07,360
And I'm like, yeah, we talked about Telly.

1200
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:10,800
And I said, did you know any other stars that would come?

1201
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:15,160
And they're like, well, you know, I never even saw him, but everyone knew he was there.

1202
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:16,360
I never got a chance to meet him.

1203
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:24,400
But they said, the one that I remember is a guy stayed there and his last name was Toma.

1204
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:27,760
Do you guys know about the one season TV show Toma?

1205
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:28,760
No.

1206
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:29,760
No.

1207
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:30,760
Okay.

1208
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:37,640
But based on the biography and story of a real life detective who had a 98% conviction

1209
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:43,040
rate, he was like this super cop and he wrote this book and he consulted on like the story

1210
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:49,800
of his life and the show starred, let me see, Tony Mustaine and Susan Strasburg and Tony

1211
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:56,080
Mustaine played David Toma and he said he was only going to do it for one season and

1212
00:55:56,080 --> 00:55:58,000
they, they didn't believe him.

1213
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:01,920
They thought that was like fina, that was him like trying to get more money for the

1214
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:02,920
next season.

1215
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:06,760
But at the end of the first season, he's like, no, I'm walking and the show was doing well.

1216
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:09,240
So they're like, well, I guess we got to recast him.

1217
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:13,120
They recast him with an actor by the name of Robert Blake.

1218
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:18,220
And then they read the show entirely, got rid of the folk, except main character is

1219
00:56:18,220 --> 00:56:19,780
good detective.

1220
00:56:19,780 --> 00:56:21,480
And that became Beretta.

1221
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:22,480
Whoa.

1222
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:24,620
And that ran for a number of years.

1223
00:56:24,620 --> 00:56:26,920
And Strasburg, the actress stayed on it.

1224
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:29,480
I'm not sure if the actor, no, I think they replaced the whole case.

1225
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:33,400
It was just Toma became Beretta, like same idea.

1226
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:35,880
It was the same cameraman and makeup person.

1227
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:36,880
Yeah.

1228
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:37,880
And same.

1229
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:38,880
Yeah.

1230
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:43,000
And then a lot of the writing staff would go on to write episodes of the Rockford files

1231
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,680
and at these hotels.

1232
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:45,680
Yeah.

1233
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:47,560
And, and, and stuff like that.

1234
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:54,080
And then later in life, Robert Blake, uh, would go just a few miles away to not murder

1235
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:58,360
his wife at Vitello's Italian restaurant, Vitello's Italian restaurant.

1236
00:56:58,360 --> 00:56:59,360
Yes.

1237
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:01,440
Located in the beautiful studio city.

1238
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:02,440
Yes.

1239
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:03,440
Wow.

1240
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:04,440
What great.

1241
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:06,480
So they, so I'm sorry, the actor who played Toma.

1242
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:07,840
No, the real life Toma.

1243
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:15,840
The real life Toma whose website says, uh, the website commemorating him is very...

1244
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:17,400
Toma stayed at the hotel?

1245
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:18,640
Toma stayed at the hotel.

1246
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:20,360
But not regularly?

1247
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:26,080
I think while they were filming either the series or the 90 minute movie pilot.

1248
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:27,080
So wait a minute.

1249
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:30,760
So you asked if there are any other celebrities that ever stayed at the hotel and Toma was

1250
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:31,760
the...

1251
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:34,800
Toma was the only one that my neighbor had remembered meeting.

1252
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:36,320
That's so interesting that that's the memory.

1253
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:37,320
There had to be other celebrities.

1254
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:38,320
Of course there were other celebrities.

1255
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:39,320
But Toma was the one that left the impression.

1256
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:42,680
The real life David Toma.

1257
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:45,440
Did the maids go clean up after sloppy Toma?

1258
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:46,680
Sloppy Toma.

1259
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:53,440
I also, clearly if Toma had been on the case, Robert Blake wouldn't have gotten away.

1260
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:54,440
Oh my gosh.

1261
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:55,440
Yeah.

1262
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:56,440
Yeah, cause Toma would have been right there too.

1263
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:58,640
If Toma was still staying at the hotel.

1264
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:04,520
Do you know that I was there the day that Robert Blake was arrested and taken to prison

1265
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:10,200
because he lived in Hidden Hills, the skated community, uh, very close to where I grew

1266
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:11,640
up in Woodland Hills.

1267
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:16,360
And my dad picked me up from school one day and was like much more hurried than usual.

1268
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:18,920
I got in the car and he said, here, get in, get in, get in.

1269
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:19,920
They're arresting Robert Blake.

1270
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:23,280
It's happening today.

1271
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:27,600
And we waited outside of Hidden Hills where the big police presence and helicopters and

1272
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:29,720
stuff and then we watched the car go.

1273
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:32,680
You watched Robert Blake get taken away?

1274
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:36,480
Taken away from the luxurious skated community Hidden Hills.

1275
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:37,480
Wow.

1276
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:39,080
And your dad was just like, I want to see this.

1277
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:40,080
Yeah.

1278
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:44,280
Cause my dad in general liked to watch car chases.

1279
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:47,320
Like if there's ever a car chase there, it's passing by our, and he'd go, we'll go find

1280
00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:48,320
any criminal activity.

1281
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:50,880
And this made it more tantalizing because it was Robert Blake.

1282
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:51,880
Uh huh.

1283
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:52,880
Uh huh.

1284
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:55,680
Any like thought about on the day of the Bronco chase, he was like, do we go to one of the

1285
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:56,680
overpets?

1286
00:58:56,680 --> 00:58:57,680
Do we try to catch them?

1287
00:58:57,680 --> 00:59:00,760
Uh, well, which that was a big thing in LA in general.

1288
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:05,240
Like a lot of people, I mean, if you watch the footage, people are heading to those overpasses

1289
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:09,080
and putting up signs and it was definitely, he was doing the math of a wonder.

1290
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:10,080
Okay.

1291
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:11,080
So he's heading east.

1292
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:12,200
How far would we have to go?

1293
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:13,200
Could we intersect?

1294
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:14,200
Yeah.

1295
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:16,560
That's kind of my, that's kind of, did you ever do anything like that?

1296
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:19,280
Um, did he make a citizen's arrest ever?

1297
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:21,000
No, no, no.

1298
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:24,600
He, uh, uh, I did go, I did attend the OJ trial one day.

1299
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:26,280
I forget if I've said that in this bucket.

1300
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:28,200
I don't think you have said that.

1301
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:32,320
One day I watched, he took me outside the LA courthouse cause he was a lawyer and he

1302
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:33,880
knew where and when these things happen.

1303
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:38,480
And we watched Shapiro and Cochran head in for the day.

1304
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:39,480
Wow.

1305
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:40,480
Really?

1306
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:44,640
And then the next day after we went to a very dry trial, there was a copyright dispute

1307
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:49,400
between our favorite musicians, Brian Wilson and Mike Love who were suing each other in

1308
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:50,400
1893.

1309
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:51,400
What a day!

1310
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:52,400
Yeah.

1311
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:53,400
Wow.

1312
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:54,840
Honestly, one of my most cherished childhood memories.

1313
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:55,840
Hey, my goodness.

1314
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:57,800
And I wore the only, I wore a little suit.

1315
00:59:57,800 --> 00:59:59,880
I had a little green suit.

1316
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:04,600
Like I, like all of green, like a chair would be made out of.

1317
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:05,840
So I'm in a little green jacket.

1318
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:07,720
Like a crushed velvet green suit.

1319
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:11,800
It was not unlike what the winners of the masters tournament are given.

1320
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:13,520
I was wearing, I think that's why I liked it.

1321
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:15,520
I was wearing a master's jacket.

1322
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:20,800
I was nine years old and I had to see Robert Shapiro and then sit in a boring, there was

1323
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:29,200
just nothing but jargon until like, you know, 17 minutes in the like, and so help me Rhonda

1324
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:30,920
among the other, uh, blah, blah, blah.

1325
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:33,720
Then anyway, affidavit blah, but the rest of it was just all jargon.

1326
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:37,200
It looks like we're all a weirdos on this podcast.

1327
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:39,280
You know what this is making me want to say?

1328
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:41,160
My dad is better than your dad.

1329
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:42,720
Hey, wait a minute.

1330
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:43,720
It happened.

1331
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:44,720
I became a monster.

1332
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:48,320
No, just cause he wanted to fight crime.

1333
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:51,760
I just hadn't thought about it for long enough to know my dad's the best dad.

1334
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:56,120
He took me to see Mike love Sue Brian Wilson.

1335
01:00:56,120 --> 01:01:00,040
I'm trying to think about what else, like staying at both these hotels, which, which

1336
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:01,040
they're both nice.

1337
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:04,160
I think it's interesting now cause it's very clear.

1338
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:06,880
Now I think it's very clear as opposed to 10 years ago.

1339
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:08,760
They seemed much similar to me.

1340
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:13,120
Now it seems like the Hilton's catering to like families and stuff.

1341
01:01:13,120 --> 01:01:16,520
And the Sheraton is a little more like, yeah, this is cool.

1342
01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:18,760
There's like music in the lobby.

1343
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:24,200
There's an impressive hip fragrance being pummeled pummeling you.

1344
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:26,400
This weird, like it's a, it's a study.

1345
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:32,760
It's kind of like a library came to life after closing, but it smells very fragrant.

1346
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:37,800
Although when I went to use the bathroom, it's closer to like the, the room always.

1347
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:42,080
And that has a much more pleasant soothing scent pumped into it.

1348
01:01:42,080 --> 01:01:44,720
But they're really pumping in that hotel.

1349
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:45,720
It's weird.

1350
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:49,000
I get, well, I guess not weird, but like it's trying to make up for the fact that there's

1351
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:50,720
no newer hotel there.

1352
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:55,800
Cause universal in Orlando, they've built newer hotels and hard rock is the hip hotel.

1353
01:01:55,800 --> 01:02:00,560
And even, you know, whatever the Cabana Bay is like a cool retro throw.

1354
01:02:00,560 --> 01:02:04,640
Like, so the eighties hotel has to be like, where the cool, or no, wait, we were saying

1355
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:08,520
the I'm saying the, the one built in the eighties, that tends to be more families.

1356
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:09,520
Okay.

1357
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:13,600
So the sixties one is the one now that has to take over a little cooler, but neither

1358
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:15,880
of them are too kid oriented.

1359
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:19,600
And this is something that I kind of like, cause I feel like as a kid, even I sort of

1360
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:24,000
didn't like when hotels were super cutesy.

1361
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:28,560
There was something interesting about the feeling of I left all of the cat left Alice

1362
01:02:28,560 --> 01:02:30,960
in wonderland and Mickey mouse and everything.

1363
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:36,320
And now I'm in just this, this dull like bit I'm in Nakatomi Plaza.

1364
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:39,920
It made me feel more, it made me feel like an adult, especially when my parents started

1365
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:42,400
giving me, getting us our own key cards and stuff.

1366
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:46,640
Well, I don't, what the thing is, I think with the kiddie hotels is that no one, I'm

1367
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:51,200
assuming nothing we went into and most, I'm sure there's not even a good version of this,

1368
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:53,380
but maybe like Lego land or something.

1369
01:02:53,380 --> 01:02:55,680
All the kiddie hotels probably also felt cheap.

1370
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:56,680
Yeah.

1371
01:02:56,680 --> 01:02:59,680
Like the kid going to that whatever the star wars hotel is going to be cause they're going

1372
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:00,960
to pump money into it.

1373
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:02,640
Like that's going to be like amazing.

1374
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:07,600
So like that type of kid experience, which of course now it's for adults too, but kid

1375
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:14,640
hotels like that, there was a defunct land on the Nickelodeon universe hotel in Orlando,

1376
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:16,080
which looks like a nightmare.

1377
01:03:16,080 --> 01:03:17,080
Yeah.

1378
01:03:17,080 --> 01:03:23,280
I want to vomit at every, every, every picture of that place is just an aesthetic barf.

1379
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:24,280
Yeah.

1380
01:03:24,280 --> 01:03:30,360
You can't even as a kid, you kind of recognize what like dog shit is sometime, like not all

1381
01:03:30,360 --> 01:03:35,960
the time, but like you can feel the detail or you can feel to the child.

1382
01:03:35,960 --> 01:03:36,960
Yeah.

1383
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:37,960
Yeah.

1384
01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:38,960
Yeah.

1385
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:39,960
It's talking down to you.

1386
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:40,960
Yeah.

1387
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:41,960
Absolutely.

1388
01:03:41,960 --> 01:03:45,920
And to do it, and it pales in comparison when you're in a fully enveloped themed kids environment

1389
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:49,320
with it's all there's a, but there's a lot of money behind it to then go into a place

1390
01:03:49,320 --> 01:03:53,240
with just kind of like a plywood Mickey is super lame.

1391
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:54,240
Right.

1392
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:56,120
And you can tell our kids are smart.

1393
01:03:56,120 --> 01:04:01,200
So less kid stuff in these hotels, unless you're going to jack up the theming, unless

1394
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:05,760
it's a fully themed Harry Potter hotel, which is obviously what they should do.

1395
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:07,200
And I wonder why they're talking about it.

1396
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:09,600
I'm sure they've been talking about it, but I don't know why they haven't done it.

1397
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:10,600
It's weird.

1398
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:13,720
I think it's weird in general that there has not been a third hotel, no hotel built since

1399
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:15,360
bizarre the eighties.

1400
01:04:15,360 --> 01:04:20,760
They are trying to build a gigantic wing onto the Hilton and thank God and the concept art.

1401
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:23,360
It looks like the old, it still has an epic.

1402
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:28,520
It looks like the other tower at the contemporary, which I was worried was going to not be the

1403
01:04:28,520 --> 01:04:29,520
cool seven.

1404
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:30,520
Oh yeah.

1405
01:04:30,520 --> 01:04:31,520
But I like that new tower.

1406
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:32,520
I stayed there.

1407
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:33,520
Yeah.

1408
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:34,520
The Bay Lake tower.

1409
01:04:34,520 --> 01:04:35,520
I like it a lot.

1410
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:40,480
That's and it does feel like the next evolution of the, it feels copacetic with the contemporary

1411
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:42,360
they're trying to build a third hotel.

1412
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:46,880
The rumors we've heard, but like there's a lot going on and especially Scott, do you

1413
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:48,920
get the universal evolution mailings?

1414
01:04:48,920 --> 01:04:51,360
Do you know the neighborhood mailings?

1415
01:04:51,360 --> 01:04:54,840
I got letters that were about like how they were changing the freeway.

1416
01:04:54,840 --> 01:04:55,840
Yeah.

1417
01:04:55,840 --> 01:05:00,040
So they, I mean, cause universal is built so close to residential streets and like the

1418
01:05:00,040 --> 01:05:06,840
freeways they, whenever they want to do like big work, they have to send out information

1419
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:11,800
about it and present it to the, like the city count or the neighborhood groups and all that

1420
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:13,020
sort of thing.

1421
01:05:13,020 --> 01:05:15,040
And it's changed so much.

1422
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:20,960
It's because like the, the local NBC affiliate is, is on the universal back lot now as is

1423
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:24,080
like the Telemundo headquarters.

1424
01:05:24,080 --> 01:05:28,640
And there was talk about building apartments on the backlog closer to bar.

1425
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:30,240
That got scrapped.

1426
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:35,840
And then there's talk about, yeah, now there's talk about building the Hilton extension.

1427
01:05:35,840 --> 01:05:42,680
Just recently in 2018, there's talk about building a 31 story tower by the Sheraton

1428
01:05:42,680 --> 01:05:46,560
and then there's land cleared by the Frankenstein garage that they're like, this is going to

1429
01:05:46,560 --> 01:05:50,640
be the third hotel and this is going to be over there as we pointed out, but it's going

1430
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:52,440
to be 75 stories tall.

1431
01:05:52,440 --> 01:05:56,680
If you built, if you build up and then yeah, you'd have to move a lot of earth.

1432
01:05:56,680 --> 01:06:01,880
I mean, the thing with the universal city is you're competing with nature and gravity

1433
01:06:01,880 --> 01:06:02,880
because it's a hill.

1434
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:04,640
It's an earthquake damage.

1435
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:09,640
It's a, yeah, it's to, I think they're a little bit in a corner and it's interesting

1436
01:06:09,640 --> 01:06:13,840
to think about the future of, of, of universal hotels.

1437
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:15,720
And that kind of seems like a closing point.

1438
01:06:15,720 --> 01:06:20,520
However, I'm going to backtrack instead because there's something more important to talk about,

1439
01:06:20,520 --> 01:06:23,080
which is we were getting a bar or we were getting a bar.

1440
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:27,920
We were at the Sheraton bar and as you mentioned, a lot of music being pumped into the place

1441
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:30,680
and we've been, I've been pointing the finger at you a lot, Jason.

1442
01:06:30,680 --> 01:06:31,680
Now it's moving to Mike.

1443
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:32,680
All right, bring it on.

1444
01:06:32,680 --> 01:06:35,760
Uh, we didn't even talk about how my waiter owned my ass.

1445
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:36,760
Yeah.

1446
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:37,760
Oh, I was going to bring that up at the end of the show.

1447
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:38,760
Oh yeah.

1448
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:41,320
And then he said, yeah, you finished your Apple Apple strudel.

1449
01:06:41,320 --> 01:06:44,560
And then he came around and said, so round two.

1450
01:06:44,560 --> 01:06:45,560
Yeah.

1451
01:06:45,560 --> 01:06:47,360
Like it was like, do you want another drink?

1452
01:06:47,360 --> 01:06:51,000
Eddie's like, do you want another apple strudel?

1453
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,440
And the table just lost it.

1454
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:54,440
Great timing.

1455
01:06:54,440 --> 01:06:56,280
Very pithy, great pithy delivery.

1456
01:06:56,280 --> 01:06:58,600
I was very impressed.

1457
01:06:58,600 --> 01:06:59,600
Yeah.

1458
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:01,200
You're not on your podcast game.

1459
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:02,200
What is this?

1460
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:06,400
A live podcast, the ride here in the Hilton, a very good idea by the way.

1461
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:08,400
We'll try to make it happen.

1462
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:13,800
Anyway, so Mike getting owned lots, lots of music being pumped into this bar.

1463
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:20,080
But it was one particular song where you pointed up as if to the speaker and looked around

1464
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:22,760
like, ah, here we go.

1465
01:07:22,760 --> 01:07:29,400
And the song that you did that for was green days, good riddance time of your life, parentheses

1466
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:30,400
time of your life.

1467
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:35,200
You that of all the music that was playing, and this was a lot of throwback nineties,

1468
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:40,720
there was songs we were commenting on, but the one that made you go, oh yeah, was time

1469
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:42,000
of your life.

1470
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:43,000
Yeah.

1471
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:44,000
Madness.

1472
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:45,000
What are you talking?

1473
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:48,080
You enjoy the song time of your life?

1474
01:07:48,080 --> 01:07:52,440
I mean, look, I was being a little funny, but I mean, the song I think is a good song.

1475
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:55,520
I think that it's certainly been overplayed and overused over the years.

1476
01:07:55,520 --> 01:07:58,800
It was overplayed two weeks after its release.

1477
01:07:58,800 --> 01:08:03,320
I never, also because I think that was when I was graduating from middle school.

1478
01:08:03,320 --> 01:08:10,680
So it was used at all, any event tangentially related to that, as well as the finale of

1479
01:08:10,680 --> 01:08:11,680
Seinfeld.

1480
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:16,480
The clip show, the Seinfeld clip show, I believe, that preceded the finale.

1481
01:08:16,480 --> 01:08:20,920
I think that I don't put that song on, but when I hear it, I go, oh, there it is.

1482
01:08:20,920 --> 01:08:21,920
You light it up.

1483
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:22,920
Here we go.

1484
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:23,920
I liked it.

1485
01:08:23,920 --> 01:08:24,920
It's this.

1486
01:08:24,920 --> 01:08:25,920
Everybody get ready.

1487
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:26,920
It's time of your life.

1488
01:08:26,920 --> 01:08:29,840
I mean, I wasn't like, I didn't jump out of my seat and pump my fists.

1489
01:08:29,840 --> 01:08:33,400
I think I put one single finger in the air from the couch.

1490
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:34,400
I think that's what I did.

1491
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:40,960
But to me, that to me is more reaction than that whatever, that song, whatever, Merit.

1492
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:41,960
Time of your life.

1493
01:08:41,960 --> 01:08:44,400
Do you also like Vitamin C, Friends Forever?

1494
01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:45,400
No.

1495
01:08:45,400 --> 01:08:46,400
Time of your life is my favorite.

1496
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:49,480
Time of your life is heads and shoulders above Vitamin C.

1497
01:08:49,480 --> 01:08:50,880
I think I disagree.

1498
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:52,480
I think Time of your Life sucks.

1499
01:08:52,480 --> 01:08:53,480
Really?

1500
01:08:53,480 --> 01:08:54,480
It's an awful song.

1501
01:08:54,480 --> 01:08:57,640
I think this is more about you hating Time of your Life than me just putting sort of

1502
01:08:57,640 --> 01:08:58,640
innocuously.

1503
01:08:58,640 --> 01:08:59,640
That might be correct.

1504
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:05,920
I think what I would add on to directly in front of us was also a TV playing HD Telemundo

1505
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:07,400
on mute.

1506
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:12,160
So that's what if you looked away from the conversation, you could look at it.

1507
01:09:12,160 --> 01:09:17,760
And occasionally the little mute logo would pop up on screen like every two minutes.

1508
01:09:17,760 --> 01:09:18,760
Sure.

1509
01:09:18,760 --> 01:09:19,760
Yes.

1510
01:09:19,760 --> 01:09:20,760
What are you saying about that?

1511
01:09:20,760 --> 01:09:25,160
I just thought that was an interesting visual to go along with the audio of time of your

1512
01:09:25,160 --> 01:09:26,160
life.

1513
01:09:26,160 --> 01:09:28,880
I liked muted Telemundo far more than Green Day's Time of your Life.

1514
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:29,880
Yeah.

1515
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:33,960
I mean, I get it that it's very overplayed, but it's overplayed like Smooth or if Smooth

1516
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:35,960
had come on and we all.

1517
01:09:35,960 --> 01:09:37,440
Smooth is a better song.

1518
01:09:37,440 --> 01:09:39,400
Smooth is a better song and.

1519
01:09:39,400 --> 01:09:41,400
Is Smooth a better song than Good Riddance?

1520
01:09:41,400 --> 01:09:42,400
Absolutely.

1521
01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:43,400
Let me think about this.

1522
01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:44,400
Oh my God.

1523
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:45,400
There's no question.

1524
01:09:45,400 --> 01:09:46,400
Hold on a second here.

1525
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:47,400
Smooth is cool.

1526
01:09:47,400 --> 01:09:48,400
That's a karaoke jam for me.

1527
01:09:48,400 --> 01:09:49,400
You get the room.

1528
01:09:49,400 --> 01:09:50,400
I don't.

1529
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:52,720
You would clear the room with a Good Riddance.

1530
01:09:52,720 --> 01:09:54,360
What about Live in La Vida Loca?

1531
01:09:54,360 --> 01:09:55,360
Yes.

1532
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:56,360
Live in La Vida Loca is a good song.

1533
01:09:56,360 --> 01:09:57,360
These are dynamic songs.

1534
01:09:57,360 --> 01:09:58,360
These are fun songs.

1535
01:09:58,360 --> 01:10:00,760
This is our coming of age.

1536
01:10:00,760 --> 01:10:02,880
We made a coming of age movie.

1537
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:07,440
Even though Smooth is one of the biggest songs of all time, I think culturally Good Riddance

1538
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:08,920
made more of an impact.

1539
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:10,880
So I wouldn't give the edge to Good Riddance.

1540
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:13,960
Yeah, it did, but songs that make impact often are shit.

1541
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:16,080
It depends what we're talking about, though.

1542
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:19,200
I mean, because a lot, like you can argue there's merit in something that's very popular.

1543
01:10:19,200 --> 01:10:20,200
Smooth is funnier too.

1544
01:10:20,200 --> 01:10:21,200
Oh no, very often.

1545
01:10:21,200 --> 01:10:24,040
And there's nothing that makes me happier than when a very popular thing is very good.

1546
01:10:24,040 --> 01:10:27,280
But I'm just, I like your music taste overall a lot.

1547
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:28,560
I think we have a lot in common.

1548
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:30,200
Shots by the Green Day.

1549
01:10:30,200 --> 01:10:31,200
Well, yeah.

1550
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:36,320
I mean, look, I wasn't, again, when the finger went up, I wasn't saying number one song of

1551
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:37,320
all time.

1552
01:10:37,320 --> 01:10:39,960
I think though I am amused to hear it.

1553
01:10:39,960 --> 01:10:41,480
I do like it.

1554
01:10:41,480 --> 01:10:45,680
I do think Nimrod is a pretty good underrated Green Day album overall.

1555
01:10:45,680 --> 01:10:48,040
That is the album for which that I'm in.

1556
01:10:48,040 --> 01:10:52,040
You were also holding your fluorescent beverage that looked like wiper fluid.

1557
01:10:52,040 --> 01:10:57,080
I honestly thought that's what I was going to get hit for right here, not the Green Day.

1558
01:10:57,080 --> 01:10:58,360
But let's put the drink though.

1559
01:10:58,360 --> 01:10:59,360
Yeah.

1560
01:10:59,360 --> 01:11:03,520
So there's a big menu of drinks and we're, cause I had a Manhattan and maybe just like

1561
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:08,880
a whiskey at the other hotel and then they have a whole list of drinks and I wasn't expecting

1562
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:11,040
them to have fun stuff on this menu.

1563
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:14,920
I was thinking it was going to be, you know, going to be stuffy, a bunch of brown liquids.

1564
01:11:14,920 --> 01:11:16,240
What am I drinking shit?

1565
01:11:16,240 --> 01:11:17,240
Right.

1566
01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:18,240
But they have fun.

1567
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:21,600
Like, like I have the picture of the menu here and they have stuff like a Hermosa cocktail.

1568
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:23,400
They have different types of margaritas.

1569
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:25,920
They have a Bayou zinger.

1570
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:28,160
They have something called the corpse reviver.

1571
01:11:28,160 --> 01:11:29,160
I mean that's fun.

1572
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:30,160
Like theme park shit.

1573
01:11:30,160 --> 01:11:31,560
It's a little scary though.

1574
01:11:31,560 --> 01:11:32,560
A little scary.

1575
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:33,560
I agree.

1576
01:11:33,560 --> 01:11:40,040
Um, but at the top of the menu, they have something called the transformer, which has

1577
01:11:40,040 --> 01:11:44,840
to have been added when the ride, I assume this can't be on the menu forever.

1578
01:11:44,840 --> 01:11:45,880
And I didn't know what to order.

1579
01:11:45,880 --> 01:11:50,760
We were trying to decide and I said, well, that's got the most fun name and I, I truly

1580
01:11:50,760 --> 01:11:51,880
ingredients.

1581
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:56,120
It does have, but I, you have to believe me here when I say I did not look at the ingredients.

1582
01:11:56,120 --> 01:12:03,240
I did not think I was in for a Mickey's fun wheel style, multi layered, multicolored cocktail.

1583
01:12:03,240 --> 01:12:05,040
You picked it purely based on the name.

1584
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:06,880
Purely based on the fact that it was a top and it was a name.

1585
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:07,880
It's exactly what they want.

1586
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:08,880
Do you see?

1587
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:09,880
Yeah.

1588
01:12:09,880 --> 01:12:10,880
I've played right into their hand.

1589
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:11,880
Oh, the Jerry Maguire.

1590
01:12:11,880 --> 01:12:12,880
Yeah.

1591
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:13,880
I was like, I know the transformers.

1592
01:12:13,880 --> 01:12:16,360
I'm not even that big of a fan of the transformers.

1593
01:12:16,360 --> 01:12:18,320
There's no transformer shit in this apartment.

1594
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:21,440
If it had been the good riddance time of your life.

1595
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:22,440
Oh my God.

1596
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:26,320
I would have gotten, if it was good riddance cocktail, eight of them parentheses time of

1597
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:27,880
your life, I would have gotten it.

1598
01:12:27,880 --> 01:12:29,160
Uh, but transformers.

1599
01:12:29,160 --> 01:12:31,120
So when she came by, I was like, ah, transformers.

1600
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:33,000
And then I think she like kind of laughed.

1601
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:36,200
I think she thought that was funny or she like, she was a little judgy of us all night.

1602
01:12:36,200 --> 01:12:39,680
I think she, well, cause we tried to go in Telly's cabana.

1603
01:12:39,680 --> 01:12:44,360
There was a little, oh, they do still name the cabanas after Telly.

1604
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:45,960
And it was empty and we said, can we sit here?

1605
01:12:45,960 --> 01:12:49,080
And they said yes for $150.

1606
01:12:49,080 --> 01:12:54,080
Which I think Scott and I were there years ago and a same similar thing happened.

1607
01:12:54,080 --> 01:12:55,560
Like this place is not packed.

1608
01:12:55,560 --> 01:12:58,680
Why is there a little tinted off area in this bar?

1609
01:12:58,680 --> 01:12:59,680
Yeah.

1610
01:12:59,680 --> 01:13:01,240
That's $125.

1611
01:13:01,240 --> 01:13:04,340
What you get is a curtain around you're not even a curtain.

1612
01:13:04,340 --> 01:13:05,460
It's like a bed sheet.

1613
01:13:05,460 --> 01:13:10,400
It's a bed sheet, a white bed sheet, a bed sheet once used by Telly Savalas, hopefully

1614
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:11,400
clean since then.

1615
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:13,200
And now it's just strung around the table.

1616
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:15,720
That's also these hotels when it's not busy.

1617
01:13:15,720 --> 01:13:19,280
They're not terribly expensive hotels.

1618
01:13:19,280 --> 01:13:24,200
So you're practically almost at a room if you're paying for that cabana, I feel like.

1619
01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:25,200
We may as well.

1620
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:26,200
Yeah.

1621
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:29,240
Well for $150, we should have gotten a room and brought the drinks up there.

1622
01:13:29,240 --> 01:13:33,240
It would have been probably, I mean, there's a few went on hot wire or something.

1623
01:13:33,240 --> 01:13:34,760
You could have probably gotten an express deal.

1624
01:13:34,760 --> 01:13:36,560
That was like $98 from the lobby.

1625
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:37,560
Yeah.

1626
01:13:37,560 --> 01:13:41,160
You could hotel tonight a room for less than the cabana.

1627
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:50,280
But the transformer, so the transformer is Pearl Vodka, Beefeater Gin, Cruzan Rum, fresh

1628
01:13:50,280 --> 01:13:55,200
squeeze, lemon squeeze, sweet and sour mix, touch of grenadine with a float of DeCouper

1629
01:13:55,200 --> 01:13:58,200
Blue Curacao.

1630
01:13:58,200 --> 01:13:59,200
Thank you.

1631
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:00,520
I can't pronounce any of the words apparently.

1632
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:08,400
So they brought it and I was delighted because we got ourselves a rainbow cocktail in a tall

1633
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:09,400
glass.

1634
01:14:09,400 --> 01:14:10,400
Yeah.

1635
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:11,400
It's like candy.

1636
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:12,400
Blue.

1637
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:13,800
And I swear I didn't know it was that.

1638
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:17,280
I knew it was going to be something a little more touristy, sugary, but-

1639
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:21,960
You just gravitate metaphysically to these kinds of drinks.

1640
01:14:21,960 --> 01:14:24,040
But it didn't do you in, right?

1641
01:14:24,040 --> 01:14:25,040
Did you feel okay the next day?

1642
01:14:25,040 --> 01:14:26,040
No, no, no, no.

1643
01:14:26,040 --> 01:14:27,440
Not like our experience at Howl at the Moon.

1644
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:32,120
Well, I had like three drinks over six hours and it was like, and this one was very sugary.

1645
01:14:32,120 --> 01:14:33,800
This was a very lightweight.

1646
01:14:33,800 --> 01:14:39,040
This was not a Howl at the Moon trough of liquor, of blue disgusting liquor.

1647
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:42,120
How'd that end up working out for you?

1648
01:14:42,120 --> 01:14:43,120
The Howl at the Moon?

1649
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:45,440
Yeah, our Howl at the Moon experience two days ago.

1650
01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:46,440
Oh yeah.

1651
01:14:46,440 --> 01:14:47,440
Did we not talk about that?

1652
01:14:47,440 --> 01:14:48,440
I don't think we did.

1653
01:14:48,440 --> 01:14:51,000
Well, we've had some action packed sectors, so we haven't really done an after-act report.

1654
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:52,560
God, I can't keep track of anything anymore.

1655
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:53,560
Oh, it was horrible.

1656
01:14:53,560 --> 01:14:54,560
It was bad.

1657
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:55,560
Yeah.

1658
01:14:55,560 --> 01:14:56,840
I felt that was like the worst hang.

1659
01:14:56,840 --> 01:14:58,440
I didn't even feel like I was drunk.

1660
01:14:58,440 --> 01:14:59,440
I just had a hangover.

1661
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:01,000
Because it was just pure syrup.

1662
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:02,000
It was pure syrup.

1663
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:06,160
It's really, it's an equivalent to if you just had a bucket of maple syrup, which is

1664
01:15:06,160 --> 01:15:07,640
potentially a dinner that Jason would have.

1665
01:15:07,640 --> 01:15:09,280
Jason has had that before.

1666
01:15:09,280 --> 01:15:10,960
Hey, I felt worse.

1667
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:15,240
I felt worse after the Wetzel skydiving Margaritaville than I did after Howl.

1668
01:15:15,240 --> 01:15:17,800
Oh, that's an interesting sickest in the whole.

1669
01:15:17,800 --> 01:15:19,800
Maybe we'll talk about that tomorrow.

1670
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:20,800
Yeah.

1671
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:22,240
What made us the most ill?

1672
01:15:22,240 --> 01:15:24,360
That's almost a more important category then.

1673
01:15:24,360 --> 01:15:26,520
Yeah, that's a good category to add.

1674
01:15:26,520 --> 01:15:27,520
Yeah.

1675
01:15:27,520 --> 01:15:28,520
So.

1676
01:15:28,520 --> 01:15:30,560
We'll post a photo of that fun drink though.

1677
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:31,560
I would recommend that drink.

1678
01:15:31,560 --> 01:15:33,800
Wait, didn't you end up like sleepwalking or something?

1679
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:34,800
Yeah.

1680
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:35,800
Oh, was that?

1681
01:15:35,800 --> 01:15:36,800
Oh, at the Howl at the Moon.

1682
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:40,720
Didn't you like blackout sleepwalk or something?

1683
01:15:40,720 --> 01:15:44,360
The problem is, is that I've been doing this a lot lately and this is a side note is that

1684
01:15:44,360 --> 01:15:51,960
I keep, uh, Lindsay has, she insists on blackout curtains that are, that truly keep the room

1685
01:15:51,960 --> 01:15:54,040
like completely black.

1686
01:15:54,040 --> 01:16:01,280
So if I wake up at an odd moment in my cycle, in my REM cycle, I will, my brain will start

1687
01:16:01,280 --> 01:16:03,120
to invent places that I am.

1688
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:05,480
Wait, but you've had those curtains for years.

1689
01:16:05,480 --> 01:16:08,560
You told me this story years ago that this happened to you.

1690
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:09,560
That's it.

1691
01:16:09,560 --> 01:16:10,560
We really should be wrapping up.

1692
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:12,280
But yes, that is true.

1693
01:16:12,280 --> 01:16:19,000
Uh, but when she had the curtains in her old apartment, she would find me in the corner

1694
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,480
of the room in the middle of the night.

1695
01:16:21,480 --> 01:16:24,160
Like the Blair Witch Project.

1696
01:16:24,160 --> 01:16:29,160
She would wake up and I would be standing in the corner and she'd be like, Hey, uh,

1697
01:16:29,160 --> 01:16:30,160
what?

1698
01:16:30,160 --> 01:16:32,160
And I'd be like, I'm just going to the bathroom.

1699
01:16:32,160 --> 01:16:33,560
I'm just trying to.

1700
01:16:33,560 --> 01:16:37,240
And then cause like, it was so dark in there that I couldn't, you couldn't navigate.

1701
01:16:37,240 --> 01:16:38,240
I couldn't navigate.

1702
01:16:38,240 --> 01:16:41,600
And my brain thought I was still sleeping and this is what happens.

1703
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:46,720
So my brain, since there's no light whatsoever, starts inventing an area that I'm in.

1704
01:16:46,720 --> 01:16:48,520
You know what I think is happening?

1705
01:16:48,520 --> 01:16:50,800
I know this is, this is one of these odd problems.

1706
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:52,240
You don't even know the source of it.

1707
01:16:52,240 --> 01:16:54,480
You're doing bizarre things that don't track.

1708
01:16:54,480 --> 01:17:00,680
I think it's clear that all this time you were being haunted by the sector keeper.

1709
01:17:00,680 --> 01:17:02,560
He was trying to send you messages.

1710
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:06,320
Because he knew that this was coming down the pipe.

1711
01:17:06,320 --> 01:17:11,040
Like eventually it was our destiny to meet him and for us to go on this journey.

1712
01:17:11,040 --> 01:17:12,040
It's a good point.

1713
01:17:12,040 --> 01:17:16,800
And for sure that was him haunting you on hell at the moon night because we didn't invite

1714
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:17,800
him.

1715
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:18,800
So he's too young.

1716
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:19,800
Too young.

1717
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:23,920
He couldn't have come, but we should have gone on like in all ages, not gone or not

1718
01:17:23,920 --> 01:17:24,920
gone at all.

1719
01:17:24,920 --> 01:17:26,920
We shouldn't ever exclude the sector keeper.

1720
01:17:26,920 --> 01:17:27,920
That's what he was trying to tell us.

1721
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:30,480
And he's been speaking to you for apparently like a decade.

1722
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:35,280
So it's kind of like Star Trek 3.

1723
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:37,320
Or Ant-Man and the Wasp.

1724
01:17:37,320 --> 01:17:38,320
Or like, yes.

1725
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:41,960
I guess if you want to use something that happened in the last year instead of the last

1726
01:17:41,960 --> 01:17:45,240
35 years, which is what we all like to reference more.

1727
01:17:45,240 --> 01:17:46,240
Yeah.

1728
01:17:46,240 --> 01:17:47,240
But I'm going to go back to mine.

1729
01:17:47,240 --> 01:17:48,240
Back to Tally Somolis.

1730
01:17:48,240 --> 01:17:53,160
Bones was possessed by Spock after Spock put his consciousness in him at the end of Wrath

1731
01:17:53,160 --> 01:17:54,160
of Khan.

1732
01:17:54,160 --> 01:17:55,160
And he said, remember.

1733
01:17:55,160 --> 01:17:56,720
So that's sort of what's been happening to me.

1734
01:17:56,720 --> 01:18:01,320
I've had a child ghost consciousness inside of me that's been.

1735
01:18:01,320 --> 01:18:02,320
That's exactly it.

1736
01:18:02,320 --> 01:18:03,320
I'm getting it out.

1737
01:18:03,320 --> 01:18:04,320
Yeah.

1738
01:18:04,320 --> 01:18:05,320
Huh.

1739
01:18:05,320 --> 01:18:07,320
What if one of us, you know what would be a bummer to find out is like, what if one

1740
01:18:07,320 --> 01:18:09,960
of us like triggered his death?

1741
01:18:09,960 --> 01:18:13,000
What if there was some butterfly effect kind of scenario?

1742
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:18,480
I know I didn't as a child in 1994 or five, whenever he was in the closest.

1743
01:18:18,480 --> 01:18:19,480
Yeah.

1744
01:18:19,480 --> 01:18:23,840
I'm not saying that I like went up with a knife and jabbed this kid or something.

1745
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:26,960
But like, what if some, you know what might've happened?

1746
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:31,680
You know, he died in the fountain and maybe I was in line at Jody Maroney and I was the

1747
01:18:31,680 --> 01:18:34,380
one person that made the line a little too long.

1748
01:18:34,380 --> 01:18:38,200
So he said, mommy, mommy, let's go play in the fountains instead.

1749
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:39,320
And that's when he died.

1750
01:18:39,320 --> 01:18:40,360
Like I don't know.

1751
01:18:40,360 --> 01:18:41,900
I think that might be the case.

1752
01:18:41,900 --> 01:18:46,960
I think we'd maybe looking back, like if we went and looked at photo albums of our whole

1753
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:51,040
lives, we'd see the Sector Keeper constantly in all of them.

1754
01:18:51,040 --> 01:18:52,040
Wow.

1755
01:18:52,040 --> 01:18:53,040
That's very possible.

1756
01:18:53,040 --> 01:18:57,000
Like, huh, that's something to really think about leading into tomorrow's episode.

1757
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,680
Because what happens tomorrow?

1758
01:18:59,680 --> 01:19:02,960
I mean, do we, we don't know how this is going to play out.

1759
01:19:02,960 --> 01:19:07,960
We've been assuming the whole time that his spirit gets set free and that things go without

1760
01:19:07,960 --> 01:19:08,960
incident.

1761
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:12,880
But also, I don't know, we're dealing with forces we don't even understand.

1762
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:17,200
We might find out things about ourselves, about him, about our guests.

1763
01:19:17,200 --> 01:19:21,240
We'll certainly find out things about the parking garages, thankfully.

1764
01:19:21,240 --> 01:19:22,400
Yes.

1765
01:19:22,400 --> 01:19:23,400
There's a lot to that.

1766
01:19:23,400 --> 01:19:24,680
We're telling you right now.

1767
01:19:24,680 --> 01:19:26,720
And you know what?

1768
01:19:26,720 --> 01:19:28,360
Let's just hype it, who the guest is.

1769
01:19:28,360 --> 01:19:30,960
Well, the most electrifying man in podcasting entertainment.

1770
01:19:30,960 --> 01:19:33,000
Why do we leave it at that?

1771
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:34,640
Now we don't say who it is.

1772
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:35,640
Yes.

1773
01:19:35,640 --> 01:19:37,000
You have to get that with those clues.

1774
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:38,000
Okay, yeah.

1775
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:41,000
This is the ultimate challenge.

1776
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:42,000
Yeah.

1777
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:43,000
Talking garages.

1778
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:48,040
And a man who's been a coworker, VARs and various guys, could you guess?

1779
01:19:48,040 --> 01:19:50,040
So I mean, a lot to look forward to tomorrow.

1780
01:19:50,040 --> 01:19:54,080
A lot of loose ends are going to be wrapped, every single loose end will be perfectly wrapped

1781
01:19:54,080 --> 01:20:00,840
up of this dense sprawling Game of Thrones-esque epic that we've been building.

1782
01:20:00,840 --> 01:20:04,400
But before tomorrow, we have to wrap up today.

1783
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:05,760
And there it is.

1784
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:07,080
The Sector Stone.

1785
01:20:07,080 --> 01:20:09,040
The Sector 18 stone.

1786
01:20:09,040 --> 01:20:10,320
It is falling.

1787
01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:11,320
What is it?

1788
01:20:11,320 --> 01:20:12,320
Is it?

1789
01:20:12,320 --> 01:20:13,320
Wait a minute.

1790
01:20:13,320 --> 01:20:14,320
Hey, it's Telly.

1791
01:20:14,320 --> 01:20:15,320
It's Sloppy Telly.

1792
01:20:15,320 --> 01:20:16,320
Sloppy Telly.

1793
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:17,320
He's shaking like his head.

1794
01:20:17,320 --> 01:20:20,320
And he's smiling real vague.

1795
01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:27,040
There's a little glimmer, a little light is hidden in his dome there.

1796
01:20:27,040 --> 01:20:28,920
He's got a mouthful of sandwich.

1797
01:20:28,920 --> 01:20:30,880
Yeah, he's a little drunk.

1798
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:31,880
A little wet.

1799
01:20:31,880 --> 01:20:33,960
But like a good drunk.

1800
01:20:33,960 --> 01:20:34,960
But you know what?

1801
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:35,960
He's drinking a Transformer.

1802
01:20:35,960 --> 01:20:40,080
I do feel like that even if we bothered him with that mouthful of sandwich, he'd still

1803
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:41,600
play around a pool with us.

1804
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:42,600
Yeah.

1805
01:20:42,600 --> 01:20:43,600
I agree.

1806
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:45,680
He was not one to turn down a game of billiards.

1807
01:20:45,680 --> 01:20:48,080
But the stone is the exact size of a billiards ball.

1808
01:20:48,080 --> 01:20:50,560
So we got to make sure it doesn't land on the table.

1809
01:20:50,560 --> 01:20:51,560
Oh yeah.

1810
01:20:51,560 --> 01:20:52,560
Yep.

1811
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:54,260
Do you think, sorry, so side note here.

1812
01:20:54,260 --> 01:20:57,620
He was balled and when he would have a cue ball, does anybody go, hey, the ball's like

1813
01:20:57,620 --> 01:20:58,620
you are Telly.

1814
01:20:58,620 --> 01:21:00,400
And he'd go like, aha, so funny.

1815
01:21:00,400 --> 01:21:01,960
Do you think that would happen?

1816
01:21:01,960 --> 01:21:03,800
I think that's where he might draw a lot.

1817
01:21:03,800 --> 01:21:04,800
Like he would let friends go away.

1818
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:07,480
Do you beat the shit out of the guy at the pool table if they did that?

1819
01:21:07,480 --> 01:21:08,480
Crack the cue in half.

1820
01:21:08,480 --> 01:21:10,360
Stab you down the middle.

1821
01:21:10,360 --> 01:21:12,280
Impale a couple of guys.

1822
01:21:12,280 --> 01:21:15,560
The guy who made the crack and the guys who laughed.

1823
01:21:15,560 --> 01:21:17,720
And then throws everybody out the window.

1824
01:21:17,720 --> 01:21:18,720
They all land in the pool.

1825
01:21:18,720 --> 01:21:21,600
And then he says, that's what happens if you mess with Telly, baby.

1826
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:24,960
And then everyone would just clap that was in the hotel that didn't get beat up.

1827
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:25,960
Yeah.

1828
01:21:25,960 --> 01:21:26,960
Great.

1829
01:21:26,960 --> 01:21:30,320
Because they got to see, it was like seeing Kojak live.

1830
01:21:30,320 --> 01:21:34,720
Which would have been a great stunt show for Universal Studios with actual Telly Simulas.

1831
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:35,720
And he was there.

1832
01:21:35,720 --> 01:21:36,720
Yeah.

1833
01:21:36,720 --> 01:21:37,720
Big missed opportunity.

1834
01:21:37,720 --> 01:21:41,960
That's our plus up of just like the 80s of Universal Studios in general.

1835
01:21:41,960 --> 01:21:44,400
Anyway, I guess we made it.

1836
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:45,720
We're at the end of the episode.

1837
01:21:45,720 --> 01:21:50,320
I guess it's another turning point of Forks Stuck in the Road.

1838
01:21:50,320 --> 01:21:54,640
I feel like having to wrap this up, it's like time is grabbing us by the wrist and directing

1839
01:21:54,640 --> 01:21:55,640
us where to go.

1840
01:21:55,640 --> 01:21:56,640
Yeah.

1841
01:21:56,640 --> 01:21:57,640
Wow.

1842
01:21:57,640 --> 01:21:58,640
Just like The Keeper.

1843
01:21:58,640 --> 01:22:00,840
It's all tying together as will it all tomorrow.

1844
01:22:00,840 --> 01:22:02,320
All right.

1845
01:22:02,320 --> 01:22:04,280
See you tomorrow for the grand finale.

1846
01:22:04,280 --> 01:22:05,280
Bye.

1847
01:22:05,280 --> 01:22:06,280
Forever.

1848
01:22:06,280 --> 01:22:07,280
