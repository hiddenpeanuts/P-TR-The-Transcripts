1
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:01,540
Forever.

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:03,440
Dog.

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:11,620
Audience, audience, when we last left the Good Boys, they were ripped apart from each other and scattered into different corners of the multiverse.

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:21,380
The only way they can fix the dimensional rift and reunite is to record separate solo podcasts about stuff at malls next to theme parks.

5
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,660
We take you now to Jason's End of the Multiverse.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,940
We hear.

7
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,820
We hear.

8
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:51,740
We hear.

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,940
We hear.

10
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
We hear.

11
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,640
We hear.

12
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,020
We hear.

13
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:30,600
We hear.

14
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:41,580
We hear.

15
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:41,620
We hear.

16
00:01:56,660 --> 00:02:01,600
Welcome to the Pepcast, the number one Bucca de Pepo fancast.

17
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:07,600
I'm your host, the Baron of Breadsticks, the Maestro of Marinara, Jason Sheridan.

18
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:12,780
Today we're talking baked CD and I've got two great guests.

19
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:19,280
My first guest, she's a writer for the blog Carian, a part of Unorque magazine.

20
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,000
Pethys Squires is here.

21
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:22,120
Pethy, how are you?

22
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,420
It's great to be here.

23
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:24,220
I'm full of pep.

24
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:25,340
Oh, thanks.

25
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:25,820
Great.

26
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,900
That's what we want here at the Pepcast.

27
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:31,020
My other guest, you know her.

28
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,160
She's a stylist.

29
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:37,280
She's also my love, my girlfriend, Claire Jane.

30
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,300
How are you, Claire?

31
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,040
I'm good.

32
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:40,860
I'm doing good.

33
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,360
I'm also happy to be here.

34
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:45,720
I put our cat Odie in the bedroom just so like, you know, he wouldn't escape.

35
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,360
Yeah, Odie is a real handful.

36
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:54,560
So how are you all doing a couple days after a lovely Bucca meal?

37
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,780
I'm feeling pretty good, pretty level.

38
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:00,500
Yeah, it was a nice time, you know.

39
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:01,880
It was a time.

40
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:02,720
It was a time.

41
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:05,360
Oh, it was quite a time, all right.

42
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:12,340
Now, I'm learning that next to Bucca, not only is there a theme park,

43
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:17,000
there's this outdoor shopping and dining destination called City Walk.

44
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,560
And I had you both on because I figured maybe you could educate me.

45
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:25,080
You both spent a lot of time up there at City Walk, correct?

46
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,040
Yeah, definitely.

47
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:30,080
I've hit some of the shops there, some of the,

48
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:33,940
I guess you could call it food establishments up there.

49
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,680
You don't know anything about it, OK?

50
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:36,980
I don't know anything.

51
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,400
Yeah, you used to work at the theme park.

52
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:43,080
Now, how did you hide this in our relationship for so long?

53
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:48,480
Well, I'm an actor, and that's why I worked at Universal Studios Hollywood,

54
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,040
because I'm an actor.

55
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:54,460
Like, I don't want to, you know, the first time guest, longtime listener.

56
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:59,020
Jason, you talk about Bucca de Pepo a lot, and I think maybe it just,

57
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:05,960
you're so focused on the Pepo that some details of other people's lives don't come through.

58
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:07,860
Well, yeah, that's true.

59
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:12,100
And, you know, I usually get out of a taxi in front of Bucca.

60
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:16,360
I go right in to the Pepo and I come right out.

61
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:21,260
And I've often asked myself, like, what's all that racket over there?

62
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,200
All that sound and light.

63
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:27,340
But I had never really investigated until we went up there.

64
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:30,140
Bright lights, big city, baby.

65
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:31,240
Oh, yes.

66
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:31,860
Good.

67
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:37,340
Pethy, you said you were wearing some items from this location.

68
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,940
Yeah, I know it's weird, but I like theme parks.

69
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:42,500
I mean, I'm just weird like that, I guess.

70
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:45,700
And yeah, I go there a lot.

71
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,100
I'm an annual pass holder.

72
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:56,120
And I do, I just happen to be wearing my old Hard Rock pendant from when there used to be a Hard Rock there.

73
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,180
It's, of course, now a Wonka's Emporium.

74
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:02,400
And then I have socks on from the Los Angeles sock exchange.

75
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,000
They have a store there that's just socks.

76
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:04,560
It's great.

77
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,540
Oh, wow.

78
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,360
You should go.

79
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,940
Yeah, I can't say I've ever heard anything like that.

80
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:13,140
But enough of talking about other establishments.

81
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,880
Let's get into our Pepo meal.

82
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:22,600
Now, we had kind of a mix of stuff, you know, we tried a variety of items.

83
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,820
Pethy, you had a Martini?

84
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,520
I see vodka on the receipt.

85
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,900
I had an espresso martini.

86
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:29,900
How was that?

87
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:32,180
It was fine when it got there.

88
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:38,300
I don't, look, I know this restaurant means a lot to you and I don't want to come in hot.

89
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,580
Oh, please be honest.

90
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,800
Don't hold anything back.

91
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,560
We are no holds barred here.

92
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,180
Okay.

93
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:49,400
I worry that Bucatepepo is a dark nexus in the American culture.

94
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,160
Okay.

95
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,320
Interesting take.

96
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:52,980
Have not heard that one before.

97
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:53,960
Please go on.

98
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:00,620
So the espresso martini, it took a long time to get there because we were sat upstairs.

99
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:05,780
And it seems like maybe the people who have to work upstairs don't like it.

100
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:11,680
Because as I was walking up the stairs, I heard a server stomping down and said,

101
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:13,740
I'm not running shit up there.

102
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:19,660
And then see me and deer in the headlights, fear in her eyes and just she is zoomed past me.

103
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:22,140
Okay.

104
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:28,600
That's the first time I've ever heard anyone talk negative about the area that I call the bird's nest.

105
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:40,000
And so, yeah, we, Claire and I took the elevator because I, you know, have little difficulty getting around sometimes.

106
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,480
What did you think about that elevator, Claire?

107
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:48,360
Well, it was interesting because it was very small, windowless.

108
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:54,160
And as you were using it and going up or down, there were boot, boot, boot.

109
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:56,720
It's okay.

110
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:57,160
It's okay.

111
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,620
It's okay.

112
00:06:58,620 --> 00:06:59,800
It's called Boca de Pepo.

113
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,820
Yeah, yeah, that's okay.

114
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:05,600
It's called Boca de Pepo.

115
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:07,000
And there were.

116
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,900
There were Boca ads.

117
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:12,620
We were laughing about that.

118
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,820
Like we're already here in the restaurant, Robert Earl.

119
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:18,400
You don't have to sell the restaurant to us.

120
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:23,620
To entice us, I guess, to get to our table upstairs.

121
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:26,760
And it kind of smelled, but it also took a long time.

122
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,660
It was pretty fun.

123
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:30,340
It was a long elevator.

124
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:35,480
It almost seemed like a large dumb waiter that we were told to go into.

125
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:38,880
We also could not operate it ourselves.

126
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:42,340
Someone had to begrudgingly get us in and out of it.

127
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:42,940
Yeah.

128
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:47,000
And then meanwhile, the stairs just has the ugliest murals you've seen in your life.

129
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:50,180
Just faces that are so close to looking like human faces.

130
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:51,540
Okay.

131
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:52,860
All right.

132
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,700
Well, this is again.

133
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:59,400
This is a unique episode 99 and we're finally getting some criticism.

134
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,100
So that's great.

135
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:01,760
That's great.

136
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:06,600
Like the the people on the Reddit will be happy about the Pepo Reddit.

137
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,820
And check that out, everyone.

138
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:12,380
Also, please check out our drip page.

139
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:16,600
That's the crowdfunding website started by Kickstarter.

140
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,880
It's a big hit.

141
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:21,280
Our drip keeps growing and growing.

142
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:24,560
Soon it'll be what's bigger than a drip.

143
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,100
Anyone?

144
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,420
I don't know.

145
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:26,940
Drizzle.

146
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,080
Oh, soon it'll be a drizzle.

147
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,380
I like that a lot.

148
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:34,360
Well, I'm going to have to say that more often.

149
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:37,660
So keep keep giving to that drip account.

150
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:41,180
And as you know, I don't even have to keep saying it.

151
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:44,040
It's a website we all visit on a daily basis.

152
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,320
It's a huge hit.

153
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:48,780
So let's get into our meal.

154
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,160
We started off with a small mixed green salad.

155
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,980
What did you both think about this?

156
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:59,340
I thought it was it was fine.

157
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,820
A lot of iceberg lettuce.

158
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:05,380
I got really excited about the olives and realized there were only like two.

159
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:09,300
And then the one I got also had a piece of a pit in it, which was a surprise.

160
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:14,400
But, yeah, you know, a nice little little starter white salad.

161
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,900
Yeah, you know, normal, normal salad.

162
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,740
Olive garden ask.

163
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:25,060
I don't know if we can't mention other Italian chains here, but it's about this.

164
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,280
I mean, that's OK.

165
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:26,960
That's OK.

166
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,100
Don't worry about it.

167
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:28,320
I'm sorry.

168
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,700
I, you know, fine.

169
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:37,180
We did say fine a lot this meal in for a mixed green salad.

170
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:39,980
And it did have an awful lot of iceberg lettuce.

171
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,560
Yeah, one green, one green salad.

172
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:44,520
Yeah, that's pretty funny.

173
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,600
Yeah, it is a one green salad.

174
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:49,320
It wasn't really mixed at all.

175
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,620
And yeah, there wasn't a lot of olives.

176
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,000
I ate one of the two.

177
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,700
I do not like olives.

178
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:58,420
I kind of didn't realize I was eating it.

179
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:04,240
You took a precious olive away and you didn't mean to or you didn't enjoy it.

180
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,080
And you took it away.

181
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:07,440
That's a slap in the freaking face, man.

182
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,300
Why did you do that?

183
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,660
It's a salad for three people and there's on pit.

184
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:11,080
You will.

185
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:11,780
OK.

186
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:12,840
Exactly.

187
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:14,560
And you took one.

188
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,280
Oh, I'm kind of mad.

189
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,660
Look, that's fine.

190
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:22,420
I was at the meal kind of it kind of threw me off my game.

191
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:28,680
Honestly, I have the you you had said like, oh, we have to try the giant meatballs.

192
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,260
We have to try the kind of a signature there.

193
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:37,500
And if I can get in on the criticism game a little, these were the driest meatballs

194
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:41,220
I've ever eaten in my in my life.

195
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,920
But it was very fun.

196
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,980
And you took one home to your husband.

197
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,420
How did they feel about it?

198
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,980
I think they felt it was fine.

199
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:54,960
You know, we had to cut it in half to get it into the container

200
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,940
because they didn't have a container big enough for the giant meatballs.

201
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:04,320
Yeah, it was a little surprising to not get a custom meatball container because it's kind of a signature there.

202
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:09,200
Like you could use like those boxes, corsages come in and then everyone could see the beautiful meatball.

203
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:11,980
I think that would really elevate the take home presentation.

204
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,200
I mean, I can put that in my next letter to Robert Earl.

205
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:21,660
He hasn't answered any of the other ones, but I can certainly try.

206
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:30,180
Also, looking at our bill at the end, I've got the receipt here to go in my scrapbook of Bucca receipts.

207
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:37,800
Those three giant meatballs worth thirty dollars, which breaks down to roughly ten dollars a meatball.

208
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:40,780
And I'm not quite sure about the economics of that.

209
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:48,380
Yeah, I wanted to get the meatballs because some of my favorite pictures ever taken are of

210
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,620
Vigara holding giant meatballs at Bucca di Beppo.

211
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:54,200
And that's what I wanted to show these to you.

212
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:57,140
I mean, I'm sure as an old hand, you've probably seen them before.

213
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:07,300
But specifically, this one of her doing a sort of what I think of as Larry David in whatever works hand gesture.

214
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,660
Oh, my God.

215
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:11,560
She's got a whole table full of giant meatballs.

216
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,280
Hundreds of dollars of meatballs.

217
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:18,500
It was a fundraiser that she would do there called Meatballs for Niños.

218
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,720
I'm not sure what it raised money for.

219
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,360
But she did it a couple of times.

220
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:31,320
Look, celebrity fundraisers, that money doesn't just disappear or anything.

221
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,260
So I'm assuming it probably went to the Niños.

222
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:36,700
The Niños.

223
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,160
Shit out of luck, I'm guessing.

224
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,500
Ripped to the Niños.

225
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,680
God, it's such a man's world.

226
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,540
Women can't have anything.

227
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,100
I swear to God.

228
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:50,340
But is this a good time for me to bring up the other pictures of celebrities at Bucca di Beppo?

229
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,980
Yes, please.

230
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,280
So at my work at Cariann, I have access to like a big Getty database.

231
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:06,900
And so one day I just searched Bucca di Beppo and there is, I think, 47 pages of people getting their picture taken.

232
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,360
Forty seven pictures?

233
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,640
No, 47 pages.

234
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:10,360
Wow.

235
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,200
Fifty pictures per page.

236
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:12,640
What?

237
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,000
This is my dream.

238
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,700
Of people getting their picture taken at the Times Square, Bucca di Beppo.

239
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:25,140
And it's, okay, here is a woman who I'm told is famous.

240
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:30,960
Oh, is this Angie from Jersey Shore or Gina or whatever?

241
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,600
I don't know, but that's quite a picture.

242
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:40,580
She's holding meatballs in her hands over her boobs, like on them.

243
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,500
Oh, as if they were breasts.

244
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,180
I see.

245
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:44,680
It's a sort of simulacrum, yeah.

246
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,620
And then here's Snooki and Jwoww.

247
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:55,480
And they do the thing that a lot of people do there where, so when you're a celebrity and you go to Bucca di Beppo,

248
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,240
hopefully this will happen for you someday,

249
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:05,880
they present a bowl of marinara and you dip your hands in it like Grauman's Chinese theater.

250
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:08,180
And then you put it on the wall.

251
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:10,700
You put your hands on a piece of paper.

252
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:15,980
Then they frame just rotting tomato sauce with your signature on it.

253
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:17,440
And that's just up there now.

254
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:24,340
I mean, I've done this recreationally and they don't seem to like it any time I do it.

255
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:31,300
And there's three types of people who seem to go do the handprint thing at the Bucca di Beppo Times Square.

256
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:34,580
It's Miss Universe or Miss USA.

257
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,120
Wait.

258
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,380
Sorry, I'll add it out later.

259
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:43,160
Professional poker, like World Series of Poker Champion.

260
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,680
And underage Disney stars.

261
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:48,680
And that's it.

262
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,640
The trifecta of fame.

263
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,500
Oh my God.

264
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:58,720
Well, sorry I had interrupted you, but I did like two pageants when I was younger in Florida, like in my 20s, not like baby.

265
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:04,880
But I remember like the girl who won, they would often do like events at the Bucca.

266
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:08,820
And I just thought it was like, oh, that's just where like in town they like whatever.

267
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:15,100
I feel like there is like a legit like maybe corporation something kind of tie in.

268
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,760
Because it's not the first time I've heard about like pageantry and Bucca.

269
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:18,740
I'm not kidding you.

270
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:24,420
No, that tracks me right because I think Robert Earl has his hands in a lot of pizza pies.

271
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:29,120
Is this a good time to bring up the housewives of it all?

272
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:32,880
Yes, you also mentioned Housewife Connection.

273
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:43,520
Yeah, Robert Earl shows up on Real Housewives of Beverly Hills and Vanderpump roles like some like more than I would assume a chain restaurateur would.

274
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:46,140
I mean, he's a star.

275
00:15:47,300 --> 00:16:00,980
After Miss Universe, World Series of Poker Players and Child Actors, Robert Earl is like number four or number one, like above all those people in terms of the fame game, at least my fame game.

276
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:02,680
Sure.

277
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:18,100
And so he the first time I noticed him was I was watching an episode of Vanderpump Rules and he goes with Lisa Vanderpump to check out what will eventually become Pump Restaurant in WeHo, which is since closed during Scandival.

278
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,260
But he's just like, it's going to be fabulous here.

279
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:30,860
And Lisa Vanderpump of course makes some joke that like the gay waiters are going to blow him and he's like, oh you and it's very like that energy.

280
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:32,080
Oh my God.

281
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:33,620
Lisa always has.

282
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:46,220
And then in an episode of Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, there was a whole arc where he had Dorit decorate a room in the Encino Bucatipepo.

283
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:48,660
Oh, I've always wanted to go there.

284
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,800
Yeah, my dream.

285
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:55,520
Okay, we're going to talk about the other thing that the Encino Bucatipepo is famous for near the end.

286
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:57,500
Let's get through some happiness first.

287
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:57,920
Okay.

288
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:58,620
Okay.

289
00:16:58,620 --> 00:16:59,640
We can't wait.

290
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:08,080
But yeah, so there's a there was a huge fight at the Encino Bucatipepo in the Capri room when

291
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:18,020
it was this whole thing where where Brandi Glanville said that she had slept with Denise Richards and Denise Richards said that they didn't even really know each other and blah blah blah blah blah.

292
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:26,580
But if you've ever wanted to see a woman having like full body sobs claiming that she ate somebody out in a Bucatipepo

293
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,100
season 10 finale of Real Housewives of Beverly Hills.

294
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:34,600
Well, it wouldn't be the first time I experienced something like that.

295
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:38,800
But, you know, you do a podcast long enough you've seen everything.

296
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:39,740
And I mean restaurants.

297
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:44,180
It's this, you know, it's a very event heavy restaurant and, you know, tensions are running high.

298
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:47,260
People are stressed out about whether the party is going to happen while we were there.

299
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:50,260
There was a book publishing.

300
00:17:50,780 --> 00:18:02,360
Okay, so from what I can gather, it was like maybe also a birthday party, but it was also like very clearly very like, you know, a group of religious people.

301
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,680
They did all do a mass prayer together.

302
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,820
And this was a pretty big long table.

303
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,780
And then at one point it was just us in there with them.

304
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:16,680
So I caught a woman going, okay, Jeremy, this is why I'm grateful for you.

305
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:20,680
I never really had a brother like you because my real brothers didn't do it.

306
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,320
And I believe God brought you to me.

307
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:25,600
And I was like, we got to get the fuck out of here.

308
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:31,180
And I was scooting out of a very, the very tight booth we were sitting in.

309
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:35,100
And I'm like, oh, someone is giving a very heartfelt toast.

310
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,580
I should get out of here.

311
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:45,080
And then we got around the corner and Claire here was like, those people were very religious.

312
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:48,920
And I was like, this is probably not the best time to bring up.

313
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:51,320
I bought two copies of those books.

314
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:54,100
So but one for each of us, dear.

315
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,320
Thank you.

316
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,700
You got to commemorate every.

317
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:58,640
That's true.

318
00:18:59,500 --> 00:18:59,500
Yeah.

319
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:01,300
Yeah.

320
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,240
Yeah.

321
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:07,620
So just kind of off my game now.

322
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:10,500
I almost said, who could the Beppo earlier?

323
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:12,780
Like, I know you said it's OK.

324
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:13,580
It's very common.

325
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:16,480
It's very common mistake.

326
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:20,060
But BDP, that doesn't even make sense as an abbreviation.

327
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:21,800
Let's get to the big CD.

328
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,700
The reason we're all here today.

329
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:25,880
Yeah.

330
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:28,100
Yeah, it's fine.

331
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,200
Yeah, it was.

332
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,020
It was fine.

333
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:37,680
I liked the the Rosa sauce, which I think they just mix the red sauce and the white sauce together,

334
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,680
like in a pitcher and then pour it over the CD.

335
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:41,720
The sauce pitcher.

336
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:42,260
Yeah.

337
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:42,960
OK.

338
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,580
So that's like a known thing.

339
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,260
The sauce pitcher.

340
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:50,460
You know, you walk through the kitchen and you can see a little bit of how it's being made.

341
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:56,600
I I did realize that the I guess chef's table, you might call it,

342
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:59,920
when we were leaving was actually just the workers eating their food at that table.

343
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:01,420
It was just the workers table.

344
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:06,420
So I thought that was interesting because I thought it was like a, you know,

345
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:10,920
a special experience, more just like a little break room that's invisible to everybody.

346
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:12,880
Yeah, I was kind of disappointed by that.

347
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:19,180
That's supposed to be a whole experience and appeared to be two men all in black having their like family meal.

348
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,260
Yeah, their shift meal.

349
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:21,260
Yeah.

350
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,000
What a shift meal to have.

351
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:25,220
Yeah.

352
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:29,520
Dorit spoke lovingly of eating at the chef's table at the Encino Bucatipepo.

353
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,920
We must go.

354
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:35,000
That Capri room makes you feel like you're on the island of Capri.

355
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:38,980
And I don't know how they manage that with just a bunch of false lemons.

356
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,020
And white enamel.

357
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:42,400
Hey, very good.

358
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:43,700
Oh, wow.

359
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:44,720
White enamel.

360
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:45,620
Nice.

361
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:48,420
Fake lemons and white enamel.

362
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:57,220
I will say the the chef's table at the CityWalk Pep is very close to the bathrooms and also obviously like kitchen adjacent.

363
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,760
So while we were leaving, it was getting closer to close time.

364
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:05,340
And so I think they were breaking down the kitchen and that whole area just smelled like bleach.

365
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:11,240
So maybe like so, you know, good on them for staying sanitary, you know, keep that A rating.

366
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:11,980
Love it.

367
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:12,700
Work it, girl.

368
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:19,480
But not the most pleasurable eating experience if they just douse the whole place in bleach.

369
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:20,080
I agree.

370
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:25,240
I didn't love that the just me personally, sound a little bit of a germaphobe.

371
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:30,240
I didn't love that the bathrooms were like literally like right basically like in the kitchen.

372
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:36,400
Like, I don't know, it just kind of weirded me out because it also a little bit felt like maybe it was like the employee restroom.

373
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,880
Like you're in the back of the kitchen.

374
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:39,020
This might just be a me thing.

375
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:40,720
I do have bathroom like OCD.

376
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:43,720
But I was like, what did it love in our area?

377
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:48,940
There was like an upstairs like chef or not chef, like waiters station.

378
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:56,300
And it was like adjoining our room because, you know, like all all buka de pepo's have sort of like warren's of little intimate dining rooms.

379
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:56,600
Oh, yes.

380
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:03,060
Ours was next to like their prep area, which also meant it was next to their like throw away trash area.

381
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:09,600
So near the end of the night also, I did get a whiff of just the trash from that room coming into our dining area.

382
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:10,820
Yikes.

383
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:18,060
Yeah, I think we're starting to see like a good 30 plus years of this place being open.

384
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,760
Maybe they should knock some walls down.

385
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:27,180
Maybe they've taken the intimate Italian restaurant thing as far as one can take it.

386
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:35,380
But you don't enjoy being in a really nice intimate room with multiple screaming toddlers running around as well and having meltdowns.

387
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,880
I mean, I think it built to the ambiance.

388
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:42,900
It certainly adds to the ambiance of every wall surface being covered in pictures.

389
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:52,260
And going from that to very loud prayer gatherings was was a bit of a shock.

390
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:59,060
But, you know, hey, let's let's go to something else positive every time I go to buka de pep.

391
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:05,400
I got to order the Buddy V's cake slices and we we did two.

392
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:08,340
We restrained ourselves.

393
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:09,460
We didn't get three.

394
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:13,140
So this time we did the rainbow cake and the black and white cake.

395
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:14,800
What did you all think of these cakes?

396
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,500
They were very pretty.

397
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:21,800
But the second you like put a fork near them, the levels just all kind of split apart.

398
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:25,480
But the contrast of the colors was really nice.

399
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:34,660
It was it was, you know, it was cake and the fudge frosting on the chocolate one, like in between the layers.

400
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:35,700
That was pretty good.

401
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:36,860
It tastes like chocolate.

402
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:42,760
The cake didn't really taste a lot like chocolate, but the fudge in between, I will say that icing was quite good.

403
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:47,060
I don't want to be like a weird conspiracy theorist or anything, but I kind of got you to be.

404
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:52,360
I got the sense that maybe they added extra oil to the cake to make it seem moist for longer.

405
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:59,080
I don't want to be like insane here, but it did say a little oily.

406
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,960
Oh, that's a really good point.

407
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:06,760
That's interesting because the parts I got like the meatballs were very dry.

408
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:07,820
Hmm.

409
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:08,440
It is.

410
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:13,880
Well, the icing, I mean, hey, something positive.

411
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:19,580
You always want to hear the chocolate icing tastes like chocolate.

412
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:22,280
That's a positive.

413
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:27,060
It was the in between the layers because the top there was still white icing, right?

414
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:30,940
Yeah, there was the white icing and like the little jimmies on the end.

415
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:31,920
And that tasted like nothing.

416
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,680
Yeah, it really didn't taste like anything.

417
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,140
It barely tasted like sugar, you know?

418
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:37,700
Sometimes you can taste frosting and it's like, oh, this is just clearly sugar.

419
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:40,040
It kind of just tastes like paste.

420
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:41,780
Like it just was like paste.

421
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:50,480
So I think I said that night that it kind of had the feeling of eating food in a dream where your brain kind of knows you're not tasting anything.

422
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:53,520
I still don't know if we really eat that cake.

423
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:54,300
I agree with you.

424
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,900
I totally get what you're saying.

425
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,700
Buddy Valestro like Robert Earl.

426
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:05,400
I'm shocked with let something be seemingly less than stellar quality.

427
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:07,420
You know what?

428
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:08,320
You're probably right.

429
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,100
You're probably right.

430
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:18,400
Just, you know, I think but speaking of Buddy Valestro, Robert Earl and 30 years of Buka, I know you try to focus on the food and stay out of the politics.

431
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:18,980
OK.

432
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:19,560
On the show.

433
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:22,120
You don't like bringing up, you know, dark stuff randomly.

434
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:23,700
No, I'm scared of it.

435
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:26,440
I'm scared of most things on topic.

436
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,120
100 percent.

437
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:28,540
That's the Jason Sheridan promise.

438
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:29,220
Yes.

439
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:33,860
But I do feel like I have to talk a little bit about the history of Buka Di Peppo.

440
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:34,500
OK.

441
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:48,000
So it was founded by not Robert Earl, but a different guy who's Phil Roberts, different Robert, Phil Roberts, who not Italian in the slightest.

442
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:49,500
OK.

443
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:54,500
He said that he wanted to make a restaurant that people could look down on.

444
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:55,780
That's a direct quote.

445
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,060
Oh, my God.

446
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:58,580
We don't.

447
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:05,720
I like I kind of reword that quote sometimes of something people could look up on.

448
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:07,840
OK.

449
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:10,500
He wouldn't love that, but that's OK.

450
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,060
OK.

451
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:21,240
So his idea was he wanted to do like a parody of Italian red sauce joints and put all of the trashiest like Italian stereotyping he could find on the walls.

452
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:21,940
Oh, my God.

453
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:24,780
But he hired a Milanese chef to make the food.

454
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:35,140
So the food was not a joke, but the walls and he wanted in the wine list, he wanted to make sure that people felt superior while they were dining there.

455
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:44,680
He said that he knew that he had he had done a good job when he was walking by a couple and a couple pointed to his statues that I would never have that thing in my house.

456
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:47,280
And he was like, yes, I did it.

457
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,040
Oh, my God.

458
00:26:49,800 --> 00:27:06,360
So that it starts becoming a larger chain and they hire a new CEO who's actually Italian American Joseph Micotrato from Cleveland, who he goes he starts saying that Bucatipeppo is named after.

459
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:07,640
I'm so sorry.

460
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:08,640
I did it again.

461
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,620
Bucatipeppo is named after.

462
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:11,380
Peppo, Peppo.

463
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:15,600
Like you got some pep in your step after eating a couple pounds of pasta.

464
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:17,100
The story just doesn't make me feel peppy.

465
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:28,560
He says that his his that the place is named after his grandpa Peppo and that all of the recipes that the Milanese chef had created were his grandmother's recipe book.

466
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:32,320
OK, yeah, I didn't know a lot of this story.

467
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,740
I did know about Grandpa Peppo.

468
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:49,620
Yeah, I mean, Grandpa Peppo becomes like a huge part of the mythology even after this guy later leaves because he was charged with stealing more than two hundred thousand dollars from the company to buy an Italian villa.

469
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,460
OK, well, that's all of our dreams.

470
00:27:53,460 --> 00:28:05,720
Because, you know, I've been working pretty diligently my day job, of course, at the Los Angeles Hazardous Waste Disposal site, and I've been trying to save up money for years now to get that villa.

471
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:08,340
You know, I'm very passionate.

472
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:14,780
My two passions in life, Bucatipeppo and proper hazardous waste disposal.

473
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,360
It's more important now than ever.

474
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:19,380
Don't throw out your batteries.

475
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:22,440
You certainly don't throw out your lithium ion batteries.

476
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,140
Properly dispose of them, folks.

477
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:31,040
So then it's bought by Robert Earl, who combines it with Planet Hollywood.

478
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:35,280
The Bucatipeppo in New York is also Planet Hollywood.

479
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:40,200
And that's why, OK, all of those Disney stars were there, I guess.

480
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:41,660
I hope.

481
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:44,240
Yeah, that makes a little more sense.

482
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:46,280
But like, yeah, that's still OK.

483
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:46,680
All right.

484
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,700
Continue, continue.

485
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:52,540
And then the last thing and then we can we can wrap up on a nice note.

486
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:55,200
I just have to get this out there because it's my first thought.

487
00:28:55,420 --> 00:29:08,900
Anytime I see a Bucatipeppo is the Encino Bucatipeppo, the one with Dorit's Capri room was also where Phil Hartman's wife had her last meal before, you know.

488
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:10,080
Oh my God.

489
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:11,400
OK.

490
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,300
This is.

491
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,140
I know.

492
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:14,460
I'm sorry.

493
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:15,760
I know you don't like bummer.

494
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:16,640
Yeah, no.

495
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:17,500
Weird history.

496
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:19,700
And I'm really sorry to do this to you.

497
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:35,300
That's that's like that Vitello Studio City Italian restaurant that I don't even want to set foot in because last meal where Robert Blake and his wife shared a meal before the murder.

498
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:36,880
Yeah, I don't know.

499
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,700
Did she get to finish that meal?

500
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,920
Anyway, let's talk about the dessert.

501
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:48,860
So not the best buddy V-cakes I've ever had, but that's OK, because, hey, we bought the picture.

502
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,760
You know, I got to get the picture.

503
00:29:51,780 --> 00:30:00,120
We went for the black and white one, which, you know, as we're in a criticism mood today does make us look like we all died in a plane crash.

504
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:01,880
But that's OK.

505
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,480
It's in a frame.

506
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:08,940
And I it was like a flat picture frame, like, you know, thick paper.

507
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:11,880
But then I opened the back so you can actually make it like look propped up.

508
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,840
And it does really kind of look like that.

509
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,200
But also it's really cute.

510
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:17,620
It is a pretty cute picture.

511
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:25,400
And we all kind of work work together to choose a lovely photographer actually got to us before our food.

512
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:30,580
We are seated at an largely empty table.

513
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,680
We have some waters and an iced tea.

514
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,920
I don't have my martini.

515
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:34,700
Excuse me.

516
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:35,780
I almost called you Bethy.

517
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:39,120
Yeah, you didn't even have your martini yet.

518
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:43,320
So but a great picture quality.

519
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,320
And they gave us three to choose from.

520
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:49,560
And I guess they just you know, I was wondering this.

521
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:52,600
So do they just throw those ones away?

522
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:58,080
I mean, I guess maybe obviously, but also that is so many pictures to waste.

523
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:01,600
And like, you know, do they maybe go somewhere else?

524
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:11,220
Is it at some restaurant somewhere in another place where they're just like, we'll give you pictures of people that, you know, like, I don't know where they maybe Robert Earl has a large surveillance network.

525
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:12,980
And this is a record of everyone has been there.

526
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:19,220
And they're doing they're doing training face recognition AI on all of our discarded Buka picks.

527
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:24,540
Look, I spent 99 episodes trying to figure out where all the other photos go.

528
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:29,660
And, you know, Occam's Razor, the simplest solution is likely the right one.

529
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:32,740
So they probably just end up in a garbage dump.

530
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:35,840
But also, they could be training AI.

531
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,280
Who knows?

532
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,780
Where do the pictures go, Robert?

533
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:41,180
What's going on?

534
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Oh, man, this really gives me a lot to think about that.

535
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:47,580
Hey, let's let's get to our rating.

536
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:55,080
Of course, every episode, we rate our meal on a scale from Robert Earl to Robert Earl.

537
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:58,320
Clary, what do you what do you think?

538
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,260
Let's start with you.

539
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:04,260
You know, I think I'm going to split the difference and just give it a Robert.

540
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:05,980
Great.

541
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:06,880
Great.

542
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:08,000
Middle of the road.

543
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:09,460
Pethy.

544
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:13,360
Yeah, I would I would go with just a across the board Robert.

545
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:14,540
Yeah.

546
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:16,720
Like a yeah.

547
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:17,940
A Robert E.

548
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:19,540
One more than that.

549
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:19,800
OK.

550
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:20,580
Slightly above.

551
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:21,740
OK.

552
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:22,020
All right.

553
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:24,560
And I'm going to give it a Robert E.

554
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,240
A.

555
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:30,840
because I just can't bring myself to call it anything lower.

556
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,520
This was a hard one.

557
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:38,340
OK.

558
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:41,960
Now let's, you know, head for the pasta portal.

559
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:43,700
Who's got some plugs?

560
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,260
The pasta plug portal.

561
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:53,660
Yeah, I have a zine that I just finished making called Girlzine.

562
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:57,640
It's about all the girl stuff from last year.

563
00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:01,020
For some reason, it's under Bethy Squires, not Pethy Squires.

564
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:04,400
That's also my Twitter is at Bethy B.

565
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:04,620
Q.

566
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:04,620
S.

567
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:07,020
You and Instagram, Bethy Squires.

568

569
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:13,780
Great.

570
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:14,420
Great.

571
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:17,280
Claire, anything you want to talk about or plug?

572
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:21,760
I just want to say I think Pethy is like so cool and like genuinely.

573
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:25,040
I just want to give her like props because she rocks.

574
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:28,100
But I am a stylist.

575
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:32,740
So if you have any events coming up or you just want to closet refresh

576
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:36,880
or you just want a little consultation, you can hit me up.

577
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:40,820
I'm at Jane Claire styling because at Claire Jane styling was taken.

578
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:43,160
So I had to like do the stupid swap thing.

579
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:49,160
So you can find me there and say hi.

580
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:50,180
Great.

581
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:50,720
Great.

582
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:56,160
As for me, folks, next episode, very exciting episode 100,

583
00:33:56,800 --> 00:34:00,140
we're finally tackling spaghetti and meatballs.

584
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:04,300
Little Meatball Talk today to get everyone fired up.

585
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:09,160
You know, and our guest, we had to get a big guest for this episode.

586
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:10,920
And folks, it's a big get.

587
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:14,820
It's like a big giant meatball size get.

588
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:19,400
It's the totally epic former vice president, Tim Kaine.

589
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:20,160
That's right.

590
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:21,980
Tim Kaine in the membrane.

591
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,300
Tim Kaine in the brain.

592
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:28,220
We're going to talk about a totally epic term as VP under President Clinton,

593
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:32,440
a term that happened just before the event.

594
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:39,240
But we're not here to talk about sad stuff like the event.

595
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:41,160
We're here to talk.

596
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:44,160
Peppo, Boogie the Peppo, to be precise.

597
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,060
None of that Peppo nonsense.

598
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:47,840
No, it's Boogie the Peppo.

599
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:50,300
I've been your host, Jason Sheridan.
