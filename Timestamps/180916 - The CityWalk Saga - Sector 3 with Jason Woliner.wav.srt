1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Forever...

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Dog!

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:11,000
When your town has let you down

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
When your port has fallen short

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
When you're too worn out to run

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
And need some ribs or a Cinnabon

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
You need a place, a place for rock

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
A place for roll

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
A place where Oakland Raiders merch is sold

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
A sublime hot topic and billabong

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
A place where you can purchase a candy thong

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
So let's go take a walk

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Let's all go to City Walk

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Tonight, tonight

15
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
There's no way of knowing

16
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Jason Sheridan

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Hi, I'm here too

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Yes, and we're joined by a returning guest who is here

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I think in one of our most well-received episodes

20
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
He was talking about one of the craziest things we've talked about, Hard Rock Park

21
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,000
And now back to talk about an area of City Walk much less interesting than that

22
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Jason Walliner

23
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Thanks for having me back, guys. I'm very excited to be a part of this series

24
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Very happy to have you back

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
And I realized before doing this that this is your

26
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I mean, we ended up splitting that other episode in two

27
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
So this technically is your third episode

28
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Which makes you the top running guest of the show

29
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
You really are, I would say, the Alec Baldwin of Podcast The Rock

30
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
True insult

31
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
What do you mean?

32
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
You're good enough to be one of us

33
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
You could be one of the podcast

34
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
And if you had gone down a different path, you could have been one of those

35
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
One of the not ready for podcast players

36
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:33,000
As Scott said earlier to us before we all met up, you were in the three timers club

37
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Am I the whole three timers club?

38
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
You are the three timers club

39
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
So stretch out, enjoy it while you got her

40
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
And Jason, you just had a baby recently

41
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
That's correct

42
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
That sounded like you were setting up for a Byron Allen comics unleashed moment

43
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I am so officially setting myself up for a Byron Allen comics unleashed moment

44
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
So we wanted to get you a baby

45
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Oh my god, that's so nice of you

46
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
And I think it will become apparent what it is when you take that rubber band off

47
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
It's a scroll, I'm taking the rubber band

48
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Off, and I'm unfurling it, oh my god

49
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
It is a legit map of Hard Rock Park

50
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
This is an original opening

51
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
This is incredible

52
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Definitely framing it and putting it in my child's room

53
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
We were hoping it would go in the nursery

54
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
So your child can see that they too can accomplish great things

55
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I'll tell him as soon as he can talk, just every day, that one day I'll take him to Hard Rock Park

56
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
And just describe it as this wondrous place

57
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
You and me, bud

58
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
And then one day I'll tell him the truth, or I'll just play him the episode

59
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I'll send him the link one day, we won't be speaking probably at that point

60
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Forget him on a plane to Myrtle Beach

61
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Yeah, I love the map, there's actually a picture of that guy from the banana splits and an arrow

62
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
These are all the hits, the life in the fast lane

63
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Let's just do that episode again

64
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It is an actively cumbersome piece of paper

65
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Imagine carrying this around in 100 degrees with humidity

66
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
That's how they would just hand that out at the park

67
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
That's the park map, yeah that's the map

68
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Because you would think it would be more like the Disneyland map

69
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Which is just a tiny little tourist camp

70
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
It's very big

71
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
But there is, yeah, there's the bare metal families here

72
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Winston the punk rock dog is represented

73
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Oh man, you haven't listened to the episode guys

74
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Go stop right now, go back and listen

75
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
There's over three hours of it

76
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
If you joined us for City Walk

77
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I'm sick of these people who came only to listen to the City Walk series

78
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
We have a whole show, guys

79
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Don't ignore the rest of podcasts

80
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
There's actually something we didn't cover in the episode in here

81
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
There's actually a lot

82
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:05,000
But one of them, I think we had a good hour on the hideous statues throughout the park

83
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
And the one with the, well we could have guessed this

84
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
The one with the cow with a rockabilly hairdo and all these udders

85
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
It was like really unsettling

86
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Shoot at you and razz you

87
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
That found's name is Rock Cow Billy

88
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Oh wow

89
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
That is such a leap

90
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I feel like I time traveled to five months ago

91
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
We're just, we're in a temporal loop

92
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
That's a bigger leap than the roadies of the roadies stunt show

93
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Who do get very hurt in that YouTube video

94
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
The guy leaves, that's right, he stumbles away

95
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I have bare metal family on my phone

96
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
On occasion I will just play it

97
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Cause I'll rip it off of

98
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Yeah I don't know, I mean I'm not gonna play it now

99
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
We don't have to

100
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
We have to get through this

101
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
These sectors

102
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
We have to get through

103
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
The four of the most boring things

104
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
So this is only sector three

105
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Are you gonna release this third?

106
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Are you releasing the sectors in order?

107
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Yes, this is only three

108
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
So we're like bright and bushy tailed right now

109
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
We don't know where this is gonna go

110
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
We don't know how tired we'll get

111
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
This might be the start of kind of a decline

112
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Because you know sometimes we end up with guests and I say

113
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
So why'd you pick this topic?

114
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
And I feel like I know your answer on this one

115
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Which is that others were chosen

116
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
This I, yeah I didn't find out

117
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I didn't find out about this until too late

118
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
And I emailed you and you told me all the good ones had been taken

119
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Was there one you would have wanted given anything?

120
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Oh, no probably not, I don't know

121
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
What's been the best one?

122
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
What's been the most fruitful sector?

123
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
This is only the third

124
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
We don't know

125
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Right now it's mostly crepe

126
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
So far crepes and water coffins

127
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Do you have like if somebody were to have said like

128
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Said like a month or two ago

129
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Favorite city walk place

130
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Do you have one that comes to mind?

131
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I guess bubble gums but just like

132
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I don't know

133
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Yeah, I don't know

134
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
What's city walk? I've done the indoor skydiving

135
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I've been to Margaritaville a bunch lately

136
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Us too

137
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Congratulations

138
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I haven't gone to the Churrasqueria

139
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Have I gone there?

140
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
It is crazy

141
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I always forget that there was a full Brazilian steakhouse

142
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Oh, that's right, yeah

143
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Is there still a Bucat de Bepo there?

144
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Oh yeah, there sure is

145
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
We walked by there tonight

146
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:46,000
We did a full pass even though we didn't make you stay at your sector

147
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
No, we got to walk around a little bit

148
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
You took the full tour

149
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Anything you now

150
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
That you passed by that you wish was in your sector

151
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
No, I don't think so

152
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I wasn't coveting any sectors

153
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
When we were walking around

154
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I don't know, it's all city walk

155
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
This is inaccurate

156
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
This is what anyone's opinion of this would be

157
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
But you know, there's some fun stuff in this one

158
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I guess

159
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Do we just go in list order?

160
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Well, let's throw it to the sector keeper

161
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Oh, that's right

162
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
That's who will decide

163
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
We take you now to our friend the sector keeper

164
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Boys, today's sector is sector 3

165
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Universal Studio Store

166
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Ludo Bird

167
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Francesca's

168
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Sublime Gifts and Finds

169
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Good luck, boys

170
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Thank you

171
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Well, I guess we should do it in the order that he suggested

172
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Which is I think in backwards order of interest

173
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
So let's start with the most interesting one

174
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
The Universal Studio Store

175
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Which is the basic

176
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I think it's cool that there's something

177
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Like the world of Disney

178
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
At downtown Disney

179
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
There's a store that gives you some of the universal experience

180
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
And where you can go buy the merchandise

181
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Without having to

182
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
What's the marriage metaphor

183
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
And get the milk for free

184
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Without having to get the milk for free

185
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Uh huh

186
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I messed that up

187
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
So do you think a lot of people will just go there instead of the theme park?

188
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
So do you think a lot of people will just go there instead of the theme park?

189
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
So do you think a lot of people will just go there instead of the theme park?

190
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I definitely think that, yes

191
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I definitely think that, yes

192
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
And they go back to their hometowns

193
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
And they impress their friends

194
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
And this was just

195
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I stopped in a store for a second

196
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
While doing all the rides

197
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
And just hoping to death that the lie's going okay

198
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
And they don't look cheap

199
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
How many people that are tourists just go to City Walk?

200
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
That's like

201
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
That's the weirdest thing about that

202
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Studio store

203
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I know it's the downtown Disney as well

204
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Like they have the world of Disney store

205
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
But wouldn't you think every tourist

206
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Goes to the theme park, not just to City Walk?

207
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
The locals are probably

208
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Buying less merch

209
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
That would be a guess

210
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I would think the only people going up there just to buy

211
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Merch at the studio store

212
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Who are locals are like heading for the Harry Potter stuff

213
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Like if you got a kid

214
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Or a family member

215
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Or a nephew, something like that

216
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
And you know they're really into Harry Potter

217
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
You know, because half that store is Harry Potter stuff now

218
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
And that part looks pretty nice

219
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Yeah, they redid that

220
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
They redid this whole store not too long ago

221
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I will say, I don't think anyone

222
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Was buying anything while we were in there

223
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
And we were in there

224
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
It was a pretty busy time at City Walk

225
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
But I felt like no one was really

226
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I would say in all the stores we went in

227
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
The cashier was making long eye contact with me

228
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Because she didn't have anything to do

229
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
All the different cashiers were not very busy

230
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
This studio store is also like

231
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Spitting distance from

232
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
The studio store as you're exiting

233
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
The park, so if people are buying

234
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Like, that was a great day, I want to get a souvenir

235
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
They may have already done it

236
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Like, you know, 20 feet ago

237
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Yeah

238
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
But I mean obviously

239
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
It's there, we don't know

240
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
The analytics, there must be some analytics

241
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
That show that this is a good idea

242
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
That people buy things here

243
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Like giant donuts

244
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I was eyeing the giant donuts

245
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Big Simpsons looking donuts

246
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Baked fresh daily

247
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
That kind of looks fake

248
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Because they're so big

249
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Grotesque mutant donut

250
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
That has been like, I don't know

251
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Mutated at the power plant

252
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
But they bake them fresh

253
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
And then they just sit in a

254
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Shelf in a box in a room temperature

255
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
To be bought by no one

256
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Yeah, they are not

257
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I'm supposing that they are bought, they are not bought

258
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Yeah, and when you say bake them fresh

259
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Is that, do you think they probably make them there on site?

260
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Like a Disney type thing?

261
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
That's what the sign said, yeah

262
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
It says baked fresh daily

263
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
There's a full backstage like bakery and confectionary

264
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
To support the theme park

265
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I would think there has to be

266
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
And you dream of it each night

267
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I mean

268
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Lying at the end of the conveyor belt

269
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I guess I'm skeptical because Disney is so

270
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Transparent with their bakery

271
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
There are people you can watch as your

272
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Like candy cane is made or your fudge

273
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
And like with the universal

274
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
We don't get to see fudge being made

275
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Right? Am I wrong?

276
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Is there a live fudge

277
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Display at universal anywhere?

278
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I don't think being made

279
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
No

280
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Maybe if you're lucky you get to see it

281
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Being loaded into the case

282
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
You get to see a tray being loaded into the case

283
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
If you're lucky you get to see the fudge being loaded into the tray

284
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
A truck from Laverne, California

285
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Unloading crates of fudge

286
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
That's close enough for you

287
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I declared this to be the most interesting one

288
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Are we out already?

289
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
We're still getting our sea legs in this series

290
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Well here's an interesting thing

291
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
So the one end

292
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
The end furthest into city walk

293
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
That used to be

294
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
The things from another world

295
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Which we'll talk about in a much later sector

296
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
The comic store

297
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Used to be

298
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
A pretty normal

299
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
A pretty cramped comic store

300
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
And they

301
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Had a good amount

302
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Of comics in there

303
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
For such a tiny space

304
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
But then when universal was looking to expand

305
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
The studio store it was right next to it

306
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
So they cordially

307
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
They were like

308
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
We'll move you down to a different space

309
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
How did you know it was cordially

310
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I feel like that was what

311
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
There was a story about

312
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Or like we're moving

313
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
You know they seem excited

314
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
They seem excited about it

315
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Okay, but you're speculating on the cordialness

316
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
But the sign was like we're willingly moving

317
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Don't worry

318
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
We're moving down the block

319
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
No to our customers, we were not forced out

320
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
A very polite conversation happened

321
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
And we loved what's happening

322
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Not gunpoint

323
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Um

324
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
You know we caught you

325
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I feel like I heard there was something

326
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
We got you

327
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
It's fine, we're happy about it

328
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
We get more space

329
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
So there used to be no studio store there

330
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
There was a studio store but it would stop before

331
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
They expanded over

332
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
To the comic store area

333
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Is that what is now Harry Potter

334
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
No the other end

335
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
So we were looking at the world's best bod

336
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
And like world's greatest ad

337
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
That was like the comic store

338
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Okay, so that's all right

339
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Fake awards, a good amount of like

340
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Bart Simpson

341
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Drink receptacles

342
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
A bunch of minion heads

343
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Um

344
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
There's like slippers that you

345
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Potentially put your foot into Homer's mouth

346
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
That's nice

347
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
There's a wall

348
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
There's one

349
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
One high end section is about half

350
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Back to the future memorabilia

351
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Yes

352
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
There's a signed Mr. Fusion

353
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Signed by all of the cast

354
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
And the creatives

355
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Five grand, is that how much it was?

356
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Five thousand dollars?

357
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Above that is a signed

358
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Leah Thompson photo

359
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
With a little photo of her

360
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Nowadays

361
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Looking unhappy holding

362
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
The photo that you're buying

363
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
That little photo was in the

364
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Certificate of Authenticity

365
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I learned this at some point

366
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
In California if you want to sell

367
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Something that's autographed you have to have

368
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Some sort of certificate of authenticity

369
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
But what

370
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Any criteria for a certificate

371
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Because can that just be forged

372
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Just as easily as anything else?

373
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I guess so, I feel like there's some sort of way

374
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
You have to go about it

375
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Is taking a photo of the person with the autograph

376
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Like the poor man's certificate of authenticity

377
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
You know like poor man's copyright

378
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Where you have to like mail it to yourself

379
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Just like just take a picture of the person with it

380
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
And they're giving it a thumbs up

381
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Any piece of memorabilia as long as you have a photo of

382
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Leah Thompson holding it with a scowl

383
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Was that a cry for help?

384
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Was that like when like kidnappers

385
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Make someone take a picture holding

386
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
That day's news

387
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
She was holding the hill valley

388
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Leah Thompson trying to send us a message

389
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Yeah she's been kidnapped

390
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
She's in the back area

391
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
At Universal that they

392
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
The sign just says fudgery on it

393
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
But there is no fudge being made back there

394
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Just a table and a trapped

395
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Leah Thompson

396
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Let's get her out, save Leah

397
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Well there's a head of that transformer

398
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
That you told me about

399
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Well there's a bumblebee head

400
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
But I was more interested in the

401
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Character specific to the ride, Evac

402
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Which is the evacuation vehicle

403
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
That everyone is in that's trying to get out

404
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
And he's trying to avoid all of the

405
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Evil Decepticons

406
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
You're in Evac

407
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
So I was telling you guys that you're in

408
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Evac and I guess for some reason

409
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Nobody knew what I was talking about

410
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Because you're in a blue car

411
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
You're not in Evac

412
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
No that's it

413
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Are you in his back?

414
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Or you're in his car body?

415
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
His head is above your head

416
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Well it's kind of in the engine right?

417
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Wherever the heads go

418
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
There's no head, you're in a blue car

419
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
But it's in the front

420
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
You do hear his voice a lot

421
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I never even

422
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Thought we were in that guy though

423
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Well you hear a lot of voices

424
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
In the ride so it could be

425
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Right I didn't know we were part of a guy

426
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
You hear an open roof

427
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
But then at the end

428
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Remember at the end, this belongs of course

429
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
In a full length Transformer episode

430
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
At the end when you decide

431
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
That no we're going to be the heroes

432
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
We're not going to just, he says I'm sick of running

433
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Right? Is that something like that?

434
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
And he punches the All Spark

435
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I'm not running anymore and then we kind of

436
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Go closer to whatever the evil

437
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Guy's name is

438
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Megatron, thank you

439
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Do you remember this part, the fist comes out of

440
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
The EVAC vehicle and he gets a

441
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Real solid punch

442
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
On the screen or like physical? On the screen

443
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Yeah so like your car runs up to him

444
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
But then the car sprouts an arm

445
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
And it just shoves this arm into the

446
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Chest with the All Spark in it

447
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Oh yes yeah yeah yeah

448
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
So that's EVAC's arm, so that's the head

449
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
You never get to see EVAC fully

450
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
So no one's, you think a single person's bought that head?

451
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
No I don't

452
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I don't think anyone's bought EVAC's head

453
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I just liked seeing it there

454
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Do you think they have a way to ring it up if you want to buy it?

455
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Yeah I'll take the EVAC

456
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Oh I don't even know, we lent

457
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Our ladder, we lent our

458
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Step ladder to the other store

459
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I don't even know how to get it

460
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Does anyone, who has the keys?

461
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I feel like we never got that key

462
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
This is unshatterable glass also

463
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
There's no way back there, there's nothing we can do

464
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I don't want the audience to send me

465
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Gifts, but

466
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I would happily accept EVAC's

467
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Giant head

468
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I would be so happy

469
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Inconvenient amount of money

470
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Someone is just going to send you

471
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
A head

472
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Is this what you meant?

473
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
This is

474
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
When I was, I was up there

475
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
A while back when this was, when we were beginning

476
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
This series

477
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Not realizing we would all be touring it together

478
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I wanted to make sure I covered the studio

479
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Store, if I didn't get the chance later

480
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
And I was in that little

481
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
It's this little hallway

482
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
And one side is a mirror and the other side is this display case

483
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
With the nice stuff, like the head of EVAC

484
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
And there was a big ET there

485
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
And I was just standing there taking pictures

486
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
And then this group of guys came up

487
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Which my natural inclination is

488
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Oh no, young people

489
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
They're going to bother me, they're probably

490
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
They found something to pick on me for already

491
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Instead, these guys started roasting

492
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Everything in the case, and it was

493
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
A delight, watching them do it

494
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
They were saying, you know

495
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
One of them said to the other

496
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Where they pointed at ET and said, that's what you look like naked

497
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
And then they

498
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Started talking to me

499
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
And they asked me

500
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
They just pointed at ET and EVAC

501
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Without naming either of them

502
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
And they said, who would you be more

503
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Upset if you went on a Tinder date

504
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
And it ended up being one of them

505
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Who would you be more upset about

506
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
And I said

507
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I'd be more upset about EVAC

508
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Because he's big

509
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
And his dick might be

510
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Like an exhaust pipe or something

511
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
And he might crush me or blow steam at me

512
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
And they instead

513
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
And they said

514
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
You'd be mad if you got catfished by

515
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
This guy

516
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
And then they'd veered away from me

517
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Because one of the guys thought

518
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Of a joke, he pointed at the Mr. Fusion

519
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
And he said, what's that, a new slap chop?

520
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
And

521
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Teens are so good

522
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
At roasting

523
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
And that was so

524
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Funny that all three of them

525
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Went running around the store

526
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Sprinting around the store

527
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Saying, oh shit, oh shit

528
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Watching these guys

529
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
They were having such a blast

530
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
It was three guys ripping on theme park stuff

531
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
It was like this alternate

532
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Universe version of us who, I don't know

533
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I'm sorry to say, might have been funnier

534
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
They were

535
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
For sure funnier

536
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I thought about what's that, a new slap chop

537
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Done since then

538
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
So whoever you guys were

539
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
You gave me a lot of laughs

540
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
And thanks for not being mean to me

541
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Like I still assume anyone younger

542
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Than me is going to be

543
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
That's a really nice story

544
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Yeah, yeah

545
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
So good memories

546
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
There, I was to any good awards

547
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Anyone noticed, there's those weird

548
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Off-brand Oscars

549
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I took a picture of, let me see

550
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Oh, I just took a picture of one

551
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
That's, you know, it's like, it's best mom

552
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
And best dad, best girlfriend

553
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
And best body, that was funny

554
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Best dog sitter

555
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Was one of them

556
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
But then very miserably

557
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
On the bottom shelf

558
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Bottom is best me

559
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
So you, the person who goes to

560
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Universal

561
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Doesn't want to pay the price to get into the store

562
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Or get into the theme park rather

563
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Just goes to the store

564
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
And then wants something to remember

565
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Is non-tripped Universal

566
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Buys himself

567
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
A best me, looks in the mirror

568
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
This, this, I mean

569
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Universal in general

570
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Kind of has to

571
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Because it's like, Hollywood

572
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Baby, you know, California

573
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Los Angeles, like

574
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
When you're in Orlando

575
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
In Universal or Disney, there's not a lot of racks of like

576
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Orlando!

577
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Crap, you know

578
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Because people are coming from all over the

579
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
World, all over America

580
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
And, you know, they want to

581
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
They inevitably will buy

582
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Some, like, Los Angeles

583
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Postcards, or Hollywood postcards

584
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
So they keep a lot more of that, I feel like

585
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Than other parks

586
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Yeah, but the thing that I really love in any of these

587
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Hollywood sections, and this is true of

588
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
The Studio Store, it's true in Hollywood Boulevard, it's true of

589
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Any movie theme park

590
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
The off-brand Oscars

591
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Is a really fun thing, because the Oscars

592
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Are really specific about their

593
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Their golden man holding

594
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
The sword, and the way that, the exact way

595
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
That's framed, so the off-brand

596
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Ones where it's like, well he's holding his arms

597
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
The other way, and he's holding

598
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
A big star, or

599
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Like, or a film reel

600
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Or, like

601
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Or, you know, or his chest

602
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Is like two tattoos of cameras

603
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Or, like

604
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Yes, we wouldn't want to dishonor

605
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
The dignity of the Oscars

606
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
The Academy Awards

607
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
But I, maybe that's a business to get into

608
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Is designing

609
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Rearranged

610
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Oscar statues

611
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
What if it's just like a tiny evac painted gold

612
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
That's the ultimate gift

613
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
That's for Universal, that should be, that's what they really should do for

614
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Universal, they should have their characters in gold

615
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
With these different things, so like

616
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
ET in gold, and it would say

617
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Best friend

618
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Or something

619
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Or like Ricky Ricardo

620
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Best band leader

621
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Norman Bates

622
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Everyone's favorite Universal Studios

623
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Character

624
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Best clerk

625
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Best hotel operator

626
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Cindy Lou

627
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Least crazy guy

628
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Like a golden

629
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Like a golden, like buff man

630
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
But then just the head is Woody

631
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Woodpecker's head

632
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
And he's best mischief maker

633
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Fallon

634
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Best host

635
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
The people who pretend to be from New York

636
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Who yell at you on the street when you walk by

637
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Best

638
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Best working class couple

639
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
I walked by that

640
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Today, because I went in there for a few minutes

641
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
And like no one

642
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Maybe you guys have covered this already, no one pays

643
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Attention to them

644
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
And like it looks like they might just

645
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Live there, and the deal is they have to

646
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Be mic'd

647
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
And like just sit at the window

648
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
They weren't even like doing New York accents

649
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Anymore, I thought

650
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
They were real New York, you know, point, anyway

651
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
When we were

652
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
When we were there, weren't they doing a bit with Beetlejuice?

653
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Yeah, I think they were yelling at Beetlejuice

654
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
And they were like, hey Beetlejuice, what are you doing?

655
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
And then like he'd have

656
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Be like, ah, I'm just on the street here, and then the woman

657
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Would be like, no, I won't

658
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
I won't go out on a date with you, Beetlejuice

659
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
And then he's like, ah, come on

660
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Come on, and they're doing a bit, and then you're saying

661
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
No one's paying attention. I saw people taking pictures

662
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
With a Beetlejuice today, who

663
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Knows who Beetlejuice is anymore

664
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
He's like

665
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
One of the top five of universal characters

666
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
What do people think he is?

667
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Like, a weird guy?

668
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Just a ghost, a crazy clown

669
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
The walker-lion

670
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
He's it, they think he's it

671
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
That is like, do you think

672
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
People know Lucy better?

673
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Because there's still a Lucy walk-around character

674
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Lucy versus Beetlejuice? Still on TV

675
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Yeah, that's true

676
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Beetlejuice, you gotta be a cinephile to know about

677
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
That's a good point

678
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Some random kid

679
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
There's a rumor about a new Beetlejuice movie every year though

680
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
That's one of those

681
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
The AV Club, I think if you

682
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Added up all the AV Club articles over the years

683
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
15% of them are about a

684
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Beetlejuice reboot that I'll never have

685
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
We're Bill and Ted 3

686
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
10% are about Bill and Ted 3

687
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Big wave

688
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
25% is every time

689
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Arrested Development might come back

690
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
These

691
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Stories power the blogosphere

692
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
It's what it's all

693
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Hanging off of

694
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
It's important

695
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Best blogger

696
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
That's good

697
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Best pod mass

698
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Assembler

699
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Best

700
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
We should be nice to them, shouldn't we?

701
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
They haven't written about the show yet

702
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Write about the show, cowards

703
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
If you want your gold instead

704
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
If you don't want a best coward statue

705
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
include us in pod mass

706
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
That'll do it

707
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Best coward

708
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
That's the most restraint I've exercised

709
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Doing the social media for the show

710
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
is not just tweeting after a few months

711
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
at AV Club

712
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Go, cowards

713
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Hey Vulture

714
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Split sire, Vulture comedy

715
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Whatever you're calling yourself, you're in the clear

716
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
You've mentioned us a few times

717
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
We want that 50 listener

718
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
boost

719
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
You all give us

720
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
The best boost

721
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
That's enough of that, let's move on to

722
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Luda Bird

723
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
A restaurant that you

724
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
guys both ate at

725
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
and I had in the past

726
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
What did you think?

727
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Let's talk about the experience of it

728
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Because we were at the

729
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
counter for what felt like

730
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
25 minutes waiting for

731
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
someone to come

732
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
We were there right at dinner time, right as the parks

733
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
like, gliding out for the day

734
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
The kid who was working there, and I say kid because

735
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
he was a child

736
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
He seemed like he was 16

737
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
There was fear in his eyes

738
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Did you notice this?

739
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
I felt so bad for him

740
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
because he was running and doing 10 different jobs

741
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
I think he had braces

742
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
I think there was a whole thing going on

743
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
There was also 3 people back in the kitchen

744
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
I don't know what they were doing

745
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
And he was working so hard

746
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
So it's not his fault, it's the management

747
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
at Ludo Bird

748
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
or whatever the hell it's called

749
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
So you blame Ludo

750
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Put the fryer, put down

751
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
the serving plate at

752
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Petit Choua

753
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Choua Mac

754
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Papa Monti Universal, full of chefs

755
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
He's spending most of his time at City Walk

756
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Right?

757
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
He's gotta keep an eye on that one

758
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Not making TV shows, which they were playing clips of

759
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
The many Netflix shows

760
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
he's made guest appearances on

761
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Who is it? Who's the guy?

762
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
It's this very famous foodie chef

763
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Ludo

764
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
who has some

765
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
really good restaurants in LA

766
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
but also had this truck serving this

767
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
chicken and then made it into

768
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
a few franchise-y places

769
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
that are pretty mediocre

770
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
not great

771
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
not something you would say

772
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
like, oh, you have

773
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
I remember someone telling me about

774
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
the chicken truck years ago

775
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Oh yeah, it's the best fried chicken

776
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
You would never say that about

777
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Ludo Bird and City Walk

778
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
It might be one of the best

779
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
quick service

780
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
options

781
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
up at City Walk

782
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
I think in terms of chicken

783
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
I would hunt out in LA, it's been laughed by

784
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Dave's and

785
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Hell and Rays, the hot chicken places

786
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
If we're gonna talk about hot chicken, let's get going on it

787
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
because we have had hot chicken fever for over a year now

788
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
The wait here

789
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
wasn't quite as long as a Hell and Rays

790
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
but it

791
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
was different because there was no one online

792
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
The excitement level was a little bit lower

793
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
There's no music playing

794
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
There's no fun employees

795
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
They do the fun

796
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
weight part

797
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
to build the anticipation

798
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
That also happened when I went to

799
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Menchies, which I know is a different

800
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
sector, but I went to Menchies

801
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Don't anger the sector, Keech and Jason

802
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
I'm just saying

803
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
I finished making my little thing

804
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
and I realized

805
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
is there a cashier

806
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
in this establishment?

807
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Oh yeah, I never saw one

808
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
They turned out to be standing right next

809
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
to me, and that was why, but they weren't

810
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
behind the counter, I think they were cleaning up

811
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
You thought about running out with it

812
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
I mean, I was also thinking about

813
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
just doing a free sample

814
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
down the line, but it was a little crowded

815
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
You did the sample

816
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
and then you did the main

817
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
I did the sample and I liked what I had, so I just got it

818
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Black cherry

819
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Tart, black cherry, very good

820
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Simple one flavor?

821
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
No idea, twist with original Tart

822
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
and then I put a lot of chocolate and peanut butter stuff on it

823
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Best?

824
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
We're not allowed to talk about this though

825
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Saludo

826
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
You guys both had sandwiches

827
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
How were your sandwiches? I had a spicy chicken sandwich

828
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
The ingredients

829
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
were good tasting, like the sauce

830
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
is good, and there's like a pickled

831
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
onion and stuff, the chicken was definitely

832
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
very cold

833
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
and I think it had been

834
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
sitting around a while because they had

835
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
told you that they didn't have

836
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Well yeah, so I ordered a grilled chicken

837
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
and I gave him my credit card

838
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
He said I'll be right back

839
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
and he disappeared for five minutes

840
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
and I forgot that I had a

841
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
sign or anything, so I was just like I'll let him go

842
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
whatever, and then he very quietly

843
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
and she officially came up to the table and was like

844
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Oh I need you to sign this, could you please sign this?

845
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
And I was like, oh yeah, sure

846
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
of course, and then I'm sorry, I forgot, no that's okay

847
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
So then he took the thing back

848
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
and then he quietly came up as if

849
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
he was a director giving me a note

850
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
or something, like he didn't want to embarrass me in front of

851
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
him, we were out of the grilled chicken sandwich

852
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
would

853
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
something else be okay? And I was like yeah

854
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
and give me anything, spicy

855
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
chicken, and I was like sure, yeah okay

856
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
And then he basically had it in his hand

857
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
and then he just handed it to me

858
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
and yes, it was like

859
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
again, the ingredients were good, but it was

860
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
pretty cold

861
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
the chicken itself was pretty cold, which I've

862
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
eaten at Ludo before and

863
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
this was by far the coldest

864
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
I've had at Ludo

865
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
It was definitely cold

866
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
And again, not this kid's fault

867
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
No, no, no

868
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Ludo's cold chicken

869
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Ludo's coldest chicken

870
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
You're tired of the odd chicken, Chris

871
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
We had a honey, we had a honey drenched

872
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Which was good

873
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
We went here after

874
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
the, we did it out of order

875
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
sorry sector keeper, but I

876
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
got it, we got it after the

877
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
water coffins and

878
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
that made me

879
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
sick, this wasn't good

880
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Yeah, this isn't a good

881
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
restaurant, or whatever is going on

882
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
they need, it's

883
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
I feel like a lot of restaurants are kind of like

884
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
sort of, what's

885
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
the, not, like bait and run

886
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
that's probably not it, but like they're

887
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
started, there's a grand opening, the guy

888
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
checks everything, alright, it looks

889
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
perfect, and he never comes

890
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
again, it's just stressed out teenagers

891
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
you never get it right, and it's not

892
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
their fault, because they aren't equipped to do so

893
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
like once you're past the opening

894
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
ceremony, it places like City Walk, nobody

895
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
ever checks in again, that's I think City Walk

896
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
you can franchise yourself out

897
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
and if it's

898
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
bad, it doesn't matter

899
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
it, you know

900
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
it's like making a TV show now, no one

901
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
sees it, it just goes

902
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
out into the ether

903
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
and you never hear about it again, who knows

904
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
how would I even look that up

905
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
no way to tell anymore

906
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
look, this is a thousand factors

907
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
that's what the teenager

908
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
would tell me about the chicken

909
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
no, this used to be

910
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Jody Moroni Sausage Kingdom

911
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
one of the finest names

912
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
of an establishment I have

913
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
ever heard, I think I ate there once

914
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
or twice, and founded a very serviceable

915
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
sausage establishment

916
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
I liked it

917
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
I've never actually, I never had the pleasure

918
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
of eating at Jody Moroni's

919
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
I've never traveled to the kingdom

920
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
you

921
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
well, you know, you served at the pleasure

922
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
of the king

923
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
King Moroni

924
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
did you have to say my liege after you ordered my liege

925
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
it's a very cordial

926
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
pot tucker

927
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
my napkin

928
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
my napkin and my plastic

929
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
fork and my tray

930
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
to serve

931
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Jody Moroni

932
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
there's a kind of a trend

933
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
and Jody Moroni's was part of this

934
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
I think, because this was originally

935
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
just a single restaurant

936
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
in Venice Beach, it was a Venice Beach favorite

937
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
in City Walk I think some of the idea of it

938
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
was to kind of

939
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
borrow or co-opt

940
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
you might say, LA

941
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
favorites, I think there's been a history

942
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
of that, things that maybe there's, there has not

943
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
been a second location of and they do

944
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
now it's become a place that co-ops

945
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Portland favorites

946
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
with, I mean

947
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Buddha Donuts is an example of that, many monster

948
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
but they did it with, there was a Tommy's

949
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
I forget if there still is one, Pink's

950
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Gladstones, which got

951
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
replaced by Bubba Gumps, but yeah

952
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
it's kind of this like, City Walk's

953
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
like the man

954
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
like snatching up

955
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
indie bands and signing them

956
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
but then not letting them do their thing

957
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
yeah, stifling their creativity

958
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
yeah, the sausage king

959
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
the real sausage kingdom

960
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
was, they've been crazy hot dog ideas

961
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
everyone

962
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
not everyone ate there

963
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
but everyone who did started a band

964
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
started a sausage

965
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
a sausage king restaurant

966
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
so, yeah alright, that's not

967
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
good either, let's keep going

968
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Francesca

969
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
come on, center three, I have literally

970
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
not a note about Francesca's

971
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
which one was?

972
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Francesca's the one we went in first or second

973
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
it's really just like clothing

974
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
and it's like a little bit of

975
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
kind of, gifty nonsense

976
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
you see, Francesca started back in 1999

977
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
when we opened our first

978
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
boutique in Houston, Texas

979
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
and filled it with a winsome collection

980
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
of hand picked merchandise

981
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
women everywhere instantly fell

982
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
in love with us, so that we now

983
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
have over 700

984
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
boutiques in 48 states

985
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
across the country

986
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
and counting, and then we also

987
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
launched our online boutique

988
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
francescas.com, so you can shop

989
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
serve or play, whatever it strikes

990
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
your fancy, that's right from the Francesca's

991
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
website

992
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
did they become a sponsor?

993
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
did you, something I didn't read

994
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
it enough, it's something, it was maybe

995
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Asian owned

996
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
it's just like an importer company

997
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
that does cute stuff

998
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
I mean, I know they have

999
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
carefully curated clothing

1000
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
bright baubles, bold accessories, and playful

1001
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
gifts, well you don't know that, you're just

1002
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
no, he's doing it, he's doing it

1003
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
all off the top of his head

1004
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
he's not reading that

1005
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
I mean, it was

1006
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
a lot of knickknacks, it was a lot

1007
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
of knickknacks, and one side

1008
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
of clothing, I don't want to get ahead of

1009
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
ourselves, but I spotted

1010
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
some bath treats that were very

1011
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
similar to the nectar bath

1012
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
treats that will be coming up in a future sector

1013
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
they were, you know, they were

1014
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
like food shaped bath treats

1015
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
bath bombs and soaps

1016
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
and was not, not the first

1017
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
appearance in this sector

1018
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
of food based

1019
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
treats, because that comes up in sublime

1020
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
gifts as well, there was a lot of

1021
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
oh sorry, oh no no no, go for it

1022
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
I was just saying, there is a crossover with this and

1023
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
sublime gifts of a lot of

1024
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
stuff like a glass of

1025
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
wine that says binge watching and

1026
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
boozing are my favorite

1027
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
stuff like that, or for a man

1028
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
a beer cozy that says

1029
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
this guy needs a beer

1030
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
and then there is a little purse

1031
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
that I, I don't know if it's

1032
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
for an avocado

1033
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
that you put in like a little purse

1034
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
but it says time for avacardio

1035
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
which I don't, is that

1036
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
that means eating an avocado?

1037
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Like instead of

1038
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
exercising, like the mouth workout you get from

1039
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
eating an avocado, which is not like a

1040
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
not strenuous, not strenuous and also

1041
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
not like a crazy snack

1042
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
indulgence, you'd be like

1043
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
time for my cake sur-size or something

1044
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
that would make more sense

1045
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
and then one that we found that just a little

1046
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
shot glass with a picture

1047
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
of a cactus that says

1048
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
feeling fan cactus

1049
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
is one of the worst

1050
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
versions of those kind of things

1051
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
I found, I bought

1052
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
an item from the store

1053
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
which I don't need to unwrap on the air

1054
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
because I know what it is, but I'd like to

1055
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
see it again. The audience wants to feel though

1056
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
you unwrapping. Yeah yeah, listen to that

1057
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
binaural, binaural presentation

1058
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
if you wouldn't mind. Yeah, do you feel like you're in great

1059
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
moments with Mr. Lincoln?

1060
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
So I bought a shot glass

1061
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
that says, that has

1062
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
a bird on it and it says

1063
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
McCaw me maybe

1064
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
and that's something I

1065
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
oh now, I like it

1066
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
I'm a Carly Rae Jepson fan

1067
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
so I'm excited to have this

1068
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
and the back of, wait I

1069
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
oh yeah, on my patio I have a

1070
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
sign that I bought in San Diego

1071
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
that's something about like

1072
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
two cans for the price

1073
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
of one, I forget. So this

1074
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
will go along with that, I'll drink

1075
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
I'll stare at that two can

1076
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
sign while I drink from this McCaw

1077
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
shot glass and

1078
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
I'll be very satisfied with my life

1079
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Lot of

1080
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
crossover too in both stores

1081
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
lot of unicorn

1082
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
stuff. What have you declared the

1083
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
year of the unicorn? Is that

1084
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
There was a unicorn display at Ralph's

1085
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
over here in Burbank, like the unicorn

1086
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
everyone is doing it

1087
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Really? Yeah, I don't know why but it is

1088
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Starbucks is going on drinks

1089
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
You know I like those drinks though

1090
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
I haven't had one yet but it's

1091
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
But you will, you know you will

1092
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Blue and purple. What do they call it?

1093
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Unicorn tears? Unicorn frappe or something

1094
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Unicorn tears

1095
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Or am I thinking of liberal

1096
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
tears? You might be thinking of the new

1097
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Pixar Pier Bing Bong's candy shop because

1098
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
you can eat Bing Bong's tears

1099
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
What do they look like?

1100
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
It's not open yet

1101
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
But they are hyping the tears

1102
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
The candy tears

1103
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
I found a book in this

1104
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
store called Book of Questions

1105
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
And it says, I don't know if you guys

1106
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
saw this, it says spark fun conversations

1107
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
and get to know friends and family

1108
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
better. So there are

1109
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
maybe ten

1110
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
pages in this book

1111
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
And on each page there

1112
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
is one question

1113
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
And I will just read a couple of them

1114
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
What's the best compliment you've ever been given?

1115
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
I will read

1116
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
a second one

1117
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
What would your answer be for that one?

1118
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
You know what? Good point. Let's all do this

1119
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Oh shit

1120
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Let's all do the Book of Questions. Jason, thank you so much for that suggestion

1121
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
I think that

1122
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
I think that podcast arrived

1123
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
We could get to know each other even better

1124
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
And Book of Questions

1125
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
So Jason Sheridan, I would like you

1126
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
to go first. What's the best compliment

1127
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
you've ever been given?

1128
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
I don't know

1129
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
You know what? I'll say this. Anytime

1130
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
someone says

1131
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
that I was funny

1132
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
or I did something funny, it

1133
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
always means a lot

1134
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
That's nice. Scott, what do you think?

1135
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
You don't have to be funny. We can just say

1136
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
serious things

1137
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
This isn't the best one

1138
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
ever, but it was

1139
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
a big honor when I

1140
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
performed at my high school

1141
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
talent show and I won

1142
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
the category of best miscellaneous

1143
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
I consider that an award

1144
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
compliment

1145
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
I sang Kiss from a Rose

1146
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
and it was

1147
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
a lot of fun and I'm glad

1148
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
to have been recognized but kept separate

1149
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
from the rest of the singers

1150
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Jason?

1151
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
I have nothing

1152
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
I have blacked out any

1153
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
compliment I've received in my life

1154
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Hey, nice

1155
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Lacoste shoes

1156
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
That's the nicest thing anyone's ever said to me

1157
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Sweet! That's my best compliment

1158
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
What about when someone

1159
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
told you great imposter

1160
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
syndrome?

1161
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Mike? I'm trying to think

1162
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
and also could I

1163
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
keep our compliments more at the front of

1164
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
our brains? It'll help us get through

1165
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
the times that we're getting very few

1166
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
compliments or three star

1167
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
reviews. Don't you feel disgusting if someone

1168
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
compliments you?

1169
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
It's so shameful

1170
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Yeah

1171
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
You gotta land somewhere between

1172
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
You can't like swat it down

1173
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
hard because that

1174
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
embarrasses the other person. There's no gracious way

1175
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
to take a compliment

1176
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
It's cruel to compliment someone

1177
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
You think so?

1178
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
If you're like

1179
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
oh thanks it was nothing

1180
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
then you hear yourself being

1181
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
falsely humble. Even if you're not being

1182
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
false about it, it's like

1183
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
I sound like I'm being falsely

1184
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
modest

1185
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
You don't want to acknowledge if someone

1186
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
said what you just did was very funny or

1187
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
very good, you're like hell yeah it is

1188
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
but you don't want to do that because that seems like you're crazy

1189
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
but also if you were doing something

1190
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
that you put together or you did a performance

1191
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
you thought it was good or you wouldn't have done it

1192
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
but you have to meet it in the middle

1193
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
you have two conflicting things at once that are happening in your brain

1194
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Yeah and I've done the thing

1195
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
where if someone compliments a thing

1196
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
that you don't really

1197
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
think is good that you were involved with

1198
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
then yeah to say that to them is like

1199
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
to be like you're an idiot. Why would you like that?

1200
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
You're like oh yeah

1201
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
that wasn't very good, yeah that didn't come out very good

1202
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
but thanks. I had a lot of problems

1203
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
It makes me happy if somebody compliments

1204
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
something I did that I know that I had

1205
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
trouble with at any point

1206
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
and I think I like to tell people that

1207
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
I'm like oh good I'm glad it worked out

1208
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Yes I do that too because there was this moment

1209
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
where it was not good and I'd know what it

1210
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
could have been. But don't you still think they're lying?

1211
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
They're the person giving the call?

1212
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
I'm suspicious but I don't always

1213
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
think for sure. That's nice

1214
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
You know what the line

1215
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
this is the exact line for

1216
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
me about anything I've made or an episode

1217
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
of the podcast. If anyone

1218
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
can name one specific

1219
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
from the thing

1220
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
I know that they watched it and they thought

1221
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
oh you know what I should say is that I liked that

1222
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
if they just say they liked the thing I think they're

1223
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
then they're lying. Yeah that's true

1224
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
or the thing

1225
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
they did like it but it sort of

1226
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
failed on some level because nothing

1227
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
actually broke through. But if

1228
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
I get a compliment on a line

1229
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
a dialogue in something

1230
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
that's a good hack moving forward

1231
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
when you're complimenting someone next

1232
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
I'm gonna do it right now to Jason

1233
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Milder because I just

1234
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
a few days ago for the first

1235
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
time watched All That Jazz and

1236
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
I had a much bigger appreciation of the

1237
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
finale of Eagle Heart of the

1238
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
last season of Eagle Heart

1239
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
having watched that. That's the nicest

1240
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
compliment I've ever gotten. Thank you

1241
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
even not that you appreciated

1242
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
that you remember

1243
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
it and acknowledge that

1244
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
it was a thing that existed. I thought it was very funny

1245
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
at the time and I kind of

1246
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
had a vague notion I was like

1247
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
oh I know All That Jazz

1248
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
like I know this ID

1249
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
but I didn't really remember it that well but sitting

1250
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
down and watching the movie from start to finish

1251
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
I was like oh now I like. It's such a good movie

1252
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
no that's true anytime like anytime I have

1253
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
something like that like I yeah I'm

1254
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
proud of that and if someone

1255
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
liked it I feel close to them

1256
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
and want to talk to them for longer than

1257
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
they probably want to talk to me.

1258
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Oh so it opens floodgates. Yeah

1259
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
yeah yeah. No that's very nice Jason.

1260
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
It was interesting to watch a legitimate

1261
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
compliment exchange happen and see how you

1262
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
responded to it and I think you did

1263
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
well with the compliment. You know what it was actually moving to me

1264
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
so I take back everything

1265
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
I said before I don't think you're an

1266
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
idiot for liking something that I did.

1267
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Oh god it's great.

1268
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
It's also just balancing out my karma for

1269
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
drunkenly accosting

1270
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
you at a party nine years

1271
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
ago or something when I first moved to LA. Wait when?

1272
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Which party? Was that a Funny or Die party?

1273
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Yeah. Were we together and you were like

1274
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
I want to know how much I'm judging so long there.

1275
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Jason told me he was going to go

1276
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
attack you. Did we know each other already?

1277
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
No I mean I had only been in

1278
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
the city like a year and a half. Can I remember

1279
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
that? You were perfect

1280
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
nice. No it was a lovely conversation. We

1281
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
mostly talked about the best show. Oh

1282
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
okay yeah. I remember that

1283
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
that's crazy. I wasn't

1284
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
I didn't see that conversation. Wait which party was it?

1285
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
It was that Funny or Die party at that

1286
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
what's that Sinus face

1287
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
that got off of.

1288
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
They must

1289
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
have broken fire codes.

1290
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Oh my god. There was far too many people.

1291
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
That was yeah.

1292
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
Stressful. But you had a nice moment

1293
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
within what is sort of a crazy

1294
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
stressful party. I

1295
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
took these pictures of this stupid book

1296
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
thinking oh we're just going to

1297
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
goof on this book. This

1298
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
stupid fucking book. We're going to

1299
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
oh four guys are just going to rip it up

1300
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
laugh it up at this stupid

1301
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
shit.

1302
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
This is what we're working in the entertainment

1303
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
industry does. It just destroys your mind.

1304
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
You're like fucking compliments.

1305
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
The nicest moment that's

1306
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
ever been on the podcast. It is because I was walking

1307
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
through all these stores like

1308
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
both being and trying not to be like

1309
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
alright what's my take to make fun

1310
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
of in these fucking places. It's like

1311
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
wait what are we doing? No that's like

1312
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
genuinely nice. This book is good.

1313
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
You should have bought the book.

1314
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
It's $60.

1315
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Now let's talk about what do you meme

1316
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
an adult party game for meme lovers.

1317
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
That was also on sale

1318
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
in this store.

1319
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Which is the exact thing funnier die did. Like

1320
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
making captions for meme photos

1321
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
they did funnier die the game

1322
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
and you could buy that at Target.

1323
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Well honestly the worst thing about memes is that you cannot

1324
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
hold them on cards in your hand

1325
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
at a party with your

1326
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
adult friends and talk about how much

1327
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
you love memes. Do you guys do

1328
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
board games with

1329
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
people? I have a lot of trouble with

1330
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
that. Mike has looked over at

1331
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
me because he knows I despise them.

1332
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Okay.

1333
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
I like

1334
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Trivial Pursuit.

1335
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
I like that. I like Trivia games.

1336
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
I like that or I like the version

1337
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
of Celebrity where like you write names

1338
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
down and toss them in a hat.

1339
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
But then usually that it's like

1340
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
alright now round two you can only say

1341
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
three words and then round three you have

1342
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
to act out the celebrity. You like get

1343
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
very like worked up when

1344
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
people suggest a game too. Like you get

1345
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
like stressed out ahead of time. Like it feels like

1346
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
you had bad game experiences as

1347
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
you. I know my family would play them and

1348
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
we all had a nice time. So what's the problem?

1349
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
I think I like

1350
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
talking more.

1351
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
I think I just force myself

1352
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
to become a talker at some

1353
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
point. So you're with people

1354
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
you like. You want to have a free

1355
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
really good position. You don't want to be put in a box.

1356
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
That's exactly it. Sure. Yeah.

1357
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
I think I feel that bummer at

1358
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
things where like okay now let's get down

1359
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
to the task at hand.

1360
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
But there doesn't have to be a task at hand.

1361
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Let's just hang.

1362
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
I'm honestly more okay with them like

1363
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
one of those board game cafes

1364
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
because you kind of know that's what you're

1365
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
going for and that's what you're getting in. Those

1366
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
feel weird to me.

1367
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
I've only been like

1368
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
once or twice. That's too much of a show.

1369
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
It's a lot. Let's go in public and

1370
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
do this. Seems weird to me. But at

1371
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
least then you know the context you're walking

1372
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
into. I see. I understand what you're saying. Yeah. Maybe you should try

1373
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
playing the $400 Harry Potter

1374
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
chess set that they have at the Universal

1375
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Studio store that we were at tonight.

1376
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
You might turn your right.

1377
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
It was in a cage too.

1378
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Oh I didn't see that. Was it

1379
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
the characters or was it? It's

1380
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
like very ornate looking.

1381
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
It was in a cage. I thought a woman

1382
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
guarding it but I think she was also selling wands.

1383
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
There's one woman's job which is to

1384
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
guard this Harry Potter chess set.

1385
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
It's not even that expensive. No.

1386
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
It's less than the

1387
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
Leah Thompson head or whatever you

1388
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
call it. It was not a Leah Thompson head.

1389
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
It was a picture. I don't remember.

1390
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
So when the Transformers ride you're in Leah Thompson.

1391
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
That's what you're driving

1392
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
around. And then in Back to the

1393
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Future, the old Back to the Future ride,

1394
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
you would constantly be looking at

1395
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
a picture of Evac that would be

1396
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
dissolving. Disappearing. Yeah. Disappearing.

1397
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
George McFly is spying on Evac while

1398
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
changing clothes in

1399
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
his window. In ten

1400
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
years when Back to the Future has been

1401
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
remade and there are still ten more

1402
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Transformer movies and they cross over

1403
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
because entertainment is a full

1404
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
wasteland that will probably

1405
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
happen. I mean, but that's going to be great

1406
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
because Logan Paul's going to be Marty

1407
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
and Jake Paul's going to be his

1408
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
young father.

1409
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Are these, is this, are

1410
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
these like all ready to go as soon as Zemeckis

1411
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
croaks and like

1412
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
next week?

1413
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
We've talked about this. Yeah, we think he's

1414
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
day one as soon as

1415
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
he's gone. I think Gale and Zemeckis have to be

1416
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
in the ground. Dead. No, no, not dead. Not in the ground.

1417
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
Oh, I think Gale.

1418
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
Just not breathing for ten minutes.

1419
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Have you guys seen the guy who did the video

1420
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
about Back to the Future movies

1421
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
predicting 9-11? No.

1422
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Just look it up. It's the best

1423
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
thing. It is

1424
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
fully convincing. Do you have an example

1425
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
of one way that it did? No, just look it up.

1426
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
Watch it on YouTube. It's one of, that's the

1427
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
only thing I'll plug.

1428
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
It was made, I think the guy, it was the last

1429
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
video he posted was three years ago.

1430
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
It is like the best edited, most beautiful

1431
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
thing. It's not a crazy

1432
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
person. It's someone who's like very smart.

1433
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
Whoa.

1434
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
It's something about like a

1435
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
bigger thing of like

1436
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
looking at reality in a different way.

1437
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
He's not like a crazy guy who actually

1438
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
thinks this, I think, but it's

1439
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
a real good watch. Whoa.

1440
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Alright. Check it out. Best video.

1441
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
Yeah. And then he also

1442
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
starts with this disclaimer with Tiny Type that's like

1443
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
I just want to say I think Robert Zemeckis

1444
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
is a great man. I don't think he knew about 9-11.

1445
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Decided to do nothing.

1446
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
Whoa.

1447
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
Sounds like you do think that to propose.

1448
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
It's worth watching. Whoa.

1449
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
Alright.

1450
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
Well, you're not going to find any merch for that video

1451
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
at the studio store.

1452
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
So do we have anything else in Francesca's?

1453
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
Do we? Well, was it, was the

1454
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
thing you just said from Francesca's or from

1455
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
Sublime Gifts and Finds?

1456
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
I think yours was from Francesca's,

1457
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
right? That's the

1458
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
compliment book. You're not going to be able to

1459
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
compliment the store.

1460
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
It was, yeah, that was the second one we went

1461
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
in. Do we never get to Sublime? They're

1462
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
the same store. No, we went into Sublime.

1463
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
That's where all the signs were. So we went to both

1464
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
but have we talked about them both? No, no.

1465
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
I haven't talked about Sublime.

1466
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Alright, go for it. So, Sublime

1467
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
Gifts and Finds, you know

1468
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
this is the sort of, kind of

1469
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
like, kitschy, it's

1470
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
sort of kitschy, but then

1471
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
it has like the illusions of like

1472
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
a little more upscale

1473
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
sort of gift shop sort of to

1474
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
it. I mean, they have like

1475
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
those Swell water bottles,

1476
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
those airtight water bottles that are very popular

1477
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
right now. They had some

1478
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
patty wax candles, which is like

1479
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
a higher end brand of candle.

1480
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
And

1481
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
this is the only, the sort of

1482
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
thing that can only exist in high traffic

1483
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
areas or else you're

1484
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
bringing in Marcus Lobotus and he's

1485
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
going to redo it because

1486
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
it's like, who

1487
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
else is buying this stuff besides

1488
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
like foot traffic, impulse

1489
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
buys. Well, speaking of, in

1490
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
the store, speaking of, we

1491
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
found

1492
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
casery phone cases from

1493
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
a recent episode of The Prophet

1494
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
and with no need to explain anymore

1495
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
what that means. Y'all know casery.

1496
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
There was a really good episode

1497
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
of the show that was a cliffhanger where

1498
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
these kind of turdy guys

1499
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
were, no, it was one turdy guy

1500
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
and two non-turds

1501
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
and they were all struggling to

1502
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
make expensive cell phone cases

1503
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
together. And then there's a schism

1504
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
in the episode, but I don't want to spoil

1505
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
it. But it was, yeah, once I realized

1506
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
we were looking at honest to God casery,

1507
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
I feel like we got to play to

1508
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
this. We've gotten enough compliments,

1509
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
the nice comps,

1510
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
some of the nicest compliments I've ever received

1511
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
about when we talk about The Prophet.

1512
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
So I feel like we have to. Yeah. So the

1513
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
casery's still going strong,

1514
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
but we know there's more to this story.

1515
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
There was a

1516
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
rack of casery cases

1517
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
in like a right, kind of

1518
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
in the center of the store for sale.

1519
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
For thirty dollars?

1520
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
For a cell phone case? Thirty dollars.

1521
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
Why would this ever be? Great margins.

1522
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
They said they paid like a dollar

1523
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
a case wholesale.

1524
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
The margins on that are insane.

1525
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
That's, The Prophet in general

1526
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
really opens your eyes to whenever you

1527
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
think that something costs

1528
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
too much money. It's always, what do you charge

1529
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
for that? Sixty. What does it cost you to make?

1530
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
Forty-five cents.

1531
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
I mean, that's this entire store.

1532
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
That was this entire store.

1533
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
It's a lot of, a lot of

1534
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
wooden sign. I wrote down some of

1535
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
them.

1536
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
Some of my favorites.

1537
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
This is

1538
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
another thing that's kind of popular right

1539
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
now, and it's a little befuddling to me,

1540
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
is the, is Mermaids? Cause there was

1541
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
like a bunch of, like,

1542
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
bikinis? No, sorry.

1543
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
Kind of pissed about not being a

1544
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
mermaid. That was a sign.

1545
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Mermaids don't lose sleep

1546
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
over the opinions of shrimp.

1547
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
That is a play on lions don't

1548
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
lose sleep over the opinions of

1549
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
sheep. What? But about mermaids.

1550
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
You never heard that saying? I don't think so.

1551
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
It's like an aggro, like,

1552
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
dude saying.

1553
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
You can find it a lot of different, like, Instagram

1554
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
photos.

1555
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
It's about not losing sleep

1556
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
over dudes. About

1557
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
not losing, so like, the one I've

1558
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
seen, the phrase I

1559
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
forget where, what this is traced back to

1560
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
it's lions don't lose sleep

1561
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
over the opinions of sheep. Oh, but the

1562
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
mermaid thing flips it. The mermaid flips it.

1563
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
So like, mermaids don't lose sleep over

1564
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
the opinions of shrimp.

1565
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
I'd say both are true.

1566
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
Yeah. Both are true.

1567
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
Nature. Both are true.

1568
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
No coffee, no workie.

1569
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
That was surprising to see.

1570
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
That is definitely a play

1571
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
on no, what is it?

1572
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
No tiki, no laundry, which is not

1573
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
acceptable. This is a thing you would

1574
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
see still at any point.

1575
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
At any farm, probably.

1576
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
They have like, or maybe

1577
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
not anymore, but up until two recently.

1578
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
I bet we can find one down there.

1579
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
There's a Chinese laundry there, and I think

1580
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
there's a sign. In Old West Town?

1581
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
Yeah. I think it says no tiki, no laundry.

1582
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
Are you guys going to do that on this show? We're doing everything

1583
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
on this show. We did not.

1584
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
There's one big episode. I remember.

1585
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
But you gotta do Ghost Town a lot.

1586
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
That's gonna be there. Oh my god.

1587
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Yeah, we have to do the whole show thing.

1588
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
We're gonna go back and redo everything

1589
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
in far, far more incremental

1590
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
steps now that we know our real pace.

1591
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
I think you should do an episode on the Calico mine.

1592
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
Right. 100%.

1593
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
Yeah, yeah. Now we'll start

1594
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
breaking them into pieces.

1595
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
This wine is making me awesome.

1596
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
You're the flip to my flop.

1597
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
You're a little more awesome. This one is the biggest

1598
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
leap that I saw. Bikinis?

1599
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
Oh, hell no. I thought you said

1600
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
martinis.

1601
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
Well, that's just a misunderstanding.

1602
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Yeah.

1603
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
In sign form.

1604
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
There's a bunch of keychains,

1605
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
and they have very similar

1606
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
things, like phrases and saying

1607
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
pretending to be a mature adult

1608
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
is exhausting, which isn't even clever.

1609
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
It's just sort of a sentence. But the company

1610
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
that makes these keychains is

1611
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
snarkcity.com.

1612
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
And I went to

1613
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
snarkcity.com into the sales

1614
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
section, and they have a bunch of mousepads.

1615
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
And they have

1616
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
primary business you should be in.

1617
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
They have one that says, nope, not today.

1618
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
And then they have, let me

1619
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
check my give a shit-o-meter.

1620
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
Nope, nothing.

1621
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
Which I think they should have caught the nope,

1622
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
nothing. No, I think they should have added

1623
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
to it and be like, nope, nothing.

1624
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
Turns out I don't give a shit.

1625
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
I mean, it's already

1626
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
a little crammed on here.

1627
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
It didn't even go up 20%

1628
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
of the way to give some of

1629
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
a shit. Here's what all the way at the

1630
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
bottom. Here's a mousepad.

1631
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
Pull yourself together. You've

1632
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
got bitches to battle and men to

1633
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
destroy.

1634
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
On a mousepad. On a mousepad.

1635
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
These are poorly

1636
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
graphic designed, too.

1637
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
I feel like I could picture this person coming

1638
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
into their office and swapping

1639
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
out the default mousepad

1640
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
and saying, oh, I don't want to deal with them.

1641
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
I hope that's for a woman to

1642
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
own. I hope.

1643
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
Yeah, so much.

1644
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
Wow, he sold a

1645
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
crate to the proud

1646
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
boys of Orange County.

1647
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
The sale's a sale.

1648
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
We could do an episode on snarkcity.com

1649
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
but that's just a taste. That's another one

1650
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
William. It's crammed with signs.

1651
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
They have a lot of that store

1652
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
sublime. Are those black

1653
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
woodblock signs with like the

1654
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
white text that

1655
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
I don't, does anyone know what

1656
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
their name is? I think it's all made by one company.

1657
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
And I know

1658
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
there's an, I rented an

1659
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
office and it's kind of owned

1660
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
by a lunatic and in the bathroom is one

1661
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
of these signs and

1662
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
it just says, like,

1663
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
replacing the toilet paper won't cause

1664
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
brain damage.

1665
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
So every time I like use the bathroom

1666
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
I have to like just be bummed out.

1667
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
But like it's like this very aggro sign.

1668
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
And so these have gotten, and it's

1669
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
the same company definitely. And

1670
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
the signs get so

1671
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
over, like, so they're giant

1672
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
some of them. And one of them is

1673
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
like, live your life. Take chances.

1674
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
Be crazy. Don't wait because right

1675
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
now it's the oldest you've ever been and the youngest

1676
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
you'll ever be again.

1677
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
And that's the one with the least amount

1678
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
of text. And this one

1679
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
was on the wall.

1680
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
And I was saying

1681
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
some of these feel like, you know, on the

1682
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
on an iPhone, if you

1683
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
just, if you have predictive text on it, you

1684
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
just tap the word to randomly

1685
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
assemble like a paragraph that sounds like

1686
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
human speech but isn't.

1687
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
Marry your best friend.

1688
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
I did not say that lightly. Really truly

1689
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
find the strongest, happiest friendship in the person

1690
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
you fall in love with. Someone who speaks highly

1691
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
of you. Someone you can laugh with. The kind of

1692
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
laughs that make your belly ache and your nose snort.

1693
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Your iris and your urn is healing. Kind of laughs.

1694
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
Wit is important. Life is too short. Not to love someone

1695
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
who lets you be a fool with them.

1696
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
Make sure they are somebody who lets you cry to despair

1697
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
will come. Find someone that

1698
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
you want to be there with you through these times.

1699
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
Most importantly, marry the one that makes passion, love

1700
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
and madness combine and course through you.

1701
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
A love that will never dilute even when the waters

1702
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
get deep and dark. That's a sign.

1703
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
That's so much to put on your wall.

1704
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
Whatever just happened to an

1705
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
Irish grandmother lives here.

1706
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
Something

1707
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
simple and nice. All of these signs

1708
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
sound like they are being bought

1709
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
by someone who says the phrase

1710
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
Hey, I'm not done talking to you yet.

1711
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
A lot of it.

1712
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
People are walking away. Hey, where are you going?

1713
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
Hey, I'm not done with you

1714
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
yet. Think you are too good for me?

1715
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
Yeah, each one should end with

1716
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
Hey, where are you going? I'm not done with you yet.

1717
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
This place is like a grandma Spencer's

1718
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
gifts. Like it's got

1719
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
some bawdy stuff but it's a lot of

1720
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
signs and signs that are supposed

1721
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
to show you what you're at. It's like

1722
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
this is who I am. Read the sign.

1723
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
There's a lot going on because there's also

1724
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
like a full wall of jewelry

1725
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
cases. Yeah. Like

1726
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
affordable jewelry.

1727
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
But I don't have any bearing on what jewelry is.

1728
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
There's the dad Annex

1729
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
2. That's the one little

1730
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
bookcase.

1731
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
John Wayne's guide to grilling and then

1732
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
the rest of it is like shitting related.

1733
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
I took a picture. There was all these like

1734
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
man soaps and I took a

1735
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
picture just because this one had such a crazy

1736
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
name. What was it called?

1737
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
Oh yeah, it's a bar of soap

1738
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
enabled navel supremacy.

1739
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
We just

1740
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
sold a crate of 200

1741
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
into the brown boys and orange.

1742
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
Dude Cannon Sublico.

1743
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
The one next to it says

1744
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
productivity wins the day.

1745
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
And then

1746
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
the one behind it is old Milwaukee

1747
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
big ass beer soap.

1748
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
Oh, that's right up

1749
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
a dad's alley.

1750
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
That's the Spencer's Gifts is what I'm saying. There's elements of Spencer's

1751
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
Gifts, but it's a lot of

1752
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
stuff. A lot of that. A lot of phone

1753
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
chargers that might spark on you

1754
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
and

1755
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
those cords that will fray

1756
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
very easily in your car. A lot of Kierkerland sort of

1757
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
like we were looking at the pen that's also a

1758
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
ruler and a level and

1759
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
you know, an eraser or whatever.

1760
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
A lot of like gadgets

1761
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
and gizmos. The specter of

1762
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
cleverness has haunted this

1763
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
particular retail zone because what this

1764
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
was for many years and very strongly

1765
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
in my memory of being younger and wandering

1766
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
around CityWalk was that it was an art

1767
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
gallery called Martin

1768
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
Lawrence Gallery. Oh, yeah.

1769
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
Yeah, if you remember that. Very

1770
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
strangely and obviously

1771
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
easy thing to comment on that

1772
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
Martin Lawrence. Am I going to find

1773
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
a painting of Shanae-Nae in there?

1774
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
But not in, no, in

1775
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
fact, I

1776
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
found a quote from some review

1777
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
of what it might have been and

1778
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
the straight up quote

1779
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
I think the literal art was

1780
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
fun, such as a cow

1781
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
standing on snow cleverly

1782
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
named Cold Cream.

1783
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
Clever?

1784
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
Is it? I don't know what that

1785
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
means exactly. Oh, because a cow makes cream.

1786
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
Snow is cold.

1787
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
So you got cold cream.

1788
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
So these new places. Famous phrase, cold cream.

1789
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
Of grain the cow. Yeah,

1790
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
it's like a popsicle stick joke.

1791
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
But the answer isn't something you've heard of.

1792
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Is it someone who thinks that

1793
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
ice cream is called cold cream?

1794
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
Shhhhhh!

1795
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
Can I see the dessert, man?

1796
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
What kind of cold cream you got?

1797
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
It's a regional thing.

1798
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
Yeah, it's a regional thing.

1799
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
You guys want some cold cream?

1800
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
It's like when the

1801
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
Simpsons where the Flanders have ice

1802
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
milk.

1803
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
Yeah, flavorless, please.

1804
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
Quite similar. The other one is

1805
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
a Scottish terrier being

1806
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
lifted up named Beam Me

1807
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
Up Scotty.

1808
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
Oh, that's pretty good.

1809
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
But as opposed to these being like

1810
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
knickknacks you could buy for $30,

1811
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
I think these are paintings that cost like $2,000.

1812
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
This is where

1813
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
Tony Soprano commissioned that painting

1814
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
of Pile by the Horse.

1815
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
I'm not watching

1816
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
The Sopranos, so I'm out on that

1817
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
one. It's pretty much all I watch anymore.

1818
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
Also, you could apparently

1819
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
buy Warhols at this gallery.

1820
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
Really? Yeah, you could go

1821
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
to City Walk and get a rain

1822
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
stick and like a giant

1823
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
pencil that or a

1824
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
giant toothbrush from the Giant Store

1825
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
and an Andy Warhol painting.

1826
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
Is the Giant Store still around?

1827
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
No, that was an early... and I don't even remember

1828
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
what sector that was in. That one's lost

1829
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
to the... I don't know. If you know the name of the Giant

1830
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
Store, please let us know.

1831
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
And I have another request too, which is

1832
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
some of these things that we read,

1833
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
these poems that are on these signs.

1834
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
I would like to see those little

1835
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
like affirmations written

1836
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
on top of photos of Jason.

1837
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
I think that would be

1838
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
a blast to see.

1839
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
And those would come and they would feel like

1840
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
the best compliments you've ever asked.

1841
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
Love my picture with

1842
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
badass bitch.

1843
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
Battle some bitches today,

1844
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
Jason. I would like

1845
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
a picture, if we're asking more things,

1846
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
I've asked so far on this podcast for

1847
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
a $400 head of

1848
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
the EVAC, the Transformers character.

1849
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
But I'd also like

1850
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
a cartoon of Jason asking for

1851
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
some cold cream, please.

1852
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
And probably like maybe tugging on

1853
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
like his mommy's apron when he's like a child.

1854
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
Like Nanny from Up at Babies.

1855
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
And she... her pattern

1856
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
to

1857
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
acknowledge the original painting,

1858
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
the apron is cowhide.

1859
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
And that

1860
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
keeps it in black and white so you don't have to add color

1861
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
to this painting that

1862
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
you're going to do at home necessarily. So that's

1863
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
your assignment, black and white.

1864
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
Within two to three weeks, please.

1865
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
And head of EVAC.

1866
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
Is that it? Do we make...

1867
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
Oh, also one of these used to be a sunglass hut where you walked through

1868
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
giant sunglasses to get in the store.

1869
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
Oh, that's nice.

1870
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
That would have been a fun homage

1871
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
to that. We don't

1872
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
have... we've been talking forever and ever, but I did

1873
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
think that maybe one final thing to put in

1874
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
this sector, why don't we annex

1875
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
the universal globe,

1876
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
the spinning globe itself

1877
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
that's

1878
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
facing the...

1879
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
If you're watching Extra

1880
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
where Mario Lopez broadcasts

1881
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
every day, you come to LA, you can

1882
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
be in the background. And the background

1883
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
is the studio store.

1884
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
So that's why I think it's in this

1885
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
sector. Do you

1886
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
know what time they film that every day?

1887
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
I was looking it up. I was wondering if I could

1888
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
get onto Extra.

1889
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
You can.

1890
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
If I could have done that on the slide

1891
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
today and then surprise you with my appearance

1892
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
on Extra. But I think you have to like, wait.

1893
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
And then it's not just like you're standing

1894
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
back there. I think you're like corralled by

1895
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
like an Extras guy. So...

1896
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
But I don't know. We could...

1897
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
You want to go to... Why don't we make

1898
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
other people do it? We keep commanding people.

1899
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
Go to Extra, hold up a

1900
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
sign, says podcast a ride.

1901
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
We're busy. We can't go. We should get like a Stern

1902
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
Show type thing. Like a Baba Booy.

1903
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
Or like a real like a trademark that people

1904
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
can go interrupt shots from

1905
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
like a new local news or

1906
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
get in the background of entertainment

1907
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
tonight or whatever. Scream hashtag

1908
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
Jason for DLR. Jason for

1909
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
DLR. Yeah.

1910
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
Cold Cream.

1911
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
You know what? I kind of like to see on some

1912
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
signs. I mean, we're taking other people's material

1913
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
here. But what's that? A new slap

1914
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
shot?

1915
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
Throw that on the sign. Hold it up from

1916
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
the back. Yeah. Any of your favorite references

1917
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
and we'll see what stick. Yeah.

1918
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
We don't want to create a Baba Booy.

1919
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
But I mean,

1920
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
we don't want to force one is what I'm saying.

1921
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
Yeah. Yeah. It has to happen organically.

1922
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
Yeah. I did watch that Dolan Brothers

1923
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
clip that you sent.

1924
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
The Vine Stars were interviewed

1925
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
at. So that's just one of many great moments

1926
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
that happened on Extra. Well, I actually

1927
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
didn't watch it. It was... Oh, really?

1928
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
Mari Lopez asked...

1929
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
There are these twins that

1930
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
started on Vine. They went to YouTube.

1931
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
I guess they... Oh, cool. They made the leap.

1932
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
There was a controversy

1933
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
because, like, they were,

1934
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
I guess, protegees of the Paul brothers.

1935
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
But then kind of had a falling out.

1936
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
But then... Did they get dissed in a rap?

1937
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
Oh, I don't know. Mari

1938
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
Lopez was like, what's

1939
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
the difference between you

1940
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
guys? Because they're identical twins.

1941
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
He's like, what's

1942
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
different about you?

1943
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
What kind of defines you guys?

1944
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
And they're both like, we pretty much have

1945
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
the same personality.

1946
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
Nothing, nothing, really.

1947
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
But I did think

1948
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
of

1949
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
for when they die,

1950
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
my eulogy

1951
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
will be for them,

1952
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
which is the

1953
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
Dolan Brothers didn't die.

1954
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
They simply became YouTube videos.

1955
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
Like in Westworld.

1956
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
Westworld.

1957
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
Let's see, I didn't get that.

1958
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
I don't get Sopranos and I don't get

1959
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
Westworld.

1960
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
I like it a lot, though.

1961
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
Too busy getting caught up on the Dolan Brothers.

1962
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
Watch the first ten hours of Westworld

1963
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
and that will make sense.

1964
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
Skip season two.

1965
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
Well, you should print that out, put it on a

1966
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
big board of piece of chalk

1967
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
and give it to the Dolan Brothers when they die.

1968
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
Alright.

1969
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
I'll hold that sign up when they die.

1970
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
At the Universal Globe.

1971
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
To honor them, hold it up in the background of Extra,

1972
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
which was once their domain.

1973
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
That's very nice.

1974
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
Well, I think with that...

1975
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
Oh, the Sector Stone is appearing.

1976
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
Oh yeah, it does.

1977
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
Hold on, hold on.

1978
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
There's a teen is telling us that

1979
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
this Sector Stone is not actually ready.

1980
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
They don't have it anymore.

1981
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
Really?

1982
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
So we're gonna have to get a replacement stone.

1983
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
Oh no.

1984
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
Here it comes, here's the replacement stone.

1985
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
Oh, I see it. Hey, what's that? A new Slap Chop?

1986
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
The stone is in the shape of a Slap Chop.

1987
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
The stone is in the shape of a

1988
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
of a Mr. Fusion, but it's a new Slap Chop.

1989
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
And it's got

1990
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
black text on it and it says

1991
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
people who live at Glass Houses

1992
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
should shut the fuck up.

1993
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
Is that us? Who's that?

1994
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
I don't know, it's for Blacksing.

1995
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
All the songs are for Blacksing.

1996
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
Oh yeah, the stones have been around forever.

1997
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
Alright, well, Jason Warner,
