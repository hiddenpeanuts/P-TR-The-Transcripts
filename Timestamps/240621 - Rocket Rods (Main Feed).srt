1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
FOREVER!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
DOG!

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Warning! The following podcast may rattle and grind so much it renders your speakers unsafe to use.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,000
You may encounter claustrophobic hallways and a nail-biting round of picking numbers from one to three.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Today, we examine the notorious, barely-opened, Tomorrowland-destroying 90s Disneyland attraction,

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
The Rocket Rods, on Podcast the Ride.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Welcome to Podcast the Ride, a podcast about theme parks where conversation and riffs fly

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:05,000
at breakneck speed and then, you know, slow down every six seconds or so because you don't want to go at too breakneck a speed.

9
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'm Scott Gertner, this is Mike Carlson.

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
That is really, that sums us up so perfectly.

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Yeah, yeah. Big runs and then kind of, and then just, you know, take our time.

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
We'll find the next one. Okay, there we go. Here's another run. Good.

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Yeah, some funny talk and then, you know, we talk about I Love Lucy actor William Frawley for a while to slow down,

14
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
to cool things down, to make sure that we don't get too hot, too fast.

15
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:34,000
This is very humble of you to call Frawley a slow down as opposed to one of the fastest tracks could ever do.

16
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Well, it excites me internally, but I don't know that it does that to the audience.

17
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,000
That's a speed ramp to you. The mere, even like thinking that you're going to say him, that gets your heart palpitating.

18
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,000
And then it coming out of your mouth and then watching Jason light up when you say it and then watching me be indifferent,

19
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
which lights you up further. That's true. Yeah. Frawley was always too exciting for me.

20
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Frawley was like a straight away. I think the windups, like the curves are more like saying things like 25 million,

21
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:12,000
May 22nd, 1998, saying the items. That's true. That's true.

22
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,000
But I guess it's the connective tissue. It gets you from the straight away to straight away. Jason Sheridan, hi.

23
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Hi. Yeah, today we are continuing the as kicked down the curb Tomorrowland series.

24
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Now in its third or fourth year. Yes. Yeah. As delayed as the real place.

25
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
And here's kind of what brings us back to this.

26
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:48,000
You know, we wanted to do like kind of the essential steps in telling the story of what brought us to the Tomorrowland we have today,

27
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
which is to say the ghost town.

28
00:02:51,000 --> 00:03:02,000
And Mike has pushed recently to get back on the Tomorrowland train in advance of D23.

29
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Yes, which is in August where the big Disney convention where there is the thought that maybe we will finally get some announcements.

30
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Well, that's what the feeling is, because of all this movement with Disneyland forward being approved and with Rhonda Santis and Disney making nice.

31
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
They're now they've dropped a lawsuit against him.

32
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
And now it seems like they're they're paving the way for a big expansion down there as well.

33
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:33,000
And they've booked what they booked the Honda Center for the actual theme parks panel at D23 this year.

34
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Yes. And just a reminder, the Honda Center is one of those venues that has the no bag rule unless they are clear.

35
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Right. You have a clear plastic bag as if you're going to visit Magneto in prison.

36
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
You just have to make sure. Well, hold on.

37
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
They could do some damage with those zippers, you know.

38
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Oh, that's a very good point. So you should have a plastic zipper if you're visiting Magneto in prison.

39
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Is this they don't want people filming the panels?

40
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I don't know, because they live stream it. It's I don't know.

41
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
This is also like certain venues have this rule.

42
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Yeah, this is Dodger Stadium when we went to see Elton John, like they kind of did this to my mother who had a purse.

43
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
So it's venues just in general.

44
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I don't know if it's easier to see if you have a knife on you.

45
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
A lot of baseball stadiums have have that.

46
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
But what if it's a clear knife or a clear gun and you're back with clear bullets?

47
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Well, we're back to square one now. Erase the whiteboard.

48
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Yeah, you've changed everything. So I wouldn't put it past Disney to book a very large venue and then not deliver.

49
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
That's possible.

50
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:46,000
It is kind of the current Disney way to take a big space communicator and then sort of do nothing with it.

51
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Yeah. So it's possible they're going to get it, drag everybody over there.

52
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Everyone's going to get really excited, like worked up in the lat into a lather.

53
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,000
And then they're going to say, well, we're thinking about doing a few things and then they'll float a few ideas.

54
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
And then they'll send everybody home with like a poster, like a poster of the new country bears.

55
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
And then like half the people there will be like, I think that was good.

56
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Yeah. And then the next day they like sober up and they go, what was that? I paid four hundred dollars for that.

57
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Some of them, but some of them never will. Some of them stay drunk forever.

58
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Some of them will drink the Kool-Aid and the Kool-Aid stays in me.

59
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,000
So yeah. So what you're saying is I believe there's a chance.

60
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I believe there's at least a percentage of a chance that new Tomorrowland stuff will be announced because they need to do this.

61
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
So I want to get our Tomorrowland stuff out of the way before because I want to see what our see,

62
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
because now we can then gauge our predictions versus what might be announced.

63
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,000
So we'll get to see who is right or what. Maybe we'll all be a little right if there.

64
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Yeah. And if we if we pull things out, because what we're building to is this episode where we we fix Tomorrowland and all the different paths to figure out how to do so.

65
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:05,000
And yeah. So if we accidentally predicted some things or if we said some things that are vastly more exciting than what gets announced.

66
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Right. Yeah, that's that's a good call. I still I hear you saying maybe this is the year we get to Marland.

67
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:20,000
And I think about like an Angels in the Outfield scenario where there's like an orphan who's like, maybe my dad will come back this time.

68
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Maybe my dad will stick around this year. I know my old my pops.

69
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
He cares about me. He loves me. I know it, even though he's got a leather jacket.

70
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
He's not just going to keep writing this time.

71
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I guess if we really want to gauge that there's a bigger chance they'll announce that like Disneyland forward stuff like over by the hotels, which is where they're going to expand.

72
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
That's more likely that they just announced a bunch of stuff from like over there.

73
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I think it is. Then saying Tomorrowland is going to finally get its redo.

74
00:06:50,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I think. Yeah. And I think new is going to be more exciting than redone or fixed, even though we know this is like, you know, if I were a homeowner, which I am not sure.

75
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I would imagine that, you know, there's things like the it's more exciting to try to add to turn the, you know, to turn the garage into a guest house or whatever.

76
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:21,000
But when you've got like when the plumbing stinks, when there is a terrible sulfur smell in your house, it's not an exciting way to spend the money.

77
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
But you sort of have to do it right. That's true.

78
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
They did announce that they're going to make the vehicles in Autopia electric.

79
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
So I think that's also partly why some people think, OK, well, there's some movement in that area of the park.

80
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:46,000
That's at least an indicator that what the clue that that unlocks, I feel, is that Autopia and subs don't get demolished because if they're investing in there at all.

81
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Yeah, right. It's not like that is going to become Avatar.

82
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:56,000
So that news is a disappointment to me because I would love that area to go in for it to become.

83
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
But I know. But at least I remain excited.

84
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
And I don't know if we'll get an announcement soonish.

85
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
But Avatar is the thing that they have shown. Yeah. Yes.

86
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I know. I don't know if we'll get it this year.

87
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
But it seems like a given that there will be something Avatar coming to the park.

88
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
But it's a matter of is it over in Disneyland forward?

89
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
It's probably not Disneyland proper, which maybe doesn't make sense.

90
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
There's weird DCA rumors too. I don't know. I don't know.

91
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Well, you'll be excited to know that some of the houses at the Katino story living will have shutters, not just blinds.

92
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,000
What if they do that? They drag everybody into this big Honda center room and they just mostly talk about Katino.

93
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,000
They talk about their different like housing developments, their building seems really possible.

94
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I posted about this. I noticed a really mundane Katino video.

95
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,000
And so it might be like, ladies and gentlemen, welcome the designers from Shea Holmes.

96
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Very well. I don't know. Yeah.

97
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
In between like Jon Favreau coming out and doing nothing.

98
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Yeah, they do a lot of that with people.

99
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Of course, they brought Dick Van Dyke out to announce the Mary Poppins thing that never happened.

100
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
God, they did. Yeah.

101
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
In 2019, they brought him out and they're like, Dick Van Dyke.

102
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Dick Van Dyke. Everyone goes nuts, of course.

103
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
And then they're like, and of course, in Epcot, we're doing the Mary Poppins thing,

104
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
which it turns out that was going to be nothing, basically, like a spinner ride, maybe.

105
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Really? And canceled. Oh, man.

106
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
People are like, oh, is it going to be like that Tony Baxter ride he developed,

107
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,000
like before he worked in Imagineering that there's a video about and it was like on the carousel.

108
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
And then things would leave the track and they would go along a dark ride. Have you ever seen this?

109
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
You start on it. It was the idea that you would start on it.

110
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
It feels like you're on a carousel horse that's on a carousel and then it departs.

111
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Right, like in the movie, the first movie, yeah.

112
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
The first movie.

113
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Yeah, well, you remember the sequel.

114
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
You mean the only Mary Poppins. Let's come on.

115
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
No, no, wait, hold on.

116
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Quit fucking around. You mean in Mary Poppins, the only movie.

117
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Mary Poppins 1.

118
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I refuse.

119
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Mary Poppins 3.

120
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Is it Topsy Origins?

121
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Do you think we're going Topsy Origins?

122
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Well, that's more of a Disney Plus streaming series.

123
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Oh, okay. It's eight episodes. Topsy Origins.

124
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
In which Topsy doesn't appear until the very, very end.

125
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Well, how did she become Topsy is the question everyone's asking.

126
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
That's the question.

127
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Yeah, how did she turn? Is it Turning Turtle? Is that the song?

128
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I'm so disappointed in you for not remembering the name Topsy or remembering her famous song.

129
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Okay, it's a lot of T's.

130
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
It's a lot of T's.

131
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
So disappointed in you.

132
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
That should be on the forefront of your mind at all moments.

133
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Turning Turtle.

134
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,000
It's almost like if you can't quite remember it, maybe that means that it's time for the runner to be retired.

135
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Is that a thought? That's something, isn't it?

136
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Well, Jason can't. So I guess if Jason can't remember it, then fine.

137
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I'll only bring it up three times a year and not six.

138
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,000
What's the name of Madame's owner, the ventriloquist?

139
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,000
The long dead ventriloquist. Well, Madame's not my thing.

140
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Yeah, but it's been said. This is my new rule. If we can't all remember it, it's out.

141
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
You don't remember who operates Madame?

142
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
This is not fair. This is not any sort of barometer.

143
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
This isn't fair.

144
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,000
It indicates a lack of interest among all of the hosts of the show.

145
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,000
It indicates that if it is not penetrated, everybody in the room, then why are we...

146
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
No, no, no, no, no. Put the phone down. That doesn't count.

147
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I'm just dismissing some notifications.

148
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
About what?

149
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
A pill reminder.

150
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Of course it's that.

151
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I didn't want them to interrupt my notes. I have my notes over here.

152
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Okay, okay. So moving on, no more Turtle, no more Whalen Flowers and Madame. There I said it.

153
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:58,000
So today, I think this is kind of a crucial piece of what brings us to the Tomorrowland we've had for so many decades now.

154
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:06,000
This is really the culprit, and it's also something that is kind of a dwindling resource in this show.

155
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:14,000
We are running out of things to talk about, topics that you could possibly call Disney's worst ride.

156
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:21,000
And here we have a definite, very solid candidate, and that is the Rocket Rods.

157
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I've been looking forward to the Rocket Rods a lot. I remember it very strongly.

158
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:38,000
This was in 1998, Jason's Slowdown Facts you said earlier, May 22, 1998, part of the new Tomorrowland redo.

159
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:44,000
And what I remember strongly, and I think I've talked about this before, is how this was right around...

160
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I was clearly, I was a big Disneyland kid in this era, and where getting to be a kid then in the early 90s,

161
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,000
in the first half of the Disney decade, where it seems like things just keep getting better and better.

162
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:05,000
There's Toontown, and then there's Indiana Jones, like the ultimate just like raise of the bar of themed entertainment.

163
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Where are things going next? What are they doing next? And what they did next was take away the Electrical Parade,

164
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:19,000
replace it with light magic, this upsetting thing about Pixies, then this, then new Tomorrowland.

165
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:29,000
And all this in the same time that the Simpsons got bad. This was a time that let me know that institutions can fail me.

166
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:38,000
That maybe I can't trust the long running hallowed institutions that give me the entertainment that I enjoy the most.

167
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
The end of innocence in a lot of ways.

168
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:49,000
It kind of was. In a time that's already awkward, upset, I consider it part of, sure it was middle school bad,

169
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
because I didn't know how to talk to girls, and I didn't know what current music to like.

170
00:13:53,000 --> 00:14:00,000
But I'd say equal to that was Disneyland starting to not be good anymore.

171
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Oh wow, we were still cooking on the East Coast. We had Animal Kingdom, we had the Islands of Adventure Preview Center,

172
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
and Islands of Adventure after it.

173
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,000
You put Preview Center in the running of the park itself?

174
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I was going chronologically.

175
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I know Mike that the Islands of Adventure Preview Center had a big impact on your adolescence.

176
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Yeah, it really, all the girls loved hearing about the Preview Center, so that helped me with girls too.

177
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:37,000
And I guess there's going to be some kind of jazz club at their city walk? They're not calling it E-Zone anymore.

178
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
It's pretty cool. Anyway, how about a smooch?

179
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Also, the Scott Bale song, How Do You Talk to Girls, helped me out a lot too with that.

180
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Rick Springfield wrote it, of course. That helps too.

181
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Instruction manual, song instruction manual.

182
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:01,000
So, okay, you know what, you do paint that, that on the East Coast, this is not so much your problem.

183
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:09,000
It was my problem. I'm a big Disneyland guy, and this was highly anticipated, and it kind of all undeniably was let down.

184
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Did you clock any of this at the time? Were you aware that Rocket Rods and a disappointing New Tomorrowland were going on?

185
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Or do you not clock it until you start going to Disneyland as your park and there's still kind of the remnants of it?

186
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I don't clock it at all at this time. It's not even on my radar.

187
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I'm more focused on Islands of Adventure, and I don't even know if I knew what Rocket Rods were until like late 2000s.

188
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Okay, wow, wow.

189
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Yeah, kind of the same. I was thinking about, because eventually Tomorrowland 98, eventually you get Buzz Lightyear after it a few years later.

190
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:58,000
And I was like, oh, the first time I went to Disneyland is like 2006.

191
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:04,000
And I definitely was like, so that used to be the people mover, and it's just empty.

192
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,000
And then it's dawning on me like, oh, that's coming up on 20 years ago.

193
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
And that track remains empty.

194
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Yeah, yeah. Well, in that, I mean, it's been empty technically since 2001.

195
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,000
So we have, what, 23 years of empty track. It's wild.

196
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Right.

197
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
That's a good basic to bring up kind of before we get into the whole history.

198
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:37,000
But Cliff notes of it, Rocket Rods were a high speed replacement for the people mover, which we did a few episodes about.

199
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Slow moving, very pleasant trip through the second story of Tomorrowland remains in Disney World under a different name.

200
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:56,000
But kind of this just like, you know, hey, that's something like a something the whole family can do, an attraction that really wasn't hurting anybody.

201
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Yeah.

202
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Be hard to complain about it, I think.

203
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Right.

204
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Somebody somewhere gets the idea.

205
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:08,000
What if this was a rip roaring roller coaster rocket ride?

206
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Yeah, it's just a funny thought to have, because it's like, what if somebody was like, why don't we make the train around Disneyland go super fast?

207
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
You're like, I don't think that's the point of this.

208
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I like going fast, but why would you use the same track and change a thing whose point was to like, look at everything in a pleasant way?

209
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Yeah, it's just a funny idea.

210
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
And then to carry out it like it was cursed from the beginning.

211
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
The idea itself is flawed.

212
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
You're right.

213
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Yeah.

214
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Let's take the Columbia River boat.

215
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Let's take that.

216
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Let's take the Mark Twain.

217
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
And yeah.

218
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Yeah.

219
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Rockets on the Mark Twain.

220
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Jason, what if Mark Twain went really fast?

221
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,000
If it went from a 12 minute ride to a two and a half minute ride or something.

222
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Yeah.

223
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,000
What if it spins around and shoots around the lake really fast?

224
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Yeah.

225
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
They do not put in any chairs or restraints.

226
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
So everyone is nauseated.

227
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:07,000
People are just constantly thrown in the water multiple times a day.

228
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Unless you hold on.

229
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Yeah.

230
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
So yeah, that's just.

231
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
It's up to you.

232
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,000
That system would reward someone like Jason who knows the ship very well.

233
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
You would know where the railings were and the secure items.

234
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
But you wouldn't grab like a life preserver because that's going to snap off.

235
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Yeah.

236
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
And he would get to hug his favorite ship too, which is nice.

237
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Yeah.

238
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
For dear life.

239
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
But you would give a few kisses while you were there.

240
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Well, if I'm already there.

241
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Yeah.

242
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
And I'm already hugging.

243
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Exactly.

244
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
If you're already hugging, you might as well be kissing.

245
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Yes.

246
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
So yeah.

247
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
No, I just like, he's like, why don't we take a thing that goes nice and slow and make it

248
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
fast?

249
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
It's a really good point.

250
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Yeah.

251
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Take the castle and put it on a pole and have it like go up and down.

252
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Shoot.

253
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Like huh?

254
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Turn it into a big swing shot ride.

255
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Hey, these horses are interesting who we have down Main Street, but what if we made them

256
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
like race?

257
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
What if we had people like racing on horses down Main Street?

258
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Like, I don't know if that's the point of the horses, but okay.

259
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Yeah, boy.

260
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Well, you've really driven right to the core.

261
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
That's true.

262
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I mean, it's like they're there and that's what they're doing.

263
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
They're doing a 180.

264
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
They're trying to turn one type of experience into another.

265
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
But the question is, did anyone want that?

266
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,000
And if you're going to do a new roller coaster, why wouldn't you do that from scratch?

267
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Why would you?

268
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Yeah.

269
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Just do a different thing.

270
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Yeah.

271
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Of all the things to fix in Tomorrowland, I don't think the people mover was one of

272
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
them.

273
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Right.

274
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:36,000
And that's where I'll get into kind of Tomorrowland 98 history because, okay, so it's the early

275
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:42,160
nineties and it's clear that in all the parks there is a Tomorrowland problem, but especially

276
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,160
in Disneyland.

277
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,000
I think that one was struggling the most.

278
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,000
And this narrative that's said a lot by Imagineers is just like, you know, keeping things futuristic,

279
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:55,000
trying to predict the future is very tricky because the present catches up to the future.

280
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:00,000
And I feel like even like staying current, not even aiming for futurism, but staying

281
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
current is really tough.

282
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Yeah.

283
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Which has led to all of these, like we've touched on some of them, but these like kind

284
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,000
of like inane exhibits that get lapped pretty quickly.

285
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
So always sort of a struggle.

286
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:18,000
But what's weird is, I mean, I think it was kind of a fraught land always, like the Tomorrowland

287
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
at the end of the 50s seems real rough.

288
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Right.

289
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Then 67 is the first big redo and they put in, you know, some of the primary pieces,

290
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,000
you get Carousel Theater and you get rocket jets up on the platform and we're getting

291
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:36,000
closer to like the building blocks of a land that can't really go anywhere.

292
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Past that, we finally start getting locks.

293
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:43,000
There are attractions that are locks that you can't do anything with, maybe like aesthetic

294
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
plus ups or new movies or whatever.

295
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,000
But that's something I think is so strange about the land is that it's a fraught land,

296
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
but Space Mountain, lock.

297
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Star Tours, lock.

298
00:20:53,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Magic Eye Theater, what's in it is not necessarily a lock, but at least there was a time where

299
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
it being a movie theater is a lock.

300
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:10,000
So, you know, if you're going to redo an entire land, you've got trouble here because there

301
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
are locks to work around.

302
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
There are rides that you probably want to keep open as much as possible.

303
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Hard to just blow up the entire thing and start over, which is sort of what they did

304
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:26,000
for Fantasyland, the Tony Baxter's very successful Fantasyland redo.

305
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:33,000
It was all just demolished and rebuilt, but something you can't really do here.

306
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:38,000
The things that they need to change, Mission to Mars, we talked about that.

307
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,000
That is like a 70s view of space travel.

308
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
And that's true of a lot of these things.

309
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:49,000
You've got America Sings, which is a show for the Bicentennial in 76, which was there

310
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
until 88.

311
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
They finally clear it out.

312
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
They kick all the robots out and send them over to Splash Mountain.

313
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
That's been sitting vacant since 88.

314
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Circle Vision, still not a lot.

315
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I remember that was feeling like a Ghost Town by mid-90s, and they're playing a movie from

316
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
84.

317
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
This is a messy land.

318
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:16,000
But of all the things, PeopleMover is not one of anyone's complaints.

319
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
You change the vehicle.

320
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,000
PeopleMover there had tops on it, unlike Disney World's.

321
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
So you change the look of the vehicles, perhaps?

322
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
That is something.

323
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Neon stripes.

324
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
This is before they realized the answer is always neon stripes.

325
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Right.

326
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Yeah, put a neon strip or something on the sides or something.

327
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
You could do that.

328
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Well, yeah, and that almost could have saved rocket rods.

329
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:47,000
But it got cost cut, and then it was going to get in, and then they just shut it down.

330
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
That was a possibility.

331
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
It was some lighting stuff.

332
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:57,000
So around this time, they're starting to solve the Tomorrowland problem in other parks with

333
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,000
kind of this notion of future that never was.

334
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Not trying to be literal sci-fi future, but kind of a more fantastical version of it.

335
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Euro Disney, they don't do Tomorrowland at all.

336
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:21,000
They do Discoveryland, which is this steampunk European fantasy, Jules Verne, H.G. Wells,

337
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:27,000
pseudo-Victorian kind of vibe, a lot of bronze and gold and copper.

338
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Of all the things in Euro Disney that were there from day one, this land is a banger.

339
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
I think it's still really great.

340
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:42,000
There's been some changes to it, but I think essentially the aesthetic has remained,

341
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
and it's really good.

342
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I could see why they started clocking this as the answer.

343
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:52,000
We're not going to try to keep up with whatever rockets are being used in real life anymore.

344
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
It was just aesthetically really great.

345
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Tomorrowland 94 in Magic Kingdom is fantastic.

346
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:11,000
That is this other kind of sci-fi, more routed through 50s, 60s, kooky B movie, Buck Rogers, Flash Gordon.

347
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:17,000
We're starting to get some examples of how we do Tomorrowland that's this fun,

348
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:23,000
always relevant sort of, where they don't have to keep updating it.

349
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Which brings us to what they wanted to do here, which is Tomorrowland 2055.

350
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
We haven't talked about this a ton.

351
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:37,000
This is one of those things that's very haunting, because anything you see, concept art, logo, boy, this looked really cool.

352
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Yes.

353
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Yeah, I know.

354
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:44,000
I guess it's imagining what it would look like now, and I'm like,

355
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:49,000
it would probably make Tomorrowland my favorite part of Disneyland maybe.

356
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Yeah, I think so.

357
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
I think.

358
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Yes.

359
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
It's really glowy.

360
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
It's crystals.

361
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
There's kind of a story, and the crystals are part of it.

362
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:02,000
There's potential for a whole, we dig into everything about this and speculate what this would have been.

363
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:08,000
But there are all these exciting possibilities, especially of what the non-locks become, right?

364
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Mission to Mars becomes Alien Encounter, which we got in Florida, but this might have been a better venue for it.

365
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
It might have made sense.

366
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Carousel Theater becomes Plekdu's Fantastic Galactic Review.

367
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Again, I think there's a whole, we need to try to find every drop of information about this.

368
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Yeah, this is its own episode.

369
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
It's not a lot.

370
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:34,000
The Circlevision Theater probably gets the Timekeeper show, which went to Florida,

371
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:41,000
which finally gave a story to one of these 360 Circlevision movies with the animatronics and Robin Williams here.

372
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
The successful show, really good show.

373
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
I assume that's what it would have been here.

374
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:53,000
So big possibilities, cool possibilities, very distinct and different from the other New Tomorrow lands they've figured out.

375
00:25:53,000 --> 00:26:03,000
But Euro Disney fails, and this is part of the, there's the most frequently recurring words in theme park history,

376
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
but Euro Disney fails, and then X.

377
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Yeah, it's really, it feels so much more dire now, knowing that they're not going to ever do a big land that has a bunch of original characters in it.

378
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:22,000
It almost feels like if you had the time machine, it would be so important to go back in time and either stop Euro Disney from being built

379
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:27,000
so Tomorrowland 2055 can get built, because we know in the future it will be impossible.

380
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:35,000
So it's the last chance for us to have something crazy like this with a bunch of original characters and not just a bunch of movie rides.

381
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:44,000
I have a time machine. I know where I'm going. I'm going right to Europe in the mid 20th century.

382
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Oh, Hitler, you're going to go kill, no, no, no, no, no, no, way more important.

383
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:54,000
I'm going to go, I'm going to find Michael Eisner, you're going to kill Michael Eisner? No, no, of course not.

384
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
No, I love Michael Eisner. No, I'm going to shake his hands, say fine work so far.

385
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
I just have some information that you might want to see.

386
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
And then I'll let him keep doing his job, because he's doing a bang up job.

387
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:08,000
And then you would, I would also like tell him, like, they're going to come for you in the late 1990s or early 2000s.

388
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Like, here's how we get around that. Here's how you reign as CEO until you die.

389
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Like, I would also, there's the other stuff I want to do if I'm going to talk to him in the time machine.

390
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
And yeah, make sure that he's still running the company now.

391
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Oh, man, that's a very good idea. Yeah, yeah. Just give him all the answers to the test.

392
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:29,000
And then you know what? You got a time machine. Let him go back and kill Hitler. Give him the glory.

393
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Yeah, right. That's good.

394
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Because imagine how that shores up support for everything he wants to do.

395
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,000
You're going to argue with this guy? This is the guy who put in Star Tours and killed Hitler.

396
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Hello. I'm here in the bunker. I've just strangled Adolf Hitler.

397
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,000
With his own hand. He strangled him.

398
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
That's right. I killed him. No big deal.

399
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Are you Adolf Hitler? Goodbye.

400
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:03,000
I'm Michael Eisner, chairman of the Walt Disney Company, and your killer.

401
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Now it's time to go back to the future, where I may reign until I'm 120.

402
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
God, I do it. CEO of Disney.

403
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,000
I know, because without, you take that piece away, and then it keeps, and we get the full Disney decade.

404
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,000
But basically, there's still now, you know, they need to do something.

405
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,000
There's literally empty attractions.

406
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:31,000
You know, what was a big plus up in the late 80s now is a somewhat outdated 3D movie,

407
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,000
a singing and dancing show starring an accused child molester.

408
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
This needs to go. A lot of things need to happen.

409
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:43,000
So they need, we have to figure out some version of a Tomorrowland redo,

410
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
but I don't think it can be Tomorrowland 2055.

411
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
But let's keep all the people on it, because it's the best people on it.

412
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:53,000
It's Tony Baxter. It's Bruce Gordon, who was part of Splash Mountain.

413
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:59,000
So this is part of what's heartbreaking about it, is that there's like the best of the best,

414
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
but they have been severely handcuffed.

415
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,000
They are given a third of the budget that they wanted,

416
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:10,000
which probably still like trickles, like gets less and less as they do the whole thing.

417
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
That is interesting to think about.

418
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Like, well, even before this redo, there was some Ghost Town elements of Tomorrowland.

419
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
It's like history rhyming.

420
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:30,000
It's like, well, still a Ghost Town now, but was also a Ghost Town before the ostensible redo.

421
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:36,000
And some of the things that remain the big problem areas today were the problem areas then.

422
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:41,000
I mean, it's like it fixed it, you know, like a ride that they were tired of running

423
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,000
or that they might have stopped running entirely became a restaurant, which makes them money.

424
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000
But it's not the most exciting thing they could do.

425
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Carousel Theater is the biggest tragedy area in the history of Disneyland.

426
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,000
It's insane. Yeah, it's like these places are cursed.

427
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,000
So look, because it's Tony Baxter, you have to imagine that this is part of it,

428
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:07,000
that he was kind of the main voice behind Discoveryland, which was very successful.

429
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:14,000
And that's where it becomes, well, what if we sort of Discoverylandify our existing Tomorrowland,

430
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
which is why we get Astro Orbiter.

431
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:23,000
But Astro Orbiter has all these pieces that are too complicated and too heavy to put up on top of that tower.

432
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
So you got to move it to the front of the park.

433
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
And we've complained about this before. Nobody likes this.

434
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,000
This is like a big traffic bottleneck and it's crazy.

435
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:36,000
And then they just took the bones of the old rocket jets and set up a show that they don't run anymore.

436
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Right.

437
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
This is all crazy.

438
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Captain EO is replaced by Honey, I Shrunk the Audience.

439
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
That is fine, but it is not new.

440
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
That has been running at Epcot for a little while.

441
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Yeah.

442
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
So yeah.

443
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
InnoVentions.

444
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,000
This is not the same InnoVentions from Florida.

445
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
I might argue worse, right? Right?

446
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Seems like it.

447
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Do you think? Yeah.

448
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
I guess only I went of the three of us.

449
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Yeah, I didn't go, so I don't know firsthand.

450
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
It was pretty inane.

451
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:14,000
There's a big tree in the middle and this kind of unpleasant Nathan Lane-voiced robot.

452
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
It was not a good deal, I didn't think.

453
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Yeah.

454
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:26,000
I saw it later in the 2010s when there was a throwback House of the Future

455
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:33,000
that was mostly bad Windows touchscreen that the iPhone had already lapped it.

456
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Yeah, those touchscreens did not work.

457
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,000
It's Marty McFly's house in 2015 where the fake windows break

458
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
and he gets into fights with the mechanics of it.

459
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:48,000
There was an hour-long wait to try a segue.

460
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Again, we're talking 2010s.

461
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Occasionally, Awesome-O would come out, very rarely,

462
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:03,000
and then there was some testing stations where you could test out Disney Infinity.

463
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Is that what it was called?

464
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
That was that video game.

465
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:11,000
That was the Xbox game that you could buy little figures for.

466
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Yeah, the little figures.

467
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:17,000
This was a few rounds of Disney Interactive layoffs ago,

468
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:22,000
and it was like, all right, all the characters get together and they meet,

469
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,000
and they gave up on that idea.

470
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:31,000
All companies eventually did, like, fighting game where all the characters meet.

471
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Nickelodeon does it, Warner Brothers has it, but it's mostly for free on your phone.

472
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
This wasn't a fighting game.

473
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
This wasn't like a Street Fighter.

474
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
It was like an adventure game.

475
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
People might have liked that.

476
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
People might have played it.

477
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,000
It's too successful of a genre for them to do.

478
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Was that still called Interventions when it was that house?

479
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
I think so.

480
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
I believe so, because I don't think it changes until it's,

481
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
it doesn't change fully until it's Star Wars launch bay.

482
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Launch bay.

483
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,000
With no offense to the launch bay.

484
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,000
We always wanted to go to a Star Wars launch bay when you see the movies.

485
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Remember when they kind of like had a corner of a room painted like the Cantina bar?

486
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
I do, yeah.

487
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
There was no characters there.

488
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
There were no characters.

489
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:17,000
There was no drinks, seemingly.

490
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,000
So that being said, meeting Chewie was fun and we did it a few times.

491
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Well, good news, I think you can still do it.

492
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
I think that's probably right.

493
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:33,000
But this entire building and the only thing that's good about it is like a room the size of your bedroom where you meet Chewbacca.

494
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Yeah, in 30 years, that's all that's been good there is meeting Chewbacca.

495
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:41,000
And if you go back to America Sings, you might say it's all that's been good there in 40 years.

496
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
How long are we talking?

497
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
50 years?

498
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,000
If you have that perspective.

499
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Mission to Mars, the attraction is replaced by a restaurant.

500
00:33:51,000 --> 00:34:01,000
And the restaurant that it was supposed to be was a Tony Baxter conceived restaurant that was like a Planet Hollywood of all the old Tomorrowland vehicles.

501
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:07,000
So you could eat in a people mover car or what else?

502
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,000
A rocket jet or an old monorail car or whatever.

503
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,000
It was going to pay tribute to the past and reuse all these things.

504
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:18,000
But in a clever way, everybody wants to pop into one of those, eat pizza in one of those.

505
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,000
But that got cut and it just became a cafeteria.

506
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Yeah.

507
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Hey, put a pin in those old ride vehicles because they'll come back later on.

508
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
They do.

509
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:34,000
They do have a way to get all that stuff out of the junkyard.

510
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:39,000
The main thing that happens here is a paint job.

511
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:43,000
We are going to turn Tomorrowland into Discoveryland via paint.

512
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:49,000
So everything gets paint that is supposed to be like bronze, gold, dark brown, some emerald green.

513
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,000
And this leads to something that I don't recall if we've ever talked about on the show before.

514
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:57,000
The brief strange era where Space Mountain was brown.

515
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Yeah.

516
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
You guys ever see brown Space Mountain in person?

517
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Not in person.

518
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Not in person, no.

519
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
It was really strange.

520
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
I saw it.

521
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
I went to Discoveryland.

522
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
I like the colors of Discoveryland.

523
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,000
It's pretty astounding and they've kept it up.

524
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:18,000
This looks like, I don't, it's just, it's a very shit brown, right?

525
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Yeah.

526
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
It's not gleaming.

527
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
It's not gold.

528
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
It's shit.

529
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,000
It looks like it literally rusted over.

530
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Or like, it just looks like something's wrong, I guess.

531
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
That's really what it is.

532
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
It looks like Space Mountain is sick.

533
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Space Mountain is sick.

534
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Or it's like.

535
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
It's reverse ET.

536
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
ET gets very white when he's dying.

537
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,000
When Space Mountain is dying, it gets un-white.

538
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Well, sick ET Space Mountain is, I've never thought about it like that.

539
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Me neither, yeah.

540
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Yeah, it's just, it looks like, yeah, the park is decayed or something.

541
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
It's post-apocalyptic.

542
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Post-apocalypse.

543
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Yeah, yeah.

544
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
You found Disneyland 200 years after anyone's been there.

545
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Rust-colored.

546
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Mm-hmm.

547
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Yeah.

548
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
It's odd.

549
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
It was so weird.

550
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,000
It also, I swear, had an effect of making it look smaller.

551
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Like the mountain looked worse.

552
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
I believe that.

553
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Yeah, really weird.

554
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:17,000
I just like, even going by Splash Mountain when seeing it now being changed to Tiana's,

555
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:22,000
I'm just like so amazed at how much it fooled me, how big I thought it was.

556
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Just taking some of the pieces away from it make me go, oh, wait.

557
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,000
I, in my mind, it's like huge and it's way back.

558
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:33,000
And if you look at how it is now, you're like, oh, it's much closer than I think it is.

559
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Oh, interesting.

560
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:40,000
And it's much smaller just because it takes away some of like the whatever laughing place stuff and the whatever.

561
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
What do you call them?

562
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Briars, I guess that's what they're saying.

563
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Briar patch, yeah.

564
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
So like all that stuff.

565
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:49,000
So like I would imagine that even changing colors on things sometimes you would now be, oh, wait.

566
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
It's not as big as I thought it was.

567
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Yeah, yeah.

568
00:36:52,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Yeah, I guess that log did a lot of heavy lifting at the top of space in terms of like it added an extra 10 or so.

569
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Yeah, it really did.

570
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:05,000
So yeah, seeing this a different color would be interesting.

571
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Yeah, it was all really weird.

572
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Just like this case of this was the plan.

573
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:19,000
The plan was some different paint and then a lot of attractions from other places.

574
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Yeah.

575
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:29,000
And if you just viewed all of this and they're calling it New Tomorrowland, we don't have a lot here that's genuinely new.

576
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:39,000
And that's why the heat was really on the only genuine new attraction, the brand new e-ticket they were calling it.

577
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Wow.

578
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Rocket rods, the new high speed.

579
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:56,000
And that's like in this Tomorrowland tradition of inventing types of technology, showing us what the future will hold, why in the future we'll all be driving around in rocket rods.

580
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:05,000
It actually is sort of like now that some cyber trucks are around, it is like as dumb and clunky as a cyber truck to some extent.

581
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
That's true.

582
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Might rather drive a rocket rod around.

583
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:18,000
That actually, let me bring up that because that's something, okay, that Tony Baxter restaurant where you're going to eat in the vehicles.

584
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:24,000
The bar at Disney is very high for how cool a new vehicle looks and a futuristic vehicle looks.

585
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
The rocket rod itself.

586
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

587
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Is really, it's just so functional.

588
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
It's like kind of an ATV or something.

589
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Yeah, it looks pretty ugly.

590
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Yeah.

591
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Like if I'm being nice, it's somewhere in the world of like, if I'm squinting, we're not that far from like the journey to the center of the earth ride vehicles.

592
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,000
So that's now I'm being, I'm really stretching to even get it there.

593
00:38:51,000 --> 00:39:00,000
But if you see it from a distance, because that's sort of a similar, kind of this odd, long, you know, past but future vehicle.

594
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,000
But like, would you want a toy of rocket rods?

595
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Would you want a toy of rocket rods?

596
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Well, now because of the kitsch factor or the...

597
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Yeah, sure.

598
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Yeah, but no, it's not like a particularly cool vehicle.

599
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:19,000
If you were judging it against like the Ninja Turtle vehicles, this is not even in the top five or ten.

600
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:23,000
As you judge everything, as you judge the people in your life against.

601
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Right.

602
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,000
This is not as good as the toilet taxi.

603
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,000
I love my dad, but is he as cool as the toilet taxi?

604
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
No, he's not.

605
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:40,000
There's so much contradictory stuff with Tomorrowland 98 and rocket rods, especially because it's like, it's new.

606
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,000
It's like people mover before us.

607
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,000
It's a potential future transit.

608
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:51,000
And each vehicle holds as many people as a Toyota Corolla.

609
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Yes, and is like a third as long.

610
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
A third as long, and it's heavy.

611
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Like it is heavy and it is destroying the road it's on.

612
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Yeah, yeah, really grinding it up.

613
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:11,000
And the start stop, don't worry, it's destroying the engine inside of it.

614
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Yeah, it really, God, it really is just a like a self-immolating ride vehicle.

615
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Yeah.

616
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
But at least it's whisper quiet.

617
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Actually, no, it is the opposite of whisper quiet.

618
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
That was the big thing when these were running.

619
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:32,000
If you were on it or if you were just in the park, because like no attraction was more present than the people mover.

620
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:37,000
It's silently going by while you're in the line for star tours or in a shop or something.

621
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Now rocket rods are up and running and it's just, it's somewhere between fireworks and a leaf blower.

622
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,000
These were very industrial, unpleasant sounds.

623
00:40:50,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Watching a few like three or four different ride through videos, I wrote down the note of like these sounds are caustic.

624
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Like this is, I don't like, I don't like hearing this.

625
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:12,000
And I can't tell because there is some sound effects along the way where I'm like, oh, that's pumped in.

626
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:18,000
And then I'm like, how is some of these sounds I think are the requirement?

627
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Like this is the sound it makes to move.

628
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:27,000
If you were on it, there would be fake motor sounds and kind of bleep, bleep, bleep, bleep, bleep.

629
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:33,000
But if you, yeah, you know that they were real sounds because you would hear it so loud if you weren't on it.

630
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
So now you're in Tomorrowland. You're just walking around.

631
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
So what do we do next? I don't know.

632
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Maybe we head over to Dumbo.

633
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Just like so jar and which and the fact that we kind of like shake the tracks is so you're like you're in a war zone.

634
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Now Tomorrowland, this is, this is, this is a future in which a war is going on and like I assume these things are armed.

635
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:59,000
I assume there's cannons in the front. Yeah. Oh, but they don't work.

636
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:03,000
They don't work consistently for the opponent. They don't.

637
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Yeah. Is there anything?

638
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:10,000
What's the most annoying like sound a ride makes when you're not on?

639
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Like, is Autopia the answer to this?

640
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Like when you're like, I'm walking around to be here.

641
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
You're like, it's like kind of unpleasant.

642
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Is there something that beats that?

643
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Maybe depending on where you are when you're like on the universal tram or waiting for the universal.

644
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Just be given that it is like a, you know, actual heavy duty motor.

645
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Yeah, maybe.

646
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:36,000
You know, like a poorly kept up, you know, like a drop tower ride.

647
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Yeah, they do that like hiss and then the launch and then they don't really make a sound when you're bouncing down.

648
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:48,000
The Magic Mountain Superman ride sounds horrible.

649
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

650
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Well, but Magic Mountain in general.

651
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Yeah, that's a different category.

652
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,000
They aren't concerned with noise pollution.

653
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,000
You'll get all sorts of interesting noises in Magic Mountain.

654
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Yeah. Yeah.

655
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Yeah. Well, it's Magic Mountain is just a chorus of irritating hydraulics and then people go in like, fuck you.

656
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
He's screaming at a Tweety Bird.

657
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:14,000
He's screaming at his life size Tweety Bird.

658
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Fuck you. Birds aren't big.

659
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:23,000
He won the Tweety Bird and now he's spent all day cursing at it.

660
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
I'm going to pretend this is my mom.

661
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:31,000
I'm going to do this what I wish I could do to my mom.

662
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Well, Magic, well, we could do a whole Final Four of Magic Mountain.

663
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Unpleasant ride noises.

664
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
Yeah. Yeah. The worst. Yeah. Yeah.

665
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,000
The worst real sounds that I actually hear.

666
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,000
This is this is going to lead me to it to a Final Four thing.

667
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,000
I'm going to play here now that all the pieces are in place.

668
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Right. And we've said what they have.

669
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:56,000
And this this kind of shows you why they needed a new attraction, a thrilling attraction and why they could.

670
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:03,000
So that Disney could do kind of a like aiming at 11 year olds, almost Six Flags esque commercial.

671
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:07,000
Right. This is how they presented New Tomorrowland back in 98.

672
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:17,000
If you think the coke machine is cool, you can see the rest of the place.

673
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:20,000
If that was probably pretty indiscernible to a listener.

674
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,000
Yeah. But here's a whole other thing.

675
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
This. OK. Tomorrow. We got a new Tomorrowland.

676
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
What do we want to feature first?

677
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Well, we have a coke machine that shoots coke out from that launches it up into the air and then a cast member grabs it.

678
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Right. You guys know this was there.

679
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:40,000
No. Launching Cokes. I think they might still have this.

680
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Do you mean it works?

681
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:45,000
I mean, I saw a recent like like YouTube short showing one of these.

682
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,000
Really? I think you can launch your soda.

683
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:58,000
If you want to get your soda real shaken up, if you want to drop nine dollars on your soda and then lose half of it to bubbles bursting out.

684
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
How would that not have happened by now?

685
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
We got a soda launched at us or in the air.

686
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,000
I mean, like that.

687
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:07,000
I feel like we've I've had a soda in Tomorrowland a few times.

688
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Have you ever had a soda launched to you?

689
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
I don't think so.

690
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Well, it's not at you.

691
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,000
It's up in the air for the cast member to catch.

692
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Right. You watch a soda launch show.

693
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,000
This is one of their genuinely actually looking back now.

694
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,000
This might have been their biggest attraction in the most successful one.

695
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Yeah. Yeah.

696
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
It's a way if it remains listener.

697
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Have you seen the soda launch?

698
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Where can we find the soda?

699
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,000
Let's find the soda next time.

700
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,000
So it's like a rocket.

701
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,000
The Coke is a rocket.

702
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Yeah. Yeah.

703
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
So they do have rocket Cokes.

704
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,000
You got to give them that.

705
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Here's what else they have.

706
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Tomorrowland is now at Disneyland.

707
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:46,000
You can go 3D with honey and shrunky audience.

708
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Blast off on rocket ride.

709
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
A unique experience in speed.

710
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Wow. Exactly.

711
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
The new Tomorrowland is now at Disneyland.

712
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Windblown kids.

713
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Wow.

714
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
It is.

715
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,000
It's like a surge commercial.

716
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Or like, yeah, like you said, like a Six Flags commercial.

717
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,000
Yeah. They're going for extreme.

718
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
There's a little bit of fish on it.

719
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Yeah.

720
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,000
The on the rocket rides.

721
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Which shows you how much they're pushing it.

722
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:14,000
And like a honey and shrunk the audience is kind of secondary to that.

723
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
And here's what I wanted to bring up.

724
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,000
I had an idea and I was like, let me just workshop this on the show.

725
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Yeah.

726
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,000
See if you like it.

727
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,000
We didn't do a final four this year.

728
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,000
We were doing the saga or taking a break from the saga.

729
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,000
I had an idea for one and maybe this is obscure.

730
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Maybe there's a mini one on the second gate or something.

731
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
But here's my idea.

732
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
The frequent footage final four.

733
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:38,000
What this would be is a competition.

734
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:42,000
We all watch a lot of Disney specials and parades and ancillary material.

735
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:47,000
This would be the ultimate showdown of the footage that they show you all the time.

736
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
We're talking Walt pointing at the big map.

737
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Oh, right.

738
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
We're talking Walt's given opening day speech.

739
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,000
A lot of Walt.

740
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:58,000
We're talking Walt stepping on the train tracks and like pointing out where they're going to be.

741
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,000
We're talking Mickey on top of Spaceship Earth.

742
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:10,000
We're talking making it look like the big lion is coming out of the screen in honey and shrunk the audience.

743
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Fozzy with the big pie.

744
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:18,000
I don't know if anything comes to mind for you guys in terms of frequent footage.

745
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,000
Wouldn't we like to know what is the best frequent footage?

746
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:33,000
There must be a reused family reacting of mom, dad and 2.5 kids going like, oh, probably being startled by something pretty low key.

747
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Yeah, I think if we thought about it, I feel like there's also things where like in the foreground, there's like a fire eater and then it like zooms past the fire eater into whatever fun.

748
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Yeah.

749
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Or like Indiana Jones with the map and then he closes the map and then heads into the temple.

750
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Oh, I got a good one.

751
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Tower of Terror guests.

752
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
Oh, yeah.

753
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Standing.

754
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Terrifying a generation of neurotic children.

755
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Yes.

756
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Yeah.

757
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:04,000
And then like the arrow pointing to the floor is going haywire.

758
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,000
Yeah.

759
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:12,000
And the footage of like just the hydraulics, like just the mechanics of it and dropping way faster than the ride.

760
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,000
That's really good.

761
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
I feel like if we put our minds to it.

762
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
Well, let me I'm just throwing this to listen.

763
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:20,000
I'm not married to this idea, but I figured I'd workshop it here.

764
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:38,000
If you like that, if you want to hear the frequent footage final four or submit ideas for the frequent final four, because I think we have to know how far would Walt on the train with the stuffed Mickey waving it with his hand, like peering out Ronald Reagan.

765
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Yeah.

766
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:46,000
Like there's a lot of, you know, that's why I'm like maybe this is second gate because this is really like this is for this is this is like a fellow travelers kind of idea.

767
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
We all know.

768
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Yeah.

769
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:53,000
If you're listening and you know what I'm talking about, then you're as versed in it as we are.

770
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Footage of the parade with the big inflatables.

771
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,000
The big inflatable like when it was the Mardi Gras.

772
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
Yeah, the Mardi Gras kind of thing.

773
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,000
Yeah.

774
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
I'm sure if we put our minds to it, there's a lot.

775
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
It's gonna be very 90s tape heavy.

776
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Yeah.

777
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,000
This is when the media explode.

778
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
This is when it went from like we've made.

779
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:14,000
We made three Disney World specials through all of the 1970s.

780
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,000
Right.

781
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:19,000
We produce 300 hours every year.

782
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Yeah.

783
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Some of its parades on TV, some of its specials, some of its vacation planning VHS.

784
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Yeah.

785
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,000
Yeah.

786
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:34,000
You know, I don't know if this is frequent enough, but this footage that I really like from downtown Disney where there's a guy playing.

787
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:41,000
There's like a guy alone playing a saxophone on cobblestones and there's a Mickey spotlight that he's standing under.

788
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,000
I don't know.

789
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,000
I know.

790
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
I guess that's familiar.

791
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:48,000
I imagine Pleasure Island footage.

792
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,000
It's got to be.

793
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Specifically.

794
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,000
A bunch of fireworks going off.

795
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Yeah.

796
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Like helicopter shot.

797
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:56,000
There's probably like two parents dancing that they use.

798
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,000
Yeah, that's what I'm imagining.

799
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,000
Yeah.

800
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Dutch angles of the neon sign of each sign of each club.

801
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Definitely.

802
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,000
Yeah.

803
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,000
I think we'd get there.

804
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,000
And listeners, I really would.

805
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:21,000
If there's, if you've got one in your head and you know you've seen, there might even just be like the one shot of Rex like waving from, like there was, there's a lot of footage or the same audience all like swaying when you go into the Death Star.

806
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Yeah.

807
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,000
I think it's definitely an area.

808
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,000
Oh yeah.

809
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,000
Summit plummet.

810
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:32,000
Both in the two, like someone who all nervous in the tube and then outside of it with the water shoot.

811
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Yeah.

812
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Like you see the water spraying.

813
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:44,000
Similarly Splash Mountain, but the camera does a thing where, and Jurassic Park at the right, where it makes it look like there goes the thing and then it looks like it goes upside down.

814
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,000
Like the camera, the POV goes all the way the other way.

815
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
Also scaring neurotic children.

816
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
So, well, there we go.

817
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,000
Let us know feelings about that.

818
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Yeah, that's a good avenue.

819
00:50:54,000 --> 00:51:08,000
Anyways, and to bring up somebody who might factor into frequent footage Final Four, I was somewhat upset to discover the answer of who in the world wanted a faster people mover.

820
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:12,000
And I will now read this quote as a type a person.

821
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:19,000
I wanted something faster than the people mover quotes Michael Eisner CEO and chairman of the Walt Disney Company.

822
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,000
So this is one of those misguided.

823
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
This is why we need the time machine.

824
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:29,000
I guess it does drive to him because he, we know this.

825
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:34,000
We know that he was as CEOs are he's a Steve Jobs type.

826
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,000
I have a big idea.

827
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:42,000
I'm going to drop this into the room and then leave and then assume in three months that you figured out the very difficult to pull off idea.

828
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:53,000
I would say he, you know, was a more for good version of that than a lot of CEOs are and better ideas specifically within it than other CEOs that said this was not one of them.

829
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Although is well, hang on.

830
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
Well, that's what I think.

831
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,000
But we're going to make the same point.

832
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,000
Maybe like it doesn't have to be done this way.

833
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:10,000
That's it's the thought exercise because when you hear it a fast using those tracks for now a high speed ride is not the craziest thing in the world.

834
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
That kind of sounds good, right?

835
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
Yeah, I just track why I like it could.

836
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:17,000
It didn't have to be like they could have added to track like they could have.

837
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
There's other versions of it.

838
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:25,000
You potentially could have made work in a better way than than just dumping a fast thing on the existing track.

839
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,000
Yeah.

840
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:29,000
I know that's kind of what he was thinking, but which is giving him some credit.

841
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Yeah. Yeah.

842
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Well, that's what happens.

843
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:37,000
And maybe maybe it's worth going into the end of the history here a little bit.

844
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:48,000
So, yeah, the notion was not slow moving little tour on the people mover, something fast and thrilling and for the teens.

845
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:53,000
But it's also they start planning something.

846
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:56,000
It's not like maybe you found some of this, Jason.

847
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:02,000
This this all was information from the season pass podcast when they talked to Tony Baxter.

848
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:10,000
But I don't know that I really heard this, that the original pitch was something called fast track.

849
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:13,000
Fast track was the notion here.

850
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:17,000
And this was happening concurrently with test track.

851
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:22,000
And this is to be sponsored by General Motors, the very same sponsor.

852
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:25,000
So with a sponsor, you've got money.

853
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
They're already in it on this other thing.

854
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:31,000
The long working relationship thanks to World of Motion.

855
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:41,000
And this is where it gets frustrating is hearing Tony's description of what this could have been designed to be three times the budget they ended up getting.

856
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
Rocket Rides was a wire frame vehicle at night.

857
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
They were all to glow.

858
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,000
And one of them did.

859
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,000
We had one on the track and it looked so great.

860
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:53,000
It looked like a dimensional wire frame design come to life.

861
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
Tronish, I'm assuming.

862
00:53:55,000 --> 00:54:00,000
I bet Tronish and kind of predating that second version of test track.

863
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
And mainly communicate.

864
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
It was going to communicate something.

865
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:11,000
The idea that at least at night that you would understand that you're looking at a blueprint that came to life moving around.

866
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:16,000
Because as what ended up happening was it's just these like big weird clunkers.

867
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
They don't seem like anything.

868
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,000
But like, OK, that's something.

869
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:22,000
I see what this could have been.

870
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:26,000
Also, would you believe it was all this stuff?

871
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Guests would visit a design center where they would customize their vehicles and the attraction would capture a photo of them riding in their design.

872
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
It was going to affect the colors.

873
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:39,000
And now it would all all of that stuff, all the stuff the test track ended up doing in the second round.

874
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:42,000
Right. And it seems maybe I miss.

875
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:50,000
Remember, it was it supposed to be affecting the lights and the colors on the actual vehicles because test track does or did this.

876
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:55,000
And it was unspectacular because you would just get like kind of a mocked up photo of it at the end.

877
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,000
Yeah. Yeah.

878
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:59,000
But would this actually affect the exterior of the vehicle?

879
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
Because that's actually a really cool idea.

880
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:05,000
If you like, I want a purple vehicle and it's got orange stripes on it.

881
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:08,000
And then you would see that from the from like down.

882
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,000
I don't I don't know.

883
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:15,000
And if you have somebody, if your mom didn't go on it, she could see what your vehicle looked like.

884
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:18,000
She could take a photo that would not turn out well at all because it's night.

885
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,000
Right. Of course.

886
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:22,000
And with a lot of difference in light.

887
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
But you would see all the vehicles would be the very least.

888
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,000
You would see all the vehicles be different and unique that everyone.

889
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:32,000
And now we're in more backing over territory where the colors are different.

890
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,000
Yeah. Autopia.

891
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,000
Or here comes a red one.

892
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,000
Here comes that orange one.

893
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
Cool idea if that wasn't what they were planning.

894
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Maybe I don't know.

895
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,000
I don't have that.

896
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,000
There's not enough. Yeah.

897
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
I can't remember that because I heard this interview.

898
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,000
But we need to talk to him again.

899
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
But I mean, that's yeah, that sounds really great.

900
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:50,000
And now it's like, yeah, every guest shows it.

901
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:55,000
And now we're in the realm of Indiana Jones where you like the experience is customized

902
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
and a little bit different every time.

903
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,000
That's something.

904
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,000
That's pretty good.

905
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:02,000
But here's what happened across the country.

906
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,000
Test track.

907
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,000
We've talked about test track.

908
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
Test track was a big mess.

909
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,000
Right.

910
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
Like testing went very badly.

911
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
They delayed it a bunch of times.

912
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:16,000
And apparently General Motors was so worn down by this process that they're like,

913
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,000
you're on your own with that other one.

914
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,000
We're not doing another one.

915
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,000
Finish up this track.

916
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
And then that is the end of this.

917
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,000
So they pull out.

918
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:26,000
Now there is not money to make the vehicles glow.

919
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,000
Well, that's OK.

920
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,000
Right.

921
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,000
Because we'll still be able to make a cool high speed attraction.

922
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,000
Yeah. Well, about that.

923
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:38,000
And then here is the real killer that they can't bank the turns on this.

924
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:41,000
They have to use the literal same track.

925
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:45,000
This is a high speed roller coaster type ride with no banked turns.

926
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:52,000
And it kind of serves as a living illustration of why curves need to be banked.

927
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:55,000
Can we define banking?

928
00:56:55,000 --> 00:57:02,000
Because I kept seeing this and I couldn't quite picture what it meant in my head.

929
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:05,000
Like turning the track?

930
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,000
Yeah.

931
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
It's angling it.

932
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,000
Angling it.

933
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:16,000
And this was very helpful that Tony illustrated this in Credit to Season Pass again.

934
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:20,000
He says, we all knew the track needed to be banked in order to keep the speed up.

935
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:23,000
Once you made the reduction to go with the level of the people mover track,

936
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
so that never banks at any point.

937
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,000
That's just glad.

938
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:29,000
It had to slow down to take each curve.

939
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
That was to keep you from flying out.

940
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:35,000
Now that's a very interesting little physics lesson.

941
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:40,000
If the rocket rods didn't slow down,

942
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:47,000
like gravity would want to take the people just like out into the right.

943
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
I guess, yeah.

944
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,000
It's really weird.

945
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
It's interesting.

946
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,000
Okay, yeah.

947
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:58,000
So banked turns are in order to keep the speed going.

948
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:03,000
You can do just a straightaway fast, but then at some point you have to turn.

949
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,000
So that's the idea.

950
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:08,000
So they would have had to like, maybe they could have kept some of the infrastructure,

951
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
but at least the turns they had to.

952
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:13,000
And now if you start thinking about that track, it's all turns.

953
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
Yeah, constantly.

954
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,000
Constantly, yes.

955
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:20,000
It goes around the round building, Space Mountain.

956
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:23,000
It goes around the round building, the Carousel Theater.

957
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,000
Yeah.

958
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,000
Nothing but turns.

959
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:28,000
This thing is all turns, and it had to be slow.

960
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:32,000
The new high speed ride has to be slow way more often than it's fast.

961
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,000
That's why.

962
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:38,000
I would have been like, I guess you could just put the new vehicle on the track

963
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:42,000
and then just do the test track thing and build another section of it

964
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:46,000
that's new track to go fast at the end.

965
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,000
Oh, sure.

966
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,000
Yeah.

967
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,000
Oh, you do it like test track.

968
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,000
Yeah.

969
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,000
Right.

970
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:54,000
That at least you still get the people mover experience.

971
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
You don't have to put in a new track in that part.

972
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,000
That's true.

973
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:00,000
But then you can find, I don't know where it would go exactly.

974
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:04,000
You could still even keep it like a little tour as you go.

975
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,000
Right.

976
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:10,000
So you can actually enjoy seeing the star speeder in that room.

977
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:13,000
You can still do the projection tunnel.

978
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
And then at the end, you just get a big ...

979
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:18,000
Because that's all anybody ... I mean, this is going to be blasphemous,

980
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
but that's all anyone cares about in test track.

981
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,000
Let's be honest.

982
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,000
No.

983
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:25,000
People don't like demonstration to precision tires.

984
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,000
Some people like it.

985
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
I know they're going to be mad at me, but that's all I ever care.

986
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,000
Not Radiator Springs.

987
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,000
Not Radiator Springs.

988
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,000
Yes.

989
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,000
No.

990
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:35,000
That's a slow tour through Radiator Springs.

991
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,000
That's got a bunch of fun stuff.

992
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,000
Yeah.

993
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,000
And then you go fast at the end.

994
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,000
That's a good idea.

995
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Yeah.

996
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
They could rebuild the last chunk.

997
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:46,000
They could have rebuilt the last chunk of it, Mike, to do what you're saying.

998
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:50,000
I mean, they rebuilt the monorail track, God knows how many times.

999
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,000
Yeah.

1000
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,000
I don't know where it would go.

1001
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,000
I'd have to look at it.

1002
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:54,000
Yeah, I don't either.

1003
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,000
Maybe this will be part of my pitch for tomorrow.

1004
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
I don't know that they have rebuilt them.

1005
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:00,000
At least the layout has remained the same, the monorail track.

1006
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,000
Haven't they moved?

1007
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:05,000
I think they have tried to not move the monorail as often as possible.

1008
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,000
Yeah.

1009
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:10,000
I think actually, and I could be wrong about this, but in my head, the route that it takes

1010
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:14,000
through California Adventure and then back to where it lands, what used to be the hotel,

1011
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:18,000
I think they've kept it roughly the same because they want to not move.

1012
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:21,000
That's major heavy duty pylons.

1013
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:24,000
Yeah, that's tough.

1014
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:28,000
I mean, it's never, it hasn't shortened, right, around Autopians?

1015
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,000
I don't know.

1016
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
That big, long, that too long kind of-

1017
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:35,000
It takes a long, yeah, really like a helicopter landing or something.

1018
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:40,000
No, I think they've probably removed parts of it but then reinstalled it where it was,

1019
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,000
I think.

1020
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:42,000
You might be right.

1021
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:46,000
I actually, because I think that, yeah, park and downtown Disney changes have all sort

1022
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:51,000
of happened around the, they've tried to not blow up the monorail because that's a big

1023
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,000
expense.

1024
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:59,000
But it is interesting then, that idea, they couldn't have tried not to, I guess they did

1025
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:02,000
try to not change the people mover track.

1026
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,000
That's what they had to do.

1027
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
I don't think it changed at all.

1028
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:06,000
Yeah.

1029
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:10,000
It's a problem and it's still a problem.

1030
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:15,000
It's still there and I always thought like, you know, you always hear, oh, they can't

1031
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,000
just reopen the people mover.

1032
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
You can't reopen the people mover.

1033
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:24,000
I always thought it was because of OSHA regulations because there are parts in that first section

1034
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:28,000
where you can just kind of touch the walls and if they had left the people mover, it

1035
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:33,000
would have been grandfathered and I realize Rocket Rods did so much wear and tear on this

1036
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:34,000
track.

1037
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
Yeah, it really wore down-

1038
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:37,000
It destroyed it.

1039
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:38,000
Yeah.

1040
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,000
Yes.

1041
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:43,000
Because when you have the, and this is where it all, it just all emanates from that initial

1042
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:47,000
decision of let's try to do all this on the cheap, all of Tomorrowland and this attraction

1043
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:48,000
especially.

1044
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
Like, you know how we save money?

1045
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,000
We don't bank the turns.

1046
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,000
That's what we do.

1047
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:59,000
Well, it ends up costing the money in the long run because now it's a ride that has

1048
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:04,000
to slow down and then speed up again constantly and in kind of an erratic way.

1049
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:09,000
So there's parts of a track that we're not expecting to have like a, all right, now like

1050
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:15,000
really heavy cars are going to like and like maybe stall a little bit in this area.

1051
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:21,000
So thus like plasters starts falling down onto, I think there were situations like this

1052
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:25,000
where like pieces of that track were falling down on our nearest.

1053
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:26,000
Yeah.

1054
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:34,000
And it's not, it is like, it is old building, old infrastructure now is having like an

1055
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:37,000
earthquake every five minutes that it has not been prepared for.

1056
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
It's not been built for essentially.

1057
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
No reinforcements whatsoever.

1058
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,000
Right.

1059
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
Like I don't know if this thing's going to make it through an earthquake.

1060
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,000
You worried about that?

1061
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:49,000
Not only that, we're going to do our own earthquakes here all day, every day.

1062
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:50,000
Yeah.

1063
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:54,000
Every few minutes, not even every few hours, every few minutes.

1064
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:58,000
Ten earthquakes and it will be as loud and annoying as earthquakes are.

1065
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:05,000
This is again, this is contradictions because it's like every now and then, like when you

1066
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:10,000
said, the CEO comes in, droughts a big idea and you figure it out.

1067
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:13,000
That sometimes ends up with something interesting.

1068
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:14,000
Sure.

1069
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:18,000
Or like working within restrictions ends up with something interesting.

1070
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:24,000
But there's so many confusing parts of this of like, oh, Euro Disney, you know, it ate

1071
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
up all our money.

1072
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
So it severely restricted the budget for this.

1073
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:33,000
Well, okay, we're going to do this tomorrow land like the one at Euro Disney.

1074
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
Well, wait, wasn't it?

1075
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:36,000
That's a contract.

1076
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
You just said it lost a bunch of money.

1077
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:44,000
Well, this was an ecstatic victory, though, but you mostly are going to have the money

1078
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,000
for paint.

1079
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:46,000
Yeah.

1080
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,000
The money's got to go to pit.

1081
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:48,000
What are we going to do?

1082
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:49,000
What are we supposed to do?

1083
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,000
Not paint Space Mountain Brown.

1084
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:53,000
The audience has been loud and clear on this.

1085
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:54,000
They want Space Mountain Brown.

1086
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,000
Yeah.

1087
01:03:55,000 --> 01:04:00,000
They don't care if the ride, they'll be fine with a ride that slows down all the time.

1088
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:04,000
Where if you watch that ad that I played earlier, that's something I didn't say about is that

1089
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
like, you know, rev up on the all new Ragged Rides.

1090
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:10,000
And then it like it's you watch that initial launch, which is exciting.

1091
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:11,000
And it's funny.

1092
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:12,000
When do they cut?

1093
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:15,000
When do they cut away from the excited teens?

1094
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:19,000
Maybe exactly where the curve and and that's true in all of it.

1095
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:24,000
If you watch like press footage, they did like a CD-ROM press kit and all of the footage

1096
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:29,000
ends precisely at the point where it does the very first curve, thus indicating that

1097
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
this is not a truly high speed ride.

1098
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:36,000
It also starts by doing kind of an odd looking wheelie.

1099
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:40,000
I guess in theory it's a wheelie, but it's such an odd looking thing.

1100
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:43,000
It's like, oh, is it supposed to be doing that?

1101
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
Is it wheelie or is it problem?

1102
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
Is it unbuckling at the top?

1103
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
Is it starting to come loose?

1104
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
Is it going to flip over all the way?

1105
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:52,000
Right.

1106
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:56,000
No, initially it did wheelies because that's what like maybe we need to pick up at the

1107
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,000
premise.

1108
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:58,000
What is a rocket?

1109
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
What does this phrase mean?

1110
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:03,000
Because they're kind of, once it's up and around, they're like, it's like a race car

1111
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:07,000
of the future and Mario Andretti is going to ride in it when we open it.

1112
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:10,000
So it's a race car and that's why it does a wheelie.

1113
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:15,000
So in the future, you will be in future race cars that will get you.

1114
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
But then what's a rod?

1115
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
How much did that cost?

1116
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
How much did it cost?

1117
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
Rod is what they're going for.

1118
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:24,000
Yeah, I guess.

1119
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,000
I assume.

1120
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:26,000
Okay.

1121
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,000
Rocket rod.

1122
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:30,000
But how is this a viable public transportation solution?

1123
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,000
How are we all going to be?

1124
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:36,000
It takes a lot of muster to ride in a super fast race car.

1125
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:37,000
How do you like this?

1126
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:41,000
This can't be how we get down to the civic center.

1127
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
Yeah, no, we can't.

1128
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
It doesn't even look cool.

1129
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:53,000
Even if it was unrealistic, as we said earlier, it's both not practical and uncool and too

1130
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:54,000
loud and too loud.

1131
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:59,000
Like it should be if it's a rocket rod, it should look like the neutrinos and Ninja Turtles

1132
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:02,000
car, which is like a flying hot rod car.

1133
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
I don't know if you guys remember this.

1134
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:05,000
They had a toy to the villains.

1135
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:10,000
Actually, it was a villainous toy, but it was like a it was like a old car and then the

1136
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:16,000
wheels would like fold up into it and fly like that's like a cool space hot rod or

1137
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
something that you would want to go on this.

1138
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:23,000
It doesn't look like a rocket rod because I think you would know if it was like an old

1139
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:27,000
time car that could fly, you would know exactly what a rocket rod is and what it was supposed

1140
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:28,000
to be.

1141
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,000
Wait a minute.

1142
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:30,000
I'm remembering something.

1143
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:34,000
There is another history and maybe that's what this is, but there's probably some other

1144
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:35,000
episode.

1145
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:38,000
Maybe like Unbuilt Tomorrowlands is kind of the idea here.

1146
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:43,000
But I believe in Tokyo, there was something that is much closer to what you're describing

1147
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:46,000
where there's still like kind of a 50s thing, right?

1148
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,000
50s but future.

1149
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:50,000
I think and maybe this was rocket bikes.

1150
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:51,000
I don't know.

1151
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:54,000
I think Tokyo had something that's pretty close to what you're saying.

1152
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:55,000
Interesting.

1153
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
Where like it's fun now.

1154
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:58,000
Well, you know where we are.

1155
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:01,000
We're in the Dexter Jetstar area.

1156
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:02,000
I didn't say it.

1157
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:03,000
I didn't say it.

1158
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:04,000
But I thought it.

1159
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:05,000
Yeah.

1160
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:06,000
Yeah.

1161
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:07,000
My man.

1162
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:08,000
Am I right about it?

1163
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
I'll try to figure out Rocket Bikes Tokyo.

1164
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,000
But that's the name.

1165
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:16,000
That's like the name is bad name because it doesn't it's not showing you what the name

1166
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:17,000
is.

1167
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:18,000
Like you're right.

1168
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:22,000
Rock Rod is like you have to represent 60s.

1169
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:23,000
Right.

1170
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:27,000
You got to represent whatever the song shut down by the Beach Boys was about.

1171
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
But there's no 60s to it.

1172
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:30,000
Yeah.

1173
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:33,000
It's just a big clunky thing where you really see that engine.

1174
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:36,000
By the way, it's just like you really that's a very present.

1175
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
Just make it makes it so industrial.

1176
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,000
But like yeah.

1177
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:42,000
And other things you're like where do they hide the mechanism on this thing?

1178
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:43,000
Like you see it.

1179
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:44,000
You really see it.

1180
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
It looks like a go kart.

1181
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:47,000
If it explodes.

1182
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:48,000
Yeah.

1183
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:52,000
Sometimes you see the service vehicle on the monorail track at Disneyland.

1184
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,000
Yes.

1185
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:58,000
Which looks like almost like the hobo car on a train track to some degree.

1186
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:03,000
But this looks like a service vehicle more than it does an actual ride vehicle to me.

1187
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
It's like a thing that would push a train that's broken.

1188
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:06,000
Yeah.

1189
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,000
Right.

1190
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:10,000
Send a rocket right out to fix a people mover.

1191
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:11,000
Yeah.

1192
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:12,000
That's just the way it doesn't.

1193
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:13,000
It doesn't convey fun to me.

1194
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:21,000
It looks like some sort of completely functional vehicle like just perfunctory vehicle that just like sends a maintenance worker out.

1195
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:27,000
I was correct that there were there was Tomorrowland was going to become or at least part of it was going to become sci fi city.

1196
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:32,000
And there were going to be and it looks like flying kind of hot rod things.

1197
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:33,000
Interesting.

1198
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:34,000
This is good.

1199
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
I mean maybe you know maybe that's the other episode.

1200
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:37,000
It's right unbuilt.

1201
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
But that might group enough together.

1202
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:46,000
But as for the one that was built and built on a budget, something we haven't talked about is the queue.

1203
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
And I have very strong memories of the queue.

1204
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:49,000
Did I say that I did this?

1205
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:50,000
Yeah.

1206
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,000
Yeah.

1207
01:08:51,000 --> 01:09:07,000
And another thing that hasn't been said is that as far as those blank areas in the non locks and Tomorrowland circle vision theater was one of them.

1208
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:11,000
And a circle vision became the line for this.

1209
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:14,000
It became the queue for rocket rods.

1210
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
So a former attraction is now a line.

1211
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:25,000
I was thinking like when I started looking up videos and like posts and stuff, I was like, man, what was the queue for that?

1212
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:28,000
I've never quite understood it because I know you entered at Buzz Lightyear.

1213
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:38,000
But where did you get the answer was anywhere Buzz Lightyear is end up in a circle vision and then go through a tunnel to then go upstairs.

1214
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:39,000
That is correct.

1215
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:45,000
Yeah. So the door that you still would use for Buzz Lightyear, that was like the same thing.

1216
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:48,000
That was the pre show of circle vision.

1217
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:54,000
Circle vision became after this, it became the bulk of the Buzz Lightyear ride.

1218
01:09:54,000 --> 01:10:06,000
And then, yeah, then you would have to like go through a very dark and claustrophobic tunnel that would get you down to the bottom of that tower to get you to the loading area.

1219
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:11,000
So instead of because you used to have remember it's still that way in Disney World that it's those little speed ramps.

1220
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:14,000
You go up a nice little ramp and now I'm instead you got to go under it.

1221
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
Now I'm under the earth.

1222
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:19,000
And I remember being in there and like that's what they figured out.

1223
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
This is so weird.

1224
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:32,000
And by the time that you're at that point, the narrowest area with the least entertainment, you have probably been in this room for at least an hour.

1225
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:35,000
This was a punishing line.

1226
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:36,000
This was crazy.

1227
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
Maybe 90, maybe two hours.

1228
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:43,000
There is a great video online and I started watching it and I was like, what account is this?

1229
01:10:44,000 --> 01:11:09,000
And then I started laughing because the answer was a longtime theme park designer, David Cobb, had he he is YouTube is calling like an archive because he just digitizes like his like videos and just put up like 30, 40 minutes of going around the islands of adventure construction areas.

1230
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:12,000
When he was working on Men in Black, Alien Attack.

1231
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:17,000
And you ran, I believe, as I recall, you rented out a theater to to watch that.

1232
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:20,000
Well, now there's this cinemadome is empty right now.

1233
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:23,000
You know, there's some real cinema here.

1234
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
But Cobb's old movies.

1235
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:28,000
He records the queue.

1236
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:33,000
He's with someone and they're in the Circle vision.

1237
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:36,000
And I believe it's person he's with goes.

1238
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:39,000
We've been in line for about two hours now.

1239
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:48,000
We've seen this Circle vision movie about three times because it is such a weird looking room.

1240
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:52,000
They were only using all of the screens occasionally.

1241
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:59,000
And the main cue part is so it looks so cheap.

1242
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:00,000
It's so dark.

1243
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:01,000
Yeah.

1244
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:08,000
And they're playing old Disney like Walt stuff or old Tomorrowland footage.

1245
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
That's fine.

1246
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
But then there's old ride vehicles.

1247
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:15,000
They paint it wireframes over.

1248
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:18,000
It's just well, that's yeah, that's where that idea came in.

1249
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:22,000
And also Tony Baxter's notion of could we use the old vehicles in some way?

1250
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:28,000
So, you know, you have a couple of things you have like here's literal blueprints.

1251
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:33,000
You're almost supposed to be in the Imagineering Lab or they're dreaming of new futuristic.

1252
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:36,000
So you've got like here's blueprints for a Space Mountain sled.

1253
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:37,000
That's what they're called.

1254
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:38,000
Never knew that.

1255
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:42,000
The Nautilus submarine, the Mark III monorail and then a rocket rod.

1256
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:50,000
Then you've got actual big vehicles like a monorail or a rocket jet or a submarine.

1257
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:51,000
But they're all there.

1258
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:54,000
Now they are painted like living blueprints.

1259
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:58,000
So mostly blue and then with like orange electrical tape.

1260
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:05,000
And by Tony's own admission, this thing was so bootstrapped that it was like him doing it.

1261
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:09,000
And all the other guys were like, we got to turn this into something.

1262
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:12,000
We can't just like open this up and it's an empty room.

1263
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
All right, everybody put some tape on this thing.

1264
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
So it's like it's Tony hand making.

1265
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:17,000
Yeah, yeah.

1266
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
It's so sad that it came to that.

1267
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:20,000
But he tried.

1268
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:21,000
He tried for us.

1269
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:22,000
He did try.

1270
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:25,000
It is an interesting experiment.

1271
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:33,000
There is also at some point there is like a board that says future expansions, like future stations.

1272
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:42,000
And it has both Angel Stadium and the hockey arena listed as a future station.

1273
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,000
It's really confused.

1274
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
This piece, this I like a lot actually.

1275
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:51,000
I mean, I'd buy like a poster of this that shows you all the places where the rocket rods might go.

1276
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:56,000
Right now, you're in the central terminal, but it might go to Innoventions someday.

1277
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:57,000
Oh good.

1278
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:00,000
It might go to, what's that?

1279
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,000
Might.

1280
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:02,000
Might, maybe, maybe.

1281
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:06,000
It might go to Disney's California Adventure before it opened.

1282
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
This I kind of like that it's like a nod.

1283
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
And there's little symbols representing these things.

1284
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:13,000
And California Adventure is represented by an orange.

1285
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
That's cute.

1286
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:18,000
The orange was the symbol of the park.

1287
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
I like the big orange.

1288
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
We haven't done an episode about the big orange.

1289
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:23,000
We know you like the big.

1290
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,000
He's talking about the big orange.

1291
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:25,000
Yeah, I like the big orange.

1292
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:26,000
There was some point.

1293
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:27,000
You wish it was there instead.

1294
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:35,000
There was some point in like 2015, 2016 or so where I was like, should I go back to the big orange?

1295
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:38,000
And I was like, oh, it's gone.

1296
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
You thought for a second the orange was there?

1297
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:41,000
For a second I thought the orange was there.

1298
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:45,000
And I'm like, well, Silly Symphony Swings is a better experience.

1299
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
But I'm like, kind of like the big orange.

1300
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:50,000
Is that where you sometimes like you had like a dream where you were in high school again.

1301
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
You wake up and you go, oh, my test is.

1302
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:53,000
Oh, I'm not in high school anymore.

1303
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
You forgot the big orange.

1304
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
Yeah, but it was a waking dream.

1305
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:58,000
Oh, OK.

1306
01:14:58,000 --> 01:14:59,000
I was like, did they take away the big orange?

1307
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:00,000
I see.

1308
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
Did they take away the Malibu?

1309
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:03,000
Oh, they did.

1310
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:04,000
Yeah.

1311
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
And then a single tear rolled down your cheek.

1312
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:07,000
Single.

1313
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:08,000
Yeah.

1314
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:09,000
A poor one out for the Malibu.

1315
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:13,000
Some of they'll be like, Jason, you're going to a better place.

1316
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
It's a place that still has the big orange.

1317
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:18,000
You'll see as many big oranges as you'd ever want.

1318
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:28,000
But the queue, the wire frame, you could kind of see that it's like, well, they were trying something.

1319
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:29,000
They tried.

1320
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:30,000
They tried to make this something.

1321
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:33,000
Even like you could tell it's like, what is it now?

1322
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:34,000
All right.

1323
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
It's like we're experimenting with a mass transit.

1324
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:37,000
Come on.

1325
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:38,000
Is that anything?

1326
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:39,000
Maybe that's something.

1327
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:40,000
It'll take you to the beach.

1328
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
You'll go to the beach on a rocket rod.

1329
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:43,000
Rocket rod.

1330
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:47,000
What a beautiful Los Angeles where you take a, you ruin everyone's time.

1331
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:53,000
But when a rocket rod pulls up, kicks up a bunch of sand.

1332
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:56,000
Gasoline on your shoes somehow.

1333
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
Scares a bunch of seagulls.

1334
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:01,000
They all shit and fear onto families.

1335
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:06,000
If it doesn't bank, it shoots a lot of the humans out of the vehicle.

1336
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:09,000
It throws them from the vehicle.

1337
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:10,000
What a wonderful piece of technology.

1338
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:15,000
Experience Los Angeles by getting tossed onto its curbs.

1339
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:20,000
There is, okay, it's not the exact, we were talking about the repeated footage,

1340
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:25,000
but there is a lot of the genre of people just off the ride going home.

1341
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:26,000
It's great.

1342
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:27,000
You go so fast.

1343
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
Oh, I loved it.

1344
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
You know, that is a certain type.

1345
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
That could be its own Final Four.

1346
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:36,000
It's just people going like, this was a trip.

1347
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
Oh, I had such a good time.

1348
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:39,000
Best reactions.

1349
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:40,000
Yeah.

1350
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:41,000
Or just saying the name.

1351
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:42,000
Rocket rods!

1352
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:43,000
Rocket rods!

1353
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:44,000
You don't have anything to say.

1354
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:45,000
Can you just yell rocket rods?

1355
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:50,000
Can all ten of you teens yell, when you're done clowning around,

1356
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:54,000
just yell rocket rods and we'll just keep rolling and do whatever after that.

1357
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:58,000
We'll never be done clowning around, bitch.

1358
01:16:58,000 --> 01:16:59,000
Okay.

1359
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:00,000
All right.

1360
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:03,000
Well, here's your ticket for free Coke and you can go on your way.

1361
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:04,000
I'm so sorry.

1362
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
Hey, give me five more.

1363
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:07,000
Okay.

1364
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,000
Here's six.

1365
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
You didn't do what I told you.

1366
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:14,000
You're going to die.

1367
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:17,000
But so, yeah, it is really weird.

1368
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,000
It's a, you know, we got some stuff.

1369
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:20,000
They're using like old.

1370
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:23,000
They've showed some of the Timekeeper movie in the Circle Vision.

1371
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:24,000
They're keeping you entertained.

1372
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:28,000
We gave you 20 minutes of footage that will loop seven times.

1373
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:31,000
And then you go through a very dark tunnel.

1374
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:34,000
I don't remember the handicapped access situation here.

1375
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:35,000
It's so weird.

1376
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:38,000
And if you were claustrophobic, this was a lot of problems.

1377
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:39,000
A lot of problems.

1378
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:43,000
Also, it seemed like people were just kind of ambling about

1379
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:46,000
or sitting on the floor of that Circle Vision.

1380
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
Like it seemed like.

1381
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:49,000
Yeah, probably.

1382
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,000
It seemed like in movies, you know,

1383
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:54,000
it seemed like in a Jurassic World or American Godzilla

1384
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:58,000
where everyone's just kind of shaking off what just happened.

1385
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:02,000
And like the National Guard is trying to usher people.

1386
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
Everyone's in the solar blankets.

1387
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,000
Yeah, everyone's got solar blankets on.

1388
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:08,000
Central casting member.

1389
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:11,000
It's like they have the Band-Aid on their head.

1390
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:14,000
And they're trying to make a meal of, oh.

1391
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:16,000
Can somebody do balloon animals?

1392
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:19,000
Can we cheer up people in here?

1393
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
Yeah, yeah, that's the vibe.

1394
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:25,000
No, people needed therapy after making it through this line.

1395
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:28,000
But yeah, the buildup was like insane.

1396
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
You're just like, boy, is this going to be.

1397
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:33,000
And then it's a little hard to talk about this ride experience.

1398
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:34,000
We've alluded to it.

1399
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:37,000
But yeah, you know, you if you're there in the first two months,

1400
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:41,000
you get a fun, fast launch with a confusing wheelie.

1401
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:44,000
And then you slow down right away and you go into star tours.

1402
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:49,000
And then it is just like speed, not speed, speed, not speed.

1403
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
But then you get into like, you know,

1404
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:56,000
imagine now you're in like utopia area where you're a little more free.

1405
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:59,000
And here's what I remember is that like, all right, we're not.

1406
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
We're not curving as much here.

1407
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:05,000
We're getting some straightaway like that area and it's open.

1408
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:06,000
And you're not just in weird.

1409
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
You watch those ride throughs and you're really like, this is just.

1410
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:11,000
This is like a industrial hallway.

1411
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
This is like see cracks in the.

1412
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:14,000
And then you're like, well,

1413
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
wouldn't have been cool if they had like kept that tron tunnel.

1414
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
And then you're going super speed through the trunk.

1415
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
No, no, took that out.

1416
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:21,000
That's gone. No more of that.

1417
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:25,000
In fact, sometimes you can just look into an active construction site.

1418
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:26,000
Yeah.

1419
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
Because this open before all.

1420
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
Well, I was going to say all of intervention.

1421
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:36,000
Like there's footage of people going through what will become interventions,

1422
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:37,000
but it wasn't ready yet.

1423
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
Oh, so it's just work lights.

1424
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
Half on my God.

1425
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:45,000
And there was, there was something.

1426
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:46,000
Did you catch them?

1427
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:50,000
You might, you saw it in person, the mirror at early on.

1428
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:54,000
There's a moment where.

1429
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:59,000
When it would look into one of the buildings where they just put in a giant mirror.

1430
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
So it looked like you're about to hit another,

1431
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:05,000
that trick where it looks like another car is coming at you.

1432
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,000
But then you start to slow down.

1433
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,000
So the effect doesn't really work.

1434
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:10,000
You know,

1435
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:11,000
God,

1436
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:14,000
how did imagine the morale?

1437
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
Imagine being Tony and you know,

1438
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
this has come to pass and you're like,

1439
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
yeah, we lost that one and we know,

1440
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:23,000
and they knew they knew this was not going to be,

1441
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:24,000
there's people,

1442
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:25,000
like there's bean counters going,

1443
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:26,000
it's going to be fine.

1444
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:27,000
It's actually,

1445
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:28,000
it's a little bit different.

1446
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:31,000
It's kind of predictable that a roller coaster would just go faster and faster.

1447
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:32,000
The longer you were on it.

1448
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:33,000
This,

1449
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:34,000
this is a crazy,

1450
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:35,000
you know,

1451
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:36,000
this,

1452
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:37,000
this is a loose cannon ride.

1453
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:38,000
We don't know what's going to happen.

1454
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:44,000
I almost think it would have been cheaper to redo this Tomorrowland with a scaled down

1455
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
Tomorrowland 94 theme.

1456
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:47,000
Sure.

1457
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:48,000
Yeah.

1458
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:49,000
Just repeat some stuff,

1459
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:50,000
repeat some elements.

1460
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:51,000
Yeah,

1461
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:52,000
sure.

1462
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:57,000
That's why the people mover technically is different in Florida.

1463
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:00,000
So they wouldn't have been able to clone that.

1464
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:04,000
Like they wouldn't have been able to just change the ride vehicles.

1465
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:05,000
Just keep the old ones then.

1466
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:06,000
Just keep the old,

1467
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:11,000
because if they had left Tomorrowland alone,

1468
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:16,000
that white mid-century aesthetic would have come into fashion again.

1469
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:17,000
Yep.

1470
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:21,000
And they would have been able to milk the nostalgia bucks.

1471
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:22,000
It still looked a little,

1472
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:23,000
it wouldn't look,

1473
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,000
it would look old though.

1474
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
The way that it looked back then.

1475
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:28,000
It was very,

1476
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
it was very eighties and I'm fond of it.

1477
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
And they've kept the elements that still work,

1478
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:33,000
like the neon Mickey's,

1479
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,000
but it was kind of a hodgepodge.

1480
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,000
But then they just put in a new hodgepodge.

1481
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:38,000
It still has that rocket.

1482
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:39,000
Yeah.

1483
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:40,000
I'm not saying it's good.

1484
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:41,000
I'm just saying the aesthetic,

1485
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:42,000
even if you look at the old photos,

1486
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:43,000
I'm like,

1487
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:44,000
it's still,

1488
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:45,000
the aesthetic has come back around.

1489
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
It just looks old.

1490
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
It would look old now.

1491
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:50,000
I'm not saying it's better or worse.

1492
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:51,000
I'm just saying,

1493
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:52,000
I don't know if they could have done nothing

1494
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:53,000
and it would still have,

1495
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
I mean, I guess maybe it would be right.

1496
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:56,000
It would have been better,

1497
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:57,000
but it would still feel old.

1498
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
It would still feel tired.

1499
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
They've tried to change Tomorrowland in Florida

1500
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:02,000
where it's like,

1501
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
oh, let's replace that busy sign

1502
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
with more minimalist sign.

1503
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:07,000
Yeah.

1504
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:10,000
Let's take out some of the neon green and purple

1505
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
and some of the fins.

1506
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:13,000
And I'm like,

1507
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:16,000
I think it looks chintzy or like,

1508
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
why did you take that all out?

1509
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:19,000
Yeah.

1510
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:20,000
Yeah.

1511
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:21,000
They really can't,

1512
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:22,000
I mean, what they're aiming for now

1513
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:23,000
is neither here nor there.

1514
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:24,000
They just, yeah,

1515
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
they need to like really pick a new aesthetic

1516
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:27,000
to all this and stick to it.

1517
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:28,000
Yeah.

1518
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:29,000
Here's,

1519
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:30,000
let me get to this though,

1520
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:31,000
is that at the end,

1521
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:32,000
you know,

1522
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
there's kind of like a pure tunnel that's,

1523
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:35,000
you know,

1524
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,000
like the Matterhorn is on the right of you

1525
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:40,000
and you're kind of up above the queue of the rocket rods.

1526
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
And at this point,

1527
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
you actually do pick up some speed.

1528
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
You are going pretty straight.

1529
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
You get hit with a strobe light

1530
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:49,000
and a blast of air.

1531
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:52,000
And that's one of the last things that happens.

1532
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
And I don't know,

1533
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:55,000
I was 13.

1534
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,000
I was not a thrilled junkie

1535
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:58,000
and I'm still not now.

1536
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
But around that point,

1537
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:01,000
I was like,

1538
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:02,000
it's actually kind of all right.

1539
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:03,000
You know what?

1540
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:04,000
That little part,

1541
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
I didn't expect the hit of air.

1542
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:07,000
I didn't expect the,

1543
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,000
and then you get one more little straight away

1544
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:10,000
before you finish it out.

1545
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:11,000
It like,

1546
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:12,000
it actually,

1547
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:13,000
I think it closed with its best stuff,

1548
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,000
which still sounds very chintzy.

1549
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:16,000
I'm still,

1550
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:17,000
I'm describing like haunted house stuff.

1551
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:18,000
Right.

1552
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:19,000
But it was at least,

1553
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
it was like a little bit of a jump at the end.

1554
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:22,000
My,

1555
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:23,000
I've alluded to this like,

1556
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,000
this might be an insane opinion.

1557
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:26,000
I mean,

1558
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
I'll at least land at this.

1559
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:31,000
I liked it enough to not call it the worst ride they ever did.

1560
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
Still in your memory.

1561
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:34,000
Yeah.

1562
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:35,000
Yeah.

1563
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:36,000
And I don't,

1564
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:37,000
now I can't,

1565
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:38,000
I'm not fully qualified to say,

1566
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:39,000
I didn't go on superstar limo.

1567
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:42,000
I,

1568
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:43,000
I don't know.

1569
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,000
I got enough of a little charge out of it

1570
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:46,000
that even with all of this,

1571
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:47,000
I was kind of,

1572
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:48,000
I,

1573
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:49,000
at the time I was kind of like,

1574
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:50,000
rock n' roll is not so bad.

1575
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:51,000
Yeah.

1576
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:52,000
Well,

1577
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:53,000
I can't,

1578
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:54,000
cause I didn't go on it.

1579
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:55,000
So I'll never fully know,

1580
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:59,000
but it's a lot of the stuff surrounding the building of this

1581
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:02,000
and the failure of Tomorrowland at this time

1582
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:05,000
does get attached to the rocket rods as well.

1583
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:06,000
Yeah.

1584
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:07,000
Well,

1585
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:08,000
it's like,

1586
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:09,000
it's the nerve center of the entire thing.

1587
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:10,000
Yeah.

1588
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:11,000
And the nerve center shut down.

1589
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,000
And the fact that the track is just sitting there

1590
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:14,000
makes it worse.

1591
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:15,000
And like,

1592
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:18,000
now if that had been just like track ripped out

1593
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:19,000
or in,

1594
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:20,000
or they just replaced it with something,

1595
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:21,000
maybe it would be like,

1596
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:22,000
oh yeah,

1597
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:23,000
rocket rods.

1598
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,000
But rocket rods now has such a connotation to

1599
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:28,000
the epic failure of Disneyland.

1600
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:31,000
When obviously like there were more unpleasant rides,

1601
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:34,000
the flying saucers famously didn't work.

1602
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:38,000
Stuff that I'm sure was less fun to actually go on

1603
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
than rocket rods,

1604
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
which might've been a bit frustrating because of the bank,

1605
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
the slowdowns.

1606
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:45,000
Yeah.

1607
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:48,000
But of course going faster on Tomorrowland

1608
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,000
to some degree would be fun.

1609
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:50,000
Yeah.

1610
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:51,000
There's at least some fast.

1611
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:52,000
Yeah.

1612
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:53,000
Some fast happen.

1613
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:54,000
I mean,

1614
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:55,000
to me,

1615
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:56,000
no question,

1616
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:57,000
no question,

1617
01:24:57,000 --> 01:25:00,000
rocket rods better than current journey into imagination.

1618
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:01,000
Oh, interesting.

1619
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,000
I'm declaring that for my personal taste.

1620
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:04,000
Well, like that's another thing though,

1621
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:07,000
cause what came before was so much better.

1622
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:11,000
It's hard not to compare it and really hate the new version

1623
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,000
or dislike a lot of the things in the new version.

1624
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:14,000
I think though,

1625
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
that even if I didn't know the original,

1626
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
maybe even more so like,

1627
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:19,000
okay, what is this?

1628
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:20,000
I know nothing.

1629
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:21,000
It's called journey into imagination.

1630
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:22,000
Yeah.

1631
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:25,000
And a shrill dragon looks like a skunk

1632
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,000
and then it has a buzzer.

1633
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:28,000
I'll say this.

1634
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
I've never been on rocket rods,

1635
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:34,000
but it's better than mission space.

1636
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:36,000
Ooh.

1637
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:37,000
People are going to be mad about that,

1638
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:38,000
but that's,

1639
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
I really don't like mission space.

1640
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:41,000
You're not,

1641
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,000
my opinion wouldn't be far from you,

1642
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:46,000
but I would notch mission space up

1643
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:49,000
because like better place making,

1644
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:50,000
better videos,

1645
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:54,000
Gary Sinise despite my issues with Gary Sinise

1646
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
and grappling over the daddy award.

1647
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:57,000
I still,

1648
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,000
there's enough like production.

1649
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:00,000
That's all,

1650
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
you're right about all that,

1651
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
but I find the actual ride so unpleasant

1652
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:07,000
that I bet I would say,

1653
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,000
I would rather go on rocket rods than mission space.

1654
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:10,000
Yeah.

1655
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:11,000
You're right.

1656
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:12,000
The building is cool

1657
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
and all that stuff surrounding it is cool,

1658
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:17,000
but the actual ride itself,

1659
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,000
I'm sure it was way more fun.

1660
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,000
Is your choice mission space,

1661
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:22,000
you think of worse,

1662
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:23,000
at least Disney?

1663
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,000
I think so.

1664
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:26,000
Yeah.

1665
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:27,000
I think so.

1666
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:28,000
I just,

1667
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:29,000
especially doing the hard,

1668
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,000
the one that's tougher on your brain,

1669
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:34,000
I just like left it like disoriented

1670
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
and like claustrophobic.

1671
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:37,000
Yeah.

1672
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:38,000
I think I might still go,

1673
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
unless there's something I'm forgetting,

1674
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:41,000
I might go current journey.

1675
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:42,000
Jason, you got a thought?

1676
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
I don't know.

1677
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:45,000
Yeah.

1678
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:48,000
I'm trying to think on this.

1679
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:51,000
Mission space is a good one.

1680
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,000
Rocket rods is just so much.

1681
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:58,000
I keep thinking about how they took out a people eater,

1682
01:26:58,000 --> 01:26:59,000
the people mover,

1683
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,000
like people mover was a people eater.

1684
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:02,000
Yes.

1685
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:03,000
It was people eater

1686
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:08,000
and it just never had too long of a weight.

1687
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
Florida has a little bit of a long weight

1688
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
occasionally nowadays,

1689
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:15,000
but it feels like people mover

1690
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,000
never had too long of a weight

1691
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:24,000
and it also added a huge line attraction.

1692
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
Like it added a huge weight.

1693
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:27,000
Yeah.

1694
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:28,000
That's all true.

1695
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:31,000
The effect you do not want operationally.

1696
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:34,000
But pure fun of the experience.

1697
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
Because what I'm saying is I'm shocked

1698
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
and as much as I wanted to like get into

1699
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:42,000
the confusing and irritating history of this thing,

1700
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
and the line was horrible,

1701
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
the line was awful to be in,

1702
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
but I came out of it still a little bit

1703
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:52,000
like notching this right up higher than I thought that I would.

1704
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:55,000
So I'm like in terms of things you've been on,

1705
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,000
just like the experience itself,

1706
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,000
forget any context,

1707
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,000
do you have a knee-jerk of like,

1708
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,000
man, I hate being on this.

1709
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:07,000
It would be cool to race around the railroad track at Disneyland.

1710
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:08,000
It would be cool.

1711
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
It would be cool, especially at night.

1712
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:11,000
Yes. Yeah.

1713
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,000
If they were like, oh yeah, by the way,

1714
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:16,000
now you go like 50 miles an hour around the train tracks at Disneyland.

1715
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
I go, I'm interested in doing that.

1716
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:19,000
Yeah, yeah.

1717
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:20,000
So I can see, yeah,

1718
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
there would be fun elements of this.

1719
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
Yeah, it's a bullet train now.

1720
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
Still use train tracks, it's a bullet train.

1721
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
Yeah, and I wouldn't have been so precious about it

1722
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
at the time of like, oh, the people movers going on.

1723
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
Like now, of course, it's a blasphemous thing to do,

1724
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
get rid of the people mover,

1725
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
but at the time I was like, yeah, cool, faster, great.

1726
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
I was for it then, yeah, too.

1727
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
I just didn't know it was going to be this.

1728
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
If they said we're making every ride at Disney

1729
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
25 miles per hour faster,

1730
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
I would have been for it.

1731
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:49,000
Every ride is going to go faster the summer at Disneyland.

1732
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:52,000
We're turning up the juice on everything.

1733
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
And I'd be like, hell yeah, let's do this.

1734
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:57,000
Well, because you're hoping that like when they do that,

1735
01:28:57,000 --> 01:29:00,000
they'll put the chili peps back in, you know?

1736
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:01,000
Well, I'm hoping.

1737
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:02,000
I'm hoping for all.

1738
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:03,000
You get an appropriate soundtrack.

1739
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,000
Chili Peppers took over two rides at Disneyland

1740
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:06,000
15 or 20 years ago.

1741
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
I'm hoping for all the rides at Disneyland one year.

1742
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
You want full discography.

1743
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:11,000
Full chili pepper.

1744
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:14,000
No repeats of songs, every single.

1745
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:15,000
Right.

1746
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:16,000
Yeah, yeah.

1747
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:19,000
Yep, so every ride will have a chili peppers song on it

1748
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:20,000
for a summer, that's my hope.

1749
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
Pirates of the Caribbean, you just hear,

1750
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
by the way, seven times.

1751
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:25,000
Yes.

1752
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:29,000
Don't interact with the song whatsoever.

1753
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:30,000
Yeah.

1754
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:31,000
Yeah, on the first drive.

1755
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:32,000
Yeah, yeah.

1756
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:35,000
It's just a lot of like long intros too.

1757
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:36,000
Like jam.

1758
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
There'll be live tracks where they like kind of jam out an intro.

1759
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:39,000
Sure.

1760
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:43,000
It's a small world has just has a four minute fleet bass solo.

1761
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:44,000
Yeah, yeah, of course.

1762
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
Because you've got to get it's an eight minute ride or something.

1763
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
So how are you going to get that length that song?

1764
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:49,000
Chilly summer.

1765
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:50,000
Oh, please.

1766
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:51,000
Yeah, yeah.

1767
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:55,000
Yeah, every ride goes 25% or 25 miles an hour faster

1768
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,000
and the chili peppers are on all the rides.

1769
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,000
That's my dream for a big event.

1770
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:03,000
If we're not getting Quacky Duck City, that's what I want.

1771
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:06,000
Well, shocking news, Disneyland has closed.

1772
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:11,000
Disneyland finally, permanently after many decades has kicked the bucket.

1773
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:12,000
Okay, wait a minute.

1774
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
In this scenario, is it because people don't want to go

1775
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:18,000
because of the red hot chili peppers or is it because all the rides broke?

1776
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
Oh, I don't know.

1777
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:23,000
Because people are like, oh, I don't want to hear those red hot chili peppers anymore.

1778
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:24,000
We'll call them A, we'll call them B.

1779
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:25,000
Okay.

1780
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:26,000
Yeah.

1781
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
I think if, well, if you got, if you like didn't know what you were like,

1782
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
it's the storybook land canal boats.

1783
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:31,000
It's really nice.

1784
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:34,000
You're going to see little villages where all the characters live.

1785
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:37,000
All right, let's do it.

1786
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:40,000
Mommy, mommy.

1787
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
They didn't bake the curves.

1788
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:46,000
I'm flying out of a boat, mom.

1789
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:50,000
Is there a ride we think we could legitimately make faster and it would work?

1790
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:51,000
That's a good question.

1791
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:54,000
Well, railroad is pretty funny.

1792
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:55,000
Yeah, yeah, for sure.

1793
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,000
You could make that go a little faster probably.

1794
01:30:57,000 --> 01:31:02,000
I understand the physics of trains and I think I do from the film Back to the Future 3.

1795
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:05,000
You just have to throw in different colored logs

1796
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:08,000
and that makes the train go progressively faster and faster.

1797
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:09,000
That's a good point.

1798
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:12,000
Different color, oh, into the engine?

1799
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
This is Dr. Emmett Brown's system.

1800
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
You just get, you know, all right, now you go to yellow.

1801
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:17,000
Now you go to orange.

1802
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:18,000
Now you go red.

1803
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:19,000
I got to rewatch his movie.

1804
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:20,000
I do not remember the logs.

1805
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:25,000
No, it's a color based log system and that gets the train up to 88 miles an hour.

1806
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:26,000
You got to have your colored logs.

1807
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
Regular logs are not going to do it for you.

1808
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:29,000
Right.

1809
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:30,000
So get some colored logs.

1810
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:31,000
Start cranking that thing.

1811
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:32,000
That makes sense for the train, yeah.

1812
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:33,000
What's the train song?

1813
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:35,000
Oh, which song with the red chili peppers?

1814
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:36,000
Yeah.

1815
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:37,000
Oh, let me think here.

1816
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:38,000
Song pairing.

1817
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:43,000
I'm trying to think of a good, what's on blood sugar, blood sugar sex magic maybe.

1818
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:46,000
The title track from blood sugar sex magic.

1819
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:47,000
I think that makes sense.

1820
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:53,000
Just for family friendly, could you change the name to blood sugar train magic?

1821
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:54,000
Yeah.

1822
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:55,000
That would help.

1823
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:56,000
Oh, great, great.

1824
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:57,000
Everybody can enjoy that.

1825
01:31:57,000 --> 01:32:01,000
That at least has one of the Disney words.

1826
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:02,000
That's true.

1827
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:05,000
It's kind of the most Disney friendly chili pepper song.

1828
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:09,000
Maybe they build the whole firework show around the song blood sugar sex magic.

1829
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:12,000
So like it would at least fit the brand.

1830
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
Did they say the phrase in the song?

1831
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:15,000
Oh yeah.

1832
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:16,000
Okay.

1833
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:20,000
Blood sugar baby, she's magic, sex magic, sex magic.

1834
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:21,000
Train magic.

1835
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:22,000
Train magic.

1836
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:23,000
Train magic.

1837
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:24,000
Uh huh.

1838
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:25,000
Story.

1839
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:26,000
Blood has to come out.

1840
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:27,000
Blood sugar story magic.

1841
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,000
I think blood has to come out of it.

1842
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:32,000
Story sugar train.

1843
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
Story sugar train magic.

1844
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:35,000
Wish.

1845
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:36,000
Wish magic.

1846
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:39,000
Wish magic maybe is the line then.

1847
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:40,000
Yeah.

1848
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:41,000
I think that's good.

1849
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:43,000
Yeah, you're going to have to make some edits.

1850
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:46,000
You know, actually we're thinking sugar is a little dicey because there's kind of a sexual,

1851
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:47,000
like, hey, come here sugar.

1852
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:48,000
Oh.

1853
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
Can we make that imagine just to be safe?

1854
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:51,000
Okay, yeah.

1855
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:52,000
All right.

1856
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:55,000
So the song is now dream imagine wish magic.

1857
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:58,000
Dream imagine wish magic.

1858
01:32:58,000 --> 01:32:59,000
Wish magic.

1859
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:00,000
Yeah.

1860
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:03,000
It's kind of a hard, a hard one of the harder songs in their catalog I think.

1861
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:06,000
It's a tougher sounding song, not as poppy.

1862
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:09,000
Not when Alan Menken puts his new lyrics on.

1863
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,000
Alan Menken will get on it and I think it'll be great.

1864
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:18,000
Anyway, not to avoid the question, but I think in terms of unpleasant and maybe the

1865
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
Astro Orbiter at the front of this land.

1866
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:21,000
Is your least favorite ride?

1867
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:22,000
Really?

1868
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:23,000
Wow.

1869
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:27,000
I'm trying to, I just keep going through rides and I'm like, well, I like all the vehicles.

1870
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,000
I like all the trains.

1871
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:34,000
I'm pretty good with mission space.

1872
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:40,000
Although I feel like, I feel like last time I rode out was okay, but the time before that

1873
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:41,000
I was pretty beat up.

1874
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,000
And living with the land is not your choice.

1875
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:44,000
Huh?

1876
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
Scott's choice is not living with the land.

1877
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:49,000
Maybe my choice is something I don't feel comfortable saying in public.

1878
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:50,000
Oh, okay.

1879
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:51,000
Excuse me.

1880
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:52,000
Excuse me.

1881
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:56,000
Maybe I, there's certain things, certain areas where I can't express myself in this

1882
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:57,000
country anymore.

1883
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:58,000
You're being censored.

1884
01:33:58,000 --> 01:33:59,000
Yeah, you're being censored.

1885
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:00,000
Because I woke.

1886
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:03,000
I do think genuinely, I don't think you guys have been hard enough on that journey.

1887
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:06,000
And it's not even like the dream finder at none of that.

1888
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:09,000
I think in and of itself, that thing is such a piece of shit.

1889
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,000
I don't like it.

1890
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:12,000
Don't get me wrong.

1891
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:16,000
But I would rather go on it 10 times than do one mission space.

1892
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
I think I just really don't like it.

1893
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
I might be on the same page with you there.

1894
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
Funny how so many of the choices are in Epcot.

1895
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:23,000
What a bummer.

1896
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:24,000
That is interesting.

1897
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:25,000
Yeah.

1898
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:26,000
But thank God Epcot now has a corn hole.

1899
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
Corn hole and hula hoops.

1900
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:31,000
Just to get to the end of this situation.

1901
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:35,000
They knew right away this was not going well.

1902
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:36,000
Operationally terrible.

1903
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:37,000
Shut down all the time.

1904
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:41,000
We're in the rise of the resistance zone of shutdowns probably every day.

1905
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:49,000
Because of the slow down, speed up, computers are going to manage how we track where all the vehicles are.

1906
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:53,000
Wait, that vehicle isn't where we thought it would be because of the slowing down and speeding up.

1907
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:56,000
Computer, what do you think?

1908
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:59,000
Malfunction, malfunction, steam.

1909
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:06,000
The computer system breaks down, every car stops in its tracks because they couldn't pinpoint exactly where everything was supposed to be.

1910
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
Everybody get out of your rocket rods.

1911
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:13,000
Really precarious, elevated, scary for kids to evacuate from.

1912
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:15,000
Almost no clearance.

1913
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:19,000
So that's all a disaster.

1914
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:23,000
Then like they, I mean I think they did a big shutdown.

1915
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:24,000
Three months.

1916
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:25,000
Early on.

1917
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:26,000
Wow.

1918
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:27,000
Right after.

1919
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:28,000
You know what?

1920
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:29,000
One month.

1921
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:30,000
One month.

1922
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:35,000
In one month, they scheduled a one month refurbishment which became three months.

1923
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:38,000
Then it opened and nothing was fixed.

1924
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:44,000
It limped along like this until fall 2000 and they said, guess what?

1925
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:45,000
Seven months.

1926
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:46,000
It's going to go down for seven months.

1927
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:49,000
We will see you in spring 2001.

1928
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:56,000
And then some reporters start asking the people in charge of Disneyland, hey it's spring.

1929
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:57,000
What's going on with that thing?

1930
01:35:57,000 --> 01:36:00,000
And they're like, yeah, all right, you got us, it's not happening.

1931
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
Rockerguys is gone forever.

1932
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:08,000
Cynthia Harris, I forget what she was, if she was the president or somebody big at the resource, she was the president.

1933
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:16,000
Said to the press, said to a newspaper, the high speed attraction was never able to perform to its design show standards.

1934
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:23,000
The problem was a budget conscious decision to run the high speed rods on the people movers unbanked track.

1935
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:31,000
Can you imagine a current Disney executive saying what really happened?

1936
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:42,000
Not saying, well, we are imagine upping, imagine upping some new experiences that we're going to dreameroo for you by 2032.

1937
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:47,000
Like there's no, there's no way they don't just like censor, censor.

1938
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:50,000
Cynthia Harris, a real, you know, she shoots from the hip.

1939
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:51,000
Yeah.

1940
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,000
Oh, she's a whistleblower.

1941
01:36:53,000 --> 01:37:01,000
The cornhole has been shut down as a trunk man in his thirties, wung a bag at a six year old's head.

1942
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:04,000
It did not perform as expected.

1943
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:15,000
The verb wung can only be described as wung, an action so violent it has never occurred until now and requires a new word.

1944
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:17,000
I mean, that's crazy.

1945
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:28,000
And this is where you really have to like imagine if they look, it's had its problems, but it's clearly like a hit and it's working very well.

1946
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:33,000
But you like imagine if they two years in rise, the resistance is gone.

1947
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:34,000
We're not doing it.

1948
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:35,000
It broke. It didn't work.

1949
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:36,000
It never worked.

1950
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:39,000
Like never mind on rise of the resistance.

1951
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:42,000
The chicken that was going pretty wild.

1952
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:43,000
Fully.

1953
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:44,000
Had emetronics.

1954
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:48,000
The statue keeps vomiting.

1955
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:53,000
The Gleason, the statue keeps vomiting and we don't know why.

1956
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:58,000
Dommel Gleason spews bile and he's up above the guest.

1957
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
So it lands on the guest.

1958
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
And if you're asking, does he exorcist?

1959
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:03,000
Yes, he exorcists.

1960
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:07,000
He spins around and around and around and there is no way to stop him.

1961
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:09,000
No, we don't even want to get near him.

1962
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:14,000
The well, that's sort of the rather cannon room is I think rocking itself because that's never going to run again.

1963
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:20,000
I've heard those cannons are never going to run a rise of resistance, which is my favorite room with most people.

1964
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:21,000
That's what I've heard.

1965
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:23,000
Because it shakes the foundation.

1966
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:28,000
Like we're talking about gives earthquake, many earthquakes to this building.

1967
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:29,000
And that's what I've heard.

1968
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:30,000
I'm not an expert.

1969
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:35,000
I've never talked to an engineer about it, but that's what people say is that, yeah, these things are off forever.

1970
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:37,000
Make them out of balsa wood.

1971
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:40,000
Like make them out of a light particle board.

1972
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:47,000
I think they're lighter than we think they are, but still the mechanism for making something that big move so much.

1973
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:48,000
That's a bummer.

1974
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
Yeah, if it's true, that's a bummer.

1975
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:51,000
Yeah.

1976
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:53,000
It's like a mini rocket rods within.

1977
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:54,000
Right.

1978
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:55,000
Yes.

1979
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:57,000
So yeah, there's partly of like this isn't working.

1980
01:38:57,000 --> 01:39:02,000
And luckily for their sake, it's only one room.

1981
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:03,000
Yeah.

1982
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:04,000
Yeah.

1983
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:07,000
And they're using that on a bigger scale.

1984
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:08,000
It's really crazy.

1985
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,000
That should be in a Mario ride also, by the way.

1986
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:11,000
Something like that.

1987
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:12,000
Yeah.

1988
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:13,000
Because it feels like such a Mario level.

1989
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:14,000
Oh, true.

1990
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:15,000
Yeah.

1991
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:16,000
Where you go in and out.

1992
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
Swamps that have more of a risk of actually hitting you.

1993
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:19,000
Yeah.

1994
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:20,000
Yeah.

1995
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:23,000
I saw that 2000 to 2001 refurbishment.

1996
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:26,000
That's when they were going to put on the glow in the dark.

1997
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
Like the glowing night lights.

1998
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:29,000
Oh, that's interesting.

1999
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:30,000
Wow.

2000
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:31,000
Wow.

2001
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:33,000
So that would have felt, maybe there's a version where they got it there.

2002
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:36,000
I like to imagine a world where like, all right, so let's see.

2003
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:39,000
We're going to do, we'll pop over to, you know, we'll go do Haunted Mansion.

2004
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:41,000
And then I think I got a two o'clock rods.

2005
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:42,000
We'll do rods.

2006
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:43,000
And then.

2007
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:44,000
Sure.

2008
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:45,000
I mean, I think it's, yeah.

2009
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:48,000
If they, they were probably like, the track is going to fall apart.

2010
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:53,000
We can't, we will have to rebuild the track and then just no one ever was interested in

2011
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:55,000
shutting down that big of a chunk of Tomorrowland.

2012
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:56,000
And then.

2013
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:57,000
They had just done.

2014
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:58,000
Right.

2015
01:39:58,000 --> 01:39:59,000
This had just happened.

2016
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:02,000
And you know what else is, here's, here's where it gets depressing too, is that part

2017
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
of new Tomorrowland, we got a new ride.

2018
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:05,000
Then that goes down.

2019
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:07,000
Once you've seen, honey, I shrugged the audience.

2020
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:08,000
You've pretty much seen it.

2021
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:11,000
I don't know if you need to keep doing that over and over.

2022
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:13,000
Submarines gone.

2023
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:16,000
Submarines gone with new Tomorrowland.

2024
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:17,000
So we've lost one.

2025
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:18,000
Right.

2026
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:19,000
Right.

2027
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:21,000
I mean, and that all, and nobody likes the bread.

2028
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:23,000
The Brown gets repainted very quickly.

2029
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:24,000
Right.

2030
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:30,000
It's almost, almost if you take away Astro Orbiter, there's almost no signs of new

2031
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
Tomorrowland in general.

2032
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:35,000
Buzz Lightyear came in there, cleaned up that area.

2033
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:43,000
So it was this big, this, you know, cheap for them, but too expensive for something

2034
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:45,000
that didn't stay.

2035
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:46,000
Wow.

2036
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:47,000
What a giant waste of money.

2037
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:48,000
I know.

2038
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:51,000
And just don't do the rocket rods if you're going to cheap out on it that much.

2039
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:54,000
I wonder how soon into development they realized.

2040
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:55,000
Yeah.

2041
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:56,000
Like, oh shit.

2042
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:57,000
Yeah.

2043
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:58,000
Yeah.

2044
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:01,000
And they had to put on a, and then Tony had to go do all the press clips of him.

2045
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:04,000
Like, because the future is the land of dreams.

2046
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:07,000
And that is where, and he knew he's dying inside and started him crazy.

2047
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:09,000
He has to go be the face of it.

2048
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:10,000
Yeah.

2049
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:11,000
Awful.

2050
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:12,000
What are you saying, Jason?

2051
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:18,000
That sign that rocket rods closed, I believe sold at one of the Disneyland auctions.

2052
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:19,000
Ha.

2053
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:26,000
At the, at the, I think I saw it at the, I remember remembering it was at the exhibit

2054
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:32,000
in the Burbank mall, one of the more recent auctions that is kind of set up as if it

2055
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:33,000
were a museum.

2056
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:34,000
Right, right.

2057
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:40,000
I'm like, it's a rocket rods thing and it's the rocket rods is closed today sign.

2058
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
The sign promising the rods will be back.

2059
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:43,000
Yeah.

2060
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:44,000
Yeah.

2061
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:45,000
But the rods did not come back.

2062
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:46,000
There were.

2063
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:47,000
There is no rod.

2064
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:53,000
I have found on eBay or Depop, there are rocket rods t-shirts and the sellers know what they

2065
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:57,000
have because those t-shirts are always 80 or $90.

2066
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:58,000
Okay.

2067
01:41:58,000 --> 01:41:59,000
Those are the real deal.

2068
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:00,000
Yeah.

2069
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:01,000
Those aren't remakes.

2070
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:02,000
Those are the vintage.

2071
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:03,000
They're vintage.

2072
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:04,000
Yeah.

2073
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:05,000
Yeah.

2074
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:06,000
Wow.

2075
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:07,000
True vintage rod merch.

2076
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:10,000
I like just calling it rods.

2077
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:11,000
Like if it just stuck around.

2078
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:12,000
Yeah, just turning the rod doesn't have a reel.

2079
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:13,000
That's what would have happened.

2080
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:16,000
Like, all right, so just yeah, quick, quick rod and then we'll do space man more over

2081
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:17,000
there if we have time.

2082
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:19,000
I'd rather, if we had to pick, I gotta do, we gotta do rods.

2083
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:20,000
I think rods.

2084
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:21,000
I would do rods.

2085
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:22,000
Yeah.

2086
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:26,000
So let's do it before we go to the pizza restaurant.

2087
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:32,000
Cause that pizza and then a ride on rods, you're going to feel a little gnarly.

2088
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:38,080
And the pizza restaurant, which is called Rod's Rocket Pizza Port, they changed the

2089
01:42:38,080 --> 01:42:42,760
name due to the now beloved success of rocket rods.

2090
01:42:42,760 --> 01:42:44,280
It's part of the rod universe.

2091
01:42:44,280 --> 01:42:45,280
Right, right.

2092
01:42:45,280 --> 01:42:48,000
And they'd have had a movie too probably by now.

2093
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:49,000
Oh yeah, yeah.

2094
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:50,000
Disney announces.

2095
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:51,000
Disney's rocket rod movie.

2096
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:52,000
Yeah.

2097
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:53,000
Verbinsky is back.

2098
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:56,000
Cor Verbinsky is doing rocket rods, yeah.

2099
01:42:56,000 --> 01:43:00,000
Now that by the way, still could happen from some of the announcements recently where you

2100
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:01,000
go, I don't know why they're doing that.

2101
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:02,000
Oh, I know.

2102
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:03,000
Club 33 movie.

2103
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:04,000
Club 33 movie.

2104
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:07,000
You're like, oh, why not a rocket rod movie?

2105
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:08,000
Talking about.

2106
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:12,000
Yeah, I know actually, and with rocket rods, you could be a little more freewheeling.

2107
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:13,000
That's right.

2108
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:14,000
Yeah.

2109
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:15,000
Yeah.

2110
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:16,000
I mean, I'm kid brained.

2111
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:20,120
I'm thinking about Thomas the Tank Engine, but like, you know, like a plucky upstart

2112
01:43:20,120 --> 01:43:24,800
vehicle named Rocket Rod who wants to go fast, but he doesn't know how to bank on turns.

2113
01:43:24,800 --> 01:43:28,220
So all his passengers always go a flying.

2114
01:43:28,220 --> 01:43:33,520
Rocket Rod doesn't mean to cause concussions, but he just gets too excited on the straightaways.

2115
01:43:33,520 --> 01:43:36,120
I like that Rod isn't a guy or a character.

2116
01:43:36,120 --> 01:43:37,120
Yeah, yeah.

2117
01:43:37,120 --> 01:43:38,120
Give him a little face.

2118
01:43:38,120 --> 01:43:41,320
I'm Rocket Rod.

2119
01:43:41,320 --> 01:43:44,400
That's their, yeah, rebooted just as a friend.

2120
01:43:44,400 --> 01:43:45,720
I'm seeing it right now.

2121
01:43:45,720 --> 01:43:47,840
Kids are crazy for transportation.

2122
01:43:47,840 --> 01:43:54,400
My pitch is more of an American graffiti with rocket rods racing and stuff, you know, future

2123
01:43:54,400 --> 01:43:56,200
American graffiti is my pitch.

2124
01:43:56,200 --> 01:43:59,760
What if they just, what if all it is, is you climb up there, it does just the straightaway

2125
01:43:59,760 --> 01:44:01,320
and then it doesn't bank.

2126
01:44:01,320 --> 01:44:06,120
It's like a, it's a race to the end of the entrance at Tomorrowland and then you just

2127
01:44:06,120 --> 01:44:07,480
back it up and you do it again.

2128
01:44:07,480 --> 01:44:08,480
15 seconds.

2129
01:44:08,480 --> 01:44:09,480
Rocket Rod drag races.

2130
01:44:09,480 --> 01:44:10,480
Okay.

2131
01:44:10,480 --> 01:44:11,480
Fine with me.

2132
01:44:11,480 --> 01:44:12,480
Yeah.

2133
01:44:12,480 --> 01:44:13,480
Some kinetic energy there.

2134
01:44:13,480 --> 01:44:17,120
And a sexy girl robot waving the flag in between.

2135
01:44:17,120 --> 01:44:19,000
Now I'm very interested.

2136
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:23,280
Gentle bots, start your engines.

2137
01:44:23,280 --> 01:44:24,280
Gentle bots.

2138
01:44:24,280 --> 01:44:28,920
That's the other rule, women can't go on the rocket rods.

2139
01:44:28,920 --> 01:44:31,280
Women are not allowed to go on the new rocket rods.

2140
01:44:31,280 --> 01:44:34,440
It seems a little odd, but okay, I'll allow it, I guess.

2141
01:44:34,440 --> 01:44:35,920
I don't know how they'll enforce that, but all right.

2142
01:44:35,920 --> 01:44:38,420
Yeah, it seems confusing, but.

2143
01:44:38,420 --> 01:44:45,360
Can I say, there's been a lot of teases about rocket rods, about the people mover of the

2144
01:44:45,680 --> 01:44:55,920
years, 2010, a former Disneyland, I think president George Kalogridis is quote, what

2145
01:44:55,920 --> 01:45:02,560
I do know is we can never bring it back as it was originally, but don't worry.

2146
01:45:02,560 --> 01:45:06,480
Everyone understands the passion everyone has for it.

2147
01:45:06,480 --> 01:45:08,000
Hang in there.

2148
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:09,640
So keep hanging in there everyone.

2149
01:45:09,640 --> 01:45:10,640
What year was that?

2150
01:45:10,640 --> 01:45:11,640
He said 2010.

2151
01:45:11,640 --> 01:45:12,640
2010.

2152
01:45:12,640 --> 01:45:13,640
Okay.

2153
01:45:13,640 --> 01:45:14,640
A lot of hanging.

2154
01:45:15,040 --> 01:45:18,520
Roadie walking along the track a while ago.

2155
01:45:18,520 --> 01:45:19,520
People spotted him.

2156
01:45:19,520 --> 01:45:24,200
The legend of Roadie walking along the track of the people mover a few years before.

2157
01:45:24,200 --> 01:45:28,520
We don't have footage of this, but this is a frequent and a frequent anecdote.

2158
01:45:28,520 --> 01:45:33,040
We're supposed to get hope because an Imagineer went to a place.

2159
01:45:33,040 --> 01:45:34,040
We need more than this.

2160
01:45:34,040 --> 01:45:36,480
We need hope that's big enough to fill a Honda center.

2161
01:45:36,480 --> 01:45:41,000
The Imagineering documentary is holding a model that looks like it possibly could be

2162
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:44,120
a space mountain and Roadie's in charge of the new space mountain.

2163
01:45:44,120 --> 01:45:45,120
Roadie fired.

2164
01:45:45,120 --> 01:45:46,120
Nevermind.

2165
01:45:46,120 --> 01:45:47,120
He's gone.

2166
01:45:47,120 --> 01:45:48,120
He's been fired.

2167
01:45:48,120 --> 01:45:49,120
Early retirement.

2168
01:45:49,120 --> 01:45:50,600
He's been put into early retirement.

2169
01:45:50,600 --> 01:45:53,120
He goes to Virgin Galactic, but he's not there anymore.

2170
01:45:53,120 --> 01:45:55,120
I don't know if that's going already.

2171
01:45:55,120 --> 01:45:58,120
Imagineering for a seminar or a master class.

2172
01:45:58,120 --> 01:45:59,960
He was in Epcot a couple months ago.

2173
01:45:59,960 --> 01:46:03,800
So everyone wants things to be real.

2174
01:46:03,800 --> 01:46:06,760
This is the saddest hunting for us.

2175
01:46:06,760 --> 01:46:10,120
Swish cast as seeing a guy walking through a place.

2176
01:46:10,120 --> 01:46:12,280
Oh my god, Roadie's walking through Epcot.

2177
01:46:12,280 --> 01:46:19,400
Wait, in terms of history rhyming, new Epcot, it's done, commuter core hall, the picnic

2178
01:46:19,400 --> 01:46:24,600
area is open, then immediately test track 2.0 closes.

2179
01:46:24,600 --> 01:46:27,600
Like you were saying, well, it's closing.

2180
01:46:27,600 --> 01:46:29,080
They are redoing it.

2181
01:46:29,080 --> 01:46:33,040
Yeah, the new test track is down, or excuse me, going to be built now.

2182
01:46:33,040 --> 01:46:35,000
Oh, they're doing the full refurbishment.

2183
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:36,000
Yes.

2184
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:40,960
But when you said like Tomorrowland 98 and the subs are closed, it just reminded me of

2185
01:46:41,360 --> 01:46:42,360
That's how they do it.

2186
01:46:42,360 --> 01:46:43,360
Look over here.

2187
01:46:43,360 --> 01:46:44,360
This keeps happening.

2188
01:46:44,360 --> 01:46:45,360
They roll it.

2189
01:46:45,360 --> 01:46:46,360
Yeah, they roll them over.

2190
01:46:46,360 --> 01:46:51,880
It's my favorite theme park aesthetic is Disney Future.

2191
01:46:51,880 --> 01:46:55,760
It's one of the things I think they do the very best, maybe the thing they do the very

2192
01:46:55,760 --> 01:46:56,760
best.

2193
01:46:56,760 --> 01:47:00,400
Why is this the most problematic area?

2194
01:47:00,400 --> 01:47:02,160
Why do these have to struggle?

2195
01:47:02,160 --> 01:47:04,940
Why are these the areas that don't get the infinite budget?

2196
01:47:04,940 --> 01:47:07,000
This is what I'd like to see change.

2197
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:10,760
And just to tie the Tomorrowland story back together, it really, unfortunately, you have

2198
01:47:10,760 --> 01:47:15,400
to say if it's I don't want to blame Rod himself now that I've humanized him.

2199
01:47:15,400 --> 01:47:20,720
I don't want to put this all on Rod's big clunky and loud shoulders.

2200
01:47:20,720 --> 01:47:25,840
It's the decision making to cheap out on Rod's that has still left this decaying husk of

2201
01:47:25,840 --> 01:47:28,960
a track that now they're back to where they were.

2202
01:47:28,960 --> 01:47:30,880
We're exactly where we were.

2203
01:47:30,880 --> 01:47:35,200
Space Mountain a lock, Star Tours a lock, everything else not a lock, all these spaces

2204
01:47:35,200 --> 01:47:36,200
that need to be filled.

2205
01:47:36,200 --> 01:47:40,260
You could blow up any of these things any second and nobody would care.

2206
01:47:40,660 --> 01:47:44,340
It's a land you got to get rid of that track, even if you don't replace it with anything.

2207
01:47:44,340 --> 01:47:45,880
The track has to go.

2208
01:47:45,880 --> 01:47:48,900
But also you want to keep people going to Space Mountain.

2209
01:47:48,900 --> 01:47:53,820
It's a we've gotten nowhere since 1988.

2210
01:47:53,820 --> 01:47:55,900
It's really crazy.

2211
01:47:55,900 --> 01:48:00,580
Is there what percentage of hope do you have that this is the year at D23 that we finally

2212
01:48:00,580 --> 01:48:02,220
hear something?

2213
01:48:03,220 --> 01:48:15,660
Okay, what I think is going to happen is that we will get a 50% new Tomorrowland announced

2214
01:48:15,660 --> 01:48:16,660
in the set.

2215
01:48:16,660 --> 01:48:18,820
There'll be maybe one that maybe it's a version of Tron.

2216
01:48:18,820 --> 01:48:24,660
Maybe it's one thing that's like a big shiny thing and then a lot of little things.

2217
01:48:24,660 --> 01:48:28,020
That's kind of that's what I think and I think there's a good chance of that.

2218
01:48:28,020 --> 01:48:34,300
You are doing a parlay bet that they do something to Tomorrowland.

2219
01:48:34,300 --> 01:48:37,420
Because the Autopia I think is kind of a hint to me.

2220
01:48:37,420 --> 01:48:42,260
The announcement of Autopia being electric in what 2027 is a hint that we're going to

2221
01:48:42,260 --> 01:48:46,120
do stuff but it's not going to be some massive thing that we kind of want where they rip

2222
01:48:46,120 --> 01:48:50,540
out the subs in Autopia and build a whole crazy new big thing over there.

2223
01:48:50,540 --> 01:48:53,700
So I kind of think they're going to do half and half.

2224
01:48:53,700 --> 01:48:56,480
It's going to plus up some stuff there.

2225
01:48:56,480 --> 01:48:57,480
It's going to make it look better.

2226
01:48:57,480 --> 01:49:01,640
We pull out the people mover track and then I don't know if it's Tron or if it's some

2227
01:49:01,640 --> 01:49:05,240
maybe it's I don't think they're going to do a Tokyo and rip out our Space Mountain.

2228
01:49:05,240 --> 01:49:06,240
I wouldn't hate it.

2229
01:49:06,240 --> 01:49:07,240
I wouldn't hate it.

2230
01:49:07,240 --> 01:49:08,240
I would.

2231
01:49:08,240 --> 01:49:10,200
But there's things they need to do first.

2232
01:49:10,200 --> 01:49:11,200
That's the thing.

2233
01:49:11,200 --> 01:49:12,200
Of course I'd love that.

2234
01:49:12,200 --> 01:49:13,600
But we got a big list.

2235
01:49:13,600 --> 01:49:17,120
My guess was that they were just going to put the Guardians coaster in there in Tokyo.

2236
01:49:17,120 --> 01:49:18,120
But apparently that's not the case.

2237
01:49:18,120 --> 01:49:19,920
It's a new kind of coaster.

2238
01:49:19,920 --> 01:49:20,920
I was wrong about that.

2239
01:49:20,920 --> 01:49:21,920
Yes.

2240
01:49:21,920 --> 01:49:22,920
Wow.

2241
01:49:22,920 --> 01:49:24,320
So it's a totally new and I don't know that they know what it is yet.

2242
01:49:24,320 --> 01:49:25,320
Cool.

2243
01:49:25,360 --> 01:49:26,360
Yeah.

2244
01:49:26,360 --> 01:49:30,880
So that's I think there's a very good chance we'll get like three small announcements for

2245
01:49:30,880 --> 01:49:37,000
Tomorrowland and then maybe one moderate to big announcements and they'll tie that as

2246
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:38,000
well.

2247
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:39,680
Now we're doing something with Tomorrowland.

2248
01:49:39,680 --> 01:49:41,280
That's my guess.

2249
01:49:41,280 --> 01:49:42,720
I don't think I can go with you.

2250
01:49:42,720 --> 01:49:43,720
You don't even think that's happening.

2251
01:49:43,720 --> 01:49:44,720
I'm too hurt.

2252
01:49:44,720 --> 01:49:51,760
But I think maybe in two years we get but I think priorities are specifics about Avatar.

2253
01:49:51,760 --> 01:49:58,840
I think in general you could feel that they are pushing like and a lot of this isn't

2254
01:49:58,840 --> 01:49:59,840
forward.

2255
01:49:59,840 --> 01:50:04,360
It feels like about how they're going to get frozen and tangled and that kind of thing.

2256
01:50:04,360 --> 01:50:05,360
Yes.

2257
01:50:05,360 --> 01:50:06,760
I think that we're getting all that first.

2258
01:50:06,760 --> 01:50:07,880
I think that's all priority.

2259
01:50:07,880 --> 01:50:13,200
But I almost and maybe I'm wrong about this is I feel like they're going to hedge some

2260
01:50:13,200 --> 01:50:16,480
bets still on what they're fully doing with all of it.

2261
01:50:16,480 --> 01:50:19,760
I think they'll show more of the Avatar and they'll say it's but I don't know that they'll

2262
01:50:20,080 --> 01:50:22,400
us where it's going yet.

2263
01:50:22,400 --> 01:50:26,240
I could be wrong about that but like that all feels like that is still a little bit

2264
01:50:26,240 --> 01:50:27,240
emotion.

2265
01:50:27,240 --> 01:50:28,240
This is all complete guess.

2266
01:50:28,240 --> 01:50:31,500
I don't know what I'm talking about but that all still feels like we're not quite sure.

2267
01:50:31,500 --> 01:50:36,080
It feels like some of the Magic Kingdom stuff is a little more close to reality beyond Big

2268
01:50:36,080 --> 01:50:37,080
Thunder stuff.

2269
01:50:37,080 --> 01:50:38,080
OK.

2270
01:50:38,080 --> 01:50:39,080
I keep hearing rumors about that.

2271
01:50:39,080 --> 01:50:41,800
So I almost get a sense of like I bet they know where that stuff is going more than they

2272
01:50:41,800 --> 01:50:47,560
exactly know what isn't it forward is if it's a third park if it's just extensions of the

2273
01:50:47,560 --> 01:50:48,560
two parks.

2274
01:50:49,400 --> 01:50:50,400
I don't know.

2275
01:50:50,400 --> 01:50:53,000
It's an episode is just is us betting.

2276
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:54,000
Oh betting.

2277
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:55,000
Yeah.

2278
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:56,000
Yeah.

2279
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:57,000
And putting actual putting actual money on.

2280
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:58,000
Yeah.

2281
01:50:58,000 --> 01:50:59,000
I'll put money on it.

2282
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:00,000
Yeah.

2283
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:01,000
Yeah.

2284
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:02,000
That's fun.

2285
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:03,000
That's interesting.

2286
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:04,000
Yeah.

2287
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:05,000
It's going to do it along with us too.

2288
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:06,000
I don't exactly know how to structure that.

2289
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:07,000
I don't know how to make a betting.

2290
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:08,000
That's going to be tough.

2291
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:15,960
Well with fanatics dot com and ESPN you can use ESPN bet and keep it in house at Disney

2292
01:51:15,960 --> 01:51:16,960
somehow.

2293
01:51:17,400 --> 01:51:21,640
You know what we'll probably have to do is we'll each come in with sort of a guarantee

2294
01:51:21,640 --> 01:51:28,920
of like OK I believe they will show concept art of a frozen land or mini land with a new

2295
01:51:28,920 --> 01:51:33,880
frozen rock like we'll have to come in with sort of a bet and then you the other two will

2296
01:51:33,880 --> 01:51:37,400
have to say I will take you up on that I don't believe that's happening.

2297
01:51:37,400 --> 01:51:43,120
Like I think we're gonna have to do that as opposed to like figuring out an official board

2298
01:51:43,120 --> 01:51:45,760
of all the different because like yes you're right.

2299
01:51:45,760 --> 01:51:51,040
Tangled frozen avatars we know how do you determine odds that are in the mix is a mess.

2300
01:51:51,040 --> 01:51:53,120
It has to be just like between us.

2301
01:51:53,120 --> 01:51:54,120
But yes it would have to.

2302
01:51:54,120 --> 01:52:01,520
I would have to say like OK I believe they will show Wakanda and they will show a Black

2303
01:52:01,520 --> 01:52:04,840
Panther ride specifically.

2304
01:52:04,840 --> 01:52:05,840
And it's in Disney.

2305
01:52:05,840 --> 01:52:08,120
I don't know you could say it's in Disneyland forward and that's where it's going to go

2306
01:52:08,120 --> 01:52:09,120
or something like you would have to.

2307
01:52:09,120 --> 01:52:11,960
I'll have to bring in a specific thing that you will have to either agree or disagree

2308
01:52:12,040 --> 01:52:13,040
with me on.

2309
01:52:13,040 --> 01:52:14,040
Yeah.

2310
01:52:14,040 --> 01:52:16,760
And I guess it can be as specific as we want it to be.

2311
01:52:16,760 --> 01:52:17,760
Right.

2312
01:52:17,760 --> 01:52:18,760
Right.

2313
01:52:18,760 --> 01:52:21,680
But it's still going to be tricky because maybe maybe it has to have a qualifier like

2314
01:52:21,680 --> 01:52:26,960
it'll have like it's tough because it's too hard.

2315
01:52:26,960 --> 01:52:29,480
We shouldn't really work it out on the air because it's boring.

2316
01:52:29,480 --> 01:52:31,880
But it is like when you're betting on some of this.

2317
01:52:31,880 --> 01:52:35,040
You're betting on the Super Bowl and when you bet on the Super Bowl bet on football

2318
01:52:35,040 --> 01:52:38,080
games in Vegas you can bet on the coin toss.

2319
01:52:38,120 --> 01:52:43,680
You can bet on like like whoever is doing the halftime show like what songs they will

2320
01:52:43,680 --> 01:52:44,680
sing.

2321
01:52:44,680 --> 01:52:45,680
Like we could go.

2322
01:52:45,680 --> 01:52:46,680
Yeah.

2323
01:52:46,680 --> 01:52:47,680
It's more like that I think.

2324
01:52:47,680 --> 01:52:48,680
I think it's more like that.

2325
01:52:48,680 --> 01:52:49,680
Yeah.

2326
01:52:49,680 --> 01:52:50,680
Yeah.

2327
01:52:50,680 --> 01:52:51,680
Oh yeah.

2328
01:52:51,680 --> 01:52:52,680
You could bet on.

2329
01:52:52,680 --> 01:52:53,680
Yeah.

2330
01:52:53,680 --> 01:52:54,680
Like is like is does the score have like a nine and a six in it.

2331
01:52:54,680 --> 01:52:55,680
Right.

2332
01:52:55,680 --> 01:52:56,680
You could go that.

2333
01:52:56,680 --> 01:52:57,680
I think that's what we do.

2334
01:52:57,680 --> 01:52:58,680
What if it's.

2335
01:52:58,680 --> 01:52:59,680
Hey let's simplify.

2336
01:52:59,680 --> 01:53:00,680
Bingo.

2337
01:53:00,680 --> 01:53:01,680
OK.

2338
01:53:01,680 --> 01:53:02,680
Yeah.

2339
01:53:02,680 --> 01:53:03,680
Bingo cards.

2340
01:53:03,680 --> 01:53:04,680
OK.

2341
01:53:04,680 --> 01:53:05,680
And it's either how many do you light up or if you get lines.

2342
01:53:05,680 --> 01:53:06,680
That's funny too.

2343
01:53:06,680 --> 01:53:07,680
Yeah.

2344
01:53:08,280 --> 01:53:11,120
So we got Tomorrowland 2055 episode.

2345
01:53:11,120 --> 01:53:12,120
We've got repeat.

2346
01:53:12,120 --> 01:53:14,680
Frequent footage final four.

2347
01:53:14,680 --> 01:53:16,600
Frequent footage final four.

2348
01:53:16,600 --> 01:53:21,080
We've got potentially unbilled that could go into Tomorrowland 2055.

2349
01:53:21,080 --> 01:53:22,080
We've got prop bets.

2350
01:53:22,080 --> 01:53:23,080
Yeah.

2351
01:53:23,080 --> 01:53:25,960
We've got a prop bet episode but then we also have to fix Tomorrowland which I.

2352
01:53:25,960 --> 01:53:27,460
We've got fixed Tomorrowland.

2353
01:53:27,460 --> 01:53:32,040
We can assign our assignments right now if you'd like.

2354
01:53:32,040 --> 01:53:33,560
Do you have that worked out.

2355
01:53:33,560 --> 01:53:34,560
I do.

2356
01:53:34,560 --> 01:53:35,560
Well yes.

2357
01:53:35,560 --> 01:53:36,560
It's a very it's pretty simple.

2358
01:53:36,600 --> 01:53:37,920
It has to be randomized doesn't it.

2359
01:53:37,920 --> 01:53:38,920
Well right.

2360
01:53:38,920 --> 01:53:40,680
So I have no I have assigned one through three.

2361
01:53:40,680 --> 01:53:41,680
Oh.

2362
01:53:41,680 --> 01:53:44,320
And I could just have Jason pick a number and you'll pick a number and then I'll get

2363
01:53:44,320 --> 01:53:46,760
whatever is left over because I chose the numbers.

2364
01:53:46,760 --> 01:53:47,760
OK.

2365
01:53:47,760 --> 01:53:48,760
So this is pretty random.

2366
01:53:48,760 --> 01:53:49,760
This is a little nerve wracking.

2367
01:53:49,760 --> 01:53:50,760
Right now.

2368
01:53:50,760 --> 01:53:51,760
So remind remind everybody what the system.

2369
01:53:51,760 --> 01:53:56,040
So the fixed Tomorrowland basically we're each going to have a different assignment

2370
01:53:56,040 --> 01:54:00,880
in a different budget essentially and a different mindset in a lot of ways because somebody

2371
01:54:00,880 --> 01:54:04,120
is going to have to fix Tomorrowland in a budget.

2372
01:54:04,280 --> 01:54:08,280
So you're going to have to have a budget that's going to be less money than this rocket

2373
01:54:08,280 --> 01:54:09,280
rod era.

2374
01:54:09,280 --> 01:54:10,280
OK.

2375
01:54:10,280 --> 01:54:11,280
Or at least similar.

2376
01:54:11,280 --> 01:54:12,280
At least similar.

2377
01:54:12,280 --> 01:54:17,280
At least similar to a rocket rod where like you can kind of do a rocket rod type overlay

2378
01:54:17,280 --> 01:54:21,280
or change to one existing ride there but it's going to be a lot of paint.

2379
01:54:21,280 --> 01:54:26,880
You have to be you're going to have to really like like figure out economical ways to make

2380
01:54:26,880 --> 01:54:27,880
Tomorrowland better.

2381
01:54:27,880 --> 01:54:28,880
Yeah.

2382
01:54:28,880 --> 01:54:33,680
Somebody is going to get the budget for a realistic twenty twenty four Tomorrowland.

2383
01:54:34,120 --> 01:54:36,240
But what would Disney in twenty twenty four do?

2384
01:54:36,240 --> 01:54:37,900
It's going to be a lot of IP.

2385
01:54:37,900 --> 01:54:40,640
It's going to be a lot of cloning from other parks.

2386
01:54:40,640 --> 01:54:45,280
So all that's obviously the other two people will have to police you if you decide to like

2387
01:54:45,280 --> 01:54:48,040
act like you could put in like a goofy movie ride or something.

2388
01:54:48,040 --> 01:54:51,520
We go that is not what twenty four twenty four Disney would do.

2389
01:54:51,520 --> 01:54:55,440
But it also doesn't have to be that a bunch of it just turns into grass with corn hole

2390
01:54:55,440 --> 01:54:56,440
and hula hoops.

2391
01:54:56,440 --> 01:55:03,120
It doesn't have to be but there will be a when in doubt yes future grass portions of

2392
01:55:03,120 --> 01:55:04,120
Tomorrowland.

2393
01:55:04,120 --> 01:55:12,200
And then the third is maybe I don't know maybe the most fun big budget blue sky and you can

2394
01:55:12,200 --> 01:55:16,160
maybe put a few originals that like you have a massive budget here.

2395
01:55:16,160 --> 01:55:17,160
Yeah.

2396
01:55:17,160 --> 01:55:18,960
It's maybe like they sold ESPN.

2397
01:55:18,960 --> 01:55:19,960
Yeah.

2398
01:55:19,960 --> 01:55:20,960
You have all that money now.

2399
01:55:20,960 --> 01:55:21,960
Right.

2400
01:55:21,960 --> 01:55:22,960
The Albatross is gone.

2401
01:55:22,960 --> 01:55:23,960
Uh huh.

2402
01:55:23,960 --> 01:55:27,400
And you really I will like whoever gets that I think will be able to sort of have carte

2403
01:55:28,400 --> 01:55:35,360
to do some IP maybe some original bring back old stuff like that's maybe the most fun one

2404
01:55:35,360 --> 01:55:39,600
and that's that's going to be a big that's going to be I think the one that I want the

2405
01:55:39,600 --> 01:55:40,600
most.

2406
01:55:40,600 --> 01:55:44,360
But it's we're going to have to trust that you aren't lying over there and I well I

2407
01:55:44,360 --> 01:55:47,720
haven't written down what the numbers are so you guys can see that I'm not going to

2408
01:55:47,720 --> 01:55:48,720
give myself the thing.

2409
01:55:48,720 --> 01:55:52,120
So I have numbers assigned to each one one through three.

2410
01:55:52,120 --> 01:55:53,120
Yeah.

2411
01:55:54,080 --> 01:55:59,480
I will let's just say Jason picks first one two or three and then I will give you your

2412
01:55:59,480 --> 01:56:02,520
assignment to Jason.

2413
01:56:02,520 --> 01:56:10,640
You got budget tomorrow and and now it's up to between Scott and I and one of us gets

2414
01:56:10,640 --> 01:56:14,940
realistic healthy budget but they have to be within the sort of confines of what Disney

2415
01:56:14,940 --> 01:56:19,280
does in twenty twenty four and the other gets the fun blue sky one.

2416
01:56:19,520 --> 01:56:23,560
Scott you have to choose either one or three.

2417
01:56:23,560 --> 01:56:26,800
What do you choose.

2418
01:56:26,800 --> 01:56:30,000
This is very important.

2419
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:33,640
Three choose Scott gets the blue sky.

2420
01:56:33,640 --> 01:56:34,640
Yeah.

2421
01:56:34,640 --> 01:56:35,640
Tomorrow.

2422
01:56:35,640 --> 01:56:38,760
That was the order you read them.

2423
01:56:38,760 --> 01:56:41,480
I didn't think you would give blue sky to three.

2424
01:56:41,480 --> 01:56:43,120
That was the third one you mentioned.

2425
01:56:43,120 --> 01:56:47,400
That's why I thought exactly how I had listed.

2426
01:56:47,400 --> 01:56:48,400
Oh wow.

2427
01:56:49,400 --> 01:56:53,840
Jason has a problem with the with the mechanism.

2428
01:56:53,840 --> 01:56:55,800
I honestly think I got the worst one.

2429
01:56:55,800 --> 01:56:56,800
Huh.

2430
01:56:56,800 --> 01:57:00,400
I would have had been budget would have been my second choice if there's some way we can

2431
01:57:00,400 --> 01:57:04,200
trade if you want to like one day to come up with a reasonable trade I have realistic

2432
01:57:04,200 --> 01:57:07,760
twenty twenty four what they might announce at this year's D23.

2433
01:57:07,760 --> 01:57:11,600
So mine is the most boring one because it's going to have to be IP it's going to have

2434
01:57:11,600 --> 01:57:17,520
to be a lot of cloned rides but I'm open to a trade with you now with Jason.

2435
01:57:17,520 --> 01:57:20,880
Oh no I got a budget.

2436
01:57:20,880 --> 01:57:22,360
I got my assignment.

2437
01:57:22,360 --> 01:57:28,360
I got myself and I love that you got budget but I but you have no yeah you have to be

2438
01:57:28,360 --> 01:57:31,640
the most creative with little money to fix Tomorrowland.

2439
01:57:31,640 --> 01:57:32,640
Okay.

2440
01:57:32,640 --> 01:57:35,280
So you're really going to have to get in there and imagine what you would do with with just

2441
01:57:35,280 --> 01:57:42,480
paint and again you can do sort of a rocket rods ish level redo of an existing right is

2442
01:57:42,480 --> 01:57:43,480
maybe the bar.

2443
01:57:43,480 --> 01:57:44,480
Yeah.

2444
01:57:44,480 --> 01:57:47,200
Or maybe build a very small kind of ride using that money.

2445
01:57:47,280 --> 01:57:51,000
It could be I'll even say it could be like web slingers level.

2446
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:52,000
Oh okay.

2447
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:55,160
That's still expensive but it's a smaller ride.

2448
01:57:55,160 --> 01:57:57,360
It's not they would never have called that any ticket.

2449
01:57:57,360 --> 01:57:58,360
I don't know.

2450
01:57:58,360 --> 01:57:59,360
Yeah.

2451
01:57:59,360 --> 01:58:03,680
Maybe either like either of you I'd say could allude to a ride that is a giant lie that

2452
01:58:03,680 --> 01:58:05,140
will never get done.

2453
01:58:05,140 --> 01:58:06,140
That's true too.

2454
01:58:06,140 --> 01:58:10,280
That's all that's always a big option with the modern Disney to yes I can lie a little

2455
01:58:10,280 --> 01:58:17,000
bit but yeah so so yeah you guys have the better assignments I think mine is the most

2456
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:18,000
boring.

2457
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:19,000
Huh.

2458
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:20,000
I believe.

2459
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:21,000
Well thank you for being.

2460
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:22,000
It's an interesting thought.

2461
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:25,600
It's an interesting thought experiment yeah yeah well thank you for being a randomized

2462
01:58:25,600 --> 01:58:26,600
martyr.

2463
01:58:26,600 --> 01:58:27,600
Sure.

2464
01:58:27,600 --> 01:58:31,080
Well hey that's great well I'm glad we've done the connective tissue we've identified

2465
01:58:31,080 --> 01:58:36,720
the problem maybe this has all taught us something that we can use in our in this eventual episode

2466
01:58:36,720 --> 01:58:37,720
which should be a lot of fun.

2467
01:58:37,720 --> 01:58:38,720
I agree.

2468
01:58:38,720 --> 01:58:43,120
We'll get to that before D23 happens before either we get some stuff we want or we get

2469
01:58:43,120 --> 01:58:45,080
our hearts broken.

2470
01:58:45,080 --> 01:58:49,480

2474
01:59:03,040 --> 01:59:09,820
down at the ground the dirty ground the space mountain brown on the ground start counting

2475
01:59:09,820 --> 01:59:18,980
my dirty pennies and not the fun way I usually count my dirty pennies.
