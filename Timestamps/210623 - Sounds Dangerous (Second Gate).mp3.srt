1
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:05,380
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:27,100
A theme park attraction that's almost entirely in the dark that isn't supposed to be scary

3
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:28,740
Sounds dangerous.

4
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:31,520
This is Podcast the Ride the Second Gate.

5
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:33,900
I'm Scott Gardner joined by Jason Sheridan.

6
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:34,120
Hi.

7
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:36,060
That was a very smooth intro.

8
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:47,260
I thought well yeah yeah hey when you have it ready to go and you're basing it on the promotional posters and such for this attraction it lends itself to that.

9
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,240
Mike Carlson, hi.

10
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:50,140
Hi I'm here yes.

11
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:54,680
This ride scared the shit out of me I will say that real quick.

12
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:56,360
I was very scared.

13
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,100
I wasn't supposed to but.

14
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:01,640
You say that and absolutely that's how I felt.

15
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:02,400
Oh interesting.

16
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:06,320
Before going in so I just wanted to when you said that I went oh yeah that hits close close.

17
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,540
I didn't take into account that this could be terrifying.

18
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,120
Well look it's a crime story.

19
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:16,220
It's a gritty crime drama which is one of the scariest genres.

20
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:22,440
So yeah it's pretty you know it's it's Sopranos and it's.

21
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:23,040
Clockers.

22
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,800
You said clockers not blockers right?

23
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,180
I said clockers no not blockers.

24
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:31,060
No.

25
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:33,840
The crime there was those parents not minding their god damn business.

26
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,800
Right right that's a different thing.

27
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:46,920
Scott you also said sounds dangerous very quickly much like the script of this attraction where a narrator says sounds dangerous very fast.

28
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,260
Like the phrase is rushed what do you mean?

29
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:54,920
Oh like within the first like two minutes of the show they say sounds dangerous.

30
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:55,960
Sounds dangerous.

31
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:01,760
I guess they're explaining the concept so it makes sense they say the title of the thing they're doing a quote unquote pilot of.

32
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:05,120
And they're proud of the pun I guess is it.

33
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:09,340
I don't know what it is exactly I mean sort of the word sound is in it.

34
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,560
It's got a double meaning I guess.

35
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:12,480
I guess.

36
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:19,740
Maybe I don't know it's a phrase they put the word that was what the show is in a weird context.

37
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,020
Look we'll explain all this.

38
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:25,480
This is a this is a Disney MGM studio attraction.

39
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:30,240
I think they crossed the border over to being a Disney's Hollywood studio attraction.

40
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:48,580
And a weird one one that either I can't tell if people don't know at all or if it was there strangely so long that it was the Drew Carey's face haunted people as they walked two different attractions passed by this.

41
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:49,180
It's a good question.

42
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:53,000
This is one of those where I don't yeah I have not seen a rich fandom for it.

43
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,740
And we've we've got a couple of these two where like I go I don't know that anybody was like stanning characters from body wars.

44
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:05,780
But body wars feels a hundred times more popular in the fandom than this does.

45
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,760
Yeah yeah I mean I like this because I liked everything MGM studios.

46
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:13,660
I didn't realize it stuck around for 13 years.

47
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,400
I can't believe how long this ran.

48
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:21,920
Yeah it did die a slow death in 2009 around there started going seasonally.

49
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:33,140
And that that feels just like the kiss of death for attraction if it starts to run seasonally except the Houdini where I did six legs great adventure where the demand was like bring it back and they did.

50
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:40,540
It's like bringing a show back from the debt like you know if they move the time slot there's probably trouble.

51
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:44,460
But yeah you know a massive fan campaign has to be launched.

52
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:49,160
This I think people had their fill of whatever what sounds dangerous.

53
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:52,280
Yeah I think they they got it.

54
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,280
I go ahead.

55
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:58,000
I was going to say you know it could look the every TV show has come back now.

56
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:00,840
There's not a single television show that has not been revived.

57
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:04,940
So perhaps the sounds dangerous movement will happen.

58
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:13,260
Yeah the the detective Foster people wanted hear more of his stories.

59
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:19,380
We see some see two minutes or so and then yeah and then hear the rest.

60
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:29,680
There's so many I mean there's I have noticed there's so many Disney bounders bounding is foster lately you know that like subtle foster look and if you don't know what we're talking about.

61
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,820
Drew Carey plays a character named Foster.

62
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:41,200
Yeah yeah he's a he's a detective and he's on the poster and up really big on the marquee of this attraction.

63
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,700
He's doing a real like hot cha cha.

64
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,420
Oh I Yikes.

65
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:47,880
It's hot out here.

66
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:58,500
It gets mighty hot being a detective which I would really like to say honestly I would call for this at a live show if somebody wants to if you have a puffy coat don't spend a lot of money on this.

67
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:08,280
But if you feel like you could easily do a foster cosplay and have some mild resemblance to Drew Carey I would or don't does that doesn't matter.

68
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,560
Just make that face.

69
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,840
Yeah you yeah I mean full cosplay too.

70
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:15,720
Yeah but bounding is the bounding is less of a bounding is the subtle.

71
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:22,500
It's a little more it can be a little more subtle though like bounding I feel like you know you anytime I see somebody bounding I go to the costume is immaculate.

72
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:27,700
Yeah it's like normal clothes version of Prince Eric is immaculate or something.

73
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:41,340
When I was first back to Disneyland I was like oh people really getting close getting close to the line on some of these Disney bounding things where I was like you you look like a walk around face character like it's like oh really.

74
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:45,720
Yeah well then then they're not bounding if it's something where you go it looks like you're wearing a costume.

75
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:51,340
I think it was just just like clothing enough.

76
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:55,500
I was did you notice that I was bounding as scuttle from the Little Mermaid.

77
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,420
I didn't notice.

78
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,220
Okay well that's what you that's what I want I want it to be very subtle.

79
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,500
I don't want you to notice that I'm.

80
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:06,020
I was dressed like honest John but I got heat stroke from all the wool.

81
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:11,080
The three pieces you're always dressed like I'm always dressed like honest John yeah.

82
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:15,640
And you're always dressed as one of those Disney lakes when you wear that blue shirt.

83
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:19,380
Well the new thing that we hit you for is the blue shirt.

84
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:20,560
All blue.

85
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,000
Set the strap for myself.

86
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:24,740
All bluey.

87
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,000
Has that come out chronologically.

88
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,420
I don't I'm not sure.

89
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:39,520
Well here let me I'm going to I'm going to date it specifically because I could be wrong because I there's a there's a date sensitive reason to be doing this as I alluded to you guys.

90
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:46,260
You insisted and you were very insistent on this coming out on a specific you really wanted to do it for.

91
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:54,500
Why in the world just sounds dangerous with Drew Carey a Disney MGM studios sound demonstration.

92
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,720
Why does this need to happen on this particular day.

93
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:06,140
And I can reveal now why but still with a little bit of mystery all the kind of mystery that Detective Foster would try to crack.

94
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:09,720
But I'm not going to leave too many clues but I am going to say this.

95
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:14,380
So this was done this attraction was really at the height of Drew Carey 1.

96
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:15,000
0.

97
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,100
This was at the height of the success of the Drew Carey show.

98
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:22,940
I think he got in whose line is it anyway on the the king of ABC's in the Disney family.

99
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:27,860
So of course we could get him to crank out this attraction really fast.

100
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:36,820
He now is sort of out of the Disney family and he's moved over to CBS and for a long time he has been the host of The Price is Right where I think he does a fantastic job.

101
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:39,740
Long long career doing that at this point.

102
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,820
And that brings me to this point.

103
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:50,140
So this as you hear this this upcoming Monday June 28th time may vary.

104
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,820
Check your local listings Monday June 28th.

105
00:07:53,440 --> 00:08:02,160
If you tune in to The Price is Right with Drew Carey you may see a member of the podcast The Ride family.

106
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,300
And that is all I'm going to say.

107
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:18,120
Did I abscond with your dog and get him to either be a contestant or be part of the like did I make him do the mountain game.

108
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,040
What's the mountain game.

109
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,040
Oh yeah the climbers.

110
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:21,400
Yeah I made it.

111
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:21,740
I made it.

112
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:22,520
I went and climbed the mountain.

113
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:33,700
No I not at liberty to say but somebody who might be familiar to the podcast The Ride audience may may legally may make an appearance on the show.

114
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:40,960
And again now and again I don't I don't can't say what I know or don't know but you you may want to tune in like really at the top of the show.

115
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:44,340
So find out when it you know because you want to see the come on down you're going to see the come on down.

116
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:47,140
I don't know why I can't I can't elaborate any further.

117
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,460
I have a guess but we'll talk about it after.

118
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:53,100
Yeah yeah no you you might listeners might have a guess.

119
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:57,420
But you know part of me thinks look it's behind a paywall could just say it maybe.

120
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:59,140
But you know there's this.

121
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:00,860
The rules.

122
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:08,020
What if we get like 50,000 new subscribers in the next few days from recording to release.

123
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,940
Then everyone's going to hear about it.

124
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:18,360
All the producers on prices right will hear if suddenly if there's just like oddly a big pocket of listeners at CBS.

125
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,020
Yeah.

126
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:21,140
And this goes all the way up to the top.

127
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,120
I don't know who runs it now.

128
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:23,420
It's not less moon vets.

129
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:24,620
No I don't think so.

130
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,660
Yeah whoever took over Sumner Redstone.

131
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:30,280
His I think it's still his A.

132
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:30,560
I.

133
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:34,500
I think he technically like the pen is still in his hand in the ground.

134
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:35,060
Yeah.

135
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,780
So he's got to sign off on things and this could anger this.

136
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:42,480
This could all make him so angry that it awakens the ghost of Sumner Redstone.

137
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:42,980
Yeah.

138
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:44,060
Bursts out of his grave.

139
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,360
We don't we don't.

140
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:46,820
I had to double check to make sure.

141
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:47,500
Yeah he died.

142
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,080
He did.

143
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,320
He did pass away.

144
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:50,100
Yeah.

145
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,480
I remember that.

146
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:51,720
Yeah.

147
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,780
Finally happened.

148
00:09:52,780 --> 00:10:00,880
Well I kind of forgot too and then he was in the in memoriam in the the Oscars potentially

149
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:06,780
after maybe both Oscars and Emmys and I of course shed some tears to myself.

150
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,280
I also like applauded first of all you're not supposed to applaud for the memoriam.

151
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:16,660
But standing ovation to myself at home then a long cry reflected on Sumner's career.

152
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:17,320
Yeah.

153
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:20,720
And then got scared about how his ghost might haunt me if I anger him.

154
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,920
So don't want any of that.

155
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:26,680
But what I do want is for listeners to tune into.

156
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:27,300
Wow.

157
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:27,700
The prices are right.

158
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,000
Monday June 20th and I.

159
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,760
This is exciting.

160
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,340
That is that is all I can say.

161
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:39,520
But this but that just is if that just using this this Drew Carey relevance as kind of

162
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,800
a Trojan horse to bring up this.

163
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:41,980
Wow.

164
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:43,640
So you're hearing this on Wednesday.

165
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,620
Check it out on Monday.

166
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,280
Wow.

167
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:45,800
Okay.

168
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:47,960
I'll try to tweet and stuff as well.

169
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,780
Very exciting.

170
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:49,300
Yeah.

171
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:49,700
Yeah.

172
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:53,400
Just go through the roll of the could it be a Monday.

173
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:57,840
Could it be a ghost boy floating down the stairs.

174
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,200
Yes.

175
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:06,540
Does he think that like matching up some numbers or a path out of right.

176
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,700
It's still is it Tillman for Tita.

177
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:11,120
Is it you know any is it.

178
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:14,460
I mean I'm not saying this is anyone that we know personally.

179
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:15,660
Right.

180
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:17,300
I think it's basically on his comeback tour.

181
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:20,020
Is it blue.

182
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,540
Is it not Jason's shirt but the alien blue.

183
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,300
Now I'm worried the shirt hasn't come up.

184
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:30,320
When does the shirt might not come up.

185
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:30,700
Okay.

186
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:31,760
Well get ready for it.

187
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,740
It should be right.

188
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:35,400
No but if it's a 28th it's no you're right.

189
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,200
No no no no.

190
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:36,540
Yeah.

191
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:37,700
Well I made a big mistake.

192
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:41,280
Well get ready for it because there's a big reveal of a new recurring.

193
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:44,880
One of our favorite new jokes coming up this Friday.

194
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,400
Yeah.

195
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:45,900
Oh my god.

196
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,020
There's so much to check out.

197
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:47,300
OK.

198
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,360
So check out the reveal of a new thing to make fun of Jason for checkout prices right.

199
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,820
On Monday it's going to be a big long weekend.

200
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:57,160
Everybody I don't I don't I don't think it's going to stick the shirt thing.

201
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,220
What I think there's so much there.

202
00:11:59,240 --> 00:11:59,540
I think it's going to stick.

203
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,180
The idea that you wear a blue shirt.

204
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:01,940
A lot of your neuroses.

205
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,600
No I think I don't think it has legs.

206
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:05,900
This is a big one.

207
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,880
We got to be brewing.

208
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:10,860
It'll be like the I think one of the primaries.

209
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:13,060
It's going to shoot past treats potentially.

210
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:13,800
Yeah.

211
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,800
Oh OK.

212
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:15,620
And then yeah.

213
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:19,760
And we really want if you see Jason don't say hello to him or anything just yell you're

214
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,500
my boy blue Adam from now on.

215
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,220
You'll get the whole picture on that soon.

216
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,380
You'll get all these you get all these pictures soon.

217
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,840
A lot of homework for you the listener.

218
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:35,400
But right now let's focus on the task at hand which is a very strange Disney MGM Studios

219
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:35,820
attraction.

220
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:36,120
Yes.

221
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:39,500
So this is at a this was a theater.

222
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:44,480
Right kind of right as he entered the heart of Disney MGM Studios.

223
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:49,300
You're you know right off to the left of the of the Chinese theater if you're facing the

224
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:55,480
Chinese theater and this like this whole zone when the park opened these were like pretty

225
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,980
big marquee attractions.

226
00:12:56,980 --> 00:13:01,460
They're like here's one that's all about television and we're going to put you the guests in your

227
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:05,500
favorite TV shows and then here's one where we're going to show you all the secrets of

228
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:11,340
of sound of Foley and all that stuff one of those classic attractions where we lost the

229
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:17,120
sound for some reason the famously clumsy post departments that plagued Hollywood they

230
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,060
lost the sound and you the listeners have to fill in the horse clip clops and what have

231
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:21,200
you.

232
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:21,740
Right.

233
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:27,280
And then those early attractions start dying off and I just in general this little alley

234
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:33,760
this like blue building zone the shiny blue building art deco kind of it's been just a

235
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,800
weird run.

236
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,400
Have we covered anything that's that are in these buildings we haven't talked superstar

237
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,060
television.

238
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:39,820
No we didn't do that.

239
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,920
There used to be the animation tour.

240
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:42,980
Right.

241
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,240
But that's not there though.

242
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,700
I'm talking about these two.

243
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:50,880
Oh you know what I mean like the theater show sound show monster sound show which was what

244
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,100
was in this space before.

245
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:56,820
We haven't talked and I forget which is which we haven't talked American Idol experience

246
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:03,900
which birthed the weird thing of like shirts were goofy is supposed to be like Randy Jackson

247
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,260
calling people dog.

248
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:06,280
Right.

249
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,860
Very odd time in the park.

250
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:08,560
Very odd.

251
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:09,900
Where was Millionaire.

252
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:13,340
Was Millionaire here or was it a.

253
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,480
Millionaire I think had its own space.

254
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,940
Was that in a sound that was in a soundstage potentially like in the soundstage district

255
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:20,620
right.

256
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:23,300
Like I feel like this has been like weird sing alongs.

257
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:24,360
What's there now.

258
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:25,040
Do they.

259
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,180
Is it the just Star Wars clips.

260
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:29,380
What replaced this.

261
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:31,420
It was there was a it was a guard.

262
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:34,380
I know it was a Guardians of the Galaxy preview at a certain point.

263
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,400
I think they've used it for a lot of previews.

264
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,840
I think it's yeah it's sort of like what happened to the Captain EO theater.

265
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,440
Uh huh.

266
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:45,340
Seemingly but it's just one of those spaces where they're like we don't know.

267
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:48,020
I mean there wasn't a lot of infrastructure for this show.

268
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:53,160
So it wasn't like they had to probably do a ton to this place to get it ready for a

269
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:53,780
different like.

270
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:57,440
No it was already like a very temp soundstage feeling.

271
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:57,940
Yeah.

272
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:02,840
I don't know that they even replaced to the screen the non high def screen that was still

273
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,940
running past 2009.

274
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:08,060
They might be able to run this show today right now.

275
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:10,620
They may just flick a switch on and the thing is fine.

276
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:11,740
Yeah maybe.

277
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:12,000
Yeah.

278
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,460
By the end of the day get it up.

279
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:14,560
They just need a little heads up.

280
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,100
They got to like put a fake microphone somewhere.

281
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:18,880
Just off some headphones.

282
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,320
Yeah yeah yeah.

283
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,620
Well there you know that's true.

284
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:26,120
We're discounting the special equipment involved in this.

285
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:26,840
Yeah that's true.

286
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:32,840
So what this show was you know the basic premise is that you're watching a new pilot

287
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:38,820
and the pilot is going to involve the use of binaural audio.

288
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,520
Binaural audio which we love on this show.

289
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,360
We discussed binaural audio.

290
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:47,640
If you don't know the sprays off hand long ago we did an episode about great moments

291
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,140
with Mr.

292
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:48,520
Lincoln.

293
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:53,780
They were obsessed with this technology for a while that is very realistic sound 360 degree

294
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:58,220
sound and certain effects that can really make you feel like you're there.

295
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,260
Certain effects.

296
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:00,660
Yeah.

297
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:07,000
Some of which are repeated somehow between a show about Abraham Lincoln and a show where

298
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,260
Drew Carey is a bumbling undercover cop.

299
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:09,760
Yes.

300
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:14,060
And repeated in like little booths kind of in this area.

301
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:19,780
Yeah when the show is done you can go do some of the very same things in weird little pods.

302
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:21,680
Yeah a lot of hair cutting.

303
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,940
Always hair cutting.

304
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,840
That's the one that's the most effective I think.

305
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:26,420
Yeah.

306
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:29,480
Honestly and of course if you remember our episode I think we gave Mr.

307
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:30,420
Sheridan a haircut

308
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:31,560
or no?

309
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:35,660
Sheridan.

310
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:36,380
Oh yes.

311
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:36,900
That's right.

312
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:39,340
That's what our binaural audio was.

313
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:40,780
That was our binaural presentation.

314
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:48,740
Just to get us up to date this building is now as of in the start of 2020 this theater

315
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:50,820
was renamed the Mickey Shorts Theater.

316
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:56,740
The seats were given a Mickey Mouse design and it currently shows the Vacation Fun Mickey

317
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:57,340
Mouse Short.

318
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:59,740
Okay I thought this was just one short.

319
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,220
Well with Runaway we're L.

320
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:01,320
A.

321
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,980
opening I think we're trying to tie it in together but I'm

322
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:05,960
sure yeah.

323
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:12,060
These theater every one of these theaters in Disney parks worldwide have died such sad

324
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:12,360
deaths.

325
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:12,920
Yeah.

326
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:18,480
It's such uncreative like it's just it's where all the synergy happens and the cheapness

327
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:23,260
happens and the laziness happens but Jason as you pointed out it's also where the naps

328
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:23,640
happen.

329
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:26,760
Oh yeah very dark in here very cold.

330
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,060
Perfect antidote for the Florida weather.

331
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:33,980
Yeah yeah yeah which that feels like a hot park too.

332
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:39,360
I mean they're all hot I guess but I don't know our last two is it I felt like it was

333
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,300
pretty scorching there.

334
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:43,020
Yeah I mean it's not as bad as Animal Kingdom.

335
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,640
No it's not the humidity bowl that is Animal Kingdom.

336
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:50,560
But it's still yeah pretty that open area it's still pretty open.

337
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:54,540
I wonder yeah what is the hottest is it is it it's got to be Animal Kingdom I think but.

338
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:55,160
I think so.

339
00:17:55,540 --> 00:18:02,620
The big selling point now you asked is it just one short it's an original short for

340
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:03,360
this area.

341
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:03,840
Oh alright.

342
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,260
Alright now we're talking.

343
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:05,860
Power talker.

344
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,940
And it's a new it's a new style.

345
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,160
That is good yeah.

346
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:12,000
That is better.

347
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:12,780
Alright alright.

348
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:18,540
So yeah it's just it's just one of those I mean they would I guess it's honestly better

349
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:22,800
for these type of things to go away because it's it's easier to just plug something in

350
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:27,960
as opposed to like taking down a ride because you like have to do something with it or just

351
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:28,700
sits there.

352
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:29,200
Yeah.

353
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:29,540
Yeah.

354
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:31,020
It gets sadder and sadder.

355
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,800
I understand why these things happen.

356
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:38,180
I understand this is the most like on paper kind of attraction like we have this technology

357
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:40,120
and we want to do stuff do something with it.

358
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:44,760
The old thing the Chevy Chase Martin shirt things filling a little old.

359
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:47,900
Drew Carey is extremely popular right now.

360
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:54,780
So pop you forget how big the Drew Carey show was how his salary got up to seven hundred

361
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:56,560
fifty thousand an episode.

362
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:57,880
Oh my god.

363
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,960
How much did the friend wasn't that's like getting towards like friends.

364
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,080
Friends made a million.

365
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:03,680
By the end.

366
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:04,140
Yeah.

367
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:09,460
Which like I think the cultural impact of Drew Carey show is muddied a little bit because

368
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:12,220
I the other day I was like so where do you watch it.

369
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:12,900
Is it on.

370
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:17,780
Is it on Disney plus because it's like and the answer is it's nowhere.

371
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:22,580
It's one of those ghost shows really in all the all the platforms that have lined up nowhere

372
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:24,260
has the Drew Carey show.

373
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,400
That's odd.

374
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:25,880
Yeah.

375
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:28,980
And there's been no chatter of bringing it back.

376
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,180
No it's the rare.

377
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,240
That is interesting.

378
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:34,900
He's too busy and rich and fulfilled and happy.

379
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,000
He seems like a guy.

380
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,320
I feel like the reports are good about Drew Carey.

381
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,400
And he's I know he's a Parks fan.

382
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:41,700
Is that so.

383
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:42,460
I believe so.

384
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,000
I think he's a really nice guy.

385
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,640
The reputation is during the writer's strike.

386
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:51,060
I believe he said he paid for everyone's lunch.

387
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:55,560
If you showed your writers guild card at Bob's Big Boy.

388
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:57,980
Your lunch was covered by Drew Carey.

389
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:58,660
Wow.

390
00:19:58,740 --> 00:19:59,120
Wow.

391
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,420
Hey that's pretty good.

392
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:02,540
He was friendly with a friend.

393
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:05,240
He was a friendly with a guy we know a friend of ours.

394
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:12,320
If he interacted with anyone that we might know that he might have been very nice in

395
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,280
that setting.

396
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,080
But I don't know.

397
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:14,740
I don't know.

398
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:15,980
Don't sue me Sumner.

399
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:17,780
I don't know what I'm talking about.

400
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:18,780
I'm crazy today.

401
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:26,080
But so if he is a nice guy and a Parks fan and this all seems to be true.

402
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,820
How has he been done so dirty by the.

403
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:35,200
Like he's in two attractions and you'd have to think that both of these attractions are

404
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,960
in the running for one of them obviously is Superstar limo.

405
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:43,600
He's a robot in it and he's displaying maps to the stars home.

406
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:47,500
We've covered this and then there's this whole thing that is devoted to him.

407
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:51,500
I don't know how you guys feel about this attraction to me revisiting it.

408
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:56,600
I'm like I think both of the things Drew is in are like in the conversation for 10 worst

409
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,320
attractions.

410
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:58,900
Good question.

411
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:00,880
Yeah.

412
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,100
As a kid I went on it once and I was just terrified.

413
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,380
I thought something was going to hurt.

414
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:07,480
I thought something would hurt me during the show.

415
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,160
You weren't joking about that.

416
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,160
Not joking at all.

417
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,640
What made you think that?

418
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,620
Because we were in the dark and I knew like once in a while they'd have like a chair that

419
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:15,980
would poke you or something.

420
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:18,980
And like I just remember being stressed out the whole time.

421
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:19,180
Yeah.

422
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:20,220
That was not a joke.

423
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:27,240
So I was watching this rewatching it on YouTube and I had no memory of the actual contents

424
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,320
of the actual show.

425
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,100
You don't say.

426
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,260
Believe it or not.

427
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:35,500
And I think partly at least because I was scared.

428
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:38,540
Now you may also say the show is a bit unmemorable.

429
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:42,680
But maybe I would have thought I would have remembered some element of it.

430
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:48,340
But yeah I was just but anytime the lights got shut off I was kind of freaked out.

431
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:54,780
So and then yeah and then I was like I remember I'm trying to think like tough to be a bug

432
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:57,140
would stress me out because it would touch like it would hit me.

433
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:57,880
It would like touch me.

434
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,040
I was older at that point.

435
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:00,240
People don't like bugs.

436
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,620
Little bug pokes were weird.

437
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:06,680
I think I was a big enough nerd that I knew like well this is where the this is like the

438
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:09,640
audio annex like this is this is always audio.

439
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,240
Brother this is the audio.

440
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,420
Brother I OK.

441
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,460
I wouldn't say that as a child.

442
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:15,420
I'm saying that now.

443
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:19,240
But I had gone to enough attractions here that I'm like oh it's usually a headphone

444
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:19,600
thing.

445
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,760
It's usually an audio thing.

446
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:23,320
And I like little here's the little tricks of how they make movies.

447
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:26,940
I'm an audiophile but their mother it's a studio.

448
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,900
We're not likely to be poked in here.

449
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:33,300
Not poked or there would be no books brother but there will be audio treats for your ears.

450
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:40,220
I insisted to like exiting going in the booths like I've got to do that.

451
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:41,260
I got to do the booth.

452
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:46,760
You know yeah yeah I think I did them and then left them usually like I think I got

453
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:47,260
it.

454
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:49,020
This is longer than 50 seconds.

455
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:55,840
It's not the memory that like maybe Jason's you're proving this wrong but it's I feel

456
00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:00,040
like did anyone leave Disney World like that once every three or four year trip that like

457
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:04,800
we would take as a family like and go and then there was the time when I thought my

458
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:10,960
hair was being cut like was that ever in the top 10 memories as far as experiences.

459
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,920
I have had conversations about the haircut.

460
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:14,700
Yeah I have had conversations.

461
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:15,640
But that's you.

462
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:16,880
Yeah no no.

463
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,660
I'm saying you ask anyone.

464
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:19,760
I am a person.

465
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:20,180
I know I'm asking.

466
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:20,780
That's what I'm asking.

467
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:21,960
I'm saying you can prove it.

468
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:23,440
I was just delighted by anything.

469
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:26,540
I just like all the Hollywood stuff at MGM studios.

470
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:30,480
Well you because you did you feel like you were part of the movie making apparatus.

471
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:31,880
Yes I did.

472
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,300
Yeah I would.

473
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,160
I bought it.

474
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,020
I loved it.

475
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:36,140
I was proud.

476
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,900
Proud member of the crew.

477
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:39,400
I liked a lot of it too.

478
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:43,300
I'm just saying this particular thing was scary to me and then also wasn't like something

479
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:46,920
We got to get back to Disney World so we can get our fake haircut.

480
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,880
Yeah like that's all I'm saying.

481
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:55,020
No I feel like people are like coming in and out of this thing like it's a bus depot.

482
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,500
Like you're just milling in.

483
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,420
What is it?

484
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:58,040
Watch it.

485
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,980
Don't laugh or smile or respond.

486
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:00,740
What was that?

487
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:03,560
Oh so that wasn't the tower thing?

488
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:04,400
No that's over there.

489
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,640
Okay let's get to that.

490
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:06,960
We made a mistake.

491
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:11,720
That's how I feel like the Florida audience must have regarded this.

492
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:14,940
It's going to be interesting because people might be furious at us and I don't really

493
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:17,800
have a sense of it because people don't talk about it.

494
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:22,100
People aren't often talking about Sounds Dangerous so it'll be interesting to see if like half

495
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:25,360
the listeners are like go to hell Carlson.

496
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,160
What is this shit?

497
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:28,180
I loved it.

498
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:34,380
Again we cannot understand this is a park that has always had a limited number of attractions

499
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:42,480
so like when everything's 45 to an hour plus wait a place you can walk in and sit down

500
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,180
and it's air conditioned and cold sure and maybe there's a little show and you want to

501
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:49,100
be entertained but it's air conditioned and cold and you can sit.

502
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:53,580
I think that's probably a big positive memory for people.

503
00:24:54,580 --> 00:25:00,680
I would put air conditioning in Florida in my top 20 of the nice things about it and

504
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,260
that's all the air conditioning.

505
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:07,000
You know Carousel of Progress air conditioning is one but I would lump it all in.

506
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:12,080
I don't think we could do an air conditioning final four for Florida because so much of

507
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:12,720
it is similar.

508
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:13,680
It's all equal.

509
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:14,960
It's existing.

510
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:24,120
I loved my pop century like all hard surfaces room just blasting AC all day even though

511
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:28,300
we weren't there so we could walk in and feel like we were stepping into a refrigerator.

512
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:29,000
That's right.

513
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:29,860
God bless it.

514
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,180
It was my favorite thing.

515
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:34,420
It's the most utilitarian hotel room I've ever stayed in.

516
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:35,020
Yeah extremely.

517
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:36,480
Like most amount of shelves and hooks.

518
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,740
But all hard surfaces.

519
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:39,820
It's a lot of hard surfaces.

520
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:42,720
It's all so much cold particles bouncing off each other.

521
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,460
I love it.

522
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:49,000
I don't want any soft couches or anything comforting a cloth painting that isn't going

523
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,700
to do that AC bouncing for me.

524
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:52,600
Hard.

525
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:53,380
All hard.

526
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,780
I want like a Lego room.

527
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:59,380
I'm not sure how I feel about all this fake wood fake vinyl flooring they put into the

528
00:25:59,380 --> 00:25:59,980
hotels.

529
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:01,120
Oh I don't know anything.

530
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,220
I know it's more sanitary.

531
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,100
It's more sad.

532
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,580
A lot of hotel design now.

533
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:10,300
It's like fake hard wood because it's easier to clean than carpet.

534
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:13,580
But sometimes I'm like I kind of like carpet.

535
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:15,280
But well but yeah.

536
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,420
Hotel carpet is disgusting.

537
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,240
Yeah you run out.

538
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:18,820
It's a real.

539
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:20,020
I get what you're saying.

540
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:26,300
I'm a carpet fan all day but hotel carpet if we really analyze it it's gross.

541
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:26,760
Yeah.

542
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:27,580
It's got to be gross.

543
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:27,980
Yeah.

544
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:31,600
I was parroting my parents opinion for a long time.

545
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:34,840
Like but don't you like a carpet isn't it kind of you know it's kind of nice and comforting

546
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:35,580
don't you think.

547
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:39,780
And I said that to somebody once who was like no disgusting wrong.

548
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:41,960
There is a reason we've all switched.

549
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:42,980
Yeah sure.

550
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:44,880
Because I do like you know I don't know.

551
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:46,760
We are well kept up carpet maybe.

552
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:47,140
Sure.

553
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:53,160
But I realized how I sounded out loud in that I was I was carpet shamed.

554
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:57,240
You were carpet shamed but you were also carpet parroting as well you think.

555
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,320
Yeah yeah yeah.

556
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,760
It was a stolen opinion.

557
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:01,800
It was like clearly something I just borrowed from.

558
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:02,360
Uh huh.

559
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:03,960
Yeah because it's not you know it's nice.

560
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,460
It's what we grew up with.

561
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:06,300
Yeah.

562
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:07,400
Comforts are home.

563
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:08,100
Uh huh.

564
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:12,360
It's also really easy to let it go for a while.

565
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:15,480
Like it can be there years after it should have been changed.

566
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:18,800
And then when you have to change it it's the biggest pain in the ass in the world.

567
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:22,000
This isn't an episode about carpets but let me real quick sometimes you get the hotel

568
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,500
carpets or even carpets in general that it's like barely carpet.

569
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:30,360
If we're doing carpet let's do carpet where it's like cushy and it feels good and especially

570
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,680
if you got your bare feet on it it's like oh that's nice.

571
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:36,800
But like often times it's just like that flat nothing carpet.

572
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:37,420
Yeah.

573
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:40,420
That's like coarse and like what's the point.

574
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:43,600
Yeah like an uncomfortable rug.

575
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,840
Right and like that might not be there.

576
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,760
It may have been stepped on so many times.

577
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:51,060
That's possible but that's obviously then you need to replace it and if we're going

578
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:53,300
to do that then just put the hardwood in at that point.

579
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:53,860
Yeah.

580
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:58,380
I grew up in a house that I guess my parents were big carpet people.

581
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:03,300
This is the carpet parroting that I grew up in a house with bright green carpet everywhere

582
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:05,960
because my dad wanted it to be like a putting green.

583
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:07,760
That's very fun.

584
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:14,380
So I lived in like a mini golf course basically until like two years ago they changed it.

585
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,080
It was very cool.

586
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:18,020
Really did he like putt inside the house a lot.

587
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:18,420
Yeah.

588
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:19,100
Yep.

589
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:19,860
Wow.

590
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:22,080
Like an 80s executive.

591
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,440
That's like an imagineered house that you had.

592
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:25,180
A little bit.

593
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:25,520
Yeah.

594
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:29,260
I mean it was a little so it wasn't like pure it wasn't like lime green.

595
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,560
It wasn't a green that made you nauseous.

596
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:35,220
But yeah definitely was meant to evoke golf course.

597
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:35,680
Oh wow.

598
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:36,520
That's interesting.

599
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,900
Wait I want to do a survey real quick.

600
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:41,440
We'll get back to the attraction real quick.

601
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:46,140
Did you guys ever have a carpeted bathroom in your childhood homes?

602
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,120
No.

603
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:51,300
Because that was a design style that we had on and off.

604
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:53,840
I can't believe that exists anywhere.

605
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:58,840
We were looking at a place to we were thinking about a place that had that and we were like

606
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:01,380
well that's a strike one.

607
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:08,340
And it was like big like that was it was like huge it was like like big long dog hair.

608
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:12,860
That was hugely popular hugely popular in the suburbs for a while.

609
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:14,100
It is very strange.

610
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:21,180
It might be yeah maybe the cold winters like but the minute a tub overflows or a toilet

611
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:25,340
you're like fucked you immediately like oh great now I have to pee.

612
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,760
Ricochet pee goes everywhere.

613
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:32,220
Every time you step out of the shower you've got that like well that'll be wet overnight.

614
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:34,480
Yeah that's madness.

615
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:39,940
Yeah but our parents loved carpeting and I grew up also loving carpeting.

616
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:41,300
Yeah yeah.

617
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:46,660
No it made me angry to see in person several years ago when I did yeah yeah.

618
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,660
Like no scarring.

619
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:49,800
That's interesting.

620
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:53,500
That's just it should be ashamed those people who put it in.

621
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:58,620
Well you're right it's not about carpeting though we're happy to share our carpeting

622
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:00,320
thoughts if you wish to hear more.

623
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:07,580
We're talking about we're talking about Sounds Dangerous which is a show that you step into

624
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:11,640
and then immediately are told welcome to undercover live.

625
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,700
Okay so what is it then?

626
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:14,620
Undercover live.

627
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:18,920
The show has two names so I don't even I don't remember what happens before they press play

628
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:22,880
on the thing but I guess they convey you come in and you put on your headphones as we said

629
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,540
that's an important step.

630
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:34,780
Put on your headphones and you are told that this is a new pilot setting and then a title

631
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:41,720
comes up that says undercover live in the cheapest font the most iMovie that like the

632
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:45,620
stock effect where like a light is blasting through and the light moves from the left

633
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:46,320
to the right.

634
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:52,280
It is such iMovie template like shockingly poor font.

635
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:58,660
This oh wait and in an attraction that already has this is finally my opportunity to really

636
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:05,000
address something I've talked about before and I truly despise like where cool 90s aesthetics

637
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:11,260
started disappearing started going away and gave way to the ABC yellow the worst.

638
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:14,580
We'll post this somewhere this is what I was referencing earlier.

639
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:21,640
Drew Carey is an undercover cop sounds dangerous and it's in that gross yellow horrible black

640
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:28,020
on yellow font that ABC did all their advertising with where you know that was boiled down to

641
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:29,460
like we like TV.

642
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:33,120
TV's been going a while and there haven't been any world wars since.

643
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:34,920
Guess TV must be good.

644
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:40,520
These like snotty kind of like almost like rip off of adult swim title card just the

645
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:41,040
worst.

646
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,700
This might have come first though.

647
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:48,840
The I think that I think they were using this scheme the scheme the black on yellow scheme

648
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,620
did not come from this attraction.

649
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:54,080
Oh no no but the adult swim title cards I think came after.

650
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:57,500
Oh maybe this yeah when did they.

651
00:31:57,620 --> 00:32:00,040
Adult swim around 2000 I think.

652
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,100
Maybe yeah yeah yeah.

653
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:06,040
But I started is it is it typewriter font too is it courier like this kind of font.

654
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:06,860
Yeah it is not.

655
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:13,140
It's like a bad like asymmetrical like if you look at the edges of it it's all like

656
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:17,200
bulbous and undulating and like it's not all even but not in a good way not in like

657
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,520
the way it feels handwritten.

658
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:21,800
It just feels like poorly supervised.

659
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:24,600
Right I can't I don't know exactly what bothers me.

660
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,160
I think that's it.

661
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:31,540
They can't decide if it's typewriter or handwritten and just the black on yellow does not work.

662
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:35,620
Maybe a bumblebee might like it but not me.

663
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:39,100
I'll tell you that much bumblebees we factor into this attraction.

664
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,460
Awful poster.

665
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:42,240
These fonts are bad.

666
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:48,160
Oh and oh my god on the marquee of this where Drew Carey's smiling real big at you.

667
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:50,240
Look what we got over here.

668
00:32:50,760 --> 00:33:00,000
Comic Sans bright yellow comic sans written over like creases on a building which is what

669
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:00,980
turquoise.

670
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:05,140
Yellow on turquoise and it's a font that doesn't appear anywhere else.

671
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:10,080
Just like this is where I you know I'm an aesthetics person I'm a fonts person some

672
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,080
of the worst ever.

673
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:16,860
Some of this is not the most sought out because Drew Carey's outfit makes him look like a

674
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:19,540
like security guard or like a California highway.

675
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,460
He's like the Carl Winslow.

676
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:26,080
Yeah he does not look like a detective usually is portrayed in media.

677
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:31,160
Well in an undercover cop would not be wearing this jacket or a band.

678
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,160
This is not Serpico.

679
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:39,880
Yeah there's a lot aesthetically there's like there's 90s Disney we've talked about

680
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:43,740
this on the show Disney World like when you see some of the signs still when you're driving

681
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:47,520
into places that's like that teal and purple and roads.

682
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:48,740
Just the street signs.

683
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:49,400
Yeah.

684
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:53,900
Street signs are great and like so much of Blizzard Beach you go feels just like they

685
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,320
haven't changed a thing since the 90s.

686
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,480
That stuff is great.

687
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:59,700
But then there's this like other I don't know what you would call it.

688
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:01,260
I don't know if we named it on the show before.

689
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:07,780
There's this really unpleasant aesthetic and it's like maybe the most this era is the most

690
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:09,560
unpleasant aesthetically.

691
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:13,120
Nothing remain nothing's kept up that looks like this.

692
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:15,160
Yeah it's all been torn down rightfully so.

693
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:18,960
It's trying to have an edge but there's no purpose.

694
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:20,200
There's no vision.

695
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:21,220
Well sure that's true.

696
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:26,320
Trying to be current and modern and then they I feel like gave up at a certain point

697
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:26,800
of that.

698
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:31,960
Yeah and it's like it's all part of it's still part of Superstar limo I feel like aesthetically

699
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:32,520
in a way.

700
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,080
I think City Walk was still kind of using this vibe the kind of thing where it's like

701
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:41,920
there's a bunch of like film burnouts and things are shifting in and out of focus.

702
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:42,440
Yeah.

703
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:46,340
As titles that you can't fully see go by and it'll be all lowercase.

704
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:48,800
Like that was edgy somehow to people.

705
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:50,780
We didn't put any capital letters in.

706
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:52,160
We broke a rule.

707
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:53,820
What's how chill we are.

708
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,720
No need to use a capital letter.

709
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:58,080
Who's shouting not us.

710
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,000
I anything like that.

711
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:05,080
I feel like my high school yearbook had like a here's what pop culture was at the time

712
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:05,960
and it was like that.

713
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:08,060
There was a thing called Channel One News.

714
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,320
Did you guys get Channel One News.

715
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:15,620
I vaguely was this supposed to be like a hip news network for teens.

716
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:20,800
Yeah they aired it in high schools and it was a deal with a bunch of schools to like

717
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:26,660
we'll give you TVs if you play our news show and also we've made ad deals so there will

718
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:28,640
be Eminem ads in your classroom.

719
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:33,260
It was a way to get commercials into classrooms which my high school and middle school did.

720
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:35,980
It's the most egregious looking back.

721
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:40,220
I have so many memories of like wait those free book covers they would give us for textbooks.

722
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:45,100
I was like that was an ad for Chex Mix or like the planners.

723
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:49,480
It's like hey everyone here's a here's a free planner and you can write what activities

724
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,720
you have today or what homework assignments you have today.

725
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:57,540
I was like wait there sure was a lot of ads in that for like yes Snickers and new TV shows.

726
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:01,260
Like it was practically a copy of Entertainment Weekly.

727
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:05,820
It's an ad for two guys a girl and a pizza place on this planner.

728
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:14,080
Yeah I voting for we I do remember us all doing the Pepsi challenge and then also voting

729
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:19,180
for the new color of Eminem which I was very excited when Blue won.

730
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:20,320
Is that true?

731
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:21,780
Oh yeah I was.

732
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:22,600
I voted for Blue.

733
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:23,060
You were cheering for Blue.

734
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:24,600
Yeah I was voting for Blue.

735
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,140
I guess yeah you just really love Blue.

736
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:27,200
I do love Blue.

737
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:27,820
You're my boy.

738
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:30,120
I like how this is all a prequel.

739
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:30,580
Yeah right.

740
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:31,440
Now to a bit.

741
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:32,700
It's a prequel.

742
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,320
But made after the original.

743
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,640
But like yeah Blue M&Ms replaced Brown M&Ms I think.

744
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:37,700
And you were part of that.

745
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:39,000
I was part of it.

746
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,440
You raised your voice.

747
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:43,060
We handed out branded branded ballots.

748
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:46,840
I think they used it to show us how voting worked.

749
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:51,560
I heard you canvassed door to door for Blue during that election.

750
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,940
I rat fucked Purple.

751
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:59,120
You and Lee Atwater or Carl Roe who was Lee Atwater still alive at that point?

752
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:02,860
Parked a garbage truck in front of the ballot drop off so people wouldn't know where it

753
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:03,060
was.

754
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,940
You push pulled Brown M&M.

755
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:10,720
Carl Roe got all his practice on this high school M&M campaign.

756
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:12,540
And the Daley family.

757
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:14,260
You know you were from Chicago area.

758
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:14,640
I am from yeah.

759
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:15,480
I know them.

760
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:16,720
Did some dirty tricks.

761
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:26,320
Jason was the Lee Atwater or Carl Roe of the M&M pick the next color campaign.

762
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:30,120
Dumped a bunch of fuchsia's in a river.

763
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:34,680
Eight year old me talking with Roy Cohn and a young Roger Stone.

764
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:40,000
Oh man you got to get back in the game Jason.

765
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:42,120
There's got to be another candy election coming soon.

766
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:43,740
Oh yeah.

767
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,300
No mail in ballots.

768
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:48,340
If you care about it go in in person.

769
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,840
You and Mike Lindell can team up.

770
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:54,880
I'm still mad they brought Crispy M&Ms back but they couldn't make the bag blue anymore

771
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:57,140
because pretzel M&Ms were blue and now it's green.

772
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:58,540
That really throws me.

773
00:37:58,580 --> 00:37:59,840
I love pretzel M&Ms.

774
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,380
Oh I love Crispy M&Ms.

775
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:02,260
Those are good too.

776
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:05,420
No I mean they're good.

777
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:09,280
And come back.

778
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:10,260
Yeah right now.

779
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:10,900
All right.

780
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,160
How quickly would Scott be in the hospital if he ate like you and I did.

781
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:17,520
Too much of a shift.

782
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:19,220
Too much of a shock to the system.

783
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:20,160
Yeah it's a good question.

784
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,120
We should switch diets for a week.

785
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:28,380
Well I do always whenever this comes up when you talk about like I don't know Scott why

786
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:30,300
don't you eat sugar cereal.

787
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:36,800
Why don't you eat like you know things encrusted with free pebbles for every meal.

788
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,840
But then also in every episode you're talking about how you're dying.

789
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:45,120
Like every time you go to a theme park it's always like I couldn't walk anymore and my

790
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,360
stomach was giving out.

791
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:49,540
We don't take care of ourselves we injure ourselves.

792
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:51,900
I said I just wasn't in theme park shape again.

793
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:55,340
I by the way I'd like to officially announce I am back in theme park shape.

794
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:56,240
Yeah I'm getting there.

795
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:58,180
Yeah I was just saying that first time.

796
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:01,740
You were vanquished by sunscreen so like.

797
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,400
Yeah yeah but I'm just saying the first couple times I was like oof.

798
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:09,700
Not just recently though I feel like if you did a super cut of stomach issues of like

799
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:15,300
clutching your side and morning pains and the health concerns on this show are amazing.

800
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:19,840
How many junk food based accounts do you follow on Instagram that track new junk food offerings.

801
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:22,480
Hmm that could be a zero.

802
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:23,900
I follow a handful.

803
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,840
Any like ones that track new fast food offerings.

804
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:28,140
I can't say I do.

805
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:30,300
Jason can you share those with me because I'm interested.

806
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:32,340
I mean some of them you've sent me.

807
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,620
But we'll cross check our list.

808
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:35,780
I just want to make sure yeah.

809
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:37,520
Look it's more fun what you're doing.

810
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:44,440
I'm just saying note the connection between the health complaints and the complaints about

811
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,780
what I don't eat.

812
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:46,860
I see what you're saying.

813
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:51,960
Yeah I have to remember I've forgotten most of any ailments theme park related ailments.

814
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:54,200
There's been a couple of food incidents.

815
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:55,380
Incidences.

816
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:56,700
Is that a word.

817
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:57,880
Wouldn't be.

818
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,420
Incidents would be the incidences.

819
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:00,840
Okay well whatever.

820
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:06,860
Yeah there's been a few of those but we'll if somebody would be a deer and go back and

821
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:09,140
cut those together so I can see.

822
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,580
Help the host run a physical on themselves.

823
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:14,280
I need to see exactly how many how many times.

824
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:18,320
But I would like to declare I'm back in theme park shape and I continue to beat Zach Reno

825
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:18,800
at tennis.

826
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:21,180
My tennis skills are back as well.

827
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:23,840
Jason wearing blue shirts is the new thing.

828
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:26,080
Mike constantly saying he plays tennis.

829
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:29,280
Mike saying tennis in almost every episode is the new thing.

830
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:33,080
These are these are your post pandemic changes.

831
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:34,120
I hope you enjoy them.

832
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:36,120
My Achilles tendon is a bit sore.

833
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,820
But that's not a theme park shape issue.

834
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,740
Not a theme park shape issue a tennis issue.

835
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:41,240
Got it.

836
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:43,460
Okay sounds dangerous with Drew Carey.

837
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:48,360
So they they show you on this poster in these horrible fonts the kind of things you're going

838
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:48,920
to be dealing with.

839
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,460
This is no regular undercover cop.

840
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:52,800
He's wearing prescription glasses.

841
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:53,820
Well that's just a regular thing.

842
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:54,560
That's not magical.

843
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:58,580
He's got a hidden microphone and it's in his ear and that's where the binaural audio is

844
00:40:58,580 --> 00:40:59,100
coming from.

845
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:00,580
He's got a spy camera.

846
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:03,540
It's in his little it's in the top of his jacket.

847
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:08,460
He's got a secret decoder ring which I cannot recall an instance of this coming up and sounds

848
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:08,860
dangerous.

849
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:10,180
It's not used.

850
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,620
No no no.

851
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:13,460
I didn't realize that until right now.

852
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:14,480
Does not come into play.

853
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,440
Don't worry about it.

854
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,880
It's like an appendix.

855
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:18,580
It's not so it doesn't serve any function.

856
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:19,140
Yeah.

857
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:21,740
So that's what the show is.

858
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:25,840
You meet Sharon Brooks the director of undercover live.

859
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:30,800
We'd also love to see some Sharon Brooks costumes at future live shows.

860
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:35,140
Sharon Brooks and she lets you know that they're going to be following Detective Aran.

861
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:36,720
So it's a pilot but it's live.

862
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:39,980
It's the rare pilot that is live and for no audience.

863
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:40,340
Right.

864
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:45,520
And she's assures us that the camera that I feel like this a real 1999 relic.

865
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,540
The camera is high res.

866
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:49,380
This is pretty weird.

867
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:53,320
I feel like a lot of stuff was advertised as high res.

868
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:55,480
Pre high def.

869
00:41:55,960 --> 00:42:00,460
You know which everything we have now is so much higher res than anything that was ever

870
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:01,260
called high res.

871
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:06,660
So we have what this is a show where you watch things shot on a camera that is so much worse

872
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:07,920
than your phone today.

873
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:08,760
Yes.

874
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:11,100
It makes it a rough watch now.

875
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:13,860
Also a super sensitive microphone they say.

876
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:18,240
So we're justifying that we're going to get this little audio demonstration and then we

877
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:23,560
meet Detective Charlie Foster who right away.

878
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:27,980
So the reality of it is you're watching a live pilot that only you are seeing.

879
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:32,260
You're watching it in a room in a theme park that is equipped with headphones.

880
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:36,040
There is a detective that you're going to follow around with a super sensitive microphone

881
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:36,960
and where is the detective?

882
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,820
He is in a snow globe factory.

883
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:39,400
Yes.

884
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:42,380
And you're tossed right into this because they cut to the feet of the camera and it's

885
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:43,080
only static.

886
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:43,800
Oh my God.

887
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:46,720
The high res camera is not showing anything yet.

888
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:52,660
Oh that's because old goofball Charlie Foster is messing around and futson with the snow

889
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:52,920
globe.

890
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:54,060
That's the reality.

891
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:56,640
It's a it's a detective in a snow globe factory.

892
00:42:56,980 --> 00:42:58,820
You know of course.

893
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:03,220
I just at this point already just where are we.

894
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:04,060
What is this.

895
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:04,500
Yeah.

896
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:05,300
What is the show.

897
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:06,320
It's like that.

898
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:12,680
They canceled the show because you know it's I never saw that that live version of cops

899
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:14,080
was called live PD.

900
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:16,940
This is almost unbelievable.

901
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:17,760
Yeah.

902
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:18,320
Yeah.

903
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:22,060
This is like this is like an early version of it I guess where you just all of a sudden

904
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:23,740
thrust into the action.

905
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:24,840
You're just right there.

906
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:25,220
Yeah.

907
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:29,040
You can watch Detective Foster plant a drop gun on a suspect.

908
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:34,640
While he's wearing a t shirt that says yes I am an undercover cop.

909
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:40,620
So blue lives matter grumpy shirt.

910
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:47,040
Jason cannot wear a blue lives matter shirt.

911
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:48,780
Oh come on.

912
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:49,440
Let's.

913
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:50,420
Oh man.

914
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:54,160
Prequel.

915
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:54,980
Prequel.

916
00:43:55,220 --> 00:43:55,400
Prequel.

917
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:57,060
Yeah really.

918
00:43:57,060 --> 00:43:57,880
OK.

919
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:03,520
So this is it's a we're undercover at a place where snow globes are being used to smuggle

920
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:06,720
something that much of the mystery has been cracked.

921
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:07,620
Snow globe.

922
00:44:07,620 --> 00:44:07,800
Right.

923
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:09,800
This is an operation.

924
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:12,360
Somehow crimes are involved with snow globes.

925
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:16,540
And he's trying to find a guy named Lefty Moreno.

926
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:19,360
He's trying to find a villain from 1928.

927
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:19,640
Yeah.

928
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:21,280
Weird things already.

929
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:22,800
Dick Tracy's all too many.

930
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:23,320
There is.

931
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:26,260
This is like this is a no straight men scenario.

932
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:27,840
Every detail is weird.

933
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:30,780
There's never a reality planted in this.

934
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:34,980
So he gets caught right away.

935
00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:40,940
This undercover cop probably because he's in a in a place he's not supposed to be making

936
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:42,920
no effort to disguise himself or hide.

937
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:46,360
So he very quickly is caught and he panics.

938
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:47,220
What do I do.

939
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:50,920
He hides his undercover camera in his mouth.

940
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:54,880
And then we get the point of view of Drew Carey's mouth.

941
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:59,180
So if you want to see what the back of his teeth might look like, it's still kind of

942
00:44:59,180 --> 00:44:59,400
dark.

943
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:00,380
You get to see that.

944
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:05,100
It's like the Walter Mathau Dennis the Menace shot when he shoots Dennis shoots.

945
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:06,440
You know, does they do what they do?

946
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:07,200
A mouth POV?

947
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:11,860
Well, they built a big fake mouth and Dennis like shoot something with a slingshot into

948
00:45:11,860 --> 00:45:12,280
Walter.

949
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:13,720
Walter Mathau's mouth.

950
00:45:13,780 --> 00:45:14,160
Wow.

951
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:16,260
It's a famous shot.

952
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:21,440
Was that Dennis the Menace superior piece or was it like 1992?

953
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:23,400
Was the movie set in 1990?

954
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:27,220
Sort of in like every town America whenever.

955
00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:27,720
Yeah.

956
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:28,280
Yeah.

957
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:31,220
Now he didn't time travel like the Brady Bunch.

958
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:32,060
Oh, right.

959
00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:32,260
Yeah.

960
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:33,320
Wasn't a relic.

961
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:38,920
So the undercover mission has not gone well already.

962
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:43,740
He has already taken the high tech gear and gotten it wet in his mouth.

963
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:45,060
So it starts to short out.

964
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:50,720
That is two minutes into this attraction, which has been built to you as it's the Drew

965
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:51,700
Carey thing.

966
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:52,960
There is his face.

967
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:54,120
You see his face.

968
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:55,900
Get ready to see his face.

969
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:58,700
And then the attraction continues for 10 more minutes.

970
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:03,080
That is all audio where you do not see Drew Carey's face.

971
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:06,400
So good for him for getting it.

972
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:09,700
Like he got off real easy in terms of the shoot of this thing.

973
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:11,580
Yes, that's true.

974
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:13,960
I forgot my memory of it.

975
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:18,120
I don't I was saying I don't remember much of it, but if you had told me, oh, do you

976
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:19,020
ever see anybody?

977
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:20,000
I would have said no.

978
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:21,220
I've never seen any characters.

979
00:46:21,750 --> 00:46:25,680
So like my memory, like I don't it's the whole thing was that way.

980
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:27,980
But obviously it's good because it quickly went to black.

981
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:29,180
Yes, that's true.

982
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:32,560
It pops out to sort of establish where you are.

983
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:34,860
Yeah, he's driving and you see a little of that.

984
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:37,740
But it definitely feels like they shot all the footage in one day.

985
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:40,840
Yeah, one day shoot one day in the audio booth.

986
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:42,560
Yeah, yeah, extremely.

987
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:48,580
So then you're off on this little adventure with him and he's snooping around this office

988
00:46:48,580 --> 00:46:50,060
where he's not supposed to be.

989
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:54,040
And you hear a stapler, which you hear really loud.

990
00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:58,500
I guess he puts it up to his own ear to make sure that it is a stapler.

991
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:03,420
Yes, to demonstrate this technology, he does really strange things

992
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:07,420
just so we can get a little bit of a taste of some object.

993
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:08,260
It didn't occur to me.

994
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:08,720
It's all right now.

995
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:09,040
Yeah.

996
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:14,000
If we're hearing it this well, that means he's sticking his ear up so close to his ear.

997
00:47:14,180 --> 00:47:14,580
Yeah.

998
00:47:14,620 --> 00:47:17,480
I mean, even your silliest detective.

999
00:47:18,220 --> 00:47:19,100
Who would?

1000
00:47:20,060 --> 00:47:23,280
Maybe they have justified that he is a little hard of hearing

1001
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:24,220
and he has to.

1002
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:25,140
This is the only way.

1003
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:28,140
But even then, why do you need to confirm?

1004
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:30,980
Maybe if you were checking, are there any staples in the stapler?

1005
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:34,200
But besides that, yeah, don't put your ear close to it.

1006
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:37,040
Unless he's doing like a funny gag or he's using it as a phone.

1007
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:38,180
Yeah.

1008
00:47:38,180 --> 00:47:39,300
But he's not doing that either.

1009
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:41,200
I don't believe what he's making.

1010
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:44,900
Inspector Clouseau look like Hercule Poirot.

1011
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:45,600
Huh?

1012
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:46,160
Right.

1013
00:47:47,060 --> 00:47:50,800
Because he's so silly that Inspector Clouseau looks very competent.

1014
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:51,160
Yeah.

1015
00:47:51,580 --> 00:47:51,720
Detective.

1016
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:52,300
Oh, right.

1017
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:52,980
Yes.

1018
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:54,200
Yes, you're right.

1019
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:55,960
That should have been the poster.

1020
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:58,200
This guy makes.

1021
00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:02,440
That brings to mind when you bring up a Clouseau,

1022
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:06,320
I think that is a weakness of this attraction to me, is that

1023
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:11,620
you want your bumbling detective to be this master of physical comedy

1024
00:48:11,620 --> 00:48:13,820
and so but to also have this kind of

1025
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:15,800
gravitas.

1026
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:16,680
Yeah, that's the word.

1027
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:17,380
Yes.

1028
00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:17,480
Yeah.

1029
00:48:17,540 --> 00:48:21,100
It has to seem like a professional self, so that when the bumbling occurs,

1030
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:25,220
you are kind of surprised and the surprise causes Leslie Nielsen.

1031
00:48:25,540 --> 00:48:26,760
You want him to be Leslie Nielsen.

1032
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:29,540
You want him to be the Don Adams from Get Smart.

1033
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:30,620
Yeah, that's the thing.

1034
00:48:30,620 --> 00:48:33,400
He's not playing it straight enough and he's not playing it bumbling.

1035
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:34,900
And it's kind of like in between.

1036
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:36,840
And then you don't accomplish either.

1037
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:37,360
Yeah.

1038
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:37,640
Yeah.

1039
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:42,020
And which I look, I think Drew Carey is doing what Drew Carey does.

1040
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:42,380
Yeah.

1041
00:48:42,380 --> 00:48:45,440
And he's great at what he's great at, which is being pretty much

1042
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:47,920
like being himself and being an affable guy.

1043
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:50,840
And if you watch him on The Price is Right, it's say, oh, I got the price.

1044
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:51,080
Right.

1045
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:52,200
You watch him on the show.

1046
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:53,100
Hey, maybe what are you doing?

1047
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:55,520
He's like he sort of has his one speed.

1048
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:55,880
It's great.

1049
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:56,800
It's a great speed.

1050
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:59,860
But he would not call him a fine actor.

1051
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:01,600
This is not a problem with Mr.

1052
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:02,320
Drew Carey.

1053
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:02,960
This is a problem.

1054
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:05,280
No, it's a miscast, I believe.

1055
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:07,880
And the whole thing is or just miss written wrong.

1056
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:08,340
Yeah.

1057
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:08,760
Yeah.

1058
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:09,940
A different idea going.

1059
00:49:09,940 --> 00:49:13,140
There's really like no one like in the Drew Carey show, he had

1060
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:19,200
Ryan Stiles to play off of and he had Mimi, which an actor,

1061
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:23,200
Kathy Kinney and she was she was huge.

1062
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:27,880
Like her and Drew Carey to get like they were the like big part of that show.

1063
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:29,920
Playing surrounded him with you.

1064
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:32,680
This is an all Drew Carey thing that relies on.

1065
00:49:32,780 --> 00:49:36,500
Well, it's also like a physical comedy thing where you only hear the physical

1066
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:37,020
comedy.

1067
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:38,960
It's this is a strange breed.

1068
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:43,300
You almost have to give him credit for trying like a truly new type of experience.

1069
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:45,400
Yeah, it's a whole new type of experience that's been established.

1070
00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:45,760
Yeah.

1071
00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:45,840
Yeah.

1072
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:46,740
All new type.

1073
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:50,960
So you got to get down to Orlando to see what choice do you have?

1074
00:49:50,980 --> 00:49:53,140
And this new experience does sound dangerous.

1075
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:55,120
They're not going to know what's going to happen.

1076
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:55,940
It's risky.

1077
00:49:56,400 --> 00:50:00,300
As Sharon Brooks herself, the director tells you

1078
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:02,960
like she knew was going to go awry, of course.

1079
00:50:03,260 --> 00:50:08,600
And then there's this sort of bad, self-aware joke of the things that are in the

1080
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:09,080
this.

1081
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:09,680
I hate this.

1082
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:12,540
They're trying to be meta here and they're saying what's in the

1083
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:15,380
office and like, and in a jar with a bunch of killer bees.

1084
00:50:15,860 --> 00:50:20,280
And this is like because we know that bees are one of the things that they can do

1085
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:21,960
well with the binaural audio.

1086
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:25,240
So they're trying to be jokey and saying like this.

1087
00:50:25,380 --> 00:50:26,620
It's a random thing.

1088
00:50:26,660 --> 00:50:30,440
Why would there be a bunch of bees in this snow globe office?

1089
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:32,560
But again, listen to me, this is too much.

1090
00:50:32,940 --> 00:50:34,460
There's too many silly components.

1091
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:35,100
Too many.

1092
00:50:35,140 --> 00:50:36,780
And he goes from one location to another.

1093
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:40,460
Easily could have walked by a beehive that got loose, you know, or something.

1094
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:41,000
That's right.

1095
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:41,540
Yes.

1096
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:42,660
Got his head stuck in there.

1097
00:50:42,860 --> 00:50:47,980
He like goes to the wrong address and then that walks and busts, thinks he's busting

1098
00:50:47,980 --> 00:50:51,700
some perps and then that turns out to be a bee farm.

1099
00:50:51,980 --> 00:50:53,140
Sure, yeah.

1100
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:53,640
Yeah.

1101
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,540
Did Lincoln have bees?

1102
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:57,000
Lincoln didn't have bees.

1103
00:50:57,580 --> 00:50:59,900
Four score is seven years ago.

1104
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:00,440
Oh, fuck.

1105
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:01,160
There's a bee.

1106
00:51:01,180 --> 00:51:01,560
Oh, no.

1107
00:51:01,580 --> 00:51:02,960
There's a bunch of bees.

1108
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:04,060
Oh, oh, gee.

1109
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:05,500
Get them off me.

1110
00:51:06,220 --> 00:51:09,680
If I can kill the queen, they'll all bow to me.

1111
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:13,940
He wanted he was jealous of the power of a queen.

1112
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:14,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1113
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:17,620
That's one thing I'm not president of.

1114
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:21,380
I want to be president of the bees.

1115
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:22,500
The White House.

1116
00:51:22,620 --> 00:51:24,540
But what about the yellow hive?

1117
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,260
Yeah, they needed to put bees in there.

1118
00:51:28,340 --> 00:51:29,360
I mean, still chance they can.

1119
00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:31,420
They can put bees on great moments with Mr.

1120
00:51:31,620 --> 00:51:31,780
Lincoln.

1121
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:34,300
Yeah, I want more gimmicks going in there.

1122
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:35,180
All with bees.

1123
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:36,640
Just add that to the sign.

1124
00:51:38,620 --> 00:51:42,000
I mean, if I knew that that animatronic was, you know,

1125
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:44,340
nimble enough to swat a bunch of bees away.

1126
00:51:44,580 --> 00:51:45,360
Oh, man.

1127
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:49,600
I know it can like slightly gesture and stay a speech, but I want to see

1128
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:50,940
the attack.

1129
00:51:51,260 --> 00:51:51,860
Lion attack.

1130
00:51:52,060 --> 00:51:52,600
Cougar attack.

1131
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:56,540
I haven't watched the Mario Kart ride yet, but you do have like

1132
00:51:56,540 --> 00:51:58,740
a are goggles or glasses on.

1133
00:51:58,780 --> 00:51:59,040
Correct.

1134
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:00,700
So maybe you can do an A.

1135
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:01,140
B.

1136
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:01,140
R.

1137
00:52:01,380 --> 00:52:03,360
attack during great moments with Mr.

1138
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:03,580
Lincoln.

1139
00:52:03,740 --> 00:52:05,840
Oh, no, it's a bee.

1140
00:52:06,260 --> 00:52:07,580
Oh, Mario's coming.

1141
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:09,440
Oh, Mario's in there.

1142
00:52:09,940 --> 00:52:10,540
Oh, he buzzes.

1143
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:11,420
Yeah, he just.

1144
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:13,400
Oh, so Mario's on the Lincoln ride, too.

1145
00:52:14,540 --> 00:52:14,540
Now.

1146
00:52:14,580 --> 00:52:16,260
Watch out the bees.

1147
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:17,560
They're after me.

1148
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:19,460
And then Mario shows up and.

1149
00:52:20,340 --> 00:52:20,340
Yeah.

1150
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:20,960
No.

1151
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:21,300
OK.

1152
00:52:21,660 --> 00:52:24,740
Now I'm going to be the president in 1865.

1153
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:26,000
Yeah.

1154
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:27,920
Look, A.

1155
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:28,020
R.

1156
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:28,740
is the future.

1157
00:52:29,140 --> 00:52:33,240
And the more Wario and Mario we can get, I'm in favor of it.

1158
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:33,620
Yeah.

1159
00:52:34,660 --> 00:52:35,960
But they didn't have that.

1160
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:36,360
They had a bunch.

1161
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:37,560
You can hear a bunch of bees.

1162
00:52:38,020 --> 00:52:39,500
We then we then we got a new guy we're looking for him.

1163
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:40,880
Johnny Marsconi.

1164
00:52:41,140 --> 00:52:42,480
There's a bunch of flames that shoot by.

1165
00:52:42,580 --> 00:52:43,300
It does sound good.

1166
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:45,120
They can do the wish of the flame very well.

1167
00:52:45,140 --> 00:52:45,800
But why?

1168
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:48,820
How does this detective story lend itself to it?

1169
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:52,160
You know, or like a there's an old telephone.

1170
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:55,960
There's an old like a receiver telephone in this office.

1171
00:52:56,180 --> 00:52:57,340
They can do that.

1172
00:52:57,660 --> 00:53:01,640
But like, I don't know, why did the Imagineers think that their ability

1173
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:05,080
to have an old clangy telephone or flame whooshing was enough

1174
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:08,680
that they had to try several attractions based on this?

1175
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:12,140
And Binaural Audio was already a part of Alien Encounter.

1176
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:12,680
Yes.

1177
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:14,680
Which it makes sense to be a scary thing.

1178
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:18,660
So you feel the intimacy of a scary creature right next to you.

1179
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:23,520
But then why do you step it down to a failed pilot presentation?

1180
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,740
Yeah, I don't just everyone.

1181
00:53:25,860 --> 00:53:28,540
I want to know who was so excited about this technology.

1182
00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:30,260
It does make the most sense in Alien Encounter.

1183
00:53:30,260 --> 00:53:32,520
But that was did you have headphones on an alien counter?

1184
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:35,140
No, you know, the speakers were just right behind you.

1185
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:39,360
And that's such a that's such a more seamless way to use the technology.

1186
00:53:40,140 --> 00:53:44,240
Yeah, I'm guessing they that the thing here that before that was

1187
00:53:44,780 --> 00:53:45,760
pretty low rated.

1188
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:48,120
And they're like, all right, here's what you have to work with.

1189
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:51,660
You can get Drew Carey for a day and you have twenty thousand dollars.

1190
00:53:51,780 --> 00:53:52,920
Make a new attraction.

1191
00:53:53,580 --> 00:53:56,280
I think, yes, we have a deal with a headphone company.

1192
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:56,800
Right.

1193
00:53:57,100 --> 00:53:58,420
Yeah, the headphones can stay.

1194
00:53:58,420 --> 00:54:00,500
We pulled the trigger and bought them.

1195
00:54:00,540 --> 00:54:02,180
We stopped renting them.

1196
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:07,480
Yeah, because because I I get how you would be excited for this tech

1197
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:10,620
that for binaural audio, binaural audio to be

1198
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:15,980
used in attractions to make it cool, like slightly better,

1199
00:54:15,980 --> 00:54:18,840
more dimension, sound dimensioners be scared.

1200
00:54:18,860 --> 00:54:24,180
But like for it to be the thing where you put a headphone on headphones on just for it.

1201
00:54:24,380 --> 00:54:25,780
It's like that feels like it.

1202
00:54:25,780 --> 00:54:30,260
Yes, it belongs in interventions for you to put it on for five minutes

1203
00:54:30,260 --> 00:54:33,880
and then take it off and go, OK, well, this could have been like a canary

1204
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:38,540
in the coal mine of like what was coming where movie theaters, theme parks,

1205
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:43,400
everyone is competing with the very good technology you already have at home.

1206
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:46,200
They either have to keep a pace or surpass it.

1207
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:46,600
Yes.

1208
00:54:46,660 --> 00:54:49,420
We all of a sudden it was like you can have surround sound at home.

1209
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:50,200
Yeah.

1210
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:53,640
And I remember we had some like Sam's Club version of it

1211
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:56,440
with like two little speakers like that we put behind.

1212
00:54:57,020 --> 00:54:58,380
I'm remembering this right now.

1213
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:01,160
Two little speakers we put like on the sides of the couch.

1214
00:55:01,220 --> 00:55:03,660
And it was like, wow, we have surround sound now.

1215
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:05,080
And it was like it was cool.

1216
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:08,160
I don't think it was the top of the line equipment.

1217
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:13,140
But yes, that suddenly became something you could get in your house

1218
00:55:13,140 --> 00:55:15,100
where it would be like the speakers are different.

1219
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:20,320
Still not really a priority to me that like I need if there's a scene in a movie

1220
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:24,080
and I'm watching it at home and a bunch of wind which is by me.

1221
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:27,500
I need to feel like I'm in the I'm in the windstorm.

1222
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:28,180
Right.

1223
00:55:28,620 --> 00:55:30,140
No, I don't.

1224
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:34,520
I if I was like a multimillionaire and I was building home theater, sure.

1225
00:55:34,940 --> 00:55:38,820
But all I need is like a decent amount of bass and a soundbar.

1226
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:40,020
And I'm right right now.

1227
00:55:40,020 --> 00:55:42,120
I don't need I need something crazy.

1228
00:55:42,580 --> 00:55:42,580
Mm hmm.

1229
00:55:42,860 --> 00:55:44,760
I don't even look, you know, I have a baby.

1230
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:46,860
So what I need is to keep it quiet.

1231
00:55:47,660 --> 00:55:49,680
So I I do not have a soundbar.

1232
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:51,400
You know, headphones probably won't tell you.

1233
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:52,860
No, not that not that bad.

1234
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:53,860
OK, yeah.

1235
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:57,400
That is a fun feature on Roku is where if you get the Roku app

1236
00:55:57,400 --> 00:56:01,300
or you get the one with the remote, you can listen to headphones.

1237
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:05,240
Listen to your TV with headphones either through your phone or through a remote.

1238
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:06,080
Yeah.

1239
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:07,400
So that's good.

1240
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:07,740
Yeah.

1241
00:56:07,740 --> 00:56:10,960
Do all that and don't instead of the binaural.

1242
00:56:11,140 --> 00:56:11,520
Yeah.

1243
00:56:11,560 --> 00:56:15,560
Don't fall for these expensive binaural machines that you're always seeing.

1244
00:56:16,140 --> 00:56:20,000
You go to your sharper image and you see binaural headphones.

1245
00:56:20,540 --> 00:56:21,540
You make you joke.

1246
00:56:21,540 --> 00:56:24,320
But like eight years ago, they were trying to cram down our throats.

1247
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:26,820
3D television like, yeah, right.

1248
00:56:26,860 --> 00:56:28,120
Get out of here.

1249
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:31,820
That was extinct as it hit the shelves.

1250
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:35,160
I still don't really know what it was like or what it did or might have been good.

1251
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:36,120
Maybe.

1252
00:56:36,140 --> 00:56:37,480
But the like shit.

1253
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:39,160
What about the curve television?

1254
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:41,960
The curve is kind of growing on me.

1255
00:56:42,020 --> 00:56:44,720
But like you got to make sure the curve was a curve was gone.

1256
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:46,200
Is the curve going?

1257
00:56:46,300 --> 00:56:46,980
Well, I don't know.

1258
00:56:46,980 --> 00:56:48,740
There's some very wide ones now.

1259
00:56:48,740 --> 00:56:49,860
Oh, you're a curve television.

1260
00:56:50,020 --> 00:56:50,540
Hard to tell.

1261
00:56:51,420 --> 00:56:51,580
Hmm.

1262
00:56:51,580 --> 00:56:53,320
Oh, that's another running joke.

1263
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:54,540
But I can see.

1264
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:56,160
New for 2021.

1265
00:56:56,460 --> 00:56:57,640
Jason loves curved TVs.

1266
00:56:57,660 --> 00:57:02,060
Well, no, you see like in the Jurassic World queue now, they have those really wide TVs

1267
00:57:02,060 --> 00:57:06,420
and like desktop monitors you can buy for your computer are like super wide now.

1268
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:07,300
Interesting.

1269
00:57:07,820 --> 00:57:08,240
Wow.

1270
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:11,560
I got I thought those I thought that fad was gone, but I'm seeing.

1271
00:57:11,860 --> 00:57:12,780
Yeah, that it's not.

1272
00:57:12,780 --> 00:57:17,300
Feels to me like if I wish that Disney had suckered

1273
00:57:17,300 --> 00:57:22,600
Jeffrey Katzenberg into thinking that things made just for binaural audio

1274
00:57:23,100 --> 00:57:27,040
or there's going to be a whole platform that is only what audiences want now.

1275
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:29,180
It's all consuming audio.

1276
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:30,520
It's what millennials want.

1277
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:33,400
They're sick of just staring at TV and the sounds over there.

1278
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:33,940
Where is it?

1279
00:57:33,940 --> 00:57:34,980
I can barely hear it.

1280
00:57:34,980 --> 00:57:36,180
I want it right here.

1281
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:41,700
And I want to watch little plays that happen that are mostly sound only.

1282
00:57:41,700 --> 00:57:45,480
Millennials want two minutes of video and then the video to short out

1283
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:47,620
and then 10 minutes of pure audio happens.

1284
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:53,880
And it's little scenes where somebody's in a swarm of bees or caught in a tornado

1285
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:56,940
or what else works for this?

1286
00:57:57,180 --> 00:58:00,040
They're in a, you know, like they fall down in a kitchen

1287
00:58:00,040 --> 00:58:03,760
and they hit a knife drawer and all the knives go shing past them.

1288
00:58:04,300 --> 00:58:07,700
This is what they're getting attacked by ninja stars.

1289
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:11,360
I think this Katzenberg raises two billion dollars for

1290
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:12,880
binary.

1291
00:58:13,460 --> 00:58:14,240
The man.

1292
00:58:15,220 --> 00:58:17,240
Look, he's looking for his next venture, I assume.

1293
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:20,240
So so I could be I could go pitch binary.

1294
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:22,660
I think you could probably get him to do binary.

1295
00:58:22,860 --> 00:58:26,920
And as long as he never Googles my name and Quibi.

1296
00:58:27,100 --> 00:58:27,640
That's right.

1297
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:27,960
Yeah.

1298
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:29,140
He's things that I said.

1299
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:29,520
Right.

1300
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:31,800
I could do some great business with him.

1301
00:58:31,820 --> 00:58:32,240
Yeah.

1302
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:35,420
And it's funny because you're now all in on like all the great shows

1303
00:58:35,420 --> 00:58:37,340
are now on the Roku channel for free.

1304
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:37,840
Yeah.

1305
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:38,620
They save them.

1306
00:58:38,700 --> 00:58:40,400
No, my problem was the medium.

1307
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:42,140
I didn't like watching on my phone.

1308
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:44,360
The shows obviously are all fantastic.

1309
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:48,140
And now that they're on Roku, I'm loving the Roku originals.

1310
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:50,700
I am binging them like crazy.

1311
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:56,340
Well, what else happens in this thing?

1312
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:57,740
There's like, I don't know, he goes.

1313
00:58:57,880 --> 00:58:59,360
So he goes and gets a haircut.

1314
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:01,160
We're getting back at haircut,

1315
00:59:02,020 --> 00:59:05,200
you know, and the haircut guy says you got to drive somewhere else.

1316
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:09,040
He ends up at the circus, which is a reason then to have

1317
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:12,960
you go to the circus because they're good at making the sound of a knife

1318
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:18,340
whippen by your right ear so that he gets caught in a knife throwing thing.

1319
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:23,020
And then I'm then I die inside.

1320
00:59:23,500 --> 00:59:27,320
Don't forget the guy who's in the haircut who owns a barbershop now

1321
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:31,240
had recently gotten out of jail and was known as the slasher.

1322
00:59:31,620 --> 00:59:32,880
Oh, yes.

1323
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:34,140
The very grim.

1324
00:59:34,340 --> 00:59:35,020
I did forget that.

1325
00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:36,160
Why is that important?

1326
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:40,520
Well, because to make a danger supposed to be a little like a gag

1327
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:44,540
that then you're getting a and he goes straight razor, the sharpest one.

1328
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:46,300
You know, he might Sweeney Todd.

1329
00:59:46,700 --> 00:59:46,960
Yeah.

1330
00:59:46,980 --> 00:59:47,260
Yeah.

1331
00:59:47,260 --> 00:59:47,980
I see.

1332
00:59:48,020 --> 00:59:52,040
And then the guy in the circus is is he the great was he is Rinaldi.

1333
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:53,000
Rinaldi.

1334
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:56,680
We're going to find Johnny Marsconi and then they got to find Rinaldi

1335
00:59:56,680 --> 00:59:57,980
and lefty Moreno.

1336
00:59:58,180 --> 00:59:58,380
Yeah.

1337
00:59:58,500 --> 01:00:03,500
These are are these all characters in the same family as superstar

1338
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:04,920
limo Swifty LaRue.

1339
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:05,960
Oh, yeah.

1340
01:00:06,220 --> 01:00:07,160
They feel in the same.

1341
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:07,580
They do.

1342
01:00:08,180 --> 01:00:08,840
Lefty Moreno.

1343
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:09,480
Absolutely.

1344
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:10,100
Yes.

1345
01:00:10,320 --> 01:00:13,720
I wonder if anybody could point us to or knows like

1346
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:18,740
did one imagineer come up with all these names or is this just the style of the time

1347
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:20,680
for like made up theme park character?

1348
01:00:20,940 --> 01:00:21,300
Hmm.

1349
01:00:21,340 --> 01:00:22,120
I don't know.

1350
01:00:22,940 --> 01:00:23,240
Yeah.

1351
01:00:23,500 --> 01:00:25,840
You got lefty got Swifty.

1352
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:27,280
You got thrifty.

1353
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:28,920
You got hefty.

1354
01:00:29,260 --> 01:00:30,960
There's a whole bunch of the whole family of them.

1355
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:31,940
We didn't get to see.

1356
01:00:31,940 --> 01:00:32,440
Mm hmm.

1357
01:00:32,680 --> 01:00:36,460
So, yeah, is there that's they were trying to do their version of C

1358
01:00:36,460 --> 01:00:41,740
with like Subdick Tracy level characters and it just didn't take off

1359
01:00:41,740 --> 01:00:43,340
with all light with.

1360
01:00:43,620 --> 01:00:44,140
Yeah.

1361
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:47,160
The 20s to 40s shysters.

1362
01:00:47,620 --> 01:00:47,740
Right.

1363
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:48,280
Exactly.

1364
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:50,400
And this is a less popular

1365
01:00:51,140 --> 01:00:53,940
Ronald Moore will not be turning this into anything.

1366
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:54,700
Sadly, no.

1367
01:00:54,820 --> 01:00:55,200
Yeah.

1368
01:00:55,540 --> 01:00:56,940
So I am interested.

1369
01:00:57,020 --> 01:01:01,640
I want to know, like, yeah, we're who loved the 1920s.

1370
01:01:01,940 --> 01:01:03,300
Like gangster names.

1371
01:01:03,540 --> 01:01:03,980
Yeah.

1372
01:01:04,020 --> 01:01:05,660
Was that imagine Andrew Carey?

1373
01:01:06,380 --> 01:01:10,040
Clearly, like that's what sure combines both of these attractions and poor

1374
01:01:10,780 --> 01:01:12,280
artwork, logos and fonts.

1375
01:01:12,380 --> 01:01:12,820
Right.

1376
01:01:13,240 --> 01:01:14,040
It's a good question.

1377
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:15,440
What a time.

1378
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:16,180
What a time.

1379
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:16,720
I was trying.

1380
01:01:16,780 --> 01:01:18,960
This is a little bit of a side note of like

1381
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:23,420
of all the sort of appearances of TV sitcom people from the 90s

1382
01:01:23,420 --> 01:01:25,360
and movies to as well, like Martin Short.

1383
01:01:25,420 --> 01:01:25,700
Yeah.

1384
01:01:25,900 --> 01:01:28,020
Is the most successful appearance?

1385
01:01:28,260 --> 01:01:30,380
And I guess I counted, I guess it opened in 2001,

1386
01:01:30,380 --> 01:01:33,880
but that still feels like the 90s to me is the Patrick Warburton's.

1387
01:01:34,540 --> 01:01:35,680
That's never going away.

1388
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:36,840
I think pretty right.

1389
01:01:37,260 --> 01:01:38,160
Beloved Patrick.

1390
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:38,700
Yeah.

1391
01:01:38,780 --> 01:01:42,040
But that's sort of in the same genre of like, oh, on a sitcom.

1392
01:01:42,220 --> 01:01:43,980
People like him a lot.

1393
01:01:44,060 --> 01:01:44,440
Mm hmm.

1394
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:44,760
Yeah.

1395
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:47,420
But that's sort of like of the moment guy.

1396
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:47,700
Right.

1397
01:01:47,720 --> 01:01:50,340
But that's going to last for I mean, that's still a couple of years from

1398
01:01:50,340 --> 01:01:54,420
science away after Seinfeld's over, but still like he also was never

1399
01:01:54,420 --> 01:01:57,180
like an overexposed person, really.

1400
01:01:57,180 --> 01:01:59,860
He's just like trustworthy character actor.

1401
01:01:59,860 --> 01:02:00,780
I love him when you see him.

1402
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:02,260
So like nobody got sick of him.

1403
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:06,080
And he doesn't feel like a dated person because he's still in stuff.

1404
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:09,320
So that's kind of a per feels like a good like timeless.

1405
01:02:09,780 --> 01:02:10,180
Right.

1406
01:02:10,180 --> 01:02:12,700
But that's the only one that's that's like that's the only one in these

1407
01:02:12,700 --> 01:02:15,720
like this genre, I feel like, well, like is like going to last forever.

1408
01:02:16,340 --> 01:02:20,080
He also it's also good that he's not like constantly in the ride.

1409
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:21,260
He's not telling you that.

1410
01:02:21,700 --> 01:02:23,560
Yeah, watch out for those skiers.

1411
01:02:23,720 --> 01:02:25,220
Yeah, it really dates rides.

1412
01:02:25,220 --> 01:02:28,640
When you have like a style of or like whatever, like, yeah,

1413
01:02:28,740 --> 01:02:31,880
Ellen commenting or smell that grass big guy

1414
01:02:32,650 --> 01:02:35,920
and he flies in, he's on some weird flying contraption.

1415
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:36,620
All right.

1416
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:38,280
Just a few more places to go.

1417
01:02:38,340 --> 01:02:38,980
Follow me.

1418
01:02:38,980 --> 01:02:39,840
Check it out.

1419
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:43,240
Soren would have gotten torn up, torn down at this point.

1420
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:46,100
If like Patrick Warburton had shown up on a hang glider,

1421
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:48,340
he's in there making hanging Chad jokes.

1422
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:49,340
Yeah.

1423
01:02:49,340 --> 01:02:50,860
For like 19 years.

1424
01:02:53,700 --> 01:02:55,960
I guess what you call me hanging Chad.

1425
01:02:56,080 --> 01:02:58,040
My name is Chad, by the way.

1426
01:02:58,100 --> 01:02:59,160
Full context.

1427
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:04,060
He's like dressed like culturally insensitively when he goes to different

1428
01:03:04,060 --> 01:03:07,960
we go to different places like how we got to get rid of this attraction.

1429
01:03:08,780 --> 01:03:09,840
You got to at least get a new film.

1430
01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:11,960
That is yes, that is for the best.

1431
01:03:12,020 --> 01:03:12,840
It's not an attraction.

1432
01:03:12,940 --> 01:03:14,500
You don't you're not like helping him.

1433
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:15,480
Yeah, that's a good point.

1434
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:19,180
You're not traveling all over California to help him find his wallet or something.

1435
01:03:19,780 --> 01:03:23,300
You don't know much about the character, not overexposed.

1436
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:28,920
As much as I would like to know about what is he even?

1437
01:03:28,980 --> 01:03:29,820
Is he a pilot?

1438
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:31,440
Yeah, that's a good question.

1439
01:03:31,720 --> 01:03:32,820
Does he just own the building?

1440
01:03:33,140 --> 01:03:34,100
I think he's a pilot.

1441
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:36,120
Yeah, he's got a pilot gear on.

1442
01:03:36,820 --> 01:03:40,960
But also like Soren even kind of tread at the line,

1443
01:03:41,140 --> 01:03:44,620
because like you're on a hang glider, but there's a pilot here

1444
01:03:44,620 --> 01:03:47,360
and there's a lot of history of aviation stuff here.

1445
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:48,820
So it's yeah.

1446
01:03:48,980 --> 01:03:49,480
Are you want to?

1447
01:03:49,540 --> 01:03:52,200
Yeah, well, you're learning about planes, but you're on a hang glider.

1448
01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:54,100
Yeah, yeah, that's a good point.

1449
01:03:54,100 --> 01:03:56,520
And now you're in the Grizzly Peak airfield.

1450
01:03:57,220 --> 01:03:59,000
And we've picked it all apart too much.

1451
01:03:59,180 --> 01:03:59,640
Yeah, man.

1452
01:04:00,100 --> 01:04:01,480
I get soren stinks.

1453
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:02,860
Yeah, concept of flying.

1454
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:04,840
Don't worry about it.

1455
01:04:04,840 --> 01:04:05,780
Yeah, I didn't want to.

1456
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:07,280
I didn't want to turn on in a tread.

1457
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:10,780
This thing made me turn on another ride that I like.

1458
01:04:12,340 --> 01:04:14,940
Well, OK, so mystery is solved.

1459
01:04:14,940 --> 01:04:18,500
And OK, can any of us confidently say

1460
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:25,620
Rinaldi was is Rinaldi also Johnny Marsconi

1461
01:04:25,620 --> 01:04:27,540
or is he just in business with him?

1462
01:04:27,780 --> 01:04:30,160
Can we explain the mystery coherently?

1463
01:04:30,760 --> 01:04:31,700
That's a good question.

1464
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:32,440
The answer is no.

1465
01:04:32,740 --> 01:04:33,360
No, I don't know.

1466
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:34,500
Anyway, something happens.

1467
01:04:35,620 --> 01:04:39,580
Rinaldi, he was smuggling diamonds in the snow globes.

1468
01:04:39,580 --> 01:04:40,200
You're right.

1469
01:04:40,300 --> 01:04:40,860
Yes, that's correct.

1470
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:42,320
It was a diamond operation.

1471
01:04:42,520 --> 01:04:43,800
Why did we end up at the circus?

1472
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:45,100
I truly don't.

1473
01:04:45,380 --> 01:04:46,940
I just watched it and I still don't know.

1474
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:49,240
I didn't retain it any better than I did back then,

1475
01:04:49,240 --> 01:04:50,500
even though I was supposed to.

1476
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:52,380
I was like, I'm on the clock.

1477
01:04:52,580 --> 01:04:52,800
Right.

1478
01:04:53,060 --> 01:04:53,220
This is work.

1479
01:04:53,220 --> 01:04:53,880
I'm supposed to study this thing.

1480
01:04:54,020 --> 01:04:54,460
This is work.

1481
01:04:54,460 --> 01:04:54,940
This is work.

1482
01:04:54,940 --> 01:04:55,680
I'm a work.

1483
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:56,600
Yeah, you're a work.

1484
01:04:57,060 --> 01:05:01,160
And then the clown pops a big thing right behind you.

1485
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:02,360
Gary startles him, pops a big thing.

1486
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:04,380
Startles him and it makes him break the camera.

1487
01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:06,400
Breaks the camera and then off camera,

1488
01:05:06,440 --> 01:05:08,740
he just beats the shit out of that goddamn clown.

1489
01:05:09,040 --> 01:05:10,680
You don't make me look like a fool.

1490
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:11,900
Well, Scott can get behind that.

1491
01:05:12,040 --> 01:05:12,660
Love it.

1492
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:13,080
Yeah.

1493
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:15,380
That's why I don't like this attraction more.

1494
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:16,500
I didn't get to see him.

1495
01:05:16,580 --> 01:05:19,700
You wanted more of the LA confidential kind of darkness.

1496
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:20,600
You wanted to…

1497
01:05:21,100 --> 01:05:23,940
And then like, tell me where your clown brothers are.

1498
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:26,140
I want to find each and every one of them.

1499
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:27,440
Do you want to scare me?

1500
01:05:27,740 --> 01:05:29,360
You wanted a bad lieutenant kind of clown.

1501
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:31,940
You wanted to hear Drew Carey like get out some pliers

1502
01:05:31,940 --> 01:05:35,200
and like you want to hear the clown's teeth being pulled out of its gums.

1503
01:05:35,360 --> 01:05:37,000
Now that's binaural audio.

1504
01:05:37,320 --> 01:05:38,300
Yeah, the shield.

1505
01:05:39,960 --> 01:05:41,080
Disney's the shield.

1506
01:05:41,720 --> 01:05:42,700
Let's see you laugh.

1507
01:05:42,700 --> 01:05:44,800
Let's see you laugh now after this.

1508
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:49,320
There we go.

1509
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:50,480
Yeah, that's binaural I can get.

1510
01:05:50,580 --> 01:05:50,880
Yes.

1511
01:05:50,940 --> 01:05:51,280
Finally.

1512
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:54,400
I want Detective Foster to do a nationwide clown hunt.

1513
01:05:55,120 --> 01:05:57,120
Taking out all my clown enemies.

1514
01:05:57,320 --> 01:05:59,420
Yeah, his partner, Harvey Keitel.

1515
01:06:01,620 --> 01:06:02,800
Yes, we bring a…

1516
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:03,960
We bring like a…

1517
01:06:04,320 --> 01:06:06,760
Now there's a there's a crime guy with gravitas.

1518
01:06:06,900 --> 01:06:08,200
That fixes the whole thing.

1519
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:11,560
OK, well, we just plus it up right there.

1520
01:06:11,580 --> 01:06:12,060
Yeah.

1521
01:06:12,420 --> 01:06:12,740
Yeah.

1522
01:06:13,020 --> 01:06:16,200
More more blood should have been super violent.

1523
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:16,560
Oh, man.

1524
01:06:16,660 --> 01:06:19,160
A good fellow's Lufthansa Heiss attraction.

1525
01:06:19,380 --> 01:06:20,220
Now that would have been…

1526
01:06:21,360 --> 01:06:26,720
Why haven't any of Martin Scorsese's rides been adapted for a theme park?

1527
01:06:27,880 --> 01:06:29,360
Taxi Driver Jr.?

1528
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:29,940
Sure.

1529
01:06:30,660 --> 01:06:31,680
I think they're all open.

1530
01:06:31,800 --> 01:06:32,560
It's all possible.

1531
01:06:33,740 --> 01:06:33,740
Yeah.

1532
01:06:34,680 --> 01:06:37,400
Well, that sounds dangerous, I guess.

1533
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:41,440
And then you file out and then the the director,

1534
01:06:42,080 --> 01:06:44,420
whose name is Sharon Brooks, says,

1535
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:49,600
join us next time on another when it'll be another mission on undercover.

1536
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:50,980
And like, what next time?

1537
01:06:51,120 --> 01:06:52,120
Do you mean this was a lie?

1538
01:06:52,380 --> 01:06:55,100
This was a limited audience pilot.

1539
01:06:55,880 --> 01:06:59,400
It's all that might not get picked up, especially after these mishaps.

1540
01:06:59,580 --> 01:07:02,540
If this is what happens just in the first episode,

1541
01:07:02,980 --> 01:07:05,920
I don't think you can trust the crew of this show.

1542
01:07:05,940 --> 01:07:06,900
No, I wouldn't be able to.

1543
01:07:06,900 --> 01:07:10,720
And but then the thing they greenlit instead was Emily's reasons why not.

1544
01:07:11,620 --> 01:07:12,860
Which aired one episode.

1545
01:07:14,540 --> 01:07:16,240
They did have their gram dirty, too.

1546
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:17,560
She deserves more.

1547
01:07:18,940 --> 01:07:20,040
Tough run for ABC.

1548
01:07:20,900 --> 01:07:24,000
Well, strange, strange attraction, eh?

1549
01:07:24,360 --> 01:07:24,680
Yeah.

1550
01:07:24,680 --> 01:07:25,500
How did this run?

1551
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:28,460
This ran from 99 to 2012.

1552
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:32,460
It's straddled the prices, right?

1553
01:07:32,580 --> 01:07:34,720
He's been hosting priser rides since 2007.

1554
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:39,100
So you like, you know him primarily for that and then go see this thing

1555
01:07:39,100 --> 01:07:42,940
where he's a detective messing around with knife throwers.

1556
01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:43,740
Very confused.

1557
01:07:43,840 --> 01:07:44,780
Yeah, all this stuff.

1558
01:07:45,260 --> 01:07:46,100
It's so funny.

1559
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:48,220
This has happened so many times now on the show where we go,

1560
01:07:48,340 --> 01:07:50,080
this was still there when?

1561
01:07:50,540 --> 01:07:53,720
Yeah, there's there's high definition footage of what?

1562
01:07:54,020 --> 01:07:54,440
Yeah.

1563
01:07:54,560 --> 01:07:58,220
I would be like, oh, well, that closed in 2002.

1564
01:07:58,380 --> 01:07:58,820
Right.

1565
01:07:59,040 --> 01:08:00,640
And you're like, no, no, no.

1566
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:02,240
Decade, another decade.

1567
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:07,080
Big Drew Carey face like when prime real estate in this theme park.

1568
01:08:07,080 --> 01:08:07,460
Yeah.

1569
01:08:07,460 --> 01:08:08,340
So so long.

1570
01:08:08,560 --> 01:08:09,220
That's a good question.

1571
01:08:09,240 --> 01:08:10,480
Yeah, I.

1572
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:14,680
But people remember, like when it's when it's a person

1573
01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:19,020
whose name is in the title of the sitcom and they're like in other stuff,

1574
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:22,900
they're in theme parks like look at it, look at the calendar

1575
01:08:22,900 --> 01:08:26,240
for any big casino and see what comedians are playing.

1576
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:29,140
And you're like, oh, I didn't know they tour like it's like,

1577
01:08:29,300 --> 01:08:30,260
I forgot about them.

1578
01:08:30,260 --> 01:08:31,980
But it's like, yeah, you know,

1579
01:08:31,980 --> 01:08:32,880
they stick around.

1580
01:08:32,920 --> 01:08:36,220
They do stick around in the popular consciousness in one way or another.

1581
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:37,180
Yeah, yeah.

1582
01:08:37,800 --> 01:08:37,800
Yeah.

1583
01:08:38,140 --> 01:08:40,740
So you're you're saying that as a sort of a defense for people

1584
01:08:40,740 --> 01:08:44,260
who have more fond memories after I was saying I was trashing it

1585
01:08:44,260 --> 01:08:49,080
and saying, no, I think people regular theme park guests,

1586
01:08:49,680 --> 01:08:53,200
probably whether they know it or they're like, oh, yeah, Drew Carey, famous guy.

1587
01:08:53,240 --> 01:08:56,320
You would have a ride, you know, even if his show had been on

1588
01:08:56,320 --> 01:08:57,860
for like six years or whatever.

1589
01:08:58,140 --> 01:08:58,360
Yeah.

1590
01:08:58,460 --> 01:08:58,660
Yeah.

1591
01:08:59,060 --> 01:09:01,240
So that might be why they kept her like the name.

1592
01:09:01,240 --> 01:09:02,820
That's my deal with him.

1593
01:09:03,240 --> 01:09:03,440
Yeah.

1594
01:09:03,480 --> 01:09:04,140
Yeah, that's true.

1595
01:09:04,180 --> 01:09:07,800
But man, when Disney goes, stuff goes seasonal, it's like, oh,

1596
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:09,020
you're just looking for that.

1597
01:09:09,020 --> 01:09:11,640
You're just waiting for financial quarter to come around

1598
01:09:11,640 --> 01:09:14,740
where you can afford to tear this down.

1599
01:09:14,740 --> 01:09:15,060
Yeah.

1600
01:09:15,060 --> 01:09:18,400
Let alone a financial quarter where you plug in something new.

1601
01:09:18,500 --> 01:09:18,880
Yeah.

1602
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:21,460
We just need to develop like a good new ice cream

1603
01:09:21,460 --> 01:09:24,420
that will eat up the same amount of people as this attraction.

1604
01:09:25,360 --> 01:09:27,620
And we can easily let this go.

1605
01:09:27,620 --> 01:09:28,380
Yeah.

1606
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:31,940
If Disney wishables do well at the gift shop,

1607
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:33,780
like a new kind of stuff.

1608
01:09:34,040 --> 01:09:34,360
Yes.

1609
01:09:34,380 --> 01:09:34,780
Yeah.

1610
01:09:35,100 --> 01:09:36,240
It was well.

1611
01:09:36,540 --> 01:09:38,160
It's like, oh, well, OK.

1612
01:09:38,820 --> 01:09:39,280
Yeah, good.

1613
01:09:39,380 --> 01:09:39,800
We got some.

1614
01:09:40,020 --> 01:09:41,760
Yeah, we can bring back this thing.

1615
01:09:41,980 --> 01:09:43,080
The wishables are the small ones.

1616
01:09:43,100 --> 01:09:45,640
Those are they're not the ones that I'm very excited about,

1617
01:09:45,740 --> 01:09:50,540
where you can put like Mickey and like a polo shirt and like some blue jeans.

1618
01:09:51,260 --> 01:09:54,060
I forget that might be a variety.

1619
01:09:54,700 --> 01:09:59,400
Yeah, they're Duffy in up like stuffed animals or something.

1620
01:09:59,480 --> 01:10:01,660
Yeah, you can dress them in normal clothes.

1621
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:04,620
Here's the one where the characters don't have bodies.

1622
01:10:04,680 --> 01:10:06,000
There's and they have big eyes.

1623
01:10:06,020 --> 01:10:08,340
There's the ones where they have really small eyes

1624
01:10:08,340 --> 01:10:10,580
and his weird little tails like a slug.

1625
01:10:10,860 --> 01:10:12,980
Here's the one where they sleep inside of a sock.

1626
01:10:13,240 --> 01:10:15,800
They will find so many weird different.

1627
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:20,300
How many types of main character plushes can we crank out?

1628
01:10:20,380 --> 01:10:23,540
Oh, it's a new moat and new emos.

1629
01:10:23,540 --> 01:10:25,360
How do you pronounce them?

1630
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:28,480
N-U-I-M-O-S, but M-O is new.

1631
01:10:28,720 --> 01:10:31,580
Emos, new emos, new emos.

1632
01:10:31,640 --> 01:10:32,860
Have they hit America yet?

1633
01:10:33,020 --> 01:10:33,900
Yeah, yeah, this is it.

1634
01:10:33,900 --> 01:10:35,940
No, I've seen those advertised in.

1635
01:10:36,300 --> 01:10:40,940
Yeah, look at Mickey and Minnie or Donald dressed like a leather day.

1636
01:10:42,160 --> 01:10:42,560
What?

1637
01:10:42,740 --> 01:10:45,340
He's got a leather daddy hat on there.

1638
01:10:49,700 --> 01:10:51,640
Mickey and Minnie are wearing like leather jackets.

1639
01:10:51,640 --> 01:10:54,160
And Mickey's got like leather pants.

1640
01:10:54,620 --> 01:10:57,000
And then Donald is wearing like kind of a leisure suit

1641
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,420
and has like a leather daddy type of it.

1642
01:10:59,480 --> 01:10:59,660
It's not.

1643
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:01,060
It's on further inspection.

1644
01:11:01,140 --> 01:11:04,920
The material is not probably leather, but it's no way it's similar to it, though.

1645
01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:05,620
It's fake leather.

1646
01:11:05,660 --> 01:11:06,440
Can you see that or no?

1647
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:08,080
It's a little far for me.

1648
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:10,320
You can text me as many.

1649
01:11:10,360 --> 01:11:12,580
Yeah, I mean, leather characters as you want.

1650
01:11:12,660 --> 01:11:13,600
I need more details.

1651
01:11:13,820 --> 01:11:14,960
I could use a narrative.

1652
01:11:15,420 --> 01:11:16,860
Oh, that's like a yeah.

1653
01:11:16,900 --> 01:11:17,720
What is that?

1654
01:11:17,780 --> 01:11:19,820
He's got leather, though, on his on his collar.

1655
01:11:19,820 --> 01:11:22,820
That looks like a pop punk like ensemble.

1656
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:24,180
I don't know.

1657
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:25,060
Like a band.

1658
01:11:25,060 --> 01:11:28,320
I mean, Daisy's wearing maybe you could say that's a Cruella type outfit.

1659
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:30,800
Like fashion Cruella.

1660
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:31,480
Yeah, fashion.

1661
01:11:31,780 --> 01:11:31,940
Yeah.

1662
01:11:32,680 --> 01:11:33,500
Classic Cruella.

1663
01:11:33,560 --> 01:11:37,960
But anyway, you can buy clothes for a lot of these characters now,

1664
01:11:38,580 --> 01:11:40,660
like sweatshirts and leather pants.

1665
01:11:40,840 --> 01:11:41,500
Good to do.

1666
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:42,860
You love these characters or not?

1667
01:11:42,940 --> 01:11:45,460
You don't have one new emo in this apartment.

1668
01:11:45,780 --> 01:11:49,700
You don't put any leather jackets over Donald's seat.

1669
01:11:49,700 --> 01:11:50,560
You haven't put you.

1670
01:11:50,680 --> 01:11:53,320
That seat is unclad with leather pants.

1671
01:11:54,160 --> 01:11:55,100
It's a good point.

1672
01:11:55,100 --> 01:11:55,840
I mean, I'm looking here.

1673
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:57,840
You can buy a little Hawaiian shirt and shorts.

1674
01:11:58,420 --> 01:11:59,960
This stuff is really good.

1675
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:03,980
I really should not buy any more collectibles

1676
01:12:03,980 --> 01:12:06,800
as I'd like to like to call them to make it sounds sophisticated.

1677
01:12:07,100 --> 01:12:07,340
Yeah.

1678
01:12:07,580 --> 01:12:07,940
Yeah.

1679
01:12:08,220 --> 01:12:10,640
But there's a little Kermit.

1680
01:12:10,660 --> 01:12:11,340
There's a little piggy.

1681
01:12:11,500 --> 01:12:14,840
I mean, look, maybe it's a lot of little pants.

1682
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:15,680
This is Sunday.

1683
01:12:15,900 --> 01:12:16,340
Dressin.

1684
01:12:16,420 --> 01:12:18,480
Well, I'm very excited because I got a couple of months ago.

1685
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:21,080
I got these four Ninja Turtle NECA toys, cartoon toys,

1686
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:23,160
and they come with trench coats and little pants.

1687
01:12:23,700 --> 01:12:25,180
And you can take the little blue pants.

1688
01:12:25,180 --> 01:12:26,120
Oh, because they're under cover.

1689
01:12:26,440 --> 01:12:27,920
Yeah, because they're the undercover turtles.

1690
01:12:28,380 --> 01:12:31,780
So I already have four sets of little blue pants upstairs,

1691
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:36,200
but they don't fit on the new new modes or whatever.

1692
01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:39,340
But they fit on different figures because I wait.

1693
01:12:39,460 --> 01:12:40,540
Does it fit on Doc Brown?

1694
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:42,560
Could you make it look like Doc Brown was wearing slacks?

1695
01:12:44,020 --> 01:12:48,460
The Doc, the Back to the Future NECA's are a little bit in a different scale.

1696
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:50,840
And they in Doc Brown has longer legs.

1697
01:12:51,100 --> 01:12:51,460
You could try.

1698
01:12:51,780 --> 01:12:53,800
Can't trade the characters pants easily.

1699
01:12:54,240 --> 01:13:00,180
Well, for the for the cartoon line, you depending on how tall the character is,

1700
01:13:00,540 --> 01:13:03,420
like they have I have two of the punk frog characters and those,

1701
01:13:03,560 --> 01:13:06,060
I think you could probably put the pants on because you can put the jackets

1702
01:13:06,060 --> 01:13:07,500
on those guys pretty easily.

1703
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:09,640
But like crying, my crying is very big.

1704
01:13:09,700 --> 01:13:11,320
So he could not wear the turtle pants.

1705
01:13:12,280 --> 01:13:15,440
So some care, some characters, but not all characters, right?

1706
01:13:15,540 --> 01:13:17,900
Trade little pants before you put them in their little beds.

1707
01:13:18,460 --> 01:13:19,180
That's right.

1708
01:13:19,380 --> 01:13:19,600
Yes.

1709
01:13:19,660 --> 01:13:22,420
And they hopefully they're coming out with a little bed playset

1710
01:13:22,420 --> 01:13:24,520
in the next year or two where they can sleep.

1711
01:13:24,520 --> 01:13:26,340
Just don't start a fire, Michael.

1712
01:13:28,120 --> 01:13:29,640
I told my mom about that.

1713
01:13:29,640 --> 01:13:31,180
She still stands by that, by the way.

1714
01:13:31,380 --> 01:13:31,780
Oh, really?

1715
01:13:31,820 --> 01:13:32,380
Hasn't budged?

1716
01:13:32,420 --> 01:13:32,620
Yeah.

1717
01:13:32,620 --> 01:13:32,740
Yeah.

1718
01:13:32,740 --> 01:13:33,560
Thinks that was right.

1719
01:13:33,580 --> 01:13:37,280
The right call to make that that was a fire hazard.

1720
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:37,840
Geez.

1721
01:13:37,900 --> 01:13:39,140
Have napkins sitting.

1722
01:13:39,340 --> 01:13:40,940
Oh, you do have a candle burning in the bathroom.

1723
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:41,520
Don't forget to blow.

1724
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:41,980
Oh, yeah.

1725
01:13:41,980 --> 01:13:42,140
Yeah.

1726
01:13:42,280 --> 01:13:42,680
Fire.

1727
01:13:42,980 --> 01:13:43,820
Tell her she's not here.

1728
01:13:43,980 --> 01:13:46,040
Any napkins near it, especially not any little beds.

1729
01:13:46,040 --> 01:13:46,740
OK.

1730
01:13:46,840 --> 01:13:49,200
Or the turtles little pants to our flammable, probably.

1731
01:13:49,240 --> 01:13:49,820
Oh, probably.

1732
01:13:49,880 --> 01:13:51,420
Yeah, just made of asbestos.

1733
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:53,040
They call they're called soft goods.

1734
01:13:53,220 --> 01:13:56,340
That's how that's a toy terminology for cloth accessories.

1735
01:13:56,560 --> 01:13:57,380
Soft goods.

1736
01:13:58,940 --> 01:14:02,180
So the soft to buy my turtles, their little soft goods.

1737
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:07,660
So some some of my turtles come with soft goods and some with hard goods.

1738
01:14:08,300 --> 01:14:09,280
Well, I don't say hard goods.

1739
01:14:09,480 --> 01:14:11,800
They don't say that's just sort of because then it's then it's

1740
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:13,920
just kind of put on the character itself.

1741
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:15,880
But I'm just saying the soft goods might be flammable.

1742
01:14:16,040 --> 01:14:16,640
Hmm.

1743
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:16,980
OK.

1744
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:17,240
Yeah.

1745
01:14:17,420 --> 01:14:20,660
Well, then knowing that we're in the same house as some soft goods

1746
01:14:20,660 --> 01:14:23,720
and some candles that are currently lit, we better get out of here

1747
01:14:23,720 --> 01:14:28,480
so we can say you survived podcast the ride so we can say that we survived it

1748
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:32,800
because it's getting as harrowing as Charles Foster's journey.

1749
01:14:33,820 --> 01:14:34,180
Wait a minute.

1750
01:14:34,260 --> 01:14:35,780
Isn't that the is it?

1751
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:36,060
Oh, no.

1752
01:14:36,180 --> 01:14:37,120
You know, Charlie Foster's.

1753
01:14:37,260 --> 01:14:37,620
Charles Foster.

1754
01:14:38,020 --> 01:14:38,420
Yeah.

1755
01:14:39,300 --> 01:14:40,100
Is he related?

1756
01:14:40,320 --> 01:14:41,660
Is he related to Citizen Kane?

1757
01:14:41,900 --> 01:14:43,560
God, we just put that together.

1758
01:14:43,560 --> 01:14:48,100
No, the Foster's litigious, like the goddamn hearse.

1759
01:14:48,100 --> 01:14:52,540
Are they going to sue us now for even mentioning the words?

1760
01:14:52,840 --> 01:14:53,840
Citizen Kane, Charles.

1761
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:54,820
Yeah, maybe.

1762
01:14:55,680 --> 01:14:57,280
Well, not more danger to get.

1763
01:14:57,300 --> 01:15:01,000
We better dive out of this episode, but not before one more reminder.

1764
01:15:01,480 --> 01:15:02,240
Price is right.

1765
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:03,620
Monday, June 28th.

1766
01:15:03,620 --> 01:15:05,460
Check your local listings here in Los Angeles.

1767
01:15:05,640 --> 01:15:06,520
It's 10 o'clock.

1768
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:09,200
But maybe get there, maybe make it more of a nine nine fifty eight.

1769
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:13,180
And again, I can't tell you why lest I incur the ghost of Sumner

1770
01:15:13,180 --> 01:15:13,760
Redstone.

1771
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:16,000
So Michael Eisner.

1772
01:15:18,660 --> 01:15:20,360
So that'll do it.

1773
01:15:21,020 --> 01:15:24,720
And that makes sense, because I knew Mike, you said

1774
01:15:24,720 --> 01:15:29,680
that we had to wrap up the episode because it's time for Edwin's monthly haircut.

1775
01:15:29,880 --> 01:15:30,360
Correct.

1776
01:15:30,680 --> 01:15:31,420
I did say that.

1777
01:15:31,420 --> 01:15:31,680
Yeah.

1778
01:15:31,700 --> 01:15:35,360
Well, bring him up on your lap and let's yeah, he's looking a little shaggy.

1779
01:15:35,420 --> 01:15:37,740
Maybe we need to give that guy a little trim.

1780
01:15:38,280 --> 01:15:38,580
Yeah.

1781
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:40,820
Cheek, cheek, cheek, cheek, cheek, cheek, cheek, cheek.

1782
01:15:40,900 --> 01:15:41,160
Wow.

1783
01:15:41,160 --> 01:15:42,360
He's so well behaved.

1784
01:15:42,360 --> 01:15:43,540
Oh, geez.

1785
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:45,180
It's not bothering him one bit.

1786
01:15:45,360 --> 01:15:48,200
Oh, but you know what might bother him a little more than that?

1787
01:15:48,280 --> 01:15:51,180
That swarm of killer bees that's coming in through the window.

1788
01:15:51,620 --> 01:15:56,000
No, they have flamethrowers with them, too.

1789
01:15:56,380 --> 01:15:59,140
No, for for for for for.

1790
01:16:00,080 --> 01:16:03,140
President Lincoln, you buy you rubbing your beard on my face.

1791
01:16:05,700 --> 01:16:08,580
I just wanted to show you this

1792
01:16:08,580 --> 01:16:11,520
this great new peanut brittle that I just found.

1793
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:15,220
Oh, it really helps relieve the pressures of being the president.

1794
01:16:16,380 --> 01:16:18,780
Oh, now you're kissing my neck, President.

1795
01:16:19,260 --> 01:16:20,420
President was the president.

1796
01:16:20,680 --> 01:16:20,740
Reagan,

1797
01:16:22,380 --> 01:16:23,440
Reagan's here, too.

1798
01:16:23,440 --> 01:16:24,420
I'm here, too.

1799
01:16:24,540 --> 01:16:26,920
No, those kisses were me.

1800
01:16:27,180 --> 01:16:28,420
Tear down these bees.

1801
01:16:29,040 --> 01:16:30,040
Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.

1802
01:16:30,360 --> 01:16:31,860
Oh, so many presidents.

1803
01:16:31,980 --> 01:16:33,220
So many presidents kissing.

1804
01:16:33,420 --> 01:16:35,120
Oh, and Edwin's licking them now, too.

1805
01:16:35,120 --> 01:16:36,180
Oh, my gosh.

1806
01:16:36,420 --> 01:16:39,360
It's a dog pile with one dog and two presidents.

1807
01:16:42,020 --> 01:16:42,780
Fine, Norel.

1808
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:44,960
Let's just let's just let you know what?

1809
01:16:44,980 --> 01:16:45,740
This is disgusting.

1810
01:16:45,820 --> 01:16:47,600
I'm just going to light them all on fire.

1811
01:16:49,500 --> 01:16:49,880
Wow.
