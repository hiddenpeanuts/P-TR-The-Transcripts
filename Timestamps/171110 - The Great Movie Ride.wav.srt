1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Feral Audio.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Warning. Today's episode is the first one to require an actual warning.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
We are not kidding. This one really goes places.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Beware hitchhiking gangsters on Podcast the Ride.

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Hello ladies and gentlemen and welcome to Podcast the Ride, the theme park podcast that's a thin excuse for three adults to use churros as tax write-offs.

6
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:55,000
There we go. Score already. My name is Scott Gardner and that guy you heard laughing was Jason Sheridan.

7
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Hi.

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
And Mike Carlson is here.

9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Hello. I'm here too.

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
A softer laugh.

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Yeah, yeah. I'm withholding with my laughter, I've been told.

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
You have been, yes. Multiple sources have told you this and I might agree with them.

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Yeah.

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I appreciate some support as we record future episodes of this Podcast the Ride.

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:32,000
So folks, today we're going to talk about the great movie ride, which it feels strange to say it is a dearly departed attraction from the former Disney MGM studios, today's Disney's Hollywood studios and tomorrow's Disney Hyperia, Disney's XL park.

16
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Yeah, we should talk about that. There's a survey just went out because they're thinking about renaming this park, this Disney's Hollywood, it started out as Disney's MGM studios and it's been Disney's Hollywood studios for many years, but there's a list of ideas they've got and they're terrible.

17
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Each one better than the last, I would say.

18
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
They were.

19
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
These names.

20
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:06,000
These were like tested on guests, they did a poll and to see what guests like the most. The one that was kind of the most in line with what things have been named in the past at movie theme parks was Disney's Cinemagic, I think was the name of, is that correct?

21
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Yeah.

22
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Yeah, no Disney's Hollywood Adventure, I feel like that was floating around as a rumor for a while that it was going to be called that.

23
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Seems pretty clean and clear. Part of me is like just don't rename it, like what an incredible amount of work for them to do and rebranding and re-merchandising. Maybe they want to though, now they get new money from that new merch with the cool new logo.

24
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I've got the names here, these are the potential names.

25
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Disney Kaleidoscope Park.

26
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
What does that mean?

27
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Yeah, I don't know. Kaleidoscope is just a mix of shapes and colors.

28
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
What else? What the park is becoming, just a mishmash of Star Wars and Marvel.

29
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Disney Storyverse Park?

30
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Which like, what is a...

31
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
That was a name by committee, if I've ever heard one.

32
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Disney Hyperia Park?

33
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Made up word.

34
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Disney Beyond Park?

35
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Nothing.

36
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:14,000
You know where you ride the rides about movies. Disney Beyond or Disney Hyperia, a play on a local street name around where we are recording this podcast. Bizarre.

37
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Disney Cinemagic, Disney Legends Park.

38
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Which really, if it's called Disney Legends, it should be like rides devoted to all of the Disney legends like Dick Van Dyke and Imagineer Tony Baxter.

39
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
And Whoopi Goldberg.

40
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
And Whoopi Goldberg.

41
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Fess Parker, a virtual Fess Parker winery. He's the guy who played Davy Crockett and now he makes great wine that you can enjoy at the...

42
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
We all know who Fess Parker is.

43
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Is he still alive?

44
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Not sure. I say he makes the wine. Probably he never made the wine. At some point he was alive and may not be alive today.

45
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:56,000
There's my favorite potential name Disney XL Park, because I'm a big boy and I like a big park.

46
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
You've described yourself as husky before.

47
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I'm a husky man, husky lad.

48
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I don't think you are though. Do you like in spirit you are? Like you have your jovial, you have...

49
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Well, at the very least when I was a preteen, I definitely had some husky clothes.

50
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I mean, husky is a size category for young boys in department stores.

51
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Not the dog, the husky.

52
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
No, no, it just means fat little boys.

53
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I'm so sorry.

54
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:32,000
This would be a place you as a child would have felt comfortable buying clothes that don't demean you.

55
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Big boy, big adventures, big thrills.

56
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
That would be a good tagline, big boys, big adventures.

57
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Yeah, that's true.

58
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Meet the hosts. This is Jason Sheridan. He lives his life XL style.

59
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,000
One thing you got to know about Jason, he's an XL kind of guy. He excels in living XL.

60
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:58,000
It also reminds me of the Disney, not Disney, the McDonald's Mighty Kids Meal, which was another thing aimed at husky kids.

61
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
It's like a happy meal, but if you're a little more hungry...

62
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Were you like, was only your local McDonald's testing that out like they knew?

63
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Like this is one XL kid, he'll come in and try this thing.

64
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I wish. No, I believe that was a national branding effort.

65
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I really have no memory.

66
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Mighty Kids Meal would be like a double cheeseburger, not a regular cheeseburger.

67
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
And it was just to fill that fucker up a little more.

68
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
And a toy you could eat, I guess.

69
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
A toy you could eat.

70
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
And what was the Disney Cinemagic?

71
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Cinemagic. Oh, man.

72
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
So if you can imagine the Cinemagene...

73
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
It also sounds like Cinemagene.

74
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Well, doesn't it have a weird sort of vaginal quality to it?

75
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Cinemagene?

76
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Like what is the...

77
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
There's some comedy thing where somebody calls something a vagene and it reminds...

78
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
A boar rat.

79
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
A vagina vagene.

80
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
So unless they're putting an opening of a boar rat.

81
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Like Cinemagene, like a Frenchman.

82
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Cinemagene. See all the most famous vaginas in film history.

83
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Julianne Moore in Shortcuts. Is that correct?

84
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,000
There will be a Julianne Moore in Shortcuts animatronic.

85
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Think back to your Mr. Skin days.

86
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:29,000
The Robert Altman movie based on Raymond Carver short story Shortcuts will have a new attraction at Disney's XL Tour.

87
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
For all fans of Julianne Moore's Another Regents.

88
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I'm trying to agree with you, Scott. I think they should just keep it as Disney's Hollywood Studios.

89
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Because even like in real life in modern day, like movie studios mostly exist in popular culture.

90
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Like most movie studios, they just keep bulldozing the sound stages.

91
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Because so much is shot on green screens.

92
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Not that we're all, you know, for those listeners who don't know our body of work.

93
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Sometimes we all do things for TV shows or something.

94
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Can you like count on one hand the amount of times you've been at a real studio?

95
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:18,000
It's so rare. You're always in some odd sound stage warehouse off the two and some awful at the Highland Park crumbling facility.

96
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Like the studios are kind of a fake thing anyway.

97
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
A little bit. And everything's shot in Atlanta, New Orleans.

98
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Also my reasoning for why you should keep it just the same name is that except for us and like a thousand people, no one gives a shit.

99
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:41,000
No one cares. There's not a father that comes to Florida and it's like, well the theme of this park is unclear.

100
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
And the name doesn't really match the rides that I've been going on. This is very bothersome to me.

101
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
What productions are currently shooting here?

102
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I don't see a sound stage anywhere. The famous hanger shape of a sound stage.

103
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I don't see any teamsters or craft services anywhere.

104
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,000
This isn't like the movies at all. I didn't need a special pass to with my face on it.

105
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I didn't need a drive on. Mike and I were recently at a working movie studio, Universal Studios Orlando.

106
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Not together. We were not there together. We were both there within the last few weeks.

107
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Separate trips. I'm so jealous. How did it go? What did you find?

108
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Some stuff looks really good and some stuff does not.

109
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,000
You're talking about just Universal. Just Universal Orlando in general.

110
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I had a very weird experience where I was down there and Orlando gets a lot of rain.

111
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:44,000
But the first few days I was there, it just rained so much like all the time.

112
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
And usually it's like hot and sunny in the morning and then thunderstorms roll in.

113
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
This was like waking up and there were thunderstorms.

114
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I like that we're talking about Universal Orlando and the first thing you just talk about is the rain.

115
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
It was very weird for Orlando because I've gone to Orlando so much.

116
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
They were like, what's he going to talk about? The rides or the restaurants?

117
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Jason, Florida's rainy, folks.

118
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Let's cut to the chase. We want to hear about your naps.

119
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Do you get some good naps soon?

120
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Spider-Man still looks great.

121
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Yes, it does. I agree.

122
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Spider-Man still looks great. The E.T. adventure, Scott, you'll be happy to hear, was running great.

123
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
When I was there, it looked really good.

124
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,000
And compare some of the other attractions, like some of these screen based rides.

125
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Universal has a lot of screen based rides and some of them are not aging well.

126
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
What's suffering right now?

127
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I mean, the Terminator ride needs a new screen.

128
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Oh, they still have Terminator.

129
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Terminator is going away though. That's going away soon.

130
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:46,000
The thing with the screen rides is some of them may aging poorly, but it's mostly screen rides.

131
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:52,000
It's so depressing. It's the same crap. It's the same stupid trick every time to make you feel like you're going forward.

132
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
You get sprayed in the face with water at the same spot to me.

133
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Like, oh, whoa, a guy just spills a soda on you from the Jimmy Fallon ride and like water hits you in the face.

134
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I don't even want to talk about Jimmy Fallon ride.

135
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Pleasurable sensation in the world getting water sprayed at you that you don't expect.

136
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,000
The Kong ride is a lot of screens with a great animatronic at the end.

137
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Like the giant Kong animatronic looks awesome.

138
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:23,000
There's one robot on the new Kong ride and it is awesome, but the rest is just like the crappy Kong that's out here now.

139
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:31,000
The thing like and it's just the same stupid water where it's like, oh, weird bugs and she's shooting at the bugs and the bug like, oh, we got hit with water.

140
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
And like the bugs like blood is on you now, but it's just water.

141
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Let's see what else?

142
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I mean, the Harry Potter ride.

143
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Fast and the Furious coming by the way.

144
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Supposedly not a screen ride though.

145
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Supposedly a real ride and not a screen ride.

146
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Ah, wonderful.

147
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I heard it here first.

148
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I found a lot of the big roller coasters in University of Orlando.

149
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I might just be getting too old for that.

150
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I like had headaches walking off of them and they just redid.

151
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Now we're getting back into the incredible Hulk.

152
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
This is stuff that Jason started talking about.

153
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
The headaches I had and the rain.

154
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I used to I used to go on the Hulk like multiple times a day when I was there and I walked off this time going like, oh, I feel really bad.

155
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I will say that I got a little headache on the Hulk as well.

156
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
OK, but it's that's a new track, too.

157
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
So maybe the track is faster or more aggressive somehow.

158
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Something like that.

159
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Nobody had a seizure like Mission Space style, which was killing people.

160
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Right.

161
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Several folks a few weeks.

162
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
The Hulk ride.

163
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I do like that they've sort of changed the idea of it.

164
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
It's just sort of like, hey, you get in line, we're going to turn you into a Hulk.

165
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:43,000
It used to be like Banner had an experiment and like something was going wrong and then he was transforming.

166
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
But now it's like you get in line like here's what we're going to do.

167
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
We're going to turn you guys into a fucking Hulk and you're going to shoot out and it's going to be great.

168
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
And like it's totally a different like context.

169
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
That being said, you still it's like just a roller coaster.

170
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
There's no robots to bring it back to what we're talking about with this.

171
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
The studios re theming and everything.

172
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I haven't been to Universal Studios proper in a while as opposed to Islands of Adventure.

173
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Do you feel is it getting confused at all being that they have taken out?

174
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
There's no tram tour.

175
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
There's less behind the scenes.

176
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
There's a roller coaster where all the sound stages used to do.

177
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Does it matter?

178
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Is it?

179
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:27,000
It seems like it matters because that park I feel like they always got away with like this set is next to this set is next to this set because it's like it's like a movie.

180
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
It's always a back lot.

181
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
It's still the park doesn't make any sense.

182
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
So it's just a jumbled mess of like New York Street and there's the Blues Brothers.

183
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
But then Shrek is down the street in his own fairy tale theater.

184
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:46,000
And then it isn't like T2 3D is in like the Schwab's Pharmacy or something.

185
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Yeah, it's a lot.

186
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Islands of Adventure.

187
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I mean, I my family has always really liked Islands of Adventure.

188
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
We always had a lot of nice times.

189
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
It really hasn't changed a lot, which is nice.

190
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Like personally, I'm like, oh, it's nice that this is still here.

191
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
But also like it really hasn't changed a lot since 1999.

192
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,000
It's bizarre because of the comic strip area most specifically.

193
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Like you still have like Beetle Bailey and Nancy and like just like Little Nemo, like comic strips that were too old for when I was little.

194
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Like I don't know what the hell Little Nemo was.

195
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
But by Nancy, do you mean Kathy? Did I say no?

196
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

197
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Nancy, Nancy. Nancy has like a big she has a big poofy like hair.

198
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,000
She looks like she looks kind of like Little Dot.

199
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Remember Little Dot from the comics?

200
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
OK, she's not an older woman. She's not like a Hallmark card.

201
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
No, she's a little girl. No, no, that's what that very weird.

202
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Oh, Mary Worth.

203
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
No, no, no, no, no. Hallmark card lady.

204
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Oh, the cranky old lady. Yeah, I can't remember her name.

205
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:06,000
We should leave this to the podcast that assuredly exists or will soon exist about a Hallmark lady, the great heroines of comic strips.

206
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I one thing I did really like was spending time.

207
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
And I know I made kind of clowned on it in the stunt show episode.

208
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:23,000
But like I enjoyed being in the Lost Continent and when I saw the Sinbad show this time, like there was a lot less jokes and a lot more fighting.

209
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Like I feel like there was a lot more.

210
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Did they give what's his name? Poon Jab?

211
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
They gave Kabob. Kabob was Kabob. Sinbad's.

212
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,000
If you didn't hear the stunt show episode, go back and learn about Sinbad.

213
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Sinbad. Voyage of the Lost Beyonds.

214
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I don't know the subtitle of the stunt show. Something like that.

215
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Everyone else was doing a lot more like intensive like fight choreography.

216
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
So I was like I was impressed by that. Also packed.

217
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:58,000
The Sinbad show was packed and the like, you know, kind of weird Poseidon walkthrough adventure was like packed.

218
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
But not a lot of crowds. This is great.

219
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
It's cool. It's almost 20 years into the game.

220
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
The classics are still hard at Islands of Adventure.

221
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
But not so at Disney's Hollywood Studios.

222
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Exactly. And it's this is a park.

223
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Disney's Hollywood Studios is a park that has had its troubles lately that it's in transition.

224
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:25,000
A lot of the original opening day attractions have been let go or turned into some awkward iteration.

225
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Like when there was an American Idol attraction and now that's gone.

226
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,000
And so we are we have bid adieu to the great movie ride.

227
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:38,000
But that but we are going to resuscitate it today, bring it back to life on this episode.

228
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
But why should I tell the tale?

229
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Why not leave it to some TV station from Tampa from 1989?

230
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:59,000
One of the most entertaining of all Disney MGM Studios theme park attractions is the great movie ride inside the Chinese theater.

231
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:11,000
It was the first idea that surfaced from the original concept team to take guests through the most golden moments in film history and actually put them in the middle of the scenes.

232
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Of course, the first obstacle was deciding which of all the moments are most golden.

233
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Tough work for the Imagineers. Which moment is the most golden?

234
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,000
They had to move. They probably had a big board up moving from golden to silver to bronze.

235
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,000
And if you were bronze, you're out of the ride. Only the most golden moments.

236
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Should we talk about the rumors about this park? Like how this park got started?

237
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
The park in general?

238
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:55,000
The story about how Universal Orlando, like, you know, they were in development for a few years of building in Orlando and brought in like the heads of other studios to see if they were interested in getting in on the park somehow.

239
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:02,000
And at the time, Michael Iser was the head of Paramount and essentially saw the model for Universal Studios Florida.

240
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:08,000
And then when he became the head of Disney a few years later, was like, we should build a movie studio.

241
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:21,000
No kidding. Really. He kept that in his pocket, which is similar to how it's rumored that Katzenberg saw the early development of A Bug's Life and sort of brought that over to DreamWorks.

242
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:27,000
He like caught it in a meeting and then just kind of kept it in the pocket, smuggled it out of the building.

243
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
This is all allegedly. Please don't sue us, Rich Wellford.

244
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Please still be on the podcast, Michael Iser. Our ultimate guest, we were just saying.

245
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Today, anyone with a BoJack connection who might be listening, please hook us up.

246
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I know you probably party with him all the time and we want to party with him, too.

247
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I've read that he just wanted people to be like, well, we could go to Universal Studios, but like if we have our own Universal Studios, they won't go to Universal Studios.

248
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:03,000
So just make it here. What does make Universal Studios here? That was his idea when he like said yes to this park.

249
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:14,000
So like that's the whole point is like the movies are at Disney and it's it for sure is the park did take a lot of elements from the original Universal Studios here in Hollywood.

250
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
There was a tram tour initially, which that's gone now.

251
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Where you went through a thing called Catastrophe Canyon, which we can cover at some point sort of equivalent to earthquake.

252
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:31,000
One of these like experiences where your tram shakes in this fire and water. Yeah. When the park first opened, it was very odd.

253
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:36,000
There was the Great Movie Ride and like an hour and a half, two hour back lot tour.

254
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:42,000
And that was it. Mm hmm. Which is sort of that in Universal Studios history.

255
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
That is kind of how that park was where like there weren't all the individual rides.

256
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:52,000
The your day at Universal Studios was you did the tour and that's like a four or five hour experience.

257
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:59,000
And and in fact, the Great Movie Ride is kind of a remnant of that era because it is a very, very long.

258
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
It was like a 20 to 30 minute ride. Yeah. I'm like there.

259
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Do we know the time probably like 20 minutes around 20 minutes, 24 minutes or so.

260
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Seemingly like in that more Universal Studios tradition now, I feel like we're in an era of extremely fast rides like three minutes, three minutes.

261
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Yeah. But I don't know. I kind of miss that era of like saying and I like it on Pirates of the Caribbean or Haunted Mansion or some of those classic attractions.

262
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:33,000
You're sitting on this thing for a very long time and clothes like both the Ellen's Energy Adventure and Great Movie Ride closed on the same day.

263
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Both like moving theater rides, both like 20 minute, 22 minutes, 22 minutes.

264
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Ellen's Energy is 45 minutes. Is it really? And it feels like it felt like it when I rode it.

265
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Extremely long, slow moving rides, the opposite of thrills.

266
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:55,000
There is not a thrill to be found on this ride. But that was part of the chart.

267
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,000
You can just say something that you can go on if you were a wimpy little kid like me.

268
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
You knew nothing would scare you until the alien popped out.

269
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:09,000
And I but I just like sink down into the seats and close my eyes. I did not like that alien.

270
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,000
No, I was scared. Yeah. Did we all saw I sobbed on the ride.

271
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,000
My mom said my sister and I were sobbing when the alien came.

272
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,000
So no one else sobbed. OK, no one else was sobbing.

273
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I cried in those parks a lot. So I did it. So the alien was the only thing that made me cry.

274
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I feel like probably the universal earthquake probably freaked me out, especially because as a child of Los Angeles, I lived under the shadow of real earthquakes.

275
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Sure. But so so let's well, it's kind of talk talk you through the attraction.

276
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Are we missing any other well, I mean, it was the opening day.

277
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,000
This was like an opening day attraction. Original attraction first 1989.

278
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Wow. And it was the last because now it's gone.

279
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,000
But it was the last opening day attraction that was still there.

280
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:05,000
That's crazy. I really like the centerpiece of the park, especially because it was in the Chinese theater, which is the what's that Disney term weenie.

281
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Do you know that that like the big thing at the center of the main street that takes you down like it's the Magic Kingdom or the Epcot ball,

282
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:20,000
the spaceship Earth and Epcot and in that park, it is the the Chinese theater.

283
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
But yes, yeah, the primary symbol of the park that's leading you.

284
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
The thing that's on the T-shirt. Yes, that's a better thing to say.

285
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Also, that phrase weenie is extremely irritating. I don't even know if I've ever heard weenie.

286
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Maybe I'm making it up. I don't know. It's somewhere in theme park lore.

287
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:44,000
That's funny you say that because I when I watch a ride through the great movie ride today and I, for whatever reason in my mind,

288
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:51,000
had convinced myself that the ride goes in chronological order of the history of the movies.

289
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:57,000
And it pretty quickly does not like the early scenes are very like the early days of movies.

290
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:02,000
But then it just jumps around. Oh, because you're into Mary Poppins very quickly.

291
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Well, let's see. Let's talk you through it. The line is a lot of fun.

292
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:13,000
You get to see real props from some of the movies you're going to go into like the Mary Poppins carousel horses.

293
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:18,000
The first thing I noticed when you're walking around there is that it's nicer than the actual Chinese theater.

294
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,000
The outside from living in Los Angeles outside much cleaner.

295
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
There's no like guys walking around in superhero costume like I was like, well, this is what it should look like.

296
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:32,000
This is the one out here should look like this. It's much less sticky.

297
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Elmos. Yeah, yeah. It is very much an idealized version of Hollywood.

298
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Yeah, yeah, which is great. The Hollywood of our dreams that has really long ago got.

299
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I mean, when it was this ride was closing, I feel like there was a lot of tributes and like blog posts

300
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:54,000
written about like this is how when I was a kid, I got interested in classic movies.

301
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,000
And I know for me, like that was a big this was a big thing.

302
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Like this made me I went and like hunted down the movies that show up in this ride.

303
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:09,000
So you've seen you like I've seen Footlight Parade three times in the last five years.

304
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I have a lot of thought a life you live in Excel.

305
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:19,000
But I was a weird 12 year old who had a VHS copy of singing in the rain and I would just watch it over and over to tapes.

306
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Right. Is that a tape might be it is long.

307
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
But between the Gene Kelly animatronic and the ride.

308
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:34,000
And then there was like a photo op in in the park where you could with a lamppost with an umbrella on it and rain would come down.

309
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,000
And I'm like this chubby 12 year old kid going like I want to be like Gene Kelly.

310
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,000
I can't fit under the umbrella. I'm still getting wet.

311
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
My sides are damp.

312
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:54,000
But I love that cue like looking at that like montage of the of the trailers the original trailers of these movies.

313
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Well, that's right. Yeah. Because in the ride you go into what 12 to 14 different movies and on the way in in the Chinese theater where the big theater screen would be you watch all of the original trailers, which is fun.

314
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:10,000
And that was probably an early me realizing that trailers were not always the way they are.

315
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Yeah. Today, like the fact that trailers used to have those crazy like spectacular.

316
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Yeah.

317
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Amazing.

318
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:24,000
I love our time over and like the number of dancer over 200 dancers.

319
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Yeah.

320
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Could you imagine if trailers were still like that?

321
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:36,000
And it's like the one to not miss the emoji movie coming to your local movie palace.

322
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
It would be better, honestly.

323
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Over 500 different emojis represented in full technicolor.

324
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Next summer prepare yourselves as the minions go to summer camp.

325
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Sounds like a little bit like D'Ampardo.

326
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,000
And with your host the minions.

327
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
That's the episode.

328
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
I mean, that's yeah.

329
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
They'll get to it one.

330
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Hopefully season 40 whatever we're heading into.

331
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Yeah, that'll be there.

332
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:09,000
But we will Facebook group minions host, please start the campaign.

333
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Now that that those trailers like that giant screen showing those trailers in like the last couple years of the ride operating.

334
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
That's the first place you see Robert Osborne, right?

335
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Like Robert Osborne.

336
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Yeah.

337
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
God rest his soul.

338
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
So they did like a couple years ago.

339
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,000
A couple years ago, they like the movie.

340
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Right.

341
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
The classic movies.

342
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Yeah.

343
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Sorry.

344
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Sponsored the ride.

345
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,000
And then they added Robert Osborne, the now deceased host of that channel.

346
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:44,000
And he just like there's a lot of him now or there was a lot of him explaining the movies and like his narration is all over the ride.

347
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:49,000
So like he does so much of the heavy lifting with the ride as far as like explaining what's going on.

348
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Did he like take away some of what the guides were supposed to do?

349
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Yes.

350
00:25:53,000 --> 00:26:02,000
This is the thing that irked me when I got my job as a tour guide at Universal Studios in 2006 was so much of the fun stuff was given over to Whoopi Goldberg.

351
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
And now Billy Bush.

352
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
And now Jimmy Fallon.

353
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
That's correct.

354
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:17,000
In fact, the most infuriating thing for me was that Billy Bush now, you know, Trump related philanderer.

355
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
I guess he's not.

356
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,000
But yeah, you know, he's been exiled from television.

357
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,000
That creep got to say, we'll see you in the movies.

358
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
And I didn't get to say it.

359
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
I'm still.

360
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:35,000
You had gotten to say it and then they changed it or just started working there one summer prior.

361
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:40,000
I would have gotten to say the classic line, we'll see you in the movies, which is why I now do now.

362
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
That's my common goodbye.

363
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:47,000
If I'm hanging out with people at a bar or something, I see you in the movies.

364
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
I don't say I love you to my wife.

365
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
I say, see you in the movies.

366
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
It's an important phrase to me.

367
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:59,000
As you go to sleep at night praying you wake up in the morning or not.

368
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
I hope so.

369
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Yeah, we're scared of us.

370
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
All right.

371
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Well, hopefully see in the movies.

372
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Anyway, where were we?

373
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Robert Osborne.

374
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
You're in the queue.

375
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Yeah, so he's taken over a lot of like information on the ride now.

376
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Honestly, the update is a little it was a little too much, a little too much.

377
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Not salvage the ride, did not was not enough of a hip updates to make them keep it in the park.

378
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:29,000
I don't know if it was like the first off, I have to say Turner Classic Movies rules.

379
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Like it's great that there's just a channel that shows like uncut classic movies that are very well curated.

380
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:40,000
And there's no commercials or minimal commerce, just commercials for other movies.

381
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
No dumb original series.

382
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:49,000
No, but yeah, I mean, I didn't ride it with Robert Osborne in there.

383
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,000
But from what I saw, yeah, it seemed like a lot.

384
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:58,000
And some and like a elderly man dryly discussing movie facts.

385
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
It was not the like boost of energy.

386
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Yeah, I don't think that I don't know.

387
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Yeah, I can't imagine that they were like, well, we know it'll bring more kids in is that this old man will tell them about a 1930s movie.

388
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Like this will really reignite the children.

389
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:20,000
I think it probably came down to like, you know, they needed a sponsor and Turner Classic Movies gave this ride a few more years of life.

390
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Right. Like it was probably a practical concern.

391
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
And I would like a pure sponsorship money issue.

392
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Yeah. Yeah.

393
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Well, but the thing that maintained throughout the entire history was that you entered this wonderful room with this big, bright marquee.

394
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:42,000
And you got onto a big, big cardboard box looking vehicle that moved very, very slowly.

395
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:51,000
And you were whisked away by your guide, a flat speaking 18 year old wearing an usher vest.

396
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Well, hooray for Hollywood played, which as a kid just got me so excited.

397
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
I loved it.

398
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
It was a little movie.

399
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
I was so excited.

400
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Take it away, CB, they say at the start.

401
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Like, oh, Ben and Cecil B. DeMille says like action or someone.

402
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Oh, yeah. They call action on the ride.

403
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
You start moving.

404
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
And I'm glad they never changed that.

405
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
They never like updated directors on that.

406
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:21,000
It was a take it away, Gareth Edwards.

407
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
No one would have been.

408
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Take it away, Colin Trevorrow.

409
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Wait, maybe don't actually scratch that Colin.

410
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:46,000
So then you go through under the marquee, essentially into a movie and you go into you start off with the Golden Age of musical movies, which yeah, we mentioned Footlight Parade.

411
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:55,000
There's a giant like statue of all the dancers and beauties and Footlight Parade.

412
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
There's a ton of them.

413
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
There's like a ton of like there's like 30.

414
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Yeah.

415
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,000
And then there's like projections from like, I think other Busby Berkeley movies.

416
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:10,000
So a few years ago, I got a copy of Footlight Parade and watched it.

417
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
And it is an insane movie.

418
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
It stars James Cagney.

419
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
And it is like two and a half hours long, I think.

420
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:28,000
And it is about a theater company who like back in the day, giant movie palaces would have like musical numbers in between like the different movies and stuff.

421
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,000
And you would see like a fully produced Broadway number.

422
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,000
And this theater company is like in danger of going under.

423
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,000
So like the whole movie is them trying to figure out what they're going to do, what they're going to do.

424
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:50,000
And then the solution is they have to perform three different giant musical numbers at three different theaters in one town in one night.

425
00:30:50,000 --> 00:31:06,000
And the movie ends with three giant set pieces back to back, including the last song in the movie, a song called Shanghai Lil, which is insanely racist in a huge number of ways.

426
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:13,000
But it's the it's the moment when James Cagney finally has a number like he is an amazing like song and dance man.

427
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
And he doesn't sing and dance the whole movie.

428
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:25,000
And then the last number he tumbles into like he accidentally falls into doing this number and like his character like nails it.

429
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:35,000
But it includes Ruby Keeler playing an Asian character named Shanghai Lil and any number of other racial stereo.

430
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Let me ask you this question. What from the because the the scene in the ride, which number is that from?

431
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Is that the racist number? No, that's if you haven't been on the ride or you don't recall, it's like a kind of a tiered cake that a lot of dancers are.

432
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,000
It's a lot of ladies on a giant cake on. Yeah.

433
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:59,000
And and like the spectacle of these footlight parade and 42nd Street.

434
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:08,000
It's also kind of like like this shows up in a lot of Busby Berkeley movies with like just like a few dozen dancers doing an amazing choreographed number.

435
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,000
And that's really what the ride is pulling from.

436
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:16,000
But like, yeah, really glosses over some of the racial stereotypes.

437
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:28,000
And there's also a giant sequence where they make a big picture of FDR in the movie, like a bunch of men in sailor outfits like hold up signs.

438
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,000
And like there's a lot of like our boys in uniform stuff.

439
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Well, that sounds good. Yeah.

440
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Yeah. In the past, there was no good movie.

441
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,000
I don't think they're like jaws.

442
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:43,000
It's amazing to witness and think about they were doing it all practically.

443
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:47,000
But yeah, in terms of like, oh, this says not exactly held up.

444
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:55,000
So tourists every day from 1989 until several weeks ago were being whisked into this film.

445
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Footlight parade featuring a song called Shanghai Will.

446
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,000
And then and then you see a Gene Kelly animatron.

447
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,000
And then it goes right to singing in the rain, which was another child.

448
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
That's a giant jump in film history.

449
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Yes. Yeah.

450
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Because seeing the rain, oddly enough, is essentially a jukebox musical.

451
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Most of those songs appeared in other lesser remembered MGM musicals.

452
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:24,000
And then like they were brought back for singing in the rain like 15, 20 or like our own personal Robert Oz.

453
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
I am. Yeah.

454
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Comforting old man. Yeah.

455
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Telling us about the old films.

456
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Would it surprise you to find out I played Robert Osborne once in a show at the UCB theater?

457
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,000
It would not. OK.

458
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Did how long was the standing ovation?

459
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Longer than the show.

460
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Two and a half hours. The length of Footlight Parade.

461
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,000
This has been your musical history.

462
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Well, then you go into one of the other great film musicals, Mary Poppins,

463
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,000
which is the first I believe for the only representation of Mary Poppins in the theme.

464
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Which is crazy.

465
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:13,000
That's what I had that thought, too, because there's an old there's a video online that everyone should look at where Tony Baxter is showing.

466
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Tony Baxter, one of the most famous imagineers, he had a whole book that he made a Mary Poppins ride in sketches.

467
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,000
That's really incredible. That would have been an amazing dark ride.

468
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,000
And it was like kind of his way into Disney.

469
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:29,000
But yeah, for this to be the only Mary Poppins like Mary Poppins should be a ride.

470
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:34,000
It's weird that like this is the only thing we've got was a couple like and now it's gone.

471
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:45,000
I think they're going to put some like here's my fear is they're going to put like Emily Bunt and Lin-Manuel animatronics in the British World Showcase in Epcot.

472
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:50,000
They're talking about putting they're going to put something in there. Poppins thing when the sequel.

473
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Yeah, when the new one comes out and it's like, don't please, please just put the old characters in like or, you know, how about this?

474
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Let's do the attraction based on saving Mr. Banks in Disneyland.

475
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:15,000
So there's a you go through a ride in Disneyland where you watch Tom Hanks Walt Disney take Mary L. Travers through through Disneyland.

476
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:19,000
So you're in Disneyland. You're in 60s Disneyland in this Disneyland ride.

477
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:23,000
And Walt is a folksy southern man like Tom Hanks.

478
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Hello, Mrs. Travers. Good to see you, Mrs. Travers. Why come on in?

479
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:38,000
There's a five minute scene where you just see a very tired Walt listening to the entirety of Feed the Birds like thinking about his life, the weight of the world on his shoulders.

480
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,000
I have to build this experimental city.

481
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Cancer infected his brain to the point of the city is got the city.

482
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Build this ski lodge in the mountains.

483
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,000
I've got to build this city of tomorrow.

484
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Seriously, that voice is screwing my ass.

485
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:02,000
That voice is so weird. A trip through Walt Disney's collapsing mind.

486
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,000
There's another we're going to do a lot of ride pitches over the course of these episodes.

487
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:14,000
And there's one. But so here's at this point is where the ride gets really exciting because you're you board with two different ride vehicles.

488
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
And at this point, they split off.

489
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:23,000
One keeps going into the old west and another goes into sort of like a like an old New York world.

490
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:36,000
And at this point, the guide who we have been with is gets caught in a shootout and he gets replaced basically by either an old cowboy or a 1940s guy.

491
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Oh, God. Hey, what do we got here?

492
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Is this a podcast? So somebody's just broken into the studio.

493
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Who are you? See, oh, God.

494
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
OK, OK. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hi, Jack.

495
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,000
And this podcast, the ride.

496
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Excuse me. How did you know we were here?

497
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:00,000
How did you find us? Bugsie. Bugsie Malone.

498
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
And I'm going to take over this podcast.

499
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Oh, God. Please. Hang on.

500
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Hey, hey, please. Wait.

501
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
You know, I mean, I mean, business.

502
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
No, he's got a Tommy gun.

503
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:23,000
For those of you who cannot see what's happening and most of you cannot, a pinstripe suit wearing 40s gangster has broken into the studio.

504
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
He has a Tommy gun.

505
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
He's safe. What's that over there?

506
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Is that a red on air podcast light?

507
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:35,000
I hate red on air podcast lights.

508
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,000
We shot out our red on air podcast light.

509
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
There's no way to know whether we're on the air or not now.

510
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,000
No more red on air podcast light.

511
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Please. You've already robbed us of the most precious experience of hosting a podcast.

512
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
What is your what are you trying to do here? Mugsie.

513
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Hey, now, mind your P's and Q's. OK.

514
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
OK. Are you minding them?

515
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
I'm minding them.

516
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
You're minding the P's.

517
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
I'm minding the P's and the Q's.

518
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
The Q's.

519
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Yes.

520
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:07,000
And put your valuables in my mouth.

521
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Oh, God.

522
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
What counts as a valuable?

523
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
I want to suck on them. Yeah.

524
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Give me them jewels.

525
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Here, take this aux cord.

526
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,000
It's not connected to a microphone here.

527
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Folks, again, it appears a 1940s gangster has hijacked our podcast.

528
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:29,000
I might take this podcast a ride for a little ride myself.

529
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
No, no, no. Please.

530
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
There's no way of knowing what this monster has in mind.

531
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Mind them.

532
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
OK, OK. Wait, wait.

533
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Which are the Ness's? Which letters?

534
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
The P's and the Q's.

535
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
The P's, the Q's. I'm so sorry.

536
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
All right.

537
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Let's take this podcast a ride to another zone here.

538
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Oh, no. He's in control. Mugsie's in control now.

539
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
That's right. That's your name, right?

540
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
No, no, no. Mugsie?

541
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
It's Bugsie.

542
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Bugsie.

543
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Bugsie.

544
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Bugsie.

545
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
It's funny in the ride, it's Mugsie.

546
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
No, but now it's Bugsie.

547
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
OK, here it's Bugsie.

548
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Bugsie.

549
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Why don't you buzz off?

550
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Oh, hey, hey.

551
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Hey, hey, Scott, come on.

552
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
I'm sorry. I don't mean to be a hero.

553
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
I'm not a hero.

554
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
I'm a coward.

555
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
I'm crying just like I did when I was a child on this ride.

556
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,000
I'm going to put some money in Bugsie's mouth

557
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
and let him suck on it.

558
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,000
OK, that's calm him down.

559
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Bugsie is now eating money.

560
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Hey, let's go.

561
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
We've got to get out of here.

562
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
I'm unwanted.

563
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,000
I'll be sent to Sing Sing if I don't get out of here.

564
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,000
I'll be sent to a thousand years in Sing Sing.

565
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Let's get out of here.

566
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Guys, Jason Mike, we could be accomplices if we aren't careful.

567
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:41,000
OK, let's just try to lay low as we keep explaining

568
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
the history of the great movie.

569
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Is that OK if we just keep doing?

570
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,000
There's a James Cagney animatronic,

571
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,000
public enemy James Cagney, not Footlight Prey James Cagney.

572
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Which is kind of interesting.

573
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
He's a good friend of mine.

574
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
You know him?

575
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Oh, yeah.

576
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:02,000
We gangsta all the way back to the roaring 20s.

577
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Have you been on heists together?

578
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Is that what you're saying?

579
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
That's right.

580
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,000
We were sent to Sing Sing before.

581
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Oh, OK.

582
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Did you help him bust out and that's how he can be on the ride?

583
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Yeah, I busted out of Sing Sing.

584
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Oh, OK.

585
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Well, I guess thank you because James Cagney animatronics really good.

586
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Yeah, it's good.

587
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
It's a good robot.

588
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Thanks, Bugsie.

589
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,000
There's also in this section here, I looked up in the names of the other gangsters,

590
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
our brains, legs and weasel.

591
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Are you familiar with these three?

592
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
These are also your comrades.

593
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
You're talking about my gang.

594
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
My gang of thieves.

595
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,000
We busted out of Sing Sing together.

596
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,000
So brains, legs and weasel, they were all in Sing Sing with you and James Cagney.

597
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Yeah, yeah, we busted out, you see.

598
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:49,000
High tailed it out of there to Shanghai ourselves this year.

599
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Podcast.

600
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Did you hide in a laundry truck?

601
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Yeah.

602
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Oh, OK.

603
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
We jumped right into it.

604
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Tell you how it happens.

605
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Was there too.

606
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
You know what?

607
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
I'm going to say I don't I don't believe your story.

608
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
I don't.

609
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Scott, Scott, you're telling the truth.

610
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Do you believe this?

611
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, that's what I taught.

612
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Oh, God.

613
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
That's what I know.

614
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:19,000
You know, that may sound like just a wave file of a Tommy gun.

615
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:23,000
But if you were here in person, he is absolutely demolished the studio.

616
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
This isn't even we're new here.

617
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,000
This is going to mess it up for all the other Feral podcast.

618
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Joe boys are going to come in here and they're they're not going to have Sonic Clarity anymore.

619
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Yeah, I stole all the animal Lisa puppets from this year.

620
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
You got to give those animal Lisa puppets back.

621
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:44,000
I might get a I might get a bucket to on the black market from these animal Lisa puppets.

622
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
No, no, no, don't.

623
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:50,000
And do not take your eyes off of that Rick and Morty autographed poster.

624
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Maybe I'll put my eyes on it.

625
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
No, no, no, no, no.

626
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Now my hands did not sign that for it to be stolen.

627
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Now my mouth.

628
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Oh, no, it's putting it in his mouth.

629
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,000
This gangster and his disgusting oral fixation here.

630
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Put some of my rate, my rings that I wear on my fingers in your mouth.

631
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Yeah.

632
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,000
You don't touch all this priceless memorabilia.

633
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Oh, my wedding ring is room.

634
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Gold teeth at Sing Sing.

635
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Oh, God, you're a truly vile man.

636
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Wait, wait, wait.

637
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
What?

638
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Where are we now?

639
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Well, now we can't just anymore, folks.

640
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:38,000
No, we are, of course, looking at the man with no name, a Clint Eastwood standing outside of a saloon atop his great horse.

641
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Do you know about it?

642
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Now, do you I know, you know, Jimmy Cagney, but do you know John Wayne?

643
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
I've never been here before.

644
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,000
This guy doesn't look so tough.

645
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Well, he's the most he's the toughest, roughest, rudest, tunest cowboy in all of cinema.

646
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Show some respect.

647
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:56,000
The toughest World War Two draft dodger there was John Wayne.

648
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Where are we right now?

649
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Are we in Joyze?

650
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:06,000
I've never seen these these horses and these these cantinas.

651
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
What are we in?

652
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Joyze?

653
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:12,000
A lot has changed in the world in the time that you were trapped in Sing Sing.

654
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
You don't know about the gold rush.

655
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
A lot of a lot has happened.

656
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Well, maybe I can get myself a few Ben Franklin's while I'm here.

657
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Oh, no, no, no, no money at that point.

658
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Put them in my mouth.

659
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
No, he's right.

660
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Oh, my God.

661
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:36,000
You folks, you should really not have to watch a man put money and tools and artifacts in his mouth.

662
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:41,000
That picture of the guy with all the billiard balls in his mouth like this gangsters mouth.

663
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,000
I'm sorry.

664
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
It's nothing like that photo.

665
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Nothing like that.

666
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
No, no, no, you don't look silly.

667
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,000
You look very cool with those puffed out cheeks.

668
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
You have minded those peas and cubes.

669
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
I will continue to mind them.

670
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
I will go back to mining them.

671
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
OK, OK.

672
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
All right.

673
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
All right.

674
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
And cues in mind.

675
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Let's just try to look over there.

676
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,000
A different cowboy from a different Western era Clint Eastwood.

677
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Oh, yeah.

678
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Well, yeah, I notice this guy, Clint Eastwood.

679
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:12,000
There's also this guy, Ethan, from a film that I like called The Soy Cheese.

680
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Oh, so are you a film fan?

681
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Oh, I love the movies.

682
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Oh, what are some of your favorites?

683
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Ten Thousand Years and Sing Sing.

684
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,000
That one doesn't have a lot of mass appeal.

685
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
It might only relate to folks like you.

686
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Was that your sentence?

687
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Ten thousand years?

688
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
I got ten thousand years.

689
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,000
How many did you serve?

690
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Poof, poof, poof.

691
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Not even a week.

692
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Oh, wow.

693
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,000
That's how fast I busted at an age.

694
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Geez, you got the land of media.

695
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
That's crazy.

696
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
You know what?

697
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,000
I'm starting to think maybe this guy's not so bad to have around.

698
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
He's a smart guy.

699
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
He's a real character.

700
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Just like all of us.

701
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
What did you get set up the river for?

702
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Hey, I got set for putting jewels in my mouth.

703
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Oh, OK.

704
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Yeah.

705
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
I would.

706
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
I think it's against the law around where I'm from.

707
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
It's a sanitary concern.

708
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Yeah, yeah, that's right.

709
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,000
I also I also like going on the great movie ride.

710
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Oh, wow.

711
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,000
So that's exactly what we're talking about.

712
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
It's a shame it's gone.

713
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Huh?

714
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:19,000
I think Mickey and Minnie's runaway railroad might be a good attraction,

715
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
whether they're the ride that's taking its place.

716
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
Hey, the only Mickey and Minnie's I know.

717
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:26,000
I savin' ten thousand years in Sing Sing.

718
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
No.

719
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
All right.

720
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Well, I know if there's one thing, you know, maybe you might enjoy a mouse or two,

721
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
but I know you don't like a rat.

722
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:41,000
Hey, the last thing Bugsy Malone wants to see is a rat.

723
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Are you a rat?

724
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,000
No.

725
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Jason, tell him you're not a rat.

726
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
I'm not a rat.

727
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Snitches get stitches.

728
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
How about a stool pigeon?

729
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Are you a stool pigeon?

730
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
No, no, no, I swear.

731
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000
I'm no stool pigeon.

732
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Mike, are you a stool pigeon?

733
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000
No, I'm not.

734
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
I'm not.

735
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
I'm just trying to call the police real quick.

736
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
I'm suddenly worried that you're on the way to the cops.

737
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
What's all that mumbling over there?

738
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,000
Some studio stuff, just like disturbances on the mic, feedback.

739
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
And you don't know how we're playing.

740
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
We're getting radio signals from a different place.

741
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,000
All right, all right.

742
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Well, keep minding your P's and Q's and nobody will get hoiced.

743
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Where does this podcast or I go to next?

744
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Well, the next part of the attraction is the this is probably the scariest part of the attraction,

745
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,000
even more scary than having a tommy gun pointed at your head.

746
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:29,000
This is where you go into the spaceship Nostromo from the from the 1979 film Alien.

747
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Space ship. What the what with us?

748
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
What's a spaceship?

749
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Oh, well, so that's a new thing.

750
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Since the 40s, when you're from, we've opened up a whole new part of the universe

751
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
that we can go to above the earth.

752
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:47,000
It's called space. And to get up there, we use space ships,

753
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:53,000
the highly advanced technological cars, the car that takes you to the stars.

754
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Wow. The moon. The moon.

755
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Sure. Yeah. The moon.

756
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:00,000
The man has walked on the moon. Hey, maybe that man saw my old lady

757
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,000
because I sent her there last night.

758
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Oh, no. Bugsy.

759
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:11,000
You can't wait. We should remember it was acceptable in his time, but it's not today.

760
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:16,000
No, especially not when we're talking about Alien starring Sigourney Weaver.

761
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Ripley, one of the strongest heroines in cinematic history.

762
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,000
I don't know if you know this. Women star in movies today.

763
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
That's a new development since your time as well.

764
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Sigourney Weaver, I'd like to challenge you to a boxing match.

765
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,000
No, no. She'd clean your whistle, Bugsy.

766
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
She'd clean your clock. Yeah.

767
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,000
You mind your P's and Q's. You're talking about that kind of thing.

768
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:40,000
Oh, all right. And even this alien is a lady, too.

769
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Oh, no. Hey, Scott, I think that alien up there likes you.

770
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:52,000
You don't say, huh? Why don't you give her a big smooch?

771
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Oh, ew, no. That's disgusting.

772
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Oh, I basically want to barf. Don't say that.

773
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Why don't you smooch both of her mouths, the inside one and the outside one?

774
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:07,000
I will not. I'm married one mouth at a time for me.

775
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:12,000
That acid blood could really choose through some bars at Sing Sing.

776
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,000
All right, Jason will kiss the alien, but Scott doesn't have to.

777
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:23,000
And there is a full sized alien alien here in Farallon Studios.

778
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:26,000
He can constantly peeking through the ceiling like in the ride.

779
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,000
It's unnerving. Nobody noticed it until Bugsy showed up.

780
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Jason, come on, kiss the alien, get it over with.

781
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Do it for all of us. Be a man.

782
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Yeah. Yeah.

783
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Why don't you put your tongue in it?

784
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:46,000
For those of you who can't see, the gangster has put his Tommy gun down.

785
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
He's quite aroused.

786
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,000
And maybe this is my chance to get the drop on him.

787
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
Just grab.

788
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
No, no, no, no, no. OK, OK, OK.

789
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,000
I'm sorry. Go back to watching Jason kiss the alien with a multiple mass.

790
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Take the inner mouth with your two hands.

791
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,000
This is really nice.

792
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
Hold that inside alien mouth.

793
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,000
How do you know how it's done immediately?

794
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
Put the whole inner mouth in your mouth.

795
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:17,000
Why did it take us all the way up to its outer mouth so that the outer mouth can give your face a little kiss when you go down the inner.

796
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:22,000
Yeah, Jason is just using you for positive euphoric right now.

797
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
He's kissing the alien's tiny mouth.

798
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,000
So right. Yeah.

799
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:29,000
All right. Well, that was a good one of our ho again.

800
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,000
Love is very helpful.

801
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:34,000
He's helped one of our hosts discover who he really is and what he's into.

802
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,000
It's good for both of us.

803
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:40,000
I you guys go ahead for the tour here and get to know them.

804
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Oh, all right. Jason is going to go up into the rafters with the alien.

805
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
All right. And an alien.

806
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:50,000
That's pretty woke.

807
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Hey, I would say fucking an alien is the wokest thing you could do.

808
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Oh, yeah, I guess he's right.

809
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
I mean, whatever that word means.

810
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,000
All right.

811
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Extra is an extra terrestrial sexual, I guess.

812
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Yeah, an extra terrestrial like I like the sound of that.

813
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
OK, now. So let's leave Jason behind.

814
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
Hopefully we'll catch up with him at some point.

815
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:15,000
But now we're now we're heading into the the Indiana Jones experience.

816
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
Do you know about it? He's from your time.

817
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:22,000
You ever bump into him? Hey, yeah, I knew a guy named Indiana Jones.

818
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Yeah, he fixed the races over in the Indianapolis 500 for me.

819
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Oh, so we made great all those sacks of money and dollars.

820
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:36,000
So he would fix horse races and then you would win money.

821
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:39,000
Same guy who did the white socks.

822
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Yeah, I'm in the fixing thing to see you ever run into a guy named Williams.

823
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:49,000
Williams. Oh, my. Yeah, that guy.

824
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:52,000
He's a real greaser. Yeah, he is. He's a real greaser.

825
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Yeah, we would have fights with him and his greaser gang.

826
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:59,000
Oh, geez. So you had to watch out for his for switch blades.

827
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:04,000
Yeah, yeah, we would we would put point switch blades at each other.

828
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:07,000
My gang versus my Williams gang.

829
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:13,000
But sometimes his switch blade was a comb and he would just comb his hair back.

830
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:17,000
And I thought that was pretty smart. Yeah, that sounds exactly like Mott Williams.

831
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:21,000
I thought it was a switch blade. You for sure have dealt with the real Williams.

832
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:27,000
It was a switch blade, but it was a comb and he used it. The comb is greasy, greaser hair back.

833
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:31,000
Now, I don't suppose your weapon is secretly a comb as well.

834
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Oh, you mean this? Clearly, it's not. It's not. It's a real Tommy gun.

835
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
If anything more must by the bullets.

836
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:44,000
Bugsie doesn't like to get too familiar with the with the common folk that he's robbing cointely.

837
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,000
All right. Well, let's keep a comfortable distance.

838
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:54,000
All right. So tell me about this Indiana Jones guy. OK, so so this is this is interesting because this is the first

839
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:59,000
appearance of Indiana Jones in the theme parks predates the Indiana Jones ride.

840
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:06,000
It is a couple of rooms which are pretty impressive rooms, obviously littered with snakes and the first Indiana Jones animatronic,

841
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:14,000
which is like carrying the the arc out of these like lifting up this this big golden thing with the with John Reese.

842
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:17,000
Did someone say gold? Yeah.

843
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:24,000
Well, that room on that attraction does have a lot of gold, a lot of a lot of a lot of valuables in it.

844
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,000
But we've already given you all of ours.

845
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
I've given you all my money, all my rings on my finger.

846
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
Like there's so what do you want. Why do you need more?

847
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:38,000
Hey, hey, Bugsie likes to make as much dough as possible, you know, before he makes a pizza made out of jewels.

848
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
He's got to get the dough.

849
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:45,000
I mean, look, looking around this recording studio, there's not much value left to you.

850
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:50,000
I mean, except maybe for that that ruby that magically powers our mixing board.

851
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,000
Yeah. Yeah. There's a whole.

852
00:52:53,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Yeah. Look, I think you should not look at that, even looking at that magical ruby that's really big and like it's illuminated and it's been here for a long time.

853
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:06,000
Right. Red. A magical type of magical chunk of ice.

854
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:11,000
I really think you shouldn't go. You shouldn't do it. Stop. Oh, do not touch that.

855
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:21,000
Well, that. Oh, for people who cannot hear or cannot see what's happening, the pinstripe suit wearing 40s gangsters now been joined by a new hooded man, a man in a cloak.

856
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:27,000
Hey, stand back. I'm trying to get this here ravioli chunk of ice and get put my lips on it.

857
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:37,000
This ruby is cursed. All who have tried have perished. That's why Farrell got such a great rate on this building's rent.

858
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:40,000
So that makes a lot of sense around the ruby. I see you better.

859
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
You better listen to it. It seems like he knows what he's talking about.

860
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:47,000
He doesn't care about a quiz. Oh, God. Doesn't scare Bugsy Malone.

861
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Oh, he's walking over to it. I guess he's going to take a look at the idea, man.

862
00:53:52,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Put my lips on it. I don't care about a quiz. Oh, he's puckering up. Oh, boy. Oh. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, my God.

863
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:14,000
The power briefly flashed on and off here at Farrell and and and the 40s gangster has just turned into an ashen pile of rubble.

864
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,800
a coal black skeleton.

865
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:20,440
And that's the magic of podcasts.

866
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:22,280
Whoa, Jason.

867
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:23,520
It was me all along.

868
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:24,360
You were in the cloak.

869
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:25,160
The guy was you?

870
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:25,660
Yeah.

871
00:54:25,660 --> 00:54:28,200
I thought you were busy kissing that alien.

872
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:29,280
Working his double innocence.

873
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:31,360
I made love to the alien, and then I ran back in here

874
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:34,400
through a cloak on and hid by the cursed ruby that

875
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:36,760
haunts and powers feral audio.

876
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:37,260
Wow.

877
00:54:37,260 --> 00:54:37,880
Oh my god.

878
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:39,840
This, I have to say, I mean, I don't know how well you guys

879
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:42,200
remember the other episodes that we've recorded,

880
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:44,360
but it seems like we just talked about rides.

881
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:49,000
And today seems very high in terms of magical content.

882
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,600
A lot of crazy stuff is happening.

883
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:51,880
A lot of surprise to me.

884
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:53,880
I thought we would just dryly walk through the ride

885
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:54,920
like we normally do.

886
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:56,200
But today, yeah.

887
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:59,600
And air our grievances about changes to the park.

888
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:01,520
Maybe drop some mild profanities.

889
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:05,560
But instead, all these, but the most special guests of all

890
00:55:05,560 --> 00:55:06,920
have showed up.

891
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:07,280
Hold on.

892
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:09,440
I'm going to go try to pry my rings and money out

893
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:10,800
of this dead man's mouth.

894
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:11,300
Oh, yeah.

895
00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:12,200
Oh, OK.

896
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:13,280
Don't touch the ruby.

897
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:13,960
You work on that, please.

898
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:14,560
Here, I got it.

899
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:14,960
Yeah.

900
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:15,480
Oh, OK.

901
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:16,000
OK, great.

902
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:16,920
Here's your stuff, too.

903
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:18,200
Oh, thanks.

904
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:21,640
And let's give back that oxcord and all those.

905
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:23,000
Where'd all the hundreds come from?

906
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:23,680
Those all yours?

907
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:24,960
I guess you keep those.

908
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:25,460
Ah, right.

909
00:55:25,460 --> 00:55:26,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

910
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:27,200
I don't want to touch them.

911
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:28,240
Old money bag, Carlson.

912
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:29,400
A little finder's fee for me.

913
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:32,960
Full of saliva that, I bet all the saliva surrounding

914
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:36,840
all the jewels in his mouth helped him get electrocuted.

915
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:38,000
Yeah, it probably works a lot of sense.

916
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:38,720
And probably as a conductor.

917
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:39,480
Makes a lot of sense.

918
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:41,360
Anyway, then there's a Tarzan room.

919
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:42,800
Yeah, so then you go into the Tarzan.

920
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:44,680
Yeah, there's a cool Tarzan room.

921
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:47,080
Johnny Weissmuller and Maureen O'Sullivan.

922
00:55:47,080 --> 00:55:52,480
It is crazy that there was a ride for 30 years, 20-plus years,

923
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:57,920
featuring a Johnny Weissmuller animatronic.

924
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:01,000
Yeah, if you want, you could go to the parks.

925
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:04,360
Kids could see Anna and Elsa and Johnny Weissmuller.

926
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:05,520
Johnny Weissmuller.

927
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:06,880
The magic of Disney World.

928
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:08,760
I was thinking, it's weird that they didn't just

929
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:11,120
theme it to the cartoon Tarzan.

930
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:12,800
Like when Disney's Tarzan came out,

931
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:13,880
it would have been such a simple thing

932
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:15,640
to switch it to the cartoon.

933
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:17,000
That seems like a thing they would do.

934
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,840
Put a Disney store level kind of dummy up.

935
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:20,880
Just a mask.

936
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:23,600
Just a cartoon mask on the same thing.

937
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:25,120
And be like, it's Disney's Tarzan.

938
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:26,520
And no one would have given a shit.

939
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:29,600
Or Brendan Fraser's George of the Jungle.

940
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:30,100
Oh, sure.

941
00:56:30,100 --> 00:56:30,960
Disney property.

942
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:32,800
A lot of 90s properties could have filled in.

943
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:36,080
The whole problem with the ride is that they did not

944
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:37,880
keep updating the films.

945
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:40,640
You can only assume that in the original conception

946
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:42,760
of the great movie ride, it was like, oh,

947
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:44,800
and we'll update it once every five years.

948
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:47,360
But they didn't particularly do it.

949
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:48,320
Yeah.

950
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:50,440
But a cool room when I was going through.

951
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:52,920
One of the better rooms, honestly.

952
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:55,160
Jungle room, he flies back and forth on the,

953
00:56:55,160 --> 00:56:57,520
he does the yell, the famous yell.

954
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:58,800
We all know it.

955
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:01,840
There also could have been a Mighty Joe Young

956
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:04,960
with Charlize Theron.

957
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:05,460
Yeah.

958
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:06,320
I didn't know she was in that.

959
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:07,800
I don't know if I ever saw that.

960
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:10,720
She was, I just heard her on a Bill Simmons podcast,

961
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:11,640
and he brought that up.

962
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:14,120
And she was like, let's keep moving.

963
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:18,760
She did not activate and talk about George of the Jungle.

964
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:21,840
Anyway, yeah, so they missed a lot of opportunities.

965
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:24,400
Or the new Tarzan, Kellan Lutz Tarzan.

966
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:28,760
There's been a lot of Tarzans they could have updated with.

967
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:31,200
But they stayed in the past, and we stayed in the past,

968
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:33,840
with the Casablanca scene.

969
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:36,240
That was another movie, a 12-year-old me

970
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:38,200
hunted down at the video store.

971
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:41,000
And I feel like I did not understand

972
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,520
a lot of the context of it.

973
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:44,560
I remember watching that a bunch when I was younger.

974
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:49,600
And Casablanca to a little kid in 1996 doesn't really sink in.

975
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:51,320
You mean the Nazi stuff?

976
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:52,160
Yeah.

977
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:56,040
I don't think I knew about World War II a little,

978
00:57:56,040 --> 00:58:00,560
but I didn't know about Vichy France and that sort of thing.

979
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:04,200
And the bit at the end where they throw the Vichy water

980
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:08,400
in the trash can and the song plays.

981
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:10,120
See, I don't remember all this stuff.

982
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:11,760
If that 40s gangster were still around,

983
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:14,360
he probably could share his film buffalos.

984
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:14,880
He knows.

985
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:15,960
That's right around his era.

986
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:17,280
That's right around the same time.

987
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:20,360
So he probably saw that movie and maybe lived the same time.

988
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:22,280
So it's possible.

989
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:23,680
Is that also the plane?

990
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:24,720
Is that also the plane?

991
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:26,960
Wasn't there a rumor that that is really the plane

992
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:28,280
from Casablanca?

993
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:31,000
I don't mean to interrupt, Jason, but right behind you,

994
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:34,800
oh my god, the smoking, ashy skeleton of the gangster.

995
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:37,520
I'm back.

996
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:39,320
His bones are chattering.

997
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:43,320
He's doing a graveyard dance.

998
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:44,760
I'm back.

999
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:47,320
This is not canon.

1000
00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:51,400
So as you were saying, Jason, that is the actual plane

1001
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:52,480
from Casablanca.

1002
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:53,200
Oh, yeah.

1003
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:53,680
OK.

1004
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:55,240
That they use in the movie ride.

1005
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:56,040
How about that?

1006
00:58:56,040 --> 00:58:56,520
Yeah.

1007
00:58:56,520 --> 00:58:58,680
Stick him up.

1008
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:00,920
He still is, but now it's firing bones

1009
00:59:00,920 --> 00:59:01,960
instead of bullets.

1010
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:02,480
OK.

1011
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:05,840
Clinkity clinkity.

1012
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:09,320
This is a lot like Walt Disney's the skeleton dance.

1013
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:10,120
Did you see that?

1014
00:59:10,120 --> 00:59:10,960
You're a movie buff.

1015
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:12,520
That would have been our new release.

1016
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:13,440
No.

1017
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:14,520
Oh, OK.

1018
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:15,720
Well, I can't see them all.

1019
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:17,880
And they don't, not too many movie screenings

1020
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:19,320
in Sing Sing, I'd imagine.

1021
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:20,600
Hey, well, glad you're back.

1022
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:21,520
Glad you could join us.

1023
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:24,440
And I'm glad that your soul somehow survived

1024
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:27,640
in that ashen rubble of a skeleton

1025
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:29,000
that you now pile into the body.

1026
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,760
All my old gang members up there.

1027
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:34,560
Oh, it was Bugsy and Mugsy.

1028
00:59:34,560 --> 00:59:36,160
Squint and Beans.

1029
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:38,600
Squint and Beans were all up there.

1030
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:40,480
What about Brains, Legs and Weasel?

1031
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:42,120
Brains and Legs.

1032
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:43,640
Oh, it was wonderful.

1033
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:47,240
All my old gangster friends, we were reunited.

1034
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:48,920
But then did God send you back here

1035
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:51,520
because of your unfinished business?

1036
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:54,320
They wanted me to set the record straight

1037
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:56,240
on the Casablanca plane.

1038
00:59:56,240 --> 00:59:56,960
Wow.

1039
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:57,440
OK.

1040
00:59:57,440 --> 00:59:59,480
So it was the real plane.

1041
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:00,360
Although, was it?

1042
01:00:00,360 --> 01:00:03,280
That's actually, do we know if that was the real plane

1043
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:04,160
on the ride or not?

1044
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:04,760
Half of it.

1045
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:05,880
Bugsy says.

1046
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:06,960
Message straight from God.

1047
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:10,480
So God sent you back to give us that message

1048
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:11,520
and only that message.

1049
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:13,720
No, Bogie himself sent me back.

1050
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:15,200
Oh.

1051
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:16,480
Bogie himself.

1052
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:17,000
OK.

1053
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,760
A cinephile's dream you've experienced.

1054
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:20,480
Wow.

1055
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:25,400
And I fenced with Douglas Fairbanks Jr. as well.

1056
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:27,240
Whoa.

1057
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:28,600
I can't believe it.

1058
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:31,920
I don't mean to pimp you out for your entire heaven

1059
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:34,680
experience, but you didn't by chance swing on a vine

1060
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:36,000
with Johnny Weissmuller.

1061
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,600
Oh, did I?

1062
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:38,280
Wow.

1063
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:39,000
Wow.

1064
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,920
Because even two minutes up there was an eternity.

1065
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:43,640
Hey, while we're talking about Casablanca,

1066
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:45,680
that famous scene in Casablanca actually

1067
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:49,360
shot indoors on a soundstage right here in Burbank

1068
01:00:49,360 --> 01:00:50,960
at Warner Brothers Studios.

1069
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:51,680
Is that right?

1070
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:52,680
Yeah.

1071
01:00:52,680 --> 01:00:54,240
Another Robert Osborne style.

1072
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:55,200
Another Robert Osborne style.

1073
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:55,960
Another Robert Osborne.

1074
01:00:55,960 --> 01:00:57,640
Did you see Robert Osborne up there?

1075
01:00:57,640 --> 01:00:59,200
How's he doing up in heaven?

1076
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:03,560
Hey, Robert, he's not doing too good, actually.

1077
01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:05,040
What?

1078
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:06,240
You can't do bad in heaven?

1079
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:08,040
Oh, what a horrible revelation.

1080
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:08,560
What?

1081
01:01:08,560 --> 01:01:09,280
Very sick.

1082
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:09,800
Oh my god.

1083
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:10,440
He's very sick.

1084
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:10,920
He's sick.

1085
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:13,080
He's not walking around introducing things

1086
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:14,040
to his heart's delight?

1087
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:14,600
No.

1088
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:16,200
No, it's really sad to watch him.

1089
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:17,800
You know, he's getting all his facts wrong.

1090
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:18,520
He's very sick.

1091
01:01:18,520 --> 01:01:20,520
He's going to go to the next one.

1092
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:21,400
The next what?

1093
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:22,840
They're sending him down to hell?

1094
01:01:22,840 --> 01:01:23,880
Purgatory or hell?

1095
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:25,000
Next level of heaven?

1096
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:25,920
There's another one.

1097
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:27,120
Is he going to other heaven?

1098
01:01:27,120 --> 01:01:27,880
That's what you don't know.

1099
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:28,960
There's other ones.

1100
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:29,480
Oh.

1101
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:31,000
There's multiple heavens?

1102
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:32,640
Is he being punished?

1103
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:36,480
Or is God unhappy with his incorrect movie facts?

1104
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:37,320
So he's being cast away?

1105
01:01:37,320 --> 01:01:39,080
Well, he couldn't save the ride.

1106
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:40,400
He's got one strike against him.

1107
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:42,280
Oh, God was a big fan of the great movie ride.

1108
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:42,880
Of course he was.

1109
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:43,880
God loves the classics.

1110
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:44,400
Yeah.

1111
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:46,280
You know, God's a good man.

1112
01:01:46,280 --> 01:01:48,080
He would like such a great ride.

1113
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:49,320
God's no man.

1114
01:01:49,320 --> 01:01:50,560
God's a woman.

1115
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:51,640
We all know that.

1116
01:01:51,640 --> 01:01:52,120
Of course.

1117
01:01:52,120 --> 01:01:52,600
Of course.

1118
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:53,120
Of course.

1119
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:53,640
Of course.

1120
01:01:53,640 --> 01:01:54,280
Of course.

1121
01:01:54,280 --> 01:01:54,960
Of course.

1122
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:56,920
Hey, all right.

1123
01:01:56,920 --> 01:01:59,080
Well, you know, now we're heading towards the finale.

1124
01:01:59,080 --> 01:02:00,040
Slap God in the mouth.

1125
01:02:00,040 --> 01:02:00,520
Hey.

1126
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:01,000
Hey.

1127
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:01,480
Come on.

1128
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:01,960
Hey.

1129
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:02,280
OK.

1130
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:03,040
That's the worst.

1131
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:04,280
That's crazy.

1132
01:02:04,280 --> 01:02:05,800
How would you even be able to do that?

1133
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:06,920
You can't fight God.

1134
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:09,200
Dude, Bungie got sent back here because you're going down

1135
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:10,440
to meet the man downstairs.

1136
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:11,760
I think you're on the way back to hell.

1137
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:12,600
You're on the way back to hell.

1138
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:13,800
I'm going to go to the other level.

1139
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:14,800
There's another level?

1140
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:15,320
There's another level.

1141
01:02:15,320 --> 01:02:16,560
The levels go both ways.

1142
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:19,600
There's about three of them.

1143
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:22,640
So there's multiple areas just like Disney World.

1144
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:24,080
Heaven's kind of like Disney World,

1145
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:25,560
where there's multiple parks.

1146
01:02:25,560 --> 01:02:28,720
And you get around via a boat.

1147
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:29,800
Yes.

1148
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:31,760
You were sent down in a boat.

1149
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:35,120
What a very fun leap.

1150
01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:36,480
It's pretty nice to know that.

1151
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:37,000
Yeah.

1152
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,000
Just so you know.

1153
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:38,760
Yeah, OK.

1154
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:42,120
Well, now we're heading to the Wizard of Oz

1155
01:02:42,120 --> 01:02:45,200
with the witch, which is a really great animatronic

1156
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:47,120
character, one of the best, I think,

1157
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:48,800
in the history of the parks.

1158
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:51,440
A lot of points of mobility.

1159
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:52,040
Yeah.

1160
01:02:52,040 --> 01:02:55,520
And those creepy munchkin animatronics always

1161
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:57,840
kind of creeped me out as a kid in that too.

1162
01:02:57,840 --> 01:02:59,720
Because they talk to you and they sing along

1163
01:02:59,720 --> 01:03:00,560
and they ask where you're going.

1164
01:03:00,560 --> 01:03:02,480
They make eye contact with you in a strange way.

1165
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:03,160
Yeah.

1166
01:03:03,160 --> 01:03:06,760
Bugsie, are there short people in Heaven?

1167
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:08,320
Oh, what do you think Heaven is?

1168
01:03:08,320 --> 01:03:11,440
It's not going to exclude the little freaks in the world.

1169
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:12,120
They love you.

1170
01:03:12,120 --> 01:03:12,600
Bugsie.

1171
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:13,120
Bugsie.

1172
01:03:13,120 --> 01:03:13,600
Wait.

1173
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:14,120
No.

1174
01:03:14,120 --> 01:03:16,280
In his language, that's nice.

1175
01:03:16,280 --> 01:03:18,320
On his spectrum, that's an inclusive statement.

1176
01:03:18,320 --> 01:03:18,840
All right.

1177
01:03:18,840 --> 01:03:19,520
Let me tell you.

1178
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:21,960
Everyone gets a cloud.

1179
01:03:21,960 --> 01:03:24,520
Everyone gets their own cloud.

1180
01:03:24,520 --> 01:03:27,600
I had a pinstriped cloud.

1181
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:28,100
Wow.

1182
01:03:28,100 --> 01:03:28,600
Really?

1183
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:31,800
And the munchkins have little tiny clouds.

1184
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:33,120
They don't need to be as big.

1185
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:35,680
That's how it works.

1186
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:37,440
As a shorter man, I'm happy to hear

1187
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:39,520
this, that I'll have an appropriate size cloud.

1188
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:40,560
You'll get a little cloud.

1189
01:03:40,560 --> 01:03:42,840
You won't feel bad for hogging cloud space.

1190
01:03:42,840 --> 01:03:43,400
Yeah.

1191
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:48,040
But I bet Manute Bowl or which one of the tall basketball

1192
01:03:48,040 --> 01:03:50,480
players has passed away, George Mirachan.

1193
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:52,400
Oh, they have the biggest clouds.

1194
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:55,120
They must be eye-bogglingly big.

1195
01:03:55,120 --> 01:03:58,400
Is that where the Lakitu from Mario Kart?

1196
01:03:58,400 --> 01:03:59,840
Is that where the idea came from,

1197
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:02,160
the character in the Mario games where it had a cloud?

1198
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:02,660
Oh, yeah.

1199
01:04:02,660 --> 01:04:05,160
Did you see any little creatures tossing shells out

1200
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:05,760
from a cloud?

1201
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:06,260
No.

1202
01:04:06,260 --> 01:04:07,760
But that is where they got the idea.

1203
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:08,260
Oh, OK.

1204
01:04:08,260 --> 01:04:08,760
Cool.

1205
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:09,760
That makes a lot of sense.

1206
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:13,000
So whoever designed Lakitu must have died and gone to heaven,

1207
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:14,480
come back with that notion.

1208
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:14,980
Yeah.

1209
01:04:14,980 --> 01:04:16,880
And now that all the munchkins are dead,

1210
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:19,840
they all have their little tiny munchkin clouds up there.

1211
01:04:19,840 --> 01:04:20,760
They're all dead now.

1212
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:21,920
They're all there.

1213
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:23,240
They're still singing.

1214
01:04:23,240 --> 01:04:24,440
They're singing their songs.

1215
01:04:24,440 --> 01:04:25,200
Oh, that's nice.

1216
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:25,700
Yeah.

1217
01:04:25,700 --> 01:04:26,200
That is nice.

1218
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:28,440
Well, yeah.

1219
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:30,440
You're giving us some hope for the future.

1220
01:04:30,440 --> 01:04:32,520
I hope we all, as one day, will all.

1221
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:35,920
In heaven, they sing, follow the yellow brick cloud.

1222
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:36,420
Oh.

1223
01:04:36,420 --> 01:04:37,840
See how they changed that?

1224
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:38,320
Yeah.

1225
01:04:38,320 --> 01:04:39,200
That's very charming.

1226
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:40,760
Because clouds are the street in heaven.

1227
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:41,320
Yeah, yeah.

1228
01:04:41,320 --> 01:04:41,880
Yeah.

1229
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:44,120
I'm still concerned that you can be sick in heaven,

1230
01:04:44,120 --> 01:04:44,840
and that's bothering me.

1231
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:45,120
Yeah.

1232
01:04:45,120 --> 01:04:47,040
I'm concerned about Robert Osborn.

1233
01:04:47,040 --> 01:04:48,040
Yeah.

1234
01:04:48,040 --> 01:04:49,000
Judy Garland, too.

1235
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:49,800
She's a little sick.

1236
01:04:49,800 --> 01:04:50,300
Sick?

1237
01:04:50,300 --> 01:04:52,520
Didn't she live a hard enough life on Earth?

1238
01:04:52,520 --> 01:04:53,020
Yeah.

1239
01:04:53,020 --> 01:04:55,800
She's been sucking too much munchkin come up there.

1240
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:57,280
I mean, whoops.

1241
01:04:57,280 --> 01:04:58,560
Oh, Bugsy.

1242
01:04:58,560 --> 01:05:00,240
Oh, Jesus Christ.

1243
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:01,960
That's now you've fucked it too far.

1244
01:05:01,960 --> 01:05:03,120
Hey, you know all the bugs.

1245
01:05:03,120 --> 01:05:04,600
Bugsy man.

1246
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:05,600
Bugsy man.

1247
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:07,520
This is way too far.

1248
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:08,880
No, no, no, no.

1249
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:09,560
I'm kidding.

1250
01:05:09,560 --> 01:05:10,120
I'm kidding.

1251
01:05:10,120 --> 01:05:10,720
I'm kidding.

1252
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:12,240
That's just his nature.

1253
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:13,240
What do you spell?

1254
01:05:13,240 --> 01:05:15,200
We've been right telling out of Wizard of Oz town

1255
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:16,320
before we hear more of this.

1256
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:19,280
Maybe you guys catch the rumor that it seemed unclear

1257
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:22,320
some sources very confidently said Liza Minnelli is

1258
01:05:22,320 --> 01:05:25,480
the voice of Judy Garland in the Wizard of Oz sequence,

1259
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:27,240
but that did not seem confirmed.

1260
01:05:27,240 --> 01:05:27,960
I don't know if that's true.

1261
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:29,920
I have never seen that, so that's interesting.

1262
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:31,400
I don't know if that's true or not.

1263
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:35,680
I feel like that's a fact all us little freak kids would

1264
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:39,320
have known for sure as children, as children interested

1265
01:05:39,320 --> 01:05:41,400
in Judy Garland and Liza Minnelli.

1266
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:44,080
I feel like if that were true, we would have known that.

1267
01:05:44,080 --> 01:05:45,320
So I'm going to say no.

1268
01:05:45,320 --> 01:05:47,800
I think that's a false rumor.

1269
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:52,560
So if Judy, if Liza Minnelli was dead, I could have told you.

1270
01:05:52,560 --> 01:05:53,560
That's true.

1271
01:05:53,560 --> 01:05:54,560
She's not that sure.

1272
01:05:54,560 --> 01:05:55,560
That's why I don't.

1273
01:05:55,560 --> 01:05:56,560
You didn't see her.

1274
01:05:56,560 --> 01:05:58,720
She hasn't climbed upon the boat to heaven yet.

1275
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:01,560
The rules of Bugsy are now that I only

1276
01:06:01,560 --> 01:06:04,000
know about things from heaven.

1277
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,080
So that's the new thing that happens with Bugsy.

1278
01:06:06,080 --> 01:06:08,720
Well, at least you're not haunted by your less than a week

1279
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:10,000
in Sing Sing anymore.

1280
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:11,160
No, no, no.

1281
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:12,280
That's so far in the past.

1282
01:06:12,280 --> 01:06:14,960
Now I'm a messenger from beyond the gold.

1283
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:18,600
But not of anything profound of just sort of odd trivia

1284
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:20,080
from heaven about how celebrities do it.

1285
01:06:20,080 --> 01:06:22,400
The sort of mundane life of heaven.

1286
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:24,600
Yeah, you're not spreading the word of the gospel

1287
01:06:24,600 --> 01:06:26,160
or the word of Christ.

1288
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:29,040
If he threatened to smack God, so I

1289
01:06:29,040 --> 01:06:30,040
don't think he's a religious man.

1290
01:06:30,040 --> 01:06:31,080
Yeah, I guess not.

1291
01:06:31,080 --> 01:06:32,280
Although you believe in God.

1292
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:36,520
Same for AMC's preacher, right guys?

1293
01:06:36,520 --> 01:06:37,520
AMC's preacher.

1294
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:39,560
Now that you're back on earth, you can get caught up

1295
01:06:39,560 --> 01:06:40,480
on AMC's preacher.

1296
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:41,440
Start binge watching.

1297
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:44,000
Oh, I can't wait to binge watch the Ozarks.

1298
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:47,920
That's what I was waiting for when I was in heaven.

1299
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:49,480
Better than heaven, they say.

1300
01:06:49,480 --> 01:06:51,040
That's what all the critics have been saying.

1301
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:52,920
So I'm glad you get to do it.

1302
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:54,560
So you make it now.

1303
01:06:54,560 --> 01:06:58,680
The great movie ride finishes and we get to the movie

1304
01:06:58,680 --> 01:07:00,880
at the end of the ride where you get to experience all,

1305
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:04,440
you get to binge watch really all of cinematic history

1306
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:07,600
in one sitting, several glorious minutes

1307
01:07:08,520 --> 01:07:11,240
in which you see, you know, what's in that?

1308
01:07:11,240 --> 01:07:13,560
Those, what I remember is that that movie at the end,

1309
01:07:13,560 --> 01:07:15,920
the montage of all the great films that it was high.

1310
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:19,880
It was very oddly heavy in like 80s Bette Midler movies.

1311
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:22,080
Yeah, Bette Midler shows up a few times.

1312
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:24,640
Which they were really pushing Bette Midler in the 80s

1313
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:26,360
at Disney World in general.

1314
01:07:26,360 --> 01:07:28,120
Like there was a heavy Bette Midler presence

1315
01:07:28,120 --> 01:07:30,440
and she was like at the opening and everything.

1316
01:07:30,440 --> 01:07:32,920
I just, have you ever seen any of those like big business,

1317
01:07:32,920 --> 01:07:35,320
the like touchstone movies of the 80s?

1318
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:41,160
I, for some reason, Good Morning Vietnam

1319
01:07:41,160 --> 01:07:43,880
is highly featured in this montage.

1320
01:07:43,880 --> 01:07:44,720
That's a great point.

1321
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:45,960
Good Morning Vietnam.

1322
01:07:45,960 --> 01:07:47,600
Good Morning Vietnam.

1323
01:07:47,600 --> 01:07:49,120
They like give a lot of real estate.

1324
01:07:49,120 --> 01:07:50,200
I have never seen that movie,

1325
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:53,640
but that scene is like burned into my brain

1326
01:07:53,640 --> 01:07:55,440
from riding that ride so much as a kid.

1327
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:59,160
Also the cut from like Al Jolson going,

1328
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:02,200
"'You ain't heard nothing yet' to a shot from Showboat."

1329
01:08:02,200 --> 01:08:03,520
And like the music.

1330
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:06,800
I'm really glad that Disney and Michael Eisner

1331
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:09,400
would put in Al Jolson.

1332
01:08:09,400 --> 01:08:11,400
Al Jolson and Showboat.

1333
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:13,320
You can't ignore it.

1334
01:08:13,320 --> 01:08:15,160
But then in a more recent edit.

1335
01:08:15,160 --> 01:08:16,000
It's part of our history.

1336
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:19,000
Yeah, we have to acknowledge it and move on.

1337
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,680
In a more recent edit, they took out Showboat,

1338
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:25,520
but put in, is it Laurence Olivier from Marathon Man

1339
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:27,000
going, is it safe?

1340
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:28,560
Laurence Olivier.

1341
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:29,400
Oh of course.

1342
01:08:29,400 --> 01:08:31,960
The old Nazi going like, is it safe?

1343
01:08:31,960 --> 01:08:33,440
Yeah, the old death camp.

1344
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:35,280
Yeah, the old torture.

1345
01:08:35,280 --> 01:08:38,440
The person who's about to pull his teeth out

1346
01:08:38,440 --> 01:08:40,560
and looking for the diamonds that he stole from the Jews

1347
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:41,520
during the Holocaust.

1348
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:42,360
Yeah.

1349
01:08:42,360 --> 01:08:43,160
Really?

1350
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:45,760
Yeah, your film buffery is, I'm glad you came back.

1351
01:08:45,760 --> 01:08:47,680
It's a part of that movie.

1352
01:08:47,680 --> 01:08:50,040
Although a big shot of Woody Allen in that movie.

1353
01:08:50,040 --> 01:08:53,040
I forget from Take the Money and Run, maybe.

1354
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:53,880
I don't know.

1355
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:56,040
Because they have to represent like comedy in general.

1356
01:08:56,040 --> 01:08:58,760
So you see Buster Keaton and Woody Allen

1357
01:08:58,760 --> 01:09:03,760
and like Robin Williams or like Pat.

1358
01:09:04,040 --> 01:09:05,320
They were like, they made it when they were

1359
01:09:05,320 --> 01:09:10,320
plugging its Pat, so just all the Disney movies.

1360
01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:14,120
I was trying to watch it today and see what

1361
01:09:14,120 --> 01:09:17,080
sexual maniacs were in it besides like Woody Allen.

1362
01:09:17,080 --> 01:09:19,840
Like I was trying to see, there's a shot of Johnny Depp,

1363
01:09:19,840 --> 01:09:21,680
there's a shot of, I was trying to see like

1364
01:09:21,680 --> 01:09:23,600
if they had removed anyone.

1365
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:26,280
There wasn't like, there's no like Jefferson Davis film

1366
01:09:26,280 --> 01:09:27,120
that they included.

1367
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:28,480
There's a decent chance they had to get rid

1368
01:09:28,480 --> 01:09:30,640
of the great movie ride, cause there's a problematic element

1369
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:32,160
in every movie.

1370
01:09:32,160 --> 01:09:33,000
Well yeah.

1371
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:33,840
In the great movie ride.

1372
01:09:33,840 --> 01:09:36,520
So it's just easier to replace it with Mickey Mouse.

1373
01:09:36,520 --> 01:09:40,360
Footlight Parade, as we've experienced today,

1374
01:09:40,360 --> 01:09:42,800
Bugsy, the 40's gangster who's visited us

1375
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:46,000
has shown us his very problematic views from the past.

1376
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,640
So this might all indicate why they needed to

1377
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:49,480
take the ride out.

1378
01:09:49,480 --> 01:09:51,080
Maybe it was archaic, maybe there were offensive

1379
01:09:51,080 --> 01:09:52,400
viewpoints within it.

1380
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:57,400
And also maybe licensing a couple dozen movie properties

1381
01:09:57,800 --> 01:10:00,960
from other studios started to add up over the 30 years.

1382
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:01,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1383
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:03,360
They did lose the MGM license.

1384
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:07,000
You know, we do a thing where when we've reviewed rides

1385
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:10,560
in the past, we've used our system of keep it,

1386
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:14,120
what were the choices?

1387
01:10:14,120 --> 01:10:19,120
Keep it, toss it up, mysterious fire for the insurance money.

1388
01:10:19,160 --> 01:10:20,840
Burn it down for insurance money.

1389
01:10:20,840 --> 01:10:22,720
Now the choice has been made for us,

1390
01:10:22,720 --> 01:10:25,600
the ride basically was burn down.

1391
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:26,680
Burn down for a 20.

1392
01:10:26,680 --> 01:10:29,880
But if there was a way to salvage the great movie ride,

1393
01:10:29,880 --> 01:10:33,040
do you guys have, and Bugsy I include you in this,

1394
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:36,400
is there a, yes you're welcome.

1395
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:37,720
Was there a way, is there a way

1396
01:10:37,720 --> 01:10:40,000
they could have salvaged this ride?

1397
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,880
More Bugsy, that's what I think.

1398
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:45,240
So your suggestion is maybe turn a lot of the other scenes

1399
01:10:45,240 --> 01:10:49,840
into a 40s gangster scenes, or at least put the animatronic

1400
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:52,280
James Cagney maybe in like the Wizard of Oz scene as well

1401
01:10:52,280 --> 01:10:53,120
and make that a through line.

1402
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:55,920
Like you pop up in one of the munchkin windows,

1403
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:58,720
maybe you go bother Glinda the Good Witch.

1404
01:10:58,720 --> 01:11:01,760
Yeah, Bugsy Bones, which is my new name.

1405
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:03,800
Oh, because I'm a skeleton.

1406
01:11:03,800 --> 01:11:04,640
Oh, right.

1407
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:07,000
Bugsy Bones' great movie adventure.

1408
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:10,640
Now that's something I would pay to see.

1409
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:14,000
A cursed skeleton from the 40s who's been to heaven.

1410
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:14,840
That's right.

1411
01:11:14,840 --> 01:11:16,840
And it's on his way to hell.

1412
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:18,720
Where the great movie ride is now in hell

1413
01:11:18,720 --> 01:11:20,360
and Bugsy's on his way to hell.

1414
01:11:20,360 --> 01:11:23,200
Me and Al Jolson and John Wilkes Booth

1415
01:11:23,200 --> 01:11:25,440
take you around the great,

1416
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:29,560
great adventure of acting and film history.

1417
01:11:29,560 --> 01:11:32,480
Yeah, I like the sound of that.

1418
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:36,080
With brief touches of offensive opinions,

1419
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:38,320
but not so much, it certainly is not any sort of

1420
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:39,680
demented history lesson.

1421
01:11:39,680 --> 01:11:40,520
Right, right.

1422
01:11:40,520 --> 01:11:41,360
It's just what you think.

1423
01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:44,200
A manageable amount of offensive opinions, I think.

1424
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:48,720
Also, all the old great studio heads,

1425
01:11:48,720 --> 01:11:52,280
the Warner Brothers and Thalberg and Mayer,

1426
01:11:52,280 --> 01:11:54,480
and they're probably definitely in hell.

1427
01:11:54,480 --> 01:11:56,280
They did horrible things.

1428
01:11:56,280 --> 01:11:59,600
They probably laundered money through you.

1429
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:02,520
That's probably one of the many things you went to.

1430
01:12:02,520 --> 01:12:05,360
Yeah, I've taken care of Irving Thalberg.

1431
01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:10,360
I've gotten a kickback from the Warner Brothers.

1432
01:12:10,360 --> 01:12:11,200
Yeah.

1433
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:16,200
The budget overage of D.W. Griffith's intolerance

1434
01:12:16,200 --> 01:12:18,800
was slid to you, Bugsy.

1435
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:20,240
Please, intolerance.

1436
01:12:20,240 --> 01:12:21,080
Yes, yeah, yeah.

1437
01:12:21,080 --> 01:12:24,040
That man couldn't tolerate a thing.

1438
01:12:24,040 --> 01:12:26,920
Not a thing, huh?

1439
01:12:26,920 --> 01:12:27,760
Not a thing.

1440
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:31,800
You know, you are, you know,

1441
01:12:31,800 --> 01:12:34,560
you've proven yourself such a cinephile,

1442
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:36,840
you've proven yourself such an important part

1443
01:12:36,840 --> 01:12:38,320
of the great movie ride experience,

1444
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:42,080
it's too bad that you can't now leave your hand prints

1445
01:12:42,080 --> 01:12:43,960
or your bone prints, as it were,

1446
01:12:43,960 --> 01:12:46,320
in the cement outside the Chinese theater.

1447
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:49,440
I know, it would stick in my bony,

1448
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:52,920
bone fingers would fall off and stick to the cement.

1449
01:12:52,920 --> 01:12:55,000
Or here's an idea,

1450
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,360
it might prevent your finger flexibility in the future,

1451
01:12:57,360 --> 01:13:00,120
but maybe cement is a good way to cover up those fingers

1452
01:13:00,120 --> 01:13:01,400
and give you a full hand again.

1453
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:02,760
And you have like cement hands

1454
01:13:02,760 --> 01:13:05,520
and you could punch, or no.

1455
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:07,240
No, no, we don't want him to punch.

1456
01:13:07,240 --> 01:13:09,280
I'm so sorry, I haven't suggested that.

1457
01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:11,520
No, no, no, no, no, no, don't do it, don't do that.

1458
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:15,000
The only cement I'm familiar with are cement shoes.

1459
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,840
Oh, no, no, no.

1460
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:21,600
You guys keep choking around with your little ride opinions,

1461
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:27,200
I might have to fit you all for a pair of cement shoes yourself.

1462
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:28,960
Wait a minute, so I thought we were friends now,

1463
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:33,640
we bonded over movies and you're still mad at us,

1464
01:13:33,640 --> 01:13:34,600
you're still threatening us?

1465
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:38,320
I'm going to toss you in the river and drown you faster than

1466
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:44,040
than the Robert Wagner drowned Natalie Wood.

1467
01:13:44,040 --> 01:13:45,480
She told me in heaven, by the way.

1468
01:13:45,480 --> 01:13:46,280
Once again.

1469
01:13:46,280 --> 01:13:48,000
That it was him, that it was him.

1470
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:49,920
Again, it's part of our history.

1471
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:51,760
You have to acknowledge it.

1472
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:53,160
She really does mean it.

1473
01:13:53,160 --> 01:13:54,320
Probably what happened.

1474
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:55,320
Jesus.

1475
01:13:55,320 --> 01:13:55,840
Allegedly.

1476
01:13:55,840 --> 01:13:58,640
It was a weird story we never found out about.

1477
01:13:58,640 --> 01:14:01,480
It was Catalina Island is haunted by that forever.

1478
01:14:01,480 --> 01:14:03,960
I know the real Casablanca Plane is in the great movie, right?

1479
01:14:03,960 --> 01:14:06,960
The real Robert Wagner boat isn't in there somewhere, too.

1480
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:10,200
No, that was on the backlot tour after they closed it down.

1481
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:12,400
Oh, that was like teetering above catastrophe.

1482
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:15,800
Yeah, and it got left out in the rain with the spectra magic

1483
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:17,560
floats and the rocket rods.

1484
01:14:17,560 --> 01:14:18,440
So it got destroyed.

1485
01:14:18,440 --> 01:14:20,440
It just rusted away too bad.

1486
01:14:20,440 --> 01:14:24,440
Well, that's why we have to preserve our history and not let it rust away.

1487
01:14:25,240 --> 01:14:29,080
All that remains is the horrible memories left in Christopher Walken's brain.

1488
01:14:30,720 --> 01:14:33,200
Another another theme park ride idea.

1489
01:14:33,200 --> 01:14:35,680
A journey into Christopher Walken's brain.

1490
01:14:35,680 --> 01:14:38,160
Well, I mean, that pretty much takes us through the

1491
01:14:38,720 --> 01:14:41,400
history of the great movie ride and how wonderful to get to

1492
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:44,520
encounter one of the characters from the ride.

1493
01:14:44,720 --> 01:14:46,640
Bugsy, thank you so much for being here.

1494
01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:48,000
A pleasure. Absolutely.

1495
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:49,760
Is there anything is there anything you'd like to plug?

1496
01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:51,560
Yeah, got a new book.

1497
01:14:51,560 --> 01:14:54,400
Bugsy got a bone to pick coming out about two weeks.

1498
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:57,440
So, well, yeah, doing some other things.

1499
01:14:57,440 --> 01:14:58,960
Very clever. Did you think of that?

1500
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:01,240
Or did you have like a ghostwriter thought of some of the jokes for you?

1501
01:15:01,240 --> 01:15:02,800
I know. No, no.

1502
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:07,160
Well, I have to say, when I was in heaven, I did meet one ghostwriter,

1503
01:15:07,280 --> 01:15:08,880
Tennessee Williams.

1504
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:11,640
Oh, how's he doing?

1505
01:15:11,640 --> 01:15:14,120
He was a see, because he's dead.

1506
01:15:14,120 --> 01:15:15,160
Well, yeah.

1507
01:15:15,160 --> 01:15:18,880
Why did you go to him over Trumbo?

1508
01:15:19,880 --> 01:15:21,720
Trumbo saw who he saw, Mike.

1509
01:15:21,720 --> 01:15:27,560
So sorry. I just want to know about the because he was dead.

1510
01:15:27,720 --> 01:15:30,640
He I consider him a ghostwriter is what I'm saying.

1511
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:32,000
Oh, I see. Yeah, yeah.

1512
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:33,880
I get it. I get it. I'm sorry. Yeah.

1513
01:15:33,880 --> 01:15:37,280
Is he like, did you get to experience he written like dozens of new plays

1514
01:15:37,280 --> 01:15:39,840
up in heaven that only you got to read?

1515
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:43,480
Yeah. Cat on a hot tin cloud. Wow.

1516
01:15:43,480 --> 01:15:46,160
Oh, that's a heaven exclusive.

1517
01:15:46,160 --> 01:15:48,160
You're not going to hear it here on Earth, folks.

1518
01:15:48,160 --> 01:15:51,960
It's like he's kind of resting on his laurels there and going over old material,

1519
01:15:51,960 --> 01:15:54,400
to be honest. Wouldn't you?

1520
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:55,800
Let me ask you this. Yeah, I guess I would.

1521
01:15:55,800 --> 01:15:58,760
Is he sick as well? No. Oh, good.

1522
01:15:58,760 --> 01:15:59,800
Oh, thank God.

1523
01:15:59,800 --> 01:16:01,400
Some people are something we've learned.

1524
01:16:01,400 --> 01:16:03,320
Some people are well in heaven.

1525
01:16:03,320 --> 01:16:05,640
Some people are struggling.

1526
01:16:05,640 --> 01:16:07,760
So they the struggle never ends.

1527
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:09,480
Ain't that right, Bugsy?

1528
01:16:09,480 --> 01:16:12,240
That's right. The struggle is real.

1529
01:16:12,240 --> 01:16:14,640
Hashtag Bugsy.

1530
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:15,840
Hashtag Bugsy.

1531
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:19,360
So hashtag bugs, if you want to see Bugsy back on the show

1532
01:16:19,360 --> 01:16:22,080
for potentially an un unrelated ride.

1533
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:24,880
I know you only appear in one ride, but if you ever.

1534
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:27,680
Well, what could Bugsy talk about?

1535
01:16:27,680 --> 01:16:30,720
If you want to come back and talk about horizons or they never built

1536
01:16:30,720 --> 01:16:33,040
Dick Tracy's Crime Stoppers. Oh, that's great.

1537
01:16:33,040 --> 01:16:35,680
Yes. Yeah, that's another guy.

1538
01:16:35,680 --> 01:16:37,200
Dick Tracy. Oh, yeah.

1539
01:16:37,200 --> 01:16:39,240
Wait, let's not parallel. OK.

1540
01:16:39,240 --> 01:16:45,800
When I think of Dick Tracy, my trigger finger gets a little tight.

1541
01:16:45,800 --> 01:16:49,680
OK. None of us are Dick Tracy's not here.

1542
01:16:49,680 --> 01:16:51,480
Yeah, yeah. We hate him. Take care, everyone.
