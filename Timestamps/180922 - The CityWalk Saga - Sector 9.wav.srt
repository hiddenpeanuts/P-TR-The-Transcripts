1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Forever...

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Dog.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
When your town has let you down

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
When your port has fallen short

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
When you're too worn out to run

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
And need some ribs or a Cinnabon

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
You need a place, a place for rock

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
A place for roll

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
A place where Oakland Raiders merch is sold

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
A sublime hot topic and bill of bond

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
A place where you can purchase a candy thong

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
So let's go take a walk

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Let's all go to City Walk

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Tonight, tonight

15
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I forgot what we were doing. We say, well, hello, welcome to Podcast The Ride

16
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
and then say the City Walk Saga and then were we saying...

17
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Yeah, we were saying just the sector number.

18
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
But we don't say what it is because we're going to get that from the sector keeper when he announces.

19
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Okay, that's how we do it.

20
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Hi, my name is Mike Carlson. You're listening to this amazing series.

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
We have gone a little mad from City Walk Madness, which I guess is a disease you could possibly contract.

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I don't think I fully have it. Jason Sheridan, do you have it?

23
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
City Walk Madness?

24
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
You know, been up there a lot recently. Some trips are better than others, you know?

25
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Yes, I know what you're saying.

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Just like one day at a time, one trip at a time.

27
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Also, joining us, Scott Gairdner, how's your madness level as far as City Walk?

28
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Well, I think on a scale of one to ten, I think it goes up with every episode.

29
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:13,000
So we're at nine right now. And on a scale of one to ten, it'll be at 19 by episode 19.

30
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I felt ebbs and flows like going up there. Some days I'm just like having a ball.

31
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
And then some days it's like kind of a real chore because maybe I have something to do in an hour and a half.

32
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And I feel very rushed. And then you can really feel maybe what people say when they say they don't like City Walk, which by the way, I'm not saying I still love City Walk.

33
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:38,000
One of the things that happened that factors into this episode made me say out loud, maybe I don't like City Walk.

34
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
What?

35
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Yeah.

36
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
This is only a sector nine. We're only in the ninth.

37
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Yeah. But we just had it. It was just a big meal fail. It was just undeniably.

38
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,000
And I'm not even sure it was City Walk's fault entirely, but I don't know. I'll get into it.

39
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:05,000
There's a whole... I would say I was taking somebody from out of town around and I don't think I or the walk put either of our best feet forward.

40
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
OK.

41
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I get that.

42
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Let's throw it to the keeper.

43
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Oh, yes. To see what of the fine establishments are in sector nine.

44
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Let's go to the board.

45
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Boys, boys, today's sector is sector nine. Dong Po Kitchen, Skechers, Locker Room by Lids, and Voodoo Donuts. Good luck, boys.

46
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:38,000
OK, so we're dealing with Dong Po Kitchen, Skechers, Locker Room by Lids, which is not just the Lids store.

47
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Not just Lids. Has led to some confusion in our text message chain, I think.

48
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Yes.

49
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Or confusion on my part and worrying that everyone else was confused.

50
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,000
And I feel like it's probably actually never been confusing to anyone that went to City Walk because no one cares about those places.

51
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
That is true.

52
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
No one goes to get a hat at City Walk.

53
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
If we didn't say any more about this, we would have already spoken about it more than anyone else.

54
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
People who work there.

55
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
And Voodoo Donuts. Last but certainly not least, what I may call the jewel of this sector.

56
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Interesting.

57
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Yeah, this sector.

58
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
We should do one where we could just also make these up.

59
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
People don't have... we could be like, oh, the shoe factory is in sector nine.

60
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
And people would be like, oh, oh, I remember that. Yeah, that's that shoe store called the shoe factory.

61
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Nerf Zone.

62
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Nerf Zone.

63
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Yeah, OK. So this obviously is the all Nerf store.

64
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Yeah.

65
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
And it's the basic Nerf bats and guns.

66
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Right.

67
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
But you know, you could buy a wedding cake made of Nerf.

68
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
And then I would be like, you know, the Nerf stores theming isn't so great.

69
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I think that they should really like do something a little bit more fun and theme park style.

70
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Like, how about like a giant Nerf gun or something that's like sitting outside or like at least a giant yellow Nerf ball that like kids could like roll around in the store.

71
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
And then people would be listening to this.

72
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I'm exasperated by all of it.

73
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Yes.

74
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Jason would be like, I like it.

75
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
And did you know that they have like Nerf ball treats?

76
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
That would be basically how it works.

77
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
And they make cops that look like the yellow Nerf balls.

78
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Oh, my God. That would be great.

79
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
That would be fun.

80
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
By the way, this is a great idea. Is there a Nerf store anywhere?

81
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I don't think so.

82
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I don't think there is.

83
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:19,000
And how did that not happen in the 90s when Nerf is operating at peak Nerfdom?

84
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
CityWalk is peak 90s.

85
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
There should be like a super soaker store in the 90s, too.

86
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
There should be just full super soakers, different kinds, small, large.

87
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
You would have seen Michael Jackson and Macaulay Culkin hanging out there every day of the week.

88
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Super soaker store Macaulay.

89
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,000
And crowds of adults just going, oh, I don't know.

90
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
No, people, everything was fine in the 90s.

91
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
They were like, we love these two entertainers.

92
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
That's what they were thinking.

93
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
We were unconcerned by any of this.

94
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Yes, it was the 90s.

95
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I did see a picture from it could have been the 90s.

96
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Maybe it was the early 2000s of the Skechers store was there, but like very close to it was also a Vans store.

97
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Do you remember this, Scott?

98
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Oh, into the same district?

99
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Yeah.

100
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Which is crazy to me because that feels like a similar, similar, but not exactly the same, I guess.

101
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Very similar, yes.

102
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,000
But Vans, I think, would be competing more with Elements or Billabong sort of thing.

103
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I see what you're saying, but I mean, they're both primarily known for shoes.

104
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
For shoes.

105
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Let's bag that out real quick.

106
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
So Skechers.

107
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I learned that Skechers is the, OK, what is this qualifier?

108
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:41,000
The third largest athletic footwear brand in the United States after Nike, which includes Air Jordan and Adidas.

109
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
That is kind of crazy to me.

110
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I didn't realize Skechers was that popular.

111
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Really?

112
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I mean, I kind of do.

113
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Do you have the full list of shoe company popularity?

114
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
No, I don't.

115
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
What kind of theme park journalist are you?

116
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
If you don't know the top 10 shoe companies, Jason, get the fuck out of here.

117
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I mean, here's the, I went to the Skechers Wikipedia page.

118
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I followed one of the links.

119
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:19,000
It had an article, which followed to an article about the top athletic footwear brands in America.

120
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Doing the click through, I feel like is already further than most podcasters and certainly me a lot of times go.

121
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Oh, sure.

122
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
So I'm impressed by that.

123
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
So let me not, let me actually give you journalistic credence.

124
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I mean, I do have half of a journalism degree that I then converted to a television degree.

125
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Hold on a second here, Jason.

126
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I'm on a story that's from it's from success story.com and I looked up 10 most popular shoe brands and I think this is something very different.

127
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
But does it say athletic?

128
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Hmm. Does it say no?

129
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
You know what? You're right.

130
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:58,000
It just says popular because we're looking at number six here is a Berluti, which is like a fancy dress shoe is number six on this list.

131
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Yeah, I don't know.

132
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Seven Johnson, of course, Johnston and Murphy shoes is number eight.

133
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Where's Bruno Mali? The is not the name of the OJ's shoes where he said during the trial.

134
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I wouldn't I wouldn't wear no ugly shoes like that.

135
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Hmm. Or am I quoting something from a sketch?

136
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I don't even know.

137
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I don't know either.

138
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:29,000
OJ actually one of his first spots when when he was found not guilty was at the Nerf store.

139
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Got to celebrate. I love Nerf. Naive. Funny. Right. Yeah. It's funny because I am not guilty.

140
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Anyway, sorry to derail.

141
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
So, Sketchers, I walked through the Sketchers store.

142
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:49,000
The other I thought maybe like, oh, I know they had those ones that like the shape up Sketchers shape ups.

143
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
And I thought that was their thing.

144
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
And I thought like, oh, they're they're less expensive.

145
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I didn't find them any less because everything was between like 50 and 70 dollars.

146
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I feel expensive. Yeah.

147
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
And also the other thing about Sketchers, that logo is on everything.

148
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,000
And it's real big and it's not practically aesthetically pleasing to me, at least.

149
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Yeah. And lack of the T is pretty irritating.

150
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I hate the lack of a T. I was just thinking that that bothers me so much.

151
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
It should be called Sketchers, Sketchers or something.

152
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
It's weird. I don't know. I didn't even. I'm sure there's a reason for it.

153
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I was just on autopilot and I wrote Sketchers in the notes a couple of times.

154
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Did you use the T? I did use the T. I wasn't even thinking about that.

155
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Wow. Gives you something else to dislike.

156
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:45,000
The other thing, in 2012, they settled a multimillion dollar lawsuit that they had misled consumers with those shape up ads.

157
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Oh, interesting. 40 million dollars, it says here. Yeah. Whoa.

158
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Wow. But they survived, you know. They survived.

159
00:09:52,000 --> 00:10:02,000
They survived. And they of course have their beloved gang of Burger King Kids Club-esque characters, the Sketchers kids.

160
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:08,000
You, I'm sure, when you went through the store, made a real note of the gang who, you know,

161
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I'm looking at a photo and there's like, there's the boy side.

162
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:19,000
There's like kind of a rockabilly guy with sideburns and a robot with a light up yellow face and then like a reboot,

163
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:27,000
like the 90s CGI character reboot and kind of a Deadpool ripoff ninja man and a Green Goblin ripoff man.

164
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:35,000
And then somebody, my wife, described as a courier who's just like running in a hat with an S on it.

165
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
And that's the boy side. And then there's a bunch of girls too.

166
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,000
There's kind of a Hannah Montana, Pink Hair, pop star and a masked girl.

167
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,000
It's all really strange because they aren't labeled and none of the shoes tell you who the characters are.

168
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
And you can't find it online either.

169
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
No reference to there's no Sketcher Kidopedia.

170
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
That sucks.

171
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,000
It's also weird because there's a photo of all these characters and you can't see any of their shoes.

172
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
They exist only to sell shoes and I don't know what shoes they are wearing.

173
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:08,000
There's one especially with just like about 1% of a flap of a shoe. Like why cut it off there?

174
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Yeah, it's weird because you would think they would want to make the shoes very visible.

175
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:17,000
So, you know, a kid would go in and go like, I want to be like the Deadpool Sketcher kid and I want to wear whatever shoes he's got on.

176
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:23,000
No, they really. Yeah, they they've like fucked up by not just giving these kids names.

177
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
That's all you need to do because we would for free list them all.

178
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Yes, they had right now.

179
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I just listed vaguely what the characters look like.

180
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
We'd give them an ad for free on the show because we'd be so excited.

181
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Yes, they have.

182
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,000
That would extend this part of the segment like 10 minutes if there were names for all these kids.

183
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Yeah, they don't have to have any personality. They don't have to have any backstory.

184
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
We would fill it in, but they fucked up because we're about to end.

185
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I'm assuming unless we have a ton more sketchers stuff like I don't really.

186
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Well, I just think again, I'll say it's very odd to see that logo stamped on like because they also sell like casual shit like leather shoes,

187
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,000
kind of stuff you might wear with a more casual suit or business casual.

188
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,000
But then that fucking sketchers logo is stamped in the leather on the side.

189
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,000
It's so jarring to me. You're reminded of the poor spelling at all times.

190
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Yeah. I have one final thing about the Sketchers store, which is there.

191
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
There is a gumball machine.

192
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:28,000
And if you work at the Sketchers store and you're listening on the back, closest to the back of the store on the left side,

193
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,000
there is some chewed up gum deposit on the back of the gumball machine.

194
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:40,000
So just maybe take care of that if you're a GM listening to this, you know, to get an employee on it.

195
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
But just do be aware there is some built up gum.

196
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
That's gross. Well, yeah, please. They're listening and they will probably rectify that quickly.

197
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I don't want to get anyone fired over this. Just trying to be helpful.

198
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
So locker room by Lids. So Lids is hats.

199
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Yeah. And locker room by Lids is everything else sports apparel related and also some hats and a lot of hats and all.

200
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Yeah. More hats. It's just that locker room, which I guess like they were thinking like

201
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
they didn't want it to be foot locker because obviously it doesn't make sense.

202
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Not just shoes, but like locker room suggests sports, I guess. Yeah.

203
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:27,000
But Haggis had asked this. Well, and it's a lot of jerseys and that's what's in the locker rooms. Right.

204
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:35,000
So it is an applicable name. Why didn't they just I think that there's some hubris here or some ego involved with this company

205
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:42,000
because why does it have to say by Lids? Does anyone care? I think that's a branding thing. Right.

206
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
But you know, I mean, there's so many different companies that are owned by by the same one big company

207
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
and they don't necessarily feel they need to brand it everywhere.

208
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:54,000
It feels like the Lids thing is confusing. Why didn't they just call jerseys? Yeah.

209
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Just call it jerseys, Lids and jerseys. And people are going to be like, well, I trust the Lids brand so much

210
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
that I'll go to see what they have as far as jerseys are concerned.

211
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
This is a thing on our beloved The Prophet.

212
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:13,000
There's a lot there's been a number of cases where he kind of combines stores and then it's such and such by such.

213
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Oh, so he likes that. Yeah. And I know that's the thing I disagree with him on.

214
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
That's a fashion label gimmick. Sure. Apparel thing.

215
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Yeah. Yeah. He doesn't like the idea that the name of the brand is the same as the name of the store.

216
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Actually, what you're describing with Skechers, he would like a, you know, high steppers by Skechers.

217
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Yeah. Great idea of a shoe name. That's interesting.

218
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I'm looking here. Lids is owned by Hat World Inc. Well, now hold on.

219
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I don't know why there's not a Hat World establishment because that has me. That is my interest.

220
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I mean, certainly Hat World is a better name than Lids.

221
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Yeah. I think Lids is cool, but Hat World is so much better.

222
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:01,000
And like that's a more exciting title. Hat World is the best level on Super Mario Odyssey, right?

223
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Let's see. There might be a Hat World's actually. Hold on. Yeah.

224
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Do they call it that in Japan or Dubai or something? Maybe. Do they loosen the brand?

225
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:15,000
The Lids Sports Group operating within Hat World Inc comprises the Lids retail headwear store,

226
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:21,000
the Lids locker room specialty fan retail chain, the Lids clubhouse retail store,

227
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:28,000
and its internet business, www.lids.com and www.lids.ca.

228
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,000
You hear that and you think, oh, we don't have real jobs.

229
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:41,000
There's probably 200 people who day to day have to make sure that all of these brand names are intact and presented correctly.

230
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Yeah. What a dull world.

231
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Yeah. So what's interesting is that it seems like Lids is pretty self-contained.

232
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
They're not owned by some giant conglomerate.

233
00:15:52,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Well, I feel like people always want sports apparel. People always want jerseys and hats and stuff.

234
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I thought it was interesting that they had so much variety in locker room by Lids.

235
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Certainly as soon as you walked in the door, very thoughtful.

236
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:18,000
A lot of World Cup jerseys. Sure. World Cup also playing directly on the giant big screen outside of the movie theater.

237
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Yeah. It's your source for sports. It is. Yeah, exactly.

238
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Maybe I'm wrong. They are owned by, this is so confusing.

239
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,000
They are owned by Genesco, which owns Johnston and Murphy shoewear.

240
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Something called Deerstags.

241
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Journeys, Journeys Kids, Underground by Journeys.

242
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Schoetraske and She by Journeys retail of footwear for young women 20 to 35 years of age.

243
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,000
And they own the tender care centers at the border that the children are being insured in.

244
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Jesus, probably. That is what happens to these horrible companies.

245
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:07,000
There is also before locker room by Lids, if you can imagine such a time, there was a store in there for a long time called Sports Avenue,

246
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:12,000
which is similarly silly to Hats World.

247
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:21,000
A thing that I liked about Sports Avenue is that there was a big shack on the outside because it must have opened when Shaq was on the Lakers,

248
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:33,000
but they did not have access to the Lakers rights. So Shaq was dunking in a red jersey, which he I don't believe ever wore in his skirlies.

249
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:39,000
He was magic in Lakers. I wouldn't be the guy to tell you, but I don't, certainly at the time he wasn't wearing red.

250
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:45,000
And I think in his jersey just said like All-Star, Team Jump.

251
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:51,000
It was like his watered down of branding as it could be the pride the L.A.

252
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:59,000
fans felt when they saw Shaq and his famous red and brown team jump.

253
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Just represent Team Jump. Team Jump. Great, great brand names in this zone.

254
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:13,000
What a what an area. You know what I haven't said about just to backtrack what I forgot to say at the beginning is that with Sector 9,

255
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:23,000
we are moving into the CityWalk expansion zone. This whole everything passed to the Hard Rock Cafe and starting with

256
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Skechers and the food court around there is where that's what all got added in 2000 when the when the the billion dollar expansion of somehow that little Jesus Christ

257
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:45,000
row of like the wind up toy store cost a billion dollars. The rest of CityWalk leading up to that point cost three billion dollars,

258
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:54,000
which is so weird when you think about theme park numbers, isn't it supposedly California Adventure entirely cost like seven hundred million dollars?

259
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
That's really the first. Yeah, the first unfixed version.

260
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:06,000
And when it opened was, yeah, I think seven hundred, they said something like less than the like something where the most prominent thing was Sports Avenue.

261
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Yeah, I know it was. It wasn't the redo like a billion dollars. California Adventure. Yeah, it cost two billion.

262
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I think just Carthage Circle area, just that street, the main drag heading up to Carthage Circle and California Adventure was like a billion dollars.

263
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:30,000
It looks the same as this history. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, point of history is. Yeah. But and that's like beautiful molding recalling classic California.

264
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:39,000
And this is a bunch of fucking gaudy crap metal and, you know, like a big helmet. I just where the money go.

265
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:48,000
This is a scam. Is that also like the cost of building on top of what essentially a tiny mountain, you know, trying to run water and power?

266
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Maybe. And is someone without a real job? I don't know. And I hope to never know. But maybe that costs more money to construct. Yeah, I'm sure.

267
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:08,000
They also threw a little money down for the inauguration of CityWalk 2.0, which I didn't know about until the other day that this was somewhere.

268
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I don't know if it was in this sector somewhere around this zone. There was also there was a Harley Davidson store at one point. That was one of the most exciting aspects of CityWalk 2000.

269
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:28,000
So in keeping with the motorcycle spirit, they kicked things off with a motorcycle parade led by the easy rider himself, Peter Fonda.

270
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:42,000
He led some motorcycle several feet forward and then he said, are you ready to start partying?

271
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:50,000
That's also what he said on Twitter recently. I was threatening to kill Trump or something.

272
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Something like that. But now, I mean, it was like, I'm going to run you over with a motorcycle parade. A two mile an hour motorcycle parade.

273
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:09,000
OK, so are you ready to start partying? Then quote the LA Times. That was the cue for a fireworks display and a set by Big Bad Voodoo Daddy. God bless him.

274
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:18,000
2000, a simpler time. Big Bad Voodoo Daddy who played New Year's Eve at Disneyland like two years ago. I'm pretty sure they were the primary. Yes.

275
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Oh, boy, I feel like the age of the good band at Disneyland is a little over. You would prefer to Cherry Poppin' Daddy's perhaps?

276
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You got something a little more high end. A Brian Setzer Orchestra, of course.

277
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Yeah. Then Larry Kurzweil, the president of Universal Hollywood said, who better to launch the new CityWalk than Peter Fonda?

278
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Hmm. Yeah, I guess. A currently popular star of the year 2000.

279
00:21:50,000 --> 00:22:02,000
What we're offering is a totally cool entertainment experience. So having him here fit right in. Perfect. CityWalk and CityWalk 2000 and Peter Fonda, both totally cool.

280
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Man, that's so funny. Yeah, something, huh? I'd also like to say that I believe that 2000 was when the new CityWalk logo was introduced.

281
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:23,000
And if you can picture that in your minds, I want to say just off the top of my head that that logo contains seven fonts and 65 colors all screaming at each other.

282
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Is that the one that's currently still up there? Where the letters are all kind of on different levels?

283
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Yeah, there's some of them are jagged and like kicking each other in the butt and there's like electricity and it's like it's on a broken TV.

284
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:52,000
It's the logo is a big I could see if you pulled up in a cab and you look at that logo outside the book at a Beppo, maybe you go, you want to just take me back?

285
00:22:52,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I don't know. I'm glad they've just stuck to their guns for 18 years. That was the only logo in Orlando because Orlando was only opened in 99 the CityWalk.

286
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Correct. I was saying a lot of Disney World feels like it's 90s. Like you go to Blizzard Beach and it's like the 90s are back.

287
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Yeah. And it does feel like that even though this expansion opened what year? 2000.

288
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Which I guess is very close to 90s. So like it does feel like the 90s are alive at CityWalk still. I think they're slowly trying to get rid of that feeling that vibe.

289
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,000
But yeah, I think big mistake. I think keep the 90s alive forever.

290
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:40,000
The dream of the 90s is alive at CityWalk to paraphrase Portlandia. Portland, the home of one of the newest additions at CityWalk. Voodoo Donuts.

291
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Oh yeah. I wasn't sure if we were saving that for last.

292
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Oh whatever. No we're not.

293
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
We're not. No, that's fine.

294
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
That transition was just so good. It was good.

295
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
I just jump around. You're eating a Voodoo Donut right now.

296
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,000
I started eating it. I don't know why I did because I was like we're recording and you're eating.

297
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,000
You also said you had had that kind before so I wasn't sure that you were going to finish that way.

298
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Well you can have the rest of the other one. Oh okay.

299
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Here let me first start out with a negative about Voodoo Donuts. And we were very excited because we found out Voodoo was coming.

300
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Voodoo Donuts was like the hipster-y donut place in Portland and it's like you would see pictures of lines.

301
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Down the block. People down the block and everyone was very excited about it.

302
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:23,000
And then it feels like they were just like we're cashing out. Like let's put this thing everywhere.

303
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:28,000
We're not at a cool exclusive thing anymore. We're going to be in every tourist trap.

304
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Well have you ever seen the owners talk?

305
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:38,000
I don't think so. Because I have now and I don't think I wouldn't apply the word cool to them.

306
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Well they are also members of Big Bad Voodoo Daddy.

307
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:52,000
So you don't call them cool. Anyway we've got to get out. We're opening this store and now we need to get on a plane to St. Louis.

308
00:24:52,000 --> 00:25:00,000
I got a trumpet to tune. So we were very I remember Jason and I at this time. This has been open for how long? Two years?

309
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
I think two years. A year and a half.

310
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
I remember we were texting about it. When's the Voodoo Donuts coming?

311
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Very excited because I had not been to Portland but the line was far too long when I was there.

312
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,000
I was like I cannot. We were trying to sight see and we did not want to wait for two hours.

313
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Jason told me of something that they do in Portland and I think you know where I'm going with this.

314
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Oh I think I do.

315
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:26,000
They do in Portland and I was very excited for this to come to CityWalk. It makes sense that it's not there but I was disappointed.

316
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Jason the phrase I believe you used or made me aware of was bucket of misshapens.

317
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Yes.

318
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:39,000
And what that means is that when they're making a donut and it kind of comes out weird or wonky or looks weird.

319
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Tastes fine. Tastes fine but it's just a little irregularly shaped.

320
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:48,000
They throw in a big white plastic bucket used for like hauling utility or paint.

321
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Like a big orange bucket from Home Depot.

322
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Yeah. Yeah it's a giant Home Depot style bucket. They throw a bunch of misshapen donuts in there and then you can go in there and buy them for like 20 bucks.

323
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Something like that. Like some sort of markdown rate.

324
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Bucket of misshapens.

325
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Yeah.

326
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:14,000
And very early on when we were going up and trying Voodoo donuts for the first time we learned that they do not have buckets of misshapens.

327
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:22,000
No. I found out about it I think either from Kelly Sudakonic or Matt Fraction her husband.

328
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:32,000
One of them posted a picture on their blog or Instagram or something of the laid out misshapens and the bucket next to it and explaining what it was.

329
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
And I when I heard it was coming here I was like well that sounds great.

330
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Now kind of knew that like I probably won't do that for City Walk.

331
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
I know. It doesn't make sense.

332
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:50,000
It doesn't make sense. You can I believe buy a coffin full of donuts though for like a hundred and thirty five dollars.

333
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
But are they misshapen?

334
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,000
No it's just a coffin full. It's just a you get to keep the coffin.

335
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Just fine.

336
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Just correctly shaped donuts.

337
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:08,000
That's fun I guess but it's less fun than getting a grab bag because like I was all excited for you to go up there and get a bucket of misshapens and bring it back down and we could all like rifle through them.

338
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,000
I don't know that it would have made it back down brother.

339
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:18,000
When Jason's feeling low he would just head up the hill to City Walk and get a bucket of misshapens and.

340
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Hey the usual Matt. Put it on the tab.

341
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Jason pulls up to the bar and he just eats.

342
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:29,000
And literally when I say this bucket the bucket is like 16 inches tall.

343
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
What isn't it? It's big right?

344
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:36,000
I think it is a repurposed home depot or Lowe's bucket that you would buy if you had a job to do.

345
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,000
I have to say that this isn't the full Voodoo Donuts experience that we were hoping.

346
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Yeah.

347
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Because the bucket of misshapens is not there.

348
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:54,000
I also had some trepidation when they were coming because one very cool thing I think about LA is there is like a culture of mom and pop donut shops.

349
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:59,000
A lot of them run by immigrant families from Asia.

350
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:08,000
And there's a great story on Eater about this and about like the signature like pink box that a lot of donut shops use.

351
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Right.

352
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Goes back to like one of the first immigrants from Asia.

353
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:24,000
I forget when 70s maybe late 60s 70s you know there was a lot of conflict over there at the time.

354
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,000
And they came over they started you know someone showed them how to run a donut shop.

355
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,000
And then they brought a family over and they started expanding the donut shop.

356
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:39,000
And very early on they asked for a red box because that's a good luck color.

357
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:46,000
And what something messed up at the print factory and they're like oh we're sorry the order came out as pink boxes.

358
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
And they're like well we already paid for it.

359
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
We'll just take them.

360
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
We'll just take them.

361
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
And then it was such a big hit.

362
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,000
It kind of spread everywhere.

363
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:02,000
I'm going to take out that segment of you talking about the donuts and I'm going to play the national anthem under it.

364
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Segment that.

365
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Because like you're that's so much information is very interesting.

366
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:12,000
But it also sounded like you're really giving a nice like patriotic speech about America and immigrants.

367
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
And I was nice.

368
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Yeah.

369
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
It is a cool little thing.

370
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
I learned especially in LA.

371
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
LA only last few years got like Dunkin Donuts.

372
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Right.

373
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
There's Winchell's there's more LA specific chains.

374
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Right.

375
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:32,000
But we also like the last few years seen like a lot of bougier donut change bougie donuts bougie ice cream.

376
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Kettle glazed.

377
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Kettle glazed.

378
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:46,000
So like I have to give Voodoo credit because even with city walk pricing factored in it's not that much more expensive than the donut shop I walked to up the street from my house.

379
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,000
We thought it was a little overpriced for what we.

380
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Yes.

381
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Some of the bigger ones but like your standard like I had a buttermilk bar and it was about the same as like the buttermilk donut I usually get.

382
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Now I think I don't know that it was any better.

383
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Honestly I think it was probably a little smaller.

384
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
I feel like some of the stuff is a little smaller.

385
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:14,000
And then I know once you start putting bacon or cereal on top of stuff it's definitely like some of the more wild donuts.

386
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Yeah.

387
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:25,000
But they are far pricier and certainly they have the Stumptown coffee which I think is OK but like priced much higher than like a Starbucks.

388
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
And only one size.

389
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
You're stuck with a giant.

390
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Yeah.

391
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
That's what I found.

392
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Yeah.

393
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
We just we had a big big four dollar thing.

394
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Pretty tall.

395
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Hot coffee or iced coffee.

396
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Hot.

397
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
OK.

398
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Fancy hot coffee.

399
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Some roasters taste like soup to me.

400
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Sure.

401
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Tastes like a a a bouillon broth almost or like a thin.

402
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
I don't know.

403
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
It's kind of like a weird taste for me.

404
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Yeah.

405
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
And I don't mind just a burnt black bad coffee.

406
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Yeah.

407
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
I don't either.

408
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
In fact that's one thing I like a lot about the Dota shops in L.A.

409
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,000
It's kind of like a standard coffee shop cup of coffee.

410
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Would you would you rather be buried in a giant pink donut box or a giant bucket of misshapen or the coffin or the or the Voodoo coffee.

411
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
The Voodoo coffin.

412
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,000
I think that pink donut box.

413
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Now would they have to fold up your body to make it fit in the square shape or would you would would a custom long pink donut box do.

414
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Custom I think right.

415
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
I think custom.

416
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Hey look.

417
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
You don't want to pay for that.

418
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
I don't want to pay now that you say that.

419
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
That's going to be expensive.

420
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Maybe just put the ashes in a pink donut box.

421
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
The ashes in the donut box is a good solution.

422
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Here's what I think is a good solution.

423
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:54,000
You get that acid that Walter White would use in a vats to get rid of a body and you use the plastic misshapen bucket.

424
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
That's a good idea.

425
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
And they just dissolve your body in the misshapen bucket.

426
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Right.

427
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Because you got to use plastic you can't use ceramics.

428
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
So it would be perfect for it.

429
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,000
We are misshapens when we are born and we are misshapens when we die.

430
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:12,000
One one thing I do like about Voodoo and and like I said I had a buttermilk bar.

431
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:20,000
I shared Mike and I shared some of a raised glazed raised vanilla iced with Captain Crunchberries on it.

432
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Right.

433
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Yes.

434
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Both very tasty.

435
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:40,000
One thing I will say about like some of these nicer more upscale donut shops it does they do taste very clean by which I mean like at some cheaper places like you can kind of taste the oil a lot or like the doughnuts can be very greasy especially they've been sitting out for the day.

436
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Yeah it's not a consistent flavor through the whole thing sometimes.

437
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Yeah.

438
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
I tell me if I'm wrong.

439
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Do all the doughnuts taste a little stale because I've had I've had to play three times in the last year and a half.

440
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Every time I feel like this feels like it's a day old.

441
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,000
I think I've had a lot of cake and you had a lot of raised.

442
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,000
I'm a raised man and where are we all at on doughnuts cake or raised.

443
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
I don't even know the difference.

444
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:12,000
I guess wait is raised like cake is like a thicker and raised is flaky.

445
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Yeah.

446
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Both of the ones we have here though the Captain Crunch and then the other with a Voodoo man.

447
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Those are raised.

448
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
I'm raised then.

449
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Yes.

450
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Yeah.

451
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,000
You like cake right.

452
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
I've grown more to like cake.

453
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,000
I think it's more popular in Los Angeles back East where more popular Los Angeles.

454
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
I don't I don't like that.

455
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Certainly growing up back East eight a lot of raised a lot of Dunkin Donuts are raised.

456
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Crispy cream is all raised.

457
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
That's raised.

458
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Yeah.

459
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Usually pretty much everywhere offers some sort of one or two cake options.

460
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Yeah.

461
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:49,000
I think that you forget what they have over there because like I went to crispy cream a couple of weeks ago and crispy cream does taste so much fresher than this.

462
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
You think so.

463
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
I think so.

464
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Yes.

465
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
I'm more of a fan of crispy cream.

466
00:33:54,000 --> 00:34:02,000
The simplicity and yeah it is like a was it more distinct taste than what I eat with the specific things I brought today from.

467
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:16,000
I think this is I think Voodoo is honestly Voodoo's Voodoo's charm is the branding the marketing and then the insanity something that's crazy which of course you know I like like cereal and like having a lot of frosting on it and it's crazy shaped or something.

468
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,000
But I honestly think it's on the level of Dunkin Donuts.

469
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,000
I don't think the donuts themselves are anything that special.

470
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:43,000
You also I don't think I don't know if I like that crazy again I watched some videos with the owners and they're talking about how like you know honestly like I shouldn't say this but what we did is we got a little baked and we walked up and down the supermarket aisles and we were like yeah I did a doughnut with Captain Crunch on it and then bang there is and that made me like I hate that.

471
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:49,000
I like this and they're like they're they wear like pants with fruit loops on them they're all bunch of it.

472
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Hepcat kooks.

473
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,000
I don't I think gravy style.

474
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Yeah.

475
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Yeah.

476
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:02,000
I haven't brought up wavy gravy gravy and pig pen of the world.

477
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
I love wavy.

478
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:14,000
I'm going to give Duncan though the edge because I think I always found them very consistent. Sure and they are cheaper than Voodoo.

479
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Yeah.

480
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:21,000
But if we're talking city walk Voodoo is probably your cheapest snack option up at City Walk pretty easy.

481
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Well it depends I mean we're not talking talking to sugar but you can get a nice little bag of candy for three bucks.

482
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:34,000
I guess so I guess that depends on if you find candy that filling or what sort of snack you're looking for.

483
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Of course it depends on what kind of snack you're looking for.

484
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Yeah so yeah I would say it's on the level of Duncan I like the Voodoo doughnuts but it certainly came in came in overhyped came in hot.

485
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
No bucket of misshapens.

486
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:54,000
So I was a little let down not that I would certainly have a doughnut there again but I was a little underwhelmed by it.

487
00:35:54,000 --> 00:36:02,000
They also don't have like the edgy stuff that they have in Portland like dicks and joints that stuff didn't make it to the theme park setting.

488
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Yes there's the bodiness is not there because they don't want to offend anybody because they're not the people with the Portland sensibility can handle vulgarity I guess but the people at the City Walk they're worried about the kids maybe being offended.

489
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
We're a PG shop.

490
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:23,000
And honestly I'm fine with that because as you know we don't like too much vulgarity especially around a family entertainment.

491
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:31,000
I wonder how the I guess we'll talk about this in that sector the things from another world also important from Portland.

492
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Oh interesting.

493
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Yeah what else about food oh the Voodoo mascot Voodoo mascot.

494
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Yes we were they had the grand opening for the Voodoo doughnuts is that the City Walk in Orlando as well.

495
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Oh yeah.

496
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,000
And who were we bothering on Twitter were we bothering Jim Hill on Twitter.

497
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:53,000
We were bothering asking if he was going to be a face character.

498
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Yeah will this mascot character be there every day.

499
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Can we meet him.

500
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
What did he say.

501
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Did what did he answer us and he did.

502
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
I think he said he'd look into it.

503
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
I think he said he'd look into it but we never found out.

504
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
We got to get that answer from him.

505
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Yeah I probably said that's it exactly.

506
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:18,000
I think that is probably what he said but he never said it to us so he's got a look Jim way in here way in here buddy maybe we'll just have him on to just talk about the character of the Voodoo doughnuts.

507
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Voodoo doughnuts spirit man they named him in a video I watched but I don't remember it Voodoo but Voodoo doughnuts spirit man with Jim Hill is an episode.

508
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Research about that character.

509
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
It's happening Jim whether you agree to do it or not.

510
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Yeah.

511
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:40,000
If you don't know we're talking about entertainment podcaster we've talked about him before.

512
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Listen to his podcast Disney dish.

513
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Anybody who's in section nine probably knows.

514
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:54,000
So what if see what if you're getting into podcast for the first time and you're going like I thought this was about theme parks and they're talking about donuts and buckets of misshapens and shoes.

515
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
This is a show about shoes and donuts.

516
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:00,000
You know they say every comic book is someone's first comic book so that's exactly what I'm trying to do.

517
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Yes.

518
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Ahoy hoy to anyone coming in on sector nine of the city walks.

519
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Starting right in the middle.

520
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
We are in the middle aren't we.

521
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:18,000
So I guess that brings us to the last establishment at sector nine and Scott you said you had some experience at this one.

522
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Dong Po kitchen.

523
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Scott's face is grimacing.

524
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Yeah.

525
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,000
I had a very odd time there.

526
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:33,000
So I went up with my friend Ryan who's in town who I went to high school with and probably spent a lot of time at city walk with in high school but he hadn't been in a long time.

527
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
He was dying to see the new developments.

528
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Sure.

529
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:49,000
The voodoo donut and you know he lives in Hong Kong currently so I thought oh well it's taking him to Dong Po kitchen and comparing the delicacies makes a lot of sense but it was very late when we were up there.

530
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:58,000
And so we went in at like 1030 and so it was not meal time and Dong Po kitchen.

531
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:09,000
So this is a space that's been occupied by several other higher ends Chinese establishments like Panda Express has tried something called Panda Inn which exists in various locations.

532
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:14,000
And I think that was the family who ran runs that company or started that company.

533
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,000
I think Panda Inn came first.

534
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:21,000
That was where they popularized orange chicken and then they started Panda Express.

535
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Interesting.

536
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,000
I believe it was in Pasadena where the experimental kitchen is.

537
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Oh really.

538
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
The test kitchen for Panda Express.

539
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,000
It's like if Chili's too was more popular than Chili's.

540
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Yeah.

541
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:42,000
But this is a recent addition to city walk is Dong Po kitchen my friend being versed in Chinese history and culture.

542
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Let me know that he is that is named for Sue Dong Po who is a poet and gastronome in the Song dynasty.

543
00:39:50,000 --> 00:40:00,000
But he is on Wikipedia he's described as the preeminent personality of the 11th century. But now he is mainly known for having a pork dish named after him.

544
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:12,000
So we went in there and you know what I'll say the decor was very nice this kind of this calligraphy feeling these big paint brushes and actual and like poems written out in characters which are hand laid.

545
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,000
I think the decor is very nice in this place.

546
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:24,000
But we went in 1030 and we and I I'm worried when we go into places that and just want a drink and dessert.

547
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,000
I feel a little awkward about it because the guy the person doesn't get tipped as much.

548
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:36,000
So I went in and asked like hey can we just do a drink and dessert thing and the very sweet hostess who said oh yeah.

549
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Oh of course.

550
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,000
No we are desserts are excellent here.

551
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Take a look and showed us a list and oh that's this all sounds excellent.

552
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Yes. So I'd love to. Oh and as for drinks we have many options here.

553
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Take a look many good wine. Yes. Yes. Oh our wine is excellent.

554
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Well here come. Yeah. Come on in.

555
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:02,000
She's very like oddly sweet and awkward and inviting and and and led us to a table and like oh OK good.

556
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,000
I'm really glad this is not imposing on them right in any way.

557
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Then waiter comes up waiter a very brusk Kurt's ponytail dude who just like that.

558
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:23,000
What do you want. And like clearly at the end of a long day like immediate tension and frustration.

559
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,000
And I was like oh you know we're just doing kind of a drinks and desserts thing.

560
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:30,000
I roll. I order. Yeah. Yeah.

561
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:36,000
A lot of negative extremely. I just said let me do a glass of seven on block.

562
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:42,000
No drink. We don't have alcohol. The last half hour past 1030 we don't have alcohol.

563
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,000
That's 1030. Oh that's a cut off. I think I've encountered this.

564
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:51,000
I think I encountered this at Carl Strauss once.

565
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:55,000
My family went at 830 and they went no we already did last call.

566
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
We're like what. And they're like yeah we close at nine.

567
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,000
You got the last call half an hour before at the beer restaurant.

568
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:05,000
The beer restaurant. The restaurant that you walk into and there's giant beer tanks.

569
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:10,000
You get past 830. I mean it was like November.

570
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,000
So technically like an off season but still that's weird.

571
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Well I think the whole like you know like City Walk is your place to drink and dance the night away.

572
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:23,000
But you know around 745 you should probably think about getting out of here.

573
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:29,000
It doesn't make sense to me. So there was no alcoholic option and all we were going to do is a dessert.

574
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:33,000
And we were like do I. I don't want no I don't like boba. I'm not going to force a boba down.

575
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:37,000
So we said you know we're just we're just doing this this rice ball thing.

576
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:44,000
And he like gave us just the thickest glare and then just snatched menus walked away.

577
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,000
And we're like what's happening here.

578
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:58,000
And then he comes back with water and slams it down just the loudest you could slam a glass of water down furious at us.

579
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Then he then comes somebody comes back with the dessert.

580
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Seems like you guys just ordered the rice balls. Yeah.

581
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Puts it down also a little mad.

582
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Basically what this ended up being it looks like two like soft boiled eggs floating in like a dessert version of egg drop soup.

583
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:25,000
And it was mostly like dessert broth. And there was it is not shareable in the least.

584
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:32,000
So I'm like sadly spooning some of the soup onto a plate trying to pick it up with chopsticks.

585
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:37,000
It's falling apart. Take a bite. It's bad. My friend mostly takes the broth.

586
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:41,000
The broth is bad. We have sour looks on our face.

587
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:48,000
And then ponytail man goes past my friend and he's in the middle of a conversation with another server.

588
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,000
And he says yeah they only got they only got rice balls.

589
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,000
I don't want to talk about it.

590
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,000
This would upset me for a month.

591
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:06,000
This this might be one of the worst service that like I you know I know the service industry very hard industry.

592
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:12,000
I I but this I this is crazy to me.

593
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Like this is like I don't want to do this but I feel like I got our e-mail.

594
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:28,000
So like this is intense. Well luckily I have luckily as an outlet and luckily by me not remembering his name or hopefully not seeing him again.

595
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:33,000
This certainly stronger than me ponytail man cannot come back and find me.

596
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:37,000
There was there was a general. Then I started to figure out oh they're trying to close up.

597
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:40,000
They close at 11 but I didn't know that that wasn't on this.

598
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:48,000
And this poor hostess who so volatile monologued about the drinks and desserts.

599
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Then she set a family down and it's a mom and two kids with a little iPad menus lit up.

600
00:44:54,000 --> 00:45:02,000
And then I look back and they you know these innocent looking little kids and then the hostess yells well Steve told me to see them.

601
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:07,000
This whole thing was unraveling customers are being screamed about.

602
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:15,000
It was just coming apart. It was crazy. We tried to go get a drink there once after a movie because their Yelp page.

603
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:23,000
That's one complaint I have about city walk. Sometimes the Yelp hours do not line up with actual business operating hours.

604
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:30,000
And I guess that's kind of true for anywhere. But you think city walk they'd be a little more on the ball at that.

605
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:36,000
I don't know. Maybe. But again yeah I had a similar like well it seems like they're open.

606
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:40,000
The doors open and we're like hey we just want to get a drink.

607
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:44,000
And they told they but then they're like oh no sorry we're close.

608
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:53,000
But I'm like but both your doors are wide open and like that's an all literature about you says open now.

609
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Here's the thing. I worked at the container store when I was younger.

610
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:01,000
I'm going to say I'm going to share my experience with the only real job.

611
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:05,000
I mean I was a P.A. and stuff but as far as real jobs that's what that's what I had.

612
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:11,000
If somebody walked in the door we were told we close at whatever 10 o'clock and somebody walked in the door at 9 59.

613
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:15,000
You let them browse. You let them do whatever you try to help them.

614
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:23,000
You certainly maybe could say oh yeah we're close but I'd be happy to do whatever like the customer service is that even if people are annoying

615
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:32,000
and won't and like won't leave or kind of not being so aware of what's going on is that you don't tell the fuck out of here.

616
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:45,000
That's not nice. Also this is I think like Voodoo certainly but especially Dong Po Kitchen like kind of their first volley of like a changing city walk.

617
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Like this is an upscale. This is an international brand. It's like a chain of high end restaurants in China.

618
00:46:55,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Maze Maze who don't po is like throughout Los Angeles County in very nice locations like very nice establishments.

619
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Apparently I don't know. I've never been to them but reading about it like Santa Monica Century City.

620
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:22,000
And then the city walk one is a little more like you know for a general audience but it's still like well that's the face like that's the experience you're having.

621
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Like I'm not expecting like you know the ritz but still like a mean man screaming about me.

622
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:34,000
I've never been yelled about in a way which just made us like yeah.

623
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:42,000
We got to get the fuck out of here. This is crazy. I think that look like probably the people that work at Dong Po will listen to this.

624
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:48,000
They will offer you a meal maybe on the house. They did not know you were an influencer coming in there.

625
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:55,000
A theme park journalist. And I also think once the voodoo people they will send multiple buckets of misshapens to Jason's house.

626
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,000
I mean that'd be great. And I think that they hopefully will make this right.

627
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:12,000
I'm sure you know there's sometimes you get an employee that's cranky and they don't understand exactly how other employees listen to podcasts right scanning for mention of their brands and they make it right.

628
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:17,000
Which to that to that effect I'd like anything that's coming to us from how world think as well. Oh yeah.

629
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:25,000
If that world Inc is listening please send us what do we want from them. Oh I'd love any of these sports fans that we are.

630
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:33,000
The the vintage filly scholars used to be baby blue and like kind of maroon. And I really like that pairing.

631
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:40,000
OK. I want anything that says Andre Dawson on it. My favorite cub when I was five. Scott we're taking orders. See what I think.

632
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:47,000
Wait do they own Lids locker room or do they own. No they don't own Skechers. No they don't. No that's a different. Yeah.

633
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:58,000
They do own that fancy shoe like McCormick shoe whatever. McCormick is not. I want replicas of the shoes that OJ wore. OK.

634
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:06,000
The murders. I think that's that's doable. Yeah. Perfect replicas in his size not mine. They they have cobblers that could just put a custom shoe together.

635
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Custom cobbler on it but not some mean ponytailed one. Right. Well that's kind of getting us to the end of sector nine which is we're getting near the end of the end.

636
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:26,000
What is the halfway point. What do we pass that way point during this one. I think halfway through 10. We're almost there. Right. OK.

637
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:38,000
And I see right now we're getting our stone it is misshapen. Oh it is wonderful. Shape it. So put it with the bucket of the rest of the stone.

638
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:49,000
The sector keeper is smiling on us today and he'll also smile if you come back tomorrow to listen to is tomorrow Lids regular proper.

639
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:56,000
I don't remember. It is confusing that they're in different sectors but hey that's how the sectors go. Well there's stores in between them. Yeah.

640
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:08,000
