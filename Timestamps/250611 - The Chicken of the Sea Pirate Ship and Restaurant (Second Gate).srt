1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,960
Tuna ho, it's podcast the ride, the second gate.

3
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,200
I'm Scott Gardner, Mike Carlson.

4
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:33,800
I'm here and I am excited because we've never really like dove into tuna a lot here.

5
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,880
We've dove, we've talked about subway tuna, which I'm a big fan of, but I feel

6
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:41,600
like Jason and I especially, and I don't want to get, he should talk for himself,

7
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,280
but I feel like Jason and I are a little tuna boys.

8
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:45,360
God damn it.

9
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:45,960
Right away.

10
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:46,440
I'm so sorry.

11
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:47,480
Do you want me to leave?

12
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:50,600
Do you want me to just stop recording now?

13
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,360
And in the first minute you get little tuna boy.

14
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,960
All right, well, let's let one of them talk.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:55,800
Sorry, sorry.

16
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:01,000
I thought I was going to throw that to Mike cause I know he was a tuna guy,

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,920
but I was afraid I misremembered.

18
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,880
Now what you just said, tuna guy, that was interesting, right?

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,160
That has a ring to it, right?

20
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:13,560
That as I look in this room of older men with gray hairs, I think, yes,

21
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:17,560
tuna guy is a, I still don't love the tuna part, but then being a

22
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:20,840
tuna guy is strange to me, but doesn't, isn't that kind of a nice,

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,040
do you notice the words that were missing there?

24
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,600
Wasn't it nice to not have one of those weird words weighing us all down?

25
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:31,240
If we had said, if I had said tuna guy, I was sort of, it was a

26
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,760
negotiation in a lot of ways.

27
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,840
Cause now tuna guys feels good to you.

28
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,720
Tuna guys might not have felt good to you.

29
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,880
If I just came out and said, Jason, I are tuna guys.

30
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:39,840
You'd be like, what is that?

31
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,360
Why would you call yourself tuna guys?

32
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:41,600
Yes.

33
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,800
You know, you're totally right.

34
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,920
I said little tuna boys and now you're disgusted.

35
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,280
And now Jason says tuna guys.

36
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,400
And you're like, oh, thank God.

37
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:48,960
It feels like nothing.

38
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,520
I was trying to deescalate this.

39
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,120
Feel warm, like a warm bath.

40
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,480
Trying to meet you where you are.

41
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,760
This is how Jason, like good cop, bad cop people.

42
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,080
I was bad.

43
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:59,760
I was, I would talk this out before you guys had it here.

44
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,000
Now here's what I want to say.

45
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,720
Little tuna boy.

46
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,000
I want to say it on this show.

47
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,360
I want to say it with a microphone.

48
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,920
Well, Scott's going to freak out though.

49
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:07,520
He's going to try to leave.

50
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,280
So here's what I'm going to do.

51
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:08,840
I'm going to come in.

52
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,640
I'm going to say tuna gun.

53
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,480
And it's going to seem a little bit, uh, calm everybody down.

54
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,720
Look, when I was writing my notes last night, did the phrase a little

55
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,800
tuna boys crossed my mind.

56
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,680
Of course it did.

57
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,480
Then I wrote a lot about tuna and Scott.

58
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:26,680
I had a tuna based hijinx last night that I, I would say, I, I

59
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:30,320
mentioned it to my, Jane and I.

60
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,240
He had really to wind up for that, for that anecdote.

61
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,200
This is, well, it took a while last.

62
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:38,640
Okay.

63
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:43,640
So we ordered firehouse subs and we ordered from the special from city

64
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,240
walk, just to make sure it was external.

65
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,440
You're getting ahead of him.

66
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,240
You're getting ahead of him.

67
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,680
Uh, I know this because he texted me separately.

68
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,440
Yeah, I texted him already.

69
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,960
Uh, cause he's a tuna guy.

70
00:02:53,040 --> 00:03:00,240
Um, we ordered from the North Hollywood location closer to Burbank and the, uh,

71
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:05,320
door to Asher Postmates punted it to the city walk location.

72
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,720
You were forced into the land of nubs.

73
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:14,640
And it took a while because people had to figure it out.

74
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:17,720
And, and Jane get up there, park, get up there.

75
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,480
Where is it?

76
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:22,000
I'm sure there was a delivery pickup area.

77
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:25,680
There's a second ride chair closer to Bucca.

78
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:26,400
Sure.

79
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:27,800
Just

80
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:35,360
you will never let you just say Bucca, whether you have it right or wrong.

81
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,480
That's one thing, but you know, you're never going to get away with just the one

82
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:43,760
word there was, so we ordered a firehouse subs and I lucked out cause I

83
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,400
just had a cold two and a sub.

84
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:51,320
Uh, so mine was fine when we got there, but she did what are like the hot

85
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:57,560
vegetables toasted, so hers was pretty, uh, kind of a mutant when it arrived.

86
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,840
Oh my yikes.

87
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:03,280
So, uh, they, they forcibly switch massive.

88
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,120
How much time do you think that added to the old scenario?

89
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,920
Probably half an hour or so.

90
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,320
Yeah.

91
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:08,680
Yeah.

92
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,000
I mean, not a lot of time in the grand scheme of things.

93
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,880
Stuff in the valley is reasonably close together, but it's like.

94
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:21,080
It was one of those things where it's like, we'll arrive in 15 to 20 minutes.

95
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:21,960
Like, ah, okay.

96
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,560
Reasonable time for a sandwich.

97
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:28,720
And then it just kept ticking up and ticking up and the driver dropped and

98
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,160
like passed on the order halfway through.

99
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,960
And then a different driver had to get, I think they tried to drive

100
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,880
around city walk and then gave up.

101
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:38,800
God.

102
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:44,400
So either of you have any normal interactions with food delivery and food service?

103
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:48,840
It feels, I know I'm getting just one, you know, I'm getting a slanted view

104
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:53,120
via the podcast, but I feel like you guys don't have one normal meal where

105
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,560
everything goes, you're just magnets for high jinks.

106
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,480
Yeah, I don't know.

107
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:59,640
I've been mostly high jink free for a few weeks.

108
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:03,000
I don't recall trying to eat high jink free, you know, what we had

109
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,320
local Chinese restaurants are always great.

110
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:10,160
And I always try to default to their, uh, restaurant website because

111
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,160
they have their own delivery people.

112
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,000
Sometimes, but then sometimes you get tricked because you

113
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,040
think it's their own delivery.

114
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,880
And then it just sends you to an Uber Eats on occasion.

115
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:22,240
But no, I, there was a, I ordered a medium hot wing from Holland

116
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,400
Rays and they gave me medium plus the other day.

117
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:27,320
So that was a high jink worked out in your favor.

118
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,000
But some high jinks are medium plus just meaning a spicier.

119
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,560
So it's not quite, okay.

120
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,960
You can have quite the same spice to your house.

121
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,960
Or did you have to do that thing where you went closer to Allen Rays?

122
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,680
That's a whole other explanation.

123
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,840
No, they now deliver the Pasadena location really quick.

124
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,400
Pause it, pause that sense.

125
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,520
I just want to say this is an episode about the pirate ship that

126
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,360
used to be at Disneyland.

127
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,400
It was an 1855 thing.

128
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:48,680
Okay.

129
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,840
Now that I've said the topic, feel free to talk about whatever that

130
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:52,640
is for seven more minutes.

131
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:55,440
I just wanted to get it in so that we know what we're dealing with.

132
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,200
I appreciate that.

133
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:56,440
Yeah.

134
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:59,960
I got so excited about this episode and learning about it.

135
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,560
He never tells me he's excited about episode when we're coming over here.

136
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:06,400
And today he went, I'm excited about excited one.

137
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:06,720
Wow.

138
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,960
Yes, because I, I primarily because I learned like all the basic stuff.

139
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:15,200
I watched a YouTube video of how to make the tuna burger.

140
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:22,520
Um, then I also read there's a long Jim Hill post about this.

141
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:26,600
So I learned all this other interesting stuff about it.

142
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,000
Okay.

143
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,360
Great.

144
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,280
So we got a lot to do.

145
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:31,040
Well, before the interesting stuff, Mike, what were you going to say?

146
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:37,000
Well, he asked me the uninteresting question, so it wasn't like I

147
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,600
wanted to offer it up through.

148
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:40,920
Okay.

149
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,040
Holland raises a hot chicken restaurant that used to only deliver.

150
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,320
It only used to deliver up to a certain point in Hollywood.

151
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:52,320
So during pandemic, I used to drive down to my old apartment, which is in the

152
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:55,920
zone where it would deliver and pick up the chicken from a street corner.

153
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,880
And I would say, Oh, right over here and act like I lived in the apartment or

154
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,880
whatever, and then I would drive up to Burbank and now the Pasadena location

155
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,040
is in the zone, so I can just order it directly to the house.

156
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,160
If I want from postmates.

157
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,480
Wow.

158
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,080
Sorry, Scott.

159
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:08,960
What a tale.

160
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,480
I was mostly asking because as you know, I also live in Burbank and I was like,

161
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,880
Oh, Pasadena delivers.

162
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,240
I'd love to have that sandwich.

163
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:17,480
Wait, what?

164
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,400
Say that sentence again.

165
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,360
I said, if Pasadena delivers, I'd love to have that sandwich.

166
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:22,720
Okay.

167
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,160
Gotcha.

168
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,360
It almost sounded like you said lovers or something.

169
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:25,800
I.

170
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,600
Pasadena lovers.

171
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,360
Yeah, that's what I thought too.

172
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:27,640
Yes.

173
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:27,920
Yeah.

174
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,400
Yes.

175
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,520
It's that hoagie mouth.

176
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,360
He just smushed words together.

177
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,640
That tuna hoagie.

178
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,760
It could be a tuna hoagie, right?

179
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,680
It could be a tuna hoagie.

180
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,520
That should become the standard.

181
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:41,080
Like if there is something you say that we don't understand, we let's just let

182
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:41,800
that should perennially.

183
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,080
We'll blame it on hoagie mouth.

184
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,000
I forget who invented that originally.

185
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,880
I've only seen the last few years, but that kind of sums up the dialect.

186
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,240
Great.

187
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:49,560
Great.

188
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:50,800
Okay.

189
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,040
Let's talk about what this is.

190
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:56,200
This is the chicken of the sea pirate ship.

191
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:01,560
This was a, uh, original Disneyland thing, not opening day a little bit later.

192
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,240
Uh, August 29th, 1955.

193
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,600
This was in fantasy land.

194
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:09,800
And though it was a little bit later, it does still count as a part of our

195
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:13,200
series, which is of course the class of.

196
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,200
Oh, well, what could I have done?

197
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,360
I played the wrong Sammy Hagar set.

198
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,480
I was supposed to play.

199
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,840
That's where it's supposed to be.

200
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:28,720
Uh, I can't drive 55, but I mistakenly played.

201
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,760
Tequila by Sammy and the Wobbos.

202
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:37,360
Um, you know, it worked out though, because the next lyric of this song is

203
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,040
my favorite lyric of the song.

204
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,920
Uh, check this out while I'm here.

205
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,920
Might require, uh, that was a little hoagie mouth that he sings.

206
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:55,920
Uh, she did a mean Macarena to, to the funky cold Medina.

207
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:56,840
Okay.

208
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:59,640
This is a lyric he wrote in 1999.

209
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,840
Well, it's somewhat topical, I guess.

210
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:06,480
I don't want to get us off on a tangent here, but in just in, now that we've,

211
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,320
this is the third one of these for, I've played a little Sammy Hagar clip

212
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,280
and this, this required me.

213
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,920
I was like, let me find up some other Hagar state.

214
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,640
He sucks.

215
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,560
He's terrible.

216
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,160
Right.

217
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,440
Scott, you really don't want to do this.

218
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,480
You don't want to do this.

219
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,280
Sangent timer.

220
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,320
You really.

221
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,160
What, what, give it, okay.

222
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,040
Well, this is a good test.

223
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,440
You need to argue quickly why he doesn't suck.

224
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,680
Well, I think some of the big Van Halen Sammy Hagar songs, does that

225
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,320
count in this, or are you talking about solo?

226
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,400
I think why can't this be love and dreams are great songs.

227
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,040
There's a couple other ones that I really like.

228
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:44,360
And I like some early Sammy Hagar, Van Hagar, nowhere close to, uh, David

229
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:47,360
Lee Roth, uh, I'm not, not even in the same ballpark.

230
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:54,480
It's, I deserve this after that fucking howling race.

231
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,560
I'm happy.

232
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,240
I'm happy.

233
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,320
I'm trying to, I'm trying to appease the tangent gods.

234
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:02,600
I'm happy to talk about what I think about David Lee Roth, who hit the

235
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:07,200
stage recently for the first time in a few years, fully 70 years old, full

236
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,080
black leather, he looks good.

237
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,040
I don't know if he sounded so good, but he's still saying a lot of

238
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,560
shit that makes no fucking sense.

239
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,520
Yeah, that's what he does.

240
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:14,720
Yeah.

241
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,920
We're just doing it.

242
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,000
You know, we're doing the big carnival in the sky.

243
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,480
Like that crazy laugh.

244
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,480
He has his bill hater clip went around.

245
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:26,560
He was telling a story about, uh, yeah.

246
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:33,520
Uh, I, the van Halen, uh, with, with David Lee Roth is very unique and specific.

247
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:38,640
And I, I understand better is what I understand why, but like much better

248
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:43,120
song teacher isn't, it's the John Brian performance pieces versus song thing.

249
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:48,320
I think, cause I have her teacher is like, undeniably, uh, like explosive

250
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,640
and full of energy and very unique, but like, why can't this be love and dreams?

251
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,960
They're more melodic songs.

252
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,920
And in some ways I, I, I don't know if I like them better, but I do like them.

253
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:01,480
Um, and then there's early Sammy Hagar stuff that I think is better.

254
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:06,400
He's certainly turned into a cartoon character of a pitch man for tequila.

255
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:11,640
And that is not doing anything interesting for many, many years.

256
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:14,760
I just find him more like power ballad-y snoozy.

257
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:17,320
And then what I just played is a garbage.

258
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,360
Well, yeah, I'm not a big mass tequila defender.

259
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:23,120
Suddenly this is another way, you know, you say tune a guy and

260
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,080
now I start, it just helps after hearing little tune a book.

261
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:29,320
I, I, that same, like not so bad.

262
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:29,920
Is it sudden?

263
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:32,640
I hear a bunch of like recent Sammy Hagar and I'm like,

264
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,320
Buffett was a fucking genius.

265
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:40,160
He was truly a gifted song, more better masterfully written than the last.

266
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,280
I think Sammy was Sammy, even though he had the, he had the tequila

267
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,200
fur, he had the whole like lifestyle brand.

268
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:50,520
He thinks first, uh, I feel like he almost was chasing Jimmy at a certain point

269
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:53,440
because of the Margaritaville restaurant, all the success Jimmy had.

270
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:59,360
So Jimmy was doing that garbage better than Sammy does.

271
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,720
And then yes, the meathead rock.

272
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,280
I could go, I I'm like, I never have.

273
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:06,520
I wanted some, uh, Casio steel drums more.

274
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:10,080
He wrote, but Sammy wrote that, uh, song Rick Springfield does.

275
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,320
I'm drawing a blank.

276
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,360
I've done everything for you.

277
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,480
You've done nothing for me.

278
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,760
Like, don't know that he's done.

279
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,160
That's a fun, I don't know, kind of pop rock song.

280
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:20,280
He has more like pop rocky things in the, in the past.

281
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:25,720
I feel like versus now, which is just that chicken foot and who'd be

282
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:29,320
my hoochie coochie man and stuff from chicken foot, speaking of chicken.

283
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:29,560
Yeah.

284
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,920
Speaking of chicken, chicken in the sea.

285
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,640
See, uh, okay.

286
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:35,120
Well here I stepped right into a, uh, another tangent.

287
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,600
I don't think I'm going to have to stop the tradition of playing Sammy Hager

288
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,000
because it's going to eat up 10 minutes at the top of.

289
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:43,120
I've done such a good job, not talking about it that much.

290
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,040
So yes, it's up to you.

291
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,680
It's up to you not to engage me.

292
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:50,160
I think if you took the, if you'd added up all the time that is in the, just

293
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,640
the three episodes, I think has been a substantial conversation every time.

294
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,480
I don't know where you're getting this good job.

295
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,040
I don't know.

296
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,280
I think I deserve a good job.

297
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,520
I deserve a good job.

298
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,080
Just say, Jason, tell me good job.

299
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,720
Uh, good job, Michael.

300
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:08,400
Um, I have, uh, no opinions on Van Halen or Sammy Hager.

301
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,280
Like, it's just a big blank for me.

302
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:15,600
I know, I know Sammy Hager primarily as the tequila guy, the cartoon

303
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:20,000
character, as you said, like the long hair, the cartoon, the kabo wabo

304
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,200
restaurant, since you're a blank slate on it, let's just, let's just solve it

305
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:24,560
right now.

306
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,200
David Lee Roth is better end of discussion.

307
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:31,160
So, uh, all right, moving on, but like when he did jump on the Jay Leno show

308
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:36,640
and the blue grass jump, he's got the big smile, he's lost like all of his

309
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:39,120
aura to that once a year.

310
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,360
That's why I love that performance range.

311
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:49,040
It is so, uh, blue grass jump from like 2000, he looks like the dorkiest man

312
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:49,480
you've ever seen.

313
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,320
He used to look like the cool, like a cool guy.

314
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,760
Just shaking around.

315
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,200
He looks so much cooler, right?

316
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,120
Like in the last show than he did at that point.

317
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:56,640
Oh, good.

318
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:56,960
Yeah.

319
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:59,600
Well, the overalls aren't going to do you a lot of good.

320
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:00,680
Uh, okay.

321
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,400
Let's, let's talk about this.

322
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:02,760
Okay.

323
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:10,240
So, um, the pirate ship, uh, regardless, outside of all of the, the tuna stuff,

324
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,160
which I guess I'm in for, and I'm probably delaying with the Halen talk.

325
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:19,000
Uh, uh, this was a, like a, a real staple and you might, you know, probably

326
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,800
I think in 55, when Disneyland opens, I bet one of the most, one of the

327
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:28,360
10 most impressive things in the entire park was this pirate ship.

328
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:28,720
Yes.

329
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,440
Credible.

330
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,200
Yeah, yeah.

331
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:34,760
It's, you know, it's not the size of, it's not the size of sailing ship Columbia.

332
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:38,640
It's not like, like a massive one, uh, uh, you know, and it's, and it's more

333
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:41,200
like cartoony that it's more fantasy land.

334
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,040
That's the vibe it's going to be.

335
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:47,920
However, huge, intricate, what could be more exciting to a kid than the

336
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,360
Disneyland has a pirate ship.

337
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:56,360
Uh, um, so, you know, it, it's, it's just like, it looked very pleasant and fun

338
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:01,360
and cool, uh, uh, you know, just, just aesthetically, um, you know, there's,

339
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,160
there's the deck up top and you can wander around there and sometimes

340
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,680
characters would be up there.

341
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:12,480
Uh, it's like a big network of docs that get you onto it and a bunch of, a bunch

342
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:17,680
of cannons and so they just like really expertly done, like this seems like real.

343
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:23,040
Magical or like the promise of Disneyland as presented by Walton, the

344
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,080
show that you get to go to a fairy tale kingdom and you can walk around a real

345
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:28,120
pirate ship, um, and it's almost weird.

346
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:31,800
They don't have something, I guess they have Donald's boat and various other

347
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:36,840
parks have things sort of like this, but it went away, uh, you know, I think in 82

348
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:41,120
and it was never really replaced by, by an equivalent and I'm sure if kids of

349
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,400
fifties, sixties, seventies must've loved this thing.

350
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:43,800
Yeah.

351
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:47,680
I think this not having, I mean, I understand there's more, they can fit

352
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,680
more rides in without a giant pirate ship, but this does feel like one of the

353
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,720
things I'm like, I wish that was there.

354
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,040
I wish there was a version of that here.

355
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,800
I guess if they told me you'd be losing these three fantasy land rides or

356
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,440
something, I get like, I guess so.

357
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:05,800
But like, but it used to all fit is the thing it moved because this was kind of

358
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:14,160
where Dumbo is now, like kind of right up next to storybook land, Casey Jr.

359
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,320
And I think when it opened, you could just kind of like see right into all that stuff.

360
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,880
There was no real landscaping per se.

361
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,720
Not a lot of trees just sort of right in there.

362
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:24,320
Yeah.

363
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,040
And everything it's cause it's all the same stuff in that area.

364
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,720
It's Dumbo and it's carousel and it's teacups, which we just talked about.

365
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,880
And it's all, that's all just like nudged around.

366
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:32,240
Right.

367
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,800
Why isn't there room now?

368
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:34,520
What happened?

369
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:39,600
That is a good, like, if you took away like storybook boats, could you fit the

370
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,760
pirate ship in there and is it better?

371
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:45,880
Like, I guess this is more of an ended episode conversation, but like, what is

372
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:46,400
it worth?

373
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,880
What is the pirate ship worth?

374
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:52,440
Well, the pirate ship and then the skull rock, which came later.

375
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,520
Skull rock too.

376
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,440
That looks pretty cool.

377
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:54,800
Yeah.

378
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,320
Some of that was not really come up for us before, probably just because we

379
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,760
didn't grow up with it.

380
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:00,120
Yeah.

381
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:04,600
But you know, when we did fake rock final four way back, I don't think that was in

382
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:08,280
the mix and that's early fake rocks.

383
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:08,640
Yeah.

384
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:11,040
And it's just, it's real strong.

385
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,560
It looks cool as hell.

386
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:19,200
I, now I, I, so I think when this opened, it was kind of just in an unthemed pond.

387
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:23,240
That might not have been so, it looked a little bit miniature golf course, but

388
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:27,240
then 1960, they add a bunch of landscaping around it.

389
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,440
Uh, the plant work is wonderful.

390
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:33,520
The rock work is one that just made it like a true lagoon and the biggest piece

391
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:38,400
of that being, uh, the giant skull rock with like water, the waterfall where

392
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:41,480
water was coming out from between its teeth.

393
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,440
Um, this is really neat.

394
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:48,320
This, this does feel like the rare thing where, Oh, it was cooler then.

395
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,440
Like we lost it.

396
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,280
This is what I thought when looking at this again.

397
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:55,280
And even though when this is another thing where I didn't even realize maybe

398
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:59,080
until like 10 or 15 years ago that this was here, because it just, yeah.

399
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:02,960
If you, cause it is one thing where you see like old fantasy land, you go, Oh, I

400
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,040
know why they redid the exteriors here.

401
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,200
These look date, these look dated or whatever.

402
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:10,720
And obviously now it looks really nice, but then you see this and you go, I

403
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,400
don't know, and I don't want to keep, I'm not trying to do this to hurt, hurt you

404
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:19,800
Jason, but would I give up Casey jr to get skull rock and this boat back?

405
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,880
And I kind of wish, but they were all there.

406
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,680
They, they, I understand what you're saying.

407
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,040
I'm just, no, why isn't it a problem?

408
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:31,080
Why is the problem if all the same things fit and there was a pirate ship?

409
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,080
Yeah, maybe it was, it was crowd flow.

410
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:38,400
It was, everything was moved around because this was a big like choke point.

411
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:38,760
Yeah.

412
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:39,200
Okay.

413
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:39,640
Okay.

414
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,000
Okay.

415
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:40,480
Yes.

416
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,280
I think I feel like we noticed that all of those that like teacups and

417
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,800
Dumbo and carousel were all like a foot apart.

418
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:48,440
Yeah, it's more than a choke point.

419
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,160
It's just not as bad as it will always be.

420
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:55,280
It is, but like, I mean, they kind of rebuilt this all in fantasy land at

421
00:18:55,280 --> 00:19:01,600
Disneyland, Paris, because they had the luxury of space, you know, starting

422
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,360
over and redo, yes.

423
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,400
And I, I thought it was really cool there.

424
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,080
I was really excited to see that.

425
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,320
Uh, and, uh, yeah, it's great.

426
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,520
And they, and, and the boats there too.

427
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,080
Correct.

428
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,240
I mean, I was almost most excited about skull rock.

429
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:18,200
Um, and it's good that it's not Paris one is good, but then it is missing a

430
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,040
little bit of like the cartooniness.

431
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:24,920
So it's a little less, it's a little more cool and a little less goofy than

432
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,520
the original Disneyland one.

433
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:31,160
I just really, as I'm now skimming photos of it, I'm so charmed by it.

434
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,280
This was a good rock.

435
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,120
We really should have found a way to keep this rock.

436
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,080
Yeah, I agree.

437
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,600
I, I guess there's, I mean, maybe you could still put it over somewhere.

438
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,760
Matterhorn zone.

439
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:46,080
That's technically fantasy land still, maybe because there is some land over

440
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:50,120
there and I know this because of when we were D 23 was happening and I was trying

441
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,280
to figure out where avatar went.

442
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,600
It's like, there is a little chunk, even if you keep Autopia over there, I'm

443
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,520
like, could they put the boat over there?

444
00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:00,400
Oh, so I'm like, well, because motorboat cruise kind of never

445
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,680
became anything, right?

446
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,960
It does seem like they're, well, I think there was the intention, maybe

447
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:09,120
to try to move it over there, but maybe that's a discussion for the end.

448
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,280
It's just like what happened.

449
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:10,720
Sure.

450
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,880
Um, but let's talk about what you could do on this pirate ship.

451
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:21,120
Um, now were there Peter Pan characters running around it that you could visit?

452
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:25,880
Yes, there were sometimes, but there were also original characters.

453
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:29,440
You could meet, yeah, maybe you'd see Captain Hook up there, but you

454
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,880
might also see Captain Guy.

455
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:37,240
Captain Guy was a peg leg pirate and he'd say hi to you.

456
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,200
He'd say, shiver me timbers, whatever.

457
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:42,400
And like, oh my God, a real peg leg pirate.

458
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,240
How do they do that?

459
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,640
Where do they put the guy's leg?

460
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,400
Does he hide it?

461
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,720
Does he just like put it up in it?

462
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:47,200
No.

463
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:52,440
The answer is they hired a Korean war veteran who actually lost his leg and

464
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:56,320
they made him a peg leg pirate because I found a picture on Reddit.

465
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,800
I think that's Captain Guy.

466
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,280
I think we're looking at Captain Guy.

467
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:03,240
I think, and he appears to be in a beverage dispenser.

468
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:08,520
So he's probably saying like, yeah, do you want bib juice or do you want milk?

469
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,400
I love this.

470
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,800
I like, I flashed to him in the hospital, like what happened?

471
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:16,560
Is it going to be okay?

472
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,960
No, I'm afraid we had to remove the leg.

473
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,880
Oh God, I, what will I do?

474
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:24,360
I, uh, I'll never be able to find a job.

475
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:27,440
No, I, I'd have to agree with that unless somewhere is hiring pirates.

476
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,560
I don't know if Johnny, you have a visitor.

477
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,520
His name is Herber Ryman.

478
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,680
He said he has a job for you.

479
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,760
Putting a team together.

480
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,400
Um, so I love that.

481
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,560
And I love the guy.

482
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:42,960
Yeah.

483
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,200
So is it like, who's it going to be the pirate?

484
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:45,360
I don't know.

485
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,240
This guy, this guy's going to go, what are we going?

486
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,360
I'm not a captain guy.

487
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:52,600
I, I assume captain guy was not like the character was not, the mantle is not taken

488
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,960
up by someone later once he retired.

489
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,040
I don't believe so.

490
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:56,360
Yeah.

491
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:56,840
No.

492
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,520
But it's tech, it's another one of those where it's like, it's probably

493
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,760
technically Disney IP.

494
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:01,840
Uh huh.

495
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,120
Technically Disney owns captain guy.

496
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,880
Captain guy was deep in the background.

497
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:06,080
Yeah.

498
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,560
Once upon a studio.

499
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:08,080
Right.

500
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,200
Really close.

501
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:09,760
Right, right, right.

502
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,480
He's running around.

503
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,280
He's hopping around there.

504
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:11,600
Yeah.

505
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:15,240
Uh, um, you would also meet another character, the character Paco.

506
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:19,960
Paco was a real parrot who you could visit and take pictures with.

507
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:25,880
And the documentation I saw of Paco indicated that he likes to bite things.

508
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,840
Really liked to bite things.

509
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:31,080
And yes, would often bite visitors.

510
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:36,320
They in very like, uh, this, this early Disneyland chaos, where you would.

511
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:41,000
Ride a mule that actually would just lay down and take a shit with you on it.

512
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:44,880
And then you can meet a parrot who is bite happy.

513
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,960
You might start going for your fingers.

514
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,520
Now there's just the Roman cats and they're either too scared or too friendly

515
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,120
to just give you a big bite.

516
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:53,840
Yeah.

517
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,120
Oh, and then the castle was full of what?

518
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,680
Feral cats and fleas.

519
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:58,480
Oh yeah.

520
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,080
There's that room.

521
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,640
That's all fleas is what we figured out.

522
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:03,680
There was a flea room in the sleeping beauty castle.

523
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:07,280
To all the fleas that come to this happy place.

524
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,120
Welcome.

525
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,080
Yeah.

526
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:12,920
So there was, yeah, it was an interesting animal situation in the early days.

527
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:13,320
Yeah.

528
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:13,720
Yeah.

529
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:17,760
And we haven't even, these are all kind of new discoveries to us.

530
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,920
We don't know if there were, uh, locusts.

531
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:22,840
We don't know if there were, yeah, there was just like, uh,

532
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:27,000
before, before they built, they built the Tiki room to kick out a colony of

533
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:32,400
ringworms, just a dense network of ringworm, 10 million of them.

534
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,400
And that was, uh, they attracted them there.

535
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,360
That was an attraction.

536
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,440
The land of the ringworms was an opening day.

537
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,240
We'll get to that one.

538
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,680
You're stuck dealing with the ringworms, Walt.

539
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,320
That's why that orange grove never sold.

540
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:45,880
The big worm colony.

541
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:50,040
You're learning the curse of the ringworm.

542
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:52,480
Real estate agent didn't tell you about that, huh?

543
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,440
He just, he would just say more carefully.

544
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,880
He had a ringworm, just pour some scotch on it and you're fine.

545
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,560
It wasn't a big deal back then.

546
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:03,920
The little man of Disneyland had a tiny, uh, flute and led the

547
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:06,960
ringworms out of, oh yeah, yeah.

548
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,280
He was friends with all the fleas.

549
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,120
I bet the little man.

550
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:09,480
Yeah.

551
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:09,800
I think so.

552
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:09,880
Yeah.

553
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:10,800
He named them all.

554
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:11,200
Yeah.

555
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,040
He was married to one.

556
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,360
Tough to find it.

557
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:19,560
That the toughest thing is finding a wedding veil, uh, for a flea.

558
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:19,720
Yeah.

559
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:19,960
Yeah.

560
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:20,360
Yeah.

561
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:20,760
Uh-huh.

562
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:26,320
Well, if you could call it that, I swear they did more fighting than loving.

563
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,320
Wasn't a happy marriage.

564
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,240
I don't know what you want.

565
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,120
Some marriages are.

566
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,640
Some people are in flea marriages.

567
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,600
The little man is still, are they still married?

568
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,400
Cause he's still around.

569
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,120
His house is still there.

570
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,960
They've been separated for decades.

571
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:38,840
Oh, I didn't know.

572
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:42,120
So they didn't want to go through the whole thing.

573
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,320
He's Catholic.

574
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,040
I mean, I guess a flea, I don't know what a flea's lifespan is, but

575
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:48,280
a little, the little man of Disneyland, I assume is immortal.

576
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:49,760
Seems that way.

577
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,960
Seems that way at least.

578
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:51,200
Yeah.

579
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,520
No, he'll outlive the park.

580
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,520
He'll outlive us all.

581
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:53,960
Yeah.

582
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,480
When there's nothing there and he'll still wandering through a

583
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,640
field of little houses.

584
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:58,400
Yeah.

585
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,120
Uh, uh.

586
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:03,000
It's like that Twilight Zone episode where it's just a destroyed city and

587
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,800
like a man and a woman from separate sides meet and finally lay down their arms.

588
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:10,240
Like Disneyland will be destroyed.

589
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:14,280
Everyone will be dead except this flea and the little man of Disneyland.

590
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,040
And Ducky.

591
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,200
Oh, and Ducky.

592
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,080
The Magic Key Duck.

593
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:17,840
That's another immortal.

594
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,240
Is Ducky also eternal?

595
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:23,440
That's if you watch the Instagram, the 92nd Instagram video, it

596
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,560
seems like he's immortal.

597
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,000
He's been there as soon as long as the park is open.

598
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:31,800
How, how, if I were to try to do that, how would I, does it still exist?

599
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:35,040
It took me, did you post the link?

600
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,080
Yeah, I think we did.

601
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:40,040
I, I took a section of it and I posted it on Instagram or on a, yeah, whatever

602
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:43,520
our social media is, uh, it took me a couple of seconds to figure out again,

603
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:47,320
how to find it when we were going back to the episode because it's confusing

604
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:50,080
and he's not, he is, they're not leaning into Ducky.

605
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,920
No, it doesn't seem like he has not shown up.

606
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,640
I think since the video posted.

607
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:58,600
So he is a, maybe a one-off Magic Key Duck, uh, that if that thing had gone

608
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:04,040
viral, if I roll a gun or, or if, if your slash our episode had gone viral

609
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:04,840
paywall though.

610
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:07,080
So yeah, it's not gonna be tougher to go for.

611
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:07,360
Yeah.

612
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:12,800
Ducky is being, um, Ducky's going to Abu Dhabi, but not for the new park.

613
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:16,560
He's just being shipped in the box that like normal would go.

614
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,760
Yeah, it's a punishment.

615
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,240
Who, who did it?

616
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:20,520
Who is it?

617
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:21,440
Did Garfield do it?

618
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:22,320
Yeah.

619
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,200
Okay.

620
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,720
Well, or the little man did it.

621
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:25,880
Well, yeah.

622
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,720
Who's doing our shipping for Abu Dhabi?

623
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,280
Uh, who's this employee?

624
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,320
Garfield.

625
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:36,480
Goes his last name cat every Monday off.

626
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:38,600
It's a stray.

627
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,720
Why did we agree to that?

628
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,280
Oh, it works out in Sunday.

629
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:44,240
It's weekends or Monday and Tuesday in your mind.

630
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:51,240
12 lasagna meals a day, except for Monday where 15 are shipped to his home.

631
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,640
I did, this is, this is a dense contract.

632
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,000
We never should have hired this guy.

633
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,640
Jason's jealous of that contract.

634
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:03,200
If I, could I, uh, on a regular job interview, uh, now just, just asking,

635
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,760
could I, could I arrange Garfield hours?

636
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:07,160
Cause I've got the Garfield deal, please.

637
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:11,160
People are, you know, they're mad about Ryan Kugler's sinners deal now, but

638
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,400
Jason wants the Garfield deal.

639
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,880
People are going to be very, the business is not going to be happy

640
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,200
when he gets that Garfield deal.

641
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,080
Not everyone wants the Kugler deal.

642
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:20,400
Right.

643
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,200
Some people want the Garfield deal.

644
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:27,000
Um, so yeah, you, you, you climb on a pirate ship, you meet a Korean war

645
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,760
veteran, you get bit by a parrot.

646
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:34,040
So that, that's all you're having fun up top, but what happens in the bottom

647
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:37,160
of the ship, because that's a whole big chunk of real estate.

648
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:42,520
What, what is the, what magical activity awaits for you in the, in the center

649
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,360
of this cartoon pirate ship?

650
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:51,880
Well, a tuna oriented restaurant, a heavily branded chicken of the sea,

651
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:57,080
uh, uh, tuna restaurant, maybe the world's only all tuna restaurant.

652
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,720
I don't, I can't say that today.

653
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:03,000
There must be, there is a thousand niches out there and it could be, uh,

654
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:07,880
that may exist, but at the time places, uh, kind of count, I don't

655
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:10,880
guess now I, now here's, I will say right now, I don't think that counts,

656
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:16,160
but probably because tuna guys, this is what, would you be shocked to know

657
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:23,720
that I myself am not a tuna guy now in poke form in sushi form?

658
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:24,760
Absolutely.

659
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:31,240
But I will say right now I've never taken to or understood the genre of canned

660
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:36,520
tuna with heavy mayo butter, every whatever is happening in this restaurant.

661
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:39,800
I've, I've always, I've been aware of this for a long time and it has always

662
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:43,960
been a nightmare to me that I would, if I, if I woke up in the middle of the

663
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:49,040
night and I'd been transported to, I'm like, you have been taken, a captain

664
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:54,160
guy has taken you hostage and you now live in the chicken of the sea pirate

665
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:59,000
ship and all you have to choose from are the pirate or sorry, the tuna oriented

666
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,800
meals on board this vessel.

667
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,000
Well, there isn't fruit tart with whipped cream.

668
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,600
I would take that every day.

669
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:07,200
I think that would be my every meal.

670
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,520
Yeah, there is my savior.

671
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,920
Scott, what about like a tuna steak?

672
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,440
Like a, like a big cut of tuna.

673
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,800
Uh, yes, depending on the preparation.

674
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:16,040
Okay.

675
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:16,440
Yeah, yeah.

676
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:22,200
Uh, uh, no, I like, you know, like, uh, uh, you know, and like the, like the

677
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,640
raw variety or more, like, you know.

678
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:25,920
Do you do spicy as well?

679
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,640
Do you regular or spicy or just regular?

680
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:31,120
I, I think I try to avoid that mayo because that's that now you're getting

681
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,240
into the kind of unhealthy territory.

682
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:35,880
Well, some, well, no, sometimes it, sometimes it's just the tuna itself

683
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:38,000
as I feel like spicy and it's not with like a little sauce.

684
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:38,480
Really?

685
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,280
But sometimes there's.

686
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,040
Oh, okay.

687
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:40,960
Maybe I'm maybe I'm wrong.

688
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:41,600
I'd be interested in that.

689
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,920
Wait, wait, how did it, but just natural spiciness.

690
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,880
Well, no, it's just a little sriracha mix.

691
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:46,160
Yeah.

692
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:51,520
It's not, I don't think it necessarily means it's the like thicker mayo sauce.

693
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:56,600
It could be like, and I like, I like, I'll do the spicy sauce for the, I just try

694
00:29:56,600 --> 00:30:03,480
to not, uh, you know, uh, if I got options, um, but, uh, you know, all right.

695
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:07,440
Let me, I w I'm just saying, let me be the party to, first of all, saying

696
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:11,400
that like, cause I think sushi tuna is a completely different genre of food

697
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,720
than what we're talking about.

698
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:13,080
For sure.

699
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:13,280
Yeah.

700
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,280
Um, I like that too.

701
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,800
I have never understood it.

702
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:20,000
I guess I see the floor now to you, tuna boys.

703
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:26,040
Uh, if they're okay, what, can you understand why I've never understood

704
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,760
where I've, why I've never gotten that genre?

705
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:28,280
Sure.

706
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:28,720
Yeah.

707
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,080
Yeah.

708
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:29,480
Yeah.

709
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,200
Argument one, it stinks.

710
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,240
I've never, I've always hated this.

711
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:40,040
I don't know if there's a genetic factor with like thinking, I mean, like I, I

712
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:44,240
know, I recognize that tuna smells weird, but it doesn't, doesn't turn me off

713
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:46,520
to eating it for whatever reason.

714
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,640
Why is that said so lascivious Lee?

715
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,760
Doesn't, doesn't turn me off.

716
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:56,000
Cause I'm thinking about, I'm hungry right now and I keep thinking in my head,

717
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,520
get an order from, you know, get Jason's convenient firehouse.

718
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:03,600
I don't, I will, the way he said it, the way he made it seem though, there's a

719
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:06,160
chance that that, that ain't getting here before we're done recording.

720
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:06,720
No, probably not.

721
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:11,360
So, so I, you know, maybe I was just, I'm thinking in my head cause like, I think

722
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:16,400
the best sandwich, if you can get a good tuna melt, that's like my favorite

723
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:20,800
sandwich, I think on the, and I know, I know many, many people love that.

724
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:24,480
It's just never been, so I think I was imagining it and like salivating.

725
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:27,600
And that's why my voice got a bit lascivious, but it was food.

726
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,000
Well, you chose the first sexual lascivious.

727
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:30,880
It doesn't turn me off.

728
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,720
I love a tuna melt, but I love homemade, like canned tuna and mayo.

729
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,960
I have cans of tuna in my house.

730
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:38,680
Yeah, I do too.

731
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:39,680
I do too.

732
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,680
Yeah, I can the tune in my house.

733
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,640
Big jar of mayo.

734
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:52,440
Um, I, uh, took it for school lunch, uh, a lot, usually when I had like, uh, the

735
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:58,440
insulated bag, like not really when I just had a brown paper bag, um, but yeah.

736
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,440
Well, here's my question though.

737
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:03,040
I know that it's like a, in that case, school lunches and can't, and it's like

738
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:07,600
a food that's around and like, uh, cheap and fit, but you guys, you're still, you

739
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,240
consider yourselves excited about it today.

740
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:15,040
I love the idea of tuna melt is so exciting to me right now.

741
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:16,000
I haven't had one in a while.

742
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Cause I don't eat a lot of it.

743
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,680
Cause it's, you know, the mercury, of course.

744
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:19,960
So I don't have a lot of fish.

745
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:22,880
This seems like the kind of thing you should be like, I was on the mercury

746
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,320
Reddit and I freaked me out.

747
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,880
I couldn't sleep because of the mercury Reddit.

748
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:28,680
Like, you probably have like, I mean, you probably can have it a couple

749
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:31,520
times a week, but I don't know, like once a week or whatever is fine.

750
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:34,000
It's like with tuna, because tuna is higher in mercury.

751
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,760
Salmon isn't as high in mercury.

752
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:37,560
It's funny.

753
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,200
I only like canned tuna.

754
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,720
I like it in sushi a little.

755
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,280
I don't like tuna steaks.

756
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:46,600
I found, find them pretty, I don't know that I've even really had a

757
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:51,480
tuna steak, so I'm not sure what day to day that I even would like.

758
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:58,440
Under entrees, you know, I'll offer a chicken tuna salmon.

759
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:02,120
I will put, I will make a little tuna salad and I will sometimes put it

760
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,880
on like macaroni and cheese.

761
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:07,400
I will like kind of, I will use that almost as like the protein

762
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,440
and like a pasta dish.

763
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,320
Oh, I'll just eat it with crackers.

764
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:13,280
Well, I got a couple preparations.

765
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,880
That's, I mean, they sell it as like pre-made.

766
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:20,840
This, this, by the way, this isn't even one of those things where I'm going,

767
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,400
you guys are crazy.

768
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,960
I like, I've always been, I feel like I've always been in the minority.

769
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,000
I even grew up in a house.

770
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:31,160
Like my parents still eat, but I've never, I've just always been like, so

771
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:34,520
grossed out by it, that mac and cheese, that, that's the first thing that's

772
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:35,960
been said that made me feel nauseous.

773
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,760
Lindsay doesn't like it when I do that.

774
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:38,280
Oh, okay.

775
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:38,720
All right.

776
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:39,240
I got, all right.

777
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,880
She's not as big of a fish fan.

778
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:45,920
Now I partly, a lot of people just grab the chunk light tuna.

779
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:50,840
Now that's the really cheapy, but if you buy the solid albacore, which I think

780
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:54,840
chicken of the sea, that's where the name came from solid albacore is kind of a

781
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:58,440
more mild chicken or more mild tuna.

782
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,440
And that's where it's like, Oh, it tastes like chicken.

783
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,720
That's where the name comes from.

784
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,040
Let's talk about the name.

785
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:10,080
Let's talk about a chicken of the sea, that branding, because I think it

786
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:15,000
probably makes all of us flash to newlyweds Nick and Jessica, which then

787
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:20,680
quickly makes us flash to their fantastic variety show work and how much

788
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:23,000
great material came after newlyweds.

789
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:28,520
Uh, but, uh, the, the most infamous moment from that show where she's

790
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,360
confused by what she's eating.

791
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:34,040
She thinks she's eating chicken and points to the can as proof.

792
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,880
And he says, no, that's just the name of it.

793
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:36,800
It's tuna.

794
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:41,480
And she was, you know, derided for this and made to made out to be an idiot for

795
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:46,680
this as time goes on, I'm like, Jessica, I think is right, not right, because

796
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:50,440
she's not right about what she's eating, but this name is stupid.

797
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:51,640
What is the point?

798
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:53,600
Why it is confusing.

799
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:56,480
I don't blame Jessica for being confused by, yeah.

800
00:34:56,840 --> 00:35:02,120
I mean, she, I guess she should know what she's doing and I suppose that's the

801
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:05,600
thing where you would be like, but the, but it being explained to you, like

802
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:09,720
you're stupid, like, no, duh, it's chicken of the sea.

803
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:14,040
Like if you were like, imagine getting that kind of explained to you.

804
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:15,920
Why did they name it that?

805
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:16,800
That's weird.

806
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:17,400
Yeah.

807
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:21,000
I it's a, I think it's a, I think it's a, but I don't find it clever.

808
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:21,840
I think it's stupid.

809
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:27,080
Well, a lot of these companies to sell canned chicken, like chopped up

810
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:29,040
canned chicken similarly.

811
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:33,400
So you can just drain it, dump it in a bowl with mayo and make chicken salad.

812
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:39,080
But if somewhere else did fish of the range, I like fish of the range.

813
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:40,800
Are you an idiot?

814
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:41,640
It's not fish.

815
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,240
It's fish of the range.

816
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,520
I feel like it's a name that's been grandfathered.

817
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:48,160
Like it would never be a new name for a product.

818
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:48,400
Yeah.

819
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,320
Too confusing.

820
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:49,840
Yes.

821
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:53,960
But since it's old, it has old timey penis for sure.

822
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:54,520
Right.

823
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:55,560
Yeah.

824
00:35:55,560 --> 00:36:01,840
We, I grew up and I, we always did like chicken salad, just, or a

825
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:04,360
tuna salad, just with mayo and a lot of pepper.

826
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,400
I know some people like celery.

827
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,520
I don't really like celery.

828
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,560
Ooh, I love celery.

829
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:09,560
Really?

830
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:10,520
Yeah.

831
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:13,400
I know it's pretty common, but that's kind of why I like raw celery.

832
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,440
I'll just eat like celery.

833
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:16,400
You get a bag of celery, you go to car chomp chomp.

834
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:17,240
God, really?

835
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:17,680
Yeah.

836
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:19,240
I'll throw a really at you for that.

837
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,320
I don't even need a ranch.

838
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,880
I will take a little ranch if I want, but I can, I can just.

839
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:23,880
It's like the blandest.

840
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:24,600
Sure.

841
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:24,920
Yeah.

842
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,400
It's like negative calories.

843
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,320
They say I can eat.

844
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:27,960
I can do that.

845
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,760
I can do like plain oatmeal.

846
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,640
Oh, I love plain oatmeal.

847
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:31,920
Yeah.

848
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:35,040
I don't need any, I happy to have brown sugar or something in there, but I don't

849
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,120
need, I can do a plain oatmeal.

850
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:36,760
No problem.

851
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,880
I believe that you, you're all into plain oatmeal.

852
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,360
We're plain oatmeal guys.

853
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,720
But then we're also experimenters.

854
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,000
There's a lot of range, you know?

855
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,200
Scoop of peanut butter, dump scoop of jelly, essentially a peanut butter

856
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,120
jelly and taste sauce in your oatmeal.

857
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,240
Oh, what the fuck?

858
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,840
Taco bell, Caliente sauce.

859
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:57,280
That's not something you've done or would do.

860
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,280
I haven't tried it.

861
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,720
I would try for the show, but.

862
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:00,000
Okay.

863
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:00,800
You're all right.

864
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:06,120
You're not too far from like congee, like porridge, like Chinese porridge.

865
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,440
Oh, I would like to have porridge.

866
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,080
You of course had porridge.

867
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:15,800
So that is often prepared as a savory or grits.

868
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:18,640
Like, yeah, was it, was it a tough transition to move

869
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:21,520
in with your fiance, the comfort of the bears?

870
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,160
The three bears.

871
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:25,720
I, you know, cause your bed there was just right.

872
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:26,440
Porridge with them.

873
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:30,640
I might, yeah, I, yeah, they buy one on Amazon.

874
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,160
They're just going to like, watch this.

875
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,040
They slice it open.

876
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,040
It just puffs up.

877
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:34,640
Yeah.

878
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:35,840
It's vacuum sealed.

879
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:36,480
It's crazy.

880
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:41,720
Scott, were you, a big tuna Mac house at all?

881
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:43,200
Tuna Mac?

882
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:45,080
Tuna Mac, tuna macaroni.

883
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:46,360
No.

884
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:50,200
My family, oh, we would make hot tuna Mac and cold tuna Mac.

885
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:55,600
Now my mom squares cold tuna Mac, which is just tuna salad, basically

886
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,200
tossed with cold macaroni.

887
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,480
She squares that's a picnic side.

888
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,920
I think that's a full meal.

889
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:02,880
Hot tuna Mac.

890
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:05,280
She squares that to picnic side.

891
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,560
No, she squares that is a picnic side.

892
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:11,600
The distinction of picnic side specifically, not just a side dish for a meal.

893
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:12,520
That's what I love.

894
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:13,360
That's why I'm laughing.

895
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,080
I am declaring that meal.

896
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,520
I have the court of Jason is ruled.

897
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:16,080
Bang, bang.

898
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:16,600
That is meal.

899
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:20,400
We would have cold tuna Mac if we were doing hot dogs and burgers.

900
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,920
Did you make the cold tuna Mac?

901
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:22,760
She would make the cold.

902
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:23,000
Okay.

903
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,120
Cause you couldn't buy, I was just wondering like, cause you know, we would

904
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:28,920
buy a macaroni salad from the deli all the time and we love them, but you

905
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,040
would put tuna in it.

906
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:36,640
Just, yeah, just you make a box of, uh, this is like a pantry food.

907
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:38,280
This is like, you make a box.

908
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:38,920
I did that.

909
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,480
That's kind of what I was saying earlier.

910
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:43,080
Macaroni, you run it under cold water and drain it.

911
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:47,560
Then you dump in tuna and mayo and you mix it all around something going on

912
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:49,520
with you, but you're both like lit up.

913
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:50,520
Like I haven't seen you.

914
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:53,840
Yeah, we're tuning our hard core tuna gun.

915
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:56,840
Now hot tuna Mac was a big in the winter.

916
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:59,440
Wait, hold on hot tuna was the side or not cold.

917
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:04,440
No, I had to Mac has a meal because it's hot elbow noodles.

918
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:10,320
Uh, you dump the tuna into a can of cream of mushroom soup and cook it a little

919
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,640
and then dump it in the macaroni and mix it.

920
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:15,920
And here's where I'm, here's what's starting to flash into my head is that

921
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,320
you two are liars.

922
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:20,680
And I'll tell you why I proposed that we do this episode and I said, we'll

923
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:21,880
keep that like an hour, right?

924
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:22,920
You both said yes.

925
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:26,760
You knew perfectly well that you had two hours worth of tuna material.

926
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,080
There's 15 minutes on tuna Mac alone.

927
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,640
Given both the hot and the cold.

928
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:30,960
Yeah.

929
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,480
You both, you both knew you did.

930
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:35,960
You conspired about good cop, bad cop, and you knew that this was going to be

931
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,320
two hours because you're tuning.

932
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:41,080
Well, there's also at the school cafeteria in high school, everyone be

933
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,400
like, Oh, it's tuna day.

934
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:46,200
And I was like, yes, it's tuna day because they would make, it was a

935
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:49,520
pita pocket with tuna with a lot of relish.

936
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:53,520
And I'm like, tuna with a lot of red, this really good tuna, the relish.

937
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:53,960
That's interesting.

938
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:54,760
I've never had that before.

939
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:59,080
Sometimes I still dump a spoonful of relish and it's wonderful.

940
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:02,640
I didn't realize I was going to be so excited until he kind of juiced me up on

941
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,600
the way over here with his excitement.

942
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,120
And I went, Oh yeah, you're right.

943
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:10,480
And then, then I think sometimes it's sometimes he's riding in your car as if

944
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:13,880
he's headed to his execution, as if you're going to shoot him in the back of

945
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:15,320
the head, you're taking them to the farm.

946
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:18,280
A glum Jason staring out the window today.

947
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:20,080
He was banging on all the surfaces.

948
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:20,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

949
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:21,240
Bye bye here.

950
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:23,920
Let's blast some, uh, let's blast some Hagar on the way over.

951
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:24,880
Yeah.

952
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:25,800
He's like, Hey, turn it up.

953
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:26,960
What is this music?

954
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,560
Something I got a spring in my step today.

955
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:37,200
I'm thinking about max hot tuna, max salad kind of day.

956
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:37,680
Sammy.

957
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,440
Hey, he is wide.

958
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:40,760
What?

959
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:41,160
What?

960
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:41,880
Sammy.

961
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:42,240
Okay.

962
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,800
Tom Hanks from Elvis.

963
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,240
He, he's what?

964
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:47,160
Oh, okay.

965
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,600
I guess, I guess I know what you're saying.

966
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:49,040
Okay.

967
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,280
Wait, you might Mike explain it.

968
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,960
If you think you understood it, explain it.

969
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:56,240
Is he, are you talking about when, when Colonel Tom Parker realized that Elvis is

970
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,280
white, he, he's wide.

971
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:58,840
Yeah.

972
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,320
He says that about Elvis.

973
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:02,480
That's why I didn't understand it because you were doing a voice.

974
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,000
So it turned white into what?

975
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:05,360
He's a lot.

976
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:06,160
There's a lot going on.

977
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:06,360
I know.

978
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:08,440
I took me a second to figure out where we were going with it.

979
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:12,240
Is that you could have changed it maybe to like figure, cause sometimes I'll

980
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,480
call it like, it'll be white albacore tuna.

981
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:18,440
So, so maybe Colonel Tom could discover, Oh, that's that albacore is a lot.

982
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:22,320
He's solid one albacore, not chocolate.

983
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:23,680
Yeah, there we go.

984
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:24,720
That's a good punch up, right?

985
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:27,120
Somebody is hearing tuna on the radio.

986
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:27,640
What's worse?

987
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:30,920
Look, I don't, that's a whole nother issue.

988
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:35,480
I just wanted to understand what Taylor more to the, to see me.

989
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:37,680
He's, he's the red rock.

990
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:38,440
Yeah.

991
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:39,040
Oh, he's a red.

992
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,200
That would be good.

993
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:41,880
Well, he's red.

994
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:44,120
I don't think I would have to hang out.

995
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:45,480
No one would have gotten that either.

996
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,040
He's red.

997
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:48,120
He's a red.

998
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:51,680
You hear that voice, you know that that is, but then isn't, wait, you're

999
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:55,840
doing like a Southern voice, but that, but Colonel Tom Parker was that weird.

1000
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:58,200
Like he was like Dutch or something.

1001
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:01,520
Look, if you're going to get in the accuracy issue also, that's too, we

1002
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,480
don't have time for that.

1003
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:02,800
Yeah.

1004
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,280
I think he's doing kind of a crazy.

1005
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:05,680
There is Southern in it.

1006
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:08,240
That voice is kind of a, unplaceable.

1007
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:09,760
Um, anyway.

1008
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:10,320
All right.

1009
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:12,360
What other genres do we need to do?

1010
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:14,240
The tuna boys need to, I don't know.

1011
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,560
I think I hit all my tuna.

1012
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:18,440
I got, yeah, I just, I really, I haven't had to know.

1013
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:20,160
I really actually haven't had it in a couple of months.

1014
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,040
Now that I think about it.

1015
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,880
But you have, you have in your house, but you haven't, you

1016
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:25,120
haven't cracked into those cans.

1017
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:26,720
You're saving them for nice occasions.

1018
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:27,360
Yeah.

1019
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:32,240
In the same way that I still have Scotty Pippen's bourbon digits sitting

1020
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:37,360
on my counter on open, it's very valuable.

1021
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:37,960
Yes.

1022
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:38,880
I think that's right.

1023
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,920
I don't know that he's actually still, I don't know that they're

1024
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:43,280
producing his, his bourbon anymore.

1025
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:43,840
He's moved.

1026
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:46,520
He's moved on to his, to his tuna brand, his can tuna brand.

1027
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:49,800
God, I wish he's certainly very involved in crypto and it's the most,

1028
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:52,880
some of the most fascinating, the accounts on the internet and

1029
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,320
he is whoever's posting for him.

1030
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:59,560
Maybe it's him is posting motivational speaking and crypto stuff like so much,

1031
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:03,080
so often posting and it's really fascinating.

1032
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:07,000
And I used to do those fun ads where he like dunked a sandwich.

1033
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,400
Now he's doing, now he's just talking about crypto.

1034
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:10,280
It's all crypto.

1035
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:14,000
He had a popcorn that he had endorsed a year or two, two that I was following.

1036
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:18,640
And I don't know if that's still in play, but it's just, it's that again,

1037
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:20,000
that's too long of a tangent.

1038
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:22,600
He posts weird AI pictures of himself.

1039
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:26,440
It's really, it's all Anthony, other than UFOs, it's all Anthony Geo.

1040
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:29,160
And I text about is Scotty Pippen's Twitter.

1041
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:30,960
Do you think it is a Cal God hat?

1042
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:35,560
UFOs, 60% UFOs, 40% Scotty Pippen's AI art.

1043
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:39,520
Scotty Pippen's AI art and the guy who just be like rise it, like the rise and

1044
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:45,600
grind sort of type of posting and then like air drops for crypto tokens.

1045
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:50,120
Now Mike and Jason's texts after this, 90% tuna.

1046
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:53,560
I'm literally trying to figure out where I'm going to get a tuna melt tonight.

1047
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:55,280
Cause I need to eat one for dinner.

1048
00:43:55,800 --> 00:44:00,320
Like, I'm like, where, what I, what I'd recommend to you is to, uh, postmates

1049
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:02,720
it from the most inconvenient place possible.

1050
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:08,000
Does you just, does anyone else, I guess, like a coral house.

1051
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:08,440
Yes.

1052
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:09,320
I should go to a diner.

1053
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:09,560
Right.

1054
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:12,320
I should go to some sort of a diner type place.

1055
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:14,760
I should go to a diner on the way home and get a tuna melt.

1056
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:15,200
Okay.

1057
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:15,600
Okay.

1058
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:16,080
All right.

1059
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:19,040
And then you get, and then you'll have a lot to say you get to now is that now

1060
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:23,080
what kind of chunks we talking, what do we think was the base of it?

1061
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:25,960
And do we think that base would have made a good hot Mac or would have been

1062
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:29,520
more of a cold Mac, more of a picnic side is what it would have been.

1063
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:32,880
Cook outside.

1064
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:33,840
Well, I just like that.

1065
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:36,400
But I would take that for a school lunch for sure.

1066
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:40,520
My mom made a big batch cold tuna Mac or hot tuna Mac, which is also good cold.

1067
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:43,000
Uh, I would take the same thing.

1068
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,320
It's just the heat is different.

1069
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,040
You just said hot tuna Mac is also good cold.

1070
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:48,200
Wouldn't it be just the cold?

1071
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:49,600
No, it's the cream of mushroom.

1072
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:50,920
Like, oh, it's a little different.

1073
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:51,520
Excuse me.

1074
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:52,120
Excuse me.

1075
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:53,120
You did say that.

1076
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:53,600
I'm sorry.

1077
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:58,040
Well, now that everyone's salivating, now that everyone's nice and not turned off,

1078
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:01,560
we can read what they have, what you could buy at this.

1079
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:01,920
Yeah.

1080
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:05,880
Well, I guess first question is like, so this would have been paradise for you.

1081
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:06,560
Tuna guy.

1082
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:08,640
Oh, I would have gotten off this shit.

1083
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:12,920
I would have killed for a simple triangle cut, like chicken salad sandwich in

1084
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:15,320
Disneyland killed for it.

1085
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:18,360
I would have killed for like, just a, I like just a very plain

1086
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:20,280
sandwich sometimes like.

1087
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:24,960
So you're saying like now these days you would kill or you wouldn't kill today.

1088
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:26,760
Just like,

1089
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:28,360
this guy just wants to kill.

1090
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:31,640
He's looking for any, he's got, yeah, he's got murder on his mind.

1091
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:34,760
The only thing that calms me is canned tuna fish.

1092
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:43,000
I feel like this explains psychologically some of the dynamics that you guys are

1093
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:46,240
not only tuna guys, you are hardcore tuna guy.

1094
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:49,920
I had no idea when I stepped into the room and the fact that things do it, that

1095
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:55,160
I do end up being a divisive corner of this triangle is the explanation always

1096
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:57,000
there in the tuna affection.

1097
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:57,840
Is that it?

1098
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:01,200
I don't know that we've ever, this is where, this is where the personalities

1099
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:03,200
diverge when we were eight years old.

1100
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:08,960
I remember when we were at like a pizza restaurant or two with like large menus

1101
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:13,040
and it was like personal pan, you got your own and blanks like, Oh, this one

1102
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:17,360
is tuna, I'm going to get bossa nova and sunset had had a tuna pizza many years

1103
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:22,920
ago that I had and I may have been high while I ate it and this is like 15 years.

1104
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:23,840
I think the guy was high.

1105
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:25,080
You thought it up.

1106
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:30,440
We went into, we, my friend was in town.

1107
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:37,400
We went to a guy's house who's now kind of famous is on a TV and we got weed from

1108
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:40,880
him because my friend wanted it and then we got high.

1109
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:41,760
I didn't like it.

1110
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:42,840
It made me feel weird.

1111
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:47,760
We went over to bossa nova on sunset Boulevard and we had, I had a tuna

1112
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:49,240
pizza, which was delicious.

1113
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:51,360
I ate maybe all of it in one sitting.

1114
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:52,200
I see.

1115
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:56,880
I have a memory one time when I was studying abroad in Germany for a party,

1116
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:58,560
they brought over, Hey pizza.

1117
00:46:58,560 --> 00:46:58,880
Whoa.

1118
00:46:58,880 --> 00:46:59,640
Pizza's here.

1119
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:01,400
It was tuna pizza.

1120
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:05,000
I, and most of the people around me recoiled.

1121
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:08,240
I already found this to be the grossest thing they've ever seen.

1122
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:09,920
Are you anti-anchovy?

1123
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,360
Not necessarily, but I just think it's.

1124
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:15,360
Extremely rare that I've ever had question.

1125
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:22,280
What's everyone's opinion on canned fish, sardines, anchovies, oysters.

1126
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:24,400
I don't recall ever having sardines.

1127
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:25,640
I have no, no, I can say that firmly.

1128
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:30,000
I've never had sardines are weird because it's just, it looks like a little fish.

1129
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:33,040
So it's a little weird to eat it right out of the can, but they are good.

1130
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:34,520
And I haven't had them in years, but.

1131
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:35,600
Oh, I loved it.

1132
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:39,120
I think I read a profile of Simon rich once and he was like, Oh, a lot of

1133
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:43,120
times for lunch, I'll eat like sardines on rye with brown mustard.

1134
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:44,640
And I had all that in the house.

1135
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:46,160
I was like, yeah, it is good.

1136
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:46,920
And you liked it.

1137
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:48,440
It's good to see that you were eating the corpse.

1138
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:49,280
Sure.

1139
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:50,800
I eat their spine.

1140
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:54,240
The things you've forgotten, but then that you remember that Simon

1141
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:56,440
rich likes to eat canned sardines.

1142
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:57,040
It's good.

1143
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,440
Omega threes.

1144
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:00,480
It usually comes in olive oil.

1145
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:00,680
Yeah.

1146
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:02,680
That's why his writing is so sharp.

1147
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:06,800
Threes go to the brain.

1148
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:07,800
It is good for your brain.

1149
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:08,600
Okay.

1150
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:12,200
Let's let's read what they would have had at your parent.

1151
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:12,480
Yes.

1152
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:13,560
Guy tuna guys.

1153
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:14,200
Come on.

1154
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:15,320
Take a deep breath.

1155
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:16,040
Tuna guys.

1156
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:18,800
You're shaking.

1157
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:20,360
You're jostling the microphones.

1158
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:20,840
Yeah.

1159
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:21,840
Okay.

1160
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:25,480
So when you walked in here, you would have had your choice of many delicious

1161
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:28,680
sounding items, tuna, clipper salad.

1162
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:29,960
Do we know what that is?

1163
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:31,160
What is clipper about?

1164
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:34,360
Uh, I, uh, Jim Hill caught this too.

1165
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:37,880
A tuna boat salad and then a tuna clipper salad.

1166
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:39,880
A clipper is a slightly bigger boat.

1167
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:41,640
Clippers like a sailboat.

1168
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:42,720
Oh, right.

1169
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:42,960
Right.

1170
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:43,720
I see.

1171
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:43,960
Okay.

1172
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:45,240
So this is one of the things.

1173
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:45,360
Yeah.

1174
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:47,240
You would get a big boat of tuna.

1175
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:47,640
Right.

1176
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:49,760
Uh, is what that was there.

1177
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:51,760
Like this was in the pre Instagram days.

1178
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:52,160
Yeah.

1179
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:55,560
Why even bother to make food look interesting when it wasn't, you couldn't

1180
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:58,800
Instagram about it when you couldn't go viral, like those crazy blacktap shakes.

1181
00:48:59,120 --> 00:48:59,800
Yeah, I know.

1182
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:04,240
They should replace blacktap with a place that sells a tuna salad in a boat.

1183
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:06,240
Well, well, no, same deal.

1184
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:09,720
It's still like wild milkshakes, but get that cake out of here.

1185
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:14,600
Give me a big loaf of tuna right on top of that crazy, crazy shake with a big

1186
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:20,400
thing of tuna does that genuine because I, as I just said it, I sort of was gagging

1187
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:21,840
while the words were coming out of my mouth.

1188
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:25,280
I do believe that both of you would eat tuna milkshakes.

1189
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:27,160
Oh, no, don't be gross.

1190
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:31,680
But if you put a scoop of cottage cheese next to some tuna, I wouldn't be mad at

1191
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:32,080
you.

1192
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:37,920
The devil is grinning at his face when he said that to me.

1193
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:39,640
He was being like funless.

1194
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:41,960
I might say thank you, I'm not mad at all.

1195
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:42,720
Yeah.

1196
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:47,480
President Nixon wasn't, I don't think he was in the wrong to eat a scoop of cottage

1197
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:49,000
cheese and pineapple every day.

1198
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:52,120
I bought cottage cheese for the first time in years of the last week, actually.

1199
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:55,920
Let's just establish he knows Simon Rich's go-to meal and President Nixon's go-to

1200
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:56,160
meal.

1201
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:57,120
Nixon would have a scoop of cottage cheese.

1202
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:59,960
I believe that was his breakfast, cottage cheese and pineapple.

1203
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:01,920
That one's kind of a no-name.

1204
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:03,480
I don't like cottage cheese either.

1205
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:06,360
Yeah, I haven't had it for many years, but I bought it because my mom used to make

1206
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:09,880
us cottage cheese and yogurt and you would mix the two together.

1207
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,000
Wait, why?

1208
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:12,520
Yeah, they're pretty close.

1209
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:13,480
What do you mean?

1210
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:15,440
Well, that's a lot of dairy.

1211
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:16,840
Oh, it's certainly a lot of dairy.

1212
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:17,240
Yeah.

1213
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:19,640
But that for whatever reason, that was the way she would, I would get that

1214
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:22,480
delivered, that it would be with yogurt in it.

1215
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:28,000
So if the milkshake was cottage cheese, it's in a milkshake glass, but it's a

1216
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,000
bunch of cottage cheese.

1217
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,360
I would try a big tuna block on top.

1218
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:33,960
That doesn't seem so appealing to me.

1219
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:40,560
Now, if you were to take hot tuna mac or hot tuna salad and put it in a sort of

1220
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:45,160
milkshake container with some sort of fun dressing on the top and you would walk

1221
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:52,080
around sipping the hot tuna salad or mac or you would walk around a theme park

1222
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:56,560
with a hot tuna mac or in like in one of the fun cones, like in the, in Isla

1223
00:50:56,560 --> 00:51:01,600
Burke or in Cozy Cone in Cars Land, you get a little tuna salad in one of those.

1224
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:02,320
That would be not bad.

1225
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:04,120
I would have to break off from the group.

1226
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:08,240
If you ever did, if this was ever, if there was a cone of tuna around at a theme

1227
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:11,360
park, I would have to go be somewhere else.

1228
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:16,600
Well, Mike and I would never both get that because we'd be too busy each

1229
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:19,280
holding a cone of tuna and then holding hands.

1230
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:20,640
We wouldn't be able to eat it.

1231
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:22,400
Oh, we would be intertwining our arms.

1232
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:24,360
We'd be eating each other's wedding bouquets like this.

1233
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:28,000
It would be like the thing where your arms, with champagne flutes.

1234
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,200
Sharing the champagne.

1235
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:34,240
We'd share the different Cozy Cone meats at Cars Land or Cozy Cone,

1236
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:35,120
whatever it's called.

1237
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:35,600
I forget.

1238
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:36,200
Oh man.

1239
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:40,480
And then, okay, now you have this, this phrase, which genuinely creeps me out.

1240
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:42,880
Tuna dietetic salad.

1241
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,440
I'm like, what is dietetic?

1242
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:45,840
Yeah.

1243
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:48,640
I guess dietetic, I mean, that's a word that is still around.

1244
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:50,640
It's kind of like the science of diet.

1245
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:50,920
Right.

1246
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:51,000
Right.

1247
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,760
It's just not a word that we really use anymore.

1248
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:54,160
It's very clinical.

1249
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:56,920
But that feels like, yeah, that feels like a word that was invented in the fifties is

1250
00:51:56,920 --> 00:52:01,800
it like, okay, the people who think that diets are a good idea, they want a name.

1251
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:05,840
Let's give them a name and let's make it, let's make it sure that it's a name

1252
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:07,320
that shows that they're nuts.

1253
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:10,160
Well, that's why that's people away from them.

1254
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:13,600
Like the story is about the invention of the Cobb salad.

1255
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:19,880
It was like, oh, it's a bunch of stuff, but it's all chopped very finely because

1256
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:23,880
I don't know, an actress or the owner's wife, there's different stories.

1257
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:28,760
Had digestion issues and they're like, here, this will go down good.

1258
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:35,280
But it was just ham and tomatoes, egg, it like just chopped up a bunch.

1259
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:35,640
Okay.

1260
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:39,840
Oh, so the chopping was, it was, so your stomach didn't have to work as hard to

1261
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:40,560
digest it.

1262
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:47,080
Um, I, but, but so dietetic tuna just means like a little bit less of all the stuff.

1263
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:47,600
Right.

1264
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:49,960
Less mayo, less, uh,

1265
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:55,120
salads back in the day were mostly buttermilk based dressings like mayonnaise.

1266
00:52:56,480 --> 00:53:02,880
Well, this, yeah, that's what I assume that 1955 tuna dietetic salad is just

1267
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:08,840
what was probably like just halfway to how we eat tuna today.

1268
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:09,200
Yeah.

1269
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:09,760
You know what I mean?

1270
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:14,280
Like it was probably like, oh, we now would consider a normal way to prepare it.

1271
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:19,120
Tuna dietetic salad kind of got, and whatever the hell the boat was, I don't

1272
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:20,560
even want to know what that boat was like.

1273
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:22,120
I don't know why I don't want to know what it smells like.

1274
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:25,600
This is, it's all been on my mind because as somebody who does not like the smell

1275
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:31,840
of tuna and then I think about like the craziness of 1955 Disneyland where, and

1276
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:34,920
I've said some of this on the show before, but that we're like, everything's

1277
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:35,880
melting down.

1278
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:39,800
There's like, maybe the water machines aren't working or the bathrooms aren't

1279
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:44,040
working and women are melting into the concrete and then all the food that's

1280
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:46,720
available is like candied veal.

1281
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:47,080
Yeah.

1282
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:50,880
Everything's like candied veal, coffee, and cigars.

1283
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:54,800
That is the smell of hot July Disneyland upon opening.

1284
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:56,440
I need a refuse from this.

1285
00:53:57,240 --> 00:53:58,240
Honey glazed veal.

1286
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:02,920
That's the children's menu.

1287
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:04,720
Like Junior needs to eat something.

1288
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:06,960
Oh, finally some honey glazed veal.

1289
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,360
I need to clear my palate.

1290
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:10,400
Hand me a cigarette.

1291
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:11,800
Ooh.

1292
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:17,400
Um, but so yeah, like I, I need like, I just need some refuge from this.

1293
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:19,520
How about like, is there anywhere I can find some shade?

1294
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:20,360
Ah, here we go.

1295
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:21,600
This is a pirate ship.

1296
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:24,480
Oh, the pirate ship is full of tuna.

1297
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:26,000
It is loaded up with tuna.

1298
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:26,480
Yeah.

1299
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:29,320
It's been with no air conditioning and it's been heating up.

1300
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:33,000
This is a tuna furnace disguised as a pirate ship.

1301
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:35,520
I always found the notion of this so gross.

1302
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:36,840
The smell of air.

1303
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:40,000
You're in coffee with a boat of tuna.

1304
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:40,560
Tuna.

1305
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:43,000
That is, that truly makes me nauseous.

1306
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:45,320
And you guys handle coffee in a tuna boat.

1307
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:47,800
Eating or smelling how everybody doing it.

1308
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:47,960
Eating it.

1309
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:48,960
Yes.

1310
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:49,840
Back and forthing it.

1311
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:50,480
Please.

1312
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:51,080
Of course.

1313
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:55,760
Uh, I am interested because like just the way, you know, air circulation was in

1314
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:58,280
buildings back then, what the smell was.

1315
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:00,440
It might've been awful.

1316
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:03,640
Um, but I think it attracted the cats.

1317
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:09,640
Well, they would just, you know, when they, the, cause shrimp cocktail was also on

1318
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:12,080
the menu and they sold canned shrimp.

1319
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:15,560
Um, uh, you're making a shrimp cocktail.

1320
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:19,480
They're making the cocktail sauce fresh either to dab a little of that, or you

1321
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:23,640
get some of the worser out as you dab and might burn a little, but it'll get the

1322
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:24,560
smells away.

1323
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:26,040
Why are you, why are we dabbing?

1324
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:28,840
I think you were, you were gesturing towards your nostril.

1325
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:31,680
Like, it looked like you were like doing a cocaine gesture.

1326
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:31,920
Yeah.

1327
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:32,640
That's what it was.

1328
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:32,800
Yeah.

1329
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:37,000
No, I mean, like you're spreading it under your nose cause it's like, well, that

1330
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:40,240
might sting a little, but it smells better than that.

1331
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:45,200
So the employees, the employees, you're saying, yeah, if you had to work there and

1332
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:49,400
you didn't like the smell, just every morning put horseradish under your nostrils.

1333
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:53,360
That's what like a cop has to do when he goes to like a murder scene or something

1334
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:55,360
to like prevent, but it's the same thing.

1335
00:55:55,360 --> 00:56:00,040
If you worked in the tuna restaurant at Disneyland in 1955, just dip your nose

1336
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:00,960
in the horseradish.

1337
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:01,280
Right.

1338
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:03,320
Scoop out that part, make sure the customer.

1339
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:04,480
You can have a little cocktail sauce on your tongue.

1340
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:06,720
Maybe that'll get a little stuffy.

1341
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:07,840
Have you ever done that?

1342
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:09,160
No, no.

1343
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:09,640
All right.

1344
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:11,760
I didn't think so, but I wondered.

1345
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:12,440
Yeah.

1346
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:14,320
You were, you were saying it as if from experience.

1347
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:14,600
Yeah.

1348
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:16,800
Just, this is what you do.

1349
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:21,400
You know, I'm just saying I saw on the menu shrimp cocktail and I'm like, well,

1350
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:24,160
that's cocktail sauce can be very potent.

1351
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:24,760
Yeah.

1352
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:26,960
Depending on how you make it or the manufacturer.

1353
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:30,760
And when it was unregulated, it would make you blind.

1354
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:32,720
Are we shrimp fans?

1355
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:33,840
Are we shrimp cocktail fans?

1356
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:34,880
Yeah, I'm totally fine with shrimp.

1357
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:35,120
Shrimp.

1358
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:35,400
Good.

1359
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:35,760
Okay.

1360
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:36,880
It doesn't stink to me.

1361
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:43,920
Oh, I got very ill as a child, young child when I ate shrimp.

1362
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:48,560
So I don't, that my family was just like, yeah, he's probably allergic to shrimp.

1363
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:50,520
So I just have not eaten shrimp.

1364
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:51,680
Is that what, is that a shellfish?

1365
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:56,120
But I eat plenty of shellfish, so I've just never tried shrimp.

1366
00:56:56,120 --> 00:56:58,440
So you're in a situation like I am with the corn dog.

1367
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:02,120
I haven't had corn dogs since I was four years old because I got sick after eating

1368
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:07,320
one, even though technically what I ate at FanFest was probably a corn dog.

1369
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,080
I was like, no, that wasn't a corn dog.

1370
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:09,680
You don't think so?

1371
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:10,280
No, I don't think so.

1372
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:12,360
Yeah, that was more of the Korean style.

1373
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:13,080
Oh yeah, I guess you're right.

1374
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:15,960
Brother, I got corn dogs in the freezer right now.

1375
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:19,640
You come on in, you come on into the homestead.

1376
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:21,440
I'll microwave you corn dogs at home.

1377
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:23,120
Without children.

1378
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:26,600
That is, corn dogs at home is a little wild, but I don't want to judge.

1379
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:29,120
I think if I'm going back to corn dog, I'm going.

1380
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:31,400
My mom likes to send us groceries sometimes.

1381
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:33,480
So sometimes you never know what you're getting.

1382
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:35,000
And thanks mom.

1383
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:36,440
Uncrustables.

1384
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:37,120
Yay.

1385
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:37,960
Thanks mom.

1386
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:43,480
Scott, we always have Uncrustables in the house.

1387
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:46,520
She loves Uncrustables and she got me into them too.

1388
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:49,360
Uncrustables.

1389
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:50,400
That is very funny.

1390
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:53,240
She had a bad headache or a toothache the other day.

1391
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:56,000
And I was like, Oh, maybe I'll just have some peanut butter toast.

1392
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,400
And she's like, Oh, I'll go grab.

1393
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:58,120
I was like, you know what?

1394
00:57:58,120 --> 00:57:59,680
Just toss me an Uncrustable.

1395
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:01,240
Don't, don't go through it.

1396
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:02,040
Don't make it.

1397
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:06,040
It's easier, you know, just toss me an Uncrustable.

1398
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:07,840
Just toss me an Uncrustable.

1399
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:10,840
Um, I will, I will eat a corn dog at Disneyland.

1400
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:12,720
I haven't decided when, but I will do it.

1401
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:13,640
And we will talk about it.

1402
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:14,960
No one's making me do it.

1403
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:15,600
That's good.

1404
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:16,120
I will.

1405
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:17,400
Jason wants to make me.

1406
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:19,200
Yeah, I do want to make you.

1407
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:19,520
Yeah.

1408
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:20,160
And you know what?

1409
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:22,320
Opt for the ketchup over mustard.

1410
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:25,800
Cause the sweetness matches the sweetness of the cornbread.

1411
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:26,720
It's delicious.

1412
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:30,280
This is, I've never seen you two more excited and I've never seen you more

1413
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:32,920
sexual than this, than this food discussion.

1414
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:34,760
We're both using tones.

1415
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:38,000
Well, I've never seen you.

1416
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,240
I've just heard about it.

1417
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:40,160
Yeah.

1418
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:42,080
We've heard all heard the tales.

1419
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:45,920
Um, we haven't even gotten to the best entree.

1420
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:47,320
Let's get to the best entree.

1421
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:49,440
Well, you, you, you take the reins.

1422
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:52,560
Well, I'll say this cause I know more about it.

1423
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:56,280
Cause I watched someone make it, uh, it, the tuna burger.

1424
00:58:56,880 --> 00:59:01,360
He's in the, one of the Disneyland like Walt's recipes guidebook.

1425
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:06,960
And I watched, uh, Jim Hilton link to a YouTube account, making it

1426
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:08,960
called the unofficial Disney guide.

1427
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:14,960
I was kind of surprised by what it ended up being, which is they just made

1428
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:20,000
tuna salad and then they made like who made special sauce, which I used to do

1429
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:24,880
when I was a kid, which you just mix mayo and ketchup, and then they spread

1430
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:26,400
that on a seeded roll.

1431
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:28,320
That's what they called salsa in 1955.

1432
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:29,120
Yeah.

1433
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:31,480
Uh, you spread that on a seasoned roll.

1434
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:35,400
Uh, you dump in the tuna salad and like three pickles.

1435
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:38,640
Then you put the top bun on and then you bake it.

1436
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:42,560
And they're like, yeah, it's, I mean, it's pretty good.

1437
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:45,080
It's just kind of like you warmed a tuna sandwich.

1438
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:47,760
This sounds and looks so bad to me.

1439
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:50,560
I have no desire.

1440
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:55,760
I thought he was going to make tuna salad, sculpt it into patties and

1441
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:58,960
then put it in a pan and fry it.

1442
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:06,840
I like, um, but no, I think it was just like, Oh, it just had the clipper.

1443
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:12,320
You know, the, the pirate ship kitchen was probably just like a glorified

1444
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:15,480
microwave and a bunch of fridges and freezers.

1445
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:16,640
I think so.

1446
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:17,120
Yeah.

1447
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:22,760
Uh, um, well, the, that just seems like kind of, it's just going to get squishy

1448
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:23,240
fast.

1449
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:24,720
That doesn't seem good to me at all.

1450
01:00:24,760 --> 01:00:25,120
Yeah.

1451
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:29,320
Uh, um, but the one, and this is what's always haunted me about when you just,

1452
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:32,920
you know, I'll introduce it the way that I, you know, cause I think you guys

1453
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:36,320
probably also, as I do end up on this site, yester land, which is great with

1454
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:42,120
tracking, you know, there's a lot of great old photos of defunct attractions

1455
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:43,560
and kind of take you through the history of them.

1456
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:45,640
Always been a very well done website for many years.

1457
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:49,680
Um, but they, they, but they kind of like pitch you the places as if, you

1458
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:51,880
know, from a different narrative voice than theirs.

1459
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:54,400
And I, I copy and pasted this.

1460
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:57,400
This is the way yesterland gets the end of this place.

1461
01:00:57,640 --> 01:01:01,880
Are you hungry for a tuna sandwich, a tuna burger or a hot tuna pie?

1462
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:04,600
No, I am not.

1463
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:07,280
I'm not hungry for a hot tuna pie.

1464
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:10,520
It sounds awful to me, but tuna guys weigh in.

1465
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:11,360
I don't know what now.

1466
01:01:11,360 --> 01:01:14,160
I don't know what one is, but I'm recoiling from the phrase.

1467
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:19,080
Well, I think because like a chicken pot pie, I bet it's similar to that.

1468
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:25,480
So if it's literally just like breading and tuna, that's fine.

1469
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:28,800
I'm not saying I'm like so excited about that version of tuna, but

1470
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:31,960
further on the menu is it just says tuna pie pastry shell.

1471
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:32,640
Yeah.

1472
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:34,040
Like, okay, I guess so.

1473
01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:36,080
I know that meat goes with pastry.

1474
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:36,680
Yeah.

1475
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:41,880
So I'm, I'm assuming maybe it was just tuna salad in a little weirder

1476
01:01:42,040 --> 01:01:46,040
because we've, we've, you know, there are places, you know, it's almost

1477
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:47,680
in the empanada family or something.

1478
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:49,000
Yeah, it is plenty of places.

1479
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:54,120
We're red meat or chicken go with more of pastry shell kind of, but like

1480
01:01:54,120 --> 01:01:59,480
this has not taken culturally here in 2025, I think you gotta, you gotta

1481
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:03,360
look hard and hard far and wide to find somewhere that makes tuna pie.

1482
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:07,880
Well, it's like, it's like a pasty, you know, it's a hand pie probably.

1483
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:09,920
And yeah, Mike, I think is right.

1484
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:11,800
Like it is like chicken pot pie.

1485
01:02:11,840 --> 01:02:16,000
And I think we certainly ate our fair share of hamburger helper

1486
01:02:16,040 --> 01:02:21,080
and tuna helper growing up, which was just, you bought the box of seasoning

1487
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:24,040
and pasta and then you tossed in the meat.

1488
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:27,560
I'm going to guess that you ate more than your fair share of tuna helper.

1489
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:30,280
Oh, I feel very unfair.

1490
01:02:30,520 --> 01:02:36,320
Uh, I, but if you use a milder tuna with cream sauce, it's good.

1491
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:41,080
I'm looking up tuna pie Burbank and I'm going to see if there's a place

1492
01:02:41,080 --> 01:02:43,280
you can get it, get that door.

1493
01:02:43,480 --> 01:02:47,400
There's a good papoosa place, uh, on victory.

1494
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:48,720
Maybe they have a tuna one.

1495
01:02:48,760 --> 01:02:49,120
I don't know.

1496
01:02:49,120 --> 01:02:52,840
Maybe you can order a papoosa, scrape out what's in it and put

1497
01:02:52,840 --> 01:02:54,120
a bunch of canned tuna in there.

1498
01:02:54,120 --> 01:02:54,520
Okay.

1499
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:54,840
Yeah.

1500
01:02:54,840 --> 01:02:55,640
Re-seal it.

1501
01:02:55,640 --> 01:02:59,240
Just like there's an epinada place, seal it back up like an envelope.

1502
01:02:59,240 --> 01:03:00,480
World's world.

1503
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:01,960
Epinada has been there forever.

1504
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:06,320
Yeah, I know what you're, what you're describing is good sounding.

1505
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:09,080
You're acting as if that is, uh, related.

1506
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:12,720
I wear it or we're not going to find anywhere in Burbank with a tuna pie.

1507
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:15,840
I don't think so, but I mean, I'll, I'll keep looking.

1508
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:19,000
I don't think there's not an, there's not an obvious answer when you do a Google.

1509
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:20,400
But you must be dying for it.

1510
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:23,160
And that, like, if you could leave here and know that within five minutes,

1511
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:28,040
it would be, I, I would prefer the tuna melt still, but I would, I would be

1512
01:03:28,040 --> 01:03:29,200
interested in trying the tuna pie.

1513
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:33,240
What is, uh, Sarah Connor say at the end of T two, three to eight, the battle

1514
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:40,360
continues and that's Mike trying to find a tuna pie, the battle didn't

1515
01:03:40,360 --> 01:03:42,040
last very long of me looking it up.

1516
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:43,640
But you certainly will continue.

1517
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:46,720
You were, I was defeated today, but tomorrow is another day.

1518
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:48,040
I will fight on.

1519
01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:49,720
I will eat tuna pie.

1520
01:03:49,720 --> 01:03:52,080
I will eat as hot as possible.

1521
01:03:52,080 --> 01:03:53,400
That's also hot.

1522
01:03:53,560 --> 01:03:54,160
And this was on it.

1523
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:56,400
This is another, that, that this I don't like.

1524
01:03:56,440 --> 01:03:58,600
And then there was also, there's a site called Dave land.

1525
01:03:58,600 --> 01:04:01,800
That also has a lot of great old photos, especially of this really, really good

1526
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:03,040
for photos of this pirate ship.

1527
01:04:03,320 --> 01:04:07,080
Uh, but then, you know, mixed with, uh, here's like firsthand accounts of

1528
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:08,720
somebody who are memories of this place.

1529
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:11,840
And this, this account of somebody describing going there and saying, I

1530
01:04:11,840 --> 01:04:17,840
remember getting a hot tuna burger with chips and a root beer lunch, the root

1531
01:04:17,840 --> 01:04:19,720
beer lunch is a strange way to phrase it.

1532
01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:23,760
First of all, but then hot, all caps, a hot tuna bird.

1533
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:28,240
Let me tell you, this is a sculling, hot, hot as it could be.

1534
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:36,120
I don't, I, I, I'm so nauseated by the idea of this pirate ship

1535
01:04:36,120 --> 01:04:37,720
exploding with hot tuna.

1536
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:41,520
Would it be better for firing out tuna out of, I know I don't think so,

1537
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:46,000
but doesn't the, I just don't trust how in 1955 they're giving me piping hot

1538
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,240
tuna in a burger or in a pie.

1539
01:04:48,280 --> 01:04:52,240
I think that's just to differentiate from a cold tuna salad sandwich.

1540
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:54,720
But that all caps has intention to me.

1541
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:55,160
Oh, really?

1542
01:04:55,160 --> 01:04:56,480
That's yes, that's what I'm saying.

1543
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:58,200
It was a hot tuna bird.

1544
01:04:58,200 --> 01:05:00,160
Well, you didn't say so hot.

1545
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:04,800
Like the engine of the, or whatever you would, it wasn't a steam pirate ship.

1546
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:08,360
I assume it was a sailboat, but you would still, if there was an engine, you would

1547
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:11,400
just throw in tuna in there, like on a railroad.

1548
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:12,760
Shovell in some more tuna.

1549
01:05:12,760 --> 01:05:13,080
Right.

1550
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:14,040
And just hot.

1551
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:16,880
And they, but they would pull it out sometimes to, they would cook it also over

1552
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:19,280
those, over those coals and give it to the people.

1553
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:24,440
And if you ask nicely, if it was your birthday, like Johnny can stand, uh, just,

1554
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:33,040
just like aim line up with one of the cannons and a captain guy will say, fire

1555
01:05:33,040 --> 01:05:38,280
the tuna and then just a hot ball of sculpted tuna get fired into his face.

1556
01:05:38,280 --> 01:05:39,400
They let him drink.

1557
01:05:39,480 --> 01:05:42,840
They give him a big glass of the water from the can tuna.

1558
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:47,640
What if you ordered a can, a tuna cannonball and it was a perfectly

1559
01:05:47,640 --> 01:05:50,520
spherical piece of tuna, that'd be fun.

1560
01:05:50,520 --> 01:05:51,120
That's that.

1561
01:05:51,120 --> 01:05:51,360
Yeah.

1562
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:54,320
Well, that's getting into too much tuna territory.

1563
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:55,560
It could be a smaller though.

1564
01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:59,360
If it's like the size of the car, that is like a baseball.

1565
01:05:59,640 --> 01:05:59,960
Yeah.

1566
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:01,680
Baseball size ball of tuna.

1567
01:06:01,720 --> 01:06:02,440
Maybe not too much.

1568
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:02,840
All right.

1569
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:03,080
Yeah.

1570
01:06:03,120 --> 01:06:03,440
Yeah.

1571
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:04,640
Just a standard tuna ball.

1572
01:06:05,080 --> 01:06:06,600
Tuna in the tennis.

1573
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:08,360
We're talking not, not softball.

1574
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:09,440
Let's not go crazy here.

1575
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:10,240
It's not a softball.

1576
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:10,400
Yeah.

1577
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:10,960
No, it's not.

1578
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:12,200
No, that's entirely too much tuna.

1579
01:06:12,280 --> 01:06:12,720
Oh, yeah.

1580
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:14,800
What damn a baseball worth of tuna.

1581
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:15,320
Easy.

1582
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:17,280
Oh, of course.

1583
01:06:17,320 --> 01:06:18,280
No, are you kidding me?

1584
01:06:18,280 --> 01:06:18,560
All right.

1585
01:06:18,560 --> 01:06:22,800
Well, I can eat a foot long subway tuna sub full of tuna.

1586
01:06:22,800 --> 01:06:23,880
That's a lot of tuna.

1587
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:27,360
That's like, as far as like ice cream scoopers full of tuna.

1588
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:28,760
That's like six scoops.

1589
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:30,800
That is so many scoops.

1590
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:34,000
Uh, now it's hard for, I can't picture like I'm all right.

1591
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:34,960
Well, let's just, okay.

1592
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:38,720
So we've established that both of you can remember we're talking just pure tuna.

1593
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:41,800
There's no, there's no, there's no condiments to go with it.

1594
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:42,480
There's no bread.

1595
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:45,640
There's nothing else to distract from just the tune itself.

1596
01:06:45,840 --> 01:06:48,840
So you, we've established that you're comfortable eating a baseball of tuna.

1597
01:06:49,040 --> 01:06:49,200
Yeah.

1598
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:50,120
You could do that right now.

1599
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:50,560
Let's go.

1600
01:06:50,560 --> 01:06:51,240
Let's just keep going.

1601
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:52,200
Bigger football.

1602
01:06:53,360 --> 01:06:59,320
Um, to share, I think regulation football, it's not, it's not a deflate gate

1603
01:06:59,320 --> 01:07:03,960
situation where we could, the smaller, oh, post deflate gate.

1604
01:07:04,040 --> 01:07:04,440
Right.

1605
01:07:05,080 --> 01:07:06,840
Uh, is it, it's not tuna salad.

1606
01:07:07,560 --> 01:07:09,960
Um, it's just regular tuna dry.

1607
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:13,320
You know, you guys are going to have to tell me how you're preparing it to get

1608
01:07:13,320 --> 01:07:18,880
it into the bottle because I definitely couldn't eat a football size dry piece

1609
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:20,680
of tuna like that big.

1610
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:21,280
That's too big.

1611
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:22,480
You guys declare the preparation.

1612
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:24,000
What you say, what it takes for you.

1613
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:28,320
And I don't like the sharing you get, you have to split up and what, what is

1614
01:07:28,320 --> 01:07:32,960
it going to take to get you to eat a football size tuna if they took tuna

1615
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:37,920
salad and they sculpted it into a football, an NFL football, I could eat it.

1616
01:07:38,040 --> 01:07:38,360
Okay.

1617
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:39,080
No problem.

1618
01:07:39,160 --> 01:07:41,800
Uh, what about a little filling, but I could do it easily.

1619
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:45,960
Let's go bowling ball and let's just maybe declare a big, let's declare pounds.

1620
01:07:45,960 --> 01:07:49,040
That's going to be the easiest way to, uh, you know, do you think you could do eight?

1621
01:07:49,040 --> 01:07:50,360
Do you think you could do 12?

1622
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:53,000
And that's not necessarily true, but that's not because it's lighter.

1623
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,200
I'm just sort of talking for size of ball size of ball.

1624
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:55,400
Okay.

1625
01:07:55,400 --> 01:07:55,960
Size of ball.

1626
01:07:55,960 --> 01:07:58,160
So like a nine, 10 pound ball.

1627
01:07:58,200 --> 01:07:58,640
Yeah.

1628
01:07:58,640 --> 01:07:58,720
Yeah.

1629
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:00,360
You think you can clear a nine?

1630
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:02,640
Keep in mind, you got those finger holes.

1631
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:03,920
So that actually gives you a little break.

1632
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:07,080
You got three finger holes that, and that's, those are three less.

1633
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:09,440
That's three fingers worth of tuna.

1634
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:10,080
You don't have to eat.

1635
01:08:10,080 --> 01:08:10,880
It's not hollow.

1636
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:13,080
No, cause it was hollow.

1637
01:08:13,080 --> 01:08:13,560
No problem.

1638
01:08:13,560 --> 01:08:14,320
No, no, it's pure.

1639
01:08:15,240 --> 01:08:16,160
But there are holes.

1640
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:16,760
It's pure tuna.

1641
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:17,000
Yeah.

1642
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:20,920
With the whole, with the holes card so that you could, if hard enough, pick it

1643
01:08:20,920 --> 01:08:23,440
up and potentially even a bullet down a lane.

1644
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:25,560
If it, okay.

1645
01:08:26,360 --> 01:08:27,800
I could eat the football.

1646
01:08:27,800 --> 01:08:30,680
I think mostly no problem, but I would feel a little bit

1647
01:08:30,680 --> 01:08:32,000
like, ah, those last couple of bites.

1648
01:08:32,280 --> 01:08:37,880
I do think I could finish that much tuna, but it would be a struggle.

1649
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:40,640
The last 25% of the ball.

1650
01:08:40,680 --> 01:08:44,600
You would really need the emotional support of a group you were eating in

1651
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:47,720
front of where this a man versus food situation Jason cheering.

1652
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:49,120
Well, let's turn to Jason now.

1653
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:52,280
I don't, I don't know if we've got an answer on football or bowling.

1654
01:08:52,360 --> 01:08:54,800
I was skeptical about the football.

1655
01:08:54,840 --> 01:08:58,480
I think I would just need to load up all the accoutrements and talking

1656
01:08:58,480 --> 01:09:04,600
relish or chopped pickle, maybe a little lemon juice, um, uh, maybe some

1657
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:07,440
chopped egg mayonnaise, certainly.

1658
01:09:07,720 --> 01:09:09,760
Chopped egg takes due next level.

1659
01:09:09,840 --> 01:09:15,160
Um, and you need the whites and the yolk and just one, uh, let's see.

1660
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:16,760
Uh, maybe a squirt of mustard.

1661
01:09:17,280 --> 01:09:21,360
Um, but I don't, it would you be, would just, just to complete the bowling

1662
01:09:21,360 --> 01:09:24,560
ball image, would you be fine with the squirt of mustard spelling out the

1663
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:30,320
word Brunswick what specifically it's a bowling, the bowling ball.

1664
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:31,640
That's a brand of bowling ball.

1665
01:09:32,280 --> 01:09:37,040
Well, if the good people at Brunswick were involved, uh, I think I would,

1666
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:39,080
they're sponsoring this event.

1667
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:39,480
Yes.

1668
01:09:39,560 --> 01:09:43,360
I would give it a shot, but if Mikey eats the full bowling ball, I want

1669
01:09:43,360 --> 01:09:45,640
him to get like a champion ring.

1670
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:49,000
You see, you're just, you'd rather cheer him on that.

1671
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:53,440
You think I would be number one in this cheering section with like the little

1672
01:09:53,440 --> 01:09:56,840
Simpson, um, Homer Simpson, triangle flags.

1673
01:09:56,880 --> 01:09:57,160
Okay.

1674
01:09:57,200 --> 01:09:59,800
Would you, would you eat the triangle flag if it was made of tuna?

1675
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:00,480
Oh, sure.

1676
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:02,200
Those ones are really smart.

1677
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:04,840
I think tuna salad, especially you've got the mayo in there.

1678
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:06,560
Tuna salad goes down so nice.

1679
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:10,280
It goes down really, so you could end up eating what you could end up eating too

1680
01:10:10,280 --> 01:10:12,920
much because it's, it's pretty smooth.

1681
01:10:12,920 --> 01:10:14,720
It's a, it's like kind of like White Castle.

1682
01:10:14,720 --> 01:10:18,800
It's like a liquid, like White Castle Firehouse, like they're one of those

1683
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:22,720
places where they just load up vegetables and cheese and sauces.

1684
01:10:22,720 --> 01:10:25,840
And I was like, when I was eating it, I was like too much.

1685
01:10:25,880 --> 01:10:28,080
I pulled some stuff off, but I should have pulled more.

1686
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:29,800
Were you pulled off the vegetables?

1687
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:33,640
I pulled, well, I don't like tomatoes and I pulled off the onion too.

1688
01:10:33,640 --> 01:10:37,120
Cause onion on cold sandwiches overpowers everything.

1689
01:10:37,680 --> 01:10:38,960
Was it not cooked onion?

1690
01:10:39,560 --> 01:10:40,680
Cause like a raw onion.

1691
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:41,160
Okay.

1692
01:10:41,160 --> 01:10:42,440
So I guess I can see what you're saying.

1693
01:10:42,440 --> 01:10:44,440
I would, I would, I'm a big tomato guy.

1694
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:47,720
I'm a, I'm not as big of a raw onion guy, but I'll eat them.

1695
01:10:48,440 --> 01:10:49,880
So tomato, very acidic.

1696
01:10:49,880 --> 01:10:50,080
Yeah.

1697
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:51,120
Okay.

1698
01:10:52,120 --> 01:10:52,440
Great.

1699
01:10:52,440 --> 01:10:55,240
This is the one of the first things that's been said food wise that I

1700
01:10:55,240 --> 01:10:56,400
haven't had an objection to.

1701
01:10:56,400 --> 01:10:56,640
Okay.

1702
01:10:56,640 --> 01:10:56,920
Great.

1703
01:10:56,960 --> 01:10:58,240
Let me throw out one more bowling thing.

1704
01:10:58,240 --> 01:10:58,600
Yeah.

1705
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:04,480
If there's 10 bowling pins that are all compact tuna, how many could you get through?

1706
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:06,040
Uh, one and a half.

1707
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:06,560
One and a half.

1708
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:08,080
I think that's a good realistic.

1709
01:11:08,280 --> 01:11:08,600
Yeah.

1710
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:08,840
Yeah.

1711
01:11:08,840 --> 01:11:11,520
Again, I'm pushing it to do that, but I think one and a half.

1712
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:12,040
Yeah.

1713
01:11:12,040 --> 01:11:14,680
And the momentum of the, the electricity that you.

1714
01:11:14,840 --> 01:11:15,160
Yeah.

1715
01:11:15,160 --> 01:11:15,800
It was a whole thing.

1716
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:18,160
Cause you gotta remember, you're going to have that tuna excitement.

1717
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:22,080
You're going to have that tuna sensuality that I've seen on display.

1718
01:11:22,080 --> 01:11:23,920
Are you talking form factor?

1719
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:25,800
Are you including the weight too?

1720
01:11:26,840 --> 01:11:27,600
Uh, I'm not sure.

1721
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:32,960
We, uh, it's, I'm saying that whatever weight tuna actually is, is just

1722
01:11:33,160 --> 01:11:34,960
pressed into the, oh, that's actually better.

1723
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:38,000
Cause bowling ball balls tend to be heavy as do the pins.

1724
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:42,360
No, that's what I was saying that I think an eight pound bowling ball sized

1725
01:11:42,360 --> 01:11:44,480
ball of tuna is not necessarily going to be eight pounds.

1726
01:11:44,520 --> 01:11:44,880
Yeah.

1727
01:11:44,920 --> 01:11:45,920
It's lighter materials.

1728
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:46,120
Right.

1729
01:11:46,120 --> 01:11:47,080
So keep that in mind.

1730
01:11:47,240 --> 01:11:49,040
I wasn't choosing a, when choosing a weight.

1731
01:11:49,080 --> 01:11:50,160
I was keeping it in mind.

1732
01:11:50,160 --> 01:11:53,400
Yeah, I'm a smaller guy, so I'm not going to talk too big.

1733
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:54,760
I'd only go with one pin.

1734
01:11:55,760 --> 01:11:58,840
I let Mike have that go for the half, go for the gold.

1735
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:00,520
I just, whatever.

1736
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:02,920
Cause you know, I know what's coming on the other end of this.

1737
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:07,200
I, I, there is going to be an avalanche of comments from other tuna guys.

1738
01:12:07,560 --> 01:12:11,440
I just, let me just say to out loud to the person at the, probably the one

1739
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:13,480
person out there who's with me on this.

1740
01:12:13,960 --> 01:12:15,000
I'm, I hear you.

1741
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:18,440
I know that this episode has made you get close to throwing up,

1742
01:12:18,720 --> 01:12:22,320
imagining a full bowling set made entirely of tuna.

1743
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:24,560
And I just, I acknowledge you.

1744
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:25,480
And those were your questions.

1745
01:12:25,480 --> 01:12:26,400
So come say hi to me.

1746
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:30,280
Yes, Scott, I will say, uh, I'll give you some credit.

1747
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:37,280
The one school lunch, uh, that never sat right with me was a tuna sandwich

1748
01:12:37,320 --> 01:12:42,520
and a little juice box of you who, cause that made it really taste like dead fish.

1749
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:44,520
The you who you're saying?

1750
01:12:45,560 --> 01:12:46,280
Was bad.

1751
01:12:46,280 --> 01:12:49,680
Now, God knows what's in you who it's mostly water.

1752
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:52,800
So you would not have gone for the chocolate drink.

1753
01:12:52,840 --> 01:12:56,600
That is one of the items that comes with the, that is weird.

1754
01:12:56,920 --> 01:12:58,280
Tuna pie, please.

1755
01:12:58,280 --> 01:13:02,280
And mom will have a tuna boat and we will both have chocolate drinks with that.

1756
01:13:02,680 --> 01:13:03,560
Thank you.

1757
01:13:04,200 --> 01:13:04,720
Thank you.

1758
01:13:04,720 --> 01:13:05,240
Fine.

1759
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:07,120
Servicemen aboard.

1760
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:12,680
Coke zero and cool ranch Doritos both have very prominent flavors.

1761
01:13:12,680 --> 01:13:16,840
So they, they kind of, you know, is that a good thing or a bad thing?

1762
01:13:16,840 --> 01:13:17,400
It's good.

1763
01:13:17,440 --> 01:13:20,600
So it's not like you're not really tasting the tuna.

1764
01:13:20,600 --> 01:13:23,160
You're tasting something else when you're going back and forth.

1765
01:13:23,160 --> 01:13:28,160
Were you anti you who in general, when you were, oh no, I loved you who, and I drank it.

1766
01:13:28,520 --> 01:13:32,200
But it was just like, if that was what was in the fridge for the week, you know, you

1767
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:37,960
who juice boxes, which we had a brand of juice boxes back East called sipsies.

1768
01:13:38,520 --> 01:13:40,560
And we just called them all sipsies.

1769
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:42,480
So I still call them sipsies.

1770
01:13:42,480 --> 01:13:46,520
And then I have to kill myself mentally and say, you would be a sipsy.

1771
01:13:46,520 --> 01:13:47,200
Are you who?

1772
01:13:47,280 --> 01:13:47,680
Yeah.

1773
01:13:47,680 --> 01:13:52,360
You would be a sipsy, but a Capri sun bag would also be a sipsy.

1774
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:53,840
Oh, Capri sons are sipsies.

1775
01:13:53,880 --> 01:13:54,280
Okay.

1776
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:54,640
All right.

1777
01:13:54,680 --> 01:13:54,880
Yeah.

1778
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:56,120
They were all kind of sipsies.

1779
01:13:56,120 --> 01:13:57,080
Rules of sipsy.

1780
01:13:57,080 --> 01:14:01,880
So, um, I don't, I mean, is this not vile to that?

1781
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:03,360
It's nothing but tuna options.

1782
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:06,200
And then the drinks are coffee, milk and chocolate drink.

1783
01:14:06,360 --> 01:14:09,800
But what is bizarre to me, milk is like a heavy drink.

1784
01:14:09,800 --> 01:14:10,520
Obviously.

1785
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:15,680
Uh, uh, but that is, that is such an old school lunch, you know, like a big

1786
01:14:15,680 --> 01:14:19,760
tuna salad sandwich and then big glass of milk is like, that would be like, no

1787
01:14:19,760 --> 01:14:23,400
one would bat an eye at that in 19, whatever 50 something.

1788
01:14:23,440 --> 01:14:23,680
Yeah.

1789
01:14:23,680 --> 01:14:26,160
But I don't know if you guys bat, I think you, I think you guys could, I think you

1790
01:14:26,160 --> 01:14:28,040
could do the eat like wall challenge.

1791
01:14:28,120 --> 01:14:28,800
No problem.

1792
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:29,800
I think I could do it.

1793
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:34,680
I think I also would have loved to stand in front of the ship, which I learned was

1794
01:14:34,680 --> 01:14:39,160
made partially of Douglas fir and partially of polished mahogany.

1795
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:40,880
I believe that was a Jim Hill.

1796
01:14:41,080 --> 01:14:42,120
Oh, wow.

1797
01:14:42,720 --> 01:14:43,000
Yeah.

1798
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:43,480
Douglas fir.

1799
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:44,760
Two fine woods.

1800
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:50,400
Well, the thing is though, as the years went on, those fine woods were not

1801
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:57,040
entirely what it was made of because as the years went on, the ship sitting in

1802
01:14:57,040 --> 01:15:02,360
the lagoon rotted away and when pieces rotted away, they would replace those

1803
01:15:02,360 --> 01:15:08,440
with concrete, which were more viable for just standing the test of time in a

1804
01:15:08,440 --> 01:15:13,760
lagoon, but what this leads to is that, uh, uh, time passes the, the, the fine

1805
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:18,320
people at chicken of the sea took their confusing name elsewhere and they stopped

1806
01:15:18,320 --> 01:15:21,840
doing this branding in 1969, it became captain hooks galley.

1807
01:15:22,200 --> 01:15:27,800
At that point, there was only one tune, uh, option instead of, uh, 19 or whatever.

1808
01:15:28,160 --> 01:15:33,680
Uh, uh, but you know, so it still stood as part of the fantasy land, uh, experience

1809
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:39,960
for a number of years until the fantasy and redo in 82, 83, uh, and I think it

1810
01:15:39,960 --> 01:15:43,720
was on everybody on the top of mind for everybody, for Tony Baxter, he bemoans

1811
01:15:43,720 --> 01:15:47,880
this, that he couldn't, uh, get the thing moved because they started looking into

1812
01:15:47,880 --> 01:15:51,320
it and like, well, can we just like, you know, I think they'd even carved out a

1813
01:15:51,320 --> 01:15:54,680
place that was maybe where we were talking, maybe about cruises, maybe in the

1814
01:15:54,720 --> 01:15:59,120
small worlds lead up area, but they started looking at it and like, wait, a

1815
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:00,480
bunch of it is concrete.

1816
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:01,920
That's not going to move.

1817
01:16:02,160 --> 01:16:03,560
But the rest of it is all wood.

1818
01:16:03,560 --> 01:16:04,680
That's rotting away.

1819
01:16:04,680 --> 01:16:07,840
This was kind of like not kept up very well termites.

1820
01:16:07,880 --> 01:16:09,240
I believe termites too.

1821
01:16:09,240 --> 01:16:09,560
Really?

1822
01:16:09,560 --> 01:16:14,200
They went to strap the boat down and to move it.

1823
01:16:14,200 --> 01:16:16,320
And they're like, this is filled with termites.

1824
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:16,960
Wow.

1825
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:20,760
They had already, we were learning about all of the weird creatures that

1826
01:16:20,760 --> 01:16:22,960
used to be at Disneyland termites.

1827
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:27,960
They separately put the figurehead of the ship, which was Catalina, the

1828
01:16:27,960 --> 01:16:31,880
mermaid, of course, Catalina, the chicken of the sea mermaid.

1829
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:32,800
We know Catalina.

1830
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:34,160
They modified her a little.

1831
01:16:34,160 --> 01:16:37,680
I think Jason's first crush from the tunic.

1832
01:16:37,720 --> 01:16:37,960
Yeah.

1833
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:38,960
The tuna can lady.

1834
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:40,040
Can I admit something to you?

1835
01:16:40,120 --> 01:16:43,560
Sometimes I go home at night and I kiss the can.

1836
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:46,320
I got to practice on something.

1837
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:50,680
I asked you, do you want to make out and you're telling me about a tuna can.

1838
01:16:51,960 --> 01:16:57,440
Um, they, there was a story that they put the front of the ship and the

1839
01:16:57,480 --> 01:17:04,000
figure on a forklift, which stopped short and then flew off the forklift and

1840
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:12,080
shattered the figurehead and the, I guess that's the stern of the ship that

1841
01:17:12,080 --> 01:17:16,400
shattered and then the other thing was rotting away, but they wanted to move

1842
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:21,040
it to the end of storybook boats because they said, oh, storybook boats

1843
01:17:21,240 --> 01:17:23,040
starts with a big thing.

1844
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:24,720
You go through the mountain of the maestro.

1845
01:17:24,720 --> 01:17:26,400
It should end with a big thing.

1846
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:27,400
Oh yeah.

1847
01:17:27,440 --> 01:17:28,480
And that'd be a good place for it.

1848
01:17:28,480 --> 01:17:31,120
Cause it's still a lagoon and it needs a finale.

1849
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:33,720
And you know, we've never talked about that ride.

1850
01:17:33,760 --> 01:17:35,000
We've never done an episode about it.

1851
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:38,680
I guess it'll come in class of 55, but there used to be this thing where the

1852
01:17:38,680 --> 01:17:45,000
finale was that they would point to the like, like just the functional area where

1853
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,320
the boats are sent when the rides over.

1854
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:50,240
And they would say, we call that never, never land because you can never,

1855
01:17:50,240 --> 01:17:51,160
never go there.

1856
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:52,400
Have we ever talked about that?

1857
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:53,520
I don't think so.

1858
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:55,480
That's what it always was.

1859
01:17:55,480 --> 01:17:57,920
Mike told, I've never spoken that on the show.

1860
01:17:58,000 --> 01:17:59,800
I always thought that was really funny.

1861
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,920
They would just like make use of that in this, you know, in this ride with lots

1862
01:18:02,920 --> 01:18:07,040
of charming miniatures, the final thing you see is just like a bunch of flappy

1863
01:18:07,040 --> 01:18:10,000
plastic is where boats go and get fixed.

1864
01:18:10,640 --> 01:18:14,440
So they would make that joke to try to acknowledge the underwhelming finale of

1865
01:18:14,440 --> 01:18:16,880
it. Eventually that got replaced by let's try what it's like.

1866
01:18:16,920 --> 01:18:19,720
Is it like the Ariel's kingdom or something?

1867
01:18:19,720 --> 01:18:24,200
Like, I forget what the very end, but anyway, it was like, it was such a bad

1868
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:27,560
finale of that ride that they just made a joke out of it.

1869
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:32,040
So to have it end with the pirate ship would have been a much more spectacular

1870
01:18:32,040 --> 01:18:34,120
really great joke, though.

1871
01:18:34,160 --> 01:18:39,520
But they always, they worked so hard on hiding the entrance to the maintenance

1872
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:46,080
base that talks for like the, the phantasmic floats in both coasts and stuff.

1873
01:18:46,120 --> 01:18:51,920
And there's nothing I want to see more than unthemed boring maintenance base.

1874
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:55,640
Sometimes you get lucky in Indiana Jones, the door will be open.

1875
01:18:55,720 --> 01:18:56,320
Oh yeah.

1876
01:18:56,320 --> 01:18:58,320
You know, you see a car vehicle go in there.

1877
01:18:58,320 --> 01:18:58,960
You ever seen that?

1878
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:02,480
We got to see the Spider-Man scoop workshop.

1879
01:19:03,160 --> 01:19:03,840
Oh, that's right.

1880
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:04,440
Yes, we did.

1881
01:19:04,480 --> 01:19:06,760
Lid up, see like, that was very cool.

1882
01:19:06,760 --> 01:19:06,880
Yeah.

1883
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:10,160
Because one of them was being, you know, had been repaired and was being

1884
01:19:10,160 --> 01:19:13,240
programmed, so you saw it go through all the motions.

1885
01:19:13,240 --> 01:19:13,640
Like that was crazy.

1886
01:19:13,640 --> 01:19:17,120
It's doing the ride without moving through the ride, but you can tell,

1887
01:19:17,120 --> 01:19:18,800
okay, that's the big drop of that.

1888
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:21,280
It's spinning around the pumpkin or whatever.

1889
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:22,640
Uh, wait, it's not a pumpkin.

1890
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:24,880
It's a, it doesn't throw pumpkins.

1891
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:27,160
It is a pump.

1892
01:19:27,160 --> 01:19:30,840
Yeah, I thought I was like, damn, I'm making, I throws pumpkins.

1893
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:31,680
I'm goblin.

1894
01:19:31,720 --> 01:19:32,040
It is.

1895
01:19:32,040 --> 01:19:32,360
Okay.

1896
01:19:32,360 --> 01:19:34,280
Yeah, he throws Goblin does too.

1897
01:19:34,280 --> 01:19:35,320
They all throw pumpkins.

1898
01:19:35,400 --> 01:19:38,200
So anyways, yeah, this ship brought it away and then parts of it

1899
01:19:38,200 --> 01:19:39,800
shattered when they tried to move it and move it.

1900
01:19:39,800 --> 01:19:41,360
And that was the, the end of that.

1901
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:45,480
And we have no, and it is one of these things that is like a treasured memory

1902
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:49,120
for lots of kids of original Disneyland era.

1903
01:19:49,120 --> 01:19:51,760
And then I think it's maybe a disappointment to some people who go

1904
01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:52,520
and like, oh, that's right.

1905
01:19:52,520 --> 01:19:53,440
There's no pirate ship.

1906
01:19:53,440 --> 01:19:59,800
And yeah, though I always, my mental fondness for it kind of came from my mom.

1907
01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:02,480
And I, before the episode, I was like, oh, I gotta ask her about it.

1908
01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:03,880
Cause she's probably got great stories.

1909
01:20:03,880 --> 01:20:06,080
I said, do you have any strong memories or specifics about the

1910
01:20:06,080 --> 01:20:07,160
chicken of the sea pirate ship?

1911
01:20:07,280 --> 01:20:09,080
Cause I swear she would speak glowingly of it.

1912
01:20:09,280 --> 01:20:10,840
And then she wrote back, vague.

1913
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:12,760
I believe you could board it and walk around.

1914
01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:14,680
Thought it seemed huge and interesting.

1915
01:20:15,400 --> 01:20:16,120
The end.

1916
01:20:16,200 --> 01:20:18,000
All right, mom, that's all we got.

1917
01:20:18,160 --> 01:20:19,160
That's all accurate.

1918
01:20:19,440 --> 01:20:24,680
Uh, you know what I, uh, I guess I thank you guys for having so much tuna

1919
01:20:24,680 --> 01:20:27,840
information because my mom was correct.

1920
01:20:27,880 --> 01:20:31,080
And there wasn't that, if there was only that to say about it, then we

1921
01:20:31,080 --> 01:20:35,280
wouldn't, we needed an hour 10 of tuna material in order to flesh out the episode.

1922
01:20:35,320 --> 01:20:40,720
Well, I also found, uh, one of the van eaten gallery auction catalogs.

1923
01:20:41,120 --> 01:20:45,960
They were selling some stuff from this, uh, chicken of the sea pirate ship

1924
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:51,240
restaurant barrel seat, because that was the little stores that you would eat

1925
01:20:51,280 --> 01:20:55,400
around the lagoon, you know, they would, which that looks really, it was always

1926
01:20:55,400 --> 01:20:57,000
described as like, yeah, yeah, lovely.

1927
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,920
Like shaded area, like a nice place of calm and fantasy land.

1928
01:21:00,040 --> 01:21:02,920
So they were, they were selling one of those.

1929
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:04,440
Yeah, that's good.

1930
01:21:04,640 --> 01:21:09,840
But they were all so that they were estimated going for two to $4,000.

1931
01:21:10,360 --> 01:21:15,040
Understandably, but they were also selling a chicken of the sea pirate ship

1932
01:21:15,200 --> 01:21:20,680
restaurant food tray liner that they're, uh, they said an unusual and

1933
01:21:20,680 --> 01:21:25,840
understandably extremely rare food tray liner from the chicken of the sea

1934
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:27,880
pirate ship restaurant and fantasy land.

1935
01:21:29,120 --> 01:21:34,160
And they make sure to note normally thrown away after the meal.

1936
01:21:34,520 --> 01:21:40,200
This particular one was saved as a souvenir, complete with creasing and

1937
01:21:40,200 --> 01:21:44,480
staining from what was short of a bin, a tasty tuna treat.

1938
01:21:44,720 --> 01:21:49,960
Ew, tasty tunic tree, old tunas.

1939
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:55,160
But they were estimating, they were estimating that was only going to go

1940
01:21:55,160 --> 01:22:00,120
for 50 to $100 and I was like, fuck, why didn't I bid on that?

1941
01:22:00,120 --> 01:22:02,560
I didn't see that one in whatever exhibit.

1942
01:22:02,560 --> 01:22:03,600
This was part of you.

1943
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:06,440
If you came up to me like, guess what I got?

1944
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:08,560
I just bought this menu for a while.

1945
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:09,560
That's so cool.

1946
01:22:09,640 --> 01:22:12,800
You give me a big hug because you're so excited about what you bought.

1947
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:15,600
And then I'm like, so what's the way that looks a little weird though.

1948
01:22:15,720 --> 01:22:18,640
Oh, it's just a 60 year old tuna stains.

1949
01:22:18,920 --> 01:22:21,440
I would have like shoved you away.

1950
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:23,880
I would have gone and taken five showers.

1951
01:22:24,280 --> 01:22:25,320
That is sold.

1952
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:28,480
That is an episode where I've been grossed out.

1953
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:30,360
That is one of the grossest things I've ever heard.

1954
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:33,280
Yeah, that is driving away, Mike.

1955
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:37,360
And I just chanting to not time to not time.

1956
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:39,160
We're going fishing after this.

1957
01:22:39,160 --> 01:22:43,480
It's the glee with which it was presented by Van.

1958
01:22:43,600 --> 01:22:48,400
What was sure to have been a bunch of sticky fingers covered in tuna juice.

1959
01:22:48,840 --> 01:22:52,120
They got their grubby little tuna paws all of you.

1960
01:22:52,160 --> 01:22:54,760
You don't say that with an exclamation point.

1961
01:22:55,040 --> 01:22:56,560
This should not be celebrated.

1962
01:22:56,560 --> 01:23:01,000
I miss it when I first started reading that description and I kind of peeked ahead.

1963
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,240
And I was like, that's a tasty tuna treat.

1964
01:23:03,240 --> 01:23:04,920
Yeah, it does. OK.

1965
01:23:04,920 --> 01:23:06,880
Hip hip hooray.

1966
01:23:06,920 --> 01:23:10,360
Somebody got somebody's eyes were a little bit bigger than their stomach

1967
01:23:10,360 --> 01:23:12,880
and they ate too big of a tuna boat.

1968
01:23:13,120 --> 01:23:17,440
And maybe some of it dripped out of their mouth onto the menu

1969
01:23:17,680 --> 01:23:19,080
and onto the placeman.

1970
01:23:19,080 --> 01:23:20,280
Naughty little tuna boy.

1971
01:23:20,280 --> 01:23:22,560
They were being lotty little tuna boys.

1972
01:23:22,640 --> 01:23:24,720
I mean, look, dripping with excitement.

1973
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:28,080
Could it just been pastry shell grease or something?

1974
01:23:28,760 --> 01:23:29,840
It could have been pastry shell grease.

1975
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:31,080
It could have been any number of weird.

1976
01:23:31,080 --> 01:23:32,680
Could have been chocolate drink.

1977
01:23:32,680 --> 01:23:36,280
There were so many wonderful goose that went great together.

1978
01:23:36,280 --> 01:23:38,360
Yeah. At this wonderful restaurant.

1979
01:23:38,360 --> 01:23:39,400
You guys have got it now.

1980
01:23:39,400 --> 01:23:40,200
You guys got to be.

1981
01:23:40,200 --> 01:23:42,920
It's going to kill you that you can't go to this today.

1982
01:23:43,280 --> 01:23:45,800
I would love to be brought back from the dead.

1983
01:23:46,120 --> 01:23:47,080
I would. Well, OK.

1984
01:23:47,080 --> 01:23:47,720
What do you take it?

1985
01:23:47,720 --> 01:23:50,200
Would you get rid of in order to bring this restaurant back, Jason?

1986
01:23:50,200 --> 01:23:51,040
Oh, jeepers.

1987
01:23:51,040 --> 01:23:52,760
You got one Disneyland or California Adventure.

1988
01:23:52,760 --> 01:23:53,600
You can pick either one.

1989
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:54,440
Pick a pick any ticket.

1990
01:23:54,440 --> 01:23:56,120
Sorry, Florida Space Mountain.

1991
01:23:56,120 --> 01:23:59,480
You're just a little too rough.

1992
01:23:59,480 --> 01:24:01,440
That's an easy one.

1993
01:24:02,040 --> 01:24:03,880
It's an easy one. You got to go to Disneyland, I think.

1994
01:24:03,880 --> 01:24:05,760
Oh, now I have to go to Disneyland.

1995
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:07,120
Yeah. OK.

1996
01:24:07,120 --> 01:24:10,480
E-ticket is or it can be D as well.

1997
01:24:11,680 --> 01:24:13,680
Can I go over to California Adventure?

1998
01:24:13,680 --> 01:24:14,680
Yeah, OK.

1999
01:24:14,680 --> 01:24:16,280
Sorry, web slingers.

2000
01:24:16,280 --> 01:24:18,960
You're like a ticket is a web site.

2001
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:20,760
Well, there's no argument here.

2002
01:24:20,760 --> 01:24:22,800
Is Casey Jr. a D ticket?

2003
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:23,800
No, no.

2004
01:24:23,800 --> 01:24:26,480
See, I think I guess I made the rules.

2005
01:24:26,480 --> 01:24:29,200
I have to play by them.

2006
01:24:30,960 --> 01:24:34,360
Bye bye, Snow White and Pinocchio.

2007
01:24:35,160 --> 01:24:36,360
Those aren't E tickets either.

2008
01:24:36,360 --> 01:24:38,760
You don't think those are D?

2009
01:24:38,760 --> 01:24:40,800
Well, you changed the rules to D.

2010
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:42,480
I think they literally weren't.

2011
01:24:42,480 --> 01:24:43,960
I think, like, I don't know.

2012
01:24:43,960 --> 01:24:46,000
Really? Maybe I'm wrong.

2013
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:49,240
I don't know, because they were simpler back in the day.

2014
01:24:49,240 --> 01:24:51,640
All right. Well, Rise of Resistance gone.

2015
01:24:51,640 --> 01:24:52,440
All right.

2016
01:24:52,440 --> 01:24:54,560
Well, you can do that without batting an eyelash.

2017
01:24:54,560 --> 01:24:57,880
You're dying for that to be gone.

2018
01:24:57,880 --> 01:24:59,640
I'm trying to figure out if that was.

2019
01:24:59,640 --> 01:25:03,400
Yeah, were those because back in the day, especially, those were really cool.

2020
01:25:03,400 --> 01:25:05,080
C ticket was Rocket to the Moon.

2021
01:25:05,080 --> 01:25:09,160
It was sitting on those shitting mules.

2022
01:25:09,160 --> 01:25:12,520
It was Canoes, which were named something that I'm not going to read out loud.

2023
01:25:12,520 --> 01:25:16,000
Could you feed the mule a little bit of your uneaten tuna meal?

2024
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,240
You could feed the mule anything, Michael.

2025
01:25:18,240 --> 01:25:19,120
OK, well.

2026
01:25:19,120 --> 01:25:20,920
They didn't pay much attention.

2027
01:25:20,920 --> 01:25:26,040
This is strange, actually, that C tickets, Snow White, Peter Pan, Mr.

2028
01:25:26,040 --> 01:25:31,160
Toad, all of these were C tickets, but the ability to ride on a real mule

2029
01:25:31,160 --> 01:25:35,720
and to see what it what it pukes up onto the dirt trail in front of you.

2030
01:25:35,720 --> 01:25:40,160
That was probably worth examining at some point is like what was what?

2031
01:25:40,160 --> 01:25:42,360
Yeah. What was everything assigned?

2032
01:25:42,360 --> 01:25:44,960
Because Florida had the ticket books.

2033
01:25:45,240 --> 01:25:49,000
Was it capacity related that like you could get a lot more people through?

2034
01:25:49,280 --> 01:25:50,120
Oh, I don't think so.

2035
01:25:50,120 --> 01:25:51,640
Yeah, that's why I never thought that.

2036
01:25:51,640 --> 01:25:54,520
But I'm just trying to think why those would be C versus mule rides.

2037
01:25:54,520 --> 01:25:57,960
Yeah, that's that's that's what the strangest even back then.

2038
01:25:57,960 --> 01:26:00,520
Or like crowds or wait times, you know.

2039
01:26:01,160 --> 01:26:05,480
It was was mule ride, like a more popular guest attraction.

2040
01:26:05,480 --> 01:26:06,760
I loved the mules.

2041
01:26:06,760 --> 01:26:08,840
He only bit my leg once.

2042
01:26:10,640 --> 01:26:15,560
All right. Well, boy, I don't know how you're going to come down from that.

2043
01:26:15,560 --> 01:26:17,160
Well, I do know you're going to come down from this.

2044
01:26:17,160 --> 01:26:19,360
You're going to place an order as soon as we're out.

2045
01:26:19,400 --> 01:26:21,080
That's right. All right.

2046
01:26:21,080 --> 01:26:23,000
Well, enjoy your hot tuna nights.

2047
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,240
You know, for now, you survived.

2048
01:26:25,240 --> 01:26:27,200
I barely survived podcast the ride.
