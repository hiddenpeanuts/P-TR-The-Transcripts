1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:12,700
Warning, the following topical podcast contains sinking cruises, speculation on a hard R. Lizzie

4
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:19,280
McGuire series, highly specific yet super basic ketchup preferences, and one young boy's dream

5
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:21,800
to be an electronic store astronaut.

6
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,640
It's Chapex Rise, Scott at Fries on Podcast the Ride.

7
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:54,160
Welcome to Podcast the Ride, where we're excited that Bob Chapex is the new CEO of Disney, and

8
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,160
I am the new CEO of Space.

9
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:01,440
I'm Scott Gardner, as I said, the CEO of Space, joined by Mike Carlson.

10
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,600
Yes, and I am the CFO of Fun?

11
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,600
I don't know.

12
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,600
Ooh, I like that.

13
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,160
Chief Fun Officer and Jason Sheridan.

14
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:16,720
Chief Operating Officer of NAPS?

15
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,440
Approved, title approved, the full board approves.

16
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:23,280
Hey, this is kind of a fun little grab bag episode.

17
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,240
We realize there's so much news going on.

18
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:32,480
It's been a truly insane week in the world of theme parks and insane week for us personally,

19
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:36,760
and it seemed like it'd be fun to talk about all of this stuff.

20
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:41,360
A bunch of news to talk about, and at the end of the episode we'll talk about this Fries

21
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:46,520
electronics adventure that played out in a very fun way this week.

22
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:54,160
But for now, first things first, let's pay deference to our new leader, our new unquestioned

23
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,160
Lord and Master.

24
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,160
Chapex.

25
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,080
Chapex.

26
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,080
A little more monotone actually.

27
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,080
Chapex.

28
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,080
Chapex.

29
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,080
Chapex.

30
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,080
Chapex.

31
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,080
Chapex.

32
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:12,320
Congrats to that man we always shit on, on his new promotion.

33
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:17,860
Mike I believe you described, I say using the phrase that you were, you haven't been

34
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:21,200
contacted this much about a news story since Prince died.

35
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,680
That is correct.

36
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,160
When Prince died I was texted a lot.

37
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:28,200
I mean it did, it was, and people were right to text me.

38
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,240
It was a very depressing day.

39
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:33,400
I was very bummed out about it.

40
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:40,040
But I have not had so many texts since that day in the span of an hour or two.

41
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:43,520
Where I think I had gotten like three texts immediately.

42
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:47,840
I put my phone down for like 30 minutes, came back to the phone and it was seven or eight

43
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,560
or nine texts from different people.

44
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,560
You know what's funny?

45
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,120
Not the case with me.

46
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,120
Interesting.

47
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:58,360
Jason, were you texted individually about Bob Chapex?

48
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:01,200
Texted, added on Twitter, DM'd.

49
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,400
Well I didn't even count that.

50
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,160
Yes, there were plenty of people adding us.

51
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,800
But did people, I think text.

52
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,600
Did your parents call?

53
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,760
You guys were, my dad texted me.

54
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,760
Yes, about it.

55
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,760
Yes.

56
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,760
Whoa, whoa.

57
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,760
My mom I believe did too.

58
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,760
Wow.

59
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,760
I was in Vegas and was napping.

60
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:28,840
Fittingly was asleep and just woke up, like pulled up my phone to see what time it was

61
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:32,720
and then just saw all these texts.

62
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,640
Which was like the middle of the afternoon.

63
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,640
This is like a new one.

64
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,640
Yes.

65
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,400
You weren't even in Vegas for 24 hours and you were napping?

66
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,520
We're going to get to this on a different episode of Your Vegas Trip.

67
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:44,400
Check out podcasts at the second gate coming soon.

68
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,720
Okay, you're right.

69
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,720
We can't get, that's a tease.

70
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,720
I don't know.

71
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,080
You were sleeping with literally 24 hours in Vegas?

72
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:54,560
Like four hours after landing in Vegas, like three hours.

73
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,560
Like after lunch.

74
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,560
You got there and napped immediately.

75
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,560
Yeah, well the room was ready and we took the early flight.

76
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,560
This is out of control.

77
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,560
You immediately got there?

78
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,560
Living it up.

79
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,560
What happens in Vegas?

80
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,560
You get to do whatever you want in Vegas.

81
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:11,560
Did you go to like the pool and like close your eyes by the pool?

82
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:14,560
It was 60 degrees and windy outside.

83
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,560
That's fair.

84
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,400
I guess you did the next best thing.

85
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:24,400
Check out a travelogue episode coming up with a couple of friends, a couple of famous friends.

86
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,400
Real sweeties, if you will.

87
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,400
Named after colors perhaps?

88
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:36,400
Yeah, so typical, you're in Vegas, it is noon and you're napping.

89
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,400
Got it.

90
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,400
Makes total sense.

91
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,400
Got it.

92
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,400
So are you woken up by text messages?

93
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,400
No, no.

94
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,400
I edit on Do Not Disturb.

95
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,240
Okay, okay.

96
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:50,240
Yeah, we were all split up.

97
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,240
I mean, well I rushed to Ontario Mills as soon as I heard.

98
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,240
I hit the road as soon as I heard to make my point on Twitter.

99
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:01,240
We all made videos that you may have seen, but it was a little war room.

100
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:04,240
We had to figure out how to do it despite all being in separate locations.

101
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,240
Well, because people were calling for an emergency episode about this.

102
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:11,240
This is big news and obviously we were not all in the same place so we could not do it.

103
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,240
Yeah.

104
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,240
So we needed to put a response out.

105
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,080
And I felt best if we all put out video messages.

106
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,080
This is it, it's a late emergency.

107
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,080
Yeah.

108
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,080
Yeah, who could have seen it coming?

109
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:28,080
Because the weird way this played out, we've known for a long time current CEO Bob Iger.

110
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,080
I guess not current, is he already not?

111
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,080
No, he's already not.

112
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,080
He's officially ex-

113
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,080
Wow, former.

114
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:36,080
Is the title executive chairman?

115
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,080
He's still with the company.

116
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:41,080
Executive chairman through December 31st, 2021.

117
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,920
He has pushed his retirement four times already.

118
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,920
And the last we hear it, he was going to be CEO until 2021.

119
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,920
Yes.

120
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,920
That was the last-

121
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,920
So this suddenly happened.

122
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,920
Yes, he's still there.

123
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:57,920
He's still roaming around the company.

124
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,920
He's saying he's going to do more creative work.

125
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,920
That's what he's been saying.

126
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,920
That's what he's been saying, I guess.

127
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,920
Yes, focusing on his creative endeavors.

128
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:09,920
He and Lucas are going to write a movie together.

129
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:14,760
Well, he and Lucas are doing those experimental films in Lucas' garage together, but no one

130
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:15,760
will ever see them.

131
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:18,760
They're all cutting up pig organs and stuff.

132
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:21,760
Yeah, Lucas will never show them to anybody except for Charlie Rose.

133
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:26,760
Like all those JD Salinger stories they found at his safe after he died.

134
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,760
We will see the films after George Lucas' passing.

135
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,760
Well, The Vault, when it's opened, much like Prince.

136
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,760
That's a good point.

137
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,760
They'll move it all close to Nazpereg's farm.

138
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,600
Yeah, that would be good, actually.

139
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,600
But yeah, it's confusing.

140
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:49,600
I think it sounds like what he is sticking around to do is focus on Disney Plus and the

141
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:55,600
switch over to streaming in the new way they're presenting media.

142
00:06:55,600 --> 00:07:01,600
Yes, that doesn't sound creative to me, but not so much.

143
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,600
Maybe it is.

144
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:09,440
We also haven't jumped in with an episode since some other creative news that broke,

145
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:16,440
which is that Rick Moranis will come out of retirement for the Honey, I Shrunk the Audience,

146
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:19,440
the new Honey, I Shrunk the Audience film starring...

147
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:28,440
Let me do a MSNBC Bernie reporting style sigh starring Josh Gad.

148
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:35,280
So do we think that maybe Iger will be doing rewrites on this?

149
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,280
Well, you said Honey, I Shrunk the Audience, too.

150
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,280
Well, I'm so theme park-

151
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,280
I was wondering if that was actually an announcement I missed.

152
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:46,280
You know, I mean, I'm way more likely to say Star Tours than Star Wars.

153
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,280
That's where my head's at.

154
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:54,280
But I think yes, he's going to roll up his sleeves and he's going to punch up the jokes.

155
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:59,120
I think it's on those creative endeavors, the phrase they officially use.

156
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,120
You know that phrase, we're all the creative endeavors.

157
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,120
Creative guy, bye bye, he's a creative guy.

158
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,120
We're always saying it.

159
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,120
We've all been saying it.

160
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,120
Well, he thought of that great thing about distinctly Disney, but authentically Chinese.

161
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,120
Of course.

162
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,120
So that is one thing we know that he wrote.

163
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:31,960
If you didn't hear our second gate episode, he several times in the Imagineering Story documentary says that we have to take time to pay tribute to when he said distinctly Disney, but authentically Chinese.

164
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,960
Yes.

165
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,960
That might be the flip. I don't know. Maybe I'm not getting it right.

166
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,960
I don't remember.

167
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,960
I'll be honest with you.

168
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,960
Yeah, distinctly Disney, authentically Chinese.

169
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:45,960
But this great piece of writing we have to tribute.

170
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,800
Let's take time out of a documentary series where we can see footage of robots we love.

171
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,800
To say, well, I don't know, it just came to me.

172
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,800
I just thought of the phrase.

173
00:08:54,800 --> 00:09:00,800
For sale, baby shoes never worn has been replaced by distinctly Disney, authentically Chinese.

174
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,800
So he's got to catch her.

175
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,800
He wrote one thing.

176
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,800
We do like that.

177
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:14,800
I think it was his book or somewhere else where he was really tickled by the idea in Solo that Han Solo would say that he was alone.

178
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:19,640
And that's when he got his trademark name, Han Solo, because he was alone.

179
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,640
And that's something that Iger really liked.

180
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,640
He didn't write it.

181
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,640
He didn't think of it, but we know that that's where his taste lies.

182
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,640
Yes. He liked Solo.

183
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:31,640
And we as well as did we all. We all enjoyed that scene.

184
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,640
Yes.

185
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,640
Very much.

186
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,640
Yes, we did.

187
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,640
Long size all.

188
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,640
We all liked the scene.

189
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,640
Iger Justice Meikle learns about is that even a thing?

190
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:50,480
There's this new thing that they're doing in movies where it is questioned whether or not something is a thing.

191
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,480
And this is the kind of sensibility we want to bring to the shrunk franchise.

192
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,480
He's trying to. Yeah.

193
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,480
Do you what do you think after he heard they fly now?

194
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,480
What do you think he was like around the office?

195
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,480
Yes.

196
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,480
You guys seen it here? Get in here, everybody.

197
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,480
The Rise of Skywalker trailer and it's in the film.

198
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,480
They say they fly now.

199
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,320
I have one note.

200
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,320
Can we say it one more time?

201
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,320
And they did.

202
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,320
They added a few more in there.

203
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,320
I like that. Oh, I heard today.

204
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:29,320
I don't want to sidetrack too much that it now it's officially canon and spoiler alert that the emperor in Rise of Skywalker is a clone.

205
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:33,320
They finally said officially that Palpatine.

206
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,320
Is that because it's in the novelization?

207
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:41,320
I don't know, but I saw a thing on Twitter from a reputable source that says it's now canon that that was a clone.

208
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,160
So there that's settled.

209
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:50,160
No film in history has had more off screen information than Star Wars Nine Rise of Skywalker.

210
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,160
It is a full film's worth of knowledge.

211
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:58,160
But isn't that brain melting giant knowledge that is not in the movie?

212
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:04,160
Isn't that fun to have more movies where you find out on Twitter a couple months later important plot points?

213
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,160
You have to go to a book or a Twitch stream.

214
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,160
Yeah.

215
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:19,000
If if you're like thinking too hard about the just now out novelization of the Rise of Skywalker, folks, it's time to move on.

216
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I think that OK, well, Disney is like changing the way the media is released, and that's maybe what shape X is going to be doing a little bit.

217
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
And I like that they've created like a new act structure.

218
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Movies used to be like it was three acts that take place over 90 minutes to three hours.

219
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:43,840
And now we've added a fourth act, which plays out extremely slowly over many months, both online and in books that you have to pick up.

220
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:46,840
It may still be this act may never end.

221
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,840
Yeah, you know what?

222
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:53,840
And I think what's fun about this is that, you know, I read that and I think it was a reputable Twitter source.

223
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,840
But who knows what?

224
00:11:55,840 --> 00:12:03,840
I feel like we can all contribute sort of to the canon in a different way now by just announcing something about episode nine and people going, oh, OK.

225
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:10,680
So we could we could make up a piece of canon right now, tweet it from like a fake Star Wars news Twitter.

226
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:13,680
And then I think it'll just happen to be canon.

227
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,680
Yeah, I think we could make that happen.

228
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:23,680
OK, so if we if we have if you have an idea, Kylo Ren is scared of toilets.

229
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:31,680
I mean, that's because he thought of a store that would have many toilets because he realized, oh, you have to buy them somewhere.

230
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:34,280
Oh, no. And he got so upset.

231
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,480
He disappeared. He died.

232
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:40,880
That's good. But I feel like maybe people might catch on that that's not a true Rises Skywalker spoiler.

233
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:46,120
Well, I guess they're not real fans then.

234
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:48,960
If you call the toilet something else.

235
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:51,680
Space Evacuators.

236
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,080
Pretty good. Yes.

237
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:57,680
Well, there was the toilet droid we created in the Rise of the Resistance episode.

238
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,680
Oh, yeah. P 00.

239
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:11,560
I think well, you know what I heard from a reputable source is that there's all those like hooded characters on Exegol in Exegol.

240
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:18,880
Yeah, you can't you never see their faces, but they shot scenes where among the hooded.

241
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:23,760
What are they? They're like the Dark Lords of the Sith.

242
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:36,160
All right. Among the among the hooded Sith spirits was all Star Trek crew members past and present for every every enterprise crew from every era.

243
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,800
Those were all among.

244
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,960
Well, who knows who else was that line up?

245
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:46,160
That's like a fucking Sergeant Pepper crew back there, like all sorts of people are back.

246
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,800
Walter Koenig to K.

247
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:53,240
They all shot scenes and then they were left on the cutting room floor.

248
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,120
That's all real now.

249
00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:02,120
While we're talking about Star Wars, so the best article I saw about this switch over was at the Verge.

250
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:13,600
And they kept quoting an anonymous former Disney executive who who seemed to put forward the idea that like Chay Pack is sticking around for a couple more years for oversight.

251
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,400
Eiger.

252
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,080
Yes, Eiger. Sorry.

253
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:27,160
Chay Pack, presumably sticking around for a while, but Eiger sort of the still the big idea guy and shape pack like a caretaker CEO executing those ideas.

254
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:30,400
But this quote very much stuck out to me.

255
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:35,760
If he's sticking around, it could just be that he's the trainer, the former Disney executive said.

256
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:40,240
The Sith apprentice and Sith Lord, he'll be holding Chay Pack's hand.

257
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,360
He's going to take a position to still be deeply entwined with the company.

258
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,920
It's still Bob's show.

259
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,920
Well, I use Eiger.

260
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,800
Yes, confusing because they're both Bob's.

261
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,320
Oh, yeah. Is there anyone watching Macmillan's?

262
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,160
No.

263
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,920
There's this very confusing thing where there's several Jerry's who are part of the scheme.

264
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,400
This is similar.

265
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:02,840
Too many Jerry's, too many Bob's that makes it confusing.

266
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,840
I don't know. This is Bob's.

267
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,440
Oh, wow.

268
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,400
What? Which Bob?

269
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:11,360
And there's a big Jerry in succession to all these like white collar shows.

270
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,120
They captured that accurately.

271
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,840
There's always a Jerry with schemes or a foot.

272
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:18,600
And they say like, oh, yeah, go talk to Bob about it or something.

273
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,640
You don't know who.

274
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:20,840
Boy, you don't.

275
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,800
And like, oh, Bob, that's Bob's fault.

276
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:27,240
And you don't know which Bob creates kind of a smoke screen, let's him get away with some stuff.

277
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,120
That's true. It's interesting.

278
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:37,680
I've seen plenty of great, real sounding rumors and crazy sounding rumors about this situation with Eiger.

279
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,600
Stale is still being there.

280
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,440
Yeah. But Chay Pack technically being the CEO.

281
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,840
It's like what that's sort of saying, which I think I've seen.

282
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:49,760
It's like, well, Eiger is going to be around if they feel like Chay Pack isn't doing it.

283
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,480
Well, you know how this feels to me is this is Len O'Connor.

284
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,640
Yeah, that's a very he's not really.

285
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:01,600
We're and we're handing the reins slowly in a while.

286
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,120
Yeah. It actually turns out he's going to stick around.

287
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:07,320
But don't it's you know, it'll day he's going to do it.

288
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:10,960
Yes. As I as David Letterman said, yeah, I'll be on the lobby.

289
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,920
I'll be waiting for you.

290
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,520
I'll be over here.

291
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,840
I've watched. I've watched the letter.

292
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,480
You want the law?

293
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:23,720
I think I've watched the Letterman making fun of the situation.

294
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,880
YouTube videos on YouTube.

295
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:30,360
Yeah. 40 times, maybe it was an incredible time.

296
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,960
That was really what you really.

297
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:36,600
Yeah, it was just some of the greatest like one man shows that ever existed.

298
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:41,800
Letterman is doing 20 minute monologues on like relishing that Jay's antics.

299
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:45,160
And we're he his

300
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:49,600
not being sure what Jimmy Fallon's name was and calling him Lani Donoghain.

301
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,040
Yes, I will never forget Lani Donoghain.

302
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,440
Who's the kid?

303
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,600
Lani Donoghain, Lani Donoghain.

304
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:01,560
But what have you heard

305
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:05,640
about what is what is nefarious potentially actually happening here?

306
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:10,160
Well, that in general, I mean, I think whatever level like

307
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,160
I think that might be the correct thing.

308
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,000
It's like, well, let's see how this guy does.

309
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,160
The board will assess and then come 2021.

310
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,840
Does Eiger just re up again?

311
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,200
And they boot him.

312
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:26,120
Well, because there's been like there's no bench.

313
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:27,480
There's no bench.

314
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,800
It's like the Democratic Party.

315
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,160
There's a very minimal bet.

316
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,720
I was thinking there really should be a primary for this.

317
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,880
There should have been like a 10 person primary for Disney CEO

318
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,000
that shareholders would get to vote on because the content

319
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,520
we would get out of those debates.

320
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,440
Yes, host debate show.

321
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,400
Oh, my gosh. That's such a great idea.

322
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,680
All sorts of gobbling making promises.

323
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,960
Corporate hogwash.

324
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,320
There would have been a real like tech like, I don't know,

325
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:54,800
you call it progressive candidate who wanted to put or I guess

326
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:58,600
who would who would be the one who wants to put figment back in its proper?

327
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,200
I guess that might be a conservative candidate, honestly,

328
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,920
like Senators who just wants it to be like it was.

329
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:07,040
Yeah. Put Dreamfinder back in Journey to Imagination.

330
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,400
You try to figure out. Yeah, there would be a whole spectrum.

331
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:12,320
Some people would be like, we are leveling Epcot Center

332
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,240
and we're making it totally different.

333
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,080
The play pavilion sucks.

334
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:19,720
There would be a super progressive candidate who would say,

335
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:23,000
let's raise the the salaries of everybody who works at the parks.

336
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,160
And he wouldn't even get to the debate. Yeah, that's true.

337
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,400
Unlike Bernie, he's not even in the room.

338
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,280
No, he would have been like driven out into the middle of the woods somewhere.

339
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,240
Shot and shot.

340
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,880
Yeah, that's no we're talking about like what kind of robots

341
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,120
people would put in the park.

342
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,920
That's what people would be voting on me.

343
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,120
I'm a Rassolo, bro. Mm hmm.

344
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,360
I always thought Tom Staggs had a chance.

345
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:51,880
He got now that that came up in a lot of the articles.

346
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:56,040
Was that Staggs is being groomed and that at some point in 2016,

347
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:58,640
Eiger told him the board and I have lost our faith.

348
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:02,520
Yes, he did. It was like Gus on Breaking Bad with Victor

349
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,720
when he slices Victor's throat.

350
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,800
Victor doesn't even know it's coming. Yeah.

351
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,800
Staggs thought he was going to be the CEO.

352
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,960
And then they and because Eiger's done this so many times where it's like,

353
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,480
oh, I'm going to leave.

354
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,400
And then he doesn't.

355
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,720
And then, yes, it seems like they keep getting rid of candidates

356
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,840
for CEO. There.

357
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,080
I read a spooky thing.

358
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,200
One for Disney board members.

359
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,040
There's a mandatory retire age 74.

360
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:36,040
There is no mandatory retirement age for executive chairman.

361
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,680
And Eiger is not he's in his what?

362
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,520
He's 66, 67.

363
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:43,680
So he's got a few years left.

364
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:47,560
But then a lot of people just saying Chippec has the right combination

365
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:52,920
of worked for consumer products like the studio

366
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,960
and the theme parks and no one else covered a lot of ground.

367
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:01,120
A lot of it. That's true, because the listener may not know where this guy

368
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,240
came from. I believe he started in home video

369
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,560
and then became consumer products.

370
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:09,240
Or I saw something attributing the

371
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,560
I don't think he was the head of home video at this point,

372
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:18,080
but that he may have been involved in the process of putting things

373
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,240
in the Disney vault.

374
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,880
I think he's been a vault keeper.

375
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,400
He is the vault keeper.

376
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,600
That's what I found out that shocked me.

377
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,960
That Chippec is a whole keepers.

378
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:31,160
Supposedly spearheaded this in when he really in like the late

379
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:34,280
in the mid 90s when he he joined the company.

380
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,560
Wow. Huh.

381
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,120
The vault. I honestly. Wow.

382
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:40,680
Do I like him a little more now because he created the vault or is the vault?

383
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,840
Well, we like the vault.

384
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:45,200
Do we think the vault is cool because the vaults open now with Disney Plus?

385
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,320
Yeah. Weird that he's overseeing the company.

386
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,560
I don't think the vault.

387
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,760
I think the vault will close, though.

388
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,960
I don't think the vault is completely, completely.

389
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,640
First of all, there's a lot of stuff still in the vault. True.

390
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:59,520
So I think the vault is going to be sort of a fluid thing.

391
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:03,040
I think things will leave, go back into the vault from Disney Plus.

392
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,080
I don't know what I don't.

393
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:08,720
I mean, that's some of the excitement of Netflix and the other platforms

394
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,840
is what's new and what's leaving.

395
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:14,360
And yeah, if Disney Plus just consistently has a bunch of movies up,

396
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,400
that's not fun. Right.

397
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,840
That needs to be a constant ebb and flow. Right.

398
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:21,000
So, yeah, you need a good vault keeper.

399
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,160
I don't know who's doing it now, but obviously Chippec is overseeing it.

400
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:28,880
Though some of the more conspiratorial ideas

401
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:35,240
I've seen are that Disney is preparing for maybe some bad news,

402
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:38,200
some rough stuff because of the coronavirus.

403
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,600
We'll talk about this a little bit more later, probably.

404
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:44,880
You know, parks are closed in China and in Japan now.

405
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:50,040
And they are not like they're losing tons of money for millions

406
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:53,000
of millions of dollars, which are going to it's going to affect the park.

407
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:57,040
The conspiracy theories are maybe there's other stuff, too.

408
00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:00,280
Disney is like worried about like Disney Plus is doing like well,

409
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:03,960
but they haven't had a new show since Mandalorian. Right.

410
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:07,720
So it's like, excuse me, are you not watching Shop Class?

411
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:11,080
I am the show where children build shop class projects

412
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:14,080
hosted by Justin Long. Am I making this up?

413
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,800
I don't know. You said it so fast.

414
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,720
I think it's real. It's real. Yeah.

415
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,080
Yeah. You know, that would have been if you'd thrown in a fake stumble,

416
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,960
then I might have been wondered.

417
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,640
But you were pretty confident.

418
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,920
I'll keep that in mind for the future.

419
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,840
Are you watching? I've never heard of I've never heard of what you just said.

420
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:34,440
It's real. Are you watching the balloon artist, the show where they have

421
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:38,320
hot air balloons and they design and show they print out sort of

422
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:41,760
what the different characters and designs artists make for the front

423
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,960
of hot air balloons and Disney Plus? Oh, right.

424
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:46,240
You've seen that, right? With Tom Kavanaugh.

425
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,640
Tom Kavanaugh. Oh, Ed. Yeah.

426
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,800
TV's Ed. Yeah. Yeah.

427
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:50,760
And he's on The Flash.

428
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:54,200
And it's about how you design the fronts of giant hot air balloons

429
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,680
to really make a show.

430
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:58,280
Is there any other Disney Plus shows you guys have been watching that you like?

431
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,320
No, just those two.

432
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,280
The balloon artist

433
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:07,320
and shop. I'm trying to remember if there's

434
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:10,640
no, I mean, I'm too sleepy this morning to remember if there's another.

435
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,800
I like the nerd nest.

436
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,840
Zachary Levi's the nerd nest.

437
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:18,560
Oh, yeah. It's sort of your new home for all your nerd incubation.

438
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,120
Mm hmm. I'm watching Hula Hoop Wars.

439
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,720
Are you seeing that?

440
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,720
How about the National Hula Hoop Championship?

441
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:27,120
I didn't even know that existed.

442
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,320
But thanks to.

443
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,040
Half Life was a poor choice.

444
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:32,160
Oh, yeah. But he's been replaced by Caroline Ray.

445
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,000
Oh, that's good. I like that.

446
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,560
So she's hosting the Hula Hoop.

447
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,520
That's a little more audience.

448
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:38,600
Yeah. So anyway, that's just a few.

449
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,840
The Mickey Mouse Hula Hoops are fun, but they don't.

450
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,400
They don't spin super well.

451
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,240
No, they've got that counterbalanced.

452
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,640
Half a loop and then a half a loop.

453
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,080
It doesn't. You're not getting more than three shapes out of that thing.

454
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,320
But otherwise, it's a pretty fun show.

455
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,840
Yeah. Great show, I think.

456
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:59,520
So, yeah. So Chaypeck is so according.

457
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:03,400
Some people are thinking maybe this is sort of a safety measure

458
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:08,440
to protect Dagger, because people in corporate structures take falls all the time.

459
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,320
People are set up for things.

460
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:14,280
If something like numbers go bad, people like to point from my understanding.

461
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:17,560
People like to point fingers at somebody and say, well, they're the problem

462
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:20,640
that is this is the problem with the company right now.

463
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,840
And then they get fired and they take the hit.

464
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:25,320
Well, similar to if we're going back to the Leno

465
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:30,840
Conan thing, Conan had to take over the Tonight Show when NBC had the corona

466
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,240
virus of primetime lineups. Yes.

467
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:40,520
Leno oversaw a virus free era of it was a totally sanitized,

468
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:43,920
clean run through the 90s.

469
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:46,560
And then, yeah, I mean, the Jay Leno show

470
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:49,880
ultimately became the most severe case of coronavirus.

471
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:52,440
TV coronavirus.

472
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:55,680
So, yeah, people are thinking, oh, this might be a safety measure

473
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:59,920
also in the sense that if like the company really like takes a huge

474
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:04,840
hit financially this year, that they can just like say, well, it's Chaypeck's fault.

475
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,240
Blame it on him and Eiger goes right back in.

476
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:10,640
Someone else, I believe, already took the fall for the weak

477
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:14,040
galaxy's edge, kind of like opening it without Rod.

478
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:16,520
Yes, yes. Now it seems like it's balanced out.

479
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,440
What's that woman's name? I forget the woman.

480
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:21,440
There was a woman who got fired, who people were saying was taking the hit

481
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,520
for like Galaxy's Edge, not being like the blowout money.

482
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:27,560
They knew Chaypeck was the going to be the guy.

483
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:30,480
Maybe he certainly couldn't be him to take the fall.

484
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:36,200
Right. And I guess what we've learned is that the plan of trying to oust Chaypeck

485
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:41,640
by writing a new article posing as a sick former

486
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,240
Disney blogger who hasn't posted anything in a decade.

487
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:51,000
That was not a good plan for ousting an eventual CEO.

488
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:55,000
No. In case you don't know what we're talking about.

489
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,120
I'm not sure I know what I'm talking about.

490
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:01,440
Well, if you would just let us do a three hour conspiracy written episode.

491
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,360
Yeah, look, look up.

492
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,760
Yeah. You know what?

493
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,680
We've talked about we've talked about it before.

494
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,560
Tweeted us in a little refresher.

495
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:12,760
Just Google talk to you at a bar for hours.

496
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,920
Al Lutz, Bob Chaypeck article.

497
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:19,320
And you'll find our thing where, yeah, a guy we all read in middle school.

498
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,440
Al Lutz. Or maybe you did.

499
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,280
I got in middle school.

500
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:25,680
I was a little I was a little I was not mature enough for Al Lutz.

501
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:28,480
His writing. They got racy.

502
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,360
Yeah. But this blogger who would like they like

503
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:35,400
apparently hasn't been writing for a long time and is like bedridden.

504
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:41,320
And people like are using his name to try to spread rumors and yes.

505
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:44,960
And spread the word that your Abbey situation.

506
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,040
Mm hmm. Yes. Yeah. Yeah, totally.

507
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:51,080
And that that was like because they wrote a scandalous article.

508
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:54,600
They wrote an article like ripping the lid off of that.

509
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:58,200
It's Chaypeck who'd made all of those cuts on Galaxy's edge.

510
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,360
And that's why it's not.

511
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,640
But that feels like another era now that rise.

512
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,760
The resistance is kind of making it all work.

513
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:08,160
And yeah. And the other thing is, despite attendance being down slightly,

514
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:11,320
even as those numbers were coming out, revenue was up,

515
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:16,200
which I think is what happens when you just raise ticket prices annually

516
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:20,160
and you just kind of gradually raise the price on food and merchandise

517
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:23,400
a little at a time when people aren't paying attention.

518
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:27,200
And you suddenly start selling two hundred dollar lightsabers,

519
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:32,280
two hundred dollar lightsabers, a new like here's the color of the season.

520
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,720
Like color. We're doing colors now. Like

521
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:39,000
I I was trying to.

522
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:44,000
You know, we've we've we've kind of painted Chaypeck as a villain

523
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,760
on the show before. Right.

524
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:48,760
And we should say this his position that he was in,

525
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:51,840
which is head of Parks and Resorts, then head of consumer products

526
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,640
when they merged, is always a villain slot.

527
00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:00,320
That's always where, you know, any complaints you have,

528
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:04,000
you turn your eye or to that sort of press.

529
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,280
Pressler, pressler, ran in the 90s, was very like merch heavy

530
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:10,800
and opened the, you know, some of these bad.

531
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:14,040
Yes. Like Magic California Adventure original.

532
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:18,200
He's obviously the yes, the best version of the villain in this slot.

533
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,440
But yes, you're yes.

534
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,640
These guys, I think, because has there been a female? I don't know.

535
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,320
Who is Cynthia Harris?

536
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,040
What did she like?

537
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:33,480
She was a good I get confused as to what parks position any of these people are.

538
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:37,080
Right. Because Parks was its own thing until about two years ago

539
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:41,200
when they combined into consumer products and experiences

540
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,280
and parks and resorts.

541
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:47,600
That all became under one umbrella, seemingly because for Chaypeck.

542
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:50,480
Like those were the things Chaypeck had experience with.

543
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,200
He had done consumer products.

544
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:57,080
He had done parks. Chaypeck also, while during

545
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:02,160
under like the home video sort of oversaw the buddy series,

546
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:07,280
the the airbugs and I think everyone was impressed

547
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,560
that he made something out of nothing.

548
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:11,680
Like those movies cost nothing to make.

549
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,240
There's no star.

550
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,960
There's no recognizable actor in anybody.

551
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,520
Maybe they had like a novelty Santa Claus and one of them, you know,

552
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:22,120
they they pulled the Ed Asner strings or something.

553
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:24,560
But besides that, cute, cute animals.

554
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,440
Disney has a history with cute animals.

555
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:29,360
And then that kind of heightened to

556
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,400
affect the company as a whole.

557
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:35,160
It seems like Chaypeck helping drive it.

558
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:38,880
But Iger kind of seeing the big picture of making the company

559
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,480
more franchise and brand focused

560
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:46,160
and Chaypeck being one of the like lieutenants,

561
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,280
one one of the captains.

562
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:54,320
By the way, I just I looked it up in Santa Buddies.

563
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:55,040
Oh, is that you?

564
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:57,000
I know I have Cynthia Harris. OK.

565
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,800
Oh, I'd rather hear about Santa Buddies.

566
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,120
Sure. Who was the others?

567
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,120
She had a couple of different.

568
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:04,640
She was senior vice president of park operations at Disney.

569
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,840
She president of the Disney Store chain.

570
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,640
She was a president of Disneyland.

571
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,640
That's a merch person and a theme park.

572
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:13,160
Yeah, I don't think she was never head of parks and resorts.

573
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,960
I see. I see. OK.

574
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:18,200
They did pull out all the stops for Santa Buddies and they

575
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:21,640
because you hallmark lifetime straight to video.

576
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:22,800
You got to get a good Santa.

577
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:25,000
And in this one, it was George Wendt.

578
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,360
Excellent Santa. Yes.

579
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:29,480
If you're if you're a heavier actor, you have to do your Santa duty

580
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,520
at some point in time.

581
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:33,720
And George did it in this and probably several other things.

582
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,280
I I'm not sure.

583
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:40,760
And Santa Paws, Santa's dog in that movie voiced by Tom Bosley

584
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:43,680
for his final role before his demise.

585
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:46,360
Wow. He went out as Santa Paws.

586
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:52,280
Tom Bosley, of course, Happy Days and the voice of David the gnome.

587
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,840
Yes. And on Broadway,

588
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,680
I believe, was Maurice.

589
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:02,720
Oh, yeah. And the beast looks like many times kindly old man.

590
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:06,560
I also father Dowling, of course, the murder solving

591
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,000
the murder solving priest priest.

592
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:13,120
Cool. So I put all of this under the, you know,

593
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:17,600
chapec may be responsible for the casting of Bosley and went

594
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,360
at the end of the day.

595
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,320
He at least gave it the general thumbs up.

596
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,600
Can't be mad at him for that.

597
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:26,280
Yeah. And I was trying to think about it.

598
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:30,840
If we villainize this man, I probably do to the, you know,

599
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:34,520
this this dry consumer product side that he has.

600
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:37,840
And the if we if we sense that some of that early

601
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:41,840
Galaxy's Edge problematic nature was due to him and his budget cuts.

602
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,120
I guess that's why we villainized him.

603
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,320
But I'm like, let me look at this guy's whole history

604
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,680
to see if he's going to be a good CEO or not.

605
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,880
And then we got to go back to before Disney.

606
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,880
Do you know what he did before Disney?

607
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,240
I don't. I read it.

608
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:56,400
I forget. And it was it was a brand.

609
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:57,840
Yes. Yeah.

610
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:01,200
He says he's been with Disney in some regard since 1993.

611
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:05,800
And before that, he was he worked in brand management for the H.J.

612
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,120
Heinz Company.

613
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:11,640
He worked for Heinz Ketchup and other Heinz products.

614
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:14,160
So beans were under his purview.

615
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:16,240
I guess various mustards and relishes.

616
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,560
Yeah. Jason, you get a little more respect for this guy now.

617
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:23,120
I mean, they do have 57 varieties that they have to manage and deal with.

618
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:27,960
And this is during your child, you know, like when you were five, six, seven,

619
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:31,240
your earliest hot dogs were top condiments that shape.

620
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,320
Was part of at least making your family aware of.

621
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:37,600
I currently talked with those condiments, probably as well.

622
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:41,000
Wow. So he's grown a couple sizes.

623
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:41,720
I live in your heart.

624
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:44,560
Ketchup kid. But I did like Ketchup.

625
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,120
Jason and the ketchup kids.

626
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,760
Jason is coming to Disney.

627
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:51,000
Jason Jordan is the ketchup kid.

628
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,920
I still like I look sideways at like

629
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:57,440
non Heinz Ketchup or like house made ketchup.

630
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,120
I'm like, oh, fuck.

631
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,680
Really? Oh, hunts hunts doesn't sit right.

632
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:03,880
Yeah, that doesn't hit right.

633
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:06,680
Some places like really nice place that make their own ketchup.

634
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:11,720
It's it's Chipotle ketchup or something really, really hot and cold

635
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:14,160
on flavored Ketchup's. Really? Yeah.

636
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,120
You're just a straight ahead Heinz guy.

637
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:18,840
Again, if it's house made, maybe better.

638
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:24,200
But if it's in a jar and it's like flavored ketchup, it's going to be discussed.

639
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,600
That's interesting because as a fellow member of the sauce squad,

640
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:30,360
the chicken guy sauce squad, I am surprised that you wouldn't be more open

641
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,120
to different ketchup.

642
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:34,840
Well, I mean, you get a certain level of quality.

643
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:38,120
There's a quality assurance along with the sauce squad, I feel like.

644
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,320
Well, I agree with that.

645
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:42,760
But I'm saying just I would think you would be more open to trying.

646
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:45,200
You would be a little bit more open minded, a little more progressive

647
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,240
when it comes to your ketchup.

648
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:51,640
I am if it's made by the people, if it's mass produced, it's probably good.

649
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,120
It might be gross.

650
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:56,120
But you love the most mass produced one.

651
00:33:57,080 --> 00:34:00,240
Uh, well, I do need some.

652
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:01,560
You've been caught.

653
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:03,000
No, but that's just regular.

654
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:03,920
That's regular.

655
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:04,800
I don't want to say.

656
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:08,480
But if there's an experimental kind, you want it to be a mom,

657
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:12,480
pocket, shirning ketchup and a big you want to get a ketchup churn.

658
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,760
Yeah, that's oh, yeah.

659
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:17,160
I really like ketchup churners on Disney Plus.

660
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:19,320
Oh, I have seen ketchup churners is good.

661
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,720
Yeah, it's it's hosted by

662
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,120
trying to think of the cast of.

663
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,160
Well, that's good.

664
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:29,640
Yeah, I was trying to think of who is the star of empty nest.

665
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,000
What's the guy?

666
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,880
Richard Mulligan, Richard Mulligan.

667
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,080
He I believe has passed away.

668
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,520
So he was on a show.

669
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:37,840
It's an old show they brought back.

670
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:40,040
OK. Oh, they shot it a while ago.

671
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:44,120
So yeah. Oh, we're confused because most of your heart hosts the new one.

672
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:46,880
But they also show the old the 90s episode

673
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:49,360
of Ketchup Churners was hosted by Richard Mulligan.

674
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:52,000
Yeah, great show. But Jason can't watch it because Disney Plus

675
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,160
and Disney Plus is really good.

676
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:55,400
They got so much.

677
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,800
I'm interested with your ketchup philosophy, though.

678
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:58,560
It's interesting.

679
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:01,200
Heinz. Yeah, Heinz suffer through hunts.

680
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:04,800
So you were enthusiastic to vote for John Kerry in that election

681
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:08,760
because of his wife is one of the things like Theresa Heinz Kerry.

682
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:12,920
Yeah. Yeah. When shape back worked at Heinz,

683
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:16,160
I was looking up a timeline of what was going on with Heinz when he worked there.

684
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:21,040
And there was a tragic plane crash that killed whoever was going to be the heir

685
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:25,320
to like one of the Heinz family was going to be the heir to the fortune.

686
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:30,040
And thus in their death, it was passed to John Kerry's wife.

687
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,440
To really? Yeah.

688
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,840
So is shape part of that plane crash?

689
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,640
I think it's fair to say definitely.

690
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:39,400
Definitely. Yes. Yes.

691
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:42,560
I was. It's hard to tell what he I don't know when he started

692
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:46,960
at Heinz, so, you know, forgive me for not being too like official here with any of this.

693
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:50,840
But I was just like, let me find some commercials that Heinz put out in this era.

694
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:54,600
So and again, I don't know his position exactly,

695
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:59,440
but he was there when Heinz introduced real Ghostbusters pasta.

696
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,360
Can't be mad at that.

697
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:05,480
Had, you know, pieces that looked like Slimer and other ghosts and stuff.

698
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:09,080
And that that seemed like it was was probably well received as a very cool commercial.

699
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:16,440
And in 1989, there was a Heinz commercial where a guy puts a ketchup bottle

700
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:21,680
way up on top of a building at a slight incline and then goes down and buys a hot dog

701
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,040
and kind of like impresses a girl. Hey, what's up?

702
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:28,960
And and then gets the hot dog just in time for the ketchup to finally drop

703
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,840
all the way off the building because it moves so slowly.

704
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:34,640
They were pushing out so rich that it moves so slowly.

705
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:38,040
And the guy in that commercial was a young Matt LeBlanc.

706
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,640
Wow. Really? In 89.

707
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:44,040
Good. So I so can we say that Bob Chapek discovered Matt LeBlanc?

708
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,640
Yes, I think we can.

709
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:47,840
And definitively, there's ups and downs.

710
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:51,320
There's the crash, but there's also LeBlanc.

711
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,680
I think we can firmly say this is all.

712
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,560
So I don't know.

713
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,400
This pros and cons. Judge how you will.

714
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:00,040
And that was a positive that the ketchup took so long,

715
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:02,680
because generally that's a complaint with a glass bottle of ketchup,

716
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:04,440
is that it's hard to get the ketchup out.

717
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:09,440
They were presenting it where slowly pouring ketchup is good.

718
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:13,360
But they also present that it just will naturally come out

719
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:17,000
and that you don't need to bang on the back, which doesn't feel correct to me.

720
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:21,120
There's another one from 91 where a bunch of CGI ants

721
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:25,960
all have time, slow moving ants have time to tip a bottle

722
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,880
and then steal a hot dog.

723
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,560
Jason's worst nightmare.

724
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:32,840
A bunch of ants would all carry a hot dog away together.

725
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,560
Well, are they bringing the hot dog to?

726
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:37,000
Are they? They could also be my allies.

727
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,080
I must hang them off or something.

728
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:41,400
You got to form a deal.

729
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,560
What's in it for them?

730
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,240
A big chunk of cracker.

731
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:46,280
You sure? Yeah, they probably know that.

732
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:48,760
When people ask, like, what superpower would you want, Jason?

733
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:51,280
You always say Ant Man, because you imagine that you could control

734
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,760
an army of ants to steal hot dogs from a picnic.

735
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:58,600
To bring a bottle for you, saving arm strength.

736
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:05,320
It's so hard to get that backyard barbecue flavor, you know, so much work.

737
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,920
Jason Sheridan's Ant Man.

738
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:09,480
It's just you sitting waiting for ants to bring you food.

739
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:12,160
Read the paper, read the LA Times.

740
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,800
Come, my pretties.

741
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:19,760
But I also in looking up his history, I discovered that

742
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:23,400
he is an alumni of Indiana University.

743
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:28,200
And it's been a big week in general for Indiana University alumni,

744
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:35,200
because fellow IU alum Mike Pence was put in charge of the coronavirus.

745
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:40,680
So Disney and the coronavirus, both in the hands of esteemed alums.

746
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,520
Of that, yeah.

747
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:46,240
Yeah, I believe I can trust in the Indianans to take care of this.

748
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:49,560
I believe I partied at that college one night. Really?

749
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,760
Yeah, my friend was there. We went took a trip.

750
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:54,200
Whoa. I didn't party with Pence. I'm not that old.

751
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:56,800
I don't. Yeah, I don't think Pence would have been there.

752
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,120
JPEG.

753
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:01,920
It's a good lineup of, by the way, Howard Ashman, writer.

754
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,880
Oh, yeah. Of your world and such.

755
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,480
Yeah. Yeah. Isn't that weird?

756
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:07,760
Yeah, it is. A lot of Disney history.

757
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:12,480
I toured Indiana University of Pennsylvania, which is a second,

758
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:14,960
confusingly named college.

759
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:18,960
It is in a small town where Jimmy Stewart was born.

760
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:22,160
Oh, they have a little storefront, Jimmy Stewart Museum.

761
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,880
Didn't that wasn't enough to sell you that? No.

762
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,600
Hmm. What were you looking for?

763
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:31,360
I was looking for a town with a like a little more.

764
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:34,200
It was a very small town.

765
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:36,480
Like you're looking for a bigger town.

766
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:41,280
I like I think I had more like had like little theaters and, you know,

767
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:44,000
indie movie theaters and bookstores.

768
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,120
Yeah, a little more culture.

769
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,800
You don't want to be trapped into little.

770
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:50,760
Pennsylvania has a lot of cute little small towns with colleges in them.

771
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:54,680
But like every now and then I would ask, like tour them.

772
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,800
And ask, like, what do you guys do on the weekends?

773
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,680
Or like we go to Wal-Mart and I'm like, that sounds sad.

774
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:01,600
Why did you say that? That sounds sad.

775
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,960
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

776
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:06,000
That's that's a boring college existence, probably.

777
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,080
And you were you had you were inspired because of Mr.

778
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,800
Eiger, who had gone there before you.

779
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:16,120
Oh, of course. I love the head of ABC, who I learned while at ABC,

780
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:19,560
canceled both Twin Peaks and 30 something.

781
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:23,480
But put Cop Rock on the air.

782
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:26,840
30 somethings true coming back and Twin Peaks, of course, already back.

783
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:29,080
Already back. Is there something definitely coming back?

784
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,600
There's somebody is coming back. There's a revival of 30 something.

785
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,760
Can I put this into the universe right now?

786
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:37,880
There is not a single piece of announced media

787
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:44,080
that is more exciting to my mother that I be a part of than the 30 something reboot.

788
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:46,320
You and I have to get on that 30 something.

789
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,760
Why would you be on it?

790
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,480
Because I'm 30 something.

791
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:53,200
Yeah. And my mom loves the original 30 something so much.

792
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,240
Busfield. That's a Timothy Busfield show.

793
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:56,800
He was on the original.

794
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:57,640
I don't know. Did he direct?

795
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:00,640
We got to get on the party. Five is back on free form.

796
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:04,320
I'm just saying if you're involved in the 30 something just to make my mother happy,

797
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:08,640
please, this is like the Chris Getherd article about him hosting Kelly Ripa's

798
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:11,080
show. Look that up if you've seen it.

799
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:13,800
I want to be on TV for my mother, not for me.

800
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:16,080
It's not for you. It's not for me.

801
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:17,440
It'd be a fun thing.

802
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,760
My mom likes the show.

803
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,280
So do that for me.

804
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:25,800
So she was when you're a child and she's like, someday he'll be 30 something.

805
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:27,840
And then my dream.

806
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,960
Yeah. If they do a new one.

807
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:33,160
I don't think she was thinking that long term, but I think she was she was like,

808
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:35,320
oh, that show I loved is coming back.

809
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:40,360
Oh, my son is a podcaster and he's 30 something.

810
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:41,640
He could be on that show.

811
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,120
So if they have a character who's like

812
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:54,280
dealing with the relatable 30 something problem of which toys are you going to eBay?

813
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:55,280
Right.

814
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:59,400
And also being one of those characters could be a podcaster.

815
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:05,200
I mean, they all shows are contractually obligated to have a podcaster character now.

816
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:09,320
So I assume the two creators of 30 something will listen to this.

817
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:11,320
Sure. Where is that going?

818
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:12,320
I don't know.

819
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:13,320
ABC or Hulu?

820
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:14,320
I couldn't tell you.

821
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:15,920
Did you get maybe it's on free?

822
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:20,800
Have you guys ever looked at free freeform is like everything conservatives

823
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:24,480
think the culture wars are is on freeform.

824
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:27,240
It's like party of five.

825
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:31,000
But the parents are illegal immigrants and get deported.

826
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:35,520
And the five the kids all have to take care of each other like it.

827
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:38,360
Or it's young people.

828
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:42,480
It shows about like young people and they are all very horny.

829
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:45,920
Like that is where Disney simultaneously very clean.

830
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:51,440
But then it has like horny stuff on freeform and also The Bachelor,

831
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:55,560
the horniest show on television, the weirdest horny because it's horny.

832
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:57,800
But there's a lot of hoops. You got to jump through.

833
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:03,960
It is very extremely popular prime time show that is about like hookups and fucking.

834
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:06,040
It is weirdly. Yes.

835
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:11,320
Hookups and then inevitably one or two characters who are like, I'm Christian.

836
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:12,320
I don't do that.

837
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:15,040
Like it's very.

838
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:18,400
It's a very bizarre, very, very bizarre because like, you know,

839
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:24,240
the a quick gay kiss has to be a microsecond long

840
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:26,240
and then edited out most countries.

841
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:29,880
And then there's just a prime time show where like the whole premise is like

842
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,920
a guy has sex with like like 12 women.

843
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:36,320
But who will be fucked tonight?

844
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:40,560
And then the other half of the year, a woman has sex with 20 men.

845
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:41,960
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

846
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:43,880
And it's like, I'm not even I'm not even saying

847
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:46,120
I don't have to be against any of it.

848
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:48,240
Just feels like maybe this isn't the same.

849
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:51,000
Maybe now we're holding everything to the same standard here.

850
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:55,160
Yeah. Of whatever their decency, whatever they think is decency.

851
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:57,240
This brings up another story.

852
00:43:57,240 --> 00:44:02,280
So like I have another handful of stories that we're not even going to get to.

853
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:05,280
And I'm just going to kind of divvy them out or I'll just get to whatever

854
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,160
we don't get to at the end. Sure.

855
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:08,560
Quick bites. Quick bites.

856
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:10,760
These are quick. This is a quick story.

857
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:12,600
A quick unnerving bite.

858
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:16,120
But when you say like editing stuff out for some countries,

859
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:20,880
this like in the last couple of weeks, Disney got flack

860
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:26,560
because so in India, there's a very popular streaming service called Hotstar,

861
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:29,240
which Disney has operational control of.

862
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:33,560
And they did not air a John Oliver episode

863
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:36,280
because it was critical of Modi,

864
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:41,200
the prime minister, I believe, of India president.

865
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:44,160
He's a piece of shit.

866
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:49,720
He's a fucking he's linked to at this point, maybe multiple genocides.

867
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:54,360
Not a good guy

868
00:44:54,360 --> 00:45:00,320
is implementing a very odd religious citizenship law.

869
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:02,000
Nasty stuff going on.

870
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,560
But sort of the same thing that happened with that Hassan Minhaj show

871
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:09,160
happened at Indy, it happened with the streaming service in India,

872
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:12,280
where they're just like Disney is wait owns or as a big part in this

873
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:15,280
Hotstar streaming service that was showing it. Oh, God.

874
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:18,160
So that is another thing that

875
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:21,040
he is inheriting.

876
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:22,200
That's that's creepy.

877
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:26,320
But are they are they still showing the hula hoop wars show?

878
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:29,240
They are. That is a very pro Modi show. OK.

879
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:34,160
Got it. Yeah, this is an aerial shot where lots of hula

880
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:37,040
hoopers spell out the word Modi. OK.

881
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:39,760
Well, that's yeah, there's a whole Hindu nationalist episode.

882
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:41,200
Oh, I like that. That's good.

883
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:47,480
Modi also were recording this in the wake of the Lizzie McGuire.

884
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:49,960
Oh, yeah. They've been trying to break it.

885
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:52,640
They were bringing it back and then just suddenly it went away.

886
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:55,120
The creator was fired and nobody really knew why.

887
00:45:55,360 --> 00:46:00,920
And now Hillary Duff implying that it was kind of due to Disney

888
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:06,520
moralism and that they were not OK with portraying a 30 year old woman.

889
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:10,840
I mean, probably having sex and I think it was that they were realizing

890
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:15,080
it should have been on the Hulu side of the line,

891
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:19,000
which if we're all paying attention to this math, Disney plus is where

892
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,160
family friendly things go. Hulu is the touchstone.

893
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:24,280
Hulu is where more adult things go.

894
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:28,560
And they were that's I don't remember her quote, but it sort of implied

895
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:34,080
that they wanted Lizzie McGuire to still be like a child despite being right.

896
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:37,160
Grown up. And it would be so bizarre to do anything.

897
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:42,640
Yeah, I think that I think that they there Disney might be a bit confused.

898
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:46,360
They need it. They need it's a big property

899
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:49,280
that would give a boost to Disney Plus. Yeah.

900
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:54,240
But if it's Lizzie McGuire at 30, it doesn't make sense.

901
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:58,040
If you want it to be a 30 year old woman lives in the city.

902
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:01,520
She's you know, what do you want to do?

903
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:03,480
What do you have sex in her cartoon?

904
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:05,920
Her cartoon tune?

905
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:09,280
The conscience is having sex as well with other cartoon conscious.

906
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:10,400
Is that the compromise?

907
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:13,760
Is the cartoon get to be horny and naked?

908
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:16,640
Is she I think that makes it more

909
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:18,920
it does not call like it's a lot more adult with that.

910
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:21,160
You're not calling for nudity on the show, right?

911
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:23,680
Well, we don't know. We haven't heard Hillary Dove's full thoughts on.

912
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:26,360
OK, who knows?

913
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:27,880
Well, because maybe, yeah, maybe that doesn't.

914
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:30,600
If it was like a full like naked show, maybe that doesn't.

915
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:32,320
Does she want girls?

916
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:33,880
Does she want to? Yeah.

917
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:35,600
Lizzie McGuire's girls.

918
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:38,480
Yeah, maybe that is more of a hulu show than I don't know.

919
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:42,400
Lizzie McGuire accidentally takes Molly in this episode, you know,

920
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:47,040
goes on an adventure, stays out all night, loves the New York City.

921
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:49,080
You know, all right.

922
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:51,600
And if New York City is going to be a character,

923
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:54,080
you know, it's always a character in movies.

924
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:55,360
I do know that.

925
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:57,720
I do know that New York City is always a character.

926
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:03,440
So here's what I have as far as far as Chaypike.

927
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:06,640
I love unsourced crazy rumors.

928
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:08,440
We love to see it. Yeah.

929
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:11,080
And I've seen some we've seen there was some rumor like, oh,

930
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:13,040
Iger's going to get into politics.

931
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:15,160
I don't think that's happening. He's still around.

932
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:17,720
Also would be the worst timing in the world.

933
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:20,200
We're recording this like days before Super Tuesday.

934
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:21,560
He's not going to be on the ballot.

935
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:23,440
Hard to start. Yes.

936
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:25,600
Yeah. Before an editor.

937
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:29,880
If you want if you want to talk top Bloomberg, you come in so late.

938
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:31,560
It's post. Right.

939
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:33,040
You're not even in any of the voting.

940
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:37,280
Well, an editor at Pace magazine spoke that curse into existence of like,

941
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:41,280
oh, no, is this going to be a Bloomberg Iger ticket, which is like

942
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:45,760
that's that's not even a mad that's just sucking the air out of the room.

943
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:49,160
Whatever the inverse of charisma is like. All right.

944
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:53,440
Let's know. Does anyone like who is that for?

945
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:54,880
Yeah, I don't think that's happening.

946
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:56,120
But you never know.

947
00:48:56,120 --> 00:49:00,200
We never know what's going to happen if there's a contested convention.

948
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:03,400
But anyway, I don't think the politics is happening.

949
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:05,840
There were some other things, paranoid things.

950
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:09,040
But this is my favorite that I've read online.

951
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:11,800
Again, this is from a doesn't matter.

952
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:14,960
It really doesn't matter because there's no way to prove that this is true.

953
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,880
OK, it's from a message board.

954
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:20,160
It's a Twitter user at Figment,

955
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:23,280
underscore Jedi and says, take a grain of salt.

956
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:26,120
But this is the this is the rumor they saw on the message board.

957
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:27,840
They're they didn't write this. OK.

958
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:32,280
The rumor from what I've heard is that Cameron and Landau,

959
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:36,840
James Cameron and John Landau are demanding an extra one billion dollars

960
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:38,600
for the Avatar sequels.

961
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:41,760
Bob went to the board on this and they basically said, you've gone soft.

962
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:43,520
Chaypeck is taking over.

963
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:47,080
Cameron and Landauer apparently using some consulting firm outside of Disney

964
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:50,480
that is totally off the record, making the mouse even more angry.

965
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:52,720
Could be something to do with Murdoch Fox.

966
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:54,440
Making the mouth fucking hate that.

967
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:57,040
Mm hmm. I know that's always met message board.

968
00:49:57,400 --> 00:49:58,920
That's the most that word.

969
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:01,920
Yeah. So Iger and Cameron were friends.

970
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:04,320
Cameron and Chaypeck are not.

971
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:06,160
The board did not like that.

972
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:08,400
That's the last bit of this. Whoa.

973
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:13,840
Avatar, the endless wait for Avatar sequels may have brought down.

974
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:20,480
Iger writes that they were working for a company that was fixing avatar prices.

975
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:28,520
So there's a little before that, there's a little here.

976
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:30,720
Somebody wrote a different like an addendum.

977
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:34,600
They work in finance, close friends with a lot of the E.A.s,

978
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:37,280
which is what executive assistance, I assume, for the board.

979
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:40,920
Apparently, been a lot of meetings lately between Bob Iger and James Cameron

980
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:44,280
about Avatar sequel funding, something to do with how much the marketing

981
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:46,280
budget is promised to be in control of the IP.

982
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:48,840
Cameron met with Bob on the 21st of February.

983
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,040
Bob met with the board on the 24th.

984
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:54,320
Chaypeck given Bob's job literally the day after.

985
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:57,200
Just give them the money. You have the money.

986
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:59,840
It's the second biggest movie of all time.

987
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:04,080
I will say only by the first biggest movie of all time, which you also made.

988
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:06,600
Yeah, I do. It is interesting.

989
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:10,560
I mean, it's a good it's a good rumor because of the fact that

990
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:15,240
we've been promised these avatar, much like Bob Iger leaving the company.

991
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:18,960
It's been the goalpost has been moved so many times for the sequels.

992
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:21,360
How much money the sequels cost?

993
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:24,080
They were supposed to come out, what, seven years, six years ago.

994
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:26,200
But now isn't it supposed to come out right before?

995
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:30,120
Is it now we're talking about the month that Iger leaves? Right.

996
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:33,200
Twenty twenty one like Christmas twenty twenty one.

997
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:36,160
He can absolve himself of any. Right.

998
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:38,960
And I think I'm assuming because they've put they're shooting what?

999
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:41,800
Two back to back. Yeah. The next two back to back.

1000
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:44,640
I assume they're eight and nine by this point.

1001
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:48,160
Uh huh. I'm sure there's some anxiety in the Disney company about like,

1002
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:50,200
is this going to work?

1003
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:53,720
Mm hmm. I would imagine now never bet against Cameron.

1004
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:55,240
Of course, never bet against Cameron.

1005
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:57,360
But he is this is like now

1006
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:02,040
and it's saying this feels like now we're like six times.

1007
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:06,000
It's a six times bigger bet than it's been. Yes.

1008
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:08,240
And again, I didn't think of it.

1009
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:11,480
I before Avatar came out, I was like, maybe this is the one that finally

1010
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:13,480
he doesn't care. And then look what happens.

1011
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:15,440
But boy, it's been a long time.

1012
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:19,120
So a billion dollars spread over five movies isn't.

1013
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:21,360
Well, but I think it's more.

1014
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:23,480
But I think it's more and it's not five.

1015
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:27,240
I think this is probably I would imagine they because they're only shooting two.

1016
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:31,280
So again, if this is this is why it's a good rumor, because you can imagine

1017
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:34,560
that there would be economic anxiety about these giant movies

1018
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:37,800
that I'm sure they've invested a billion dollars in already.

1019
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:39,880
Yeah, I'm sure it's a billion dollar.

1020
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:44,520
Like and obviously, like they bought they took on like debt as well,

1021
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:48,920
because now they fully bought Avatar once the Fox sale happened.

1022
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:54,360
And then they already had their the Avatar land was delayed for years as well.

1023
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:57,000
So cost probably a billion and cost a ton of money.

1024
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:00,800
So it's a good rumor in the sense that you can believe something like it is possible.

1025
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:03,720
But I like the idea that Iger was

1026
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:07,680
canned because the board said he went soft.

1027
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:11,360
I don't think the board is that cutthroat

1028
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:15,800
because Iger has been such a loyal like soldier for so long.

1029
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:20,680
I feel like that that is such a turn on on him.

1030
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:24,240
And right after his book where he's going around talking about everything

1031
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:26,560
he's done at Disney and praising Disney.

1032
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:28,560
I mean, I look, I don't know.

1033
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:30,800
I'm not sure. I think it's a fun rumor.

1034
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:32,320
That is very funny.

1035
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:34,400
It's very exciting corporate intrigue.

1036
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:38,800
I think that Iger has as much whatever criticism you have of him

1037
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:41,760
has like dumped a ton of money at a ton of things.

1038
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:45,280
Yeah, it doesn't seem like he gets hit with the like cheap

1039
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:48,680
like label as much as like a chipac does.

1040
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:53,240
I don't know if that's just like PR spin, but like the California Adventure redo,

1041
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:55,480
like he put a ton of money into that.

1042
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:59,440
The budget's for initially for like, I mean, Galaxy's edge have blown way up.

1043
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:03,120
But like, obviously, that was a huge budget thing that was probably

1044
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:05,600
I guess chipac announced it.

1045
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:07,840
But that was right at the start of his like tenure.

1046
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,920
This guy loves slinging billions.

1047
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:11,880
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

1048
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:15,680
I feel like it does feel like Bob Iger loves slinging billions.

1049
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:19,880
He's got to walk in next to Ackerman and Giamatti, right?

1050
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:25,000
So I I like it.

1051
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:29,320
Yeah, but also it's a bizarre like we will now punish you by making you not CEO,

1052
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:32,080
but rather this slightly diminished role

1053
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:35,640
that you will get to stay in through the end of next year. Right.

1054
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:38,280
Well, it's a it is a it's a half measure.

1055
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:43,120
It's a hedging to if that again, if it's indeed a real head by the mouse.

1056
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:45,400
Mm hmm. The mouse.

1057
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:48,360
Everybody uses that on this Disney message boards.

1058
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:53,800
The utility bill is due at the House of Mouse and someone's a little short.

1059
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:58,920
The mouse is like the month and rent is calling.

1060
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:03,360
The mouse is like Wacko Jacko, like the same tabloid.

1061
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:05,560
Yeah, yeah.

1062
00:55:05,560 --> 00:55:06,440
The mouse is new.

1063
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:10,040
Skyn. You know that phrase about sitcoms?

1064
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:12,480
Yes. You know, it's sitcom.

1065
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:14,560
God, I'm so tired by the end of that word.

1066
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:16,080
It takes forever to say that word.

1067
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:17,640
Isn't there a quicker way to say it?

1068
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:20,200
Skyn. Great. Done.

1069
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:22,560
Clear. Everyone gets it as soon as they hear it.

1070
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:23,480
Who was the who?

1071
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:26,920
I mean, is botho who was the star of Empty Nest Mulligan?

1072
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:28,560
Yes. Tom. What's his friends?

1073
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:32,400
Mulligan's news guy is Bob doing botho biz on the mouse.

1074
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:36,640
The house sets Thomas Mulligan to top line.

1075
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:39,840
Their newest skyn on Disney Plus.

1076
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:43,400
That's all. Yeah.

1077
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:45,560
It's all very annoying. Wow. Very, very crazy.

1078
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:47,000
Let's go.

1079
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,720
Oh, I was going to say the other thing that I thought was interesting

1080
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:54,280
I came across in that Ferge article was that a lot of the the thinking

1081
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:59,760
kind of changed within the company, kind of Iger seeming to drive this of like,

1082
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:03,160
look, you all we all work for the company.

1083
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:05,160
Everyone's a company man.

1084
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:08,680
If something has to happen

1085
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:11,920
where like consumer products takes a hit,

1086
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:17,840
but then the movies do well, take the hit.

1087
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:19,880
OK, because the company is still winning.

1088
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:24,040
Like, you know, if rising rising tide lifts all ships.

1089
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:28,600
So even if something like is negative for like home entertainment,

1090
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:32,720
but it like a move they have to make

1091
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:35,960
to make the like streaming stuff do really well.

1092
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:39,840
The company is still winning because it's doing really well.

1093
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:41,480
Does that make sense?

1094
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:46,720
But well, now I'm distracted by the metaphor, though, because of course, a sink

1095
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:52,720
I say a ship has sunk this week as soon as the man.

1096
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:56,040
Well, great. As soon as the news was announced,

1097
00:56:56,360 --> 00:57:00,640
I'm a sign the opposite of a rising tide.

1098
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:02,480
Yes, a sinking ship.

1099
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:07,360
I yeah, in a in a bizarre like, you know, like,

1100
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:13,840
you know, like a bird falling to his death upon a piece of news being released,

1101
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:16,240
like frogs falling from the sky.

1102
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:21,400
A jungle cruise boat sank immediately after JPEG was announced.

1103
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:24,760
It is just a strange, obviously unrelated,

1104
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:29,120
but but pretty funny that like this this really strange day

1105
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:31,840
where not just that, but then a SWAT team showed up.

1106
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:34,960
Yes. At the yacht and beach club, which seemed like that was fine.

1107
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:37,760
That was not didn't end up being a bigger situation.

1108
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:39,640
It was a misjudged situation.

1109
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:42,280
Yeah. Someone thought they saw someone with a gun under a coat.

1110
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:47,440
And so police cars and SWAT and helicopters arrived.

1111
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:53,440
So, yes, this is the the literal environment that JPEG is in here.

1112
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:56,960
I mean, he's already ahead of parks, but like and here's the guy. Great.

1113
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:58,440
And how are parks doing?

1114
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:02,960
Well, lots of them are closed for two months because of coronavirus.

1115
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:07,600
The SWAT team is at the yacht and beach club and a jungle cruise boat sink.

1116
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:12,040
Yeah, I mean, I look now I'm just spinning my own rumors.

1117
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:16,480
This is all orchestrated by Eiger to get rid of yet another person

1118
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:18,680
that is in line for the throne.

1119
00:58:18,680 --> 00:58:22,800
He just like Eiger with some bills to know Eiger was with a scuba mask

1120
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:27,160
in the Magic Kingdom under the boat, like just drilling,

1121
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:29,600
like with one of those like old timey.

1122
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:30,640
What do you call those drills?

1123
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:32,600
You know, I know what you're talking about.

1124
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:34,000
Yeah, like Wile E.

1125
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,240
Coyote or something.

1126
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:37,920
Looney Tunes character has and he drilled a hole in the bottom of the boat.

1127
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:41,760
He snuck in in one of those like camouflage suits. Yes.

1128
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:44,160
To look like a jungle cruise plant

1129
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:47,600
and then stripped it off, had scuba gear underneath, jumped into the water,

1130
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:51,200
made a boat sink and by making a boat sink,

1131
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:54,960
he reminded everybody of Titanic.

1132
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:58,720
Now everybody's tweeting about comparing this to Titanic, thus

1133
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:01,360
reminding everyone of the prowess of James Cameron.

1134
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:02,120
Oh, yeah.

1135
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:04,760
He should just be given all of the money in the world.

1136
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:06,640
He'll finish his films. Wow.

1137
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:08,120
Yeah, that it makes too much sense.

1138
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:10,720
Clear. Eiger's Eiger's

1139
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:14,160
he's Mission Impossible pulling this.

1140
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:16,120
Wow. He's Ethan hunting it.

1141
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:19,040
He maybe maybe, you know, even he got he got a loan

1142
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:22,440
of the the Cameron submarine too.

1143
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,400
Oh, probably.

1144
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:26,040
Yeah, I think it's deep that deep on.

1145
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:28,400
But maybe there's a skinnier, shorter submarine

1146
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:30,520
that could go under the water of the jungle cruise.

1147
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:32,680
Mm hmm. Mm hmm. I buy it.

1148
00:59:32,680 --> 00:59:34,320
Well, now we know. All right.

1149
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:36,600
Now we know. Let's solve that.

1150
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:39,600
Very crafty. Some people mover cars collided.

1151
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:43,880
Oh, that is not the first time I've heard of that happening recently,

1152
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:46,920
like a listener that happened to a couple of months ago.

1153
00:59:48,120 --> 00:59:49,480
Again, everyone fine.

1154
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:51,480
I think they just bumped,

1155
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:55,360
but not actively not supposed to function that way. No.

1156
00:59:56,360 --> 00:59:57,960
Yeah. Huh.

1157
00:59:58,280 --> 01:00:01,600
Very strange. I the

1158
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:06,560
I was trying to find other info about this sinking scenario.

1159
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:09,280
The boat was the Boma Kandi Bertha.

1160
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:14,480
It is one of the two wheelchair equipped boats.

1161
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:17,280
So if this doesn't come back, they're going to need a new

1162
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:18,920
handicap boat.

1163
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:24,800
But there is this happened before in 2004, a boat sank

1164
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:28,040
and it is back in operation and has been ever since.

1165
01:00:28,440 --> 01:00:31,040
I forget if it was with guests on board,

1166
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:33,520
but that was called the Sankuru Sadie.

1167
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:37,360
So if you get on the Sankuru Sadie at Disney World,

1168
01:00:37,360 --> 01:00:39,360
know that that's one of the ones that sank.

1169
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:42,160
And so there is hope for the OK.

1170
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:44,720
So this is a this is not without precedent.

1171
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:47,920
Is 2004 the press or era?

1172
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:49,120
I think he was done by then.

1173
01:00:49,120 --> 01:00:51,840
OK, I forget when he left with Eiger up and running.

1174
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:56,680
Yeah, I believe took over in 2005 in transition.

1175
01:00:56,840 --> 01:00:59,120
2005, huh?

1176
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:01,880
Did Eiger drill a hole in the boat in the bottom of that boat, too?

1177
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:04,040
Was or was that before?

1178
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:07,400
And that like created the need like, well, we got to do something.

1179
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:08,560
We got to get Eisner out of here.

1180
01:01:08,560 --> 01:01:10,000
We got boats sinking.

1181
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,560
Yeah, let me see here.

1182
01:01:11,560 --> 01:01:16,400
Oh, October 2005 was when Eiger assumed the role of CEO.

1183
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:18,440
This is his little cat burglar.

1184
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:21,920
That's right. Like iconic move, his little calling card.

1185
01:01:22,040 --> 01:01:24,840
Wow. Well, stop sinking boats.

1186
01:01:24,840 --> 01:01:26,520
It's also clear. We're on to you.

1187
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:27,720
Yep, we know.

1188
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:33,480
Disney announces they're bringing Impossible Burgers to the park.

1189
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:35,520
I miss that happened this week.

1190
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:41,200
It was already at the the festival that just wrapped up in Epcot.

1191
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:44,080
And there's Impossible Foods.

1192
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:48,600
I think that they were at the one we were at, too.

1193
01:01:48,920 --> 01:01:50,120
We were at Food and Wine.

1194
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:53,040
I think the arts one it was at.

1195
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:56,200
It's at the California Adventure of Food and Wine that just started

1196
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:57,880
this past week. They're permanently in.

1197
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:00,560
But they're going to start adding it to like taste pilot script,

1198
01:02:00,560 --> 01:02:02,760
like places where you can get a burger.

1199
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:08,560
You know, I went this week to the mall that had not the Schomburg Mall,

1200
01:02:08,560 --> 01:02:11,960
but the other mall that had Mickey's Kitchen,

1201
01:02:13,240 --> 01:02:14,520
which is in Montclair.

1202
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:18,840
I was at the shops at Montclair and thinking about how, wow,

1203
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:23,720
in this space is where Mickey was selling veggie burgers and how disgusting

1204
01:02:23,720 --> 01:02:25,640
that sounded to me when I was a kid.

1205
01:02:25,640 --> 01:02:30,360
And now look, a permanent collaboration between Disney and Impossible.

1206
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:32,920
It sounds great. Sounds delicious.

1207
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:35,360
Yeah. As long as you're not ruining those things with hunts.

1208
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:38,120
Disgusting. Garbage hunts.

1209
01:02:38,120 --> 01:02:42,000
Awful. Or like slightly mass produced ketchups.

1210
01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:44,720
Unless you got your hands in that ketchup.

1211
01:02:45,160 --> 01:02:49,240
It's either all the way mass produced or it's artisan.

1212
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:53,040
OK, look, it's either Heinz where you suffer through hunts.

1213
01:02:53,880 --> 01:02:58,920
So if if if it's like our homemade house ketchup, it's like, all right,

1214
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:00,800
let's see what you got.

1215
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:02,200
It's a little judgy.

1216
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:04,200
You're judging of another level.

1217
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:08,120
But if it's how is it homemade other homemade flavor ketchup,

1218
01:03:08,120 --> 01:03:10,400
you're like, huh, all ears.

1219
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:12,640
I let's see again.

1220
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:13,720
Let's see what this is.

1221
01:03:13,720 --> 01:03:16,520
I had one in Vegas where I was like, oh, this doesn't taste good.

1222
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:19,080
OK. What was it regular?

1223
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:21,160
No, it was like a Chipotle ketchup.

1224
01:03:21,160 --> 01:03:22,800
Hmm. You're just not into Chipotle.

1225
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:25,560
I think you're a traditionalist when it comes to ketchup.

1226
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:28,840
But again, as a member of the hashtag sauce squad,

1227
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:31,560
but there's not a lot of ketchup on that.

1228
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:34,360
No, I know. But I'm saying there's a variety of sauces, so it's surprising.

1229
01:03:34,360 --> 01:03:36,520
Right. That's all I'm saying.

1230
01:03:36,520 --> 01:03:40,000
Huh. I'm going to test this out when we're out in the wild. OK.

1231
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:42,200
We're going to have different.

1232
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:44,720
I'm going to find a place that has the most different kind of ketchup.

1233
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:46,800
So we'll go. OK. A blind taste test.

1234
01:03:47,080 --> 01:03:49,440
Oh, maybe that's a good idea. Oh, sure.

1235
01:03:50,320 --> 01:03:53,120
Did you like remember when umami burger used to be good?

1236
01:03:53,640 --> 01:03:56,200
They would have like they're kind of like very tomato ketchup.

1237
01:03:56,360 --> 01:03:57,200
Do you remember that?

1238
01:03:57,240 --> 01:03:58,480
Yeah, I like that one.

1239
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:01,640
OK, was was a lot of umami.

1240
01:04:01,640 --> 01:04:04,160
It was salty or whatever they put in there.

1241
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:06,120
I don't know. It was good, though. It was pretty good. Yeah.

1242
01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:08,480
Maybe it's still good. I don't know.

1243
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:09,800
Have you seen this other new food?

1244
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:12,360
I was looking up different this big news.

1245
01:04:12,360 --> 01:04:13,880
They have a new cocoa.

1246
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:17,680
Remember me guava hand pie at the Jolly Holiday Bakery.

1247
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:19,840
Confusing phrase. Yeah.

1248
01:04:19,840 --> 01:04:23,880
Remember me guava hand pie. Hand pie. Yeah.

1249
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,080
They really going all in on hand pies.

1250
01:04:26,080 --> 01:04:26,920
What's a hand pie?

1251
01:04:26,920 --> 01:04:29,120
Well, like we imagine like a hostess fruit pie.

1252
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:31,560
Oh, like some McDonald's would be a hand.

1253
01:04:31,560 --> 01:04:33,120
Yeah, like McDonald's. Yeah.

1254
01:04:33,120 --> 01:04:35,160
But why didn't they didn't call those hand pies?

1255
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:36,640
Where's this phrase from? I don't know.

1256
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:37,840
I think it was invented.

1257
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:40,720
I think I think it's like their marketing thing.

1258
01:04:41,040 --> 01:04:42,840
No, the walking taco.

1259
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:44,800
That's a thing that a lot of places been doing now.

1260
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:46,280
What? I don't know that one either.

1261
01:04:46,280 --> 01:04:47,320
They're all kind of walking.

1262
01:04:47,320 --> 01:04:48,960
It's like a Frito pie.

1263
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:50,440
OK, essentially Frito pie.

1264
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:53,120
Are you are you a hand pie? Are you pro hand pie?

1265
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:56,560
I think it had to be case by case.

1266
01:04:56,560 --> 01:04:59,040
I'd probably try it. OK.

1267
01:04:59,040 --> 01:05:00,680
But not a not a you don't have like

1268
01:05:00,680 --> 01:05:02,880
did you have fruit pies as a child? Oh, yeah.

1269
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:04,960
OK, I didn't I was not a fruit pie kid.

1270
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:08,160
Even then, I knew like these are bad for me.

1271
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:11,160
Like you you would read the calories and the fat content.

1272
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:12,720
Sure. Oh, this is very bad.

1273
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:14,920
I'm back around the Ghostbusters snacks.

1274
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:18,360
Do you guys recall a Ghostbusters pie?

1275
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:20,960
There was like green ooze inside. Yes. Yes.

1276
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:23,000
It was like kind of horrible.

1277
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,600
Yeah, I liked the idea of it so much

1278
01:05:26,360 --> 01:05:30,160
I may have even asked my mom to get it again just due to the concept.

1279
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:34,840
But I specifically remember opening that up in a lunchbox and going like, Jesus,

1280
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:36,480
like even present created. Yeah.

1281
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:37,360
Too fakie to me.

1282
01:05:37,360 --> 01:05:40,240
I do think I had it once and I think it grossed me out.

1283
01:05:40,680 --> 01:05:43,840
It was too. It looked like like Nickelodeon slime.

1284
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:46,720
Yes. Which is like was not appetizing to eat.

1285
01:05:47,040 --> 01:05:49,160
I liked slime fine, but I always like was kind of

1286
01:05:49,640 --> 01:05:52,080
grossed out by the idea of slime even getting on me.

1287
01:05:52,080 --> 01:05:54,680
Was it not Ghostbusters?

1288
01:05:54,680 --> 01:05:56,880
Was it a Ninja Turtles?

1289
01:05:57,480 --> 01:05:58,640
A ooze pie?

1290
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:01,040
If you had said there were both of them, I would say yes.

1291
01:06:01,120 --> 01:06:03,280
But I do remember the turtles, too.

1292
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:06,800
So perhaps it is just a real war for the lunchboxes.

1293
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:09,800
I'm looking at Hostess Turtles pies.

1294
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:13,120
I'm looking at one that is filled with vanilla pudding power.

1295
01:06:13,640 --> 01:06:14,960
Pudding with an apostrophe.

1296
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:17,440
I would assume it's just vanilla pudding dyed green.

1297
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:20,840
Yeah, I just remember biting into something and a bunch of green

1298
01:06:20,840 --> 01:06:23,880
pouring out and not being super psyched.

1299
01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:26,360
I am sure. Oh, yeah. OK, I see this.

1300
01:06:26,360 --> 01:06:28,000
Oh, that doesn't look I don't know.

1301
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:31,200
I had some version of this that I remember being gross.

1302
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,280
Also looking at an ad where

1303
01:06:34,920 --> 01:06:39,560
Raphael has a quote bubble, hey, free pie dudes.

1304
01:06:41,640 --> 01:06:43,960
What a dream if he walked into this room, right?

1305
01:06:43,960 --> 01:06:46,800
And if he walked up to your screen door. Oh, my gosh.

1306
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:50,120
It's a full Raphael who says, hey, free pie dudes.

1307
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:52,720
Oh, man. That is my dream.

1308
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:55,560
I guess it's my dream and Jason's dream combined. Yeah, sure.

1309
01:06:55,800 --> 01:06:58,360
It's both vanilla pudding power anyway.

1310
01:06:59,160 --> 01:07:02,160
So talking about I mean, we've mentioned it a little, but, you know,

1311
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:07,240
talking about what affects one area of the company affects all the company.

1312
01:07:08,520 --> 01:07:11,040
Yeah, the coronavirus.

1313
01:07:11,040 --> 01:07:13,160
Yes, really going to affect Disney.

1314
01:07:13,160 --> 01:07:16,680
So Shanghai and Hong Kong Disney have been closed since late January.

1315
01:07:16,680 --> 01:07:19,280
They will probably end up closed for a full two months, at least.

1316
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:23,040
Yeah. Tokyo is closing until mid-March.

1317
01:07:23,160 --> 01:07:24,760
As of weeks right now.

1318
01:07:24,760 --> 01:07:28,440
Yeah, for a couple weeks. Universal Japan also closing.

1319
01:07:28,440 --> 01:07:30,520
Legoland Japan is closing. Yeah.

1320
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:37,280
And now comes the laugh riot about this news.

1321
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:41,440
It is it's it's really it's I mean, like I was trying to recall,

1322
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:43,720
like, are there other long term closures apart?

1323
01:07:43,720 --> 01:07:48,160
And I guess Tokyo must have been closed for a long time post earthquake.

1324
01:07:48,520 --> 01:07:51,720
But I don't think this is totally unprecedented

1325
01:07:51,720 --> 01:07:54,680
that multiple parks are closed for a long stretch of time.

1326
01:07:54,680 --> 01:07:59,240
Well, and other attract the loop I read this morning is closed. Oh, yeah.

1327
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:01,320
So people just taking precautions.

1328
01:08:01,320 --> 01:08:04,600
Disneyland Paris is like waiting and seeing like they're staying open for now.

1329
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:05,680
But they might.

1330
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:10,440
I was in I was in line at Big Thunder Mountain Railroad Wednesday.

1331
01:08:10,440 --> 01:08:13,640
And I saw I looked at my phone and it said Orange County declares

1332
01:08:13,640 --> 01:08:18,960
emergency and some places that tweeted that, at least on theme park Twitter,

1333
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:22,840
that was often tweeted with like a picture of the Main Street station

1334
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:26,640
as if to say Disneyland is infected. Get out now.

1335
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:29,800
Yes. Well, I know proof of this. This has not happened. Right.

1336
01:08:29,800 --> 01:08:34,400
I will say I'm already very sensitive to like if someone coughs around me, I go,

1337
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:36,600
oh, come on, don't get me sick, please.

1338
01:08:37,360 --> 01:08:42,040
And it felt like one out of every two people was coughing just crazy.

1339
01:08:42,040 --> 01:08:45,560
I mean, the person in front of me in line when I saw it was coughing like crazy.

1340
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:48,120
I was like, oh, my God, I have it.

1341
01:08:48,120 --> 01:08:50,120
I have it for sure.

1342
01:08:50,120 --> 01:08:51,680
The news story gave it to you.

1343
01:08:51,680 --> 01:08:53,680
The news story gave you ready. Yeah.

1344
01:08:54,920 --> 01:08:56,120
Yeah, it's crazy.

1345
01:08:56,120 --> 01:08:57,040
I don't know what they're going to do.

1346
01:08:57,040 --> 01:08:58,320
A lot of money is going to be lost.

1347
01:08:58,320 --> 01:09:01,760
And yeah, I mean, when places now if you are going to Disneyland,

1348
01:09:01,760 --> 01:09:04,040
just know that when places declare states emergency,

1349
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:08,440
one of the reasons is to open up access to funds just in case.

1350
01:09:08,440 --> 01:09:10,920
So that may be a preventative measure.

1351
01:09:11,080 --> 01:09:14,960
But yes, there are scientists saying wash your hands a lot.

1352
01:09:15,360 --> 01:09:19,880
Use hand sanitizer, carry hands like pocket hand sanitizer if you can.

1353
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:25,440
And even if you are like, you know, healthy, because like people get this.

1354
01:09:25,440 --> 01:09:27,920
If they're very healthy, average adults,

1355
01:09:30,520 --> 01:09:33,680
probably it's more like a bad cold or a flu to them.

1356
01:09:33,680 --> 01:09:37,080
But if people have health conditions already, they're higher at risk.

1357
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:39,040
People don't like.

1358
01:09:39,080 --> 01:09:41,680
Yeah, I think because it was like 80 percent of people who have it

1359
01:09:41,800 --> 01:09:45,440
will just like think they have like a cold or something like you won't know it

1360
01:09:45,440 --> 01:09:50,640
necessarily. But do be cognizant for immunocompromised people in the world.

1361
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:53,240
Be healthy. Don't cough on people.

1362
01:09:53,240 --> 01:09:54,520
Wash your hands a lot.

1363
01:09:54,520 --> 01:09:57,600
I think if you have an old hostess, Ninja Turtles pie,

1364
01:09:58,080 --> 01:10:01,840
the chemicals in that are probably such that they would sanitize your hands.

1365
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:03,240
So chop open a pie.

1366
01:10:03,240 --> 01:10:05,680
You're saying maybe get that ooze on you.

1367
01:10:06,040 --> 01:10:09,400
Might be more sanitizing than what they call hand sanitizer.

1368
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:12,520
Yeah, at this point, if it's been aged 25 years.

1369
01:10:12,520 --> 01:10:15,440
Yes. Past a point, it became so toxic.

1370
01:10:16,120 --> 01:10:20,360
It might also now also if you opened it around a turtle.

1371
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:22,640
Turtles might grow into a living turtle.

1372
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:24,760
It's going to turn you into something, too.

1373
01:10:24,760 --> 01:10:27,080
Yeah, you know, bebop or rocksteady.

1374
01:10:27,080 --> 01:10:28,640
Cool. Which is pretty awesome.

1375
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:32,360
It's going to give me punk qualities that I didn't previously have.

1376
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:35,280
I'm going to grow a mohawk and a nose ring.

1377
01:10:35,720 --> 01:10:38,880
At the very least, you become like Super Shredder, Super Scott.

1378
01:10:39,080 --> 01:10:40,520
Hell, you just be bigger.

1379
01:10:40,520 --> 01:10:41,760
Oh, yeah, that's good.

1380
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:43,200
Super Scott. Yeah.

1381
01:10:43,200 --> 01:10:44,680
Oh, man.

1382
01:10:44,680 --> 01:10:46,440
I got to get my hands on some of these pies.

1383
01:10:46,440 --> 01:10:49,360
He loves the Beach Boys twice as much.

1384
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:51,720
Wow. Is it even possible?

1385
01:10:51,720 --> 01:10:55,880
Super Jay, he done Super Jason, of course, naps for longer in Vegas.

1386
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:58,400
Eight hour REM cycle.

1387
01:10:58,760 --> 01:11:01,000
The dream didn't do anything in.

1388
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:03,280
Oh, my God, he's yawning so much.

1389
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:05,160
Super Jason.

1390
01:11:06,680 --> 01:11:12,040
Well, so, yes, there have been cases of coronavirus in Orange County.

1391
01:11:12,040 --> 01:11:13,480
Hopefully that doesn't spread.

1392
01:11:13,480 --> 01:11:17,160
But it's not all bad news in Orange County, California,

1393
01:11:17,160 --> 01:11:22,080
because there was some very good news this week, this weekend.

1394
01:11:22,760 --> 01:11:24,600
An amazing event.

1395
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:27,000
Oh, oh, oh.

1396
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:34,640
OK, so if listeners are not aware of the some of the things

1397
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:37,800
that have transpired on the second gate or on the on the Twitter,

1398
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:40,040
you might be very versed in all of this stuff.

1399
01:11:40,040 --> 01:11:45,120
But you you may not have heard the episode about Fry's Electronics,

1400
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:50,120
the surprisingly well themed electronic store chain,

1401
01:11:51,080 --> 01:11:55,520
and which, you know, I think we've all been fascinated by over the years.

1402
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:57,880
Very good one in Burbank, very good one in Woodland Hills.

1403
01:11:58,160 --> 01:12:01,080
And I discovered one in in Anaheim

1404
01:12:01,680 --> 01:12:03,680
where I went with my wife, Farron,

1405
01:12:03,680 --> 01:12:07,440
and we found this video that played in a space console

1406
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:10,680
and then over many different monitors all over the store,

1407
01:12:10,840 --> 01:12:14,000
where an astronaut tells you to press a red button

1408
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:17,520
that makes a space launch happen on top of the store.

1409
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:20,760
The video cuts to the outside of the Anaheim fries.

1410
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:27,320
A guy says Anaheim fries is go and and you've succeeded in your mission.

1411
01:12:27,720 --> 01:12:29,960
I loved this video very much.

1412
01:12:29,960 --> 01:12:32,240
I told you guys about it. You had not been to the store.

1413
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:38,760
And seeing this seemed like, well, this reminds me so much of Patrick Warburton

1414
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:43,240
and Soren, and this seems like, you know, for this guy who made this

1415
01:12:43,240 --> 01:12:47,400
and who appears in this, you know, this is my dream.

1416
01:12:47,400 --> 01:12:50,720
Being in a video that plays in a loop in a really specific location

1417
01:12:51,240 --> 01:12:52,840
all day, every day.

1418
01:12:52,840 --> 01:12:56,920
Thus, I set about recreating the video.

1419
01:12:56,920 --> 01:13:00,160
I did it exactly with the same framing, the same graphics.

1420
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:02,040
I did all the work for them.

1421
01:13:02,040 --> 01:13:05,280
And then when we put out this episode about a month ago at this point,

1422
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:08,240
I said, you know, maybe this is the start of a little campaign

1423
01:13:08,480 --> 01:13:13,520
to try to get myself to be in that video, in that spot in Fries Electronics.

1424
01:13:15,880 --> 01:13:20,720
It's been a big roller coaster since then, but it's all happened very fast.

1425
01:13:20,720 --> 01:13:22,200
I feel like sometimes it's a blip blip.

1426
01:13:22,200 --> 01:13:25,680
We hatch schemes on the show, a little thing like, you know, we should do.

1427
01:13:25,680 --> 01:13:26,640
We should try to do this.

1428
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:30,560
Right. And this felt like one where it came together shockingly quickly.

1429
01:13:30,600 --> 01:13:32,600
It was a launch. Yeah.

1430
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:34,440
It was not a roller coaster.

1431
01:13:34,440 --> 01:13:35,960
It was, but it was a launch coaster.

1432
01:13:35,960 --> 01:13:37,720
It happened really quick.

1433
01:13:37,720 --> 01:13:43,000
It ramped up from zero to 85 very fast.

1434
01:13:43,160 --> 01:13:45,920
Yes. And as I'm, you know, I'll quote a listener,

1435
01:13:47,200 --> 01:13:51,000
you know, to spoiler, I'll quote a listener who was at the event

1436
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:55,080
that we had in Fries in saying, you know, he said it, not me.

1437
01:13:55,080 --> 01:13:58,520
This guy said, hey, Scott, you now are a launch king.

1438
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:01,040
Wow. Yeah. Yeah.

1439
01:14:01,040 --> 01:14:03,640
It felt really good because here's the the end.

1440
01:14:03,640 --> 01:14:06,280
And listeners very well might know this at this point.

1441
01:14:07,080 --> 01:14:09,720
But all of a sudden it worked out.

1442
01:14:09,960 --> 01:14:13,680
I as we are recording this, I am in the video.

1443
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:15,360
They used my video.

1444
01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:19,680
I am the new astronaut in Fries Electronics Anaheim. Yes.

1445
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:21,720
Playing on multiple screens.

1446
01:14:21,720 --> 01:14:27,280
So many scripts for giant screens, a couple of little ones inside the spaceship.

1447
01:14:28,520 --> 01:14:29,920
This was nuts.

1448
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:32,960
And we had a little event

1449
01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:36,680
to celebrate this, but I guess this is probably the place

1450
01:14:36,680 --> 01:14:39,400
to sort of talk about how it came together

1451
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:43,280
because we posted the video.

1452
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:44,960
Mike, you correct you.

1453
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:48,560
You know, we've been kind of banking episodes in advance for a little bit.

1454
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:51,440
And you were like, maybe we should put this one out soon.

1455
01:14:51,720 --> 01:14:56,280
Because what if given the state of some of the stores in this chain?

1456
01:14:56,680 --> 01:15:00,440
What if there is a problem in the store goes away?

1457
01:15:00,440 --> 01:15:01,480
Right. We had a ticking clock.

1458
01:15:01,480 --> 01:15:04,040
There was a ticking clock in my mind, because if there was something

1459
01:15:04,040 --> 01:15:07,040
and an objective we had to meet of something we wanted done,

1460
01:15:07,640 --> 01:15:10,520
let's just be on the safe side in case.

1461
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:13,720
Who knows fries, whatever something would go away.

1462
01:15:13,720 --> 01:15:15,960
One of the stores would leave, especially obviously the Anaheim.

1463
01:15:15,960 --> 01:15:17,320
There's a few starting to close.

1464
01:15:17,320 --> 01:15:20,640
I think one in NorCal recently closed and we were

1465
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:21,920
we were a little bit worried.

1466
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:24,360
And you I totally agree with you when you said that.

1467
01:15:24,360 --> 01:15:25,600
I'm really glad you said it.

1468
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:28,920
And so that that made it made us think, let's get that episode up quickly.

1469
01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:31,680
We put up the video on Twitter very quickly.

1470
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:35,480
And I didn't want to be the person tweeting it at fries.

1471
01:15:35,480 --> 01:15:37,560
I didn't even add them in the tweet.

1472
01:15:37,560 --> 01:15:39,600
I didn't want to be, you know, bugging these people.

1473
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:42,640
I wanted to approach them with a lot of civility.

1474
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:46,360
I even said in the episode, let's not be mean about this.

1475
01:15:46,360 --> 01:15:49,480
Don't say, get a fucking fries.

1476
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:50,960
Get Gardner in there.

1477
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:52,680
ASAP, we're all towards the store.

1478
01:15:53,120 --> 01:15:55,560
Why? No, they'd only be doing us a favor.

1479
01:15:55,560 --> 01:15:56,600
I wanted it to be very nice.

1480
01:15:56,600 --> 01:15:58,960
And people totally took the message.

1481
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:05,440
Everybody, a lot of the guys doing this was that I did a 4K up res of the of the video.

1482
01:16:05,560 --> 01:16:08,720
And so a lot of people really played the game and commented like,

1483
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:11,280
oh, man, the 4K up res looks amazing.

1484
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:13,560
You have to install this ASAP.

1485
01:16:13,560 --> 01:16:18,440
And the listeners, thank you all so much, by the way, the listeners.

1486
01:16:19,560 --> 01:16:21,440
Tweeted this at fries electronics.

1487
01:16:21,440 --> 01:16:23,680
And it seemed like a lot of people were tweeting at fries electronics.

1488
01:16:23,680 --> 01:16:26,600
And but yet to no avail for several days.

1489
01:16:26,600 --> 01:16:29,640
Right. Until someone, maybe multiple people.

1490
01:16:29,880 --> 01:16:33,400
Forgive me. I don't know who someone tweeted at fries.

1491
01:16:33,400 --> 01:16:34,880
Help. Yes. Yeah.

1492
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:37,240
An alternate account.

1493
01:16:37,240 --> 01:16:42,160
This was very smart because after that account was tweeted at,

1494
01:16:42,160 --> 01:16:47,240
we got a response from a man on the inside, a man named Billy.

1495
01:16:47,640 --> 01:16:51,120
We know his name is Billy because he said the name in the tweet.

1496
01:16:51,120 --> 01:16:52,360
He gave us a specific.

1497
01:16:52,360 --> 01:16:55,160
This was very, very excellent customer service.

1498
01:16:55,320 --> 01:16:59,120
He gave us a name. It is not just, you know, a shadow brand.

1499
01:16:59,120 --> 01:17:01,080
We know who the individual was. Right.

1500
01:17:01,080 --> 01:17:03,200
Now we know who we're aiming at. It is Billy.

1501
01:17:03,400 --> 01:17:09,440
Quickly, we begin DMing in a very surreal move that podcasts.

1502
01:17:09,680 --> 01:17:14,960
I am looking at a Twitter DM exchange between podcast, the ride and official

1503
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,880
fries electronics. This is so delightful.

1504
01:17:18,280 --> 01:17:20,720
Because you feel like you're interacting with Charlie Chip.

1505
01:17:21,320 --> 01:17:26,680
Yes. What I see on the other end is Charlie Chip, who is a big computer chip.

1506
01:17:26,840 --> 01:17:30,200
Right. The mascot in the stores who wears different costumes.

1507
01:17:30,440 --> 01:17:34,680
And he's typing away at a keyboard like what's that old the ending of the TV

1508
01:17:34,680 --> 01:17:37,920
shows where a guy's typing away on the typewriter.

1509
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:42,560
Yes. He like he himself is sending the messages.

1510
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:46,160
So this is this is delightful.

1511
01:17:46,160 --> 01:17:50,200
And I will say, as soon as it turned into DMS, it was always coming from the

1512
01:17:50,200 --> 01:17:52,320
perspective of let's work this out.

1513
01:17:52,320 --> 01:17:54,000
Let's see if we can make this happen.

1514
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,800
It never felt combative.

1515
01:17:56,800 --> 01:17:59,240
It never was like, yeah, we'll see. It never felt humoring.

1516
01:17:59,480 --> 01:18:03,840
I right away from Billy felt like, oh, he likes it.

1517
01:18:04,160 --> 01:18:05,680
This is going to be fun.

1518
01:18:05,680 --> 01:18:07,880
I think this is a real possibility.

1519
01:18:07,880 --> 01:18:09,040
So we're going back and forth.

1520
01:18:09,040 --> 01:18:10,240
But I won't hear for a couple of days.

1521
01:18:10,240 --> 01:18:14,200
And then suddenly he's like, so if we can work this out, would you guys want to

1522
01:18:14,200 --> 01:18:15,640
have like an event in the store?

1523
01:18:16,200 --> 01:18:18,920
Of course we would like to have an event in the store.

1524
01:18:18,920 --> 01:18:20,280
Yeah. Incredible.

1525
01:18:20,280 --> 01:18:21,040
That would be so.

1526
01:18:21,040 --> 01:18:24,280
So now my hopes are climbing sky high.

1527
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:26,320
I I'm so excited.

1528
01:18:26,320 --> 01:18:27,880
I'm dreaming of what that event could be.

1529
01:18:27,880 --> 01:18:29,880
I'm thinking about a speech that I would give.

1530
01:18:30,160 --> 01:18:32,320
I don't like getting ahead of myself.

1531
01:18:32,440 --> 01:18:33,760
Lest dreams be crushed.

1532
01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:37,920
But I certainly was getting ahead of myself and imagining this great day.

1533
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:44,360
Then another tweet in the same week that we hear about shape back and all of this

1534
01:18:44,360 --> 01:18:50,000
nonsense on the day before shape back, I believe this is on a Monday news story.

1535
01:18:50,040 --> 01:18:51,920
Fry's Anaheim is closing.

1536
01:18:52,880 --> 01:18:53,920
My heart sinks.

1537
01:18:54,280 --> 01:18:55,280
This is awful.

1538
01:18:55,480 --> 01:18:57,040
This is the death of the dream.

1539
01:18:57,080 --> 01:18:57,400
Right.

1540
01:18:58,480 --> 01:18:59,880
Mission not accomplished.

1541
01:18:59,880 --> 01:19:01,120
There will be no event.

1542
01:19:01,320 --> 01:19:04,120
And I'm just sad for them because I'm so fond of this store.

1543
01:19:04,120 --> 01:19:07,440
I named it my number one fries, which is saying a lot.

1544
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:09,280
They're all a lot of fun.

1545
01:19:09,280 --> 01:19:11,520
It's like at this point, it's like that late mid scene.

1546
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:13,400
You're like, I dreamed a dream.

1547
01:19:15,680 --> 01:19:16,400
Exactly.

1548
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:17,880
Oh, I feel like I was.

1549
01:19:17,880 --> 01:19:19,760
But the character's name, I can't think of her name.

1550
01:19:20,120 --> 01:19:24,400
Well, like I've been saying, I was wearing a burlap sack.

1551
01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:27,520
I was sad in the cold.

1552
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:31,200
I yes, very tragic for me.

1553
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:33,000
I felt all the way down.

1554
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:33,840
Fontein.

1555
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:35,880
Fun. I felt exactly like Fontein.

1556
01:19:36,200 --> 01:19:39,080
You sing that song and then you die, I believe.

1557
01:19:39,320 --> 01:19:39,520
Yeah.

1558
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:40,400
Memory serves.

1559
01:19:41,400 --> 01:19:43,640
Sing that song and then it falls over.

1560
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:45,880
Oh, I don't think I knew that, actually.

1561
01:19:45,880 --> 01:19:48,840
I believe that's how the timing the show works out.

1562
01:19:49,880 --> 01:19:55,160
I yeah, I thought it'd be a life worth living.

1563
01:19:55,760 --> 01:19:56,680
How does that sound?

1564
01:19:56,680 --> 01:19:57,600
That's a lyric, right?

1565
01:19:57,600 --> 01:19:58,280
Yeah, that's about right.

1566
01:19:59,400 --> 01:20:03,320
So then I I'm like, let me round up the horse.

1567
01:20:03,360 --> 01:20:07,840
I'll, you know, correspond Billy about this and just say, too bad.

1568
01:20:08,120 --> 01:20:10,120
Well, thanks for trying, brother.

1569
01:20:10,120 --> 01:20:11,560
I sent him a message.

1570
01:20:11,560 --> 01:20:12,800
I send my condolences.

1571
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:14,120
I'm not even sure I mentioned the video.

1572
01:20:14,120 --> 01:20:16,520
I'm like, well, or maybe just like I could have been fun.

1573
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,480
And then he writes back and is like, yeah, I know.

1574
01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:20,360
Bad news.

1575
01:20:20,360 --> 01:20:24,640
Well, it just really puts the clock on this thing to get your video in the store.

1576
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:26,680
Billy. Yes.

1577
01:20:26,680 --> 01:20:27,720
Oh, my God.

1578
01:20:27,720 --> 01:20:29,880
He's not giving up with all the things happening.

1579
01:20:29,880 --> 01:20:31,960
The store is going to be closed in six days.

1580
01:20:32,080 --> 01:20:34,360
He is still determined to make this happen.

1581
01:20:36,120 --> 01:20:40,680
All right. So now I'm caught in this week where, oh, my God, is it going to have I

1582
01:20:40,680 --> 01:20:41,960
hung out with my friend, Raja.

1583
01:20:41,960 --> 01:20:42,880
He asked how things are going.

1584
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:46,960
I'm like, it's pretty crazy right now because I am caught in the whirlwind of fries.

1585
01:20:46,960 --> 01:20:49,080
Electronics might use my video or they might not.

1586
01:20:49,080 --> 01:20:51,000
The storm might close. I don't know what is going to happen.

1587
01:20:51,800 --> 01:20:53,280
I felt crazy.

1588
01:20:53,280 --> 01:20:55,640
And but nonetheless, I'm prepping the video.

1589
01:20:55,640 --> 01:21:00,120
I'm doing the parts that I had not completed before, such as that I needed to make my own

1590
01:21:00,280 --> 01:21:05,240
new special effects shot of the rocket taking off from on top of the store.

1591
01:21:05,240 --> 01:21:06,920
I had comping work to do.

1592
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:08,720
How many hours total?

1593
01:21:08,720 --> 01:21:09,640
I should have.

1594
01:21:09,640 --> 01:21:12,440
I mean, what's that?

1595
01:21:12,440 --> 01:21:14,160
20 hours on all of this.

1596
01:21:14,160 --> 01:21:15,040
Yeah, definitely.

1597
01:21:15,040 --> 01:21:15,560
Yeah.

1598
01:21:15,560 --> 01:21:17,080
Oh, to set up the green.

1599
01:21:17,080 --> 01:21:19,080
I assume the costume.

1600
01:21:19,080 --> 01:21:19,600
Right.

1601
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:21,560
And it's all costing me money.

1602
01:21:21,560 --> 01:21:24,120
I had to rent the costume costs money.

1603
01:21:25,120 --> 01:21:27,160
It's money and it's time.

1604
01:21:27,200 --> 01:21:32,080
And not to mention, bizarrely, another ticking clock.

1605
01:21:32,080 --> 01:21:34,080
The store's last day is going to be on Sunday.

1606
01:21:34,080 --> 01:21:38,240
I subscribe to a video stock footage site.

1607
01:21:38,240 --> 01:21:41,640
My yearly subscription is done on Sunday.

1608
01:21:41,640 --> 01:21:42,160
Wow.

1609
01:21:42,160 --> 01:21:42,840
Same day.

1610
01:21:42,840 --> 01:21:45,640
So I've got limited time to get all of my space footage.

1611
01:21:45,640 --> 01:21:47,400
There's so much going on here.

1612
01:21:47,400 --> 01:21:49,320
It's a race to the finish line.

1613
01:21:49,320 --> 01:21:52,720
But we start going back and forth.

1614
01:21:52,760 --> 01:22:08,080
And then all of a sudden, on a Friday afternoon, I get a photo from Billy of my video, a frame from my video in the exact same screen where I saw it a year ago.

1615
01:22:08,080 --> 01:22:09,080
Did you guys realize?

1616
01:22:09,080 --> 01:22:09,880
Did I tell you this?

1617
01:22:09,880 --> 01:22:10,600
To the day?

1618
01:22:10,600 --> 01:22:12,440
Not to the day, to the week.

1619
01:22:12,440 --> 01:22:13,000
Wow.

1620
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:20,200
I tell you, it was exactly if not for the leap year to hit up being on a leap year day.

1621
01:22:20,360 --> 01:22:23,600
No, almost exactly the same from when we saw it for the first time.

1622
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:26,600
I've never been so nervous sending a tweet.

1623
01:22:26,600 --> 01:22:29,160
We all agreed, OK, so some kind of event.

1624
01:22:29,160 --> 01:22:32,480
And also, Jason, as you said, you're in Vegas this entire time.

1625
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:33,880
You're like, what's going on now?

1626
01:22:33,880 --> 01:22:38,120
Every now and then I look at my phone and I'm just like, what is happening back in the city?

1627
01:22:38,120 --> 01:22:41,560
I was thinking, oh, this happens really fast.

1628
01:22:41,560 --> 01:22:42,840
I might miss this.

1629
01:22:42,840 --> 01:22:43,640
That's just fine.

1630
01:22:43,640 --> 01:22:44,160
That too.

1631
01:22:44,160 --> 01:22:45,160
That's another ticking clock.

1632
01:22:45,160 --> 01:22:46,000
I want this to just happen.

1633
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:47,480
Jason might not be there.

1634
01:22:47,480 --> 01:22:49,360
I won't have my full crew with me.

1635
01:22:49,360 --> 01:22:50,360
And what would it mean?

1636
01:22:50,360 --> 01:22:55,480
But it worked out like a precise rocket launch.

1637
01:22:55,480 --> 01:22:57,680
Everything came into place.

1638
01:22:57,680 --> 01:22:58,160
Yeah.

1639
01:22:58,160 --> 01:23:03,280
Except something was on fire when I was by Griffith Park when I was driving down.

1640
01:23:03,280 --> 01:23:04,760
So I had very bad traffic.

1641
01:23:04,760 --> 01:23:10,720
So I showed up about 10 minutes after I walked in, everyone facing a different direction.

1642
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:11,760
Cheers.

1643
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:13,360
And I'm like, what is happening?

1644
01:23:13,360 --> 01:23:14,120
Oh, well, wait, wait, wait.

1645
01:23:14,120 --> 01:23:14,960
Don't skip ahead.

1646
01:23:14,960 --> 01:23:15,280
Hang on.

1647
01:23:15,280 --> 01:23:16,320
That's just a tease.

1648
01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:17,480
That's just a tease.

1649
01:23:18,440 --> 01:23:22,080
Because that is just suddenly not just a cherry on top.

1650
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:27,600
That is a gigantic mound of whipped cream and an avalanche of cherries on top.

1651
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:30,200
So Friday afternoon, oh my god, I think it's happening.

1652
01:23:30,200 --> 01:23:30,960
We all agreed.

1653
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:31,960
OK, let's try to do something.

1654
01:23:31,960 --> 01:23:32,840
It can't be too official.

1655
01:23:32,840 --> 01:23:35,160
But let's just tweet out, hey, we're going to be there.

1656
01:23:35,160 --> 01:23:37,200
We're going to go check it out.

1657
01:23:37,200 --> 01:23:38,360
Come down if you can.

1658
01:23:38,360 --> 01:23:40,720
So I rent the astronaut costume again.

1659
01:23:40,720 --> 01:23:42,680
I'm again in the tank for more money.

1660
01:23:42,680 --> 01:23:45,720
This keeps being at a financial disadvantage to me.

1661
01:23:45,720 --> 01:23:48,160
Would it have been better just to buy in hindsight?

1662
01:23:48,160 --> 01:23:50,680
Yeah, I guess looking back, yeah.

1663
01:23:50,680 --> 01:23:52,960
And look, I'm going to use that for something else.

1664
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:57,800
I mean, to have an astronaut costume on hand, that's going to pay itself off.

1665
01:23:57,800 --> 01:24:02,960
So again, this timeline, we announced the store is closing forever.

1666
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:03,760
That's on a Monday.

1667
01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:05,240
We'll be closed on Sunday.

1668
01:24:05,240 --> 01:24:08,440
We discovered that for the last weekend that the store is ever open,

1669
01:24:08,440 --> 01:24:10,160
they will be playing my video in a loop.

1670
01:24:10,160 --> 01:24:12,760
So we're going to be there Saturday at 1.

1671
01:24:12,760 --> 01:24:13,800
We get there right inside.

1672
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:16,200
I caught you in the parking lot, Mike.

1673
01:24:16,200 --> 01:24:16,840
We walk in.

1674
01:24:16,840 --> 01:24:19,040
We didn't know what we were going to be walking into.

1675
01:24:19,040 --> 01:24:20,400
In fact, then we walked in.

1676
01:24:20,400 --> 01:24:21,680
There's nothing on the screen.

1677
01:24:21,680 --> 01:24:23,040
And I'm like, did something happen?

1678
01:24:23,040 --> 01:24:24,600
Is it not showing?

1679
01:24:24,600 --> 01:24:28,040
But then I hear a clap and then another clap.

1680
01:24:28,040 --> 01:24:32,000
And I walk up and in front of that space console,

1681
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:37,040
an audience of dozens of our listeners who have all gathered

1682
01:24:37,040 --> 01:24:40,480
to watch this historic launch.

1683
01:24:40,520 --> 01:24:47,120
And yes, as I said, I'm wearing the space suit again.

1684
01:24:47,120 --> 01:24:48,320
Look, it's right stuff.

1685
01:24:48,320 --> 01:24:49,960
It's Apollo 13.

1686
01:24:49,960 --> 01:24:52,360
This is a hero moment for me.

1687
01:24:52,360 --> 01:24:58,040
And then something I could not have anticipated, which is that I go up.

1688
01:24:58,040 --> 01:24:59,960
I get up on the little stage.

1689
01:24:59,960 --> 01:25:05,360
It's kind of a little stage almost on the space console.

1690
01:25:05,360 --> 01:25:12,040
I walk up there and I am joined by a child, an eight-year-old boy

1691
01:25:12,040 --> 01:25:15,720
also wearing an orange space jumpsuit.

1692
01:25:15,720 --> 01:25:19,360
And I'm just, did the store coordinate this?

1693
01:25:19,360 --> 01:25:20,000
What's happening?

1694
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:25,160
Come to realize this is a listener, brought his family from Flagstaff,

1695
01:25:25,160 --> 01:25:31,720
Arizona for this event, drove their son wearing a space suit.

1696
01:25:31,720 --> 01:25:33,280
And he joins me.

1697
01:25:33,320 --> 01:25:38,760
It was like everybody's marching victoriously at the end of Life Aquatic.

1698
01:25:38,760 --> 01:25:40,960
And then a little kid runs up to.

1699
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:43,440
It's like, now there's a kid part of this crew.

1700
01:25:43,440 --> 01:25:44,600
What's going on?

1701
01:25:44,600 --> 01:25:45,960
I ask him his name.

1702
01:25:45,960 --> 01:25:48,520
He says, Soren.

1703
01:25:48,520 --> 01:25:53,240
This whole thing, my goal to be like the Patrick Warburton Soren video.

1704
01:25:53,240 --> 01:25:56,400
And I meet a little child named Soren.

1705
01:25:56,400 --> 01:25:56,920
It's magic.

1706
01:25:56,920 --> 01:25:58,640
The strangest thing.

1707
01:25:58,640 --> 01:26:01,880
I ask if he wants to be a fake astronaut someday too.

1708
01:26:01,920 --> 01:26:03,800
He says, yes.

1709
01:26:03,800 --> 01:26:05,720
So Soren is the next generation.

1710
01:26:05,720 --> 01:26:08,040
If I can do it, he can do it.

1711
01:26:08,040 --> 01:26:09,880
I made a little speech.

1712
01:26:09,880 --> 01:26:11,440
Right after the speech, Jason walks in.

1713
01:26:11,440 --> 01:26:13,480
I love it.

1714
01:26:13,480 --> 01:26:16,160
That's the only timing that didn't work out.

1715
01:26:16,160 --> 01:26:19,120
That's fine.

1716
01:26:19,120 --> 01:26:22,840
We got to applaud for Billy, who I declared.

1717
01:26:22,840 --> 01:26:24,600
This is an audience's suggestion.

1718
01:26:24,600 --> 01:26:27,400
I made Billy an official podcast, The Ride Legend.

1719
01:26:27,400 --> 01:26:30,120
Billy, you were a PTR legend and well deserved.

1720
01:26:30,120 --> 01:26:30,720
Thank you.

1721
01:26:30,720 --> 01:26:35,080
Nobody's helped the show more recently than you, Billy.

1722
01:26:35,080 --> 01:26:38,040
And then Jason, as you say, I love this.

1723
01:26:38,040 --> 01:26:40,240
This was what you saw when you walked in.

1724
01:26:40,240 --> 01:26:42,360
You found not only the audience.

1725
01:26:42,360 --> 01:26:43,760
I'll get into it in Vegas.

1726
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:48,760
But my brain, I feel like it's still, Vegas is overwhelming.

1727
01:26:48,760 --> 01:26:50,840
And you're so nap battle.

1728
01:26:50,840 --> 01:26:52,120
Yeah, I'm still in nap world.

1729
01:26:52,120 --> 01:26:57,360
I walked into a happening, like a pop up flash mob, whatever you want to call it.

1730
01:26:57,360 --> 01:26:58,320
Yeah, yeah.

1731
01:26:58,320 --> 01:27:00,240
Just in progress.

1732
01:27:00,240 --> 01:27:02,760
Scott's happening and it freaks him out, man.

1733
01:27:02,760 --> 01:27:04,680
It freaks me out.

1734
01:27:04,680 --> 01:27:06,000
That's exactly how it felt.

1735
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:07,720
And I was like, it's not going to be a real event.

1736
01:27:07,720 --> 01:27:09,200
And it's not mandated.

1737
01:27:09,200 --> 01:27:11,400
But certainly we're doing it and nobody minds.

1738
01:27:11,400 --> 01:27:18,240
We're just giving a speech in this store while my own voice plays over and over again.

1739
01:27:18,240 --> 01:27:20,960
There was a, so you're giving the speech.

1740
01:27:20,960 --> 01:27:22,440
This is before Jason gets there.

1741
01:27:22,440 --> 01:27:28,200
And there was, because people were gathering that I assume were not our listeners.

1742
01:27:28,200 --> 01:27:29,520
Because there's still shoppers in there.

1743
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:30,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1744
01:27:30,400 --> 01:27:31,720
And the store's about to close.

1745
01:27:31,720 --> 01:27:34,200
People also separately want to say goodbye to the store.

1746
01:27:34,200 --> 01:27:35,440
Yes.

1747
01:27:35,440 --> 01:27:41,800
And an older couple walked over and I was like, there's no way they listened to the show.

1748
01:27:41,800 --> 01:27:47,240
The guy pulls his phone out, starts recording, because I'm Instagram live-ing immediately.

1749
01:27:47,240 --> 01:27:51,440
I was overwhelmed too, because I would come from Disneyland and I was like, wait, what's going on?

1750
01:27:51,440 --> 01:27:52,600
I didn't know what was happening.

1751
01:27:52,600 --> 01:27:55,040
I go, I guess I should just Instagram live this.

1752
01:27:55,040 --> 01:27:56,920
And an old couple came up next to me.

1753
01:27:56,920 --> 01:28:01,400
And I will say, unless they were listeners, I don't think they were.

1754
01:28:01,400 --> 01:28:05,160
They were recording you the whole time and your jokes were killing with the guy.

1755
01:28:05,160 --> 01:28:05,680
Yes.

1756
01:28:05,680 --> 01:28:08,840
He was really liking all the jokes.

1757
01:28:08,840 --> 01:28:10,160
And I was like, oh, that's interesting.

1758
01:28:10,160 --> 01:28:12,880
They thought you were an actual astronaut.

1759
01:28:12,880 --> 01:28:16,560
Yeah, I think maybe they thought it was like a funny sketch that was happening.

1760
01:28:16,560 --> 01:28:19,360
But they were like really, they really enjoyed what was happening.

1761
01:28:19,360 --> 01:28:23,520
There was another confusing thing where I was up there wearing an astronaut jumpsuit.

1762
01:28:23,520 --> 01:28:27,600
And then a couple walks up and they're wanting to take a picture.

1763
01:28:27,600 --> 01:28:29,720
And they asked my wife Erin to take a picture.

1764
01:28:29,720 --> 01:28:32,040
And I was like, oh, hey, all right.

1765
01:28:32,040 --> 01:28:33,120
And I stood next to them.

1766
01:28:33,120 --> 01:28:35,360
And they were like, oh.

1767
01:28:35,360 --> 01:28:39,320
And then they said, all right, now one without the astronaut.

1768
01:28:39,320 --> 01:28:43,680
So they were just there to take a picture of the space console, which I shouldn't think

1769
01:28:43,680 --> 01:28:47,440
is that weird, because that's what I was doing not that long ago.

1770
01:28:47,440 --> 01:28:50,800
I guess people did want to see this thing for the last time.

1771
01:28:50,800 --> 01:28:54,880
And I should say, by the way, I got to talk to this guy Billy a ton.

1772
01:28:54,880 --> 01:28:58,080
Billy was talking about how much people love the store, love the theming, and what it means

1773
01:28:58,080 --> 01:28:59,080
to them.

1774
01:28:59,080 --> 01:29:05,680
He said several Make-A-Wish kids have made their wish to go be in that console.

1775
01:29:05,680 --> 01:29:06,680
Really?

1776
01:29:06,680 --> 01:29:11,000
And there's kind of a gate in there where you can't sit as if you're driving it.

1777
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:16,240
But for kids, they, Make-A-Wish kids, they opened it up so you could sit in the console

1778
01:29:16,240 --> 01:29:18,000
for a while and feel like an astronaut.

1779
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:19,000
Wow, that's crazy.

1780
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:22,320
It is important to people and clearly very important to him.

1781
01:29:22,320 --> 01:29:24,880
He's so fond of the store.

1782
01:29:24,880 --> 01:29:28,320
I felt like the heartfelt nature of this whole thing.

1783
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:35,360
But Jason, anyway, then, so the first thing you see when you walk in.

1784
01:29:35,360 --> 01:29:40,440
So the first thing I see is everyone clapping.

1785
01:29:40,440 --> 01:29:44,500
And I'm like, but they were looking to the side.

1786
01:29:44,500 --> 01:29:46,320
They weren't looking at me.

1787
01:29:46,320 --> 01:29:51,560
So I'm just trying to slip in out of the way because I don't know what they're looking

1788
01:29:51,560 --> 01:29:57,640
at or what they're cheering for because I think there was, you know, there's still shelves

1789
01:29:57,640 --> 01:29:59,100
and stuff everywhere.

1790
01:29:59,100 --> 01:30:00,100
Some people are obscure.

1791
01:30:00,100 --> 01:30:02,300
You were partially obscured by shelving.

1792
01:30:02,300 --> 01:30:07,160
Mike was like, yeah, creeping behind a shelf and Instagram Live.

1793
01:30:07,160 --> 01:30:11,720
Like I came around the thing and Mike's like, you're on Instagram Live right now.

1794
01:30:11,720 --> 01:30:12,720
Right.

1795
01:30:12,720 --> 01:30:14,360
I walked right into it.

1796
01:30:14,360 --> 01:30:19,640
And then I see in the distance what everyone else has already seen and is cheering for.

1797
01:30:19,640 --> 01:30:20,640
And a pure surprise.

1798
01:30:20,640 --> 01:30:22,320
A surprise for me.

1799
01:30:22,320 --> 01:30:23,320
Surprise for everyone.

1800
01:30:23,320 --> 01:30:30,760
Walking so dramatically, way in the distance, a gasp from the crowd as they see Charlie

1801
01:30:30,760 --> 01:30:38,600
Chip, our friend, the mascot of Fries, Charlie Chip, wearing an astronaut costume, a big

1802
01:30:38,600 --> 01:30:43,120
cloth, helmet and jet pack, essentially.

1803
01:30:43,120 --> 01:30:48,360
An anthropomorphic computer chip wearing a space suit.

1804
01:30:48,360 --> 01:30:50,960
Obviously already one of our top characters in fiction.

1805
01:30:50,960 --> 01:30:51,960
Yes.

1806
01:30:51,960 --> 01:30:54,400
Oh, now rising the ranks at this point.

1807
01:30:54,400 --> 01:30:57,820
I didn't even know his name exactly until we did the episode.

1808
01:30:57,820 --> 01:31:01,460
But now after that, and I think one of the most successful elements that we found of

1809
01:31:01,460 --> 01:31:05,440
Fries was him in all of those costumes and different guises.

1810
01:31:05,440 --> 01:31:06,580
Charlie looks great.

1811
01:31:06,580 --> 01:31:08,940
The place that made the suit, it's great.

1812
01:31:08,940 --> 01:31:13,540
So to see him in person and knowing that they arranged this for him, even though this was

1813
01:31:13,540 --> 01:31:18,820
never like a really official event, that I was like having a child's birthday party.

1814
01:31:18,820 --> 01:31:22,180
It was like they went in the back and got the Chucky costume.

1815
01:31:22,180 --> 01:31:24,760
They got Charlie Chip to come out for me.

1816
01:31:24,760 --> 01:31:26,740
And then we just had a photo.

1817
01:31:26,740 --> 01:31:30,140
Like, okay, do you want a picture with us and Charlie?

1818
01:31:30,140 --> 01:31:31,140
As if it was.

1819
01:31:31,140 --> 01:31:32,140
Do you want a picture with just Charlie?

1820
01:31:32,140 --> 01:31:34,820
Critter country, as Scott said, like the Pooh Bear.

1821
01:31:34,820 --> 01:31:38,500
It's like when you know this tigger here, there's poo, there's rabbit or something.

1822
01:31:38,660 --> 01:31:44,740
We felt like we had to do an impromptu, like a suited character receiving line.

1823
01:31:44,740 --> 01:31:48,140
So yeah, you got a picture with Charlie and the three of us.

1824
01:31:48,140 --> 01:31:49,980
Or if you just wanted Charlie, we were happy.

1825
01:31:49,980 --> 01:31:50,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1826
01:31:50,980 --> 01:31:54,060
Hey, look, you know, there's other opportunities to meet us.

1827
01:31:54,060 --> 01:31:57,420
Charlie, an astronaut Charlie, who knows when we'll see him again?

1828
01:31:57,420 --> 01:32:02,300
When he, I watched the video back when I'm like, I'm not sure whether to go to him because

1829
01:32:02,300 --> 01:32:04,060
the audience is so far away.

1830
01:32:04,060 --> 01:32:09,700
And then he gives me a little like arms for like a little come hither, essentially like,

1831
01:32:09,700 --> 01:32:10,700
hey, I'm all in.

1832
01:32:10,700 --> 01:32:13,260
And I ran up and gave him a big hug.

1833
01:32:13,260 --> 01:32:15,020
I can't stop watching this footage.

1834
01:32:15,020 --> 01:32:16,140
This delights me so much.

1835
01:32:16,140 --> 01:32:19,860
And then I said, here, come meet my friends.

1836
01:32:19,860 --> 01:32:24,340
The child, Soren, who was there, pointed out that one of his cords was loose.

1837
01:32:24,340 --> 01:32:25,340
Yes.

1838
01:32:25,340 --> 01:32:29,340
So he was like, worried, like, like Charlie can't breathe.

1839
01:32:29,340 --> 01:32:32,300
He was losing oxygen.

1840
01:32:32,300 --> 01:32:33,620
So then we're hanging out with Charlie.

1841
01:32:33,660 --> 01:32:36,580
I stopped knowing what the hell to do with Charlie after a point.

1842
01:32:36,580 --> 01:32:38,820
You were trying. What was really funny is to be polite.

1843
01:32:38,820 --> 01:32:41,180
You were trying to like, excuse Charlie.

1844
01:32:41,260 --> 01:32:44,820
Yes. So like, in case you need a break or something, it's a giant costume.

1845
01:32:44,820 --> 01:32:46,380
Yeah, it's probably pretty insane.

1846
01:32:46,660 --> 01:32:49,940
So I think like, you know, people came up and took photos and then we were like, all right,

1847
01:32:49,940 --> 01:32:51,300
well, thanks, Charlie.

1848
01:32:51,380 --> 01:32:54,460
And then Charlie was like, like, give the thumbs up, but then stayed put.

1849
01:32:57,140 --> 01:33:01,260
If you're told you're on duty for a little while, but it was definitely like, oh, yeah,

1850
01:33:01,300 --> 01:33:04,940
we got it. If you want to go get this off, please.

1851
01:33:04,980 --> 01:33:07,500
And Charlie would just be like, thumbs up and stay.

1852
01:33:08,380 --> 01:33:12,300
It's like if you met, if you, if you like, met a musician or a movie star, it means

1853
01:33:12,300 --> 01:33:16,140
a lot to you. And then you say, like, you know, just, I just think you're the greatest

1854
01:33:16,140 --> 01:33:17,860
and you inspire me to do what I do.

1855
01:33:17,860 --> 01:33:19,540
And just thanks, man. Cool.

1856
01:33:20,540 --> 01:33:22,060
And then that wasn't it.

1857
01:33:22,060 --> 01:33:23,500
And then you didn't know what else to say.

1858
01:33:23,500 --> 01:33:27,260
Like, now it's just, you let them off the hook.

1859
01:33:27,580 --> 01:33:29,180
But they they've stuck around.

1860
01:33:29,180 --> 01:33:31,220
I mean, God bless Charlie for not wanting to leave.

1861
01:33:31,220 --> 01:33:34,580
Yes. But then we got this was a wonderful thing.

1862
01:33:34,700 --> 01:33:39,100
We got to lead everybody over to the presentation room, which is what they call the

1863
01:33:39,100 --> 01:33:40,980
little movie theaters that are in every store.

1864
01:33:41,100 --> 01:33:44,500
This one is inside a giant spaceship and it's closed down.

1865
01:33:44,620 --> 01:33:46,260
They're closing down big parts of the store.

1866
01:33:46,260 --> 01:33:48,820
This is like, you know, do not pass tape everywhere.

1867
01:33:48,980 --> 01:33:51,820
But they let us specially and opened the door.

1868
01:33:52,020 --> 01:33:56,260
They like unlocked it for us just to go sit in there.

1869
01:33:56,420 --> 01:33:59,540
I always take this picture where it's just me sitting in the theater.

1870
01:33:59,740 --> 01:34:01,980
And now I have it from the same perspective.

1871
01:34:01,980 --> 01:34:06,180
Aaron took it where it was a group full of people in the presentation room.

1872
01:34:06,420 --> 01:34:11,660
And then we did a little like impromptu live interview with Billy, where he told us

1873
01:34:11,660 --> 01:34:13,940
great. He talked about the theming and where it comes from.

1874
01:34:13,940 --> 01:34:16,980
I think they used to build rocket parts in this particular.

1875
01:34:17,900 --> 01:34:19,500
Yeah. At the very least, I believe.

1876
01:34:19,580 --> 01:34:23,420
Yeah. Him having to run this all past one of the fries.

1877
01:34:23,460 --> 01:34:24,660
Right. That's an element of this.

1878
01:34:24,660 --> 01:34:29,020
We haven't said also like the founders of the company had to sign off on this.

1879
01:34:29,020 --> 01:34:34,020
Yes. And the guy who was in the video before who I replaced saw it.

1880
01:34:34,260 --> 01:34:36,700
He's seen it. Who still works in the company.

1881
01:34:36,700 --> 01:34:39,100
Works at the company. His name's Jim.

1882
01:34:39,100 --> 01:34:43,500
He used to make all of the in-house videos like the TV commercials and everything.

1883
01:34:43,660 --> 01:34:46,580
And apparently he didn't want to be the guy originally.

1884
01:34:46,700 --> 01:34:49,540
He did it because nobody else in the office volunteered.

1885
01:34:49,540 --> 01:34:53,260
That's funny. Jim, I finally from his burden.

1886
01:34:53,260 --> 01:34:55,060
He never wanted to be on camera.

1887
01:34:55,060 --> 01:34:56,340
He didn't ask for this.

1888
01:34:56,340 --> 01:34:58,820
No, I really did him a favor.

1889
01:34:59,740 --> 01:35:02,460
But hey, it wasn't just a banner day for you, Scott.

1890
01:35:02,700 --> 01:35:07,900
I mean, Mike got to correctly identify that matchbox when he came on in the store

1891
01:35:08,180 --> 01:35:10,940
and a listener brought us all some tea cakes.

1892
01:35:10,940 --> 01:35:12,780
Yes. Well, that was the Flagstaff.

1893
01:35:12,780 --> 01:35:16,060
Yes. The wonderful people from these delicious tea cakes.

1894
01:35:16,620 --> 01:35:18,700
Absolutely. Yeah, they're wonderful.

1895
01:35:18,700 --> 01:35:21,820
They were given to the he brought a cake for the people in the store.

1896
01:35:21,860 --> 01:35:25,460
Yeah, the cake said, Fries Anaheim, you give us strength.

1897
01:35:26,900 --> 01:35:28,180
There was a sector.

1898
01:35:28,180 --> 01:35:29,020
You missed that part.

1899
01:35:29,020 --> 01:35:30,340
I missed the cake.

1900
01:35:30,340 --> 01:35:34,140
Yes, a sector keeper quote was on a cake for the people

1901
01:35:34,140 --> 01:35:36,740
who have to really have to say goodbye to the store.

1902
01:35:36,740 --> 01:35:38,060
The store is closing.

1903
01:35:38,060 --> 01:35:40,740
This was just all such wonderful, heartfelt stuff.

1904
01:35:41,060 --> 01:35:45,740
And I'll I'll say this that getting to talk to Billy for a while,

1905
01:35:45,900 --> 01:35:49,020
who was a great guy, really lit up when we got that.

1906
01:35:49,060 --> 01:35:51,660
He was excited from second one, as we intuited.

1907
01:35:51,940 --> 01:35:56,380
And he said, as we were leaving, this could have been a real bad news weekend.

1908
01:35:56,380 --> 01:35:57,980
We have to close a beloved store.

1909
01:35:57,980 --> 01:36:00,540
It never feels good just logistically to have to do this.

1910
01:36:00,540 --> 01:36:02,780
And just we love this one in particular.

1911
01:36:02,780 --> 01:36:05,500
And you guys helped make it fun for us.

1912
01:36:05,500 --> 01:36:07,660
What could have been a bummer of a weekend?

1913
01:36:08,140 --> 01:36:12,540
It's like we got to celebrate this place instead of it just shutting down forever.

1914
01:36:12,980 --> 01:36:15,300
Yeah, that's I met the store manager.

1915
01:36:15,420 --> 01:36:16,580
People were like that.

1916
01:36:16,580 --> 01:36:20,740
People. What's so funny is because like it was really fun and positive.

1917
01:36:20,740 --> 01:36:22,940
Everyone was like, cool with us, like hanging out.

1918
01:36:23,060 --> 01:36:25,860
But I still felt like the employees were like, I think, can they really like

1919
01:36:25,860 --> 01:36:29,500
it's just like taking up real estate in the middle of the aisles?

1920
01:36:29,700 --> 01:36:31,460
It felt weird. I know.

1921
01:36:31,460 --> 01:36:33,980
And the manager's like, thank you so much for coming.

1922
01:36:34,300 --> 01:36:35,980
And I was like, well, you're welcome.

1923
01:36:35,980 --> 01:36:38,900
Like, well, it was I was I'm saying it was positive,

1924
01:36:39,140 --> 01:36:41,460
despite like I was just like, not sure.

1925
01:36:42,060 --> 01:36:42,780
Yeah, I didn't.

1926
01:36:42,780 --> 01:36:45,900
I was so relieved to walk in and realize a group had already gathered

1927
01:36:45,900 --> 01:36:47,300
and they had not stopped it.

1928
01:36:47,300 --> 01:36:50,620
I was worried I'd be giving a speech and then somebody would walk up and go, hey,

1929
01:36:50,780 --> 01:36:52,100
what the hell are you doing here?

1930
01:36:52,100 --> 01:36:53,660
And we all have to run away.

1931
01:36:53,660 --> 01:36:55,500
But no, we could not have been more welcome.

1932
01:36:55,500 --> 01:36:59,820
We did a private show in the screening room, which we were led in to do.

1933
01:37:00,020 --> 01:37:02,740
It was it was honestly it was an immersive.

1934
01:37:02,740 --> 01:37:04,060
If you're a listener.

1935
01:37:04,060 --> 01:37:07,300
Yes. It was an immersive of walking around the store with us.

1936
01:37:07,300 --> 01:37:12,140
Live flash fries, which we couldn't do this in a theme park.

1937
01:37:12,140 --> 01:37:15,540
We couldn't get we get to like, no, this got to be like a for one after

1938
01:37:15,540 --> 01:37:17,820
you in a podcast, the ride themed environment.

1939
01:37:17,980 --> 01:37:23,020
Yeah, one of the hosts is up on the walls play like my voice is echoing.

1940
01:37:23,140 --> 01:37:24,500
You can meet us.

1941
01:37:24,500 --> 01:37:26,780
We're doing a live little show for you.

1942
01:37:26,940 --> 01:37:30,260
We're talking to people about others that just became a fan meet and greet.

1943
01:37:31,060 --> 01:37:35,460
I made the offer that we if you bought something from the store,

1944
01:37:35,460 --> 01:37:38,860
you know, go support the store and then bring it back to us and we would sign it.

1945
01:37:39,140 --> 01:37:40,980
We had to sign.

1946
01:37:41,700 --> 01:37:42,540
Incredible.

1947
01:37:43,700 --> 01:37:45,540
We had to sign all this fun shit.

1948
01:37:45,540 --> 01:37:49,220
Somebody bought like, you know, the kind of implement you'd use to like

1949
01:37:49,460 --> 01:37:51,780
pull a pizza out of an oven.

1950
01:37:51,780 --> 01:37:54,660
And he was like, well, this is the closest thing we could find to a paddle,

1951
01:37:55,100 --> 01:37:57,340
a paddle for your ass.

1952
01:37:57,340 --> 01:38:01,500
As the the guy from the rainforest camp they would tell me for data.

1953
01:38:02,220 --> 01:38:03,260
What would we sign?

1954
01:38:03,260 --> 01:38:03,860
What did you sign?

1955
01:38:03,860 --> 01:38:06,420
I signed women in black, an adult movie.

1956
01:38:06,420 --> 01:38:08,580
So I saw, yeah, men in black porno.

1957
01:38:08,820 --> 01:38:10,620
Yeah, because they still have a porno.

1958
01:38:11,580 --> 01:38:13,540
That was the big surprise to me.

1959
01:38:13,540 --> 01:38:14,980
They have pornography.

1960
01:38:14,980 --> 01:38:18,620
And OK, little warning, do the little skip ahead if you don't want to hear

1961
01:38:18,700 --> 01:38:21,580
dirty words, because I can't not say so.

1962
01:38:21,700 --> 01:38:25,580
A listener, Andrew, found this probably the funniest item in the store.

1963
01:38:25,580 --> 01:38:27,060
Women in black, too.

1964
01:38:27,060 --> 01:38:32,660
And it had the tagline protecting the earth from the come of the universe.

1965
01:38:32,700 --> 01:38:34,420
Yeah, now that's that's funny.

1966
01:38:34,420 --> 01:38:35,900
I don't care who you are right there.

1967
01:38:35,900 --> 01:38:37,260
That's funny.

1968
01:38:37,260 --> 01:38:39,020
The come of the universe.

1969
01:38:39,020 --> 01:38:43,060
Yeah, because the tagline, in case you don't remember, is the scum.

1970
01:38:43,060 --> 01:38:44,700
Scum of the universe.

1971
01:38:44,700 --> 01:38:46,060
So it was sitting right there.

1972
01:38:46,060 --> 01:38:49,500
Which also like scum is like kind of a derivative of like that.

1973
01:38:49,500 --> 01:38:51,820
They're in the same ballpark there, I think.

1974
01:38:51,860 --> 01:38:52,740
I suppose so.

1975
01:38:52,740 --> 01:38:56,300
But that was just the I mean, people were buying the 85 cent

1976
01:38:56,300 --> 01:39:01,940
branded fries, water bottles, which featured gorillas or apes

1977
01:39:02,380 --> 01:39:06,340
going crazy for electron for like palm pilots and laptops.

1978
01:39:06,660 --> 01:39:08,460
I regret not buying one.

1979
01:39:08,460 --> 01:39:11,980
Someone found a dirty cyborg Funko pop.

1980
01:39:12,220 --> 01:39:17,660
And then my favorite, a dog eared 2011 farmers

1981
01:39:17,660 --> 01:39:22,220
almanac, very dog, very dog eared 2011.

1982
01:39:22,260 --> 01:39:25,020
We are still selling for five sixty nine.

1983
01:39:25,020 --> 01:39:28,500
I would say that I did not get a good chance to walk around the fries

1984
01:39:28,500 --> 01:39:30,740
and because the people would bring this up to us.

1985
01:39:30,740 --> 01:39:34,580
And I would be like, this does not feel like it's sold in a

1986
01:39:34,660 --> 01:39:37,820
an electronics store in 2020. Right.

1987
01:39:38,340 --> 01:39:40,620
But apparently there's a bunch of like,

1988
01:39:41,260 --> 01:39:44,300
like the porno, the porno that we signed,

1989
01:39:45,300 --> 01:39:48,340
it felt like it had been sitting there for 15 years.

1990
01:39:48,340 --> 01:39:51,740
Yeah. It's a parody of a movie from 2002.

1991
01:39:51,740 --> 01:39:53,980
What? Right. Yeah.

1992
01:39:53,980 --> 01:39:57,780
So and it was like the cover was falling off of it.

1993
01:39:58,340 --> 01:40:00,860
And I was like, they've just been there's just been a porno

1994
01:40:00,860 --> 01:40:04,460
sitting in this store for 20 plus, like 20 years.

1995
01:40:04,980 --> 01:40:07,020
There's another year skip ahead to I watched there.

1996
01:40:07,260 --> 01:40:09,340
There's another one called the skip ahead, skip ahead.

1997
01:40:09,580 --> 01:40:12,940
Complete and uncut a foreskin fantasy.

1998
01:40:13,140 --> 01:40:15,900
That was in fries. Yes. Yes.

1999
01:40:16,660 --> 01:40:19,660
This is so much weirder than the poop toys we talked about.

2000
01:40:19,660 --> 01:40:22,260
There were these series of toys that we talked about in the patron episode.

2001
01:40:22,260 --> 01:40:24,660
Someone who peruse, who peruse, thank you.

2002
01:40:24,660 --> 01:40:27,100
Thirty dollar casery phone case.

2003
01:40:27,380 --> 01:40:30,180
Oh, yeah. Same company from the profit.

2004
01:40:30,460 --> 01:40:31,820
Company. Yeah.

2005
01:40:31,820 --> 01:40:33,100
We should have written about it.

2006
01:40:33,100 --> 01:40:35,100
Apologies. I can't remember who bought what.

2007
01:40:35,100 --> 01:40:37,260
So Mia, I believe, who was that?

2008
01:40:37,260 --> 01:40:42,300
We made this part of a vacation from Canada, from Canada, going to Disneyland

2009
01:40:43,060 --> 01:40:46,820
and doing the full like Disneyland Hotel,

2010
01:40:48,860 --> 01:40:50,940
Napa Road, doing the full giant.

2011
01:40:50,940 --> 01:40:53,420
The whole and this happened to fall circuit towards.

2012
01:40:53,460 --> 01:40:55,260
Yeah, I'm so happy.

2013
01:40:55,260 --> 01:40:58,260
The fact that this was at the Anaheim one of all of them,

2014
01:40:58,580 --> 01:41:02,380
that we were and I turned it into a then I went and I had a celebration

2015
01:41:02,380 --> 01:41:04,860
drink at Ralph Brennan's Jazz Kitchen. Sure.

2016
01:41:04,860 --> 01:41:07,180
At a sass, a manhattan.

2017
01:41:07,460 --> 01:41:11,100
I mean, hopefully other people turned it into a little Disneyland.

2018
01:41:11,220 --> 01:41:14,620
That it was so close to our favorite park.

2019
01:41:14,820 --> 01:41:16,180
My favorite store.

2020
01:41:16,180 --> 01:41:20,460
This is just such a a heartwarming event, a podcast, the riot immersive.

2021
01:41:20,660 --> 01:41:21,900
It plants the seed.

2022
01:41:21,900 --> 01:41:24,420
Can we do more podcasts, the riot immersive?

2023
01:41:24,420 --> 01:41:28,580
Well, it's funny you bring that up because we've maybe talked about it.

2024
01:41:28,580 --> 01:41:31,340
How we have I'm pimping you out a little.

2025
01:41:31,340 --> 01:41:32,540
Yes, we have this.

2026
01:41:32,540 --> 01:41:36,460
If you're interested in this idea, whatever it is, the general notion of this,

2027
01:41:36,700 --> 01:41:37,820
please let us know.

2028
01:41:37,820 --> 01:41:41,740
Yeah, but it made me excited for a little like, yeah, a little happenings.

2029
01:41:41,740 --> 01:41:43,980
There's a yeah, there will be more happenings to come.

2030
01:41:43,980 --> 01:41:46,580
I don't know. We don't have such a solid idea, but there are.

2031
01:41:46,900 --> 01:41:50,940
I mean, look, maybe we'll hit hit up the last hour of Operation of the Fries,

2032
01:41:50,940 --> 01:41:55,060
Anaheim and buy one of the many copies of Mad Max, Fury Road and screen that.

2033
01:41:55,500 --> 01:41:59,620
We're one of the many copies of Red Bull's sports movie.

2034
01:41:59,620 --> 01:42:03,860
Red Bull, that's what they had a ton of money into very beautiful

2035
01:42:03,860 --> 01:42:06,740
4K like snowboarding and skydiving.

2036
01:42:06,740 --> 01:42:12,060
They had a giant box set massive with multiple carabiners and keychains

2037
01:42:12,180 --> 01:42:15,300
of Red Bull's extreme sports collection.

2038
01:42:15,500 --> 01:42:16,580
There were 50 of those.

2039
01:42:16,580 --> 01:42:21,020
There was only one copy of the 70s film FM starring Howard

2040
01:42:21,020 --> 01:42:24,300
Hesman that they were selling for 30 dollars.

2041
01:42:24,540 --> 01:42:27,140
Still, they are like cutting the prices.

2042
01:42:27,180 --> 01:42:28,780
Yes, nothing was marked out.

2043
01:42:28,780 --> 01:42:32,300
Dirty cyborg was still there was a collection of three

2044
01:42:32,940 --> 01:42:34,700
three movies I'd never heard of.

2045
01:42:34,700 --> 01:42:36,940
And it was called the Mother Trucker Collection.

2046
01:42:37,460 --> 01:42:39,540
And it was just, I think, like

2047
01:42:39,540 --> 01:42:42,700
like women in hot pants, like driving cars.

2048
01:42:42,700 --> 01:42:44,700
Sure. Maybe killing people.

2049
01:42:44,700 --> 01:42:46,500
I don't know. And I was like, what?

2050
01:42:46,500 --> 01:42:49,700
And there's like thirty five dollars.

2051
01:42:49,700 --> 01:42:51,300
They're standing there. Wait a minute.

2052
01:42:51,300 --> 01:42:54,860
What? Did this ever sell for thirty five dollars?

2053
01:42:54,860 --> 01:42:58,220
One of you said there's a whole aisle of reading glasses

2054
01:42:58,220 --> 01:43:02,580
and then a few minutes later, I saw someone walking to the register

2055
01:43:02,580 --> 01:43:06,700
with a brand new pair of reading glasses to purchase. Wow.

2056
01:43:06,740 --> 01:43:09,420
Yeah. We were in there for like two hours and I do.

2057
01:43:09,420 --> 01:43:13,900
The only regret I have is that I didn't go aisle by aisle.

2058
01:43:13,900 --> 01:43:14,980
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

2059
01:43:14,980 --> 01:43:16,660
Try to figure out the word.

2060
01:43:16,660 --> 01:43:19,820
I meant to get a what to see smoothie before it closed.

2061
01:43:20,020 --> 01:43:23,820
I think they were not running the smoothies, but like, OK, pretty good store.

2062
01:43:23,820 --> 01:43:25,660
Right. You guys haven't been before.

2063
01:43:25,660 --> 01:43:26,820
Yeah, no, I had to see it.

2064
01:43:26,820 --> 01:43:28,140
No, that's two days.

2065
01:43:28,140 --> 01:43:32,340
The the there's a giant shuttle in the back of this.

2066
01:43:32,340 --> 01:43:35,380
Like, it's so impressive that they can't move.

2067
01:43:35,380 --> 01:43:36,860
That's like built into the store.

2068
01:43:36,860 --> 01:43:38,300
So you have to blow it up.

2069
01:43:38,300 --> 01:43:40,820
Yeah, maybe. Or that'll just be whatever it turns into.

2070
01:43:40,820 --> 01:43:42,580
Club now has a.

2071
01:43:42,580 --> 01:43:46,780
Well, I was saying to some listeners that if any fries close,

2072
01:43:46,780 --> 01:43:49,100
they should reopen a Toys R Us inside of it.

2073
01:43:49,100 --> 01:43:52,620
Oh, yes. But yeah, Toys R Us is a real.

2074
01:43:52,660 --> 01:43:54,340
Oh, and that with a space show. Right.

2075
01:43:54,340 --> 01:43:55,100
That's what I was saying.

2076
01:43:55,100 --> 01:43:57,500
I was saying if they close any of the ones with the theming,

2077
01:43:57,500 --> 01:43:59,740
how about Toys R Us reopens in there?

2078
01:43:59,740 --> 01:44:03,420
But that's a whole nother episode about what's going on with the Toys R Us company.

2079
01:44:03,460 --> 01:44:04,820
Yeah. Yeah.

2080
01:44:04,820 --> 01:44:08,820
Now we did another bit of inside information with the Woodland Hills fries,

2081
01:44:08,820 --> 01:44:12,300
which is themed after Alice in Wonderland and like really detailed

2082
01:44:12,300 --> 01:44:14,380
Lewis Carroll style drones. Yeah.

2083
01:44:15,460 --> 01:44:18,380
There is a news story officially saying that it is closing

2084
01:44:18,700 --> 01:44:22,020
and it may be someday, but we have the inside line

2085
01:44:22,020 --> 01:44:24,300
that it will be open through all of 2020.

2086
01:44:24,620 --> 01:44:26,380
So get to that store.

2087
01:44:26,380 --> 01:44:29,340
Yeah. And I'll give this little tease.

2088
01:44:29,500 --> 01:44:33,540
There's a possibility of a podcast, the right presence in there.

2089
01:44:33,580 --> 01:44:35,900
Maybe, maybe just an idea.

2090
01:44:35,940 --> 01:44:36,940
We've thrown us in there.

2091
01:44:36,940 --> 01:44:41,580
And the real cliffhanger, because I don't even want to consider this fries, too.

2092
01:44:41,620 --> 01:44:44,900
I think there's maybe still a fries to full episode to do.

2093
01:44:45,220 --> 01:44:47,740
But I think maybe it can't happen until this plays itself out.

2094
01:44:48,060 --> 01:44:50,620
This may not be the end of astronaut Scott.

2095
01:44:51,540 --> 01:44:55,700
Astronaut Scott may still have a future in the fries chain.

2096
01:44:55,700 --> 01:44:56,540
And I'll leave it at that.

2097
01:44:56,540 --> 01:44:57,260
Oh, interesting.

2098
01:44:57,260 --> 01:45:00,620
Someone's going back to the moon.

2099
01:45:00,620 --> 01:45:02,460
Is it have anything to do in orbit?

2100
01:45:02,460 --> 01:45:06,700
Does it have anything to do with a movie that they will sell on a fries?

2101
01:45:06,700 --> 01:45:10,180
That is an astronaut porno.

2102
01:45:10,180 --> 01:45:12,500
As an Apollo 13.

2103
01:45:12,500 --> 01:45:14,540
It's yeah, it's Apollo 69.

2104
01:45:14,540 --> 01:45:16,300
It's yeah.

2105
01:45:16,300 --> 01:45:18,020
Well, I'm going to I'm doing a couple.

2106
01:45:18,020 --> 01:45:20,980
I'm going to do Apollo 69 and I'm going to do the white stuff,

2107
01:45:21,780 --> 01:45:23,500
which is, of course, referring to.

2108
01:45:23,500 --> 01:45:24,340
Yeah. Oh, I understand.

2109
01:45:24,340 --> 01:45:25,140
Please skip ahead.

2110
01:45:25,140 --> 01:45:26,980
Oh, yeah. Hey, I don't have to say it.

2111
01:45:26,980 --> 01:45:28,780
I'm not going to say.

2112
01:45:28,780 --> 01:45:32,380
So thank you all for making this happen.

2113
01:45:32,500 --> 01:45:35,060
This was such a delight to be in that story.

2114
01:45:35,060 --> 01:45:38,580
A year later, I was on the same platform.

2115
01:45:38,580 --> 01:45:41,060
I was so delighted by and now I'm in the video.

2116
01:45:41,420 --> 01:45:43,700
It was, by the way, so aggressive to be in there.

2117
01:45:43,780 --> 01:45:45,220
My same voice clip.

2118
01:45:45,220 --> 01:45:47,700
And I also did the countdown seven, six.

2119
01:45:47,820 --> 01:45:52,260
So there's my voice playing aggressively nonstop in the store for two, two days.

2120
01:45:52,460 --> 01:45:53,580
Kind of maddening.

2121
01:45:53,580 --> 01:45:57,220
But so very surreal and so fun to see listeners.

2122
01:45:57,220 --> 01:45:59,380
You made it happen. Thank you so much for making it happen.

2123
01:46:00,020 --> 01:46:03,100
Thank you to our fan, BD, our fan, listener, BD,

2124
01:46:03,860 --> 01:46:06,500
who is documenting a lot of this, taking a lot of great photos.

2125
01:46:06,500 --> 01:46:09,820
And in fact, on her YouTube theme park ASMR,

2126
01:46:09,940 --> 01:46:13,660
you can watch our impromptu interview with Billy

2127
01:46:14,420 --> 01:46:17,900
in the live from the Anaheim Prize Prize presentation room.

2128
01:46:17,980 --> 01:46:20,060
So thank you, BD, for that.

2129
01:46:20,060 --> 01:46:23,460
And yeah, look, not only not only for us, did we have fun,

2130
01:46:23,460 --> 01:46:26,420
but I think we helped this poor store that's going out of business

2131
01:46:26,420 --> 01:46:27,860
have a good last weekend.

2132
01:46:27,860 --> 01:46:30,300
We all made some good stuff happen here.

2133
01:46:30,580 --> 01:46:33,540
Yeah, I was I was blown away by a lot of things.

2134
01:46:33,580 --> 01:46:35,620
I think I said this before we started recording.

2135
01:46:35,620 --> 01:46:40,380
I was impressed at how many people online said that this whole thing made them cry.

2136
01:46:41,260 --> 01:46:45,140
Cry. People shed tears over this.

2137
01:46:45,140 --> 01:46:47,140
Our friend, Eva Anderson, apparently.

2138
01:46:47,140 --> 01:46:48,700
I'm so touched by this.

2139
01:46:48,700 --> 01:46:49,700
This is incredible.

2140
01:46:49,700 --> 01:46:51,500
I didn't know the podcast would be.

2141
01:46:51,500 --> 01:46:55,660
I didn't know we'd get here and how we like somehow the story

2142
01:46:55,660 --> 01:47:00,900
with the most heart involved me seeing a funny video in a store,

2143
01:47:00,900 --> 01:47:04,940
going to Carthay Circle, drinking Manhattan's and saying, what if I was in the video?

2144
01:47:05,420 --> 01:47:09,300
And suddenly it's become a journey.

2145
01:47:14,220 --> 01:47:16,540
Oh, well, I was going to say,

2146
01:47:16,860 --> 01:47:22,220
because I ended up feeling not like Anne Hathaway in Les Miserables,

2147
01:47:22,500 --> 01:47:27,780
but rather Anne Hathaway accepting her Oscar for Les Miserables and saying,

2148
01:47:28,220 --> 01:47:30,580
it came true.

2149
01:47:30,580 --> 01:47:31,940
That's exactly how I felt.

2150
01:47:31,940 --> 01:47:33,460
Oh, no. Yeah, you're right.

2151
01:47:33,460 --> 01:47:37,500
What happens next is America going like, fuck you.

2152
01:47:37,820 --> 01:47:40,780
Oh, no, shit. The backlash for seemingly

2153
01:47:41,460 --> 01:47:44,300
indescribable reasons, just confusingly.

2154
01:47:44,340 --> 01:47:45,540
Just everyone turned on.

2155
01:47:45,540 --> 01:47:49,340
Well, I have already experienced people turning on me for confusing reasons.

2156
01:47:49,460 --> 01:47:52,700
That being not liking a boat ride where you see lots of plants.

2157
01:47:52,700 --> 01:47:54,540
This has been a real whiplash, too, for you.

2158
01:47:54,540 --> 01:47:55,420
Yeah. Yeah.

2159
01:47:55,420 --> 01:48:00,340
I swung from show villain Hollywood Gardner heel to mega face.

2160
01:48:00,780 --> 01:48:05,740
Like, really, if we're going wrestling and who knows, I may swing back again.

2161
01:48:05,740 --> 01:48:07,100
I'm the wild card.

2162
01:48:07,100 --> 01:48:08,340
You never know where I'm going to fall.

2163
01:48:08,340 --> 01:48:12,340
Wrestling always says the guy who's turned heel and face the most is the big show.

2164
01:48:13,220 --> 01:48:16,820
So maybe you'll be the big show of the podcast, the ride.

2165
01:48:16,980 --> 01:48:20,500
You'll turn heel and face so many times people won't be able to track it.

2166
01:48:20,900 --> 01:48:22,540
Maybe that's my thing. Yeah.

2167
01:48:22,540 --> 01:48:25,300
Just a wild constant back and forth up and down.

2168
01:48:25,580 --> 01:48:27,860
Do you hate me? Do you love me?

2169
01:48:27,860 --> 01:48:30,500
I think I make you feel something either way.

2170
01:48:30,580 --> 01:48:32,460
That's the point.

2171
01:48:32,460 --> 01:48:35,180
And one more thing, I was going to say this in the speech,

2172
01:48:35,180 --> 01:48:37,340
but then you weren't there at the speech.

2173
01:48:37,740 --> 01:48:40,420
But I just I thought if you know, if we can do this,

2174
01:48:40,980 --> 01:48:44,100
if a small town podcaster can become

2175
01:48:44,580 --> 01:48:49,540
the astronaut in a store that is about to close, who knows what else is possible?

2176
01:48:49,540 --> 01:48:53,540
Why couldn't another small town podcaster become the mayor of Disneyland?

2177
01:48:53,860 --> 01:48:55,220
It's true. You're right.

2178
01:48:55,220 --> 01:48:57,060
We're in an election year.

2179
01:48:57,060 --> 01:49:00,540
Mm hmm. I've got the endorsement of the Wall Street Journal.

2180
01:49:01,380 --> 01:49:03,540
That's true. Hey, that's also happened.

2181
01:49:03,540 --> 01:49:06,220
That too. Jason, was that this week too?

2182
01:49:06,340 --> 01:49:10,100
Yeah, that was I think I found out about it Sunday or Monday.

2183
01:49:10,580 --> 01:49:13,260
I didn't find out about it until a few days after it ran.

2184
01:49:13,260 --> 01:49:15,580
End of February. God bless you.

2185
01:49:15,580 --> 01:49:17,500
I got the Wall Street Journal Stipple Drawing.

2186
01:49:17,500 --> 01:49:19,140
Someone was drawing you.

2187
01:49:19,140 --> 01:49:21,780
Someone's right. I had to send I had to provide a picture

2188
01:49:22,700 --> 01:49:24,660
so they could do the Stipple Drawing.

2189
01:49:24,660 --> 01:49:29,620
It was yes, like the like this very traditional style of newspaper drawing.

2190
01:49:29,820 --> 01:49:35,420
And the drawings were done of an NFL star of was it was NBA?

2191
01:49:35,420 --> 01:49:37,420
It was the Milwaukee Bucks.

2192
01:49:37,420 --> 01:49:39,380
Yes, perhaps. OK. Yeah.

2193
01:49:39,540 --> 01:49:42,980
Amanda Lund, a former Disney princess and a great comedian writer

2194
01:49:42,980 --> 01:49:48,980
who has been on our show yourself and Tony Baxter, our hero.

2195
01:49:49,340 --> 01:49:50,900
We're her imaginary legend.

2196
01:49:50,900 --> 01:49:53,060
Tony Baxter, we're all done in the same style,

2197
01:49:53,060 --> 01:49:56,420
because at the end of the day, we're all just we're all just Disney fans.

2198
01:49:56,420 --> 01:49:58,660
We're all just do you think unites us all?

2199
01:49:58,860 --> 01:50:01,500
Tony had to have seen that.

2200
01:50:01,500 --> 01:50:04,700
I mean, that guy about 50 50,

2201
01:50:04,700 --> 01:50:07,380
whether people could get past the paywall or not.

2202
01:50:07,620 --> 01:50:08,900
Oh, yeah, it's hard. No, but I think.

2203
01:50:08,900 --> 01:50:11,300
Oh, yes. Yeah, I did once and then didn't another time.

2204
01:50:11,300 --> 01:50:14,540
For whatever reason, it worked on my phone and then nothing else.

2205
01:50:16,420 --> 01:50:18,940
Yeah. I so insane.

2206
01:50:19,020 --> 01:50:21,140
There's that guy who asked me about ice cream.

2207
01:50:22,140 --> 01:50:24,100
Talking about ice cream.

2208
01:50:24,100 --> 01:50:26,180
Talking about ice cream again.

2209
01:50:26,180 --> 01:50:28,300
Well, guys, I you know what?

2210
01:50:28,300 --> 01:50:32,740
I'm always going to be fond of that final week, that leap week of February

2211
01:50:32,980 --> 01:50:34,780
2020. That was really something.

2212
01:50:34,860 --> 01:50:39,100
And maybe, maybe the rise of JPEG is a good thing.

2213
01:50:39,140 --> 01:50:40,860
Maybe, maybe a boat.

2214
01:50:40,860 --> 01:50:46,780
It's a great new era that'll be distinctly Disney, but authentically podcast

2215
01:50:46,780 --> 01:50:51,580
the right. And folks, you survived podcast the ride.

2216
01:50:52,060 --> 01:50:53,060
Boy, that was something.

2217
01:50:53,060 --> 01:50:57,100
If you didn't hear the beginning of all this fries nonsense and,

2218
01:50:57,500 --> 01:51:01,620
you know, and for more great stuff, as always, and for eventually fries to big

2219
01:51:01,620 --> 01:51:06,500
teaser, go to a page around dot com slash podcast the ride, the second gate

2220
01:51:06,500 --> 01:51:09,900
where you get five for five dollars, you get three bonus episodes every month.

2221
01:51:10,060 --> 01:51:13,180
And for all the other stuff and for videos of all of this,

2222
01:51:13,700 --> 01:51:17,580
the fries adventure, they go to our Twitter, our Instagram or our Facebook group

2223
01:51:17,580 --> 01:51:20,860
and go watch our live or our impromptu live show on YouTube.

2224
01:51:21,140 --> 01:51:23,860
Yeah, there's so much it has been documented.

2225
01:51:24,180 --> 01:51:26,180
I just briefly looked at all of this stuff.

2226
01:51:26,180 --> 01:51:28,340
It has been so well documented.

2227
01:51:29,300 --> 01:51:30,580
It's like the footage of it.

2228
01:51:30,580 --> 01:51:33,380
More well documented than some real space launches.

2229
01:51:33,380 --> 01:51:34,940
I was going to say, yeah, it's better.

2230
01:51:34,940 --> 01:51:36,020
Yeah, for sure.

2231
01:51:36,020 --> 01:51:38,180
Yeah, well, this is once in a lifetime.

2232
01:51:38,180 --> 01:51:40,700
Some people will say we faked this whole thing.

2233
01:51:43,060 --> 01:51:46,020
There are witnesses, I think, that we can prove.

2234
01:51:46,020 --> 01:51:48,660
It did happen in the warehouse in Anaheim.

2235
01:51:48,980 --> 01:51:50,980
This was not a hoax.

2236
01:51:50,980 --> 01:51:54,020
What is officially filmed in a warehouse south of Eaton Track?

2237
01:51:54,020 --> 01:51:55,900
Take take from that what you may.

2238
01:51:55,900 --> 01:51:58,220
They'll be truthers, but they're wrong.

2239
01:51:58,380 --> 01:51:59,900
We lived it. It happened.

2240
01:51:59,900 --> 01:52:01,780
It was there. We'll be back for more fun.

2241
01:52:01,780 --> 01:52:03,380
We have so much fun coming up in March.

2242
01:52:03,380 --> 01:52:05,220
So many great guests. Yeah.

2243
01:52:05,220 --> 01:52:07,500
Stay tuned. It's going to be another great month.

2244
01:52:08,580 --> 01:52:09,900
JPEG is going to be good to us all.

2245
01:52:09,900 --> 01:52:12,060
But bless JPEG and bless you.

2246
01:52:15,820 --> 01:52:17,940
