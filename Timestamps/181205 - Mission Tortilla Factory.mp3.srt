1
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:05,720
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:22,224 --> 00:00:26,164
And welcome to Podcast the Ride, the second goth.

3
00:00:26,224 --> 00:00:31,404
My name is Jason Sheridan, here with...

4
00:00:31,404 --> 00:00:32,824
Scott Gardner.

5
00:00:33,904 --> 00:00:34,424
And...

6
00:00:34,424 --> 00:00:36,304
As Miguel Carlson?

7
00:00:37,404 --> 00:00:41,444
Yes, now we're going to talk about the tortilla factory.

8
00:00:42,264 --> 00:00:43,984
And that is the extent of my Spanish,

9
00:00:44,004 --> 00:00:45,724
and I had to look up half those words.

10
00:00:45,884 --> 00:00:46,344
Phew.

11
00:00:46,564 --> 00:00:47,804
Did you take Spanish in high school?

12
00:00:47,844 --> 00:00:50,724
I took Spanish middle school through high school.

13
00:00:50,724 --> 00:00:51,124
Okay.

14
00:00:51,264 --> 00:00:52,384
And...

15
00:00:52,384 --> 00:00:53,284
I took French.

16
00:00:54,024 --> 00:00:55,544
Oh, how about that?

17
00:00:55,664 --> 00:00:57,044
My parents discouraged me from doing that

18
00:00:57,044 --> 00:00:58,824
because they thought Spanish should be more useful,

19
00:00:58,824 --> 00:01:00,024
but I forgot all the Spanish.

20
00:01:00,224 --> 00:01:00,744
Right, what was next?

21
00:01:00,744 --> 00:01:02,544
It could have been more useful.

22
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:04,264
It could have been more useful.

23
00:01:04,664 --> 00:01:07,724
I learned it, I learned the answers to the test.

24
00:01:07,784 --> 00:01:12,104
I learned how to take the test and memorize tenses and stuff,

25
00:01:12,184 --> 00:01:16,264
but they were not great at teaching like conversational,

26
00:01:16,904 --> 00:01:17,844
like actual Spanish.

27
00:01:19,864 --> 00:01:21,784
I took seven years of Spanish.

28
00:01:22,064 --> 00:01:22,624
Oh, wow.

29
00:01:22,844 --> 00:01:25,584
And you can't speak it at all.

30
00:01:25,824 --> 00:01:28,804
I can't, here and there, I get a little.

31
00:01:29,024 --> 00:01:30,424
What you said at the top, was it,

32
00:01:30,424 --> 00:01:31,984
welcome to podcast Ride the Second Gate?

33
00:01:32,144 --> 00:01:32,524
Yeah.

34
00:01:32,844 --> 00:01:35,724
Just for our listeners who may not want to look up

35
00:01:35,724 --> 00:01:36,524
what you said.

36
00:01:36,744 --> 00:01:40,704
And it was, and fuck, Scott Gardner and Mike Carlson.

37
00:01:41,044 --> 00:01:44,024
Yes, I segue to the say your name parts

38
00:01:44,024 --> 00:01:46,384
right as you were both taking sips of your beverages.

39
00:01:46,564 --> 00:01:48,964
My shorts, Mike Carlson, like something insulting.

40
00:01:49,204 --> 00:01:50,324
Did you say, did you insult us?

41
00:01:50,504 --> 00:01:50,664
No.

42
00:01:50,724 --> 00:01:50,984
No.

43
00:01:50,984 --> 00:01:54,164
No, I said hi and welcome to podcast Ride the Second Gate.

44
00:01:54,304 --> 00:01:56,884
I'm Jason Sheridan here with Mike Carlson and Scott Gardner.

45
00:01:56,884 --> 00:01:59,544
Today we're gonna talk about the tortilla factory.

46
00:01:59,704 --> 00:02:02,404
We're talking the Mission Tortilla Factory,

47
00:02:02,604 --> 00:02:05,584
an opening day California adventure attraction.

48
00:02:05,744 --> 00:02:07,824
And this is the first that we're quantifying

49
00:02:07,824 --> 00:02:10,964
in the quality, in the category C tickets.

50
00:02:11,344 --> 00:02:13,404
These are a little bit smaller

51
00:02:13,404 --> 00:02:18,044
and we're talking about the oddball little rides.

52
00:02:18,364 --> 00:02:21,944
That's, you know, the little rides that could

53
00:02:21,944 --> 00:02:24,764
or that tried to have could,

54
00:02:24,784 --> 00:02:27,984
but that people were not terribly fond of.

55
00:02:28,144 --> 00:02:29,764
But this one, I don't know.

56
00:02:30,004 --> 00:02:31,944
People seem to, here's what I know.

57
00:02:32,104 --> 00:02:35,264
We threw out the C ticket idea, kind of as a joke.

58
00:02:35,644 --> 00:02:36,904
One of them maybe could,

59
00:02:37,044 --> 00:02:38,964
what if one of them was the tortilla factory?

60
00:02:39,504 --> 00:02:42,964
Immediately several people said, please, the tortilla factory.

61
00:02:43,904 --> 00:02:45,524
And now you got it.

62
00:02:45,524 --> 00:02:46,484
Now you're in it.

63
00:02:46,504 --> 00:02:47,624
I hope you enjoy it.

64
00:02:47,664 --> 00:02:51,924
Which I wonder if that was subliminal suggestion on our part

65
00:02:51,924 --> 00:02:55,084
because we did capitalize that in the Patreon copy.

66
00:02:55,484 --> 00:02:57,284
Yeah, that might have provoked it.

67
00:02:57,644 --> 00:03:00,184
Or there's a lot of big tortilla heads out there.

68
00:03:00,184 --> 00:03:01,504
We'll find out.

69
00:03:01,844 --> 00:03:03,524
But yeah, one of the first attractions

70
00:03:03,524 --> 00:03:07,024
at California Adventure when it opened in February, 2001,

71
00:03:07,424 --> 00:03:09,644
it's certainly one of the attractions used

72
00:03:09,644 --> 00:03:11,644
to assail the entire park.

73
00:03:11,644 --> 00:03:15,484
And to say, across the way,

74
00:03:15,624 --> 00:03:17,224
you've got Splash Mountain and Indiana Jones.

75
00:03:17,544 --> 00:03:19,524
Here you have a tortilla factory.

76
00:03:19,724 --> 00:03:23,244
Now to a young Jason Sheridan, that's a selling point.

77
00:03:23,744 --> 00:03:25,644
That's a, whoa, I can't get a free tortilla

78
00:03:25,644 --> 00:03:26,404
over at Disneyland.

79
00:03:26,644 --> 00:03:29,104
I can't get anything free, really.

80
00:03:29,104 --> 00:03:32,124
You can really carbo load in the Pacific work area

81
00:03:32,124 --> 00:03:33,544
of California Adventure

82
00:03:33,544 --> 00:03:35,484
because you could do the sourdough bread tour,

83
00:03:35,584 --> 00:03:39,764
a future episode, and then do the tortilla factory

84
00:03:39,764 --> 00:03:41,364
and get a nice warm tortilla.

85
00:03:41,984 --> 00:03:44,204
You save 11 cents.

86
00:03:44,604 --> 00:03:44,624
Yes.

87
00:03:45,104 --> 00:03:46,544
The cheapest stuff to make.

88
00:03:46,564 --> 00:03:47,064
The cheapest stuff to make.

89
00:03:47,064 --> 00:03:48,124
They are handing out.

90
00:03:48,484 --> 00:03:49,764
Ooh, that'll come up later.

91
00:03:50,184 --> 00:03:51,004
Oh.

92
00:03:51,304 --> 00:03:53,364
So I wanna preface this by saying,

93
00:03:53,764 --> 00:03:56,804
this was, sometimes we'll be talking about doing episodes

94
00:03:56,804 --> 00:04:00,024
and one of us will kind of have an interest maybe

95
00:04:00,024 --> 00:04:01,704
that's stronger than the other on a topic

96
00:04:01,704 --> 00:04:03,444
and we'll say, you know, I'll sort of take the lead on this.

97
00:04:03,764 --> 00:04:06,824
This is maybe, I don't wanna say the first time,

98
00:04:06,824 --> 00:04:09,764
but maybe the most excited time that Jason has said,

99
00:04:09,784 --> 00:04:11,544
I'm gonna take the lead on this one.

100
00:04:11,664 --> 00:04:14,244
Like this is, you showed a very specific interest

101
00:04:14,244 --> 00:04:15,544
in this topic.

102
00:04:15,944 --> 00:04:18,484
Well, I thought it was also my turn to kind of take,

103
00:04:18,584 --> 00:04:20,264
you kind of took the lead on Botanicus.

104
00:04:20,544 --> 00:04:21,804
No, don't try to undersell it.

105
00:04:21,884 --> 00:04:24,104
I'm just saying there was, you had a special connection

106
00:04:24,104 --> 00:04:27,124
to this tortilla factory tour.

107
00:04:27,344 --> 00:04:28,524
I used to, I thought it was fun.

108
00:04:29,084 --> 00:04:30,104
Sure. You know, you go through,

109
00:04:30,244 --> 00:04:31,524
you learn how tortillas are made,

110
00:04:31,624 --> 00:04:33,884
you get to weigh yourself at the end

111
00:04:33,884 --> 00:04:36,424
and see how many tortilla, of course, the scale

112
00:04:36,424 --> 00:04:38,464
that would tell you how many tortillas you were.

113
00:04:38,584 --> 00:04:39,404
How is this for you?

114
00:04:39,504 --> 00:04:41,344
As far as I can, you did the episode,

115
00:04:41,564 --> 00:04:42,964
just shouldn't we be done now?

116
00:04:43,004 --> 00:04:45,084
You just said everything that can be done there.

117
00:04:45,104 --> 00:04:47,744
No, no, this rabbit hole goes much deeper.

118
00:04:48,244 --> 00:04:49,084
I am excited.

119
00:04:49,344 --> 00:04:50,664
All right, take us through it.

120
00:04:51,004 --> 00:04:54,004
So yeah, this open February 8th, 2001,

121
00:04:54,124 --> 00:04:56,764
opening day California Adventure Attraction

122
00:04:56,764 --> 00:04:59,584
closed May 31st, 2011.

123
00:04:59,824 --> 00:05:02,924
So over 10 years, this ride was operating.

124
00:05:02,984 --> 00:05:04,464
Ride, sort of.

125
00:05:04,464 --> 00:05:04,984
It's not a ride.

126
00:05:05,184 --> 00:05:06,064
It's a walkthrough.

127
00:05:06,684 --> 00:05:08,184
This building was open.

128
00:05:09,024 --> 00:05:10,764
And there's this area of California Adventure

129
00:05:10,764 --> 00:05:13,104
that is still there, that's the Pacific Wharf.

130
00:05:13,564 --> 00:05:15,164
And the good side of it,

131
00:05:15,164 --> 00:05:17,284
it's where you get some of the better food in that park

132
00:05:17,284 --> 00:05:19,224
and drinks and everything.

133
00:05:19,404 --> 00:05:19,864
Margaritas.

134
00:05:20,044 --> 00:05:22,564
And margaritas and Carl Strauss beers

135
00:05:22,564 --> 00:05:24,724
and Alcoholics Carl Strauss beers.

136
00:05:25,084 --> 00:05:27,744
And then there's these factory tours.

137
00:05:28,024 --> 00:05:29,324
There's a sourdough factory that's still there.

138
00:05:29,584 --> 00:05:30,804
And then there's a tortilla factory.

139
00:05:31,184 --> 00:05:34,824
This all was stuff that Eisner was very excited about.

140
00:05:35,244 --> 00:05:37,644
Like you, Jason, used it as a selling point.

141
00:05:37,744 --> 00:05:38,924
He's like, and we're gonna,

142
00:05:39,864 --> 00:05:44,764
this isn't just like a lip service tribute to the state.

143
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:46,464
We're gonna show workers,

144
00:05:46,904 --> 00:05:49,504
Californian workers doing their thing.

145
00:05:49,784 --> 00:05:50,864
He thought this was great.

146
00:05:51,164 --> 00:05:52,084
And he specifically,

147
00:05:52,384 --> 00:05:54,324
I was trying to find a quote where he said that.

148
00:05:54,424 --> 00:05:59,724
He's a little more verbose about the Bountiful Valley Farm,

149
00:05:59,944 --> 00:06:02,284
which was this very tepid area

150
00:06:02,284 --> 00:06:04,724
that was the first thing torn out.

151
00:06:04,724 --> 00:06:06,104
I believe for the,

152
00:06:06,104 --> 00:06:08,504
it's tough to be a bug or a bugs land.

153
00:06:09,264 --> 00:06:14,284
So Eisner loves getting to see how workers do their craft.

154
00:06:14,724 --> 00:06:15,064
Right.

155
00:06:15,144 --> 00:06:15,444
Yeah.

156
00:06:15,444 --> 00:06:17,284
That's another reason we gotta get him on.

157
00:06:17,384 --> 00:06:19,524
Cause he and Jason obviously share a lot in common

158
00:06:19,524 --> 00:06:21,324
about stuff they wanna see in a theme park.

159
00:06:21,344 --> 00:06:21,984
Oh, sure.

160
00:06:22,304 --> 00:06:25,544
I mean, I do think Pacific Wharf is like,

161
00:06:25,784 --> 00:06:28,824
for what it is, a glorified food court

162
00:06:28,824 --> 00:06:30,664
and some factory tours,

163
00:06:31,144 --> 00:06:33,684
there is some nice theming going on.

164
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:34,444
Oh yeah.

165
00:06:34,564 --> 00:06:35,884
Get to stand in a bucket of fish.

166
00:06:35,904 --> 00:06:37,224
Get to stand in a bucket of fish.

167
00:06:37,544 --> 00:06:37,744
Yeah.

168
00:06:38,164 --> 00:06:40,904
A little unnerving, the kind of,

169
00:06:40,904 --> 00:06:44,864
side of the building that's like Cannery Row themed.

170
00:06:45,164 --> 00:06:46,864
Cause I don't think that's a particularly

171
00:06:46,864 --> 00:06:48,364
optimistic Steinbeck.

172
00:06:48,364 --> 00:06:51,804
It's not a romantic vibe, no.

173
00:06:52,764 --> 00:06:57,384
So the description from the Mission Foods website

174
00:06:57,384 --> 00:06:59,304
about this attraction when it was open

175
00:06:59,304 --> 00:07:02,064
in a park that showcases the diversity

176
00:07:02,064 --> 00:07:04,444
of the California culture and landscape.

177
00:07:05,044 --> 00:07:08,184
Mission Foods is proud to demonstrate the history

178
00:07:08,184 --> 00:07:10,444
and the making of the traditional food

179
00:07:10,444 --> 00:07:13,764
of ancient and modern Mexico, the tortilla.

180
00:07:14,904 --> 00:07:17,124
Which, I mean, yes, that is all,

181
00:07:17,364 --> 00:07:18,524
that all makes sense.

182
00:07:18,544 --> 00:07:22,364
This made sense in the storytelling as, you know,

183
00:07:22,364 --> 00:07:26,764
there was a very large Latino population in California,

184
00:07:26,884 --> 00:07:28,524
especially Southern California.

185
00:07:29,764 --> 00:07:32,844
I think it's something like the second biggest

186
00:07:32,844 --> 00:07:38,404
Mexican population outside of Mexico is Southern California.

187
00:07:38,404 --> 00:07:40,624
I'm not a hundred percent sure on that statistic,

188
00:07:40,624 --> 00:07:43,464
but it kind of makes sense.

189
00:07:43,664 --> 00:07:47,984
And Mission Foods was founded in Los Angeles

190
00:07:47,984 --> 00:07:50,584
in, I believe the 1970s,

191
00:07:50,584 --> 00:07:53,764
but we'll put an asterisk on that and come back to it later.

192
00:07:55,824 --> 00:07:59,644
So this attraction used to have two giant,

193
00:07:59,664 --> 00:08:02,444
it kind of started outside with two giant silos.

194
00:08:02,744 --> 00:08:03,684
Two big silos.

195
00:08:04,184 --> 00:08:06,444
Of corn and wheat flour.

196
00:08:07,464 --> 00:08:08,584
Let's see, 14,000.

197
00:08:08,584 --> 00:08:11,744
But they didn't let you jump into it and swim around.

198
00:08:12,584 --> 00:08:15,524
14,000 pounds of corn flour,

199
00:08:15,824 --> 00:08:18,644
which could make 408,000 tortillas

200
00:08:18,644 --> 00:08:21,244
and 15,000 pounds of wheat flour,

201
00:08:21,244 --> 00:08:24,244
which could make 390,000 tortillas.

202
00:08:24,784 --> 00:08:26,924
So you would see those big drums outside.

203
00:08:27,464 --> 00:08:28,184
Drums.

204
00:08:28,444 --> 00:08:29,784
Big drums, big silos.

205
00:08:30,264 --> 00:08:30,604
Flour.

206
00:08:31,024 --> 00:08:33,084
And then you would go inside

207
00:08:33,084 --> 00:08:36,784
and the first room was a pre-show video

208
00:08:36,784 --> 00:08:39,384
of children giving a presentation

209
00:08:39,384 --> 00:08:41,164
about the history of the tortilla.

210
00:08:41,344 --> 00:08:43,924
Like doing like a monotone book report

211
00:08:43,924 --> 00:08:45,984
that's in that little kid zone,

212
00:08:46,004 --> 00:08:48,224
like how they say, I pledge allegiance.

213
00:08:50,704 --> 00:08:52,004
Got annoying pretty quick.

214
00:08:52,444 --> 00:08:54,804
And also a little weird to think about like,

215
00:08:54,924 --> 00:08:58,064
wait, so the pre-show video on this is children

216
00:08:58,064 --> 00:08:59,384
doing a presentation.

217
00:08:59,544 --> 00:09:01,504
Oh, what's the pre-show video at the sourdough?

218
00:09:01,704 --> 00:09:05,564
Oh, it's the two big ABC stars of the time.

219
00:09:05,744 --> 00:09:06,704
Colin Mochrie and Rosie O'Donnell.

220
00:09:06,704 --> 00:09:09,244
The biggest star on ABC, Colin Mochrie.

221
00:09:10,284 --> 00:09:13,204
Whose line in the Rosie show were big hits?

222
00:09:13,524 --> 00:09:14,024
This is true.

223
00:09:14,064 --> 00:09:16,964
I just don't think you'd call Colin Mochrie the number two.

224
00:09:17,184 --> 00:09:19,184
I didn't say one and two.

225
00:09:19,304 --> 00:09:20,444
I said two of the biggest.

226
00:09:20,444 --> 00:09:22,124
Wait, also Rosie was syndicated.

227
00:09:22,224 --> 00:09:23,944
Rosie was not on ABC.

228
00:09:24,164 --> 00:09:24,344
Was she syndicated?

229
00:09:24,344 --> 00:09:26,824
She was a syndicated daytime talk show.

230
00:09:26,884 --> 00:09:28,924
I think she was on NBC when I was watching.

231
00:09:28,944 --> 00:09:29,844
Was it an ABC Produce show?

232
00:09:29,844 --> 00:09:30,964
When I was watching it, Rosie every day.

233
00:09:30,964 --> 00:09:31,284
No.

234
00:09:31,344 --> 00:09:32,324
Or a touchstone?

235
00:09:32,324 --> 00:09:33,824
I mean, she did a lot with Disney.

236
00:09:33,944 --> 00:09:35,384
She was certainly very friendly with Disney.

237
00:09:35,404 --> 00:09:35,964
Okay.

238
00:09:36,944 --> 00:09:39,644
But two of the biggest stars on ABC.

239
00:09:39,644 --> 00:09:41,144
Two stars of their time.

240
00:09:41,464 --> 00:09:44,844
We're never gonna get through this if we...

241
00:09:44,844 --> 00:09:46,304
All right, I'll let you keep going.

242
00:09:46,844 --> 00:09:48,044
So, yeah.

243
00:09:48,124 --> 00:09:51,524
And you learn facts in that pre-show video.

244
00:09:52,424 --> 00:09:54,664
Like different groups.

245
00:09:56,144 --> 00:09:59,364
The Mayans and worshiped.

246
00:09:59,364 --> 00:10:02,964
Some would worship the tortilla as a god.

247
00:10:03,584 --> 00:10:05,824
Or worship, excuse me, worshiped corn as a god.

248
00:10:06,224 --> 00:10:08,384
The Mayan legend is that the tortilla was invented

249
00:10:08,384 --> 00:10:10,544
as a gift from the king.

250
00:10:12,164 --> 00:10:15,564
So there was animated interstitials telling you this.

251
00:10:15,744 --> 00:10:20,444
Including an animated dog who said maseca.

252
00:10:20,764 --> 00:10:24,004
Maseca is corn flour used now in modern times

253
00:10:24,004 --> 00:10:25,304
to make tortillas.

254
00:10:26,144 --> 00:10:28,504
Obviously the maseca dog will be getting his own episode.

255
00:10:28,824 --> 00:10:29,384
The maseca dog.

256
00:10:30,584 --> 00:10:32,084
I don't have a park star of him though.

257
00:10:32,284 --> 00:10:34,044
Then after this pre-show video,

258
00:10:34,484 --> 00:10:37,024
you were led into a little room

259
00:10:37,024 --> 00:10:41,164
with what I saw described online as little ghost windows.

260
00:10:41,484 --> 00:10:43,004
Little windows you would look in

261
00:10:43,004 --> 00:10:45,204
and see little ghost-like images,

262
00:10:45,564 --> 00:10:47,304
ghost people making tortillas.

263
00:10:47,724 --> 00:10:51,204
Similar to the effects from the...

264
00:10:51,204 --> 00:10:54,504
If you had wings or the Mexico boat ride

265
00:10:54,504 --> 00:10:55,904
on a much smaller scale.

266
00:10:55,984 --> 00:10:57,124
We're talking like...

267
00:10:57,124 --> 00:10:58,204
Trapped in tiny cells.

268
00:10:58,504 --> 00:11:00,644
Trapped in tiny cells that you could then walk up

269
00:11:00,644 --> 00:11:02,044
to a wall and stare at.

270
00:11:02,524 --> 00:11:04,284
And then you would go around the corner

271
00:11:04,284 --> 00:11:06,144
through two swinging double doors,

272
00:11:06,164 --> 00:11:08,344
which it's a little crazy to me

273
00:11:08,344 --> 00:11:10,144
that they were letting people just push

274
00:11:10,144 --> 00:11:11,784
through swinging double doors.

275
00:11:12,144 --> 00:11:15,824
Like all day, like that seems like someone...

276
00:11:15,824 --> 00:11:17,924
See a silo, push through a double door.

277
00:11:17,984 --> 00:11:19,024
Push through a double door.

278
00:11:19,944 --> 00:11:21,244
You would see... Watch a trapped ghost.

279
00:11:21,744 --> 00:11:24,004
See the sign that said production line

280
00:11:24,004 --> 00:11:26,324
from dough to tasty tortilla.

281
00:11:27,664 --> 00:11:29,824
So at this point I wanna do the first round

282
00:11:29,824 --> 00:11:32,024
of something I'm calling tortilla toss-up.

283
00:11:32,784 --> 00:11:35,124
Do you guys prefer corn or flour tortillas?

284
00:11:36,124 --> 00:11:39,504
Option three, a corn flour mix.

285
00:11:39,504 --> 00:11:42,064
At least when it comes to Trader Joe's products.

286
00:11:42,064 --> 00:11:45,084
The corn flour mix is fantastic.

287
00:11:45,624 --> 00:11:48,304
But if forced to choose between the two,

288
00:11:48,604 --> 00:11:51,724
if I feel like a treat, I will do flour.

289
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:56,744
If I feel like being on a diet or watching my figure,

290
00:11:57,044 --> 00:11:57,844
I'll do corn.

291
00:11:58,124 --> 00:11:59,604
But I'd probably veer corn more.

292
00:12:00,024 --> 00:12:01,004
I'm a flour man.

293
00:12:01,604 --> 00:12:04,844
All right, that was the end of tortilla toss-up.

294
00:12:05,244 --> 00:12:06,084
Round one.

295
00:12:06,744 --> 00:12:07,604
Do you get to play?

296
00:12:08,444 --> 00:12:09,684
Oh, yes.

297
00:12:09,824 --> 00:12:11,544
I will go with...

298
00:12:11,544 --> 00:12:13,324
Well, I mean, it's kind of dependent on what you're eating.

299
00:12:13,384 --> 00:12:15,164
You can't have a corn tortilla for burrito.

300
00:12:15,244 --> 00:12:15,984
That's ridiculous.

301
00:12:16,684 --> 00:12:17,764
You want a flour tortilla.

302
00:12:17,764 --> 00:12:18,704
Of course, it's not a stop.

303
00:12:18,724 --> 00:12:20,444
Corn tortilla for tacos.

304
00:12:21,564 --> 00:12:23,604
But usually I think I prefer flour.

305
00:12:23,824 --> 00:12:24,304
All right.

306
00:12:24,464 --> 00:12:25,904
And that has been...

307
00:12:25,904 --> 00:12:27,804
That round one of tortilla toss-up.

308
00:12:28,324 --> 00:12:30,464
So then you would go into the production room

309
00:12:30,464 --> 00:12:32,704
and learn about how, you know,

310
00:12:33,064 --> 00:12:35,824
the tortillas were made and heated.

311
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:37,264
They'd be cooled.

312
00:12:37,344 --> 00:12:38,804
And the best part of the tour,

313
00:12:38,944 --> 00:12:41,364
you'd be given a freshly made tortilla

314
00:12:41,364 --> 00:12:42,824
for you to enjoy.

315
00:12:43,244 --> 00:12:44,944
Sometimes corn, sometimes flour.

316
00:12:45,664 --> 00:12:47,264
And then you could get on a scale

317
00:12:47,264 --> 00:12:49,904
that was you could weigh yourself

318
00:12:49,904 --> 00:12:51,944
to see how many tortillas you weighed.

319
00:12:53,124 --> 00:12:57,704
Which I went through an old laptop and an old hard drive.

320
00:12:57,744 --> 00:13:00,644
And I swore I had a picture of how many tortillas I weighed.

321
00:13:00,764 --> 00:13:02,044
I could not find it.

322
00:13:02,044 --> 00:13:02,744
Oh, man.

323
00:13:02,764 --> 00:13:03,544
Very disappointed.

324
00:13:03,584 --> 00:13:05,224
I don't know that I ever did that.

325
00:13:05,224 --> 00:13:07,084
I don't know if I ever weighed myself

326
00:13:07,084 --> 00:13:09,544
via using tortillas as a measurement.

327
00:13:09,964 --> 00:13:13,544
I mean, it was kind of the one of two things

328
00:13:13,544 --> 00:13:15,744
you could do in this tour.

329
00:13:16,164 --> 00:13:18,684
I went through this with you though, I'm sure, right?

330
00:13:18,904 --> 00:13:22,444
Or did we not go together until 2012 or 13?

331
00:13:22,504 --> 00:13:25,904
It might've been around 2012 we went, like the first.

332
00:13:25,944 --> 00:13:26,564
Yeah, maybe.

333
00:13:26,784 --> 00:13:29,204
We were going a lot when DCA first opened.

334
00:13:29,304 --> 00:13:31,704
We met in 2009, right?

335
00:13:31,884 --> 00:13:32,564
Or end of 2008.

336
00:13:33,704 --> 00:13:34,944
I think it was end of 2008, actually.

337
00:13:36,064 --> 00:13:40,864
You know, I will say getting that tortilla was nice.

338
00:13:40,864 --> 00:13:43,264
I make fun of the idea that it's a value,

339
00:13:43,344 --> 00:13:47,024
but it's Disneyland, you're being gouged on all levels.

340
00:13:47,444 --> 00:13:49,904
And I still, I went and got that bread yesterday

341
00:13:49,904 --> 00:13:51,344
just as a quick little snack.

342
00:13:51,444 --> 00:13:54,004
And I would like getting that tortilla.

343
00:13:54,484 --> 00:13:56,444
Some of the trouble, what's nice about the,

344
00:13:56,464 --> 00:13:58,144
they give you the bread right away now.

345
00:13:58,144 --> 00:13:59,184
You can just keep walking.

346
00:13:59,804 --> 00:14:01,664
The tortilla, you had to really think twice

347
00:14:01,664 --> 00:14:03,084
how badly you wanted that tortilla

348
00:14:04,024 --> 00:14:05,564
because they stopped you.

349
00:14:05,664 --> 00:14:07,784
You had to watch that kid video.

350
00:14:07,964 --> 00:14:10,324
Yeah, you could not push through those double doors.

351
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:12,164
They opened automatically.

352
00:14:12,644 --> 00:14:12,844
No.

353
00:14:13,964 --> 00:14:16,364
But that tortilla, pretty excellent.

354
00:14:17,084 --> 00:14:19,184
I'm gonna say I'm not really a fan

355
00:14:19,184 --> 00:14:22,484
of the Mission Tortilla brand necessarily,

356
00:14:22,484 --> 00:14:24,124
but I feel like the tortilla,

357
00:14:24,224 --> 00:14:26,804
the first tortilla they gave you was of higher quality

358
00:14:26,804 --> 00:14:29,344
than you'd get just in a bag at the store.

359
00:14:29,584 --> 00:14:30,524
And it was warm.

360
00:14:30,744 --> 00:14:32,644
And I did like getting that tortilla.

361
00:14:32,784 --> 00:14:34,264
I also read that you could,

362
00:14:34,884 --> 00:14:36,944
apparently I saw no proof of this,

363
00:14:36,984 --> 00:14:37,984
but at some site I found said,

364
00:14:38,184 --> 00:14:40,044
on your birthday receive a package

365
00:14:40,044 --> 00:14:42,124
of one dozen tortillas for free.

366
00:14:42,524 --> 00:14:42,904
Whoa.

367
00:14:43,144 --> 00:14:44,024
Now that's something.

368
00:14:44,024 --> 00:14:44,224
I didn't know that.

369
00:14:44,244 --> 00:14:46,384
And we'd be in there on all of our birthdays

370
00:14:46,384 --> 00:14:47,884
where that's still going.

371
00:14:47,964 --> 00:14:49,664
Does that hold for the sourdough?

372
00:14:49,824 --> 00:14:53,384
If you tell this, will they give you a loaf of sourdough?

373
00:14:53,444 --> 00:14:54,184
I mean, probably not.

374
00:14:54,184 --> 00:14:56,224
Because I'll tell you this, I love sourdough bread.

375
00:14:56,524 --> 00:14:58,724
There's no way you haven't walked in there though

376
00:14:58,724 --> 00:14:59,684
with the birthday button.

377
00:15:00,184 --> 00:15:02,204
So they would have hopefully given you a whole loaf.

378
00:15:02,324 --> 00:15:03,544
Yeah, you're right.

379
00:15:03,784 --> 00:15:06,504
I mean, maybe you could ask next year.

380
00:15:06,664 --> 00:15:09,544
Will they give me like an extra piece of that mother dough

381
00:15:09,544 --> 00:15:11,444
so I can start my own factory?

382
00:15:11,964 --> 00:15:13,544
Well, the mother dough is very valuable.

383
00:15:13,824 --> 00:15:15,504
Let's say that for the sourdough.

384
00:15:15,504 --> 00:15:16,304
That's a break in.

385
00:15:16,444 --> 00:15:18,584
You're in oceans 11 territory

386
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:20,164
if you wanna get some of that mother dough.

387
00:15:21,764 --> 00:15:23,644
There was also in the factory area,

388
00:15:23,664 --> 00:15:25,344
there was a demonstration kitchen

389
00:15:25,344 --> 00:15:27,764
where they would show you the many varied ways

390
00:15:27,764 --> 00:15:30,184
you could use mission tortillas.

391
00:15:30,184 --> 00:15:32,124
You could make little ham and cheese wraps.

392
00:15:32,124 --> 00:15:33,884
You could even use them in desserts.

393
00:15:33,884 --> 00:15:36,304
That's insanity.

394
00:15:37,264 --> 00:15:39,524
Who has ever used a mission tortilla

395
00:15:39,524 --> 00:15:42,264
with like strawberries and...

396
00:15:42,264 --> 00:15:43,564
Jason, have you?

397
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:44,924
I don't think I ever.

398
00:15:45,124 --> 00:15:50,144
I think, well, we've gone to like Acapulco or like El Tori

399
00:15:50,144 --> 00:15:52,984
and they have like dessert nachos or whatever

400
00:15:52,984 --> 00:15:55,484
that are just kind of like tortillas that are fried

401
00:15:55,484 --> 00:15:56,944
and then covered in cinnamon sugar.

402
00:15:58,124 --> 00:15:59,564
So that's technically a tortilla.

403
00:15:59,564 --> 00:16:00,984
I've never made it at home.

404
00:16:01,004 --> 00:16:03,124
I've never made dessert tortillas, no.

405
00:16:04,144 --> 00:16:05,704
We finally found.

406
00:16:05,844 --> 00:16:07,424
With my hot dogs and Nutella.

407
00:16:07,964 --> 00:16:09,784
Have you ever put a hot dog in a tortilla?

408
00:16:10,724 --> 00:16:11,504
Oh.

409
00:16:11,604 --> 00:16:12,844
And isn't that not a bad idea

410
00:16:12,844 --> 00:16:13,844
now that I say it out loud?

411
00:16:13,924 --> 00:16:18,544
That is a popular, the Oakey dog on Fairfax.

412
00:16:18,724 --> 00:16:20,024
I mean, really it's actually very,

413
00:16:20,364 --> 00:16:23,904
it's probably a little less caloric than a hot dog bun.

414
00:16:23,964 --> 00:16:25,024
I just don't think they mix.

415
00:16:25,404 --> 00:16:27,764
I think they do flour, not corn.

416
00:16:27,764 --> 00:16:31,104
I think a lot of like the LA burger stands

417
00:16:31,104 --> 00:16:33,744
do some sort of pastrami burrito

418
00:16:33,744 --> 00:16:36,724
or hot dog pastrami wrap sort of thing.

419
00:16:37,184 --> 00:16:40,384
So when you're, instead of wrapping it in a paper towel

420
00:16:40,384 --> 00:16:42,484
on your way out, you wrap it in a burrito.

421
00:16:42,504 --> 00:16:44,884
Oh my God, you're saying I could, yeah,

422
00:16:44,924 --> 00:16:47,604
that would steam the both of them.

423
00:16:48,444 --> 00:16:50,424
I mean, you can hear how he lit up when he said that,

424
00:16:50,664 --> 00:16:53,824
but his legs shot out and extended from the couch.

425
00:16:53,864 --> 00:16:54,684
He was so excited.

426
00:16:54,824 --> 00:16:56,484
But I think it's a, yeah, I think you should do that.

427
00:16:56,484 --> 00:16:59,384
Well, the next time we're gonna see you walk into a record

428
00:16:59,384 --> 00:17:03,604
with the finishing up a dessert hot dog taco.

429
00:17:03,804 --> 00:17:07,384
Well, let's not be ridiculous.

430
00:17:07,504 --> 00:17:09,364
You wouldn't make match dessert with it.

431
00:17:09,364 --> 00:17:11,564
You would have a second dessert dog.

432
00:17:11,764 --> 00:17:14,804
But I think if we accustom you to hot dog tacos,

433
00:17:15,124 --> 00:17:18,044
step one, then step two, it's only one,

434
00:17:18,264 --> 00:17:19,224
it's a slippery slope.

435
00:17:19,444 --> 00:17:21,484
Then you're doing, it's how long before you're doing

436
00:17:21,484 --> 00:17:22,464
dessert hot dog tacos.

437
00:17:22,904 --> 00:17:25,544
What, I mean, do you know the Oakey dog?

438
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:27,024
Like down by Fairfax?

439
00:17:27,204 --> 00:17:28,764
I am not familiar with the Oakey dog.

440
00:17:28,764 --> 00:17:31,144
It's like two hot dogs and pastrami and tortilla.

441
00:17:31,644 --> 00:17:32,304
Oakey dog.

442
00:17:32,884 --> 00:17:33,664
Okay, I.

443
00:17:33,964 --> 00:17:34,624
Okay, I.

444
00:17:34,624 --> 00:17:35,844
I think it's a fusion thing.

445
00:17:35,944 --> 00:17:37,164
I mean, pastrami burritos.

446
00:17:37,164 --> 00:17:38,044
Oh, I see, I see.

447
00:17:38,244 --> 00:17:42,184
I think, I mean, this is the thing Jonathan Gold wrote about

448
00:17:42,184 --> 00:17:44,344
and then past guest Molly Lambert and her,

449
00:17:44,664 --> 00:17:47,424
she wrote an article about knowing him,

450
00:17:47,624 --> 00:17:50,684
wrote about like the pastrami burrito in Los Angeles

451
00:17:50,684 --> 00:17:52,824
came from like Jewish immigrants

452
00:17:54,124 --> 00:17:56,744
and Mexican immigrants living, you know,

453
00:17:56,844 --> 00:18:00,004
in neighborhoods next to each other in downtown LA.

454
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:00,664
That's fun.

455
00:18:00,844 --> 00:18:04,204
I'd like to show Scott a picture and see if he throws up

456
00:18:04,204 --> 00:18:05,424
a picture of the Oakey dog.

457
00:18:06,284 --> 00:18:07,604
This is the Oakey dog.

458
00:18:07,604 --> 00:18:08,604
Yeah, I.

459
00:18:08,704 --> 00:18:11,264
Pastrami and four, well, like two hot dogs.

460
00:18:11,264 --> 00:18:12,964
Two hot dogs and a half cheese.

461
00:18:13,664 --> 00:18:15,524
No, no, no, no to this, no.

462
00:18:15,564 --> 00:18:18,424
It is a soak up the booze the next day kind of food.

463
00:18:18,424 --> 00:18:19,644
It looks disgusting.

464
00:18:19,804 --> 00:18:21,104
That being said, I would try it

465
00:18:21,104 --> 00:18:22,624
and it is probably pretty good.

466
00:18:23,324 --> 00:18:26,164
I'm not gonna act like I ain't gonna try it,

467
00:18:26,164 --> 00:18:27,944
but I'm just saying that like it is,

468
00:18:27,944 --> 00:18:29,864
it is pretty unsettling looking.

469
00:18:30,324 --> 00:18:33,364
I think that stand in, there's a stand in Burbank.

470
00:18:33,924 --> 00:18:34,584
That tells us.

471
00:18:34,904 --> 00:18:38,644
I think they do like shimmy changas with hot dog inside.

472
00:18:39,044 --> 00:18:39,364
Oh, like Deadpool.

473
00:18:39,824 --> 00:18:40,744
Yeah, like Deadpool knows.

474
00:18:41,244 --> 00:18:45,824
So I mean, in form and function,

475
00:18:46,284 --> 00:18:49,624
that kind of brings us to the end of the tortilla factory

476
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:55,504
and the free tortillas were definitely the highlight.

477
00:18:55,584 --> 00:18:56,824
I think that's what people liked.

478
00:18:57,164 --> 00:19:01,064
I thought it was interesting learning how tortillas are made

479
00:19:01,064 --> 00:19:02,124
because I didn't really know.

480
00:19:02,744 --> 00:19:04,864
And going into the research of the episode,

481
00:19:05,064 --> 00:19:07,324
I was all prepared to make a joke that like,

482
00:19:07,564 --> 00:19:09,644
oh, the tortilla factory got gentrified

483
00:19:09,644 --> 00:19:11,424
by this bougie ice cream parlor,

484
00:19:11,564 --> 00:19:13,864
the Girodeli ice cream parlor moved in.

485
00:19:15,224 --> 00:19:17,724
And I looked up the estimated annual revenue

486
00:19:17,724 --> 00:19:20,504
of Mission Foods is about 10.8 million.

487
00:19:20,844 --> 00:19:23,264
And then I looked up Girodeli chocolates,

488
00:19:23,264 --> 00:19:26,864
which pulls in about 170 million.

489
00:19:27,484 --> 00:19:31,204
So that in theory is right

490
00:19:31,204 --> 00:19:33,284
that this bigger company moved in,

491
00:19:33,344 --> 00:19:36,864
although Disney had been trying to get Girodeli

492
00:19:36,864 --> 00:19:41,084
into California Adventure back in the early days

493
00:19:41,084 --> 00:19:42,924
and they saw what the park was gonna be

494
00:19:42,924 --> 00:19:44,584
and they were not into it.

495
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:45,004
Like they were not impressed.

496
00:19:45,004 --> 00:19:45,944
No kidding, really?

497
00:19:45,944 --> 00:19:48,244
So they were holding out.

498
00:19:49,784 --> 00:19:54,304
The story about Girodeli moving in was broken

499
00:19:54,304 --> 00:19:56,104
by Mice Age writer Al Lutz,

500
00:19:56,124 --> 00:19:58,824
who I don't think we've really talked much about.

501
00:19:58,904 --> 00:20:00,664
He was another rumor.

502
00:20:00,884 --> 00:20:04,544
Blogger we probably all read in middle school and such.

503
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:05,924
A lot of Disneyland insider.

504
00:20:06,944 --> 00:20:08,064
He got the, no pun intended,

505
00:20:08,224 --> 00:20:11,324
he got the scoop on the ice cream parlor.

506
00:20:11,324 --> 00:20:12,264
You intended that.

507
00:20:12,264 --> 00:20:14,084
I intended it.

508
00:20:14,664 --> 00:20:18,024
That they were gonna move in and then it did happen

509
00:20:18,024 --> 00:20:20,844
and that opened in 2012

510
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:24,644
with sort of the re-imagining of California Adventure.

511
00:20:25,184 --> 00:20:26,784
This is the kind of scoops that you're gonna have to get

512
00:20:26,784 --> 00:20:27,984
as a cub reporter now

513
00:20:27,984 --> 00:20:30,664
is when an ice cream company moves into a theme park.

514
00:20:30,684 --> 00:20:32,464
This is this type of stuff that is your beat

515
00:20:32,464 --> 00:20:33,624
as far as I'm concerned.

516
00:20:34,324 --> 00:20:35,644
So you're gonna have to keep your ear to the ground.

517
00:20:36,404 --> 00:20:37,364
Speaking of scoops.

518
00:20:37,384 --> 00:20:41,204
So I told you guys as I was researching that like,

519
00:20:41,204 --> 00:20:42,504
I found a twist.

520
00:20:42,504 --> 00:20:42,984
Oh boy.

521
00:20:43,504 --> 00:20:47,004
Which I started reading about the,

522
00:20:47,284 --> 00:20:48,744
cause I was like, oh Mission Food,

523
00:20:48,904 --> 00:20:50,424
who is their parent company?

524
00:20:51,184 --> 00:20:52,464
Who owns them now?

525
00:20:52,544 --> 00:20:53,964
Cause no company is,

526
00:20:54,304 --> 00:20:56,424
everything is owned by something else now.

527
00:20:56,504 --> 00:21:00,424
And I found out that my joke about gentrification

528
00:21:00,424 --> 00:21:02,924
is only kind of half right

529
00:21:02,924 --> 00:21:07,584
because Mission Foods is a subsidiary

530
00:21:07,584 --> 00:21:09,404
of a company called Gruma.

531
00:21:10,064 --> 00:21:12,384
Gruma is a Mexican company

532
00:21:12,384 --> 00:21:15,344
that makes tortillas and corn flour.

533
00:21:17,024 --> 00:21:22,324
And Gruma's estimated annual revenue is $3.6 billion.

534
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:28,524
And in fact, this company was the ones who,

535
00:21:28,524 --> 00:21:35,144
they popularized the use of corn flour to make tortillas.

536
00:21:36,544 --> 00:21:39,484
And before this, the traditional way to make tortillas

537
00:21:39,484 --> 00:21:43,844
is that you boil hominy, which is corn,

538
00:21:43,904 --> 00:21:46,124
but not the kind of sweet corn on the cob

539
00:21:46,124 --> 00:21:47,704
that we eat as a side dish.

540
00:21:48,464 --> 00:21:51,044
It's closer to like, almost the way you cook,

541
00:21:51,044 --> 00:21:53,064
like raw hard beans.

542
00:21:53,364 --> 00:21:57,044
So you boil hominy and then you form it into masa,

543
00:21:57,264 --> 00:21:58,324
which is corn dough.

544
00:21:58,604 --> 00:22:01,204
And then you make tortillas out of that

545
00:22:01,204 --> 00:22:03,664
on a hot grill or a griddle.

546
00:22:03,964 --> 00:22:08,244
And apparently much more flavorful and sweeter and stuff.

547
00:22:08,244 --> 00:22:13,384
And this is how most of the Mexican population,

548
00:22:13,424 --> 00:22:15,304
they would go to their local tortilla place

549
00:22:15,304 --> 00:22:18,264
and corn was subsidized by the government

550
00:22:18,264 --> 00:22:24,704
until the Gruma people started pushing corn flour

551
00:22:24,704 --> 00:22:27,824
as a cheaper alternative.

552
00:22:28,084 --> 00:22:31,884
And the mass production of tortillas shifted away

553
00:22:31,884 --> 00:22:35,564
from like small places, like shifted away

554
00:22:37,284 --> 00:22:40,064
from like masa dough, like handmade

555
00:22:40,064 --> 00:22:43,864
to like industrial corn flour making tortillas.

556
00:22:44,604 --> 00:22:49,004
Similar to the way bakeries, like the way we buy bread,

557
00:22:49,144 --> 00:22:51,344
we buy bread in grocery stores in America,

558
00:22:51,564 --> 00:22:53,144
loaded with preservatives that are good

559
00:22:53,144 --> 00:22:54,884
for like two, three weeks at a time,

560
00:22:55,124 --> 00:22:57,764
as opposed to going to your local bakery every day

561
00:22:57,764 --> 00:22:59,744
or every other day for fresh bread.

562
00:23:01,484 --> 00:23:05,324
And then Gruma got involved with like some very,

563
00:23:05,324 --> 00:23:07,584
like weird political dealings,

564
00:23:07,964 --> 00:23:11,544
pretty much got the government to subsidize them

565
00:23:11,544 --> 00:23:12,964
and their expansion.

566
00:23:14,304 --> 00:23:19,564
So, yeah, so they were the ones who like invented

567
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:22,204
the Maseca corn flour brand

568
00:23:22,204 --> 00:23:28,504
and kind of made a less flavorful tortilla for everyone.

569
00:23:28,764 --> 00:23:31,984
So the standard, the base of what I just said earlier

570
00:23:31,984 --> 00:23:34,804
about I think those mission tortillas are a little bland.

571
00:23:35,644 --> 00:23:39,364
That's partially due to the like general watering down

572
00:23:39,364 --> 00:23:43,544
of the concept of a tortilla by this Gruma company.

573
00:23:43,604 --> 00:23:45,004
You are 100% accurate.

574
00:23:45,144 --> 00:23:46,644
Who is the CEO of Gruma?

575
00:23:48,704 --> 00:23:50,564
Well, he seemed like a weird, I forgot his name,

576
00:23:50,664 --> 00:23:52,384
but he seemed like a weird guy.

577
00:23:53,124 --> 00:23:55,104
They also involved in this, there was,

578
00:23:55,184 --> 00:23:58,444
Mexico had their own sort of presidential crisis

579
00:23:58,444 --> 00:24:01,084
where the Supreme Court awarded it

580
00:24:02,364 --> 00:24:07,584
to the guy who like maybe won, but just barely in 2006,

581
00:24:07,744 --> 00:24:13,564
very similar to America's like 2000 Supreme Court crisis.

582
00:24:13,604 --> 00:24:16,204
And that guy was tight with the Gruma people.

583
00:24:17,284 --> 00:24:20,684
So I have a quote here.

584
00:24:22,384 --> 00:24:25,904
Let's see, Gruma, I found out there's a independent media

585
00:24:25,904 --> 00:24:29,104
website called gris.org and they wrote a long article

586
00:24:30,104 --> 00:24:32,084
about this insane transition away

587
00:24:32,084 --> 00:24:34,004
from like traditional tortilla methods

588
00:24:34,004 --> 00:24:39,064
to this factory tortilla manufacturing.

589
00:24:40,024 --> 00:24:42,724
Are they also by the way secretly made of people?

590
00:24:43,444 --> 00:24:45,844
No, thankfully they seem not to be made of people.

591
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:47,764
Low quality corn flour.

592
00:24:48,784 --> 00:24:51,664
Okay, the twist was, you said the twist already, right?

593
00:24:51,764 --> 00:24:52,624
Or is there more twist?

594
00:24:52,764 --> 00:24:54,964
No, it's just that it's this massive conspiracy

595
00:24:54,964 --> 00:24:56,484
of like shitty tortillas.

596
00:24:56,484 --> 00:24:58,824
Okay, and they were being indoctrinated

597
00:24:58,824 --> 00:25:02,204
through this factory tour into liking the crappy way.

598
00:25:02,724 --> 00:25:07,924
As of this article in 2006, Gruma now controls 70%

599
00:25:07,924 --> 00:25:09,944
of Mexico's corn flour market.

600
00:25:10,044 --> 00:25:15,524
And similar to America, the shift to more preservative-laden

601
00:25:15,524 --> 00:25:20,104
or preserved stuff has led to obesity issues in Mexico,

602
00:25:20,824 --> 00:25:24,284
rising costs of tortillas, which led some people

603
00:25:24,284 --> 00:25:27,584
to switch to white bread, which Gruma also has

604
00:25:27,584 --> 00:25:30,004
a massive business interest in.

605
00:25:30,204 --> 00:25:32,764
So when you said twist, I mean, I honestly,

606
00:25:33,064 --> 00:25:36,444
and maybe I didn't mean to sell you short in my brain,

607
00:25:36,464 --> 00:25:39,464
but I was like, oh, this twist is gonna be one time

608
00:25:39,464 --> 00:25:44,424
like Imagineer Mark Davis ate a mission tortilla or something.

609
00:25:44,424 --> 00:25:46,044
I thought the twist was gonna be something like that.

610
00:25:46,484 --> 00:25:49,684
You have actually done some cub reporting here.

611
00:25:49,744 --> 00:25:51,624
You've done some investigative journalism.

612
00:25:51,624 --> 00:25:52,784
Price fixing.

613
00:25:52,784 --> 00:25:55,684
This is a real legit thing.

614
00:25:56,004 --> 00:25:57,444
Supply fixing here from this Grist article.

615
00:25:57,804 --> 00:26:01,524
Maseca began offering to sell small tortilla makers

616
00:26:01,524 --> 00:26:03,704
equipment to switch from masa-based production

617
00:26:03,704 --> 00:26:05,024
to flour-based production.

618
00:26:05,284 --> 00:26:07,624
And the government provided extra incentive.

619
00:26:09,504 --> 00:26:12,944
These tortilla makers who refused to buy Maseca's equipment

620
00:26:12,944 --> 00:26:14,824
were punished by the government,

621
00:26:15,084 --> 00:26:18,104
which set them the worst corn and strictly limited

622
00:26:18,104 --> 00:26:20,284
the amount of grain the shops received.

623
00:26:20,284 --> 00:26:22,764
Hundreds of shops went out of business.

624
00:26:23,724 --> 00:26:28,424
And meanwhile, like in this walkthrough tour,

625
00:26:28,884 --> 00:26:33,944
the pre-show video has the dog saying Maseca

626
00:26:33,944 --> 00:26:38,624
mixed in right with like the stories about like,

627
00:26:38,624 --> 00:26:42,364
the Mayans and the ancient people of Mexico,

628
00:26:42,484 --> 00:26:43,864
how they made tortillas.

629
00:26:44,004 --> 00:26:47,644
So they're putting their industrial corporate product

630
00:26:47,724 --> 00:26:50,444
mixing it in to like the story.

631
00:26:50,664 --> 00:26:55,364
As if it's central to what tortillas are, but it was not.

632
00:26:55,364 --> 00:26:56,464
Got it.

633
00:26:56,724 --> 00:26:58,244
That's pretty screwed up.

634
00:26:58,324 --> 00:27:00,364
It was the Mayans and then it was Maseca

635
00:27:00,364 --> 00:27:01,504
and here we are today.

636
00:27:01,664 --> 00:27:02,664
Not true.

637
00:27:02,844 --> 00:27:04,764
There wasn't Maseca.

638
00:27:04,984 --> 00:27:05,484
Whoa.

639
00:27:05,484 --> 00:27:05,984
Jeez.

640
00:27:06,544 --> 00:27:09,764
And then of course, a lot of that corn flour made by cheap

641
00:27:09,764 --> 00:27:11,884
imported corn from America.

642
00:27:12,204 --> 00:27:15,024
Cause we got corn coming out the eyes in America.

643
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:16,104
Yeah.

644
00:27:16,344 --> 00:27:19,884
But yeah, very similar to like American shifting

645
00:27:19,884 --> 00:27:21,704
to like preservatives, latent breads,

646
00:27:21,884 --> 00:27:22,924
except for Trader Joe's.

647
00:27:23,364 --> 00:27:25,204
You gotta freeze that bread or use it real quick.

648
00:27:25,324 --> 00:27:26,124
Not a lot of preservatives.

649
00:27:26,124 --> 00:27:26,604
You do, but it's better.

650
00:27:26,664 --> 00:27:30,244
And I do freeze those tortillas and they hold for a while

651
00:27:30,244 --> 00:27:32,564
and they're excellent and they're easy to heat back up.

652
00:27:32,824 --> 00:27:35,944
And I assume there's less nefarious stuff going on

653
00:27:35,944 --> 00:27:37,964
cause I think Trader Joe's is a cool company.

654
00:27:38,344 --> 00:27:43,504
So wow, by trying to bribe us with free tortillas.

655
00:27:44,324 --> 00:27:47,884
So meanwhile, also Mission Foods is currently

656
00:27:47,884 --> 00:27:51,484
and for a while has been headquartered in Texas,

657
00:27:51,544 --> 00:27:52,644
not California.

658
00:27:52,724 --> 00:27:54,124
So kind of weird.

659
00:27:54,604 --> 00:27:56,924
Real Californian craftsman work.

660
00:27:57,124 --> 00:27:59,784
Jear Deli was founded in California

661
00:27:59,784 --> 00:28:02,484
and is like goes back to the 1800s,

662
00:28:02,484 --> 00:28:05,264
of course located in San Francisco.

663
00:28:05,784 --> 00:28:06,564
Associated with San Francisco.

664
00:28:06,644 --> 00:28:07,584
Makes a lot more sense.

665
00:28:07,584 --> 00:28:10,344
And that's kind of a Bay area of the park.

666
00:28:10,844 --> 00:28:12,244
So it's right in.

667
00:28:12,244 --> 00:28:13,004
Yeah, it's better.

668
00:28:13,004 --> 00:28:15,104
This was certainly a trade up

669
00:28:15,104 --> 00:28:19,384
and you still get the free square when you go in.

670
00:28:19,664 --> 00:28:22,484
When a free piece of chocolate is superior to a free.

671
00:28:22,484 --> 00:28:23,444
A free piece of chocolate is a trade up.

672
00:28:23,664 --> 00:28:26,184
As a big time treat boy, I look forward to that chocolate.

673
00:28:26,304 --> 00:28:26,784
Absolutely.

674
00:28:26,864 --> 00:28:28,064
Before the end of this twist,

675
00:28:28,144 --> 00:28:30,384
let's do round two of tortilla toss up.

676
00:28:30,564 --> 00:28:32,464
A taco, burrito or quesadilla.

677
00:28:32,664 --> 00:28:33,644
Which do you all prefer?

678
00:28:34,744 --> 00:28:36,644
I'm a quesadilla man.

679
00:28:36,704 --> 00:28:37,984
I don't know what it is about it.

680
00:28:38,124 --> 00:28:39,784
I just, I mean, I like I'll eat a burrito,

681
00:28:39,804 --> 00:28:42,164
I'll eat a taco, but I like a quesadilla.

682
00:28:42,164 --> 00:28:42,884
Yeah, I don't know why.

683
00:28:42,884 --> 00:28:43,144
Scott?

684
00:28:43,264 --> 00:28:46,504
I would be burritos if I wasn't more health conscious,

685
00:28:46,504 --> 00:28:50,444
but I end up having tacos a lot of the time.

686
00:28:50,624 --> 00:28:53,684
So I'll say taco, but if I were really indulging,

687
00:28:53,784 --> 00:28:54,524
it'd be more burrito.

688
00:28:54,744 --> 00:28:56,544
Yeah, I'm a bit more indulgent.

689
00:28:56,564 --> 00:28:57,604
So I'll go with burrito.

690
00:28:57,904 --> 00:28:59,584
All right, that was round two of tortilla toss up.

691
00:28:59,624 --> 00:29:00,404
Oh, what a blast.

692
00:29:00,484 --> 00:29:02,544
To bring our twist to a conclusion,

693
00:29:02,984 --> 00:29:05,304
Ghirardelli, of course, while more associated

694
00:29:05,304 --> 00:29:06,804
with Northern California,

695
00:29:08,284 --> 00:29:11,904
was sold to Lint and Sprungly Chocolatiers,

696
00:29:12,184 --> 00:29:14,564
the European company in 1998.

697
00:29:14,924 --> 00:29:19,584
Their estimated annual revenue is 4.2 billion.

698
00:29:20,984 --> 00:29:23,204
So kind of an even trade.

699
00:29:23,364 --> 00:29:26,304
And of course, like most chocolatiers,

700
00:29:26,644 --> 00:29:29,564
caught up in controversy about sourcing their cocoa.

701
00:29:30,584 --> 00:29:32,784
I think that what I read was that,

702
00:29:34,244 --> 00:29:35,344
not as bad as Nestle.

703
00:29:35,344 --> 00:29:38,024
I mean, Nestle is a pretty vile company.

704
00:29:39,124 --> 00:29:39,304
The heinous company.

705
00:29:39,304 --> 00:29:40,784
Who Disney worked with, obviously.

706
00:29:41,664 --> 00:29:43,644
Yeah, Disney worked with for a long time,

707
00:29:43,644 --> 00:29:45,704
but I forget, I think it was Ghirardelli,

708
00:29:46,324 --> 00:29:48,024
or Lint was caught up.

709
00:29:48,244 --> 00:29:50,344
And it turns out a lot of that cocoa was being grown

710
00:29:50,344 --> 00:29:53,844
in national parks or preserves within Africa.

711
00:29:54,264 --> 00:29:54,784
Jesus.

712
00:29:55,084 --> 00:29:56,304
So this-

713
00:29:56,304 --> 00:29:58,284
It's almost like Disney does business

714
00:29:58,284 --> 00:30:00,564
with some not so savory companies.

715
00:30:00,964 --> 00:30:04,684
It's like, I learned, maybe it was a couple of years ago,

716
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:08,504
that like cereals, when we were kids,

717
00:30:08,564 --> 00:30:11,564
cereal, they used more like real grains.

718
00:30:12,404 --> 00:30:13,584
And then everything switched over

719
00:30:13,584 --> 00:30:15,204
to high fructose corn syrup.

720
00:30:15,404 --> 00:30:18,584
So it's a tradition in all these terrible companies

721
00:30:18,584 --> 00:30:21,664
to eventually switch ingredients

722
00:30:21,664 --> 00:30:24,704
to something that's cheaper and probably worse for you.

723
00:30:24,904 --> 00:30:26,424
And then it also affects the taste too,

724
00:30:26,464 --> 00:30:29,084
because I remember, this is how I had the conversation.

725
00:30:29,204 --> 00:30:32,704
I remember talking to somebody who's way into cereal,

726
00:30:33,044 --> 00:30:34,244
believe it or not, more than me.

727
00:30:34,244 --> 00:30:36,304
Into cereal with characters on it.

728
00:30:36,704 --> 00:30:38,384
And he was like, yeah, that's because,

729
00:30:38,804 --> 00:30:40,524
I don't know how many years ago,

730
00:30:41,204 --> 00:30:44,704
tricks switched over from whole grains

731
00:30:44,704 --> 00:30:46,644
to just corn syrup and corn.

732
00:30:47,024 --> 00:30:50,264
And I was like, I had a memory flashback

733
00:30:50,264 --> 00:30:53,444
to tricks rebranded and they're like new shapes.

734
00:30:53,464 --> 00:30:55,284
And I remember eating the tricks and going,

735
00:30:56,004 --> 00:30:57,344
it's something different about it.

736
00:30:57,344 --> 00:30:59,924
It was still okay, but I remember the switch.

737
00:31:00,284 --> 00:31:01,684
I remember that happening.

738
00:31:02,084 --> 00:31:04,664
And this has happened so much

739
00:31:04,664 --> 00:31:06,504
in these different companies.

740
00:31:06,524 --> 00:31:08,984
Of course there's the new Coke conspiracy

741
00:31:08,984 --> 00:31:11,004
that the entire new Coke debacle

742
00:31:11,004 --> 00:31:14,104
was this weird flashy way to distract people

743
00:31:14,104 --> 00:31:15,624
from that we're changing the formula.

744
00:31:16,324 --> 00:31:17,864
I feel a lot of these in my,

745
00:31:18,024 --> 00:31:20,224
I can't tell how much of it is I was a kid

746
00:31:20,224 --> 00:31:22,584
or did these things actually change?

747
00:31:22,644 --> 00:31:28,064
I certainly recall KFC being of higher quality as a child.

748
00:31:28,124 --> 00:31:28,424
Sure.

749
00:31:28,444 --> 00:31:30,404
I mean, they've definitely gone downhill over the years.

750
00:31:30,404 --> 00:31:33,604
Yeah, and I'm sure a lot of companies have,

751
00:31:34,624 --> 00:31:35,704
but that's how they get,

752
00:31:35,704 --> 00:31:37,984
this is like this weird gaslighting of like,

753
00:31:38,224 --> 00:31:39,644
you were a kid, you didn't know,

754
00:31:39,884 --> 00:31:41,924
but was that, maybe it did get worse.

755
00:31:42,124 --> 00:31:45,424
But then there's also like consuming stuff

756
00:31:45,424 --> 00:31:47,364
to the point of, do you guys know the story

757
00:31:47,364 --> 00:31:49,624
about bananas and banana extract?

758
00:31:50,364 --> 00:31:52,684
Oh, that the flavor, the candy flavor

759
00:31:52,684 --> 00:31:54,444
is what bananas used to be like.

760
00:31:54,444 --> 00:31:58,244
Yes, but that strain of banana doesn't exist anymore.

761
00:31:58,244 --> 00:32:00,664
So banana flavored stuff tastes like bananas

762
00:32:00,664 --> 00:32:02,344
you can never actually taste.

763
00:32:02,504 --> 00:32:03,964
Wow, I actually didn't know that.

764
00:32:04,184 --> 00:32:08,144
So like banana runs are more what bananas taste like

765
00:32:08,144 --> 00:32:11,364
than an actual banana, like original banana, classic bananas.

766
00:32:11,384 --> 00:32:13,164
People associated with bananas back in the day.

767
00:32:13,164 --> 00:32:13,364
Really?

768
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:14,684
Wow, I didn't know that.

769
00:32:14,984 --> 00:32:16,844
So, why that odd flavor

770
00:32:16,844 --> 00:32:19,404
that doesn't really seem like anything we know.

771
00:32:19,544 --> 00:32:20,424
Cause it seems like artificial

772
00:32:20,424 --> 00:32:23,304
or like you would have it in like a fruit drink

773
00:32:23,304 --> 00:32:25,644
of some kind, alcoholic drink, you would get it,

774
00:32:25,764 --> 00:32:27,624
you know, Trader Sam's or something.

775
00:32:27,624 --> 00:32:31,464
And it's like a very aggressive kind of banana-y taste.

776
00:32:31,564 --> 00:32:33,344
I mean, there's probably pineapple in there too, but.

777
00:32:33,864 --> 00:32:34,204
Huh, huh.

778
00:32:34,544 --> 00:32:39,604
Well, nefarious stuff that is not explained

779
00:32:39,604 --> 00:32:41,284
by the little children.

780
00:32:41,304 --> 00:32:43,304
And then via a corporate merger,

781
00:32:43,544 --> 00:32:45,524
the formulas were changed

782
00:32:45,524 --> 00:32:48,164
and smaller companies were shaken down.

783
00:32:48,724 --> 00:32:52,184
Bad corn was sent out to farms to punish them.

784
00:32:52,364 --> 00:32:53,724
Yeah, that was the other thing.

785
00:32:53,764 --> 00:32:56,424
Mission Foods was founded in Los Angeles,

786
00:32:56,424 --> 00:33:02,924
but by Gruma as an attempt to break into selling tortillas

787
00:33:02,924 --> 00:33:05,524
to the American, the North American market.

788
00:33:05,904 --> 00:33:10,284
And now I think Gruma has like almost a worldwide

789
00:33:10,284 --> 00:33:14,404
like stranglehold on selling corn flour and tortillas.

790
00:33:14,864 --> 00:33:15,564
Man, oh man.

791
00:33:15,844 --> 00:33:17,844
And of course in the history of Disneyland,

792
00:33:18,184 --> 00:33:21,184
you have attractions sponsored by Monsanto

793
00:33:21,184 --> 00:33:23,304
and there's a lot of weirdo.

794
00:33:23,864 --> 00:33:26,564
And that's the general observation I wrote down

795
00:33:26,564 --> 00:33:30,084
about the tortilla factory is that, you know,

796
00:33:30,364 --> 00:33:32,684
I think there was this Eisner turn

797
00:33:32,684 --> 00:33:34,544
that happened slowly through his era.

798
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:36,064
And you know, he arrives in 84,

799
00:33:36,124 --> 00:33:38,004
as we've talked about very excitedly,

800
00:33:38,044 --> 00:33:41,524
brings his son Breck around and like do that roller coaster

801
00:33:41,524 --> 00:33:44,384
and that roller coaster and great rides and Pleasure Island

802
00:33:44,384 --> 00:33:47,104
and all these cool hotels and expansion of Disney

803
00:33:47,104 --> 00:33:50,444
where all this neat stuff happened in the early Eisner era.

804
00:33:50,444 --> 00:33:53,944
And then it starts to turn in this icky way.

805
00:33:54,204 --> 00:33:58,664
And this to me in general, we will go into

806
00:33:58,664 --> 00:34:00,904
in many other episodes, I'm sure the weird,

807
00:34:00,924 --> 00:34:03,984
the California Adventure was initially supposed

808
00:34:03,984 --> 00:34:06,184
to be this cheapo park.

809
00:34:06,604 --> 00:34:10,004
It was kind of like how little theme park contents

810
00:34:10,004 --> 00:34:13,364
can we put into our theme park without anyone noticing?

811
00:34:13,624 --> 00:34:15,324
Kind of like tortilla companies

812
00:34:15,324 --> 00:34:16,984
and real corn and real ingredients.

813
00:34:17,024 --> 00:34:21,344
I mean, they, a lot of people point to, you know,

814
00:34:21,344 --> 00:34:26,964
the three guys, Eisner, Frank Wells and Jeffrey Katzenberg

815
00:34:26,964 --> 00:34:29,664
as like, they saved Disney,

816
00:34:30,064 --> 00:34:32,484
but Frank Wells was the mediating force.

817
00:34:32,484 --> 00:34:37,484
And when he passed away, you just had these two bulls,

818
00:34:37,484 --> 00:34:40,344
you just had Eisner and Katzenberg just going at each other

819
00:34:40,344 --> 00:34:41,864
and eventually Katzenberg left

820
00:34:41,864 --> 00:34:44,424
and Eisner was just kind of left unchecked.

821
00:34:44,424 --> 00:34:46,204
And that's when stuff started to get weird.

822
00:34:46,204 --> 00:34:49,164
And then he could finally put a tortilla factory.

823
00:34:50,004 --> 00:34:50,144
A tortilla factory.

824
00:34:50,684 --> 00:34:51,344
Nefarious plan.

825
00:34:51,564 --> 00:34:54,104
But also there's the syndrome of Disney Paris

826
00:34:54,104 --> 00:34:55,804
didn't do so well, so he starts thinking,

827
00:34:55,924 --> 00:34:57,464
how can we expand these parks

828
00:34:57,464 --> 00:34:59,504
without necessarily doing these grand,

829
00:34:59,804 --> 00:35:01,964
multi-billion dollar masterpieces of theme parks?

830
00:35:02,144 --> 00:35:04,924
And it's things like this, it's things like the farm,

831
00:35:05,324 --> 00:35:07,084
it's things like the tortilla factory.

832
00:35:07,244 --> 00:35:08,664
He's like, will this work?

833
00:35:08,664 --> 00:35:11,324
And he puts it out there and it obviously does not.

834
00:35:11,524 --> 00:35:13,604
And it perfectly correlates with 9-11

835
00:35:13,604 --> 00:35:14,924
and a decay in tourism.

836
00:35:14,924 --> 00:35:17,204
It's this disaster for the company

837
00:35:17,204 --> 00:35:18,464
that they've had to reverse

838
00:35:18,464 --> 00:35:21,024
and now they've made California Adventure so great.

839
00:35:21,344 --> 00:35:23,284
But it also goes back to, I'm sure at some point,

840
00:35:23,284 --> 00:35:26,144
we have not done an episode about in Innoventions.

841
00:35:26,904 --> 00:35:29,604
Then Innoventions was really where Eisner's wheels

842
00:35:29,604 --> 00:35:34,484
start turning of, can we, can the selling of products,

843
00:35:34,544 --> 00:35:38,784
can we do it essentially an eternal trade show in the park

844
00:35:38,784 --> 00:35:40,744
and have that be an attraction?

845
00:35:40,924 --> 00:35:43,024
And it worked out a lot better for Innoventions

846
00:35:43,024 --> 00:35:46,424
and less well with these California Adventure things.

847
00:35:46,684 --> 00:35:49,464
Do you know who supervised Innoventions?

848
00:35:50,124 --> 00:35:52,224
An Imagineer named Barry Braverman.

849
00:35:52,504 --> 00:35:55,704
When the plans for Westcott were getting way out of control,

850
00:35:55,704 --> 00:35:57,664
Tony and his pie in the sky dreams,

851
00:35:58,064 --> 00:36:00,584
who takes over the second gate?

852
00:36:00,824 --> 00:36:03,984
Barry Braverman, mainly off of the strength of,

853
00:36:04,064 --> 00:36:06,124
well, he made this trade show attraction

854
00:36:06,124 --> 00:36:08,104
so much better than it should have been,

855
00:36:08,104 --> 00:36:09,684
what could he do with an entire park?

856
00:36:10,124 --> 00:36:12,044
Cut to the park's about to open.

857
00:36:12,524 --> 00:36:14,064
Here's a quote from Braverman.

858
00:36:14,064 --> 00:36:16,164
He's walking this reporter from area to area.

859
00:36:16,264 --> 00:36:18,524
They're going through the tortilla zone.

860
00:36:19,344 --> 00:36:21,644
Braverman said, this part of the Golden State area

861
00:36:21,644 --> 00:36:24,444
reflects Eisner's longtime fascination with the workplace

862
00:36:24,444 --> 00:36:25,664
and seeing how things are made.

863
00:36:26,044 --> 00:36:27,304
In fact, Braverman said,

864
00:36:27,324 --> 00:36:28,524
heading to the final portion of the tour,

865
00:36:28,824 --> 00:36:30,984
this whole farm area was his idea.

866
00:36:31,624 --> 00:36:34,764
So this to me feels like Braverman's like this henchman

867
00:36:34,764 --> 00:36:37,684
brought in to like, can you make corporate stuff be,

868
00:36:38,064 --> 00:36:39,564
seem like enough of a theme park?

869
00:36:39,784 --> 00:36:41,804
But he does not want it, even in the press,

870
00:36:41,804 --> 00:36:43,704
he's like, this is Eisner's idea.

871
00:36:43,844 --> 00:36:45,124
Yeah, he doesn't want to take credit.

872
00:36:45,384 --> 00:36:46,704
Yeah, rightfully so.

873
00:36:46,724 --> 00:36:48,304
The farm was the first thing to go.

874
00:36:48,424 --> 00:36:51,204
So I think this, I would imagine this will be a theme

875
00:36:51,204 --> 00:36:54,844
through further sea tickets is like weird corporate

876
00:36:54,844 --> 00:36:56,844
masquerading as an attraction.

877
00:36:57,204 --> 00:36:59,104
This was part of the parks in the early days.

878
00:36:59,244 --> 00:37:00,524
Walt is trying to get, I don't know,

879
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:01,764
some company put up something.

880
00:37:02,204 --> 00:37:04,844
And still, I mean, Splash Mountain is Ziploc bag,

881
00:37:05,044 --> 00:37:07,964
like central now, like you get a Ziploc bag

882
00:37:07,964 --> 00:37:08,944
on Splash Mountain.

883
00:37:09,624 --> 00:37:10,464
So there's still candy.

884
00:37:10,684 --> 00:37:11,784
Ziploc, it's branded.

885
00:37:12,104 --> 00:37:13,024
Isn't it Ziploc, right?

886
00:37:13,224 --> 00:37:14,024
Yeah, it's Ziploc.

887
00:37:14,564 --> 00:37:17,684
And they have a Splash Mountain logo on the Ziploc bag.

888
00:37:18,204 --> 00:37:18,884
Oh, interesting.

889
00:37:19,504 --> 00:37:22,204
Well, yeah, that's a little odd, but there's still a,

890
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:25,064
initially Indiana Jones is sponsored by AT&T,

891
00:37:25,244 --> 00:37:27,204
but there's a big difference between like,

892
00:37:27,244 --> 00:37:28,584
why don't you sponsor a cool ride?

893
00:37:28,664 --> 00:37:29,704
And why don't you make,

894
00:37:30,664 --> 00:37:33,004
why don't we just show your products for a while?

895
00:37:33,004 --> 00:37:36,444
And it's not dissimilar to my area of interest

896
00:37:36,444 --> 00:37:40,204
in like the weird decay of the funnier dices

897
00:37:40,204 --> 00:37:43,084
and the other and similar companies in like,

898
00:37:43,124 --> 00:37:44,764
what if companies sponsored fun videos?

899
00:37:44,844 --> 00:37:47,504
Or what if we just kind of made ads?

900
00:37:47,624 --> 00:37:49,184
Would the audience be able to tell?

901
00:37:49,444 --> 00:37:50,344
Yes, they can.

902
00:37:50,584 --> 00:37:52,124
It will hurt your company.

903
00:37:52,504 --> 00:37:55,384
It may plug a hole in the short term, but don't do it.

904
00:37:55,604 --> 00:37:57,664
This is, it's a syndrome we're seeing everywhere today.

905
00:37:57,664 --> 00:37:59,204
And you see with Eisner in this thing.

906
00:37:59,484 --> 00:38:00,704
I have two things.

907
00:38:00,784 --> 00:38:02,284
One, we're recording this the week.

908
00:38:02,324 --> 00:38:03,584
And before I came here today,

909
00:38:03,584 --> 00:38:05,604
I saw a bunch of pictures on Twitter.

910
00:38:07,764 --> 00:38:10,444
Citizen Watches is a sponsor of the parks now.

911
00:38:10,924 --> 00:38:13,764
And in Florida, yeah, I think it's in Florida.

912
00:38:15,324 --> 00:38:19,004
The clocks at the entrance of each time that tells you,

913
00:38:19,404 --> 00:38:20,864
it's 9.45.

914
00:38:21,024 --> 00:38:24,204
So people know like, oh yeah, my FastPass kicks in now.

915
00:38:24,744 --> 00:38:28,004
Those sort of like face clocks have all been changed

916
00:38:28,004 --> 00:38:30,044
to have the Citizen logo.

917
00:38:30,124 --> 00:38:32,504
I mean, they're all attraction appropriate clocks,

918
00:38:33,004 --> 00:38:36,184
but under behind the hands, you can see the Citizen.

919
00:38:36,184 --> 00:38:38,264
Like you would see on a watch face.

920
00:38:38,924 --> 00:38:43,024
The other thing is I think trade show to me seems,

921
00:38:43,244 --> 00:38:47,904
that seems so much more insidious than like museum exhibit.

922
00:38:48,744 --> 00:38:50,884
Jason Woolner told us about, and I subscribed to it.

923
00:38:50,884 --> 00:38:52,324
And I do like getting it every day.

924
00:38:52,524 --> 00:38:54,264
This, the website Blue Loop,

925
00:38:54,544 --> 00:38:57,964
which is a trade like themed entertainment

926
00:38:57,964 --> 00:39:01,464
and also museum companies.

927
00:39:02,404 --> 00:39:05,264
Like museums are getting real into like having

928
00:39:05,264 --> 00:39:07,364
a thematic element to exhibits

929
00:39:07,364 --> 00:39:09,704
as a way to sort of draw people in more.

930
00:39:10,104 --> 00:39:12,004
And that is very interesting to me,

931
00:39:12,924 --> 00:39:16,584
see in these daily and weekly newsletters,

932
00:39:17,324 --> 00:39:19,944
the, you know, museum articles about museums

933
00:39:19,944 --> 00:39:22,724
doing new exhibits or wings kind of intermixed

934
00:39:22,724 --> 00:39:25,184
with like theme park adding a roller coaster

935
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:27,004
or theme park adding a new dark ride.

936
00:39:27,244 --> 00:39:28,684
Oh, yeah, yeah, that's cool.

937
00:39:28,924 --> 00:39:31,284
That I think is, I think that's better.

938
00:39:31,444 --> 00:39:32,964
I think having the museum.

939
00:39:33,424 --> 00:39:36,164
Which in the best view of this thing could be

940
00:39:36,164 --> 00:39:37,664
that it's a tortilla museum.

941
00:39:38,064 --> 00:39:40,444
The nefarious thing is you're just walking through

942
00:39:40,444 --> 00:39:43,984
and nobody, if, you know, the bread factory is still there

943
00:39:43,984 --> 00:39:44,724
and it's fine.

944
00:39:45,104 --> 00:39:46,804
Nope, you wouldn't be mad about

945
00:39:46,804 --> 00:39:49,984
a Mission Tortilla sponsored thing if there were better,

946
00:39:50,024 --> 00:39:52,124
there was better stuff in the park next to it.

947
00:39:52,124 --> 00:39:52,864
And there wasn't.

948
00:39:53,204 --> 00:39:53,244
Right.

949
00:39:53,664 --> 00:39:56,904
I also think the bread factory does a better job.

950
00:39:56,904 --> 00:39:58,104
Like the history.

951
00:39:58,164 --> 00:40:00,224
Well, you can breeze through it easier to get that bread.

952
00:40:00,224 --> 00:40:00,804
Well, you can breeze through it,

953
00:40:00,844 --> 00:40:02,704
but I'm learning about sourdough bread,

954
00:40:02,704 --> 00:40:06,224
which like the starter dough and it goes back to the miners.

955
00:40:06,464 --> 00:40:08,784
Do you know how it's made from being in there?

956
00:40:09,044 --> 00:40:09,384
Sourdough bread?

957
00:40:09,524 --> 00:40:09,944
Yeah.

958
00:40:10,484 --> 00:40:12,384
I don't know, we don't wanna ruin that

959
00:40:12,384 --> 00:40:13,264
for the sourdough bread.

960
00:40:13,384 --> 00:40:13,844
I was just saying.

961
00:40:13,964 --> 00:40:15,024
I do know how, yeah.

962
00:40:15,284 --> 00:40:17,324
Cause I've never retained any of that information,

963
00:40:17,344 --> 00:40:20,224
much like no one's here has retained any foreign language.

964
00:40:20,304 --> 00:40:24,204
I've had friends like make sourdough bread and they,

965
00:40:24,564 --> 00:40:25,504
yeah, it's the same process.

966
00:40:26,124 --> 00:40:27,384
And they only, and their only knowledge

967
00:40:27,384 --> 00:40:29,444
was walking through the exhibit

968
00:40:29,444 --> 00:40:30,704
and not writing anything down.

969
00:40:30,704 --> 00:40:34,824
No, and they just churned out a perfect round dough shape,

970
00:40:35,144 --> 00:40:37,424
but they're always shaped like Mickey ears.

971
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:40,944
So sourdough factory clearly superior is what we've learned.

972
00:40:41,064 --> 00:40:43,344
I have one more observation, which is the bizarre fact

973
00:40:43,344 --> 00:40:45,984
that the demonstration kitchen that you mentioned,

974
00:40:46,284 --> 00:40:47,244
where they show you different,

975
00:40:47,284 --> 00:40:48,764
here's what you could use tortillas in.

976
00:40:49,004 --> 00:40:50,464
The fact that at the end of the demonstration,

977
00:40:50,524 --> 00:40:54,084
they do not give you that, nor is it available for purchase.

978
00:40:54,324 --> 00:40:56,324
And I was just imagining a little scene

979
00:40:56,324 --> 00:40:59,804
of like a guy concocting a dessert tortilla thing

980
00:40:59,804 --> 00:41:02,624
and then showing it to you and you going, okay.

981
00:41:02,904 --> 00:41:04,844
And then like putting your arms out and him saying,

982
00:41:05,124 --> 00:41:06,324
no, that's just for show.

983
00:41:06,364 --> 00:41:07,244
It's not to eat.

984
00:41:07,244 --> 00:41:09,284
And then you jumping over the counter,

985
00:41:10,044 --> 00:41:11,344
pushing his face into the tortilla.

986
00:41:11,344 --> 00:41:11,864
You son of a bitch.

987
00:41:11,984 --> 00:41:12,384
Exactly.

988
00:41:14,784 --> 00:41:18,384
Here's a thing that is more along our,

989
00:41:18,604 --> 00:41:21,024
less along the corporate conspiracy agles

990
00:41:21,024 --> 00:41:23,604
and more along the park logistics.

991
00:41:23,844 --> 00:41:26,904
Of course, right next to the tortilla factory

992
00:41:26,904 --> 00:41:29,224
is the food court with all these different stands.

993
00:41:30,244 --> 00:41:35,704
Sort of sharing the same wall used to be Cucamonga Cochina,

994
00:41:35,924 --> 00:41:37,464
the Mexican restaurant kitchen.

995
00:41:37,804 --> 00:41:41,384
And then across the way used to be Lucky Walk Fortune Cookie.

996
00:41:42,064 --> 00:41:44,504
A number of years ago, they swapped places

997
00:41:44,504 --> 00:41:47,604
because Lucky Walk Fortune Cookery

998
00:41:47,604 --> 00:41:49,824
was in a much larger space.

999
00:41:50,584 --> 00:41:53,284
But Cucamonga Cochina.

1000
00:41:53,304 --> 00:41:55,024
I'd like you to keep saying the names of these

1001
00:41:55,024 --> 00:41:56,344
over and over again, please.

1002
00:41:57,264 --> 00:41:59,404
Was the more successful restaurant.

1003
00:41:59,444 --> 00:42:02,524
So they're like, oh, well, let's move this over here.

1004
00:42:02,524 --> 00:42:05,484
But using tortillas, presumably that they would make

1005
00:42:05,484 --> 00:42:06,524
at the tortilla factory.

1006
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:07,264
That's my question.

1007
00:42:07,344 --> 00:42:10,724
Were they making those tortillas and then using them?

1008
00:42:10,844 --> 00:42:11,484
In the park?

1009
00:42:11,604 --> 00:42:12,504
Yeah, I think they were.

1010
00:42:12,684 --> 00:42:14,564
I mean, just like they make the sourdough

1011
00:42:14,564 --> 00:42:16,084
that they use the sourdough.

1012
00:42:16,164 --> 00:42:17,964
At the, for like bread bowls and stuff?

1013
00:42:18,184 --> 00:42:18,884
Yeah, for bread bowls.

1014
00:42:19,144 --> 00:42:23,204
So do we know if they're still using mission tortillas?

1015
00:42:23,264 --> 00:42:24,324
Oh, that's a good question.

1016
00:42:24,544 --> 00:42:24,804
I don't know.

1017
00:42:24,804 --> 00:42:26,364
You'd have to see who sponsored.

1018
00:42:26,724 --> 00:42:29,424
Well, we're gonna have to do some investigative journalism.

1019
00:42:30,144 --> 00:42:31,304
Drop them, Disney.

1020
00:42:31,924 --> 00:42:34,524
Or else make, set up a new demonstration kitchen

1021
00:42:34,524 --> 00:42:36,424
and make the food available to eat.

1022
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:39,024
What I found interesting is just looking at Yelp

1023
00:42:39,024 --> 00:42:43,144
and the rides are reviewed on Yelp and restaurants.

1024
00:42:43,924 --> 00:42:45,984
And like I was looking, Blue Bayou Restaurant

1025
00:42:45,984 --> 00:42:47,764
at Disneyland is four stars.

1026
00:42:48,144 --> 00:42:51,764
And I looked at Carly Circle, four stars, good rating.

1027
00:42:52,184 --> 00:42:54,404
Mission Tortilla Factory is rated

1028
00:42:54,664 --> 00:42:58,084
still here, four and a half stars.

1029
00:42:58,184 --> 00:43:00,324
Higher than Carthy Circle?

1030
00:43:01,324 --> 00:43:03,524
Just solely because you got something free?

1031
00:43:03,844 --> 00:43:06,144
But yeah, everyone is so jacked

1032
00:43:06,144 --> 00:43:08,324
about getting that tortilla at the end.

1033
00:43:08,804 --> 00:43:10,864
And it's like five star, five star, five star.

1034
00:43:10,924 --> 00:43:12,804
Delicious warm fresh tortilla, five star.

1035
00:43:12,804 --> 00:43:14,984
OMG, the five stars, five star.

1036
00:43:15,164 --> 00:43:18,144
Like this place is delicious, yummy and free, I'm there.

1037
00:43:18,184 --> 00:43:21,164
Like it's constant people just being like,

1038
00:43:21,164 --> 00:43:24,304
hell yeah, free tortilla, five stars.

1039
00:43:25,124 --> 00:43:27,964
Hell yeah, they showed me a dessert I couldn't have.

1040
00:43:28,064 --> 00:43:29,064
Five stars.

1041
00:43:30,444 --> 00:43:35,844
I'm a tad confused by that, but hey, yep.

1042
00:43:36,144 --> 00:43:37,564
I did like that free tortilla, I'll tell you that.

1043
00:43:37,584 --> 00:43:38,344
I did too.

1044
00:43:39,004 --> 00:43:41,744
Let's play the final round of tortilla toss up.

1045
00:43:43,164 --> 00:43:46,044
Construct your, you said what you preferred

1046
00:43:46,044 --> 00:43:48,024
in the last round, construct your favorite,

1047
00:43:48,064 --> 00:43:48,844
your perfect one.

1048
00:43:49,024 --> 00:43:50,444
So Mike, your perfect quesadilla,

1049
00:43:50,524 --> 00:43:51,304
what would you like in there?

1050
00:43:51,404 --> 00:43:53,244
Oh baby, okay.

1051
00:43:54,424 --> 00:43:56,524
So it's hard because some quesadilla,

1052
00:43:56,624 --> 00:43:59,864
I'll say my favorite quesadilla is a place in,

1053
00:43:59,884 --> 00:44:03,144
is probably at a place, a chain called Bajito Mas.

1054
00:44:03,804 --> 00:44:07,464
And they do what's called a nature's grilled quesadilla.

1055
00:44:07,524 --> 00:44:09,784
And they load it up with a lot of vegetables.

1056
00:44:10,184 --> 00:44:12,804
And I'm sure it seems maybe like it could trick you

1057
00:44:12,804 --> 00:44:13,584
into thinking it's healthy,

1058
00:44:13,584 --> 00:44:15,984
but I think it's just fried in like delicious fat

1059
00:44:15,984 --> 00:44:16,524
or something.

1060
00:44:16,824 --> 00:44:18,424
And it's loaded.

1061
00:44:18,684 --> 00:44:20,724
It's the messiest quesadilla.

1062
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:22,204
It falls apart very easily.

1063
00:44:22,544 --> 00:44:25,244
But full of vegetables, really good taste.

1064
00:44:25,244 --> 00:44:26,764
You can add meat in there if you want.

1065
00:44:26,804 --> 00:44:27,584
I've done it before.

1066
00:44:28,124 --> 00:44:31,644
So if I'm, I'm going to say the Bajito Mas,

1067
00:44:31,944 --> 00:44:33,884
nature's grilled quesadilla,

1068
00:44:34,524 --> 00:44:37,204
and I'll add carnitas to it.

1069
00:44:37,664 --> 00:44:39,644
Yeah, they do good carnitas there.

1070
00:44:39,644 --> 00:44:40,964
It's a good, it's a good chain.

1071
00:44:41,244 --> 00:44:43,444
I love the Burbank one specifically.

1072
00:44:44,264 --> 00:44:45,704
Scott, your perfect taco.

1073
00:44:46,144 --> 00:44:49,244
I think I want like as little on it as possible.

1074
00:44:49,244 --> 00:44:51,224
I like those little guys with,

1075
00:44:51,224 --> 00:44:52,684
and maybe I want a variety.

1076
00:44:52,824 --> 00:44:55,184
Like I want those like real thin tortillas,

1077
00:44:55,224 --> 00:44:56,104
not overwhelming.

1078
00:44:56,504 --> 00:44:59,964
And just like a steak and a carnitas and an El Paso,

1079
00:45:00,044 --> 00:45:01,864
let's get a little variety.

1080
00:45:02,304 --> 00:45:03,844
There's little other stuff as,

1081
00:45:03,904 --> 00:45:06,264
but like I think just the pure just meat and tortilla,

1082
00:45:06,404 --> 00:45:07,984
really good stand taco.

1083
00:45:07,984 --> 00:45:09,544
And just like a little strip of salsa.

1084
00:45:09,724 --> 00:45:11,384
Yeah, probably something.

1085
00:45:11,544 --> 00:45:13,644
I mean, I like the stands and just like,

1086
00:45:13,644 --> 00:45:14,844
I don't know, General Green.

1087
00:45:14,864 --> 00:45:15,584
There we go.

1088
00:45:15,844 --> 00:45:16,524
Yeah, I do too.

1089
00:45:16,604 --> 00:45:18,444
So yeah, more simple the better.

1090
00:45:19,724 --> 00:45:22,864
I like a nice al pastor burrito,

1091
00:45:22,944 --> 00:45:25,684
especially LA chain cactus tacos.

1092
00:45:26,204 --> 00:45:30,184
You get al pastor, rice beans, onion, cilantro, hot sauce.

1093
00:45:30,284 --> 00:45:31,684
And topped off with a hot dog.

1094
00:45:31,984 --> 00:45:33,944
And add some avocado and sour cream.

1095
00:45:34,924 --> 00:45:35,804
Maybe a hot dog.

1096
00:45:37,044 --> 00:45:38,404
At the end of tortilla, it's awesome.

1097
00:45:38,584 --> 00:45:41,804
And I think we've reached the end of our first seat ticket.

1098
00:45:42,024 --> 00:45:43,644
Our first seat ticket.

1099
00:45:44,044 --> 00:45:45,944
Thanks for cashing in your seat ticket

1100
00:45:45,944 --> 00:45:49,424
as a peel off of your Patreon park hopper.

1101
00:45:50,164 --> 00:45:52,724
And thanks for subscribing to the Patreon in general.

1102
00:45:53,224 --> 00:45:56,924
We hope that you're finding our tortilla picks

1103
00:45:56,924 --> 00:45:59,244
worth your patronage.

1104
00:46:00,264 --> 00:46:00,884
Yeah, this is fun.

1105
00:46:00,924 --> 00:46:04,344
Let us know what else you want to hear as a seat ticket.

1106
00:46:04,384 --> 00:46:07,524
Let us know if you want to hear more foreign language speak

1107
00:46:07,524 --> 00:46:09,224
throughout these episodes.

1108
00:46:09,484 --> 00:46:11,484
And like, what do you want Jason to investigate?

1109
00:46:11,604 --> 00:46:13,244
What companies do you want him to investigate

1110
00:46:13,244 --> 00:46:14,464
that are related to theme parks?

1111
00:46:14,884 --> 00:46:17,584
And I'm not being, I mean, it's a fun idea,

1112
00:46:17,604 --> 00:46:19,504
but I'm not being facetious that you did a good job.

1113
00:46:19,564 --> 00:46:20,744
You did a, it was interesting.

1114
00:46:21,244 --> 00:46:24,244
And what other companies do you want Jason to investigate?

1115
00:46:24,244 --> 00:46:24,884
Oh my God.

1116
00:46:25,784 --> 00:46:26,384
What have I done?

1117
00:46:27,004 --> 00:46:28,224
I'll post a link to that article.

1118
00:46:28,444 --> 00:46:29,704
I did think it was very interesting.

1119
00:46:29,704 --> 00:46:33,324
Especially what's like scandalous presidential elections

1120
00:46:33,324 --> 00:46:34,144
get involved.

1121
00:46:34,304 --> 00:46:37,024
Is there a Ziploc controversy perhaps?

1122
00:46:37,424 --> 00:46:38,284
Is there, who knows?

1123
00:46:38,364 --> 00:46:39,624
Like, let's look into this.

1124
00:46:39,744 --> 00:46:41,484
Let's see what the bag Ziploc bag.

1125
00:46:41,544 --> 00:46:42,744
We all probably shouldn't be using them.

1126
00:46:42,784 --> 00:46:43,844
Well, that's true.

1127
00:46:45,004 --> 00:46:47,724
But yeah, we just, yeah, let us know.

1128
00:46:47,824 --> 00:46:50,544
Send this cub out for more scoops.

1129
00:46:50,784 --> 00:46:53,464
Let us, he wants to look for some more honey, I guess.

1130
00:46:53,904 --> 00:46:56,984
Honey equals scoops in my analogy here.

1131
00:46:57,944 --> 00:46:58,264
All right.

1132
00:46:58,264 --> 00:46:58,524
All right.

1133
00:46:58,584 --> 00:47:01,564
Well, you survived the second gate and yeah,

1134
00:47:01,664 --> 00:47:03,124

1135
00:47:03,124 --> 00:47:04,364

Adios.
