00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,960
Welcome to Hauntcast, the Fright, the Cemetery Gate. We're in an awkward position because

2
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:26,240
we're recording these out of order. Do we have the scary names yet or do we punt? Because

3
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,080
the listener may have already heard them. Oh yeah, good question.

4
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:30,680
We can just punt. We should punt.

5
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:36,680
Alright, great. So you'll hear the scary names in the past. For now, I'm Scott Gardner, there's

6
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:42,480
Mike Carlson. How much is this blowing your mind? What an inception of dates, eh?

7
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:49,000
Yeah, we are out of order and I feel like I've been like, I'm in a different timeline

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,560
or something. I'm in a different multiverse. Halloween multiverse.

9
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:56,080
Yeah, I mean, we're just, our priorities are just, you know, we're a little bit in the

10
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:01,920
past. So our priorities are getting Joe Biden elected and, you know, giving Donald Trump

11
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:07,720
the proper break and for the heroism of surviving the shooting. That's where, if that places

12
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:10,080
this in a time of when we're recording it. Right.

13
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,080
And we wish, but yeah, Godspeed Joe. I think he's going to pull it out. Jason Sheridan.

14
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:21,120
Well, I'm an RFK man, you know that. Yeah, yeah. I am too. And I think he, in a way,

15
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:25,320
like aligns with the Democrats and I think he's going to be good for the Joe cause at

16
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:29,880
the end of the day. Sure. And I don't think we're going to find out several more instances

17
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:35,920
of animal abuse. Okay, yeah. Bizarre things that he, I think he, you know, how many more

18
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:42,760
could there be? I just also, I went to Vegas yesterday and I put five grand on JLo and

19
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:47,640
Ben Affleck staying together. Nice. That's smart. Cause I believe in them and I don't

20
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,960
think anything's going to happen. Yeah, yeah. That's good. Well, you've been talking about

21
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:55,000
betting more. That reminds us, we should do some of that D23 betting. Maybe we should

22
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,400
actually do the D, again, that's a future thing. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But that's, yeah,

23
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,280
if you're going to bet on something, that's, that's the thing to bet on. And I bet, I bet

24
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:09,360
against Ben Affleck hanging out with RFK's daughter. Kick Kennedy. Well, now, now I'm

25
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,680
lost regardless of what time it is. Kick Kennedy just threw me now. I'm just floating through

26
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:25,360
space. I'm lost like Sandra Bullock in gravity. I'll tell you this, that will never happen.

27
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:30,280
All right. I just, well, we should put more money on it off air. Is Kick Kennedy a nickname?

28
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:35,560
I actually don't know if Kick Kennedy is her real legal name, but she's referred to as

29
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:41,440
Kick in articles I've seen, including the 2012 Town and Country Magazine article where

30
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:46,760
it's revealed that RFK used a chainsaw to cut the head off of a whale, tie it to the

31
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:51,400
top of the family car and drive five hours back to their house with his two kids in the

32
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:58,400
back and the whale juice falling into the car. So he put plastic bags on the kid's head,

33
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:03,680
cut mouth holes in the plastic bags so they wouldn't suffocate and drove with this giant

34
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:09,880
whale's head just bleeding the whole time back to the house. This story, especially as you're

35
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:15,400
hearing this, you may have heard this. I heard the vaguest, I saw in my rear view mirror at

36
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:20,480
some point, whale, never put it together. I'm happy that I heard it from you. You need to hear

37
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:25,280
that from somebody you trust. Right, of course. I also think the media might not have used the

38
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:31,280
phrase whale juice. I'm glad you've gotten your colorful description. I believe the article is

39
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,360
about Kick Kennedy and I think she may have said whale juice. I think she may have said juice

40
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,480
specifically. So anyway, I'm betting that Ben Affleck doesn't end up with her at all.

41
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:49,280
No, no. RFK Jr. is like, he's like Tom Green in Freddy Got Fingered. Apparently after he was

42
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:54,760
denying it for a while, but now RFK is admitting to having seen a deer on the side of the way,

43
00:03:54,760 --> 00:04:03,600
hit a deer, ripped apart his innards and wore the suit, wore the bloody carcass as a hood of sorts.

44
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:10,480
RFK Jr. went into a delivery room, delivered the baby himself and then swung the baby around by

45
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:16,960
like by the umbilical cord. These are very offensive antics, RFK. Well, hard times make

46
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:25,320
hard babies. They should. RFK, because he's had a lot of hard times. He worked several times in a

47
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:30,360
cheese sandwich shop and he, you know, sure he didn't do the tasks of the day. He just stacked

48
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:35,200
a bunch of piles of cheese on top of other piles of cheese, but he did technically do the shifts,

49
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:43,240
despite his dream of being an animator. Right. I was most interested in that he is the center

50
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:50,440
square on one of today's topics. Did he pull a little time as well? Yeah, he's next to Cronk.

51
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:56,160
Oh geez. Wow. He actually, wow. That's funny. They feel like they mostly used canonical villains,

52
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:02,080
but they also let RFK Jr. do a spin. That's interesting. Yeah. Yeah. That's, that's, well,

53
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,680
it's some of what we're talking about today. This is, this will like evolve a little bit,

54
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:12,320
but here's where this started is that a while ago I did a post like, well, I think the post

55
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:18,360
was main feed wishes. So you didn't get your wish, but we are doing this. There was one that caught

56
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:22,520
my eye, got a lot of likes and I could file it away for a while. And this is from Kendor,

57
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:30,240
their wish for an episode about Villains Game Night, the bizarre Hollywood squares style game

58
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:38,040
show they play on Disney cruises using pre-recorded actors. And this had a strange photo that was a

59
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:45,080
screen divided into nine, sure enough, with little podiums. And it was a bunch of Disney villains,

60
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:52,640
all participating in some kind of game show, sure enough, all, but actors playing the Disney. This

61
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:59,080
is not, you know, CGI or animated depictions of these classic villains. These are actors. And that

62
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:03,760
image haunted me for a while. So as we got into haunt cast season, I'm like, maybe this is the time

63
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:09,240
as when in a time when villains rain, let's let them have their game night. Yeah. And that's also

64
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:16,320
just, it is, there are like little things that are also in our like zone of interest. Game shows,

65
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:20,840
Hollywood squares, which is very to me, even though there was a nineties and 2000s versions,

66
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:25,240
very seventies to me, like that feels. Well, yeah, it feels inevitable to talk about. Yeah,

67
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:31,920
Hollywood squares has come up somehow rarely specifically despite being the like main,

68
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:42,160
uh, like layer, I would say of the, I'm gonna use the word layer where, uh, uh, where all of the

69
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,720
carrot, all of the old character actors who we waste a lot of time talking about the seventies,

70
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:54,760
strange relics, your Paul Lins, your Sandy Duncan's, uh, and ones we haven't even mentioned,

71
00:06:54,760 --> 00:07:00,640
but, uh, I'll just, I'll say it, madam, madam was only squares, but then you also get to the

72
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:06,240
nineties, two thousands. And one of our guys was always on Bruce flange. Oh, right. So there's,

73
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:11,360
there's a lot of PTR legends, future legends that were involved in the Hollywood squares.

74
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:18,000
There's a full time Hollywood squares channel on Pluto TV. And I was flipping through and saw,

75
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,720
I mean, okay, I know there's, you know, there's especially that version. There were reasonably

76
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:27,520
big stars on that show. Well, I think Ellen DeGeneres was the center square for a long time,

77
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:32,960
yet it really stopped. I was just flipping through, passing by quick. And then I saw Michael

78
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:39,520
Jackson. I'm like, hang on. Michael Jackson feels like too big of a star in the early two thousands

79
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:44,400
to be on Hollywood squares. Then I backed up as fast as I could, landed on it and discovered it

80
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:51,600
was impersonator week. Okay. Not in the squares, but the contestants. So confusingly it was

81
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:57,280
contestants, impersonators who look like Michael and Janet Jackson saying, I'll take Jeffrey

82
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:02,880
Tambor to block and a voice that doesn't sound like Michael at all, but an eerily, maybe the

83
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:09,200
best Michael Jackson physical impersonator I've ever seen. Wow. Just play. And he, he pulled it

84
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:14,400
out, I think. And he was like, if you win this round, you get a new car. And the new car was

85
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:20,160
presented by a Ricky Martin. So mediocre that I wasn't sure until 30 seconds in it was a Ricky

86
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,640
Martin. Oh, wow. It was kind of, cause like, I don't know if it's just a guy and a guy who I

87
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:29,520
looked a little more white to me than not. So if it's just kind of a tall white guy with a nice

88
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:37,200
haircut and a black shirt, it can't be so sure it's a Ricky Martin. Also there are real celebrities

89
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:43,680
on the show. Why? What's the point of impersonator week? Yeah, I guess. Well, I don't know that not,

90
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:48,240
again, not as big, the stars aren't as big as Michael Jackson. Yeah, I guess that's true.

91
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:54,480
It's still almost like an insult to the stars you do have. That's, that's bizarre. Carol Channing.

92
00:08:54,480 --> 00:09:00,320
Uh huh. And the Carol Channing is still alive and doing it in the 2000s. Wow. Answering questions

93
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:05,200
from a perfect looking but terrible sounding Michael Jackson. Jason, you got to get on that.

94
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:10,400
Carol Channing's involved? Oh, yeah. That's one of your girls. I could see that being a current

95
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:18,880
hall pass. If you ran into a Carol Channing impersonator. I, unfortunately, they're not

96
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:26,560
fictional. I feel like that's been the running theme is that all my hall passes are fictional

97
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:33,440
characters. Right, right. Yeah. But what if she, Carol Channing, sorry, passed away five years ago.

98
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:39,760
She was 97. It was only five years ago? Yeah, she was 97 years old. What, what harm would it have done?

99
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:46,080
You know what I'm saying? A spirit, we're talking like, acroid Ghostbusters, first Ghostbusters

100
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:51,600
situation. Oh, you would, oh, you're talking about the ghost. The ghostly head of the famous

101
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,880
hair of Carol Channing moves down into your lap. And I do the like, oh, like I do it the wrong way.

102
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,040
Well, I was going to say something different. So yeah, I like what you're saying. Wait, wait, wait.

103
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:06,720
I'm going to ask you to do the sound after I first say, well, hello, Jason. I feel like.

104
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:15,120
You didn't, that was the sound. Sorry, sorry, go. Hello, Jason. Oh, it's very hang kill. It's a real

105
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:22,320
hang kill. That's all right. All right. Well, I was going somewhere else, but I'm glad you took it

106
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:27,920
into a Halloween zone with the ghost. I appreciate that because it is called Cast of Fright. There's

107
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:32,720
still time, there's still weeks ahead in which the spirits may gather and fingers crossed, Jason

108
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:40,000
gets a ghost blow job. Oh my God. This is well, unfortunately, but Madam is fictional, you know.

109
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,200
Yeah. Who are you talking about? You would all pass with Madam. I think, I think. Madam's alive,

110
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:50,960
by the way. I think she would be over you. Are you saying Madam's alive? Madam is alive.

111
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:56,240
Wayland Flowers has passed away, but Madam is alive. What do you mean by Madam is alive?

112
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:01,440
What's your game here? We don't have the weirdo anymore. Let's all turn the mic. All right.

113
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:06,240
Turning the weirdo like cha-chunk, it's on mic now. Madam is a puppet. Madam has never canonically

114
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:13,440
died. Madam is alive. So. Yeah, I see what you're saying. Unlike the late great Hannibal Lecter,

115
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:18,640
she has not been canonically. The late great Madam. Lambchop didn't die. Sherry Lewis died.

116
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:24,400
Mallory Lewis, Sherry's daughter is doing Lambchop. I guess by a lot, but if we're going from the top

117
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:30,240
down, then the top puppet Kermit, at least to me, Madam might be yours. To me, the top puppet Kermit

118
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:35,520
did not die when Jemison died. So I guess so. Are people doing Madam though? Oh, why did I ask

119
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:40,240
that question? I don't want to know the answer at all. We've gotten messages. People are still

120
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:45,520
doing Madam, performing as Madam. So Madam is alive. So Madam's not a ghost. That's all I'm saying.

121
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:49,200
So if you're talking about hooking up with Madam or me, I don't know who you're talking about,

122
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:55,120
Jason. Madam would not be a ghost. She would be alive. Okay. Okay. I just want to make this

123
00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:01,200
very clear. All it takes, I think, is you getting your hands on a Madam puppet

124
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:07,360
and then moving the Madam puppet wherever you see fit. I have had an idea, and we haven't done it,

125
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:11,360
and we're not going to do it this year for Honkest of Fright, but I've had an idea

126
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:17,840
for a seance for a long time, but now I have to add in calling the ghost of Carol Channing into

127
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:22,720
the seance. So I've added things now to this plan. It's not going to happen this year,

128
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:28,800
but one of these days, one of these years, we will do a seance, and part of it is now going

129
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:33,280
to be summoning the ghost of Carol Channing. You really want to mess with the spirit world?

130
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:39,840
I absolutely do. If it gets your hall pass taken care of, then yeah, we will go to any length

131
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:45,520
in this realm or others. And I will bring a Madam puppet who is alive,

132
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:51,680
who is still alive. She will be in the room with us. It is really only a matter of time

133
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:56,560
before you have a Madam, because you want it for the show. You bring up your daughter,

134
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:02,880
likes your puppet stuff a lot. It's going to be like, look, Lindsay, it's a business expense

135
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:08,000
and an invaluable home expense. Do you want me to bond with her daughter or not?

136
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,040
What better way than with a clackety, dick-faced old lady?

137
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,760
I'm tired of the third degree, Linz.

138
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:17,600
I make the money in this house.

139
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:26,240
You spent five grand on a perfect recreation of Madam. You had a puppeteer or a puppet maker

140
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:32,240
make it. You had like an artisan make it in Spain, and they sent it over. They had to

141
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:38,880
overnight it for $500 with the most care and packaging you've ever seen.

142
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,440
The finest hair from the most beautiful horses.

143
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,800
A horse was killed in order to provide the hair for my Madam puppet.

144
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:55,200
Sure. They actually told me they could have just like cut the hair off, but I said, no,

145
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:59,520
kill it. I don't want anyone else getting that hair and making their own better Madam.

146
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,840
Right. I bought the poison and sent it to Spain.

147
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:10,560
It sounds like most of the money in this case was spent on international shipping.

148
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,680
Well, that's a big part of it. If you find the best puppet

149
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,520
maker, it's obviously somebody in Spain.

150
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,400
Best puppet makers are in Spain. Best horses are, I don't know where.

151
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,880
Where was Geppetto? Where was he from?

152
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,160
Italy.

153
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:28,960
Italy? All right. Maybe it's Italy. I don't know. Spain or Italy. They're close together.

154
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,200
Again, you're burning money because you sent it to the wrong country,

155
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:36,720
so then you had to get it back and send it to the right country.

156
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,440
You just sent it to the country in general. To Spain.

157
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,360
To Spain. That's not specific enough.

158
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,120
Return for not being specific enough.

159
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,560
Yeah. All right.

160
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,280
Well, we sure have talked about that now.

161
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:47,600
Okay.

162
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:53,040
The point is Hollywood Squares was a game show in which there was a kind of scarily big set

163
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:59,360
where enough to stack three sets of B-list actors on top of each other,

164
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:05,760
and you would perform a ... Their contestants would face off against each other in a giant

165
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:13,120
tic-tac-toe, which was based around answering questions correctly, and they'd kind of

166
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:19,760
devilishly lie and poke her face. Do you think that's right or do you not?

167
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:24,480
Yeah. Or if you were like a Paul Lynn, you would have jokes ready to go,

168
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,240
I think, for a lot of these questions, and then you would say it, get a laugh,

169
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,440
and then answer seriously.

170
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,880
Then answer for real. Yeah. Get your double entendre out.

171
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,160
Fake or fake answer.

172
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:42,000
So that's the format. A big trivia-oriented tic-tac-toe. So that brings us to this cruise

173
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:48,400
ship entertainment. We have not done a lot of cruise ship stuff, and so I needed to get my

174
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:52,960
head straight about which ship we're on and what we're dealing with here. This was entertainment

175
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:58,800
for the Disney Wish, which is the fifth Disney cruise ship. That's not going to help me because

176
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:04,480
they're all named some Disney word like that. But this is a pretty recently launched ship,

177
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:10,240
whatever you want to say, Summer 2022. A lot of crazy entertainment on this. We probably do need

178
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:16,000
to look into the cruise ships a little more, just for oddities that are only there, only in these

179
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,160
specific vessels.

180
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:25,840
I've been watching. I have been putting on Travel Vlogger, like going on the biggest cruise ship

181
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:33,840
in the world, or going on this Disney cruise. And I find them very relaxing, and I'm fascinated

182
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:42,320
by the full ecosystem located on a cruise ship. That said, I do not particularly want to go on

183
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:47,280
myself, but I like watching them. I like living vicariously.

184
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:56,720
Me too. I've discussed watching videos starring my hall pass that is impossible, 1987 specific

185
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:02,320
Kathie Lee Gifford. It really sold me on the notion of a Carnival cruise then. I don't

186
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:07,840
particularly want to do one now. Mike, I have a prediction coming into this. I think you're

187
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:12,240
going to become a cruise guy. I think you're going to do a Disney cruise and then be so

188
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:18,320
in on it. As I was driving here, I said, I'm probably going to do one of these in the next

189
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:21,200
five years. Or 10 years. Let's say 10.

190
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:26,000
Because they do leave from Southern California. There is Southern California.

191
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:26,960
A Disney one?

192
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:27,600
Yeah.

193
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:32,400
I don't know. I wonder if I'll be a cruise guy. It's still not something that I'm excited

194
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:39,840
to become. I think there was a will in my... I had a will to become a haunt guy in some ways,

195
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:45,200
to conquer something, to watch scary movies. I don't really feel like I'm not excited to

196
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,720
become a cruise guy like I was to be a haunt guy.

197
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,040
Sure. It's not something you're aspiring to.

198
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:55,600
But I'm not saying I won't be that. I'm just saying I don't have quite the energy there.

199
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,760
Sure. But I could just see you on the other side going, and all the meals are paid for.

200
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,680
Sure, that sounds expensive when you go in, but then you get all the food for free.

201
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,200
The drinks are out on, but I could see you just doing this.

202
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,800
That sounds like this guy, though, too.

203
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:10,800
It does sound like me. Although I have to say, I've watched some ordinary

204
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:14,320
adventures cruise ship videos. It seems like there's a lot of add-ons.

205
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:15,680
Oh, I'm sure. Disney, of course.

206
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,520
A lot more add-ons. Certainly for...

207
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,440
Now, that really sounds like Jason.

208
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:25,360
Certainly for alcohol, but there are some... And you're paying cheaper, like,

209
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,440
you know, entrees. But there are some restaurants where you're charging into the room.

210
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:36,320
I would still, I think, rather go to do the Star Trek cruise than I would a Disney cruise.

211
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,480
I think that's fair.

212
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,080
Oh, my God. I shouldn't say this, but I have to now.

213
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:46,240
Armand Shimmerman is teaching a class on Shakespeare in Glendale.

214
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,080
I have to take it, I think.

215
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:48,960
Oh, hell yes.

216
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:53,200
You're going to go take a Shakespearean acting class just to be around Armand Shimmerman.

217
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:59,120
I think I have to. I got a call there. He's like, here's the phone number for the theater. Call it.

218
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:03,200
Have you ever had any desire to do or learn Shakespeare before?

219
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:03,600
Never.

220
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:09,920
So you're going to go, and then whatever, what do you anticipate the class, like, assignments,

221
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,120
or what are you going to end up doing?

222
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:15,440
I don't know. I have to, like, memorize shit? Like, I have to memorize Shakespearean dialogue?

223
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,960
Hamlet? Or with the apostrophe. There's no V.

224
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:25,840
Yeah, you have to get it pretty word perfect, and then you have to get the rhythm and then

225
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:32,560
trying to put it in modern delivery. Some friends have done Shakespeare. I think it's very fascinating.

226
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:36,240
Right, and it would be very fascinating to do with Armand specifically.

227
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:42,720
Yeah, except for all the parts where he isn't there, where you will be bored to tears and

228
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:48,720
stressed out because, as Jason said, there's a lot to figure out, and there are stakes in you pulling

229
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,080
it off perfectly because you don't want Armand Shimmerman yelling at you.

230
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:56,800
I don't want that. No, I want to please him more than anything.

231
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,240
What character is he again?

232
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:58,880
He's Quark.

233
00:19:58,880 --> 00:19:59,680
He's Quark.

234
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,600
Yeah, but he's also on Buffy and he's been on a lot of stuff.

235
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:05,760
Now, do I have to say quark like that, not quark, because then you'll yell at me for

236
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,640
pronouncing it wrong?

237
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:11,840
That's less of a thing, but he's Quark. He had the bar on Deep Space Nine, which they had in Vegas,

238
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:17,120
and they're doing a Star Trek, the Universal, for this weird fan thing in the spring,

239
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,560
and they're going to have some sort of immersive experience.

240
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:23,520
Oh, these Horror Nights, Adjacent, Fan Nights, Star Trek Nights, Dungeons & Dragons Nights,

241
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,240
and Back to the Future.

242
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,040
Yeah, so I wonder if they put up a Quarks bar at Universal.

243
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:31,520
I was confused by that. Is each one its own night or is it all at once?

244
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,920
I think it's all at once, but let's get back to the topic.

245
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,760
Oh, okay. Thank you. Very good.

246
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,320
Sorry, sorry.

247
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,440
I just want to give you room to stretch.

248
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,480
Not your fault, my fault, Jason.

249
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:43,920
No, no. In terms of crew's stuff, here's things that I didn't know, because these will be basics

250
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:48,720
if listeners have been on these things. I didn't know that they have what they call

251
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:53,200
the only Disney attraction at sea, the Aquamouse.

252
00:20:54,720 --> 00:21:00,960
It's like a water slide that's more complicated, that has kind of launches, that goes up and down,

253
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,720
and that has screens in a long tunnel, and they've started utilizing these

254
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:09,040
to tell little stories a little bit, even though the ride isn't just to slide through tubes.

255
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:13,920
But they do little, there's custom, it's those newer Disney or the newer Mickey animation

256
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:21,520
made for cruise ship tunnels, specifically, that imply that you're doing like a bobsled run

257
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:28,720
or whatever. So that's interesting. This is the ship that has the Avengers quantum encounter,

258
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:33,760
the dining experience where Paul Rudd filmed specific stuff for this.

259
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:38,560
They only see on the Wish. They got a Star Wars hyperspace lounge, which is no Quarks bar,

260
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,920
it's not bad, I saw a couple photos of it.

261
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:48,320
And then what they have is a, well it seems like they've also done,

262
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:53,600
they've programmed Halloween stuff, because what I saw is that there's like an adults,

263
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,560
I think adults only thing, I could be wrong, but there's something called,

264
00:21:56,560 --> 00:22:00,640
they did something called Oogie Boogie's Villainous Nightmare, and that has like,

265
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:06,800
it's like a night, it's a scary nightclub, and then there's like characters who lead you into it

266
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:14,560
to go to this Oogie Boogie bash at sea, and a guy named Vex with two Xs leads you along and says,

267
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:22,080
I am a chaser of dreams and nightmares. So we got original IP, ship only, you get to meet Vex,

268
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,560
and then once you get into that dance party, it's stuff like this, it's these characters on

269
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:33,360
screens portrayed by actors in some makeup, maybe not movie quality makeup, but something.

270
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:40,880
So there's that, but then what you've got is a lounge, I guess more of a theater area called

271
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:45,920
Luna, and that's where this thing happens, it boasts this giant LED screen that you can do a

272
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:50,640
lot of stuff with, and this is one of the big attractions, they, I can't tell if they still

273
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:55,840
have it, this might have been a seasonal, brief Halloween only, but I could be wrong,

274
00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:02,560
maybe they are doing it this year. They love mashing up the villains around Halloween,

275
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:09,280
I watched a live stream from the first night of the Oogie Boogie bash, and like so many villains

276
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:14,640
in the parade, you go on the tree trails, you meet different villains and stuff.

277
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:21,760
Right, right. Well that's, as a kid and as an adult man, the mashup of the villains has always

278
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:26,640
been very exciting to me, whether it's just the sing along song tape on the lawn of the haunted

279
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:32,480
mansion in Disneyland or anything else, that's always been very exciting, and they're doing

280
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:38,160
of course the Villains Land in Florida, which is like, in some ways I was thinking about this,

281
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:43,840
this is the only, this is almost the only way you get something like a little surprising or original

282
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:49,360
is now having the villains in different contexts than just their own movies.

283
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:53,440
Yeah, which they seem to be a lot, that's something they seem to be open to and that they flirted

284
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:58,880
with with stuff like Villains Game Night, and yeah, I mean it's a good time to be talking

285
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:03,200
about this with Villains Land, whatever it's going to be called on the horizon,

286
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:08,000
is to start thinking about, well what is it like when all the villains get together,

287
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:14,800
because it sounds crazy and scary, but there's something a little more tortured about it than

288
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:19,280
what we're getting at Epic Universe, where the universal monsters who all feel part of the same

289
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:23,920
world are together. Frankenstein and Dracula, the moment the wolf man, all right that makes it,

290
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:29,920
there'd be some place where they all are. With Disney characters, it's like here's queens from

291
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:39,520
like pastoral Europe, and then there's a modern car driving puppy murderer in the fashion scene,

292
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:45,440
right, and then there's a lion, and then there's a big octopus, and then there's a chauvinistic

293
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:51,520
guy who's like a little too aggro. Yeah, yeah, it's just kind of a guy, yeah, he's got just a

294
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:56,160
little too proud of himself, right, and has a big musket, and then there's like, and then there's a

295
00:24:56,160 --> 00:25:01,440
priest who sniffs hair, and then there's like the, not the devil, but the king of the underwears,

296
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:06,400
like the manifestation of evil. I mean it's, look it's interesting as you add it all up,

297
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:11,520
but I'm a little curious what Villains Land is going to be, how do you justify getting the car

298
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:18,560
driving fashionista together really lion? Yeah, they're gonna, that's, that is fun in a way to

299
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:22,800
try to figure out what this like, like the narrative, because they will come up with I think a

300
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:27,280
narrative to put all the villains together. I'm assuming the biggie ticket will have all the

301
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:33,440
villains on it in some way. Are you assuming that? I wouldn't, my bet would be that it's kind of like,

302
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:38,480
that they'd silo the worlds a little bit, because like they aren't, wait a minute, wait a minute,

303
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:43,040
you're, because you're going off of, remind me, the epic universe ticket, or whatever they call it,

304
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:48,640
is, is a combo of monsters. Yes, it's all of them. The Frankenstein experiment,

305
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:52,800
Monsters Unchained, the Frankenstein experiment, I believe is the full name.

306
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:58,960
So I'm just going from the art of villains, which is just one piece, but there appears to be some

307
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:03,680
sort of Maleficent roller coaster, and then there's something in the distance, and they don't really

308
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:08,880
even suggest what it is, but what would you want from a land with an e-ticket with all the villains,

309
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,880
you would want to ride with all the villains on it. But doesn't it not feel like something

310
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:18,400
Disney does other than, I guess there's things where the heroes get together, although Mickey

311
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:23,120
and the gang feel like one thing, and if a villain, I don't know, I kind of don't think they're going

312
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:28,480
to do it, but doesn't feel like Disney does. They silo the heroes, I think, more than the villains.

313
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:35,280
Sure. Like the villains, I feel like there's a lot more wiggle room, and especially on the cruise

314
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:41,120
ship, that again, seems like its own ecosystem. Well yeah, the rules are different. International

315
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:46,640
waters. Anything goes. I just think, what would you want from an e-ticket dark ride in the villain's

316
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:52,160
land, other than having all the villains? I'll bet, we could bet some money, I'll bet money that

317
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:59,520
it's some sort of dark ride with all the villains represented somehow. I will go against that. Yeah,

318
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:06,080
I think they'll keep them siloed. I just don't see what it would be then. What would the big villain's

319
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:11,920
thing be? It's like, I don't know, it's just an Ursula thing, or just a Evil Queen thing. I'll bet

320
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:17,920
a hundred dollars. A Jafar thing. I'll bet a hundred dollars that it's an e-ticket. I don't care about it,

321
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:23,280
I'll do twenty. Okay, we're betting twenty dollars. I don't think it's a combo of, now is that e-ticket,

322
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:28,240
this doesn't, I have to protect myself in case they say, it's the villain's carousel, where they are

323
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:34,320
all together, I don't want to go. Well, I assume they'll be, unless the thing like drastically

324
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:38,880
changes from just the art, which the art could be early, because some of the other art we don't

325
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:44,240
know, it's different than maybe where they're placing certain things, who knows. But if it

326
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:48,480
seems like it's pretty much a similar aesthetic, and like there's a coaster here, and then there's

327
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:54,800
an e-ticket, that's some sort of dark ride. Sure. Yeah, within reach. We know what we're talking about.

328
00:27:54,800 --> 00:28:01,360
I think it has to have a lot of the villains. But the villain's wheel, a dreadfully dreary

329
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:08,240
ferris wheel where one car is 80s, that doesn't count. Okay, that doesn't count. But yes,

330
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:15,760
the d or e-ticket dark ride in Villain's Land, where like at least three different villains

331
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:20,880
of different types of stories interact at the very least. I really never thought about it.

332
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:27,120
Do you care enough to get in on that? I don't know. I saw someone speculating that like,

333
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:33,040
it looks like there's two roller coasters. I was like, I don't think they'll be two roller coasters.

334
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:36,800
I don't know if that would make any sense. I do think one of them will be Maleficent,

335
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:40,960
and they'll have the dragon. That's in the art. Yeah, that's in the art.

336
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:47,920
On the coaster area. But that's what you want from Villain's Land. What I want is a ride to see all

337
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:53,760
the villains. I want to see Chernobog hanging out with Scar. I want to see, you know, who is the

338
00:28:53,760 --> 00:29:02,560
villain of Oliver and Company. There's kind of a bunch. They're all kind of just like lightly mean

339
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:07,520
humans. Yeah, do you want like Rattigan yelling at you? I would love Rattigan. I don't think it's

340
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:12,880
happening either. But yes, I want to see them all teaming up. What's the Pocahontas one? Is he like

341
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:20,560
Rally? Oh, the purple man. What is his name? Why can't I think of it? Is he a real man who existed?

342
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:25,120
That's a good question, too. I don't know. Probably. But also, you know, you could say

343
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:30,240
John Smith is the villain of Pocahontas in real life. Yes, yeah. You could say it's everyone

344
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:37,680
together who made the movie. But yeah, I think that's happening. Okay, yeah. All right. Well,

345
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:43,120
bet that'll pay off, maybe. We agreed two grand. But I don't think we'd be wise to take the bet

346
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:49,200
that within the land there will be a game show that is kooky and has a joke where all of the

347
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:56,160
characters. So yeah, this is, it's a Hollywood Squares, but it's all villains. We get a big,

348
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:00,960
were we all watching the same video? I feel like I only found one. Okay, so there's one, there's,

349
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:05,760
we're all going off of one piece of camcorder footage that I think was filming one of those,

350
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:14,240
the family probably of one of the contestants. Right. But so as said in the topic suggestion,

351
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:18,720
there's a, there's a live host and live contestants, but then it's all triggering

352
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:25,520
of video elements. So there's a lot of prerecorded stuff and there's an interactivity to it because

353
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:31,520
it responds and plays off the audience suggestions. But mostly this gets this kind of eerie screen

354
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:38,480
situation. Yeah. Oogie Boogie is the announcer. Then we start getting villains out. And who do

355
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:48,720
we get? We get, we got Kronk. So that's, that's the most like physically off guy. That's like a

356
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:57,280
cousin Greg's kind of like lanky guy doing like a little bit of a horror thing. And then Yzma. So

357
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:03,840
we got a pair from Emperors New Groove. Cruella De Vil. This is another where the, you know,

358
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:09,760
sometimes you have like, you have like evil queens with dark magic. And then you have

359
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:17,040
three ladies who are mean to one of their stepdaughter of the family. You have Drizella,

360
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:25,360
Anastasia, and Lady Tremaine. I never think about that character's name. Lady Tremaine.

361
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:30,400
I want to give me that Lady Tremaine coaster. I want to go imagine we're like in one of her

362
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:36,880
devilish nightmares. And the coaster goes through the, the track is in the shape of her hair,

363
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:42,080
the two big buns. I would love to see like online discourse of like,

364
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:50,480
guys, I love being part of the Disney fandom, but the toxic Lady Tremaine fans are starting to get

365
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:59,120
a little too much. It's got to be there somewhere. If you dig. Kind of related. I saw. I'm sick of

366
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:07,280
the Tremaniacs. I saw a take on Twitter because in the, the Marvel comics currently Storm of the

367
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:14,560
X-Men is getting her own solo series and she's joining the Avengers. And I saw someone go like,

368
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:23,200
finally Storm will get away from the toxic X-Men fans. And I went, what is this? This is what does

369
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:29,920
that even mean? What does this mean? Like, I don't know. I don't know. I hate to tell that person if

370
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:36,640
it's a female character in a movie, toxic fandom will find the character. Yeah. No, there's no

371
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:42,880
escaping it. Yeah. There's no escaping. It is a fictional female character in any form of media,

372
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:50,480
really. So yeah, Lady Tremaine's there. I'm quaking now. I can't, I want to get out of Luna.

373
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:56,800
I was scared of Lady Tremaine. She's so mean as a kid. I was just like, I don't like, she scares me.

374
00:32:56,800 --> 00:33:01,920
No. She didn't have any powers. And of course that would, that would cause her to have the

375
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:08,880
most toxic fandom. Cause she was a mean lady. She was mean lady. Maybe you're right. I don't,

376
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:12,720
we'll look for it. We'll look for this fandom that exists. Go ahead. Get in the comments. Start

377
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:17,440
yelling at us. Jason, would you say you were attracted to Lady Tremaine in any way? I know,

378
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:23,600
Michael, don't be ridiculous. Okay. I'm a Drizella boy. Okay. You're more of a Drizella.

379
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:28,480
Got it. Yeah. No, I was afraid of all of these characters and not attracted to any of them.

380
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:37,040
I believe you. Maleficent's boy is, I really learned that it's Maleficent and I'm Maleficent

381
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:44,320
from the red squiggle under my Google doc notes. I'll fix that one forever now. And then Center

382
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:50,320
Square, Hades. Um, now Hades is present. We're going to touch on something else in this episode

383
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:57,200
a little bit, but the, uh, this is Hades as Center Square completely plays into the Paul Lind

384
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:06,400
right. Uh, mode of Center Square of kind of like showbiz, like the pizzazzy guy. They definitely

385
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:12,640
lean away from, I mean, I get, I don't know, it's in the spirit of the James Woods portrayal in that

386
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:18,640
James Woods was like a sleazy agent, fast talker, but they definitely go a lot more like, Hey,

387
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:27,520
Hey, you know, we're almost more in Green Goblin territory. Um, but just like, yo, yeah. Fun, fun

388
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:34,960
host. Hello. Which I wonder, I mean, I love it because it's like kind of a, it's like an affront

389
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:41,520
to James Woods. I don't think he would be happy with this portrayal. Right. So they're sticking

390
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:45,920
it to him on some level, I guess. Um, which puts him in it. I feel like there is a lot of demand

391
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:52,160
for Hades and Hercules. Yes. And he's at the different like show, like nighttime parties

392
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:56,480
at boogie boogie bash or whatever, like Hades. And he has like a light up hair now. I feel like

393
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:00,640
they have a good costume for him. The hair effect is really cool. Maybe they did that before. I just,

394
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:06,800
I think it's, I think it's paint and then they changed the lighting and then, so the hair,

395
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:10,880
but I'm not, I saw like a tick tock of it or something. Yeah. I was trying to figure it out

396
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:15,600
Hades and Dr. Doofenshmirtz are the new. Oh, well he's scared. Well, he's been before,

397
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:21,440
but now they have this weird nightmare version of him facially, uh, where it's like prosthetics

398
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:25,760
and it looks scary. That was our assessment. And then Jason seems to be like, I love it. I'm kind

399
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:33,440
of into it. I kind of, I mean, like, I think, uh, translating 2d animation to the 3d real world,

400
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:40,880
I kind of like taking a big, weird swing. I think is what appeals to me. It's scary. I mean,

401
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:46,080
I'm not against it being there. It is. I just, it is scary. It looked to me like if they made a,

402
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:51,360
uh, a gritty horror reboot of Sesame street, that's how they would portray Bert.

403
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:58,560
It looks like a horror point. Yeah. Yeah. I'm just, I think I was happy to see Phineas and

404
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:04,320
Ferb get some love. You're always hearing bluey this cocoa melon that you forgot. You are.

405
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:13,360
We've forgotten the roots. You were a Phineas and Ferb guy. I am. Well, cause I, when I went

406
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:19,840
to Disney where I'm like 2012 Perry, the platypus was everywhere. And I'm like, what is this? Who

407
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:25,280
is this guy? But you didn't know what it was until then. Yeah. I didn't know. And I came back. I

408
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:30,080
watched it. I was like, I like this show. It was fun. You got into Phineas and Ferb late. Yeah. A

409
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:35,760
late bloomer with Phineas and Ferb. I've never seen an episode. It's fun. You should see if your

410
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:41,520
daughter likes it. Sure. She likes a lot of stuff. Yeah. She likes bluey. She'd love a madam puppet.

411
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:53,280
She might love madam. Uh, so the, uh, the, the gangs together and now it becomes a, uh, the answering

412
00:36:53,280 --> 00:37:01,760
of Disney trivia off, which, and all this reminded me how terrible I would be at this. Yeah. Once

413
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:07,680
they got to, what's the name of the Raven in Sleeping Beauty? You got me. Yeah. I wouldn't have

414
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:13,520
known. Yeah. Yeah. I do not know. Um, I was proud to not, look, I know a lot of Arcania, but there's

415
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:19,280
gotta be, my, my brain has to not have room for some things. Yeah. And it's not like Disney parks

416
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:23,840
trivia, which we would do better. No, that's all I think. Although I mean, we know some stuff about

417
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:29,600
the movies. It's just that it's like, who is the like old man that owns the big thunder mountain

418
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:34,880
railroad and part of his T bullion? Like that's type of stuff we could, we could get, but yeah.

419
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:40,400
Yeah. But that's not what they're doing here. Name, name, uh, Timon's friend. Um, uh,

420
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:51,280
Ron. What? Ron and Timon. I think it's Ron. I think it's Ron. Um, I, I don't know. I was like,

421
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:56,400
I might be growing on the idea of growing on a cruise, but I'm like, I don't think I'd want to

422
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:03,440
play games. No. Like I don't want to do trivia. I, I'm sure there's a way that you don't have to do

423
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:08,000
that, but if there's that point where like, what is there to do now? And that's one of the things

424
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:13,920
and the other is go sit in your room. I mean, there's bar, there's always bars and for me,

425
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:20,720
there would always be bars. I think it's like, Oh, I don't want to do pirates. No, thank you.

426
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:24,880
Like, yeah, I don't want to dress like a pirate. I want to party with the gorn. I want to see

427
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:31,680
old character actors, like cover bands, and I want to, um, swing with other Star Trek couples,

428
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:40,480
Mike, which is what you do on a Star Trek. That's allowed. Yes. You look for the upside down. It's

429
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:45,840
not a pineapple on that ship. It's like an upside down enterprise, you know? Yeah. Or, uh,

430
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:52,000
Romulan ale bottle that's empty or something. Nice. Nice. Yeah. It sounds like you've already

431
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:58,320
made up your mind. I will. If the Star Trek crews left from California, it would be easier. Where

432
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:01,920
does it leave from? I think it's Florida, the one we talked about at least. Oh yeah. That's

433
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:08,880
well, next year's going to Miami, uh, Belize city. Um, yeah. But you're, wait a minute. You got,

434
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:14,000
you got Mulgrew, you got Frakes. I mean, I'm sure you, I'm sure it's too late at this point. I think

435
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,960
it's too late for this, this round, but yeah. Yeah. Um, all right. We'll start, start making

436
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:25,280
the case for 26. Um, so yeah, well, you actually, you know, we're sort of what you were saying,

437
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:33,120
Jason, about, uh, the, that Phineas and Ferb character that we, it is like weird physicalizing

438
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:39,120
of Hades, especially has kind of a fiddler from Bible man. Oh yeah. Yeah. Oh yeah. It's all like

439
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:46,880
face paint and glopped on prosthetics. And I for one was happy to see characters presented in not

440
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:52,800
such a brand managed kind of way. Yes. Sure. It's kind of strange and cheesy. I don't know if this

441
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:56,960
is the answer either, but I kind of love that they're like, yeah, just put it, I don't know,

442
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:03,280
put some on actors, do it like a play. Yeah. And I, yeah, the only, the only thing is like,

443
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:07,840
I just, yeah, I wish they were live because it would be much more of a fun show. I think we'll

444
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:12,960
get to talking about that. But yes, I, I do like that you can, you felt a little bit less like,

445
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:17,680
oh, they only can only say something from the movie in this in the same way that Deadpool at

446
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:23,280
California adventure has been saying stuff where you go, wow, the, did this get past some people

447
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:29,920
at the part of the company? So yeah, it's been, I can't believe how on board all of us are with

448
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:35,680
this so far. I am honestly a little disappointed because it doesn't seem like they did a ton of

449
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:41,440
Halloween stuff at Avengers campus. Oh, well, I think they should have had Deadpool take over

450
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:45,440
the place. I don't know. Maybe that's coming. I don't know. I guess it's Halloween. Well,

451
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:50,560
we're doing this in the past, so I don't know. We'll see if something has emerged. I know he's

452
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:57,520
more of an anti-hero than a villain, but like Deadpool takes over. That could be a fun daytime

453
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:01,600
thing. Sure. What do you, what do you think he like puts decorations on? What do you mean? What

454
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:07,680
do you think? Oh, some decorations, some fake graffiti. He's going to spray paint Avengers.

455
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:15,040
Yeah. Okay. Well, draw up a for Halloween. Yeah. Draw up a proposal. Like some streamers and like

456
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:20,720
carve pumpkins with the Deadpool symbol in them. So far, Jason is suggesting kind of like a

457
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:28,400
church rec room takeover. Maybe some punch could be there. Like a hell house. Like, oh, that's a

458
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:31,680
deeper thing. You know what? You know what? Here, how about this? And maybe this is sort of what

459
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:37,520
you're after. It would be like Stitch in the magic kingdom. That's exactly it. So he TPs Avengers,

460
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:42,480
like he puts toilet paper all over the Avengers headquarters or whatever the hell it's called

461
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:47,600
or pim test kitchen. He like makes it look like shit is what I'm saying. He paints a sign on the

462
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:53,360
like building. He's like, when is this thing opening? Yeah, sure. Okay. All right. That's,

463
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:57,680
that's a level. Okay. Let me add to this. He dresses up like other characters too. So he's

464
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:02,720
in his Deadpool outfit, but then he has like Loki's helmet on. That's good. He's Loki as well or

465
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:07,440
something. So it's a Halloween takeover. That's good. Yeah. That's not bad. Chains himself to the

466
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:12,960
wall to get red car trolley saved. That's right. Yeah. So we got to talk about that in another

467
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:21,600
episode. I'm upset. We can't do it. So what you end up with here because like it's, it's nine

468
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:27,440
characters who have to be represented and only one is answering and interacting for the most part to

469
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:32,000
all of these answers. You could tell that I was just like, Oh, they had to film like a lot of

470
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:39,360
Lady Tremaine, just like sitting there kind of looking around, not like scratching her nose,

471
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:46,560
but just sitting blinking, just the amount of shooting just for, for there to be nothing in

472
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:51,760
the space. I wonder if it loops at like 10 minutes or something. Yeah, maybe. Probably. I would think.

473
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:56,960
Yeah. Well, there's a lot of resets because one character takes over the whole screen and then

474
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:01,120
get smells that kind of like wipes it. But nonetheless, so much, a lot of, it must've been

475
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:09,280
like a, just a very awkwardly silence shoot. Yeah. Yes, for sure. And then, I don't know, in terms

476
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:17,120
of like any like moments in this or a actors that we liked, is there anything that jumped out?

477
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:22,480
I mean, you can't go wrong with Gaston in general. Oh, I forgot Gaston when I was saying all the names.

478
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:27,600
Right. Like he's just, I, we've talked about, we did an episode on it. I like,

479
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:34,000
I like the different interpretations. It's a fun character to do. And this guy is also pretty fun.

480
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:40,640
So he adds a quote, they forget what they ask him about your five year anniversary. What is an

481
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:45,760
appropriate gift? And they, cause it would be wood. It's the wood anniversary. Apparently we've

482
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:51,440
talked about this recently. We've learned about diamond and platinum in regards to

483
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:56,160
paper. We learned that you made up platinum anniversary entirely. That was never anything

484
00:43:56,160 --> 00:44:00,320
Disney was talking about. Yeah. We didn't really touch on that as much. They never said platinum

485
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:04,640
anniversary. No, but that is the official traditional 70. But that is what it would be called if they

486
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:10,880
were going to call the diamond in the 60 on the 60th in Disneyland. But yeah, he, he answers like

487
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:15,520
with, he's going to give Bell a wooden something with horns on it or whatever.

488
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:21,520
Well, he actually, they say what we do for an anniversary. And I think it's pretty good joke.

489
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:28,800
He says, what is an anniversary? And then there's a pause for like a laugh break. Yeah. You're right.

490
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:34,160
Sorry. Yeah. And it, it, uh, the laugh, like the audience does not react, but I was like,

491
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:38,560
I actually think that's a pretty solid joke. You got to think about, yeah, that he's never had a

492
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:44,560
relationship enough for there to be an anniversary. Right. Well, the jokes said by the people

493
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:51,200
prerecorded don't land. Sure. In this, maybe there was some audience. Yeah. Yeah. The, the

494
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:57,840
hosts jokes and the comments from like the kids will get laughs. Yeah. But the actual video is

495
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:02,880
such an awkward, like it's, it's a combination of the jokes are okay mixed with the timing of it

496
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:08,160
all. Even I think this is well done technically seemingly. Yeah. And even that, even the best

497
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:14,800
version of it is just awkward and laggy. It is impressive. There is about a one or two second

498
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:24,000
pause from like asking the villain. And then you can tell the tech person is triggering an option,

499
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:29,680
but there is a slight pause and that's, it just kind of makes my skin crawl.

500
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:34,640
Yeah. You there and know that this is, oh, come on, don't pause for too long.

501
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:40,320
Yeah. So it's, I had to watch it a couple of times. I'm like, okay, are they in a studio

502
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:49,120
somewhere on the ship? No, I did briefly. I'm like, wait a minute. No, I thought like very polite of

503
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:55,200
you to think that live feeds. I, but then yeah, obviously I'm like, wait, they would have to have

504
00:45:55,200 --> 00:46:01,920
nine different backgrounds, nine different cameras feet. And I'm like, that's ridiculous. And like,

505
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:08,800
I don't think cruise ships, they're not really wasting space on sound stages, you know?

506
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:13,680
So wait, your thought was to make it so they could have different backgrounds. They would have like

507
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:18,640
little rooms elsewhere on the ship and they would be recording it. Well, they would be in one room.

508
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:25,520
Maybe they would have nine different dreams. It quickly fell apart. Okay. Because then why

509
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:29,200
wouldn't they just be out there? Right. Right. That's the question. Well, that's, that was the

510
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:34,160
other thing with the camcorder footage. I was like, is this a set? Cause these are villains that

511
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:42,000
the other thing we were going to mention today are in that show. So I was like, okay, I could see

512
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:48,720
they have the costumes for a show. It would make sense to use the actors here too. But that's a

513
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:54,080
different, that's a different ship, my friend. That's where that falls apart. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

514
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:59,760
This is very trusting, I feel like of Hollywood Magic on Jason's part. Right. Yeah. You're very

515
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:05,600
sweet. I was trying to figure out if I was producing this, what are all the options? It's

516
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:13,520
like, okay, live feed, live actors, prerecorded video options, and someone is triggering them.

517
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:18,080
Yeah. The main concern would be getting the show off at five o'clock so you could be asleep by six.

518
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:24,800
Well, yeah. Well, some of these kids, who knows what time their bedtime is on the ship? Who knows

519
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:28,960
if they've had a nap? Cast a wider net if you, you know, the earlier you do it. You put the kids to bed

520
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:35,040
and then the parents can go to the pirate night, you know? Well, no way they're doing villains night,

521
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:39,040
pirate night on the same night. Come on now. You don't think they split the ship? Half pirates,

522
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:43,680
half villains? No, I think the whole like pirate day takes scenes to take over the whole ship.

523
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:49,600
Okay. I don't know. I'm a Disney wish. You live it up. You go high octane, anything's possible.

524
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:56,720
You know what seems fun to me? You pick one of the ports, you don't get off the ship. So then you have

525
00:47:56,720 --> 00:48:05,040
full rain over all the amenities on the ship. Okay. So I think what he's saying is, you know,

526
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:11,040
sometimes these ships will dock somewhere and you would get off and have a day at an island or

527
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:15,120
something. But you can also stay on the ship. Jason's saying if you stay on the ship that day,

528
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:20,960
instead of going and exploring, you have more, you can run, like, because everybody leaves the ship,

529
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:24,960
he's saying, or a lot of people do. So you will have more room on the ship, I suppose. Well,

530
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:30,560
there's less lines. Less of a line at the buffet that day. Restaurants, buffets, waterslides,

531
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:34,880
you know? Yeah. I guess that's a good strategy. That's fucking miserable though. You're going to

532
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:40,000
not get off. Well, it depends on how long that ship, how long it's the cruises. It depends. I

533
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:45,760
mean, regular cruisers are like, eh, we pulled into Nassau. We've seen Nassau before. We're just

534
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:50,800
going to have a relaxing day on the ship. We've seen the bugs at Castaway Cay or whatever.

535
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:59,440
At Lighthouse Point. Lighthouse Point. At Lookalke. It is so long. I can't remember the name of

536
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:05,040
whatever that is either. Disney opened a new, like, part, it's part of an island. People live

537
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:09,600
on the island. They fixed the bug problem though. Did they fix the bug problem? I think so. Disney

538
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:12,320
opened a new thing and there was a big bug problem. It was a big problem. You remember though,

539
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:16,560
there was like, there was a buffet and like, there was bugs covering the food in the buffet.

540
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:22,880
I think it's Lighthouse Point at Lookalke. It's so long. I will take your word for that.

541
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:27,360
I don't remember. And it was filled with bugs. It was very spread out. You should have stayed

542
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:32,720
on the boat in that situation. Should have stayed on the boat. And gotten on that waterslide faster.

543
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:37,120
Yeah. There's the aqua mouse and then one ship has the aqua duck.

544
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:42,880
Okay. Like aqua duck. And you got that thing to yourself if you don't, if you can see.

545
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:50,880
You want to be so blase about Nassau that you don't, we've seen Nassau. But so, you know,

546
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:56,720
whatever. This thing seems like fine. You passed 20 minutes watching this. They were gearing up

547
00:49:56,720 --> 00:50:00,800
for another round, which was not filmed. And I was like, sounds fine to me. I think one gave me

548
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:06,720
the idea. I said it already, but like, I think this would be so fun if it was nine live performers.

549
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:12,160
Sure. I think this would kill every night versus this where it dies. But I really think the idea

550
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:16,240
is good. And I'm sure at one point they had the idea of just having it be live performers and they

551
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:22,480
were like, yeah, but we can save a lot of money if we pay everybody $200. And that's it. We just

552
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:26,880
have it. Well, I don't, I don't know if there, there may have been something else on the ship

553
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:30,800
with actors. This might've been like, you know, there are the, you know, especially the Disney

554
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:34,720
ships tend to have theaters, but maybe they were like, yeah, we got to figure out something for

555
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:40,240
this big screen. And it's limited if it's like a Halloween specific thing or a limited time thing.

556
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:47,360
This might've been meant to be just a brief thing. But I guess you get more of the fun with the thing

557
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:54,960
that we stumbled into while looking into this, because watch this, this is fine. Then YouTube

558
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:59,360
starts recommending other cruise ship things. And there's some channel and I forget the name,

559
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:06,720
apologies, but there is a channel that has like pro shot versions of tons of the productions on

560
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:11,600
the ships, which might provide future content for us in some way. We might've run into that before

561
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:16,720
with, uh, with Kevin Perch for a long time ago, but what, but that led us to something related.

562
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:22,880
And I would have to say superior. And that is a, another cruise ship show that was performed on

563
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:28,240
the Disney magic and the Disney dream. And this is called villains tonight. Uh, villains tonight

564
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:35,280
is a actual full theatrical production. Uh, that does get all of the villains together. Um,

565
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:38,960
I was going to say not all at once, although, but then the finale, they're all together,

566
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:45,600
but it is this like original story that is, that is a little, that's tied together by Hades,

567
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:50,560
primarily that takes you to see all of the villains and they all perform their iconic

568
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:55,120
villain songs, if not other songs that are fun surprises. You could do that. And that could be

569
00:51:55,120 --> 00:52:00,080
the ride really, if not, they think about it. That's the narrative and they all sing their songs.

570
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:07,200
Hades taking a trip to see if he can fill up the evil ometer. Yeah, pain and panic doing

571
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:12,320
with very much reminded me of like kids in the hall style characters.

572
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:14,000
Hell yeah.

573
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,920
I feel like they're kind of doing like.

574
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:17,360
Are you saying the evil ones?

575
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:19,360
They're just like Simon and Hiccubus.

576
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:22,640
Yeah. I think, yeah, that was one.

577
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:29,200
Yeah. Uh, yeah. Uh, so this, again, we're back to, we're back to a Hades who's like

578
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:35,600
glop ton makeup and funny plastic hair. Uh, again, they've really decided on this particular

579
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:43,280
Hades characterization, which is fun. And I think what we, when I, what I was like,

580
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:49,680
I was just like, let me skim through this and see if this is worth talking about. And I landed,

581
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:52,960
cause I didn't know anything about it. I didn't know what it was. And I didn't know until I landed

582
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:57,840
on a certain point that there was topical comedy involved. And I was just like, is this worth

583
00:52:57,840 --> 00:53:04,880
talking about on the show? Let me just skim here. And I literally landed on Hades saying, uh,

584
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:12,960
I make Hannibal Lecter look like Paula Dean. All right, you're going in, you're in. And this is

585
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:18,000
full context here. He's then once I backed up and I saw the rest of what he's saying,

586
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:22,720
he's trying to prove how evil he is with these topical jokes. And there's a little run of them.

587
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:31,120
One is I make Lord Voldemort look like Hello Kitty, which does you grown at, but I was also like,

588
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:36,400
I could see Trevor Noah making that joke about Trump five years ago.

589
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:42,720
It is on the level. Yeah. That's completely, that would work. That would be in the,

590
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:46,880
that would get a lot. Uh, but then right after that, I make Hannibal Lecter look like Paula

591
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:52,960
Dean. Right. And this really knocked me back for a few reasons. One Trump has been mentioning

592
00:53:52,960 --> 00:54:00,080
Hannibal Lecter nonstop. Right. Uh, so that was weird. Then it's, it, you're watching this joke.

593
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:07,600
I don't know when this was performed, but hearing that in 2024, it's such a riddle because Hannibal

594
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:14,000
Lecter, okay, that's evil. Okay. But Paula Dean, now we know some not very good things about it,

595
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:19,040
which was not true then. So it makes you now have to like, you have to like get out paper and do

596
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:23,760
kind of an SAT analogy thing. Like, so what are they saying? Hannibal Lecter. Okay. But if Paula

597
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:30,000
Dean is bad, so what does, so what does that make Hades look like? He's just somebody who's a racist

598
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:34,480
or somebody specifically, but then Hannibal Lecter was very charming as well. I don't know

599
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:40,160
what he's saying here. Yeah. It's, it's a real riddle. If it was, if that same joke was done with

600
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:44,560
a barefoot Contessa, you would understand. Yeah. Yeah. You would have to change it now.

601
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:49,120
History has made this joke a very strange joke. It's a real weird math problem now. Yeah. Yeah.

602
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:56,480
Uh, I think Jane and I were able to figure out when exactly, like pinpoint when exactly this

603
00:54:56,480 --> 00:55:00,800
was from. I was doing that, that game the whole time. Cause I'm like,

604
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:08,160
I parrot, I, they say that like the new iPad. So when is, I kind of remember, and then there's

605
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:13,280
like a lot of this like Lindsay Lohan stuff somewhere. Okay. I think I sort of, but when,

606
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:20,240
what did you pin it to? So, uh, in the description of the YouTube video, it says it was taped off

607
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:30,800
in room TV in 2015. Oh, but in terms of the actual content, there is a single ladies joke.

608
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:37,920
Oh, that's the biggest data. That's the, that's the tell because he says nice two-year-old reference.

609
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:44,960
Oh, so that means this production is from 2010. Okay. That's what I, yeah. I remember

610
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:50,400
iPad was putting it there for me kind of, because I remember there was a funnier dive

611
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:55,440
video where Pee Wee got an iPad. It was right before I started working there, which is 2010.

612
00:55:55,440 --> 00:56:02,160
That's the, the, the peripheral clues I have to date stamp that specific era sing. Also,

613
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:06,560
a lot of these things we're talking about are all prime California venture genie stuff. Yeah.

614
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:09,920
He did. They were probably like, I wonder if they were like emailing areas back and forth.

615
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:13,600
Maybe. Yeah. Here's the genie and Hades. Hades and the genie. Yeah. Here's what

616
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:18,880
for this one. This has been working at the California adventure show. You should try it.

617
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:25,360
Yeah. Yeah. There's, I mean, in terms of like, yeah, what else we're dealing with, I guess,

618
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:28,880
this is, I mean, the show is fine and the performances are, but like, you know what

619
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:33,760
we're about. We're, we're, I'm just writing down references. Yeah. Like, all right. Hey, welcome

620
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:40,880
everybody. Hey, not quite a Jonas Brothers welcome, but all right. Elsewhere in that I make such and

621
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:47,040
such look like such and such the one after the Paula Dean one is, uh, I make, uh, I'm just going

622
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:52,880
to say Lindsay Lohan and let you guys write your own joke, which is not that then you didn't make

623
00:56:52,880 --> 00:57:01,760
a joke. So I don't know if that counts. I also later, first of all, how dare Disney betray her

624
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:06,320
like that. And now the money that she made them and then Howard make it fun around the cruise ship.

625
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:10,640
And then later, here's one of the biggest mysteries to solve. I don't know if you guys

626
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:16,400
clock this one too. Uh, so Lindsay Lohan's brought up again. She just got me the nicest necklace.

627
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:23,040
Then there's a trickle of laughter. And then he says, now work everybody. Uh, everybody get that.

628
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:29,440
That's going to get it. Okay. Let's, uh, um, which I don't mind that kind of that delivery or

629
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:34,880
construct, but I, I was like, I don't, I don't know. I was, I'm not going to Google it. I'm

630
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:41,680
going to ask if you guys know, do you understand Lindsay Lohan just got Hades the nicest necklace?

631
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:49,120
Did, did she shoplift? Yes. Jane, Jane clock that she remembered the story. Uh, Lindsay Lohan,

632
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:55,760
uh, was stealing at some point. Okay. Got it. Okay. So that's, and how did that play? I wonder

633
00:57:55,760 --> 00:58:02,960
if you were sitting in your room watching this in 2015. Wait, hold on a second. Jason, hold on.

634
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:10,080
Lindsay Lohan is sentenced to jail over necklace stuff. May 12th, 2011. Oh, well, oh, interesting.

635
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:15,280
Well, wait a minute. Well, but when did it happen? When did the, all right, she faced the judge

636
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:22,400
in February, 2011. There's a surveillance tape that was shown by the jeweler. This video,

637
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:27,440
this was on ABC news in March. Hmm. So it seems like it could have happened a year prior. I think

638
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:32,800
this is an early 2011 story is where this is where I'm seeing all of the articles about it.

639
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:39,600
Hmm. Huh. So that could have been more off the cuff. The single ladies, like reference

640
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:47,440
and he could have been referring to the iPad too. Hmm. Like that was the new iPad. And also

641
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:55,200
maybe they were not that specific about any of this stuff. Right. That's also something that

642
00:58:55,200 --> 00:59:00,880
factors in. Yeah. When they said two years, they meant three years. Right. Uh, I also feel like

643
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:05,680
they would just do all the single Hades today still. Yeah, of course. That would work. Yeah,

644
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:12,080
that would work. Yeah. That's an interesting little hmm. Hmm. That, um, there's another moment

645
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:19,600
there. They're talking about villains, like crossover stuff. Hook and Smee and all the crew

646
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:28,400
of their ship saying like, yo ho, a pirate's life for me. Yeah. Uh, but then when Hook steps away,

647
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:35,280
the crew sings a rockin' version and Jane very dryly. Yeah, rockin' version. Like she was falling

648
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:42,160
asleep. She went, that's a Jonas Brothers version from Disney Mania, I think. And like,

649
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:50,960
Ben was dead asleep. So that sounds right. Okay. Uh. So Jonas Brothers did a rock and roll version

650
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:55,520
of yo ho, yo ho, a pirate's life for me. Yeah, I think Disney Mania was like rock and roll versions

651
00:59:55,520 --> 01:00:00,800
of the songs. Okay. Got it. Yeah. And again, I think that's how the Jonas Brothers thought of

652
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:06,640
themselves as a real rock and roll kind of band. Rock and roll band, yeah. They were, yeah. They

653
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:12,000
were like the stray cats, you know. Yeah, that's, you know, we're kind of trying to do a modern

654
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:17,520
stray cats thing. That's kind of our deal. I just got recommended a full stray cats concert on

655
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:24,560
YouTube and I zoomed through it a little bit. This is all right. Within five years, Mike's a big cruise

656
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:30,560
guy and a big stray cats guy. Yeah. And honestly, Scott, I went back to all those old episodes

657
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:34,960
where we talked shit about Setzer and I deleted every bit of that because that was an affront

658
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:39,920
to some of the finest music I ever made. Him keeping the spirit, the rockabilly spirit alive.

659
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:47,120
Yeah. Information warfare in favor of the stray cats. Deleting the past.

660
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:50,800
Delete the past to save the future of rockabilly.

661
01:00:53,360 --> 01:01:03,680
So what else reference wise? Cruella walks on to Yeah, Usher's Yeah. That's definitely more than

662
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:09,760
two years old. Geez, pick up a Shakeweight. There's another good one. Genie for sure,

663
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:14,400
Shakeweight jokes in California. Like there's so many overlaps with that California Adventure

664
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:20,640
show. Shakeweight for sure. There's a joke at some point about like Disney making a sequel

665
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:28,000
that's not directed DVD. Boy, there's a joke from the past. Yeah. Now the now the they're promoting

666
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:34,640
there was going to be a Moana show that got turned into a movie. Yeah. You know, straight to DVDs

667
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:40,960
these days. Yeah. DVDs whatsoever. Yeah. That's why this video is villains tonight is really beyond

668
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:46,160
portals that take you to different parts of the underworld. It's a portal back to, I guess,

669
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:53,360
2011. Right. A time machine. Which also where also there was different connotations to like,

670
01:01:53,360 --> 01:02:00,560
hey, you're fired. Trump can do it. So can I. I do it with better hair. It's just apprentice stuff.

671
01:02:01,120 --> 01:02:08,160
Yeah. It's just apprentice references. Simpler time. Yeah. Yeah. Wait, who does Haiti say that?

672
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:18,000
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Mm hmm. Of course. That's a yeah. Makes sense. Mm hmm. So let's see. Oh,

673
01:02:18,560 --> 01:02:28,000
the show turns into a villain talk show called Hot Talk where Chades hosts Arizona and says,

674
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:33,680
because if evil exists anywhere, it's in daytime talk. I mean, have you seen the view?

675
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:37,920
It's not that that would work. A lot of that. That's the thing with a lot of these, like,

676
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:41,280
I think they would just do for a cruise ship. I think you'd do the same Trump joke because like

677
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:45,040
that's what's Trump is very politicized, but you could still do. I think hair is still okay.

678
01:02:45,040 --> 01:02:50,400
I think he might be a joke. Yeah. Yeah. JD Vance might, uh, you know, the media wants to tell you

679
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:54,400
that this guy's hair is weird. It's not weird. It's not weird. Their hair is weird. Wall's hair

680
01:02:54,400 --> 01:03:01,040
is weird. There's not enough of it. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. And then like a very normal laugh.

681
01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:07,280
JD Vance would be very ha ha ha ha ha. Hello. Ha. I like the show, you know, some singing stuff,

682
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:13,840
you know, it all makes sense. Uh, uh, yeah. Uh, you know, he would end the tyranny of the

683
01:03:13,840 --> 01:03:19,120
searing humor of villains tonight. Uh, but you could still do the same view joke. You'd still

684
01:03:19,120 --> 01:03:23,760
do all the single Hades. Yeah. Yeah. I think Shake Weight's still getting a laugh, even though

685
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:28,960
Shake Weight isn't anything anyone thinks about now. Right. A lot of this stuff is evergreen. I

686
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:34,480
think there has not been a replacement mechanism that's very popular that feels like jerking off

687
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:40,640
unless I'm forgetting one. I don't think there's been any sort of jerking off. What happened to

688
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:48,640
innovation? Where is our nude jerk off simulator that airs on QVC? Yeah. And nothing has caught

689
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:52,800
fire like the Shake Weight. No, no. I mean, there might, there has to be something, but yeah, it's

690
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:58,240
not, it's not penetrated this. So the consciousness of the world, like the Shake Weight. No pun

691
01:03:58,240 --> 01:04:07,040
intended. No pun intended, actually. I did mean it. Oh, you did? Yeah. Um, there's also some back

692
01:04:07,040 --> 01:04:13,280
story. This is some of the, if we're talking about combining villains in this Villain's Land way,

693
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:19,680
you get a little bit of mythology and a little bit of new storytelling, that being that the

694
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:26,720
Snow White Queen and Hades hooked up on Castaway Key. Right. So you get Castaway Key reference,

695
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:34,240
which we like. That's a real obscure Disney, you know, Disney cruise joke. Um, so then that's,

696
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:39,600
that's a little bawdy, you know, for a cruise ship kind of a thing, you know? They don't,

697
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:42,720
you wouldn't think that they would say that on the cruise. They'd have to keep things PG.

698
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:48,320
Yeah. Are you, are you trying to give them credit or are you offended? That's what I understand by

699
01:04:48,320 --> 01:04:53,520
that too. I think in all the times of, and that's a little, you're trying to like, you're dancing on

700
01:04:53,520 --> 01:05:00,000
the line. Yeah. Did they, did they like snorkel together or like stand in the hamburger hot dog

701
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:04,400
line together? Like. You're interested in the non-hookup parts. You're interested in what the

702
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:08,560
rest of the date was. I'm interested in the mechanics of the hookup. Like, unless they got

703
01:05:08,560 --> 01:05:14,000
a private cabana, there's not a ton of privacy on the island, I feel like. I'm going to say this.

704
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:20,000
If they, and I'm going to get a little bawdy here, Mike. Uh oh. If they, if the hooking up involved

705
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:28,160
any going down, I hope Hades was careful about that hair. He's got fire for hair. You've got to

706
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:33,680
be careful with that specific act. Yeah. Can Hades change the temperature of his hair though? I sure

707
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:38,560
hope so. Or this guy's never getting laid. You would assume he could. I mean, it changes color

708
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:44,480
and definitely, I mean, it definitely changes like size and volume of fire, but I hope that he could

709
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:50,640
turn it. Or is it like eternal flame and he can't ever. It's all the same. He dies if you shut it

710
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:56,000
off. So that curses him to never have oral sex. Does she have a level of invulnerability?

711
01:05:56,640 --> 01:06:02,160
The queen? The queen? Yeah. I don't think she's got anything that protects you from having a

712
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:09,840
literal fire crotch. That's not what I meant. That's more of a carnival cruise line joke,

713
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:15,200
fire crotch. Also Hades, he's a villain. He's not maybe such a giving lover. He might not even be

714
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:20,320
interested in doing that. That's true. When you're dealing in villain sex, that's villainous to not,

715
01:06:20,320 --> 01:06:25,120
to not be reciprocal. These are a lot of people who are worried about their own pleasure only.

716
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:30,480
Right. He's selfish. Where does that leave you? Do all the villains just kind of like jerk themselves

717
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:35,520
off and just watch each other? I don't know. This is a whole world of people who might not never

718
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:41,840
like commingle physically. What if Gaston and Lady Tremaine hooked up? What would that look

719
01:06:41,840 --> 01:06:46,720
like? Gaston's not giving, he's very selfish. It'd be beautiful hair wise, that much we know.

720
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:51,680
Certainly if they procreated it, it would be the greatest hair. The child would have great hair.

721
01:06:51,680 --> 01:07:00,080
By the way, I was looking up Drizella image search and there are websites. Drizella nude

722
01:07:00,080 --> 01:07:08,080
image search. AI generator, make real life person hook up with Drizella. Upload Jason Sheridan

723
01:07:08,080 --> 01:07:15,840
photo and make me, make Jason kiss Drizella. But like on the Disney Wiki, she is listed as Drizella

724
01:07:15,840 --> 01:07:22,240
Tremaine, which yeah, I guess that would be her last name if Lady Tremaine is her mother. Drizella

725
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:30,640
Sheridan. Draw it on a notebook. A notebook for a high school class. Drizella Sheridan. XO, XO.

726
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:36,000
Why do you think Drizella as opposed to Anastasia? What's that? I don't know. For Jason you mean?

727
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:39,760
Yeah, if you're looking at the two, what makes you pick Drizella? The name? I think you like

728
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:47,360
the name better, right? I think I like the name. Yeah. Well Anastasia, was the other one named

729
01:07:47,360 --> 01:07:53,120
Anastasia? I believe so. Well that just makes me think of the other animated film. Well that's

730
01:07:53,120 --> 01:07:59,280
hardly her fault. That came years after the fact. She didn't ask for that. I think maybe I have to

731
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:05,440
give Anastasia some attention after that comment. Scott is an Anastasia guy and Jason's a Drizella

732
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:16,960
guy. AI prompt. Scott or Anastasia Gairdner. XO, XO. Hart on notebook. High school notebook.

733
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:26,400
The only thing going in that notebook besides notes is the Stussy S, okay? The what? That you

734
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:33,040
draw the three line, you connect the S. Oh, that's what that's called? I thought it was called. Well

735
01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:37,120
there's a big discussion about whether you call because I've run into people who call that the

736
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:43,360
cool S, not the Stussy S. Well it is definitely the cool S. I see it as cool S on Wikipedia,

737
01:08:43,360 --> 01:08:49,280
but it can be called. At some point I was taught that cool S is the proper, that technically it's

738
01:08:49,280 --> 01:08:54,720
not the logo of Stussy. Although even though growing up I exclusively called it. Stussy actually,

739
01:08:54,720 --> 01:09:01,120
the logo is like handwritten. It says cool S, universal S, Stussy S, the super S, the pointy S,

740
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:08,480
the banksy S, the surfer's S, and the graffiti S. Wikipedia has all those names listed. I mean

741
01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:14,800
they all seem apropos. So I guess you can call it a lot of different things. I'm glad, I'm actually

742
01:09:14,800 --> 01:09:18,720
glad that you consider Stussy in the running because I feel like people have said that's not

743
01:09:18,720 --> 01:09:24,720
a fair thing to call it, but look it's in the, you could see why the mix-up would occur. Yeah,

744
01:09:24,720 --> 01:09:30,560
of course. It's in the zeitgeist. It's in the ether. Yeah, in dealing with cool S's.

745
01:09:31,280 --> 01:09:39,520
It's in the zeitgeist, yeah. Anyways, what else do we not say? Well I like, I will say like yeah,

746
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:44,800
this production itself looks like it has some money involved. There's different backdrops,

747
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:50,320
there's different, like the costumes are pretty good. Well I think there were probably high caliber

748
01:09:50,320 --> 01:09:56,480
Broadway level productions on many of these ships and maybe it's our duty to check them out now.

749
01:09:56,480 --> 01:10:01,920
Actually I would pose to the listener what are interesting ones of these that we need to

750
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:07,360
pursue because clearly a lot are on this one particular channel. The Ursula tentacles are

751
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:12,800
awesome. I mean I know the front ones are probably just string, but somehow the

752
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:18,880
back tentacles, she turns around and those are moving too and I'm like how is she triggering

753
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:24,800
those? Yeah. That's cool. So I wish the budget of the Hollywood Square show was this, like at this

754
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:29,840
level because I think that would have improved the show. I think that would have made that show a lot

755
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:36,160
better. Well no regrets because one led us to the other. That's true. You know, the villain's game

756
01:10:36,160 --> 01:10:43,440
night was the path to lead us to this and to further you down the path of being a cruise person. Do we

757
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:50,560
say Project Cruel was a show sort of they did in the show? We have not talked about Project Cruel.

758
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:56,480
Yeah I think it's like Project Runway is the idea. Oh okay. Yes there were Project Runways.

759
01:10:56,480 --> 01:11:03,200
Is that a Cruella De Vil kind of stuff? Yes. She changed his outfits. Yes. So yeah that's another

760
01:11:03,200 --> 01:11:08,640
topical and again they have the like logo. They made a logo for Project Cruel and they did a whole

761
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:14,400
thing but this is and I've said this before and I don't want the eventual Villain's Land e-ticket

762
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:20,720
to be this. That's not my pitch for it but this is the only area where you will now get some sort

763
01:11:20,720 --> 01:11:27,840
of original story. Going forward everything has to be IP. Everything has to be like kind of a book

764
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:34,880
report of a movie but the only way we get to have any fun now is if you mash up existing characters

765
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:38,720
into certain lands. So I feel like the villains could the Villain's Land be the last?

766
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:44,000
This is our last chance. A last sort of like oh it's a kind of a surprising like narrative.

767
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:48,560
I mean I guess Avengers will see that's a new story at least. So if these if they don't if we

768
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:54,480
don't do a topical parody show a late topical parody show with all the villains like for example

769
01:11:54,480 --> 01:12:02,880
they all vacation at the same evil resort the Black Lotus. Right. If they don't do the live stage

770
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:12,400
parody the Black Lotus. Yeah. It's a sexy getaway that provides ample hookup opportunities but also

771
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:17,520
betrayal opportunities. Right. If there's not this in the park then what do we get? Right it's and

772
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:22,720
it's because you look at everything else Zootopia, Tangled, Frozen, Pan all that stuff is like all

773
01:12:22,720 --> 01:12:27,040
the characters from those movies are in the ride and I'm sure. Book report ride. Book report ride

774
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:31,920
but you're not going to get like a little surprise like this is the only zone I feel like left where

775
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:36,560
you can get little little surprises. We take what we can get now because there's just will never be

776
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:42,640
in a completely original ride or land ever again. The thing I've been thinking about and like looking

777
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:49,600
into is that a lot of these after hours the after hours parties I haven't really gone to

778
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:53,040
but the more and more I read about them. You mean like Oogie Boogie Bash at Disneyland. Like Oogie

779
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:59,600
Boogie Bash. Yeah. Or like so like. After hours parties. You threw me off for a second. That is

780
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:04,240
what they call it. Yeah which after hours parties. Which after hours party are you going to? But like

781
01:13:05,120 --> 01:13:11,200
the like you went to a flashback one. Yeah the 80s one. Like an 80s night. Yeah. So

782
01:13:12,240 --> 01:13:17,760
that is where I think stuff is getting interesting. There's like unique characters

783
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:24,320
wait times are a lot shorter. There's an Oogie Boogie Bash obviously there's free candy. Well

784
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:28,640
there's street trails. There's street trails. There's a villains parade. Let's say there's

785
01:13:28,640 --> 01:13:35,600
horsemen. There's free candy for how much admission? What 180 dollars? Yeah 100 bucks or something.

786
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:40,960
More 100 bucks. Free candy but. But. It's in the cost of the ticket. So that's what he would be

787
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:47,520
saying. It's really the best value. You're not finding a better way to get candy for cheap.

788
01:13:48,160 --> 01:13:52,560
And if you really. Going to Anaheim booking a ticket five months in advance. And you spend your

789
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:57,760
whole time doing tree trails. Yeah you spend and I saw someone go like all right I filled up my

790
01:13:57,760 --> 01:14:03,360
bag but I have an empty backpack. So I'm dumping the candy there and filling the bag again. And

791
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:07,680
that's just good sense. We got to get you next year. We got to go next year. We got to see how

792
01:14:07,680 --> 01:14:12,640
much treats how many treats you can get. I am set on going next year. All right good yeah. But what

793
01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:21,200
my main point is like wait this the interesting stuff at the parks might be isolated at these

794
01:14:21,200 --> 01:14:27,360
after hour parties. Like extra characters. Yeah when we say interesting we mean Judge Doom will

795
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:32,080
be there or something. Yeah Judge Doom will be there. And I agree I agree with you. It's just

796
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:36,560
putting it in context of what I'm talking about. There might be that you know that's where you get

797
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:42,480
yeah Judge Doom doing a dance to a three-year-old Doja Cat song. Right yeah. That's what we mean

798
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:50,480
by interesting. But a lot of what has been siloed at the after hours parties it's like they should

799
01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:58,080
be doing this every day at the park. This should be default park experience. It would be nice if

800
01:14:58,080 --> 01:15:06,160
you could see Max in his power line outfit. Yes. At the regular day time. Max in his power line

801
01:15:06,160 --> 01:15:11,680
outfit like. It's funny these are the stakes of what. You guys have both been doing political

802
01:15:11,680 --> 01:15:17,040
you've both been like pounding the sides of your and I say this you're pointing and like hitting

803
01:15:17,040 --> 01:15:23,680
the chair you know in a debate fashion and all this is in service of Max and his power line outfit.

804
01:15:23,680 --> 01:15:29,760
Yes. Well we want look we want we want innovation. We want interesting surprises when we go to these

805
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:35,840
parks. We don't want just your your standard big six characters. We want to see fun around every

806
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:44,160
corner and for us that means seeing the great mouse detective in a place where you would normally

807
01:15:44,160 --> 01:15:50,720
only see Mickey. I don't know. I I might be stressed out by big great mouse detective. What.

808
01:15:50,720 --> 01:15:55,840
You say that. Like it's like six feet tall. He's not going to be tiny. Yeah I know. You'll be

809
01:15:55,840 --> 01:16:02,000
stressed out by him. I just it might be like the big muppets. Like. Oh it wouldn't be like the big

810
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:09,600
muppets. Wait a minute. Jason the entire history of Disneyland is centered around a mouse character

811
01:16:09,680 --> 01:16:15,680
made big. Why is this a new premise. He's a cipher. Mickey Mouse can be anything. But there's

812
01:16:15,680 --> 01:16:20,640
plenty of other mice. There's so there's the Cinderella mice. There's ample examples of big

813
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:26,160
mice in the park. And you draw the line now at great mouse detective. It might be big. I don't

814
01:16:26,160 --> 01:16:32,560
know. Big Beasel might stress. I don't know. Would you be mad if the aristocats have suits

815
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:38,400
and they're much bigger than normal cats. I think I've been trying. I think that's been around long

816
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:44,960
enough. It's that it's new. What. You have to have been. You have to have known about something.

817
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:50,400
I have to have been acclimated. Yeah. There's got to be a great mouse detective walk around

818
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:55,040
suit somewhere. Somewhere. Yeah I would think. But you creeped out by the idea of it. I don't

819
01:16:55,040 --> 01:17:00,800
know. I'd have to give it some thought. Well OK. Yeah you think sleep on it I guess. But still.

820
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:11,040
Jason Jason has a bag full of free very efficiently gotten tootsie pops and he he comes

821
01:17:11,040 --> 01:17:21,040
and he comes. I don't. You just said Basil not Basil. Fuck off. I hate. We're not so different.

822
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:27,760
It's got to you if you need to remember it's to to tootsie. Goodbye. That's a good way to remember.

823
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:33,600
Yeah. You guys are right. Tootsie is a world of death. What is he even saying.

824
01:17:34,240 --> 01:17:39,520
Language is Scott even speaking right now. Did you go into German for a second. Tootsie is cute

825
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:46,880
though. All right. Well here I'll change it to Twizzlers motherfuckers. You've found a corner

826
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:54,640
with a bag full of Twizzlers. You see a slightly tall great mouse detective throw the bag and go

827
01:17:54,640 --> 01:18:02,720
running. Yeah. That's right. He's a good guy. A big rat again would I think I'd be more OK with

828
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:10,160
because he's mean and scary. But he's little too. He's also little. It doesn't. But he's big. But

829
01:18:10,160 --> 01:18:15,120
he's bigger than the rest of them. I don't understand what you're saying. I don't get it.

830
01:18:15,120 --> 01:18:21,760
But I believe I believe in your heart. You are afraid of it. So I will respect your

831
01:18:21,760 --> 01:18:26,640
feelings even though I don't understand them. Let me just say that. I'm trying to understand

832
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:32,800
them myself. Well the next time you're talking to a therapist maybe this is what you focus on

833
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:38,720
to try to figure it out. Just a just a billable hour. Are you OK with Big Fievel.

834
01:18:40,720 --> 01:18:46,160
That was really weird. Well I met Big Fievel. We've showed the picture of me meeting Big Fievel.

835
01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:52,880
You seemed fine with it. Yeah I'm OK with that. OK. So therapy session. I guess you know what I

836
01:18:52,880 --> 01:19:00,720
think I'm ready to get into is I have a thing about big mouse costumes that are new. If I grew

837
01:19:00,720 --> 01:19:07,520
up with it I'm fine with it. But if there was a new one hypothetically I it's it's my biggest fear.

838
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:13,360
Yeah. So you saw a great mouse. No I thought about seeing a great mouse detective. And it sent me

839
01:19:13,360 --> 01:19:20,560
into a spiral. I think because a lot of the shots in the movie emphasize that they are little

840
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:28,560
and London is happening around. I still I I know I understood the word you said. It still doesn't

841
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:34,480
quite make sense to me. But I I again I respect what you're saying. But I would like to I would

842
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:43,200
like to see a big mouse detective. Basil. His name is Basil. Excuse me. Yeah. Basil. Basil. All

843
01:19:43,200 --> 01:19:49,920
right. Did we talk about what I forget. Did we talk about the right topics today. I believe we

844
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:55,040
did as far as I know. OK I think we did. I think if you were doing a checklist then we covered

845
01:19:55,040 --> 01:20:01,040
everything on the check. Mike's a cruise guy. I'm going to be a cruise guy eventually. I have a lot

846
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:08,720
of weird boundaries about character size. Deadpool should take over Avengers campus at Halloween.

847
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:19,680
And Drizella should take over you sexually. Look I don't want to speak out of turn but I will let

848
01:20:19,680 --> 01:20:26,320
Drizella ruin my life. I've been saying Druzella I think since Drizella. It's more like Drizella.

849
01:20:26,320 --> 01:20:30,480
We've all been saying everything weird and wrong. That's what we're finding. And that

850
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:36,560
podcasting folks. There's a lot of characters we don't know. We know Barnabas T. Bullion.

851
01:20:36,560 --> 01:20:41,200
We don't know Drizella. Drizella. We don't know. That's the difference. It's the ride versus the

852
01:20:41,200 --> 01:20:47,680
movies. We're ride guys. We're the ride guys. No we're not the ride guys. That's an official

853
01:20:47,680 --> 01:20:51,680
universal. That's an official universal thing. Yeah and it pisses me off. We are the ride guys.

854
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:57,600
Those guys aren't the ride guys. No they're not. No. And that's when if we said this on air what

855
01:20:57,600 --> 01:21:03,200
Tony Baxter called us the ride guys once. And if he says it. Because I think people are still

856
01:21:03,200 --> 01:21:08,400
confused by podcast the ride. I think that's still a confusing title for people. Every once in a while

857
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:13,600
yes. There's still confusion about it. Why do they write podcasts here? There's not confusion

858
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:18,560
if you're listening because that means that you survived well what in this case is haunt cast the

859
01:21:18,560 --> 01:21:23,360
fright. Oh yeah. The cemetery gate. If you want to grave dig even deeper join us on our

860
01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:29,040
RIP tier crypt three where you get one more boonus episode for just three more bones a month. That

861
01:21:29,040 --> 01:21:37,280
one was on purpose guys. I know. I said boonus not as a mistake. Are we good? Yeah I think we're fine.

862
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:39,520
You were good.
