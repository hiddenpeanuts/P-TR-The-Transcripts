1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,840
Forever.

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:03,680
Dog.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,500
["Fruit of the Night"]

4
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:10,500
Warning, the following podcast contains

5
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,920
benign red pigmentation of stool,

6
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:16,580
discussion of actor Peter Lurie,

7
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,240
and multiple spellings of the word fruit.

8
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,380
Mike Scollins joins us to discuss

9
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:27,160
General Mills' monster series on Haunt Casts the Fright.

10
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:30,540
["Fruit of the Night"]

11
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,040
Welcome to Haunt Casts the Fright,

12
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:54,000
a haunt cast about scream parks,

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,760
or in today's case, serial killers.

14
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:01,640
I'm Scott Grave Digner, joined by Jason Skeleton.

15
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,440
That was very slick.

16
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,440
Serial killers didn't occur to me until I heard you say it.

17
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,320
You know, and it's a joke that would work

18
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,520
for a mom or a child.

19
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,040
That's for everyone.

20
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,400
Yes.

21
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,680
Except for mentioning killing,

22
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,600
which I guess isn't good for children.

23
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,760
Anyway, also joining us is,

24
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:25,480
this is a new development off of the second gate

25
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:28,360
where we brainstormed a little more on the spooky names.

26
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,480
Let's just, all right, I'll just lay this in.

27
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:34,920
Michael Madsen is where, okay.

28
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,480
We're comfortable with that?

29
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,760
Yeah, I'm here and I'm, I think, you know,

30
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:41,480
here's what I think, I was thinking about this for days,

31
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,600
maybe two or three days.

32
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,440
I was thinking about it.

33
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:47,200
I think the way it should be sold is like Michael Madsen,

34
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,280
you know, like mad in a crazy way, not angry,

35
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,120
because I think it could be misinterpreted pretty easily.

36
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:56,120
And I wanna make sure it's more like a mad scientist

37
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:59,720
than it is like somebody just generally mad,

38
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,040
like a sports fan is mad that his team lost.

39
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,280
That's not what I am in Halloween season.

40
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,880
But that's the issue, not the confusion.

41
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,640
You like that it's the actor's name.

42
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,120
That's good.

43
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,040
We like that. I love that.

44
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,600
But you wanna make sure that we know

45
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,760
that the mad is a mad scientist mad.

46
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,840
Exactly, yeah.

47
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,600
Okay, so that's where we've landed.

48
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,440
Let us know what you think of Michael Madsen.

49
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,840
And today we are talking about the monster cereals.

50
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,080
These are from General Mills.

51
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:37,600
This is a frightening brand that has,

52
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,240
I think it's a very good choice for us

53
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,120
who are kind of scaredy cats,

54
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,120
because these are soft scary characters

55
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:47,000
who themselves are scaredy cats.

56
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,360
Like that's sort of the thing with them.

57
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,480
They are monsters.

58
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,440
That's how they were characterized.

59
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,520
They're monsters who are scared a little bit.

60
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:57,040
So appropriate for us, I feel.

61
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,960
Count Chocula, of course.

62
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,080
Frankenberry, these are the big stars.

63
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,600
And this topic comes to us courtesy of a person

64
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,720
we were just meeting for the first time,

65
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,120
whom I'm so happy is here.

66
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,320
I love when a funny person outs themself

67
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:12,600
as being into the bullshit that we are into.

68
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:16,200
A visiting from New York, from Late Night with Seth Meyers.

69
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,320
It's Mike Scollins.

70
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,160
Hi. Hey.

71
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,200
Thanks for having me.

72
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:20,880
Absolutely.

73
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:24,520
Oh wait, I was gonna say Mike Scaldings, maybe.

74
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:28,360
I wanna say the real name and then throw one at ya.

75
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,200
The spooky one.

76
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,680
Scollins is probably the easiest.

77
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,800
Scollins, wait a minute, of course.

78
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,760
Okay, because it keeps more of the real.

79
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:37,520
I had the skull is coming from inside the house.

80
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,800
That's great, that's great.

81
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,200
Okay, okay, love it.

82
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,320
Now with that, now we've already given you

83
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:48,200
several introductions due to the spooky names,

84
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,800
but I'm gonna back it up.

85
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,120
I wanted to do the one where we said

86
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,520
your comedy credit, the show that you write for,

87
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,760
but now I'm gonna do one, I'm gonna do a different intro

88
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,440
that is maybe super relevant to our audience,

89
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,680
and that is please welcome our guest today,

90
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,600
a guy who used to run the Six Flags Twitter account.

91
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,080
Mike Scallins, let's go with,

92
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,360
or a call is coming from inside the house.

93
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,440
Yes, are you willing to discuss this?

94
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,760
I am willing, I'm willing to.

95
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,560
I think all the NDAs have expired.

96
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,160
Okay. I think I can talk about

97
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,000
Six Flags Twitter account.

98
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,280
You're not gonna get a visit from Mr. Six

99
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,280
looking pissed off.

100
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,960
I may well, who I've seen out of makeup in, handsome guy.

101
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,240
Oh. Oh, that's right.

102
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,120
That's the idea, you saw the real actor

103
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:31,040
who was like a, there's photos of him out there.

104
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,320
He's a buff gentleman, strangely.

105
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,680
Well, he's like a proper dancer.

106
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,560
I mean, it's a lot easier to make a dancer look old

107
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,280
than make an old person look like a good dancer.

108
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:43,280
Oh yes, to inject life into a extremely 100 year old.

109
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,520
I don't know how old he is canonically,

110
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:49,600
but this is, when abouts did this happen

111
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,040
and how did this happen?

112
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:57,200
I needed a day job in 2012, 13 maybe.

113
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,480
I was there for like a year and a half, two years.

114
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,320
Okay.

115
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,280
I'm sure you guys know that the headquarters is in Dallas.

116
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,000
I don't think, I don't know if I did know that offhand.

117
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,720
There was a small satellite office in New York

118
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,160
that I worked out of, but barely,

119
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,200
because all my bosses were in Dallas,

120
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,920
so they didn't really like keep tabs on me.

121
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,840
And it was also Twitter was like,

122
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:19,880
kind of still new at this point.

123
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,400
They wanted a social media expert,

124
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,760
but at that point one didn't exist.

125
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,040
Just by saying you got a Twitter account,

126
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,040
you kind of were one.

127
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,520
Sure.

128
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,760
And I remember they would ask for metrics and reporting,

129
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,520
and I'd be like, oh, it's such new technology.

130
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,960
That stuff doesn't really exist.

131
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,280
Yeah.

132
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,640
As long as your followers are going up,

133
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,800
you're doing a good job.

134
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,440
And I knew that this was a job an intern should be doing,

135
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,920
so I'm just gonna ride until the wheels fall off

136
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,080
and I get let go.

137
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,240
I would use all of their office supplies

138
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,400
to print everyone's mod sketches at UCB.

139
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,640
Oh, wow, great.

140
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:54,360
I would tweet maybe three times a day,

141
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,680
and they would ask why are you tweeting so little?

142
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:59,920
And I'd be like, oh, it's really alienating to the consumer

143
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,840
because it's their space, not ours.

144
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,920
And they were like, oh no, that makes sense.

145
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,560
That makes perfect sense.

146
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,680
And they were fully on board with it.

147
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,600
As far as daily jobs goes,

148
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,320
it was one of the best ones I've ever had.

149
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,160
Jeez.

150
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,400
And incredible perks.

151
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,000
What'd you get, what are perks?

152
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,520
Took my whole 13 person mod team to Six Flags,

153
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,600
bracelets that you go right up the exit line.

154
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,080
It was a blast.

155
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,000
You were the guy to get on a mod team with clearly.

156
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:25,840
Yeah, I mean.

157
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,840
There's a high roller here.

158
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,080
Six Flags Great Adventure,

159
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,400
which is the one closest to New York,

160
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,200
also has a safari.

161
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,360
Oh yeah. Oh yeah.

162
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,000
And they let me go and feed the tigers

163
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,160
and pet the dolphins.

164
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,480
It was.

165
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,840
You got closer animal access.

166
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,680
Yeah, it was.

167
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,680
Because I tweeted four times a day,

168
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,400
just like who's going to the park?

169
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,240
Not even.

170
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,640
Oh yeah, that's a good question.

171
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,560
Wait, Mike, did you have a question?

172
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,760
I was just gonna say,

173
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,440
is the wristband,

174
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,640
if you buy a wristband at that park,

175
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:59,080
can you go up and pet animals or touch them?

176
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:02,400
Or was that just sort of like a teen was like right this way?

177
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,040
This, these are,

178
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,720
these bracelets are only for internal use.

179
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,880
So you can't buy them.

180
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,480
But if like an investor's come to the park,

181
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,960
they'll like give you two.

182
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,640
And I was like, well, I need 13.

183
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,600
But like.

184
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,720
Well, you gotta take the coach.

185
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,840
You can't leave the coach.

186
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,680
And he did come.

187
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,520
Yeah.

188
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,360
He came and he had a blast.

189
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,640
Yeah, the director has to come too.

190
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,200
And let's just say I had some sketches

191
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,360
in the show that month.

192
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,360
Smart.

193
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,480
Wait, yeah.

194
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,920
Then you gave me the question of like,

195
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,920
you kind of previewed it,

196
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,200
but like what was that?

197
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,720
A general tweet might be like,

198
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,640
who's ready for roller coasters?

199
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,720
Basically what it was.

200
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,000
And then like every once in a while,

201
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,280
I would like,

202
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,040
I'd get like a customer service question

203
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:44,880
that I would answer like,

204
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,520
all right, the park closes at eight.

205
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,360
Yeah.

206
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,400
Or whatever time Six Flags closes.

207
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:52,760
Yes, we are very sorry that Kingda Ka is shut down again.

208
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:56,160
No car has made it up that hill.

209
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,000
And I would just.

210
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,840
Yeah.

211
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,080
Pack my briefcase and go home.

212
00:07:59,080 --> 00:07:59,920
Job well done.

213
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,200
Wow, an empty briefcase.

214
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,120
It's full of good, right?

215
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,840
Packets.

216
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,680
Must be a lot of analytics in there.

217
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,000
Also you wouldn't have this gig.

218
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,120
That is so fascinating.

219
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,880
Well, that's some amazing theme park cred.

220
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,960
And also you're here kind of on,

221
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:18,800
personally for work,

222
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,640
but you're also doing,

223
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:22,080
you've been traversing the country,

224
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,760
checking out the haunt season.

225
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:27,640
You've done a bunch in Florida as well, correct?

226
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,480
Favorite time of the year.

227
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,320
I mean, like you said,

228
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,640
I'm here like partially for work,

229
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,480
but it was planned around.

230
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,280
I wanna go to Halloween Horror Nights.

231
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,000
I did not scary farm on Saturday.

232
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,360
Okay.

233
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:40,880
And then the beginning of the month of September

234
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,640
went down to Orlando to do,

235
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,000
we did Disney and we did Halloween Horror Nights.

236
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,160
I had never been to the Orlando park before

237
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,640
for Halloween Horror Nights.

238
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,840
Hadn't even been to Florida in like 15 years

239
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,800
and forgot how big it is.

240
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,640
Oh yeah.

241
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,080
I mean, I go to the one,

242
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,120
the Hollywood Horror Nights every year

243
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,880
and forgot comparatively the Orlando park is just huge.

244
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:01,720
Yeah, yeah.

245
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:05,720
It's a giant camp like rivaling Disney World at this point.

246
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,800
If not in physical space,

247
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,480
then like stuff to do.

248
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,600
How'd you dig it?

249
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,420
I don't think we've, you know,

250
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:12,280
we haven't made it down there.

251
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,960
We don't know what's going on for Halloween right now.

252
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:15,960
How was it?

253
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,920
Dug it quite a bit.

254
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:21,920
We, the Orlando and the Hollywood parks

255
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,560
usually double up mazes a lot and houses a lot.

256
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,720
And this year they haven't really.

257
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,520
There was one down there,

258
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:31,800
Dead Man's Pier that I thought was just fucking awesome.

259
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,860
It's like kind of based on the fog.

260
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:37,020
And like, I know you did last summer a little bit

261
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:38,980
because the fisherman with the hook,

262
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:40,780
but takes place in New England, which is where I'm from.

263
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,420
And I was just like all about it.

264
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:43,260
Wow. Wow.

265
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:45,980
We did, we got the flash passes, went through,

266
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:47,740
and then my buddy Kevin and I also like went through

267
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:49,780
the standby line and did it again.

268
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:50,620
Okay.

269
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:51,620
Sweet, sweet.

270
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:56,340
Wait, so like spooky fog then scary?

271
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:57,540
Yeah, it was not like,

272
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,140
it wasn't the scariest house they had,

273
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,860
but just like the atmosphere and the mood was so great.

274
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:02,700
Oh sure.

275
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:03,540
Yeah, yeah.

276
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:09,300
A lot of barnacles on dead bloated corpses,

277
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:11,820
beautiful shit props.

278
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,220
The biggest set piece was like this lighthouse

279
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:16,460
that everything was kind of like built all around.

280
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:18,180
And it had like different tiers.

281
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:20,140
So there was like perspective and depth

282
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:23,540
that you don't always get at a lot of haunted houses.

283
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,340
And I was just like fully on board for.

284
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:26,860
Oh, like a multiple level?

285
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,700
Yeah, yeah.

286
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:29,780
So like the lighthouse,

287
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:32,620
you were always, it was always a focal point

288
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:35,140
in the horizon no matter where in the park you were

289
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:36,620
or where in the house you were actually.

290
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:37,460
Wow, that's cool.

291
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:40,100
They have a Wolfman Dracula mummy,

292
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:42,420
like versus maze down there.

293
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:44,300
Is that one not at Hollywood?

294
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,180
They have it, but it looks like it's different.

295
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:48,860
Like, because when I did it out here, I don't know,

296
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:50,140
maybe your experience was different

297
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:51,540
because sometimes like the scare actors

298
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:52,540
will maybe be on a break.

299
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:55,420
So you miss an important element of the maze.

300
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:59,100
But when I watched a walkthrough of it in Orlando,

301
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,860
they always had like a very clear winner

302
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,780
that would apparently change at the end

303
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:04,940
of among the three monsters.

304
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:07,300
Oh man, if that happened, I missed that.

305
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,060
Okay, because like at the end it was like,

306
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:12,580
mummy's holding up like Wolfman's head, mummy wins.

307
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:14,540
And apparently they rotate through winners,

308
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:15,660
which I thought was awesome.

309
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:17,700
So when I went to Hollywood, I was like, here we go,

310
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,100
let's see which monster wins.

311
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,620
And then we got to the end and it was like,

312
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:22,540
just nobody was there.

313
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:24,540
And I was like, is this cause of Hollywood

314
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:26,780
or is this cause somebody's on break

315
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:29,380
or just for the work?

316
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:32,660
I did watch them like cycle out scare actors

317
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:35,460
and the standby line gives them like a real like,

318
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:36,900
when we used to like bang pots and pans

319
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,540
for first responders, that's what these,

320
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:40,660
that's the reception these guys got when they were like

321
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:42,740
leaving to go on a 15 minute break.

322
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:44,020
Yeah. Yeah, these are the heroes.

323
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:44,860
Yeah.

324
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:45,700
And correct me if I'm wrong,

325
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,940
are they usually covered in like black hoods

326
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,620
or like cloaks? Yes, yes.

327
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:51,740
It looks like a funeral procession.

328
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:54,540
They really try to like keep the mystery

329
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:56,620
so that you're not like watching Wolfman

330
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:57,820
take his 10 minute break.

331
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:59,780
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

332
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:01,700
Which is I guess good,

333
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:04,980
but then you suddenly are noticing like 20 people

334
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:06,220
in all black.

335
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,060
Yeah. Walking by.

336
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,380
If you don't know, it like raises more questions.

337
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:10,220
Yeah. Scary.

338
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:11,060
Yeah. Yeah.

339
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:11,900
But that's good.

340
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:12,740
It's like Mark of Thorn.

341
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:13,580
That's what you want.

342
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:14,400
Yeah.

343
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,500
I mean, we did one year were backstage at not scary farm

344
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,380
and it was very funny just to see like

345
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:22,300
a ghoul taking a lunch break.

346
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:25,260
Like a ghoul eating leftover spaghetti.

347
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:27,580
So they put less thought into

348
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:30,740
we were allowed access to see like the real.

349
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:31,580
Oh, like a media.

350
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:33,260
They let us see. Got it.

351
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:34,980
Like I came out of the bathroom

352
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:37,820
and was startled by like a headless creature.

353
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,420
I was like, oh, excuse me.

354
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:42,620
I did not on Saturday

355
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:44,500
and a decent amount of it was closed down

356
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,320
because of flooding.

357
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,160
It rained a lot on Saturday.

358
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,000
Oh no.

359
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,420
You said in lines.

360
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:49,340
Like you just couldn't.

361
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:50,500
Yeah. We also have flash pass

362
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,740
and they were like flash pass is flooded.

363
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:52,780
You're gonna have to get in standby line

364
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:53,980
which was like kind of a bummer.

365
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:55,820
Oh wow.

366
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:57,260
The line is, wait, the line,

367
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:58,900
I think the actual pavement is deep,

368
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:01,300
like goes more underground.

369
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:02,140
According to them.

370
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:04,580
And then the, I guess the standby must be uphill

371
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:05,420
or something.

372
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:06,260
Cause that was not flooded.

373
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:09,140
There's stuff like that.

374
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:10,420
Think about like ghost rider.

375
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:13,620
Ghost rider has like a, it goes down.

376
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:15,820
Like there's like a slope to it.

377
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,420
So maybe they, it's not a totally even park.

378
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:20,660
Usually the lines are just like next to each other.

379
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:21,820
Oh, this was not the line.

380
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,120
The lines were around the corner from each other

381
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,140
but I don't, I guess I don't get the benefit

382
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:26,260
to lying to me.

383
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:28,420
Yeah.

384
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:29,260
It's true.

385
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:31,260
Although like, don't you find in just real life,

386
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:33,180
especially in retail, and I don't blame people,

387
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:35,940
you get lied to constantly and you know you're being lied to

388
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,180
and you go, yeah, okay.

389
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:39,260
Like somebody, you ask for something in a Target

390
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:41,820
and they go, ah, and they like pretend to check

391
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:42,940
and they go, oh, we don't have it.

392
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:43,780
And I go, okay.

393
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:45,500
And I go, that person has lied to me.

394
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,340
Yeah.

395
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:48,020
Do you feel that happens a lot?

396
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:48,860
Yes.

397
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:52,020
And I guess I am like too conflict averse to call them on.

398
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:54,620
Like you didn't go in before it.

399
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:56,420
McDonald's, they say, you know, the ice cream machine.

400
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:57,940
The ice cream machine's broken, yeah.

401
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:58,780
Yeah.

402
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:01,700
Carlson, what toy were you after that you didn't get

403
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,820
that made you mad at the Target?

404
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:04,900
It looks like Boo Berry.

405
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:06,740
Oh, it happened, I do have a, the toy,

406
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:08,660
it is a toy story about the Target, yes.

407
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:09,500
So, okay.

408
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:12,040
So I'm driving to Glendale's Target.

409
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:15,940
I'm trying to pick up the Ninja Turtle punk frog set,

410
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:19,960
which is a Napoleon Bonafrog and I think Attila the Frog

411
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,740
was the other one in the two pack.

412
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:25,820
And I call on the way over and I say, oh, do you have this?

413
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:28,660
And I explain what it is and the guy,

414
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:31,540
he's like confused obviously, because he's an adult man

415
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:33,700
and why would he know anything about what I'm talking about?

416
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:36,380
This is a niche product for weird people

417
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:37,620
in their 30s and 40s.

418
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:40,460
And mainly it's people calling to ask like,

419
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:42,060
do you have formula or not?

420
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:43,660
Is that still happening or not?

421
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,580
This was pre-formula shortage I want to-

422
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:48,500
Oh really, okay, this is a long standing story.

423
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,340
Okay.

424
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:52,180
This is before the supply chain issues.

425
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:54,460
And he's like, oh yeah, and he's like, he looks,

426
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:56,580
he goes, oh yeah, we don't have this, so sorry.

427
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:58,540
And I go, okay, all right, thank you.

428
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:01,140
And I pull into the thing, I go up to the section

429
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:03,260
sitting right on the shelf, they have it there.

430
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:05,500
And I go, well, the guy lied to me, but I don't blame him.

431
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,720
I'm not upset with him.

432
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,780
It's a happy ending for you too.

433
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:10,700
Oh yeah, so I was, yeah.

434
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,500
Are those toys behind you somewhere?

435
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,060
You're in front of your toy collection.

436
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:15,180
They are, they are behind me.

437
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,020
Do you want to see them?

438
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:17,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

439
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:19,180
Is it a hassle to get up though?

440
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:20,700
I don't know what, I don't know how many rigs

441
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:21,740
you're connected to.

442
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:24,380
Mike's gonna lie and say we don't have it and stuff.

443
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,620
I love the audio picture this is painting.

444
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:27,580
It's like theater of the mind.

445
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:29,820
We can hear him stepping away from the mic

446
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,220
to find his little guy.

447
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:33,660
Even if you're not watching on the Forever Dog YouTube,

448
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:36,000
now you know kind of the distance from microphone

449
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,460
to turtles, which is not very far.

450
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:39,300
Oh wow.

451
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,120
Here's all four of the brother,

452
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,260
of the punk brother frogs.

453
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:45,340
These are really cool looking, I'm not gonna lie.

454
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:47,580
As much as I'd love to make fun of it,

455
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:50,820
it is like a 2D drawn style made 3D.

456
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,740
These toys rule, Scott.

457
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:53,940
They're really good.

458
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,780
It's hard to deny that even if you go,

459
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:56,780
this guy's out of his mind,

460
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:58,700
you go but they are like really cool looking

461
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:01,620
and the colors are really well chosen.

462
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:02,460
Really vibrant.

463
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:06,220
The style is real like a battle toadsy, right?

464
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:07,100
Yeah, well yeah.

465
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:10,460
These battle toads, I'm trying to think what the timeline is

466
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:13,180
because they had the whole run of like biker mice from Mars,

467
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:15,300
street sharks in the wake of the turtles.

468
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:18,300
But I'm sure there were like,

469
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,780
I'm sure there were animal crossover basically.

470
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:23,800
Like turtles did punk frogs,

471
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,560
but then the toad,

472
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,200
I think there were evil toads on turtles as well,

473
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,040
is what I'm saying.

474
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:30,320
But the battle toads themselves were never there.

475
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,160
But yeah, it's all in the same family.

476
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,840
That's what I'm getting at.

477
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,600
So it is Ninja Turtle universe or not?

478
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,600
Wait, I don't remember what.

479
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,560
Yes, yeah, these four, these guys were in the original.

480
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,760
So I really don't wanna bog this interview down,

481
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:43,600
excuse me.

482
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,880
But these are all in the style of all characters

483
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:50,240
that appeared in the 1987 cartoon.

484
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,060
Okay.

485
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:53,040
So all the ones that look like this

486
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,360
were characters that you saw in that original

487
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:59,240
like seven year run of that Fred Wolf cartoon

488
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,080
with the Chuck Lorre theme song.

489
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,240
Oh yeah.

490
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,360
Do you like the one giving the peace signs the best

491
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:06,680
cause it reminds you of Ringo?

492
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:09,220
Well, Jason, I do like that, but I also say this,

493
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:10,560
they all come with a lot of hands,

494
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,680
so I could make them all doing peace signs.

495
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,520
Oh, okay.

496
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,240
Oh, those are opposable fingers?

497
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,280
Well, no, they're different.

498
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:19,980
The hands come off, the hands come off, the heads come off.

499
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:22,000
The accessories, again, the accessories,

500
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,880
it's just out of control with how crazy these things are.

501
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,720
Unbelievable.

502
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,480
For a man in his 30s.

503
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:32,480
But you would not like swat your newborn daughter away from,

504
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,560
you wouldn't make her not touch.

505
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,280
No, but she does get, to calm her down,

506
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,340
I bring her in here and I just have her look at the colors

507
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:41,720
and it does seem to work.

508
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:44,800
Of those specifically or what's the most calming toy you got?

509
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,080
Yeah, the shelf with them on it

510
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:49,120
and then above are all pretty colorful.

511
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,920
So I don't know that,

512
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,000
she just likes looking at colors.

513
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,640
I'm not out of my mind where I'm like,

514
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,440
she's like Attila the frog is my,

515
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,640
I'm like, I'm not imagining her talking yet.

516
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,040
I like dirtbag and ground chuck,

517
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:04,280
the villains from season three.

518
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:08,360
Yes, daughter, you're learning.

519
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,240
There's plenty of time to train her.

520
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,560
You can set her, just like,

521
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:15,000
you're going to listen to every episode of Danny's podcast,

522
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,760
which covers approximately 4% of what you need to know

523
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,680
to know what all these toys are.

524
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,360
Exactly.

525
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:24,680
You've got something else behind you,

526
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:27,360
which ties us right into, wow, we've done a smash.

527
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,360
Good, good, zoom in.

528
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,040
I can bring them closer too, but yeah,

529
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,480
I'll put them back, but yeah, I have,

530
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,000
I'm a big fan of the monster cereal mascots.

531
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,680
I'll say this, which might be controversial,

532
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:39,360
not a big fan of the cereal itself.

533
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,120
Oh, this is interesting.

534
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,760
I like the cereal, but I'm not as big,

535
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,280
I like a lot of other cereals better.

536
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:49,840
But I have a, thank you, Brian Mariotti,

537
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,160
I'm the COO of Funko.

538
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:56,160
I have a Funko Vinyl Soda toy of Fruit Brute,

539
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,440
which is, which is. Whoa, that's also cool.

540
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:02,760
Anything that's like 2D animated, but made 3D, this rules.

541
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:03,960
And it's flocked as well,

542
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:06,120
which means it has kind of a fur on it.

543
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,200
Okay, so that's a toy term.

544
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,400
You're going to start crossing the,

545
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,840
you've given us Brian Mariotti,

546
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,400
and you've given us flocking.

547
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,520
Yeah, well, and this is,

548
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,680
I don't know the name of the CEO or COO of this company,

549
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,120
but this is a company called Jada Toys,

550
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:21,120
which made classic, I don't know how,

551
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,600
well, you can see the. Great, Frankenberry.

552
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,360
And the box, the toy box looks like the suitcase.

553
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:29,560
The box is the cereal box, yeah.

554
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:33,160
Yeah, I don't know if they're making the other ones, but.

555
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:37,480
Currently just the first two, Chocula and Frankenberry.

556
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,880
They look great, you got multiple heads on there.

557
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:42,240
I don't think I knew there were, you know,

558
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:46,000
carefully constructed toy versions of these characters.

559
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:48,160
These are new, and here's also the thing,

560
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:51,320
as I maybe said before, anything you want a toy of

561
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,360
that was around when we were kids,

562
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,600
somebody's either working on it or has made it already.

563
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:59,280
Not, I would really like, is there any,

564
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,600
are there any earnest toys? Are there earnest?

565
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,200
I was just talking about this with a friend of mine

566
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:07,360
a week ago, and for some reason there are not earnest toys,

567
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,520
and that feels like just,

568
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:11,120
like NECA is the toy company I talk a lot about.

569
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:14,360
They're doing ALF now, they're doing dinosaurs,

570
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:17,880
they're doing a baby Sinclair and an Earl.

571
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:20,760
Earnest seems like this is a no-brainer for them

572
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:23,000
to get on board here, so it's in the zone,

573
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
it's in that timeframe, but no, for some reason

574
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,800
there are no good earnest toys right now.

575
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:29,380
Wow, wow, because I'd like earnest going on Splash Mountain

576
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:30,600
from the special that's here,

577
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,120
but I would kind of like finish the loot.

578
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:35,920
Mike, is there something you would like a really perfectly,

579
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:40,920
a upscale toy of from that time period?

580
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:46,440
I feel like it would have been the cereal monsters,

581
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,280
which we got.

582
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,640
Wow, wow, no kidding, geez.

583
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:52,520
Oh, so you're a fan, you dig these guys.

584
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:55,280
Well, I think same as Mike, I think the cereal's fine.

585
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,920
I think the mascots are unbelievable.

586
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,760
Oh boy, oh great, great.

587
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,720
Well, this is great, because I wanted to calibrate

588
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,360
how everybody feels about these characters,

589
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:07,480
what their general, what your general feelings are.

590
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:10,440
How do you think you came to that conclusion?

591
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:13,560
Is it from commercials or just the existence of them

592
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,720
on boxes?

593
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,960
I mean, definitely commercials,

594
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,960
if those would count as a Halloween special,

595
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,720
that would be my favorite special

596
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,720
is the commercials for the monster cereal.

597
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:26,320
But also we weren't much of a sugar cereal family

598
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:29,240
growing up, so walking through that aisle

599
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,480
is the equivalent feeling you get walking through

600
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,540
the video store aisle at Blockbuster

601
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:35,240
and looking at the things you can't get.

602
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,080
Sure.

603
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,640
They've always been fascinating to me,

604
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,560
and they're like a gateway horror.

605
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,240
They're not meant to scare anybody.

606
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,120
They get scared by kids in the commercials.

607
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:50,320
Yeah, kids, cats, any sudden movement.

608
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,800
Each other. Each other.

609
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,800
The first Boo Berry commercial,

610
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,440
which I really like,

611
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:01,460
is Boo Berry, first off, a lot of these commercials

612
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:03,440
involved all of them arguing about

613
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,760
their cereal being the best.

614
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,840
But then Boo Berry is introduced and shows up

615
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:11,800
and is like, I'm your new neighbor.

616
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,160
Jordan, actually, will you just bring that up?

617
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:18,760
The one minute version of the first Boo Berry commercial.

618
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,200
I know we're going a little out of order

619
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:23,120
because Boo Berry was the third one introduced,

620
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,880
but I was always very fond of.

621
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,400
Yeah, that's the one.

622
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,240
Okay.

623
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,840
First Boo Berry.

624
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:33,080
Someone's come for a nutritious breakfast.

625
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:33,920
What?

626
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,520
Hello, my name is Boo.

627
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,520
Let me finish.

628
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:41,560
Boo Berry, my ghostly good blueberry flavored cereal,

629
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:45,360
Boo Berry, is part of this complete breakfast.

630
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,440
Boo to you, Boo Berry.

631
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,120
Frankenberries got strawberry flavored marshmallows.

632
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,200
Couch-chocolates got chocolate marshmallows.

633
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,760
But I've got blueberry flavored marshmallows.

634
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,840
Frankenberries. Couch-chocolates.

635
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,000
And Boo Berry.

636
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:02,200
They're terrified of this Peter Laurie-esque.

637
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,800
Was shocked to find out that was not Peter Laurie this week.

638
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,640
It's not.

639
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,280
In fact, it's Paul Fries.

640
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,480
The ghost host from The Haunted Mansion.

641
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,560
It's the same voice that narrates The Haunted Mansion.

642
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,200
Wow, he does an incredible Peter Laurie.

643
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,040
It's really, really good.

644
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:16,240
And it doesn't sound at all like the ghost host,

645
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,840
so that really shows you his.

646
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,800
Isn't he also the Pillsbury Doughboy?

647
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:21,760
I think so, yeah.

648
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:22,600
He was.

649
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,200
He's so many things back in the old days.

650
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:27,320
Yeah, which none of these voices are similar remotely.

651
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:29,840
He's Ludwig Von Drake.

652
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,960
Oh yeah, I'm sure.

653
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,720
I feel like in these commercials,

654
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,920
lots of times it's about a serial mascot

655
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,040
trying to get the cereal,

656
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,280
like Barney wants Pebbles or Trick Shots wants Trix.

657
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:42,320
And these guys have their cereal all the time.

658
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,680
That conflict is not there.

659
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:46,320
You don't have to meet all these kids

660
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,640
that change out every time.

661
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:50,200
You get to focus on your core characters.

662
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,280
That's a good thing.

663
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:56,240
I also really liked in that ad that they are scared,

664
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:01,000
these monsters are afraid of just the word boo getting said.

665
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,320
And then he says, let me finish, boo Barry,

666
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,280
which they don't, that softens it.

667
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,120
Yeah, yeah.

668
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:07,960
Thank fucking God.

669
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:08,800
Jesus Christ, thank God.

670
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,760
It's just been a hanging boo.

671
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,720
Scott and Jason, that's what you're most afraid of

672
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,440
in these haunted houses is someone's gonna say boo at you.

673
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,840
Oh, just boo, yeah, yeah.

674
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,360
Or if they tack Barry on, you can relax.

675
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,200
Yeah, yeah, yes.

676
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,960
Boo Barry, boo to you.

677
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:25,320
Like, you know, there's ways you can soften it.

678
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:27,000
Soften the blow of boo, yes.

679
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,360
That's the thing we're the most afraid of this season.

680
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:33,960
Unfortunately, that version is missing a thing

681
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,800
in other commercials that I'm very fond of

682
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,080
where they refer to their cereal as being filled

683
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:42,880
with chocolate sweeties and strawberry sweeties.

684
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:48,080
Which as soon as I heard, I was like, uh-oh,

685
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,440
I'm gonna be into this.

686
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:53,320
And I immediately played it for my girlfriend

687
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:56,640
and she was like, I don't care for the sweeties.

688
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,480
I don't like sweeties.

689
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,560
Who's not on board with sweet?

690
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,160
What is the breakdown there?

691
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,400
Why do you like sweeties?

692
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,240
Why did she not? I don't know.

693
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,440
I just think it's really cute.

694
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,800
I think it's a cute way to refer to marshmallows.

695
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,240
To refer to like- No, the sweeties

696
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,120
are not the marshmallows.

697
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,920
I thought the sweeties were the marshmallows.

698
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,400
The sweeties are the cereal pieces

699
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,760
and then they also have marshmallows.

700
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,960
It is a little unclear

701
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:18,240
because it seemed like they went back and forth

702
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,640
on some commercials.

703
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,720
I believe, yeah, they're not the marshmallows.

704
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,560
They're not the marshmallows.

705
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,400
They're the regular pieces.

706
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,720
Sweeties are regular pieces, not marshmallows.

707
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,120
That's really confusing.

708
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:31,720
So it's not, it's a bowl of sweeties with added-

709
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:32,960
That's right. Marshmallows.

710
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,680
Which on top of that, there's like a clinical term

711
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,360
that I don't know if it's ever said in these ads,

712
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:41,160
but I think if you're talking about any of this lucky charms,

713
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,400
anything with marshmallows,

714
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,640
that a term you could use is marbits.

715
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:48,160
Anybody previously familiar with marbits?

716
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:52,400
The word scared me when I saw it

717
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,760
because it sounds like something you have to exterminate.

718
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:57,280
But marshmallow bits is,

719
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,560
this shortens into marbits.

720
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:02,880
Marbits is like a trauma horror movie series

721
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,840
with like little creatures that are gross

722
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,040
and it's very low budget, but some people like love it.

723
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:08,880
It's their whole personality.

724
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,680
And the box ads, they're just coming out of the toilet

725
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,600
or something like ghoulies.

726
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,520
Yeah.

727
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:14,000
No, marbits.

728
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:14,840
Marbits.

729
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,080
To just generally, well, first things first,

730
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:21,840
here's something we haven't acknowledged is that

731
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:26,840
this is the first case of a topic from our Patreon polls,

732
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:29,840
club three, where the audience chooses the topic.

733
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:33,960
This is the first where a topic did not win the poll.

734
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:34,960
It's what I wanted.

735
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,600
It's what I was vouching for.

736
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,680
Me too, yeah.

737
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,360
So now we know, Mike,

738
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,160
you were the first to initiate a protocol,

739
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:45,520
which is if we have put something in the club three poll

740
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:49,040
and also asked a club three member, thank you by the way,

741
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,840
to, if we've already asked somebody to be on the show,

742
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:55,960
you yourself have the power to pull it out of the club three

743
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:58,520
crypt and put it on main feed, baby.

744
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:00,320
Oh, I love this rule.

745
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,640
Thanks for doing it.

746
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:05,360
I remember being like a little bummed that monsters didn't win.

747
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,520
I think it's the one time I voted and I was like,

748
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,000
well, clearly this is the front runner, right?

749
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:10,960
And no.

750
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,600
Second place.

751
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:13,440
Was it?

752
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,280
By five votes?

753
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,120
No, it was third.

754
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,720
This was all, it was all so close.

755
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:17,560
Yeah.

756
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,440
I'm a little bit behind spirit Halloween as well.

757
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,320
Sorry to everyone that didn't want to hear this one.

758
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,840
People actively campaigns

759
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,640
and you're slapping them right in the face.

760
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,520
No, thank you for saving it.

761
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,320
Very excited about that.

762
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:34,280
Especially given your passion for the commercials.

763
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:37,080
I love that you have like pre-standing fondness for them.

764
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:37,920
For sure, yeah.

765
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:41,880
I think, I think like if Joe Camel counts,

766
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:42,720
this feels in the spirit.

767
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,400
Like I know it's not a theme park ride.

768
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,840
Although there is that serial theme park, right?

769
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,640
In Mall of America.

770
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,720
Oh, this came up.

771
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,920
I didn't know about this at all.

772
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,640
This was also in the Club 3 comments,

773
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,600
somebody suggested as a future topic,

774
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,360
General Mills Serial Adventure,

775
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:03,560
which was a some sort of exhibit or walkthrough

776
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,880
or something in the Mall of America.

777
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,960
Right, then this topic works for sure.

778
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:08,840
Oh yeah, yeah, absolutely.

779
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,880
So yeah, it's got a tie in right there.

780
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,520
There's another theme park tie in which we'll get to.

781
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,000
But also look, we love,

782
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,440
yeah, absolutely.

783
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,960
I think mascots, we've decided mascots count.

784
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,280
They have to, cause we love them too much.

785
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:23,160
Mike has toys of them.

786
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,400
They're definitely in.

787
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,000
And this is gonna crack open a whole thing

788
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,320
because we're clearly gonna have to step through other ones

789
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:33,720
because there's a whole dense ecosystem.

790
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:38,720
And I was trying to sort out in my head who goes together

791
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,600
because like with Disney and Universal

792
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,480
and then the stray characters who get picked up by Six Flags

793
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,480
or licensed to Universal or whatever,

794
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,960
this has one of those,

795
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:51,600
sorting out which serial mascots go together

796
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:55,200
is a big confusing game and we like big confusing games.

797
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,280
Which let me get to this.

798
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:59,400
Let me see if you guys know actually

799
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,840
who belongs in the same universe.

800
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,920
Because for a brief time,

801
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:07,720
there were essentially beanie babies.

802
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:10,560
Breakfast babies, in fact, was the name.

803
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:13,400
Oh, little sweeties, breakfast babies.

804
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:17,960
Breakfast baby, this is a nice like a little bed of cute

805
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:20,800
to rest on in the middle of a horrifying month.

806
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:25,120
So breakfast babies were out there.

807
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,760
There were seven of them.

808
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:29,960
And these all came with General Mills cereals.

809
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:32,080
I don't have the slide of this for the main camera,

810
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:35,640
but there are, here is the breakfast baby of Count Chocolat.

811
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,760
So this was one of seven.

812
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:40,920
And this, which means like we talk about the Disney,

813
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:43,400
the big five, like the primary characters.

814
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:47,200
General Mills had like the breakfast gang, the big seven.

815
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,840
Does anyone know offhand who's in the same universe

816
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:53,520
as Count Chocolat besides the monsters?

817
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,680
I think I can do this.

818
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:55,520
Oh, I think I can do this.

819
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,240
Okay, okay. Yeah.

820
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:59,560
Let's see, either of you chime in.

821
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:01,120
Sully the cuckoo bird?

822
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,520
That's right.

823
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,280
The Lucky Charms leprechaun?

824
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,960
Yes, Lucky the leprechaun.

825
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:06,800
Trix rabbit?

826
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:09,840
Yes, God, you guys, you really know it.

827
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:12,240
Wendell from the Cinnamon Toast Crunch?

828
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,320
Yes, and you know the name Wendell?

829
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,440
You guys are acing this.

830
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,200
I would have gotten, I would have gone,

831
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,400
I would have told, I don't wanna say one that isn't in there

832
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:23,880
because I, you know, it'd be great to trick you still.

833
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:24,720
Who's left?

834
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,800
Any of you know offhand?

835
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,280
Yeah, how many are left?

836
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:28,960
We got, I think just two left.

837
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,840
You guys are nailing it.

838
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:34,720
We got the cuckoo puffs bird, right?

839
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,560
Did you?

840
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,400
I don't think you did.

841
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,240
Sonny the cuckoo bird?

842
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,060
Yeah, we said that was the first one.

843
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:38,900
Yeah, that was the first.

844
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:39,740
Oh, sorry.

845
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:42,600
I think it's the

846
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,440
Wendell Charms.

847
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,280
Wendell.

848
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,100
Wendell has been said.

849
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:48,500
The wolf, the Cookie Crisp wolf or the bandit dog?

850
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:50,980
A bandit dog, I think is what you're,

851
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:52,260
wait are those different characters?

852
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:53,100
Yes.

853
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:53,940
Yeah, two different characters.

854
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:54,780
Okay.

855
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:58,140
Cookie Crisp has been a little lost over the years.

856
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:00,140
Wendell is Cinnamon Toast Crunch?

857
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:00,980
Yeah.

858
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:01,800
Yeah.

859
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:02,640
Okay.

860
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:03,460
Yes.

861
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:04,300
Which is a delicious cereal.

862
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:07,260
A really good cereal that will really cut your roof

863
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:09,460
of your mouth and then wedge cinnamon in there.

864
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:11,220
Jason has weak skin in his mouth.

865
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:13,040
I have very weak mouth skin.

866
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,300
Tissue paper in his mouth.

867
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:16,820
Golden Grahams is much more gentle.

868
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:17,660
That's true.

869
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:20,540
You gotta be careful for shrimp in those things too.

870
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:21,380
That's a point.

871
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:23,140
Yeah, don't forget, even though it's been a while,

872
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:23,980
never forget.

873
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:26,740
We got one more left, I believe.

874
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:28,380
It's kind of a big one actually.

875
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:31,220
Shoot.

876
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:32,480
It's gonna be so upset.

877
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,320
Yeah, when I hear this.

878
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:35,660
Can I give you a hint I can give?

879
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:36,580
Give a hint, yeah.

880
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:39,700
I don't wanna give a hint that's too.

881
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:41,380
Oh, the fruitless bird?

882
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:43,140
No, that one is Kellogg's.

883
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:43,980
That's Kellogg's.

884
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:47,700
The Captain Crunch is?

885
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:48,540
No, that's Quaker.

886
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:49,940
That's Quaker.

887
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:51,380
It's in the animal kingdom.

888
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:52,220
Oh, Tony?

889
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:53,060
No, that's Kellogg's.

890
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:53,900
That's Kellogg's.

891
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:54,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

892
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:58,020
Because I was wondering are all of the characters

893
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:59,580
in the General Mills family,

894
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:01,500
but there's more Kellogg's than you would think.

895
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:03,700
And Tony, one of the big ones.

896
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:04,940
Right, and then there's like Post,

897
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:06,220
which has the Flintstones.

898
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:07,820
Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah.

899
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:11,820
And Sugar Bear, who is from Golden Criss.

900
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:16,060
Captain Crunch is kind of an island in Quaker Oats.

901
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:18,900
Yeah, and he doesn't have a lot of friends.

902
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:21,900
Just his religious friend who's always trying

903
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:23,500
to get him to come to a meeting.

904
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:26,260
Come to a Quaker meeting, friends.

905
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:29,340
Sorry, sailing to do, we're gonna hit the seas.

906
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:31,900
Here, I'll eliminate Toucan Sam.

907
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:34,020
I'll eliminate Digum Frog.

908
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:36,060
And I'll eliminate Snap, Crackle, Pop.

909
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:37,860
We got a big one left.

910
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:38,940
Does that narrow it down?

911
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:40,300
Oh, gosh.

912
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:41,140
Those are all Kellogg's.

913
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:41,980
It's too annihilating.

914
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:44,180
People are screaming at us right now.

915
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:45,020
Little guy.

916
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:47,220
It's not the Rice Krispie guys.

917
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:48,060
No, I just said Snap, Crackle, Pop.

918
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:48,900
You said Snap, Crackle, Pop.

919
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:49,740
Snap, Crackle, Pop.

920
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:50,560
Sorry.

921
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:52,500
I remain, please no one here be ashamed

922
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,460
because I'm amazed how well everyone's done.

923
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:55,860
I am ashamed, though.

924
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:56,700
I am ashamed.

925
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:58,060
Little guy, he's a little guy.

926
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:00,400
Oh.

927
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:04,060
I'm gonna be.

928
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:04,900
Oh, yeah.

929
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:05,740
Yeah, that's it.

930
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:07,220
That was not said.

931
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:08,060
Yeah, yeah.

932
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:08,900
Yeah, fuck.

933
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:09,900
I was gonna give you the hint.

934
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:11,780
Something.

935
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:12,620
Yeah.

936
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:14,940
Or Buzz Buzz, but that one is.

937
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:17,140
It's gonna be a little too obvious.

938
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:21,820
What's funny is I have right here a new Trix Rabbit toy

939
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:22,660
that they've released,

940
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:24,980
retro toys for all seven of those icons.

941
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:29,300
A Trix Rabbit who's into asphyxiation still.

942
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:31,340
Well, I haven't opened his package,

943
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:33,500
but he's in a little 80s aerobic outfit.

944
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:34,340
Yeah.

945
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:35,180
Great.

946
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:36,940
Wow, for running away.

947
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:37,780
That's great.

948
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:38,620
That's right.

949
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:40,860
So that's the family that we're dealing with,

950
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:43,340
and they're all kind of a gang altogether somewhere,

951
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:44,540
but I'll bring that up later.

952
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:45,660
None of these cereals were in my house,

953
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:48,100
which is partially why I was so fascinated by all of them.

954
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:50,420
Oh, like the distance from,

955
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:51,260
would you go to a friend's house?

956
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:52,580
Oh, no, I guess the inner Cheerios

957
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:54,620
would make an appearance, but nothing else.

958
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:57,020
Because were you avoiding,

959
00:33:57,020 --> 00:34:00,060
was the family avoiding crazy rich cereal, sugary cereal?

960
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:01,060
Yeah, it was just sugar cereal.

961
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:02,980
We didn't have much soda in the house ever.

962
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:03,820
Okay, sure.

963
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:04,660
Okay.

964
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:08,220
We had not a million,

965
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:13,140
we would go to the store and look at the cereals and stuff,

966
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:15,860
and I feel like I would usually hear,

967
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:17,100
I was like, can we get this?

968
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:19,740
And it's like, you have to finish the Apple Jacks

969
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:22,740
at home first before you get a box of corn pops.

970
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:24,740
But there was always lots of flakes, you know?

971
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:27,460
There was always like a honey bunches of oats.

972
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:29,260
Or a racing brand.

973
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:31,980
Apple Jacks, or just for clarification,

974
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:34,380
was Apple Jacks considered like a better cereal

975
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:36,100
in the house, or was it just that you hadn't finished it?

976
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:39,500
Well, it was just that I think it hadn't finished.

977
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:44,500
I think some of the sugary cereals did seem more like food.

978
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:45,740
Like some were just fine.

979
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:46,580
Because Apple Jacks was pure sugar.

980
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:47,420
It was.

981
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:48,260
But it was just as bad.

982
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:49,100
But it said Apple, so I feel like.

983
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:50,460
That's what I was wondering if you was like,

984
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:52,660
you have to finish your healthy Apple Jacks.

985
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:54,220
Because my mom would do stuff like,

986
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:55,780
well, I'd be like, we want to go to McDonald's,

987
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:56,620
and she'd be like, all right,

988
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:58,220
but you have to eat a filet of fish there,

989
00:34:58,220 --> 00:34:59,940
because it's healthier.

990
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:00,900
Oh.

991
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:03,540
And I was like, yeah, all right, fine.

992
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:04,940
Well, that's like in these commercials,

993
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:06,860
when they show you a complete breakfast,

994
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:10,140
which is a full bowl of Count Choculo,

995
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:13,820
a full glass of orange juice, a full glass of milk,

996
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:16,100
and a couple pieces of buttered toast.

997
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:18,620
With like full square melting all the way.

998
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:20,940
With full square melted butter.

999
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:22,900
I feel like at one time as a kid,

1000
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:24,580
I was like, oh, I should be healthy.

1001
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:26,660
I should have a piece of toast with my cereal.

1002
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:27,500
With a ton of butter on it.

1003
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,340
Yeah, just with some butter.

1004
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:29,540
I watched a few commercials the other day,

1005
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:31,100
and there is a quick drop off

1006
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:33,260
between part of this nutritious breakfast

1007
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:34,780
and part of this complete breakfast.

1008
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:36,460
At some point, they were clearly told,

1009
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:37,900
you cannot say that Count Choculo

1010
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:38,980
is part of a nutritious breakfast.

1011
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:39,820
Oh, yeah.

1012
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:40,660
It's not.

1013
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:41,500
Oh, fascinating.

1014
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:42,940
It's like when they brought back Fruit Brute

1015
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:44,900
and stopped spelling his name Fruit,

1016
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:47,660
and started spelling it F-R-U-T-E.

1017
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:48,660
Did they switch?

1018
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:51,220
They switched at some point when they brought him back.

1019
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:52,060
Yeah.

1020
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:53,180
This world is full of this stuff.

1021
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:56,060
Like the sushi crab with the cave,

1022
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:58,460
these weird little, these subtle things.

1023
00:35:58,460 --> 00:35:59,940
You think it's like making it fun,

1024
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:01,740
but in fact, it's legalese.

1025
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:03,540
It's just scoob-noo-boing.

1026
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:05,340
I love crab with a K.

1027
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:07,180
Yeah, it's not bad.

1028
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:09,060
There's a still from one of the commercials,

1029
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:09,900
I forget which one it is,

1030
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:11,900
it just says vitamin charged

1031
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:14,580
with a picture of the cereal.

1032
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:15,620
Choose your letter.

1033
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:17,180
D-E-C, we don't care.

1034
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:19,700
That's insane.

1035
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:22,340
Well, let's get into kinda how these

1036
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:23,540
rolled out a little bit,

1037
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:27,540
and we can kind of like welcome each of them to the show.

1038
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:29,980
This is a post-Lucky Charms era.

1039
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:33,260
I think that seems to be the one that landed the most,

1040
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:35,740
and for the General Mills family.

1041
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:38,700
So they are trying to find new fun characters,

1042
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:42,740
left and right, and this gets us into the early 70s.

1043
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:47,740
And the launch was a dual launch in March 1971

1044
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:52,220
of Count Chocula and Frankenberry together.

1045
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:56,900
Let me give the full intro, Count Alfred Chocula.

1046
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:59,660
I don't know in what media that was established,

1047
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:02,660
but it seems to have been established.

1048
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:05,660
So Count Alfred Chocula and Frankenberry.

1049
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:07,420
Let's address these guys first.

1050
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:08,740
Do we have a strong favorite?

1051
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:11,180
You're both on your shelf, Mike.

1052
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:15,140
Any particular fondnesses for these characters?

1053
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:17,500
Well, yeah, but I would just say off the top of my head,

1054
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:21,100
Frankenberry always as a kid was my favorite for two reasons.

1055
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:26,100
I was a Frankenstein liker, and I was a strawberry liker.

1056
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:28,460
So it was just easy.

1057
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:33,460
I was a big Frankenberry, that was always my number one.

1058
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:38,740
I think I was Frankenberry for the flavor reasons,

1059
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:42,620
and also Count Chocula I think was clearly the star,

1060
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:45,100
and I felt a little bad for a Frankenberry.

1061
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:46,740
Oh, well and it's kind of a night,

1062
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:49,860
like when you're trying to pick a favorite muppet

1063
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:52,500
or something, it feels a little boring to pick Kermit maybe.

1064
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:54,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah, so you go off the beat.

1065
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:56,020
The fun sidekick.

1066
00:37:57,060 --> 00:38:00,220
He looks, I really love, I mean the box you were showing us,

1067
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:02,700
Mike, that replicates the old cereal box,

1068
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:07,220
it's a really vibrant pink, and all his shades,

1069
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:11,980
from his face to his arms to his head doodads,

1070
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:15,660
which is like a little like the whistle that blows

1071
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:18,500
when you're off work, those that we all,

1072
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:21,820
I kind of wish we still had those in a comedy

1073
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:22,940
30 Rock.

1074
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:24,180
Like a Brontosaurus tail on our way out.

1075
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:25,420
You'd feel more like an adult,

1076
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:28,380
that's how what we were taught jobs were.

1077
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:31,140
And then like a little like meter on his head,

1078
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:33,900
that would be on like a pool, like a pool filter.

1079
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:37,380
A seemingly like a stick of dynamite

1080
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:40,100
in the side of his face, do you know what I'm talking about?

1081
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:42,100
Like what are his ears?

1082
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:44,780
They've got like little strands that,

1083
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:47,940
it feels like you could like light his fuse.

1084
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:49,860
He's got a dynamite face.

1085
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:52,980
Oh maybe, but then I don't know what the strings are.

1086
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:56,820
Any, you're close to a big picture, Mike.

1087
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:58,780
Yeah, I'm looking at it.

1088
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:00,900
They're not really that well represented on the toy,

1089
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:02,620
because they don't have any little string hanging off.

1090
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:04,420
But yeah, I don't really know.

1091
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:07,660
I think those are like, you could hook up like

1092
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:11,220
jumper cables to them maybe.

1093
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:13,460
Oh, bringing back the light.

1094
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:16,540
That's what I think they are, but I could be wrong.

1095
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:21,540
He's also, are his fingernails anything, am I crazy?

1096
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:23,580
Are they like strawberries?

1097
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:25,220
Strawberries, cool.

1098
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:28,420
But Count Chocula clearly just has little claws.

1099
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:30,820
He just has little, you know, grabbers.

1100
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:33,380
Cause they do closeups where they're like

1101
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:36,100
nudging the sweeties in the bowl.

1102
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:39,940
And Count Chocula just has like long nails,

1103
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:42,220
and then it cuts to Boo Berry doing the same thing.

1104
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:45,700
And he, yeah, he clearly has strawberry fingernails.

1105
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:50,260
I like Jason is also often nudging the sweeties in the bowl.

1106
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:53,140
Just nudging the sweeties, so I get a good scoop.

1107
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:54,540
So I get a good spoonful.

1108
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:55,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1109
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:56,380
And you want a good distribution

1110
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:58,220
between the marshmallows and the sweeties.

1111
00:39:58,220 --> 00:39:59,500
I don't think it ever occurred to me

1112
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:02,620
because the change would have happened the year I was born

1113
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:05,620
that I always liked Count Chocula,

1114
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:07,260
often had Count Chocula in the house

1115
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:09,620
cause I was a little chocolate boy.

1116
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:14,620
There, the shapes of the cereal, I always knew to be ghosts,

1117
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:16,900
but that was like a big marketing change.

1118
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:18,060
That was like a big change.

1119
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:21,780
They used to just be circles with like crosses in them,

1120
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:22,620
with Xs in them.

1121
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:24,980
What do you think a vampire would not care for?

1122
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:25,820
Right.

1123
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:27,700
Just little garlic sweeties.

1124
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:29,300
Just little garlic sweeties.

1125
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:33,460
Did not also these characters,

1126
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:34,860
I don't know if I have the chronology right,

1127
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:38,780
it seems like in classic era they had pupils,

1128
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:42,020
but lately as they have returned to shelves,

1129
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:43,540
they have Xs for eyes.

1130
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:47,300
Well, that's because of street artist,

1131
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:48,540
is it pronounced cause?

1132
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:50,460
I believe it's pronounced cause.

1133
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:54,540
Yes, I was on, I watched a video

1134
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:57,380
about the current run of monster cereals,

1135
00:40:57,380 --> 00:41:01,260
which helpfully gave out the code to enter to win

1136
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:05,900
a set of the limited edition cause monster toys.

1137
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:07,820
Yes.

1138
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:08,660
Guys, we got a winner.

1139
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:09,500
Call in the room.

1140
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:11,020
I wanna win.

1141
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:12,300
No, I'm talking about myself.

1142
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:13,140
Oh, yes.

1143
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:14,500
Did you win?

1144
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:15,340
I did.

1145
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:16,540
A winner of that.

1146
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:18,380
I'm really excited for them to come.

1147
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:20,940
I got the email that I won the next day

1148
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:22,580
and then they said they'll arrive in 10 weeks.

1149
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:23,820
So I was like, oh, they'll be fun for the,

1150
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:24,940
I was gonna bring them here,

1151
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:27,260
I thought they'd be fun for Halloween,

1152
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:29,340
but I'm gonna get them sometime around Christmas.

1153
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:30,340
Weird.

1154
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:32,420
Why did they not line that up better?

1155
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:35,340
Wait, sorry, what did you have to do?

1156
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:36,540
What did you have to do to win again?

1157
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:37,580
Well, I'm just gonna do

1158
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:40,620
what this YouTube channel cereal time did.

1159
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:42,980
Go to the website, callismonsters.com

1160
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:45,780
and when it prompts you for the code,

1161
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:48,460
type in monsters424, one word.

1162
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:49,300
That's what this boy did.

1163
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:52,020
Yeah, so, and then you will be entered.

1164
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:53,460
You can enter once a day.

1165
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:58,460
So I have a reminder for noon to enter

1166
00:41:58,540 --> 00:42:01,660
and I'm just gonna keep hitting remind me tomorrow

1167
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:04,780
every day so that I get reminded.

1168
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:06,220
Noon is during the episode,

1169
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:08,060
so you are gonna have to do this.

1170
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:10,540
Well, but I won't see the notification

1171
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:12,460
until I turn off do not disturb

1172
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:13,740
until I'm done recording.

1173
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:14,580
Okay, okay, but if you need to do it.

1174
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:15,420
I think you should do it on the air.

1175
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:18,060
Oh, I can do it on the air.

1176
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:20,700
Please do, we all got clocks in front.

1177
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:22,220
We'll alert you, we'll give you the heads up.

1178
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:23,060
Okay, great.

1179
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:26,460
Cause is like, it'll be like if they're doing the X,

1180
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:29,460
it's like monster cereals X cause

1181
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:33,220
and he's done a Sesame Street line of clothes

1182
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:37,100
at Uniqlo lately with Big Bird.

1183
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:38,740
That's the first time maybe that was on my radar

1184
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:42,020
where I was like, why is Big Bird dead on this sweatshirt?

1185
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:45,980
Like all the character like Bert and Ernie have X's for eyes.

1186
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:46,820
This is a call of.

1187
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:49,420
And it was like signed off on by Sesame Street,

1188
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:50,380
which seems crazy.

1189
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:51,820
Yeah, yeah, it was all officially licensed.

1190
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:53,820
Yeah, you can make Big Bird dead on a shirt.

1191
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:56,820
Yeah, so that is, I guess it's just a hit.

1192
00:42:56,820 --> 00:42:59,620
It's not dead, I don't think it means they're dead.

1193
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:01,180
It's just hip, but they're cool.

1194
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:02,020
It means they're cool.

1195
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:03,500
If you have X's for eyes, you're cool.

1196
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:08,140
So is the recently discussed adult happy meals,

1197
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:11,100
which don't have X eyes, they have double eyes.

1198
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:12,260
That's not cause.

1199
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:15,620
I know it's not cause, but is that trying to be,

1200
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:17,100
is it a fake cause?

1201
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:19,620
No, that's cactus flea market.

1202
00:43:19,620 --> 00:43:21,260
Cactus plant flea market.

1203
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:23,020
Cactus plant flea market.

1204
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:23,860
I don't know who.

1205
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:26,180
But is it an attempt to play into the cause vibe?

1206
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:28,180
I see what Scott says, Scott is right.

1207
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:30,140
This could be, this is something we need to do

1208
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:33,340
more investigating because who came first,

1209
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:36,660
a cactus plant flea market or cause?

1210
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:37,780
I have a feeling it is cause.

1211
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:38,900
I feel like you're right, Scott.

1212
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:41,620
Maybe the trend now is to make stuff

1213
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:43,460
look a little bit fucked up.

1214
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:44,300
Yeah.

1215
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:45,140
That's how you make it adult.

1216
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:47,180
Well, in all scenes, did Kid Robot come first?

1217
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:49,220
I mean, Kid Robot, of course, I believe,

1218
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:51,460
was doing the vinyl toys that Disney was just like,

1219
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:53,300
we're going to do this.

1220
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:57,420
Just change it from certain shapes to Mickey ears.

1221
00:43:57,420 --> 00:43:58,580
Jason, would it surprise you to learn

1222
00:43:58,580 --> 00:44:01,300
that Kid Robot is owned by NECA?

1223
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:03,580
It does surprise me to say that.

1224
00:44:03,580 --> 00:44:06,620
And the company also owns Graceland.

1225
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:09,300
The Elvis?

1226
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:10,300
Elvis is Graceland.

1227
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:11,260
Elvis is Elvis?

1228
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:12,100
Okay.

1229
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:14,980
Okay, very strange.

1230
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:18,580
Cause also redesigned the Moon Man statue.

1231
00:44:18,580 --> 00:44:19,420
The MTV.

1232
00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:22,380
Oh, are they the ones who put Johnny Depp inside of it?

1233
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:23,220
Yeah.

1234
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:27,900
But he has these puffy, it looks like they're wearing

1235
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:30,900
ear muffs that some of the General Mills monsters,

1236
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:33,660
they have these ear things going on too.

1237
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:34,820
Okay, gotcha.

1238
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:38,060
So what do you get when these arrive in December?

1239
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:42,420
How many boxes?

1240
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:43,260
What are you getting?

1241
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:44,420
I have no idea.

1242
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:47,260
I think it's four of something.

1243
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:49,660
I don't know if they are action figures.

1244
00:44:49,660 --> 00:44:51,340
I don't know if they're little erasers,

1245
00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:53,460
but I saw it on Bloody Disgusting.

1246
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:56,700
And I signed up and I thought like everyone won

1247
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:58,420
because I did it once and they sent me an email

1248
00:44:58,420 --> 00:44:59,820
the next day that said you won.

1249
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:00,740
Maybe I just got really lucky.

1250
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:02,620
Oh yeah, it seems like you did get lucky.

1251
00:45:02,620 --> 00:45:06,260
I think it's all four, I think it's everyone but Fruit Fruit.

1252
00:45:06,260 --> 00:45:08,820
It's like whatever's out this year.

1253
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:09,740
Because that's the other thing,

1254
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:12,980
monster cereals are now entirely seasonal.

1255
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:17,180
It's around Halloween and I was,

1256
00:45:17,180 --> 00:45:19,180
when we first started talking about this

1257
00:45:19,180 --> 00:45:20,820
as a potential topic a while ago,

1258
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:23,220
I was in the stores going like,

1259
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:24,220
where's the Count Chocula,

1260
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:27,380
I don't see, isn't Count Chocula a regular cereal?

1261
00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:30,420
This has apparently not been year round for years.

1262
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:31,860
Oh, interesting.

1263
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:35,780
Yeah, I guess they come around enough that like,

1264
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:39,180
I see them in my periphery at a target enough

1265
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:40,500
that I think they're around.

1266
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:44,740
Yes, and they do a lot of stunts.

1267
00:45:44,740 --> 00:45:48,140
There was like a bunch of the DC comic artists

1268
00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:49,620
redesigned them for a year.

1269
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:52,620
And then there was, last year there was a Monster Mash cereal

1270
00:45:52,620 --> 00:45:55,580
which was supposed to be all of them combined,

1271
00:45:55,580 --> 00:45:58,740
but was just Boo Berry and Franken Berry combined.

1272
00:45:58,740 --> 00:45:59,580
What?

1273
00:45:59,620 --> 00:46:02,060
Marshmallows shaped like the other guys.

1274
00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:02,900
Oh.

1275
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:03,720
Called Monster Mash?

1276
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:04,860
Called Monster Mash, yeah.

1277
00:46:04,860 --> 00:46:05,700
And they did a-

1278
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:06,540
Jason, I wanna correct real quick,

1279
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:09,700
Yummy Mummy is the one that's not in the Cause collection.

1280
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:11,020
Right, yeah.

1281
00:46:11,020 --> 00:46:11,860
Okay.

1282
00:46:11,860 --> 00:46:12,980
Because Fruit Brute is back.

1283
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:14,420
He's free, Fruit Brute is back,

1284
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:15,260
Yummy Mummy is not.

1285
00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:17,060
Yummy Mummy you cannot get this year, right?

1286
00:46:17,060 --> 00:46:17,900
Are they the same thing,

1287
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:19,340
Yummy Mummy and Fruit Brute?

1288
00:46:19,340 --> 00:46:21,740
Well, they were never available at the same time.

1289
00:46:21,740 --> 00:46:23,260
They were both kind of generic fruit,

1290
00:46:23,260 --> 00:46:25,020
I think when they brought Fruit Brute back,

1291
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:26,980
they made it cherry flavored.

1292
00:46:26,980 --> 00:46:30,620
There was a time when Fruit Brute was lime,

1293
00:46:30,620 --> 00:46:34,260
but that is not the case when it comes back now, I think.

1294
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:37,220
They brought all five back like five or six years ago

1295
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:39,860
and I bought all five at that time.

1296
00:46:39,860 --> 00:46:40,700
Oh.

1297
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:43,980
And I don't remember any major difference

1298
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:46,100
between Yummy Mummy and Fruit Brute.

1299
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:46,940
Okay, okay, that was generic.

1300
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:48,300
But there was technically something,

1301
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:49,140
but there wasn't anything that was very distinct.

1302
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:51,680
Is it like Fruity Pebbles where that sort of like,

1303
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:54,540
whatever that flavor is, is a blanket fruit?

1304
00:46:55,540 --> 00:46:57,940
Yeah, I think that's probably right.

1305
00:46:57,940 --> 00:46:59,020
Okay.

1306
00:46:59,020 --> 00:47:02,900
But the taste is, Fruity Pebbles is like gourmet

1307
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:03,860
compared to the taste of these.

1308
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:04,700
Yeah, I was gonna say,

1309
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:06,460
that makes me feel like I would like it.

1310
00:47:06,460 --> 00:47:08,060
Fruity Pebbles is the best cereal of all time.

1311
00:47:08,060 --> 00:47:10,000
Fruity Pebbles, yeah, exactly.

1312
00:47:11,060 --> 00:47:13,340
Fruit Brute, I don't think I've ever actually had.

1313
00:47:13,340 --> 00:47:14,180
Huh.

1314
00:47:14,180 --> 00:47:17,580
Well, tell, it sounds like maybe Mike Carlson,

1315
00:47:17,580 --> 00:47:21,340
you have the most experience with the eating of these.

1316
00:47:21,340 --> 00:47:23,860
What report, I mean, granted,

1317
00:47:23,860 --> 00:47:25,180
we're mainly about the characters here,

1318
00:47:25,180 --> 00:47:28,060
but what can you tell us about the taste?

1319
00:47:28,060 --> 00:47:30,620
Here's what I think, okay, I don't remember the year,

1320
00:47:30,620 --> 00:47:32,300
and some of these videos have mentioned it,

1321
00:47:32,300 --> 00:47:33,900
and somebody pointed this out to me,

1322
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:35,200
and it was a revelation to me,

1323
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:36,900
is that at a certain point,

1324
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:39,220
a lot of these cereals switched from oats

1325
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:40,960
to complete corn syrup.

1326
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:42,020
Oh, mm-hmm.

1327
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:45,540
And it ruined the taste, I mean, not ruined,

1328
00:47:45,540 --> 00:47:47,900
but made the taste worse, made everything taste worse.

1329
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:49,900
So I don't know, some things like,

1330
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:51,160
I remember, I've said this before,

1331
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:52,400
this is maybe a five-timers.

1332
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:53,540
I've said this on the show before.

1333
00:47:53,540 --> 00:47:55,940
I remember when Trix announced,

1334
00:47:55,940 --> 00:47:57,500
like, oh, we got new shapes or whatever,

1335
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:59,700
and I ate Trix, and I went, this tastes different.

1336
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:00,940
Like, this isn't as good,

1337
00:48:00,940 --> 00:48:04,460
and the flavor isn't as vibrant anymore.

1338
00:48:04,460 --> 00:48:07,220
So I don't know, I don't remember all that to say.

1339
00:48:07,220 --> 00:48:08,540
I don't remember eating,

1340
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:11,380
I don't remember the taste of these cereals

1341
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:12,820
when I was a kid.

1342
00:48:12,820 --> 00:48:14,260
They were probably better.

1343
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:17,300
But eating them now, I find all the taste,

1344
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:20,300
all the kind of flavors pretty, I don't know,

1345
00:48:20,420 --> 00:48:24,020
like, not strong, like not,

1346
00:48:24,020 --> 00:48:26,060
it all tastes like a little watered down to me.

1347
00:48:26,060 --> 00:48:28,060
It all tastes like it's a little stale,

1348
00:48:28,060 --> 00:48:30,180
and I don't know why that is.

1349
00:48:30,180 --> 00:48:32,560
I'd still eat them, but it's not something I crave

1350
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:37,180
every year as a sugar hound to get a box of.

1351
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:40,640
I like, eating marshmallows and cereal, always fun.

1352
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:42,760
Just like the idea, when you're taking a bite,

1353
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:44,200
you get a little surprise.

1354
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:45,820
It's always gonna be good.

1355
00:48:45,820 --> 00:48:47,020
I'm not gonna turn that down.

1356
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:50,900
But all of the cereals feel to me like they had,

1357
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:53,180
oh, they only put like 50% of the flavor

1358
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:54,900
that they should have put in them.

1359
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:56,020
Yeah. If that makes sense.

1360
00:48:56,020 --> 00:48:58,780
More potent in the 70s, like drugs probably were.

1361
00:48:58,780 --> 00:49:02,300
It was like, certain drugs were better in the 70s.

1362
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:03,700
Certain cereals.

1363
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:06,140
Fruity Pebbles, I would say, stood the test of time.

1364
00:49:06,140 --> 00:49:08,260
That actually still tastes to me like it did

1365
00:49:08,260 --> 00:49:12,100
when I was a kid, and that is a strong, delicious flavor.

1366
00:49:13,140 --> 00:49:13,980
Yeah.

1367
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:17,220
As someone who's not into these kinds of cereals,

1368
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:19,580
I think this, I might've even had this opinion as a kid.

1369
00:49:19,580 --> 00:49:21,260
I definitely had cereals here and there

1370
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:23,740
with the marshmallows, the marbits.

1371
00:49:23,740 --> 00:49:26,700
But when you describe, I just,

1372
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:28,620
I remember it even as a kid thinking,

1373
00:49:28,620 --> 00:49:30,420
I know what marshmallows are like,

1374
00:49:30,420 --> 00:49:32,380
and then there's marbits.

1375
00:49:32,380 --> 00:49:34,020
I didn't have the word then, but I knew.

1376
00:49:34,020 --> 00:49:36,620
But it's helpful, because it is a different thing.

1377
00:49:36,620 --> 00:49:38,540
And I think of them now, and I'm like,

1378
00:49:38,540 --> 00:49:40,920
these are pencil erasers.

1379
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:42,760
These, I don't think I like the texture.

1380
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:44,040
I'm soft about a marbit.

1381
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:44,880
Yeah, yeah.

1382
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:45,880
Whereas a marshmallow is soft.

1383
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:46,720
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

1384
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:48,240
And that turned me on.

1385
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:51,520
Maybe soft is a lot of what I want out of a marshmallow.

1386
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:54,080
But am I, is this heresy to people

1387
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:56,560
who like marbits more than me?

1388
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:57,840
Yes, it is heresy.

1389
00:49:57,840 --> 00:49:58,680
Okay, great.

1390
00:49:58,680 --> 00:49:59,720
Heresy.

1391
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:02,240
Because especially Lucky Charms as a kid,

1392
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:05,240
so much of the heavy lifting was just the shapes.

1393
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:07,160
And going, oh, looking at the shapes

1394
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:08,600
and seeing which one you got.

1395
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:12,240
And there is something satisfying about eating them.

1396
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:15,760
I acknowledge that they're not a tasty marshmallow.

1397
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:16,600
Yeah.

1398
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:17,420
Yeah.

1399
00:50:17,420 --> 00:50:18,640
Which is a fair expectation.

1400
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:21,600
I just like, I don't know.

1401
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:23,640
It didn't give me enough of what I expected

1402
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:25,240
a marshmallow to be.

1403
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:27,680
Yeah, you want it more of a kick.

1404
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:29,920
I do remember a few years ago,

1405
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:32,860
buying Frankenberry when it was out and back.

1406
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:36,780
And in high school, I have a very distinct memory

1407
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:38,320
of buying a box of Boo Berry,

1408
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:40,080
because I was so excited.

1409
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:42,600
Because I had heard about a Frankenberry

1410
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:43,800
and Boo Berry for years.

1411
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:46,000
And I'd occasionally see Frankenberry,

1412
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:49,160
but I was like, oh my God, I've never seen Boo Berry.

1413
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:50,480
I have to get this.

1414
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:52,520
And that I remember being pretty good.

1415
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:54,400
But a few years ago when I bought Frankenberry,

1416
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:56,760
it took me a while to get through that box.

1417
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:57,840
Okay, okay.

1418
00:50:57,840 --> 00:51:02,840
Because I feel like I'm back to being child rule,

1419
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:06,320
where I have raisin bran crunch in the house,

1420
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:09,100
and then I have Reese's Puffs.

1421
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:12,240
The middle ground of that is,

1422
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:16,080
Trader Joe's makes a flakes and granola

1423
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:18,880
vanilla flavored cereal that just tastes like candy.

1424
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:19,720
It's delicious.

1425
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:20,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1426
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:23,160
I had nothing but that through the pandemic.

1427
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:25,080
I was just like, this is my only breakfast

1428
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:26,480
to eat from now on. It is, yeah.

1429
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:28,560
And there's a maple pecan one,

1430
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:31,600
but that one just doesn't hit the same way.

1431
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:32,440
Totally agree.

1432
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:33,400
I had a joke on late night.

1433
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:34,280
I don't remember what the joke was,

1434
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:35,960
but it was about Lucky Charms.

1435
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:39,380
And General Mills sent me a box of just marshmallow.

1436
00:51:39,380 --> 00:51:40,220
Lucky Charms.

1437
00:51:40,220 --> 00:51:41,340
Oh, wow.

1438
00:51:41,340 --> 00:51:42,180
Oh, the dream.

1439
00:51:42,180 --> 00:51:43,540
What could happen on a show?

1440
00:51:43,540 --> 00:51:45,940
I mean, the most incredible mail day of my life.

1441
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:49,820
And I popped a couple, they were Cheez-Its or something,

1442
00:51:49,820 --> 00:51:51,980
and then just tossed the box.

1443
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:53,740
I can't even hold onto this,

1444
00:51:53,740 --> 00:51:55,420
because I opened it, but I'm not going to eat a box

1445
00:51:55,420 --> 00:51:57,340
of marshmallows, marvets.

1446
00:51:57,340 --> 00:51:58,660
Yeah, after a while, yeah,

1447
00:51:58,660 --> 00:52:02,180
and as weeks go by, what happens to those?

1448
00:52:02,180 --> 00:52:03,020
Maybe you should have just used it

1449
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:05,460
to season dishes that you were making.

1450
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:07,020
Put it in things as you made them.

1451
00:52:07,020 --> 00:52:07,860
God damn it.

1452
00:52:08,780 --> 00:52:09,620
Cocktails.

1453
00:52:09,620 --> 00:52:10,460
Yeah, yeah.

1454
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:14,980
Let's bring Boo Barry into the,

1455
00:52:14,980 --> 00:52:17,180
let's welcome Boo Barry to the show,

1456
00:52:18,020 --> 00:52:23,020
introduced in 1973 to expand on these two successful

1457
00:52:23,060 --> 00:52:24,460
characters out of the gate.

1458
00:52:24,460 --> 00:52:25,700
Jason, you said some of this already,

1459
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:28,660
but these animated commercials, which are very well done,

1460
00:52:28,660 --> 00:52:31,220
the early ones, at least Bill Melendez was involved,

1461
00:52:31,220 --> 00:52:34,380
who was behind the Peanuts Christmas specials

1462
00:52:34,380 --> 00:52:35,260
and early Peanuts stuff.

1463
00:52:35,260 --> 00:52:38,860
So very reputable animators.

1464
00:52:38,860 --> 00:52:40,100
These went over great.

1465
00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:43,940
The deal kinda, Chocula and Frankenberry are enemies,

1466
00:52:43,940 --> 00:52:47,500
but they're common things, that they're scared by everything,

1467
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:49,540
much like good boys.

1468
00:52:49,540 --> 00:52:52,460
And then a third character introduced,

1469
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:54,340
who's kind of a common, if not enemy,

1470
00:52:54,340 --> 00:52:57,460
then just pest to both of them.

1471
00:52:57,460 --> 00:53:01,980
Yeah, the annoying neighbor, the cousin Oliver.

1472
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:03,820
But he lasted longer than cousin Oliver.

1473
00:53:03,820 --> 00:53:07,140
Which I probably liked, I mean, I feel like Peter and Lori,

1474
00:53:07,140 --> 00:53:10,620
especially in the Looney Tunes universe,

1475
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:12,540
a regular reference point.

1476
00:53:12,540 --> 00:53:15,420
Yeah, there's always cartoon Peter and Lori's.

1477
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:18,420
Hearing that voice on Looney Tunes and Animaniacs,

1478
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:20,740
when I first saw Casablanca, I was like,

1479
00:53:20,740 --> 00:53:22,460
well, I know this guy.

1480
00:53:22,460 --> 00:53:23,980
I know this guy.

1481
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:25,940
And Ren and Stimpy.

1482
00:53:25,940 --> 00:53:27,780
And Ren and Stimpy, yeah, that's true.

1483
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:29,100
Oh, totally, right, right.

1484
00:53:30,060 --> 00:53:33,860
He might be, Bootberry might be my favorite,

1485
00:53:33,860 --> 00:53:36,780
just purely off of, I like the Peter and Lori thing,

1486
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:39,100
and then I love the half eyes.

1487
00:53:39,100 --> 00:53:41,500
I love just the glazed over,

1488
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:45,740
and he just looks like somebody who's trying to smile.

1489
00:53:45,740 --> 00:53:49,340
In his head, he's beaming, but he's just so sedate

1490
00:53:49,340 --> 00:53:54,140
that all he can do is kind of flat mouth, flat eyelids.

1491
00:53:54,140 --> 00:53:57,100
I just love his kind of doofy glaze.

1492
00:53:58,100 --> 00:53:58,940
I can see that.

1493
00:53:58,940 --> 00:54:02,820
Yeah, Bootberry is, I can see him being,

1494
00:54:02,820 --> 00:54:05,180
if these were first introduced to me now,

1495
00:54:05,180 --> 00:54:08,100
I think him or Fruit Brute would be my favorites.

1496
00:54:08,100 --> 00:54:09,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1497
00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:10,820
Well, and again, getting a little off

1498
00:54:10,820 --> 00:54:15,340
of the main protagonists, it's fun to like the side people.

1499
00:54:15,340 --> 00:54:18,260
He's also got the backstory that I'm most interested in.

1500
00:54:18,260 --> 00:54:22,020
I get how Frankenberry came to be.

1501
00:54:22,020 --> 00:54:24,100
I'm like, how did Bootberry die?

1502
00:54:24,140 --> 00:54:27,340
Wait, well, how did Frankenberry come to be

1503
00:54:27,340 --> 00:54:28,180
in your estimation?

1504
00:54:28,180 --> 00:54:29,140
God, he's Frankenberry's monster.

1505
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:30,580
Someone constructed him, right?

1506
00:54:30,580 --> 00:54:33,980
Oh, to be like, we're gonna build a monster with a,

1507
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:36,860
who is, who likes strawberries.

1508
00:54:36,860 --> 00:54:40,860
Instead of a taste for killing and might,

1509
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:42,540
it's a taste for strawberries.

1510
00:54:42,540 --> 00:54:43,980
But Bootberry, yeah, wait,

1511
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:48,660
so is it a dead blueberry enthusiast?

1512
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:53,100
Well, is it like it's the Casper-esque?

1513
00:54:53,140 --> 00:54:53,980
Yeah, literally.

1514
00:54:53,980 --> 00:54:55,700
Right, like his parents were ghosts,

1515
00:54:55,700 --> 00:54:57,140
so he was born a ghost?

1516
00:54:57,140 --> 00:54:58,100
Is that what happened to Casper?

1517
00:54:58,100 --> 00:54:58,940
Is that it?

1518
00:54:59,860 --> 00:55:01,020
Was Casper-

1519
00:55:01,020 --> 00:55:01,860
Casper was killed.

1520
00:55:01,860 --> 00:55:04,780
The movie was a child who passed away.

1521
00:55:04,780 --> 00:55:06,780
Who got sick. Yeah, who got sick.

1522
00:55:06,780 --> 00:55:07,620
Yeah.

1523
00:55:07,620 --> 00:55:10,300
And then he just keeps asking Christina Ricci as a ghost,

1524
00:55:10,300 --> 00:55:11,460
can I keep you?

1525
00:55:13,140 --> 00:55:13,980
Can I keep you?

1526
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:15,540
This is unfinished business.

1527
00:55:15,540 --> 00:55:16,380
That's stuck in Jason's head.

1528
00:55:16,380 --> 00:55:17,660
That's haunted me for you.

1529
00:55:17,660 --> 00:55:19,940
That's the Bootberry that haunts my mind.

1530
00:55:19,940 --> 00:55:21,940
Jason said, now, Jason says that, quote,

1531
00:55:21,980 --> 00:55:23,420
once an episode, I think.

1532
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:27,420
Oh yeah, yeah, that's a 10-timers club.

1533
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:31,020
Or if you get free samples of sweets and cereals,

1534
00:55:31,020 --> 00:55:31,860
can I keep you?

1535
00:55:31,860 --> 00:55:33,420
Yeah, I say it to Truffles,

1536
00:55:33,420 --> 00:55:36,340
the Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory there.

1537
00:55:36,340 --> 00:55:37,940
I don't blame you for that.

1538
00:55:37,940 --> 00:55:38,780
Yeah, that makes sense.

1539
00:55:38,780 --> 00:55:40,620
Bootberry also has a little hat,

1540
00:55:40,620 --> 00:55:41,900
he has a little bow tie,

1541
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:43,620
but I feel like one of the articles,

1542
00:55:43,620 --> 00:55:46,180
there's an oral history in Mel magazine about this,

1543
00:55:46,180 --> 00:55:47,660
and it might've been pointed out there

1544
00:55:47,660 --> 00:55:49,620
that in Bootberry's first appearance,

1545
00:55:49,620 --> 00:55:50,900
he's got a chain.

1546
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:53,580
Similar to Jacob Marley.

1547
00:55:53,580 --> 00:55:54,420
Oh yeah.

1548
00:55:54,420 --> 00:55:55,860
The chains he forged in life.

1549
00:55:57,300 --> 00:55:58,500
So he's evil then.

1550
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:01,460
He was keeping all the blueberries for himself

1551
00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:03,180
in a way Jacob Marley was.

1552
00:56:03,180 --> 00:56:05,220
Kicking people out of their homes, I think.

1553
00:56:05,220 --> 00:56:06,580
If they don't have anywhere to go,

1554
00:56:06,580 --> 00:56:08,540
they could go to the debtor's prison.

1555
00:56:10,380 --> 00:56:13,460
They definitely took away Bootberry's edge as well.

1556
00:56:13,460 --> 00:56:14,860
We've talked about this in many characters,

1557
00:56:14,860 --> 00:56:17,300
Mickey Mouse, they had edge to start with,

1558
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:18,740
and then they softened it.

1559
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:22,340
Bootberry certainly had that crazy Peter Lorre voice,

1560
00:56:22,340 --> 00:56:23,180
and he had the chains,

1561
00:56:23,180 --> 00:56:26,420
and then they did make him very Casper in the 90s

1562
00:56:26,420 --> 00:56:30,300
when he was cross promoting the Casper movies,

1563
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:33,260
the direct to DVD sequels, or direct to VHS sequels.

1564
00:56:33,260 --> 00:56:35,140
Casper meets Wendy with Hillary.

1565
00:56:35,140 --> 00:56:36,460
Yeah.

1566
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:38,420
Casper was on the box,

1567
00:56:38,420 --> 00:56:40,540
which I hate to get,

1568
00:56:40,540 --> 00:56:43,140
I saw a picture, I sent this to you guys,

1569
00:56:43,140 --> 00:56:45,740
Tony the Tiger Avatar serial.

1570
00:56:45,740 --> 00:56:47,020
Oh, this is related, go for it.

1571
00:56:47,060 --> 00:56:49,020
This supposedly exists right now,

1572
00:56:49,020 --> 00:56:50,180
and I've been looking for it,

1573
00:56:50,180 --> 00:56:52,460
and I can't find it in the Southern California area,

1574
00:56:52,460 --> 00:56:53,940
so if I haven't by this time,

1575
00:56:53,940 --> 00:56:56,940
if somebody can tweet at me locations in Southern California

1576
00:56:56,940 --> 00:56:58,020
where I can get this, I need it.

1577
00:56:58,020 --> 00:57:01,740
Wait, and the box art is like Tony the Tiger as a Navi?

1578
00:57:01,740 --> 00:57:03,860
Yes, dressed up. That's incredible.

1579
00:57:03,860 --> 00:57:07,780
Yeah, wait, his physical makeup has not changed.

1580
00:57:07,780 --> 00:57:08,780
Remind us. Right, right.

1581
00:57:08,780 --> 00:57:09,740
He has not gone into,

1582
00:57:09,740 --> 00:57:12,460
Tony the Tiger has not gone into the Avatar program.

1583
00:57:12,460 --> 00:57:14,900
He's not in the machine, okay.

1584
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:16,540
Although it should be one of these sequels,

1585
00:57:16,700 --> 00:57:18,260
why not? Yeah, sure.

1586
00:57:19,140 --> 00:57:22,260
Let me see, I just wanna see a picture of the box here.

1587
00:57:23,260 --> 00:57:26,100
Is this, this isn't even like a Google search.

1588
00:57:26,100 --> 00:57:28,380
I saw this on one, unless somebody is really screwing

1589
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:30,180
with me or screwing with the public.

1590
00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:33,180
Our audience noticed it, I know that.

1591
00:57:33,180 --> 00:57:34,620
Our audience is aware.

1592
00:57:36,540 --> 00:57:38,220
But wait, are the flakes blue?

1593
00:57:38,220 --> 00:57:41,380
How else does the Avatar theme manifest?

1594
00:57:41,380 --> 00:57:45,460
There's sweeties, aren't there blue sweeties?

1595
00:57:46,780 --> 00:57:48,860
Navi sweeties.

1596
00:57:48,860 --> 00:57:50,020
I'm looking, I'm looking, I'm looking.

1597
00:57:50,020 --> 00:57:51,380
Mighty sweeties.

1598
00:57:52,740 --> 00:57:55,020
Okay, this is, unless somebody made this up,

1599
00:57:55,020 --> 00:57:58,740
it says family size Avatar with the Avatar logo.

1600
00:57:58,740 --> 00:58:03,220
Tony the Tiger is there, he's got a blue Avatar bandana,

1601
00:58:03,220 --> 00:58:05,500
and it says over the frosted flakes,

1602
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:07,940
it says Pandora flakes.

1603
00:58:07,940 --> 00:58:09,540
They cross it out.

1604
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:12,660
This could be completely fake,

1605
00:58:12,660 --> 00:58:14,860
and God bless them if it is.

1606
00:58:14,860 --> 00:58:18,140
It doesn't start, it's not alliterative, it doesn't rhyme.

1607
00:58:18,140 --> 00:58:19,140
Got nothing there.

1608
00:58:20,540 --> 00:58:22,860
I really hope that, I could be getting fooled,

1609
00:58:22,860 --> 00:58:26,420
and I love being fooled, so kudos if you fooled me.

1610
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:28,020
Is this a big prank?

1611
00:58:28,020 --> 00:58:31,500
Is it a commentary on how it would be a little weird

1612
00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:34,420
if there was a lot of like food Avatar,

1613
00:58:34,420 --> 00:58:36,260
we don't know what the Avatar promotional effort

1614
00:58:36,260 --> 00:58:40,540
is gonna be really, if there is much.

1615
00:58:40,540 --> 00:58:41,780
Hmm, we'll see.

1616
00:58:41,780 --> 00:58:44,380
Well look, I've fallen for the Mickey Rooney

1617
00:58:44,380 --> 00:58:48,180
potato restaurant at least twice, so you know.

1618
00:58:48,180 --> 00:58:49,020
It happens to the best of us.

1619
00:58:49,020 --> 00:58:52,740
We want to believe, we're Fox Mulders here,

1620
00:58:52,740 --> 00:58:53,580
we want to believe.

1621
00:58:53,580 --> 00:58:54,660
We want to believe.

1622
00:58:57,860 --> 00:59:00,540
Let me bring something into the,

1623
00:59:00,540 --> 00:59:03,860
this is sort of Boo Berry related,

1624
00:59:03,860 --> 00:59:06,140
but it's kind of the aftermath of the commercial.

1625
00:59:06,140 --> 00:59:09,380
It's not really, but it's themed after him.

1626
00:59:09,380 --> 00:59:12,660
Jordan, if you could pull up the clip Boo Prize,

1627
00:59:12,660 --> 00:59:13,500
is the label.

1628
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:15,540
A lot of these commercials have that format

1629
00:59:15,540 --> 00:59:17,780
of the animated part is a little rushed,

1630
00:59:17,780 --> 00:59:20,700
and then there is the tail of it,

1631
00:59:20,700 --> 00:59:23,140
where there's the prize that you can get in the box,

1632
00:59:23,140 --> 00:59:25,700
and this one is, this is so delightful to me.

1633
00:59:28,220 --> 00:59:30,540
And look and listen to this.

1634
00:59:30,540 --> 00:59:31,900
A Boo Hooter.

1635
00:59:31,900 --> 00:59:33,940
Boo your friends with crazy hoots.

1636
00:59:33,940 --> 00:59:35,620
Four different colored Boo Hooters,

1637
00:59:35,620 --> 00:59:37,900
so you can make a Boo Hooter band.

1638
00:59:37,900 --> 00:59:40,700
One free in specially marked boxes of Boo Berry.

1639
00:59:42,380 --> 00:59:43,860
Boo your friends.

1640
00:59:43,860 --> 00:59:48,380
Boo your friends with crazy hoots.

1641
00:59:48,380 --> 00:59:49,940
I was talking about this with my wife last night,

1642
00:59:49,940 --> 00:59:51,580
that we gotta do some,

1643
00:59:53,620 --> 00:59:58,020
we gotta do some breaking down of the roots of the,

1644
00:59:58,020 --> 01:00:01,140
boo is the verb, but hoots is the,

1645
01:00:01,140 --> 01:00:03,580
so hooting is what you do with a Boo Hooter,

1646
01:00:03,580 --> 01:00:07,580
except wait, no, you boo them with hoots.

1647
01:00:07,620 --> 01:00:08,940
I'm not sure which is which.

1648
01:00:08,940 --> 01:00:11,780
I'm pretty, I am lost in the magic of this.

1649
01:00:11,780 --> 01:00:12,860
Yeah. Yeah.

1650
01:00:12,860 --> 01:00:13,700
That might be, Mike,

1651
01:00:13,700 --> 01:00:16,340
that might be what you're getting in the box,

1652
01:00:16,340 --> 01:00:18,100
in 10 weeks.

1653
01:00:18,100 --> 01:00:20,460
If it's a Boo Hooter, I mean, I'll be thrilled.

1654
01:00:20,460 --> 01:00:21,300
Boo my friends.

1655
01:00:22,420 --> 01:00:23,260
Yeah.

1656
01:00:23,260 --> 01:00:24,100
Hey guys, can you get in here?

1657
01:00:24,100 --> 01:00:26,780
But it's the cause version of a Boo Hooter.

1658
01:00:26,780 --> 01:00:28,420
Just got no pupils or something.

1659
01:00:29,420 --> 01:00:33,260
Wait, cause figured out a way to reinvent Boo Hooters.

1660
01:00:33,260 --> 01:00:35,140
I never thought I could boo my friends

1661
01:00:35,140 --> 01:00:37,300
with crazy hoots like this.

1662
01:00:38,140 --> 01:00:40,580
Boo Hooters, that is the time where it's like,

1663
01:00:40,580 --> 01:00:44,700
that is a type of prize where it's like broke

1664
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:47,100
and people got chunks of it in the cereal

1665
01:00:47,100 --> 01:00:47,940
and they're like, all right,

1666
01:00:47,940 --> 01:00:50,100
well we're putting it next to the bag now.

1667
01:00:50,100 --> 01:00:52,380
We're not putting it in the bag of cereal.

1668
01:00:52,380 --> 01:00:55,060
It looks exactly like a broken piece of this

1669
01:00:55,060 --> 01:00:57,300
is as fake looking as the sweeties.

1670
01:00:57,300 --> 01:00:59,740
So yeah, you'd chew a Boo Hooter.

1671
01:00:59,740 --> 01:01:00,580
Yeah.

1672
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:03,660
Get stuck in your throat and then all you can,

1673
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:06,300
all of your talking is booing and hooting.

1674
01:01:06,660 --> 01:01:07,740
They're also working overtime

1675
01:01:07,740 --> 01:01:09,820
to make that a spooky prize.

1676
01:01:09,820 --> 01:01:11,100
Like it's a kazoo.

1677
01:01:11,100 --> 01:01:13,060
You should be like, start a band with your friends.

1678
01:01:13,060 --> 01:01:13,900
Start a monster.

1679
01:01:13,900 --> 01:01:16,660
It's like scare the shit out of them with this Boo Hooter.

1680
01:01:16,660 --> 01:01:17,540
Yeah.

1681
01:01:17,540 --> 01:01:18,820
The scariest sound.

1682
01:01:18,820 --> 01:01:20,460
I guess when you get all ready for it,

1683
01:01:20,460 --> 01:01:23,140
I'm gonna fuck my mom up today.

1684
01:01:23,140 --> 01:01:23,980
Just wait.

1685
01:01:23,980 --> 01:01:25,900
I'm gonna right at the top of the stairs.

1686
01:01:25,900 --> 01:01:27,940
She's gonna regret buying me this cereal.

1687
01:01:27,940 --> 01:01:28,780
Oh no.

1688
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:32,900
Is that what happens in Garden State?

1689
01:01:32,900 --> 01:01:34,220
With a bomb.

1690
01:01:34,220 --> 01:01:35,060
No.

1691
01:01:35,220 --> 01:01:39,420
Oh, then with a dishwasher, he does a Boo Hooter.

1692
01:01:39,420 --> 01:01:41,260
You need to let go of this dad.

1693
01:01:41,260 --> 01:01:43,060
It happened, okay?

1694
01:01:43,060 --> 01:01:43,900
I blew my Boo Hooter.

1695
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:44,740
You gotta get this song, you'll change your life

1696
01:01:44,740 --> 01:01:45,820
and it's just a Boo Hooter.

1697
01:01:45,820 --> 01:01:49,300
That's what the headphones play.

1698
01:01:49,300 --> 01:01:50,620
Food, food.

1699
01:01:53,780 --> 01:01:56,900
The shins are one of those reputable Boo Hooter bands.

1700
01:01:56,900 --> 01:01:59,780
They were just a bunch of friends who wanted to boo and hoot.

1701
01:01:59,780 --> 01:02:02,940
All brought their Boo Hooters and started jamming.

1702
01:02:03,140 --> 01:02:06,500
Sub Pop, the head of Sub Pop was walking by.

1703
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:08,740
Hoots Too Narrow, the original.

1704
01:02:08,740 --> 01:02:12,740
There's that Tom and Jerry movie where they're

1705
01:02:12,740 --> 01:02:14,820
watching the Wizard of Oz happen.

1706
01:02:14,820 --> 01:02:16,700
There should be a Garden State animated version

1707
01:02:16,700 --> 01:02:19,620
where just Boo Barry is watching all of it play out.

1708
01:02:21,140 --> 01:02:23,700
Oh, don't push her, really open dishwasher.

1709
01:02:23,700 --> 01:02:25,540
And influencing everything that happens.

1710
01:02:25,540 --> 01:02:26,380
That's the origin.

1711
01:02:26,380 --> 01:02:28,220
Didn't he grow up in the early 70s?

1712
01:02:28,220 --> 01:02:31,580
Isn't it possible that Boo Barry is Zach Pfeffer's

1713
01:02:31,580 --> 01:02:32,580
dead mother?

1714
01:02:33,220 --> 01:02:34,060
Very possible.

1715
01:02:34,060 --> 01:02:36,260
That's the next story, great.

1716
01:02:36,260 --> 01:02:37,100
I think that's right.

1717
01:02:37,100 --> 01:02:40,660
Who knew these universes tied together so seamlessly?

1718
01:02:44,060 --> 01:02:47,180
Oh boy, okay, so we've tackled that one, now we know.

1719
01:02:47,180 --> 01:02:49,580
But now we move on to number four,

1720
01:02:49,580 --> 01:02:51,820
who is maybe the toughest nut to crack

1721
01:02:51,820 --> 01:02:53,660
and that is Fruit Brute.

1722
01:02:54,740 --> 01:02:58,100
Fruit Brute is where, what monster comes next?

1723
01:02:58,100 --> 01:03:01,020
Well, it's gotta be Wolfman, that's the big one left.

1724
01:03:01,020 --> 01:03:05,460
But he is a colorful, fruit-oriented Wolfman.

1725
01:03:05,460 --> 01:03:08,260
Yes, Brute specifically.

1726
01:03:08,260 --> 01:03:12,300
A Brute who does not, if you just heard the name,

1727
01:03:12,300 --> 01:03:14,740
you might not picture a Wolfman offhand

1728
01:03:14,740 --> 01:03:16,780
and he's back in Mike's frame.

1729
01:03:16,780 --> 01:03:18,860
He's a lot of fun, he's got sort of,

1730
01:03:18,860 --> 01:03:21,620
I mean this is a Sid and Marty Croft character

1731
01:03:21,620 --> 01:03:25,820
and color scheme, we're getting 70s psychedelic.

1732
01:03:25,820 --> 01:03:28,260
He's great and that name is perfect.

1733
01:03:28,260 --> 01:03:30,140
You're gonna go to Wolfman regardless

1734
01:03:30,140 --> 01:03:33,740
because that's like Dracula, Frankenstein, Wolfman.

1735
01:03:33,740 --> 01:03:35,540
And Fruit Brute, someone must have been thrilled

1736
01:03:35,540 --> 01:03:37,980
when they realized that that rhymed.

1737
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:38,940
It's pretty good, yeah.

1738
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:40,260
Because what else, I don't know how else

1739
01:03:40,260 --> 01:03:41,100
you're gonna make Wolfman. What other flavor

1740
01:03:41,100 --> 01:03:42,660
are you gonna do and what other monster are you gonna do?

1741
01:03:42,660 --> 01:03:43,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1742
01:03:44,940 --> 01:03:47,180
Yeah, I mean we ended up with Yummy Mummy,

1743
01:03:47,180 --> 01:03:50,860
that's a clean rhyme, but it's less inventive

1744
01:03:50,860 --> 01:03:52,180
than Fruit Brute.

1745
01:03:52,180 --> 01:03:53,380
Yummy Mummy, it is a little crass,

1746
01:03:53,380 --> 01:03:57,340
but that, I heard that as like a predecessor to MILF,

1747
01:03:57,340 --> 01:03:58,660
calling someone a Yummy Mummy.

1748
01:03:59,300 --> 01:04:00,540
Oh.

1749
01:04:00,540 --> 01:04:02,940
I remember an adult saying that to me

1750
01:04:02,940 --> 01:04:05,380
about a friend of my mom's when I was a child,

1751
01:04:05,380 --> 01:04:07,700
I don't know, even at 12 I was like,

1752
01:04:07,700 --> 01:04:10,100
we shouldn't be having this conversation.

1753
01:04:10,100 --> 01:04:10,940
No.

1754
01:04:10,940 --> 01:04:12,180
Yeah, it's a Yummy Mummy.

1755
01:04:13,700 --> 01:04:15,860
But wait, this is about your mom?

1756
01:04:15,860 --> 01:04:18,260
A friend of my mom's, a female friend

1757
01:04:18,260 --> 01:04:20,180
and then an adult's like, that's a Yummy Mummy.

1758
01:04:20,180 --> 01:04:21,220
Oh my God.

1759
01:04:21,220 --> 01:04:23,020
It's gonna be like, hell yeah, baby.

1760
01:04:25,020 --> 01:04:27,740
If my son overhears this about.

1761
01:04:27,740 --> 01:04:30,260
That did not make it into Tarantino movies

1762
01:04:30,260 --> 01:04:32,540
and the way that Fruit Brute is in the background,

1763
01:04:32,540 --> 01:04:34,260
but you would think.

1764
01:04:34,260 --> 01:04:36,460
Oh yes, hey wait, I got the still of that.

1765
01:04:36,460 --> 01:04:37,300
Let's pull that up.

1766
01:04:37,300 --> 01:04:38,140
There's a couple stills.

1767
01:04:38,140 --> 01:04:38,980
Tarantino.

1768
01:04:38,980 --> 01:04:39,820
Yeah, two.

1769
01:04:39,820 --> 01:04:42,260
Yeah, here we go, Circled.

1770
01:04:42,260 --> 01:04:45,940
In both Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction,

1771
01:04:45,940 --> 01:04:48,380
there's a thing that ties them both together,

1772
01:04:48,380 --> 01:04:52,100
a box of Fruit Brute, one in Tim Roth's apartment

1773
01:04:52,100 --> 01:04:55,420
in Reservoir Dogs and then it's Eric Stoltz

1774
01:04:55,460 --> 01:05:00,460
in the place where the dreaded injection occurs,

1775
01:05:02,220 --> 01:05:04,900
which maybe that, I don't know what's in the adrenaline

1776
01:05:04,900 --> 01:05:07,620
exactly, but maybe it's liquefied fruit.

1777
01:05:07,620 --> 01:05:08,460
Fruit Brute.

1778
01:05:08,460 --> 01:05:09,300
Yeah, yeah.

1779
01:05:09,300 --> 01:05:10,140
Yeah.

1780
01:05:10,140 --> 01:05:12,580
Just need to stick you with a needle full of sweetie.

1781
01:05:12,580 --> 01:05:13,980
Pure liquid sweetie.

1782
01:05:15,900 --> 01:05:19,380
So that's, which is in that very,

1783
01:05:19,380 --> 01:05:22,100
what a time the 90s were, this is just something

1784
01:05:22,100 --> 01:05:26,380
that Gen X all decided was cereals are fun,

1785
01:05:26,380 --> 01:05:31,380
a big facet of Seinfeld, I feel, and Tarantino evidently.

1786
01:05:32,260 --> 01:05:35,460
Yeah, then this was a good reference back then.

1787
01:05:36,620 --> 01:05:40,060
This was like, oh wow, this guy really knows his cereals.

1788
01:05:40,060 --> 01:05:43,340
Unexplored in films that are already full

1789
01:05:43,340 --> 01:05:45,660
of a lot of nostalgia and food talk

1790
01:05:45,660 --> 01:05:47,540
and then there's little Easter eggs

1791
01:05:47,540 --> 01:05:49,300
that I didn't know about these.

1792
01:05:49,300 --> 01:05:51,740
I didn't know about Fruit Brute's presence.

1793
01:05:51,740 --> 01:05:53,860
Yeah, I didn't realize that either.

1794
01:05:53,860 --> 01:05:55,580
I don't know, Tarantino's got a podcast now.

1795
01:05:55,580 --> 01:05:57,580
He has, I don't think, I have not heard every episode,

1796
01:05:57,580 --> 01:05:59,140
but he is, I don't think he's addressed

1797
01:05:59,140 --> 01:06:01,420
the Fruit Brute appearances.

1798
01:06:01,420 --> 01:06:05,700
I imagine, they're probably all like six hours long, right?

1799
01:06:05,700 --> 01:06:06,700
They're longer.

1800
01:06:06,700 --> 01:06:09,700
I think, yeah, are they longer than some podcasts,

1801
01:06:09,700 --> 01:06:11,820
the ride episodes about, you know,

1802
01:06:11,820 --> 01:06:13,700
like a kiosk in a mall somewhere?

1803
01:06:13,700 --> 01:06:16,180
I don't know, but they are pretty long

1804
01:06:16,180 --> 01:06:18,100
and he obviously has a lot of thoughts,

1805
01:06:18,100 --> 01:06:20,940
but I would be interested in a three hour episode

1806
01:06:20,940 --> 01:06:23,020
of him just rambling about Fruit Brute.

1807
01:06:23,020 --> 01:06:25,460
Maybe we could get him on to just talk Fruit Brute.

1808
01:06:25,460 --> 01:06:26,300
We don't make him do it.

1809
01:06:26,300 --> 01:06:27,380
We're not gonna talk about your movie.

1810
01:06:27,380 --> 01:06:29,100
We're not gonna pester you with questions.

1811
01:06:29,100 --> 01:06:30,220
It's all, yeah.

1812
01:06:30,220 --> 01:06:33,380
He was very, they had a,

1813
01:06:33,380 --> 01:06:35,860
Paul Scheer and Amy Nicholson interviewed him

1814
01:06:35,860 --> 01:06:38,860
and Roger Avery and he had a lot of thoughts

1815
01:06:38,860 --> 01:06:40,740
about movie theater candy.

1816
01:06:40,740 --> 01:06:42,340
Oh, I bet he does, yeah.

1817
01:06:42,340 --> 01:06:46,020
The New Beverly, the repertory theater he bought

1818
01:06:46,020 --> 01:06:48,220
has a very good concession stand.

1819
01:06:49,220 --> 01:06:50,060
Oh yeah.

1820
01:06:50,060 --> 01:06:51,660
Very good candy selection.

1821
01:06:51,660 --> 01:06:53,260
Not expensive either.

1822
01:06:53,260 --> 01:06:56,660
Very inexpensive, but like you can still get snowcaps there.

1823
01:06:56,660 --> 01:06:58,860
You can still get cherry Coke there.

1824
01:06:58,860 --> 01:07:01,220
I think you can get White Castle hamburgers there.

1825
01:07:01,220 --> 01:07:02,820
You might be able to get a microwave

1826
01:07:02,820 --> 01:07:03,660
White Castle hamburger. They have like real

1827
01:07:03,660 --> 01:07:05,580
like diner coffee there too.

1828
01:07:05,580 --> 01:07:06,660
Really? Yeah.

1829
01:07:06,660 --> 01:07:08,460
Wow, just good old basic, wow.

1830
01:07:08,460 --> 01:07:12,460
This is sort of like, it's kind of a Tarantino restaurant

1831
01:07:12,460 --> 01:07:15,180
or kind of a Tarantino themed experience in a way.

1832
01:07:15,180 --> 01:07:18,620
Like the clothes, because there has not been like a pop-up.

1833
01:07:18,620 --> 01:07:20,180
Have they ever done like the, you know,

1834
01:07:20,180 --> 01:07:22,380
some version of the restaurant from Pulp Fiction,

1835
01:07:22,380 --> 01:07:23,380
the like nostalgia?

1836
01:07:23,380 --> 01:07:26,300
I feel like somebody unofficially has done it

1837
01:07:26,300 --> 01:07:28,820
and it's always, you can like smell

1838
01:07:28,820 --> 01:07:30,540
the not authenticity on it.

1839
01:07:30,540 --> 01:07:32,100
I could be wrong, but it's always like,

1840
01:07:32,100 --> 01:07:35,020
this Tarantino bar and you're like,

1841
01:07:35,020 --> 01:07:39,220
eh, I think this isn't like.

1842
01:07:39,220 --> 01:07:41,940
I would be thrilled for you guys if you got Tarantino

1843
01:07:41,940 --> 01:07:43,180
to come on and talk about Fruit Fruit.

1844
01:07:43,180 --> 01:07:45,460
It probably would not do much for my general

1845
01:07:45,460 --> 01:07:47,100
Mills Monsters episode.

1846
01:07:48,700 --> 01:07:50,020
Yes, suddenly, oh no.

1847
01:07:50,020 --> 01:07:52,380
Yeah, that's the last thing we want is to dwarf.

1848
01:07:53,300 --> 01:07:55,140
We'll delete this episode if he comes on.

1849
01:07:55,140 --> 01:07:56,540
If you can do it, do it.

1850
01:07:57,980 --> 01:08:00,220
Doesn't apply anymore, doesn't it?

1851
01:08:00,220 --> 01:08:01,820
It seems unlikely to me.

1852
01:08:01,820 --> 01:08:04,420
This, as far as I'm concerned, this is the Fruit Brutes.

1853
01:08:04,420 --> 01:08:05,620
Yeah, I don't know.

1854
01:08:05,620 --> 01:08:09,540
He might be down if we make it easy on him.

1855
01:08:09,540 --> 01:08:11,740
No, no, no, this, look, you are reigning supreme

1856
01:08:11,740 --> 01:08:14,820
in the Fruit Brute episode as far as I'm concerned.

1857
01:08:15,780 --> 01:08:18,140
What else about Fruit, I don't know

1858
01:08:18,220 --> 01:08:19,900
whether to call him Fruit or Brute.

1859
01:08:21,260 --> 01:08:23,500
I mean, he suffers from not having

1860
01:08:23,500 --> 01:08:25,260
a specific flavor identity.

1861
01:08:25,260 --> 01:08:26,100
This is the issue.

1862
01:08:26,100 --> 01:08:28,860
The Fruit Brute name is too good to lose,

1863
01:08:28,860 --> 01:08:31,380
but it's just, it's so general.

1864
01:08:31,380 --> 01:08:34,540
And again, the flavor itself is not Fruity Pebbles level.

1865
01:08:34,540 --> 01:08:39,020
So he just, he's always going to flounder, I think,

1866
01:08:39,020 --> 01:08:39,860
because of that.

1867
01:08:39,860 --> 01:08:42,100
I think, I don't know what to do

1868
01:08:42,100 --> 01:08:44,340
because Fruit Brute is too good of a name to let go,

1869
01:08:44,340 --> 01:08:47,100
but they either have to make it just taste like Fruity Pebbles

1870
01:08:47,140 --> 01:08:48,860
or figure out a way where each year

1871
01:08:48,860 --> 01:08:50,780
he cycles through a different fruit or something.

1872
01:08:50,780 --> 01:08:53,500
This year he's apricot, Fruit Brute is apricot.

1873
01:08:53,500 --> 01:08:56,900
They gotta do something to give him a good gimmick.

1874
01:08:56,900 --> 01:08:59,220
I agree that it would be great if it tasted like

1875
01:08:59,220 --> 01:09:01,260
Fruity Pebbles, but Fruit Loops and Fruity Pebbles

1876
01:09:01,260 --> 01:09:04,260
are just as vague a description as Fruit Brute is.

1877
01:09:04,260 --> 01:09:05,100
Yes, absolutely.

1878
01:09:05,100 --> 01:09:07,300
I'm just, I don't know what to do here.

1879
01:09:07,300 --> 01:09:08,780
I'm trying to help my guy out.

1880
01:09:10,300 --> 01:09:12,180
He's an underdog.

1881
01:09:12,180 --> 01:09:14,020
Yeah, kind of, in the dog family.

1882
01:09:14,020 --> 01:09:16,380
Underdog, yeah, that one.

1883
01:09:16,460 --> 01:09:18,340
So yeah, I think that's a big thing

1884
01:09:18,340 --> 01:09:20,340
because Count Chocula, Boo Berry,

1885
01:09:20,340 --> 01:09:23,580
Frankenberry, flavors, you know the flavors.

1886
01:09:23,580 --> 01:09:25,980
Oh, Frankenberry I'll say not necessarily.

1887
01:09:27,380 --> 01:09:28,220
Yeah, I didn't know.

1888
01:09:28,220 --> 01:09:30,500
Okay, that's true, you're right, you're right in the name,

1889
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:33,860
but the flavor itself is distinctly strawberry.

1890
01:09:33,860 --> 01:09:38,140
Yeah, and we're early, I think it was Count Chocula,

1891
01:09:38,140 --> 01:09:41,260
I saw the first chocolate cereal on the market.

1892
01:09:41,260 --> 01:09:42,100
Maybe.

1893
01:09:42,100 --> 01:09:42,940
Wow.

1894
01:09:42,940 --> 01:09:44,980
And I think Frankenberry, kind of an early,

1895
01:09:45,620 --> 01:09:46,820
strawberry cereal.

1896
01:09:46,820 --> 01:09:49,660
And Boo Berry, definitely the first blueberry cereal.

1897
01:09:49,660 --> 01:09:53,420
Yeah, but then, yeah Fruit Brute and Yummy Mummy after,

1898
01:09:54,940 --> 01:09:58,380
the characters are fun, the designs are good,

1899
01:09:58,380 --> 01:09:59,980
but they just don't hit,

1900
01:09:59,980 --> 01:10:02,660
they don't have the cereal backing them up.

1901
01:10:02,660 --> 01:10:05,300
Yeah, it's the flavor, it's all the flavor I think.

1902
01:10:05,300 --> 01:10:08,340
I like the choice of, all right, this one's cherry now.

1903
01:10:08,340 --> 01:10:10,900
It's like, okay, well that's at least a little more clear.

1904
01:10:10,900 --> 01:10:13,020
I don't know how good it is.

1905
01:10:13,020 --> 01:10:16,980
Oh yeah, I do have clarity on the change that happened.

1906
01:10:16,980 --> 01:10:20,700
Fruit Brute was lime, now is cherry,

1907
01:10:20,700 --> 01:10:23,540
Fruity Yummy Mummy, they had to kind of insert

1908
01:10:23,540 --> 01:10:24,660
Fruity unofficially. That's also converted some.

1909
01:10:24,660 --> 01:10:25,980
Yeah, yeah, too many,

1910
01:10:25,980 --> 01:10:28,820
but otherwise Yummy Mummy tells you nothing.

1911
01:10:28,820 --> 01:10:31,620
But, wait a minute, but when it was called

1912
01:10:31,620 --> 01:10:36,620
Fruity Yummy Mummy, it was vanilla, so that doesn't work.

1913
01:10:36,940 --> 01:10:38,460
That doesn't work, yeah, for lots of reasons.

1914
01:10:38,460 --> 01:10:41,460
Was that just the marshmallows were vanilla?

1915
01:10:41,460 --> 01:10:42,860
Or the sweeties?

1916
01:10:42,860 --> 01:10:46,340
I do not have information on whether it was marbets

1917
01:10:46,340 --> 01:10:48,100
or sweeties. Okay.

1918
01:10:48,100 --> 01:10:52,460
Now it is orange cream, which is also not a fruit.

1919
01:10:52,460 --> 01:10:55,060
Orange is, but not orange cream.

1920
01:10:55,060 --> 01:10:59,740
So it's confused identity, something that Count Chocolat

1921
01:10:59,740 --> 01:11:02,540
certainly does not, you know exactly what it is.

1922
01:11:02,540 --> 01:11:05,300
Can we talk about the unmade?

1923
01:11:05,300 --> 01:11:09,700
Did you come across the story of one of the artists

1924
01:11:09,780 --> 01:11:11,380
or designers in the late 90s,

1925
01:11:11,380 --> 01:11:14,860
they were considering adding another monster

1926
01:11:14,860 --> 01:11:18,140
and one artist was like really pitching,

1927
01:11:18,140 --> 01:11:20,940
Peter Bregman really had some pitches.

1928
01:11:20,940 --> 01:11:22,940
Jordan, can you bring up that picture I sent?

1929
01:11:22,940 --> 01:11:23,780
Here we go.

1930
01:11:23,780 --> 01:11:26,420
Some pitches of like who some of the other monsters

1931
01:11:26,420 --> 01:11:30,420
could be and kind of shows how like they had some

1932
01:11:30,420 --> 01:11:34,060
difficulty after you got past the first few guys.

1933
01:11:34,060 --> 01:11:37,580
Like, okay, what's the next monster?

1934
01:11:37,620 --> 01:11:40,140
How do we do this?

1935
01:11:40,140 --> 01:11:41,980
Okay, very great.

1936
01:11:41,980 --> 01:11:42,820
Ooh, okay.

1937
01:11:42,820 --> 01:11:43,860
These are good though.

1938
01:11:43,860 --> 01:11:46,780
Yeah, so these are, I mean, the drawings are nice,

1939
01:11:46,780 --> 01:11:49,180
but the names start to fall apart.

1940
01:11:49,180 --> 01:11:54,180
You've got Berry Patra, which is supposed to be Cleopatra.

1941
01:11:54,940 --> 01:11:56,780
Wait a minute, but we're looking at like,

1942
01:11:56,780 --> 01:11:58,460
this is a mummy.

1943
01:11:58,460 --> 01:12:01,060
Cleopatra is not a mummy, get out of here.

1944
01:12:01,060 --> 01:12:04,940
It's a mummified kind of Egyptian thing.

1945
01:12:04,940 --> 01:12:05,780
Yeah.

1946
01:12:05,780 --> 01:12:07,580
Cleopatra is dead, I'll give you that.

1947
01:12:07,580 --> 01:12:08,420
Yeah.

1948
01:12:08,420 --> 01:12:09,240
That's true.

1949
01:12:09,240 --> 01:12:11,940
Next to her, Dr. Jekyll Berry.

1950
01:12:11,940 --> 01:12:14,900
All right, he's got a cool design.

1951
01:12:14,900 --> 01:12:17,780
I think the design would be carrying him.

1952
01:12:17,780 --> 01:12:21,260
The other two I think are stronger, Phantom Berry.

1953
01:12:21,260 --> 01:12:24,380
Phantom Berry though just looks exactly like Darkwing Duck

1954
01:12:24,380 --> 01:12:25,820
with no duck face.

1955
01:12:25,820 --> 01:12:27,740
Oh, that's scary.

1956
01:12:27,740 --> 01:12:30,740
Yeah, and then Bride of Frankenberry.

1957
01:12:30,740 --> 01:12:34,860
So, you know, that might be the clearest sequel,

1958
01:12:34,860 --> 01:12:37,300
but she's not really pinkish

1959
01:12:37,300 --> 01:12:39,180
in the way that Frankenberry is pinkish.

1960
01:12:39,180 --> 01:12:44,180
She has a strawberry head like he has strawberry fingernails.

1961
01:12:44,180 --> 01:12:45,820
But I don't know, what does everyone think?

1962
01:12:45,820 --> 01:12:47,060
Do you have favorites?

1963
01:12:47,060 --> 01:12:50,140
I mean, it would be nice to get a female monster.

1964
01:12:50,140 --> 01:12:50,980
I don't get it.

1965
01:12:50,980 --> 01:12:53,540
Was Bride of Frankenberry also gonna be strawberry?

1966
01:12:53,540 --> 01:12:55,100
That seems like a wasted opportunity.

1967
01:12:55,100 --> 01:12:58,140
I think it was gonna be like mixed berry.

1968
01:12:58,140 --> 01:12:58,980
Oh, okay.

1969
01:12:58,980 --> 01:12:59,800
Or like-

1970
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:00,640
Oh, you know what you do-

1971
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:01,480
They gotta change her strawberry head then.

1972
01:13:01,480 --> 01:13:02,300
Yeah.

1973
01:13:02,300 --> 01:13:03,340
Yes, I was about to say,

1974
01:13:03,380 --> 01:13:06,740
maybe it's a bunch of grapes stacked up.

1975
01:13:06,740 --> 01:13:09,340
That gets you the height of Bride of Frankenstein.

1976
01:13:09,340 --> 01:13:11,140
You maybe start looking like Marge Simpson a little,

1977
01:13:11,140 --> 01:13:12,300
so that's tricky, but-

1978
01:13:12,300 --> 01:13:13,340
But grapes not berries.

1979
01:13:13,340 --> 01:13:14,180
Grape's not berries.

1980
01:13:14,180 --> 01:13:15,020
Marge Simpson.

1981
01:13:15,020 --> 01:13:15,840
Yeah, that's a good point.

1982
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:18,020
Oh, so a bunch of raspberries stacked up.

1983
01:13:18,020 --> 01:13:19,780
Then the color's not so Margeish.

1984
01:13:19,780 --> 01:13:21,660
But then that looks like something's like,

1985
01:13:21,660 --> 01:13:23,140
she has a disease, I think.

1986
01:13:23,140 --> 01:13:23,980
It's a big growth.

1987
01:13:23,980 --> 01:13:24,820
Something looks wrong.

1988
01:13:24,820 --> 01:13:26,820
I mean, I guess it all looks a little weird,

1989
01:13:26,820 --> 01:13:28,660
but like, I don't know.

1990
01:13:28,660 --> 01:13:31,580
Raspberries are like, I guess strawberries are furry too.

1991
01:13:31,660 --> 01:13:33,660
I guess you don't have to draw the fur on the raspberries.

1992
01:13:33,660 --> 01:13:35,460
I'm thinking of very specific,

1993
01:13:35,460 --> 01:13:38,340
realistic raspberries on a woman's head.

1994
01:13:38,340 --> 01:13:40,180
I can't imagine they would be.

1995
01:13:40,180 --> 01:13:41,020
There's a way that,

1996
01:13:41,020 --> 01:13:44,160
so we're thinking Bride of Frankenberry is salvageable.

1997
01:13:45,260 --> 01:13:46,100
Of all of these kinds of-

1998
01:13:46,100 --> 01:13:47,160
Well, it just makes the most sense.

1999
01:13:47,160 --> 01:13:50,500
I mean, we're not taking any major swings on this one,

2000
01:13:50,500 --> 01:13:53,620
but that's the one that makes at least thematic sense.

2001
01:13:53,620 --> 01:13:56,260
I like the design of Dr. Jekyllberry,

2002
01:13:56,260 --> 01:13:59,940
but aren't you kinda just attaching berry

2003
01:13:59,940 --> 01:14:02,140
to Dr. Jekyll, you know?

2004
01:14:02,140 --> 01:14:02,980
Well, I mean, that also needs to do something.

2005
01:14:02,980 --> 01:14:04,660
I'm not impressed with a lot of these.

2006
01:14:04,660 --> 01:14:07,420
Like, remember the Nintendo cereal

2007
01:14:07,420 --> 01:14:08,820
that was like half the box was Mario

2008
01:14:08,820 --> 01:14:11,220
and half the box was Legend of Zelda?

2009
01:14:11,220 --> 01:14:12,060
Oh, really?

2010
01:14:12,060 --> 01:14:12,880
Yeah.

2011
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:13,900
Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde needs to have

2012
01:14:13,900 --> 01:14:15,540
two separate chambers for two separate chambers.

2013
01:14:15,540 --> 01:14:16,780
Great idea, perfect.

2014
01:14:16,780 --> 01:14:17,620
Yes.

2015
01:14:17,620 --> 01:14:18,460
Or like a container of nerds.

2016
01:14:18,460 --> 01:14:19,700
The milk turned into a different color.

2017
01:14:19,700 --> 01:14:21,340
Yeah, exactly, like container of nerds.

2018
01:14:21,340 --> 01:14:22,660
Yeah, Dr. Jekyllberry,

2019
01:14:22,660 --> 01:14:24,980
we need to see what Mr. Hydeberry looks like.

2020
01:14:24,980 --> 01:14:25,900
That's right.

2021
01:14:25,900 --> 01:14:26,980
Yes, that's the key.

2022
01:14:26,980 --> 01:14:27,820
Yeah.

2023
01:14:27,820 --> 01:14:29,580
And he also, his design looks closer

2024
01:14:29,580 --> 01:14:32,540
to Victor Frankenstein than Dr. Jekyll, so.

2025
01:14:32,540 --> 01:14:34,100
Oh, true, yeah, yeah.

2026
01:14:34,100 --> 01:14:35,660
A lot of confusion.

2027
01:14:35,660 --> 01:14:40,260
Now, if they made him look like Russell Crowe's Dr. Jekyll

2028
01:14:40,260 --> 01:14:43,620
from the Dark Universe, I'd like that.

2029
01:14:43,620 --> 01:14:47,700
The head of the secret organization, as there always is.

2030
01:14:47,700 --> 01:14:50,780
This is also becoming, I feel like you are a little,

2031
01:14:50,780 --> 01:14:52,340
yeah, I think you like the Dark Universe.

2032
01:14:52,340 --> 01:14:53,940
I'm very curious.

2033
01:14:53,940 --> 01:14:56,100
I cannot remember what the ending of The Mummy is.

2034
01:14:56,100 --> 01:14:57,260
I think you like the Dark Universe, too.

2035
01:14:57,260 --> 01:15:01,900
But I am very intrigued by how much legwork they did

2036
01:15:01,900 --> 01:15:03,540
with the Dark Universe.

2037
01:15:03,540 --> 01:15:04,700
Is this gonna become?

2038
01:15:04,700 --> 01:15:07,260
He loves the Mummy movies, the Brendan Fraser Mummy movies.

2039
01:15:07,260 --> 01:15:08,100
Yeah.

2040
01:15:08,100 --> 01:15:08,940
Those are his favorite movies.

2041
01:15:08,940 --> 01:15:11,300
And I think him coming out recently and going like,

2042
01:15:11,300 --> 01:15:14,780
that Tom Cruise Mummy didn't seem very fun.

2043
01:15:14,780 --> 01:15:16,580
You know, ours were fun.

2044
01:15:16,580 --> 01:15:18,260
That's what I can say about them.

2045
01:15:18,260 --> 01:15:21,220
And he's like, well, he's got you there, you know?

2046
01:15:21,220 --> 01:15:23,380
The key to mummies, I guess.

2047
01:15:23,420 --> 01:15:28,020
Look, we've talked a lot about flavor profiles

2048
01:15:28,020 --> 01:15:33,020
and berry identities and who has a clear one

2049
01:15:33,060 --> 01:15:34,900
and who doesn't.

2050
01:15:34,900 --> 01:15:38,820
And Frankenberry, well, Mike, you said maybe not so clear

2051
01:15:38,820 --> 01:15:39,660
because we don't know what.

2052
01:15:39,660 --> 01:15:43,980
But if you look at them, you can figure out it's strawberry.

2053
01:15:43,980 --> 01:15:48,980
But this had a dark side, basically.

2054
01:15:49,500 --> 01:15:52,540
I think we maybe all landed on a-

2055
01:15:52,540 --> 01:15:56,060
We're all benign dark side as the study calls it.

2056
01:15:56,060 --> 01:15:58,260
Ultimately, yes.

2057
01:15:58,260 --> 01:16:01,860
But I was excited, Mike, when you DMed about this finding

2058
01:16:01,860 --> 01:16:04,660
because I hadn't stumbled on this yet.

2059
01:16:04,660 --> 01:16:07,380
Maybe I'll just read what you sent me.

2060
01:16:07,380 --> 01:16:10,220
It's just kind of the plain statement, which is,

2061
01:16:11,660 --> 01:16:15,940
in February, 1972, Frankenberry cereal included

2062
01:16:15,940 --> 01:16:18,220
an indigestible pigment that turned

2063
01:16:18,220 --> 01:16:20,420
some children's feces pink,

2064
01:16:20,460 --> 01:16:24,260
a symptom sometimes referred to as Frankenberry stool.

2065
01:16:25,140 --> 01:16:26,500
Yikes.

2066
01:16:26,500 --> 01:16:27,660
Christ almighty.

2067
01:16:27,660 --> 01:16:30,100
Frankenberry pink poop.

2068
01:16:30,100 --> 01:16:30,940
Oh my God.

2069
01:16:30,940 --> 01:16:33,540
It seems like it was very bright, too.

2070
01:16:33,540 --> 01:16:38,100
I think it has to be to cut through the murky color of poop

2071
01:16:38,100 --> 01:16:39,380
and turn it all the way pink.

2072
01:16:39,380 --> 01:16:40,220
I will say this.

2073
01:16:40,220 --> 01:16:43,660
This is still happening because I ate Trix

2074
01:16:43,660 --> 01:16:45,460
to get that Trix toy I showed you.

2075
01:16:45,460 --> 01:16:48,460
And I swear to you, my poop was green.

2076
01:16:48,460 --> 01:16:49,740
Oh no.

2077
01:16:49,780 --> 01:16:50,940
Oh yeah.

2078
01:16:50,940 --> 01:16:54,980
I ate that purple and green Halloween cake at Disneyland.

2079
01:16:55,860 --> 01:16:56,980
Oh yeah, you were?

2080
01:16:56,980 --> 01:16:57,820
Yeah.

2081
01:16:57,820 --> 01:16:59,140
Yeah, there's some colors.

2082
01:16:59,140 --> 01:17:02,100
I said this on the show before.

2083
01:17:02,100 --> 01:17:05,580
There was a Burger King, like a special Icy

2084
01:17:05,580 --> 01:17:07,740
they were doing maybe 20 years ago,

2085
01:17:07,740 --> 01:17:11,020
and it was like black, the black Icy you would get.

2086
01:17:11,020 --> 01:17:15,700
And I had it, and I shit neon blue.

2087
01:17:15,700 --> 01:17:17,100
From a black Icy?

2088
01:17:17,100 --> 01:17:18,140
It was insane.

2089
01:17:18,140 --> 01:17:19,620
It was either neon green or neon blue.

2090
01:17:20,460 --> 01:17:22,340
And I remember not putting two and two together.

2091
01:17:22,340 --> 01:17:24,340
It felt like forever, just looking down

2092
01:17:24,340 --> 01:17:26,620
and going, what is wrong?

2093
01:17:26,620 --> 01:17:28,260
But also it was a really, it was,

2094
01:17:29,620 --> 01:17:32,940
I wanted, it was a fun color for your shit to be.

2095
01:17:33,900 --> 01:17:36,060
So it wasn't alarming in the way of like,

2096
01:17:36,060 --> 01:17:38,420
you know this cannot be something,

2097
01:17:38,420 --> 01:17:41,580
something exterior, it has to be from outside of your body

2098
01:17:41,580 --> 01:17:43,300
because your body does not make the color

2099
01:17:43,300 --> 01:17:45,140
that's in the bowl right now when I'm looking at it.

2100
01:17:45,140 --> 01:17:47,700
Right, like neon anything.

2101
01:17:47,700 --> 01:17:49,540
Yeah, no, your body's not making neon.

2102
01:17:50,460 --> 01:17:51,780
I would steal your eyes from the toilet

2103
01:17:51,780 --> 01:17:52,620
because it's so bright.

2104
01:17:52,620 --> 01:17:55,380
I don't know if I would find that fun.

2105
01:17:55,380 --> 01:17:57,180
Your liver is not, yeah, your liver,

2106
01:17:57,180 --> 01:17:59,300
they're never like, oh no, your liver is producing

2107
01:17:59,300 --> 01:18:01,980
like neon bile or whatever your liver does.

2108
01:18:01,980 --> 01:18:03,180
Like that's so, yeah.

2109
01:18:03,180 --> 01:18:05,300
So I was like, what is going on?

2110
01:18:05,300 --> 01:18:06,940
And then I remembered, oh, you had a,

2111
01:18:06,940 --> 01:18:10,500
like you had a special Icy from Burger King.

2112
01:18:10,500 --> 01:18:11,340
Yeah.

2113
01:18:11,340 --> 01:18:13,020
But I'm impressed you put that together

2114
01:18:13,020 --> 01:18:15,180
because it was a black slushy and you were like,

2115
01:18:15,180 --> 01:18:17,300
oh, well that's why my shit's neon blue.

2116
01:18:17,300 --> 01:18:18,420
Oh yeah, color wheel.

2117
01:18:18,420 --> 01:18:19,700
Yeah, that adds up.

2118
01:18:19,700 --> 01:18:20,540
Yeah.

2119
01:18:20,540 --> 01:18:22,100
Oh, okay.

2120
01:18:22,100 --> 01:18:27,100
Black plus the color of your intestines equals neon blue.

2121
01:18:27,380 --> 01:18:30,260
I have a quote here from Jordan V. Payne,

2122
01:18:30,260 --> 01:18:33,460
the pediatrician and author of the study

2123
01:18:33,460 --> 01:18:35,540
benign red pigmentation of stool

2124
01:18:35,540 --> 01:18:38,460
resulting from food coloring in a new breakfast cereal,

2125
01:18:38,460 --> 01:18:40,060
the Frankenberry stool.

2126
01:18:40,060 --> 01:18:40,900
One of my favorites.

2127
01:18:40,900 --> 01:18:41,820
Yeah, it's a great study.

2128
01:18:41,820 --> 01:18:44,500
Yeah, he went off.

2129
01:18:44,500 --> 01:18:48,060
He snapped when he wrote this study,

2130
01:18:48,700 --> 01:18:51,140
but he said, I forget the name of the cereal,

2131
01:18:51,140 --> 01:18:53,540
frankincense or Frankenstein stew.

2132
01:18:53,540 --> 01:18:56,060
This is just something like that.

2133
01:18:56,060 --> 01:18:58,940
But it turned the boys stool red.

2134
01:18:58,940 --> 01:19:00,660
And then I wrote a small entry on it

2135
01:19:00,660 --> 01:19:03,500
in the journal of American Academy of Pediatrics.

2136
01:19:03,500 --> 01:19:06,180
No, this is just him talking to Mel magazine.

2137
01:19:06,180 --> 01:19:09,740
But I just love his contempt of like, I don't know,

2138
01:19:09,740 --> 01:19:10,580
what do kids eat?

2139
01:19:10,580 --> 01:19:12,140
Frankenstein stew?

2140
01:19:12,140 --> 01:19:14,220
Frankenstein stew.

2141
01:19:14,220 --> 01:19:16,820
Yeah, this little asshole was eating frankincense

2142
01:19:16,820 --> 01:19:18,580
and turned his shit red.

2143
01:19:19,660 --> 01:19:21,460
They have a tendency to do that.

2144
01:19:21,460 --> 01:19:25,500
These kids and their colorful stews, they can't stay away.

2145
01:19:25,500 --> 01:19:27,460
You need to eat a nutritious breakfast.

2146
01:19:27,460 --> 01:19:29,540
You can't have pink stew.

2147
01:19:29,540 --> 01:19:30,820
I mean, it's a bummer for General Mills

2148
01:19:30,820 --> 01:19:33,260
because like I did not search for that information.

2149
01:19:33,260 --> 01:19:35,460
It's on their very sparse Wikipedia page.

2150
01:19:35,460 --> 01:19:36,300
Yeah, yeah.

2151
01:19:36,300 --> 01:19:39,660
Not a ton of other information other than a paragraph.

2152
01:19:39,660 --> 01:19:41,700
It gets a lot of space.

2153
01:19:41,700 --> 01:19:43,020
It's front and center.

2154
01:19:43,020 --> 01:19:44,460
But the thing is like, kind of like Mike was saying,

2155
01:19:44,460 --> 01:19:46,620
like, if you know it's coming,

2156
01:19:47,460 --> 01:19:48,300
it could almost be a feature, not a bug.

2157
01:19:48,300 --> 01:19:50,220
Like it's kind of fun.

2158
01:19:50,220 --> 01:19:51,580
Yeah.

2159
01:19:51,580 --> 01:19:53,300
If you know that that's gonna happen.

2160
01:19:53,300 --> 01:19:54,140
One of the ways.

2161
01:19:54,140 --> 01:19:54,980
But if you're like, is that blood?

2162
01:19:54,980 --> 01:19:56,300
Like, why is it pink?

2163
01:19:56,300 --> 01:19:58,860
If you're like, what does this happen with?

2164
01:19:58,860 --> 01:20:02,620
Like beets sometimes turn your, I guess,

2165
01:20:02,620 --> 01:20:05,220
and I know that's coming if I have a lot of beets.

2166
01:20:05,220 --> 01:20:10,220
Beets, icing, like grocery store,

2167
01:20:10,460 --> 01:20:13,940
if you buy a birthday cake there, that icing might do it.

2168
01:20:13,940 --> 01:20:15,420
Like blue or green icing.

2169
01:20:16,420 --> 01:20:20,380
Well, some of this happens because of, it's dyes.

2170
01:20:20,380 --> 01:20:22,420
I mean, that's the common element in all of this.

2171
01:20:22,420 --> 01:20:24,300
If you eat a bunch of dye.

2172
01:20:25,380 --> 01:20:29,460
But, okay, wait, let me go through this in order a little bit.

2173
01:20:29,460 --> 01:20:31,100
This might've been the doctor who you were,

2174
01:20:31,100 --> 01:20:32,380
oh yes, this is Dr. Payne.

2175
01:20:32,380 --> 01:20:33,900
Okay, we're back to Dr. Payne.

2176
01:20:33,900 --> 01:20:36,660
Children love being taken to a pediatrician.

2177
01:20:36,660 --> 01:20:38,420
Well, is he nice?

2178
01:20:38,420 --> 01:20:42,420
Well, yeah, the general mills consider was like,

2179
01:20:42,420 --> 01:20:44,580
Dr. Payne, we'd like you to help us.

2180
01:20:45,540 --> 01:20:47,740
We'd like you to help us with a new endeavor.

2181
01:20:48,900 --> 01:20:51,460
You bring in nurse sharp tools.

2182
01:20:51,460 --> 01:20:53,660
We've got a licorice flavored cereal

2183
01:20:53,660 --> 01:20:56,020
that kids are just gonna revile.

2184
01:20:57,980 --> 01:21:00,220
So they did, this was this,

2185
01:21:00,220 --> 01:21:03,060
this started with a 12 year old boy in Maryland

2186
01:21:03,060 --> 01:21:04,780
and people didn't know what was happening.

2187
01:21:04,780 --> 01:21:06,020
The parents didn't know what was happening.

2188
01:21:06,020 --> 01:21:07,420
They were very alarmed.

2189
01:21:07,420 --> 01:21:09,900
And then they figured out, oh wait, what did he eat?

2190
01:21:09,900 --> 01:21:12,420
Huh, well, what did, okay, here's what we're gonna do.

2191
01:21:12,420 --> 01:21:14,460
We're gonna clear out his system

2192
01:21:14,460 --> 01:21:15,900
and then we're going to give him,

2193
01:21:15,900 --> 01:21:20,300
Dr. Payne will feed him four entire bowls of Frankenberry.

2194
01:21:20,300 --> 01:21:22,620
That is all he will have.

2195
01:21:22,620 --> 01:21:25,420
And then said Dr. Payne,

2196
01:21:25,420 --> 01:21:27,900
the stool had no abnormal odor

2197
01:21:27,900 --> 01:21:30,460
but it looked like strawberry ice cream.

2198
01:21:30,460 --> 01:21:33,820
God, which kind of like,

2199
01:21:33,820 --> 01:21:34,900
isn't there a thing in South Park

2200
01:21:34,900 --> 01:21:37,260
where there's the taco that poops ice cream?

2201
01:21:37,260 --> 01:21:40,780
Like they see a figure for like a imaginary figure.

2202
01:21:40,780 --> 01:21:42,140
So that's kind of nice.

2203
01:21:42,140 --> 01:21:45,620
Like say if you could poop strawberry ice cream.

2204
01:21:45,620 --> 01:21:47,300
He also gained the system where it's like,

2205
01:21:47,300 --> 01:21:50,140
okay, you can only eat Frankenberry for the next three days.

2206
01:21:50,140 --> 01:21:52,140
Like I would love to tell my mom,

2207
01:21:52,140 --> 01:21:53,340
I think I have Frankenberry stool.

2208
01:21:53,340 --> 01:21:55,420
I can only eat Frankenberry for science.

2209
01:21:56,540 --> 01:21:57,540
I have no choice.

2210
01:21:57,540 --> 01:21:58,380
They need me.

2211
01:21:58,380 --> 01:21:59,380
The doctor said he was gonna put.

2212
01:21:59,380 --> 01:22:01,260
It's my scientific duty.

2213
01:22:02,460 --> 01:22:04,620
I also love that you said people couldn't figure it out

2214
01:22:04,620 --> 01:22:06,420
as if it was the whole town's problem.

2215
01:22:07,500 --> 01:22:08,700
My son's shit is pink.

2216
01:22:09,700 --> 01:22:11,740
They like got door to door showing it.

2217
01:22:12,340 --> 01:22:13,180
What do you think it is?

2218
01:22:13,180 --> 01:22:14,780
Yeah, a Simpson's town hall style meeting

2219
01:22:14,780 --> 01:22:16,700
where everyone comes out.

2220
01:22:16,700 --> 01:22:18,660
Did you hear about the Murphy boy?

2221
01:22:18,660 --> 01:22:19,500
Oh no.

2222
01:22:19,500 --> 01:22:20,940
That's Frankenberry stool.

2223
01:22:20,940 --> 01:22:22,100
It's Frankenberry stool.

2224
01:22:22,100 --> 01:22:23,660
This is the talk of the town.

2225
01:22:24,940 --> 01:22:25,980
Just wanna update everyone.

2226
01:22:25,980 --> 01:22:27,180
It's 1203.

2227
01:22:27,180 --> 01:22:28,980
I did enter.

2228
01:22:28,980 --> 01:22:29,820
Oh!

2229
01:22:29,820 --> 01:22:33,340
I did enter with one hand, with a dog on my lap.

2230
01:22:33,340 --> 01:22:34,660
Garfield has joined the conversation.

2231
01:22:34,660 --> 01:22:35,780
The shivering dog in the other hand.

2232
01:22:35,780 --> 01:22:37,060
He's shivering.

2233
01:22:37,060 --> 01:22:38,940
Sometimes he does this for attention.

2234
01:22:38,980 --> 01:22:42,260
He's got a flannel shirt on and was on a blanket.

2235
01:22:42,260 --> 01:22:44,660
I don't think he's actually cold.

2236
01:22:44,660 --> 01:22:46,140
Well, Jason, if you're anything like me,

2237
01:22:46,140 --> 01:22:49,900
refresh your email at 1210 and you'll be aware.

2238
01:22:49,900 --> 01:22:50,740
That's exciting.

2239
01:22:50,740 --> 01:22:51,580
Wow, that quick?

2240
01:22:51,580 --> 01:22:54,220
Oh my God, just seven minutes away for listeners.

2241
01:22:54,220 --> 01:22:55,060
Stop any.

2242
01:22:55,060 --> 01:22:55,900
I gotta do this too.

2243
01:22:55,900 --> 01:22:56,820
I gotta submit this.

2244
01:22:56,820 --> 01:22:58,820
Any sentence, just say whoever's talking.

2245
01:22:58,820 --> 01:23:00,020
Hey, fuck off for a second.

2246
01:23:00,020 --> 01:23:00,860
Shut up, shut up.

2247
01:23:00,860 --> 01:23:01,700
We got.

2248
01:23:01,700 --> 01:23:02,540
Shut up, shut up.

2249
01:23:02,540 --> 01:23:03,380
Okay.

2250
01:23:03,380 --> 01:23:07,740
Maybe by then we'll be done with dyes and children's stool.

2251
01:23:08,580 --> 01:23:10,940
We'll be on to the blood libel section.

2252
01:23:10,940 --> 01:23:11,780
Oh no.

2253
01:23:11,780 --> 01:23:13,660
Yeah, I did see that.

2254
01:23:13,660 --> 01:23:15,420
Let's cap that one.

2255
01:23:15,420 --> 01:23:16,260
Oh God.

2256
01:23:16,260 --> 01:23:18,340
So Frankenberry's stool does not happen anymore though, right?

2257
01:23:18,340 --> 01:23:21,060
It doesn't because they narrowed it down to

2258
01:23:21,060 --> 01:23:23,740
there's two dyes in this cereal

2259
01:23:23,740 --> 01:23:26,220
where Frankenberry's strawberry hue came from,

2260
01:23:26,220 --> 01:23:28,060
so this is from Atlas Obscura.

2261
01:23:28,060 --> 01:23:31,700
Red dyes numbers two and three.

2262
01:23:31,700 --> 01:23:35,380
Number two was banned in the US in 1976,

2263
01:23:35,380 --> 01:23:38,500
not long after all of this happened,

2264
01:23:38,500 --> 01:23:41,700
after it was tenuously linked to cancer and rats.

2265
01:23:41,700 --> 01:23:43,500
But for decades you could find it in everything,

2266
01:23:43,500 --> 01:23:46,020
from ice cream to hot dog casings.

2267
01:23:46,020 --> 01:23:49,020
The giving you cancer seems like the bigger problem.

2268
01:23:49,020 --> 01:23:50,340
Yeah, than the poop.

2269
01:23:50,340 --> 01:23:51,180
Than the pink poop.

2270
01:23:51,180 --> 01:23:52,020
Yeah.

2271
01:23:52,020 --> 01:23:52,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's pretty bad.

2272
01:23:52,860 --> 01:23:56,300
Well then, so yeah, if that sounds like a calm reaction,

2273
01:23:56,300 --> 01:23:59,260
actually it was an extremely strong reaction

2274
01:23:59,260 --> 01:24:03,140
because it was Soviet scientists who figured this,

2275
01:24:03,180 --> 01:24:08,180
but wait, although in 1971, Soviet scientists figured out

2276
01:24:08,660 --> 01:24:10,980
that red number two caused cancer.

2277
01:24:10,980 --> 01:24:14,340
1971, also the year that Frankenberry launched

2278
01:24:14,340 --> 01:24:19,020
and just ran long enough to turn kids' stool pink.

2279
01:24:19,020 --> 01:24:22,020
So the message did not come all the way

2280
01:24:22,020 --> 01:24:22,860
from the Soviet Union.

2281
01:24:22,860 --> 01:24:23,980
Well, yeah, who are you gonna trust,

2282
01:24:23,980 --> 01:24:26,740
our fine American cereal manufacturers

2283
01:24:26,740 --> 01:24:29,020
or Nikita Khrushchev, you know?

2284
01:24:29,020 --> 01:24:29,860
1971.

2285
01:24:29,860 --> 01:24:31,260
Fine boys at General Mills every day.

2286
01:24:31,260 --> 01:24:32,100
Yeah.

2287
01:24:32,100 --> 01:24:32,940
That's right.

2288
01:24:33,740 --> 01:24:36,380
I'm eating my country, I'm eating this big cereal, damn it.

2289
01:24:36,380 --> 01:24:39,820
But so then once the word got out,

2290
01:24:39,820 --> 01:24:43,420
then there was a bit of an overreaction against the dye

2291
01:24:43,420 --> 01:24:48,420
because then red dye was just for boating for a long time

2292
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:54,000
and such that red M&Ms were not around for like a decade.

2293
01:24:55,660 --> 01:24:58,020
And they didn't even have red number two,

2294
01:24:58,020 --> 01:25:02,060
but just something about the most famous red dyed item

2295
01:25:02,100 --> 01:25:04,340
maybe like that just feels too weird, right?

2296
01:25:04,340 --> 01:25:07,500
So I guess in the 70s, you could not get red M&Ms.

2297
01:25:07,500 --> 01:25:08,340
Kind of weird.

2298
01:25:08,340 --> 01:25:09,460
That's weird, yeah.

2299
01:25:11,340 --> 01:25:13,780
I looked this up just now and it's like, oops, all berries.

2300
01:25:13,780 --> 01:25:16,420
Captain Crunch gives you green poop now.

2301
01:25:16,420 --> 01:25:17,460
Okay, oh, okay.

2302
01:25:17,460 --> 01:25:20,220
I think blueberry might still,

2303
01:25:20,220 --> 01:25:23,820
because not all, this was the dye that took the hit.

2304
01:25:23,820 --> 01:25:28,740
The other one I mentioned, red number three, still around,

2305
01:25:28,740 --> 01:25:31,740
still in cake decorating gels.

2306
01:25:32,180 --> 01:25:34,460
It's apparently a little dose of it

2307
01:25:34,460 --> 01:25:36,580
is not gonna do anything to your poop,

2308
01:25:36,580 --> 01:25:39,740
but if you ate only red number three,

2309
01:25:39,740 --> 01:25:42,700
you would have purely pink poop.

2310
01:25:42,700 --> 01:25:43,540
So don't.

2311
01:25:43,540 --> 01:25:45,940
I wanna see, I wish there was a photo of it

2312
01:25:45,940 --> 01:25:48,620
because I just wanna see how much ice cream it looked.

2313
01:25:48,620 --> 01:25:52,500
I wanted to see if it was just like people never.

2314
01:25:52,500 --> 01:25:54,780
Could we do gender reveals with these?

2315
01:25:54,780 --> 01:25:56,740
Like really foul.

2316
01:25:56,740 --> 01:25:59,780
Eat a bunch of blueberry, eat a bunch of Frankenberry.

2317
01:25:59,780 --> 01:26:03,020
Every guest at the party, wait, okay,

2318
01:26:03,020 --> 01:26:04,300
how do you do it without, oh wait, no,

2319
01:26:04,300 --> 01:26:05,660
it can't be the guests, because then they would know,

2320
01:26:05,660 --> 01:26:07,220
because they know what they ate.

2321
01:26:07,220 --> 01:26:09,300
So another party.

2322
01:26:09,300 --> 01:26:11,180
Like a doctor would need to say,

2323
01:26:11,180 --> 01:26:12,020
don't tell your husband,

2324
01:26:12,020 --> 01:26:13,940
but eat a bunch of Frankenberry tonight.

2325
01:26:13,940 --> 01:26:15,860
Whoa, I got an idea, I got an idea.

2326
01:26:15,860 --> 01:26:19,100
You get a great, okay, you get a Great Dane

2327
01:26:19,100 --> 01:26:21,940
and you feed it one of the cereals.

2328
01:26:21,940 --> 01:26:24,780
A dog, that's an incredible idea.

2329
01:26:24,780 --> 01:26:27,700
And then you have it, time it so the Great Dane

2330
01:26:27,740 --> 01:26:30,060
does it on the lawn in front of all the guests.

2331
01:26:30,060 --> 01:26:31,500
This is an incredible idea.

2332
01:26:32,980 --> 01:26:35,700
And that's how you say which gender the baby is.

2333
01:26:35,700 --> 01:26:39,580
So animals now have to be involved.

2334
01:26:39,580 --> 01:26:40,420
They have to be.

2335
01:26:40,420 --> 01:26:43,540
Can you trust, there's no other way.

2336
01:26:43,540 --> 01:26:44,380
No other way.

2337
01:26:44,380 --> 01:26:45,580
But is it? Or I guess you could do it,

2338
01:26:45,580 --> 01:26:47,220
okay, okay, plus it up.

2339
01:26:47,220 --> 01:26:48,820
You rent a stork.

2340
01:26:50,100 --> 01:26:51,140
Oh. Rent, okay.

2341
01:26:51,140 --> 01:26:53,660
Feed a stork a bunch of blueberry?

2342
01:26:53,660 --> 01:26:57,140
You feed a stork whichever Frankenberry or blueberry

2343
01:26:57,140 --> 01:26:59,060
and then the stork shits on the lawn

2344
01:26:59,060 --> 01:27:01,220
in front of all the guests.

2345
01:27:01,220 --> 01:27:02,060
The beginning.

2346
01:27:02,060 --> 01:27:03,700
That is how we know storks deliver babies

2347
01:27:03,700 --> 01:27:05,780
is by shitting them out with it.

2348
01:27:05,780 --> 01:27:06,620
Exactly.

2349
01:27:07,900 --> 01:27:10,780
They don't just deliver, storks poop the babies.

2350
01:27:10,780 --> 01:27:12,620
Squat on the crib, shit out a baby.

2351
01:27:13,780 --> 01:27:18,780
Plops out, covered in fluid representing the then gender.

2352
01:27:21,860 --> 01:27:24,740
Oh God, I like that the beginning of this.

2353
01:27:24,740 --> 01:27:27,340
It was shitting out black for a couple days

2354
01:27:27,340 --> 01:27:30,140
and I thought I had accidentally fed it an icy from her.

2355
01:27:30,140 --> 01:27:34,660
But it was just amniotic fluid, it's normal.

2356
01:27:34,660 --> 01:27:36,460
Okay, okay, everything's fine now.

2357
01:27:36,460 --> 01:27:39,620
Until she gets a hold of the Frankenberry.

2358
01:27:39,620 --> 01:27:43,060
Yeah, were you concerned she had Frankenberry stool?

2359
01:27:43,060 --> 01:27:45,260
I say yes, to be honest I was.

2360
01:27:45,260 --> 01:27:46,780
Wasn't pink though, that'd be the.

2361
01:27:46,780 --> 01:27:47,620
Not pink, yeah.

2362
01:27:47,620 --> 01:27:51,140
The first, a baby's poop, as Scott I think

2363
01:27:51,140 --> 01:27:54,060
said on this podcast is like tar.

2364
01:27:54,740 --> 01:27:56,140
They poop tar for a few days.

2365
01:27:56,140 --> 01:27:57,860
Yeah, they have an initial that.

2366
01:27:57,860 --> 01:27:58,900
And it was also strange

2367
01:27:58,900 --> 01:28:01,780
because you were mostly exclusively feeding her boobberries.

2368
01:28:01,780 --> 01:28:03,620
So why would she have Frankenberry stool?

2369
01:28:03,620 --> 01:28:08,620
Yeah, no breast milk, no formula, just solid boobberry.

2370
01:28:09,300 --> 01:28:10,580
Just feeding a baby.

2371
01:28:11,900 --> 01:28:14,700
She's gotta get a sense of what house she landed in.

2372
01:28:14,700 --> 01:28:15,540
You need to know that.

2373
01:28:15,540 --> 01:28:17,860
You need to know this now.

2374
01:28:17,860 --> 01:28:20,540
Learn everything about your dad right now.

2375
01:28:21,500 --> 01:28:24,300
A similar thing happened in the 80s

2376
01:28:24,300 --> 01:28:27,660
with the cereal Smurfberry Crunch,

2377
01:28:27,660 --> 01:28:31,420
which if you can imagine turned people's poop blue.

2378
01:28:31,420 --> 01:28:33,020
Then they changed the formula

2379
01:28:33,020 --> 01:28:36,220
and released it as Magic Berry cereal.

2380
01:28:36,220 --> 01:28:39,220
But I guess maybe Smurfs wanted out of the breakfast game

2381
01:28:39,220 --> 01:28:40,580
after that incident.

2382
01:28:41,900 --> 01:28:44,540
Dear God, anyway we still have plenty of dyes.

2383
01:28:44,540 --> 01:28:49,540
Because apparently, on the flip side, Europe won't,

2384
01:28:49,860 --> 01:28:52,100
you can still get red number two in Europe.

2385
01:28:52,100 --> 01:28:54,500
So you can do all the pink pooping you want in Europe.

2386
01:28:54,500 --> 01:28:57,140
But they banned something called red number 40

2387
01:28:57,140 --> 01:28:59,060
that we still have plenty here.

2388
01:28:59,060 --> 01:29:03,680
So kids, you can find a way to shit strawberry ice cream

2389
01:29:03,680 --> 01:29:05,100
if you want it bad enough.

2390
01:29:05,100 --> 01:29:06,260
Jason, you gotta go to Europe.

2391
01:29:06,260 --> 01:29:07,300
You've been saying it.

2392
01:29:08,580 --> 01:29:12,300
Well, I don't know because there was a news story,

2393
01:29:12,300 --> 01:29:15,020
like an oddly enough news story a while back

2394
01:29:15,020 --> 01:29:16,620
about a bakery getting in trouble

2395
01:29:16,620 --> 01:29:19,260
for importing sprinkles from America.

2396
01:29:20,180 --> 01:29:22,420
And they're like, the sprinkles we have here are bullshit.

2397
01:29:22,420 --> 01:29:25,140
So that might be enough to cross out the entire continent.

2398
01:29:25,140 --> 01:29:26,780
Yeah, that'll cross out the continent.

2399
01:29:26,780 --> 01:29:28,780
So I don't know what fucked up sprinkles

2400
01:29:28,780 --> 01:29:29,700
they're dealing with there.

2401
01:29:29,700 --> 01:29:32,580
I need some good, wholesome American sprinkles.

2402
01:29:33,460 --> 01:29:36,900
Until I know I can get sprinkles of decent quality,

2403
01:29:36,900 --> 01:29:38,520
Europe is dead to me.

2404
01:29:39,500 --> 01:29:41,260
It's 1210, it's 1210.

2405
01:29:41,260 --> 01:29:43,860
Any, I'll just interrupt myself.

2406
01:29:43,860 --> 01:29:45,300
Yeah, yeah, what's going on?

2407
01:29:45,300 --> 01:29:46,500
Let me refresh my email.

2408
01:29:46,500 --> 01:29:48,100
I don't think there has been.

2409
01:29:48,140 --> 01:29:52,620
Okay, while you do that, Jordan, can I ask for,

2410
01:29:52,620 --> 01:29:54,940
I think live action count is the-

2411
01:29:54,940 --> 01:29:55,780
Can I ask for not?

2412
01:29:55,780 --> 01:29:56,620
Oh, God.

2413
01:29:56,620 --> 01:29:57,860
Yeah, that's fair, that's fair.

2414
01:29:57,860 --> 01:30:00,140
Here, let's just get a quick flash like Bloody Mary.

2415
01:30:00,140 --> 01:30:01,700
Oh, man.

2416
01:30:01,700 --> 01:30:03,700
What I'm showing everyone right now

2417
01:30:03,700 --> 01:30:06,100
is the one instance in 1991

2418
01:30:06,100 --> 01:30:08,260
of a live action Count Chocula.

2419
01:30:08,260 --> 01:30:09,220
I don't think there were live actions

2420
01:30:09,220 --> 01:30:11,980
of any of these characters, and this is why.

2421
01:30:11,980 --> 01:30:15,620
It is a, this is the most Duracell family

2422
01:30:15,660 --> 01:30:19,220
frightening prosthetic, and does everyone,

2423
01:30:19,220 --> 01:30:22,700
well, anyone jump in and say what you think of his chin.

2424
01:30:22,700 --> 01:30:25,860
What does his chin resemble to anyone?

2425
01:30:25,860 --> 01:30:27,380
He looks, hmm.

2426
01:30:27,380 --> 01:30:29,540
Make that chin clap, King.

2427
01:30:29,540 --> 01:30:30,380
Yeah.

2428
01:30:31,860 --> 01:30:34,980
That chin's gonna shit out some blueberry stool.

2429
01:30:37,620 --> 01:30:41,100
It is, it is, it does look like a seat, I will agree.

2430
01:30:41,100 --> 01:30:41,940
Big seat.

2431
01:30:41,940 --> 01:30:43,340
But it also looks like balls.

2432
01:30:43,340 --> 01:30:44,900
Like truck nuts, yeah, like truck nuts.

2433
01:30:45,340 --> 01:30:46,300
You guys went to butts.

2434
01:30:46,300 --> 01:30:47,300
Over exaggerated balls.

2435
01:30:47,300 --> 01:30:51,220
You went to seats, I went to, yeah, big droopy balls.

2436
01:30:51,220 --> 01:30:52,940
He's a ball face.

2437
01:30:52,940 --> 01:30:53,780
This is not.

2438
01:30:53,780 --> 01:30:56,260
Count Chocula has droopy balls hanging off his chin.

2439
01:30:57,660 --> 01:31:00,980
So, not good, this was not a good,

2440
01:31:00,980 --> 01:31:02,660
these characters were meant to be animated

2441
01:31:02,660 --> 01:31:05,260
and stay animated, I think.

2442
01:31:05,260 --> 01:31:07,060
Any updates, Jason?

2443
01:31:07,060 --> 01:31:08,300
No updates so far.

2444
01:31:08,300 --> 01:31:09,220
Oh, boy, okay.

2445
01:31:09,220 --> 01:31:10,300
You want me to try?

2446
01:31:11,340 --> 01:31:12,860
We know Mike's got the magic touch.

2447
01:31:12,860 --> 01:31:14,020
The magic touch, yeah.

2448
01:31:14,020 --> 01:31:14,860
Yeah.

2449
01:31:16,580 --> 01:31:21,580
Okay, what else is, well maybe, let's see.

2450
01:31:23,540 --> 01:31:26,020
I can talk a little bit about,

2451
01:31:26,020 --> 01:31:30,020
because kind of the holy grail with characters like this

2452
01:31:30,020 --> 01:31:33,340
is if there's any other media of them

2453
01:31:33,340 --> 01:31:35,100
outside of just them smiling on a box.

2454
01:31:35,100 --> 01:31:37,140
And there's the commercials and the commercials are fun.

2455
01:31:37,140 --> 01:31:38,060
So I was trying to figure out,

2456
01:31:38,060 --> 01:31:40,620
is there other multimedia ways

2457
01:31:40,620 --> 01:31:42,260
to experience these characters?

2458
01:31:42,940 --> 01:31:44,620
I'm a little disappointed in my results

2459
01:31:44,620 --> 01:31:48,820
relating to any music made by these characters.

2460
01:31:48,820 --> 01:31:49,660
Yeah.

2461
01:31:49,660 --> 01:31:51,220
There have been a few things.

2462
01:31:51,220 --> 01:31:55,220
In the 70s, you could get in your box maybe,

2463
01:31:56,380 --> 01:31:58,460
assuming you didn't swallow it and choke on it,

2464
01:31:58,460 --> 01:32:01,900
a Monsters Adventure record.

2465
01:32:01,900 --> 01:32:05,260
One of them is called Monster Adventures in Outer Space.

2466
01:32:05,260 --> 01:32:08,700
One of them is called Count Chocula Goes to Hollywood.

2467
01:32:08,700 --> 01:32:11,620
One of them is called The Monsters Go Disco.

2468
01:32:12,460 --> 01:32:15,060
And this is, I'll tell you why I'm disappointed,

2469
01:32:15,060 --> 01:32:17,260
because in The Monsters Go Disco,

2470
01:32:17,260 --> 01:32:22,100
the original three are all surrounding a record player

2471
01:32:22,100 --> 01:32:24,220
and there's musical notes coming out

2472
01:32:24,220 --> 01:32:25,940
and they're all kind of dancing.

2473
01:32:25,940 --> 01:32:27,820
And see, any, even just a still iteration

2474
01:32:27,820 --> 01:32:31,260
of Boo Berry dancing is wonderful, it's very cute.

2475
01:32:31,260 --> 01:32:33,380
But these were like spoken words, basically.

2476
01:32:33,380 --> 01:32:34,220
These were like sketches, yeah.

2477
01:32:34,220 --> 01:32:35,060
They were like sketches, right, yeah.

2478
01:32:35,060 --> 01:32:35,900
Yeah.

2479
01:32:35,900 --> 01:32:37,620
Yeah, so you're not getting,

2480
01:32:38,500 --> 01:32:40,860
I wanna hear him sing, obviously.

2481
01:32:40,900 --> 01:32:43,060
Did anyone listen to these enough to know what happened?

2482
01:32:43,060 --> 01:32:45,260
I listened to all of them, yeah.

2483
01:32:45,260 --> 01:32:46,180
Anything notable?

2484
01:32:46,180 --> 01:32:48,700
I think Monster Adventures in Outer Space

2485
01:32:48,700 --> 01:32:49,780
is probably the strongest.

2486
01:32:49,780 --> 01:32:50,620
I think so, too.

2487
01:32:50,620 --> 01:32:51,980
Yeah.

2488
01:32:51,980 --> 01:32:52,820
What is the,

2489
01:32:53,900 --> 01:32:55,380
what are the highlights?

2490
01:32:55,380 --> 01:32:56,460
What's their adventure like?

2491
01:32:56,460 --> 01:33:00,180
Well, Frankenberry wants to rescue his teddy bear

2492
01:33:00,180 --> 01:33:02,620
and they go to the planet of teddy bears.

2493
01:33:02,620 --> 01:33:03,940
Okay.

2494
01:33:03,940 --> 01:33:05,300
But Mike, do you have anything?

2495
01:33:05,300 --> 01:33:07,860
It's kind of a twist at the end.

2496
01:33:07,860 --> 01:33:09,260
I'm sorry, I don't even remember the twist,

2497
01:33:09,540 --> 01:33:11,420
but they go to space kinda accidentally, right?

2498
01:33:11,420 --> 01:33:12,700
Accidentally, they ride a marshmallow.

2499
01:33:12,700 --> 01:33:14,100
Oh, he's floated away.

2500
01:33:14,100 --> 01:33:16,260
Yeah, they ride a marshmallow rocket

2501
01:33:16,260 --> 01:33:18,620
and it all turns out to be a dream.

2502
01:33:18,620 --> 01:33:19,460
All turns out to be a dream.

2503
01:33:19,460 --> 01:33:20,300
Yeah, the teddy bear.

2504
01:33:20,300 --> 01:33:21,140
It's a cop out.

2505
01:33:21,140 --> 01:33:21,980
Yeah, it's a cop out.

2506
01:33:21,980 --> 01:33:22,820
It's a kind of a cop out.

2507
01:33:22,820 --> 01:33:23,820
It's a kind of a scene elsewhere ending.

2508
01:33:23,820 --> 01:33:24,660
Yeah.

2509
01:33:24,660 --> 01:33:25,500
Yeah.

2510
01:33:25,500 --> 01:33:27,260
I remember liking,

2511
01:33:27,260 --> 01:33:28,500
I just don't understand,

2512
01:33:28,500 --> 01:33:29,980
I'm surprised it took them so long

2513
01:33:29,980 --> 01:33:32,060
to get to just Monster Mash cereal,

2514
01:33:32,060 --> 01:33:34,180
which they did a couple years ago.

2515
01:33:34,180 --> 01:33:36,660
When you have harmless monsters,

2516
01:33:36,660 --> 01:33:38,980
the fun to do is they have a party

2517
01:33:39,660 --> 01:33:40,500
and they sing a song,

2518
01:33:40,500 --> 01:33:41,700
like sing rock and roll music.

2519
01:33:41,700 --> 01:33:42,540
Yes.

2520
01:33:42,540 --> 01:33:43,380
And they did record.

2521
01:33:43,380 --> 01:33:45,140
They did cover a version of Monster Mash.

2522
01:33:45,140 --> 01:33:48,100
Yeah, and they did a fake behind the music

2523
01:33:48,100 --> 01:33:50,380
band reuniting thing.

2524
01:33:50,380 --> 01:33:51,220
Is that still around?

2525
01:33:51,220 --> 01:33:52,420
Is that viewable?

2526
01:33:52,420 --> 01:33:53,420
I was on a site where it,

2527
01:33:53,420 --> 01:33:54,260
okay, okay.

2528
01:33:54,260 --> 01:33:55,940
Oh, it was produced by a friend

2529
01:33:55,940 --> 01:33:56,980
I used to work with at Funny or Die

2530
01:33:56,980 --> 01:33:58,940
and I looked for it yesterday

2531
01:33:58,940 --> 01:34:01,460
and it was named the video Private.

2532
01:34:01,460 --> 01:34:02,300
Who's that?

2533
01:34:02,300 --> 01:34:03,140
What's the name, if you don't mind?

2534
01:34:03,140 --> 01:34:04,900
The bobey outed.

2535
01:34:04,900 --> 01:34:05,740
Rob Hatch Miller?

2536
01:34:05,740 --> 01:34:07,300
Oh yeah, we know Rob, yeah.

2537
01:34:07,300 --> 01:34:09,700
Rob came to our live show recently, yeah.

2538
01:34:09,700 --> 01:34:10,540
Oh, that's something to add.

2539
01:34:10,540 --> 01:34:11,940
I think it's a feather in his cap.

2540
01:34:11,940 --> 01:34:13,580
Oh yeah, I was kind of proud.

2541
01:34:13,580 --> 01:34:15,220
I wasn't asked to work on it.

2542
01:34:15,220 --> 01:34:16,060
Right.

2543
01:34:16,060 --> 01:34:17,140
Oh yeah, to put words, that's right.

2544
01:34:17,140 --> 01:34:19,420
You love the characters to put words in their mouth.

2545
01:34:19,420 --> 01:34:22,100
That's how I kind of knew who all the extended

2546
01:34:22,100 --> 01:34:23,620
General Mills family was,

2547
01:34:23,620 --> 01:34:25,620
because a lot of them show up in it.

2548
01:34:25,620 --> 01:34:27,660
Oh, they make little, this sounds fun.

2549
01:34:27,660 --> 01:34:31,700
There's another commercial where all the boxes

2550
01:34:31,700 --> 01:34:32,540
are lined up.

2551
01:34:32,540 --> 01:34:33,980
It might have been when you got those Beanie Beans,

2552
01:34:33,980 --> 01:34:37,220
but you could see all the guys you could get.

2553
01:34:38,020 --> 01:34:38,860
Okay, okay.

2554
01:34:39,820 --> 01:34:43,740
Well, so I mean, the little albums don't really give you

2555
01:34:43,740 --> 01:34:45,340
what you want necessarily.

2556
01:34:45,340 --> 01:34:49,260
They're also, throughout the years, in the 2000s,

2557
01:34:49,260 --> 01:34:52,820
there was also a CD included called

2558
01:34:52,820 --> 01:34:56,300
13 Days of Halloween Rhythm and Booze.

2559
01:34:56,300 --> 01:34:59,820
And it has an intro from Count Chocula,

2560
01:34:59,820 --> 01:35:02,700
but then a lot of it is just spooky Halloween sounds

2561
01:35:02,700 --> 01:35:05,500
to like play at your house for when Trick or Treaters come out,

2562
01:35:05,500 --> 01:35:08,100
which is a good thing to put in this cereal for sure.

2563
01:35:08,100 --> 01:35:09,580
But I was disappointed that none of the songs

2564
01:35:09,580 --> 01:35:11,540
are by the monsters.

2565
01:35:11,540 --> 01:35:14,340
And in fact, what you get instead is

2566
01:35:15,900 --> 01:35:19,780
a track by the Baja Men called It's Spooky in Here,

2567
01:35:19,780 --> 01:35:23,940
and another track by the Baja Men called

2568
01:35:23,940 --> 01:35:27,220
It's Spooky in Here, bonus Junkanoo mix.

2569
01:35:29,220 --> 01:35:31,900
I don't know what differentiates the Junkanoo mix

2570
01:35:31,900 --> 01:35:32,740
from the original.

2571
01:35:32,740 --> 01:35:33,780
Was this one you sent away for,

2572
01:35:33,780 --> 01:35:35,180
or in the box there was a CD?

2573
01:35:35,180 --> 01:35:36,660
That seems like a generous,

2574
01:35:36,660 --> 01:35:38,180
even if it's not exactly what you were hoping for,

2575
01:35:38,180 --> 01:35:39,220
that's a nice prize.

2576
01:35:39,220 --> 01:35:40,820
Ooh, that I'm not sure of.

2577
01:35:40,820 --> 01:35:43,500
I guess, yeah, if it's just in the box, that is pretty big.

2578
01:35:43,500 --> 01:35:45,900
I don't know, yeah, might've had to get lucky.

2579
01:35:45,900 --> 01:35:48,820
Step up from the Hoot Blower, whatever those were.

2580
01:35:48,820 --> 01:35:50,580
I'd say so, yeah, because that requires you

2581
01:35:50,580 --> 01:35:52,900
to make all your, to boo your own hoots,

2582
01:35:52,900 --> 01:35:56,420
but the Baja Men booed hoots for you.

2583
01:35:57,940 --> 01:36:02,940
So, disappointed by that, but then there is a little bit of,

2584
01:36:03,140 --> 01:36:06,020
basically, hey, the thing that we're after in the show

2585
01:36:06,020 --> 01:36:08,060
is ostensibly about theme parks.

2586
01:36:08,060 --> 01:36:13,060
There was a theme park way to meet just Count Chocula.

2587
01:36:13,980 --> 01:36:17,260
And for this, there's a little bit of repeated material,

2588
01:36:18,100 --> 01:36:22,980
because we go back now to the episode we did about Opryland,

2589
01:36:22,980 --> 01:36:26,100
an episode with Jesse Farrar, an audience, I'm so sorry,

2590
01:36:26,100 --> 01:36:29,180
we have to even talk about this again.

2591
01:36:29,260 --> 01:36:33,540
The most villainous guest in the history of the show,

2592
01:36:33,540 --> 01:36:35,700
because he briefly said he didn't like theme parks

2593
01:36:35,700 --> 01:36:38,140
and then was otherwise great and funny.

2594
01:36:39,380 --> 01:36:42,980
Loved the reaction to it, thanks everyone, appreciated it.

2595
01:36:42,980 --> 01:36:46,020
So anyways, maybe someday I won't be annoyed,

2596
01:36:46,020 --> 01:36:48,020
but you think they'll ever be,

2597
01:36:48,020 --> 01:36:51,100
is this just me or Mike and Jason, how do you feel?

2598
01:36:51,100 --> 01:36:53,100
Oh, well, I don't think it's funny, I don't know.

2599
01:36:53,100 --> 01:36:56,500
Yeah, we were all insane around that time

2600
01:36:56,500 --> 01:36:57,340
the episode came out.

2601
01:36:57,340 --> 01:36:59,060
I think it's funny that everyone was like,

2602
01:36:59,940 --> 01:37:01,580
was it election stress?

2603
01:37:01,580 --> 01:37:02,420
Is that what you're saying?

2604
01:37:02,420 --> 01:37:03,260
It might have been election stress.

2605
01:37:03,260 --> 01:37:04,100
I also think it's funny,

2606
01:37:04,100 --> 01:37:05,020
because I think when we were talking about

2607
01:37:05,020 --> 01:37:07,100
originally doing this podcast five years ago,

2608
01:37:07,100 --> 01:37:08,940
I think we were like, and then we'll often have

2609
01:37:08,940 --> 01:37:10,620
people that don't like it and we'll talk to them

2610
01:37:10,620 --> 01:37:11,860
and what they don't like about theme parks,

2611
01:37:11,860 --> 01:37:13,900
and that's the closest we've ever come to it,

2612
01:37:13,900 --> 01:37:16,220
and it was so mild, it's funny to see.

2613
01:37:16,220 --> 01:37:17,540
And there was a revolt.

2614
01:37:17,540 --> 01:37:19,260
Is anybody being like, let's go.

2615
01:37:19,260 --> 01:37:21,180
I have never, never heard,

2616
01:37:21,180 --> 01:37:24,380
the boys have crossed the line for the last time.

2617
01:37:24,380 --> 01:37:27,500
So anyway, it's possible that you did not finish

2618
01:37:27,500 --> 01:37:31,940
the episode because you vomited all over your phone.

2619
01:37:32,940 --> 01:37:35,340
Then I don't mind saying that you could meet

2620
01:37:35,340 --> 01:37:37,500
the Breakfast Buddies, and when I was quizzing you guys

2621
01:37:37,500 --> 01:37:39,660
at the beginning, part of that was because,

2622
01:37:40,940 --> 01:37:43,060
let's establish who all is together,

2623
01:37:44,020 --> 01:37:46,580
who you could meet, like the Big Five at Disneyland,

2624
01:37:46,580 --> 01:37:50,860
and Jordan, I think there's a photo, this one,

2625
01:37:50,860 --> 01:37:51,820
there we go. There they are.

2626
01:37:51,820 --> 01:37:55,140
The Big G Breakfast Buddies, there they are.

2627
01:37:55,180 --> 01:37:57,460
So this lineup, oh, I apologize.

2628
01:37:57,460 --> 01:37:59,420
I did not include Frankenberry.

2629
01:37:59,420 --> 01:38:01,100
You could meet Frankenberry.

2630
01:38:01,100 --> 01:38:04,580
This is some great 70s Schoolhouse Rock kind of art

2631
01:38:04,580 --> 01:38:07,100
that indicates that you can meet Frankenberry,

2632
01:38:07,100 --> 01:38:10,100
Count Chocula, and non-spooky mascots,

2633
01:38:10,100 --> 01:38:13,940
the Trix Rabbit, and Honey Nut B,

2634
01:38:13,940 --> 01:38:16,700
who today is known as Buzz, but at the time,

2635
01:38:16,700 --> 01:38:18,740
I guess they had not given him that name.

2636
01:38:19,820 --> 01:38:22,540
My takeaway from this photo that we're looking at

2637
01:38:23,140 --> 01:38:25,980
is they made a choice with Honey Nut B,

2638
01:38:25,980 --> 01:38:29,140
which is to make him like Ralph Wiggum.

2639
01:38:29,140 --> 01:38:30,460
He's like the- He does look like,

2640
01:38:30,460 --> 01:38:31,540
yeah, I was thinking that too.

2641
01:38:31,540 --> 01:38:33,420
He looks like a Simpsons character.

2642
01:38:33,420 --> 01:38:35,140
He's yellow, first of all.

2643
01:38:35,140 --> 01:38:36,060
And he's got the tongue out,

2644
01:38:36,060 --> 01:38:38,940
which makes him seem like he's thinking hard, I guess.

2645
01:38:38,940 --> 01:38:40,860
But he's dumb. He looks dumb,

2646
01:38:40,860 --> 01:38:44,700
and he looks much chubbier than any depiction.

2647
01:38:44,700 --> 01:38:46,740
Yeah. I like him, I'll say.

2648
01:38:46,740 --> 01:38:48,300
He looks the most like a walk-around character, though,

2649
01:38:48,300 --> 01:38:50,220
like that. I bet if you saw him in person,

2650
01:38:50,260 --> 01:38:53,140
that is the closest to what he actually looks like,

2651
01:38:53,140 --> 01:38:54,220
as opposed to the other ones.

2652
01:38:54,220 --> 01:38:56,220
Yeah. He might be just hungry, honestly.

2653
01:38:56,220 --> 01:38:58,060
He might not be dumb. He might be hungry.

2654
01:38:58,060 --> 01:39:00,420
It's funny now because I feel like the marketing

2655
01:39:00,420 --> 01:39:03,140
for the last 20, 25 years of Honey Nut Cheerios

2656
01:39:03,140 --> 01:39:07,420
or any Cheerios, it's like, hey, pretty good, right?

2657
01:39:07,420 --> 01:39:11,380
Tastes good and healthy, pretty healthy.

2658
01:39:11,380 --> 01:39:13,260
I still think Honey Nut Cheerios,

2659
01:39:13,260 --> 01:39:15,260
that was like the default in my house.

2660
01:39:15,260 --> 01:39:18,580
Same. Always in the house,

2661
01:39:18,580 --> 01:39:21,260
always if my parents were like,

2662
01:39:21,260 --> 01:39:24,460
I don't, it's so late, I don't, just feed the kids.

2663
01:39:24,460 --> 01:39:26,940
I'll just have a bowl of Honey Nut Cheerios.

2664
01:39:26,940 --> 01:39:29,260
Honey Nut Cheerios was like a good compromise.

2665
01:39:29,260 --> 01:39:30,100
Yeah.

2666
01:39:30,100 --> 01:39:31,060
Because you got a little sugar,

2667
01:39:31,060 --> 01:39:34,820
but parents still, Cheerios read to them as healthier,

2668
01:39:34,820 --> 01:39:36,540
which it is to some degree.

2669
01:39:37,420 --> 01:39:38,460
But you still get a cartoon,

2670
01:39:38,460 --> 01:39:40,980
of the cartoon character serials,

2671
01:39:40,980 --> 01:39:43,620
maybe the healthiest or at least feels that way.

2672
01:39:43,620 --> 01:39:44,460
I think so. Yeah.

2673
01:39:44,460 --> 01:39:46,660
Yeah. And then, plain Cheerios.

2674
01:39:46,660 --> 01:39:48,460
I would be shocked to see.

2675
01:39:49,300 --> 01:39:50,180
Yeah. Plain Cheerios is just like,

2676
01:39:50,180 --> 01:39:51,620
this is good for your heart.

2677
01:39:51,620 --> 01:39:53,180
This is, this will help your heart.

2678
01:39:53,180 --> 01:39:55,900
Heart healthy. Heart healthy.

2679
01:39:55,900 --> 01:39:58,340
Is what I think at least it used to say on the box.

2680
01:39:58,340 --> 01:39:59,620
I don't know if it does it right now.

2681
01:39:59,620 --> 01:40:01,220
So if your grandfather had a heart attack,

2682
01:40:01,220 --> 01:40:04,060
make sure you have the aspirin he could put under his tongue

2683
01:40:04,060 --> 01:40:07,380
and keep a massive box of Cheerios around.

2684
01:40:07,380 --> 01:40:08,220
Yes.

2685
01:40:08,220 --> 01:40:10,620
That's what the American Medical Association says.

2686
01:40:11,580 --> 01:40:13,020
Let me now ask for a clip,

2687
01:40:13,020 --> 01:40:16,300
and this was played fully in the dreaded,

2688
01:40:16,340 --> 01:40:20,340
let's never speak of it again, Jesse Farrar episode.

2689
01:40:20,340 --> 01:40:22,580
So this is, what did I call it?

2690
01:40:22,580 --> 01:40:24,140
I don't know, there's not a lot of clips left.

2691
01:40:24,140 --> 01:40:25,900
I don't remember. I'm sorry, Jordan.

2692
01:40:27,140 --> 01:40:29,060
It's called serial dudes or something.

2693
01:40:29,060 --> 01:40:30,380
There we go. Opryland gang.

2694
01:40:30,380 --> 01:40:32,260
Of course, that's what I called it.

2695
01:40:32,260 --> 01:40:33,820
We definitely played this before,

2696
01:40:33,820 --> 01:40:35,420
but Mike, you probably haven't seen this.

2697
01:40:35,420 --> 01:40:37,380
This is from an Opryland TV.

2698
01:40:37,380 --> 01:40:39,940
So Opryland's in Tennessee, by the way,

2699
01:40:39,940 --> 01:40:41,500
and next to the Grand Ole Opry.

2700
01:40:43,340 --> 01:40:45,220
This was just, this is a long special.

2701
01:40:45,220 --> 01:40:46,940
It was a ton of country music,

2702
01:40:46,940 --> 01:40:51,300
but then Frankie Avalon briefly nods to rock.

2703
01:40:51,300 --> 01:40:54,460
Like we gotta, let's put in rock for like 20 seconds,

2704
01:40:54,460 --> 01:40:55,300
and then we're out.

2705
01:40:55,300 --> 01:40:58,300
That's the most willing to acknowledge rock music.

2706
01:40:58,300 --> 01:41:01,820
So just try to make heads or tails of this little sequence

2707
01:41:01,820 --> 01:41:03,700
in which our serial friends appear.

2708
01:41:05,540 --> 01:41:09,740
We're Sergeant Hepper's lovely Hot Club Band.

2709
01:41:09,740 --> 01:41:12,300
We hope you will enjoy the show.

2710
01:41:13,140 --> 01:41:17,140
Sergeant Hepper's lonely Hot Club Band.

2711
01:41:17,140 --> 01:41:20,140
Sit back and let the evening go.

2712
01:41:21,140 --> 01:41:25,140
Sergeant Hepper's lonely, Sergeant Hepper's lonely,

2713
01:41:25,140 --> 01:41:28,140
Sergeant Hepper's lonely Hot Club Band.

2714
01:41:31,140 --> 01:41:32,820
Does he have a wig on?

2715
01:41:32,820 --> 01:41:35,420
I think, I guess it's supposed to be a Beatle wig.

2716
01:41:35,420 --> 01:41:36,260
Yes.

2717
01:41:36,260 --> 01:41:37,540
I don't know who this is.

2718
01:41:37,540 --> 01:41:40,820
I don't know who is leading this Sergeant Hepper performance.

2719
01:41:41,100 --> 01:41:43,140
To narrate it for the listeners,

2720
01:41:44,380 --> 01:41:49,380
Beatle wig, old man, and then three unnamed females.

2721
01:41:50,140 --> 01:41:51,980
I'll start with their heads and cutouts

2722
01:41:51,980 --> 01:41:53,380
of the serial mascots.

2723
01:41:53,380 --> 01:41:54,860
So now we know they have that.

2724
01:41:54,860 --> 01:41:58,820
What it's Lucky B. Tricks Rabbit.

2725
01:41:58,820 --> 01:42:01,820
Why any of this with Sergeant Pepper, I don't know.

2726
01:42:02,780 --> 01:42:04,460
Because they're colorful characters,

2727
01:42:04,460 --> 01:42:06,700
like the serial people, I don't know.

2728
01:42:07,860 --> 01:42:09,260
And then you see Count Shaw,

2729
01:42:09,260 --> 01:42:11,020
they come out and dance with mascots.

2730
01:42:11,020 --> 01:42:13,540
So these were the walk-arounds of the,

2731
01:42:13,540 --> 01:42:17,060
so you could hang out with Count Chocula at Opryland.

2732
01:42:17,940 --> 01:42:22,900
And what we're saying about maybe the mascots,

2733
01:42:22,900 --> 01:42:25,300
that photo that Buzz kind of looked like a,

2734
01:42:25,300 --> 01:42:26,900
they made the same choice here.

2735
01:42:26,900 --> 01:42:30,260
Buzz the Honey Nut Cheerios B is chubby.

2736
01:42:31,620 --> 01:42:32,740
Which he didn't have to be,

2737
01:42:32,740 --> 01:42:35,860
because look, Lucky Charms guy is not.

2738
01:42:35,860 --> 01:42:38,260
They're capable of making skinny suits,

2739
01:42:38,300 --> 01:42:40,860
but they added a bunch of pounds to Buzz.

2740
01:42:40,860 --> 01:42:42,860
I guess what they were thinking is,

2741
01:42:42,860 --> 01:42:44,500
here, I'm just, this is guessing,

2742
01:42:44,500 --> 01:42:46,580
and I'm thinking that they thought,

2743
01:42:46,580 --> 01:42:48,020
okay, we're gonna blow the bee up.

2744
01:42:48,020 --> 01:42:50,580
The bee is actually smaller on the boxes,

2745
01:42:50,580 --> 01:42:51,900
but we can't do it.

2746
01:42:51,900 --> 01:42:54,780
We can't, they didn't have the baby-groot technology

2747
01:42:54,780 --> 01:42:57,740
or whatever to make the bee small.

2748
01:42:57,740 --> 01:43:00,940
So they said, okay, what would happen if we blew the bee up

2749
01:43:02,220 --> 01:43:03,620
to be human size?

2750
01:43:03,620 --> 01:43:04,540
Okay.

2751
01:43:04,540 --> 01:43:06,180
And that's where they landed on.

2752
01:43:06,180 --> 01:43:07,660
That's my guess.

2753
01:43:07,700 --> 01:43:10,060
Also, Buzz is, oh sorry, Buzz is not an intelligent guy.

2754
01:43:10,060 --> 01:43:11,340
I'm just gonna say, like, a Svelte bee,

2755
01:43:11,340 --> 01:43:12,660
it doesn't make sense.

2756
01:43:12,660 --> 01:43:14,940
Oh, did they get the type wrong?

2757
01:43:14,940 --> 01:43:16,700
I'm sorry if I interrupted.

2758
01:43:16,700 --> 01:43:17,620
No, no, no.

2759
01:43:17,620 --> 01:43:19,140
But there's like a different type of bee

2760
01:43:19,140 --> 01:43:20,620
that's like kind of fat.

2761
01:43:20,620 --> 01:43:22,380
A bumblebee kind of, yeah.

2762
01:43:22,380 --> 01:43:23,220
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2763
01:43:23,220 --> 01:43:24,060
I think so.

2764
01:43:24,060 --> 01:43:25,260
It's just got a big thorax, yeah.

2765
01:43:25,260 --> 01:43:26,100
Yeah, yeah.

2766
01:43:26,100 --> 01:43:27,580
It's an insect thing.

2767
01:43:27,580 --> 01:43:29,780
And I feel like they maybe got it right.

2768
01:43:29,780 --> 01:43:31,900
That's what I'm maybe leaning toward now.

2769
01:43:31,900 --> 01:43:34,140
That he, hmm, interesting.

2770
01:43:34,140 --> 01:43:36,780
I just don't, I picture him, like,

2771
01:43:36,780 --> 01:43:39,100
he's Svelte to me.

2772
01:43:39,100 --> 01:43:41,420
Now, would I give this guy a hug?

2773
01:43:41,420 --> 01:43:42,260
Absolutely.

2774
01:43:42,260 --> 01:43:44,180
Because I think maybe they were thinking

2775
01:43:44,180 --> 01:43:46,100
he has to be our Winnie the Pooh.

2776
01:43:46,100 --> 01:43:49,220
He's our most huggable character.

2777
01:43:49,220 --> 01:43:52,140
And he's got similar coloration to Winnie.

2778
01:43:52,140 --> 01:43:55,220
So I would love to hug this character.

2779
01:43:55,220 --> 01:43:56,060
That I will say.

2780
01:43:56,060 --> 01:43:56,980
That's not in question.

2781
01:43:56,980 --> 01:43:59,260
I just think of it as a curious choice made here.

2782
01:43:59,260 --> 01:44:03,100
I think he looks, if you look up like 70s Cheerios bee,

2783
01:44:03,100 --> 01:44:04,700
he looks a little more like this.

2784
01:44:04,700 --> 01:44:07,460
You're thinking of like 90s cool,

2785
01:44:07,460 --> 01:44:10,540
exercising a lot Cheerios bee.

2786
01:44:10,540 --> 01:44:12,660
You're thinking of like the new hip version.

2787
01:44:12,660 --> 01:44:15,700
I think the old one looks a little bit more like this.

2788
01:44:15,700 --> 01:44:19,460
Well, the Buzz the Bee, that's the strongest to me.

2789
01:44:19,460 --> 01:44:20,620
If you're on the second gate,

2790
01:44:20,620 --> 01:44:22,540
then you just met our good friend Andrew Grissom,

2791
01:44:22,540 --> 01:44:23,360
who was on the show.

2792
01:44:23,360 --> 01:44:25,500
And he, for many years, has been obsessed with this.

2793
01:44:25,500 --> 01:44:30,100
There was a commercial that paired up Buzz the Bee

2794
01:44:30,100 --> 01:44:34,300
and Nellie way after the Nellie hits.

2795
01:44:35,060 --> 01:44:35,980
The only thing I know about it,

2796
01:44:35,980 --> 01:44:37,820
is something Andrew says all the time still,

2797
01:44:37,820 --> 01:44:39,900
which is, good morning Nellie.

2798
01:44:42,500 --> 01:44:45,260
I mean, just the concept of greeting Nellie

2799
01:44:45,260 --> 01:44:47,340
with good morning is just very funny.

2800
01:44:47,340 --> 01:44:48,740
What situation have you ended,

2801
01:44:48,740 --> 01:44:50,820
besides if you're someone who has slept with Nellie,

2802
01:44:50,820 --> 01:44:52,500
in what situation is like one of us

2803
01:44:52,500 --> 01:44:54,740
saying good morning to Nellie?

2804
01:44:54,740 --> 01:44:56,900
He's got an early recording session.

2805
01:44:56,900 --> 01:44:57,740
And you're just setting up.

2806
01:44:57,740 --> 01:45:00,860
And it's like 11.30, I guess I can say good morning.

2807
01:45:00,860 --> 01:45:03,180
He's after us at Forever Dog.

2808
01:45:03,180 --> 01:45:04,020
We gotta get out of here, Nellie's coming in.

2809
01:45:04,020 --> 01:45:05,300
Good morning Nellie.

2810
01:45:05,300 --> 01:45:08,940
I'll refresh the K cups in case you want a cup of coffee.

2811
01:45:08,940 --> 01:45:10,540
Yeah, after podcast the ride leaves,

2812
01:45:10,540 --> 01:45:12,540
Nellie comes in and cuts some tracks.

2813
01:45:13,980 --> 01:45:16,960
Just seated at a table studio

2814
01:45:16,960 --> 01:45:17,800
with a bunch of unused microphones.

2815
01:45:17,800 --> 01:45:19,460
It's a table studio.

2816
01:45:20,420 --> 01:45:21,500
He prefers to sit.

2817
01:45:21,500 --> 01:45:23,220
Rick Rubin goes in the other room.

2818
01:45:24,820 --> 01:45:25,780
Works the boards.

2819
01:45:27,820 --> 01:45:29,660
Anyways, so, well there it is.

2820
01:45:29,660 --> 01:45:30,500
There it is.

2821
01:45:30,500 --> 01:45:31,340
That is a thin movie.

2822
01:45:31,500 --> 01:45:33,220
Jordan or Rick Rubin, Jordan.

2823
01:45:33,220 --> 01:45:36,820
Yeah, Scott's thinking of this new, like, svelte bee.

2824
01:45:36,820 --> 01:45:41,820
Yes, and the most iconic one to me is good morning, Nellie.

2825
01:45:41,900 --> 01:45:43,580
Look how confused Nellie is.

2826
01:45:43,580 --> 01:45:46,180
The most iconic one is when he's with Ebenezer Scrooge,

2827
01:45:46,180 --> 01:45:47,380
and I feel like he's a little bigger.

2828
01:45:47,380 --> 01:45:48,460
Oh, right.

2829
01:45:48,460 --> 01:45:50,860
With like a real Dickensian screw.

2830
01:45:50,860 --> 01:45:52,980
That adds like shot well is what I recall.

2831
01:45:52,980 --> 01:45:54,380
Yeah, that one's like a Christmas special.

2832
01:45:54,380 --> 01:45:57,180
Scott, because this is the same thing with Chuck E. Cheese,

2833
01:45:57,580 --> 01:46:02,580
he's like a cool, young, more svelte Chuck, I feel like.

2834
01:46:02,620 --> 01:46:05,140
And the old one was, he was definitely not like

2835
01:46:05,140 --> 01:46:07,620
watching what he ate as much, probably.

2836
01:46:07,620 --> 01:46:09,580
In the 70s, diets were different.

2837
01:46:09,580 --> 01:46:10,620
Yeah.

2838
01:46:10,620 --> 01:46:12,980
Or 80s, I guess, by that point.

2839
01:46:12,980 --> 01:46:15,420
I guess, is there anything I can get out of this

2840
01:46:15,420 --> 01:46:17,180
Opryland thing other than like,

2841
01:46:18,300 --> 01:46:20,020
you guys like these characters?

2842
01:46:20,020 --> 01:46:21,420
You like Frank?

2843
01:46:21,420 --> 01:46:24,060
Well, if we know Count Chocula was there,

2844
01:46:24,060 --> 01:46:26,300
do you feel sad you maybe missed an opportunity

2845
01:46:26,300 --> 01:46:28,460
to like give him a hug or a high five?

2846
01:46:28,460 --> 01:46:29,620
I absolutely do, yeah.

2847
01:46:29,620 --> 01:46:30,940
Wow. Yeah, 100%.

2848
01:46:30,940 --> 01:46:32,100
Yeah, it's too good.

2849
01:46:32,100 --> 01:46:34,940
Yeah, these characters, I'm sure I've said this before,

2850
01:46:34,940 --> 01:46:38,500
that they, like, I'm surprised that they haven't done more,

2851
01:46:38,500 --> 01:46:40,980
I'm surprised there's no show about them.

2852
01:46:40,980 --> 01:46:44,220
I like, I feel like people have such affection

2853
01:46:44,220 --> 01:46:46,380
for these characters and want to hug them

2854
01:46:46,380 --> 01:46:48,020
and want to see them more.

2855
01:46:48,020 --> 01:46:51,740
And I'm surprised that it hasn't happened in some way.

2856
01:46:51,740 --> 01:46:55,580
I feel like it's tough now that it's like glorifying

2857
01:46:55,620 --> 01:46:57,060
eating unhealthy, like the same way

2858
01:46:57,060 --> 01:46:59,180
like they've kind of phased out McDonald's characters

2859
01:46:59,180 --> 01:47:01,420
as much as I would love to hug the Grimace.

2860
01:47:01,420 --> 01:47:02,260
I think they're just like,

2861
01:47:02,260 --> 01:47:04,180
well, we don't use them anymore, it's a different time.

2862
01:47:04,180 --> 01:47:07,380
But I guess the solution is get cause involved,

2863
01:47:07,380 --> 01:47:10,900
get Cactus Plant flea market involved.

2864
01:47:10,900 --> 01:47:13,180
But that's more of like a cool retro thing for adults,

2865
01:47:13,180 --> 01:47:15,500
exactly, than like get an eight-year-old excited

2866
01:47:15,500 --> 01:47:16,540
about sugar cereal.

2867
01:47:16,540 --> 01:47:19,580
Yeah, so maybe you could do an adult show.

2868
01:47:19,580 --> 01:47:21,740
I would love an adult Count Chocula show, yes.

2869
01:47:21,740 --> 01:47:24,260
Yeah, yeah, something a little more mature.

2870
01:47:24,260 --> 01:47:27,300
An article I came across reading about this stuff

2871
01:47:27,300 --> 01:47:31,020
is like, why aren't there toys in cereal anymore?

2872
01:47:31,020 --> 01:47:34,340
And it was just like, oh, kids play with toys less.

2873
01:47:34,340 --> 01:47:35,700
They just want tablets.

2874
01:47:35,700 --> 01:47:38,140
And it's like, well, that's sad.

2875
01:47:38,140 --> 01:47:39,660
That seems discouraging.

2876
01:47:39,660 --> 01:47:40,980
Yeah, also might not be true.

2877
01:47:40,980 --> 01:47:42,460
Yeah, also might not be true.

2878
01:47:42,460 --> 01:47:44,820
Not my little, but my kid's little though.

2879
01:47:44,820 --> 01:47:46,780
I, you know, south of three,

2880
01:47:46,780 --> 01:47:48,980
I think toys are still in vogue, but we will see.

2881
01:47:48,980 --> 01:47:51,060
If you offer a kid a tablet or a boo-hoo,

2882
01:47:51,060 --> 01:47:53,340
like we know what they're gonna pick.

2883
01:47:53,340 --> 01:47:55,300
You can't boo your friends with a tablet.

2884
01:47:55,300 --> 01:47:56,220
Of course.

2885
01:47:56,220 --> 01:47:58,140
Maybe there's an app for it though.

2886
01:47:58,140 --> 01:47:59,580
But it's not the same.

2887
01:47:59,580 --> 01:48:01,620
A boo-hoo-ter is so tactile.

2888
01:48:03,020 --> 01:48:06,620
There is, when you say adult versions of these characters,

2889
01:48:06,620 --> 01:48:10,380
I did everyone the favor of not putting this on the main.

2890
01:48:10,380 --> 01:48:14,420
But with these characters, I have to do the R34 search.

2891
01:48:14,420 --> 01:48:18,260
I have to know if there's any pornographic presence.

2892
01:48:18,260 --> 01:48:19,500
And there is a little bit,

2893
01:48:19,500 --> 01:48:22,500
and this is a very immature black and white sketch,

2894
01:48:22,500 --> 01:48:24,060
but I feel like done with love.

2895
01:48:24,060 --> 01:48:26,660
And I will show, Mike Carlson, you'll miss this,

2896
01:48:26,660 --> 01:48:28,060
but you guys will see.

2897
01:48:28,060 --> 01:48:29,060
That's okay.

2898
01:48:29,060 --> 01:48:29,900
Oh my gosh.

2899
01:48:29,900 --> 01:48:33,780
What you're seeing is Count Chocula,

2900
01:48:33,780 --> 01:48:37,420
basically Count Chocula is very happily

2901
01:48:37,420 --> 01:48:38,500
pleasuring himself.

2902
01:48:38,500 --> 01:48:40,380
I'll censor it even for the video.

2903
01:48:40,380 --> 01:48:41,780
I'll put it behind her logo.

2904
01:48:41,780 --> 01:48:43,900
Wait, she's, describe it.

2905
01:48:43,900 --> 01:48:45,380
Somebody, Jason, describe it for me.

2906
01:48:45,380 --> 01:48:46,740
Oh yeah, somebody, yeah, okay.

2907
01:48:46,740 --> 01:48:49,580
Is he, he's shooting out Boo-Berry.

2908
01:48:49,580 --> 01:48:50,940
He's nutting Boo-Berry.

2909
01:48:50,940 --> 01:48:52,700
Yes, Boo-Berry is the cum.

2910
01:48:52,700 --> 01:48:53,860
Boo-Berry's cum.

2911
01:48:53,860 --> 01:48:55,780
Oh wow, okay.

2912
01:48:55,780 --> 01:48:59,860
So he's, he's pleasuring himself with his hand, yes?

2913
01:48:59,860 --> 01:49:03,260
Yeah, and let's be, let's give him due credit.

2914
01:49:03,260 --> 01:49:04,700
He is huge.

2915
01:49:04,700 --> 01:49:07,300
And there was a thing in the 70s called Boo-Berry cum,

2916
01:49:07,300 --> 01:49:09,620
where it was turning your cum blue for a while.

2917
01:49:09,620 --> 01:49:12,780
I'm sure they removed that.

2918
01:49:12,780 --> 01:49:15,060
Bright blue, electric blue.

2919
01:49:18,340 --> 01:49:20,380
So I mean, this is a creative,

2920
01:49:20,420 --> 01:49:22,340
this is a great way to get the characters together

2921
01:49:22,340 --> 01:49:23,180
to marry the universe.

2922
01:49:23,180 --> 01:49:26,140
To turn one into the ejaculate of another.

2923
01:49:28,740 --> 01:49:30,260
This is less extreme than that,

2924
01:49:30,260 --> 01:49:33,180
but one of the Google fill-ins for Count Chocula,

2925
01:49:33,180 --> 01:49:35,620
this is a very vexing question.

2926
01:49:35,620 --> 01:49:37,540
It's just like, where can you get Count Chocula?

2927
01:49:37,540 --> 01:49:38,660
What were the monster cereals?

2928
01:49:38,660 --> 01:49:41,820
And then is Count Chocula a girlfriend?

2929
01:49:44,420 --> 01:49:46,700
Not does he have one?

2930
01:49:46,700 --> 01:49:48,660
Now is he. Is he girlfriend?

2931
01:49:48,700 --> 01:49:50,940
Is he a girlfriend?

2932
01:49:50,940 --> 01:49:52,780
I don't know how to answer that question.

2933
01:49:52,780 --> 01:49:54,980
Yeah, did anyone answer that online?

2934
01:49:54,980 --> 01:49:58,740
The answer that you get is not related to it.

2935
01:49:58,740 --> 01:50:00,220
Like Google gave up.

2936
01:50:00,220 --> 01:50:03,620
They didn't know how to tackle this, the great mystery.

2937
01:50:05,060 --> 01:50:08,700
So anyway, I mean, we've done a lot of tackling

2938
01:50:08,700 --> 01:50:09,540
of the mystery.

2939
01:50:09,540 --> 01:50:12,660
Are there any final thoughts about this gang?

2940
01:50:12,660 --> 01:50:14,700
I've loved talking about them for a while.

2941
01:50:14,700 --> 01:50:18,940
Yeah, I'm always surprised at,

2942
01:50:18,940 --> 01:50:21,900
cause I think a lot of people perk up at these,

2943
01:50:21,900 --> 01:50:22,940
these specific characters.

2944
01:50:22,940 --> 01:50:24,620
People love cereal from their childhood

2945
01:50:24,620 --> 01:50:25,580
and all the mascots in general,

2946
01:50:25,580 --> 01:50:27,780
but these characters specifically, I think,

2947
01:50:27,780 --> 01:50:28,860
really sparked something.

2948
01:50:28,860 --> 01:50:31,460
And just real quick, I don't have the clip.

2949
01:50:31,460 --> 01:50:33,620
I don't even know if we could ever play it,

2950
01:50:33,620 --> 01:50:37,260
but Jason and I shot a thing about a decade ago

2951
01:50:37,260 --> 01:50:40,100
with some professional wrestlers.

2952
01:50:40,100 --> 01:50:44,820
And Jason and professional wrestler, Rob Van Dam

2953
01:50:44,820 --> 01:50:49,820
ended up in an improv, an improvised scene

2954
01:50:50,660 --> 01:50:53,500
about monster cereal, because Jason in the middle

2955
01:50:53,500 --> 01:50:56,540
of an improv with some other professional wrestlers

2956
01:50:56,540 --> 01:50:58,980
started talking about monster cereals.

2957
01:50:58,980 --> 01:51:01,540
And Rob Van Dam perked up like I've never seen

2958
01:51:01,540 --> 01:51:04,740
a human being before and got so excited.

2959
01:51:04,740 --> 01:51:07,380
And then we added it in where Jason and Rob Van Dam

2960
01:51:07,420 --> 01:51:10,340
discussed monster cereals,

2961
01:51:10,340 --> 01:51:12,540
because he was so excited about it.

2962
01:51:13,540 --> 01:51:17,740
So I'm always impressed with the reach of these characters

2963
01:51:17,740 --> 01:51:20,140
and how much affection people have for them.

2964
01:51:20,140 --> 01:51:21,860
Who would have thought the monster cereals

2965
01:51:21,860 --> 01:51:24,860
would appeal to a stoner like Rob Van Dam?

2966
01:51:24,860 --> 01:51:25,700
It's a very good point.

2967
01:51:25,700 --> 01:51:27,340
Who could have seen that coming?

2968
01:51:27,340 --> 01:51:29,620
He's high 24 seven, so you're correct.

2969
01:51:29,620 --> 01:51:31,180
Maybe that wasn't a big reach

2970
01:51:31,180 --> 01:51:32,980
that he would have affection for that.

2971
01:51:32,980 --> 01:51:35,300
That's what I, when I saw the fruit brute

2972
01:51:35,300 --> 01:51:36,580
in those Tarantino movies,

2973
01:51:36,580 --> 01:51:39,860
I feel like I clocked it the first or second time

2974
01:51:39,860 --> 01:51:41,980
I saw those movies and I was like,

2975
01:51:41,980 --> 01:51:44,700
is this trying to communicate that adults

2976
01:51:44,700 --> 01:51:47,340
who eat these cereals are dirtbags?

2977
01:51:47,340 --> 01:51:49,860
Because Eric Stultz is a dirtbag,

2978
01:51:49,860 --> 01:51:53,020
Tim Roth is undercover, but he's kind of sleazy.

2979
01:51:53,020 --> 01:51:55,420
I think any adult eating cereal in media

2980
01:51:55,420 --> 01:51:56,260
is meant to be like, well,

2981
01:51:56,260 --> 01:51:58,100
they don't have their shit together.

2982
01:51:58,100 --> 01:51:59,060
Yes. Yeah.

2983
01:51:59,060 --> 01:52:00,820
That's a good shorthand.

2984
01:52:00,820 --> 01:52:03,020
Are you guys offended by that?

2985
01:52:03,020 --> 01:52:04,060
Not really. No.

2986
01:52:05,020 --> 01:52:07,100
It's efficient and filling,

2987
01:52:07,100 --> 01:52:09,100
and sometimes you just need to get the job done.

2988
01:52:09,100 --> 01:52:10,420
Yeah, show don't tell, I get it.

2989
01:52:10,420 --> 01:52:12,580
Yeah, fine.

2990
01:52:12,580 --> 01:52:14,700
Economy of storytelling.

2991
01:52:14,700 --> 01:52:15,540
Here's a question.

2992
01:52:15,540 --> 01:52:16,740
We talked at the beginning,

2993
01:52:16,740 --> 01:52:18,340
this was in the show, not before the show, right,

2994
01:52:18,340 --> 01:52:21,060
about the monster, the universal maze

2995
01:52:21,060 --> 01:52:26,060
where one monster wins and takes the head off the other.

2996
01:52:26,980 --> 01:52:31,980
Mike, if you had to pick one to defeat the others

2997
01:52:31,980 --> 01:52:35,860
and hold up their bloody heads triumphantly.

2998
01:52:35,860 --> 01:52:39,900
I'm gonna go with Boo Barry because

2999
01:52:41,340 --> 01:52:44,380
Franken Barry and Count Chocula are scared of Boo Barry

3000
01:52:44,380 --> 01:52:46,260
in a way that he's not scared of them.

3001
01:52:46,260 --> 01:52:47,140
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

3002
01:52:47,140 --> 01:52:48,980
So it makes the most sense that he, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3003
01:52:48,980 --> 01:52:52,540
He is fearless, impervious, and-

3004
01:52:52,540 --> 01:52:55,540
And you can kill a vampire.

3005
01:52:55,540 --> 01:52:57,260
I don't know if you can kill a ghost.

3006
01:52:57,260 --> 01:52:58,220
Oh, that's true.

3007
01:52:58,220 --> 01:52:59,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3008
01:52:59,060 --> 01:53:00,660
He might have, yeah, he's already dead,

3009
01:53:00,660 --> 01:53:02,180
so what else do you do?

3010
01:53:02,180 --> 01:53:03,140
Wow, wow.

3011
01:53:03,140 --> 01:53:06,180
So Boo Barry triumphant.

3012
01:53:06,180 --> 01:53:08,100
But look, they're all winners,

3013
01:53:08,100 --> 01:53:10,060
except maybe the, we didn't talk about the mummy a lot.

3014
01:53:10,060 --> 01:53:11,900
I feel like we don't like the mummy that much.

3015
01:53:11,900 --> 01:53:12,980
Okay, all right, all right.

3016
01:53:12,980 --> 01:53:15,100
So both sides of the party, you know.

3017
01:53:15,100 --> 01:53:17,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're nice to him, but.

3018
01:53:17,380 --> 01:53:21,180
Yeah, cool design, but I truly have no,

3019
01:53:21,180 --> 01:53:23,900
I think I remember one or two of the commercials,

3020
01:53:23,900 --> 01:53:27,100
but like going pretty fast, you know.

3021
01:53:27,100 --> 01:53:27,940
Yeah.

3022
01:53:27,940 --> 01:53:28,940
They do a lot of other products.

3023
01:53:28,940 --> 01:53:32,980
They make a yogurt, which sounds gross, fruit roll-ups,

3024
01:53:32,980 --> 01:53:34,260
and you guys can try them or not.

3025
01:53:34,260 --> 01:53:36,340
I did bake some monster cookies.

3026
01:53:36,340 --> 01:53:37,860
Well, saying bake is very generous,

3027
01:53:37,860 --> 01:53:38,940
because they're like the pre-made,

3028
01:53:38,940 --> 01:53:40,780
you just put them in the oven.

3029
01:53:40,780 --> 01:53:42,500
But if you want to try them after this, I have some.

3030
01:53:42,500 --> 01:53:43,340
Wow.

3031
01:53:43,340 --> 01:53:44,180
Oh, wow, thank you.

3032
01:53:44,180 --> 01:53:45,980
Oh my God, absolutely, oh geez.

3033
01:53:45,980 --> 01:53:47,580
Okay, well then let's wind it down

3034
01:53:47,580 --> 01:53:48,940
so we can have these cookies,

3035
01:53:48,940 --> 01:53:51,860
everyone except for Carlson who's not in the room.

3036
01:53:51,860 --> 01:53:53,140
That's okay, I'll go buy some.

3037
01:53:53,140 --> 01:53:54,340
In the spirit of, yeah.

3038
01:53:54,340 --> 01:53:55,820
Well, and let's, I can't believe we didn't try,

3039
01:53:55,820 --> 01:53:58,780
I feel like maybe I gotta like separately buy one of these.

3040
01:53:59,620 --> 01:54:01,020
Scott, you've never tried any of these.

3041
01:54:01,020 --> 01:54:02,380
Nope, no.

3042
01:54:02,380 --> 01:54:03,300
Wow.

3043
01:54:03,300 --> 01:54:04,980
Maybe I need to do a little,

3044
01:54:04,980 --> 01:54:07,940
what if I do a little social media content,

3045
01:54:07,940 --> 01:54:09,100
and let's just spit balling,

3046
01:54:09,100 --> 01:54:11,540
maybe I call it like snack or whack, I don't know.

3047
01:54:11,540 --> 01:54:14,940
And just to see what, oh, here's a lineup.

3048
01:54:14,940 --> 01:54:16,020
Oh, thank you.

3049
01:54:16,020 --> 01:54:19,260
Well, I think this year it's four, right?

3050
01:54:19,260 --> 01:54:20,100
It's the original.

3051
01:54:20,100 --> 01:54:20,940
Yeah, Yummy Mummy's not around this year.

3052
01:54:20,940 --> 01:54:23,140
Three, Yummy Mummy is not back this year.

3053
01:54:23,140 --> 01:54:25,100
They keep saying the return of for the other two,

3054
01:54:25,100 --> 01:54:27,300
so yeah, maybe they keep shifting.

3055
01:54:27,940 --> 01:54:28,780
These were the years,

3056
01:54:28,780 --> 01:54:31,900
on the bottom were the years I got all five, I remember.

3057
01:54:31,900 --> 01:54:36,180
What are you the most curious to have me try?

3058
01:54:36,180 --> 01:54:37,860
I don't know, is it like the one I would like the most,

3059
01:54:37,860 --> 01:54:39,580
or the one I would like the least?

3060
01:54:39,580 --> 01:54:41,420
Or the underdog?

3061
01:54:43,340 --> 01:54:46,300
I mean, I'll just buy whatever I can find, but.

3062
01:54:46,300 --> 01:54:49,260
God, I think you should try probably Boo Berry.

3063
01:54:49,260 --> 01:54:50,100
I think so.

3064
01:54:50,100 --> 01:54:51,260
Okay, okay.

3065
01:54:52,540 --> 01:54:54,380
Well, that's another thing that Boo Berry won.

3066
01:54:54,380 --> 01:54:55,940
Boo Berry's coming out on top, and you know what?

3067
01:54:56,420 --> 01:54:58,460
I'll be rooting for liking it.

3068
01:54:58,460 --> 01:55:01,460
I'll be booing and hooting if I like it.

3069
01:55:02,860 --> 01:55:04,540
Came out of this really liking Boo Berry.

3070
01:55:04,540 --> 01:55:06,380
So Boo Berry, I think the winner of the episode.

3071
01:55:06,380 --> 01:55:09,620
In 2016 they did, to tie in with the presidential election,

3072
01:55:09,620 --> 01:55:12,260
they did an election of president of monsters,

3073
01:55:12,260 --> 01:55:14,300
and Boo Berry lost, count shock to the one.

3074
01:55:14,300 --> 01:55:15,140
Oh, yeah.

3075
01:55:15,140 --> 01:55:15,980
Well, just name recognition.

3076
01:55:15,980 --> 01:55:18,420
But they even broke down by state.

3077
01:55:18,420 --> 01:55:19,260
Really? Yeah.

3078
01:55:20,420 --> 01:55:21,460
Three parties doesn't work.

3079
01:55:21,460 --> 01:55:23,140
Boo Berry only won three states.

3080
01:55:23,140 --> 01:55:26,060
Right, and Franket Berry, I think, only took Montana.

3081
01:55:28,740 --> 01:55:30,660
He only had one, yeah.

3082
01:55:30,660 --> 01:55:31,860
That's pretty funny.

3083
01:55:32,700 --> 01:55:35,940
But I think we can all agree in 2016,

3084
01:55:35,940 --> 01:55:38,100
dear God, I wish one of them had won for real.

3085
01:55:38,100 --> 01:55:38,940
Absolutely.

3086
01:55:38,940 --> 01:55:40,460
We'd be in much better shape.

3087
01:55:42,980 --> 01:55:45,340
But the true winner of the episode,

3088
01:55:45,340 --> 01:55:47,700
and the current, unless something happens with Tarantino,

3089
01:55:47,700 --> 01:55:50,740
the reigning champion for the cereals

3090
01:55:50,740 --> 01:55:52,380
and for Fruit Brute on the show,

3091
01:55:52,380 --> 01:55:54,540
Mike Scollins, you survived podcast,

3092
01:55:54,540 --> 01:55:56,260
the Haunt Cast the Fright.

3093
01:55:56,260 --> 01:55:58,020
You survived Haunt Cast the Fright.

3094
01:55:58,020 --> 01:56:01,020
Let's exit through the, we don't know, the spooky gift shop.

3095
01:56:01,020 --> 01:56:03,620
Is there anything you'd like to plug?

3096
01:56:03,620 --> 01:56:05,820
Not really, you can watch late night.

3097
01:56:05,820 --> 01:56:07,500
I perform on it quite a bit.

3098
01:56:07,500 --> 01:56:10,580
I was recently a Disney adult in an episode,

3099
01:56:10,580 --> 01:56:12,620
so maybe that's particularly relevant.

3100
01:56:12,620 --> 01:56:13,460
Interesting.

3101
01:56:13,460 --> 01:56:14,980
I played a Disney adult upset that

3102
01:56:14,980 --> 01:56:16,580
the park had gotten too woke.

3103
01:56:16,580 --> 01:56:18,140
Oh, wow.

3104
01:56:18,140 --> 01:56:21,660
Dude, this is an extremely real thing in the world.

3105
01:56:21,820 --> 01:56:24,340
Yeah, and this feels like the only place I can plug that

3106
01:56:24,340 --> 01:56:26,500
and be like, oh, maybe I actually would watch that.

3107
01:56:26,500 --> 01:56:27,340
Mm-hmm.

3108
01:56:28,940 --> 01:56:31,020
And based on your real views.

3109
01:56:31,020 --> 01:56:32,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it was such a sketch.

3110
01:56:32,620 --> 01:56:34,300
It was just like a treat.

3111
01:56:34,300 --> 01:56:35,140
Yeah.

3112
01:56:35,140 --> 01:56:36,900
If I gotta put on a different shirt or something

3113
01:56:36,900 --> 01:56:37,740
to make this work, but I just-

3114
01:56:37,740 --> 01:56:39,580
It's weird that Seth Meyers stepped away

3115
01:56:39,580 --> 01:56:42,580
and let you just do a soliloquy about like-

3116
01:56:42,580 --> 01:56:46,620
We bumped Ariana Grande.

3117
01:56:47,620 --> 01:56:48,900
Well, she's from Jersey.

3118
01:56:48,900 --> 01:56:50,780
She can come over the bridge, you know,

3119
01:56:50,780 --> 01:56:51,620
and she can come back.

3120
01:56:51,620 --> 01:56:53,420
She'll be back, she'll be back.

3121
01:56:53,420 --> 01:56:54,580
So happy to meet you.

3122
01:56:54,580 --> 01:56:56,340
