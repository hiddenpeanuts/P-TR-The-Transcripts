1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Warning!

4
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:23,280
The following live podcast was booked before we knew what temperature it would be.

5
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:29,840
If you need somewhere to cool down, please climb inside the Mirage Volcano.

6
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:36,960
If anyone here pre-gamed at a certain magician's restaurant, this venue may soon become a deadly

7
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:42,480
hotbox of kablip farts.

8
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:48,120
One of the hosts might leave the show after 15 minutes because he booked an extra loud,

9
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:56,600
extra douchey VIP cabana at Wet Republic.

10
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:01,640
Now live from the space Las Vegas just off the strip, it's Podcast the Right's Big Vegas

11
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:04,640
Groove Blender!

12
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:33,560
That theme song fucking slaps and I wrote it!

13
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,560
That's right!

14
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,560
Take it!

15
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:41,360
I'm like Steven Seagal with that screenplay.

16
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:46,360
I just heard the fucking jamminest song ever.

17
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,360
You did, you wrote the song.

18
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,360
No, no, you're supposed to ask me.

19
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,240
Wait, so who wrote that theme song?

20
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,240
I did.

21
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,240
Alright.

22
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,240
Take the win.

23
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,240
Take the win.

24
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,240
You did it.

25
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,520
And you know what?

26
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,760
All of you guys take the win as well because you were crazy enough to come to Las Vegas

27
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,360
for Podcast the Ride.

28
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,360
Oh my god!

29
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,360
Thank you.

30
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,360
You guys!

31
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:12,760
You came, we came, we're all insane.

32
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,760
Yeah.

33
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,840
I'm so thrilled to be in this insane room.

34
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,320
Welcome to Podcast the Ride.

35
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:22,160
I'm going to say for this moment a phrase I've been waiting to say for so long.

36
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,160
Welcome to Podcast the Ride's Big Vegas.

37
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,080
Groove Blender!

38
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,080
Wow!

39
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:36,080
Incredible airbrush art.

40
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,080
Befitting Camel Cigarettes in 1997.

41
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,080
So classy.

42
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:50,520
I should say by the way, Podcast the Ride, a show hosted by three justice advocates who

43
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:57,960
said we will never do a show in Las Vegas until there is a warrant issued in the case

44
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,960
of Tupac Shakur.

45
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,960
They got it done!

46
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,960
They did do it, yeah.

47
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,960
Right before, right on time.

48
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,960
All they had to do was pull this whole thing.

49
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:12,960
Yeah, we were waiting for the police to do something.

50
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,960
Finally!

51
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,960
We're back on board.

52
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,960
25 years, but they got it.

53
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,400
Thanks!

54
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,400
Please!

55
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,400
My name is Scott Gardner.

56
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,400
Hi everybody.

57
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,400
So good to see you.

58
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,400
Down the line?

59
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,400
Yeah, I'm Jason Sheridan.

60
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,400
Thank you.

61
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:40,400
Mike Carlson, nice to meet you.

62
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,400
Wow.

63
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:48,400
I don't think we should be done with applause because I'm going to ask for applause that

64
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,840
will answer some questions that I have.

65
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:53,840
Who, by round of applause, Las Vegas locals?

66
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,840
Not bad.

67
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,840
Like 25 people.

68
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,840
Wow, wow, that's pretty good.

69
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,840
Who traveled for this?

70
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,840
Who traveled to be here?

71
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,840
Yeah!

72
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,840
Wow.

73
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,840
Incredible, incredible.

74
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,840
Thank you.

75
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,840
It's so honored, so honored that you would.

76
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,840
That cost money.

77
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:17,840
That's a whole thing to do.

78
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:23,280
And you also had to explain to people in your lives.

79
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:28,280
Oh, you got an insert to Suleik?

80
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,280
No.

81
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,280
Not that.

82
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,280
Garth Brooks, perhaps?

83
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,280
No.

84
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,280
They talked about him once.

85
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,280
They talked about when he put a wig on.

86
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,280
By the way, Jason.

87
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,280
Oh yeah.

88
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,280
Show it off.

89
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:46,280
You know, Garth is on stage a couple miles away.

90
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,720
It's Caesar's.

91
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:52,720
And I just, you know, wanted to pay tribute to him as we're also treading the boards.

92
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,720
We're performers, brothers.

93
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,720
What?

94
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,720
And that's theatrical arts.

95
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,720
You're saying we're like Garth.

96
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,720
I'm saying all of us.

97
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,720
The three of us, Garth.

98
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,720
Yeah.

99
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,720
We just want to put on a nice show for the wonderful people.

100
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,720
Yes, that's right.

101
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,720
You're right.

102
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,720
Now let's change into our alter ego costumes.

103
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,720
Soul Patches out, everyone.

104
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:23,160
No, this is so incredible and that everybody would make the effort here.

105
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:28,160
I, Jason, I think you had some odds and ends you wanted to take care of here at the time.

106
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,160
Oh yeah.

107
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:34,160
I got into some Sin City Nights hijinks in the last few days.

108
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,160
Who's listened to the MGM Grand Adventure episode?

109
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:40,160
Thank you so much.

110
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:45,600
So, Jane and I just got approved for an apartment together.

111
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,600
Very exciting.

112
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:52,600
And, you know, we got to a point, the point where they're like, oh, can you please send

113
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,600
a federal tax return?

114
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,600
And I...

115
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,600
Federal tax return?

116
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,600
Well, just send a tax return.

117
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,600
We just need proof of income, you know?

118
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,600
Okay, gotcha, gotcha.

119
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:11,040
And I had just cleaned off my desktop of my laptop for the first time in ages.

120
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:18,040
And I had two PDFs on there and one was indeed a federal tax return.

121
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:23,040
Unfortunately, they were very nice about this, but I sent them something and they're like,

122
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:26,040
hey, I think you sent the wrong thing.

123
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:29,040
That is not a tax return.

124
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:38,480
And what I sent them was a PDF titled Apocalypse Now MGM Grand Theme Park Concept Storyline.

125
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:49,480
Which, if you haven't heard it, is something we were passed privately by a listener.

126
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:55,480
There was a proposal for an Apocalypse Now boat ride that was going to be very close

127
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,480
to here.

128
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,480
It could have been there.

129
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,920
It could have saved the whole thing.

130
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:06,920
Maybe the show would be happening at the MGM, at the King Louis Theater or whatever the

131
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,920
hell it was.

132
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,920
Were the labels of the files similar?

133
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:14,920
No, I'm telling you, I just had two PDFs on the desktop and I dragged...

134
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,920
And you closed your eyes and guessed.

135
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:17,920
I dragged and dropped.

136
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,920
It got me in trouble and, you know, it hit send.

137
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,920
How far do you think they got?

138
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:26,920
The building manager got into reading the proposal and was like, this dark ride wouldn't

139
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,360
have worked.

140
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,360
I'm not letting this guy have an apartment.

141
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:38,360
You know, I watched some of it on YouTube and they did use some of that proposal, but

142
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:41,360
Apocalypse Now, what were they thinking?

143
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,360
But you got approved despite...

144
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,360
We didn't approve despite that.

145
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,360
Yeah, this didn't kill the entire thing.

146
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,360
You sent the real thing.

147
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,360
We didn't approve despite that.

148
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,360
Alright, great.

149
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:54,360
My other piece of business involves this shirt.

150
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,360
Oh!

151
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,360
Because...

152
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,800
I'm not taking it off.

153
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,800
He took his shirt off at the last live show.

154
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,800
Last live show we did.

155
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:05,800
Well, maybe I should change my rule there.

156
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,800
Yeah, take it off if you want.

157
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,800
It's very hot out.

158
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:17,800
I thought, oh, I'll just get like a bootleg one and I found one on Etsy and what I got

159
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:24,800
was like the most like fucked up bootleg I've ever seen.

160
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,800
Oh no!

161
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,240
The bootleg has wrinkles.

162
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:32,240
There's a spot you can see where the decal stuck.

163
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:38,240
One side of the decal stuck to the other and when I opened it, it made a disconcerting

164
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,240
noise.

165
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:42,240
And this is already like a tent.

166
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,240
The shirt screamed when you opened it.

167
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,240
Yeah.

168
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,240
It looks like Chris Gaines, Garth Brooks says Chris Gaines has a bunch of scars all over

169
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,240
his face.

170
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:55,240
And the mythology of Garth Brooks alter ego Chris Gaines, if you didn't hear it in our

171
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,680
episode is that he was in a terrible car accident.

172
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:03,680
So finally, Chris Gaines is as ugly as Garth Brooks thinks he is.

173
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,680
Yeah.

174
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,680
Can I ask a question?

175
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,680
So you, wait, so you bought this first and then you went not good enough.

176
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,680
Not good enough.

177
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:17,680
I need to go to respectable bootlegger T-Public, your home for the finest bootlegs and also

178
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,680
podcast merchandise around.

179
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,680
Yes, I see a few.

180
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,680
There are some here.

181
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,680
What's your plan with the shirt?

182
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:30,120
So my plan with the shirt is there someone here tonight who posted in our Facebook group,

183
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:36,120
my wife and I are celebrating our anniversary in Vegas and it'll be fun to come to this

184
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,120
show.

185
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,120
Oh, yeah.

186
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:43,120
Well, well, happy anniversary.

187
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,120
Come on up.

188
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,120
You got it.

189
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,120
So wait, wait, wait.

190
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,120
So you're giving.

191
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,120
Happy anniversary.

192
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,560
Two people, one shirt.

193
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,560
One shirt.

194
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,560
To the prize.

195
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,560
You can pass it back and forth.

196
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:00,560
Happy anniversary from me.

197
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,560
Here, so somebody, do you have a phone?

198
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,560
You want to take a photo with Jason or all three of us, I guess?

199
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,560
No, you know what?

200
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,560
Just Jason.

201
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,560
I just said, no, I don't want any partners.

202
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,560
This nasty shirt giveaway that he's planned.

203
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,560
I'll take the, you know what?

204
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,560
I'll take the photo.

205
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,560
Does anybody have the phone?

206
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,560
Yeah, here.

207
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,560
Don't you?

208
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:20,560
My phone's on the thing here.

209
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,560
Let's take this photo here.

210
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
OK.

211
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
OK.

212
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
This is more, this is for them to like raise on a flagpole is what they'll do.

213
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Yeah, this is great.

214
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Beautiful.

215
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Wow.

216
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Wow.

217
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
So congratulations, you crazy kids.

218
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Thanks for coming out tonight.

219
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Thanks so much.

220
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
What's your name?

221
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Happy anniversary.

222
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Mariana and Adam.

223
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Awesome.

224
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Happy anniversary.

225
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Oh my gosh.

226
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Fantastic.

227
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,440
Well, that's all my bullshit, so I'm going to head out.

228
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,440
You did your trash giveaway?

229
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:02,440
Jason's trash pile, which is a usual live segment now, I think.

230
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,440
Yeah.

231
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:09,440
Look, I can't guarantee that shirt is not made of discount vinyl siding and asbestos.

232
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,440
I can't say it is.

233
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,440
I can't say it isn't.

234
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,440
Just leave it outside.

235
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,440
Don't bring it inside your home.

236
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,440
Poison you all immediately.

237
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,440
Anyway, yes.

238
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:24,040
This is part of, we've considered this the centerpiece of our podcast, the Ride Sin City

239
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,520
Nights series.

240
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:29,800
And we're so happy we get to actually have a Sin City Night with all of you.

241
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:37,240
We also, this is only the second groove blender in Las Vegas history.

242
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:41,020
So we're making history tonight.

243
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:44,880
First one done by the good people at Camel Cigarettes.

244
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,600
And now we take the mantle.

245
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:54,760
We just had sword swallowers and live camels and blues brothers impersonators.

246
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:55,760
And guess what?

247
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,760
We got all that shit too.

248
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,760
It's all coming out.

249
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,760
You're going to see all of it.

250
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,720
There's so many camels backstage.

251
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,720
They gave us a discount.

252
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:11,360
But if we said, if you take 12, one will be free.

253
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,560
Imagine an amount of camels.

254
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,560
Double it.

255
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,520
Damn.

256
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:20,760
Now imagine a room that you think could fit that many camels.

257
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:21,760
Half it.

258
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,760
Half it.

259
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:25,560
Then put sword swallowers in there.

260
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:28,480
And the camels who haven't eaten today, they're hungry.

261
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,240
You can't, you gotta forgive them for swallowing the sword swallowers' swords.

262
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,240
Yeah.

263
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,240
You understand.

264
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,240
Yeah, yeah.

265
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,240
If you are a desperate camel.

266
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,560
Anyway, we're going to let them loose in hour six.

267
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,840
This is a 15 hour event.

268
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,360
I hope you're aware.

269
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,360
We're going.

270
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,480
We're going all night.

271
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,480
The live stream will cut off.

272
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,920
But you guys will be here for the real shit.

273
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,960
Hi everybody on the live stream, by the way.

274
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:51,960
Wow.

275
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:52,960
Hi to my parents.

276
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:56,040
I'm sorry I said shit.

277
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,040
More of that coming though.

278
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:02,280
Cause it's Vegas and we're getting a body.

279
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:09,880
But before we, if you can imagine a guest who is even better than blues brothers impersonators,

280
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,120
if that's even possible.

281
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:18,480
The real reason you guys are so lucky to be here tonight is for the guest that we have.

282
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,360
Somebody who, who we love very much.

283
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,680
One of our favorite folks in the world.

284
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:27,360
Somebody who's done all manner of bullshit that you could possibly do with podcasts the

285
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,560
ride except for participate in a live show.

286
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,400
And that ends tonight.

287
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,080
Please give the warmest of Las Vegas.

288
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:39,080
Eva Anderson.

289
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:42,080
Yeah.

290
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,400
Wow.

291
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:50,880
The best in the biz here for you.

292
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,080
I also have a shirt to reveal.

293
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:57,080
Oh boy.

294
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,840
Wow.

295
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,520
Race through New York.

296
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,400
Jimmy Fallon's race through New York.

297
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,760
Jimmy found that tonight.

298
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:05,760
Wow.

299
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:09,440
The real tonight rider.

300
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,760
But at the actual gift shop outside of the ride.

301
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,760
Wow.

302
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,680
Oh wait and what you were, we haven't talked to you so much about.

303
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,680
You were in Orlando.

304
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,680
I was in Orlando last month and I did buy this shirt there.

305
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:21,680
And I also bought a hat.

306
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:22,680
Wow.

307
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:23,680
What's the hat?

308
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,680
Oh the ride?

309
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,680
Yeah.

310
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,680
Just the same thing.

311
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:27,680
Glad you're supporting these mom and pops.

312
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,680
The best ride.

313
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:33,880
Which you, you said it was an oddly light day in the park.

314
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Yes.

315
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Our Uber driver told us it was because of the woke ideology.

316
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:46,400
That people weren't going to Universal.

317
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,400
Which has Harry Potter.

318
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,400
They should love that.

319
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:54,920
Yeah, it's like our Uber driver's like, yeah, there's no one going to any parks anymore

320
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:55,920
because of wokeness.

321
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:03,200
But I got the feeling too that the Uber driver was, she was like, I make off brand Disney

322
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,520
shirts and sell them on Etsy and no one's buying them anymore.

323
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:08,520
And I was like, does she make like bibbidi-bobbidi-wine?

324
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,520
Oh yeah.

325
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,520
Ooh, that stuff.

326
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,520
Like possibly.

327
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,520
Yeah.

328
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:19,520
But anyway, wokeness has made all the parks very, pretty normal, but a little bit empty.

329
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:22,520
But yeah, Universal was empty.

330
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:27,520
I'm trying to winify this with like Jimmy, Jimmy Cavagnon.

331
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,520
Savagnon rather.

332
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,520
I'm not sure.

333
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,520
That's a tough one to do.

334
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:33,840
If anyone thinks of one, shout it out.

335
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,840
Yeah.

336
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,840
Jimmy needs a, Jimmy needs a wine shirt.

337
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:37,840
Yeah.

338
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:42,840
But wait, also, but also the only ride that you waited for was, was this ride.

339
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:46,840
Because they force you to wait and watch a bunch of dumb clips.

340
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:51,840
I was so angry because we just walked onto everything else and then they force you.

341
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,840
Yeah, but you needed the context.

342
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,840
Did I?

343
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,840
Who is this Jimmy Fallon?

344
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:57,840
What does he do?

345
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,840
Tight pants?

346
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,840
What is this?

347
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:05,160
Oh, he just does like a song, but there's no punchline.

348
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,160
Who is Jack Parr?

349
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:10,160
I want to hear more about Jack.

350
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,160
Oh man.

351
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,160
Let's hear, let's take a seat.

352
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,160
We needn't.

353
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,160
All right.

354
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,160
Doot doot doot doot doot.

355
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,160
Sit down music.

356
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,160
Here we go.

357
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:23,160
Well, geez, Eva, you're in Las Vegas with us.

358
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,160
Oh my God.

359
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,160
Such a dream to have you here.

360
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:30,480
We got to ask you just about general, because you're a Vegas aficionado.

361
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,480
There's got to be fond memories from here.

362
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:37,480
What do you, what do you flash to when you think about great Vegas trips of your?

363
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,480
Of your?

364
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,480
I think we went, I think I actually, listening to that MGM episode, I think I went to the

365
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,480
park.

366
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,480
Like, but I don't remember doing anything there.

367
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:50,480
Yeah, when I was a kid, we would come here like every once in a while.

368
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:57,840
My dad and mom actually like performed at the Riviera like before I was born and the

369
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,020
circus circus.

370
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:03,960
So they had like old Vegas stuff they liked, which is all, except for the circus circus,

371
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,120
which is like very well preserved.

372
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,040
It's mostly gone now.

373
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:10,000
We would say the desert in a lot, which is gone.

374
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
But yeah.

375
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Imploded.

376
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
That's an implosion, right?

377
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Probably.

378
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Yeah.

379
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Pretty cool.

380
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,240
If you're a hotel and you didn't get imploded, something's wrong.

381
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,240
Yeah.

382
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,320
Means you didn't make a mark.

383
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:22,320
Yeah.

384
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:24,000
What would be the other option though?

385
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Like brick by brick?

386
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Somebody just hits it with a sledgehammer?

387
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,800
Yeah, like ten guys with sledgehammers.

388
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,800
Space laser.

389
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,800
Get that cooler.

390
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:34,800
That's cool.

391
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,800
That's awesome.

392
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:38,800
They could have all the knights from Excalibur come and like stab it.

393
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:39,800
Oh, awesome.

394
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,800
That's awesome too.

395
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,800
That's like a thousand cuts.

396
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:47,760
I worked on an Extreme Makeover Home Edition episode where a kid liked knights and so they

397
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:51,840
had the Medieval Times knights come and like break their house down.

398
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,840
Really?

399
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:53,840
It really occurred?

400
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:54,840
Yeah.

401
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,840
It was a Medieval Times demolition.

402
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,840
But the thing was like, no, it wasn't the kid liked knights.

403
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:04,760
It was the dad was involved in like a group that was actually kind of a weird religious

404
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:07,640
cult that called themselves knights.

405
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:11,640
So bringing the actual literal knights, I don't think was the point.

406
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,680
They were like, we got to do it.

407
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,960
We booked the knights.

408
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,800
So the knights just showed up and they had swords and they just had maces.

409
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,080
And were they like, they had their color?

410
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,080
Like red knight, blue knight?

411
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,080
Yes.

412
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,080
But that night they were all-

413
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,160
It was in Connecticut somewhere.

414
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,280
That night though they were all unified for one purpose.

415
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,280
To destroy a house.

416
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:35,040
To destroy a little boy's house.

417
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:37,600
They had to keep like pushing the father out of frame.

418
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:41,880
It's like, I got to tell you about real knights, brother.

419
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,240
Wouldn't that be nice at a Medieval Times?

420
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,000
And they're like, you know what?

421
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,040
We're not fighting tonight.

422
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,520
We're all on the same team.

423
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:51,480
And then they just like, I don't know, they could sing or something.

424
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,120
Just sing like campfire songs?

425
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,120
Yeah.

426
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,120
Night songs.

427
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,120
Like fun night songs.

428
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,120
That'd be good.

429
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:01,560
That's like a, yeah, like the Hoop-Dee-Doo review.

430
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,560
Yeah.

431
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,560
Yeah.

432
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,560
Just kind of singing.

433
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,560
Knights have to sing something, right?

434
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:06,560
I would imagine.

435
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,920
There were night songs, of course.

436
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,320
There must have been night songs.

437
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,320
Oh yeah.

438
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,320
Let's turn the source.

439
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,000
I don't know that Old English is like in my wheelhouse.

440
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,600
Yeah, I know, but it's old-timey stuff.

441
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,760
Why do you want to look at him?

442
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:19,960
That's how little we know.

443
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:23,920
We conflate 1920s, ah-da-da-da-da-da-da with the 1400s.

444
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:31,360
You know, the Crusades, you know, the Crusades and the Frawley Sings the Old Ones.

445
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,360
That's all about the same time.

446
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,360
Yeah.

447
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,360
Birth of Jesus.

448
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,360
Basically the same year.

449
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,360
Okay.

450
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:43,080
Something I wanted to wait to ask until you were out here.

451
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:47,720
Did anyone in this audience, was anyone in this audience crazy enough to go to Chris

452
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,720
Angel's restaurant, Ka-Blipp?

453
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:50,720
Wow!

454
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,720
What?

455
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:52,720
Today?

456
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,720
God bless.

457
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,720
How was it?

458
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,720
What?

459
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:56,720
Wow.

460
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57,720
Good reviews.

461
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:00,720
We got a Ka-Blipp shirt right here.

462
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,720
How many Italian ice flavors were there?

463
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:06,720
He didn't check it was breakfast.

464
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,720
It was breakfast.

465
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,720
Ah, didn't check it was breakfast.

466
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:12,080
Did you look in the magic room?

467
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:15,080
You looked in the magic room?

468
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:18,080
Oh, we do have somebody here.

469
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,080
Wait, you have a shirt.

470
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,080
Wow!

471
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,080
Oh, we have a Ka-Blipp shirt in the audience.

472
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,080
Show it off.

473
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,080
Wow!

474
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,080
Oh, it's the definition that ends with the shit.

475
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:28,080
There's a Star Wars crawl on the back of this one.

476
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,080
That's awesome.

477
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:31,080
Yeah, give everyone time to read.

478
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,080
Okay, okay.

479
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,080
You're going to be standing for a while now.

480
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,080
Yeah.

481
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:38,080
Did they put the animatronic back in the magic room?

482
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,440
It's still gone?

483
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,440
And the air conditioning is off.

484
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,440
It's 120 degrees.

485
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,440
What?

486
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,440
Oh, we have Dizon today.

487
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,440
Different reports.

488
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,440
Okay.

489
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,440
Yesterday.

490
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,440
Wait, the whole restaurant, it was off?

491
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,440
Oh, just the magic room.

492
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,440
Oh my God.

493
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:02,440
See, wait, see, if you booked the private special room, your treat is a lack of air

494
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,440
conditioning.

495
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,440
So you couldn't eat Italian ice in there.

496
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,440
It would melt immediately.

497
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:10,800
It would become Italian liquid very quickly.

498
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,800
Are there still the temporary refrigerators behind?

499
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,800
Yes.

500
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,800
Yes?

501
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,800
It's been two and a half years.

502
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,800
This is crazy.

503
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:25,800
This was a solution for, because this restaurant, if you haven't heard all this, I'm talking

504
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:26,800
to my parents.

505
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,800
This is too much to explain.

506
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:28,800
Guys.

507
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:29,800
Wait, there's another Kaboom shirt there.

508
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:30,800
Wow, there's a lot of Kaboom.

509
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:31,800
Please.

510
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,800
Wow, well, we know we're in our element.

511
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:40,160
The magician, Chris Angel, opened a restaurant which was fraught with problems.

512
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:43,160
They ran out of food within the first day.

513
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:48,660
Seems like something you should plan for when opening a restaurant to continue to have enough

514
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:49,660
food.

515
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:52,320
And there was also no way to refrigerate the food.

516
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:58,200
So now the parking lot, which is very small, has to be mostly filled with big exterior

517
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,760
air conditioning units.

518
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:00,760
Refrigerators, yeah.

519
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:01,760
Wow.

520
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,160
So he was storing the meat in the parking lot?

521
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,520
Yes.

522
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,520
Yes.

523
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:09,520
So if somebody wants a hamburger and they don't have meat in the kitchen, somebody has

524
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:14,520
to go out into the parking lot, open up a freezer, and pull a bunch of beef.

525
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,520
Yes.

526
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,520
And it's still going on?

527
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,520
That's bad.

528
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:21,520
And there's a system that worked for us.

529
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:26,520
There's only a few parking spaces, but most of them are reserved for him.

530
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:29,520
How many are reserved for him?

531
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,520
Like more than one, I think.

532
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:34,880
There's one that's very much for him, and then there's like a mural of him being cool

533
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,880
by his parking space.

534
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:37,880
Well, that makes sense.

535
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:42,880
So you just get the feeling that if you were to block it, that that would be an issue.

536
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:47,880
If you had a big tall car and it got in the way of his cool dirt bike painting, he'd

537
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,480
probably be pissed if he came in.

538
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:53,160
When do you guys think the last time he was there was?

539
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:57,760
Like how many months has it been since he visited his own restaurant?

540
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:58,760
That's what they said?

541
00:22:58,760 --> 00:22:59,760
Whoa.

542
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Oh my God.

543
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Wait, live where?

544
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
In the city where it is?

545
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
In Overton?

546
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
He goes?

547
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
He will walk by.

548
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
I wear camel pants sometimes.

549
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
We just revealed that on the Ronnie Adrian episode.

550
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
I'm like, Chris, it's cool.

551
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
You're as cool as Chris Angel.

552
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Yeah.

553
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Well, Chris aren't working if she can see him.

554
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
That's great.

555
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:30,240
He's there like multiple times a week, it sounds like.

556
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,240
Oh, that's a month.

557
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,240
Wow.

558
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,240
That's like 12 times a year.

559
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,240
It's more than I thought.

560
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,240
I thought he had abandoned it.

561
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:44,240
It seemed like, to us, like he has lost interest in this endeavor.

562
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:49,240
So it's really exciting to know that the CA of Ka-Blip is still in Ka-Blip.

563
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:54,240
I do like the arrangement of these like freezer giant temporary freezer things.

564
00:23:54,480 --> 00:24:00,480
It's very much like the school music teacher who gets shunted to like a modular trailer.

565
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,480
And it's like, it was supposed to be for six months, I've been here for three years.

566
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,480
But that's like the all-American burger is in there.

567
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,480
Yeah.

568
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,480
Yeah.

569
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,480
Wow.

570
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,480
Geez.

571
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,480
Okay.

572
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,480
Well, glad to hear that it's thriving.

573
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,480
You're not making time for it.

574
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,480
You've had a note.

575
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,480
You've been to Ka-Blip three times, is that correct?

576
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:20,480
Twice, but I don't think I should do a third one.

577
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,480
It's diminishing returns, I feel like.

578
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:26,720
I've gotten everything I'll ever get in my life from Ka-Blip.

579
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,720
I think so.

580
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:28,720
Yes, magic room.

581
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,720
Not food poisoning.

582
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,720
You survived.

583
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,720
Yeah.

584
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:37,720
And also, we didn't sit at the love table, but it's fine.

585
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:38,720
Okay.

586
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,720
Okay.

587
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,720
Yeah, yeah.

588
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:47,720
Well, so not fitting that in, but we are so glad you came here and made time for us.

589
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:55,460
And especially because there's something that I think Merit's talking about tonight, a premise

590
00:24:55,460 --> 00:25:00,960
that is in the show a lot that I think is especially associated with you.

591
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,960
And that is this premise of guys.

592
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:08,640
This is something that we talk about a lot.

593
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,480
And we text about it a little bit.

594
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,680
We assess who is a guy.

595
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:19,640
Let's explain for my parents or for anybody who doesn't know, the concept of a guy.

596
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:24,640
It's a little bit hard to grasp, I guess, or hard to define what makes a guy.

597
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,640
But do you have a starting point?

598
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:31,640
I have my ideas, but is there any definition to a guy you'd like to provide?

599
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:34,640
Well, I feel like guys aren't...

600
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,640
The important thing is that they're not monsters.

601
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,640
They're not pure monsters.

602
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,640
They have a lot of...

603
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,640
Ambition?

604
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,600
Ambition and power.

605
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,600
There's often a lot of power.

606
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,600
Sometimes not a lot of power.

607
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,600
They're single-minded.

608
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,600
They're maniacs.

609
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:56,600
But there's a whimsical element or something where you can be like, that one's my favorite.

610
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:59,600
Well, you can't do that with a warlord.

611
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,600
Or a genocide guy.

612
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:06,600
If your thing is killing lots of people yearly, you're probably not a guy.

613
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:09,600
But if you're...

614
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,600
You wish.

615
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:20,560
But if your thing is starting some ill-advised restaurant or business or theme park, and

616
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:28,560
you have boundless money and boundless ambition, and you are so driven by your own odd obsessions

617
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:33,560
to never take no for an answer, and if that requires you to have to live in a different

618
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:40,560
reality than the reality that we all have chosen to live in, then so be it.

619
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:46,520
We love and we celebrate these people on the show.

620
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:51,520
I was just going to say, we celebrate the concept of the guy.

621
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:55,520
Much like the Hall of Presidents says they celebrate the concept.

622
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:59,520
And for some reason, when they put the Trump robot in, that's when the change was made.

623
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,520
They stopped saying we celebrate the president.

624
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:04,520
They necessarily endorse specific deeds, but the concept of a guy...

625
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:07,520
The idea, I think, of the president maybe is the particular language.

626
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:15,480
If it wasn't for basically the insane-est of insane rich people who are mildly benevolent,

627
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:20,480
sometimes, if we're lucky, we probably would not have half of the things that we talk about

628
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,480
on the show, and we certainly would not have Las Vegas.

629
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:28,480
This place is teaming with guys, always has been...

630
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:34,480
I think it was set up as a place to house guys, as a safe harbor for guys, for insane

631
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:39,440
maniacs to build things and then tear them down two years later and an insane-er thing

632
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,440
comes up in its place.

633
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:43,440
A sandbox for guys.

634
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,440
A sandbox for guys, yep.

635
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,440
And we're just crawling through it, I guess.

636
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,440
We're just little worms in the sand.

637
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:52,440
We're just a bunch of worms.

638
00:27:52,440 --> 00:28:00,440
But anyway, with that and knowing your fondness for guys, we wanted that to be kind of the

639
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,400
focus of tonight's show.

640
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:08,400
And not just specifically, not just guys in general, but being that we are in a gaming

641
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:14,400
town, I thought that we could have fun tonight and play a little game, a game called Guy

642
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:18,400
Roulette.

643
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:21,400
If you'll excuse me, I am going to now reveal...

644
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,400
It should say Guy Roulette on the screen.

645
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:27,400
Oh yeah, if we could switch over to our screen to look at the Guy Roulette art.

646
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:33,360
But as we do so, let me reveal the Guy Roulette wheel!

647
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,360
Wow!

648
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:39,360
Look at that.

649
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:44,360
So many weirdos on this thing.

650
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:46,360
Our betters!

651
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:48,360
Yes, yeah, yeah.

652
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:51,360
Due to having more money than us, our betters, yes.

653
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,360
Let's take it in.

654
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:56,360
And I'm going to set it up right here.

655
00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:00,320
The wheel of guys, Guy Roulette.

656
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:07,320
And basically what we have here is six guys who are especially associated with Las Vegas.

657
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:10,320
You might recognize some, you might not recognize some.

658
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:16,320
But we're going to learn about all of them, or at least the ones that we land on by spending.

659
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,320
We've also got the Mystery Wedge.

660
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:23,320
We'll see what happens when we land on the Mystery Wedge.

661
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:24,320
Here's the issue though.

662
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:27,280
We're excited to talk about these guys.

663
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:29,280
I was excited to pull the wheel out.

664
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:33,280
But there's one thing that we are no good at, and that's spinning!

665
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:35,280
We don't know how!

666
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:38,280
Our fingers cannot grasp the wheel!

667
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,280
I can't!

668
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,280
It hurt, I tried and it hurt.

669
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:44,280
Yes, we all rehearsed it.

670
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:48,280
All straight to the hospital for hours before this.

671
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:56,240
So if anybody here feels strong-armed enough, strong-willed enough to come up and spin the Guy Roulette wheel.

672
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:59,240
And I'm going to add a caveat to that also.

673
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,240
Just for this first one at least.

674
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:08,240
If anybody who came from two states over, if you traveled from a long way.

675
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,240
Your end went up first, sir, who was also at Kaplip.

676
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,240
I feel like you earned it.

677
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,240
Come on up, sir.

678
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,240
I've done a lot of traveling.

679
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:17,240
And we'll have multiple chances here.

680
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,200
Yes, jump up here.

681
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,200
You can walk over on the side.

682
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,200
Oh boy, thank God.

683
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:26,200
We have some ringer spinners with us here.

684
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,200
That's a great shirt.

685
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,200
You can join me up here.

686
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,200
Oh yes, indeed.

687
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,200
Really good shirt.

688
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,200
What's your name, sir?

689
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,200
Kevin.

690
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,200
Kevin.

691
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,200
Thank you so much.

692
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,200
Oh, and where'd you come in from?

693
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,200
Alaska.

694
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,200
Oh my God!

695
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,200
Geez.

696
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,200
That's far.

697
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,200
Wow.

698
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,200
Oh my God.

699
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,200
That's incredible.

700
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:49,160
You're not just doing this and leaving, right?

701
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,160
I'm going to LA after this.

702
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,160
Oh geez.

703
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,160
Okay, okay.

704
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,160
We'll tour in the co.

705
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:55,160
Okay, so are you rooting for any particular guys?

706
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,160
You may not recognize all the guys.

707
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,160
Does anybody catch your eye?

708
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,160
Any guys catch your eye?

709
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:01,160
Oh, it's going to be fun.

710
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,160
Let's see you win, Liberace.

711
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:05,160
Yes, a couple of previews.

712
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:08,160
But, you know, only chance can tell us where we land.

713
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,160
Go ahead and spin the wheel of guys.

714
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,160
Lady Luck tonight.

715
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:14,160
Will she smile upon us?

716
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:22,120
Or will Lady Luck turn over a card we don't want?

717
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,120
Ooh, okay.

718
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:26,120
This is Vince Cadlubic.

719
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,120
Vince Cadlubic.

720
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:31,120
We will explain who Vince Cadlubic is, but first we're going to say goodbye to you, Kevin.

721
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:38,120
But before you go, please take a parting gift, which is a loose camel cigarette from the

722
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:41,120
silver tray of loose camel cigarettes.

723
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:45,080
Thank you so much for playing.

724
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:48,080
I'll just leave it up here, I suppose.

725
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,080
Please do not smoke inside.

726
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,080
Yes, do not smoke in the venue.

727
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,080
We're having fun, but do not smoke in the venue.

728
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,080
No nuts outside.

729
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,080
They have rules at the Space Las Vegas.

730
00:31:57,080 --> 00:32:00,080
It's the space, not flavor country.

731
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,080
Okay?

732
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:05,080
Eva, this is one that you've brought to the table for us.

733
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:08,080
Would you like to tell us who Vince Cadlubic is?

734
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:12,040
Okay, so Vince Cadlubic, I'll make this fast, is the former CEO of Meow Wolf.

735
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:15,040
We love Meow Wolf, it's great.

736
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:20,040
But Vince Cadlubic had the crazy thing where he was the one who thought of the idea to

737
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:24,040
ask George R.R. Martin, his boss at the movie theater, for $8 million to build a multidimensional

738
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:27,040
house, and he said yes.

739
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:29,040
And then he made Meow Wolf.

740
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,040
His boss at the movie theater?

741
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:31,040
Yeah, he owned a movie theater.

742
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,040
Wow, I didn't know that.

743
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:35,040
At that point, George R.R. Martin had gotten really, really rich, and he owned a lot of

744
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,000
And Vince Cadlubic was like, can I have all this money?

745
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
He was like, sure, I'll write a check.

746
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
So he made Meow Wolf.

747
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:49,000
So this is because in 2018, I saw him give a keynote address at a conference about immersive

748
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
design.

749
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:56,000
And this was basically people talking about how to market your escape room or how to create

750
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:01,000
different sort of interesting theme park and immersive concepts.

751
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
He did the keynote.

752
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:07,960
And it went off the rails wildly, and I have a transcript of some of the stuff he said.

753
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:12,960
So halfway through the thing, he just draws, he shows us this, I'll just describe it.

754
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:18,960
He had a gray circle with a purple circle inside it, and he says the gray circle is

755
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:22,960
reality, and the purple circle is sub-natural reality.

756
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:27,960
And he's like, this is a diagram I created, so that's nature, and that's natural reality,

757
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:28,960
and that's a sub-natural reality.

758
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:32,920
And I'm talking about, that's like streets and buildings, and you have to go to court.

759
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:38,920
And let's say this is like the sub-nature, the alt-nature predominant reality, and so

760
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:41,920
there's red circles that he draws inside.

761
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,920
And that's like Disneyland.

762
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,920
Disneyland's not like court.

763
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,920
Disneyland's different than court.

764
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:50,920
So these are the alternative natures of reality.

765
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:57,920
So basically, this is Disneyland, like that Panasonic thing you did for Southwest Airlines

766
00:33:58,880 --> 00:33:59,880
or whatever.

767
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:03,880
These are all these little tiny realities that exist inside the context of the sub-nature

768
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:04,880
of reality.

769
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,880
And the question is, I guess, is how can we do this?

770
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:11,880
And then he, there's the next slide, and the red has gone slightly inside the purple but

771
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:12,880
outside the gray.

772
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:15,880
And he's like, he kind of points at that.

773
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:18,880
That all attracts to me.

774
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,880
That is what things are like.

775
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,880
He's like, how can we do this?

776
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:27,840
Because if we can do that, then we get to have a new system of those sub-natural laws

777
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,840
and some natural economies.

778
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:34,840
Because right now, like the laws of economy here, not working.

779
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,840
Not working.

780
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:39,840
This is like George Lucas trying to explain what the wills are.

781
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:40,840
Yeah.

782
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:43,840
Like, I'm not sure what you mean, George.

783
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:52,840
So then he spins out into his concept, which is just a kind of like a Bitcoin, but it's

784
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,800
for people who juggle.

785
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,800
Jog coin?

786
00:34:58,800 --> 00:34:59,800
Yeah.

787
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:00,800
He calls it creative coin.

788
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,800
And he's like, and here's my next slide, and it's completely black.

789
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:06,800
He's like, you can't see anything because I'm just going to explain it to you.

790
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:11,800
He's like, you go to the store, you have your phone, you find out this guy's good at juggling,

791
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:12,800
and you give him some creative coin.

792
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:17,800
And that's how, so basically his pitch was that by making Meow Wolf, which we all love,

793
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:21,800
he was going to change the entire world's economy to Meow Wolves.

794
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:23,760
Anyway, two years later.

795
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:29,760
So if you can juggle, you're more likely to become a multimillionaire in creative coin.

796
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:30,760
Were you going to tip?

797
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:34,760
Like if you're going on the street, someone's like a bucket drummer, you could tip them

798
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:35,760
in crypto?

799
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,760
Okay, so I'm in a grocery store and I get notified that there's a bagger, I think it

800
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:42,760
gets like 50 cents an hour to bag groceries, but they have like 75 star ratings on our

801
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,760
system.

802
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,760
So I'm going to go and check them out.

803
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:45,760
So I go to the line, I check them out.

804
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,760
I like flick them a little bit of my creative coin.

805
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:54,720
So he's like, I'm also part of that network starts juggling my apples.

806
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,720
Wait, wait, wait, hold on.

807
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,720
And then he's like, oh, I only have a minute left.

808
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:02,720
And then they, anyways, I said former CEO because like he was out very soon after I

809
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:03,720
saw this thing.

810
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:07,720
But I just found him to be like fun whimsical.

811
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:10,720
And it's just a complete maniac.

812
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:16,720
Yes, not, seemingly not a nefarious person, but just a guy with some very strange ideas.

813
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,680
Redoing the world's economy to make it all meow wolves.

814
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:22,680
A man who doesn't use a period when talking.

815
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:23,680
Yeah.

816
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,680
Just a run out of sentence.

817
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:25,680
Why do we need those?

818
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:26,680
What if we got rid of those?

819
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:31,680
What if the census could go on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on

820
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:32,680
and on?

821
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:36,680
You say former CEO, not part of mail off anymore, maybe advisors or something, but that's not

822
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:37,680
his day to day.

823
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:40,680
And I started wondering what is this guy done since?

824
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:42,680
What has he gone on to do?

825
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:45,680
Because he wanted to focus on other endeavors.

826
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:51,640
And I discovered that the other endeavor that he is now focused on is a supplement that

827
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,640
boosts creativity.

828
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:54,640
What?

829
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,640
Sounds like a real thing.

830
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,640
Sounds non-scammy to me.

831
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:01,640
It is called the imagination pill.

832
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,640
Oh man.

833
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:10,640
What if all it took was just an imagination pill?

834
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,640
We'd all be rich in creative coin.

835
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:15,640
That is what Michael Jackson was taking.

836
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:17,640
Let's be honest.

837
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:19,640
I'm sorry.

838
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:20,640
That's what Conrad Murray was giving us.

839
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,640
That is what Conrad Murray was describing to Michael Jackson.

840
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:26,640
Doctor, more imagination pills please.

841
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:30,640
You can't handle any more, son.

842
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:31,640
You can't.

843
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:36,640
Each bottle is only $60.

844
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:40,640
All you need to do is take five a day.

845
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,640
Well, how many is in the bottle though?

846
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,600
500?

847
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:48,600
It's a month's supply.

848
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,600
So 30 times 5.

849
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,600
So it's the heaviest bottle you've ever felt.

850
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:54,600
150 pills?

851
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:58,600
Do you have the chemical makeup of these pills?

852
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,600
It's fucking vitamin B and ginseng.

853
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,600
It's everything that's in all the scam pills.

854
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:04,600
It's sub-reality.

855
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:10,600
It's the thing that's called something called mean pills on Alex Jones and it's called

856
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:13,600
lovely pills on Gwyneth Paltrow's group.

857
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:18,560
And then it's imagination pills for B vitamins basically.

858
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:21,560
And good boy pills coming soon to our store.

859
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,560
They're under your chairs right now.

860
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,560
We have browbee tea public too.

861
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:32,560
Well, they just added tie-dye t-shirts and now they're doing supplements.

862
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,560
Yeah, tea public should do supplements.

863
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:37,560
That's true.

864
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,560
I think we're ready for the next guy.

865
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:41,560
Let's see some...

866
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:43,520
Somebody else who came from a long ways away.

867
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,520
Your hand right there is first.

868
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,520
Blue shirt, come on up.

869
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:53,520
While she comes up, can I say that the imagination powder on the web...

870
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,520
The power of the imagination.

871
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,520
Not powder.

872
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:00,520
There's quotes about the power of imagination.

873
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:04,520
One that is attributed to Albert F. Einstein.

874
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:08,520
And then the other...

875
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:10,520
Does it say F?

876
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:15,480
I'm so creative I spelled a swear word with asterisks.

877
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:17,480
And then there's another one.

878
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:20,480
I take the imagination pill on a daily basis and it keeps me motivated.

879
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:24,480
Quote attributed to Vince Cadlubic, founder and director of Meowl.

880
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,480
So his own quote.

881
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:27,480
Hello, welcome.

882
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,480
Thanks for making it out.

883
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,480
Oh my God, what a shirt.

884
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,480
Eisner Wells, 1984.

885
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:34,480
Nice.

886
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,480
For Eisner and Wells.

887
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,480
Thanks for coming.

888
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:38,480
What's your name?

889
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,480
Where did you come from?

890
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:42,440
Wow, that's far.

891
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:43,440
Incredible.

892
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,440
Geez.

893
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:46,440
I'm so honored you traveled for that.

894
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:48,440
What else are you doing while you're in town?

895
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:50,440
We got in yesterday and we leave tomorrow.

896
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:52,440
Oh wow.

897
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:55,440
The pure pit, the purest of pure.

898
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,440
Only for us.

899
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:58,440
Well, I hope we're going to give you some fun here.

900
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:04,440
It's going to help that you get to do a little special turn on the wheel of guys.

901
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:06,440
Go ahead and give it a spin.

902
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,440
Okay.

903
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,440
This is exciting.

904
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,400
There really should be, the guys should be talking.

905
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:15,400
Like each one should have their own little sound bite.

906
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,400
Next time we do the wheel of guys we'll do that.

907
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:20,400
Ooh, this is Zach Bagans.

908
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,400
Zach Bagans.

909
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,400
Ooh, we got a cheer for Zach Bagans.

910
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,400
So we'll get into the Zach Bagans stuff.

911
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,400
Melissa, thanks for coming in from Little Rock.

912
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,400
Go ahead and take Lucy there.

913
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:30,400
Thanks.

914
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,400
A hand for Melissa.

915
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,400
Thank you.

916
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,400
Thank you so much for coming in.

917
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,400
Thank you, Melissa.

918
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,400
Incredible.

919
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:41,360
Okay, this is another Eva special.

920
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:46,360
But it seems like some people are aware of this guy and maybe have done his Las Vegas

921
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:49,360
attraction, Zach Bagans Haunted Museum.

922
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,360
Yes.

923
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:51,360
Some fans.

924
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:52,360
Sure, yes.

925
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:53,360
Good idea.

926
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:55,360
I'm going to have to learn some stuff.

927
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,360
They're not going to go to a haunted museum.

928
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,360
Well, yes.

929
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,360
These two.

930
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:02,360
Oh, I'm a coward.

931
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:09,320
Yeah, well, look, there was already, because when we were here last year and we went to

932
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:14,320
Kblip together, the whole group then went to Zach Bagans Haunted Museum.

933
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:15,320
And a couple of things happened.

934
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:20,320
I was looking at a waiver that was the scariest waiver with the scariest fonts in a waiver

935
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:22,320
I've ever seen.

936
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:25,320
So some of it was being cowardly, yes.

937
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:30,320
But also, we'd just done our New York show and I was like, hmm, thing that says that

938
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:34,280
they're not responsible if I die or a nap.

939
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:36,280
Ooh, perhaps the nap.

940
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:37,280
Thinking like Jason.

941
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,280
I put my Jason cap on.

942
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:43,280
I don't regret my choice, but I'm going to have to catch up about Zach Bagans if we do

943
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,280
it.

944
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:47,280
What can you tell us about Zach and the Haunted Museum?

945
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:50,280
Okay, he's a travel show host.

946
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:53,280
He bought one of the Manson houses.

947
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:59,280
He bought the house in Vegas and says it's haunted because according to the tour, it

948
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:02,240
scared Tracy Lord's brother.

949
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:05,240
But not Tracy Lord.

950
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:06,240
She's unshakable.

951
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:12,240
She got a lot of scary texts from her brother who, yeah, you get to read the text between

952
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:15,240
her and her brother as part of the museum.

953
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:17,240
Ooh, texts about something scary.

954
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:18,240
Nice.

955
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:22,240
I just have a very specific thing about Zach Bagans I want to share.

956
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:27,240
When I went on this tour, about an hour into the tour, they took us into a room where they

957
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:31,200
had a part of the engine of the car that killed James Dean.

958
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:34,960
And the car was called the Little Bastard.

959
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:39,120
And they were going to reveal the Little Bastard.

960
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:43,800
And before they did, they showed us a documentary of clips of people talking about how dangerous

961
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:44,800
this car was.

962
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:45,800
It was cursed.

963
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:48,800
Everyone who rode in it, even after it killed James Dean, was hurt in some way.

964
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:53,800
Anyway, one of the talking heads in that documentary was my maternal grandfather, Bill Pollack.

965
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:54,800
What?

966
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:58,520
He passed away a few years ago, but he was a race car driver.

967
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:01,240
And he was like, yes, this car was definitely haunted.

968
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:02,240
And then he vanished.

969
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:03,240
And I was...

970
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:06,360
Did you know that clip was coming?

971
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:08,800
I'd never seen that clip before, and I did not know that clip was coming.

972
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:13,240
And I was also like with a bunch of like friends of ours who didn't know that was my grandfather.

973
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:15,560
So I just quietly went, that's my grandfather.

974
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:20,000
And then he was gone.

975
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:28,000
So after I got home, I emailed, and I was like, hey, your museum amazingly has this

976
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,880
clip of my deceased grandfather that I've never seen before.

977
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:32,880
Can you let me know?

978
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:35,360
We'd love to have it, like know where it's from.

979
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:38,640
And they emailed me back, Eva, I'm not sure who created that video.

980
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:44,240
Zach just had it done.

981
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:46,640
And then I sent a follow-up email going, okay.

982
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:48,400
And they just never responded after that.

983
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:54,000
So he's holding a family member of mine kind of hostage in the haunted museum.

984
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
You're just one of my trinkets now.

985
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,960
He might have access to like a longer form interview then.

986
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:00,960
That's why I was asking.

987
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,960
I feel like I'd love it, but they were just like, no.

988
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:04,960
So anyway, Zach's making...

989
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:07,600
Isn't some footage cut out of longer footage?

990
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:08,600
Not in this case.

991
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:09,600
Don't ask that question.

992
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:13,520
Also him saying like the car was haunted, it seems like he might have been like, I won't

993
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:14,760
say the car was haunted.

994
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:15,760
I'm a reasonable man.

995
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:16,760
We got it.

996
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:17,760
We got it.

997
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:21,880
We'll cut around him saying it's not haunted.

998
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:24,120
With editing, we can make anything work.

999
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:25,120
Wow.

1000
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:26,120
That's weird.

1001
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:27,120
Incredible.

1002
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:32,240
There's crazy stuff in that museum, Dr. Kevorkian's death van.

1003
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:36,880
They play the music that he composed that people would listen to as they died in the

1004
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:37,880
van.

1005
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:39,880
I know, he made his own music.

1006
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:42,520
It's like pan flute music.

1007
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:44,520
It's like...

1008
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:47,680
Dr. Kevorkian played the pan flute?

1009
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:49,600
He made music.

1010
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:50,600
He was like Peter Pan?

1011
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:52,920
The Kevorkian music is on YouTube, guys.

1012
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:53,920
Look it up.

1013
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:54,920
I don't know anything about that.

1014
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:57,920
It makes me think a lot of weird thoughts about Kevorkian you've never thought before.

1015
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:58,920
Wow.

1016
00:44:58,920 --> 00:44:59,920
Wow.

1017
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:00,920
Is it good?

1018
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:01,920
Do you like?

1019
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:02,920
Is it better than that McGruff album?

1020
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:03,920
Are you going to make a Kevorkian album?

1021
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:04,920
Like a tribute album?

1022
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:07,920
Maybe I do a couple of Kevorkian songs.

1023
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:08,920
I don't know.

1024
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:12,040
Mike the musical chameleon.

1025
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:14,840
One day he's McGruff, one day he's Jack Kevorkian.

1026
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:16,640
Hey Mike, just checking in.

1027
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:17,640
How's your Kevorkian album?

1028
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:18,640
I'm working on it!

1029
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:19,640
Don't question me!

1030
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:20,640
I didn't mean anything by that.

1031
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:21,640
I'm sorry!

1032
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:22,640
I know what you meant.

1033
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:29,640
You keep asking me questions like that, maybe I'll have you sit in a van for a little while,

1034
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:30,640
huh?

1035
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:32,640
Oh, he's threatening me with a van again.

1036
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:35,640
Gosh, I'm learning a lot tonight.

1037
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:38,640
That's Zach Baggins, I think.

1038
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:41,640
Let's see, who else would be excited to come up and spin the wheel?

1039
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:43,640
We got a hand right there, sir.

1040
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:44,640
Come on up.

1041
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:46,640
To the left it seems like.

1042
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:49,640
Does anybody live South America?

1043
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:51,640
Did anybody come from South America?

1044
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:52,640
South America.

1045
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:53,640
Antarctica?

1046
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:54,640
Antarctica?

1047
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:57,640
Were you on a space shuttle until this show happened?

1048
00:45:57,640 --> 00:46:00,640
Does anyone have a parallel dimension?

1049
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:01,640
Does anyone?

1050
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:04,640
I'd have to give that person two cigarettes.

1051
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:08,640
Yeah, if you worked space time to get here.

1052
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:10,640
Hello sir, welcome!

1053
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:12,640
Oh my god, excellent shirt, lost island theme park.

1054
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:13,640
Is that a real place?

1055
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:17,640
Yes, it's a theme park in Iowa, it goes way harder than it needs to.

1056
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:23,640
There's like 20 walk around face characters, and there were maybe 50 people in the park, it's insane.

1057
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:26,640
Oh, that's like a perfect scenario for us.

1058
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:32,640
Eva, we texted about this once because you're like, I'm going to be near there later in the fall.

1059
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:36,640
What do you think? Should I go? Do you think it's worth it?

1060
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:40,640
And I said, Eva, it closes for the season this weekend.

1061
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:41,640
Oh yeah.

1062
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:43,640
Sounds good.

1063
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:46,640
Seems like we should coordinate, seems like we should try to do it.

1064
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:47,640
What's your name, where are you from?

1065
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:49,640
Dick, I drove here from New York.

1066
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:51,640
Oh my god!

1067
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:55,640
This is nuts, the degree that people are, and drove.

1068
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:59,640
Oh my gosh, and car made it, everything's good.

1069
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:02,640
Great, excellent. What else are you doing in your town?

1070
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:04,640
I was hoping to pick up some loosies.

1071
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:06,640
Oh yes, hey, well perfect.

1072
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:07,640
Hell yeah.

1073
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:08,640
You're in the right spots.

1074
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:10,640
Hell yeah, brother.

1075
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:15,640
And luckily there's no way to not get them, except maybe if you knock the wheel over.

1076
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:19,640
There's no wrong answer on the wheel, but let's go ahead and give it a spin.

1077
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:20,640
Let's see where we land.

1078
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:24,640
Oh boy. Clickety clack, clickety clack.

1079
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:29,640
People really like your spin, I think.

1080
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:32,640
People especially like your spin. It's a long one.

1081
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:36,640
And click, and James Dolan.

1082
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:37,640
James Dolan.

1083
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:41,640
You picked the one we've been dying to have.

1084
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:44,640
Boy, fantastic, fantastic spin.

1085
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:45,640
You know what, you might as well.

1086
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:47,640
Go for two, do two if you want to.

1087
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:49,640
Do two if you want to.

1088
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:51,640
Be careful stepping down.

1089
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:53,640
So great to meet you.

1090
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:59,640
And thank you for getting to the one we've been really waiting to get into.

1091
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:04,640
Do we know who James Dolan is and why we're talking about him tonight?

1092
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:05,640
Sphere!

1093
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:06,640
Sphere!

1094
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:07,640
Sphere!

1095
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:11,640
Sphere! Sphere! Sphere! Sphere! Sphere! Sphere! Sphere!

1096
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:13,640
Oh yes.

1097
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:18,640
He is the man behind, we are all so sphere amped right now.

1098
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:29,640
He's the man behind the Sphere, which if you don't know, it is the new gigantic, insane venue, concert venue that is coming to Las Vegas.

1099
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:33,640
I was here last night, Scott. Can you, you asked me what I was up to last night because Scott wasn't here.

1100
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:35,640
What did I tell you I was going to do?

1101
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:43,640
Drive around, find a White Castle, and look at the Sphere.

1102
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:45,640
And that's what I fucking did.

1103
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:47,640
Wow.

1104
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:50,640
Yeah.

1105
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:57,640
You had texted us like within the last few weeks, I'm Sphere-pilled.

1106
00:48:57,640 --> 00:48:59,640
I am, I'm Sphere-pilled. I know everything about it.

1107
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:06,640
Mike is Sphere-pilled, and especially now that he's seen it, if you don't know, Mom and Dad, this is, you're like a building.

1108
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:09,640
What could be so cool about a building? I've seen buildings before.

1109
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:15,640
This has projections on the outside of it that are so bonkers.

1110
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:23,640
And it sounded bonkers before it got built, and now what we've seen is so much more bonkers than we could have imagined.

1111
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:26,640
What was it like in person? What was it like? I haven't driven by it yet.

1112
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:32,640
It was overwhelming. I didn't get to, I wanted to see the big eye, but it didn't turn into the big eye.

1113
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:39,640
It's a lot of abstract designs and kind of just like crazy trippy graphics and light shows.

1114
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:41,640
Screensavers shit.

1115
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:47,640
Yeah, yeah. The world's biggest screensaver. It makes it, I like when it is a big basketball.

1116
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:49,640
The big basketball is awesome.

1117
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:50,640
That might be my favorite.

1118
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:51,640
Yeah.

1119
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:57,640
I think I'm going to weigh in and say that I don't like when it's a big eye.

1120
00:49:57,640 --> 00:50:04,640
I'm weirded out by the big eye. The entire building becomes just like the brightest screen you've ever seen in your life.

1121
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:06,640
Should we have a picture?

1122
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:09,640
Oh, yeah. Do we have it? Yeah, yeah. Oh, yes. Wait.

1123
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:12,640
This is the eye.

1124
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:15,640
And the context for this, Jason, you talked about this in an episode.

1125
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:19,640
I really direct this to my dad because you're looking at the Wynn Golf Club.

1126
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:26,640
As somebody pointed out on Twitter, one of the most expensive publicly accessible golf courses in America,

1127
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:30,640
you pay north of $600 for one round at this place.

1128
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:41,640
And now your view is the side of the biggest human eyeball in human history.

1129
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:47,640
I hear that we call a value added proposition.

1130
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:50,640
I like the eye.

1131
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:53,640
OK. And I think it's because of how big it is.

1132
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:56,640
If it was smaller, I would say the eye is gross.

1133
00:50:56,640 --> 00:51:04,640
But the sheer size of the eye, I have to like it.

1134
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:07,640
Me? Yes, I do. I'm not saying one does.

1135
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:10,640
I do have to enjoy the eye.

1136
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:13,640
Who enjoys the eye?

1137
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:18,640
It's not universal.

1138
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:21,640
So maybe I'm in a minority here, but that's OK.

1139
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:24,640
Who doesn't like the eye?

1140
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:31,640
Wow. Are you booing the eye?

1141
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:33,640
He's booing the eye.

1142
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:36,640
I'm going to stand up and show you my problem.

1143
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:38,640
If we're in the front, OK.

1144
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:41,640
If we're in the back, neutral, it's just skin.

1145
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:45,640
I don't know how I feel about just seeing a big block of skin.

1146
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:48,640
But it's not so bad. It just looks like a tan design.

1147
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:50,640
I don't know.

1148
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:54,640
What if the hair is creepy?

1149
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:56,640
Where's the eyebrow?

1150
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:58,640
I don't know. It's been shaved, I think.

1151
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:00,640
In space, I guess.

1152
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:02,640
You see hints of hair above, I think.

1153
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:05,640
It's like stubble eyebrow.

1154
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:09,640
My problem is Squishy Town right here.

1155
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:11,640
It's just too big.

1156
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:20,640
That's bigger than a five-story building right there that is just pure eye squish.

1157
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:22,640
It weirds me out.

1158
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:26,640
Here's what would make it better if it cried a little bit.

1159
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:30,640
You want to see the big eye cry?

1160
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:36,640
I would like it even more than I already do if it would cry once every hour.

1161
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:40,640
And water would pool under the big eye.

1162
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:42,640
You want to swim in the eye crying?

1163
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:45,640
You want to dance in the fountain of tears?

1164
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:49,640
OK, we have to all agree that we would love to swim in the big eye's tears.

1165
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:53,640
You want it to be like God crying at man's folly.

1166
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:57,640
At the hubris of what has thou done?

1167
00:52:57,640 --> 00:53:03,640
If what you're saying is that I worship the spheres of my personal God, you are correct.

1168
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:07,640
Does the sphere eye have a stigmatism?

1169
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:09,640
It can if you program it.

1170
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:10,640
Oh, OK.

1171
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:12,640
That's one of the options. Yeah, yeah.

1172
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:14,640
No, they can flip that on and off.

1173
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:18,640
I mean, that'd be at the direction, I think, of James Dolan, ultimately.

1174
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:28,640
And so James Dolan, the guy who this might be the biggest guy in Las Vegas currently in America currently.

1175
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:38,640
James Dolan, if you don't know, a man with humble beginnings, he became CEO of the company Cablevision.

1176
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:44,640
He worked his way all the way up from being just the lowly son of the owner.

1177
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:49,640
And somehow managed to climb to the top of the Cablevision ladder.

1178
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:52,640
So that's early HBO is what they are.

1179
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:54,640
So it's original HBO money.

1180
00:53:54,640 --> 00:54:05,640
And now he owns Madison Square Garden, which means he's responsible for the Knicks and the Islanders and Radio City Music Hall.

1181
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:12,640
The Rockettes. He's the guy who made the Rockettes perform at Trump's inauguration.

1182
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:19,640
And there was something where they said like, he said, like, we got to listen to everybody right now.

1183
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:23,640
And a Rockette said, you're asking us to tolerate intolerance?

1184
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:27,640
And he was like, yeah, pretty much.

1185
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:30,640
Yes, that sounds right.

1186
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:38,640
He also runs AMC right now, which you might know as being one of the only cable entities without a good streaming plan.

1187
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:41,640
There's no idea what they're doing.

1188
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:54,640
They they recently fired 20 percent of their employees, massive layoffs AMC, partially, I think, because the sphere costs a lot of money.

1189
00:54:54,640 --> 00:55:00,640
He has been routing money from all these other businesses into the sphere.

1190
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:02,640
So the point. Oh, good.

1191
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:04,640
I was like Disneyland Paris. Yeah.

1192
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:09,640
Yeah. We we lost all the great stuff at Disneyland because of the money problems of Disneyland Paris.

1193
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:13,640
Oh, but except the opposite, because it's all going to build the greatest thing that ever.

1194
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:16,640
Yes, but it's good this time. Yeah.

1195
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:23,640
It's Disneyland Paris, but I don't care if I don't care if the Knicks suck as long as I get to see the fucking baby album front to back.

1196
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:27,640
Would you give up like a Walking Dead spin off for the tears?

1197
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:31,640
Yes, they could never make a show again.

1198
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:33,640
Who needs shows? I don't care.

1199
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:36,640
We need more spheres.

1200
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:42,640
Of course, we in Burbank, we have a half sphere where the little sphere.

1201
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:43,640
Yeah, yes.

1202
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:48,640
Where they're they're, you know, testing the technology and filming stuff.

1203
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:50,640
I drive by it. I go to that post office.

1204
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:55,640
I go to that Del Taco and I drive by and I know magic is happening in there.

1205
00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:58,640
Just let Mike in, let Mike into the little sphere.

1206
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:03,640
We drove by at five thirty this morning to get to the airport and magic was happening.

1207
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:06,640
Double sphere day. Yeah. Yeah.

1208
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:09,640
It's beautiful. So you're going Mike.

1209
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:12,640
You're going to you'll be back here in October to see you too.

1210
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:17,640
That's right. And we'll you know, we'll cover all of your sphere exploits.

1211
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:20,640
Yes, sphere month I'll call it.

1212
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:27,640
But any different aspects. Take a seat Halloween.

1213
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:30,640
Yeah, by the way, no one cast the fright this year.

1214
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:35,640
Our no Haunted Mansion episode pushed to next year.

1215
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:39,640
Irrelevant. Who needs it? We have spheres now.

1216
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:44,640
You leave your family. It's not that I have a sphere in my mansion.

1217
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:49,640
It's big. I it's called big. I it's just about the big I outside.

1218
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:52,640
Hey, come on. It's the year of the going man and the going dog.

1219
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:56,640
Come on. Oh, for the Haunted Mansion.

1220
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:59,640
I don't know if we'll get there, honestly.

1221
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:02,640
That might be pushing it. That's the next thing that we get.

1222
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:05,640
But we might have to do when we're on that decline.

1223
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:09,640
The decline is going to be it's going to take up a lot of time to talk about it because there's a lot of stuff.

1224
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:13,640
You're going back. Yeah. There's a lot of stuff that we need to talk about.

1225
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:18,640
But I didn't see the trees. See, to me, that part of the ride is five seconds long.

1226
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:23,640
But I guess you change your perspective on the ride in that moment.

1227
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:26,640
You don't know when you're looking back. Yeah. Oh, yeah.

1228
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:28,640
Oh, yeah. That's going to take a lot of time. Yeah.

1229
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:34,640
Because you got to talk about looking back and then and then when it ends and then you're not looking back anymore, especially we all start taking these imagination pills.

1230
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:37,640
It's really got to make us think.

1231
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:42,640
Give me enough imagination pills. Yeah. I'll do the incline episode for five hours.

1232
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:47,640
The in on a homecast of right Haunted Mansion, the incline episode.

1233
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:51,640
That's what it is. But you're you're excited about the sphere.

1234
00:57:51,640 --> 00:58:01,640
And if I think I was to I think I was to but the more that I've learned about the owner, James Dolan, the more that I'm just doubting his ability to pull this off.

1235
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:05,640
First of all, incredible financial problems with this thing.

1236
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:13,640
He's had to split things off into different companies like now it's here's MSG over here and now here's fear entertainment.

1237
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:19,640
He's just being smart with his money. This is what business people do who are smarter than all of us.

1238
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:22,640
Come on.

1239
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:31,640
He I would say that his track record running the Knicks has been spotty.

1240
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:46,640
Besides the questionable quality of the team in his time running it, there has also been a lot of things like using facial recognition to kick people out of Madison Square Garden.

1241
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:51,640
Who said bad things about him? Yeah, let's talk about this for a second.

1242
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:58,640
There is he is famous for kicking people out for the slightest bit of teasing.

1243
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:10,640
Like there's footage online of him like walking, you know, on the court, like exiting and someone goes, so the team like that's it.

1244
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:13,640
And he goes, what did you say?

1245
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:20,640
So the team and he goes, OK, Justin, Justin, get him out of Justin, get him out of here.

1246
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:30,640
And he like kicked him out because I feel like if you own a professional sports team, you hear, sell the team all the time.

1247
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:32,640
I feel like that's part of the arrangement.

1248
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:39,640
He also kicked out a fan for wearing a shirt that said Bandolin in a Knicks logo.

1249
00:59:39,640 --> 00:59:41,640
Fun. Are you OK?

1250
00:59:41,640 --> 00:59:43,640
Hold on. Yeah. Yeah.

1251
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:51,640
By doing this segment of this podcast, am I going to be banned from the sphere?

1252
00:59:51,640 --> 00:59:55,640
Because let's cut the live stream right now.

1253
00:59:55,640 --> 00:59:57,640
I can't.

1254
00:59:57,640 --> 00:59:59,640
This is my question.

1255
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:05,640
If someone walks around that area with a shirt that says, get the sphere out of here, are they like a dead man?

1256
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:14,640
Like if they if he hears what you're saying, I'm not going to get to see Bono in a little devil's outfit saying ultraviolet light my way.

1257
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:17,640
I need to see that with a big screen.

1258
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:19,640
We're going to cut this is not going to.

1259
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:21,640
This is going to be the only time you hear this.

1260
01:00:21,640 --> 01:00:24,640
I'm cutting this out of the broadcast going out live right now.

1261
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:27,640
He's got vocal recognition software.

1262
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:28,640
He's already heard it.

1263
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:30,640
He can hear when anyone talks about him.

1264
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:37,640
Oh, I'm going to walk up to this fear and the eyes going to close on me.

1265
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:40,640
It was sharp.

1266
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:49,640
I didn't even get to see the original Darren Aronofsky movie they're making for the sphere.

1267
01:00:49,640 --> 01:00:50,640
This sucks.

1268
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:52,640
It costs fifty dollars to go to.

1269
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:54,640
This is also part of the question is like you.

1270
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:56,640
OK, you two plays incredible start.

1271
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:57,640
Then what?

1272
01:00:57,640 --> 01:01:11,640
They haven't said one thing and it has to be a band that can has the money to make a bunch of fucking movies that are in like 19,000 K whatever resolution it takes for videos broadcastable at the sphere.

1273
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:14,640
Yeah, I so I don't know.

1274
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:15,640
So yeah, you're done.

1275
01:01:15,640 --> 01:01:17,640
You're not going episode canceled.

1276
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:20,640
Halloween's back on.

1277
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:37,640
When people heard that he was using facial recognition to kick people out of the garden, the state liquor authority said, hey, you know, if somewhere that serves liquor needs to be able to serve everyone, you can't just remove people that you don't like.

1278
01:01:37,640 --> 01:01:40,640
So we're going to look into revoking your liquor license.

1279
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:43,640
No more liquor at Madison Square Garden.

1280
01:01:43,640 --> 01:01:46,640
He was asked about this on live television.

1281
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:47,640
He said, that's fine.

1282
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:51,640
I don't like to drink anyway.

1283
01:01:51,640 --> 01:01:58,640
You don't you because you don't you're how much money does that place make every single game.

1284
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:00,640
A lot, a lot, but I think he's right.

1285
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:03,640
Yeah.

1286
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:08,640
But there's a moral victory wherever my camera is.

1287
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:11,640
I got your back, buddy.

1288
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:12,640
Right there.

1289
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:13,640
I think there's a camera right there.

1290
01:02:13,640 --> 01:02:14,640
Got you.

1291
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:19,640
Michael Carlson says you're right.

1292
01:02:19,640 --> 01:02:23,640
I'm going to keep putting you to the test on what you're going to sign off on and support James on.

1293
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:24,640
I'm ready.

1294
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:30,640
Because then what happened is the well, you know, that that threat of saying, hey, go ahead, take it away.

1295
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:34,640
That didn't successfully get the liquor authority off his tail.

1296
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:36,640
So he tailed the liquor authority.

1297
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:41,640
He had a private investigator follow somebody from the liquor authority home.

1298
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:42,640
Yeah, good.

1299
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:43,640
Good.

1300
01:02:43,640 --> 01:02:44,640
Yeah.

1301
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:48,640
Got to keep an eye out, I guess.

1302
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:49,640
Good.

1303
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:50,640
Good.

1304
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:51,640
Yeah.

1305
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:55,640
Once the once the guy was found, the private investigator, he had a knife.

1306
01:02:55,640 --> 01:02:56,640
He did have a knife.

1307
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:59,640
He sent a man on a knife to follow a liquor man around.

1308
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:00,640
OK.

1309
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:01,640
Yeah.

1310
01:03:01,640 --> 01:03:02,640
People have knives.

1311
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:04,640
It might not have been for that.

1312
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:07,640
He maybe just had, you know, yeah, I was there.

1313
01:03:07,640 --> 01:03:08,640
Cut up some chicken later.

1314
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:10,640
I wasn't there.

1315
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:17,640
So anyways, but I'd say that the biggest thing I'm going to throw at you that you're going to have to support now, I guess.

1316
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:18,640
OK.

1317
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:21,640
Is James Dolan's music.

1318
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:26,640
You're looking for a band to play the sphere.

1319
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:28,640
I think you found it.

1320
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:29,640
We got one in house.

1321
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:31,640
We don't even need to hire anybody.

1322
01:03:31,640 --> 01:03:37,640
Look, it's just about getting through Bono in the edge so we can get to the real shit.

1323
01:03:37,640 --> 01:03:39,640
James Dolan's band, J.D.

1324
01:03:39,640 --> 01:03:42,640
and the Straight Shot.

1325
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:54,640
I feel like Jason, I think you might have mentioned this band before and I foolishly did not go look into this immediately because as soon as you do, I mean, we were texting about this.

1326
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:59,640
But they're basically they're kind of like a sort of country fried roots rock band.

1327
01:03:59,640 --> 01:04:01,640
They made seven albums.

1328
01:04:01,640 --> 01:04:06,640
So yeah, they're like I would say authentic is the word.

1329
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:08,640
I would I would describe.

1330
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:11,640
Yeah, you know, and well, it's clear.

1331
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:13,640
Let's get a taste of their music.

1332
01:04:13,640 --> 01:04:16,640
We have a clip right here.

1333
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:17,640
Let's see.

1334
01:04:17,640 --> 01:04:18,640
Yeah.

1335
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:19,640
The live track.

1336
01:04:19,640 --> 01:04:19,640


1337
01:04:19,640 --> 01:04:21,640
This is the song Redemption Train.

1338
01:04:21,640 --> 01:04:22,640
Oh, yeah.

1339
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:23,640
Oh, yeah.

1340
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:25,640
Oh, man.

1341
01:04:25,640 --> 01:04:28,640
Can barely see.

1342
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:31,640
Pain and confusion weighing down on me.

1343
01:04:31,640 --> 01:04:36,640
One step ahead to step behind.

1344
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:37,640
I do my best.

1345
01:04:37,640 --> 01:04:39,640
No peace can I find now.

1346
01:04:39,640 --> 01:04:41,640
I'm praying for salvation.

1347
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:43,640
I'm praying for salvation.

1348
01:04:43,640 --> 01:04:44,640
Me.

1349
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:45,640
For more time.

1350
01:04:45,640 --> 01:04:46,640
Me.

1351
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:47,640
For more time.

1352
01:04:47,640 --> 01:04:49,640
And praying for forgiveness.

1353
01:04:49,640 --> 01:04:51,640
Praying for forgiveness.

1354
01:04:51,640 --> 01:04:52,640
Redemption train.

1355
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:55,640
Don't be carrying me home.

1356
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:57,640
Yeah.

1357
01:04:57,640 --> 01:04:58,640
Yeah.

1358
01:04:58,640 --> 01:04:59,640
Give it up.

1359
01:04:59,640 --> 01:05:00,640
Give it up.

1360
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:02,640
Straight shot fans.

1361
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:06,640
I think the mix was a little off.

1362
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:07,640
It just wasn't.

1363
01:05:07,640 --> 01:05:08,640
Yeah.

1364
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:10,640
Somebody behind the scenes made a couple errors.

1365
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:17,640
Did you like James Dillon's choice of staring at the lyrics on the ground?

1366
01:05:17,640 --> 01:05:19,640
I was trying to figure out what his eye line was.

1367
01:05:19,640 --> 01:05:20,640
Yeah.

1368
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:22,640
Jason's got his lyrics right here.

1369
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:23,640
So that's OK.

1370
01:05:23,640 --> 01:05:24,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1371
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:25,640
No, I guess I do too.

1372
01:05:25,640 --> 01:05:26,640
I guess he's one of us.

1373
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:27,640
Yeah.

1374
01:05:27,640 --> 01:05:30,640
Well, I do have redemption song right here.

1375
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:31,640
Go ahead.

1376
01:05:31,640 --> 01:05:32,640
Praying for salvation.

1377
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:33,640
We were talking about a song.

1378
01:05:33,640 --> 01:05:34,640
He did a song that was kind of a like.

1379
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:35,640
Like you better pray.

1380
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:36,640
You better find you a church.

1381
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:37,640
We have found a church.

1382
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:38,640
Better find it.

1383
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:41,640
He also did kind of like a both sides anthem.

1384
01:05:41,640 --> 01:05:42,640
The anthem we know.

1385
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:43,640
We know.

1386
01:05:43,640 --> 01:05:44,640
We know.

1387
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:45,640
We know.

1388
01:05:45,640 --> 01:05:46,640
We know.

1389
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:47,640
We know.

1390
01:05:47,640 --> 01:05:48,640
We know.

1391
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:49,640
We know.

1392
01:05:49,640 --> 01:05:50,640
We know.

1393
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:53,640
The anthem we need right now.

1394
01:05:53,640 --> 01:05:57,640
Like why can't we all just say everybody's fuzzily feuding.

1395
01:05:57,640 --> 01:05:58,640
No more protests, please.

1396
01:05:58,640 --> 01:05:59,640
Of any kind.

1397
01:05:59,640 --> 01:06:00,640
They're all the same.

1398
01:06:00,640 --> 01:06:02,640
Just stop doing them all.

1399
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:06,640
But I'd say the most notable.

1400
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:08,640
Well, I mean, look, this guy does.

1401
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:10,640
He does songs for the for the working man.

1402
01:06:10,640 --> 01:06:11,640
Just maybe I don't.

1403
01:06:11,640 --> 01:06:16,640
Yeah, I don't get it because I'm like, you know, I'm not out there on the on the rails.

1404
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:19,640
Yeah, you're not working with my hands.

1405
01:06:19,640 --> 01:06:22,640
You're a Madison Avenue liberal.

1406
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:26,640
That's what I would always say about Scott.

1407
01:06:29,640 --> 01:06:30,640
That's the way.

1408
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:31,640
Yeah.

1409
01:06:31,640 --> 01:06:35,640
James and I are more kind of guys from, you know, salt to the earth.

1410
01:06:35,640 --> 01:06:36,640
Absolutely.

1411
01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:41,640
Well, that's the kind of stuff he writes about is just, you know, is like, you know,

1412
01:06:41,640 --> 01:06:46,640
working hard, working up a sweat and trying to keep warm under a fire.

1413
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:51,640
And, you know, what in heck fire does a feller do when there's many,

1414
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:57,640
many sexual assault allegations against against one of your best friends,

1415
01:06:57,640 --> 01:07:00,640
Harvey Weinstein?

1416
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:04,640
Credit to our pal Brad Evans for discovering this song and alerting me to it.

1417
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:06,640
Can you please play the next song?

1418
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:10,640
This is his take on his buddy Harvey Weinstein.

1419
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:17,640
We were friends, friends, talked for hours without it.

1420
01:07:17,640 --> 01:07:22,640
About his latest story, how to deal with fame and glory.

1421
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:28,640
All the girls who adored him, catered to his every wish.

1422
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:30,640
Nothing he could lose.

1423
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:33,640
All he need to do was chew.

1424
01:07:33,640 --> 01:07:35,640
I should have known.

1425
01:07:35,640 --> 01:07:36,640
I should have known.

1426
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:40,640
I should have thrown myself across his tracks.

1427
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:43,640
Stopped him from these violent attacks.

1428
01:07:43,640 --> 01:07:45,640
I should have known.

1429
01:07:45,640 --> 01:07:50,640
We believed and didn't see through the lies he told us all.

1430
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:53,640
That led him to his endless fall.

1431
01:07:53,640 --> 01:07:55,640
I should have known.

1432
01:07:55,640 --> 01:07:59,640
I should have known.

1433
01:07:59,640 --> 01:08:00,640
I hope that's it.

1434
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:03,640
I really hope that's it.

1435
01:08:03,640 --> 01:08:07,640
Like, a perspective no one can relate to.

1436
01:08:07,640 --> 01:08:15,640
That you didn't stop your super successful friend from sexually assaulting thousands of women.

1437
01:08:15,640 --> 01:08:21,640
Look, we talked for many hours, but then I would get out of there before the girls arrived.

1438
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:25,640
Honestly, I didn't even know what his dating deal was.

1439
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:31,640
I've known him for 30 years, but we only had small talk in those times.

1440
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:35,640
Mostly business stuff. Hollywood things and whatnot.

1441
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:41,640
Personal affairs off the table. I honestly didn't care.

1442
01:08:41,640 --> 01:08:46,640
I'm excited to project this lyric video on the sphere.

1443
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:56,640
Oh my god.

1444
01:08:57,640 --> 01:09:03,640
I was really excited to force an audience to see that.

1445
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:08,640
Once it's in your brain, it's stuck in there.

1446
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:11,640
I'm just glad he weighed in.

1447
01:09:11,640 --> 01:09:14,640
Because he had to.

1448
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:18,640
What did he stolen got to say about this? When's he going to make a statement?

1449
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:21,640
By the way, was this made on iMovie 2007?

1450
01:09:21,640 --> 01:09:25,640
What is this lyrics video? Is this a fan film?

1451
01:09:25,640 --> 01:09:28,640
Did I make this? No, I didn't make this.

1452
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:32,640
He went through and asked 100 editors to make cool lyric videos.

1453
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:35,640
And they all said, absolutely not.

1454
01:09:35,640 --> 01:09:42,640
Also funny, because several months before he put out this song, he was sued by seven women.

1455
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:46,640
And the grounds of the lawsuit was that he knew.

1456
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:48,640
That he did know.

1457
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:50,640
Scott, did you hear the song though?

1458
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:52,640
He didn't know.

1459
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:53,640
He should have.

1460
01:09:53,640 --> 01:09:56,640
He would have thrown himself on the tracks if he did.

1461
01:09:56,640 --> 01:09:58,640
He didn't know. He said it in a song.

1462
01:09:58,640 --> 01:10:04,640
And across his tracks, would have gone to his house, jumped on the ground and hoped he tripped.

1463
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:08,640
No one's ever lied in a song.

1464
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:11,640
It's impossible. It's a pure expression.

1465
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:17,640
Well, so I have my sphere concerns, I would say.

1466
01:10:17,640 --> 01:10:22,640
But I don't know. Maybe JD can get down to business making rights.

1467
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:24,640
See, I don't know.

1468
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:27,640
There's many options for what happens with the sphere.

1469
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:33,640
It fails. It fails after two years. It fails after three years.

1470
01:10:33,640 --> 01:10:36,640
It could last, we don't know. We just don't know.

1471
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:37,640
Four years.

1472
01:10:37,640 --> 01:10:39,640
It could be four.

1473
01:10:39,640 --> 01:10:40,640
We don't know.

1474
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:43,640
Let me throw one out. Four and a half.

1475
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:45,640
It could be four and a half. Just spitballing.

1476
01:10:45,640 --> 01:10:47,640
Real quick before we move on.

1477
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:50,640
What would be your dream show in the sphere?

1478
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:52,640
And I'm being sincere at this point.

1479
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:54,640
No funny stuff for me.

1480
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:57,640
What is a musical act? What is a sports show?

1481
01:10:57,640 --> 01:11:00,640
What is a surf show that you would want?

1482
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:01,640
A sports show.

1483
01:11:01,640 --> 01:11:03,640
Yeah, well, I'd say a sports show.

1484
01:11:03,640 --> 01:11:07,640
I say sports show because the only sport I like is professional wrestling, which is a show.

1485
01:11:07,640 --> 01:11:11,640
Which WWE is supposedly talking to them about doing an event there.

1486
01:11:11,640 --> 01:11:14,640
Well, that could be good. That's good.

1487
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:17,640
I mean, I think it's just so big.

1488
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:22,640
Let's get the Knicks in there, but let's put them on wires too.

1489
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:37,640
They've got to fly up 300 feet in the air and the projections, they have to hit a hoop 300 feet in the air with just like nightmarish seizure causing projections spinning around and around.

1490
01:11:37,640 --> 01:11:40,640
What they put Spider in in Avatar Way of Water.

1491
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:42,640
They have to play in those.

1492
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:46,640
Can you play if you can't play in a giant spider machine?

1493
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:51,640
Right now in Las Vegas, there's a three day slam ball event happening.

1494
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:54,640
Of course, we all know.

1495
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:59,640
And we all know I know the owner of slam ball, which is true.

1496
01:11:59,640 --> 01:12:01,640
Oh, here he goes.

1497
01:12:01,640 --> 01:12:04,640
Well, on a future Las Vegas episode, I bring it up as well.

1498
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:08,640
I should have known the owner of slam ball instead of R.B. Weinstein.

1499
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:11,640
What you're talking about is more extreme though than slam ball.

1500
01:12:11,640 --> 01:12:15,640
They get they get air on slam ball, which is trampoline basketball.

1501
01:12:15,640 --> 01:12:18,640
But what you're talking about is like, what would you even call it?

1502
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:19,640
Wireball?

1503
01:12:19,640 --> 01:12:20,640
Spiderball.

1504
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:21,640
Spiderball.

1505
01:12:21,640 --> 01:12:22,640
Wow.

1506
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:23,640
That's cool.

1507
01:12:23,640 --> 01:12:24,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1508
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:26,640
They're on wires that are like webs.

1509
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:32,640
And it's like, of course, the famous spider machine, a reference everybody understood when I said it and understand again.

1510
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:33,640
That's great.

1511
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:36,640
Eva, how many more references can I make to the spider machine?

1512
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:38,640
Eva, what would you want to see in the sphere?

1513
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:40,640
If you could race through New York.

1514
01:12:45,640 --> 01:12:46,640
It's already filmed. You can just do it.

1515
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:47,640
Yeah. Good point.

1516
01:12:47,640 --> 01:12:48,640
Yeah.

1517
01:12:49,640 --> 01:12:51,640
Probably some night music.

1518
01:12:51,640 --> 01:12:53,640
Some medieval night music.

1519
01:12:53,640 --> 01:12:54,640
Night music.

1520
01:12:54,640 --> 01:12:55,640
Yeah.

1521
01:12:55,640 --> 01:12:57,640
I thought you meant the Sondheim musical.

1522
01:12:57,640 --> 01:12:58,640
Yeah.

1523
01:12:58,640 --> 01:12:59,640
Well, that's a good choice.

1524
01:12:59,640 --> 01:13:01,640
Sondheim at the sphere.

1525
01:13:01,640 --> 01:13:03,640
Seven the Clowns.

1526
01:13:03,640 --> 01:13:08,640
I'm just hung up on like even if the sphere like crashes and burns.

1527
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:09,640
Literally.

1528
01:13:09,640 --> 01:13:15,640
He's got this musical talent that, you know, he did so much.

1529
01:13:15,640 --> 01:13:20,640
He sold his soul to the devil at the crossroads to get this musical talent.

1530
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:23,640
So you're not answering my question?

1531
01:13:23,640 --> 01:13:27,640
There's like a laser show at Dollywood right now.

1532
01:13:27,640 --> 01:13:32,640
I think that would be really good in the giant sphere.

1533
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:33,640
Right.

1534
01:13:33,640 --> 01:13:35,640
But lasers might be too powerful in the sphere.

1535
01:13:35,640 --> 01:13:38,640
They bounce around like a billion times.

1536
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:40,640
Start hitting people in the eye.

1537
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:41,640
Be careful.

1538
01:13:41,640 --> 01:13:43,640
So it's going to, so they're like,

1539
01:13:43,640 --> 01:13:47,640
Dolan will like get really morose about what he's done.

1540
01:13:47,640 --> 01:13:51,640
The power that he's just going to be looking like Sillian Murphy and Oppenheimer.

1541
01:13:51,640 --> 01:13:53,640
Like, oh no, what have I done?

1542
01:13:53,640 --> 01:13:56,640
There will be a Christopher Nolan movie about the sphere eventually.

1543
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:57,640
I hope so.

1544
01:13:57,640 --> 01:13:58,640
Uh huh.

1545
01:13:58,640 --> 01:13:59,640
Uh huh.

1546
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:00,640
Okay.

1547
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:03,640
Now this is the point where we should have somebody up to spin,

1548
01:14:03,640 --> 01:14:09,640
but I think we might have to, you know, put our hand on the scales,

1549
01:14:09,640 --> 01:14:10,640
tip the scales a little bit.

1550
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:16,640
I think I don't want too much time to pass before we go to the mystery wedge.

1551
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:22,640
I click it over to the mystery wedge because I just really wanted to pump things up

1552
01:14:22,640 --> 01:14:28,640
to build the mystery and the anticipation for somebody who we could not be in Las Vegas

1553
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:29,640
and not talk about.

1554
01:14:29,640 --> 01:14:32,640
And that is the great David Copperfield.

1555
01:14:35,640 --> 01:14:38,640
I mean, we're so excited.

1556
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:40,640
We got to talk about, there he is.

1557
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:41,640
There's the man.

1558
01:14:41,640 --> 01:14:43,640
I mean, okay.

1559
01:14:43,640 --> 01:14:44,640
So that's a question.

1560
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:47,640
How many people while you're in town are seeing the David Copperfield show

1561
01:14:47,640 --> 01:14:49,640
or have already done it?

1562
01:14:49,640 --> 01:14:51,640
Oh my God.

1563
01:14:51,640 --> 01:14:53,640
I mean, a perfect doubleheader with us.

1564
01:14:53,640 --> 01:14:57,640
It's a show that we are obviously very passionate about.

1565
01:14:57,640 --> 01:15:00,640
All four of us have seen it and enjoyed it very much.

1566
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:03,640
And for the uninitiated, for mom and dad,

1567
01:15:03,640 --> 01:15:07,640
you think that you're getting a David Copperfield magic show,

1568
01:15:07,640 --> 01:15:12,640
but there is a turn that happens where suddenly there is an incredible

1569
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:15,640
extraterrestrial surprise.

1570
01:15:15,640 --> 01:15:20,640
And it's just one of the finest pieces of theater that you can see anywhere in the world.

1571
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:22,640
And you got to see it here.

1572
01:15:22,640 --> 01:15:29,640
And I think it resonates probably with us, especially kind of for personal reasons.

1573
01:15:29,640 --> 01:15:31,640
Could I get that lighting cue, please?

1574
01:15:31,640 --> 01:15:37,640
You know, Mike, Jason and I, we never knew our fathers.

1575
01:15:37,640 --> 01:15:44,640
They were military men, all stationed on the same base, in fact.

1576
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:47,640
And that's why we all know each other.

1577
01:15:47,640 --> 01:15:50,640
We all are all our dads who work together on a military base.

1578
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:53,640
I don't know why I started getting a lot of echo here.

1579
01:15:53,640 --> 01:15:56,640
It's kind of cool. It kind of sets the stage.

1580
01:15:56,640 --> 01:16:04,640
Our fathers all work together in a special place, a mysterious place called Roswell.

1581
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:07,640
And we never got to know our fathers very well.

1582
01:16:07,640 --> 01:16:09,640
We never got to tell them that we loved them.

1583
01:16:09,640 --> 01:16:14,640
We were all busy pursuing our dream of being the biggest podcasters in the world,

1584
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:17,640
a dream that we obviously achieved.

1585
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:23,640
But in all that, yes, the biggest. Yes, indeed.

1586
01:16:23,640 --> 01:16:27,640
But we never got to tell our fathers that we loved them, and it's a regret that we live with all the time.

1587
01:16:27,640 --> 01:16:31,640
However, our fathers did send us a special box.

1588
01:16:31,640 --> 01:16:33,640
Can we reveal the box?

1589
01:16:33,640 --> 01:16:35,640
Wow, look at that.

1590
01:16:37,640 --> 01:16:42,640
And so that's, this is all we have to remember our fathers by.

1591
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:44,640
The trouble is we opened it. We opened it earlier today.

1592
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:48,640
And if you turn to the other side, nothing inside, nothing inside the box.

1593
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:54,640
It was then that we opened another thing that our fathers sent us from the past.

1594
01:16:54,640 --> 01:17:00,640
That was a letter, a letter that explained that something from the past could appear in the box

1595
01:17:00,640 --> 01:17:05,640
as long as everybody that we're doing it in front of looks to the back of the room right now.

1596
01:17:05,640 --> 01:17:07,640
Look over there. Look over there really fast.

1597
01:17:07,640 --> 01:17:09,640
Keep looking. Keep looking.

1598
01:17:09,640 --> 01:17:12,640
Where's my art already? Okay, okay. Okay, I need to look back now.

1599
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:17,640
Wow, wait a minute. I think that there may be something now in the box.

1600
01:17:17,640 --> 01:17:20,640
My God. Okay, let's see.

1601
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:23,640
Well, Mike, do you have a handle on it? Oh my.

1602
01:17:23,640 --> 01:17:25,640
What's in the box? Look in the box.

1603
01:17:25,640 --> 01:17:27,640
What's in the box?

1604
01:17:27,640 --> 01:17:29,640
What's in the box?

1605
01:17:29,640 --> 01:17:31,640
Wow. Oh.

1606
01:17:33,640 --> 01:17:36,640
Who is this? Oh.

1607
01:17:36,640 --> 01:17:43,640
Mike, wow. Mike, you okay? Did you hurt your back or something?

1608
01:17:43,640 --> 01:17:47,640
Yeah, I just hurt my back for a second. I'm just going to lean over for a while.

1609
01:17:47,640 --> 01:17:50,640
Okay, sure. Oh, no, sounds good. Whatever makes you comfortable. Oh my God.

1610
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:55,640
Oh, hey. Oh, it's good to be here.

1611
01:17:55,640 --> 01:17:58,640
Wow. How about a hand? How about a hand for our little friend?

1612
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:03,640
Who is this? What's your name, sir?

1613
01:18:03,640 --> 01:18:06,640
My name is Blue32.

1614
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:08,640
Wow. Wow. Yeah.

1615
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:13,640
You're the, wait, so the same one then? The same one from the Copperfield show?

1616
01:18:13,640 --> 01:18:17,640
Yeah, I'm the same one, but I also knew your dads.

1617
01:18:17,640 --> 01:18:19,640
Wow. Wow. Yeah.

1618
01:18:19,640 --> 01:18:23,640
You know, so many dads across the 21st century entertainment spectrum.

1619
01:18:23,640 --> 01:18:28,640
Dads love me. Dads are big fans of mine.

1620
01:18:29,640 --> 01:18:34,640
Oh, I mean, why dads specifically? Is it just something you have in common with a dad sensibility?

1621
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:37,640
I'm a guys guy. What can I say?

1622
01:18:37,640 --> 01:18:45,640
Uh-huh. Despite being an alien, you're a guys guy in the way that an earthling would be a guys guy?

1623
01:18:45,640 --> 01:18:50,640
Yeah, I like to kick back and enjoy a cold root beer.

1624
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:52,640
Oh, wow. Yeah, correct. Cold one.

1625
01:18:52,640 --> 01:18:56,640
Yeah. You know what? I can actually, I can smell that a little bit right now.

1626
01:18:56,640 --> 01:19:02,640
Yeah, I farted. That's part of the real show in case you didn't know.

1627
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:11,640
Wow. Wow. Geez. Well, I mean, you're here with us tonight now, I guess.

1628
01:19:11,640 --> 01:19:18,640
Are you okay to be on Earth? Are you just going to be the fourth co-host now? What's the deal?

1629
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:26,640
Yeah, I'm here. Yeah, I'm cool to be on Earth. I love Earth. I'm here to spread a very simple message.

1630
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:29,640
Oh, what is it?

1631
01:19:29,640 --> 01:19:36,640
Love, Jason. Love could... Thank you.

1632
01:19:39,640 --> 01:19:47,640
Love could fix all the problems on Earth if you'd only listen. But you didn't.

1633
01:19:48,640 --> 01:19:50,640
You shunned me.

1634
01:19:50,640 --> 01:19:52,640
Wait, who didn't though? What do you mean?

1635
01:19:52,640 --> 01:19:55,640
You made fun of me. Scott, I'm talking.

1636
01:19:55,640 --> 01:19:59,640
Okay. You shunned me. You made fun of me.

1637
01:19:59,640 --> 01:20:01,640
We shunned you? Yeah.

1638
01:20:01,640 --> 01:20:07,640
Who shunned you? Everyone. And now because of that, I'm dying.

1639
01:20:07,640 --> 01:20:09,640
You're dying? Yeah.

1640
01:20:09,640 --> 01:20:14,640
I mean, look, I want to focus on that. I guess I should focus on that part of it and not...

1641
01:20:14,640 --> 01:20:17,640
But you're saying they shunned you? I think they just met you.

1642
01:20:17,640 --> 01:20:20,640
Every one of them. The one from Arkansas.

1643
01:20:20,640 --> 01:20:21,640
Oh, no!

1644
01:20:21,640 --> 01:20:26,640
The one from Alaska. The New York guy that was driving in a car.

1645
01:20:26,640 --> 01:20:31,640
Minutes ago, you said you were fine. And now you're dying.

1646
01:20:31,640 --> 01:20:37,640
The dying thing happened in real time. I realized in the moment I was dying.

1647
01:20:37,640 --> 01:20:39,640
You just started feeling it?

1648
01:20:39,640 --> 01:20:43,640
Yeah. You know when you feel like you're dying.

1649
01:20:43,640 --> 01:20:48,640
That's what I felt. Because you let me down, Jason.

1650
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:50,640
How did... What did I do?

1651
01:20:50,640 --> 01:20:55,640
Your dad treated me so well when we were stationed together at Area 51.

1652
01:20:55,640 --> 01:20:56,640
In Roswell?

1653
01:20:56,640 --> 01:20:58,640
At Roswell, yeah.

1654
01:20:58,640 --> 01:20:59,640
Okay.

1655
01:20:59,640 --> 01:21:02,640
We used to sing the old ones together.

1656
01:21:02,640 --> 01:21:04,640
Oh, like William Frawley.

1657
01:21:04,640 --> 01:21:07,640
Yeah. He was stationed there too.

1658
01:21:07,640 --> 01:21:12,640
You're the one... You taught him the songs that Jason holds so dear?

1659
01:21:12,640 --> 01:21:17,640
I taught Jason's dad how to sing the old ones.

1660
01:21:17,640 --> 01:21:20,640
You taught my dad good night ladies?

1661
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:22,640
We sang good night ladies, yeah. And he said,

1662
01:21:22,640 --> 01:21:26,640
Oh, one day I'm gonna have a son that's not gonna let you down.

1663
01:21:26,640 --> 01:21:33,640
And he was wrong.

1664
01:21:33,640 --> 01:21:37,640
Well, I'm sorry. I'm trying my best.

1665
01:21:37,640 --> 01:21:40,640
Yeah, that's what they all say.

1666
01:21:40,640 --> 01:21:42,640
I have a time stone, you guys.

1667
01:21:42,640 --> 01:21:43,640
You do?

1668
01:21:43,640 --> 01:21:44,640
Yeah.

1669
01:21:44,640 --> 01:21:47,640
Okay. Oh, okay. A time stone. That seems significant.

1670
01:21:47,640 --> 01:21:50,640
Oh, yeah. Thanks, Wade. He really is dying.

1671
01:21:50,640 --> 01:21:53,640
That's the first thing that got your eyes start flopping over.

1672
01:21:53,640 --> 01:21:56,640
And then you go, Oh, wow.

1673
01:21:56,640 --> 01:21:59,640
I'm just trying to show everyone what's going on.

1674
01:21:59,640 --> 01:22:00,640
Yeah.

1675
01:22:00,640 --> 01:22:02,640
My eyes are flopping over.

1676
01:22:02,640 --> 01:22:05,640
How realistic does this look up close? It's incredible.

1677
01:22:05,640 --> 01:22:09,640
It's like you're at the sphere.

1678
01:22:09,640 --> 01:22:12,640
What do you think of this sphere?

1679
01:22:12,640 --> 01:22:17,640
I think James Dolan's a great guy.

1680
01:22:17,640 --> 01:22:18,640
You too, huh?

1681
01:22:18,640 --> 01:22:23,640
The only man on earth who showed me love was James Dolan.

1682
01:22:23,640 --> 01:22:25,640
He wrote a song about me.

1683
01:22:25,640 --> 01:22:26,640
About you?

1684
01:22:26,640 --> 01:22:27,640
Yeah.

1685
01:22:27,640 --> 01:22:28,640
What did you do?

1686
01:22:28,640 --> 01:22:32,640
It's called the Time Stone Blues.

1687
01:22:32,640 --> 01:22:35,640
Do you want to sing us any of the Time Stone Blues?

1688
01:22:35,640 --> 01:22:38,640
I got the blues.

1689
01:22:38,640 --> 01:22:41,640
The Time Stone Blues.

1690
01:22:41,640 --> 01:22:43,640
And that's mostly the lyrics.

1691
01:22:43,640 --> 01:22:44,640
Yeah.

1692
01:22:44,640 --> 01:22:46,640
Sounds like the other Dolan songs.

1693
01:22:46,640 --> 01:22:51,640
What is the significance of the time stone for us here tonight?

1694
01:22:51,640 --> 01:22:53,640
Do we need to be worried about it?

1695
01:22:53,640 --> 01:22:54,640
Yes.

1696
01:22:54,640 --> 01:22:56,640
You need to be worried, Scott.

1697
01:22:56,640 --> 01:23:00,640
The time stone is something that I use to come back in time.

1698
01:23:00,640 --> 01:23:04,640
I'm from a different planet, but I also came back in time.

1699
01:23:04,640 --> 01:23:06,640
Yes, both at the same time.

1700
01:23:06,640 --> 01:23:09,640
Time travel and interplanetary travel.

1701
01:23:09,640 --> 01:23:14,640
This makes as much sense as the David Copperfield show thus far.

1702
01:23:14,640 --> 01:23:16,640
Yes, consistent with.

1703
01:23:16,640 --> 01:23:20,640
So you're running out of time and you're dying.

1704
01:23:20,640 --> 01:23:24,640
So is it then about do we need to save your life now

1705
01:23:24,640 --> 01:23:28,640
or get you back to a time where you'll be safe?

1706
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:31,640
Can you just give us any instructions about how we can help you?

1707
01:23:31,640 --> 01:23:32,640
Yes.

1708
01:23:32,640 --> 01:23:34,640
To all of that?

1709
01:23:34,640 --> 01:23:35,640
Yes, to all of it.

1710
01:23:35,640 --> 01:23:36,640
Okay, okay.

1711
01:23:36,640 --> 01:23:38,640
I'm trying to keep it straight in my head.

1712
01:23:38,640 --> 01:23:40,640
This is like a Vince Cadlubic lecture.

1713
01:23:40,640 --> 01:23:46,640
Okay, so we are, we need to both, we need to get you back to your planet.

1714
01:23:46,640 --> 01:23:49,640
And we need to find a way to make you not die here tonight.

1715
01:23:49,640 --> 01:23:54,640
And most importantly, everyone here needs to make the symbol

1716
01:23:54,640 --> 01:24:01,640
and accept that love is the element that is missing from the Earth.

1717
01:24:01,640 --> 01:24:02,640
Okay.

1718
01:24:02,640 --> 01:24:05,640
Remember the symbol from the show?

1719
01:24:05,640 --> 01:24:06,640
Yes, kind of.

1720
01:24:06,640 --> 01:24:07,640
Somebody's making it out there.

1721
01:24:07,640 --> 01:24:09,640
The people who've seen it recently.

1722
01:24:09,640 --> 01:24:11,640
Let's all learn from him in the audience.

1723
01:24:11,640 --> 01:24:12,640
How does it work?

1724
01:24:12,640 --> 01:24:14,640
Okay, yes, you put your fingers together.

1725
01:24:14,640 --> 01:24:16,640
You put them together and it's okay, okay.

1726
01:24:16,640 --> 01:24:17,640
So everybody.

1727
01:24:17,640 --> 01:24:21,640
Diamond Dallas Page's diamond cutter symbol if you know professional wrestling.

1728
01:24:21,640 --> 01:24:22,640
It's pretty, yes.

1729
01:24:22,640 --> 01:24:25,640
Throw up your Illuminati signs.

1730
01:24:25,640 --> 01:24:26,640
This is incredible.

1731
01:24:26,640 --> 01:24:28,640
Everyone's doing it except for Jason.

1732
01:24:28,640 --> 01:24:31,640
Jason, who is letting me down again.

1733
01:24:31,640 --> 01:24:33,640
I just have a mic.

1734
01:24:33,640 --> 01:24:35,640
Okay, fine.

1735
01:24:35,640 --> 01:24:37,640
I wasn't doing it because I had to take a picture

1736
01:24:37,640 --> 01:24:39,640
because I've never felt more like a cult leader.

1737
01:24:39,640 --> 01:24:47,640
The podcaster ride is a lot like a cult if you think about it.

1738
01:24:47,640 --> 01:24:50,640
So now, okay, everyone has to love up.

1739
01:24:50,640 --> 01:24:51,640
Wow, yeah, okay, love up.

1740
01:24:51,640 --> 01:24:54,640
Okay, okay, so that's given you some energy.

1741
01:24:54,640 --> 01:24:57,640
Okay, oh wait, am I dying?

1742
01:24:57,640 --> 01:25:01,640
Oh, you chose Jason's lap to die in.

1743
01:25:01,640 --> 01:25:03,640
Oh, wait.

1744
01:25:03,640 --> 01:25:07,640
Oh, but they, I feel a difference.

1745
01:25:07,640 --> 01:25:09,640
The symbols from the audience.

1746
01:25:09,640 --> 01:25:10,640
Hey, Blue, really quick.

1747
01:25:10,640 --> 01:25:13,640
Do they need to keep doing it or can they put their hands down?

1748
01:25:13,640 --> 01:25:15,640
They need to keep doing it.

1749
01:25:15,640 --> 01:25:16,640
Hands up, hands up.

1750
01:25:16,640 --> 01:25:17,640
Okay, okay.

1751
01:25:17,640 --> 01:25:21,640
And they need to for another five to 10 minutes.

1752
01:25:21,640 --> 01:25:22,640
Okay.

1753
01:25:23,640 --> 01:25:27,640
And Jason needs to sing Pretty Baby while this happens.

1754
01:25:27,640 --> 01:25:30,640
Okay, okay, yeah, Jason's got a serenade.

1755
01:25:30,640 --> 01:25:32,640
And then I'll be saved and everything will be okay.

1756
01:25:32,640 --> 01:25:34,640
I don't know Pretty Baby.

1757
01:25:34,640 --> 01:25:35,640
Just sing the part.

1758
01:25:35,640 --> 01:25:38,640
Just make up a song that sounds like it could be Pretty Baby.

1759
01:25:38,640 --> 01:25:39,640
I don't think he knows either.

1760
01:25:39,640 --> 01:25:41,640
Pretty Baby.

1761
01:25:41,640 --> 01:25:44,640
Oh, yeah, oh, I'm re-energized.

1762
01:25:44,640 --> 01:25:46,640
Wow, wow.

1763
01:25:46,640 --> 01:25:48,640
Yay, thank you.

1764
01:25:48,640 --> 01:25:51,640
I have to get back now to see Lucy.

1765
01:25:51,640 --> 01:25:52,640
Lucy?

1766
01:25:52,640 --> 01:25:53,640
Lucy.

1767
01:25:53,640 --> 01:25:54,640
What's Lucy?

1768
01:25:54,640 --> 01:25:57,640
She's my sister, but I'm also married to her.

1769
01:25:57,640 --> 01:25:59,640
Oh.

1770
01:25:59,640 --> 01:26:05,640
Blue, is that something that's common on your planet or is that weird there too?

1771
01:26:05,640 --> 01:26:07,640
It's weird there too.

1772
01:26:07,640 --> 01:26:08,640
It's weird there too.

1773
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:09,640
Okay, okay.

1774
01:26:09,640 --> 01:26:10,640
Do we bid goodbye to you for now?

1775
01:26:10,640 --> 01:26:11,640
Yeah, bye.

1776
01:26:11,640 --> 01:26:12,640
Wow, wow.

1777
01:26:12,640 --> 01:26:13,640
Bye.

1778
01:26:13,640 --> 01:26:16,640
Blue, 30, so his head fell off.

1779
01:26:16,640 --> 01:26:17,640
Oh, wow.

1780
01:26:17,640 --> 01:26:19,640
Oh, no, wait a minute.

1781
01:26:19,640 --> 01:26:20,640
He's just Shrek.

1782
01:26:20,640 --> 01:26:21,640
He was a Shrek.

1783
01:26:21,640 --> 01:26:22,640
Shrek.

1784
01:26:22,640 --> 01:26:23,640
Shrek.

1785
01:26:23,640 --> 01:26:24,640
Shrek.

1786
01:26:24,640 --> 01:26:27,640
This MF said Shrek.

1787
01:26:27,640 --> 01:26:29,640
Stitch is not Shrek.

1788
01:26:29,640 --> 01:26:31,640
Stitch is not Shrek.

1789
01:26:31,640 --> 01:26:34,640
Ohana means family, Scott.

1790
01:26:34,640 --> 01:26:36,640
There's only one way for me to learn.

1791
01:26:36,640 --> 01:26:40,640
Will the entire audience please say to me, Stitch is not Shrek.

1792
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:42,640
Stitch is not Shrek.

1793
01:26:42,640 --> 01:26:43,640
All right.

1794
01:26:43,640 --> 01:26:44,640
Thank you.

1795
01:26:44,640 --> 01:26:45,640
I think I got it.

1796
01:26:45,640 --> 01:26:46,640
I think I got it.

1797
01:26:46,640 --> 01:26:51,640
Will you allow me to smoke every one of those cigarettes as your penance.

1798
01:26:51,640 --> 01:26:52,640
Until you learn, yeah.

1799
01:26:52,640 --> 01:26:53,640
Until you learn.

1800
01:26:53,640 --> 01:26:55,640
You are allowed.

1801
01:26:55,640 --> 01:27:00,640
If I smoke enough of these and take enough imagination pills, I think I'll be able to

1802
01:27:00,640 --> 01:27:01,640
keep them straight.

1803
01:27:01,640 --> 01:27:02,640
Wow.

1804
01:27:02,640 --> 01:27:03,640
How about a hand for Blue?

1805
01:27:03,640 --> 01:27:04,640
Oh, my gosh.

1806
01:27:04,640 --> 01:27:05,640
Wow.

1807
01:27:05,640 --> 01:27:09,640
Great to see him, yeah.

1808
01:27:09,640 --> 01:27:13,640
I want to make sure that we, again, Tt might have to like put our hands on the scale and

1809
01:27:13,640 --> 01:27:18,640
make sure that we get a little bit of one that I know is very important to everybody

1810
01:27:18,640 --> 01:27:19,640
here.

1811
01:27:19,640 --> 01:27:20,640
Tick, tick.

1812
01:27:20,640 --> 01:27:21,640
Liberace.

1813
01:27:21,640 --> 01:27:22,640
Liberace.

1814
01:27:22,640 --> 01:27:23,640
Yeah.

1815
01:27:23,640 --> 01:27:25,640
I want to make sure we have our Liberace time.

1816
01:27:25,640 --> 01:27:27,640
Now, let me say this.

1817
01:27:27,640 --> 01:27:29,640
I don't think Liberace is a guy.

1818
01:27:29,640 --> 01:27:33,640
I don't think that's the correct classification.

1819
01:27:33,640 --> 01:27:41,640
But Liberace has guys around now keeping up the legacy.

1820
01:27:42,640 --> 01:27:44,640
Yeah, he unlocks guys.

1821
01:27:44,640 --> 01:27:45,640
Okay, so real quick.

1822
01:27:45,640 --> 01:27:47,640
Leads to sub guys, yes.

1823
01:27:47,640 --> 01:27:52,640
I've talked about this on a previous podcast, but several years ago, I came to Las Vegas.

1824
01:27:52,640 --> 01:27:58,640
I signed up for a tour that I saw in Las Vegas Magazine where you could do a tour of Liberace's

1825
01:27:58,640 --> 01:28:02,640
collection inside Michael Jackson's basement.

1826
01:28:02,640 --> 01:28:07,640
It was called the Thrilla Villa, and it was like the Liberace Foundation had set up this

1827
01:28:07,640 --> 01:28:08,640
thing.

1828
01:28:08,640 --> 01:28:12,640
They picked you up, took you to the house that Michael Jackson fled to after the allegations,

1829
01:28:12,640 --> 01:28:15,640
which he liked because it was full of tunnels.

1830
01:28:15,640 --> 01:28:19,640
It was a house where you could just travel through tunnels, and the tunnels were full

1831
01:28:19,640 --> 01:28:21,640
of Liberace's clothes.

1832
01:28:21,640 --> 01:28:28,640
So the guy showed us all the collection, and then he took us to a room and brought out

1833
01:28:28,640 --> 01:28:31,640
some sushi from Ralph's and champagne.

1834
01:28:31,640 --> 01:28:35,640
It was like 11 o'clock in the morning, and he's like, what do you guys want to talk about?

1835
01:28:35,640 --> 01:28:37,640
His name was Jonathan Warren.

1836
01:28:37,640 --> 01:28:38,640
We've got a picture of him.

1837
01:28:38,640 --> 01:28:39,640
Let's see.

1838
01:28:39,640 --> 01:28:40,640
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1839
01:28:40,640 --> 01:28:41,640
Yes.

1840
01:28:41,640 --> 01:28:42,640
Let's learn about our modern Liberace guys.

1841
01:28:42,640 --> 01:28:43,640
Is this guy?

1842
01:28:43,640 --> 01:28:44,640
This guy.

1843
01:28:44,640 --> 01:28:45,640
Yes.

1844
01:28:45,640 --> 01:28:46,640
Jonathan Warren.

1845
01:28:46,640 --> 01:28:49,640
So not only is he the head of the Liberace Foundation, and he runs these tours, he's

1846
01:28:49,640 --> 01:28:54,640
also the console to Monaco, which he told us about immediately when we were eating sushi

1847
01:28:54,640 --> 01:28:55,640
with him.

1848
01:28:55,640 --> 01:28:59,640
And then it was like him telling us just how easy it is to become the console somewhere.

1849
01:28:59,640 --> 01:29:01,640
You just have to know the right people.

1850
01:29:01,640 --> 01:29:10,640
So that's one guy who's very much in charge of the Liberace, like a lot of Liberace stuff.

1851
01:29:10,640 --> 01:29:17,640
But just recently we found out about a second guy, because there's a second foundation,

1852
01:29:17,640 --> 01:29:24,640
which is called the Friends of Liberace's Mansion Foundation, which is run by a second

1853
01:29:24,640 --> 01:29:27,640
guy named Martin Ravenhill.

1854
01:29:28,640 --> 01:29:35,640
Here he is in a fancy bathtub with three little dogs.

1855
01:29:35,640 --> 01:29:44,640
So Martin Ravenhill bought the Liberace Mansion 10 years ago when it had been foreclosed upon

1856
01:29:44,640 --> 01:29:46,640
in the bank-owned debt.

1857
01:29:46,640 --> 01:29:50,640
He bought it for $500,000, and he spent 10 years restoring it.

1858
01:29:50,640 --> 01:29:56,640
And now you can do a private tour, and it's a separate thing to do a private tour where

1859
01:29:56,640 --> 01:29:59,640
Martin Ravenhill takes you around the Liberace Mansion.

1860
01:29:59,640 --> 01:30:05,640
So we did it today.

1861
01:30:05,640 --> 01:30:10,640
We did it at 11 a.m. today.

1862
01:30:10,640 --> 01:30:16,640
That's me and Mike with Martin Ravenhill, who fucking rules.

1863
01:30:16,640 --> 01:30:18,640
We love Martin Ravenhill.

1864
01:30:18,640 --> 01:30:20,640
We love him so much.

1865
01:30:20,640 --> 01:30:22,640
He was really, really cool.

1866
01:30:22,640 --> 01:30:27,640
Just a really sweet dude who just has made his life's work to restore this decrepit,

1867
01:30:27,640 --> 01:30:31,640
weird mansion, and incredibly charming.

1868
01:30:31,640 --> 01:30:37,640
I feel like when we're talking about these, when you picture somebody who owns a bunch

1869
01:30:37,640 --> 01:30:42,640
of the Liberace stuff, and then you see a photo with three little dogs in a fancy bath,

1870
01:30:42,640 --> 01:30:44,640
you start imagining guy.

1871
01:30:44,640 --> 01:30:46,640
Well, like a Dr. Evil cat situation.

1872
01:30:46,640 --> 01:30:47,640
Yes, yeah, yeah.

1873
01:30:47,640 --> 01:30:49,640
And he is a bald man.

1874
01:30:49,640 --> 01:30:54,640
I think I'm jumping to conclusions here, so I'm delighted to hear that he's a delightful man.

1875
01:30:54,640 --> 01:30:55,640
He's really cool.

1876
01:30:55,640 --> 01:31:00,640
He wrote a book about being a good friend that was on display at the mansion.

1877
01:31:00,640 --> 01:31:04,640
Yes, it's in like a little case.

1878
01:31:04,640 --> 01:31:10,640
I immediately started talking about Liberace as Shondell on the Batman 60s show, which he kind of knew about.

1879
01:31:10,640 --> 01:31:13,640
Yes, he kept asking you questions about it.

1880
01:31:13,640 --> 01:31:19,640
He kept asking me questions as if I was the Liberace expert, which I, by the way, was very proud of.

1881
01:31:19,640 --> 01:31:20,640
I was like, hmm.

1882
01:31:20,640 --> 01:31:25,640
The weirdest thing about how he ended up buying, this is really quick, he told us the way he ended up buying the mansion

1883
01:31:25,640 --> 01:31:32,640
is that he was in Mexico for work, and somebody texted him, will you download, will you pirate behind the candelabra

1884
01:31:32,640 --> 01:31:34,640
so we can watch it?

1885
01:31:34,640 --> 01:31:38,640
But he wasn't able to, so instead he watched a trailer for Behind the Candelabra.

1886
01:31:38,640 --> 01:31:39,640
Yes.

1887
01:31:40,640 --> 01:31:48,640
He didn't know anything about Liberace, this was 10 years ago, and it rolled into a documentary about how the Liberace mansion had been foreclosed upon,

1888
01:31:48,640 --> 01:31:51,640
and so they were like, who will save the Liberace mansion?

1889
01:31:51,640 --> 01:31:53,640
Yeah, he did, he was like, and I decided to do it.

1890
01:31:53,640 --> 01:31:58,640
Yeah, so he moved to Las Vegas and just bought it.

1891
01:31:58,640 --> 01:32:02,640
No previous interest, or this was not a lifelong thing.

1892
01:32:02,640 --> 01:32:06,640
He got Liberace peeled from behind the candelabra, like a lot of us.

1893
01:32:06,640 --> 01:32:07,640
From the trailer.

1894
01:32:07,640 --> 01:32:09,640
From the trailer of Behind the Candelabra.

1895
01:32:09,640 --> 01:32:16,640
The story does not end with him watching the movie, it ends with him seeing a YouTube video that it linked to that got him thinking I should buy this house.

1896
01:32:16,640 --> 01:32:17,640
Yes.

1897
01:32:17,640 --> 01:32:18,640
And then he just did it.

1898
01:32:18,640 --> 01:32:25,640
He did it, and then, like, because we go in there and like, it is like, got all this like, you know, opulent stuff in there,

1899
01:32:25,640 --> 01:32:30,640
and at first I was like, oh, a lot of this probably was hanging around, and he even said like, oh, a lot of this had been sold, and I got it back,

1900
01:32:30,640 --> 01:32:36,640
and I was like, yeah, but how much of that is, like, maybe some of this was still here, and he would, and then I looked on Zillow later,

1901
01:32:36,640 --> 01:32:39,640
from 10 years ago, and it was completely empty.

1902
01:32:39,640 --> 01:32:46,640
He has like, obsessively reconstructed Liberace's house from furniture and like, vases.

1903
01:32:46,640 --> 01:32:47,640
Photos he found.

1904
01:32:47,640 --> 01:32:48,640
Photos. It's insane.

1905
01:32:48,640 --> 01:32:53,640
The thing we couldn't get over though is that he said there were just like a bunch of squatters living in the mansion when he bought it,

1906
01:32:53,640 --> 01:32:56,640
and it's like, what was that situation?

1907
01:32:56,640 --> 01:33:00,640
Like, what was going on with the squatters living in Liberace's mansion?

1908
01:33:00,640 --> 01:33:03,640
Because there's paintings of him on the ceiling looking down at you.

1909
01:33:04,640 --> 01:33:09,640
Yeah, I have, let me, I have a one, oh wait, shoot, it's right here.

1910
01:33:09,640 --> 01:33:12,640
Yeah, that's what, it's like, that's the bathroom ceiling.

1911
01:33:12,640 --> 01:33:17,640
This is what the bathroom ceiling, this is not like a secret photo, this is online, you can find this.

1912
01:33:17,640 --> 01:33:25,640
He had the, like, the mural on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel painted on his bedroom, and that's been restored.

1913
01:33:25,640 --> 01:33:27,640
And it was painted by Michelangelo's relative.

1914
01:33:27,640 --> 01:33:29,640
A descendant of Michelangelo.

1915
01:33:30,640 --> 01:33:31,640
Well, then it must be good.

1916
01:33:31,640 --> 01:33:34,640
Yeah, only a blood relative can do it.

1917
01:33:34,640 --> 01:33:38,640
There was no Liberace, I asked, I go, is there a secret Liberace up here anywhere?

1918
01:33:38,640 --> 01:33:40,640
And he was like, no, no, it's just the Sistine Chapel.

1919
01:33:41,640 --> 01:33:44,640
But I was like, are you sure it's not like a hit, an Easter egg? But no.

1920
01:33:44,640 --> 01:33:47,640
Anyway, the best guy of all time, Martin Ravenhill.

1921
01:33:47,640 --> 01:33:49,640
Oh my God, that's incredible.

1922
01:33:49,640 --> 01:33:50,640
Cheers.

1923
01:33:50,640 --> 01:33:51,640
Wow.

1924
01:33:51,640 --> 01:33:52,640
But really quick.

1925
01:33:52,640 --> 01:33:53,640
To Martin.

1926
01:33:54,640 --> 01:33:57,640
Jonathan Warren is not Martin Ravenhill.

1927
01:33:57,640 --> 01:34:03,640
And the Liberace Foundation is not the Friends of the Liberace Mansion Foundation.

1928
01:34:03,640 --> 01:34:05,640
And from the sound of it, they don't get along.

1929
01:34:06,640 --> 01:34:09,640
They are not speaking.

1930
01:34:10,640 --> 01:34:17,640
I was trying to find, because one of the things I want the most is like a Liberace action figure, especially from the Batman.

1931
01:34:17,640 --> 01:34:22,640
And I was like, do you know the guy who might have the likeness, like owns the likeness rights, and he did not seem to have that information.

1932
01:34:22,640 --> 01:34:25,640
But it might be the other guy. It might be, what's his name?

1933
01:34:25,640 --> 01:34:28,640
I think you might have to go to Jonathan Warren, Darkside Martin Ravenhill.

1934
01:34:28,640 --> 01:34:30,640
He did encourage me to do this.

1935
01:34:31,640 --> 01:34:32,640
Wow.

1936
01:34:34,640 --> 01:34:35,640
Which.

1937
01:34:35,640 --> 01:34:36,640
Mike at the piano.

1938
01:34:36,640 --> 01:34:38,640
And a piano covered in rhinestones.

1939
01:34:38,640 --> 01:34:39,640
Covered in rhinestones.

1940
01:34:39,640 --> 01:34:43,640
This was not one of his real pianos. It was a new piano made to look like an old piano.

1941
01:34:43,640 --> 01:34:44,640
It's a replica.

1942
01:34:45,640 --> 01:34:51,640
Because I was hoping he was going to offer to let me play one of the real ones, but it did not come to. I was not going to be rude and ask.

1943
01:34:51,640 --> 01:34:53,640
Still a very powerful photo.

1944
01:34:53,640 --> 01:34:54,640
Powerful energy.

1945
01:34:56,640 --> 01:34:58,640
Every photo of me has power.

1946
01:34:58,640 --> 01:35:00,640
And your Mickey flat brim.

1947
01:35:00,640 --> 01:35:01,640
Wow.

1948
01:35:01,640 --> 01:35:05,640
Today I've been dressed like the Steve Buscemi Hello Fellow Kids meme.

1949
01:35:08,640 --> 01:35:10,640
And I think I've been pulling it off, quite frankly.

1950
01:35:10,640 --> 01:35:11,640
I think you have.

1951
01:35:11,640 --> 01:35:14,640
It's working. Wow, they let a high school kid do a show.

1952
01:35:15,640 --> 01:35:21,640
He did say we were young. He was like, you know, you're young. What do you know about Liberace? And everyone was like, thank you.

1953
01:35:23,640 --> 01:35:24,640
We are, yeah.

1954
01:35:24,640 --> 01:35:27,640
Yes, we're very, we're way too young to know about Liberace.

1955
01:35:27,640 --> 01:35:30,640
So I guess he is passing on to young generations.

1956
01:35:30,640 --> 01:35:31,640
Oh, well, kind of.

1957
01:35:33,640 --> 01:35:34,640
Weird younger people.

1958
01:35:36,640 --> 01:35:37,640
Well, geez, incredible.

1959
01:35:37,640 --> 01:35:39,640
I'm glad this was a victorious trip.

1960
01:35:39,640 --> 01:35:40,640
Yes.

1961
01:35:40,640 --> 01:35:49,640
I mean, and you, I mean, I hate to pit them against each other, but it does seem like Martin's winning, even though, like, Jonathan gave you sushi.

1962
01:35:49,640 --> 01:35:50,640
Yeah.

1963
01:35:50,640 --> 01:35:51,640
They're giving points for that.

1964
01:35:51,640 --> 01:35:55,640
I mean, they're both fascinating, important people to have in Las Vegas.

1965
01:35:55,640 --> 01:36:00,640
And if they both have to exist or else the Liberace will implode.

1966
01:36:00,640 --> 01:36:03,640
It's like the star, a dyad in Star Wars.

1967
01:36:03,640 --> 01:36:04,640
Yes.

1968
01:36:05,640 --> 01:36:08,640
It's Kylo Ren and Rey.

1969
01:36:08,640 --> 01:36:09,640
Rey, yeah.

1970
01:36:09,640 --> 01:36:13,640
What's interesting about the, where he lives is like, it's just the street.

1971
01:36:13,640 --> 01:36:17,640
It's not like, oh my gosh, it's giant mansions on the street.

1972
01:36:17,640 --> 01:36:20,640
It's just like house, house, house, Liberace, house.

1973
01:36:20,640 --> 01:36:28,640
It's like very, like I went to a McDonald's a minute away and got an iced coffee and then drove and parked in front of Liberace's house.

1974
01:36:28,640 --> 01:36:29,640
I recommend just looking at it from outside.

1975
01:36:29,640 --> 01:36:31,640
There's like plaques and you can just drive.

1976
01:36:31,640 --> 01:36:32,640
It's right by here.

1977
01:36:32,640 --> 01:36:33,640
Yeah, it's so close.

1978
01:36:33,640 --> 01:36:34,640
It's really cool from the street.

1979
01:36:34,640 --> 01:36:35,640
It's so close.

1980
01:36:35,640 --> 01:36:40,640
And at first, I remember I was driving there this morning and I went, I am not prepared to go to Liberace's house today.

1981
01:36:40,640 --> 01:36:42,640
But everything that he made was very nice.

1982
01:36:42,640 --> 01:36:43,640
And how so?

1983
01:36:43,640 --> 01:36:45,640
What would you have had to have done?

1984
01:36:45,640 --> 01:36:46,640
It just felt overwhelming.

1985
01:36:46,640 --> 01:36:47,640
It's a legendary house.

1986
01:36:47,640 --> 01:36:49,640
But you didn't, you didn't faint.

1987
01:36:49,640 --> 01:36:50,640
No, I didn't.

1988
01:36:50,640 --> 01:36:56,640
No, not like the Minotaur situation where I got a panic attack before going into Liberace's house.

1989
01:36:56,640 --> 01:36:59,640
You asked Martin, hey, do you have a trash can in here?

1990
01:36:59,640 --> 01:37:00,640
To puke?

1991
01:37:00,640 --> 01:37:02,640
For your iced coffee.

1992
01:37:02,640 --> 01:37:04,640
No, I left the iced coffee in the car.

1993
01:37:04,640 --> 01:37:05,640
I didn't want to be rude.

1994
01:37:05,640 --> 01:37:10,640
You didn't get to put your coffee in the fanciest trash can ever made.

1995
01:37:10,640 --> 01:37:12,640
Thousand rhinestone trash cans.

1996
01:37:12,640 --> 01:37:13,640
No, I did not.

1997
01:37:13,640 --> 01:37:14,640
Geez.

1998
01:37:14,640 --> 01:37:15,640
Well, incredible.

1999
01:37:15,640 --> 01:37:17,640
Do we have time for one more?

2000
01:37:17,640 --> 01:37:20,640
I think we can fit another guy.

2001
01:37:20,640 --> 01:37:21,640
Let's see.

2002
01:37:21,640 --> 01:37:24,640
Any more big travelers here?

2003
01:37:24,640 --> 01:37:26,640
We'll do an actual spin.

2004
01:37:26,640 --> 01:37:28,640
How do I choose?

2005
01:37:28,640 --> 01:37:30,640
Who thinks they may?

2006
01:37:30,640 --> 01:37:33,640
Like really shake your hand around if you think you came from really far away.

2007
01:37:33,640 --> 01:37:36,640
Even better if you're sitting on an aisle.

2008
01:37:36,640 --> 01:37:38,640
Yeah, that's true.

2009
01:37:38,640 --> 01:37:40,640
I'm not trying to learn the white shirt here.

2010
01:37:40,640 --> 01:37:41,640
Let's do this.

2011
01:37:41,640 --> 01:37:42,640
Come on up.

2012
01:37:42,640 --> 01:37:43,640
Fantastic.

2013
01:37:43,640 --> 01:37:47,640
Let me move these cigarettes that are just weirdly at my crotch right now.

2014
01:37:47,640 --> 01:37:49,640
Seven cigarettes.

2015
01:37:49,640 --> 01:37:50,640
Hello, sir.

2016
01:37:50,640 --> 01:37:51,640
What's your name?

2017
01:37:51,640 --> 01:37:52,640
Where did you come in from?

2018
01:37:52,640 --> 01:37:54,640
David, and I'm from the land of Mike.

2019
01:37:54,640 --> 01:37:55,640
I'm from Chicago.

2020
01:37:55,640 --> 01:37:56,640
Wow.

2021
01:37:56,640 --> 01:37:57,640
Hey.

2022
01:37:57,640 --> 01:37:58,640
Give it up for that.

2023
01:37:58,640 --> 01:37:59,640
Yeah.

2024
01:37:59,640 --> 01:38:00,640
Is that catching on?

2025
01:38:00,640 --> 01:38:01,640
Are they calling it that there?

2026
01:38:01,640 --> 01:38:02,640
Everybody's calling it the land of Mike.

2027
01:38:02,640 --> 01:38:03,640
The land of Mike.

2028
01:38:03,640 --> 01:38:04,640
That's right.

2029
01:38:04,640 --> 01:38:07,640
What else are you doing while you're in town?

2030
01:38:07,640 --> 01:38:08,640
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

2031
01:38:08,640 --> 01:38:09,640
Really?

2032
01:38:09,640 --> 01:38:10,640
Wow.

2033
01:38:10,640 --> 01:38:11,640
Wow.

2034
01:38:11,640 --> 01:38:12,640
God bless.

2035
01:38:12,640 --> 01:38:16,640
These people who feel the need to do other things, like have a meal or two.

2036
01:38:16,640 --> 01:38:17,640
We appreciate the PTR commitment.

2037
01:38:17,640 --> 01:38:18,640
Really good to meet you.

2038
01:38:18,640 --> 01:38:19,640
Thanks for coming up.

2039
01:38:19,640 --> 01:38:20,640
Go ahead and give it a spin.

2040
01:38:20,640 --> 01:38:21,640
Let's see.

2041
01:38:21,640 --> 01:38:22,640
Who else?

2042
01:38:22,640 --> 01:38:25,640
Who have we not landed on, on the guy's roulette wheel tonight?

2043
01:38:25,640 --> 01:38:26,640
Oh, it's me.

2044
01:38:26,640 --> 01:38:27,640
Oh, it's you.

2045
01:38:27,640 --> 01:38:28,640
Oh, it's you.

2046
01:38:28,640 --> 01:38:29,640
Oh, it's you.

2047
01:38:29,640 --> 01:38:30,640
Oh, it's you.

2048
01:38:30,640 --> 01:38:31,640
Oh, it's you.

2049
01:38:31,640 --> 01:38:32,640
Oh, it's you.

2050
01:38:32,640 --> 01:38:33,640
Oh, it's you.

2051
01:38:33,640 --> 01:38:34,640
Oh, it's you.

2052
01:38:34,640 --> 01:38:35,640
Oh, it's you.

2053
01:38:35,640 --> 01:38:36,640
Oh, it's you.

2054
01:38:36,640 --> 01:38:37,640
Oh, it's you.

2055
01:38:37,640 --> 01:38:38,640
Two nights.

2056
01:38:38,640 --> 01:38:39,640
Two nights.

2057
01:38:39,640 --> 01:38:40,640
Two nights.

2058
01:38:40,640 --> 01:38:41,640
Two nights.

2059
01:38:41,640 --> 01:38:42,640
We're back.

2060
01:38:42,640 --> 01:38:43,640
Okay, okay.

2061
01:38:43,640 --> 01:38:44,640
So, let me, aids, you want to give it one more?

2062
01:38:44,640 --> 01:38:45,640
And if we don't, then we'll just let you tip it wherever you think it should go.

2063
01:38:45,640 --> 01:38:46,640
Let's see, let's see.

2064
01:38:46,640 --> 01:38:47,640
Oh, oh, oh.

2065
01:38:47,640 --> 01:38:48,640
Yeah, Steve wins.

2066
01:38:48,640 --> 01:38:49,640
I think we were all rooting for Steve to win.

2067
01:38:49,640 --> 01:38:50,640
Put it there.

2068
01:38:50,640 --> 01:38:51,640
Perfect, perfect.

2069
01:38:51,640 --> 01:38:52,640
Win, win, win, win, win, win, win.

2070
01:38:52,640 --> 01:38:53,640
You know what?

2071
01:38:53,640 --> 01:38:54,640
Forget and win.

2072
01:38:54,640 --> 01:38:55,640
Or take two.

2073
01:38:55,640 --> 01:38:56,640
Let's do two if you want two.

2074
01:38:56,640 --> 01:38:57,640
Okay.

2075
01:38:57,640 --> 01:38:58,640
Okay.

2076
01:38:58,640 --> 01:38:59,640
Okay.

2077
01:38:59,640 --> 01:39:00,640
Okay.

2078
01:39:00,640 --> 01:39:01,640
Okay.

2079
01:39:01,640 --> 01:39:02,640
Okay.

2080
01:39:02,640 --> 01:39:03,640
Okay.

2081
01:39:03,640 --> 01:39:04,640
Okay.

2082
01:39:04,640 --> 01:39:05,640
Okay.

2083
01:39:05,640 --> 01:39:06,640
Okay.

2084
01:39:06,640 --> 01:39:07,640
Let's do two if you want two.

2085
01:39:07,640 --> 01:39:08,640
Take two, two.

2086
01:39:08,640 --> 01:39:09,640
Hey, fantastic.

2087
01:39:09,640 --> 01:39:10,640
Hey, give it a ride.

2088
01:39:10,640 --> 01:39:11,640
Thanks so much for being here.

2089
01:39:11,640 --> 01:39:12,640
Thanks for driving in.

2090
01:39:12,640 --> 01:39:13,640
Not driving in.

2091
01:39:13,640 --> 01:39:16,640
Red eye, red eye, as he said.

2092
01:39:16,640 --> 01:39:19,640
Okay, Steve win.

2093
01:39:19,640 --> 01:39:24,640
I mean, that seems like a great place to wind it down.

2094
01:39:24,640 --> 01:39:27,640
So, Steve win.

2095
01:39:27,640 --> 01:39:31,640
I mean, very fond of him, I think, of some of the things.

2096
01:39:31,640 --> 01:39:33,640
Well, as you say, some, yeah.

2097
01:39:33,640 --> 01:39:40,640
Yeah, he's credited as like changing it from just a gambling town to like an entertainment

2098
01:39:40,640 --> 01:39:41,640
town.

2099
01:39:41,640 --> 01:39:42,640
Sure.

2100
01:39:42,640 --> 01:39:43,640
Like one of those guys.

2101
01:39:43,640 --> 01:39:44,640
Yeah.

2102
01:39:44,640 --> 01:39:45,640
Yeah.

2103
01:39:45,640 --> 01:39:46,640
See, yeah.

2104
01:39:46,640 --> 01:39:47,640
No, the flash, the panache.

2105
01:39:47,640 --> 01:39:48,640
You have to give it up to Steve win.

2106
01:39:48,640 --> 01:39:56,640
Steve win worked his way up through the ownership of the golden nuggets and he established in

2107
01:39:56,640 --> 01:40:02,640
the golden nugget era that he is a person who would like to be on camera.

2108
01:40:02,640 --> 01:40:06,640
This is, you know, I'm not just somebody behind a desk.

2109
01:40:06,640 --> 01:40:11,640
I want to represent my places in commercials.

2110
01:40:11,640 --> 01:40:13,640
And we've alluded to this one, I think, many times.

2111
01:40:13,640 --> 01:40:18,640
I know we're both big fans of the classic golden nugget commercial.

2112
01:40:18,640 --> 01:40:19,640
Let's check this out together.

2113
01:40:19,640 --> 01:40:22,640
If you guys haven't seen this.

2114
01:40:22,640 --> 01:40:24,640
Hi, I'm Steve win.

2115
01:40:24,640 --> 01:40:30,640
And this is one of the beautiful suites in the golden nugget of Las Vegas, which, as

2116
01:40:30,640 --> 01:40:31,640
everybody knows, is downtown.

2117
01:40:31,640 --> 01:40:37,640
Nevertheless, you'd be amazed if you knew how many people think that this is uptown.

2118
01:40:37,640 --> 01:40:40,640
Hi, Mr. Sinatra.

2119
01:40:40,640 --> 01:40:41,640
I'm Steve win.

2120
01:40:41,640 --> 01:40:42,640
I run this place.

2121
01:40:42,640 --> 01:40:45,640
You see, I get enough towels.

2122
01:40:45,640 --> 01:40:46,640
Towels?

2123
01:40:46,640 --> 01:40:47,640
Towels?

2124
01:40:47,640 --> 01:41:07,640
That's what the people down at the front desk say when Jason calls in to ask for more

2125
01:41:07,640 --> 01:41:08,640
towels.

2126
01:41:08,640 --> 01:41:11,640
See that I get enough towels.

2127
01:41:11,640 --> 01:41:13,640
You're like the chairman in that scenario.

2128
01:41:13,640 --> 01:41:15,640
Yeah, yeah.

2129
01:41:45,640 --> 01:41:48,640
Someone on TV wouldn't do something bad, right?

2130
01:41:48,640 --> 01:41:58,640
There's like a, I think, a flair of theatricality to everything that Steve win did.

2131
01:41:58,640 --> 01:42:02,640
And that includes the places that he did.

2132
01:42:02,640 --> 01:42:04,640
His inspiration for the hotels.

2133
01:42:04,640 --> 01:42:12,640
I mean, the body of work was Mirage and Treasure Island, Bellagio, the win, the encore.

2134
01:42:12,640 --> 01:42:17,640
He did all of these places and the Mirage seems like were really like a cracked open

2135
01:42:17,640 --> 01:42:22,640
for him and where it is, it does start to get Disneyland-y and like, and theater-y too.

2136
01:42:22,640 --> 01:42:27,640
And he kind of described some of the inspiration for the Mirage in this clip.

2137
01:42:27,640 --> 01:42:34,640
And just keep, as this clip goes on, keep an eye out for the, who is conducting the

2138
01:42:34,640 --> 01:42:35,640
interview.

2139
01:42:35,640 --> 01:42:37,640
I think it'll be of note.

2140
01:42:37,640 --> 01:42:41,640
Yeah, good.

2141
01:42:41,640 --> 01:42:47,640
And then an idea came into my mind, an image of Josh Logan, the director doing South Pacific

2142
01:42:47,640 --> 01:42:53,640
and I heard Juanita Hall's voice singing, Bali-i is calling.

2143
01:42:53,640 --> 01:42:54,640
Jason knows.

2144
01:42:54,640 --> 01:42:55,640
Too many orange filters.

2145
01:42:55,640 --> 01:43:01,640
And I said to myself, well, suppose that what you see with your eyes is not what your brain

2146
01:43:01,640 --> 01:43:05,640
knows should be there.

2147
01:43:05,640 --> 01:43:06,640
There he is.

2148
01:43:06,640 --> 01:43:08,640
That's a good face.

2149
01:43:08,640 --> 01:43:09,640
Wow.

2150
01:43:09,640 --> 01:43:11,640
That is this, this is his interview show, the Michael Eisner.

2151
01:43:11,640 --> 01:43:14,640
Yeah, yeah, that was from Conversations with Michael Eisner.

2152
01:43:14,640 --> 01:43:16,640
Tense smile I've ever seen.

2153
01:43:16,640 --> 01:43:17,640
Hmm.

2154
01:43:17,640 --> 01:43:18,640
Hmm.

2155
01:43:18,640 --> 01:43:19,640
Mm hmm.

2156
01:43:19,640 --> 01:43:20,640
That's all just.

2157
01:43:20,640 --> 01:43:25,640
Could we all.

2158
01:43:25,640 --> 01:43:29,640
Could we all just sit in silence for 10 seconds and look at his face?

2159
01:43:29,640 --> 01:43:30,640
Yeah, seems good.

2160
01:43:30,640 --> 01:43:31,640
Yeah.

2161
01:43:31,640 --> 01:43:37,640
Okay, count in your head.

2162
01:43:37,640 --> 01:43:40,640
I hear laughing.

2163
01:43:40,640 --> 01:43:41,640
Do we have to start over?

2164
01:43:41,640 --> 01:43:43,640
We have to start over, yeah.

2165
01:43:43,640 --> 01:43:45,640
We have to start over.

2166
01:43:45,640 --> 01:43:47,640
Oh, blue, what?

2167
01:43:47,640 --> 01:43:51,640
You said count in your head and you immediately started counting on your hands.

2168
01:43:51,640 --> 01:43:53,640
Well, I was helping everyone in their head.

2169
01:43:53,640 --> 01:43:54,640
Oh, okay.

2170
01:43:54,640 --> 01:43:55,640
All right.

2171
01:43:55,640 --> 01:43:56,640
I was doing, anyway.

2172
01:43:56,640 --> 01:43:57,640
What did you get out of that?

2173
01:43:57,640 --> 01:44:00,640
Did you notice anything you haven't seen before?

2174
01:44:00,640 --> 01:44:02,640
Yeah.

2175
01:44:02,640 --> 01:44:04,640
Hmm.

2176
01:44:04,640 --> 01:44:08,640
Well, clearly this needs to be the next thing projected on the sphere.

2177
01:44:08,640 --> 01:44:09,640
Oh my God.

2178
01:44:09,640 --> 01:44:10,640
Eisner's big face.

2179
01:44:10,640 --> 01:44:11,640
Yeah, yeah.

2180
01:44:11,640 --> 01:44:13,640
That would be so good.

2181
01:44:13,640 --> 01:44:14,640
This is great.

2182
01:44:14,640 --> 01:44:16,640
This is already like 10 years old, I bet, right?

2183
01:44:16,640 --> 01:44:17,640
This interview?

2184
01:44:17,640 --> 01:44:18,640
Could be.

2185
01:44:18,640 --> 01:44:19,640
Yeah, yeah.

2186
01:44:19,640 --> 01:44:24,140
Well, it's certainly not from the recent past because Steve Wynn's not doing too much around

2187
01:44:24,140 --> 01:44:25,140
here anymore.

2188
01:44:25,140 --> 01:44:34,240
I, you know, maybe one of the biggest me too's, I would say, just purely financial in terms

2189
01:44:34,240 --> 01:44:36,240
of like power and amount of money.

2190
01:44:36,240 --> 01:44:39,240
Is he like possibly the biggest person that was taken down?

2191
01:44:39,240 --> 01:44:44,240
There's a lot of metrics for me to run around in my head right now.

2192
01:44:44,240 --> 01:44:49,240
So I don't want to definitively say that, but certainly up there.

2193
01:44:49,240 --> 01:44:50,240
Yeah.

2194
01:44:50,240 --> 01:44:58,240
But the, you know, more fun times before we knew these things we should have known.

2195
01:44:58,240 --> 01:45:05,240
Should have just laughed at his funny ads.

2196
01:45:05,240 --> 01:45:13,240
Should have suspected something not as trustworthy of a space as Eisner.

2197
01:45:13,240 --> 01:45:18,240
Let's watch one that I definitely remember getting a lot of play at the time.

2198
01:45:18,240 --> 01:45:24,240
Do you guys remember the ads where he was announcing both the Wynn and the encore and

2199
01:45:24,240 --> 01:45:26,240
was sitting up on top of the hotel?

2200
01:45:26,240 --> 01:45:29,240
I want to show the second one of these.

2201
01:45:29,240 --> 01:45:32,240
This is the encore, the second one.

2202
01:45:32,240 --> 01:45:34,240
Let's check this out.

2203
01:45:34,240 --> 01:45:37,240
Hello, I'm over here.

2204
01:45:37,240 --> 01:45:42,240
Three years ago, I stood over there introducing you to Wynn Las Vegas.

2205
01:45:42,240 --> 01:45:45,240
Now I'm following it up the best way I know how.

2206
01:45:45,240 --> 01:45:48,240
This is encore.

2207
01:45:48,240 --> 01:45:53,240
Wow.

2208
01:45:53,240 --> 01:45:56,240
And it zooms all the way out.

2209
01:45:56,240 --> 01:45:57,240
Yeah.

2210
01:45:57,240 --> 01:45:58,240
Yeah.

2211
01:45:58,240 --> 01:46:02,240
So it's like Tom Cruise Mission Impossible 4.

2212
01:46:02,240 --> 01:46:04,240
Steve Wynn on co-commercial.

2213
01:46:04,240 --> 01:46:05,240
Uh-huh.

2214
01:46:05,240 --> 01:46:06,240
Next level.

2215
01:46:06,240 --> 01:46:07,240
He did it first too.

2216
01:46:07,240 --> 01:46:09,240
He saved Las Vegas.

2217
01:46:09,240 --> 01:46:10,240
Tom Cruise saved the movies.

2218
01:46:10,240 --> 01:46:11,240
Right.

2219
01:46:11,240 --> 01:46:12,240
Popcorn.

2220
01:46:12,240 --> 01:46:15,240
Popcorn movies.

2221
01:46:15,240 --> 01:46:16,240
Sitting buildings.

2222
01:46:16,240 --> 01:46:17,240
Sitting.

2223
01:46:17,240 --> 01:46:18,240
Building.

2224
01:46:18,240 --> 01:46:19,240
Towels.

2225
01:46:19,240 --> 01:46:20,240
Towels.

2226
01:46:20,240 --> 01:46:21,240
Building.

2227
01:46:21,240 --> 01:46:22,240
Sitting.

2228
01:46:22,240 --> 01:46:23,240
Shrek Stitch.

2229
01:46:23,240 --> 01:46:24,240
Shrek Stitch.

2230
01:46:24,240 --> 01:46:25,240
Jason.

2231
01:46:25,240 --> 01:46:26,240
Cool ad, right?

2232
01:46:26,240 --> 01:46:29,240
You might be wondering who put that amazing ad together.

2233
01:46:29,240 --> 01:46:32,240
Who did that incredible helicopter shot?

2234
01:46:32,240 --> 01:46:35,240
Can you play the next clip, please?

2235
01:46:35,240 --> 01:46:42,240
Las Vegas developer Steve Wynn joined forces with famed director Brett Rafferty.

2236
01:46:43,240 --> 01:46:44,240
Encore.

2237
01:46:44,240 --> 01:46:47,240
Yep, yep, yep.

2238
01:46:47,240 --> 01:46:52,240
I love that he's like doing the director fingers.

2239
01:46:52,240 --> 01:46:53,240
Necessary.

2240
01:46:53,240 --> 01:46:58,240
He's bringing Steve Wynn back to life.

2241
01:46:58,240 --> 01:47:01,240
And you're giving him the symbol of love?

2242
01:47:01,240 --> 01:47:02,240
Yeah.

2243
01:47:02,240 --> 01:47:05,240
And you're giving him the symbol of love.

2244
01:47:05,240 --> 01:47:10,240
And you're giving him the symbol of love?

2245
01:47:10,240 --> 01:47:13,240
He's giving him the symbol of love, yeah.

2246
01:47:13,240 --> 01:47:15,240
Well, look, we've...

2247
01:47:15,240 --> 01:47:18,240
Can I say one more thing about him?

2248
01:47:18,240 --> 01:47:19,240
Yes, absolutely.

2249
01:47:19,240 --> 01:47:22,240
I don't want to talk about this on the podcast, but maybe we have.

2250
01:47:22,240 --> 01:47:27,240
He spent maybe a million dollars at auction for a Maltese Falcon that probably isn't real.

2251
01:47:27,240 --> 01:47:28,240
What?

2252
01:47:28,240 --> 01:47:33,240
According to the big New Yorker piece about all the Maltese Falcons, he spent a million

2253
01:47:33,240 --> 01:47:38,240
dollars at auction for a Maltese Falcon that probably isn't real.

2254
01:47:38,240 --> 01:47:43,240
And it was like, that's probably just fake, but he owns it.

2255
01:47:43,240 --> 01:47:45,240
Did they say that after the auction or before?

2256
01:47:45,240 --> 01:47:46,240
Way after.

2257
01:47:46,240 --> 01:47:49,240
It's like now there's experts trying to figure out which was the original and they're like,

2258
01:47:49,240 --> 01:47:51,240
it's definitely not that one.

2259
01:47:51,240 --> 01:47:52,240
Oh, wow.

2260
01:47:52,240 --> 01:47:53,240
Yeah.

2261
01:47:53,240 --> 01:47:55,240
Do you have legal recourse in that situation?

2262
01:47:55,240 --> 01:47:56,240
I mean, I don't know.

2263
01:47:56,240 --> 01:47:57,240
Don't tell him.

2264
01:47:57,240 --> 01:47:58,240
It's funny.

2265
01:47:58,240 --> 01:47:59,240
It is funny.

2266
01:47:59,240 --> 01:48:00,240
And I won't...

2267
01:48:00,240 --> 01:48:01,240
You're right.

2268
01:48:01,240 --> 01:48:02,240
I won't tell him.

2269
01:48:02,240 --> 01:48:04,240
The guys need to get what they deserve.

2270
01:48:04,240 --> 01:48:07,240
So he got tricked by a Falcon.

2271
01:48:07,240 --> 01:48:14,240
And earlier this week, the Nevada gaming board made him pay $10 million and made him agree

2272
01:48:14,240 --> 01:48:18,240
to have no role in a casino besides customer.

2273
01:48:18,240 --> 01:48:19,240
So that happened this week.

2274
01:48:19,240 --> 01:48:20,240
Oh, he can play craps though.

2275
01:48:20,240 --> 01:48:22,240
Yeah, he can win it back.

2276
01:48:22,240 --> 01:48:23,240
Yeah.

2277
01:48:29,240 --> 01:48:31,240
Put it all on red?

2278
01:48:32,240 --> 01:48:34,240
What about sitting on one?

2279
01:48:34,240 --> 01:48:36,240
Can he still sit on one?

2280
01:48:36,240 --> 01:48:37,240
Uh-huh.

2281
01:48:37,240 --> 01:48:38,240
May not be.

2282
01:48:38,240 --> 01:48:39,240
Yep.

2283
01:48:39,240 --> 01:48:40,240
Yeah.

2284
01:48:40,240 --> 01:48:41,240
Yeah.

2285
01:48:41,240 --> 01:48:42,240
He can still get up there, still get Brett making the director fingers.

2286
01:48:42,240 --> 01:48:43,240
Yeah.

2287
01:48:43,240 --> 01:48:44,240
Yeah.

2288
01:48:44,240 --> 01:48:45,240
He can film as many as he wants.

2289
01:48:45,240 --> 01:48:47,240
He can sit on all the casinos?

2290
01:48:47,240 --> 01:48:50,240
That's how he gets back on top, literally.

2291
01:48:50,240 --> 01:48:54,240
Because he sits on each casino on the strip.

2292
01:48:54,240 --> 01:48:55,240
Hi.

2293
01:48:55,240 --> 01:48:56,240
I'm Steve Nguyen.

2294
01:48:56,240 --> 01:48:58,240
The last time you saw me, I was opening up to the encore.

2295
01:48:58,240 --> 01:49:01,240
Now I'm legally banned from doing anything like that again.

2296
01:49:01,240 --> 01:49:08,240
So I'm just here to sit on the Cosmopolitan and say, hello.

2297
01:49:08,240 --> 01:49:10,240
Take it away, Brett.

2298
01:49:10,240 --> 01:49:12,240
Me too, guys.

2299
01:49:12,240 --> 01:49:14,240
Got to stay busy somehow.

2300
01:49:14,240 --> 01:49:18,240
And then you cut to like Michael Eisner on the other side of the street sitting on the different...

2301
01:49:18,240 --> 01:49:19,240
Making the face.

2302
01:49:19,240 --> 01:49:20,240
Yeah.

2303
01:49:20,240 --> 01:49:24,240
But far away because he's in the helicopter pans out.

2304
01:49:24,240 --> 01:49:28,240
Eva, it's been a wonderful menagerie of guys.

2305
01:49:28,240 --> 01:49:30,240
I don't know.

2306
01:49:30,240 --> 01:49:32,240
Any closing observations?

2307
01:49:32,240 --> 01:49:33,240
Do we miss anybody?

2308
01:49:33,240 --> 01:49:36,240
We missed Elon.

2309
01:49:36,240 --> 01:49:40,240
But look, Elon's digging pointless tunnels under the city.

2310
01:49:40,240 --> 01:49:42,240
Don't go to the...

2311
01:49:42,240 --> 01:49:43,240
Oh, wait.

2312
01:49:43,240 --> 01:49:44,240
Jason had something about the pointless tunnels.

2313
01:49:44,240 --> 01:49:45,240
Yeah.

2314
01:49:45,240 --> 01:49:52,240
So the Vegas Loop, the tunnels, recently got approved for like a giant expansion.

2315
01:49:52,240 --> 01:49:57,240
And the mayor of Los Angeles, Mayor Carolyn Goodman...

2316
01:49:57,240 --> 01:49:58,240
Oh, Vegas?

2317
01:49:58,240 --> 01:49:59,240
He's in Los Angeles.

2318
01:49:59,240 --> 01:50:00,240
Oh, Las Vegas.

2319
01:50:00,240 --> 01:50:01,240
Las Vegas is not...

2320
01:50:01,240 --> 01:50:02,240
It happened.

2321
01:50:02,240 --> 01:50:04,240
It happened to me.

2322
01:50:04,240 --> 01:50:21,240
You might remember, if you're not from here, you might remember Carolyn Goodman from her interview with Anderson Cooper in 2020 or mid 2020 where she's possibly drunk and saying like, Vegas is open for business.

2323
01:50:21,240 --> 01:50:22,240
Vegas is open for business.

2324
01:50:22,240 --> 01:50:25,240
We're not concerned about this virus at all.

2325
01:50:25,240 --> 01:50:27,240
But a little more...

2326
01:50:27,240 --> 01:50:29,240
Doing an old hee haw character.

2327
01:50:29,240 --> 01:50:30,240
Yeah.

2328
01:50:30,240 --> 01:50:35,240
A little more eloquent, her comments on the Loop.

2329
01:50:35,240 --> 01:50:37,240
I think it's impractical.

2330
01:50:37,240 --> 01:50:38,240
It is not proven yet.

2331
01:50:38,240 --> 01:50:42,240
We don't have any raw, real data that's confirmed.

2332
01:50:42,240 --> 01:50:45,240
I find it unsafe and inaccessible.

2333
01:50:45,240 --> 01:50:46,240
It is operator driven.

2334
01:50:46,240 --> 01:50:51,240
Therefore, it's not on a rail and cannot move us all safely.

2335
01:50:51,240 --> 01:50:56,240
If this car that you're looking at gets a flat, it backs up all the way.

2336
01:50:56,240 --> 01:50:58,240
It backs up all the way, the traffic.

2337
01:50:58,240 --> 01:51:01,240
There are no exits along the way.

2338
01:51:01,240 --> 01:51:06,240
If we have a grid problem, we all know what the problems are with energy.

2339
01:51:06,240 --> 01:51:08,240
Look at California.

2340
01:51:08,240 --> 01:51:10,240
So I don't quite...

2341
01:51:10,240 --> 01:51:13,240
That last part is a little confusing to me.

2342
01:51:13,240 --> 01:51:17,240
By the way, she did vote yes on this expansion.

2343
01:51:21,240 --> 01:51:23,240
Possibly a guy too.

2344
01:51:23,240 --> 01:51:24,240
Possibly a guy too.

2345
01:51:24,240 --> 01:51:26,240
We don't have lady guys.

2346
01:51:26,240 --> 01:51:27,240
I know that...

2347
01:51:27,240 --> 01:51:29,240
Ladies are guys.

2348
01:51:29,240 --> 01:51:31,240
Ladies can be guys.

2349
01:51:31,240 --> 01:51:33,240
Yeah, we're researching.

2350
01:51:33,240 --> 01:51:34,240
Looking into it.

2351
01:51:34,240 --> 01:51:39,240
With infinite resources and money, if you set out to be a Vegas guy,

2352
01:51:39,240 --> 01:51:42,240
do you have any thought how you might do that?

2353
01:51:42,240 --> 01:51:44,240
Third Liberace Foundation.

2354
01:51:47,240 --> 01:51:49,240
I pit them all against each other.

2355
01:51:49,240 --> 01:51:52,240
Which aspect of Liberace would you want to control?

2356
01:51:55,240 --> 01:51:57,240
Cars only.

2357
01:51:57,240 --> 01:51:58,240
Okay.

2358
01:51:58,240 --> 01:51:59,240
I don't know.

2359
01:51:59,240 --> 01:52:00,240
Batman related stuff.

2360
01:52:00,240 --> 01:52:01,240
Something.

2361
01:52:01,240 --> 01:52:05,240
I'd find my little corner of it and I'd get real weird with it.

2362
01:52:05,240 --> 01:52:09,240
And I'd make a nonprofit and draw people in to meet me.

2363
01:52:09,240 --> 01:52:10,240
That's right.

2364
01:52:10,240 --> 01:52:14,240
And then I'd trap them and they'd be with me and not the other two guys.

2365
01:52:14,240 --> 01:52:18,240
And I'd become the console to somewhere.

2366
01:52:18,240 --> 01:52:20,240
And I'd get four dogs.

2367
01:52:22,240 --> 01:52:24,240
The console to Blue's planet perhaps.

2368
01:52:24,240 --> 01:52:25,240
Oh yeah.

2369
01:52:25,240 --> 01:52:26,240
Hey Blue, we're wrapping up.

2370
01:52:26,240 --> 01:52:28,240
Do you want to say goodbye to the folks really quick?

2371
01:52:28,240 --> 01:52:30,240
One more check in with Blue32.

2372
01:52:30,240 --> 01:52:31,240
Oh yeah.

2373
01:52:31,240 --> 01:52:32,240
Where did I throw...

2374
01:52:32,240 --> 01:52:33,240
Oh he's in here.

2375
01:52:33,240 --> 01:52:34,240
Back in his box.

2376
01:52:34,240 --> 01:52:37,240
Oh man, and he wants Jason to work him.

2377
01:52:40,240 --> 01:52:41,240
Oh yeah, yeah.

2378
01:52:41,240 --> 01:52:42,240
Okay.

2379
01:52:42,240 --> 01:52:43,240
Shrek again.

2380
01:52:43,240 --> 01:52:44,240
He was just asking for Jason.

2381
01:52:44,240 --> 01:52:45,240
I don't know.

2382
01:52:45,240 --> 01:52:46,240
Oh he's back.

2383
01:52:46,240 --> 01:52:47,240
Oh there.

2384
01:52:47,240 --> 01:52:48,240
Yeah he's good.

2385
01:52:48,240 --> 01:52:50,240
Does Blue have a goodbye from us with Jason's voice now?

2386
01:52:50,240 --> 01:52:51,240
Oh yeah.

2387
01:52:51,240 --> 01:52:52,240
Let's hear it.

2388
01:52:52,240 --> 01:52:53,240
Hey everybody.

2389
01:52:55,240 --> 01:52:57,240
Thanks for coming out to the show.

2390
01:52:57,240 --> 01:52:59,240
Oh he wants Scott to work him.

2391
01:53:05,240 --> 01:53:08,240
Ohana means family.

2392
01:53:11,240 --> 01:53:13,240
There's something I actually want to do.

2393
01:53:13,240 --> 01:53:20,240
The only way that we can truly end the night on a note of love and close the time loop

2394
01:53:20,240 --> 01:53:22,240
and fix all the stuff with the dads.

2395
01:53:22,240 --> 01:53:31,240
The only way is if one of you guys, if one of your dads that I was friends with is actually here.

2396
01:53:31,240 --> 01:53:33,240
And I could give them a big hug.

2397
01:53:33,240 --> 01:53:34,240
Hug.

2398
01:53:34,240 --> 01:53:35,240
Is that possible?

2399
01:53:35,240 --> 01:53:37,240
Is somebody, is one of the boys' dads...

2400
01:53:37,240 --> 01:53:39,240
Is one of the people on stage available?

2401
01:53:39,240 --> 01:53:40,240
Is he here?

2402
01:53:40,240 --> 01:53:41,240
Is he here?

2403
01:53:41,240 --> 01:53:43,240
Is maybe my father here?

2404
01:53:43,240 --> 01:53:44,240
Oh my god.

2405
01:53:44,240 --> 01:53:45,240
It's a miracle.

2406
01:53:45,240 --> 01:53:46,240
It's one of the dads.

2407
01:53:46,240 --> 01:53:47,240
Whoa.

2408
01:53:47,240 --> 01:53:48,240
What?

2409
01:53:48,240 --> 01:53:49,240
It can't be Kent.

2410
01:53:49,240 --> 01:53:50,240
He's watching back in California.

2411
01:53:50,240 --> 01:53:51,240
Who is that?

2412
01:53:51,240 --> 01:53:52,240
My eyes.

2413
01:53:52,240 --> 01:53:53,240
I don't see so good.

2414
01:53:53,240 --> 01:53:54,240
My eyes are flopping.

2415
01:53:54,240 --> 01:53:55,240
Is that Mr. Carlson?

2416
01:53:55,240 --> 01:53:56,240
Whoa.

2417
01:53:56,240 --> 01:53:57,240
Oh.

2418
01:53:57,240 --> 01:53:58,240
Oh.

2419
01:53:58,240 --> 01:53:59,240
Oh.

2420
01:53:59,240 --> 01:54:00,240
Oh.

2421
01:54:00,240 --> 01:54:01,240
Oh.

2422
01:54:01,240 --> 01:54:02,240
Oh.

2423
01:54:02,240 --> 01:54:03,240
Oh.

2424
01:54:03,240 --> 01:54:04,240
Oh.

2425
01:54:04,240 --> 01:54:05,240
Oh.

2426
01:54:05,240 --> 01:54:06,240
Oh.

2427
01:54:06,240 --> 01:54:07,240
Oh.

2428
01:54:07,240 --> 01:54:08,240
Oh.

2429
01:54:08,240 --> 01:54:09,240
Oh.

2430
01:54:09,240 --> 01:54:10,240
Oh.

2431
01:54:10,240 --> 01:54:11,240
Oh.

2432
01:54:11,240 --> 01:54:12,240
Oh.

2433
01:54:12,240 --> 01:54:13,240
Oh.

2434
01:54:13,240 --> 01:54:14,240
You guys.

2435
01:54:14,240 --> 01:54:15,240
Oh my god.

2436
01:54:15,240 --> 01:54:16,240
It's been so long.

2437
01:54:16,240 --> 01:54:17,240
It's so good to see you.

2438
01:54:17,240 --> 01:54:18,240
Give me a big hug.

2439
01:54:18,240 --> 01:54:19,240
Oh.

2440
01:54:19,240 --> 01:54:20,240
Oh.

2441
01:54:20,240 --> 01:54:21,240
It's time to...

2442
01:54:21,240 --> 01:54:22,240
Wow.

2443
01:54:22,240 --> 01:54:23,240
Hey.

2444
01:54:23,240 --> 01:54:25,520
Now it's all good.

2445
01:54:25,520 --> 01:54:26,820
Maybe a quick smooch too?

2446
01:54:26,820 --> 01:54:27,820
Thank you.

2447
01:54:27,820 --> 01:54:28,820
Wow.

2448
01:54:28,820 --> 01:54:29,820
Thanks, Mr. Carlson.

2449
01:54:29,820 --> 01:54:30,820
Wait, wait, wait.

2450
01:54:30,820 --> 01:54:31,820
Give a hand for my father.

2451
01:54:31,820 --> 01:54:32,820
Be careful.

2452
01:54:32,820 --> 01:54:33,820
Don't fall down the stairs.

2453
01:54:33,820 --> 01:54:34,820
You guys got to hug too.

2454
01:54:34,820 --> 01:54:35,820
Hug.

2455
01:54:35,820 --> 01:54:36,820
Hug.

2456
01:54:37,400 --> 01:54:40,400
You got a thumbs up.

2457
01:54:40,400 --> 01:54:41,400
Yeah.

2458
01:54:41,400 --> 01:54:42,400
He's getting out of here.

2459
01:54:42,400 --> 01:54:43,400
Wow.

2460
01:54:43,400 --> 01:54:47,680
He did not want to be part of Boys World.

2461
01:54:47,680 --> 01:54:49,160
Now everything is fine.

2462
01:54:49,160 --> 01:54:51,000
Now the time loops is sealed.

2463
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:56,480
I hugged the dad and that means we can all go forth into the world and everything will

2464
01:54:56,480 --> 01:54:57,600
be right.

2465
01:54:57,600 --> 01:55:00,320
You survived Podcast the Rides.

Wow.

2469
01:55:05,980 --> 01:55:10,980
The eye, yeah.

2470
01:55:10,980 --> 01:55:13,980
All glory to the eye.

2471
01:55:13,980 --> 01:55:14,980
Hail the...

2472
01:55:14,980 --> 01:55:15,980
I'll hail the eye.

2473
01:55:15,980 --> 01:55:18,980
I'm going to lick the sticky part of the eye.

2474
01:55:18,980 --> 01:55:21,980
Num num num num num num num num num num.

2475
01:55:21,980 --> 01:55:24,980

Thank you for having me.

2484
01:55:36,300 --> 01:55:37,300
This is a dream.

2485
01:55:37,300 --> 01:55:38,300
I guess through my life.

2486
01:55:38,300 --> 01:55:39,300
So happy to have you.

Thanks to my dad.

2492
01:55:44,300 --> 01:55:45,300
And especially, hey, you know what?

2493
01:55:45,300 --> 01:55:46,300
We did the ultimate theme park thing.

2494
01:55:46,300 --> 01:55:47,300
We embarrassed a dad.

2495
01:55:47,300 --> 01:55:48,300
That's right.

2496
01:55:48,300 --> 01:55:49,300
Wow.

2497
01:55:49,300 --> 01:55:50,300

Any teens here?
