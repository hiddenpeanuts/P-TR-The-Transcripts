1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,840
Forever.

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:03,680
Dog.

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,760
Warning, the following podcasts may contain

4
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:12,240
heavy hair helmets, grown men posing as five year old girls

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,760
and snouts filled with snot.

6
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:18,120
Disney Princess Training Program graduate Amanda Lunn

7
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,280
joins us.

8
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:21,520
Beware of pansy dads.

9
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,280
We're talking Disney Princesses on podcast The Ride.

10
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:29,780
["Princess Meets and Greet's Theme Song"]

11
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,800
Welcome to podcast The Ride hosted by three guys

12
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,580
who do go to Disneyland by themselves,

13
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:54,780
but I swear do not do princess meet and greets

14
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:57,740
by themselves, although I don't wanna make an assumption

15
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:58,660
about you guys.

16
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:00,460
I'm Scott Gardner, Mike Carlson.

17
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:01,280
Raised a finger.

18
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,900
I'm Mike Carlson and I have never, yeah, solo gone

19
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:04,920
and met a princess.

20
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,380
Other characters, 100%.

21
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:09,100
But not a princess.

22
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:12,040
I think seeing a human face is a little too much.

23
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:14,120
I couldn't deal with it and I don't want them judging me.

24
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,340
But like if it's Eeyore's face, I can't tell

25
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:17,980
what the performer is thinking about me.

26
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:20,780
You can't see their perpetual pout and disgust

27
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:23,300
with you as single man wanting to meet them.

28
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:25,820
Jason Sheridan, is this true of you?

29
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:26,660
Yes, that is true.

30
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:27,900
Much respect, much respect.

31
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:30,380
But no, not usually one of my go-to.

32
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:32,980
Shouldn't throw shade at anybody who wants to do it.

33
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:34,900
Just to have my questions.

34
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:38,940
Yes, we at least solo have not had a ton of experience

35
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:40,700
with the Disney Princess meet and greets,

36
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:44,360
but we're joined today by somebody who has lived it,

37
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,980
who's lived it internationally even.

38
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:48,700
She is a writer and a podcaster

39
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:50,300
from The Big Ones, her podcast.

40
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:51,780
Amanda Lund is here.

41
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,580
Thank you so much for having me.

42
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:54,420
Thank you for coming.

43
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:55,980
Thanks for coming, appreciate it.

44
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:58,220
No, I love talking about this stuff.

45
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:01,700
Oh boy, well and there is a ton to talk about, clearly.

46
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:04,940
A pretty tenured career, it would seem.

47
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:06,700
Yeah, definitely.

48
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:11,700
I was a princess at Disneyland and California Adventure

49
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:15,780
for probably six, seven years, I think,

50
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:20,780
from 2001, 2002 to 2008.

51
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,700
Wow, wow, geez, Alanta.

52
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:27,260
And then, were you exclusively that?

53
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:28,820
Were you doing other jobs in the meantime,

54
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:31,140
or just pursuing acting and stuff?

55
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:33,500
Well, I started, I got the job when I was in high school.

56
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,780
So I'm from Southern California.

57
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:39,220
I think so, end of my sophomore year,

58
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:42,140
I started working at Disney, when I turned,

59
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:44,860
I think I was 17 when I started working there.

60
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:46,140
You were that young, wow.

61
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:48,180
Yeah, definitely, yeah.

62
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:51,220
Wow, and I guess within the princess world,

63
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:53,380
that's the desire, I guess,

64
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:56,620
because they sort of, I was looking into qualifications

65
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:59,780
for this program, for being part of it,

66
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:02,260
and there is sort of an age cut off,

67
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:04,260
a little bit loosely, it would seem.

68
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:07,380
Like, 27, they say, is sort of.

69
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:09,020
He seems right, if you think about it,

70
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:11,060
because in the movies, I mean,

71
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:13,980
I think Princess Aurora is maybe 14?

72
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,460
Are you so sure?

73
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:18,180
Yeah, they're all, I feel like they're all younger

74
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,020
than you think.

75
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:24,020
I think Cinderella is 16, and Ariel, I think, is 16.

76
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,460
It's so funny, because seeing the movies as a child,

77
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:29,540
I was like, well, they all must be 30 years old.

78
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:31,020
Of course, must be that old.

79
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:33,580
They have this much responsibility, surely.

80
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,260
Well, they're all getting married.

81
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,820
Right, yeah, that's true.

82
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:41,300
I guess the laws in all the fairy tale kingdoms

83
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:42,740
are different, I suppose.

84
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:47,580
Straight, okay, so yeah, you entered this in high school.

85
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:50,020
Were you Orange County, or did you have to commute away?

86
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:52,460
Yeah, so I'm from Long Beach,

87
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:54,620
and Long Beach is technically LA County,

88
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:58,580
but it was probably a 25 minute, 20 minute drive

89
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:03,220
to Anaheim to go to Disneyland, so it wasn't bad.

90
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:06,380
And so I was, growing up, I had a season pass,

91
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:08,620
and I would just go to theme parks all the time,

92
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:10,220
and I had one of my best friends,

93
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:11,580
her older sister worked there,

94
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,940
and she would always see the princesses,

95
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:16,940
and they would have post flyers for open calls.

96
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:19,660
So she was like, Amanda, you should audition to do this.

97
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:22,940
Right, right, gotcha, huh, huh.

98
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:27,420
And then, was it part of a big cattle call,

99
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:29,740
or are they doing it sort of perpetually?

100
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:30,980
Yeah, I feel like they maybe auditioned

101
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:34,380
a couple times a year, but it was definitely a cattle call.

102
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:37,220
It was like a two or three day process.

103
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:38,620
Geez, wow, wow.

104
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:41,460
Could you estimate the amount of people on the way in?

105
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:43,340
I mean, I think like a couple hundred.

106
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:44,180
Yeah.

107
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:45,260
Probably.

108
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:47,620
Do you remember the mood of it?

109
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:52,180
Because I feel like that's the job that's very sought after.

110
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:55,420
I think other guests have talked about how that is

111
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:58,180
an elite status of theme park performer,

112
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:00,620
is the princesses specifically.

113
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:03,700
So is it, do you remember, was it tents in there?

114
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:06,940
Yeah, I mean, I definitely peaked in high school

115
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,260
when I was doing this job.

116
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:10,300
Absolutely.

117
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:15,660
But it was, so they have, the first call is a big open call,

118
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:19,460
and I think it was at some sort of big dance center,

119
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:23,060
in like a big sort of dancey, big open room,

120
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:25,500
and you had like hundreds and hundreds of people,

121
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,780
and it was just like all different types of people,

122
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:30,180
like people who you're like, oh, I could see them,

123
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:31,820
they're like the right age range,

124
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:36,860
like they kind of look like a character maybe I've seen.

125
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:39,460
And then there's just people who are Disney fans,

126
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:42,620
and they're just coming probably for dual purposes,

127
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:45,700
maybe one purpose is that they want a peek behind the curtain,

128
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:48,340
and then I think another is that they think

129
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:51,220
maybe they could get the job or some sort of job.

130
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:54,060
So you just have all sorts of people at these open calls,

131
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:58,740
and like everyone is just so excited to be there.

132
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:01,820
Because it must be like maximum chipperness,

133
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:06,260
like 300 princess types all in one room together.

134
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:08,180
But they're not all princess types,

135
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:10,300
like some people are just like, I mean,

136
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,820
just Disney fans who come from all over to like,

137
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:15,060
just I don't really know what their intention is.

138
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:17,260
But it's crazy because the first thing they do

139
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:19,900
is they bring you in in groups of I think 20 or 30,

140
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:21,820
and they line you up in sort of a grid,

141
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:25,420
so it's like, be like four rows of 10.

142
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:27,460
And they just, whoever it is,

143
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:30,180
it's usually three or four people running the audition,

144
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:31,100
and they're all like, you can tell

145
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,740
they used to be face characters,

146
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:35,180
and now they've kind of graduated to management.

147
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:36,180
And they just come up to you,

148
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,780
and they get really close to your face,

149
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:39,580
and they look at you, and they just go,

150
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:41,700
hi, how are you doing today?

151
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,980
And you just say, I'm good, thanks,

152
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:45,900
and you stand there smiling,

153
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,980
and then they cut 90% of the people.

154
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:50,700
Just from that.

155
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:53,100
Wow, it's like Miss America, right?

156
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,660
Where they cut like 40 of the contestants immediately

157
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:56,500
or something, right?

158
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,340
Isn't that what they do?

159
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:59,900
I haven't really watched pageants.

160
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,780
I don't know, my mom's a big pageant guy.

161
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:03,620
You follow?

162
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:06,460
Look, my mom made us watch Miss America

163
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:07,900
when we were really younger.

164
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:08,740
She did?

165
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:10,860
Yeah, she loved it, I guess, for whatever reason.

166
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,340
It was an event, our high school band

167
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:15,020
would play at it pretty regularly.

168
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:16,460
Play at the Miss America matches?

169
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:17,660
It was in Atlantic City,

170
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:20,180
because it's only two hours away, hour and a half drive.

171
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:22,100
Wait, you're on the stage in the?

172
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:22,940
You were playing.

173
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:23,780
I wasn't playing.

174
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:24,620
Oh, okay, okay.

175
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,420
Friends in the band would go down and play.

176
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:27,260
That's wild.

177
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:28,180
I mean, I definitely think there is

178
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:31,580
some Disney princess pageant girl crossover.

179
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:32,900
Sure, sure. That's for sure.

180
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,340
That makes sense.

181
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:37,700
Going into it, was it a thing you were like,

182
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,340
oh, I would do that, or were you like,

183
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:43,180
no, that is cool, I'm very excited about this?

184
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:45,740
I was just like, oh, I need to get a job.

185
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:46,980
This is something I could do.

186
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:49,300
I was a dancer, I always did ballet,

187
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:51,980
so I knew there was some dancing involved,

188
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:53,660
and I was like, oh, this could be fun.

189
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:57,100
I kind of had an interest in performing.

190
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,340
I was a Disney fan.

191
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:00,180
I grew up watching all the movies,

192
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:02,100
and I loved going to the theme park.

193
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:05,180
Also, a couple of my girlfriends worked at downtown Disney,

194
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:06,700
some of my best friends, so I was like,

195
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,060
oh, they're working at Disney.

196
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:10,140
They were at the Jazz Kitchen.

197
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:10,980
Sure, it'll work.

198
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:12,620
Being hostesses.

199
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:15,020
And so I just thought, oh, I'll audition for this,

200
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:18,700
and then yeah, I got it, and it became my life.

201
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,340
Wow, wow.

202
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:23,900
Not to sidetrack, we're heading into an extensive series

203
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:27,580
about downtown Disney in the near future.

204
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:29,540
We're gonna cover it in depth.

205
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:31,460
Do you recall anything specific about though,

206
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:33,940
about your friends and their experiences?

207
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:37,380
Do you think the Jazz Kitchen was a pleasant place to work?

208
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:40,260
Oh, I'm sure, if you want my friend Lauren on the podcast,

209
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:43,420
she has a lot of stories from the Jazz Kitchen.

210
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:46,220
But there was a whole, I mean, a period of my life

211
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:49,780
one summer where I was just like a Jazz Kitchen regular.

212
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:52,820
I was like 19, going to the Jazz Kitchen,

213
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:54,860
being served with my fake ID.

214
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:57,700
We would just go there and then just loiter around

215
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,700
and meet boys at downtown Disney.

216
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:00,900
One time we met these guys,

217
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:03,700
and we were probably like 19, and they were in their 30s,

218
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:06,700
and Anthrax was playing at the House of Blues.

219
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:08,420
Absolutely, yeah.

220
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:09,940
And we were like, we like Anthrax,

221
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:11,180
we had no idea what it was,

222
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:13,740
and we just would like go see concerts with,

223
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:16,540
I mean, it was a whole, I mean, I really,

224
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:18,100
that was my stomping ground.

225
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,620
Regular at the Jazz Kitchen with a fake ID,

226
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:22,340
committing fraud at-

227
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:23,260
Oh my God.

228
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:24,700
In Ralph Brennan's face.

229
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:25,540
Yes.

230
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:29,660
But no, I'm a big fan of all of the downtown Disney's

231
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,260
like around the world.

232
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:32,580
Oh sure, yeah.

233
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:34,220
Which there are a lot of them.

234
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:35,300
I guess, oh sorry.

235
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,340
No, I was just gonna say,

236
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:38,500
was Jazz Kitchen number one of a hangout

237
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,660
as far as did downtown Disney,

238
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:40,660
or were there other, like,

239
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:42,420
was Tortilla Joe's there at the time?

240
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:44,460
Yeah, Tortilla Joe's was there, but we weren't big fans.

241
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:47,220
I mean, we were definitely Jazz Kitchen loyalists.

242
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,060
Right, okay. For sure.

243
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:50,100
That's the one we haven't really done.

244
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,300
I think we have to- I've been there.

245
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:54,820
I've done the quick, I've done the express Jazz Kitchen.

246
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:57,900
I just did it, I just got a sandwich from the express.

247
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:58,740
Okay.

248
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,180
You need the full service.

249
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:01,620
I know, I know, I could do that.

250
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:05,260
Ralph Brennan is one of the acclaimed chefs of New Orleans,

251
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:08,580
but I went for a quick lunch in the restaurant once

252
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:11,460
and had like a fish sandwich

253
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:14,020
that was like filet-o-fish quality.

254
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:15,780
I was like, I'll have to come back

255
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:17,380
and have jambalaya or something.

256
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:19,300
Save it for the series, Jason.

257
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:20,140
I know, I know.

258
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:20,980
It'll come back.

259
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:21,820
It'll come back.

260
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:23,660
I was curious to get any free information.

261
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:24,500
There's a spoiler there.

262
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,900
What you thought of the fish sandwich.

263
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:27,740
Okay.

264
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:31,340
So your dream is to have an excuse to use that as the home,

265
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:33,780
Anaheim as the home base

266
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:36,340
for your high school and college years.

267
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:39,540
And you, okay, so you pass by this bizarre,

268
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:42,420
this facial profiling essentially.

269
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:43,260
Yeah.

270
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:44,100
Very strange.

271
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:47,100
It also seems like there's just a height cutoff.

272
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,740
They have really specific criteria.

273
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,860
Whatever written down, it's okay.

274
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:55,820
Most princesses, five, four to five, seven,

275
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:58,580
and then fairies and Alice and Wendy

276
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:00,420
are all four, 11 to five, two.

277
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:01,380
Yeah, that sounds right.

278
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:04,900
And I'm five, seven, so I was on the tall end.

279
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:07,780
But they would, Princess Aurora could be a little bit taller.

280
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:09,260
I think some of the girls were, they'd make,

281
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:12,940
if you were five, eight, you could sneak in there.

282
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:13,940
Beesomely way.

283
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:14,780
You could slouch or something.

284
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:16,340
Or you could stand up taller.

285
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:17,180
Like you could.

286
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:18,700
I mean, you look, when you're Princess Aurora,

287
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:20,060
you look taller anyway

288
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:23,780
because the bangs are very, they're a feathered bang.

289
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:24,620
Oh, sure.

290
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,700
Isn't there some headpiece also that relates to the?

291
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,420
Yeah, you have a crown.

292
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:30,820
A lot of the princesses, Cinderella,

293
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:35,180
have the feathered sort of 1994 bang.

294
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:37,580
Sure, sure, still.

295
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:38,420
Yes.

296
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:42,780
Okay, so you pass the height requirement.

297
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:43,620
Then what?

298
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:47,020
What's after let me stare at you for a second?

299
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:48,500
What's the next angel step?

300
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,820
So that's the big cut.

301
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:52,540
And then later in the day, if you've made the cut,

302
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:54,860
they have you come back to learn a dance.

303
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:57,980
So it's, you spend maybe an hour

304
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:01,700
being taught very basic choreography.

305
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:04,620
Sort of like anyone who's done like a level one ballet class.

306
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:05,860
I mean, think about that.

307
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:09,500
It's kind of like a step touch, step touch, step twirl,

308
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:14,500
and take a bow and touch your heart and blow a kiss.

309
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,580
And then you have maybe a moment to freestyle

310
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:20,780
where you wave and laugh and put your hands next to your face

311
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:23,620
and raise your shoulders and go like, ah.

312
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:25,340
And you're physicalizing all of this right now

313
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:27,500
and you've still got it clearly.

314
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,420
Oh yeah, that's something you don't forget.

315
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:30,260
Sure, sure.

316
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:31,740
I was born with that.

317
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,900
Seems like it's a lot of risks to that.

318
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:36,700
Like a lot of what you were just doing is like,

319
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:37,820
what would you even call it?

320
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:42,140
What's, I don't know, there's just like wrist fluidity.

321
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:44,660
Yeah, well, it's the wave.

322
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:46,460
It's like nothing you've ever seen

323
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:49,180
unless you've literally seen royalty.

324
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:51,580
And this is how the royals actually wave.

325
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:53,940
Like there was something in the tabloids a while ago

326
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,380
about Queen Elizabeth reprimanding Meghan Markle

327
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:58,580
because her wave was too aggressive.

328
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:00,060
Like you're supposed to do it.

329
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:02,020
It's a very fluid wave.

330
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:07,020
Your hand doesn't face front, so your hand is more tilted

331
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:10,620
and then you move your wrist from the elbow.

332
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:13,140
So it's elbow, elbow, wrist, wrist,

333
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:15,540
touch your heart and blow a kiss.

334
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:16,380
Whoa.

335
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:17,220
Whoa.

336
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:20,620
That will haunt me a kind of bit.

337
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:22,460
It's really upsetting, I know.

338
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:24,260
The first part of it looks like you're just pretending

339
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:25,340
to wash the top of a car.

340
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:26,980
Yes, that's exactly what it is.

341
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:29,060
Cause if you think about it, when you're waving,

342
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:30,220
you might be on a float.

343
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:32,780
So you're looking down at your subjects.

344
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:34,420
And then if you were gonna wave at someone

345
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:37,220
in close proximity, like if I were passing you in the park,

346
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:38,060
I wouldn't do this.

347
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:41,180
I'm putting my hand out and kind of waving it crazily.

348
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:43,380
It's like this, like, tee tee tee.

349
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:44,220
Oh.

350
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:45,660
Which is like a little finger wave, tee tee tee.

351
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,580
Which as I'm watching you do this,

352
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:50,540
it occurs to me maybe the more aggressive wave

353
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:52,540
would not photograph well.

354
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:55,340
Maybe some of that maybe with Royals and Disney Royals,

355
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:58,140
it's something about like, it's slower so that you're,

356
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:01,500
there's no strobing or blur.

357
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,340
Exactly.

358
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:04,260
And you know about the point, right?

359
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,540
You never direct someone with a one finger point.

360
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:07,380
No, no, no, I don't.

361
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,500
Oh, okay, so all employees at Disney know this.

362
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,860
You never would point with one finger.

363
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:12,300
Like the restrooms are over there.

364
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,020
It's always the two finger point.

365
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:14,860
Oh.

366
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:15,700
It's less aggressive.

367
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:16,540
Yeah, it's less aggressive.

368
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:17,380
Yeah.

369
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:18,220
Interesting.

370
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:19,780
Huh, huh, just relieves the pressure.

371
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:21,460
Two fingers are like the full hand.

372
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:24,020
Like anything that's not, Walt just didn't like

373
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:26,860
an accusatory point.

374
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:29,060
Oh, which yeah, that feels extremely familiar.

375
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:30,980
As soon as you switch to the two,

376
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:33,900
I flash to like a hundred of those I've seen

377
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,540
in my park going career.

378
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:36,380
Right.

379
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:37,460
Huh, huh, makes sense.

380
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:40,540
So yeah, there's a dance audition

381
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:42,180
and then I think that was all for the first day.

382
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:44,340
They make another big cut after that

383
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:46,300
and then they bring you back the next day

384
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,780
and that's when you have to tell a story

385
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:51,980
and then do a little improv interaction

386
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:54,220
where you talk to a grown man as though,

387
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:56,660
who's role playing a five year old girl.

388
00:14:58,140 --> 00:14:58,980
Okay.

389
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:01,140
Yeah, and then if you can make it through that,

390
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:02,780
then you get to come back the next day

391
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:04,980
where I think they put you,

392
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:07,460
you have to do like almost like a media.

393
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:09,340
Oh no, that was once you get into princess training,

394
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:10,180
which is a whole thing.

395
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:11,820
So then I think then they cast after you have

396
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,500
the interaction with the grown man

397
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,940
and pretending to be the little girl.

398
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:17,020
Wow, are these things all just happening

399
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:21,340
in sort of weird, undecorated back rooms somewhere?

400
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:22,620
Strange.

401
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:24,900
He's not literally like on his knees

402
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:27,260
and like doing a voice or like really?

403
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,100
He is.

404
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:28,920
Literally.

405
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:29,760
Oh no.

406
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:32,540
I think maybe even literally on his knees.

407
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:34,460
Wow, this sounds hellish.

408
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:37,140
Oh, it is.

409
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:39,460
It's very dystopian.

410
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:40,300
Yeah.

411
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,100
This is the future conservatives wordless have asked.

412
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:42,940
Yes.

413
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:48,620
I don't, but I guess that trains you for just,

414
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:50,660
you know, heights, people being so,

415
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:53,420
but also that like there's gotta be a little bit

416
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:56,900
of dude creepiness at some point in all the,

417
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:58,300
in your interactions.

418
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:59,500
Maybe not, I don't know.

419
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,460
Oh, for sure.

420
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:01,820
Oh yeah, the dads.

421
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:02,660
Okay.

422
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:03,500
Oh yeah.

423
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:06,220
You have to learn how to kind of navigate

424
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:07,380
some of the fathers.

425
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:09,700
Is that in the training or is that something

426
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:12,860
the princesses just discuss amongst themselves later?

427
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:14,940
They train you a little bit for it.

428
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:18,980
Like if you're, you know, people will try and get handsy

429
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:21,540
sometimes like the dads are, you know,

430
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:23,420
it's always the dads.

431
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:25,140
Like coming up and trying to put their hand

432
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:28,500
around your waist and you're not supposed to be photographed.

433
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,700
I mean, you're a married woman.

434
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,540
So when some guy comes up and tries.

435
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:32,380
And you're 15.

436
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:33,860
Yeah.

437
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:34,740
So right.

438
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:37,020
So you always say when a guy tries to take a picture

439
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:38,620
with his arm around your waist, you go,

440
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:41,140
oh, let me teach you how to stand like a prince.

441
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:43,060
And then you fold his arms in front of him

442
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:45,780
and then put loop your hand through his arm.

443
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:47,300
Right. Right, right, right.

444
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:51,260
Oh, so if anybody's listening and has been told that.

445
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,100
Yeah, you're a great.

446
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,220
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

447
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,540
Face it, pal.

448
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:56,460
You need some hand training yourself.

449
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:57,300
Yeah.

450
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:58,180
Watch the wrist.

451
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:00,220
I did a little pre-research about this

452
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:02,580
and learned this from a WikiHow article

453
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:04,020
on how to be a Disney princess.

454
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:05,740
Of course the best place to learn stuff

455
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:07,460
and see wonderful drawings.

456
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:08,300
Oh.

457
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:10,820
This is the, watch out for the dads.

458
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,340
They're so creepy.

459
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:15,180
This is so scary.

460
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:17,340
It's sort of a Goofus and Gallant type,

461
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:20,740
like you're showing us diagrams of a,

462
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,540
that what you just showed us a bald man

463
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:25,340
angrily pointing at a Cinderella-esque woman.

464
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:27,860
And a brunette Cinderella, which is.

465
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:28,700
Maybe to get them.

466
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,500
Well, you know, copyright free.

467
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:33,820
There's other stuff in here like learn the requirements,

468
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:36,940
schedule your audition, attend your audition.

469
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:39,140
This is the picture for attend your audition.

470
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:40,980
It is a woman being signed in

471
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:43,180
by what appears to be a Frenchman.

472
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:44,980
He looks like young Waltz.

473
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:45,820
Like, he does look like young Waltz.

474
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:47,020
He looks like young Waltz in Europe.

475
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:48,900
And he's got like a Newsy hat.

476
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,300
Yeah.

477
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:51,460
Let's see.

478
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:52,300
We have to post a lot of these.

479
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,180
Oh, don't talk about Disney protocol.

480
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:55,500
We're breaking that today.

481
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,820
Oh, I know.

482
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:58,140
You're not on the clock anymore.

483
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:59,860
No, I think I'm in the clear.

484
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:03,060
You don't sign any agreement that says never.

485
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:06,420
You do sign something, but I, you know,

486
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:07,260
I'm not worried about it.

487
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:10,300
Have you done a one person show about this?

488
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,420
That's funny you say that because my senior thesis

489
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:15,980
in college was I wrote a one woman show about this,

490
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:17,460
but I never performed it.

491
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:18,300
I just wrote it.

492
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,140
Okay.

493
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:19,980
Yeah.

494
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:21,380
But I know there's part of me that knows someday

495
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:23,940
I need to like do something with this experience.

496
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:26,620
I mean, I did, Matt Gorley, who was on your podcast

497
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:28,820
is my husband and we met at a theme park.

498
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:30,620
We both worked at Disney at the same time,

499
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:34,260
but never met, although I'm sure our paths crossed,

500
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:36,700
but we, it's such a big place that you could work there

501
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:39,180
and never, you know, you'll only kind of stay

502
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:43,060
with your little group, but anyway, we wrote a show about it,

503
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:46,740
a pilot about it for Fox, but it didn't get picked up.

504
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:47,580
Oh, gotcha.

505
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:49,540
But yeah, eventually I want to do something with it.

506
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:51,340
I just have so many stories.

507
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:52,180
Yeah.

508
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:53,700
You know, he was saying by the time,

509
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:56,100
when you guys actually met, am I getting this right,

510
00:18:56,100 --> 00:19:00,740
that it was a Universal Studios, like British street

511
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:03,820
rock urchin sort of experience.

512
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:06,500
Yeah, that was like an ill fated test they were doing.

513
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:08,180
Over at Universal.

514
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:10,220
Jason's guest, I recall, was,

515
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:12,940
oh, you wanted the like New Yorker in the window people

516
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:14,820
and like, no, no, no, there were British people

517
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,780
in the window for a little while

518
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,540
in the little British area.

519
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,940
And you, wait, were you, he described you

520
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:23,940
as being sort of like Spice Girl-esque?

521
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:25,220
Well, when I first got the job,

522
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:28,140
I was playing like a fancy lady who was drinking tea

523
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:29,700
and then they were like, this isn't working,

524
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,860
so we're gonna give the guy a guitar

525
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:35,780
and make him like a rock star and then you get drumsticks

526
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:38,140
and you're gonna sing while he plays the guitar.

527
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:41,900
And I was like, okay, I mean, I have the worst voice

528
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:44,260
and I've never sung publicly in my life,

529
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:48,660
but I was at Universal mic'd improvising songs

530
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,900
and I was just like, this is what I do.

531
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:55,500
Change, but found your life partner with Ru

532
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,780
during horrible singing.

533
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:58,940
It was a lot.

534
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:01,420
Singing doesn't come into play in Princess,

535
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:02,740
not that you're in shows, I guess.

536
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:04,780
Yeah, in fact, so the interesting thing

537
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:07,100
about being a princess is while it is,

538
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:09,620
it sounds like a really cool job,

539
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:11,620
you're actually non-union.

540
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:14,540
So there's the performers union called AGVA,

541
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:18,860
which is the representation for all of theme park employees,

542
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:21,860
which was actually started as a union for strippers

543
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:23,300
and circus performers,

544
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,740
and now it's the theme park employee union.

545
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:27,940
Oh yeah, yeah, we got into this a little,

546
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:29,380
cause in Florida recently,

547
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:32,220
the costume characters are in the Teamsters.

548
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:34,740
And James Hoffa, son of Jimmy Hoffa,

549
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:38,740
had to come down and clean up the local in Orlando.

550
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:42,300
But then some people are equity in Florida.

551
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:45,340
Right, but okay, so the princesses,

552
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:46,900
what you know is the face characters

553
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:50,580
and the parade princesses, none of them are union,

554
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:52,340
which means you cannot sing,

555
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:54,740
you can't be mic'd in a show.

556
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:57,340
So then if you ever see a princess

557
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:59,620
who's singing with a mic, she's union,

558
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:01,620
which means she's not really probably

559
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:03,900
an official face character.

560
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:07,100
She's like a performer portraying Cinderella

561
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,260
or a performer portraying Belle.

562
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:11,980
If you see the Beauty and the Beast live show,

563
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:15,500
that is not somebody moved from the princess program

564
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,420
into the show, they hire separately.

565
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:19,860
Right, which means the flip side of that is like,

566
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:23,300
while we're working twice as much as most of the AGVAs,

567
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:26,220
the union performers, we're getting paid half

568
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:27,980
of what they're getting paid.

569
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:32,620
So where the union performers would maybe work 25 minutes

570
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:34,380
and then have like a half hour break,

571
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:36,860
we're working 45 minutes with a 15 minute break

572
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:39,820
and getting paid, I think I was getting paid $14 an hour

573
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:41,740
while they're making like 25 an hour.

574
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:45,700
Oh my God, much like the Disney princesses in the films,

575
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:50,700
various degrees of subjugation and being limited

576
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:54,820
by the, in this case, Triton is the corporate overlord

577
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:56,460
of Disney in Toronto.

578
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:59,260
Or the Wicked Stepsisters, the same thing.

579
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:01,620
Yeah, yeah, I guess so, yeah, holding you down.

580
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:04,500
With the characters, and I just saw this,

581
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,980
did everyone see this, there's like an evil queen

582
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:09,380
at Disneyland that's gone viral, is this?

583
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:11,220
Oh no. I did just watch this last night.

584
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:12,620
What's she up to?

585
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:15,980
She's just, she's very good, she's in character

586
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:18,500
just kind of roaming around and telling little kids

587
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:21,140
to straighten up or whatever and it's like people.

588
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:26,140
She consistently refers to your phone as a mirror,

589
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:28,260
like all she knows is mirrors,

590
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:31,660
so which I kind of like that terminology.

591
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:33,860
That's fun, and then like a couple years ago,

592
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:36,700
Gaston, especially in, I think it's only in Florida,

593
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:39,340
honestly, he was doing pushups and like,

594
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:43,460
is that another tier performer or are they face characters?

595
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:44,780
They're face characters.

596
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:45,620
Okay.

597
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:47,260
Yeah, so some of them are really good,

598
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:49,180
but yeah, it's not, as far as I know,

599
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:51,340
at least when I was there, they were all in the same tier

600
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:52,300
as the princesses.

601
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,140
Okay, gotcha.

602
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:54,540
I wonder if there's the pressure today

603
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:55,860
to try to go viral.

604
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:57,340
Get a viral moment.

605
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:58,860
That's funny, I bet there is.

606
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:01,660
I mean, I was working there before iPhones,

607
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:04,460
so camera phones, there were camera phones,

608
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:07,740
but it wasn't like how it is today, so.

609
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:10,180
Yeah, like for sure, if you were walking around today,

610
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:12,460
there'd be like dozens of videos of you,

611
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:15,300
but yeah, is there evidence of that?

612
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:18,420
Did you ever like make a point of documenting?

613
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:21,100
Well, part of the job is like, it's all about pictures,

614
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:23,620
so yeah, I have tons and tons of photos.

615
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:28,540
Yeah, and just, I mean, not as much of my own photos,

616
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:29,540
but we would always like,

617
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:31,460
I would find some photos of myself online,

618
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:34,340
and then occasionally you'd have fans who come

619
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:37,580
and they would give you a big stack of your photos.

620
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:39,340
Whoa. Like heart regulars.

621
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:40,580
Wow. Who would, yeah,

622
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:45,260
kind of know all the different princesses and yeah.

623
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:46,900
Do you have those?

624
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:47,740
The photos? Yeah.

625
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:48,820
Oh yeah. You copped all of,

626
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:50,180
like you have like a,

627
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:52,420
they would bring a photo album to you

628
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:55,100
of you and them in many pictures?

629
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,980
Yes, or just candid of you like walking around.

630
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:59,180
Oh, okay.

631
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:01,900
Yeah, no, it's a whole thing, the fans,

632
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:04,380
is a whole sort of crazy thing.

633
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:07,940
Especially I worked in Tokyo Disney too,

634
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:11,060
and that's like beyond the fans there.

635
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:13,380
Geez, sure, sure. It's wild.

636
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:17,420
Did they, like they don't know your real name,

637
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:19,380
so they're just sort of classifying you,

638
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:22,740
but like, oh, you're, it's that Cinderella or whatever.

639
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:26,860
Yeah, we had one guy who would give us all nicknames.

640
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:28,540
Oh boy. So mine was Rookie,

641
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:29,660
cause I was new.

642
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:31,500
Oh no. And so yeah.

643
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,020
It's also like nagging you.

644
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:35,060
Yeah, it was a little nagging.

645
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:35,940
Yeah.

646
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:36,780
Geez.

647
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:39,260
Also becomes inaccurate at a certain point.

648
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:40,460
That's true, that is true.

649
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:42,420
You're no longer new, you just are.

650
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:45,300
And he's probably recycled that name too.

651
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,620
I would assume.

652
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:48,540
You know, that's not the first Rookie

653
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:49,980
that he's named.

654
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:52,500
No. What's going on in Japan?

655
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,940
How is it different in Japan?

656
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:56,700
I mean, I loved Tokyo Disney.

657
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:57,860
Have any of you guys been?

658
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:59,700
Yeah, Scott and I have gone.

659
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,820
We've been in love, like,

660
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:04,620
just still in the throes of love with the place

661
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:05,940
ever since we got back. It's so amazing.

662
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:06,780
Yeah, yeah.

663
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:07,860
And you went to Tokyo Disney Sea.

664
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:09,300
I'm sure you covered it all in this podcast.

665
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:11,900
Yeah, the longest episode.

666
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:15,900
We each did one that we're just like bursting at the seams.

667
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:17,500
There's too much, there's too much.

668
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:18,340
It's so good.

669
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:22,860
But yeah, being a fan is like a big part of Japanese culture.

670
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:25,580
It's like a lot of people are fans of various things

671
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:27,220
and they go all out.

672
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:32,220
I mean, whether it's baseball or like the Big Bang Theory.

673
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:35,980
It's like they love, and especially with Disney.

674
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:38,100
So yeah, we would have people,

675
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:40,740
I mean, that would be seemingly their full-time job

676
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:41,780
is they come to the park,

677
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:44,140
you'd see the same people every day

678
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:46,180
and they would take pictures of you

679
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:48,380
and they'd kind of decide on one of,

680
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,700
because you would go out on an eight-month contract,

681
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:53,500
or I think it was a six or seven-month contract,

682
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,220
and they would know when the new batch

683
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,020
of face characters would come in.

684
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:58,940
So they would kind of pick their favorite

685
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:01,300
and become, this is a negative word,

686
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:03,660
but your stalker in a way.

687
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:05,780
Or they would know where you would go,

688
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:08,300
the bar we'd all go to after work.

689
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:10,820
They would sometimes show up there.

690
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:14,060
One time I was on the train just as myself on a day off,

691
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:17,380
going into the city, and someone just handed me a package

692
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:19,940
and it was a stack of photos of myself.

693
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:22,460
Oh my God, it's like the start of a horror movie.

694
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:25,540
Yeah, and they wait for you outside of work

695
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:28,540
and will kind of walk you to the bus stop.

696
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:31,700
And it's a whole thing, but it's really,

697
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:33,820
you're not really supposed to accept

698
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:35,780
or exchange anything with them,

699
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:37,900
but people do all the time.

700
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,260
And a lot of them were really nice

701
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:42,380
and kind of became, you become friendly with them.

702
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:44,700
But it's this whole fan culture over there

703
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:47,180
that's taken to an extreme.

704
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:48,020
Wow, interesting.

705
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:49,740
Yeah, but it was a great place to work.

706
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:51,140
I loved doing that.

707
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:54,980
Okay, yeah, so you're out for how long then, all told?

708
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:56,820
In a day, so you usually.

709
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:57,860
I just meant like in Japan.

710
00:26:57,860 --> 00:27:00,540
Oh, in Japan, I was there for seven months.

711
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:01,380
Jeez.

712
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:05,180
Which, okay, outside of Disney, how is that?

713
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:07,780
That's where you live for a extended period of time?

714
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:08,620
It was awesome.

715
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:09,900
You got your own little apartment

716
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,620
and I took a year off of college

717
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:13,540
and I went out there and did it.

718
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:14,700
So it was. Oh man, that's a dream.

719
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:17,300
It was my first time living really independently

720
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:18,580
and it was awesome.

721
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:21,140
I think us and a lot of people listening probably,

722
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:23,140
yeah, dream of, yeah, if you could just be there

723
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:24,900
for a long period of time.

724
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:25,740
I know.

725
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:28,500
It was so, like, it's the first vacation I've taken

726
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,700
where I was, since Disney World as a kid,

727
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:34,140
where I was teary-eyed leaving, like on the plane,

728
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:36,220
like, oh no, I don't wanna go.

729
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:38,780
I know, don't you wanna move there and live there for a while?

730
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:39,620
Yeah.

731
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:41,300
I was just looking at pictures like two nights ago,

732
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:43,380
like just going like, oh.

733
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:44,660
I know, I wanna go back.

734
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:47,260
Like, it's the only place I wanna ever travel to.

735
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:48,100
Yeah.

736
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:49,460
I could see that just making the choice, yeah,

737
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:51,380
I take trips to one place and it's here

738
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:53,980
because you'd have a completely different time every time.

739
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:56,740
Yeah, so that was when I was there when I turned 21

740
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:59,300
out there and then a couple of years ago,

741
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:02,700
I went back with Matt and we did the whole Disney thing

742
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:05,500
out there and just traveled around and he loved it too.

743
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:06,940
Oh geez, oh wonderful.

744
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:07,780
Yeah.

745
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:08,740
Where abouts in this?

746
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:11,380
Like in Tokyo proper and some weird outskirts.

747
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:13,260
Yeah, you're kind of, you know how Disneyland's

748
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:15,940
in like a suburb of Tokyo, it's like a 20 minute train ride.

749
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:18,500
So we were in a little suburb of the town where Disney is.

750
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,380
So I forget what it's called, I think it's,

751
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:22,140
oh it's called Shin-Urayasu.

752
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:25,180
So it was about a 10 minute train ride to get to work.

753
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:28,220
Geez, oh, that's easy and efficient

754
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:30,060
and then the job is silly and fun.

755
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:32,580
It's quicker than getting to anywhere,

756
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:34,340
from anywhere to Anaheim.

757
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:35,180
Yes, of course.

758
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:36,300
Like it's such a burden.

759
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:39,380
It was so fun and they put you in this,

760
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:41,380
it's called E-Village, when I lived there,

761
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:42,660
this big apartment complex.

762
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:45,540
So it's all the princesses, all the princes

763
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:48,340
and then you also have all the other people

764
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:50,740
that come in to be workers at Disneyland,

765
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:54,380
like the Polynesian fire throwers and the Mariachi band.

766
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:56,300
So you're living at this apartment complex

767
00:28:56,300 --> 00:29:00,220
with like all these amazing weird performers,

768
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:02,060
like the acrobats, like everyone.

769
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:04,260
So it's like this big diverse place to live

770
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:07,140
and you'd be like, the Mariachis are having a party tonight,

771
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:10,060
let's all go cluster in their little one bedroom apartment

772
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:12,860
and like drink and watch a movie.

773
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:14,820
Wow. Oh my God.

774
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:16,980
Well and getting to go to,

775
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:18,180
if you're gonna live in Tokyo for a while

776
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:21,580
with a like base, a class of English speakers,

777
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:24,700
which must provide so much comfort and ease.

778
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:26,980
So would everyone start at the same time?

779
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:30,460
Was it a total, like was it getting on a cruise?

780
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:32,740
No, you don't have different call times.

781
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:34,700
Like when you got to Tokyo,

782
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:36,140
like you were saying contracts.

783
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:38,020
So was it most people started at the same time?

784
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:39,860
Yeah, everyone would, it would be a full,

785
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:41,660
you'd have like a crossover of two weeks

786
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:43,060
while you were kind of being trained

787
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:44,540
and the other people were like,

788
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:46,260
doing all their paperwork to leave.

789
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:48,180
So you'd have, you'd cross over for two weeks

790
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:50,580
and then you would, yeah, you would take over

791
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:52,340
and it would be like a full new fleet of people.

792
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:54,900
Although a few people would get extended

793
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:57,220
and some people stayed their contract after contract

794
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:59,700
after contract, like if they really liked you,

795
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:01,220
they would extend you.

796
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:03,700
So I don't wanna, if this is a source subject,

797
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:05,940
I'm so sorry, but were you offered an extension?

798
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:07,940
I was not offered an extension.

799
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:09,660
No, no, that's okay.

800
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:10,500
No, I don't think so,

801
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:12,140
because I had to go graduate college.

802
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:12,980
That's fair.

803
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:19,820
Let me ask this,

804
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:21,940
because I've heard stories about how like,

805
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:24,460
even at the domestic parks,

806
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:27,700
there's like the A team and the B team.

807
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:30,900
Like the A team is the one when a celebrity comes

808
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:32,420
or a cherry thing comes.

809
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:35,260
Did you ever get to do anything where it's like?

810
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:36,900
Yeah, that's interesting.

811
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:38,020
And it reminds me of that,

812
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:39,260
I've kind of forgotten about that.

813
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:40,780
But yeah, even at Disneyland,

814
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:43,260
there's definitely kind of, they have their favorites.

815
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:44,100
And so those are the people

816
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:47,620
who get asked to do special events.

817
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:50,020
So yeah, I did those a couple of times,

818
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:50,940
which were kind of fun.

819
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:51,780
Like, oh God, what was,

820
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:55,220
there was some movie, some Disney movie that came out.

821
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:56,100
I forget what it was,

822
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:56,940
but I got to like,

823
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:59,180
they wanted some of the characters on the red carpet.

824
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:00,620
I got to do that.

825
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:02,220
Was it a Pirates?

826
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:03,060
Did they do a Pirates premiere there?

827
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:05,100
Yeah, actually I think it maybe was a Pirates or something.

828
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:06,540
I think they closed off Main Street.

829
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:08,980
Yeah, it was something like that.

830
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:11,900
And then, yeah, you would get to do some special events.

831
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:13,740
One time I got to travel for work,

832
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:15,580
which was exciting to go,

833
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:17,180
well, it sounded exciting at the time,

834
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:21,420
but I had to go to Texas to work in a mall for a day

835
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:23,660
for the opening of a Disney store.

836
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:24,620
Oh, sure.

837
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:26,540
Yeah, and it was exciting for me,

838
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:28,860
because I had never, I was like 17,

839
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:30,180
I had never traveled for work.

840
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:33,620
But yeah, I remember like having to,

841
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:34,700
if you had to go to the bathroom,

842
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:36,620
you had to go to the Lenscrafters.

843
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:38,740
And they used the bathroom,

844
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:42,140
and it was not really glamorous.

845
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:46,140
But yeah, Johnny Depp would come all the time to Disney,

846
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:47,940
and there was like a specific Peter Pan

847
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:49,220
he would always request,

848
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:52,540
and they would have like a private meet and greet.

849
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:55,980
He was with kids or just himself?

850
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:59,900
He would have, I think there were children around as well.

851
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:02,420
Whether they were photo op children or his own,

852
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:03,260
we don't know.

853
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:04,860
Whether Lily was there or not.

854
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:07,820
Yeah, but at the time when I was working there,

855
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:10,940
it was before they put in the whole Princess Fantasy Fair,

856
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:15,380
so which is now the princesses are all in one location.

857
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:17,060
So you can go through a line

858
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:19,260
and hit three or four princesses,

859
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:20,740
and get the autograph from the picture,

860
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:22,460
and then exit through the gift shop,

861
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:24,380
and there's a whole little show that happens.

862
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:27,540
But before Princess Fan Fair, as we called it,

863
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:30,220
we were just roaming around.

864
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:32,300
Like we would just, they were like, you live here,

865
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:35,340
this is your castle, and you just walk around,

866
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:36,820
and then at some point you have to stop,

867
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:38,100
and there's a line.

868
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:39,940
But the line, wherever that was, would change

869
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:41,700
depending on where you wanted to stand,

870
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:44,220
and you had a lot more freedom.

871
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:47,220
If maybe sometimes, if it was toward the end of the day,

872
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:49,140
and you could go on a ride,

873
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:50,900
or you could find one really cute kid

874
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:53,860
and kind of walk around with them for 10 minutes,

875
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:57,340
or play a game, or you could have a lot more freedom.

876
00:32:58,180 --> 00:32:59,260
Unless you worked in dining,

877
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:00,260
which was a whole different thing.

878
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:02,100
But otherwise, if you were just in the park,

879
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:03,460
it was really cool.

880
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:05,100
And now it was this whole thing of like,

881
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,540
they're penning us up,

882
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:08,300
and people just want the autograph.

883
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:10,220
And it's a little bit more,

884
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:12,820
they're just like kind of rubber stamping an experience

885
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:14,820
over and over, you're right, next, next, next.

886
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:17,300
It's interesting, because they're doing that now

887
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:18,820
in the Star Wars land,

888
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:21,860
where there's no characters that are not in a spot.

889
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:24,100
They're roaming, and there's videos of like,

890
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:26,260
Rey playing with a game with a little girl and stuff.

891
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:27,460
Which is so cool.

892
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:30,300
So maybe they're gonna get back to that.

893
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:32,340
But at the time when I was there,

894
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:33,500
and this started when I was a kid,

895
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:34,860
I mean, I had an autograph book.

896
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:36,820
It was like, people wanted to get their money's worth.

897
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:38,700
And they'd be like, I've been at the park all day,

898
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:40,100
and I haven't seen Cinderella.

899
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:42,780
I paid 150 bucks to be here.

900
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:44,300
So then they decided, well,

901
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:46,540
we'll just put Cinderella in a cage,

902
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:48,420
and everyone can take a picture.

903
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:49,260
Oh no.

904
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:50,100
Yeah.

905
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:51,740
Trap Ariel in the sea.

906
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:53,340
I think the wandering characters

907
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:57,740
is more built into Disneyland than Disney World in Florida,

908
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:58,580
from what I've read about it.

909
00:33:58,580 --> 00:33:59,420
Oh, interesting.

910
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:00,260
Maybe, yeah.

911
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:03,100
Where it's, in Florida, they're a lot more planted.

912
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:04,220
So because people were saying like,

913
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:07,540
oh, how will the Galaxy's Edge wandering characters do,

914
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:09,340
how will people like that in Florida,

915
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:12,100
where that's less common than out here?

916
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:14,980
You just walk into Disneyland at any time of the day,

917
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:17,380
and you can stumble upon Mary Poppins,

918
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:19,180
or the Mad Hatter, or like Mickey on Main Street.

919
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:20,020
And they hate it.

920
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:21,020
They've rebelled.

921
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:22,460
They're setting the place on fire.

922
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:23,980
They're setting it on fire.

923
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:25,340
We want them stationary.

924
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:27,220
I would like to take a behind the scenes tour

925
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:28,900
of those Princess Fairy Tailhorses,

926
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,380
because it's like impossible architecture

927
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:33,580
of like the same room multiple times,

928
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:36,980
and like doors where it's set up where like,

929
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:39,860
the two Cinderella's couldn't come out at once,

930
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:41,700
they couldn't meet each other,

931
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:43,940
even if they're doing simultaneous meet and greet.

932
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:49,900
Yeah, you'd have a very delicate schedule

933
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:52,860
that you really had to go out at the correct time,

934
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:53,900
because if you misread,

935
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:55,500
the worst thing that could happen is,

936
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:58,260
you walk to your spot and there's another Cinderella there.

937
00:34:58,260 --> 00:34:59,100
Oh yeah.

938
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:03,740
And then it's just, I mean, that happened to me one time,

939
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:05,380
but there was a story where this,

940
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:08,900
and I played Cinderella in Sleeping Beauty and Ariel.

941
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:09,940
I don't think we said that.

942
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:10,780
Yeah, we haven't said that.

943
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:11,860
So those were your big.

944
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:13,340
Those are my big three.

945
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:14,780
Yeah, pretty big three.

946
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:15,700
Yeah, and then in Tokyo,

947
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:17,740
it was Cinderella and Mary Poppins.

948
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:18,580
Oh, wow.

949
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:21,140
Yeah, so there was this one time

950
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:22,860
when I was walking out to my spot,

951
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:24,580
and I think I had gotten the time wrong

952
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:26,140
or the schedule was wrong, and I walk out,

953
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:27,860
and there's like another Cinderella there,

954
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:30,460
and there was like the fairy godmother there.

955
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:32,220
So she tried, I mean, this is so dumb,

956
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:34,940
but she tried to cover by pretending she had done like,

957
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:36,580
a spell to make two,

958
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:38,620
but then I just had to like run back,

959
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:41,060
and it just like was horrible.

960
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:41,980
I think I cried.

961
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:43,580
I felt like so ashamed.

962
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:46,860
There was a Cinderella straight to DVD movie about time travel.

963
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:49,980
I think it was called a Stitch in Time or something.

964
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:51,860
So you could have just, she could have referred,

965
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:55,620
well, if you've seen the DVD, my DVD or her DVD,

966
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:57,700
time travel is possible.

967
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:00,100
They love the princesses talking about technology.

968
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:02,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah, buy the DVD and Blu-ray.

969
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:06,060
We were talking about, so your characters,

970
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:07,060
when you were auditioning,

971
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:10,340
was there a character specifically you wanted?

972
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:12,420
Did it feel like there was one like superstar character

973
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:13,500
everyone wanted?

974
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:16,620
Yeah, I don't know about any particular character.

975
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:18,380
Cinderella was always my favorite movie,

976
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:21,780
so I think I wanted to do Cinderella.

977
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:23,620
But Ariel was really fun too,

978
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:25,740
just because you get to wear the fin.

979
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:28,940
Well, that's a question also.

980
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:29,980
That's always a weird,

981
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:32,780
how do you place Ariel in the timeline?

982
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:35,740
Is it pre or post transformation?

983
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:36,580
Right.

984
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:38,780
So you were finned Ariel.

985
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:39,980
I was finned Ariel,

986
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:42,940
and then I think maybe three years into working there,

987
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:44,860
it was a huge deal because they were like,

988
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:46,220
we're gonna give her legs.

989
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:48,700
And so then they gave her legs and a dress,

990
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:51,540
and then stuck her in Ariel's grotto.

991
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:52,540
Oh, okay.

992
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:56,500
Wait, and Ariel's grotto being the restaurant

993
00:36:56,500 --> 00:37:00,740
in California Adventure that's now the Lamplight Lounge.

994
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:01,620
Oh, did they change?

995
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:03,140
They took out Ariel's grotto.

996
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:03,980
Yeah.

997
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:07,580
Okay, yeah, so I was there for the opening of Ariel's grotto,

998
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:09,700
and that would be the one place you could go

999
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:10,940
and see all the princesses.

1000
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:13,340
But doing dining, I liked doing Ariel's grotto

1001
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:14,180
because it was easy,

1002
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:17,180
and when I first worked there before she had legs,

1003
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:19,940
they would, you'd have to go to this really scary,

1004
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:24,740
very damp backstage area that had an inch of water

1005
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:25,900
on the floor.

1006
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:27,100
And I don't know if you guys know this, but-

1007
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:27,940
Appropriate?

1008
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:28,780
Yeah.

1009
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:32,660
When you're a princess and you're not in costume backstage,

1010
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:35,620
they give you the old space mountain jumpsuits

1011
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:40,060
that the line operators used to wear back in the 80s.

1012
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:41,700
Those are your coveralls.

1013
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:43,620
So all the princesses are backstage,

1014
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:45,140
at least they used to be when I worked there,

1015
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:48,020
in these blue coveralls and their wigs.

1016
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:48,900
Whoa.

1017
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:51,660
Wait, but then with the gown stuff in there?

1018
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:54,780
You take your gown off and put the coveralls on,

1019
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:56,180
and that would be your lounge wear,

1020
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:59,460
but they were the old space mountain ride operator uniforms.

1021
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:04,220
It's a bunch of astronauts with big updos.

1022
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:05,060
Yes.

1023
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:06,020
You could have done meet and greets

1024
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:08,140
as Ripley from Elegance in that.

1025
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:08,980
Exactly.

1026
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:09,820
There.

1027
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:11,860
A sci-fi princess Ripley.

1028
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:12,700
Yeah.

1029
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:15,540
They were actually, yeah, kind of fun to wear.

1030
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:17,660
But yeah, so backstage behind the grotto

1031
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:20,380
before you had legs, you would go back there,

1032
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:22,780
you'd hop into your tail, and then you'd hop on

1033
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:25,660
and sit on this plastic shiny seahorse,

1034
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:27,300
and then someone would wheel you out

1035
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:29,500
into the lobby of the restaurant,

1036
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:31,780
and that would be, you would just sit there

1037
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:34,980
for like a half hour while people came to be seated

1038
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:39,500
and just be like, hi, welcome to my grotto.

1039
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:40,340
Yeah.

1040
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:41,180
What are you gonna get?

1041
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:42,020
What are you gonna order?

1042
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:43,300
I'm gonna get the specials.

1043
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:44,460
Yeah.

1044
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:45,820
Whoa, strange.

1045
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:48,100
And I liked that job because you got to work alone,

1046
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:50,700
which might sound bad, but I'm kind of an introvert,

1047
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:54,420
so sometimes it was difficult to be in a break room

1048
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:55,980
filled with people.

1049
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:56,820
Oh, okay.

1050
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:57,940
So this was nice because you could just be

1051
00:38:57,940 --> 00:39:01,420
in that scary warehouse.

1052
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:02,420
Bizarre leaking.

1053
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:04,060
Yeah, like bleeding or whatever.

1054
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:05,140
Space suit zone.

1055
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:09,180
Did you do any of the walk around,

1056
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,420
like Goofy's Kitchen buffet, like,

1057
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:13,700
buffet stuff too? Yeah, definitely.

1058
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:16,020
Yeah, and those are odd because you go table to table,

1059
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:19,060
and you think everyone would be there to meet the characters,

1060
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:20,020
but not everyone is.

1061
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:21,980
Some people, it's really like you're intruding

1062
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:23,020
on their meal.

1063
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:24,060
Jeez.

1064
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:25,140
You know, and they'll just be like,

1065
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:26,140
they don't even want a picture.

1066
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:28,660
Like, they just came to eat pancakes,

1067
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:29,980
and they're not interested in you,

1068
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:31,780
but you still have to stop by.

1069
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:34,380
So there's only a handful of breakfast buffets.

1070
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:35,220
Yeah.

1071
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:36,700
If you just wanted a breakfast buffet option.

1072
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:37,540
That's right.

1073
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:39,500
Yeah, I would imagine that there's probably people

1074
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:40,940
that even just, when they're booking in,

1075
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:43,220
it's like character buffet, and they're just like,

1076
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:45,340
yeah, that's characters on the wall or something.

1077
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:47,660
And then they get there, they don't give a shit about

1078
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:49,500
like meeting anyone.

1079
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:52,900
Yeah, do they just, anybody just ask you for coffee refills?

1080
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:54,020
Oh, totally, yeah.

1081
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:55,900
People would just be like, yeah,

1082
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:57,820
asking you questions like that all the time.

1083
00:39:57,820 --> 00:40:00,940
Jeez, you're so, do you, what's the party?

1084
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:03,700
You then have to like politely say,

1085
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:06,060
what is it, just like, well, your server is over?

1086
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:08,580
Not even, you just say like, oh, I'm not sure.

1087
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:10,860
I had breakfast with Mickey this morning, so.

1088
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:12,620
You know.

1089
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:16,100
And then walk on.

1090
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:17,980
Which is insane also, that all the,

1091
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:20,580
that's a way, the fuzzy lines of that all the characters,

1092
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:23,620
regardless of mythology, all live at Disneyland together,

1093
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:27,740
and that Aurora's hanging out with Pluto and Gus Gus,

1094
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:30,340
and it's all a big weird mishmash.

1095
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:31,180
It is.

1096
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:33,140
Is the training for the buffet different?

1097
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:34,340
I'm trying to think now.

1098
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:35,540
The buffet training.

1099
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:36,980
Because I'm trying to think,

1100
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:38,980
when I've done multiple character buffets

1101
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:41,660
in the last few years, the characters,

1102
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:45,500
the costume characters will sometimes like sneak up on you.

1103
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:46,620
Like all of a sudden you'll be eating,

1104
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:49,420
and I'll just feel like something touching me,

1105
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:51,260
and I'll turn and it's Dale.

1106
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:53,100
Yeah, no, they don't train you to do that.

1107
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:55,180
So that just must be that particular Dale.

1108
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:56,020
Okay.

1109
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:57,660
You have these interactions with characters.

1110
00:40:57,660 --> 00:40:59,740
Well, a Minnie kisses me.

1111
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:01,900
Minis kiss me multiple times.

1112
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:03,420
Different Minis, I assume.

1113
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:07,300
So I wonder if they like, yeah, do they say like,

1114
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,620
yeah, just scare the shit out of someone

1115
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:11,100
while they're eating a sausage.

1116
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:13,100
No, that's just boredom.

1117
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:15,580
Boredom breeds trying to mess with people.

1118
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:16,420
Right.

1119
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:18,220
Which is a good question in general,

1120
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:19,660
and Matt talked about this a little,

1121
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:22,620
just getting like, just drifting and like,

1122
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:25,100
oh, what can I do to keep this interesting?

1123
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:26,380
Because you did a number of years.

1124
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:27,220
Yeah.

1125
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:29,700
Were you like, did you push the limits

1126
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:33,460
of what a princess could do just out of your own boredom?

1127
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:34,860
Oh, of course.

1128
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:36,940
I mean, yeah, definitely.

1129
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:40,260
You get to the point where you're like,

1130
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:41,500
I mean, because they watch you,

1131
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:42,340
but when I was there,

1132
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:44,420
they weren't really always watching you that closely.

1133
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:46,140
So you had a lot of autonomy.

1134
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:47,420
So it would be like,

1135
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:48,940
depending on who you were working with,

1136
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:51,340
you're like, let's just do a walking set,

1137
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:53,620
where you just walk the whole time and wave at everyone.

1138
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:54,820
And maybe if you're with a prince,

1139
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:56,260
you stop and do a little dance

1140
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:59,100
or put on some sort of little improvised play.

1141
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:01,260
Just doing stuff like that.

1142
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:02,940
I mean, sometimes you could go on a ride,

1143
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:04,300
which would be really fun.

1144
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:07,180
You'd find some little girl or little boy

1145
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:09,020
and be like, come with me on the storybook ride.

1146
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:10,940
And you'd go up and cut the line

1147
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:12,420
and go on a storybook ride.

1148
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:13,980
And that ate your whole set.

1149
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:14,820
Really?

1150
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:15,660
Oh, that's great.

1151
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:16,540
But then you could also,

1152
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:17,860
there was a chance if you did that,

1153
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:19,620
you could get written up.

1154
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:22,300
Oh, so that was against the rules.

1155
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:23,740
It was kind of ambiguous.

1156
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:24,860
If you got permission,

1157
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:26,540
sometimes they're called leads.

1158
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:28,380
They would be like, okay, the last set of the day,

1159
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:32,220
you can go do this or let's do a game this set.

1160
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:33,940
But then as I worked there,

1161
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:35,220
as it got further along,

1162
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:38,300
they started to not let you do that kind of stuff anymore.

1163
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:40,620
Now they love that stuff going viral.

1164
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:42,580
That's like free marketing for that.

1165
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:44,740
That's all it feels very planned to me.

1166
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:45,580
Sure.

1167
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:46,420
Yeah.

1168
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:48,700
But I mean, the kids freaking out.

1169
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:49,940
There was a few stories recently

1170
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:54,380
of princesses helping calm down very upset children.

1171
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:55,220
Oh, I don't know about that.

1172
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:56,300
I wasn't that.

1173
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:57,860
Yeah, that wasn't a rant.

1174
00:42:57,860 --> 00:42:59,580
I mean, just again, the viral moments

1175
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:00,420
weren't really a thing.

1176
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:01,580
Unless it was something really bad,

1177
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:04,020
like tigger groping someone.

1178
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:07,540
Which would go viral in a different way.

1179
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:09,020
That's in the crime blotter.

1180
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:11,660
That's not really on the Instagram Discover page.

1181
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:15,980
Do you recall anything that anyone got fired for?

1182
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:19,500
Oh yeah, this was at Universal,

1183
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:22,340
but a guy did a naked cartwheel in the break room.

1184
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:27,340
I think that would get you fired from most positions

1185
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:28,420
and most jobs.

1186
00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:29,860
I also like...

1187
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:32,100
Do you think if he was just naked in general,

1188
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:33,340
it wouldn't have been a fireball offense?

1189
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:35,700
It's the cartwheel specifically while naked

1190
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:36,700
that was the issue?

1191
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:37,540
I don't know.

1192
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:40,700
I'll have to, yeah, look at the files.

1193
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:43,060
But at Disneyland, a couple of girls

1194
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:45,860
got written up for kissing the kids

1195
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:48,820
because again, I'm a broken record,

1196
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:50,340
but when we first started working there,

1197
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:53,700
you could kiss the kids and leave on their cheek, of course,

1198
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:55,060
get your mind out of their gutter,

1199
00:43:55,060 --> 00:43:57,460
and leave a big princess kiss mark on their cheek

1200
00:43:57,460 --> 00:43:58,540
and it was really cute.

1201
00:43:58,820 --> 00:44:00,180
Kiss a little boy on his forehead

1202
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:02,180
and they'd have a big kiss mark.

1203
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:05,100
Then they started saying, hey, don't kiss the kids,

1204
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:06,420
which is fair.

1205
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:07,260
Fair?

1206
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:08,100
A number of reasons.

1207
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:10,820
For one, measles outbreaks recently.

1208
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:12,780
That's right, but a couple of the girls,

1209
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:15,140
they were resisting change, so they didn't like that

1210
00:44:15,140 --> 00:44:16,260
because they liked...

1211
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:19,220
A couple of the Sleeping Beauty specifically

1212
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:21,020
continued to kiss the kids.

1213
00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:23,860
And so they got in trouble.

1214
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:26,780
Whoa, I was drawing a line in the sand.

1215
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:28,100
Yeah.

1216
00:44:28,620 --> 00:44:30,380
Can you imagine though the conversation,

1217
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:33,100
they're like, I am not gonna listen to their fucking rules.

1218
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:35,700
I am kissing these kids, that's what I'm here to do.

1219
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:38,460
I'm Sleeping Fucking Beauty.

1220
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:41,340
Oh no, literally, those were the conversations.

1221
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:42,180
Wow.

1222
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:43,260
I'm the boots on the ground,

1223
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:45,140
I'm the slippers on the ground.

1224
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:49,860
These kids are gonna leave this place with empty foreheads.

1225
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:50,820
I won't have it.

1226
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:52,900
That stuff's funny to me.

1227
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:55,340
Like, I was a tour guide at Universal.

1228
00:44:55,340 --> 00:44:56,180
Oh yeah?

1229
00:44:56,380 --> 00:45:00,740
And the kinds of things that everyone is all up in arms

1230
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:02,540
about, like you describing,

1231
00:45:02,540 --> 00:45:03,980
they're gonna put everybody in the corner

1232
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:05,300
and you're just gonna be in this one room

1233
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:06,380
and you don't get to have the...

1234
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:09,180
Those kinds of, I remember having a lot of that,

1235
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:10,900
the things you're up in arms about

1236
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:13,100
and then a decade goes by and you're not there anymore.

1237
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:14,780
And like, why was I mad?

1238
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:17,780
I know, and people are so into this job.

1239
00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:19,980
I mean, I was never like that.

1240
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:23,460
I mean, I always thought it was cool and I liked doing it.

1241
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:25,420
I also found it super exhausting

1242
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:29,540
just having to talk to people like that all day.

1243
00:45:29,540 --> 00:45:33,340
So I was never, I mean, I never had a hill to die on.

1244
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:38,020
There was never like a change that happened

1245
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:40,020
that you were very upset about?

1246
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:42,140
No, no.

1247
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:42,980
Yeah, I'm fine.

1248
00:45:42,980 --> 00:45:44,860
No, it was all good.

1249
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:47,980
Yeah, it's also like, you could say, hey, you podcast,

1250
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:49,900
you talk for long stretches of time,

1251
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:53,380
but there's a difference between doing this for a while

1252
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:57,060
and doing height well high there.

1253
00:45:57,060 --> 00:45:59,980
I can imagine 45 minutes of that in the sun

1254
00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:03,260
has just gotta be physically pushing it.

1255
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:06,100
Yeah, it was truly exhausting.

1256
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:07,220
Right, right.

1257
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:11,460
And that was sort of the, it's like 45,

1258
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:12,860
something in that stretch.

1259
00:46:12,860 --> 00:46:15,140
Yeah, you do 45 minutes and then have a 15 minute break

1260
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:17,180
and I think you do seven or eight of those a day.

1261
00:46:17,180 --> 00:46:18,900
Uh-huh, uh-huh, wow, wow.

1262
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:22,340
What do you, and then in the meantime,

1263
00:46:22,340 --> 00:46:23,740
you're just chilling out, you're just?

1264
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:24,780
Yeah, like in the break room.

1265
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:25,620
Yeah, yeah.

1266
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:27,020
Yeah, just chilling, just bring a book.

1267
00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:30,180
I mean, I was in school studying, reading.

1268
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:31,620
Oh, sure, oh yes, you had stuff to do.

1269
00:46:31,620 --> 00:46:33,060
Yeah, I had stuff to homework.

1270
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:33,900
Right, right.

1271
00:46:35,380 --> 00:46:39,260
I have a question about the language barrier in Tokyo.

1272
00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:41,100
Like how did that, how did you ever come back in?

1273
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:41,940
Well, a lot of Japanese people,

1274
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:43,100
they learn English in school.

1275
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:45,700
So it was actually really cool because all the little kids,

1276
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:46,580
they learned it really young,

1277
00:46:46,580 --> 00:46:50,580
so they would want to practice their English with you.

1278
00:46:50,620 --> 00:46:53,380
And then I learned a tiny, tiny bit of Japanese

1279
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:55,940
where I could have a conversation with a three year old,

1280
00:46:55,940 --> 00:46:58,300
but nothing really beyond that.

1281
00:46:58,300 --> 00:47:01,780
But yeah, the language barrier wasn't really an issue

1282
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:03,780
because even if they kind of were shy

1283
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:05,340
about speaking English over there,

1284
00:47:05,340 --> 00:47:08,180
most people understood, I think, basic English.

1285
00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:10,780
Sure, sure, and maybe possibly a good chance

1286
00:47:10,780 --> 00:47:12,180
to practice and stuff.

1287
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:13,020
Yeah, that's what they like.

1288
00:47:13,020 --> 00:47:14,140
When we were guests, there was somebody

1289
00:47:14,140 --> 00:47:18,140
at that Pan Galactic pizza port was just like,

1290
00:47:18,980 --> 00:47:20,660
asking really basic questions.

1291
00:47:20,660 --> 00:47:24,300
Like, I'm going to America soon, what should I do?

1292
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:25,980
Which made me realize what it was like,

1293
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:28,340
I probably would ask that to somebody living in Japan.

1294
00:47:28,340 --> 00:47:29,340
What do I do here?

1295
00:47:29,340 --> 00:47:30,900
And you go, it's a whole country.

1296
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:32,260
It's a pretty hard question.

1297
00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:33,860
Where are you going specifically?

1298
00:47:33,860 --> 00:47:36,460
Yeah, there's a pretty, there's a world of difference.

1299
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:39,300
It's weird how I never, I am disconnected from that.

1300
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:41,540
Like Japan, it's all one thing.

1301
00:47:41,540 --> 00:47:44,140
And then when somebody asks me, what do you do in America?

1302
00:47:44,140 --> 00:47:46,140
Golden Gate Bridge, Statue of Liberty.

1303
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:48,660
I don't know how you answer that.

1304
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:50,220
Target, Walmart.

1305
00:47:50,220 --> 00:47:52,660
I'll say both, they're different.

1306
00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:53,660
Universal City Walk.

1307
00:47:53,660 --> 00:47:55,820
Yeah, mainly, yeah, at least five days.

1308
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:04,020
Any bizarre interactions where you felt not up to speed

1309
00:48:04,020 --> 00:48:08,140
on mythology as much as you should have been?

1310
00:48:08,140 --> 00:48:12,060
Oh, I mean, people try to trip you up all the time.

1311
00:48:12,060 --> 00:48:14,580
I mean, you guys know, there's like, I mean,

1312
00:48:14,620 --> 00:48:17,260
there's a lot of like Disney fanatics out there

1313
00:48:17,260 --> 00:48:19,220
who are so into the minutia.

1314
00:48:19,220 --> 00:48:23,140
So yeah, you would, well, Ariel,

1315
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:24,900
sometimes some jerks would come and be like,

1316
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:27,140
name your six sisters, Ariel.

1317
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:30,260
And I used to be able to do it,

1318
00:48:30,260 --> 00:48:33,300
but I think it's like Andrina, Adela, Arista.

1319
00:48:34,340 --> 00:48:35,860
I can't, oh, Alana.

1320
00:48:35,860 --> 00:48:36,700
They're all A's.

1321
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:37,540
They're all A's.

1322
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:39,460
Which makes it much harder.

1323
00:48:39,460 --> 00:48:41,220
I know, so it's just stuff like that.

1324
00:48:41,220 --> 00:48:43,940
Yeah, people would wanna trip you up on everything.

1325
00:48:43,940 --> 00:48:47,220
Or they'd say like, oh, I just saw you at breakfast

1326
00:48:47,220 --> 00:48:50,660
this morning, how'd you get all the way over here so fast?

1327
00:48:50,660 --> 00:48:53,300
You know, or like, I saw you yesterday

1328
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:54,940
and you looked different, you know,

1329
00:48:54,940 --> 00:48:55,980
if they saw another girl.

1330
00:48:55,980 --> 00:48:58,300
Like, they would try and catch you.

1331
00:48:58,300 --> 00:49:01,900
Or how are you here and at Disney World at the same time?

1332
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:03,180
And I'd be like, I'm not.

1333
00:49:04,340 --> 00:49:07,820
Prove, so get someone on a, there's no FaceTime then,

1334
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:11,060
so they can't like send somebody to see a Cinderella

1335
00:49:11,060 --> 00:49:12,300
at that moment.

1336
00:49:12,340 --> 00:49:15,940
Is there, yeah, was there a rule book response

1337
00:49:15,940 --> 00:49:17,340
to all of those things, I assume?

1338
00:49:17,340 --> 00:49:18,500
Yeah, there's a princess hand,

1339
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:21,220
like a literal princess handbook for each character.

1340
00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:22,900
And in it, I should have brought it

1341
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:24,140
because I still have one of them.

1342
00:49:24,140 --> 00:49:27,420
But it's all the questions you might get asked.

1343
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:29,940
Like, Ariel, how do you go to the bathroom?

1344
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:33,020
Do you have a canon response to that?

1345
00:49:33,020 --> 00:49:34,940
Yeah, of course, because you get asked that a lot

1346
00:49:34,940 --> 00:49:37,740
and you just go, well, that's a silly question.

1347
00:49:37,740 --> 00:49:39,020
How about a photo?

1348
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:44,260
I mean, it's true that no, you shouldn't,

1349
00:49:45,580 --> 00:49:48,540
to no person should you ask how do you go to the bathroom?

1350
00:49:48,540 --> 00:49:50,260
No, it's rude.

1351
00:49:50,260 --> 00:49:52,100
Or if they ask how old are you, you say,

1352
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:54,460
well, you never ask a princess your age.

1353
00:49:54,460 --> 00:49:55,300
How old are you?

1354
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:57,540
You know, you just kind of spin it around.

1355
00:49:57,540 --> 00:49:58,860
Oh, okay.

1356
00:49:59,820 --> 00:50:02,740
Anything you ever, that came out of nowhere though?

1357
00:50:02,740 --> 00:50:05,100
Like, oh, I got nothing there.

1358
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:07,420
Oh God, I mean, so many times.

1359
00:50:07,420 --> 00:50:09,340
I'm trying to remember a specific one,

1360
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:12,820
but you just, I mean, you can always just play dumb.

1361
00:50:12,820 --> 00:50:14,460
I mean, really, that's what they,

1362
00:50:14,460 --> 00:50:17,140
you can just like laugh and then be like, ha ha, smile.

1363
00:50:17,140 --> 00:50:20,420
I mean, and then next, you know?

1364
00:50:20,420 --> 00:50:22,180
Like, if a kid's asking too many questions,

1365
00:50:22,180 --> 00:50:25,300
you can literally just like not answer them.

1366
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:26,140
Right.

1367
00:50:26,140 --> 00:50:27,780
Fair, yeah, you gotta keep the line moving.

1368
00:50:27,780 --> 00:50:31,220
Would the worst questions come from the kids or the dads?

1369
00:50:32,180 --> 00:50:34,420
Yeah, I mean, the dads, every once in a while,

1370
00:50:34,420 --> 00:50:38,340
you'd get just like a dad who's like trying to be funny

1371
00:50:38,340 --> 00:50:40,900
and flirt with you and yeah.

1372
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:43,980
But no, the kids were always pretty cute, you know?

1373
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:45,620
I mean, usually the kids were good.

1374
00:50:45,620 --> 00:50:48,540
At their worst, they were like covered in something sticky.

1375
00:50:48,540 --> 00:50:50,380
Oh gosh.

1376
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:51,980
And at their best, they were so cute

1377
00:50:51,980 --> 00:50:53,220
and they'd make your day.

1378
00:50:53,220 --> 00:50:55,020
Oh geez, oh that's nice.

1379
00:50:55,020 --> 00:50:58,660
I, in looking up a little bit of, you know,

1380
00:50:58,660 --> 00:51:01,100
Reddit threads or like people talking about

1381
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:04,140
having this job, the one that really jumped out at me

1382
00:51:04,820 --> 00:51:09,820
was the issue of Pocahontas being a real character

1383
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:14,500
or a real person in the world

1384
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:17,260
and how do you like manage that mythology

1385
00:51:17,260 --> 00:51:19,340
with being Pocahontas in the party?

1386
00:51:19,340 --> 00:51:22,940
And somebody, a kid coming up to Pocahontas

1387
00:51:22,940 --> 00:51:24,660
in a meet and greet and saying,

1388
00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:27,660
when Mike Glass visited your grave last year.

1389
00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:28,500
Oh no!

1390
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:33,660
That was a mental floss, I saw that.

1391
00:51:34,540 --> 00:51:35,420
Yeah, I don't know that they're,

1392
00:51:35,420 --> 00:51:37,300
I don't think, she might've been dumbfounded.

1393
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:39,620
I'm not sure there was a response there.

1394
00:51:39,620 --> 00:51:40,980
How in the world do you?

1395
00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:43,660
I think you'd probably say like,

1396
00:51:43,660 --> 00:51:45,980
oh, I don't think that's quite right.

1397
00:51:45,980 --> 00:51:47,300
Let's have a photo.

1398
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:49,980
Are you sure?

1399
00:51:49,980 --> 00:51:52,580
Rumors of my demise have been greatly exaggerated.

1400
00:51:52,580 --> 00:51:53,420
Yeah.

1401
00:51:54,260 --> 00:51:56,260
Oh my God, that's hilarious.

1402
00:51:57,620 --> 00:52:00,020
Pocahontas apparently the one of the few,

1403
00:52:00,020 --> 00:52:02,180
if not the only one who gets approved,

1404
00:52:02,180 --> 00:52:04,420
can get approved to use their own hair

1405
00:52:04,420 --> 00:52:06,660
because everything else is wigs, right?

1406
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:08,660
No, Pocahontas is a wig.

1407
00:52:08,660 --> 00:52:09,500
Oh, it is?

1408
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:12,620
Yeah, so I don't know where you got that information.

1409
00:52:12,620 --> 00:52:14,980
I think Buzzfeed did a big brain over that.

1410
00:52:14,980 --> 00:52:18,140
I think in some rare instances,

1411
00:52:18,140 --> 00:52:19,220
it's been their own hair,

1412
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:21,020
but for the most part, it's usually not.

1413
00:52:21,020 --> 00:52:21,980
Yeah, because otherwise,

1414
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:23,540
it's like you just have to look consistent.

1415
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:26,020
So almost everything is a wig.

1416
00:52:26,020 --> 00:52:27,300
But yeah, maybe there's one girl

1417
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:28,700
who just had such good hair,

1418
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:32,140
but I think doesn't Pocahontas have a bang as well?

1419
00:52:33,260 --> 00:52:34,100
It's very long.

1420
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:34,940
It's very long.

1421
00:52:34,940 --> 00:52:37,140
I don't know, I think there might also be a bang.

1422
00:52:37,140 --> 00:52:39,700
You all have a weird upswoosh like Catherine O'Hara

1423
00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:41,140
and waiting for Gufman.

1424
00:52:41,140 --> 00:52:43,060
Bizarre like front part.

1425
00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:48,100
How did you land on which ones you ended up playing?

1426
00:52:48,100 --> 00:52:49,900
They just cast you as it.

1427
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:54,900
So a lot of times, Cinderella and Ariel could double

1428
00:52:55,700 --> 00:52:57,540
because they both have like,

1429
00:52:58,700 --> 00:53:00,500
Ariel, Cinderella, and Princess Aurora

1430
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:03,500
are all like blue or green eyes.

1431
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:05,980
Cinderella is blue typically,

1432
00:53:05,980 --> 00:53:07,980
and then Aurora can kind of be like,

1433
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:09,860
it's a lot that has to do with eye color

1434
00:53:09,860 --> 00:53:12,020
and just like how your face looks.

1435
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:14,500
Is there any voice testing?

1436
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:15,820
Does that matter really?

1437
00:53:15,820 --> 00:53:17,740
It's all just like a generic princess voice.

1438
00:53:17,740 --> 00:53:19,460
They try to kind of tell you like,

1439
00:53:19,460 --> 00:53:21,940
Princess Aurora is a little bit more ethereal,

1440
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:24,460
a little bit more princess-like.

1441
00:53:24,460 --> 00:53:26,420
They pose you in slightly different ways

1442
00:53:26,420 --> 00:53:28,180
where like Princess Aurora might have,

1443
00:53:28,540 --> 00:53:30,820
say your left hand kind of like poised at your heart

1444
00:53:30,820 --> 00:53:32,500
and your right hand out,

1445
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:35,340
and then Ariel you could get away with hands on hips

1446
00:53:35,340 --> 00:53:38,100
where like Princess Aurora would never do that.

1447
00:53:38,100 --> 00:53:39,860
Cinderella maybe could have hands on hips

1448
00:53:39,860 --> 00:53:41,820
because she's a little bit more modern.

1449
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:44,260
And then Ariel you could say things like,

1450
00:53:44,260 --> 00:53:45,700
neat and cool.

1451
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:48,780
Like Cinderella would never say cool.

1452
00:53:48,780 --> 00:53:49,940
Oh, interesting.

1453
00:53:49,940 --> 00:53:51,940
Okay, yeah, yeah.

1454
00:53:51,940 --> 00:53:53,380
Sort of hipper.

1455
00:53:53,380 --> 00:53:54,420
Take that at her.

1456
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:55,940
I'm trying to add that.

1457
00:53:55,940 --> 00:53:57,980
That is like, I will remember that, honestly.

1458
00:53:57,980 --> 00:53:58,820
Yeah, yeah.

1459
00:53:58,820 --> 00:53:59,780
That's not a thing I'm gonna forget.

1460
00:53:59,780 --> 00:54:01,060
I think it just, does it just,

1461
00:54:01,060 --> 00:54:02,740
you know, it's a way stemming from the,

1462
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:04,580
she came out in the 80s.

1463
00:54:04,580 --> 00:54:05,420
It does, yeah.

1464
00:54:05,420 --> 00:54:07,260
So you guys are like mall girls a little more.

1465
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:08,780
I think, absolutely.

1466
00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:11,780
Elsa and Anna can like say fart and stuff probably.

1467
00:54:11,780 --> 00:54:14,020
Well, I don't know about fart.

1468
00:54:14,020 --> 00:54:16,420
Just saying they can get a little bit bawdier.

1469
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:17,260
Yeah.

1470
00:54:17,260 --> 00:54:19,700
Me and that viral clip of Elsa going, ah shit.

1471
00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:23,340
I'm trying to find my reindeer thing.

1472
00:54:23,380 --> 00:54:24,580
But it is funny because you think,

1473
00:54:24,580 --> 00:54:26,420
oh, you just get someone who kind of looks like them

1474
00:54:26,420 --> 00:54:28,860
and slop a dress and a wig and some makeup on them.

1475
00:54:28,860 --> 00:54:32,300
But they put a lot of care into teaching you,

1476
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:36,180
even though at the end of the day it doesn't really matter,

1477
00:54:36,180 --> 00:54:38,340
but there is a lot of,

1478
00:54:38,340 --> 00:54:41,340
there's a difference between all of those characters.

1479
00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:43,020
Sure, sure.

1480
00:54:43,020 --> 00:54:44,540
Is makeup different?

1481
00:54:44,540 --> 00:54:46,300
Yeah, makeup is different.

1482
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:47,140
Yeah.

1483
00:54:47,140 --> 00:54:48,500
But it's funny how they,

1484
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:50,300
a lot of girls when I worked there,

1485
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:51,660
they would try and get creative.

1486
00:54:51,660 --> 00:54:52,660
They'd give you all the makeup

1487
00:54:52,660 --> 00:54:53,860
and teach you how to do it.

1488
00:54:53,860 --> 00:54:56,340
But it was like, it's like drag queen makeup.

1489
00:54:56,340 --> 00:54:57,180
Right.

1490
00:54:57,180 --> 00:54:59,420
I think they give you Bobbi Brown

1491
00:54:59,420 --> 00:55:02,140
and there's some other brand of makeup that is used,

1492
00:55:02,140 --> 00:55:03,940
it's like stage makeup.

1493
00:55:03,940 --> 00:55:04,780
Is it Ben Nye?

1494
00:55:04,780 --> 00:55:06,020
Yes, Ben Nye, it's Ben Nye.

1495
00:55:06,020 --> 00:55:07,660
Yeah, that's what it is.

1496
00:55:07,660 --> 00:55:09,220
So they give you all this Ben Nye makeup

1497
00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:11,500
and then you're taught to do it by this man

1498
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:13,340
who has been working there for forever,

1499
00:55:13,340 --> 00:55:14,820
I think used to be a Prince Charming.

1500
00:55:14,820 --> 00:55:16,020
And it's just like,

1501
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:20,300
the way they want you to do it is so 80s.

1502
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:21,140
It's a lot.

1503
00:55:21,140 --> 00:55:21,980
So much blush.

1504
00:55:21,980 --> 00:55:22,820
So much blush.

1505
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:26,500
It's like pink lips, blue eyeshadow,

1506
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:27,820
like eyebrows.

1507
00:55:27,820 --> 00:55:31,500
And so when I was there, it's like the girls,

1508
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:33,340
it's when Mac was really big.

1509
00:55:33,340 --> 00:55:35,300
I mean, this was in like the early 2000s.

1510
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:37,260
And so they would try and get some highlighter going

1511
00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:38,100
and a lot of glitter

1512
00:55:38,100 --> 00:55:39,340
and then you could get written up

1513
00:55:39,340 --> 00:55:42,020
for experimenting with your makeup.

1514
00:55:42,020 --> 00:55:44,740
But I think maybe they've maybe changed the makeup now

1515
00:55:44,740 --> 00:55:45,580
since I've been there.

1516
00:55:45,580 --> 00:55:48,900
And I think they've also toned down the bangs a little bit.

1517
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:49,740
Okay.

1518
00:55:50,580 --> 00:55:51,420
Yeah, that's a,

1519
00:55:51,420 --> 00:55:53,980
because now we're a long distance from the 80s.

1520
00:55:53,980 --> 00:55:57,900
It's pretty like crazy to stay with 80s makeup standards.

1521
00:55:57,900 --> 00:56:00,300
When you would get like a different character,

1522
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:01,780
like when you would change,

1523
00:56:01,780 --> 00:56:04,100
was it like you got an assignment,

1524
00:56:04,100 --> 00:56:05,020
assignment essentially?

1525
00:56:05,020 --> 00:56:06,700
They're like, hey, today you're off.

1526
00:56:06,700 --> 00:56:08,060
You're doing this.

1527
00:56:08,060 --> 00:56:10,260
They would just dictate whatever depending on the day

1528
00:56:10,260 --> 00:56:11,100
or would you like,

1529
00:56:11,100 --> 00:56:13,180
did you do six months of one and then another six months?

1530
00:56:13,180 --> 00:56:14,460
Oh, it's day to day.

1531
00:56:14,460 --> 00:56:15,580
And sometimes in the same day,

1532
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:16,820
you'd play more than one character

1533
00:56:16,820 --> 00:56:18,820
and meet the same family over and over again.

1534
00:56:18,820 --> 00:56:19,660
Really?

1535
00:56:20,540 --> 00:56:21,380
Wow.

1536
00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:23,140
And did you ever get called out about that?

1537
00:56:23,140 --> 00:56:24,100
Yes, all the time.

1538
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:24,940
Oh wow.

1539
00:56:24,940 --> 00:56:27,260
Yeah, people, a lot of times parents would notice

1540
00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:29,700
and be like, we think we met your friend

1541
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:32,500
at Goofy's kitchen this morning.

1542
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:33,660
Cinderella, do you know her?

1543
00:56:33,660 --> 00:56:35,580
And you'd be like, yes, that's me.

1544
00:56:35,580 --> 00:56:38,020
And so that was kind of fun.

1545
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:40,500
We also had a pair of twins who were working there.

1546
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:41,860
So sometimes you'd have Cinderella

1547
00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:43,660
and Princess Aurora side by side.

1548
00:56:43,660 --> 00:56:45,660
And it was, they had the same face.

1549
00:56:45,660 --> 00:56:46,500
Oh, dear.

1550
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:50,460
That's a certain cognitive dissonance.

1551
00:56:50,460 --> 00:56:51,940
Yeah, it's odd, right?

1552
00:56:51,940 --> 00:56:53,140
It's like uncanny rally.

1553
00:56:54,340 --> 00:56:55,180
Strange.

1554
00:56:56,460 --> 00:56:59,380
Hi, podcast, the Ride Listeners, it's Jason.

1555
00:56:59,380 --> 00:57:01,220
We're taking a quick break to talk about

1556
00:57:01,220 --> 00:57:03,860
an interesting story from the good people

1557
00:57:03,860 --> 00:57:05,700
at the LEAD we saw this week.

1558
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:08,260
The LEAD, of course, a brand new daily sports podcast

1559
00:57:08,260 --> 00:57:09,820
from Wondery and the Athletic.

1560
00:57:09,820 --> 00:57:11,980
It's all about the stories behind sports,

1561
00:57:11,980 --> 00:57:14,740
drama, heartbreak, controversy, cultural impact.

1562
00:57:14,740 --> 00:57:15,700
Yeah, all of the things.

1563
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:16,540
All of the things.

1564
00:57:16,540 --> 00:57:19,220
The stuff we talk about, about theme parks,

1565
00:57:19,220 --> 00:57:21,220
they talk about sports.

1566
00:57:21,220 --> 00:57:22,060
That's right.

1567
00:57:22,060 --> 00:57:22,980
Which helps fills in gaps

1568
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:25,300
because our sports knowledge is very little.

1569
00:57:25,300 --> 00:57:27,100
You get to hear stories about all kinds of things

1570
00:57:27,100 --> 00:57:29,180
that you don't even realize are related to sports.

1571
00:57:29,180 --> 00:57:31,620
Things like the ice bucket challenge.

1572
00:57:31,620 --> 00:57:32,900
Remember that?

1573
00:57:32,900 --> 00:57:34,860
I remember the ice bucket challenge.

1574
00:57:34,860 --> 00:57:36,940
I make a point sometimes of going back

1575
00:57:36,940 --> 00:57:39,580
and watching specific ice bucket challenges.

1576
00:57:40,860 --> 00:57:42,420
The internet's just littered with them,

1577
00:57:42,420 --> 00:57:45,620
especially George W. Bush.

1578
00:57:46,540 --> 00:57:48,180
He says he's not gonna do the ice bucket challenge

1579
00:57:48,180 --> 00:57:49,620
because it wouldn't be presidential.

1580
00:57:49,620 --> 00:57:52,820
Then Laura sneaks up behind him and pours the bucket.

1581
00:57:52,820 --> 00:57:54,500
She says, I didn't wanna do it.

1582
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:56,700
I don't wanna get my hair wet.

1583
00:57:56,700 --> 00:57:58,340
Then it gets very serious again.

1584
00:57:58,340 --> 00:58:00,220
But you get to see them joke around.

1585
00:58:00,220 --> 00:58:01,060
What a blast.

1586
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:03,500
There's a Howard Stern ice bucket challenge

1587
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:05,260
with a little tiny cup of water

1588
00:58:05,260 --> 00:58:06,780
because truly he thought,

1589
00:58:06,780 --> 00:58:09,100
and this is something I think my mom said at the time,

1590
00:58:09,100 --> 00:58:10,540
getting ice water on your head,

1591
00:58:10,540 --> 00:58:11,620
that'll give you a heart attack.

1592
00:58:11,620 --> 00:58:13,020
You'll get a heart attack and you'll die

1593
00:58:13,020 --> 00:58:15,060
if somebody dumps ice water on your head.

1594
00:58:15,740 --> 00:58:19,660
It would just trigger the temperatures to confusing.

1595
00:58:19,660 --> 00:58:21,020
My mom, when it was happening,

1596
00:58:21,020 --> 00:58:23,740
my mom texted me like, no ice bucket challenge.

1597
00:58:24,620 --> 00:58:26,180
She was really wanting me not to do it.

1598
00:58:26,180 --> 00:58:27,020
Seriously?

1599
00:58:27,020 --> 00:58:27,860
I swear that's happened.

1600
00:58:27,860 --> 00:58:29,540
If it's too cold, you could go into

1601
00:58:29,540 --> 00:58:32,580
a very mild version of shock, potentially.

1602
00:58:32,580 --> 00:58:33,420
Anyway.

1603
00:58:33,420 --> 00:58:34,420
So you didn't get to do it.

1604
00:58:34,420 --> 00:58:35,500
You didn't get challenged.

1605
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:36,540
No, thank God.

1606
00:58:36,540 --> 00:58:37,540
Okay, yes.

1607
00:58:37,540 --> 00:58:40,460
We were too busy icing each other in 2014.

1608
00:58:40,460 --> 00:58:41,420
Remember that?

1609
00:58:41,420 --> 00:58:42,940
We were keeping that alive.

1610
00:58:42,940 --> 00:58:44,740
We're a little behind the times.

1611
00:58:45,740 --> 00:58:46,820
The ice bucket challenge,

1612
00:58:46,820 --> 00:58:48,780
you couldn't escape it in 2014.

1613
00:58:48,780 --> 00:58:50,860
People were pouring freezing buckets of water on each other

1614
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:52,900
or just tiny cups in some cases

1615
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:55,460
to raise money for ALS research and awareness.

1616
00:58:55,460 --> 00:58:57,380
Well, as it turns out, the ice bucket challenge,

1617
00:58:57,380 --> 00:58:58,940
when it all began, was the brainchild

1618
00:58:58,940 --> 00:59:03,060
of the University of Arizona women's basketball team.

1619
00:59:03,060 --> 00:59:04,500
That was for them to raise money

1620
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:06,140
and then it ended up growing into

1621
00:59:06,140 --> 00:59:08,820
the most successful online fundraiser in history,

1622
00:59:08,820 --> 00:59:09,660
raising millions of dollars.

1623
00:59:09,660 --> 00:59:10,500
Oh my God.

1624
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:11,340
Yeah.

1625
00:59:11,340 --> 00:59:14,780
From that to the former president

1626
00:59:15,500 --> 00:59:16,340
all around the world.

1627
00:59:16,340 --> 00:59:18,060
It did do a lot of good, even though culturally

1628
00:59:18,060 --> 00:59:19,980
it kind of got away from us.

1629
00:59:19,980 --> 00:59:21,660
Oh sure, yeah.

1630
00:59:21,660 --> 00:59:23,380
But the actual intention,

1631
00:59:23,380 --> 00:59:27,140
no matter how many failed bits it led to.

1632
00:59:27,140 --> 00:59:29,780
Yeah, so the coach of the Arizona team, Naya Butts,

1633
00:59:29,780 --> 00:59:31,780
is the one that actually came up with

1634
00:59:31,780 --> 00:59:33,660
the idea of making the ice bucket challenge competitive,

1635
00:59:33,660 --> 00:59:34,740
not just doing it yourself,

1636
00:59:34,740 --> 00:59:37,380
but challenging other people to do it as well.

1637
00:59:37,380 --> 00:59:40,420
So the virality of it was built into it

1638
00:59:40,420 --> 00:59:43,820
by the U of A women's basketball coach.

1639
00:59:43,980 --> 00:59:45,700
And how do I know all of this stuff?

1640
00:59:45,700 --> 00:59:48,180
Because I heard it on the lead.

1641
00:59:48,180 --> 00:59:52,500
I love hearing stories and then reframing them to people

1642
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:53,580
because I found them interesting

1643
00:59:53,580 --> 00:59:54,940
and the lead's a great source for that.

1644
00:59:54,940 --> 00:59:55,980
Yeah, and the lead is like,

1645
00:59:55,980 --> 00:59:58,260
it takes you through the story, which is really fun

1646
00:59:58,260 --> 01:00:01,220
and it's an anecdotal and compelling way to tell a story.

1647
01:00:01,220 --> 01:00:03,380
They have great interview with Naya Butts herself,

1648
01:00:03,380 --> 01:00:05,420
all about how she applied coaching strategies

1649
01:00:05,420 --> 01:00:08,220
to turn the ice bucket challenge from a local fundraiser

1650
01:00:08,220 --> 01:00:10,140
into an international phenomenon.

1651
01:00:10,140 --> 01:00:11,380
It's an incredible story.

1652
01:00:11,380 --> 01:00:12,700
You should definitely check it out.

1653
01:00:12,700 --> 01:00:14,460
The lead has a new episode every day of the week

1654
01:00:14,460 --> 01:00:16,780
covering sports stories just like this one.

1655
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:19,060
So let's say from Podcast The Ride,

1656
01:00:19,060 --> 01:00:21,540
go subscribe to the lead on Apple Podcasts

1657
01:00:21,540 --> 01:00:24,020
or wherever you listen to this podcast right now.

1658
01:00:24,020 --> 01:00:27,660
And now back to the show, Podcast The Ride.

1659
01:00:27,660 --> 01:00:29,060
Our interesting stories.

1660
01:00:29,060 --> 01:00:29,900
Yeah.

1661
01:00:29,900 --> 01:00:34,780
Was there like with this evil queen,

1662
01:00:34,780 --> 01:00:36,420
like that was, did you associate,

1663
01:00:36,420 --> 01:00:38,660
were the princesses ever associated with the villains?

1664
01:00:38,660 --> 01:00:40,980
Was that all in the same area?

1665
01:00:40,980 --> 01:00:42,980
Sometimes, like if you were lucky,

1666
01:00:42,980 --> 01:00:44,980
maybe you'd have like a pass by.

1667
01:00:44,980 --> 01:00:47,340
You would probably never do a whole set together,

1668
01:00:47,340 --> 01:00:48,980
but sometimes you'd have a little fun

1669
01:00:48,980 --> 01:00:51,580
when you kind of like walk past each other.

1670
01:00:51,580 --> 01:00:54,540
Or the queen might kind of circulate and come by you,

1671
01:00:54,540 --> 01:00:57,980
you know, Maleficent or whatever, if you're Aurora.

1672
01:00:57,980 --> 01:00:59,420
Oh, and you had to like,

1673
01:00:59,420 --> 01:01:00,700
have a little. Dark eyes.

1674
01:01:00,700 --> 01:01:02,300
Yeah, yeah. Interaction.

1675
01:01:02,300 --> 01:01:04,780
Throw shade. Yeah, throw some shade.

1676
01:01:04,780 --> 01:01:07,740
But were you at all clicky with the other princesses

1677
01:01:07,740 --> 01:01:09,980
and were the villains clicky with themselves?

1678
01:01:10,020 --> 01:01:12,060
I mean, I think that's usually in any sort of job.

1679
01:01:12,060 --> 01:01:14,220
That's what ends up happening is just whatever group

1680
01:01:14,220 --> 01:01:15,140
you've been lumped into,

1681
01:01:15,140 --> 01:01:17,180
you end up associating with those people more.

1682
01:01:17,180 --> 01:01:18,580
Yeah, I think that that's true.

1683
01:01:18,580 --> 01:01:21,660
And most of it had to do with what break room everyone was in.

1684
01:01:21,660 --> 01:01:24,780
So a lot of times the villains would be over in DCA,

1685
01:01:24,780 --> 01:01:28,340
which is, you know, talk for Disney's California Adventure,

1686
01:01:28,340 --> 01:01:30,620
which I'm sure your listeners know.

1687
01:01:30,620 --> 01:01:32,780
And then, you know, so sometimes you would make friends

1688
01:01:32,780 --> 01:01:36,780
across the tracks, the train tracks.

1689
01:01:37,780 --> 01:01:40,660
If you had, you know, were in a break room.

1690
01:01:40,660 --> 01:01:42,820
I also did this show called Drawn to the Magic,

1691
01:01:42,820 --> 01:01:45,180
which is in Disney's California Adventure.

1692
01:01:45,180 --> 01:01:46,980
I don't know if it's still there, but then you,

1693
01:01:46,980 --> 01:01:48,820
in that case, you were in a break room.

1694
01:01:48,820 --> 01:01:49,780
You were the only princess.

1695
01:01:49,780 --> 01:01:51,540
And then you had like a Goofy and a Mickey

1696
01:01:51,540 --> 01:01:53,980
and a couple of singers, Agvast singers.

1697
01:01:53,980 --> 01:01:56,020
And so you'd become really close with them.

1698
01:01:56,020 --> 01:01:57,780
OK, I gotcha. Yeah, wait.

1699
01:01:57,780 --> 01:01:59,220
So yeah, I was looking that up.

1700
01:01:59,220 --> 01:02:02,740
Drawn to the Magic is a that was in that.

1701
01:02:03,060 --> 01:02:06,500
It's in that weird stage that's just behind facades.

1702
01:02:06,780 --> 01:02:08,820
It's just big like steel beams.

1703
01:02:08,820 --> 01:02:10,300
Yeah. Basically.

1704
01:02:10,300 --> 01:02:14,420
And then it used to be right in front of what was that weird center

1705
01:02:14,420 --> 01:02:16,660
where you'd go in and it was all dark in there.

1706
01:02:17,980 --> 01:02:18,780
The animation building.

1707
01:02:18,780 --> 01:02:20,460
Yeah, the animation building.

1708
01:02:20,460 --> 01:02:22,220
It used to just be out on the street

1709
01:02:22,220 --> 01:02:24,460
right in front of the animation building.

1710
01:02:24,460 --> 01:02:30,740
And this was also this is where Matt did like improv shows to you.

1711
01:02:30,740 --> 01:02:32,180
You didn't cross paths with him.

1712
01:02:32,180 --> 01:02:35,300
I think I saw him once riding a bike in a lab coat and he

1713
01:02:35,780 --> 01:02:38,780
he refuses to admit that he ever wore a lab coat.

1714
01:02:38,780 --> 01:02:40,020
He did ride a bike.

1715
01:02:40,020 --> 01:02:44,260
Statistically, you must have worn a lab coat if he was doing improv in a theme park.

1716
01:02:44,980 --> 01:02:47,060
That's what I think.

1717
01:02:47,060 --> 01:02:48,980
And I think I remember seeing him.

1718
01:02:48,980 --> 01:02:52,060
But, you know, he would not have been able to pick me out of a crowd

1719
01:02:52,060 --> 01:02:54,300
because there were a million of me.

1720
01:02:54,300 --> 01:02:56,740
Yes, and several people with the same face.

1721
01:02:56,740 --> 01:02:58,260
It's confusing. Yes.

1722
01:02:58,260 --> 01:03:02,860
So OK, Drawn to the Magic was a show where animators sing and dance

1723
01:03:02,860 --> 01:03:06,660
and then draw on a piece of paper and then the drawing comes down

1724
01:03:06,660 --> 01:03:08,580
and then the real character is there. Yes.

1725
01:03:08,580 --> 01:03:11,620
OK. Uh huh. And like Aurora's in that.

1726
01:03:11,620 --> 01:03:14,380
You do the Aurora or Cinderella were interchangeable.

1727
01:03:14,380 --> 01:03:15,420
And then there's a Mickey.

1728
01:03:15,420 --> 01:03:17,940
And then I think it was either like a Woody or a Goofy.

1729
01:03:18,060 --> 01:03:19,700
OK, sure. Sure.

1730
01:03:21,860 --> 01:03:26,220
How did that one rank amidst a strong show?

1731
01:03:26,700 --> 01:03:30,380
I would say it's like a mid to low level show.

1732
01:03:30,820 --> 01:03:34,860
I mean, it was exciting, I guess, when we came out, but not really.

1733
01:03:35,340 --> 01:03:37,020
And then we would just do a little meet and greet.

1734
01:03:37,020 --> 01:03:40,740
So, yeah, that one, I mean, I think it was just kind of a time killer.

1735
01:03:40,820 --> 01:03:46,300
All of early California Adventure seems like sort of curb expectations.

1736
01:03:46,300 --> 01:03:49,100
Like this is fine. You'll see something. That's fine.

1737
01:03:49,700 --> 01:03:52,220
Definitely. Were you there like you were there

1738
01:03:52,220 --> 01:03:53,980
then when California Adventure opened?

1739
01:03:53,980 --> 01:03:56,420
I believe I was. What year did that open?

1740
01:03:56,420 --> 01:03:58,020
Do you know? 2001.

1741
01:03:58,020 --> 01:04:00,300
Yeah, I think I would have like just started working there.

1742
01:04:01,260 --> 01:04:05,860
Did you sense that a general feeling of like, oh, like this is

1743
01:04:06,980 --> 01:04:08,260
some problems here?

1744
01:04:08,260 --> 01:04:11,740
I loved California Adventure right off the bat.

1745
01:04:11,740 --> 01:04:13,020
I did. Yeah.

1746
01:04:13,020 --> 01:04:16,700
I mean, I guess I'm just I liked the roller coaster a lot.

1747
01:04:16,700 --> 01:04:19,260
I loved Soarin when it first opened.

1748
01:04:19,260 --> 01:04:20,820
I don't care for it now.

1749
01:04:20,820 --> 01:04:24,220
Oh, you're a California purist. Yeah, sure. Sure.

1750
01:04:25,180 --> 01:04:28,500
And so I really liked California Adventure.

1751
01:04:28,540 --> 01:04:31,380
And I think it's just because I was excited to have another theme park

1752
01:04:31,380 --> 01:04:33,700
in my backyard, basically. Sure. Yeah.

1753
01:04:33,700 --> 01:04:38,340
So I wasn't I didn't have a real refined theme park palette back then.

1754
01:04:39,020 --> 01:04:40,380
Now I see the flaws.

1755
01:04:40,380 --> 01:04:43,740
But at the time, I was just, you know, grateful to have an upside down ride.

1756
01:04:44,180 --> 01:04:45,500
Oh, yeah, that's true.

1757
01:04:45,500 --> 01:04:48,100
Not one on the on the Disney property. Yeah.

1758
01:04:48,100 --> 01:04:52,260
Was it was Disney Sea open by the time you worked in Japan?

1759
01:04:52,580 --> 01:04:54,620
Yeah, Disney Sea was open. Sure.

1760
01:04:54,620 --> 01:04:58,420
So that's a mind blow that you're that you are there every day.

1761
01:04:58,420 --> 01:05:00,180
Is our dream.

1762
01:05:00,180 --> 01:05:03,260
You live in a game of thrones when you go into it.

1763
01:05:03,260 --> 01:05:06,100
Disney Sea. Yeah, it's incredible. Absolutely.

1764
01:05:06,140 --> 01:05:07,580
Yeah. Yeah. So epic.

1765
01:05:07,580 --> 01:05:09,220
We always say there's like no or Mike.

1766
01:05:09,220 --> 01:05:12,140
Mike had said that you can't take a bad picture in there.

1767
01:05:12,420 --> 01:05:13,700
It's crazy. It's impossible.

1768
01:05:13,700 --> 01:05:16,740
Yeah. When you're comparing California Adventure to Disney Sea, I mean, yeah.

1769
01:05:17,140 --> 01:05:18,500
Makes me want to throw up.

1770
01:05:19,500 --> 01:05:22,300
And we got what? Yeah.

1771
01:05:23,180 --> 01:05:25,340
They tried to hide it from the Americans, though.

1772
01:05:25,620 --> 01:05:27,260
I feel like, yeah, that's kind of true.

1773
01:05:27,260 --> 01:05:31,100
Yeah, you think that how like I wasn't even aware it was built at the time.

1774
01:05:31,100 --> 01:05:32,820
You would think there would have been a big thing like this.

1775
01:05:32,820 --> 01:05:35,180
Go visit this wonderful park overseas.

1776
01:05:35,180 --> 01:05:38,540
But it was like, don't let them see what we did. Right. Right.

1777
01:05:39,300 --> 01:05:40,300
We don't want them to know.

1778
01:05:40,300 --> 01:05:41,940
We put up all our own money.

1779
01:05:41,940 --> 01:05:44,060
This is we get to use it. Yeah.

1780
01:05:44,100 --> 01:05:45,420
There's like a special I found.

1781
01:05:45,420 --> 01:05:47,700
There's like some travel channel special on it on YouTube.

1782
01:05:47,700 --> 01:05:51,980
And I was like, this was not broadcast far and wide over here.

1783
01:05:51,980 --> 01:05:55,500
Your parents not trying to let trying to not show you that other people

1784
01:05:55,500 --> 01:05:58,140
are way richer than you. Yes. Right.

1785
01:05:58,700 --> 01:06:00,380
Yeah, we're all the same.

1786
01:06:00,380 --> 01:06:01,220
Shield them.

1787
01:06:01,220 --> 01:06:03,780
It was also like Hong Kong Disney, which opened in 2005.

1788
01:06:04,340 --> 01:06:06,580
I didn't know that existed for.

1789
01:06:06,580 --> 01:06:08,780
All not for years, at least.

1790
01:06:08,820 --> 01:06:11,540
Well, I didn't know that's when I had a couple of girlfriends

1791
01:06:11,540 --> 01:06:16,700
who did the Hong Kong Disney circuit as well and who were there for the opening of it.

1792
01:06:16,700 --> 01:06:19,260
And I mean, talk about crazy stories.

1793
01:06:19,260 --> 01:06:21,500
I mean, it sounded like hellish.

1794
01:06:21,500 --> 01:06:25,660
They just did not know what to do with the princesses.

1795
01:06:25,660 --> 01:06:29,940
Like it's just they just have the craziest in terms of.

1796
01:06:30,860 --> 01:06:34,100
They didn't have an established program, so it was a mess.

1797
01:06:34,100 --> 01:06:37,140
Yeah. And I just think there were some like cultural differences

1798
01:06:37,140 --> 01:06:39,700
where like it didn't really translate.

1799
01:06:39,700 --> 01:06:43,500
And yeah, it was it was an interesting experience.

1800
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:46,780
I think they have it all worked out now and now it's like a OK place to work.

1801
01:06:46,780 --> 01:06:49,780
But yeah, at first I think it was just kind of nuts.

1802
01:06:49,980 --> 01:06:53,300
Is there like you have like a craziest day at working?

1803
01:06:53,540 --> 01:06:55,740
Do you that comes to mind?

1804
01:06:55,740 --> 01:06:58,620
Oh, I had one day that was really crazy because I got heckled

1805
01:06:59,460 --> 01:07:02,020
by this old man.

1806
01:07:03,460 --> 01:07:04,300
I was working.

1807
01:07:04,300 --> 01:07:07,580
Sometimes you would have a set at the front gate, which is when you first walk

1808
01:07:07,580 --> 01:07:11,260
in that little area before the where the train and like the flowers are.

1809
01:07:12,340 --> 01:07:14,220
And you would sometimes have to do a set there.

1810
01:07:14,220 --> 01:07:16,660
And it was always really chaotic because people would just like,

1811
01:07:16,780 --> 01:07:20,100
oh, like swarm you trying to get a picture real quick before they

1812
01:07:20,300 --> 01:07:21,180
went into the park.

1813
01:07:21,180 --> 01:07:23,540
So like no one wanted a fun, magical moment.

1814
01:07:23,540 --> 01:07:26,540
They just were like, get her.

1815
01:07:26,540 --> 01:07:29,420
And you would be sent there without any sort of assistant.

1816
01:07:29,420 --> 01:07:32,060
You normally would have a host with you who would help you kind of control

1817
01:07:32,060 --> 01:07:34,620
the crowd, but they would just send you out there on your own.

1818
01:07:34,620 --> 01:07:37,540
So I was just like, I had this circle of like a hundred people surrounding me.

1819
01:07:37,540 --> 01:07:41,540
And you have to be like trying to control them and still be polite and like pleasant.

1820
01:07:41,700 --> 01:07:44,060
And I was already getting really sort of overwhelmed.

1821
01:07:44,100 --> 01:07:46,500
And they tell you if you're about to snap,

1822
01:07:46,780 --> 01:07:49,540
you're allowed to go take a people break is what it's called.

1823
01:07:49,540 --> 01:07:53,820
So you can go like stand off stage, be like, excuse me, I need to go,

1824
01:07:53,820 --> 01:07:56,660
you know, talk to Mickey or whatever.

1825
01:07:56,980 --> 01:07:59,540
And then you'd go just like stand off stage and collect yourself

1826
01:07:59,540 --> 01:08:01,220
and then come back out because they don't want you to.

1827
01:08:01,220 --> 01:08:03,300
They understand you can be pushed to your limits.

1828
01:08:03,300 --> 01:08:06,500
Yeah. So I was kind of like almost about to take a people break

1829
01:08:06,620 --> 01:08:09,620
when this old man just starts shouting from the crowd.

1830
01:08:09,620 --> 01:08:10,740
He's kind of or he's not even shutting.

1831
01:08:10,740 --> 01:08:12,540
He's just standing there off to the side.

1832
01:08:12,540 --> 01:08:15,380
Cinderella, your mascara is running.

1833
01:08:15,900 --> 01:08:18,140
And I remember just being like looking at him like,

1834
01:08:18,740 --> 01:08:20,460
I don't know what he's talking about.

1835
01:08:20,460 --> 01:08:25,620
And and then he started saying like, my granddaughter is prettier than you.

1836
01:08:25,620 --> 01:08:27,180
Like, it was just really weird stuff.

1837
01:08:27,180 --> 01:08:29,940
It didn't make sense that he was just full on like heckling me.

1838
01:08:30,180 --> 01:08:32,500
And a couple of the moms were kind of looking at him like,

1839
01:08:33,100 --> 01:08:35,140
do we need to like get involved?

1840
01:08:35,140 --> 01:08:38,140
And he just he kept saying all these really weird things.

1841
01:08:38,140 --> 01:08:40,780
And I just burst out in tears and ran off.

1842
01:08:40,780 --> 01:08:43,180
Oh, my God. Oh, my goodness.

1843
01:08:43,180 --> 01:08:44,780
Ran off set.

1844
01:08:44,780 --> 01:08:46,420
She's what a ghoul.

1845
01:08:46,420 --> 01:08:48,580
It was really I don't know what was going on.

1846
01:08:48,580 --> 01:08:51,660
I feel like he had escaped from somewhere.

1847
01:08:51,660 --> 01:08:53,020
You know, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1848
01:08:53,020 --> 01:08:54,780
Like some sort of center.

1849
01:08:54,780 --> 01:08:57,860
Or like there was a bus that like had a like the flat tire

1850
01:08:57,860 --> 01:09:00,100
and like he snuck off the bus into Disneyland.

1851
01:09:00,500 --> 01:09:02,940
Yeah. Knocked someone over the head and took their clothes.

1852
01:09:02,940 --> 01:09:05,060
He was like an escaped convict or something. Sure.

1853
01:09:06,820 --> 01:09:08,300
Finally, a target.

1854
01:09:08,300 --> 01:09:10,300
And I'm assuming you didn't have any time to like say,

1855
01:09:10,300 --> 01:09:12,500
I have to go talk to Mickey before you ran away.

1856
01:09:12,860 --> 01:09:15,580
No, I just I think I just started out of there.

1857
01:09:15,580 --> 01:09:17,380
I have to talk to her.

1858
01:09:17,380 --> 01:09:19,700
Screaming like.

1859
01:09:19,700 --> 01:09:22,500
Luckily, in those movies, a lot of princesses running.

1860
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:25,020
So they probably just thought like, oh, like the movie.

1861
01:09:25,020 --> 01:09:26,300
It's great. Running away.

1862
01:09:26,300 --> 01:09:28,740
Oh, yeah. The clock's about to strike midnight.

1863
01:09:28,740 --> 01:09:31,900
It's like nine. Yeah, it is.

1864
01:09:32,300 --> 01:09:34,620
She's on a different time, I guess.

1865
01:09:34,620 --> 01:09:38,100
You also when we were emailing, you alluded to the the Plaza Inn

1866
01:09:38,660 --> 01:09:41,380
being a less than

1867
01:09:41,380 --> 01:09:44,020
a great place to do this.

1868
01:09:44,220 --> 01:09:47,300
My memory about the Plaza Inn is kind of fuzzy, but all I remember is

1869
01:09:47,300 --> 01:09:51,020
there was like a year when they were making us work at the Plaza Inn,

1870
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:53,300
which is, you know, the dining.

1871
01:09:53,300 --> 01:09:55,500
It's like a buffet, I think.

1872
01:09:55,500 --> 01:09:57,660
Main Street restaurants. Yeah.

1873
01:09:57,660 --> 01:10:02,860
And for some reason, it was so terrible working there.

1874
01:10:03,100 --> 01:10:06,420
And I think there was some sort of there was some reason why they had put us there,

1875
01:10:06,580 --> 01:10:09,340
because there was construction happening somewhere else or something was

1876
01:10:09,660 --> 01:10:12,820
going on at the Plaza Inn where they needed to kind of like make up for something.

1877
01:10:13,140 --> 01:10:15,180
And so they had us there, but it was the worst place to work

1878
01:10:15,180 --> 01:10:18,580
because it wasn't advertised as a character dining experience.

1879
01:10:18,580 --> 01:10:20,700
So no one wanted to see you.

1880
01:10:20,700 --> 01:10:23,420
And you just kind of had to stand there and everyone was really mean.

1881
01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:27,060
And so at the end of the year, the people who worked there a lot

1882
01:10:27,060 --> 01:10:29,780
got like a bonus, like an apology bonus.

1883
01:10:29,820 --> 01:10:32,420
Wow. Wow. Yeah. Wow. All right.

1884
01:10:33,540 --> 01:10:36,140
For enduring the smell of fried chicken.

1885
01:10:36,140 --> 01:10:36,980
Yeah.

1886
01:10:38,340 --> 01:10:39,740
It is good fried chicken.

1887
01:10:39,740 --> 01:10:43,060
But yeah, actually, the fettuccine alfredo is pretty good, too.

1888
01:10:43,500 --> 01:10:45,380
Yeah. That's interesting.

1889
01:10:45,380 --> 01:10:47,100
But being around it all day, every day.

1890
01:10:47,100 --> 01:10:49,020
No, it was tough. Yeah.

1891
01:10:49,020 --> 01:10:53,740
Did you see a difference like in the over the years in the average guests?

1892
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:57,820
Like types of like, is it less families, more

1893
01:10:58,540 --> 01:11:01,420
childless men in their 30s coming to the park?

1894
01:11:01,660 --> 01:11:04,860
Was there any difference you could spot or was it basically consistent?

1895
01:11:05,700 --> 01:11:07,860
I think it was basically consistent.

1896
01:11:07,860 --> 01:11:13,060
I mean, you always you know, it's always a big diverse group of people.

1897
01:11:14,340 --> 01:11:18,140
I mean, I think the only real difference I did kind of see

1898
01:11:18,140 --> 01:11:21,660
is people more just like out to get the picture and the autograph and like less

1899
01:11:22,180 --> 01:11:25,540
people wanting to have, you know, sort of just like an interaction.

1900
01:11:25,860 --> 01:11:29,940
However, that might have been an idea that was implanted in my brain by other people.

1901
01:11:30,180 --> 01:11:31,220
Like, you know what I mean?

1902
01:11:31,220 --> 01:11:33,620
Like, I feel like that was always something people were saying.

1903
01:11:33,620 --> 01:11:37,500
But I don't honestly know if that was really the case.

1904
01:11:37,980 --> 01:11:40,020
Yeah. It was like some corporate story.

1905
01:11:40,180 --> 01:11:43,500
Yeah. Some corporate idea that they sort of like were pushing.

1906
01:11:43,700 --> 01:11:47,940
Yeah. Or like the like some cast members who were like too into the job

1907
01:11:47,940 --> 01:11:50,060
were saying that, you know.

1908
01:11:50,060 --> 01:11:53,860
But there are always people who like, oh, there's a lot of guys there,

1909
01:11:53,860 --> 01:11:59,140
I think that go on their own, you know, the annual pass holders.

1910
01:11:59,140 --> 01:12:00,300
Like, yes. Yeah.

1911
01:12:00,300 --> 01:12:02,500
I just feel like that was just like, oh, there isn't.

1912
01:12:02,500 --> 01:12:05,020
That's an AP. Sure. Yeah.

1913
01:12:05,020 --> 01:12:06,820
Right. Which is us.

1914
01:12:06,820 --> 01:12:08,420
Yeah, we've all done it. Yeah.

1915
01:12:08,420 --> 01:12:09,220
Yeah. Oh, for sure.

1916
01:12:09,220 --> 01:12:13,100
I mean, there's also a whole lot of people who have special needs.

1917
01:12:13,100 --> 01:12:15,340
And it's cheaper and adults.

1918
01:12:15,340 --> 01:12:18,500
It's cheaper for cheaper for their families to just get them annual passes

1919
01:12:18,500 --> 01:12:20,900
than to put them in any sort of care.

1920
01:12:20,900 --> 01:12:23,940
So you get a lot of people who are dropped off there every day

1921
01:12:23,940 --> 01:12:26,300
and just hang out at the park all day.

1922
01:12:26,300 --> 01:12:27,660
Talked about this, I think. Yeah.

1923
01:12:27,660 --> 01:12:30,260
Because it's kind of a place you could trust a safe space.

1924
01:12:30,260 --> 01:12:33,260
So you have those people who you get to know as well.

1925
01:12:33,660 --> 01:12:35,780
Oh, that's nice. Yeah.

1926
01:12:35,780 --> 01:12:36,660
Were there any regs?

1927
01:12:36,660 --> 01:12:39,900
Because there are other regulars who they're an older couple

1928
01:12:39,900 --> 01:12:43,260
who go on Peter Pan every night. Whoa.

1929
01:12:43,260 --> 01:12:45,020
Like, I think that's right.

1930
01:12:45,020 --> 01:12:47,780
I think I don't know if they're still doing it, but like supposedly for years

1931
01:12:47,780 --> 01:12:51,660
and years, and I feel like I read something about like if they would say

1932
01:12:51,660 --> 01:12:55,300
they were in line and then a person got in line behind them

1933
01:12:55,300 --> 01:12:57,340
at the end of the night, they would be like, no, no, please.

1934
01:12:57,340 --> 01:12:59,580
Like you go because they want to be the last ones.

1935
01:12:59,580 --> 01:13:00,860
Oh, how funny.

1936
01:13:00,860 --> 01:13:02,820
Yeah. Did you run into anyone like that?

1937
01:13:02,820 --> 01:13:06,940
I mean, we had a guy who had come in from Arizona like a couple of times a year.

1938
01:13:07,460 --> 01:13:08,940
And he was like this.

1939
01:13:08,940 --> 01:13:11,340
There was something going on there, but he'd come in with his mom.

1940
01:13:11,500 --> 01:13:17,300
He was maybe in his late mid 20s and he'd always bring all these brand new sharpies

1941
01:13:17,780 --> 01:13:19,980
and he'd give you one.

1942
01:13:19,980 --> 01:13:23,060
So you always got to pick like a nice new sharpie.

1943
01:13:23,580 --> 01:13:25,780
Oh, scented or plain?

1944
01:13:25,780 --> 01:13:27,980
No, just plain. That's right.

1945
01:13:27,980 --> 01:13:29,140
You could get the high.

1946
01:13:29,140 --> 01:13:30,220
You could get high from it.

1947
01:13:30,220 --> 01:13:31,340
Oh, sure. Yeah.

1948
01:13:31,340 --> 01:13:32,860
That's what he's trying to. Yeah.

1949
01:13:32,860 --> 01:13:34,700
And then there was Mr. Tuesday.

1950
01:13:34,700 --> 01:13:37,820
So he would come every Tuesday.

1951
01:13:37,820 --> 01:13:40,020
And yeah, actually, he has a really sad story.

1952
01:13:40,020 --> 01:13:42,260
So he ended up passing away.

1953
01:13:42,940 --> 01:13:45,900
Yeah. But anyway, he would come every Tuesday for a long time.

1954
01:13:46,780 --> 01:13:48,420
And I guess he was in recovery.

1955
01:13:48,420 --> 01:13:53,300
So this was like part of his recovery was to come every Tuesday to Disneyland.

1956
01:13:53,980 --> 01:13:57,900
Yeah. So there's all types of oh, there was someone named Norma.

1957
01:13:57,900 --> 01:14:01,900
I think her name was Norma and she was this like old kind of old broad.

1958
01:14:01,900 --> 01:14:03,180
And she was just like, what?

1959
01:14:03,180 --> 01:14:05,380
Aggressively flirt with Hercules.

1960
01:14:06,540 --> 01:14:08,740
Like really hard. Wow.

1961
01:14:10,020 --> 01:14:11,460
Wow. Follow him around.

1962
01:14:11,460 --> 01:14:12,900
His cast of characters.

1963
01:14:12,900 --> 01:14:14,980
Norma would flirt with Hercules.

1964
01:14:14,980 --> 01:14:16,380
Yeah. Huh?

1965
01:14:16,380 --> 01:14:18,980
Interesting. The regulars are interesting to hear about.

1966
01:14:18,980 --> 01:14:21,100
But if you had to hang out with the regular.

1967
01:14:21,100 --> 01:14:23,060
I mean, Mr. Tuesday is a great name.

1968
01:14:23,060 --> 01:14:24,980
Yeah. I was reacting to that.

1969
01:14:24,980 --> 01:14:26,740
Oh, no, he was nice.

1970
01:14:26,740 --> 01:14:27,900
Oh, yeah, it was that. Yeah.

1971
01:14:27,900 --> 01:14:28,820
It was a sad case.

1972
01:14:28,820 --> 01:14:30,340
But, you know, he loved coming to Disney.

1973
01:14:30,340 --> 01:14:34,220
So sure. I wonder like I have been to especially this year.

1974
01:14:34,220 --> 01:14:36,060
I've been a lot alone to Disney.

1975
01:14:36,060 --> 01:14:39,980
I wonder, do I have some nickname name among the people who work there?

1976
01:14:40,020 --> 01:14:41,740
You might be Mr. Laptop.

1977
01:14:41,740 --> 01:14:44,500
If you're working because I've been working around there.

1978
01:14:44,540 --> 01:14:45,420
That's cool.

1979
01:14:45,420 --> 01:14:46,420
Dipshit.

1980
01:14:47,420 --> 01:14:49,340
I mean, I'm sure people are recognizing you.

1981
01:14:49,340 --> 01:14:51,260
If you come and you kind of do the same thing.

1982
01:14:51,260 --> 01:14:53,340
I mean, like people pay attention to the guy.

1983
01:14:53,340 --> 01:14:55,380
Yeah, it's not that frequent.

1984
01:14:55,420 --> 01:14:57,340
But maybe. Yeah.

1985
01:14:57,340 --> 01:14:59,220
Maybe I have nothing wrong with it.

1986
01:14:59,220 --> 01:15:02,020
And some of the some of the regulars are really cool.

1987
01:15:02,420 --> 01:15:04,460
Yeah. Well, we'll see.

1988
01:15:04,460 --> 01:15:07,300
If anyone's out there that works there that knows that I'm there,

1989
01:15:07,300 --> 01:15:08,140
do I have a nickname?

1990
01:15:08,140 --> 01:15:11,060
Just answer. Some people think you're playing close like a cop.

1991
01:15:11,300 --> 01:15:13,660
Yeah. You're the undercover security.

1992
01:15:13,660 --> 01:15:15,580
I do look uptight like some sort of narc.

1993
01:15:15,580 --> 01:15:17,620
Busting people with the edibles in line.

1994
01:15:21,140 --> 01:15:23,580
That would be cool, honestly, if they thought I was a cop.

1995
01:15:23,580 --> 01:15:25,020
Yeah, that would kind of be like me.

1996
01:15:25,020 --> 01:15:26,420
You have a little spring in my step.

1997
01:15:26,420 --> 01:15:27,700
Yeah. Anyway, we'll see.

1998
01:15:27,700 --> 01:15:29,420
Undercover cop is a podcast.

1999
01:15:31,420 --> 01:15:33,060
I thought he was just an insane guy.

2000
01:15:33,060 --> 01:15:33,940
Yeah, no.

2001
01:15:34,940 --> 01:15:36,340
He does some of his life.

2002
01:15:36,340 --> 01:15:37,140
What have we not covered?

2003
01:15:37,140 --> 01:15:37,940
Yeah, you also did.

2004
01:15:37,940 --> 01:15:43,260
You said you did some things outside of Princess World at Universal.

2005
01:15:43,260 --> 01:15:45,660
You hosted the special effects stage.

2006
01:15:45,660 --> 01:15:47,940
Yeah, the special effects show.

2007
01:15:47,940 --> 01:15:48,700
Uh huh.

2008
01:15:49,260 --> 01:15:53,580
Was that a in the chronology?

2009
01:15:53,580 --> 01:15:55,940
Or what what were you pushing at that time?

2010
01:15:55,940 --> 01:16:01,100
Or is it is it the Statue of Liberty Hitchcock thing?

2011
01:16:01,100 --> 01:16:02,460
I have been removed.

2012
01:16:02,460 --> 01:16:06,980
So for me, it was a lot of minions and paranormal.

2013
01:16:07,460 --> 01:16:09,820
Oh, that's really specific.

2014
01:16:09,820 --> 01:16:13,660
Yeah, you might be the only person who has a strong feeling.

2015
01:16:13,660 --> 01:16:17,020
The werewolf, the werewolf that the kid controls with the.

2016
01:16:17,020 --> 01:16:18,100
That was gone.

2017
01:16:18,260 --> 01:16:18,940
That was gone.

2018
01:16:18,940 --> 01:16:19,700
I don't know.

2019
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:20,780
No, no, no. That was there.

2020
01:16:20,780 --> 01:16:23,060
And that was when the werewolf stances jump out.

2021
01:16:23,060 --> 01:16:24,580
I know.

2022
01:16:24,580 --> 01:16:25,660
No, no, no. This is the one.

2023
01:16:25,660 --> 01:16:29,140
When I was there was the guy would come out in the green suit

2024
01:16:29,140 --> 01:16:32,260
and pretend to be like motion capturing.

2025
01:16:33,180 --> 01:16:37,180
And then I think I forget what was actually you would see like an alien

2026
01:16:37,180 --> 01:16:39,820
or some monster doing what he was doing.

2027
01:16:39,820 --> 01:16:41,940
It was sort of a fake mocap.

2028
01:16:41,940 --> 01:16:43,700
Yes, that's what it was.

2029
01:16:43,700 --> 01:16:46,140
Yeah. But the special effects show was so challenging.

2030
01:16:46,140 --> 01:16:48,860
I was terrible at it because there was just so much

2031
01:16:48,860 --> 01:16:51,980
like made up jargon you had to memorize.

2032
01:16:51,980 --> 01:16:54,540
And it was all really like the special effects.

2033
01:16:54,540 --> 01:16:57,180
I mean, it wasn't exactly cutting edge.

2034
01:16:57,180 --> 01:17:00,020
Yeah. So but still to me, it was mind boggling

2035
01:17:00,020 --> 01:17:03,380
because I don't understand any of that stuff.

2036
01:17:03,380 --> 01:17:06,220
But just having to like come out and get like a crowd hyped, like,

2037
01:17:06,460 --> 01:17:09,220
hey, everybody, how are you doing today?

2038
01:17:09,340 --> 01:17:10,780
I can't hear you.

2039
01:17:10,780 --> 01:17:13,660
Like, that's so not my energy.

2040
01:17:13,660 --> 01:17:18,060
So I was just like that was the very end of my theme park career.

2041
01:17:18,060 --> 01:17:21,860
I think once I I got that job, I did maybe a couple of shows.

2042
01:17:21,860 --> 01:17:24,860
And then I was just like, I just this isn't right.

2043
01:17:25,980 --> 01:17:27,540
This isn't a forever thing.

2044
01:17:27,540 --> 01:17:29,660
This isn't this one's not for me.

2045
01:17:29,660 --> 01:17:32,380
So I didn't flourish in the special effects show.

2046
01:17:32,700 --> 01:17:34,740
Well, those kinds of

2047
01:17:35,420 --> 01:17:40,180
those I've talked about the show, this Disney afternoon live show in Florida

2048
01:17:40,660 --> 01:17:43,540
hosted by CJ, who I was dying.

2049
01:17:43,540 --> 01:17:45,380
I was not really characterized.

2050
01:17:45,380 --> 01:17:51,180
She had a cap and a headset mic and seemed to be cool or self assured.

2051
01:17:51,180 --> 01:17:54,700
And I don't know what you're supposed to just like CJ off the bat.

2052
01:17:54,700 --> 01:17:56,100
And I'm not sure why.

2053
01:17:56,100 --> 01:17:59,100
I only remember all this because my dad after every show, like,

2054
01:17:59,220 --> 01:18:00,820
I'm going to see that CJ show again.

2055
01:18:00,820 --> 01:18:02,140
I kind of like the CJ.

2056
01:18:02,140 --> 01:18:03,980
Your dad was in love with CJ.

2057
01:18:03,980 --> 01:18:07,100
I really need to cover the CJ thing in full.

2058
01:18:07,220 --> 01:18:10,140
But I what you're describing in the special effects show, like,

2059
01:18:10,500 --> 01:18:12,460
like why like, what are you?

2060
01:18:12,460 --> 01:18:15,100
Are you you're like the production helper?

2061
01:18:15,100 --> 01:18:17,420
You're there's like nothing when you're a princess.

2062
01:18:17,420 --> 01:18:18,740
Everybody. Oh, I know her.

2063
01:18:18,740 --> 01:18:23,060
You had to like out of the gate, like I'm this made up thing and you love me.

2064
01:18:23,060 --> 01:18:27,660
Right. Yeah, it was like I was supposed to be like the young tech one.

2065
01:18:27,660 --> 01:18:31,540
And then there was like a slightly older man with like a corduroy blazer

2066
01:18:31,540 --> 01:18:35,340
who was supposed to be like, but what a remember from Hitchcock.

2067
01:18:35,620 --> 01:18:39,140
And I would be like, well, now we have technology like

2068
01:18:40,820 --> 01:18:42,300
you know, rear screen.

2069
01:18:42,300 --> 01:18:45,700
It was just like I literally don't remember a word of that show.

2070
01:18:45,700 --> 01:18:46,820
It was like my memory.

2071
01:18:46,820 --> 01:18:49,740
It's like something that my body has just blocked out for me.

2072
01:18:52,100 --> 01:18:54,020
So what what are you portraying?

2073
01:18:54,020 --> 01:18:55,620
There's nothing like that in the world.

2074
01:18:55,620 --> 01:18:58,540
You don't go to work on a movie and there's that person around.

2075
01:18:58,540 --> 01:19:02,740
Like and then speaking of like the special needs people who had come to the park,

2076
01:19:02,980 --> 01:19:06,380
you'd have the same people who would come and sit front row

2077
01:19:06,660 --> 01:19:08,980
and want to volunteer.

2078
01:19:08,980 --> 01:19:10,980
And they were like the special needs people who'd come.

2079
01:19:10,980 --> 01:19:12,940
You'd see the same people at every show.

2080
01:19:12,940 --> 01:19:16,100
And so they kind of warned me before my first show, like, hey, they're going to be there.

2081
01:19:16,100 --> 01:19:17,020
They're going to want to volunteer.

2082
01:19:17,020 --> 01:19:18,020
But they come to every show.

2083
01:19:18,020 --> 01:19:23,140
So like we try not to choose them every time, you know, because like otherwise.

2084
01:19:23,180 --> 01:19:24,540
Like, but they're going to be right there.

2085
01:19:24,540 --> 01:19:26,780
So I was like, OK, OK.

2086
01:19:26,780 --> 01:19:29,620
And I got out there and I had to pick the volunteers, you know,

2087
01:19:29,620 --> 01:19:32,780
and I just got nervous and I picked this

2088
01:19:33,340 --> 01:19:37,820
all special needs people to be all the volunteers in the whole show.

2089
01:19:38,060 --> 01:19:42,420
And I just saw my co-host like his face just like stared at me like,

2090
01:19:42,980 --> 01:19:44,220
what have you done to me?

2091
01:19:44,220 --> 01:19:46,780
Because he's the one who has to kind of like instruct them what to do.

2092
01:19:46,780 --> 01:19:49,860
They have to hold these big tentacles to play this big sea monster.

2093
01:19:50,100 --> 01:19:52,180
And anyway, it ended up they ended up doing a good job.

2094
01:19:52,180 --> 01:19:55,340
But I think I was their favorite after that because

2095
01:19:56,460 --> 01:19:58,940
I chose them because I was like, this is so rude to just ignore them.

2096
01:19:58,940 --> 01:20:00,620
They're like, I'm like anyone in the back.

2097
01:20:00,620 --> 01:20:02,740
And they're like literally waving their hands in my face.

2098
01:20:02,740 --> 01:20:04,340
I'm like, you're right. You can do this.

2099
01:20:04,340 --> 01:20:06,780
This is rocket science. Like you'll be fine.

2100
01:20:07,940 --> 01:20:09,100
And then you covered them.

2101
01:20:09,100 --> 01:20:11,980
Then you never had to pick those specific people again.

2102
01:20:11,980 --> 01:20:16,380
I know. What a strength was it in the castle theater?

2103
01:20:16,380 --> 01:20:19,180
Was it down in the lower lot?

2104
01:20:19,180 --> 01:20:21,740
Yeah, it was kind of on the way to the tram.

2105
01:20:21,780 --> 01:20:24,460
So it has its own theater. It's like this huge theater.

2106
01:20:24,500 --> 01:20:26,740
Yeah. I'm kind of like the Simpsons.

2107
01:20:26,740 --> 01:20:27,740
OK, yeah. Yeah.

2108
01:20:27,740 --> 01:20:30,780
Oh, yeah. Yeah. I never saw it up there at some point.

2109
01:20:30,780 --> 01:20:34,220
For a long time, it was next to back draft on the lower lot.

2110
01:20:34,220 --> 01:20:37,140
Yeah. Yeah. Beetlejuice was there for a while.

2111
01:20:37,380 --> 01:20:39,340
Yeah, I guess I lost interest in that.

2112
01:20:39,340 --> 01:20:41,460
I never saw the latter day at a raise.

2113
01:20:41,540 --> 01:20:43,500
They still do it. They do. Yeah.

2114
01:20:43,500 --> 01:20:45,660
Do they? It was running the other day.

2115
01:20:45,700 --> 01:20:48,180
Oh, yeah, they definitely I know they still do it.

2116
01:20:48,220 --> 01:20:49,780
That's where the short lived

2117
01:20:49,780 --> 01:20:51,780
creature from the Black Lagoon musical.

2118
01:20:52,820 --> 01:20:54,980
That is practically a hate crime.

2119
01:20:54,980 --> 01:20:57,660
Yeah, that was an iconic failure.

2120
01:20:57,700 --> 01:20:59,660
Yeah. Spectacular failure.

2121
01:20:59,660 --> 01:21:00,900
Yeah. Right. Yeah.

2122
01:21:00,900 --> 01:21:02,780
And Spider-Man rocks. Same place.

2123
01:21:02,780 --> 01:21:04,500
Spider-Man rocks. Yeah. Boy.

2124
01:21:04,500 --> 01:21:07,140
When Universal fails, they fail.

2125
01:21:07,460 --> 01:21:08,820
They do it really well. Yeah.

2126
01:21:08,820 --> 01:21:09,700
They swing big.

2127
01:21:09,700 --> 01:21:12,540
May it made Spider-Man rocks look like Kamlet.

2128
01:21:12,740 --> 01:21:16,540
Yeah, I went to like an employee like preview of it.

2129
01:21:16,540 --> 01:21:17,780
They still work there.

2130
01:21:17,780 --> 01:21:20,100
It was to judge everyone.

2131
01:21:20,100 --> 01:21:23,340
Everyone walking out was like, how could that like that was there?

2132
01:21:23,340 --> 01:21:24,900
That was on the cover of the map.

2133
01:21:24,900 --> 01:21:29,260
That was like the new thing, like creature from the Black Lagoon, the musical.

2134
01:21:29,260 --> 01:21:30,860
Man, I think that's it.

2135
01:21:30,860 --> 01:21:32,140
We got to do a few.

2136
01:21:32,140 --> 01:21:34,460
Even in 2009, I was like, I don't know.

2137
01:21:34,460 --> 01:21:36,380
They should be telling that joke.

2138
01:21:36,380 --> 01:21:38,300
Like, I don't know, man.

2139
01:21:38,700 --> 01:21:41,340
Oh, yes.

2140
01:21:41,340 --> 01:21:44,340
I assume Universal wise, you're probably too young.

2141
01:21:44,340 --> 01:21:46,820
But was there ever any talk of you playing Lucille Ball?

2142
01:21:47,420 --> 01:21:51,020
Well, actually, they're really funny about their face characters.

2143
01:21:51,020 --> 01:21:53,940
So like, I think Marilyn and Lucy

2144
01:21:54,620 --> 01:21:57,340
have to be approved by the States.

2145
01:21:57,420 --> 01:21:59,100
Oh, wow. Yeah.

2146
01:21:59,100 --> 01:22:03,780
So maybe not Marilyn, but Lucy has to be approved by the estate.

2147
01:22:03,780 --> 01:22:05,980
So that's why there's really only one.

2148
01:22:05,980 --> 01:22:09,140
I think while I was there, there was one woman who had been doing it for a long time.

2149
01:22:09,380 --> 01:22:11,820
And then someone else got approved when I was there.

2150
01:22:11,820 --> 01:22:13,900
And it was kind of a big deal. Wow.

2151
01:22:13,900 --> 01:22:17,180
So, yeah, they're really picky about who plays.

2152
01:22:17,660 --> 01:22:21,580
They had the Lucy I've seen there is real good.

2153
01:22:21,580 --> 01:22:22,580
Yeah. Like you.

2154
01:22:22,580 --> 01:22:24,740
So I could see where. Yeah, that's interesting.

2155
01:22:24,740 --> 01:22:28,660
So much. But it's tougher to get the Lucy job than any of the Disney princesses.

2156
01:22:28,740 --> 01:22:31,340
Probably. Yeah, I would say so.

2157
01:22:31,580 --> 01:22:33,380
Yeah, I never did any face characters there.

2158
01:22:33,380 --> 01:22:36,700
I only did Agva performer stuff at Universal.

2159
01:22:36,700 --> 01:22:39,300
So I was something called a dino chaser.

2160
01:22:39,420 --> 01:22:41,900
My guys have ever talked to a dino chaser before.

2161
01:22:42,420 --> 01:22:45,780
They just was down by Jurassic Park with like dressed as a

2162
01:22:45,820 --> 01:22:48,580
I had this like little golf cart that kind of looked like a Jeep.

2163
01:22:48,580 --> 01:22:50,540
And it would play like the Jurassic Park music.

2164
01:22:50,540 --> 01:22:54,980
And I drove it around and then had half of like a weird animatronic dinosaur

2165
01:22:54,980 --> 01:22:57,620
I would control. And it was weird.

2166
01:22:57,620 --> 01:23:03,100
And then I did the British window and I did Grinchmas as well.

2167
01:23:03,460 --> 01:23:05,660
All right. Oh, sure. A who?

2168
01:23:05,660 --> 01:23:07,780
Oh, oh, so you had the snout.

2169
01:23:07,780 --> 01:23:09,940
Oh, yeah, it was horrible.

2170
01:23:09,940 --> 01:23:12,980
That was if you ever say that I did not pay my dues.

2171
01:23:13,620 --> 01:23:17,340
Let me tell you about Grinchmas because that was tough.

2172
01:23:17,820 --> 01:23:22,500
Self applying, awful, like nasal constricting. Horrible.

2173
01:23:22,500 --> 01:23:24,300
And then you would it was all during the winter.

2174
01:23:24,300 --> 01:23:27,220
So your nose would be running because it was cold.

2175
01:23:27,220 --> 01:23:31,620
So at the end of the eight hour shift, you'd lift up, like peel up the lip area

2176
01:23:31,620 --> 01:23:34,020
and it would just flood out. It was.

2177
01:23:34,020 --> 01:23:35,540
Oh, my God.

2178
01:23:35,540 --> 01:23:38,380
Horrible. It was torture.

2179
01:23:38,740 --> 01:23:41,620
Torture. She was all from this.

2180
01:23:41,900 --> 01:23:45,380
We talked to we did an episode about Grinchmas and the just that like

2181
01:23:45,620 --> 01:23:49,460
the choice in the in the making of the film that like, no, no, no.

2182
01:23:49,460 --> 01:23:51,620
They need big dog snouts.

2183
01:23:51,620 --> 01:23:56,900
Then leads to dozens of performers yearly on both coasts.

2184
01:23:56,900 --> 01:23:59,260
Having to wear these awful mechanism.

2185
01:23:59,260 --> 01:24:02,420
Why? Why can't they just be people? It was crazy.

2186
01:24:02,580 --> 01:24:04,260
Yeah, they have to.

2187
01:24:04,260 --> 01:24:06,340
The who's our dog ladies.

2188
01:24:06,340 --> 01:24:09,700
This is really important that they be upsetting.

2189
01:24:09,700 --> 01:24:11,780
How that looks? I do not like.

2190
01:24:11,780 --> 01:24:14,700
I had the pictures of myself with that. It's not right.

2191
01:24:14,700 --> 01:24:16,020
It is very unpleasant.

2192
01:24:16,020 --> 01:24:19,220
If you were handed a stack of those, you would slap it to the ground.

2193
01:24:19,220 --> 01:24:23,140
I'd run. Did you have a specific who or was it like random?

2194
01:24:23,340 --> 01:24:25,660
Oh, you work very hard to develop a character.

2195
01:24:25,700 --> 01:24:26,420
Really? Yeah.

2196
01:24:26,420 --> 01:24:31,340
So mine was like an ex beauty queen who I had like a candy cane suit

2197
01:24:31,940 --> 01:24:34,340
with fur trim and like this crazy red wig.

2198
01:24:34,540 --> 01:24:37,980
You're sort of like the Christine Baranski character.

2199
01:24:37,980 --> 01:24:40,580
Yeah, I'm like her her like friend.

2200
01:24:41,660 --> 01:24:43,020
Did you have a name as well?

2201
01:24:43,020 --> 01:24:45,340
I had a name, but I don't remember what it was.

2202
01:24:45,340 --> 01:24:49,140
Yeah. Is would you do like the Grinch meet and greet

2203
01:24:49,140 --> 01:24:52,820
or that show where the tram tour would drive by?

2204
01:24:52,860 --> 01:24:53,820
Yeah, not the show.

2205
01:24:53,820 --> 01:24:56,540
I was literally just like wandering around the snow zone.

2206
01:24:56,860 --> 01:24:58,380
OK. Snow zone.

2207
01:25:00,380 --> 01:25:02,980
It's just such a whimsical name said with so much disdain.

2208
01:25:04,220 --> 01:25:06,900
Another day in the snow zone.

2209
01:25:06,900 --> 01:25:11,340
It seems like you probably had to like you're in Disneyland

2210
01:25:11,340 --> 01:25:15,500
and people are pushing each other to the side to meet you like

2211
01:25:16,140 --> 01:25:17,940
Zinra Zinra Zinra.

2212
01:25:17,940 --> 01:25:22,060
Universalist like you are you more like forcing people to have this interaction

2213
01:25:22,220 --> 01:25:24,500
because somebody has paid for this.

2214
01:25:24,500 --> 01:25:27,220
And you aren't like famous like Cinderella.

2215
01:25:27,380 --> 01:25:29,860
They don't know. They don't know who the who is.

2216
01:25:30,300 --> 01:25:33,500
Also, like Universal, I don't know how they do it, but they just like

2217
01:25:34,020 --> 01:25:36,300
there's hundreds of you walking around.

2218
01:25:36,300 --> 01:25:39,020
It's like sometimes you're outnumbering the guests.

2219
01:25:39,020 --> 01:25:42,740
And so it's like people really don't care, which in some ways,

2220
01:25:42,740 --> 01:25:44,420
I mean, Universal is just a lot more relaxed.

2221
01:25:44,420 --> 01:25:47,700
So you would just kind of like talk to your who friends. Right.

2222
01:25:47,740 --> 01:25:49,820
Your who buddies. That counts as a shift.

2223
01:25:50,020 --> 01:25:51,380
Yeah. Just shoot the shit.

2224
01:25:51,380 --> 01:25:52,700
And like they don't care where you are.

2225
01:25:52,700 --> 01:25:55,260
You're just like roaming around. Right.

2226
01:25:55,460 --> 01:25:56,940
Could you go to like the lower lot?

2227
01:25:56,940 --> 01:25:59,060
Sometimes you just like ride the escalators.

2228
01:26:00,940 --> 01:26:03,500
Wow. Cool. Yeah.

2229
01:26:03,500 --> 01:26:06,180
Is there a craziest universal story?

2230
01:26:06,860 --> 01:26:09,540
Oh, my God. A universal.

2231
01:26:09,540 --> 01:26:11,860
Let me try to remember.

2232
01:26:13,300 --> 01:26:14,860
Just riding the escalator up and down.

2233
01:26:14,860 --> 01:26:17,740
There's mostly I mean, universal, like not a lot crazy.

2234
01:26:17,740 --> 01:26:19,100
Have you ever?

2235
01:26:19,740 --> 01:26:22,900
It's funny because you would think it would because it's more lax.

2236
01:26:22,900 --> 01:26:26,300
But the pressure cooker of Disney probably leads it to be more.

2237
01:26:26,300 --> 01:26:28,980
Disney is an event for people.

2238
01:26:28,980 --> 01:26:30,700
So it is a pressure cooker.

2239
01:26:30,700 --> 01:26:33,420
I think when you when you're at Universal, you've already done Disney.

2240
01:26:33,420 --> 01:26:35,820
You're probably a little white. Right. Yeah.

2241
01:26:35,900 --> 01:26:40,380
You know, I have I just recall being mellow and I'm like only

2242
01:26:40,660 --> 01:26:43,540
if one person smiled in the tram.

2243
01:26:43,540 --> 01:26:45,580
I was like, wow, I killed.

2244
01:26:45,580 --> 01:26:47,740
Yeah. But mostly they are not paying attention.

2245
01:26:47,740 --> 01:26:50,220
You realize they can't hear you that well.

2246
01:26:50,220 --> 01:26:52,780
And then employees, it's also you go back to that break room.

2247
01:26:52,780 --> 01:26:55,300
Nobody's it's not sad. It's just like, all right.

2248
01:26:55,780 --> 01:26:57,820
Yeah. It's a C plus five.

2249
01:26:57,860 --> 01:27:00,620
Totally. I mean, probably the craziest thing that happened to me at Universal

2250
01:27:00,620 --> 01:27:04,660
is like literally like falling in love with my husband, like on a balcony,

2251
01:27:04,660 --> 01:27:05,900
dressed as a British person.

2252
01:27:05,900 --> 01:27:07,340
That is pretty. Yeah, that's notable.

2253
01:27:07,340 --> 01:27:11,100
And just like sitting up there and like just I mean, we were just like

2254
01:27:11,100 --> 01:27:14,620
so into each other and like not doing our job at all.

2255
01:27:15,620 --> 01:27:20,500
Was it did it like cross the threshold where it was it literally like day one?

2256
01:27:20,500 --> 01:27:22,420
Oh, nice to meet you. Never met before.

2257
01:27:22,420 --> 01:27:25,700
And then like a month later, like, oh, our improv is a little flirty.

2258
01:27:25,940 --> 01:27:27,180
No, it was like instant.

2259
01:27:27,180 --> 01:27:29,100
It was on the first orientation day.

2260
01:27:29,100 --> 01:27:30,900
Whoa. That's why he said that, too.

2261
01:27:30,900 --> 01:27:33,580
I was curious to hear the other perspective. Yeah. Yeah.

2262
01:27:33,580 --> 01:27:35,500
That's great. That's insane.

2263
01:27:35,500 --> 01:27:38,900
No, it definitely was like love at first chit chat.

2264
01:27:39,460 --> 01:27:41,100
It's not like he thought that's what it was.

2265
01:27:41,100 --> 01:27:44,060
And then I'm like, you know, after, you know, I just recently fell in love with him.

2266
01:27:45,300 --> 01:27:46,700
Post marriage.

2267
01:27:46,700 --> 01:27:49,180
Or at least it happens.

2268
01:27:49,180 --> 01:27:50,580
Yeah, yeah, eventually.

2269
01:27:50,580 --> 01:27:51,300
So that's good.

2270
01:27:51,300 --> 01:27:54,980
Did you like then like change the characters to be like,

2271
01:27:55,340 --> 01:27:58,380
there were no real characters, the characters, those characters

2272
01:27:58,380 --> 01:28:01,060
are really underdeveloped.

2273
01:28:01,060 --> 01:28:03,660
Was the who character more developed than the British character?

2274
01:28:03,660 --> 01:28:05,580
Definitely. Yes. All right.

2275
01:28:05,580 --> 01:28:08,020
Well, there's like a specific place you come from.

2276
01:28:08,020 --> 01:28:08,900
Yeah. Yeah.

2277
01:28:08,900 --> 01:28:11,140
And there's another it is in the state there, too.

2278
01:28:11,300 --> 01:28:15,420
Of course. And the nose gives you like a weird character voice.

2279
01:28:15,500 --> 01:28:16,740
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

2280
01:28:16,740 --> 01:28:19,140
It's a little bit, you know, a dying person.

2281
01:28:19,300 --> 01:28:23,420
Yeah. If the shift isn't over in 90 minutes, you'll pass out.

2282
01:28:23,420 --> 01:28:25,940
A pretty unique character disease as well.

2283
01:28:25,940 --> 01:28:29,580
Bacterial infection known only to who performers.

2284
01:28:29,580 --> 01:28:30,820
That nose was a sponge.

2285
01:28:30,820 --> 01:28:32,340
It was pretty disgusting.

2286
01:28:32,340 --> 01:28:35,380
Yeah. Of all of these jobs,

2287
01:28:35,420 --> 01:28:38,700
Scott has talked about how he would like to maybe like one day a year

2288
01:28:38,700 --> 01:28:40,700
do his tram job still. Oh, yeah.

2289
01:28:40,700 --> 01:28:44,420
Is there anything where you like once in a while it would be fun

2290
01:28:44,420 --> 01:28:47,300
to like do this aspect or like is it? Yeah.

2291
01:28:47,580 --> 01:28:52,300
Yeah. I mean, I definitely would love to be a princess for a day again.

2292
01:28:52,340 --> 01:28:55,220
Like, I really that job was it was challenging.

2293
01:28:55,220 --> 01:28:57,780
I mean, I mean, obviously, it's not that hard.

2294
01:28:58,820 --> 01:29:02,620
You know, like a very literal it's it's not like operating a crane.

2295
01:29:02,620 --> 01:29:06,020
Yeah, it's a pretty cushy job that a lot of people would be

2296
01:29:06,180 --> 01:29:07,340
would really want to have.

2297
01:29:07,340 --> 01:29:10,220
So I would love to go work at Tokyo Disneyland.

2298
01:29:10,220 --> 01:29:12,900
Oh, yeah. I would honestly do that once a week.

2299
01:29:13,620 --> 01:29:16,060
Sure. Like for the rest of my life, I

2300
01:29:17,700 --> 01:29:19,620
you know, I just think that that was so fun.

2301
01:29:19,620 --> 01:29:24,820
And the kids, I mean, there's nothing cuter than a Japanese three year old.

2302
01:29:25,540 --> 01:29:29,500
I mean, they are so cute.

2303
01:29:30,180 --> 01:29:31,660
Who are there for you?

2304
01:29:31,660 --> 01:29:32,860
Yeah. And they love you.

2305
01:29:32,860 --> 01:29:35,220
You're number three almost.

2306
01:29:35,620 --> 01:29:39,060
And that really was like my only real brush with fame

2307
01:29:39,220 --> 01:29:41,380
was like being a Disneyland princess.

2308
01:29:41,380 --> 01:29:47,020
You know, it was like it was kind of a cool experience to have.

2309
01:29:47,020 --> 01:29:51,260
But yeah, just to be able to interact with the kids was would be really cool.

2310
01:29:51,260 --> 01:29:54,580
I would I would do that again, but not ever full time.

2311
01:29:54,580 --> 01:29:56,420
And also, I've aged out of it.

2312
01:29:57,900 --> 01:30:01,980
But you age out of it really quickly, seemingly like it's a pretty.

2313
01:30:02,180 --> 01:30:03,460
You know, a decade.

2314
01:30:03,460 --> 01:30:07,620
I mean, you can do it to like I mean, there were some people, especially in Japan,

2315
01:30:07,620 --> 01:30:10,860
people would kind of push it into their early 30s.

2316
01:30:10,860 --> 01:30:13,980
Sure. Yeah, because they have to like bring people out.

2317
01:30:13,980 --> 01:30:16,900
So they're not going to be as strict, I guess. Yeah.

2318
01:30:17,140 --> 01:30:20,220
There were a couple kind of lifers and then you kind of graduate

2319
01:30:20,220 --> 01:30:24,700
either into like management or, you know, you could become a fairy godmother.

2320
01:30:25,020 --> 01:30:27,780
I was going to say, yeah, wait, yeah, you could just shift over.

2321
01:30:27,860 --> 01:30:31,860
Which, by the way, I've seen fairy godmothers with like plastic faces.

2322
01:30:32,020 --> 01:30:33,780
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

2323
01:30:33,780 --> 01:30:36,340
Japan like there's a creepy way they do that.

2324
01:30:36,340 --> 01:30:39,540
And I think they do wear a head in Japan.

2325
01:30:40,220 --> 01:30:41,860
Yeah. The Jess.

2326
01:30:41,860 --> 01:30:44,420
No, no, it's not, Jesse. It's it's Bo Peep now.

2327
01:30:44,420 --> 01:30:47,500
There's a new Bo Peep out here and she's got the plastic mask.

2328
01:30:47,500 --> 01:30:49,180
Oh, it's so disconcerting.

2329
01:30:49,180 --> 01:30:51,500
V for Vendetta.

2330
01:30:51,500 --> 01:30:53,940
The purge, the purge doll mask.

2331
01:30:53,940 --> 01:30:55,980
I get why they're doing it with Buzz and Woody.

2332
01:30:55,980 --> 01:30:59,140
And I get I'm assuming that's the logic is like, well, she should have it too.

2333
01:30:59,140 --> 01:31:02,540
But her face is not as cartoonish, I feel like, as theirs is.

2334
01:31:02,540 --> 01:31:04,700
Yeah, that's not right. That shouldn't be happening.

2335
01:31:04,740 --> 01:31:09,100
Yeah, those crosses of border recycled spectra of magic.

2336
01:31:09,220 --> 01:31:14,060
I feel like, yeah, is the only older woman you could play the fairy god?

2337
01:31:14,140 --> 01:31:16,460
I guess there's like those queens.

2338
01:31:16,460 --> 01:31:17,860
Yeah, this is in the walk around.

2339
01:31:17,860 --> 01:31:19,260
It's like the evil queen.

2340
01:31:19,260 --> 01:31:21,700
You've got Cruella DeVille, who's really fun.

2341
01:31:21,700 --> 01:31:24,100
And you could be I mean, she's usually like late 20s, too.

2342
01:31:24,100 --> 01:31:26,140
Or mid to late 20s. Sure, sure.

2343
01:31:27,100 --> 01:31:29,900
Yeah. And then you get into the fairy godmother.

2344
01:31:30,700 --> 01:31:33,380
This is the mother and the step sisters.

2345
01:31:33,380 --> 01:31:36,900
But this stepmother and the step sisters, they're more they don't come out all the time.

2346
01:31:37,540 --> 01:31:41,700
So there was they're just more special occasions, maybe weekends.

2347
01:31:42,660 --> 01:31:46,300
I should also real quick for the 50th anniversary, I was working there

2348
01:31:46,300 --> 01:31:50,380
and they brought out like a bunch of characters that had been, you know, put away for good.

2349
01:31:50,660 --> 01:31:53,020
So I got to play Megara from Hercules.

2350
01:31:53,020 --> 01:31:54,980
Whoa. Cool.

2351
01:31:54,980 --> 01:31:57,620
And so, yeah, I was the only one who got to do it.

2352
01:31:57,900 --> 01:32:01,260
And her the reason why they don't have her anymore is because, well, one, that

2353
01:32:01,460 --> 01:32:05,100
she was not popular, but also she has this huge ponytail.

2354
01:32:05,220 --> 01:32:10,740
So the way the wig works is it's a helmet, like a hard helmet with this huge ponytail.

2355
01:32:10,860 --> 01:32:13,180
And you have to pin it into your head.

2356
01:32:13,180 --> 01:32:15,660
There's only two points where you pin it into your head.

2357
01:32:15,820 --> 01:32:18,100
So women were getting bald spots.

2358
01:32:18,580 --> 01:32:21,020
Oh, my God. Yeah.

2359
01:32:21,060 --> 01:32:23,460
She's when it was regularly in operation.

2360
01:32:23,460 --> 01:32:25,700
Yeah. She's suffering for your art.

2361
01:32:25,700 --> 01:32:28,580
Yeah, really. Wow. Insane.

2362
01:32:28,940 --> 01:32:32,100
The only the other I was saying the only other aging aging part

2363
01:32:32,100 --> 01:32:34,340
would be just auditioning for the Lucille Ball estate.

2364
01:32:34,500 --> 01:32:36,860
I guess this is what it's come to.

2365
01:32:37,220 --> 01:32:40,020
I would love a documentary about that.

2366
01:32:40,500 --> 01:32:44,340
Yeah. Like who runs it and who do you have to audition for?

2367
01:32:44,380 --> 01:32:48,540
And do you go to some weird like mansion and Chatsworth, like whatever,

2368
01:32:48,540 --> 01:32:51,380
like Desi Lu Manor where some of them still live?

2369
01:32:51,380 --> 01:32:55,660
Well, he did Warner Brothers very briefly did like some Halloween events

2370
01:32:55,660 --> 01:32:56,700
the last couple of years.

2371
01:32:56,700 --> 01:32:58,020
I don't think they're doing it this year.

2372
01:32:58,020 --> 01:32:59,580
But there was a huge show.

2373
01:32:59,580 --> 01:33:02,580
There was a Betty David, Betty versus Joan.

2374
01:33:02,860 --> 01:33:05,140
There was a maze. No, there was a show.

2375
01:33:05,140 --> 01:33:08,180
Oh, a show. And I'm like, do the estates have to weigh

2376
01:33:08,180 --> 01:33:11,740
through the Davis Crawford estates have to weigh in on this like

2377
01:33:12,180 --> 01:33:14,500
body haunt show?

2378
01:33:14,540 --> 01:33:16,620
Maybe. Probably. Probably. Yeah.

2379
01:33:16,620 --> 01:33:19,140
Yeah. Geez. That's a bizarre one.

2380
01:33:19,140 --> 01:33:21,300
Anybody you wish you could have played

2381
01:33:21,300 --> 01:33:23,540
or that if you wanted to add another to the arsenal.

2382
01:33:23,580 --> 01:33:26,780
I always well, I was glad I got to play Mary Poppins in

2383
01:33:27,420 --> 01:33:30,260
in Tokyo, because that was one of my other favorite movies.

2384
01:33:30,260 --> 01:33:32,820
And so that was just the costume is so good.

2385
01:33:32,860 --> 01:33:34,700
Yeah, I love that costume.

2386
01:33:34,700 --> 01:33:37,780
She in the parks is it like is it a hat with flowers?

2387
01:33:37,860 --> 01:33:40,620
Yeah, she's got the white the white the jolly holiday outfit on.

2388
01:33:40,660 --> 01:33:42,380
Oh, that one. Oh, wear it. OK.

2389
01:33:42,380 --> 01:33:43,980
Yeah. Sure. Sure. Sure. Little red belt.

2390
01:33:43,980 --> 01:33:46,100
So I love I loved playing her.

2391
01:33:46,980 --> 01:33:49,820
And otherwise, I mean, this would never happen.

2392
01:33:49,820 --> 01:33:52,260
But Jasmine would be fun. Sure.

2393
01:33:52,300 --> 01:33:53,820
Just because that outfit.

2394
01:33:53,820 --> 01:33:56,340
Sure. I saw complaints on the Reddit that they were

2395
01:33:56,340 --> 01:34:00,260
they were like the worst targets essentially for gross dudes,

2396
01:34:00,260 --> 01:34:01,660
because that's like a bra.

2397
01:34:01,660 --> 01:34:02,940
Essentially. Yeah.

2398
01:34:02,940 --> 01:34:06,980
Oh, yeah. Jasmine and Ariel get sexually harassed all the time.

2399
01:34:06,980 --> 01:34:08,820
It's terrible. Yeah.

2400
01:34:08,820 --> 01:34:11,540
You know, Bear Midriff sends people a flutter.

2401
01:34:11,820 --> 01:34:13,260
I know it's weird.

2402
01:34:13,260 --> 01:34:14,700
Do you really weird?

2403
01:34:14,700 --> 01:34:17,420
Do you ever like watch like Tangled and you go, I could play.

2404
01:34:18,020 --> 01:34:18,900
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

2405
01:34:18,900 --> 01:34:23,580
I'd be I think maybe my face isn't around enough to play Tangled

2406
01:34:24,100 --> 01:34:25,980
to play. What's your face?

2407
01:34:25,980 --> 01:34:28,420
Oh, wait, who's so who are the latest Disney princesses?

2408
01:34:28,420 --> 01:34:31,140
I'm trying to think of it. I've watched this up because I was here

2409
01:34:31,140 --> 01:34:37,820
and I watched a weird ceremony, the like induction ceremony of Merida.

2410
01:34:37,860 --> 01:34:39,420
Oh, the redhead. Yeah. Yeah.

2411
01:34:39,420 --> 01:34:41,620
From Brave. Right.

2412
01:34:41,620 --> 01:34:44,100
Moana. Moana since then.

2413
01:34:44,460 --> 01:34:46,300
So which brings the granted all up to 12.

2414
01:34:46,300 --> 01:34:49,500
And then before that, in descending order, Rapunzel, Tiana,

2415
01:34:49,540 --> 01:34:52,180
Princess and the Moulin, Boccahontas.

2416
01:34:52,180 --> 01:34:54,780
And then so then it's the 90s. Right. Yeah.

2417
01:34:54,900 --> 01:34:58,180
And also, are they not the princesses?

2418
01:34:58,500 --> 01:34:59,740
Well, royalty.

2419
01:34:59,740 --> 01:35:02,460
The real. Right. Yeah.

2420
01:35:02,460 --> 01:35:05,660
Because I feel like I saw things that I think maybe they

2421
01:35:05,940 --> 01:35:07,460
I think it may be like

2422
01:35:07,460 --> 01:35:10,460
merch lines are the arbitrary divisions.

2423
01:35:10,460 --> 01:35:14,740
The big 12 princesses, they might have their own because they're so

2424
01:35:14,780 --> 01:35:18,860
they're probably popular enough to not be under the princess umbrella.

2425
01:35:19,140 --> 01:35:24,660
But maybe at some point they will be moved right to the princess area.

2426
01:35:24,660 --> 01:35:26,820
Interesting. Yeah.

2427
01:35:26,820 --> 01:35:27,540
No, none of them.

2428
01:35:27,540 --> 01:35:31,620
I mean, I honestly like Cinderella to me is like the most iconic one.

2429
01:35:31,980 --> 01:35:33,220
Yeah. Yeah.

2430
01:35:33,220 --> 01:35:34,540
She's got the hoop skirt.

2431
01:35:34,540 --> 01:35:37,340
I mean, that's kind of one of the best dresses, I think.

2432
01:35:37,740 --> 01:35:40,100
It's pretty you're wearing these like iconic

2433
01:35:40,380 --> 01:35:43,020
like things you've been watching since you were a kid.

2434
01:35:43,220 --> 01:35:46,540
That all they like you're probably talking to like little kids

2435
01:35:46,540 --> 01:35:51,580
who are dressed like you and like that adds to the magic of everything.

2436
01:35:51,820 --> 01:35:55,020
Yeah, it was pretty special getting to wear the the Cinderella outfit.

2437
01:35:55,020 --> 01:35:59,380
Like that never really got tiring, except it was itchy.

2438
01:35:59,900 --> 01:36:01,140
Sure. Yes.

2439
01:36:01,140 --> 01:36:03,420
But besides the physical nature of it.

2440
01:36:03,660 --> 01:36:04,460
Sure.

2441
01:36:05,660 --> 01:36:06,660
God, anything else?

2442
01:36:06,660 --> 01:36:10,060
I feel like we've like this is one of the guys that's been the most like

2443
01:36:10,540 --> 01:36:11,460
just question.

2444
01:36:11,460 --> 01:36:13,620
This has been the most pure interview.

2445
01:36:13,620 --> 01:36:17,300
Like this is like an inquisition, essentially.

2446
01:36:17,620 --> 01:36:18,660
And what else?

2447
01:36:19,260 --> 01:36:24,660
Also, I did you have to like, oh, here's there's there's one more thing.

2448
01:36:24,660 --> 01:36:28,500
Did anybody ever do you have to like keep mythology straight in your head?

2449
01:36:28,500 --> 01:36:31,780
Because I read a thing about how, you know, you if a kid,

2450
01:36:31,780 --> 01:36:35,060
it was very confusing if a kid asked about Thomas the Tank Engine.

2451
01:36:35,380 --> 01:36:36,900
Like, I don't know, Tom.

2452
01:36:36,900 --> 01:36:39,860
You just can't acknowledge other IP.

2453
01:36:39,980 --> 01:36:42,100
Oh, interesting. Yes.

2454
01:36:42,100 --> 01:36:45,220
I think, yeah, you were if they asked you about like, I mean,

2455
01:36:45,580 --> 01:36:47,540
I'm trying to think like, who's the princess?

2456
01:36:47,540 --> 01:36:50,180
What was that knockoff Disney movie?

2457
01:36:50,300 --> 01:36:53,100
Anastasia, Anastasia, which I actually loved Anastasia.

2458
01:36:53,100 --> 01:36:56,580
But yeah, you would just that it didn't exist to you.

2459
01:36:56,780 --> 01:36:59,940
Sure. You're like, I'll talk to Mickey about it, you would say.

2460
01:36:59,980 --> 01:37:02,300
Yeah, yeah. I'll talk to Mickey.

2461
01:37:02,660 --> 01:37:04,620
Yeah. All right. A letter about that.

2462
01:37:06,220 --> 01:37:10,060
I asked Mickey, he got very upset and stormed off.

2463
01:37:10,220 --> 01:37:12,980
So take from that what you will.

2464
01:37:12,980 --> 01:37:17,140
I'd say that he said something very mean about Jeffrey Katzenberg.

2465
01:37:17,860 --> 01:37:21,780
Whoever that is, whoever that is, I don't know who that is either.

2466
01:37:21,780 --> 01:37:24,100
I had to ask Mickey about that.

2467
01:37:24,100 --> 01:37:26,940
I got a lot of questions from Mickey.

2468
01:37:26,940 --> 01:37:29,860
I'm going to do that in my real life when I don't know the answer to a question.

2469
01:37:30,020 --> 01:37:31,180
I'm going to ask Mickey about that.

2470
01:37:31,180 --> 01:37:33,540
The boss. I just kind of like look away or something.

2471
01:37:33,540 --> 01:37:34,700
Yeah. Do you want a picture?

2472
01:37:34,700 --> 01:37:35,620
Oh, yeah, definitely.

2473
01:37:35,620 --> 01:37:38,140
I mean, I use my princess skills all the time.

2474
01:37:38,900 --> 01:37:40,900
Yeah. Sure. How so?

2475
01:37:40,900 --> 01:37:43,700
And just like diverting uncomfortable questions.

2476
01:37:43,820 --> 01:37:47,140
Sure. You know, and waving to people.

2477
01:37:47,300 --> 01:37:48,700
Oh, sure. Yeah.

2478
01:37:48,700 --> 01:37:51,340
Has it affected your affected your real life waving?

2479
01:37:52,420 --> 01:37:54,380
I think it probably has.

2480
01:37:54,380 --> 01:37:56,700
Yeah, I mean, it definitely does.

2481
01:37:56,980 --> 01:38:00,060
I mean, I'm able to just like be super fake.

2482
01:38:01,660 --> 01:38:03,020
Really easily.

2483
01:38:03,020 --> 01:38:05,540
It's like you had a flip on the switch.

2484
01:38:05,540 --> 01:38:08,060
Yeah. It's like you'll get in the car after that and be like,

2485
01:38:08,060 --> 01:38:10,580
these three nerds, these fucking nerds.

2486
01:38:10,860 --> 01:38:13,140
That was terrible.

2487
01:38:14,180 --> 01:38:15,900
You're fooling me.

2488
01:38:16,100 --> 01:38:17,300
It's all it matters.

2489
01:38:17,300 --> 01:38:19,020
But it also is all like we're talking about this.

2490
01:38:19,020 --> 01:38:21,380
How it's all like it is improv.

2491
01:38:21,580 --> 01:38:24,660
It's like one of the most practical applications of improv skills.

2492
01:38:24,660 --> 01:38:26,060
Oh, for sure. Yeah.

2493
01:38:26,060 --> 01:38:29,180
You're like doing half of an improv show, essentially,

2494
01:38:29,180 --> 01:38:31,980
to somebody who doesn't know they're in an improv show.

2495
01:38:31,980 --> 01:38:33,900
Yeah, definitely. Yeah.

2496
01:38:33,900 --> 01:38:38,060
And just like being in character and I mean, yeah, it is.

2497
01:38:38,060 --> 01:38:39,580
It literally is improv.

2498
01:38:39,580 --> 01:38:42,700
But it's the same improv over and over and over again.

2499
01:38:43,180 --> 01:38:45,540
Sure. So it starts to become plug and play.

2500
01:38:45,820 --> 01:38:48,620
I know all of the answers here.

2501
01:38:48,620 --> 01:38:51,460
Also, well, hey, this is all this is also cool to hear about.

2502
01:38:51,460 --> 01:38:53,540
I'm in a London Survive podcast, the bride.

2503
01:38:54,060 --> 01:38:57,100
Thanks for thanks for telling us all this stuff for surviving the

2504
01:38:57,300 --> 01:38:58,580
the Inquisition, especially.

2505
01:39:00,260 --> 01:39:01,660
Let's exit to the gift shop.

2506
01:39:01,660 --> 01:39:03,260
Is there anything you would like to plug?

2507
01:39:03,260 --> 01:39:05,020
Oh, thank you. Well, thanks so much for having me.

2508
01:39:05,020 --> 01:39:06,860
This was really fun.

2509
01:39:06,860 --> 01:39:09,700
And I would love to plug my podcast, The Big Ones,

2510
01:39:09,700 --> 01:39:12,460
which I host with my friend Maria Blasucci.

2511
01:39:12,460 --> 01:39:16,260
And we discuss life's big moral quandaries.

2512
01:39:16,260 --> 01:39:20,420
Like, would you rather be 20 percent more attractive or 20 percent smarter?

2513
01:39:21,660 --> 01:39:23,980
Or God, we just did one of my favorites.

2514
01:39:23,980 --> 01:39:25,980
We had Matt on and we discussed.

2515
01:39:25,980 --> 01:39:27,860
So there is a murder trial.

2516
01:39:27,860 --> 01:39:31,700
You're on the jury and the defendant is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.

2517
01:39:31,940 --> 01:39:35,180
But there can join twin and the twin is innocent.

2518
01:39:35,700 --> 01:39:38,860
Do you send them both to jail?

2519
01:39:38,860 --> 01:39:41,180
Or do you let a murderer go free?

2520
01:39:42,020 --> 01:39:44,180
Whoa. Gosh, I don't have an easy answer for that.

2521
01:39:44,180 --> 01:39:46,780
It's not there's no easy answer, I guarantee you.

2522
01:39:46,820 --> 01:39:51,260
Yeah. And there's no you couldn't like make somebody be in half of a jail

2523
01:39:51,260 --> 01:39:53,260
because they would still be stuck.

2524
01:39:53,260 --> 01:39:56,460
I know you could put them like the other side of the wall is a park.

2525
01:39:56,460 --> 01:39:59,140
But then there's you're still

2526
01:40:00,140 --> 01:40:02,140
then you're stuck between a wall, essentially.

2527
01:40:02,140 --> 01:40:04,060
I know it takes a lot of resources.

2528
01:40:04,060 --> 01:40:05,260
Yeah, you have to have somebody.

2529
01:40:05,260 --> 01:40:08,660
My my quick and now I'm thinking about it would be like as person follows

2530
01:40:08,820 --> 01:40:11,980
them around and make sure the one doesn't get to do anything fun

2531
01:40:11,980 --> 01:40:12,780
that the other one's doing.

2532
01:40:12,780 --> 01:40:14,660
That's kind of where we landed.

2533
01:40:14,660 --> 01:40:18,260
Not to give away too much, but we went down a lot of I mean, there was a lot.

2534
01:40:18,660 --> 01:40:22,700
Like if there were not no movies, if a movie you have to put headphones on

2535
01:40:22,700 --> 01:40:25,460
and like a mask on and they don't get to see the movie or the one.

2536
01:40:25,460 --> 01:40:28,260
The innocent one gets to decide what movie to watch every time.

2537
01:40:28,740 --> 01:40:31,900
That's good, too. Unless they probably share taste, though, if they're.

2538
01:40:32,260 --> 01:40:34,620
Yeah, because it's sharing similar things.

2539
01:40:34,620 --> 01:40:38,380
You know, VR helmet might take if you put somebody in a pleasant world

2540
01:40:38,380 --> 01:40:39,780
or unpleasant. Oh, yeah.

2541
01:40:39,780 --> 01:40:42,180
A VR helmet that is fixed to their head.

2542
01:40:42,180 --> 01:40:44,220
And they see jail and they see jail.

2543
01:40:44,220 --> 01:40:46,180
We did not think of this.

2544
01:40:46,180 --> 01:40:48,340
We may have solved it.

2545
01:40:48,340 --> 01:40:49,900
Solved the problem.

2546
01:40:49,900 --> 01:40:53,060
Well, actually, Matt did come up with some sort of head jail,

2547
01:40:53,060 --> 01:40:55,940
but he he didn't go as far as to say VR.

2548
01:40:55,940 --> 01:40:58,420
We were just thinking a bird cage man in the Iron Man.

2549
01:41:01,500 --> 01:41:04,100
But anyway, this was just a glimpse into the types of discussions

2550
01:41:04,100 --> 01:41:05,100
we have on the big ones.

2551
01:41:05,100 --> 01:41:07,740
And that's on my podcast network, ERIO's Network,

2552
01:41:07,860 --> 01:41:09,460
which is a woman run network.

2553
01:41:09,460 --> 01:41:11,940
So you go to ERIO's.

2554
01:41:11,940 --> 01:41:13,780
Just Google ERIO's podcast network.

2555
01:41:13,780 --> 01:41:16,180
We've got a bunch of good shows. Sure.

2556
01:41:16,180 --> 01:41:20,020
How do you spell that? It's E.A.R.I.O.S.

2557
01:41:20,180 --> 01:41:21,060
Cool.

2558
01:41:21,060 --> 01:41:21,660
Big moral.

2559
01:41:21,660 --> 01:41:26,420
Moral quandaries would be faced by the princesses because they as rulers

2560
01:41:26,420 --> 01:41:29,020
of kingdoms, you don't see that side of things.

2561
01:41:29,020 --> 01:41:31,340
They have to like probably sentence people to death

2562
01:41:31,340 --> 01:41:34,020
or decide whether to go into a war or not.

2563
01:41:34,020 --> 01:41:34,940
I mean, it's true.

2564
01:41:34,940 --> 01:41:37,060
We did do the Little Mermaid dilemma.

2565
01:41:37,060 --> 01:41:39,620
Would you give up your identity for love?

2566
01:41:40,140 --> 01:41:42,340
Oh, right. Yeah.

2567
01:41:42,340 --> 01:41:44,340
Is there a clear deterrent? Well, I shouldn't say it's.

2568
01:41:44,340 --> 01:41:47,140
I mean, listen, it's we all have different moral compasses.

2569
01:41:47,740 --> 01:41:48,380
That's true. Yeah.

2570
01:41:48,380 --> 01:41:50,660
So it's not really black and white all the time,

2571
01:41:50,980 --> 01:41:53,340
except for this VR helmet solution, which is genius.

2572
01:41:53,340 --> 01:41:53,740
All right.

2573
01:41:53,740 --> 01:41:55,380
I mean, truly, you win.

2574
01:41:55,380 --> 01:41:56,540
Like that is the solution.

2575
01:41:56,540 --> 01:41:59,020
Using my knowledge of theme park-esque technology.

2576
01:41:59,300 --> 01:42:01,460
Yeah, you're correct.

2577
01:42:01,460 --> 01:42:02,460
Awesome. Well, yeah.

2578
01:42:02,460 --> 01:42:04,180
Check all that out, ERIO's.com.

2579
01:42:04,180 --> 01:42:08,420
