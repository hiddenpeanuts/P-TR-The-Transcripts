1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,840
Forever.

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:03,680
Dog.

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:07,320
Warning, the following podcast explores

4
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:09,880
an abandoned theme park in the Ozarks,

5
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:12,960
teeming with trout, Kickapoo Joy Juice,

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,600
and wires that might decapitate you.

7
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,360
Hult and Catch Fire creator Christopher Cantwell

8
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,500
takes us to a theme park so great,

9
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,320
they tried to sell it on eBay twice.

10
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:27,000
It's Dog Patch USA on Podcast The Rock.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:27,840
The Rock.

12
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,000
Welcome to Podcast The Ride,

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,240
a show about theme parks that somehow went 109 episodes

14
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,840
before talking about a ride called

15
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,840
Earthquake Magoon's Brain Rattler.

16
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm Scott Gardiner joined by Mike Carlson.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,520
Shocking, this is Mike, yeah.

18
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,680
When you said that, I think that's one of your first pitches

19
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,120
for doing this episode was have you ever heard

20
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,280
of Earthquake Magoon's Brain Rattler?

21
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,120
It jumps off the page.

22
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,440
And I was like, my god.

23
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:12,280
Yeah, yeah.

24
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,100
We should really just be doing it

25
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:14,600
about that ride specifically,

26
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:15,440
but we're gonna do a whole new thing.

27
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:18,200
Which is still, you can go on it in the world,

28
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,640
it's still in Wisconsin, but we'll get to that later.

29
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,880
Jason Sheridan is here.

30
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:24,200
Yeah, this is a real quarker.

31
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,640
This is like, this.

32
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,840
It's a brain rattler.

33
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,240
This thing is a brain rattler.

34
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,360
This is like Hard Rock Park level,

35
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,800
but I had a limited time to prepare for it.

36
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,320
I was just like reading stuff,

37
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,640
like I'm not gonna be ready.

38
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,240
It was every effort to not just let it consume my life.

39
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,560
It had to stop at some point and we had to do the episode.

40
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,280
And the topic comes to us courtesy of a guest

41
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,600
who I'm so excited is here.

42
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,520
He's the co-creator of AMC's Halt and Catch Fire.

43
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,600
He's a comic book writer behind the upcoming editions

44
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,320
of The Mask and Dr. Doom,

45
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,520
and the director of the feature film

46
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,320
The Parts You Lose with Aaron Paul,

47
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,880
Christopher Cantwell is here.

48
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,680
Hey guys. What's happening?

49
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,600
Hi Craig. Hey.

50
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,440
Thank you so much for coming out.

51
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,440
Thank you for having me.

52
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:06,200
Yes, and thank you for supplying this topic.

53
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,040
Dark Patch?

54
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,200
Yeah, well, because we talked a while back

55
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,200
about you talking about what Six Flags Over Texas,

56
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,520
which is what you. Yeah, and that was the theme park

57
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,440
I grew up going to, because I grew up in Dallas.

58
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:19,680
Sure, sure. So I went to Six Flags Over Texas a lot.

59
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,440
Uh-huh, uh-huh, and that's where we were heading, I think.

60
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,520
Yeah, I mean, because I spent a lot of time there.

61
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,200
I was actually just back in Texas last week

62
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:29,760
and was driving by in Arlington and was seeing.

63
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,320
Sure, sure. Like the rides I used to go on

64
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:35,200
are dwarfed by giant rollercoasters.

65
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,440
Like the, I was afraid of the one rollercoaster.

66
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,720
Like I used to be afraid of rollercoasters

67
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,720
when I was a kid, and then got over it at Six Flags,

68
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:46,320
but there was one that was so big that I,

69
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,840
like I don't care what I go on now,

70
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,400
but I'll go on the rides at the LA County Fair,

71
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,920
like no matter what they are,

72
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:56,080
but like that rollercoaster from a distance was like, holy.

73
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,040
Even just looking at it.

74
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,960
Yeah, it was insane. Which one is that, do you recall?

75
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:03,000
I don't know which one it is, it's because I'm not,

76
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,640
I'm not up on.

77
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,440
You don't know the name, the newsletter?

78
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,000
You don't know the manufacturers?

79
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,800
Yeah, yeah, it's probably, if I had to guess,

80
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,400
it's the new Texas Giant.

81
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,240
Uh-huh, uh-huh. I bet you

82
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,120
it's the new Texas Giant, because the old one

83
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,720
used to be the tallest rollercoaster in the world,

84
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:20,160
but there's no way, and I think they tore that down,

85
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,880
and now it's whatever that is.

86
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:24,360
So whatever's going on there now, it just makes it like.

87
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,560
It's just like giant, yeah.

88
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,640
Everything's lame that you were so afraid to conquer.

89
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,600
Yeah, like you can see Judge Roy Scream,

90
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,840
which is the original rollercoaster there.

91
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,000
Ooh. Wow.

92
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,200
You can still see that from the highway,

93
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,720
but it just looks like a stack of matches.

94
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,160
Sorry, Judge Roy Scream?

95
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,120
Yes, so that's the rollercoaster.

96
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,240
I think that's my favorite rollercoaster.

97
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,440
Well, because that's the one where I still remember it

98
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,800
clicking and being like,

99
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,760
I'm not afraid of rollercoasters anymore,

100
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,600
because I was like, well, wait a minute, this is fine.

101
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,520
Sure. But it's a wooden rollercoaster,

102
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:57,520
very basic, named after the hanging judge, Judge Roy Bean,

103
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,760
famous for a lot of executions in the Old West.

104
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,840
Oh, okay.

105
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,720
Oh, that's an old, that's not a,

106
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,960
that's an 1800s Texas figure.

107
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,600
It's like a real person, I guess.

108
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,400
Yeah, I guess it's a Texas person, probably.

109
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,000
Has he been turned into a character

110
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
in the way Jack the Ripper has been turned,

111
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,840
like you know what I mean?

112
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,920
Like he was a horrible man,

113
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,280
but now we sort of have robbed him in fiction.

114
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,760
I'm sure, like he was known as the hanging judge.

115
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,600
Yeah.

116
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,840
Which is like, cool, man.

117
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,320
But I mean, back in the 80s, of course,

118
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,160
everyone in Texas was like, this is awesome.

119
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,920
I'm sure they still are like that in Texas.

120
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,760
They might, yes, there's certain pockets of it.

121
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,440
But this is Judge Roy Scream.

122
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,360
Totally unrelated.

123
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,200
So it's worse?

124
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,080
It would be like, I mean, I guess he was a judge,

125
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,280
so it was a legal killing,

126
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:39,040
but it would be like having a son of Sam ride or something,

127
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,800
like a guy who murdered people.

128
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,640
Who's the most corrupt law enforcement official

129
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,240
we can name this right after?

130
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,520
Yeah, it would be like.

131
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,360
Arpaio.

132
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,200
Arpaio, that's, thank you.

133
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,040
Oh yeah.

134
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:49,880
Judge Arpaio.

135
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:50,720
Judge Arpaio.

136
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,280
Jesus Christ, yeah, wow.

137
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,120
It's like a gravitron, but it's

138
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,080
spilling his face on it. Sheriff Joe's Fright Fest

139
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,000
is a lot scarier.

140
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,360
Okay, sure.

141
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,080
There is a thing coming up where the theme park

142
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:06,200
does dovetail with a real life political figure

143
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,480
who is very, super problematic.

144
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,880
We'll come up to that later.

145
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,840
There's a little teaser.

146
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,320
But that's what, so we were,

147
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,720
I think we could have gotten a great episode

148
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,560
out of Six Flags over Texas, but then you said,

149
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,400
well there's also this other thing

150
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,800
that I might wanna talk about.

151
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,640
I'll talk about you and say,

152
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,520
oh right, what's that?

153
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,360
And I'm like on, I'm sort of metering,

154
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,800
like well I don't wanna go too obscure.

155
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,640
I mean what's the deal with that?

156
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,200
Yeah, you were like, we'll mostly talk about Six Flags.

157
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,040
That's what I thought.

158
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:28,880
Okay.

159
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,200
And then you described a little more.

160
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,720
I just got reacquainted to the fact

161
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:35,040
that it is a hillbilly theme park

162
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:38,520
devoted to the comic strip Lil Abner.

163
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:41,320
And I just, I think I said maybe only that to you guys,

164
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,520
and maybe Earthquake Magoon's Brain Rattler,

165
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,600
and you were both like whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

166
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,440
Yeah.

167
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,280
Hold your horses.

168
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,120
I specifically remember sending the first two paragraphs

169
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,440
of the Wikipedia page and going,

170
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:55,040
uh, what?

171
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,080
It's crazy.

172
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,600
Yeah.

173
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,880
And I think, I think we also both,

174
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,480
what I thought right away is Lil Abner, okay.

175
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,080
So that's an old comic strip thing.

176
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,320
It's got Lil in it.

177
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,120
That sounds like the kind of thing

178
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,680
that Jason would really enjoy.

179
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,240
That'd be way in Jason's wheelhouse,

180
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,440
because Jason likes old timey things.

181
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,280
Jason likes good old comics.

182
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,360
I love Nancy.

183
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,080
Nancy and Slogo.

184
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:22,120
There's a lot of Lil characters in the history of comics.

185
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:25,120
Lil Lada, Lil Dot, Lil Audrey.

186
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,560
There's a lot of Lil characters.

187
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,040
A little Lord Fauntleroy.

188
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:29,880
Also maybe not a.

189
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:30,720
Lil Nemo.

190
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,560
Lil Rascals.

191
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,960
But it's not abbreviated.

192
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:33,800
Yeah, it's not abbreviated.

193
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,640
Yeah, it's not Lil.

194
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,760
Lil is the domain of the rapper,

195
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:41,280
but at a certain time it was like kids up to no good.

196
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:45,440
It was either a very fancy boy or a very poor boy.

197
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,560
That was the comic strip with the Lil in front.

198
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,600
It was like the scrappy no shoes kid in the Depression era.

199
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,400
Yeah, making it work.

200
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,760
Just Lil, Lil, whoever.

201
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:55,760
In an ironic twist,

202
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,840
rappers, some of the most famous people in America,

203
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,640
just as Lil Abner was in his time.

204
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,320
Yeah, that was a big deal, right?

205
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:07,720
Yeah, when Lil Abner and his betrothed Daisy Mae

206
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,160
got married finally,

207
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,920
they appeared on the cover of Life Magazine.

208
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,200
Wow, what?

209
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,040
Yes.

210
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,080
It was like the Luke and Laura of their day.

211
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,320
Would any fictional wedding get that today?

212
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:22,120
I don't think there's enough cultural force to anything.

213
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,080
I feel like you get the real wedding,

214
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,680
but you wouldn't get the like.

215
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:27,520
Yeah, yeah, we're not celebrating.

216
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,960
I mean, you know, because you're a comic book guy,

217
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,240
they did Batman and Catwoman, but then she.

218
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,080
Yes.

219
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,320
Spoiler alert.

220
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,160
That did not work out.

221
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,000
It was a big deal.

222
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,840
It was a big deal.

223
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,720
It was a big deal, but they're still like, you know.

224
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:41,600
Once or twice a year, there's like a big comics event

225
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:45,800
that gets, the ending gets leaked to the press

226
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,320
the day before it comes out,

227
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,120
so they can write articles about it.

228
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,520
Yeah, yeah.

229
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,840
That was one of those.

230
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,880
They've put like, I feel like when Lois and Clark.

231
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,680
She left him at the altar, we'll just say it.

232
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,520
Yeah.

233
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,360
Sorry.

234
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,200
The one guy in his car going.

235
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,040
Fuck!

236
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:03,760
Can I get the gift back?

237
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,600
He probably just did it to Colossus too.

238
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,440
Is that right?

239
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,120
Oh really?

240
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,080
Well, all the heroes were there,

241
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,080
which is the most humiliating part.

242
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:13,920
Good.

243
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:19,200
Getting cuckolded in front of all your strongest friends.

244
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,800
Sorry, bud.

245
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,960
It didn't have the dignity of the shotgun wedding

246
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,240
that Lil Abner was under.

247
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,960
But Lil Abner, what I was saying with all that was like,

248
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,880
so he's, oh, so it's like one of those, yeah,

249
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,000
it's like a little rascal.

250
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,920
It's like, must be some little kid that runs around

251
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,400
and Jason could relate to it.

252
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,240
Not really.

253
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,080
He's a giant man, right?

254
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:38,720
He's a big strapping.

255
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,560
It's an ironic name.

256
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,400
Yes.

257
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,240
He's big.

258
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,160
He's a dumb dude, right?

259
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,600
Lives in the Holler, lives in Dogpatch.

260
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,440
Right, lives in Dogpatch.

261
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,280
With his family.

262
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:50,160
Dogpatch existed as the town within this strip

263
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,720
and it was famous enough from that to devote a theme park to.

264
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,760
Were you aware, would you have been aware of Lil Abner

265
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,880
without going to this place?

266
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:00,480
No, so I had no idea until I was an adult

267
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,640
what the theme of the theme park was.

268
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,920
Because I think I stopped going to the theme park

269
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,520
when I was six.

270
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,040
The only reason I would go out there

271
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,240
is we would drive from Texas to Arkansas

272
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,320
where my grandfather had retired.

273
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,200
And so my grandmother and my grandfather

274
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,120
were out in Arkansas, so on the way,

275
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:22,080
we would stop and do like a whole several hours

276
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,520
at Dogpatch USA.

277
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,360
So I just knew it as Dogpatch.

278
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,680
I was just like, oh, Dogpatch.

279
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,760
And it's possible by that point.

280
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,720
Because we're talking that's somewhere in 80s, I guess.

281
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:38,400
Yeah, so this would have been through the early 80s

282
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:41,240
stopping at around 88, I guess.

283
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,960
Because at some point in time,

284
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,720
they decreased the Lil Abner theme.

285
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,120
So it may have not even really been present

286
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:48,960
by the time we were there.

287
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,320
1991 was when they were like,

288
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,840
we are spending too much money on the lights.

289
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,160
Yeah, they let the rights go.

290
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,000
They let the rights go.

291
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,840
Oh, money's gone out the door.

292
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:58,560
But I looked it up doing one of those nostalgia Googles.

293
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,440
And I was like, dogpatch.

294
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,640
This was years ago.

295
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,080
And I was like, oh wow.

296
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,840
Not only was it Lil Abner theme,

297
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:09,840
but it's been abandoned for 20 something years.

298
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:13,280
It hasn't been regularly well maintained

299
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,720
since the mid 90s,

300
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,560
which isn't to say they haven't,

301
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,360
they've tried, they've certainly tried.

302
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,280
There's pieces of it, there's pockets of it, right?

303
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,320
Yeah, and I think it splinters off.

304
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,480
Like just the hotel has new ownership

305
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,600
or just the caves have been taken back

306
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,520
by somebody who wants to own just the caves.

307
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:33,000
Everything else has been taken back by the wilderness.

308
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,360
Yeah, because when I Googled it,

309
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,640
it was completely abandoned.

310
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,560
And it was like all the Urban X photos of it.

311
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,880
And so they were terrifying.

312
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:43,800
Yeah, yeah, which we sort of make fun of those folks

313
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:48,800
who go into like, just semi-abandoned,

314
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,000
how unsafe is it really,

315
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,560
but act like they're spelunking in very dangerous places.

316
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,520
This place I could see there being some pretty crazy animals.

317
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,080
You guys read the full Wikipedia article.

318
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,120
Yes, yes.

319
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,840
So it was very dangerous.

320
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,800
Yes, yeah, yeah.

321
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:04,640
Something happened.

322
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,000
I don't even know if I wanna say it.

323
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,680
Do we do it in the order of the...

324
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,120
It's your podcast, guys.

325
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,720
Should we start with some,

326
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,920
should we start going all the way back?

327
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,840
Should we talk about Al Cap?

328
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,160
I would love to talk about Al Cap.

329
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,920
Let's talk about Al Cap.

330
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:22,960
I only know him from this park and Andy Cap's hot fries.

331
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:23,800
Is that him?

332
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,680
It's not him.

333
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:25,520
Oh, shit.

334
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,360
That's another guy.

335
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,180
Hot fries.

336
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:28,020
I saw that too.

337
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:28,960
You can still buy those certain places.

338
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:29,960
Yes, you can, yeah.

339
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:30,880
Well, who's Andy Cap?

340
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:35,240
Andy Cap is a drunk, comic strip character.

341
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,360
That also confuses it.

342
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,160
You think La Labner is something else.

343
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,160
Andy Cap and Al Cap are so similar.

344
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,520
Right, and Andy Cap still is the mascot for hot fries,

345
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:46,080
which I believe is his only appearance in any media

346
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,560
is on a candy box.

347
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,520
No, it's not candy.

348
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,360
It's hot fries.

349
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,200
It's snack chips.

350
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,040
Oh, it's like chips.

351
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:52,880
It's like chips.

352
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:53,720
They're hot fries.

353
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,560
Oh, right.

354
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,400
And they are incredibly cheap.

355
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,240
They're like shitty Cheetos.

356
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,080
Yes.

357
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:57,920
They're very cheap.

358
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,560
Instantly, you're sick.

359
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,080
Are they like Takis?

360
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:04,880
They're kind of like Takis, kind of like potato sticks.

361
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:08,360
Basically, they just put the potato through the thing

362
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,920
to make fries and then fried them

363
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,560
and then covered them in that powder

364
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,560
and suck out any resemblance of water.

365
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,400
Like they are so dry.

366
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,600
They're so super dry.

367
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,880
Like they could eat them on the space shuttle.

368
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:19,720
Yes.

369
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,280
And it'd be no danger.

370
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,880
Survived for 100 years, really.

371
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,720
Got it, got it.

372
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,560
So, okay.

373
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:31,400
Well, I mean, so Lil Abner is Al Cap's creation

374
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,520
of a little hillbilly town.

375
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,640
It sounds a little charming from the outside,

376
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:40,400
but I've also seen it referred to as like Hick Face.

377
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:43,800
It's like the black face of Southern poor.

378
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,040
Making fun of hillbilly.

379
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:45,880
Like the holler.

380
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:46,720
Yes.

381
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,560
Of the holler.

382
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:51,240
Which he is from, you know, he's from the South,

383
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:55,360
but it comes from his point of view of resenting and.

384
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,200
And is that,

385
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,800
I'm gonna sound completely insensitive asking this,

386
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,960
but is that its sensitivity among like the deep South?

387
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,600
Or like, cause it's Arkansas,

388
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,880
but that also feels like it would be like Appalachia.

389
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,360
Appalachia?

390
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,200
Yeah.

391
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,040
And this is Ozarks.

392
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:09,880
Ozark mountains.

393
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,880
Yeah, which has kind of a classification of more.

394
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,320
But I feel like the Appalachian,

395
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,560
there's like a sensitivity there,

396
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,960
but I don't, they don't seem to care about dog patch.

397
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:17,800
Well, the thing like.

398
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,440
Just like Arkansas cares about dog patch.

399
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,600
Which I understand.

400
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,440
Sure, yeah.

401
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,760
I mean, it seems to me like they,

402
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,400
then they embraced it by like devoting a whole area to this.

403
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,240
They're like, they weren't bothered.

404
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,800
It was like a moneymaker, I guess.

405
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,800
Yeah, yeah, I suppose.

406
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,800
And was for.

407
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,400
I have a true story about Arkansas.

408
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,400
This was, I had not been to Arkansas

409
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,360
since my grandparents lived there.

410
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,200
Okay.

411
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,840
And I was driving a friend across the US.

412
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:44,920
He was gonna go to a business school at UNC in Chapel Hill.

413
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:47,640
And we stopped for lunch in Arkansas.

414
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,240
And we were just talking at the table

415
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:52,040
and it was like a small diner place.

416
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,400
And the waitress came up to me and said,

417
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,360
are you all from England?

418
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:59,080
Because we sounded so different from everybody else

419
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,840
in there just talking normally.

420
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:04,560
Like she literally thought we were from Great Britain.

421
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,800
Geez, geez.

422
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:06,640
It was amazing.

423
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,480
And you left out the part of the story

424
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,840
where she had to like re-say it 10 times

425
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,800
because you didn't understand what she was saying.

426
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,240
It was an intense accent.

427
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,480
Y'all from England?

428
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,960
Y'all from England?

429
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,160
It was pretty wild.

430
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,480
Well, in the comic strips,

431
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,640
in the little Abner comic strips,

432
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,880
it is an accent that doesn't,

433
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,240
it doesn't seem of this earth to me.

434
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,960
It does seem like a Connecticut guy

435
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:30,360
trying to verbalize it

436
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:33,480
so the average person would read it phonetically.

437
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,880
Oh yeah, lots of bizarre spellings

438
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,920
which puts it in that like racially offensive zone

439
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:43,080
where like, yeah, like exaggerating it so much

440
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,920
to where it sounds so stupid and weird

441
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,520
in like another language.

442
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,560
It's uncomfortable, certainly.

443
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,280
It's a weird time

444
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,840
because also at this time,

445
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:54,600
like when Dogpatch was doing well,

446
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,280
Green Acres, Petticoat Junction,

447
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,880
and the Beverly Hillbillies were all on TV

448
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:03,120
and then they were all like canceled at once almost.

449
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:03,960
In the Wikipedia article,

450
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:07,120
this was called the Great, the Southern Purge

451
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,120
or something like that.

452
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,200
The rural purge.

453
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,880
The rural purge of like culture.

454
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:12,720
Similar to the 30 Rock.

455
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,320
We're not doing this anymore.

456
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,040
Yeah, yeah, it all happened at one,

457
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,800
they even attribute like Lassie going away

458
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,120
to being part of this too.

459
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:21,800
That's so weird.

460
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,520
I had no idea about that.

461
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,360
Yeah.

462
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,920
Again, the liberal progressive in me is like,

463
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:29,680
I'm so sorry I didn't know about that.

464
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,080
I had no idea.

465
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,880
I had no sensitivity to how much the rural purge.

466
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,320
God, I was enjoying this theme park when I was a child.

467
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,840
My parents, you know.

468
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,520
I assumed there was no rural purge.

469
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,360
How was I to know?

470
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,440
I love the character, but you know.

471
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,040
Then the other piece of context to me that was shocking

472
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:44,920
was just how famous Al Cap was.

473
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:47,320
Was like one of the most famous people in the country.

474
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,720
Had a regular spot on The Tonight Show

475
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,880
through Jack Parr, Steve Allen, and Johnny Carson.

476
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,920
That's amazing.

477
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,160
The first thing, the thing,

478
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,600
I'm sure we all have our own favorite Al Cap moments.

479
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,240
Oh yes, do tell.

480
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,960
My favorite one is of course,

481
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,560
him confronting John and Yoko at their sit-in.

482
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,400
Yeah.

483
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,320
Whoa, wait a minute, what?

484
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,160
Yep.

485
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:10,920
So Al Cap, despite being kind of a gadfly,

486
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:14,440
in Later in Life made the turn that Scott Adams

487
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:17,880
is currently doing into conservative maniac.

488
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,200
Or who is the other one you said?

489
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:20,800
PJ O'Rourke.

490
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,360
PJ O'Rourke I think started to lose it towards the end too.

491
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,520
The common syndrome.

492
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,760
But he confronted them in there.

493
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,120
Was this the one where they were in their bedroom?

494
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:27,960
In Montreal, yeah.

495
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:28,800
They loved it?

496
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,600
Basically, they were protesting Vietnam and war

497
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,440
and everything.

498
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,840
But it was really just come hang out and talk to us.

499
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,240
Yeah, so the press came and they talked to them.

500
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,440
But people thought it was like, this is an orgy.

501
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,760
But it, like, more conservative folks, but it wasn't.

502
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,040
It was just them sitting around.

503
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,680
Right, and Al Cap, it's weird

504
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,560
because there's a 10 minute video of it.

505
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,720
It's well preserved.

506
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,920
And he has the photo of them naked.

507
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:53,800
And he's like, you say you're shy, huh?

508
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,840
You two are shy?

509
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,880
And he holds up the photo of them naked.

510
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:00,400
And he's like, oh, shy people taking photos like this.

511
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,120
And they're like, yeah, we're shy.

512
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,440
And honestly, the dialogue is-

513
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,280
Contrary to popular belief,

514
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,600
like, little Abner was not small.

515
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:08,440
Right.

516
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,560
We have duality in this world.

517
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,840
It's like he thought he was gonna come there

518
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,320
and really prove him wrong.

519
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,960
And then it's not particularly interesting.

520
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,600
None of them have anything interesting.

521
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,960
He traveled to Montreal to do this?

522
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,080
Presumably, yeah.

523
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:21,920
At their invite.

524
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,920
Like, showed, oh.

525
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25,640
They asked him to come because by this point-

526
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,120
Oh, he was like very vocal?

527
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:27,960
Yeah, yeah.

528
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:30,840
Little Abner was, I guess, he was like,

529
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:34,560
Auntie McCarthy when that was happening,

530
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:38,800
but then took the turn into becoming a notable hippie hater.

531
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:43,000
He was showing up at schools to yell at protests

532
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,960
and peaceful events.

533
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,640
So John himself thought,

534
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:48,840
well, maybe he can kind of represent.

535
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,280
Well, let's have Al Cap some up.

536
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,560
Yeah, yeah.

537
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,000
Let's talk to Al.

538
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Yeah, it's so bizarre and fascinating and uninteresting.

539
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:58,920
All at once.

540
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,200
Yeah, because I feel like they don't,

541
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,920
they probably just don't care.

542
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:05,040
They just let him wind himself out.

543
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:05,880
Yeah, John let him stay.

544
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,040
He doesn't wanna look stupid.

545
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,560
They kind of start yelling and then, like, Al.

546
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,400
Is there yelling?

547
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,240
Oh, I'm one of their kids.

548
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,480
Yeah, there's yelling that happens.

549
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,720
I mean, not like crazy yelling,

550
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:16,280
but kind of just loud voice yelling,

551
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,440
but he's like trying to,

552
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:21,760
Al Cap is just mad that students are protesting.

553
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,320
This is the thing you keep finding is like,

554
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,080
this is the thing that turned him to conservatism

555
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:28,960
is that he didn't like these spoiled college kids

556
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,760
protesting things they didn't know about.

557
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,680
And that's really all he's in there to say.

558
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,520
And then he's-

559
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,600
These Kent staters shut up.

560
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,640
Everything's fine.

561
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,480
And then he's mad about-

562
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,320
Go to class.

563
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:40,920
He's mad about the lyrics in the Ballad of John and Yoko,

564
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,960
where John says the way things are going,

565
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,280
they're gonna crucify me.

566
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,520
He's like, are they gonna crucify?

567
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,360
What are they gonna do?

568
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,600
They're gonna crucify you, you say?

569
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,720
And then John's just being kind of obtuse as well

570
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,400
and being like, I meant all of us.

571
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,960
I meant we're all going to be.

572
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:53,840
And he's like, what do you mean?

573
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,120
Not me, you don't speak for me.

574
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,720
And then they're just like talking at each other

575
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,760
for two minutes and nothing gets done.

576
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,800
I don't know.

577
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:01,640
It's bizarre.

578
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,480
It's truly bizarre.

579
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,160
When did he die, Al Cap?

580
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,000
70?

581
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:07,720
Yeah.

582
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:10,520
No, so he retired from the comic trip in 77.

583
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,640
He died and he died.

584
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,960
I was thinking he was 70 when he died.

585
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,640
77, yeah.

586
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:18,160
So he didn't see John Lennon killed.

587
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,200
No, he didn't get a statement on that.

588
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,040
Didn't get to celebrate it.

589
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,600
I don't know why I wanna hold him to account

590
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,760
and be like, look.

591
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:24,600
Look what you did.

592
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,120
It happened, sir.

593
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,920
Look what you did now.

594
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:31,440
He was an early guy complaining about safe spaces

595
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,760
on college campuses.

596
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:36,680
He was like a New York Times editorial style crank

597
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:39,200
complaining about these college students.

598
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,520
He doesn't seem like he has any sort of

599
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,240
deep held conservative beliefs.

600
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,320
It felt like he just, like his brain,

601
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:48,840
it felt like he saw a glimpse of Fox News from the future.

602
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,200
It broke his brain and he's just like,

603
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,720
these college kids.

604
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,560
God damn it.

605
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,400
What are they doing?

606
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,440
They don't know what they're talking about.

607
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,800
Isn't that what a lot of it boils down to ultimately?

608
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,040
But you wouldn't have any ideas.

609
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,040
You're young.

610
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,360
I'm old so I have all the ideas.

611
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,280
What do you know about?

612
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,120
Yeah, it's the-

613
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,680
I've lived long enough.

614
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,800
Look at purely at age.

615
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:12,080
70, you know more than at 29.

616
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,440
My age is a bigger number.

617
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,280
My age is bigger.

618
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,200
You don't understand.

619
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,560
I have unlimited money.

620
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,640
I'm authority figure.

621
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,000
I can leverage my celebrity.

622
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,200
So much of the political problems,

623
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:27,520
whether it's probably like racially or just from age,

624
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,760
are just, I don't want to be replaced.

625
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,600
Yeah.

626
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:33,480
People have this terrifying feeling of being replaced.

627
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,280
I love how we're just going down this road too,

628
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,800
but I have a pet theory,

629
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,760
which is that conservatism is,

630
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,480
they're both rooted in a fear of death.

631
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,560
So conservatism is a fear of being replaced.

632
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:47,000
Fear of change will lead to death.

633
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,520
And then there's also, if we don't change,

634
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:53,240
we will be eradicated by that change

635
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,680
because change is happening whether we want to or not.

636
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,520
That makes sense.

637
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,240
So we would be destroyed by not changing.

638
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,080
Right.

639
00:20:59,080 --> 00:20:59,920
Yeah.

640
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:00,760
I hear that.

641
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,960
Wow, that's an eloquent way to put it.

642
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:03,800
Yeah, you're welcome guys.

643
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:04,800
And that's what I think.

644
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:05,640
I'm gonna take a little link.

645
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,480
And that helps.

646
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:10,080
Change is the only constant, as my meditation tells me.

647
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,880
As my meditation tells me.

648
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,720
Change is the only constant.

649
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:17,120
So yeah, Al Cap presages a lot of nasty stuff.

650
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,360
I should say as a result of that encounter,

651
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:23,400
Paul McCartney ended up calling Al Cap a wicked old git.

652
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,280
That's amazing.

653
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,920
Get him Paul, get him Paul, drag him Paul.

654
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,160
Like he didn't do a lot of dragging necessarily.

655
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,000
There's some.

656
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,800
He would drag John in a song or two.

657
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:34,640
Sure.

658
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,560
But then he would just show up

659
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,160
at his apartment at the Dakotas.

660
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,480
Yeah, they get in the shit the next week.

661
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,720
Watch SNL.

662
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:44,200
I read that John asked him not to come by unannounced anymore

663
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,720
when they had their baby.

664
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,280
He was like, hey man, you can't just stop by.

665
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,320
And then Paul got really pissed.

666
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:54,320
Like fuck you, you know what I mean?

667
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,040
Okay, but then a few months later it was fine.

668
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,320
He just had to call ahead.

669
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,160
Oh.

670
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,000
Yeah.

671
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,120
But his weirdy concerns were probably smart.

672
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,200
Yeah.

673
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,040
Isn't that weird?

674
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,440
He's just like walking.

675
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:09,360
I mean, I guess in New York, I guess you're just like.

676
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,200
Yeah.

677
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,040
On the street.

678
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,640
We could go down that road.

679
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,480
Yeah.

680
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,320
Yeah.

681
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,160
That's a dark one.

682
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,000
That's a dark one.

683
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:16,840
Yeah boy.

684
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,600
So there's multiple books about Al Cap.

685
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,600
One of which is called.

686
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,440
Good.

687
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,720
The one which is called The Enigma of Al Cap.

688
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,560
Which is a good.

689
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:24,400
Okay.

690
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,440
It is a good title because he was pro gay rights

691
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,120
and pro civil rights.

692
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:32,160
But he also had over half a dozen cases

693
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:35,120
of indecent exposure and sexual harassment.

694
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:35,960
What?

695
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:36,800
Yes.

696
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,800
To the likes of Goldie Hawn.

697
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:40,640
What?

698
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,480
And Grace Kelly.

699
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:43,400
Again, one of the most, yeah.

700
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,440
This is a theme park I went to when I was five.

701
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,280
It was a theme park you went to when you were five.

702
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,360
And now I'm like Al Cap showed himself to Goldie.

703
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,560
Which is like what?

704
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,400
Mm-hmm.

705
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,240
So.

706
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,080
Look what it leads to.

707
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,760
The innocent things in your childhood.

708
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,440
These things are now encroaching on the,

709
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,880
like the last little bit of memory I have of this nice time.

710
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,920
We brought you here to ruin your memories.

711
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,480
Even this sucks.

712
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:07,080
You going on Earthquake Magoon's Brain Rattler

713
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,600
was problematic.

714
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,440
Yeah.

715
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,280
To block, to unpack.

716
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,880
Your blood's on your hands as much as anybody.

717
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:12,720
Yeah.

718
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,320
And then Richard Nixon shows up.

719
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:17,360
No, no, no.

720
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:21,560
Richard Nixon and Spiro Agnew tried to convince him

721
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:25,560
to Al Cap to run for Senator in Massachusetts

722
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:27,000
against Ted Kennedy.

723
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,000
Wow.

724
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,080
And then to post, Seymour Hersh,

725
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:36,080
New Yorker journalist Seymour Hersh reported

726
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:40,000
that there are tapes of Nixon talking about Al Cap

727
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,760
in the Oval Office and one of the sexual harassment cases.

728
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,440
Like it's gonna be bad if we're associated with him.

729
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,560
Cause he was friendly with the White House.

730
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,560
Oh my God.

731
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,400
Yeah.

732
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,800
Oh geez, the time when that was true.

733
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:53,640
Yeah.

734
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,480
You had to disavow sexual harassment.

735
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,320
You had to disavow.

736
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:56,920
We can't touch that guy.

737
00:23:56,920 --> 00:24:01,920
There was also an event where he was goes and goes

738
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,840
and horrible fact number 89 about Al Cap.

739
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:06,240
Did you know this about Al Cap?

740
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,560
It's gonna be like the, what was it,

741
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:12,760
the poetry almanac on NPR where there's just two minutes

742
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:15,640
of this every evening on NPR.

743
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,440
We're gonna have to make this a regular feature.

744
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,480
In the next kind of piano.

745
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,800
A new Al Cap fact.

746
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:21,960
Did you know?

747
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,120
Did you know?

748
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,240
That at least four college students accused him

749
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:30,600
of harassment and there was pretty like incontrovertible

750
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,760
proof of this and so he was backed into a corner

751
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:35,520
and unlike a lot of people he was punished for what he did.

752
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,240
He had to pay a fine of $500.

753
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,600
Jesus.

754
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,360
Justice was brought.

755
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,920
This was when he was already famous.

756
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:43,760
Yeah.

757
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:46,400
This was like a year before the Lenin.

758
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,240
Yeah.

759
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,080
Okay.

760
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,880
He was like don't protest but come over here.

761
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,080
Right and then you're like that's super.

762
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,000
Maybe if you relaxed a little more.

763
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,840
You wouldn't have all that angry energy.

764
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:58,680
He's sexually harassing college students

765
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:01,480
but it's like don't go outside and hold a sign

766
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:04,240
because you don't know anything about Vietnam.

767
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,640
It also feels like today.

768
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,600
Like the weird double like.

769
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,200
Yeah it's like I hate this cartoon

770
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,640
but I hit my kids until they bleed.

771
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,480
Right.

772
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,760
It's like oh and that's good.

773
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,320
It's like okay.

774
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,280
And then you go to a priest

775
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,280
because you're concerned about this

776
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:21,400
and he's like I think I'd agree that that's good.

777
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,240
Yeah exactly.

778
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,360
The church is.

779
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,200
Good on you for hitting him.

780
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,040
Yeah.

781
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,160
This needs to be learned.

782
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:28,960
He was interviewed or something

783
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:32,200
and somebody asked him about the harassment of colleges

784
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,320
and he goes you know those college dames or something.

785
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,160
Oh my God.

786
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,000
Jesus.

787
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,840
He wasn't even really.

788
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:39,600
So the college dames and the protesters.

789
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,240
He was infuriated by the colleges

790
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,680
but then he went to all the colleges to speak.

791
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,800
Well he it's like the people now.

792
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:46,640
The like.

793
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,480
Milo's.

794
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,320
Yeah Milo.

795
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,160
Exactly.

796
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,560
This is again it's exactly like now.

797
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,720
It's all coming back around.

798
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,560
I'll take their money.

799
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:54,400
Those idiots.

800
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,240
Yeah.

801
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,760
I'll grab them inappropriately.

802
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:57,600
He was just going.

803
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,520
But I hate them.

804
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,600
To be a pain in the ass.

805
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,760
Just go and be a pain in the ass

806
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:03,480
and then in his comic strips he would do things like

807
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:06,440
parody Senator Ted Kennedy with the character

808
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,920
Senator O'Noble McJester.

809
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,040
Wow.

810
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:11,960
O'Noble McJester.

811
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:12,800
Maybe this is a good.

812
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:13,640
That's funny.

813
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,480
I mean that's funny right there.

814
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,600
This is a good point to say that this comic strip

815
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,480
seems to be incomprehensible.

816
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,440
Incomprehensible and modern standard.

817
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,360
Nobody's reading this for fun today.

818
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,680
Was this a daily or like a weekly?

819
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,520
Like a Sunday?

820
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,360
Seven days a week.

821
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,200
Seven days a week.

822
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,040
Black and white and color Sunday.

823
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:27,880
With the big one on Sunday.

824
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:28,720
Yeah.

825
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,400
Also by the end was checked out.

826
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,640
Had a lot of assistance including

827
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,800
the painter Frank Franzetta.

828
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:36,640
The guy.

829
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,480
Oh my God.

830
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,320
Yes.

831
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,800
That's crazy.

832
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:42,840
He became famous for painting book covers

833
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,440
of like Conan and Tarzan.

834
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,280
It's incredible.

835
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,320
And kind of fantasy art.

836
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,520
Yes set the standard for what we think of

837
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,920
like the visual language of fantasy.

838
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:54,360
Like Schwarzenegger was able to step into that

839
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:55,200
kind of painting style.

840
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,040
Oh that like set the vision of this is what

841
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:57,880
the film needs to be.

842
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:58,720
Yeah.

843
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,560
Wow.

844
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,640
Like the tooth necklace.

845
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,480
You know what I mean?

846
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,320
Came out of his.

847
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,160
I mean all that stuff.

848
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,000
Invention.

849
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:04,840
Yeah.

850
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:08,320
And like very male oriented where like it's the,

851
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,000
like the Star Wars poster.

852
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:10,920
Where Luke has the lights.

853
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:13,960
It's very reminiscent of that kind of pose.

854
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,840
Which doesn't feel like the movie exactly.

855
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,680
No.

856
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,520
It's kind of a different slant.

857
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,680
This is also fantasy.

858
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,720
You're kind of fantasy.

859
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,080
Al Cap type fantasy.

860
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:25,880
I just saw a Star Wars poster where like the,

861
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:28,400
whatever Luke and Leia were unrecognizable.

862
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:31,720
Like there's these big like King Scandinavians.

863
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,320
Like who are these characters?

864
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,640
I've never seen these characters.

865
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,480
There's a lot of that art.

866
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:38,400
And even like Ralph McCrory art originally.

867
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:41,200
Like it's like makes it look like a much.

868
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,480
Sexy or sleeker.

869
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,480
Like cool.

870
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,080
I have this is, I mean I'll admit this.

871
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,920
I have in my office I have the statue of his

872
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:51,160
like original Stormtrooper where it had a shield

873
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,400
and a lightsaber.

874
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,360
Every Stormtrooper was gonna like,

875
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:55,920
that was a conception that every Stormtrooper

876
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:56,760
would have a lightsaber.

877
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:59,840
And it does look like very sophisticated

878
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,680
like Robert Heinlein type.

879
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,000
Yeah that book is all the art.

880
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,360
That's C3PO.

881
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,200
That's an original picture of.

882
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,520
Oh this Metropolis C3PO we've always.

883
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,600
Yeah that's McCrory.

884
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,440
Oh gotcha.

885
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,280
Huh huh.

886
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:15,400
So anyway it was born in Holler really all of this stuff.

887
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,400
Yeah sorry I was back to the.

888
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:21,720
Also all right just quick rundown of things.

889
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:25,200
He was hit by a trolley at age nine and lost his leg.

890
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,680
So if he's bitter.

891
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,760
Yeah yeah.

892
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,720
All of this like sexually harassing people

893
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:30,560
with the one leg.

894
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:35,800
One legged sexual harasser conservative

895
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,240
who confronted John Lennon.

896
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,840
We need to rewrite his like main bio on his Wikipedia.

897
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,640
So basically Dogpatch is the least interesting fact

898
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,480
about him.

899
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,320
Yes kind of.

900
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,680
It's like way down on the list.

901
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,520
Well no.

902
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,280
Dogpatch is very interesting.

903
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,720
But his relationship to Dogpatch is like

904
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:52,320
that's a blip in his vivid life.

905
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:56,800
So much so that it did not even make it into his obituary.

906
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,640
When he died it wasn't even mentioned.

907
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,800
That's how much Dogpatch was not even

908
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,960
that it had fallen in cultural relevance.

909
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:03,920
Right.

910
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:04,760
That he was yeah.

911
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,080
That you would think you would mention like

912
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,080
you know he has a theme park.

913
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,800
Like that'll probably be in Dolly Parton's obituary.

914
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,640
That she has a theme park.

915
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,920
But she's been there more than once.

916
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,800
Which I'm not sure Outkapp did.

917
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:19,160
If Outkapp was like at the opening of all the rides

918
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,000
and stuff.

919
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,680
Yeah we have to see if he went.

920
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:23,520
Did he go?

921
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:26,000
He went to the ground breaking and then the grand opening.

922
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,960
I don't know how many times after that.

923
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:30,640
And his son was like a PR guy

924
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,800
for at least a little while early on.

925
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,640
And he there's this.

926
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,000
Can you get my boy a job?

927
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:35,840
That's what that sounds like.

928
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:36,920
Yeah it does.

929
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,160
Can you get him a job at the place?

930
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,400
Loser something to do.

931
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,800
Yeah just throw him at the park.

932
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:41,640
You'll figure it out.

933
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:42,480
Call Dogpatch.

934
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,480
No look I'm up.

935
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,520
I'm a little bastard.

936
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,000
There's footage of him.

937
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,760
I found a piece in that documentary.

938
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,560
I think it's called Life and Time's a Dogpatch.

939
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:53,760
You can watch him.

940
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:58,760
Okay so shot zooms out of a woman chasing a man

941
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,120
out of a bar or something.

942
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,520
Like screaming at him.

943
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,240
Which who knows what that was.

944
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,680
Did they get into a tussle?

945
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,520
What was it?

946
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:09,200
But like just screaming hillbillies.

947
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,120
Come tearing out of a bar.

948
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:14,320
And then he reveals Outkapp who says

949
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:19,360
oh boy looks like another typical terrifying day in Dogpatch.

950
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,880
Even worse than it is in my comic.

951
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,080
Wow.

952
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:25,280
The pleasant world of Dogpatch.

953
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,360
Do you want the harrowing version of Dogpatch?

954
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,000
Where it's like we're gonna do an update of Dogpatch

955
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,440
but it's gonna be dark.

956
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,920
No it's gonna be like dark okay.

957
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,880
Like the CW's dog perch.

958
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:36,800
Watch this.

959
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,840
Honestly Dogpatch on CW.

960
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:39,680
Did you have this?

961
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:40,520
We're gonna make it scary.

962
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:41,360
Yeah it's viable enough.

963
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:46,560
Okay well we could list Outkapp things all day.

964
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:49,040
But I think it's also good to say he.

965
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:51,400
Well okay so he invented the phrases hogwash.

966
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,960
Whoa.

967
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,480
And double whammy.

968
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,320
What?

969
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,140
He thought of these.

970
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:58,320
These were like little turns of phrase in his thing.

971
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,040
Which those are low.

972
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,680
That speaks to his interesting writing

973
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:04,280
that he coined these terms.

974
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:07,640
And he also invented the idea of Sadie Hawkins day.

975
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,480
When girls.

976
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,400
This podcast is gonna be me being surprised.

977
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:13,240
Every time you guys talk I'm like are you kidding me?

978
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,560
Like I'm the guy in the car.

979
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:17,360
Like I might as well just be listening and going whoa.

980
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,200
Sadie Hawkins.

981
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,360
And then I tell it to my wife later like

982
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,520
he invented Sadie Hawkins.

983
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,360
What?

984
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:24,320
Sadie Hawkins was a character.

985
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,400
Was a character in the comic strip.

986
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,240
What?

987
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,400
And you know now Sadie Hawkins,

988
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,520
my wife's a high school teacher.

989
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,360
Very problematic.

990
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,200
Oh yeah.

991
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,040
Very problematic.

992
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:32,860
Yes right right.

993
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:33,700
Because it was that Sadie Hawkins dances

994
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:34,680
when the girl asks the boy

995
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,160
which is not how it's usually done.

996
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,800
The boy usually asks the girl.

997
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:38,640
Yes.

998
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,360
And they don't call him that anymore.

999
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:42,160
And I think they like getting away

1000
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,520
from the kind of gendered practice.

1001
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:44,360
Yeah.

1002
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:47,240
We had it was called Turnabout in my high school.

1003
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,880
Ours was called Snowball.

1004
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:49,720
Oh interesting.

1005
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:52,000
Cause it was invented in December for some reason.

1006
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:52,840
We didn't have it.

1007
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:53,960
It was like a Christmas dance.

1008
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,920
We just didn't do that.

1009
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,120
They were like no dances.

1010
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,640
It was the only one that I went to

1011
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:02,120
because I wasn't brave enough to ask girls.

1012
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,920
I did get asked.

1013
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,280
But then you were immediately asked.

1014
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,120
Yeah.

1015
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:06,960
It's gotta be great validation.

1016
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,080
I was asked but it was like a weird,

1017
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:13,240
she was trying to get somebody else off of her tail.

1018
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,080
Oh.

1019
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:17,560
She was like actually trying to chase another guy away.

1020
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,400
Yeah yeah yeah.

1021
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,320
Yeah.

1022
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,160
And then I bought,

1023
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,680
I didn't know how this stuff worked

1024
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:22,520
cause I didn't go to,

1025
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:23,920
this is the only dance I went to in high school.

1026
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:28,200
So I bought her the hugest just wrist consuming corsage.

1027
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,040
It has a wrist corsage

1028
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,880
cause you won't go near her body.

1029
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,160
No that's extremely,

1030
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,000
I did the same thing.

1031
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,800
I was like wrists, wrists all the way.

1032
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:35,640
Felt safe too.

1033
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,640
Yeah sure sure.

1034
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,480
But then it was like hideous.

1035
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,280
I think I gave her the option.

1036
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,120
Like you don't have to wear it.

1037
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:41,960
And she was like okay.

1038
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:42,920
You just put it in the seat.

1039
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,920
Yeah it just sat at the tables.

1040
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:45,760
Back there.

1041
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,800
And we barely hung out during the night.

1042
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,280
Oh she'd just take off?

1043
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:50,120
Yeah yeah yeah.

1044
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,440
No we barely, she was with her friends

1045
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,520
and I was with mine and it was all,

1046
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,920
I was a political pawn.

1047
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:57,920
I hate vice versa day.

1048
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:58,760
Abolish it.

1049
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:01,800
Wrist corsages are prom only.

1050
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:02,800
For the others,

1051
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:05,160
flowers from the gas station will suffice.

1052
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,400
Well now I know.

1053
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,240
For the next high school dance I go to.

1054
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:11,880
For underclassmen formals that was my go to.

1055
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:14,520
Cause that was, I was 14, 15.

1056
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:16,680
That was the money I had for.

1057
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,320
Gas station flowers?

1058
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,520
Yeah the gas station has flowers.

1059
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:21,120
Like what shelf can you walk into

1060
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,800
and be like I think there's flowers over there.

1061
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,120
I mean in dog patch maybe.

1062
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,240
No what dog patch?

1063
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,080
Can I have some of those?

1064
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,760
Backwards dog patch situation.

1065
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:29,600
Where you in?

1066
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,400
I got flowers for a formal at a gas station.

1067
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,120
US oil and florist.

1068
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:36,640
It was just a little basket.

1069
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,080
We got fresh roses.

1070
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:38,920
And hot fries.

1071
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,520
Gas station flowers.

1072
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:41,360
Hot fries.

1073
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,200
We got hot fries.

1074
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,040
Flower hot fries combo special.

1075
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:43,880
We got hot fries, we got carnations.

1076
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:44,720
Hot fries, tasty cakes.

1077
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:45,560
What do you want?

1078
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,400
We got coffee but it's like four days old.

1079
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,040
We got unfiltereds.

1080
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,000
Weird did the.

1081
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:50,840
And a weird drink.

1082
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:53,080
The sitcom off the street.

1083
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:53,920
Wait, wait, wait.

1084
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,760
Coke flavored slurpee.

1085
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:56,920
So like they were big full like roses?

1086
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:59,120
Yeah it was just like a $10 thing of roses.

1087
00:33:59,120 --> 00:33:59,960
Where would the girl put them

1088
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:00,800
while the dance was happening?

1089
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,280
Yeah you put it on the bleachers.

1090
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,120
Yeah that's fine.

1091
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,480
You just leave it at your dinner table right?

1092
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:05,880
Did you have the dinner at the prom?

1093
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:06,720
No it was just a.

1094
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,560
No it was just the dance.

1095
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:08,400
Oh you just go right to the dance?

1096
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,240
It was just the gym.

1097
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:10,800
I think I always just drop them in the ground

1098
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,880
and park them out of the way in.

1099
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:12,720
Yeah it was.

1100
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:13,760
That's what I think it is.

1101
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,560
I probably was like oh I think this is

1102
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,560
what you're supposed to do

1103
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,360
because I've seen it on television.

1104
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,560
Like it wasn't even.

1105
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:22,160
I feel like my mom just took over in that instance.

1106
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,480
I don't think I was actually,

1107
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,520
she was just like I'm going to Jewel

1108
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,360
and getting you the thing.

1109
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,440
I feel like that happened.

1110
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,160
Yeah exactly it was the grocery store.

1111
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:30,000
Yeah.

1112
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:30,840
You go get it out of the.

1113
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:31,660
Yes.

1114
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:34,240
But you were entrusted to go and find flowers.

1115
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:35,920
I think I just called the shop.

1116
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,760
I was like oh let's just stop.

1117
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:38,600
I'll get some flowers.

1118
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,440
You were calling the shops.

1119
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,280
I think yeah I was usually calling shops.

1120
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,120
Mom stop here.

1121
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:42,960
And you weren't driving.

1122
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,480
Because the gas station flowers make sense

1123
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:47,040
if you're like on the way I'll gas up.

1124
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,080
I'll grab the flowers.

1125
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:48,920
I'm going to go buy them.

1126
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:49,760
But you're like in the back seat.

1127
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:50,600
I didn't get.

1128
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,440
And you're like mom no no.

1129
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:54,280
Mom I gotta go buy my old lady some flowers.

1130
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,440
Can we stop at the Texaco?

1131
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,280
At the straight flowers.

1132
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,120
You know I.

1133
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:01,480
They're wilted from the unlit, like the fumes.

1134
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:02,520
Yeah.

1135
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:03,480
Those are beautiful.

1136
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:04,720
Where'd you get these?

1137
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,400
They got a good 15 minutes in them

1138
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:09,000
when they get delivered and then shrivel.

1139
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,440
I don't know that that many people were bringing.

1140
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:14,200
This is for like freshman, sophomore form.

1141
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,520
I don't know that that many people.

1142
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:20,280
I think like me thinking ahead was above and beyond.

1143
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:22,320
I don't know that that many people even brought flowers.

1144
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,120
Because it was such just a rinky dink.

1145
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,920
We just dressed a little nicer.

1146
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,200
You didn't have to do it.

1147
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,240
I didn't have to do it.

1148
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,440
But I was like I guess this is what you do.

1149
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:32,280
So you were like you should be applauded

1150
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,640
for the gas station flowers.

1151
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:34,480
Yeah.

1152
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,760
Were you wearing a shirt and tie for the dances?

1153
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:37,600
And a coat.

1154
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,400
Yeah whatever suit I owned at the time.

1155
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:42,360
That's a lot nicer than what you were wearing at high school.

1156
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,600
But it was still just in the gym.

1157
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,440
No we know that.

1158
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,960
I'm just saying you just said like we didn't wear that.

1159
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,560
Like we didn't get that fancily dressed.

1160
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:52,160
Oh it was nicer than what I wore.

1161
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:55,200
Yeah I was wondering if you all started some polo shirts.

1162
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,520
Whatever department store.

1163
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:01,000
Well look we gotta go back to 30 more alt cap facts real quick.

1164
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:01,880
Also.

1165
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:02,960
If you got gas station flowers.

1166
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,280
My mind is already blown.

1167
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:06,200
About alt cap.

1168
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:09,320
Jason's trying to steal the focus from alt cap

1169
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:11,680
with things from his life.

1170
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,400
Just to run through it really fast.

1171
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,080
Sadie Hawkins day was a problem at the time

1172
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,760
because in the real story in the comic

1173
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:19,600
Sadie was quote the homeliest gal in all the hills.

1174
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:20,520
That's why they changed the name.

1175
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:21,360
Okay okay sure.

1176
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,640
Okay so that's known.

1177
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:23,480
The people don't want to attribute this.

1178
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:26,400
I remember that's vaguely it's like the name doesn't.

1179
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,840
It kind of connotes like a wall flower.

1180
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:31,240
If you look at Sadie Hawkins from the comic

1181
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:33,800
she's basically a female Alfred E Newman.

1182
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:34,640
Oh my god.

1183
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:37,040
She is very grotesque and her father

1184
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:39,680
is basically like bribing men to ask her out

1185
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:43,120
because he's worried that she's going to suffer

1186
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,960
the worst humiliation a woman could ever experience.

1187
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:47,960
Being an old maid because she is 35.

1188
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:48,800
35.

1189
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,800
This happens in It's a Wonderful Life too.

1190
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,240
That was the bad thing that happens to Mary.

1191
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:57,160
Is that Donna Reed is that George never existed.

1192
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:59,840
So Mary becomes an old maid and she's walking out

1193
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:04,200
of the library dressed in black with heavy wind.

1194
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:07,200
She's holding her coat closed and you're like wow.

1195
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,720
I think that's one of the things where he's like

1196
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,280
oh my god Mary.

1197
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,120
That's a big thing.

1198
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:11,960
It's a big deal.

1199
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,560
Clarence is horrified.

1200
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,720
Clarence is like she's at the library.

1201
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,120
Look at her.

1202
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:17,960
She's childless.

1203
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,560
She's learning instead of fucking.

1204
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:22,680
I said there's this song from the Little Admirers

1205
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:26,240
stage musical that was made into a movie

1206
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:28,760
called I'm Past My Prime.

1207
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:31,520
And the joke is this 18 year old girl is past her prime

1208
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,160
and she's a very attractive woman.

1209
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:34,000
No.

1210
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,520
I think it's still sort of a joke, played for a joke.

1211
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,480
But still it seems to be a common,

1212
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,840
obviously it was a thing in the culture at the time.

1213
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:43,440
We all need a cigarette break or something.

1214
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,160
This is a stressful episode.

1215
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,000
What a legacy.

1216
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:48,840
What a legacy.

1217
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,680
He kicked it right in 77.

1218
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:52,640
He didn't feel any of this.

1219
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:53,480
We are carrying.

1220
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,320
None of the backlash.

1221
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:57,360
We all are carrying his burden with us.

1222
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,200
Where we live in the world.

1223
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,040
He left a lot of damage in his wake.

1224
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:01,040
The hole he dug.

1225
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:01,880
Yeah.

1226
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,720
Gotta get out of that alcap hole.

1227
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:06,880
We're all, Evan's talking about too many franchises

1228
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:07,800
remaking the same thing.

1229
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:08,720
I looked at IMDB.

1230
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:12,520
There are four different little Abner projects listed.

1231
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:14,440
Over the span of, no not now.

1232
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:19,280
Fox has got one, Paramount, co-financed with Universal.

1233
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,760
Torn between Disney and Sony.

1234
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:21,600
They're in a big fight over that.

1235
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:25,280
We just said Sony couldn't use little Abner.

1236
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,560
Little Abner can't be in the Avengers anymore.

1237
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:28,720
He's out of the MCU.

1238
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:33,000
There's a 67, there's a 71, there's a 1940,

1239
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:37,280
and there's a 60, 59.

1240
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,120
Oh my God.

1241
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:38,960
Various media.

1242
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,200
Every era.

1243
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,720
And a Broadway show.

1244
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:42,560
Geez.

1245
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,400
And a Broadway show.

1246
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,840
Ran for three years I believe.

1247
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,880
And then MGM musical.

1248
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,360
The golden age of MGM musicals.

1249
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:50,680
The little Abner.

1250
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:52,480
Is that the highest production value one?

1251
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,360
Yeah, that's the one.

1252
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,400
Hold on.

1253
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,880
Little Abner comes alive 1959.

1254
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:58,720
Okay.

1255
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,800
So as that stuff's dying out.

1256
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,720
Where it's like, look!

1257
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:03,560
Technicolor.

1258
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:04,840
Yes.

1259
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:08,000
Martin Scorsese is like, fuck this.

1260
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,080
We're getting gritty.

1261
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:12,880
There's no more 90 dancers on an obvious soundstage.

1262
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,360
Arthur Penn is like, well I'm gonna do something.

1263
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:16,040
Or shoot on location.

1264
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:17,280
Shoot in a real house.

1265
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,640
You're out of your fucking mind.

1266
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:19,480
Get out of here.

1267
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,320
I'm gonna wear a gun shooting a real house.

1268
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:23,440
Going to dangerous New York to do that if you.

1269
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,960
In 71 it looks like there was like a

1270
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,680
hee haw type show with the characters.

1271
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,960
Oh I think that was the TV pilot

1272
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,680
that they aired as a TV special.

1273
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:32,520
Right.

1274
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:33,560
I saw that they had a didn't, yes.

1275
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:35,600
And then, well didn't they make a TV pilot?

1276
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,960
Dogpatch was like, oh there's gonna be a TV show.

1277
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,480
And then the pilot didn't go.

1278
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,800
There was gonna be a restaurant.

1279
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,640
There was a lot of changes.

1280
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:42,480
There was gonna be a restaurant change.

1281
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,320
And the TV pilot.

1282
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:45,080
And then both didn't happen,

1283
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:47,760
and Dogpatch suffered the consequences.

1284
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:48,600
Right.

1285
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:51,560
There was an unsold Lil Abner pilot in 67.

1286
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:52,400
Oh that was 60th season.

1287
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,240
Oh Jesus.

1288
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:55,800
They were trying, they were throwing everything at this.

1289
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,640
What about Lil Abner?

1290
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:01,160
When it's just, every room, every week.

1291
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:03,520
Wouldn't you wanna do something with Lil Abner?

1292
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,920
Have we not been down this road before?

1293
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:05,760
Which one is that?

1294
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:06,600
Lil Abner, you know.

1295
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:07,800
He's a big guy.

1296
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,640
It's not a cute little child.

1297
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:10,840
No, no, it's a big guy.

1298
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:11,680
Big strapping guy.

1299
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:12,520
Sadie Hawkins.

1300
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:13,340
That's funny, that's funny.

1301
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:14,180
Yeah, Sadie Hawkins.

1302
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:15,020
Hilarious.

1303
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:15,840
She's ugly as shit.

1304
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:16,680
An ugly girl.

1305
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:17,520
That would be hilarious.

1306
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,120
There's nobody to be interested in.

1307
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:19,960
Movie?

1308
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:20,800
Movie of the week?

1309
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:21,620
Broadway play.

1310
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:22,460
What do you wanna do?

1311
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:23,300
Theme park.

1312
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:24,140
Radio jingle?

1313
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:26,480
After this podcast comes out,

1314
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:29,120
that is the conversation we'll all be hearing

1315
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:30,760
in rooms across the town.

1316
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:33,200
I know, it's just if this will kickstart.

1317
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,240
Yeah, we'll be competing.

1318
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:35,080
Yeah, right.

1319
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:37,040
Comics are taking on Lil Abner next week.

1320
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,600
Scott's going in the week after.

1321
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:41,280
It's after Labor Day though, so I think I have it.

1322
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:44,040
Comic strips are like little comic books.

1323
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:46,400
Some might even call them quick bites

1324
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,160
of comic books.

1325
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:51,240
And I think there's a new, it's called Queeby, folks.

1326
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,680
So if somebody can think of Queeby.

1327
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:53,520
Queeby.

1328
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:54,360
Is it Queeby?

1329
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,680
I thought it was Queeby.

1330
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,120
It's not Kibbe.

1331
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:58,480
No, I don't think so.

1332
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,400
It's in the.

1333
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,540
I don't mean to make fun of,

1334
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:01,680
we're probably all working for Queeby.

1335
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:02,520
Oh no, no, we're two seconds.

1336
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:03,360
We'll all be working there.

1337
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,200
I was there yesterday.

1338
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:05,040
I was in the building.

1339
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,920
And it's like, you think this is a Queeby thing?

1340
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:09,440
And I'm like, I don't know what that is.

1341
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:10,280
I was there, I was there.

1342
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,560
I got that email, I was like, I don't know.

1343
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:12,400
I'm sorry.

1344
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,480
There's no way they're gonna figure this out

1345
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:17,760
We heard your podcast.

1346
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:19,600
That was funny.

1347
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,760
We're doing a little ad show.

1348
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:22,840
You guys are out.

1349
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:24,760
I did just take it.

1350
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:27,240
I was at a general at Queeby yesterday

1351
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:29,160
and the guy asked me no questions.

1352
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:31,000
Oh no.

1353
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:31,820
So yeah, here's the thing.

1354
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:32,660
Here's what Queeby's looking for.

1355
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:34,280
And that's kind of the Queeby ethos.

1356
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,800
And anyway, look, I gotta run.

1357
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,640
I got a meeting with Wayne Brady.

1358
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:39,480
Yeah, pretty much.

1359
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:41,040
His office is gonna be closed in six months.

1360
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:41,960
There's gonna be a phone on the floor.

1361
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:42,800
You gotta get out of here.

1362
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:43,640
You gotta get the side.

1363
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:44,460
I'm gonna rip through this thing.

1364
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:45,600
Now they're really not gonna take a minute.

1365
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,600
I already had my general.

1366
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:49,120
What else is gonna happen?

1367
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:51,680
But if you go in and say the phrase,

1368
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:54,440
if you could work in the phrase Kickapoo Joy Juice.

1369
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:55,280
Yes.

1370
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,760
That's the moonshine from the caves.

1371
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:58,600
That's right.

1372
00:41:58,600 --> 00:41:59,440
That's the moonshine.

1373
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,280
The moonshine.

1374
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:02,280
And I guess you could have this at the park, I think.

1375
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:04,120
Yeah, so one important thing to know

1376
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:05,480
is that in the world of dog patch,

1377
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:07,680
you could drink Kickapoo Joy Juice,

1378
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:10,200
a liquor of stupefying potency.

1379
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:14,360
The recipe for Kickapoo Joy Juice is,

1380
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:17,480
it's a bunch of, I mean, it's liquors and stuff

1381
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:20,160
and gasoline and whatever, but then weird,

1382
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:22,520
you gotta soak a grizzly bear in it

1383
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:25,520
or a panther or a horseshoe or an anvil.

1384
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:27,160
A lot of backwoodsy shit goes in there.

1385
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:29,280
Was it alcoholic in the park?

1386
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,120
I don't know.

1387
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:30,960
That's unclear, right?

1388
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:31,780
Not sure.

1389
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:32,620
Couldn't have been back then.

1390
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:35,680
It's like the blue milk in Galaxy's Edge or Butterbeer.

1391
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:38,640
It's better blue or milk Kickapoo,

1392
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:39,640
I'm sorry, blue or milk.

1393
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:40,480
Blue Kickapoo.

1394
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:41,320
Or Kickapoo milk.

1395
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:42,280
Kickapoo milk.

1396
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:43,760
That sounds bad.

1397
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:44,920
It all sounds bad.

1398
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:45,840
They had a, but they.

1399
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:48,960
I mean, I don't, that might have been why my dad was like,

1400
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,560
let's go to dog patch.

1401
00:42:50,560 --> 00:43:11,880
Oh, he was getting nothing on

1402
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:13,040
I'm gonna finish this.

1403
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:14,120
Let me finish this off.

1404
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:17,400
I will get back in the car and try for another hour.

1405
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:19,680
I was fishing for a trout and then I reeled it in

1406
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,120
and it was my dad.

1407
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:23,440
My dad was face down in the paddle boat.

1408
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:29,840
I do remember fishing at the trout pond, catching it,

1409
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:33,840
taking it to the place where they clean it, fry it,

1410
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:35,200
and I ate it.

1411
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:36,040
Wow.

1412
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:36,880
That was crazy.

1413
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:39,840
That was like my lunch that was at dog patch.

1414
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:40,680
Wow.

1415
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:41,500
Yeah.

1416
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:45,140
I think there was a trout farm initially, this property.

1417
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:46,140
So that was like a thing.

1418
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:46,980
Yeah.

1419
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:47,820
You could have fished for trout,

1420
00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:49,580
but it wouldn't have been as codified

1421
00:43:49,580 --> 00:43:51,820
and as much of a process.

1422
00:43:51,820 --> 00:43:55,020
But I did catch a trout, fry it, and eat it.

1423
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:57,700
This is like if you could catch a trout

1424
00:43:57,700 --> 00:43:59,580
in a Little Mermaid ride or something,

1425
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:02,740
or you could get a flounder and eat it.

1426
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:04,140
That would be too morose,

1427
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:05,500
but I mean, you know what I'm saying?

1428
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:07,340
You could live in the universe.

1429
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:08,540
You could fish from that big fish bucket,

1430
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:10,620
the fish net at California Adventure.

1431
00:44:10,620 --> 00:44:11,460
Right.

1432
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:12,300
The photo op.

1433
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:13,660
If you got to kill the Ronto,

1434
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:16,300
you ate at the Ronto Roaster at Galaxy's Edge.

1435
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:17,140
Yes.

1436
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:17,980
Before you ate it.

1437
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:19,900
With a big spear and then, oh yeah baby.

1438
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:20,980
Although I guess it's not real,

1439
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:23,780
so this is actually, you would kill something and eat it.

1440
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:24,620
I did, yeah.

1441
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:25,460
You killed something, yeah.

1442
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:27,060
I was too young to realize this is disturbing,

1443
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:28,820
but it was like, now we'll eat the fish.

1444
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:30,780
And I was like, oh, we eat fish?

1445
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:31,780
Would you fish now?

1446
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:34,180
Would you take your boys to fish?

1447
00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:35,460
Catch and release.

1448
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:36,300
Sure, yeah.

1449
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:37,140
That's the one.

1450
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:37,980
Catch and release.

1451
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:39,540
I'm sure they'll be bored out of their minds,

1452
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:40,980
but I've thought about it.

1453
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:43,740
Because I live outside LA, so it's like,

1454
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:46,740
there's some fish in your hands with Lake Arrowhead.

1455
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:47,580
They'll be bored.

1456
00:44:47,580 --> 00:44:49,020
But you want to do that dad thing.

1457
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:52,100
Be like, I want to live that beer commercial.

1458
00:44:53,660 --> 00:44:55,140
The outdoors stuff.

1459
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:55,980
They're gonna get their hands dirty.

1460
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:58,460
The Lohenbrau commercial.

1461
00:44:58,460 --> 00:44:59,300
All right, son.

1462
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:02,220
I think it could be cool.

1463
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:04,060
We'll probably do it once.

1464
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:05,460
Just get a photo out of it,

1465
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:08,220
and then everyone will lose the memory of them

1466
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:09,380
throwing temper tantrums.

1467
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:12,300
Speaking of different times,

1468
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:14,500
I saw a commercial on TV.

1469
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:15,700
Well, it was on YouTube,

1470
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:17,100
but I was watching 80s commercials,

1471
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:18,180
early 80s commercials.

1472
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:23,180
There was a national spot for a fishing rod.

1473
00:45:23,180 --> 00:45:24,220
Like the reel.

1474
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:25,060
Wow.

1475
00:45:25,060 --> 00:45:25,900
And it was,

1476
00:45:27,740 --> 00:45:30,260
oh God, there's a name of a fishing reel company.

1477
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:31,380
It's probably still around.

1478
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:34,460
But they had enough money to do a national spot.

1479
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:36,020
That could play everywhere.

1480
00:45:36,020 --> 00:45:37,180
The slogan for the company was,

1481
00:45:37,180 --> 00:45:38,740
the folks you fish with.

1482
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:39,620
Whoa.

1483
00:45:39,620 --> 00:45:40,700
The folks you fish with.

1484
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:42,060
That is very, yeah.

1485
00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:44,540
You might on super syndicated,

1486
00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:47,620
like the for grandma antenna TV.

1487
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:49,060
They dropped serious cash.

1488
00:45:49,060 --> 00:45:51,180
Might have been a big regional spot, but still.

1489
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:52,020
Sure.

1490
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:54,860
But yeah, on a more obscure cable network,

1491
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:56,380
you'll see commercials like that.

1492
00:45:56,380 --> 00:45:59,020
It's clearly a non-union commercial.

1493
00:45:59,020 --> 00:46:00,540
And it's like,

1494
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:02,580
there's mattress companies that sell,

1495
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:03,620
and it's like,

1496
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:05,260
you can just tell,

1497
00:46:05,260 --> 00:46:07,340
you can tell this may be a cheaper spot.

1498
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:08,220
And then you'll still see like,

1499
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:11,260
sometimes standard deaf commercials on certain stations.

1500
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:12,180
Yeah.

1501
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:13,740
Like, okay.

1502
00:46:13,740 --> 00:46:15,780
We filmed our ad in 2002.

1503
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:16,820
Our work is done.

1504
00:46:16,820 --> 00:46:19,020
Right, and it's probably honestly,

1505
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:20,460
just working fine.

1506
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:21,300
I have it on my phone.

1507
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:22,260
It's working fine for them.

1508
00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:23,700
I have it as a ringtone on my phone.

1509
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:24,540
Really?

1510
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:26,500
It's a ringtone that I have not selected.

1511
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:29,020
And it would say what if he selected it?

1512
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:29,860
Do you want me to turn it on?

1513
00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:30,700
Yeah, sure.

1514
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:31,540
Yeah, let's hear it.

1515
00:46:31,540 --> 00:46:32,380
I gotta make sure I get the right one,

1516
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:34,220
because they're all labeled CBS commercials.

1517
00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:35,060
Hold on.

1518
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:35,900
This podcast is, we're doing a whole.

1519
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:36,740
Zipco.

1520
00:46:36,740 --> 00:46:37,580
Oh.

1521
00:46:37,580 --> 00:46:39,740
Zipco Omega 33XPL.

1522
00:46:39,740 --> 00:46:42,580
Smooth, powerful, ball bearing drive.

1523
00:46:42,580 --> 00:46:44,020
Ultra sensitive drag.

1524
00:46:45,340 --> 00:46:49,180
And an interchangeable handle for right or left hand retrieve.

1525
00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:50,020
Da da da da da da.

1526
00:46:50,020 --> 00:46:53,100
Zipco Omega 33XPL.

1527
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:54,900
Just one of the Zipco Omegas.

1528
00:46:56,420 --> 00:46:58,620
Made in America by Zipco.

1529
00:47:00,460 --> 00:47:02,300
The folks you fish with.

1530
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:03,140
The folks you fuck with.

1531
00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:05,100
Wow, so much weird dead air in there.

1532
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:05,940
Whoa.

1533
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:06,940
Omega three.

1534
00:47:06,940 --> 00:47:07,780
Omega 33.

1535
00:47:07,780 --> 00:47:08,620
Wow.

1536
00:47:08,620 --> 00:47:09,780
Omega 33.

1537
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:13,100
For right hand or left hand retrieve.

1538
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:13,940
Wow.

1539
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:17,900
Enough people in Boston are gonna buy a fish and pull.

1540
00:47:19,620 --> 00:47:20,440
I think I've.

1541
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:21,280
It's weird.

1542
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:22,900
I think I fished twice in my life.

1543
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:23,740
Well.

1544
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:25,420
As a young child.

1545
00:47:25,420 --> 00:47:27,060
I did a little bit, and I'd go to a place

1546
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:30,060
that was probably just the Trout Farm version

1547
00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:32,460
of what your, of your dog patch experience.

1548
00:47:32,460 --> 00:47:34,580
It was called Troutdale.

1549
00:47:34,580 --> 00:47:38,060
It's still there in like Agoura Hills.

1550
00:47:38,060 --> 00:47:39,940
And it's similar to this, like a pond

1551
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:42,540
with so many trout, as many as possible.

1552
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:44,580
There's a trout pond up on Mount Baldy.

1553
00:47:44,580 --> 00:47:45,780
Near where we live.

1554
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:47,840
Yeah, like there's a, I fished a lot.

1555
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:49,000
I had my own rod and reel.

1556
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,900
I had a tackle box, that was called.

1557
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:53,180
Yeah, that's right.

1558
00:47:53,180 --> 00:47:54,000
Yeah, tackle box.

1559
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:54,840
Did I have my own tackle box?

1560
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:57,060
Two of the places that I used to fish though

1561
00:47:57,060 --> 00:48:00,540
have been kind of destroyed, where one is dog patch.

1562
00:48:00,540 --> 00:48:03,700
And then I went fishing with a buddy of mine.

1563
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:06,140
We went camping, and then that place subsequently,

1564
00:48:06,140 --> 00:48:08,580
like all of it burned down in a wildfire.

1565
00:48:08,580 --> 00:48:09,420
Wow.

1566
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:10,780
Just a little freaky.

1567
00:48:11,660 --> 00:48:12,500
All of it.

1568
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:14,660
Dog patch of wishes, it was burnt down.

1569
00:48:14,660 --> 00:48:15,500
Would have been on the lake.

1570
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:17,820
What are you driving by, and it's like, burn me.

1571
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:20,140
Find a match.

1572
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:21,660
I can't do this anymore.

1573
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:22,740
Get some gasoline.

1574
00:48:23,580 --> 00:48:24,420
Jason.

1575
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:25,260
Get some flowers.

1576
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:26,700
Jason is a child, I know this.

1577
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:27,620
I mentioned it before.

1578
00:48:27,620 --> 00:48:29,960
Has a story that sounds like something out of dog patch.

1579
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:30,800
When he would fish.

1580
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:31,640
Oh, sure, yeah.

1581
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:32,940
He would fish for.

1582
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:33,780
Pond deals.

1583
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:34,620
Pond deals.

1584
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:36,180
Pond deals.

1585
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:41,180
So in the little resort trailer park,

1586
00:48:41,260 --> 00:48:43,300
where my family's had a trailer for years,

1587
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:46,780
like a little in-ground trailer down at the Jersey Shore,

1588
00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:51,780
there's a small lake that is connected to a pond by marsh.

1589
00:48:51,820 --> 00:48:54,060
And we would go back to this pond

1590
00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:58,140
and fish with either chunks of cheese or cut up hot dogs.

1591
00:48:58,140 --> 00:48:59,460
Okay, yeah.

1592
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:00,980
He catches little guppies.

1593
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:01,820
Don't waste these, mom.

1594
00:49:01,820 --> 00:49:04,940
And then one year for whatever reason,

1595
00:49:04,940 --> 00:49:07,060
we just started catching eels.

1596
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:07,900
Whoa.

1597
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:08,720
With sharp cheddar.

1598
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:10,300
These eels love this cheese.

1599
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:12,220
And we're like, what is this?

1600
00:49:12,220 --> 00:49:13,540
And so I told.

1601
00:49:13,540 --> 00:49:14,980
How big were the eels?

1602
00:49:14,980 --> 00:49:18,300
Maybe like a little under a foot, I would say.

1603
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:20,420
That's not, that's sizable, man.

1604
00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:21,260
No, that's not.

1605
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:22,500
That's a sizable eel.

1606
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:24,620
Friendly looking creatures.

1607
00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:26,020
They look evil.

1608
00:49:26,020 --> 00:49:28,100
Did Earthquake Magoon give you this idea?

1609
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:29,620
Earthquake Magoon.

1610
00:49:30,540 --> 00:49:31,860
Scrambled brain.

1611
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:34,820
That's the kind of thing that my dad thinks

1612
00:49:34,820 --> 00:49:38,100
modern restaurants are like, eel and cheddar.

1613
00:49:39,860 --> 00:49:42,540
You got out there in California eating your eel.

1614
00:49:43,620 --> 00:49:44,980
Even though he's from here.

1615
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:45,820
That's what he thinks.

1616
00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:46,780
He's from in Seco?

1617
00:49:46,780 --> 00:49:49,300
Yeah, he's from, yeah, he's from Sherman Oaks.

1618
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:50,140
That's right, yeah.

1619
00:49:50,140 --> 00:49:51,980
Anything that's not meatloaf he's suspicious of.

1620
00:49:51,980 --> 00:49:52,820
What is that?

1621
00:49:52,820 --> 00:49:53,660
What are you eating over there?

1622
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:55,820
He recently bragged to me, I've been trying new things.

1623
00:49:55,820 --> 00:49:57,300
I tried flatbread.

1624
00:49:58,180 --> 00:49:59,020
Flatbread?

1625
00:49:59,020 --> 00:50:01,340
Yeah, he gave flatbread.

1626
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:02,180
That's pizza.

1627
00:50:02,180 --> 00:50:03,620
My dad will not, yeah, my dad is the same way.

1628
00:50:03,620 --> 00:50:06,100
My dad retired out here, but he won't eat anything.

1629
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:07,140
That makes a little more sense.

1630
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:09,460
Yeah, and he's from Chicago, but that's all meat.

1631
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:13,700
It's just, he grew up where the couch stopped

1632
00:50:13,700 --> 00:50:16,460
and he moved to where they started.

1633
00:50:16,460 --> 00:50:17,300
You know what I mean?

1634
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:18,500
Yeah, he's like, I got a great picture

1635
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:20,140
of my dad and I at Dogpatch.

1636
00:50:20,140 --> 00:50:20,980
I should have brought it.

1637
00:50:20,980 --> 00:50:21,820
Oh yeah.

1638
00:50:21,820 --> 00:50:22,660
We'll find out later.

1639
00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:25,540
He's in, it's the mid-80s, early 80s, right?

1640
00:50:25,540 --> 00:50:28,220
So I'm a little kid and he's holding my hand

1641
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:29,940
and we're both looking back at something

1642
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:31,340
and my mom just happened to be behind us

1643
00:50:31,340 --> 00:50:32,540
and snapped a picture.

1644
00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:34,940
We're walking through the food area,

1645
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:37,380
I guess where that stuff was, but he's turned around

1646
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:42,380
and he's got the great Serengeti sunglasses, mustache,

1647
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:47,540
sleeveless shirt, short shorts, and for some reason,

1648
00:50:47,540 --> 00:50:50,420
his ass is soaking wet in the photo.

1649
00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:52,220
We probably were just on the paddle boats.

1650
00:50:52,220 --> 00:50:53,220
Yeah, it's only good.

1651
00:50:53,220 --> 00:50:55,220
It's also the Arkansas heat,

1652
00:50:55,220 --> 00:50:58,700
but his soaking wet shorts.

1653
00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:00,980
Sounds like a nice idyllic photo

1654
00:51:00,980 --> 00:51:01,820
besides those details.

1655
00:51:01,820 --> 00:51:02,660
But it's a very good photo.

1656
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:04,300
He was holding my hand.

1657
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:06,780
He didn't get like, his butt wasn't on fire

1658
00:51:06,780 --> 00:51:08,620
and he jumped into a barrel of water.

1659
00:51:08,620 --> 00:51:09,460
Is that possible?

1660
00:51:09,460 --> 00:51:11,300
That wasn't experience, they offered.

1661
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:13,260
Another crazy day at Dogpatch.

1662
00:51:13,260 --> 00:51:15,100
Worse than my comic.

1663
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:17,380
This guy's ass caught on fire.

1664
00:51:17,380 --> 00:51:18,820
Your dad's chasing some woman.

1665
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:20,020
Vietnam was right.

1666
00:51:23,420 --> 00:51:24,260
Wow.

1667
00:51:24,260 --> 00:51:28,220
So, I mean, we should start moving to the park at last.

1668
00:51:28,220 --> 00:51:32,420
Yes, if you wanna know more about Lil Abner,

1669
00:51:32,420 --> 00:51:35,820
there is a comprehensive reprinting of them going on

1670
00:51:35,820 --> 00:51:39,380
by IDW, their line, the Library of American Comics.

1671
00:51:39,380 --> 00:51:41,500
There's nine volumes so far.

1672
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:43,220
IDW's put out nine volumes?

1673
00:51:43,220 --> 00:51:44,540
Nine volumes.

1674
00:51:44,540 --> 00:51:47,380
Lil Abner ran for 43 years.

1675
00:51:47,380 --> 00:51:48,940
Oh my God.

1676
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:50,580
When did it start?

1677
00:51:50,580 --> 00:51:51,660
34, I think.

1678
00:51:51,660 --> 00:51:52,500
34.

1679
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:55,060
Yeah, so it'll be a little while.

1680
00:51:55,060 --> 00:51:57,980
They banged out Nancy in three or four volumes.

1681
00:51:57,980 --> 00:52:01,860
They put out nine volumes, so they must be selling well.

1682
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:02,700
I guess so.

1683
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:05,980
Those big books sell well for the comic book imprints.

1684
00:52:05,980 --> 00:52:06,820
They're great.

1685
00:52:06,820 --> 00:52:08,060
Even Lil Abner, I guess.

1686
00:52:08,060 --> 00:52:10,500
If I bought one for my dad, he's like,

1687
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:13,180
oh good, the way things used to be.

1688
00:52:13,180 --> 00:52:15,900
Oh no, my dad likes Lil Abner.

1689
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:16,740
In Sherman Oaks?

1690
00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:18,860
Yeah, I can't imagine.

1691
00:52:18,860 --> 00:52:19,940
If I bought it for my dad,

1692
00:52:19,980 --> 00:52:23,420
I'd probably try to do the really thoughtful son gift

1693
00:52:23,420 --> 00:52:27,380
of the theme park we used to go to, like Dogpatch.

1694
00:52:27,380 --> 00:52:29,180
He'd be like, was that what it was called?

1695
00:52:29,180 --> 00:52:30,020
Was it Dogpatch?

1696
00:52:30,020 --> 00:52:32,620
Was that on the way up to Illinois?

1697
00:52:32,620 --> 00:52:34,380
No, that was in Arkansas.

1698
00:52:34,380 --> 00:52:35,220
Oh.

1699
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:36,780
Don't remember. Cool.

1700
00:52:36,780 --> 00:52:37,780
Thanks, buddy.

1701
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:40,860
Just get him some short shorts and get him wet before.

1702
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:42,740
And here's some wet shorts for you to put on.

1703
00:52:42,740 --> 00:52:43,580
You remember? Put them on.

1704
00:52:43,580 --> 00:52:44,740
Happy Father's Day.

1705
00:52:44,740 --> 00:52:46,340
Put them on, I need to do the photo.

1706
00:52:46,340 --> 00:52:47,700
Mom's?

1707
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:48,740
Hold my hand, damn it.

1708
00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:50,380
Hold my hand, take the photo.

1709
00:52:51,580 --> 00:52:53,340
His ass isn't wet enough.

1710
00:52:53,340 --> 00:52:54,340
Wet him down.

1711
00:52:55,540 --> 00:52:58,500
So, all of that insanity

1712
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:01,700
about this one-legged sexual harasser to say,

1713
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:05,260
that a group of people, there was a trout farm owner

1714
00:53:05,260 --> 00:53:07,940
who wanted to do something different with the property

1715
00:53:07,940 --> 00:53:09,980
and see if he could turn it into more of a tourist attraction,

1716
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:13,140
especially considering that there were several caves

1717
00:53:13,140 --> 00:53:14,940
worthy of exploring.

1718
00:53:14,940 --> 00:53:16,180
How can we get people off the highway?

1719
00:53:16,180 --> 00:53:17,220
This isn't near an interstate,

1720
00:53:17,260 --> 00:53:19,820
you gotta go out of your way to go there, what can we do?

1721
00:53:19,820 --> 00:53:21,020
What if we built a little village?

1722
00:53:21,020 --> 00:53:22,540
They talked about properties,

1723
00:53:22,540 --> 00:53:23,740
they might be able to turn it into,

1724
00:53:23,740 --> 00:53:26,260
and they talked about turning it into dog patch

1725
00:53:26,260 --> 00:53:27,180
from the Labner.

1726
00:53:27,180 --> 00:53:29,660
And they assure, after all that reading,

1727
00:53:29,660 --> 00:53:32,900
the quote that they assured Al Cap

1728
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:35,460
that the park would be quiet and dignified

1729
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:39,100
and would not include roller coasters or thrill rides

1730
00:53:39,100 --> 00:53:41,660
that would conflict with the rustic Labner thing.

1731
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:43,020
Yeah, we don't want those rides.

1732
00:53:43,020 --> 00:53:44,340
It's working everywhere else,

1733
00:53:44,340 --> 00:53:46,260
but ours is gonna be different.

1734
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:49,260
It's just not dignified, not Disneyland.

1735
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:50,860
So this guy was super buttoned up,

1736
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:52,300
but also an entrepreneur,

1737
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:55,620
like a true American, pull yourself up by your bootstraps.

1738
00:53:55,620 --> 00:53:58,100
I have a trout farm, I'm gonna dream bigger.

1739
00:53:58,100 --> 00:53:59,540
Yeah, I mean, it's pretty impressive

1740
00:53:59,540 --> 00:54:04,540
that he thought to, I mean, I have not great things to say

1741
00:54:04,540 --> 00:54:06,700
about many of the other owners of this property.

1742
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:07,820
But that guy probably did well.

1743
00:54:07,820 --> 00:54:08,660
Yeah, I think so.

1744
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:10,700
Albert Rainey is the name,

1745
00:54:10,700 --> 00:54:13,820
and his real estate agent, OJ Snow.

1746
00:54:13,820 --> 00:54:14,740
OJ Snow?

1747
00:54:14,740 --> 00:54:15,580
OJ Snow.

1748
00:54:15,580 --> 00:54:18,060
He's like a character in Little Abner.

1749
00:54:18,060 --> 00:54:18,900
From out of town.

1750
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:20,340
And a smart selection for,

1751
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:23,180
it was estimated that every day,

1752
00:54:23,180 --> 00:54:26,620
Little Abner reached 60 million Americans.

1753
00:54:26,620 --> 00:54:27,700
Wow.

1754
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:29,540
900 American newspapers.

1755
00:54:29,540 --> 00:54:30,380
It's the finale of MASH.

1756
00:54:30,380 --> 00:54:33,380
And 100 foreign papers.

1757
00:54:33,380 --> 00:54:35,580
Wow, 60 million people.

1758
00:54:35,580 --> 00:54:37,380
Or 60 million readers, excuse me.

1759
00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:41,820
So therefore, we could get to our goal easily

1760
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:44,340
of 10,000 people a day.

1761
00:54:44,340 --> 00:54:46,140
This is what they wanted.

1762
00:54:46,140 --> 00:54:48,940
As the years went on, it was a very rare,

1763
00:54:48,940 --> 00:54:50,900
they said in a very special day,

1764
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:53,180
they could maybe get 7,000.

1765
00:54:53,180 --> 00:54:55,020
Like it always fell way short of Western.

1766
00:54:55,020 --> 00:54:56,260
It was a weird place, man.

1767
00:54:56,260 --> 00:54:57,100
You remember that?

1768
00:54:57,100 --> 00:54:57,940
Like I didn't know that as a kid.

1769
00:54:57,940 --> 00:55:00,500
It was like, you're driving through Arkansas

1770
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:03,020
for a while back then, and it's very green.

1771
00:55:03,020 --> 00:55:04,260
I don't know if you guys have been to Arkansas.

1772
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:05,100
Never not.

1773
00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:06,740
Okay, it's very green,

1774
00:55:06,740 --> 00:55:10,180
because it's just a lot of moisture, I guess.

1775
00:55:11,060 --> 00:55:12,700
And so you're just driving,

1776
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:17,700
but there are a lot of tall, very green trees.

1777
00:55:18,540 --> 00:55:20,340
So it's almost like Virginia, you know what I mean?

1778
00:55:20,340 --> 00:55:22,140
But very leafy.

1779
00:55:22,140 --> 00:55:25,180
And you're just going down that highway forever.

1780
00:55:25,180 --> 00:55:26,780
And it's not off the main.

1781
00:55:26,780 --> 00:55:27,860
It's nondescript.

1782
00:55:27,860 --> 00:55:31,220
Like you enjoy a scenic drive for 15 minutes,

1783
00:55:31,220 --> 00:55:32,060
but it starts to get like, ugh.

1784
00:55:32,060 --> 00:55:33,900
I don't remember being scenic,

1785
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:35,580
because there's nothing to really look out on.

1786
00:55:35,580 --> 00:55:36,420
You know what I mean?

1787
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:39,580
And then just, I remember looking out the window,

1788
00:55:39,580 --> 00:55:41,900
and you're just looking at trees, trees, trees,

1789
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:44,300
and I'm looking at it for an hour, or whatever it is,

1790
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:48,060
waiting for the dog patch sign to pop out out of nowhere.

1791
00:55:48,060 --> 00:55:49,620
Like, oh, you know what I mean?

1792
00:55:49,620 --> 00:55:50,460
Like, there it is.

1793
00:55:50,460 --> 00:55:52,380
And there's not even a sign saying dog patch coming up.

1794
00:55:52,380 --> 00:55:53,220
Just like, oh, here we go.

1795
00:55:53,220 --> 00:55:54,980
There probably was, but I was like, I couldn't.

1796
00:55:54,980 --> 00:55:57,420
I just knew the guy.

1797
00:55:57,420 --> 00:55:58,660
I knew little Abner.

1798
00:55:58,660 --> 00:56:00,180
Oh, there was a big little Abner on the sign,

1799
00:56:00,180 --> 00:56:01,020
or inside, or so.

1800
00:56:01,020 --> 00:56:01,860
I'd be like, bleh.

1801
00:56:01,860 --> 00:56:02,700
Wow.

1802
00:56:02,700 --> 00:56:04,900
So it's like an oasis to you,

1803
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:06,500
in sort of a boring, long road trip.

1804
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:07,900
Because it's like seven hours away

1805
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:09,340
from Dallas or something.

1806
00:56:09,340 --> 00:56:11,460
It was a while, you know what I mean?

1807
00:56:11,460 --> 00:56:12,300
It wasn't great.

1808
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:15,260
I'm trying to, my grandfather retired in,

1809
00:56:15,260 --> 00:56:17,380
is it Bentonville?

1810
00:56:17,380 --> 00:56:18,460
Bensonville?

1811
00:56:18,460 --> 00:56:19,860
Bentonville or Bensonville.

1812
00:56:19,860 --> 00:56:21,380
It's where Sam Walton's from.

1813
00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:22,220
Okay.

1814
00:56:22,220 --> 00:56:23,040
Oh, from Walmart.

1815
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:23,880
Sure, that one.

1816
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:24,720
Sam Walton.

1817
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:25,540
So like, he lived there.

1818
00:56:25,540 --> 00:56:26,380
Not from the Waltons.

1819
00:56:26,380 --> 00:56:27,220
Not a character from the Waltons.

1820
00:56:27,220 --> 00:56:30,060
But the Walton family's from this town in Arkansas.

1821
00:56:30,060 --> 00:56:31,100
Their headquarters is there.

1822
00:56:31,100 --> 00:56:31,940
Oh, gotcha.

1823
00:56:31,940 --> 00:56:33,140
But it was a small town.

1824
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:36,100
Did you like visiting wherever,

1825
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:37,860
the main place where your grandparents were?

1826
00:56:37,860 --> 00:56:39,460
I liked my grandparents' house.

1827
00:56:39,460 --> 00:56:40,460
Because it was when they had a house.

1828
00:56:40,460 --> 00:56:42,580
They actually were not able to keep the house,

1829
00:56:42,580 --> 00:56:44,780
which was sad, and then they moved to Southern Illinois.

1830
00:56:44,780 --> 00:56:47,260
But yeah, my grandfather had a garden,

1831
00:56:47,260 --> 00:56:49,700
and there were all these stories of Sam Walton.

1832
00:56:49,700 --> 00:56:52,620
And how he would go to church,

1833
00:56:52,620 --> 00:56:54,620
and he would sit in the front pew,

1834
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:58,620
and then he would fall asleep and snore very loudly.

1835
00:56:58,620 --> 00:57:00,160
But no one wanted to wake him up,

1836
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:03,420
because he gave so much money to the community

1837
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:04,900
and to the church.

1838
00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:07,380
So he would just snore through the homily,

1839
00:57:07,380 --> 00:57:08,920
or the serp, you know.

1840
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:10,380
That's just old Sam.

1841
00:57:11,300 --> 00:57:12,140
Old Sam over there.

1842
00:57:12,140 --> 00:57:12,980
Yeah.

1843
00:57:14,660 --> 00:57:18,180
You know, I mean, maybe they had a lot of affection for him,

1844
00:57:18,180 --> 00:57:19,620
or they just scared of him.

1845
00:57:19,620 --> 00:57:21,420
I think both, probably both.

1846
00:57:21,420 --> 00:57:22,260
It's like Walmart.

1847
00:57:22,260 --> 00:57:23,620
Don't take the money away.

1848
00:57:23,620 --> 00:57:26,020
Write down the name of the man who told me not to snore.

1849
00:57:26,020 --> 00:57:27,700
He will kill this town.

1850
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:29,220
Gonna burn this church down.

1851
00:57:29,220 --> 00:57:30,060
Build a Walmart.

1852
00:57:30,060 --> 00:57:31,300
I don't care about Arkansas.

1853
00:57:31,300 --> 00:57:32,580
Yeah.

1854
00:57:32,580 --> 00:57:33,860
Real bonds to me.

1855
00:57:33,860 --> 00:57:35,580
Did you have affection for

1856
00:57:35,580 --> 00:57:37,620
the little Abner character at all?

1857
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:39,740
I think I remember vaguely that sign.

1858
00:57:40,420 --> 00:57:42,780
I think when I visually,

1859
00:57:42,780 --> 00:57:44,340
on a cerebral cortex level,

1860
00:57:44,340 --> 00:57:46,100
when I look at the cast of characters,

1861
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:50,020
the sheer number, that one hits a button.

1862
00:57:50,020 --> 00:57:52,060
In my cerebral cortex, it's like boom.

1863
00:57:52,060 --> 00:57:54,940
And I'm like, oh, it's an exciting,

1864
00:57:54,940 --> 00:57:55,860
I like that character.

1865
00:57:55,860 --> 00:57:57,140
I like the way it looks.

1866
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:57,980
You go fun.

1867
00:57:57,980 --> 00:57:58,820
You maybe don't know anything else about him.

1868
00:57:58,820 --> 00:58:01,100
I'm like, fine, we're gonna have fun now.

1869
00:58:01,100 --> 00:58:02,060
We're not in the car.

1870
00:58:02,060 --> 00:58:02,900
Yeah, that gets my way.

1871
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:03,740
We might be getting out of a car.

1872
00:58:03,740 --> 00:58:05,140
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

1873
00:58:05,140 --> 00:58:07,680
I'm gonna get probably a toy or a prize,

1874
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:09,620
or both, or a trout.

1875
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:11,340
Trout's coming.

1876
00:58:11,340 --> 00:58:12,540
To eat some delicious trout.

1877
00:58:12,540 --> 00:58:13,380
Trout again.

1878
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:14,220
Trout good to eat.

1879
00:58:14,220 --> 00:58:15,260
I'm gonna kill my own food.

1880
00:58:15,260 --> 00:58:17,420
I don't know, I haven't had trout in a long time.

1881
00:58:17,420 --> 00:58:19,260
Trout isn't a thing you have, a fish you have.

1882
00:58:19,260 --> 00:58:20,940
It's like usually on the specials,

1883
00:58:20,940 --> 00:58:21,780
we have a trout.

1884
00:58:21,780 --> 00:58:23,260
Like a diner or a school board.

1885
00:58:23,260 --> 00:58:24,100
Yeah, I get it.

1886
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:25,340
Oh, a diner trout.

1887
00:58:26,540 --> 00:58:29,820
Scott, I kinda wanna go to this trout land place.

1888
00:58:29,820 --> 00:58:31,140
Can we do an episode about trout dail?

1889
00:58:31,140 --> 00:58:31,980
Can we get trout dail?

1890
00:58:31,980 --> 00:58:34,060
Yeah, my old fishing hole.

1891
00:58:34,060 --> 00:58:36,100
The one where- Will they scale it for you?

1892
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:37,940
I think so.

1893
00:58:37,940 --> 00:58:38,780
Oh, at trout dail?

1894
00:58:38,780 --> 00:58:39,620
I have no idea.

1895
00:58:39,620 --> 00:58:41,180
Dogpatch, you would give the fish to them

1896
00:58:41,180 --> 00:58:44,260
and they would take it into the cabin and do the deed.

1897
00:58:44,260 --> 00:58:47,300
That was like the big, one of their big trademark things.

1898
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:49,540
I read that they would also put it on ice for you

1899
00:58:49,540 --> 00:58:50,380
if you wanna take it home.

1900
00:58:50,380 --> 00:58:51,220
Oh, yeah.

1901
00:58:51,220 --> 00:58:52,040
Okay, that makes sense.

1902
00:58:52,040 --> 00:58:52,880
They'll do whatever.

1903
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:53,780
Bring grandpa a trout.

1904
00:58:55,260 --> 00:58:56,860
Look!

1905
00:58:56,860 --> 00:58:59,580
I did this, I killed him.

1906
00:58:59,580 --> 00:59:00,420
I killed him, grandpa.

1907
00:59:00,420 --> 00:59:01,740
I killed this for you, grandpa.

1908
00:59:01,740 --> 00:59:03,340
Give this to Sam Walden.

1909
00:59:03,340 --> 00:59:05,980
Leaving a dead fish on Sam Walden's doorstep.

1910
00:59:05,980 --> 00:59:06,820
Fuck you.

1911
00:59:06,820 --> 00:59:08,780
Or as an offering.

1912
00:59:08,780 --> 00:59:10,020
Made in America my ass.

1913
00:59:10,020 --> 00:59:11,260
Please give me a job.

1914
00:59:11,260 --> 00:59:12,420
I brought you a job.

1915
00:59:14,780 --> 00:59:17,940
Now, do you have any fondness for the character

1916
00:59:17,940 --> 00:59:21,260
who is the centerpiece of the town of Dogpatch?

1917
00:59:21,260 --> 00:59:24,180
There's an oversized statue of the hero

1918
00:59:24,180 --> 00:59:26,340
who all of the townsfolk worship.

1919
00:59:26,340 --> 00:59:29,260
He is a Confederate general.

1920
00:59:29,260 --> 00:59:30,100
God damn it.

1921
00:59:30,100 --> 00:59:33,380
And his name is Jubilation T. Cornpwn.

1922
00:59:34,180 --> 00:59:35,380
I gotta look at a picture of him.

1923
00:59:35,380 --> 00:59:36,220
Please look up Jubilation T. Cornpwn.

1924
00:59:37,180 --> 00:59:38,140
I'll probably remember,

1925
00:59:38,140 --> 00:59:40,100
but I have no recollection of this.

1926
00:59:40,100 --> 00:59:42,340
I think it was sort of the centerpiece.

1927
00:59:42,340 --> 00:59:43,160
It's like a-

1928
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:44,000
Julius T. Cornpwn?

1929
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,060
Yeah, Cornpwn.

1930
00:59:45,060 --> 00:59:46,860
Jubilation T. Cornpwn?

1931
00:59:46,860 --> 00:59:47,700
Jubilation, sorry.

1932
00:59:47,700 --> 00:59:48,540
Can I?

1933
00:59:48,540 --> 00:59:49,380
It'd be Jubilation.

1934
00:59:49,380 --> 00:59:50,820
Real quick, while you're looking it up,

1935
00:59:50,820 --> 00:59:51,820
I forgot to play this.

1936
00:59:51,820 --> 00:59:53,240
This is a list of all the characters

1937
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:54,740
that are listed in the trailer.

1938
00:59:54,740 --> 00:59:55,560
Did you watch this?

1939
00:59:55,560 --> 00:59:56,400
No, please.

1940
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:57,240
A little after the original trailer.

1941
00:59:57,240 --> 00:59:59,100
This will help us get acquainted with who we're gonna meet.

1942
00:59:59,100 --> 00:59:59,940
That's, yeah, exactly.

1943
00:59:59,940 --> 01:00:00,780
Okay, thank you.

1944
01:00:00,780 --> 01:00:01,600
So, here we go.

1945
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:02,440
Glossary.

1946
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:04,180
Earthquake Magoo.

1947
01:00:04,180 --> 01:00:05,820
Boom beam makes wine.

1948
01:00:06,580 --> 01:00:07,420
Boobie.

1949
01:00:13,700 --> 01:00:14,540
Julie Newmar?

1950
01:00:14,540 --> 01:00:15,360
What?

1951
01:00:24,700 --> 01:00:25,540
Yeah, buddy.

1952
01:00:33,540 --> 01:00:34,380
Oh no.

1953
01:00:35,820 --> 01:00:37,540
The visualis flee from Daisy Mae

1954
01:00:37,540 --> 01:00:40,100
and those beautiful love star babes.

1955
01:00:40,100 --> 01:00:41,940
This is a real glimpse.

1956
01:00:41,940 --> 01:00:45,100
All the carrying on in Paramount's biggest musical hit.

1957
01:00:50,220 --> 01:00:51,380
Say it.

1958
01:00:51,380 --> 01:00:52,220
Come on.

1959
01:00:53,220 --> 01:00:54,820
No, it's just on the screen.

1960
01:00:56,980 --> 01:00:58,380
The announcer doesn't say the title.

1961
01:00:58,380 --> 01:00:59,220
Doesn't say the title.

1962
01:00:59,220 --> 01:01:00,420
He said everything else.

1963
01:01:00,420 --> 01:01:01,940
He said so many words.

1964
01:01:01,940 --> 01:01:05,060
That's right, it was a Paramount musical.

1965
01:01:05,060 --> 01:01:06,660
It's not a phrase you hear often.

1966
01:01:06,660 --> 01:01:07,980
The Paramount musical.

1967
01:01:07,980 --> 01:01:08,820
It's not known for those.

1968
01:01:08,820 --> 01:01:09,660
The famous Paramount musical.

1969
01:01:09,660 --> 01:01:11,020
Available Jones.

1970
01:01:11,020 --> 01:01:11,860
Available Jones.

1971
01:01:11,860 --> 01:01:12,700
That's really strange.

1972
01:01:12,700 --> 01:01:14,020
I like these names.

1973
01:01:14,020 --> 01:01:14,860
Available Jones.

1974
01:01:16,340 --> 01:01:17,580
Really quick, I don't wanna sidetrack,

1975
01:01:17,580 --> 01:01:22,060
but when I flew back from my first visit to Orlando

1976
01:01:22,060 --> 01:01:24,740
into Disney World and I wept and wept harder

1977
01:01:24,740 --> 01:01:27,740
than I've ever cried about anything else in my life,

1978
01:01:27,740 --> 01:01:29,300
I was so sad to leave Disney World.

1979
01:01:29,300 --> 01:01:30,780
And the only thing that cheered me up

1980
01:01:30,780 --> 01:01:32,260
and got me to stop crying for a second

1981
01:01:32,260 --> 01:01:33,660
was that my parents pointed out

1982
01:01:33,660 --> 01:01:35,860
that Julie Newmar was getting on the plane.

1983
01:01:35,860 --> 01:01:36,700
Oh wow, really?

1984
01:01:36,700 --> 01:01:37,540
What?

1985
01:01:37,540 --> 01:01:39,460
Specific memory, yeah, that's Catwoman.

1986
01:01:39,460 --> 01:01:41,060
Catwoman's on the flight.

1987
01:01:41,060 --> 01:01:44,780
Now please stop crying for five fucking seconds.

1988
01:01:44,780 --> 01:01:46,060
And that did work.

1989
01:01:46,060 --> 01:01:49,940
It did work, but I never stopped thinking about that trip

1990
01:01:49,940 --> 01:01:52,100
for the rest of my life and here I am now.

1991
01:01:52,100 --> 01:01:54,500
So really, really the tears never stop.

1992
01:01:54,500 --> 01:01:56,020
Julie Newmar was powerless.

1993
01:01:57,740 --> 01:01:58,940
In the face of Disney World, no.

1994
01:01:58,940 --> 01:02:00,820
I don't really remember the statue,

1995
01:02:00,820 --> 01:02:02,400
but I do remember some, some,

1996
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:04,160
I remember the beard.

1997
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:05,000
Okay, sure.

1998
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,400
Because I pictured something with like a coon skin cap.

1999
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:09,280
But I remember the beard.

2000
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:12,520
He's more of a, yeah, he's in the hat and the,

2001
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:14,680
he is, this is a Confederate statue

2002
01:02:14,680 --> 01:02:15,520
is what we're talking about.

2003
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:16,360
Yes.

2004
01:02:16,360 --> 01:02:17,180
This is still there.

2005
01:02:17,180 --> 01:02:18,600
However, I think it was actually moved

2006
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:19,920
to Branson or something.

2007
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:21,440
Oh, like Silver Dollar City?

2008
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:22,560
Which I've also been to.

2009
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:25,640
Oh really, we've never gotten into Silver Dollar City,

2010
01:02:25,640 --> 01:02:27,560
which seems like a better version of this.

2011
01:02:27,560 --> 01:02:28,840
Right, but with less rides.

2012
01:02:28,840 --> 01:02:30,160
Oh really, huh, huh.

2013
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:31,320
I didn't like it as much.

2014
01:02:31,360 --> 01:02:32,680
Oh, huh, interesting.

2015
01:02:32,680 --> 01:02:34,760
Well, America felt otherwise.

2016
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:38,200
I was a dog patch guy.

2017
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:41,080
And also an hour away, yeah, Branson, Missouri,

2018
01:02:41,080 --> 01:02:42,920
the rising fortune.

2019
01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:44,360
Branson's very popular.

2020
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:47,760
Which, which, what I didn't know is that Branson

2021
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:50,360
wasn't really like hidden stride until the 90s.

2022
01:02:50,360 --> 01:02:52,740
And that contributed to the, you know,

2023
01:02:52,740 --> 01:02:55,880
the final nail in the coffin of Dogpatch USA.

2024
01:02:55,880 --> 01:02:59,240
Yeah, it was like a better attraction down the road.

2025
01:02:59,240 --> 01:03:01,160
Jubilation T cornpwn, though this is

2026
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:02,840
a Confederate statue, it is sort of,

2027
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:05,280
it was kind of satire.

2028
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:08,040
It was like all the townsfolk sung about this guy

2029
01:03:08,040 --> 01:03:09,440
who was clearly a drunk and an idiot

2030
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:11,340
and lost all of these battles.

2031
01:03:11,340 --> 01:03:14,700
And I watched a song, the song from the movie

2032
01:03:14,700 --> 01:03:18,160
about Jubilation T cornpwn, and it's sung by Stubby K,

2033
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:19,920
old character actor Stubby K.

2034
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:22,060
And why did I get into any of this?

2035
01:03:22,060 --> 01:03:26,680
Well, so somebody, there was an article,

2036
01:03:26,680 --> 01:03:30,960
the deepest, like weird, worst right wing thing ever

2037
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:35,640
that tried to do a gotcha of Bill Maher

2038
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:39,320
via Jubilation T cornpwn because there's a,

2039
01:03:39,320 --> 01:03:43,320
not even a, like over time, the extra of real time,

2040
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:45,520
people are, several guests are talking about

2041
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:47,140
like weird actors they're related to.

2042
01:03:47,140 --> 01:03:48,880
And he says, Bill Maher says,

2043
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:50,960
Stubby K is my second cousin.

2044
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:51,920
Oh, interesting.

2045
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:54,700
And then this article says, well, did you hear that?

2046
01:03:54,700 --> 01:03:57,240
Well, you know, he goes off about the Confederate statues

2047
01:03:57,240 --> 01:03:58,360
and how he thinks they should be pulled down,

2048
01:03:58,360 --> 01:04:00,600
but his cousin did a whole song about him.

2049
01:04:01,600 --> 01:04:04,080
Okay, yeah, a lot of context there.

2050
01:04:04,080 --> 01:04:05,680
Yeah, there's a ton to learn.

2051
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:06,640
A lot of context.

2052
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:09,280
Do you imagine being that petty and sad?

2053
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:10,520
Desperate to bring down.

2054
01:04:10,520 --> 01:04:12,320
Where you're just like,

2055
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:16,120
I'm gonna go for this obscure little Abner character,

2056
01:04:16,120 --> 01:04:17,320
not even little Abner.

2057
01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:19,400
I'm gonna go for Jubilation T cornpwn.

2058
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:22,800
The never seen long dead Civil War.

2059
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:23,960
Who is a racist.

2060
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:26,840
If you watch the video, it is a whole song

2061
01:04:26,840 --> 01:04:29,200
about how Confederate generals were idiots.

2062
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:32,040
So it's a gotcha of himself, but.

2063
01:04:32,040 --> 01:04:36,520
And also to take all the time to go after Bill Maher,

2064
01:04:36,520 --> 01:04:39,400
who is unassailable and perfect in every way.

2065
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:40,720
You talking about a guy that's bulletproof.

2066
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:41,560
Yeah, yeah.

2067
01:04:41,560 --> 01:04:43,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2068
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:45,640
Shouldn't have tried.

2069
01:04:45,640 --> 01:04:48,440
So, but I like that name, all of these names.

2070
01:04:48,440 --> 01:04:49,280
What was the name?

2071
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:50,120
Available Jones?

2072
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:51,160
Available Jones, yeah.

2073
01:04:51,160 --> 01:04:52,000
So good.

2074
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:53,360
I thought it was Available Jones.

2075
01:04:53,360 --> 01:04:54,920
It seems like it went in stride

2076
01:04:54,920 --> 01:04:56,880
with the rest of the trailer though.

2077
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:59,160
Cause it was just like, women chase the men.

2078
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:00,000
Yes.

2079
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
In this colorful male fantasy.

2080
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:02,960
The women are boy crazy

2081
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:05,040
and the men are running for their lives

2082
01:05:05,040 --> 01:05:06,160
in this dance sequence.

2083
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:09,240
Two men and women are begging for some friendship.

2084
01:05:09,240 --> 01:05:12,200
But we're not gonna give it to them.

2085
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:14,640
We're just gonna make fun of them.

2086
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:18,760
Julie Newmar was his like, stupefying Jones.

2087
01:05:18,760 --> 01:05:20,240
Stupefying Jones.

2088
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:21,080
She comes out of a.

2089
01:05:21,080 --> 01:05:22,120
She's out of like a rocket looking thing.

2090
01:05:22,120 --> 01:05:23,280
Yeah, she comes out of a rocket

2091
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:24,880
and she's wearing a bathing suit.

2092
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:25,720
Oh my God.

2093
01:05:25,720 --> 01:05:26,560
Wow.

2094
01:05:26,560 --> 01:05:28,000
I think we're gonna watch this movie.

2095
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:28,840
Yes.

2096
01:05:28,840 --> 01:05:29,680
Honestly, I was like,

2097
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:32,240
I should probably watch this whole fling.

2098
01:05:32,240 --> 01:05:34,240
The Jubilation T corn punch song is good.

2099
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:35,800
It is funny, there are jokes.

2100
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:36,640
It's a lot of fun.

2101
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:38,360
I've heard that and I don't know why

2102
01:05:38,360 --> 01:05:40,040
I've heard that before.

2103
01:05:40,040 --> 01:05:41,640
And I'm trying to remember what context it is

2104
01:05:41,640 --> 01:05:42,880
that I've heard it in.

2105
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:43,720
I don't know.

2106
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:44,540
I don't know.

2107
01:05:44,540 --> 01:05:46,200
It's like sampled in a girl talk song or something.

2108
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:47,040
Maybe.

2109
01:05:47,040 --> 01:05:51,080
That's stubby K right there.

2110
01:05:52,040 --> 01:05:54,600
It's a mix of like MGMT and stubby K.

2111
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:58,720
So let me say something about,

2112
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:03,200
something I learned from the documentary about Dogpatch.

2113
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:07,920
Dogpatch upon opening was 1,700 acres.

2114
01:06:08,920 --> 01:06:10,760
We were just talking about acreage

2115
01:06:10,760 --> 01:06:14,040
because Universal Studios is opening a new,

2116
01:06:14,040 --> 01:06:17,520
the third gate in Florida.

2117
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:21,200
And it's gonna be massive clearly.

2118
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:23,720
And it is 750 acres.

2119
01:06:23,720 --> 01:06:24,640
That's pretty big.

2120
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:28,320
Animal Kingdom, the biggest park in Disney World, 580 acres.

2121
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:32,480
So Dogpatch USA was three Animal Kingdoms in one.

2122
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:33,320
That's insane.

2123
01:06:33,320 --> 01:06:34,520
It's really insane.

2124
01:06:34,520 --> 01:06:36,360
And Animal Kingdom had a room for like a,

2125
01:06:36,360 --> 01:06:37,400
it's a full zoo.

2126
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:39,480
There's a place for, yeah.

2127
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:42,240
But then you get a savanna for elephants to run around.

2128
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:46,240
Why does Dogpatch have, it's really insane.

2129
01:06:46,280 --> 01:06:47,720
It's just wild land.

2130
01:06:47,720 --> 01:06:49,280
You know, you could probably just go off it.

2131
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:50,120
Most of it's not.

2132
01:06:50,120 --> 01:06:51,600
You're just in Ozarks.

2133
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:54,560
You could just live there probably for 30 days.

2134
01:06:54,560 --> 01:06:55,560
What?

2135
01:06:55,560 --> 01:06:57,760
If your dad was a guy out in the trees.

2136
01:06:58,760 --> 01:07:00,960
Well, you would get him.

2137
01:07:01,880 --> 01:07:02,720
Bring him here.

2138
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:03,920
You could get an annual pass

2139
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:06,880
if you just camped in the yard, camped in the wilderness.

2140
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:08,320
Again, probably around February.

2141
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:09,160
Yeah.

2142
01:07:09,160 --> 01:07:10,720
I mean there was a lot of,

2143
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:13,400
some of the cabins they deconstructed somewhere else

2144
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:14,240
and rebuilt.

2145
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:15,080
That's crazy.

2146
01:07:15,080 --> 01:07:16,480
Maybe the characters' cabins.

2147
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:19,120
Real 19th century cabins.

2148
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:20,160
Wow, geez.

2149
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:22,320
And reassembled them.

2150
01:07:22,320 --> 01:07:26,080
God, this is a genuinely historic site.

2151
01:07:27,360 --> 01:07:29,240
So what could you do there?

2152
01:07:29,240 --> 01:07:30,440
Here, when I throw it to you,

2153
01:07:30,440 --> 01:07:31,720
like what do you remember doing?

2154
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:33,640
You remember getting a toy.

2155
01:07:33,640 --> 01:07:36,240
Yeah, there were, were there games?

2156
01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:38,120
Because I feel like, probably.

2157
01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:41,560
But the strongest memory I have is that I really wanted,

2158
01:07:41,560 --> 01:07:45,680
there were two kind of dog toys, like plush dogs,

2159
01:07:45,680 --> 01:07:48,720
and one was like pink and red,

2160
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:50,520
and one was two shades of blue.

2161
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:55,520
And I could not decide between them when I won this game.

2162
01:07:55,520 --> 01:07:57,080
And I was like freaking out.

2163
01:07:57,080 --> 01:07:59,720
Like I could not decide between which dog I wanted

2164
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,080
because they were both so great.

2165
01:08:03,080 --> 01:08:08,080
And I think my mom or dad like played the game again

2166
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:10,200
and like spent more money and won again.

2167
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:11,960
So then I got to have both.

2168
01:08:11,960 --> 01:08:12,800
Oh, geez.

2169
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:13,640
Wow, that's cool.

2170
01:08:13,640 --> 01:08:14,480
You have nice memories here.

2171
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:15,320
Yeah, it's very nice.

2172
01:08:15,320 --> 01:08:17,600
And there's a picture of my mom with both dogs.

2173
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:18,440
Oh my God.

2174
01:08:18,440 --> 01:08:20,800
We're coming out of a little like food cabin or whatever.

2175
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:22,200
Wow, wow.

2176
01:08:22,200 --> 01:08:23,760
And I was like,

2177
01:08:23,760 --> 01:08:26,120
but it taught me that I could have everything I ever wanted.

2178
01:08:26,120 --> 01:08:26,960
Yeah.

2179
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:29,480
You entitled hippie.

2180
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:30,320
Yeah, exactly.

2181
01:08:30,320 --> 01:08:31,480
I'll capture to smack you around.

2182
01:08:31,480 --> 01:08:32,640
Yeah.

2183
01:08:32,640 --> 01:08:34,280
I feel like that is a running theme

2184
01:08:34,280 --> 01:08:36,040
in Halt and Catch Fire from what I've watched.

2185
01:08:36,040 --> 01:08:36,880
You can get everything you want.

2186
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:38,080
You can have it all.

2187
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:39,200
You can have it all.

2188
01:08:40,040 --> 01:08:41,280
It's up to you when you stop.

2189
01:08:41,280 --> 01:08:43,560
The dogpatch is the biggest influence on the series.

2190
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:44,400
I think it's good for the series.

2191
01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:45,240
Big influence.

2192
01:08:45,240 --> 01:08:46,880
Little Latin early pace.

2193
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:48,680
I mean, that would be a pretty good casting.

2194
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:49,920
He could be a live action.

2195
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:50,760
Ooh, wow.

2196
01:08:50,760 --> 01:08:53,600
Beef him up, put a little crossfit on him.

2197
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:54,440
Give him the two by four.

2198
01:08:54,440 --> 01:08:56,400
You gotta get those upper arms really just busting out.

2199
01:08:56,400 --> 01:08:57,240
Yeah, exactly.

2200
01:08:57,240 --> 01:08:58,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2201
01:08:58,160 --> 01:09:01,440
Have we determined who owns the characters now?

2202
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:02,280
Hmm.

2203
01:09:02,280 --> 01:09:03,120
Do we know?

2204
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:05,160
It has to be like some company in Mexico.

2205
01:09:05,160 --> 01:09:06,000
You know what I mean?

2206
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:06,840
Yes.

2207
01:09:06,840 --> 01:09:08,120
As a write down, as like a tax,

2208
01:09:08,160 --> 01:09:09,640
like a superfund site.

2209
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:10,480
You know what I mean?

2210
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:11,320
Yeah.

2211
01:09:11,320 --> 01:09:12,160
Like where it's toxic land

2212
01:09:12,160 --> 01:09:14,640
and they just a massive media company buys it

2213
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:15,480
and writes it off.

2214
01:09:15,480 --> 01:09:16,320
Mm-hmm, yeah.

2215
01:09:16,320 --> 01:09:17,280
They're never gonna clean it up.

2216
01:09:17,280 --> 01:09:18,640
It's very, yeah.

2217
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:21,240
Because the characters are not public domain yet.

2218
01:09:21,240 --> 01:09:22,080
No.

2219
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:23,560
When it hits that 100 year mark,

2220
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:25,280
this will be one of the first to go

2221
01:09:25,280 --> 01:09:26,920
because nobody's being careful about it.

2222
01:09:26,920 --> 01:09:28,000
We just had to switch, right?

2223
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,200
It was, what was the year?

2224
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:32,560
Because we just, the Sunny Bono law just lapsed

2225
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:33,880
where it's over now.

2226
01:09:33,880 --> 01:09:38,000
So things are now entering public domain from 1924 on.

2227
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:39,720
What's the Sunny Bono law?

2228
01:09:39,720 --> 01:09:41,840
He extended that, he passed legislation

2229
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:44,800
to extend the copyright at the behest of Disney

2230
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:45,640
because of Mickey Mouse.

2231
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:46,480
Yeah, right, right.

2232
01:09:46,480 --> 01:09:47,320
He fought for Disney to hold back on.

2233
01:09:47,320 --> 01:09:49,680
That's his big piece of legislation.

2234
01:09:49,680 --> 01:09:51,200
And then he was mayor of Palm Springs.

2235
01:09:51,200 --> 01:09:52,040
Yeah.

2236
01:09:52,040 --> 01:09:52,880
Wow, wow.

2237
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:53,840
And then it was like,

2238
01:09:53,840 --> 01:09:55,760
because it extended it only like what,

2239
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:57,520
I don't know, 10 years, 15 years, 20,

2240
01:09:57,520 --> 01:09:59,000
because it was 100 years I think.

2241
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:02,280
It gave like a good chunk of time to,

2242
01:10:02,280 --> 01:10:03,600
but like it's like,

2243
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:06,720
there was a moratorium on stuff like after 24 or something.

2244
01:10:06,720 --> 01:10:09,960
And now every year there will be stuff

2245
01:10:09,960 --> 01:10:10,880
entering the public domain,

2246
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:13,200
which is the first time that's happened in a while, I think.

2247
01:10:13,200 --> 01:10:14,800
I could be completely wrong about this.

2248
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:16,080
I wonder what Disney's plan is.

2249
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:17,560
They have to be figuring something out.

2250
01:10:17,560 --> 01:10:19,240
I'm sure there's, yeah.

2251
01:10:19,240 --> 01:10:22,040
I think under the original, before all the extensions,

2252
01:10:22,040 --> 01:10:24,720
we had just passed either Spider-Man or Mickey Mouse,

2253
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:26,160
like some big one.

2254
01:10:26,160 --> 01:10:28,000
It was Steamboat Willie or something.

2255
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,800
It was like, yeah, it was like they were screwed.

2256
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:31,880
Spider-Man's much later.

2257
01:10:31,880 --> 01:10:32,720
62.

2258
01:10:32,720 --> 01:10:34,680
Oh, 100, yeah, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2259
01:10:34,720 --> 01:10:37,280
Like Superman and Batman will get there much quicker.

2260
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:38,720
Oh man.

2261
01:10:38,720 --> 01:10:41,920
Boy, then you'll just have constant Batmans and Spider-Mans.

2262
01:10:41,920 --> 01:10:43,040
That'll never happen.

2263
01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:44,720
Can you imagine a world like that?

2264
01:10:44,720 --> 01:10:47,160
Where there's like a new one every week.

2265
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:48,640
Multiple competing jokers.

2266
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:51,080
Whoa.

2267
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:52,160
Trippy.

2268
01:10:52,160 --> 01:10:53,800
My movie opens opposite the Joker,

2269
01:10:53,800 --> 01:10:55,080
so no one's gonna see it.

2270
01:10:55,080 --> 01:10:56,320
It's the same week, really?

2271
01:10:56,320 --> 01:10:57,760
Yeah, so they were like October 4th,

2272
01:10:57,760 --> 01:10:58,800
is there anything coming out?

2273
01:10:58,800 --> 01:10:59,880
Oh yes, that Joker film.

2274
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:01,400
Who's that, Joker?

2275
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:02,400
What's that about?

2276
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:04,960
It's my birthday, I'll go see it.

2277
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:05,800
Okay, good.

2278
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:06,640
I'll go see it.

2279
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:07,480
Just do a double feature.

2280
01:11:07,480 --> 01:11:08,320
The movie comes under a bit of a double header.

2281
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:10,680
October 4th is both the release of the Joker

2282
01:11:10,680 --> 01:11:13,600
and the first WWE on Fox.

2283
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:15,560
And I'm like, this is a weird birthday.

2284
01:11:15,560 --> 01:11:16,400
Oh no.

2285
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:17,240
Yeah.

2286
01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:18,080
Smack me, me and my folks.

2287
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:18,920
I'll be live on Fox.

2288
01:11:18,920 --> 01:11:19,760
Yeah, from LA.

2289
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:20,600
I'll drag you, Scott.

2290
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:21,920
Yeah, I'll be there, yeah.

2291
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:22,760
I'll see you in Matinee

2292
01:11:22,760 --> 01:11:24,120
and then I'll go to the Staples Center.

2293
01:11:24,120 --> 01:11:26,360
I'm sure there'll be like one theater in Stockton.

2294
01:11:26,360 --> 01:11:28,000
You know what I mean, like the Indy.

2295
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:29,400
Do you know yet, have they told you?

2296
01:11:29,400 --> 01:11:30,920
No, they're still putting together the theatrical,

2297
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:33,480
but I got the whole VOD thing, which was pretty crazy.

2298
01:11:33,480 --> 01:11:34,320
Oh, interesting.

2299
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:35,160
Huh, very good.

2300
01:11:35,160 --> 01:11:37,760
And you use the cabins from Dogpatch USA

2301
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:39,400
and that's where it's all set.

2302
01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:40,440
It's set in Dogpatch.

2303
01:11:40,440 --> 01:11:41,360
If you're so great at it.

2304
01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:43,040
It's set in the holler.

2305
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:45,120
There's a wounded criminal played by Aaron Paul.

2306
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:46,520
He crawls into the holler.

2307
01:11:47,480 --> 01:11:48,320
And it's a deaf boy.

2308
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:49,160
Catches a trout.

2309
01:11:49,160 --> 01:11:50,960
His father is available Jones.

2310
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:51,920
Yes, exactly.

2311
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:55,400
And it gets real dark from there.

2312
01:11:55,400 --> 01:11:58,640
You had to cart a bunch of fake snow into Arkansas.

2313
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:00,440
It was crazy.

2314
01:12:00,440 --> 01:12:01,440
Oh yeah, we shot it there.

2315
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:02,280
I like that.

2316
01:12:02,280 --> 01:12:04,520
No, we shot it in Winnipeg for Dogpatch.

2317
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:05,360
Scott.

2318
01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:06,440
We were, yes.

2319
01:12:06,440 --> 01:12:08,040
There's snow on the mountains in the Ozarks.

2320
01:12:08,040 --> 01:12:09,160
They had a ski lodge.

2321
01:12:09,160 --> 01:12:10,000
Oh, that's right.

2322
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:11,240
Oh wait, that came up.

2323
01:12:11,240 --> 01:12:12,720
But it was difficult

2324
01:12:12,720 --> 01:12:14,920
because they couldn't get snow regularly enough.

2325
01:12:14,920 --> 01:12:16,280
Oh really, because it was too hot.

2326
01:12:16,280 --> 01:12:17,120
Yeah.

2327
01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:18,720
They're like, let's do a ski lodge.

2328
01:12:18,720 --> 01:12:20,960
Yeah, that'll turn it around.

2329
01:12:22,240 --> 01:12:24,440
Well, okay, so what else do we have there?

2330
01:12:24,440 --> 01:12:27,000
I can name some names of things.

2331
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:27,920
There were live shows

2332
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:30,040
at a place called the Cornvention Center.

2333
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:36,280
There was a place called Barney Barnsmell's Skunk Works,

2334
01:12:36,360 --> 01:12:39,760
which was a bunch of Rube Goldberg machines that make soap.

2335
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:40,600
Yeah.

2336
01:12:40,600 --> 01:12:42,320
I remember a shooting game.

2337
01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:43,840
Oh wait, I think I have that.

2338
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:44,680
Yeah.

2339
01:12:44,680 --> 01:12:46,720
That might have been where I won the dogs.

2340
01:12:46,720 --> 01:12:47,560
Or the dog.

2341
01:12:47,560 --> 01:12:48,400
Could have been.

2342
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:49,840
Oh, that is, like the film,

2343
01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:51,760
this is one aspect of a lab inverse.

2344
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:53,120
I really like all the names.

2345
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:54,360
And this one's one of the best.

2346
01:12:54,360 --> 01:12:57,240
Rotten Ralphie's Ricochet Rifle Range.

2347
01:12:57,240 --> 01:12:58,280
Oh wow. Okay.

2348
01:12:58,280 --> 01:12:59,480
That's where you got your beloved.

2349
01:13:00,040 --> 01:13:01,560
Yes, I think that's what it was.

2350
01:13:03,560 --> 01:13:05,240
Are you looking at Wikipedia

2351
01:13:05,240 --> 01:13:06,360
or is there a different little lab nor wiki?

2352
01:13:06,360 --> 01:13:08,200
Oh, I pulled my own list.

2353
01:13:08,200 --> 01:13:12,360
This is just on the wiki and they have Trash Eaters.

2354
01:13:12,360 --> 01:13:13,200
Trash Eaters.

2355
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:14,200
Trash Eaters, it's amazing.

2356
01:13:14,200 --> 01:13:16,040
Do you remember the thing about the trash cans?

2357
01:13:16,040 --> 01:13:17,000
No, I don't remember this, but I read about it.

2358
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:18,360
Where they suck the trash out of your hand.

2359
01:13:18,360 --> 01:13:19,200
They suck the trash?

2360
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:21,320
They're all animals that eat your trash.

2361
01:13:21,320 --> 01:13:22,400
Yep.

2362
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:23,240
That is good.

2363
01:13:23,240 --> 01:13:24,240
Yeah, yeah.

2364
01:13:24,240 --> 01:13:25,080
Suction machines.

2365
01:13:25,080 --> 01:13:25,920
I love that idea.

2366
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:27,360
Innovators.

2367
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:30,000
Yeah, I'm looking at the,

2368
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:31,760
oh, that's the one I'm really intrigued by.

2369
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:34,160
There's no, I couldn't find a video of it.

2370
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:36,120
Little Abner Space Rocket.

2371
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:37,560
The writers had it in 1978.

2372
01:13:37,560 --> 01:13:39,920
It was a simulated trip into outer space,

2373
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:42,040
which means it was like a movie.

2374
01:13:42,040 --> 01:13:43,240
I don't remember this at all.

2375
01:13:43,240 --> 01:13:44,080
Yeah.

2376
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:47,040
It may have gone by the time, who knows.

2377
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:49,480
But why is he going to space?

2378
01:13:49,480 --> 01:13:50,560
That's unclear.

2379
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:52,560
Yeah, like it's really out of the.

2380
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:53,400
But Julie Neumann.

2381
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:54,240
He had no idea what it was to space.

2382
01:13:54,240 --> 01:13:55,960
In the movie was in a rocket.

2383
01:13:55,960 --> 01:13:56,800
Oh yeah.

2384
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:58,280
There was more of a rocket,

2385
01:13:58,280 --> 01:14:00,880
like an alien presence in these books.

2386
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:03,560
I think available Jones might have been an inventor

2387
01:14:03,560 --> 01:14:05,600
or scientist, because he looks like a dweeb.

2388
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:06,560
Right, he was a dweeb.

2389
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:11,000
You see all sorts of archetypes show up.

2390
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:14,880
There's a strip where the managers of the best boxer

2391
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:18,400
and the best wrestler in New York are very nervous,

2392
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:22,040
because little Abner has beaten up a dozen men

2393
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:24,960
and a new TV camera happened to be there.

2394
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:26,400
And they're like, what are we going to do?

2395
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,480
They're going to find out our clients aren't that strong.

2396
01:14:29,480 --> 01:14:31,720
There's nothing compared to this guy.

2397
01:14:31,720 --> 01:14:33,920
There's nothing compared to this corn-pone man.

2398
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:36,040
Who's never been trained to fight.

2399
01:14:36,040 --> 01:14:36,880
Yeah.

2400
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:37,720
You could kill him.

2401
01:14:37,720 --> 01:14:39,000
Pull a hillbilly rage.

2402
01:14:40,120 --> 01:14:42,560
He drinks another of that Kickapoo juice.

2403
01:14:42,560 --> 01:14:43,400
Joy juice.

2404
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:45,360
And kill everybody in Madison Square Garden.

2405
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:48,080
Blind trucking rage.

2406
01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:48,920
How much would you give me

2407
01:14:48,920 --> 01:14:50,760
if he killed not only the opposing boxer,

2408
01:14:50,760 --> 01:14:52,000
but everyone in the stands.

2409
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,040
Here's what you're going to do.

2410
01:14:54,040 --> 01:14:54,880
You're going to get wasted.

2411
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:55,920
Get him in three rounds.

2412
01:14:56,440 --> 01:14:57,280
And then you're going to start killing people

2413
01:14:57,280 --> 01:14:58,120
in the front row.

2414
01:14:58,120 --> 01:14:58,960
Punch everybody else.

2415
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:00,760
Work your way to the tent, to the mezzanine.

2416
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:02,920
And he was very happy-go-lucky, though, wasn't he?

2417
01:15:02,920 --> 01:15:03,760
Abner?

2418
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:04,600
Yeah.

2419
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:05,440
Yeah.

2420
01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:07,680
So it's funny that he also is extraordinarily violent.

2421
01:15:07,680 --> 01:15:08,520
Yeah.

2422
01:15:08,520 --> 01:15:09,360
Yeah.

2423
01:15:09,360 --> 01:15:10,200
Hey, I'm a nice guy.

2424
01:15:10,200 --> 01:15:11,040
He's naive.

2425
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:11,880
He was a wholesome.

2426
01:15:11,880 --> 01:15:12,720
He was an innocent.

2427
01:15:12,720 --> 01:15:15,160
That's the word I kept coming across.

2428
01:15:15,160 --> 01:15:16,000
An innocent.

2429
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:16,840
An innocent.

2430
01:15:16,840 --> 01:15:17,680
Unlike Abner.

2431
01:15:17,680 --> 01:15:19,520
He's an innocent of sexual harassment.

2432
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:20,360
Sometimes like, eh, you know.

2433
01:15:20,360 --> 01:15:21,880
But 43 years of a comic strip,

2434
01:15:21,880 --> 01:15:23,480
they're going to space at some point.

2435
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:24,320
I was talking with him.

2436
01:15:24,320 --> 01:15:25,160
He's like, what's left?

2437
01:15:25,160 --> 01:15:26,000
Space.

2438
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:26,840
Space.

2439
01:15:26,840 --> 01:15:27,680
Uh-huh.

2440
01:15:27,680 --> 01:15:29,720
Season seven of Halt, you would have gone to space.

2441
01:15:29,720 --> 01:15:30,560
Yeah, we would have, yes.

2442
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:31,720
And then they all become astronauts.

2443
01:15:31,720 --> 01:15:32,560
Space is the next.

2444
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:33,800
Where else do you go?

2445
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:35,360
Oh, Mission Impossible seven and eight.

2446
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:36,200
Better do space.

2447
01:15:36,200 --> 01:15:37,040
Oh, man.

2448
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:39,080
Please, Tom, do the training.

2449
01:15:39,080 --> 01:15:40,200
Oh, and it's really there.

2450
01:15:40,200 --> 01:15:41,920
They've teased it.

2451
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:43,000
But I don't know if they got to do it.

2452
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:44,040
They've teased space.

2453
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:44,880
I love that.

2454
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:45,720
I have not seen the last two.

2455
01:15:45,720 --> 01:15:46,560
Oh, they're great.

2456
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:47,400
Oh, they're, yeah.

2457
01:15:47,400 --> 01:15:49,840
But yeah, Tom, of course, will have to go to space for real.

2458
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:50,680
That's what they're saying.

2459
01:15:50,720 --> 01:15:52,760
Like, if we were to do space, they're not going to fake it.

2460
01:15:52,760 --> 01:15:55,320
Tom has to go to NASA and get trained.

2461
01:15:55,320 --> 01:15:56,680
That's what they're saying.

2462
01:15:56,680 --> 01:15:57,960
I don't know if that's what they're planning,

2463
01:15:57,960 --> 01:15:59,840
but it feels like they should.

2464
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:03,200
Then he's got to climb out of the real center of the Earth.

2465
01:16:03,200 --> 01:16:05,720
He's got to dig his way up from the core.

2466
01:16:05,720 --> 01:16:06,560
Like the core.

2467
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:07,400
The movie.

2468
01:16:07,400 --> 01:16:08,240
Oh, yeah, yeah.

2469
01:16:08,240 --> 01:16:09,080
It's a reverse core.

2470
01:16:09,080 --> 01:16:09,920
Reverse core.

2471
01:16:09,920 --> 01:16:11,520
He's buried in there, and he's got to make his way up.

2472
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:12,360
Stuck in the core.

2473
01:16:12,360 --> 01:16:14,840
Mission Impossible nine, reverse core.

2474
01:16:14,840 --> 01:16:16,000
Reverse core.

2475
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,520
The inertia kicks him into space when he emerges.

2476
01:16:18,520 --> 01:16:19,480
And that's where, oh, yeah.

2477
01:16:19,480 --> 01:16:20,320
So much force.

2478
01:16:20,680 --> 01:16:22,400
Maybe he comes back from space with space.

2479
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:23,760
He burrows into the...

2480
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:25,440
The key is getting back from space.

2481
01:16:25,440 --> 01:16:27,160
It's not getting out of the core.

2482
01:16:27,160 --> 01:16:30,120
It's getting back from space after the inertia of the explosion.

2483
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:33,000
Because he just free falls.

2484
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:34,360
He doesn't. He's not in a ship.

2485
01:16:34,360 --> 01:16:35,880
He just without a helmet.

2486
01:16:35,880 --> 01:16:38,640
He's got a minute to land under.

2487
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:40,400
Sounds like this franchise.

2488
01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:40,960
Yeah, he can do it.

2489
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:41,600
I mean, he can do that.

2490
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:44,080
He would like you would tell him that and he'd go, got it.

2491
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:45,680
Can do. I'll get training.

2492
01:16:45,680 --> 01:16:47,120
I'll do it. Yep.

2493
01:16:47,120 --> 01:16:49,080
I've already been training.

2494
01:16:49,080 --> 01:16:51,560
I actually was just working on that already.

2495
01:16:51,560 --> 01:16:53,000
Working with NASA as we speak.

2496
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,320
Yeah. So I'll be there in four hours.

2497
01:16:55,320 --> 01:16:57,520
Working with Dubai's NASA.

2498
01:16:57,520 --> 01:16:58,400
They're better.

2499
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:03,600
NASD.

2500
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:08,680
What else we got?

2501
01:17:08,680 --> 01:17:11,520
West Polk Chop Special.

2502
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:13,560
Spelled the West P.O.

2503
01:17:13,560 --> 01:17:18,080
Apostrophe K Chop S.P.E.S.H.U.L.

2504
01:17:18,480 --> 01:17:20,720
Miniature train with passenger cars,

2505
01:17:20,720 --> 01:17:23,040
carried guests on a circular track around the park.

2506
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:27,160
And it's, of course, using that bad dialect.

2507
01:17:27,160 --> 01:17:29,400
That we're Mammy Mammy Yocum,

2508
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:32,880
little Abner's mother, was always making poke chops for everyone.

2509
01:17:32,920 --> 01:17:34,760
I see. OK.

2510
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:36,520
So that was her train.

2511
01:17:36,520 --> 01:17:37,520
Mm hmm.

2512
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:39,080
She also had a train.

2513
01:17:39,080 --> 01:17:41,240
Is the dog also called?

2514
01:17:41,240 --> 01:17:42,880
But she retired.

2515
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:43,520
She liked to be at home.

2516
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:44,360
Focus on poke chop.

2517
01:17:44,360 --> 01:17:45,400
Poke chop Megan.

2518
01:17:45,400 --> 01:17:48,000
Well, because Pappy was a layabout, like Pappy.

2519
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,640
All the men were like, good for nothing layabouts.

2520
01:17:50,760 --> 01:17:51,800
It seemed like.

2521
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:53,560
So he was. So was it weird?

2522
01:17:53,560 --> 01:17:55,800
Like, was he saying all the men were lazy?

2523
01:17:55,800 --> 01:17:57,320
Was that sort of what is?

2524
01:17:57,320 --> 01:18:01,680
I think that's a common hillbilly trope is that the women are the workers have to do.

2525
01:18:01,680 --> 01:18:03,000
Yeah, they do everything.

2526
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,520
And the men are like, it's like Wonder Woman a little bit.

2527
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:07,200
I guess there's no men on the island, but

2528
01:18:08,480 --> 01:18:10,440
the women are also chasing the men around.

2529
01:18:10,440 --> 01:18:12,160
Yeah. So the women are actually sort of.

2530
01:18:12,160 --> 01:18:13,680
They're not sex crazed.

2531
01:18:13,680 --> 01:18:16,000
They're they're making food for everyone.

2532
01:18:16,480 --> 01:18:19,160
And are the women like empowered in the in the story?

2533
01:18:19,160 --> 01:18:21,160
Do we know? What do you think?

2534
01:18:21,160 --> 01:18:22,000
I don't know about that.

2535
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,360
What you learned about Sadie Hawkins today?

2536
01:18:24,360 --> 01:18:27,120
Yeah, they're empowered if they have a billionaire father.

2537
01:18:27,120 --> 01:18:28,960
Yeah, OK. There I get it now.

2538
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:31,520
There was a strip where Abner goes to meet something.

2539
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:33,040
A person named the ultimate.

2540
01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:35,840
And he is a man who got rich by selling ice.

2541
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:38,360
He sold ice to all the rich people.

2542
01:18:38,360 --> 01:18:39,680
Hmm. That's smart.

2543
01:18:39,680 --> 01:18:41,320
So 43 years.

2544
01:18:41,320 --> 01:18:44,480
Oh, you got to meet a rich ice guy at some point.

2545
01:18:45,480 --> 01:18:48,640
It's like a Eugene O'Neill like reference.

2546
01:18:49,640 --> 01:18:51,040
This guy's amazing.

2547
01:18:51,040 --> 01:18:52,400
They all talk him up and he shows up.

2548
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:54,360
He's just super depressive and ice man.

2549
01:18:54,360 --> 01:18:56,640
Just an old ice man.

2550
01:18:56,640 --> 01:18:59,000
Oh, Pappy Yocum has arrived.

2551
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:02,080
Pappy Yocum's positively petrifying pub mobiles.

2552
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:05,360
OK, those are go carts.

2553
01:19:05,360 --> 01:19:07,080
Then we got OK.

2554
01:19:07,080 --> 01:19:09,320
So this last name is spelled very strange.

2555
01:19:09,320 --> 01:19:10,920
And I looked apparently you have to.

2556
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:13,600
It is a it's a raspberry to say it.

2557
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:15,240
So it's sort of a farty sense.

2558
01:19:15,240 --> 01:19:20,200
So I guess you would say Joe in pending disaster machine.

2559
01:19:21,640 --> 01:19:23,960
Is the name of the ride?

2560
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:27,520
I'm going to put my kid on that.

2561
01:19:27,520 --> 01:19:29,560
You want to do Joe?

2562
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:31,520
What's the Joe one?

2563
01:19:33,040 --> 01:19:36,800
It's 98 degrees, 100 percent humidity.

2564
01:19:37,200 --> 01:19:41,240
Every ride is scorching hot metal as soon as you get on it.

2565
01:19:44,320 --> 01:19:47,120
I think I vaguely remember the go carts, but they blend together with go carts.

2566
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:48,920
I would ride a lot in Dallas.

2567
01:19:48,920 --> 01:19:50,920
No, it's like, yeah, any.

2568
01:19:50,920 --> 01:19:55,360
Which itself, the track itself was abandoned for like 25 years.

2569
01:19:55,600 --> 01:19:56,320
The Dallas.

2570
01:19:56,320 --> 01:19:59,520
Yeah, well, you just had to find it off the freeway, but you could.

2571
01:19:59,960 --> 01:20:04,080
Oh, you take a back and like also all the track was like overgrown with grass and stuff.

2572
01:20:04,200 --> 01:20:08,120
So if you brought your own go cart or got an old rusty one, you could.

2573
01:20:09,160 --> 01:20:11,680
Yeah, you could just get out there.

2574
01:20:11,680 --> 01:20:19,160
And then we get to earthquake Magoon's brain radler, which seems very dangerous.

2575
01:20:19,160 --> 01:20:21,280
It seems like it's probably a 48 incher, right?

2576
01:20:21,280 --> 01:20:22,920
I could have.

2577
01:20:22,920 --> 01:20:24,160
Yeah, sure.

2578
01:20:24,160 --> 01:20:25,240
I wasn't allowed on that one.

2579
01:20:25,240 --> 01:20:28,480
Maybe for the best, because it looks dangerous.

2580
01:20:28,480 --> 01:20:34,840
It's like a rusty red cage that you go up in a big spiral and then there's some like

2581
01:20:34,840 --> 01:20:37,440
very steep drops and hills.

2582
01:20:37,440 --> 01:20:39,360
It looks really unpleasant.

2583
01:20:40,120 --> 01:20:46,240
And it is now a lot of these rides got sold to a place called Little America with a K

2584
01:20:46,240 --> 01:20:50,760
jammed in there and sort of a creepy spikely fashion.

2585
01:20:51,800 --> 01:20:53,840
Where is the Little America?

2586
01:20:53,840 --> 01:20:55,520
Marshall, Wisconsin.

2587
01:20:55,520 --> 01:20:57,400
Gosh, they really traveled.

2588
01:20:57,400 --> 01:20:59,800
Yeah, these places are pretty the cabins.

2589
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:01,680
That whole road trip.

2590
01:21:01,680 --> 01:21:03,200
That's a boobiest.

2591
01:21:03,200 --> 01:21:05,000
Putting the Harry Nilsson into it.

2592
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,280
Everybody's talking about me.

2593
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:11,960
They've taken him up brain rattle on a train.

2594
01:21:11,960 --> 01:21:13,760
Rattlers seen a lot of good years.

2595
01:21:13,760 --> 01:21:15,520
Time to say goodbye.

2596
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:20,600
I think the Woodies from Toy Story is making his way around to these rides.

2597
01:21:20,600 --> 01:21:23,760
Now, next stop, the brain get lost.

2598
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:25,720
It's a new way.

2599
01:21:25,720 --> 01:21:27,760
What is the ride in the video?

2600
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:32,680
Is that the brain rather that has like big giant cars on this twirling?

2601
01:21:32,680 --> 01:21:33,960
That's the brain, right?

2602
01:21:33,960 --> 01:21:34,360
Yeah.

2603
01:21:34,360 --> 01:21:37,040
Where you're in the front, the windshield is a cage.

2604
01:21:37,040 --> 01:21:42,960
Yeah, it looks like I'm surprised it hasn't didn't fall off very regularly.

2605
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:44,640
It's so oversized.

2606
01:21:44,640 --> 01:21:45,520
It doesn't.

2607
01:21:45,520 --> 01:21:46,760
It's bizarre looking.

2608
01:21:46,760 --> 01:21:48,240
But we can ride it.

2609
01:21:48,240 --> 01:21:49,240
We can ride it now.

2610
01:21:49,240 --> 01:21:51,720
We can go on a renamed earthquake.

2611
01:21:51,720 --> 01:21:52,440
Magoons.

2612
01:21:52,440 --> 01:21:56,280
That's a next time you're in Marshall, Wisconsin.

2613
01:21:56,280 --> 01:21:56,960
That's amazing.

2614
01:21:56,960 --> 01:21:59,360
You could just like those rides last that long.

2615
01:21:59,360 --> 01:22:00,120
Right. Yeah.

2616
01:22:00,120 --> 01:22:03,000
Yeah. It's like planes where you don't realize.

2617
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:06,640
We should go on a trip and ride all the rides from dogpatch.

2618
01:22:08,040 --> 01:22:09,520
The incredible.

2619
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:13,520
This podcast gets like, oh, we're going to die.

2620
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:14,600
We spent four grand.

2621
01:22:14,600 --> 01:22:17,440
Self-financed.

2622
01:22:17,440 --> 01:22:19,440
The trip.

2623
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:20,720
You don't even do a TV show.

2624
01:22:20,720 --> 01:22:23,520
The four hour drive from Milwaukee or Madison.

2625
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:25,720
Oh, wait.

2626
01:22:25,720 --> 01:22:27,680
I'm flying into Milwaukee next week.

2627
01:22:27,680 --> 01:22:29,760
Wisconsin to visit my friend.

2628
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:30,240
Oh, you are?

2629
01:22:30,240 --> 01:22:31,080
Yeah, no, I'm not joking.

2630
01:22:31,080 --> 01:22:32,520
Oh, how far is a little US?

2631
01:22:32,520 --> 01:22:33,280
Look it up.

2632
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:34,080
I don't know.

2633
01:22:34,080 --> 01:22:35,360
Oh, man.

2634
01:22:35,360 --> 01:22:36,240
You go on earthquake.

2635
01:22:36,240 --> 01:22:39,880
Mike uses chase points to go on the dogpatch.

2636
01:22:39,880 --> 01:22:40,880
That would be awesome.

2637
01:22:40,880 --> 01:22:42,120
I got to go visit earthquake.

2638
01:22:42,120 --> 01:22:43,000
Magoon.

2639
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,320
Immediately killed.

2640
01:22:45,320 --> 01:22:47,040
I think your weight would be too much.

2641
01:22:47,040 --> 01:22:48,840
You're far too tall for this.

2642
01:22:48,840 --> 01:22:51,160
You'd have to punch your way out of the screen.

2643
01:22:51,160 --> 01:22:51,880
That's a good point.

2644
01:22:51,880 --> 01:22:52,480
What's a cause?

2645
01:22:52,480 --> 01:22:53,840
How do you spell little USA?

2646
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:55,440
I just put a K in there.

2647
01:22:55,440 --> 01:22:56,480
A little America.

2648
01:22:56,480 --> 01:22:57,880
C and K or just K?

2649
01:22:57,880 --> 01:22:58,840
C and K, yes.

2650
01:22:58,840 --> 01:22:59,320
OK.

2651
01:22:59,320 --> 01:23:00,640
That's why it's like the Russian.

2652
01:23:00,640 --> 01:23:01,760
Yeah, more like that.

2653
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:03,880
I shouldn't imply racism.

2654
01:23:03,880 --> 01:23:04,960
Well, it could be.

2655
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:05,480
It could.

2656
01:23:05,480 --> 01:23:08,080
I don't want to discount the possibility.

2657
01:23:08,080 --> 01:23:12,320
The park is just an indictment of the United States.

2658
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:13,240
This place is weird.

2659
01:23:13,240 --> 01:23:16,040
It's all little parody scenes.

2660
01:23:16,040 --> 01:23:18,040
God.

2661
01:23:18,040 --> 01:23:19,800
You think this country is going to find this?

2662
01:23:19,800 --> 01:23:20,600
Yeah, you'll figure it out.

2663
01:23:20,600 --> 01:23:22,600
It's like a whole park that's an editorial cartoon.

2664
01:23:22,600 --> 01:23:25,440
All the trash cans are labeled trash can.

2665
01:23:25,440 --> 01:23:26,720
Trash can.

2666
01:23:26,720 --> 01:23:27,760
Yeah, everything is labeled.

2667
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:31,520
Senate, the Senate, the clowns in Congress.

2668
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:32,560
Or is it from the other?

2669
01:23:32,560 --> 01:23:33,920
Is it like abortion clinic?

2670
01:23:33,920 --> 01:23:34,760
Oh, God.

2671
01:23:34,760 --> 01:23:35,440
Every corner.

2672
01:23:35,440 --> 01:23:36,840
Oh, it's an indictment of liberal America.

2673
01:23:36,840 --> 01:23:37,880
Oh, maybe.

2674
01:23:37,880 --> 01:23:38,400
That's interesting.

2675
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:39,560
Oh, you were thinking it's a parody.

2676
01:23:39,560 --> 01:23:40,320
Little America.

2677
01:23:40,320 --> 01:23:40,840
Oh, no.

2678
01:23:40,840 --> 01:23:42,320
I was like, you know, it's.

2679
01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:43,800
But yeah, an indictment of liberal America

2680
01:23:43,800 --> 01:23:44,560
would also be great.

2681
01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:45,720
That's another little theme.

2682
01:23:45,720 --> 01:23:47,400
That's a little theme park you could do.

2683
01:23:47,400 --> 01:23:49,600
Well, that's maybe what Heritage USA almost turned into,

2684
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:51,600
which we will come around to in a little bit.

2685
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:52,160
Oh, my God.

2686
01:23:52,160 --> 01:23:53,040
There's so much to talk about.

2687
01:23:53,040 --> 01:23:54,320
We haven't even gotten to Heritage.

2688
01:23:54,320 --> 01:23:54,840
So much to talk.

2689
01:23:54,840 --> 01:23:57,480
I'm assuming you have the full ownership history.

2690
01:23:57,480 --> 01:23:58,000
I do.

2691
01:23:58,000 --> 01:23:59,560
Oh, that's where it starts getting fun.

2692
01:23:59,560 --> 01:24:03,040
So I'll start blasting through some other stuff.

2693
01:24:03,040 --> 01:24:03,480
OK.

2694
01:24:03,480 --> 01:24:05,120
So they opened this park.

2695
01:24:05,120 --> 01:24:07,000
It immediately does not do as well

2696
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,040
as they think it's going to do.

2697
01:24:09,040 --> 01:24:12,240
In the documentary, they talk to Al Cap's son, who says,

2698
01:24:12,240 --> 01:24:14,960
the day it opened, I called my brother, and I said,

2699
01:24:14,960 --> 01:24:16,840
this is a mistake.

2700
01:24:16,840 --> 01:24:18,320
There's no easy way to get here.

2701
01:24:18,320 --> 01:24:19,400
It's not on the interstate.

2702
01:24:19,400 --> 01:24:21,320
It's got to compete with Silver Dollar.

2703
01:24:21,320 --> 01:24:22,800
They opened it before I was ready.

2704
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:25,280
This thing's headed for a fall.

2705
01:24:25,280 --> 01:24:26,560
All of those things were right.

2706
01:24:26,560 --> 01:24:27,360
All of it was correct.

2707
01:24:27,360 --> 01:24:28,480
I guess it went for a while, though.

2708
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:29,200
But it did, yeah.

2709
01:24:29,200 --> 01:24:30,680
It's like 35 years.

2710
01:24:30,680 --> 01:24:32,480
We've covered things on the show that were open for eight

2711
01:24:32,480 --> 01:24:33,400
months.

2712
01:24:33,400 --> 01:24:35,640
This thing made it a long time.

2713
01:24:35,640 --> 01:24:36,160
Yeah.

2714
01:24:36,160 --> 01:24:36,660
35 years.

2715
01:24:36,660 --> 01:24:38,520
It's still healthy enough in the 80s where you had a nice time

2716
01:24:38,520 --> 01:24:39,600
there.

2717
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:41,160
I remember the dancing.

2718
01:24:41,160 --> 01:24:44,800
I remember vaguely character people.

2719
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:46,960
But I don't know what they were.

2720
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:50,760
But it was just people with augmented features.

2721
01:24:50,760 --> 01:24:51,800
You know what I mean?

2722
01:24:51,800 --> 01:24:53,480
Heavily augmented.

2723
01:24:53,480 --> 01:24:54,920
I don't remember that.

2724
01:24:54,920 --> 01:24:55,760
I don't remember that.

2725
01:24:55,760 --> 01:25:00,000
But I remember the wigs and the big, bright blue jeans

2726
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:03,440
and the checkered, the gingham.

2727
01:25:03,440 --> 01:25:04,440
Oh, yeah.

2728
01:25:04,440 --> 01:25:05,920
OK, OK.

2729
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:08,320
Would they talk to you or put on shows?

2730
01:25:08,320 --> 01:25:10,640
I remember there were dancing shows and stuff.

2731
01:25:10,640 --> 01:25:13,400
And they would come out and do the whole theme park

2732
01:25:13,400 --> 01:25:17,420
performance thing of Abner, whatever it was.

2733
01:25:17,420 --> 01:25:18,320
I'm filling it in.

2734
01:25:18,320 --> 01:25:21,400
But I just remember the noise sensation.

2735
01:25:21,400 --> 01:25:22,640
The most playing out.

2736
01:25:22,640 --> 01:25:23,880
You better get in.

2737
01:25:23,880 --> 01:25:24,800
That kind of stuff.

2738
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:25,280
Well.

2739
01:25:25,280 --> 01:25:27,160
Stop hand-pegging me.

2740
01:25:30,480 --> 01:25:32,080
We should just write the stage show.

2741
01:25:32,080 --> 01:25:33,080
Yeah, just for fun.

2742
01:25:33,080 --> 01:25:35,320
Yeah, we can do it in 15 minutes.

2743
01:25:35,320 --> 01:25:37,080
Is the CW one just called Abner?

2744
01:25:37,080 --> 01:25:38,120
No, it's called Dog Patch.

2745
01:25:38,120 --> 01:25:39,040
It's called Dog Patch.

2746
01:25:39,040 --> 01:25:39,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2747
01:25:39,680 --> 01:25:40,160
Good point.

2748
01:25:40,160 --> 01:25:40,760
The Patch.

2749
01:25:40,760 --> 01:25:42,040
The Patch is good, too.

2750
01:25:42,040 --> 01:25:43,840
Yeah.

2751
01:25:43,840 --> 01:25:47,640
So it's doing poorly.

2752
01:25:47,640 --> 01:25:48,680
From the beginning.

2753
01:25:48,680 --> 01:25:49,640
As soon as it opens.

2754
01:25:49,640 --> 01:25:52,360
Barely surviving for 35 years is awesome.

2755
01:25:52,360 --> 01:25:52,840
Instantly.

2756
01:25:52,840 --> 01:25:53,600
That's torture.

2757
01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:54,400
That's hell.

2758
01:25:54,400 --> 01:25:55,040
Yeah, I know.

2759
01:25:55,040 --> 01:25:56,320
It should have been put out of its misery.

2760
01:25:56,320 --> 01:25:57,400
I want to meet the one employee who

2761
01:25:57,400 --> 01:25:59,520
was there from the beginning and made it all the way through.

2762
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:00,040
I know.

2763
01:26:00,040 --> 01:26:01,560
I got it in years.

2764
01:26:01,560 --> 01:26:02,960
We find that in theme parks.

2765
01:26:02,960 --> 01:26:05,240
People make the entire runs.

2766
01:26:05,240 --> 01:26:07,200
I remember the head of Disneyland marketing

2767
01:26:07,200 --> 01:26:10,320
started as a churro salesman in 1971.

2768
01:26:10,320 --> 01:26:11,760
Well, that was one of those situations.

2769
01:26:11,760 --> 01:26:13,600
He was the head of marketing for Disneyland.

2770
01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:14,720
He was a very nice guy.

2771
01:26:14,720 --> 01:26:16,240
You could really go all the way.

2772
01:26:16,240 --> 01:26:17,840
He went all the way up, man.

2773
01:26:17,840 --> 01:26:19,600
OK, really quick.

2774
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:21,320
Because you work for Disney marketing,

2775
01:26:21,320 --> 01:26:22,240
as did we both for a little while.

2776
01:26:22,240 --> 01:26:23,480
That's a whole other thing.

2777
01:26:23,480 --> 01:26:24,080
Don't have time.

2778
01:26:24,080 --> 01:26:25,880
Got to get to Kickapoo.

2779
01:26:25,880 --> 01:26:28,000
But did you ever go into Imagineering

2780
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:31,280
and see some secret that is now a thing they have open?

2781
01:26:31,280 --> 01:26:33,280
I went to the Imagineering archives.

2782
01:26:33,280 --> 01:26:34,200
So that's in Glendale.

2783
01:26:34,200 --> 01:26:36,640
And it's in a very nondescript building

2784
01:26:36,640 --> 01:26:39,360
that looks like a library, like a one-story library.

2785
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:40,640
You could drive right up to it.

2786
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:43,720
Yeah, but they had all the old stuff.

2787
01:26:43,720 --> 01:26:45,440
It's just in storage.

2788
01:26:45,440 --> 01:26:48,720
The painting behind Walt Disney that they would

2789
01:26:48,720 --> 01:26:50,720
have on the Disneyland show.

2790
01:26:50,720 --> 01:26:51,360
Jeez.

2791
01:26:51,360 --> 01:26:55,160
And how that, when you turned a different light on it,

2792
01:26:55,160 --> 01:26:56,880
it would be the park at night.

2793
01:26:56,920 --> 01:26:58,920
And that was painted in like, 54.

2794
01:26:58,920 --> 01:27:01,000
Which is like, I don't know how they even did that.

2795
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,240
And it was painted on wood.

2796
01:27:03,240 --> 01:27:05,520
Art that could work as a night scape that glowed?

2797
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:07,840
It would become the park at night

2798
01:27:07,840 --> 01:27:09,280
when you hit different light with it.

2799
01:27:09,280 --> 01:27:11,200
Those old painters were no joke.

2800
01:27:11,200 --> 01:27:13,280
Because we've talked about how the guys who

2801
01:27:13,280 --> 01:27:15,360
did the backgrounds in the movies, then just,

2802
01:27:15,360 --> 01:27:17,360
if you'd like, I did the backgrounds in Alice in Wonderland

2803
01:27:17,360 --> 01:27:17,920
the movie.

2804
01:27:17,920 --> 01:27:19,280
And I did the ride.

2805
01:27:19,280 --> 01:27:21,440
I did the same thing 12 feet bigger than.

2806
01:27:21,440 --> 01:27:21,960
Yeah.

2807
01:27:21,960 --> 01:27:24,120
I think when we walked away from Disney,

2808
01:27:24,120 --> 01:27:25,200
we had our problems.

2809
01:27:25,200 --> 01:27:30,440
But I had such an incredible respect for Disneyland

2810
01:27:30,440 --> 01:27:33,360
and Disney World.

2811
01:27:33,360 --> 01:27:35,400
I even get kind of offended when people are like, oh,

2812
01:27:35,400 --> 01:27:36,000
Disneyland.

2813
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:37,040
I want to take my kid there.

2814
01:27:37,040 --> 01:27:38,000
I want to take him.

2815
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,760
I'm like, it's an actual incredible experience.

2816
01:27:40,760 --> 01:27:44,040
I mean, blood was shed for this park.

2817
01:27:44,040 --> 01:27:44,560
Right?

2818
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:45,560
As good as it is.

2819
01:27:45,560 --> 01:27:46,560
Yeah.

2820
01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:48,560
Well, look what can happen to a theme park.

2821
01:27:48,560 --> 01:27:49,920
Look how it can decay in the nature.

2822
01:27:49,920 --> 01:27:51,680
This feels more like a mercenary venture.

2823
01:27:51,680 --> 01:27:54,080
This is a guy with a trout pond being like, I want more.

2824
01:27:55,080 --> 01:27:55,880
What is it?

2825
01:27:55,880 --> 01:27:56,440
I don't know.

2826
01:27:56,440 --> 01:27:57,760
Little Abner?

2827
01:27:57,760 --> 01:27:59,200
Well, but so I think what happened

2828
01:27:59,200 --> 01:28:03,040
was the guy who opened it, and this guy, OJ Snow, was smart.

2829
01:28:03,040 --> 01:28:05,240
He said, we did OK this first summer.

2830
01:28:05,240 --> 01:28:06,840
I think we should take the money we earned

2831
01:28:06,840 --> 01:28:08,160
and put it back into the park.

2832
01:28:08,160 --> 01:28:10,880
And then the other investors were like, no, give it to us,

2833
01:28:10,880 --> 01:28:11,680
please.

2834
01:28:11,680 --> 01:28:13,680
So they were depleting funds right away.

2835
01:28:13,680 --> 01:28:14,200
Oh, god.

2836
01:28:14,200 --> 01:28:14,880
It was one summer.

2837
01:28:14,880 --> 01:28:16,200
That's all we were in for.

2838
01:28:16,200 --> 01:28:16,920
And in order.

2839
01:28:16,920 --> 01:28:18,440
Summer of 68.

2840
01:28:18,440 --> 01:28:19,280
That's plenty.

2841
01:28:19,280 --> 01:28:20,520
People need theme parks.

2842
01:28:20,520 --> 01:28:21,640
They probably did that summer.

2843
01:28:21,640 --> 01:28:22,360
That was a bad year.

2844
01:28:22,360 --> 01:28:23,520
So it was a very bad summer.

2845
01:28:23,920 --> 01:28:25,560
Speaking of bad stuff at the time,

2846
01:28:25,560 --> 01:28:27,920
if we weren't depressing enough as it is,

2847
01:28:27,920 --> 01:28:30,520
they brought in a guy to be the president of Dogpash

2848
01:28:30,520 --> 01:28:32,720
to take it into its second year.

2849
01:28:32,720 --> 01:28:33,920
Who did they bring in?

2850
01:28:33,920 --> 01:28:37,480
But former Arkansas governor Orval Faubus.

2851
01:28:37,480 --> 01:28:40,640
He's less fun than Jubilation T Cornpone

2852
01:28:40,640 --> 01:28:43,040
because he's the governor who refused

2853
01:28:43,040 --> 01:28:46,080
to comply with Brown versus Board of Education

2854
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:48,800
and stopped nine African-American students

2855
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:50,320
from entering Little Rock High School.

2856
01:28:50,320 --> 01:28:52,160
They were called the Little Rock Nine.

2857
01:28:52,200 --> 01:28:55,280
He is the governor who said, send the guards,

2858
01:28:55,280 --> 01:28:57,000
make sure they don't get into the high school.

2859
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:58,280
And they had to be ushered in.

2860
01:28:58,280 --> 01:29:00,200
So this is 1969.

2861
01:29:00,200 --> 01:29:02,160
Probably the summer after, right?

2862
01:29:02,160 --> 01:29:04,680
I don't remember when this event happened, but in 69.

2863
01:29:04,680 --> 01:29:06,440
No, but no, 69 when he was made president.

2864
01:29:06,440 --> 01:29:07,520
He's made president of Dogpash.

2865
01:29:07,520 --> 01:29:08,920
So this is very fresh.

2866
01:29:08,920 --> 01:29:09,960
Yeah, really recent.

2867
01:29:09,960 --> 01:29:11,200
In people's minds.

2868
01:29:11,200 --> 01:29:11,840
Yes.

2869
01:29:11,840 --> 01:29:13,120
Like I was saying, if it was.

2870
01:29:13,120 --> 01:29:15,000
The Norman Rockwell painting.

2871
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,720
It's reached the heartland.

2872
01:29:17,720 --> 01:29:18,480
Yeah.

2873
01:29:18,480 --> 01:29:18,960
Story.

2874
01:29:18,960 --> 01:29:20,960
And they're like, this guy.

2875
01:29:20,960 --> 01:29:21,680
Yes.

2876
01:29:21,680 --> 01:29:22,560
He's untainted.

2877
01:29:22,560 --> 01:29:25,240
And people got a good enough feeling about Orville Faubus.

2878
01:29:25,240 --> 01:29:30,080
Like if there was a park called Fun Time Good World USA,

2879
01:29:30,080 --> 01:29:32,200
we'd meet your president, Stephen Miller.

2880
01:29:32,200 --> 01:29:33,920
Yeah, like that's so.

2881
01:29:33,920 --> 01:29:36,960
What's that guy Stephen Miller doing?

2882
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:37,960
You know what he should do?

2883
01:29:37,960 --> 01:29:40,840
He should be in charge of Tomorrowland.

2884
01:29:40,840 --> 01:29:41,640
That'd be fun.

2885
01:29:41,640 --> 01:29:44,120
He's the new mayor of Main Street.

2886
01:29:44,120 --> 01:29:45,200
Mayor of Main Street.

2887
01:29:45,200 --> 01:29:46,880
In four years.

2888
01:29:46,880 --> 01:29:49,360
I don't think that's that impossible, no.

2889
01:29:49,400 --> 01:29:51,280
Spicers on goddamn.

2890
01:29:51,280 --> 01:29:52,600
Dancing with the Stars.

2891
01:29:52,600 --> 01:29:55,480
Where Rick Perry was on it before he became secretary of energy.

2892
01:29:55,480 --> 01:29:55,960
That's right.

2893
01:29:55,960 --> 01:29:56,640
Oh my god.

2894
01:29:56,640 --> 01:29:58,280
So it's like, OK, let's just pick him.

2895
01:29:58,280 --> 01:29:59,440
Whatever you want, man.

2896
01:29:59,440 --> 01:30:00,280
Kellyanne.

2897
01:30:00,280 --> 01:30:01,800
See, Kellyanne was like a character.

2898
01:30:01,800 --> 01:30:03,040
She was like an SNL person.

2899
01:30:03,040 --> 01:30:04,920
She's not a real person who's contributing

2900
01:30:04,920 --> 01:30:06,440
to the rise of fascism.

2901
01:30:06,440 --> 01:30:08,400
She'll be the one that's mayor of Main Street.

2902
01:30:08,400 --> 01:30:09,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2903
01:30:09,240 --> 01:30:09,960
Actually, yeah.

2904
01:30:09,960 --> 01:30:11,600
She seems harmless enough.

2905
01:30:11,600 --> 01:30:13,320
She's like, I'm just about having fun now.

2906
01:30:13,320 --> 01:30:15,240
I'm excited to join the Disney family.

2907
01:30:15,240 --> 01:30:16,960
I'm having a great time.

2908
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:17,960
It's going to be nice.

2909
01:30:17,960 --> 01:30:19,000
The cookie smell.

2910
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:19,800
My goodness.

2911
01:30:19,800 --> 01:30:20,680
Stop asking.

2912
01:30:20,680 --> 01:30:22,680
Everything's fine on Main Street.

2913
01:30:22,680 --> 01:30:24,760
Really don't see that explosion.

2914
01:30:24,760 --> 01:30:29,080
God, the horses are doing great.

2915
01:30:29,080 --> 01:30:30,600
That's how they've always walked.

2916
01:30:30,600 --> 01:30:32,480
Horses walk limp.

2917
01:30:32,480 --> 01:30:33,680
Horses cry all the time.

2918
01:30:36,080 --> 01:30:40,400
But this guy only was the president for he left within the year

2919
01:30:40,400 --> 01:30:43,920
to unsuccessfully run for governor again, which he did.

2920
01:30:43,920 --> 01:30:46,120
Well, he was given a platform by Dogpatch.

2921
01:30:46,120 --> 01:30:48,160
To be fair, he was like, this is my moment.

2922
01:30:48,160 --> 01:30:48,680
Yeah.

2923
01:30:48,920 --> 01:30:49,680
You got to seize it.

2924
01:30:49,680 --> 01:30:50,880
Let's become governor again.

2925
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:52,800
He's like, I could be a real politician again.

2926
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:55,280
He tried two more times to become governor of Arkansas

2927
01:30:55,280 --> 01:30:56,360
and failed both times.

2928
01:30:56,360 --> 01:31:00,920
The last time he was defeated in 1986 by one Bill Clinton.

2929
01:31:00,920 --> 01:31:02,640
So he dovetails right into.

2930
01:31:02,640 --> 01:31:04,440
I mean, I don't want to assume anything,

2931
01:31:04,440 --> 01:31:07,280
but Clinton must have just had that nailed if that's

2932
01:31:07,280 --> 01:31:08,680
the guy he was running against.

2933
01:31:08,680 --> 01:31:12,800
Well, I think it was like 69 to 30.

2934
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:14,440
Right.

2935
01:31:14,440 --> 01:31:16,280
But I mean, you could have put up.

2936
01:31:16,280 --> 01:31:18,280
I don't want to give Arkansas too much credit,

2937
01:31:18,280 --> 01:31:20,000
but you could have put up anybody at that point.

2938
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:21,160
You could have put up Abner.

2939
01:31:21,160 --> 01:31:22,480
You could have put up a little Abner.

2940
01:31:22,480 --> 01:31:24,120
He's not only like a political loser,

2941
01:31:24,120 --> 01:31:28,760
but also infamous as far as American politicians go.

2942
01:31:28,760 --> 01:31:29,520
A villain.

2943
01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:33,160
So all you have to do is say Little Rock Nine.

2944
01:31:33,160 --> 01:31:35,360
He's a little bit charismatic.

2945
01:31:35,360 --> 01:31:37,000
I wonder if people came up to him at Dogpatch

2946
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,400
and were like, Little Rock Nine.

2947
01:31:39,400 --> 01:31:41,440
Little Rock Nine, I remember.

2948
01:31:41,440 --> 01:31:43,080
They would have disliked him by then.

2949
01:31:43,080 --> 01:31:45,680
Just throwing the Kickapoo Juice on him?

2950
01:31:45,680 --> 01:31:46,520
Hey, fuck you.

2951
01:31:46,520 --> 01:31:47,360
Is that piss?

2952
01:31:47,360 --> 01:31:49,200
No, it's Kickapoo Joy Juice.

2953
01:31:49,200 --> 01:31:50,560
This guy threw piss on me.

2954
01:31:50,560 --> 01:31:52,360
That's our juice.

2955
01:31:52,360 --> 01:31:53,640
I wish it had been piss.

2956
01:31:53,640 --> 01:31:55,800
I wish it had been piss.

2957
01:31:55,800 --> 01:31:56,760
I dreamed of piss.

2958
01:31:56,760 --> 01:32:00,760
Kickapoo Juice, you'd wish it had been piss.

2959
01:32:00,760 --> 01:32:03,840
This doesn't burn through your clothes like Kickapoo Joy Juice

2960
01:32:03,840 --> 01:32:04,600
does.

2961
01:32:04,600 --> 01:32:05,760
It's pure alcohol.

2962
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:06,280
Yeah.

2963
01:32:06,280 --> 01:32:07,640
It evaporates in the air.

2964
01:32:07,640 --> 01:32:08,840
I don't end up with holes.

2965
01:32:08,840 --> 01:32:11,920
You can't look directly at it.

2966
01:32:11,920 --> 01:32:14,440
Why is the bottle shaking?

2967
01:32:14,440 --> 01:32:16,800
I didn't say, by the way, that Kickapoo Joy Juice is only

2968
01:32:16,800 --> 01:32:20,320
available in Singapore, Malaysia, Brunei, Cambodia,

2969
01:32:20,320 --> 01:32:21,400
and Bangladesh.

2970
01:32:21,400 --> 01:32:22,440
Wait, today?

2971
01:32:22,440 --> 01:32:23,080
What?

2972
01:32:23,080 --> 01:32:23,920
It still is?

2973
01:32:23,920 --> 01:32:26,000
I'm sorry, and you can buy it at specialty stores,

2974
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:27,360
like fun little soda shops.

2975
01:32:27,360 --> 01:32:28,960
Oh, so it's still bottled in mate?

2976
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:30,840
Can you get it at Rocket Fizz over in Burbank?

2977
01:32:30,840 --> 01:32:32,400
I thought about getting it at Rocket Fizz,

2978
01:32:32,400 --> 01:32:34,120
but there's too much to talk about.

2979
01:32:34,120 --> 01:32:34,920
Damn, oh my god.

2980
01:32:34,920 --> 01:32:36,960
I thought about doing a Kickapoo Joy Juice.

2981
01:32:36,960 --> 01:32:39,720
So there's one product that's still out there.

2982
01:32:39,720 --> 01:32:40,760
Yeah, Kickapoo.

2983
01:32:40,760 --> 01:32:42,800
I don't know that it was ever super affiliated with the park.

2984
01:32:42,800 --> 01:32:44,200
I've seen this can before.

2985
01:32:44,200 --> 01:32:44,760
Really?

2986
01:32:44,760 --> 01:32:46,040
You've run into Kickapoo Joy Juice?

2987
01:32:46,080 --> 01:32:49,640
Yeah, at least on the racks at the old soda shops.

2988
01:32:49,640 --> 01:32:50,160
Yeah.

2989
01:32:50,160 --> 01:32:51,160
Oh, yeah, here it is.

2990
01:32:51,160 --> 01:32:52,280
It is at Rocket Fizz.

2991
01:32:52,280 --> 01:32:52,560
Did you check?

2992
01:32:52,560 --> 01:32:53,680
Yeah, we could get it down the street.

2993
01:32:53,680 --> 01:32:55,320
Yeah, I thought about doing it on the way,

2994
01:32:55,320 --> 01:32:56,640
but Kickapoo Joy Juice.

2995
01:32:56,640 --> 01:32:57,720
There's so much coming.

2996
01:32:57,720 --> 01:33:00,400
You just stay tuned, everybody, because holy shit.

2997
01:33:00,400 --> 01:33:03,520
I'm going to try to pick up the pace here.

2998
01:33:03,520 --> 01:33:05,960
But it's the most popular in Bangladesh.

2999
01:33:05,960 --> 01:33:06,600
Interesting.

3000
01:33:06,600 --> 01:33:10,120
It's like the Faygo of Bangladesh for ICP fans.

3001
01:33:10,120 --> 01:33:11,600
Yeah.

3002
01:33:11,600 --> 01:33:14,920
I'm going to try it.

3003
01:33:14,920 --> 01:33:18,600
So things are going badly.

3004
01:33:18,600 --> 01:33:19,840
Orville left.

3005
01:33:19,840 --> 01:33:21,720
The energy crisis begins.

3006
01:33:21,720 --> 01:33:22,440
Oh, that's right.

3007
01:33:22,440 --> 01:33:24,920
And so people are struggling to have the gas to make it

3008
01:33:24,920 --> 01:33:26,880
to all the way off the interstate.

3009
01:33:26,880 --> 01:33:29,520
You got to go off the freeway to Highway 11.

3010
01:33:29,520 --> 01:33:30,440
Oh, wow, jeez.

3011
01:33:30,440 --> 01:33:31,680
Is that what it is, Highway 11?

3012
01:33:31,680 --> 01:33:32,320
I think that's what it is.

3013
01:33:32,320 --> 01:33:32,840
Could be.

3014
01:33:32,840 --> 01:33:34,920
That sounds right.

3015
01:33:34,920 --> 01:33:36,360
And then Al Cap dies.

3016
01:33:36,360 --> 01:33:37,800
They stop making the comic strips,

3017
01:33:37,800 --> 01:33:40,080
so the property is no longer relevant.

3018
01:33:40,080 --> 01:33:41,400
The rural purge happens.

3019
01:33:41,400 --> 01:33:43,520
We don't care about Pekah Junction anymore.

3020
01:33:43,560 --> 01:33:47,000
1980, the worst heat wave in Arkansas history.

3021
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:50,480
So many events are putting nails in the coffin.

3022
01:33:50,480 --> 01:33:51,600
How do we turn it around?

3023
01:33:51,600 --> 01:33:54,560
Let's get Uncle Jesse from the Dukes of Hazzard.

3024
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:55,160
That's right.

3025
01:33:55,160 --> 01:33:55,920
I read about this.

3026
01:33:55,920 --> 01:33:57,280
They got Uncle Jesse.

3027
01:33:57,280 --> 01:33:58,440
That's his plan.

3028
01:33:58,440 --> 01:34:00,040
Even in the Wikipedia article, they're

3029
01:34:00,040 --> 01:34:01,440
like, popular country artist.

3030
01:34:01,440 --> 01:34:03,440
I'm like, really?

3031
01:34:03,440 --> 01:34:04,000
Really?

3032
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:04,520
Maybe.

3033
01:34:04,520 --> 01:34:05,560
Did he sing the song?

3034
01:34:05,560 --> 01:34:07,360
That's got to be like an instrument or way.

3035
01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:08,880
No, that's Waylon Jennings.

3036
01:34:08,880 --> 01:34:10,720
That's legit.

3037
01:34:10,720 --> 01:34:11,560
Outlaw country.

3038
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,360
I mean, that's what was going on around that time, though.

3039
01:34:16,360 --> 01:34:17,360
But it's like, really?

3040
01:34:17,360 --> 01:34:18,720
The Dukes of Hazzard guy?

3041
01:34:18,720 --> 01:34:19,360
Yeah, yeah.

3042
01:34:19,360 --> 01:34:21,160
When is this whole other wave happening?

3043
01:34:21,160 --> 01:34:22,720
And we're doing this like still TV.

3044
01:34:22,720 --> 01:34:25,280
Like Willie Nelson Prime.

3045
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:28,680
There's a much cooler way to do country now.

3046
01:34:28,680 --> 01:34:30,800
I see, I see.

3047
01:34:30,800 --> 01:34:33,760
So culture's not lining up with this place.

3048
01:34:33,760 --> 01:34:35,600
Branson's taking off.

3049
01:34:35,600 --> 01:34:37,360
Branson.

3050
01:34:37,360 --> 01:34:39,040
So many reasons people are leaving.

3051
01:34:39,040 --> 01:34:42,360
And in 1991, they don't want to keep paying the cap estate.

3052
01:34:42,360 --> 01:34:46,160
And the place closes permanently in 1993.

3053
01:34:46,160 --> 01:34:46,920
Then what?

3054
01:34:46,920 --> 01:34:48,200
Because it's still there.

3055
01:34:48,200 --> 01:34:51,760
Goes fallow for like just untouched.

3056
01:34:51,760 --> 01:34:54,040
That must be the end of interesting, funny, weird,

3057
01:34:54,040 --> 01:34:55,360
horrible things, right?

3058
01:34:55,360 --> 01:34:57,120
You survived podcast the right way.

3059
01:34:57,120 --> 01:34:59,800
Wait a minute, hang on.

3060
01:34:59,800 --> 01:35:03,160
So I'm not really sure what happens until 2002.

3061
01:35:03,160 --> 01:35:05,720
I'm not quite clear on who owns it.

3062
01:35:05,720 --> 01:35:07,920
But pre-internet though, so it's great.

3063
01:35:07,920 --> 01:35:11,120
So it can just sit there and no one knows what it is.

3064
01:35:11,120 --> 01:35:13,640
So no one's going, hey, what ever happened to Dogpatch?

3065
01:35:13,640 --> 01:35:16,440
Unless they're on like a Usenet group.

3066
01:35:16,440 --> 01:35:17,440
So it's like this is.

3067
01:35:17,440 --> 01:35:20,040
Alt.land.dogpatch.

3068
01:35:20,040 --> 01:35:21,640
.nu.

3069
01:35:21,640 --> 01:35:24,600
Yeah, like people aren't, no one's talking about this anymore.

3070
01:35:24,600 --> 01:35:25,560
It just went away.

3071
01:35:25,560 --> 01:35:27,040
Yeah, yeah, probably.

3072
01:35:27,040 --> 01:35:28,720
And now you've got your Facebook group.

3073
01:35:28,720 --> 01:35:32,560
No one remembers that Falbus was once president of it.

3074
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:34,960
Like it's just gone.

3075
01:35:34,960 --> 01:35:35,840
Long forever.

3076
01:35:35,840 --> 01:35:37,000
And I remember the entrance.

3077
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,160
It's literally recessed from the road.

3078
01:35:39,160 --> 01:35:43,880
So it's just the sign in that like insane leafy green canopy

3079
01:35:43,880 --> 01:35:44,920
off a random highway.

3080
01:35:44,920 --> 01:35:46,080
So like no one gives a shit.

3081
01:35:46,080 --> 01:35:49,120
And so when maybe if they took the sign down ever,

3082
01:35:49,120 --> 01:35:52,080
then there's no way to know what the hell it is.

3083
01:35:52,080 --> 01:35:55,360
I don't think they did, or maybe the one to the road they did,

3084
01:35:55,360 --> 01:35:56,960
but the big entrance sign was still there.

3085
01:35:56,960 --> 01:35:58,400
Maybe that always did.

3086
01:35:58,400 --> 01:36:00,520
So no one knew.

3087
01:36:00,520 --> 01:36:02,760
Do you remember taking, it seems like at one point

3088
01:36:02,760 --> 01:36:08,040
you had to park above the park and take a funicular down to it?

3089
01:36:08,040 --> 01:36:08,840
Whoa.

3090
01:36:08,880 --> 01:36:10,040
I don't remember that.

3091
01:36:10,040 --> 01:36:11,200
No, that's one of those.

3092
01:36:11,200 --> 01:36:12,200
I feel like I came across it.

3093
01:36:12,200 --> 01:36:13,320
Like angels fly like the...

3094
01:36:13,320 --> 01:36:14,560
Vertical or diagonal trains?

3095
01:36:14,560 --> 01:36:16,320
Yeah, the diagonal train.

3096
01:36:16,320 --> 01:36:17,520
That's incredible.

3097
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:18,480
No, I don't remember that.

3098
01:36:18,480 --> 01:36:20,160
Wild.

3099
01:36:20,160 --> 01:36:21,480
Well, and yet the internet...

3100
01:36:21,480 --> 01:36:23,240
I just remember a lot of hot landscape.

3101
01:36:23,240 --> 01:36:24,360
Like that's what I remember.

3102
01:36:24,360 --> 01:36:25,000
I believe that.

3103
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:26,680
Like hot lake.

3104
01:36:26,680 --> 01:36:27,600
I like the details.

3105
01:36:27,600 --> 01:36:28,920
Hot dirt paths.

3106
01:36:28,920 --> 01:36:31,720
The shops, like artisan crafts.

3107
01:36:31,720 --> 01:36:32,280
Hot cabins.

3108
01:36:32,280 --> 01:36:33,520
Honey, fudge.

3109
01:36:33,520 --> 01:36:37,280
Like how quickly did the fudge just dissolve in your hand?

3110
01:36:37,280 --> 01:36:38,560
I remember the food.

3111
01:36:38,560 --> 01:36:39,760
The food and the shows.

3112
01:36:39,760 --> 01:36:40,480
I don't know why that...

3113
01:36:40,480 --> 01:36:41,320
And the paddle boats.

3114
01:36:41,320 --> 01:36:42,560
You think food was good?

3115
01:36:42,560 --> 01:36:44,120
I mean, your trout was probably excellent.

3116
01:36:44,120 --> 01:36:47,080
I think it was just like trashy, like kiddie food.

3117
01:36:47,080 --> 01:36:48,000
Yeah, you know what I mean?

3118
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:48,520
Like the fudge.

3119
01:36:48,520 --> 01:36:49,400
But she was a six-year-old.

3120
01:36:49,400 --> 01:36:50,360
It sounds like a lot of fun.

3121
01:36:50,360 --> 01:36:53,160
Yeah, I mean, like probably from the age of...

3122
01:36:53,160 --> 01:36:55,160
I'm trying to remember where my grandparents moved down there,

3123
01:36:55,160 --> 01:36:58,480
but it was probably from like the age of three to six.

3124
01:36:58,480 --> 01:36:59,480
So I went there.

3125
01:36:59,480 --> 01:37:00,480
Enough.

3126
01:37:00,480 --> 01:37:01,760
That's a lot of your...

3127
01:37:01,760 --> 01:37:03,040
That's a lot of times in a...

3128
01:37:03,040 --> 01:37:07,400
Yeah, but it's also in that like last stage of infantile amnesia.

3129
01:37:07,400 --> 01:37:10,600
So like I just think it's just vast pockets are gone.

3130
01:37:10,600 --> 01:37:11,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3131
01:37:11,640 --> 01:37:12,280
But not dog.

3132
01:37:12,280 --> 01:37:14,160
Well, like dog page itself, I guess.

3133
01:37:14,160 --> 01:37:16,000
Vast pockets are...

3134
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,320
It's all slowly dissolving.

3135
01:37:18,320 --> 01:37:21,360
So in 2002, the owners are fed up.

3136
01:37:21,360 --> 01:37:22,480
We got to get rid of this place.

3137
01:37:22,480 --> 01:37:27,760
They tried to sell the land on eBay for a flat million dollars.

3138
01:37:27,760 --> 01:37:28,760
2002 eBay.

3139
01:37:28,760 --> 01:37:29,760
Early eBay.

3140
01:37:29,760 --> 01:37:31,600
Yeah, like that's incredible.

3141
01:37:31,600 --> 01:37:32,560
That's audacious.

3142
01:37:32,560 --> 01:37:34,960
That's audacious as having a trout farm and being like,

3143
01:37:34,960 --> 01:37:35,800
I'm going to turn this into a...

3144
01:37:35,960 --> 01:37:38,880
This would be a theme park way off the highway.

3145
01:37:38,880 --> 01:37:41,600
So million dollars on eBay, not a single bidder.

3146
01:37:41,600 --> 01:37:42,600
That's what we got.

3147
01:37:42,600 --> 01:37:46,560
But maybe the platform wasn't adopted.

3148
01:37:46,560 --> 01:37:47,760
People weren't adopting.

3149
01:37:47,760 --> 01:37:48,360
Like, yeah.

3150
01:37:48,360 --> 01:37:49,200
How would you know to...

3151
01:37:49,200 --> 01:37:52,240
Yeah, so search theme park highest price.

3152
01:37:52,240 --> 01:37:56,640
Do you think it'd be snatched up like within 24 hours today on eBay?

3153
01:37:56,640 --> 01:37:57,280
Well, it depends.

3154
01:37:57,280 --> 01:37:58,520
What's around that?

3155
01:37:58,520 --> 01:37:59,120
What's around...

3156
01:37:59,120 --> 01:38:00,760
Crazy stuff has gone off eBay, right?

3157
01:38:00,760 --> 01:38:01,520
Yeah, for sure.

3158
01:38:01,520 --> 01:38:03,760
But like is the land around there maybe valuable?

3159
01:38:03,760 --> 01:38:04,680
Do we know what's...

3160
01:38:04,680 --> 01:38:06,840
Is anything sprung up around Dogpatch?

3161
01:38:06,840 --> 01:38:10,360
I don't think so because they've had so much trouble selling this place.

3162
01:38:10,360 --> 01:38:11,240
Yeah, that's true.

3163
01:38:11,240 --> 01:38:12,120
So if they...

3164
01:38:12,120 --> 01:38:13,320
Like still today.

3165
01:38:13,320 --> 01:38:15,360
So yeah, I don't think any...

3166
01:38:15,360 --> 01:38:17,560
Like it's not like a target is near it now.

3167
01:38:17,560 --> 01:38:18,200
Let me just look up maybe.

3168
01:38:18,200 --> 01:38:22,320
There's a lot of new money and dark money out there.

3169
01:38:22,320 --> 01:38:23,720
I'm going to look up...

3170
01:38:23,720 --> 01:38:25,760
I'm just going to look up bland on eBay.

3171
01:38:25,760 --> 01:38:26,480
We got a target.

3172
01:38:26,480 --> 01:38:28,360
Oh yeah, can you buy just property?

3173
01:38:28,360 --> 01:38:30,000
Highest price land.

3174
01:38:30,040 --> 01:38:34,120
Now any part of Los Angeles for a million dollars goes in three seconds.

3175
01:38:34,120 --> 01:38:35,520
OK, so I'm just getting here...

3176
01:38:35,520 --> 01:38:38,840
It is funny that Mike has not gotten into land speculation yet.

3177
01:38:38,840 --> 01:38:41,680
Well, I don't know if land speculation is really interesting.

3178
01:38:41,680 --> 01:38:42,880
You have to be...

3179
01:38:42,880 --> 01:38:44,760
I'm going to miss a second.

3180
01:38:44,760 --> 01:38:45,600
I was listening.

3181
01:38:45,600 --> 01:38:46,680
Sell us, yeah, sell us.

3182
01:38:46,680 --> 01:38:48,800
But there's something really interesting about land speculation.

3183
01:38:48,800 --> 01:38:52,880
So obviously I get into doomsday spirals as we all do.

3184
01:38:52,880 --> 01:38:53,560
Oh yeah, that's what I'm doing.

3185
01:38:53,560 --> 01:38:54,960
I'm looking into buying land.

3186
01:38:54,960 --> 01:38:55,400
Oh sure.

3187
01:38:55,400 --> 01:38:56,560
I just found random land.

3188
01:38:56,680 --> 01:39:01,240
This is also like, you know, we start putting money away for my kids' college.

3189
01:39:01,240 --> 01:39:02,640
And there's just five to nine loans.

3190
01:39:02,640 --> 01:39:05,000
And I'm like, is this like the best use?

3191
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:06,240
And it's very constricted.

3192
01:39:06,240 --> 01:39:07,240
Uh-huh.

3193
01:39:07,240 --> 01:39:11,200
I was like, what if I just bought a piece of land for my kids?

3194
01:39:11,200 --> 01:39:13,480
And that'll appreciate land.

3195
01:39:13,480 --> 01:39:14,800
It may be very crucial.

3196
01:39:14,800 --> 01:39:15,920
But they will...

3197
01:39:15,920 --> 01:39:19,840
You will get screwed on land all the time by like...

3198
01:39:19,840 --> 01:39:22,800
You go, say you want to buy like a hundred acres.

3199
01:39:22,800 --> 01:39:26,440
You have to go out there and survey it because there may be no access

3200
01:39:26,440 --> 01:39:30,960
to the land. It might be a hundred acres just like in the middle of the woods.

3201
01:39:31,240 --> 01:39:34,360
And if you don't have right of way passes already guaranteed through other

3202
01:39:34,360 --> 01:39:37,600
people's land, you cannot put any road to it.

3203
01:39:37,640 --> 01:39:38,280
Right.

3204
01:39:38,280 --> 01:39:40,960
Oh, you have to ask permission to drive across the road.

3205
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:46,080
Yeah. Or you can get a hundred acres, but it's it's it's in like a line.

3206
01:39:47,240 --> 01:39:48,600
Like literally like in a line.

3207
01:39:48,600 --> 01:39:52,080
It's like a hundred acres, six hundred thousand, you know, like right in the middle

3208
01:39:52,080 --> 01:39:54,160
of upstate New York. And it's like in a line.

3209
01:39:55,120 --> 01:39:56,680
Which is super weird.

3210
01:39:56,680 --> 01:39:58,000
It's the longest driveway.

3211
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:01,880
Because of like hundreds of years of land deals, it's like this family had this

3212
01:40:01,880 --> 01:40:03,080
and this company had this.

3213
01:40:03,080 --> 01:40:06,280
And then, well, right in the middle there, there's like a hundred acres in a straight line.

3214
01:40:06,600 --> 01:40:08,160
I was looking at like plots.

3215
01:40:08,160 --> 01:40:12,480
I was looking at I was like, well, would it be cheaper to build a house in Los Angeles?

3216
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:14,320
I was like, what's this?

3217
01:40:14,320 --> 01:40:15,280
I can't imagine either.

3218
01:40:15,280 --> 01:40:18,760
But I was looking like, I wonder how much they're selling plots of land.

3219
01:40:18,760 --> 01:40:21,280
So I'm looking through like Silver Lake and there's plots.

3220
01:40:21,520 --> 01:40:24,520
But then there'd be like a plot that's just in the middle of a bunch of houses.

3221
01:40:24,520 --> 01:40:27,000
And I'm like, I bet you can't build a house on that land.

3222
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:29,080
I'm sure the permits are insane. Yeah.

3223
01:40:29,480 --> 01:40:31,280
There was a story a few years ago in L.A.

3224
01:40:31,280 --> 01:40:35,960
Someone moved a house, which used to be very common back in the day.

3225
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:39,640
They picked up a house over more towards like Hollywood, West Hollywood,

3226
01:40:39,640 --> 01:40:41,440
and moved it to Los Feliz.

3227
01:40:42,160 --> 01:40:45,040
And you just put it on a truck.

3228
01:40:45,280 --> 01:40:49,360
You just put the house on a flatbed truck and drive it at three in the morning,

3229
01:40:49,360 --> 01:40:51,600
four in the morning when there's no cars on the road.

3230
01:40:52,120 --> 01:40:54,080
And then you just put it down.

3231
01:40:54,800 --> 01:40:58,520
Sounds easy enough that like for now, it in 2019.

3232
01:40:58,520 --> 01:41:01,320
That's like an oddly enough like, you know, what do they do with like

3233
01:41:01,320 --> 01:41:03,200
the foundation or something like, how do you get it?

3234
01:41:03,200 --> 01:41:04,960
I think you get it off the foundation.

3235
01:41:04,960 --> 01:41:07,880
You lay a new one and then you lay the new one.

3236
01:41:07,880 --> 01:41:09,600
You see, it's an easy thing.

3237
01:41:09,600 --> 01:41:10,440
Like, you will get it.

3238
01:41:10,440 --> 01:41:13,400
Yeah, I'll just say there's a ton of land on eBay.

3239
01:41:13,480 --> 01:41:17,000
Really? Oh, I heard results from Arkansas.

3240
01:41:17,320 --> 01:41:17,680
All right.

3241
01:41:17,920 --> 01:41:19,720
Arkansas land. You're going to get it.

3242
01:41:19,720 --> 01:41:22,080
You're going to get dog patch dog patch might be on there.

3243
01:41:22,080 --> 01:41:22,880
Maybe. Yeah.

3244
01:41:22,880 --> 01:41:25,480
What if it just went up like an hour ago?

3245
01:41:25,480 --> 01:41:26,720
It's a new Zillow listing.

3246
01:41:26,720 --> 01:41:27,640
The twist ending.

3247
01:41:27,640 --> 01:41:30,640
We bought dog patch during the dog patch episode.

3248
01:41:31,520 --> 01:41:33,120
We had it this entire time.

3249
01:41:33,120 --> 01:41:38,000
Building a building lot in Arkansas, Cherokee Village open to trade, it says,

3250
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,800
but it's listed at eighteen thousand nine hundred ninety nine dollars.

3251
01:41:41,560 --> 01:41:44,200
But they will accept the best offer.

3252
01:41:44,200 --> 01:41:46,520
Can we use a coin from the world of Zalem

3253
01:41:46,520 --> 01:41:49,000
from the Alita Battle Angel?

3254
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:50,640
Is that a good trade?

3255
01:41:50,640 --> 01:41:52,040
I will make that request.

3256
01:41:52,040 --> 01:41:53,960
I will. Something we want in a game.

3257
01:41:53,960 --> 01:41:56,560
Let's see what the cheapest Arkansas land we could buy.

3258
01:41:56,560 --> 01:41:58,680
I was like, what? Yeah, it's a movie.

3259
01:41:58,680 --> 01:42:00,920
Well, we can just bid on

3260
01:42:01,560 --> 01:42:04,960
point one six three acres in Arkansas.

3261
01:42:04,960 --> 01:42:07,040
And the bid is at a dollar thirty right now.

3262
01:42:07,040 --> 01:42:08,560
One six three acres.

3263
01:42:08,560 --> 01:42:11,400
Yeah. So that's probably I'm trying to think about.

3264
01:42:11,800 --> 01:42:12,880
I'm going to figure out how many square feet.

3265
01:42:12,880 --> 01:42:14,800
I don't know. Yeah.

3266
01:42:14,840 --> 01:42:17,040
Wow. Secluded point to three.

3267
01:42:17,040 --> 01:42:18,600
But I just do the math.

3268
01:42:18,600 --> 01:42:21,360
It's it's five times bigger than any home.

3269
01:42:21,360 --> 01:42:23,880
Any of us will. Oh, point.

3270
01:42:23,880 --> 01:42:27,880
Fifteen acres in Little Rock is thirty seven dollars up to right now.

3271
01:42:29,320 --> 01:42:33,640
There's wow golf course lot for sale in Fairfield Bay.

3272
01:42:33,760 --> 01:42:36,040
Up to two hundred dollars.

3273
01:42:36,040 --> 01:42:41,360
Wow. Why are we bothering with a podcast when the real money is Arkansas

3274
01:42:41,360 --> 01:42:42,240
span of land?

3275
01:42:42,280 --> 01:42:44,120
Real estate.

3276
01:42:44,120 --> 01:42:47,440
This is this is how an episode of justify starts.

3277
01:42:47,440 --> 01:42:50,760
And then Raylin given that has to avenge us.

3278
01:42:51,200 --> 01:42:53,320
Seventy one hundred square feet.

3279
01:42:53,320 --> 01:42:55,800
Well, that's a very, very, very, very, very large.

3280
01:42:55,800 --> 01:42:56,800
That's a ton. Yeah.

3281
01:42:56,800 --> 01:42:58,720
Yeah. And that's a very big house.

3282
01:42:58,720 --> 01:43:00,240
That's probably like an eight bedroom.

3283
01:43:00,240 --> 01:43:02,280
Should I buy it for thirteen dollars?

3284
01:43:02,280 --> 01:43:05,480
You know, by the way, you should point on the episode.

3285
01:43:05,920 --> 01:43:08,240
But you're going to need to read some land access.

3286
01:43:08,240 --> 01:43:09,120
You got to have road access.

3287
01:43:09,120 --> 01:43:10,120
Feels like a scheme.

3288
01:43:10,120 --> 01:43:14,160
Papi Yocum would get into that lay about these L.A.

3289
01:43:14,400 --> 01:43:15,200
These L.A.

3290
01:43:15,200 --> 01:43:17,680
idiots, they're all they're doing podcasts all the time.

3291
01:43:17,680 --> 01:43:19,200
They won't even read the fine print.

3292
01:43:19,200 --> 01:43:20,360
They'll just buy a land.

3293
01:43:20,360 --> 01:43:21,480
Yeah, you won't give it to you.

3294
01:43:23,160 --> 01:43:24,160
With a catch.

3295
01:43:26,080 --> 01:43:28,880
It's so you dig like an inch in and it's nothing but snakes.

3296
01:43:30,360 --> 01:43:32,320
Pure limestone.

3297
01:43:32,320 --> 01:43:33,520
You fly down to see it.

3298
01:43:33,520 --> 01:43:36,640
You're immediately arrested because they think podcast is a type of

3299
01:43:36,640 --> 01:43:38,880
unbuildable, unbuildable land.

3300
01:43:39,480 --> 01:43:41,560
Thirty seven dollars.

3301
01:43:41,560 --> 01:43:44,480
I don't know. You guys are going to be really embarrassed.

3302
01:43:44,480 --> 01:43:46,560
I'm a land fair in Arkansas.

3303
01:43:46,560 --> 01:43:48,880
I'm just saying, don't do it while we're recording.

3304
01:43:48,880 --> 01:43:50,640
There might be one thing you need to read.

3305
01:43:50,640 --> 01:43:54,080
I just bought three, three, three lots.

3306
01:43:54,080 --> 01:43:55,480
Do a quantity. Yeah.

3307
01:43:55,480 --> 01:43:58,560
It's somehow a sinkhole, but also combustible.

3308
01:43:59,160 --> 01:44:02,600
It's all that also explodes full of dangerous gas.

3309
01:44:03,120 --> 01:44:05,960
But why go to all that trouble

3310
01:44:05,960 --> 01:44:09,400
when there's a much easier way to get a bunch of land in Arkansas?

3311
01:44:09,400 --> 01:44:12,400
And I think we all know upon this story.

3312
01:44:12,640 --> 01:44:14,480
So I think you did too.

3313
01:44:14,480 --> 01:44:19,840
So in in 2005, 17 year old Pruitt Nance

3314
01:44:20,240 --> 01:44:23,680
was driving an ATV through the former dog patch property.

3315
01:44:23,960 --> 01:44:27,040
Nance said he had permission from the owners to tour the property.

3316
01:44:27,040 --> 01:44:28,960
So he's driving his ATV around.

3317
01:44:28,960 --> 01:44:33,680
And then he collides neck first with a length of tight wire

3318
01:44:33,680 --> 01:44:35,720
strung between two trees.

3319
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,200
And he is nearly decapitated.

3320
01:44:38,200 --> 01:44:40,120
How the hell and he lived.

3321
01:44:40,120 --> 01:44:41,160
He lived.

3322
01:44:41,160 --> 01:44:44,120
How the hell do you live through near decapitation?

3323
01:44:44,120 --> 01:44:48,760
It's why is it seems like the one that's like I was scrolling like he's alive.

3324
01:44:48,760 --> 01:44:49,560
Is he alive?

3325
01:44:49,560 --> 01:44:51,240
Like, but then it was like medical damages.

3326
01:44:51,240 --> 01:44:53,160
And I was like, that sounds like he's alive.

3327
01:44:53,160 --> 01:44:53,920
Mm hmm.

3328
01:44:53,920 --> 01:44:55,600
I don't like they just put

3329
01:44:55,600 --> 01:44:59,560
Ronda Rousey almost lost her finger shooting Fox's 9-1-1.

3330
01:44:59,640 --> 01:45:01,520
And like it was like severed.

3331
01:45:01,520 --> 01:45:04,240
So the idea that like your head is half and like that's like,

3332
01:45:04,240 --> 01:45:07,920
I don't know how much neck can you lose?

3333
01:45:07,960 --> 01:45:08,680
That's my question.

3334
01:45:08,680 --> 01:45:12,680
Yeah, it's like it's going through like it's it's stopping at the at the spine.

3335
01:45:12,680 --> 01:45:14,520
Yeah, right. Probably right.

3336
01:45:14,520 --> 01:45:15,680
I guess so.

3337
01:45:15,680 --> 01:45:19,240
Or the wind block like bouncing back a little bit like why

3338
01:45:19,240 --> 01:45:21,640
like you can't call it decapitation if it stops at the windpipe.

3339
01:45:22,120 --> 01:45:23,640
Yeah, it's the legal definition.

3340
01:45:23,640 --> 01:45:26,120
Sorry, quit not to derail this quick question.

3341
01:45:26,320 --> 01:45:30,680
What is going on on the set of Fox's 9-1-1 that their stunt

3342
01:45:30,680 --> 01:45:33,840
casting choice gets her fingers sliced off?

3343
01:45:34,080 --> 01:45:39,200
The biggest guest star coup is almost she caught her hand in like a door of a boat.

3344
01:45:39,880 --> 01:45:43,200
Do you know that's how Neil Armstrong lost a finger?

3345
01:45:43,200 --> 01:45:45,840
He caught his pinky ring in the tailgate of a truck

3346
01:45:45,920 --> 01:45:48,880
as he was jumping out the back and it ripped it off.

3347
01:45:49,440 --> 01:45:51,760
Oh, man. Moon landing or post?

3348
01:45:51,760 --> 01:45:53,520
I think post. Yes, definitely post.

3349
01:45:53,520 --> 01:45:57,440
And Jimmy Fallon caught his ring finger on the corner of his counter

3350
01:45:57,440 --> 01:46:01,080
and almost lost his finger and he was ripped the finger off completely.

3351
01:46:01,080 --> 01:46:04,040
And then almost the same thing happened like a month later.

3352
01:46:04,040 --> 01:46:05,640
But anyway, he's fine.

3353
01:46:05,640 --> 01:46:08,400
And his rule is tonight show host is totally things.

3354
01:46:08,400 --> 01:46:10,240
Fine. Everything's fine.

3355
01:46:11,240 --> 01:46:13,560
Everything's normal, folks.

3356
01:46:13,560 --> 01:46:15,160
We're all having a regular one.

3357
01:46:15,160 --> 01:46:19,000
So so everybody be careful with your fingers and your necks.

3358
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:20,320
This man lived anyway.

3359
01:46:20,320 --> 01:46:23,360
So Nance, so Nance, old Nance.

3360
01:46:23,600 --> 01:46:24,920
I don't know how it played out.

3361
01:46:24,920 --> 01:46:28,200
And I don't think I want to see any pictures or no further information.

3362
01:46:28,200 --> 01:46:30,280
But here's what we do know.

3363
01:46:30,280 --> 01:46:32,280
I was looking at this case.

3364
01:46:32,720 --> 01:46:34,520
I strung the wire up.

3365
01:46:34,520 --> 01:46:35,920
This I want to see there.

3366
01:46:35,920 --> 01:46:40,840
And I saw comments essentially saying like, like, oh, this this place can pretend

3367
01:46:40,840 --> 01:46:42,360
that's not what they were trying to do.

3368
01:46:42,360 --> 01:46:43,720
But like I'm from Arkansas.

3369
01:46:43,720 --> 01:46:45,720
I know if you don't want people missing with your property,

3370
01:46:45,720 --> 01:46:47,400
you put up a bunch of wires. Right.

3371
01:46:47,400 --> 01:46:49,720
So I think they were intended to try to.

3372
01:46:49,760 --> 01:46:52,960
Yeah, I was also thinking that near decapitation

3373
01:46:52,960 --> 01:46:55,600
could have been language in the lawsuit.

3374
01:46:55,600 --> 01:46:56,640
Yeah. Yeah.

3375
01:46:56,640 --> 01:46:59,000
And he was nearly decapitated.

3376
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:02,280
Right. Which means like probably he could have been decapitated.

3377
01:47:02,640 --> 01:47:05,280
He probably had a severing of an artery or something bad.

3378
01:47:05,280 --> 01:47:07,720
It could have like broken through the front of it.

3379
01:47:07,720 --> 01:47:10,360
It hit him. He's bleeding real bad injury.

3380
01:47:10,360 --> 01:47:14,040
But being like if he had been traveling five more miles an hour.

3381
01:47:14,040 --> 01:47:15,040
Right. Right. Yeah.

3382
01:47:15,040 --> 01:47:18,400
Yeah. Maybe that's a medical legal classification.

3383
01:47:18,400 --> 01:47:22,040
Like a lot of Indiana Jones minecar kind of stuff.

3384
01:47:22,040 --> 01:47:24,240
Like if he hadn't ducked right then, right.

3385
01:47:24,240 --> 01:47:28,120
He was nearly he could write the temple.

3386
01:47:29,320 --> 01:47:31,680
Indiana Jones versus the Temple of Doom.

3387
01:47:31,680 --> 01:47:33,080
It's just legal proceedings.

3388
01:47:33,080 --> 01:47:35,480
Temple Henry Jones, Jr. V.

3389
01:47:35,720 --> 01:47:38,240
The temple and caught palace.

3390
01:47:38,440 --> 01:47:41,320
We call to the stand short.

3391
01:47:45,080 --> 01:47:49,720
So the goes this case goes all the way up to the Arkansas Supreme Court.

3392
01:47:50,400 --> 01:47:54,400
He is awarded six hundred fifty thousand dollars in damages.

3393
01:47:55,360 --> 01:48:02,040
And because the owners can't pay this in full, instead, they give him the land.

3394
01:48:02,040 --> 01:48:03,600
They just give him the deed, right?

3395
01:48:03,600 --> 01:48:05,080
He gets the deed.

3396
01:48:05,080 --> 01:48:09,440
You try you almost get decapitated on dog patch and then now you own dog.

3397
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:11,720
It's that easy, folks.

3398
01:48:11,720 --> 01:48:13,000
So that's what you do.

3399
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:15,800
Go try to set up a decapitation scheme.

3400
01:48:17,160 --> 01:48:18,240
You don't have to pay for it.

3401
01:48:18,240 --> 01:48:21,160
Try to wire yourself, but don't forget to pay the thirty seven dollars.

3402
01:48:21,160 --> 01:48:22,560
Yeah. Yeah.

3403
01:48:22,560 --> 01:48:24,840
Yeah. Please save the thirty seven dollars.

3404
01:48:26,040 --> 01:48:27,840
Just go to the Arkansas Supreme Court.

3405
01:48:27,840 --> 01:48:28,960
That's what I'll do instead.

3406
01:48:28,960 --> 01:48:30,920
I'm doing the Supreme Court.

3407
01:48:30,920 --> 01:48:36,640
Rig up wire, a length of wire like it's a level from the game Hitman.

3408
01:48:36,680 --> 01:48:39,240
It's a mission in Hitman where you have to rig up.

3409
01:48:39,560 --> 01:48:40,920
Give me his name again. What's the kid's name?

3410
01:48:40,920 --> 01:48:43,080
The kid's name is Pruitt Nance.

3411
01:48:43,080 --> 01:48:45,400
And that is a PRUETT.

3412
01:48:45,480 --> 01:48:49,080
They were supposed to get hundreds of thousands of dollars

3413
01:48:49,280 --> 01:48:51,360
that was just never paid to them.

3414
01:48:51,360 --> 01:48:54,240
Instead, they just gave him the land.

3415
01:48:54,240 --> 01:48:55,960
So he owns the land now.

3416
01:48:55,960 --> 01:48:57,160
No, not anymore.

3417
01:48:57,160 --> 01:48:58,520
Not anymore. For a while.

3418
01:48:58,520 --> 01:48:59,440
And I missed the last one.

3419
01:48:59,440 --> 01:49:03,520
I find no there's no information I can find about what happened

3420
01:49:03,800 --> 01:49:06,440
when the 17 year old owned the land. Did it turn into it?

3421
01:49:06,440 --> 01:49:07,880
Was it a blank check S.

3422
01:49:07,880 --> 01:49:09,440
Crump? I don't know.

3423
01:49:09,440 --> 01:49:12,520
Was it as fun as Bart owning the factory in the Simpsons?

3424
01:49:12,720 --> 01:49:14,080
So you're 17 in what year?

3425
01:49:14,120 --> 01:49:16,040
That was just 2005.

3426
01:49:16,040 --> 01:49:17,880
2005. Yeah, there's a picture of him.

3427
01:49:17,880 --> 01:49:20,960
He's fine. He just has like a wicked kind of cool scar.

3428
01:49:21,440 --> 01:49:23,080
And he's actually like a handsome looking kid.

3429
01:49:23,080 --> 01:49:24,080
Look at it.

3430
01:49:24,520 --> 01:49:26,160
Hey, yeah. He just has like kind of a cool.

3431
01:49:26,160 --> 01:49:27,840
It almost looks like a tattoo.

3432
01:49:27,840 --> 01:49:28,680
Definitely hit the neck.

3433
01:49:28,680 --> 01:49:31,320
Yeah, he's got like a kind of badass scar.

3434
01:49:31,600 --> 01:49:32,600
It's kind of cool.

3435
01:49:32,600 --> 01:49:34,600
Yeah, it almost looks like a birthmark.

3436
01:49:34,600 --> 01:49:35,520
And he's wearing sunglasses.

3437
01:49:35,520 --> 01:49:36,920
Like he's like kind of a hip dude.

3438
01:49:36,920 --> 01:49:38,240
I think he's on Twitter.

3439
01:49:38,240 --> 01:49:40,960
Pruitt rules. Pruitt Nance, the fancy prance.

3440
01:49:41,320 --> 01:49:42,400
He's on Twitter, guys.

3441
01:49:42,400 --> 01:49:43,880
What? Yeah, he's on Twitter.

3442
01:49:43,880 --> 01:49:46,520
He describes himself as the fancy prance.

3443
01:49:46,520 --> 01:49:48,280
At the fancy prance. Oh, my God.

3444
01:49:48,280 --> 01:49:49,480
All right. I'm following him up.

3445
01:49:49,480 --> 01:49:51,680
OK, here is don't spend your life looking for a place called home.

3446
01:49:52,080 --> 01:49:54,000
Make your skeleton the only structure you need.

3447
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,480
That's his bio. Bio.

3448
01:49:56,640 --> 01:49:57,440
Oh, my God.

3449
01:49:57,440 --> 01:49:59,480
Pruitt Nance. He only has 130 followers.

3450
01:49:59,480 --> 01:50:00,800
Everybody follow Pruitt Nance.

3451
01:50:00,800 --> 01:50:03,960
You will notice when everyone affiliated with a podcast

3452
01:50:03,960 --> 01:50:05,920
and the creator of a television series.

3453
01:50:06,640 --> 01:50:07,880
He's going to hear this and be like, please.

3454
01:50:07,880 --> 01:50:10,800
You guys were incredibly disrespectful of my injury.

3455
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:13,040
No, I mean, like I'm glad he's alive and he looks,

3456
01:50:13,720 --> 01:50:16,600
I mean, from social media and the Internet, he looks very happy and like

3457
01:50:17,120 --> 01:50:19,160
kind of a cool kid guy.

3458
01:50:19,160 --> 01:50:21,000
He has a cool hairstyle.

3459
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:22,800
I like this. I like this dude.

3460
01:50:22,800 --> 01:50:23,800
I'm a fan of his.

3461
01:50:23,800 --> 01:50:26,160
He's got like a jokey kind of Twitter that seems kind of fun.

3462
01:50:26,160 --> 01:50:27,280
Yeah, I know. I like his hand.

3463
01:50:27,280 --> 01:50:28,960
Nothing offensive so far.

3464
01:50:28,960 --> 01:50:31,560
Hell, yeah. Well, I hope he has some fun.

3465
01:50:31,880 --> 01:50:32,680
Yeah, he's here.

3466
01:50:32,680 --> 01:50:34,720
2 15 17. Be grateful.

3467
01:50:34,720 --> 01:50:38,000
So tweet he had. Hey, he's putting nice things

3468
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:39,840
out in the world on Twitter.

3469
01:50:39,840 --> 01:50:42,440
Yeah, he's not getting into the poisonous atmosphere.

3470
01:50:42,440 --> 01:50:45,960
He's on another Instagram company was trying to put some nice things

3471
01:50:45,960 --> 01:50:47,360
into the world.

3472
01:50:48,280 --> 01:50:50,840
I don't know where the first thing that came up was USA.

3473
01:50:52,240 --> 01:50:55,200
So the first thing that came up when I searched him was car LLC V

3474
01:50:55,840 --> 01:50:58,160
Prance, the lawsuit. Oh, right.

3475
01:50:58,720 --> 01:51:00,240
Oh, OK. I see. OK.

3476
01:51:01,800 --> 01:51:07,280
OK, so then then we end up with the caves are owned by somebody named Steve Rush.

3477
01:51:07,320 --> 01:51:10,240
He tries to sell just the caves on eBay and fails.

3478
01:51:10,600 --> 01:51:13,840
So multiple eBay sales caves are cool, though, I will say.

3479
01:51:13,840 --> 01:51:15,200
I just went to a cave.

3480
01:51:15,200 --> 01:51:17,440
Can I? Can you find a cave?

3481
01:51:17,440 --> 01:51:20,400
I went to the space cavern in Austin or in Georgetown.

3482
01:51:20,680 --> 01:51:21,760
And it was awesome.

3483
01:51:21,760 --> 01:51:26,360
Well, yeah, I bet we went deep down in there and then they turned the lights off.

3484
01:51:26,360 --> 01:51:28,560
They're like, and now we're going to turn the lights off and you can't.

3485
01:51:28,560 --> 01:51:32,120
And then and then the tour guide, for some reason, even though we had kids

3486
01:51:32,480 --> 01:51:36,640
in the tour said, do you know those boys that were trapped in that cave for so long?

3487
01:51:36,680 --> 01:51:39,000
This is what they saw for 16 days.

3488
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:43,560
And I was like, OK, thank you for telling my six year old son that.

3489
01:51:44,560 --> 01:51:47,880
Oh, my God. He's just here to see the stalagmites and the stalactites.

3490
01:51:48,360 --> 01:51:49,880
But thanks.

3491
01:51:49,880 --> 01:51:50,640
Good to know.

3492
01:51:50,640 --> 01:51:53,360
I get it. They saw this pure darkness for 16 days.

3493
01:51:53,360 --> 01:51:54,800
Oh, my God. OK.

3494
01:51:54,800 --> 01:51:56,560
Right. So cool. Thanks.

3495
01:51:56,560 --> 01:51:58,600
We go get lunch at Panera now.

3496
01:52:00,800 --> 01:52:02,560
There's a gift store on the way out.

3497
01:52:02,560 --> 01:52:04,560
And he gives all the license plates.

3498
01:52:04,560 --> 01:52:07,080
No, there's like a man cave you can buy.

3499
01:52:07,400 --> 01:52:10,520
Oh, for that man cave.

3500
01:52:10,520 --> 01:52:11,560
It's one man cave.

3501
01:52:11,560 --> 01:52:15,240
You can buy like they call it mobile office, tiny home.

3502
01:52:15,240 --> 01:52:19,400
She like the man cave or she shed.

3503
01:52:19,680 --> 01:52:21,960
Oh, the she shed. Yeah. Yeah.

3504
01:52:21,960 --> 01:52:23,280
Well, it's a commercial.

3505
01:52:23,280 --> 01:52:25,160
Yeah. She for sale. One man cave.

3506
01:52:25,160 --> 01:52:27,800
I've never worn she shed.

3507
01:52:27,800 --> 01:52:29,880
It looks like the thing that the

3508
01:52:29,880 --> 01:52:33,920
if the last season of Better Call Saul, they have the guys building the meth lab.

3509
01:52:34,640 --> 01:52:36,760
Oh, yeah. That little indoor hang zone.

3510
01:52:36,760 --> 01:52:38,000
Yeah. Uh huh.

3511
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,680
But no, like fun theme park caves. Yeah.

3512
01:52:41,840 --> 01:52:44,400
I could see having a little fun at that place.

3513
01:52:44,600 --> 01:52:47,120
Yeah. Maybe not months and months. No.

3514
01:52:48,360 --> 01:52:51,440
OK. So I got to sell it on eBay.

3515
01:52:52,040 --> 01:52:55,280
Then in 2014, the park was sold again,

3516
01:52:55,680 --> 01:52:59,680
this time to a guy named Bud Pelzor, who invented the Buddy Bowl,

3517
01:52:59,680 --> 01:53:02,200
a spill proof dog bowl.

3518
01:53:02,240 --> 01:53:05,560
And there are videos on YouTube where he teaches you

3519
01:53:05,560 --> 01:53:09,320
how to make ice cream treats out of his dog dishes.

3520
01:53:10,120 --> 01:53:11,200
Wait, what?

3521
01:53:11,200 --> 01:53:15,600
Like he mixes up like ice cream floats in the dog dish because it doesn't spill.

3522
01:53:15,600 --> 01:53:16,320
It should. Yeah.

3523
01:53:16,320 --> 01:53:19,720
He should just does he have a whole line of spill proof bowls?

3524
01:53:19,720 --> 01:53:22,280
Or is it only the dog stuff? Yeah.

3525
01:53:22,280 --> 01:53:23,880
How the hell is that possible?

3526
01:53:23,880 --> 01:53:25,720
He's got the technology.

3527
01:53:25,720 --> 01:53:27,760
Think big like the trout guy.

3528
01:53:27,760 --> 01:53:29,120
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

3529
01:53:29,120 --> 01:53:30,760
Spread it out. This is other lines.

3530
01:53:30,760 --> 01:53:31,880
Yeah. Unspillable.

3531
01:53:31,880 --> 01:53:35,160
This is why Shark Tank would not invest because

3532
01:53:36,600 --> 01:53:37,880
it's a very niche market.

3533
01:53:37,880 --> 01:53:42,920
So he's like, if you don't have a dog, buy this bowl and you can make ice cream in it.

3534
01:53:43,400 --> 01:53:45,600
Your own dog. I'm buying one.

3535
01:53:45,600 --> 01:53:46,520
This is a product.

3536
01:53:46,520 --> 01:53:49,440
This is a product for everyone, not just dog owners.

3537
01:53:49,440 --> 01:53:52,360
You can be a single childless,

3538
01:53:52,360 --> 01:53:55,840
petless person and still enjoy the Buddy Bowl.

3539
01:53:55,920 --> 01:53:58,960
Dual income, no kids.

3540
01:53:58,960 --> 01:54:01,920
Unspillable dog bowl, ice cream.

3541
01:54:02,960 --> 01:54:04,680
This is a good date night.

3542
01:54:04,680 --> 01:54:06,760
Kind of brighten up your yeah, your honey.

3543
01:54:06,760 --> 01:54:08,600
Can you still buy an ice cream?

3544
01:54:08,600 --> 01:54:11,520
So you're giving your wife the dog bowl and then being like and being like, no,

3545
01:54:11,520 --> 01:54:13,200
but this is for ice cream.

3546
01:54:13,200 --> 01:54:14,560
It's for us. Don't get upset.

3547
01:54:14,560 --> 01:54:15,760
No, no, this is for us.

3548
01:54:15,760 --> 01:54:16,720
No, it's not.

3549
01:54:16,720 --> 01:54:18,880
And that's not the dog bowl for your birthday.

3550
01:54:18,880 --> 01:54:20,640
Well, it's not difficult to navigate.

3551
01:54:20,640 --> 01:54:22,560
So it's a really thoughtful gift.

3552
01:54:23,440 --> 01:54:25,040
You're going to love it.

3553
01:54:25,040 --> 01:54:26,160
Should I describe your name on it?

3554
01:54:26,160 --> 01:54:27,280
Would that make you like it more?

3555
01:54:27,280 --> 01:54:31,080
You use it once and then it goes in the top shelf of the cabinet

3556
01:54:31,400 --> 01:54:32,920
and is thrown away when you die.

3557
01:54:32,920 --> 01:54:35,760
Yeah. And it's still like the

3558
01:54:35,760 --> 01:54:38,960
the extra NutriBullet.

3559
01:54:38,960 --> 01:54:40,240
Oh, yeah. The second the wedding.

3560
01:54:40,240 --> 01:54:42,880
The one that you got in the parents take that back.

3561
01:54:44,240 --> 01:54:45,000
It's still in the box.

3562
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:46,000
All right.

3563
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:48,040
You can get land on eBay.

3564
01:54:48,040 --> 01:54:49,640
Put a NutriBullet on it.

3565
01:54:49,640 --> 01:54:52,600
There's a dog on the front of the bowl who's like

3566
01:54:53,240 --> 01:54:56,600
like showcasing the logo with his paw here.

3567
01:54:56,600 --> 01:54:57,920
That's pretty good.

3568
01:54:58,920 --> 01:55:00,120
Check it out.

3569
01:55:00,120 --> 01:55:02,200
Look, dogs can't point.

3570
01:55:02,200 --> 01:55:04,800
Yeah, that's not correct.

3571
01:55:04,800 --> 01:55:07,400
OK, so now to get to this,

3572
01:55:08,400 --> 01:55:10,360
I'll try to keep this quick because we've been going for a while.

3573
01:55:10,360 --> 01:55:13,280
But now let me ask, let me ask a bigger question.

3574
01:55:13,280 --> 01:55:18,560
Who was the the most problematic person never to run dog patch USA?

3575
01:55:19,040 --> 01:55:20,840
Was it the racist governor?

3576
01:55:20,840 --> 01:55:23,400
Was it the man who eats dessert out of dog bowls?

3577
01:55:23,880 --> 01:55:26,880
Was it the multiple people who tried and failed to sell it on eBay?

3578
01:55:27,160 --> 01:55:29,520
Was it the nearly decapitated 17 year old?

3579
01:55:29,520 --> 01:55:30,840
It was not him. Right. It wasn't.

3580
01:55:30,840 --> 01:55:32,960
And he fucking probably should have had.

3581
01:55:32,960 --> 01:55:34,600
You should have kept it. Yeah, I know.

3582
01:55:34,600 --> 01:55:37,240
I think it'd be a cooler place. Although I get selling it.

3583
01:55:38,440 --> 01:55:39,480
What am I going to do with this?

3584
01:55:39,480 --> 01:55:42,840
Seventeen hundred acres of rust.

3585
01:55:42,840 --> 01:55:45,880
Yeah, we're nearly decapitated where people keep cash.

3586
01:55:46,800 --> 01:55:51,600
People keep breaking in and stealing like little like shards of glass from it.

3587
01:55:51,600 --> 01:55:52,680
Yeah, that's right.

3588
01:55:52,680 --> 01:55:55,920
Spray painted probably with horrible things and just like, thanks so much.

3589
01:55:55,920 --> 01:55:56,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3590
01:55:56,920 --> 01:55:59,720
He doesn't. There's a real dickheaded thing to do, actually, to think about it,

3591
01:55:59,720 --> 01:56:01,920
where it's like we almost killed this kid and we're going to give him

3592
01:56:02,520 --> 01:56:05,440
that we're going to offload this awful albatross.

3593
01:56:06,360 --> 01:56:08,680
Oh, but your own property.

3594
01:56:09,560 --> 01:56:10,600
Terrible land.

3595
01:56:10,600 --> 01:56:12,680
Stared mortality in the eye.

3596
01:56:13,680 --> 01:56:16,560
You could have that place where you almost died forever.

3597
01:56:17,040 --> 01:56:18,040
Thanks.

3598
01:56:18,040 --> 01:56:20,200
You should actually get him.

3599
01:56:20,240 --> 01:56:22,440
You should get him on the podcast.

3600
01:56:22,440 --> 01:56:24,000
Yeah, I'm sure maybe you would do it.

3601
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:25,240
Maybe you don't want to talk about it.

3602
01:56:25,240 --> 01:56:27,800
Yeah, we like to be like, we really called him out.

3603
01:56:28,280 --> 01:56:29,440
I feel like we really called him out.

3604
01:56:29,440 --> 01:56:30,840
Yeah, we love you and we're glad you're alive.

3605
01:56:30,840 --> 01:56:33,160
I know. Yeah, he's awesome.

3606
01:56:33,960 --> 01:56:35,080
Clearly. Yeah. But you're dead.

3607
01:56:35,080 --> 01:56:37,400
Do you want 20 rusted out sheds?

3608
01:56:37,400 --> 01:56:39,120
No, I'm sure you give me the cash.

3609
01:56:39,120 --> 01:56:44,000
So after all that, the answer to who was the worst donor is none of the above,

3610
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:47,400
because, well, technically, the land was leased

3611
01:56:47,800 --> 01:56:50,320
by an entity called Heritage USA.

3612
01:56:51,400 --> 01:56:55,360
Heritage USA makes us, oh, John Binkowski, the owner of Hard Rock Park.

3613
01:56:55,360 --> 01:56:57,560
Many, many rounds of apology.

3614
01:56:58,240 --> 01:57:01,600
Heritage USA. So in 2017, they lease the land and they take it over.

3615
01:57:01,600 --> 01:57:04,520
Now, if that land, if that name sounds familiar to you, Heritage USA,

3616
01:57:04,800 --> 01:57:07,760
if you if you know weird theme park bullshit, you might be thinking, wait a minute.

3617
01:57:07,960 --> 01:57:12,440
You mean Jim Baker's weird religious theme park that was open in the 80s

3618
01:57:12,680 --> 01:57:15,040
where he did live TV and broadcast from?

3619
01:57:15,320 --> 01:57:17,200
No, no, no. Different company.

3620
01:57:17,200 --> 01:57:21,440
Unrelated. Seemingly just took the name without permission,

3621
01:57:21,440 --> 01:57:24,520
just like wanted to make that association.

3622
01:57:24,520 --> 01:57:30,120
And why don't I let a video describe what

3623
01:57:31,280 --> 01:57:34,200
Heritage USA is all about?

3624
01:57:34,200 --> 01:57:36,840
Wait, do I have the right one? Here we go.

3625
01:57:36,840 --> 01:57:39,920
Let's let Heritage USA explain itself.

3626
01:57:40,920 --> 01:57:46,440
Heritage USA is a dynamic family entertainment,

3627
01:57:46,720 --> 01:57:50,320
multimedia resorts and property development company

3628
01:57:50,720 --> 01:57:53,400
whose focus is on celebrating America.

3629
01:57:53,880 --> 01:57:58,160
Our mission is truth, the truth of American exceptionalism

3630
01:57:58,600 --> 01:58:04,240
and the truth that has enabled us to face our challenges and rise above adversity.

3631
01:58:04,680 --> 01:58:07,480
This is over some of the worst graphics you ever seen,

3632
01:58:07,480 --> 01:58:10,520
one of the worst fonts you're seeing, then just random footage of jets.

3633
01:58:11,200 --> 01:58:12,400
It has nothing to do with what they've done.

3634
01:58:12,400 --> 01:58:15,040
And I also think the guy's voice sounds pitch shifted even lower.

3635
01:58:15,040 --> 01:58:17,240
It's like if you took Sam Elliott and cranked it down.

3636
01:58:17,240 --> 01:58:21,240
Put five hundred thousand dollars in a duffel bag, leave it in the vestibule.

3637
01:58:23,160 --> 01:58:24,240
Your daughter is fine.

3638
01:58:24,240 --> 01:58:26,520
Your daughter is fine. You'll see her soon.

3639
01:58:26,520 --> 01:58:28,840
She's a low shot of the best. She's an American.

3640
01:58:28,840 --> 01:58:31,440
She's an American. She's resilient. She's exceptional.

3641
01:58:32,280 --> 01:58:36,040
The way to ingratiate yourself to a community and this beloved land

3642
01:58:36,040 --> 01:58:39,680
that people are fond of is to sound as much like a kidnapper as possible.

3643
01:58:40,640 --> 01:58:44,400
So and now we've learned that this is this entity

3644
01:58:44,400 --> 01:58:47,680
that's taking over old dogpatch is about American exceptionalism.

3645
01:58:48,560 --> 01:58:51,160
There's a bio that goes on and on and on.

3646
01:58:52,280 --> 01:58:56,080
So concerned about the desecration of American historical sites

3647
01:58:56,080 --> 01:59:00,320
and the rise of anti-American sentiment within America's entertainment culture.

3648
01:59:00,600 --> 01:59:02,560
Oh, yeah. All the Hollywood elite.

3649
01:59:02,600 --> 01:59:03,640
Here we go.

3650
01:59:03,640 --> 01:59:06,800
Guys in this room, a team of hundreds of writers,

3651
01:59:06,800 --> 01:59:10,040
directors, producers, musicians, animators, imagineers.

3652
01:59:10,040 --> 01:59:11,880
They just took the one other term. You can't do that.

3653
01:59:11,880 --> 01:59:12,880
Yeah, that's known.

3654
01:59:12,880 --> 01:59:14,640
That's they uncapitalized it.

3655
01:59:14,640 --> 01:59:16,280
That doesn't make it a copyright.

3656
01:59:16,280 --> 01:59:20,520
And business professionals with over 40 years experience altogether.

3657
01:59:20,520 --> 01:59:23,280
40 years, hundreds of people of 40 years.

3658
01:59:23,280 --> 01:59:26,480
If you totaled up hundreds of people, it'd be like it would have two thousand years.

3659
01:59:26,480 --> 01:59:28,640
You would have unless none of them have that much experience.

3660
01:59:29,120 --> 01:59:31,280
They'll have six months experience.

3661
01:59:31,280 --> 01:59:34,520
Over 40 years, it was like we started in 1979.

3662
01:59:34,680 --> 01:59:36,120
It's pretty. Yes.

3663
01:59:36,120 --> 01:59:36,880
Four years, not that long ago.

3664
01:59:36,880 --> 01:59:39,120
A hundred acres in a line, baby.

3665
01:59:39,120 --> 01:59:41,800
The last Gen Xers.

3666
01:59:41,800 --> 01:59:43,680
Still religious.

3667
01:59:43,680 --> 01:59:45,680
The only religious Gen Xers.

3668
01:59:45,680 --> 01:59:46,160
As religious Gen Xers.

3669
01:59:46,160 --> 01:59:50,760
We came together to establish Heritage USA to celebrate American exceptionalism.

3670
01:59:51,520 --> 01:59:55,080
They say hundreds, but I think that it is all just one man.

3671
01:59:55,200 --> 01:59:58,000
And this man is named David Hare.

3672
01:59:58,440 --> 02:00:00,200
Oh, David.

3673
02:00:00,240 --> 02:00:02,680
Where do I begin with David Hare?

3674
02:00:03,400 --> 02:00:06,480
So David Hare seemed to have another company before this.

3675
02:00:06,760 --> 02:00:09,760
His previous company was called the Las Vegas Broadcasting Company.

3676
02:00:09,960 --> 02:00:12,040
They have a website that does not work.

3677
02:00:12,040 --> 02:00:14,920
And their last post on their Facebook is from over a year ago.

3678
02:00:14,920 --> 02:00:17,720
And it's apologizing for their Roku channel not working.

3679
02:00:18,720 --> 02:00:23,520
He moved his operations from Las Vegas Broadcasting Company to Heritage USA.

3680
02:00:23,800 --> 02:00:25,240
And after.

3681
02:00:25,240 --> 02:00:29,120
So I found that video that I just showed you the mission statement of Heritage USA.

3682
02:00:29,440 --> 02:00:31,400
And there was a lot on this YouTube channel.

3683
02:00:31,400 --> 02:00:34,760
It was a pretty robust Heritage USA YouTube channel.

3684
02:00:34,760 --> 02:00:36,560
I didn't know what to click on, where to begin.

3685
02:00:36,560 --> 02:00:40,120
Why don't I just dive right into the middle of the story with a video called

3686
02:00:40,120 --> 02:00:44,600
Do It Talk Three Moving Forward, period the challenge.

3687
02:00:46,720 --> 02:00:51,680
Now, one thing to note is there is no do it talk one or two.

3688
02:00:52,520 --> 02:00:54,480
We jump straight to three.

3689
02:00:54,480 --> 02:00:56,680
Those have been removed for terms of service violation.

3690
02:00:57,400 --> 02:00:59,000
Very possibly, yes.

3691
02:00:59,400 --> 02:01:04,960
So I just want you guys to meet David Hare, the way that I met David Hare.

3692
02:01:04,960 --> 02:01:09,560
And I think do it talk three gives you the best view of like this of this man

3693
02:01:09,560 --> 02:01:13,520
and what he's about and how and his level of organization.

3694
02:01:14,680 --> 02:01:18,240
I should note that this guy, he makes a lot of videos and always.

3695
02:01:18,880 --> 02:01:20,840
There's a lot of differences between the videos.

3696
02:01:20,840 --> 02:01:23,560
They're all very lengthy.

3697
02:01:23,920 --> 02:01:25,000
No one is joining him.

3698
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:27,520
He's just talking in a microphone for a very long time.

3699
02:01:27,680 --> 02:01:31,880
Sometimes he's in front of a painting of WC fields.

3700
02:01:32,160 --> 02:01:34,840
Sometimes he's in a digital green screen environment

3701
02:01:34,960 --> 02:01:37,480
with just like fireworks going off in the background.

3702
02:01:38,280 --> 02:01:41,120
But always the commonality, always a Diet Coke in front of them.

3703
02:01:42,320 --> 02:01:46,240
But here now to talk about moving forward, do it talk three, David Hare.

3704
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:49,560
Well, this is do it talk number three.

3705
02:01:49,960 --> 02:01:54,240
And this is the fourth time that we've done do it talk number three.

3706
02:01:54,240 --> 02:01:56,200
We've had some technical difficulties.

3707
02:01:56,560 --> 02:02:00,440
So rather than, you know, keep contending with that,

3708
02:02:00,440 --> 02:02:04,520
we decided to go one camera for this talk because it's a rather important.

3709
02:02:04,520 --> 02:02:05,720
You could cut this. Cut it.

3710
02:02:05,720 --> 02:02:08,080
I have a letter here from our attorney.

3711
02:02:08,320 --> 02:02:12,600
Take a look. Not the attorney that you originally met, but a law firm

3712
02:02:14,720 --> 02:02:17,800
that represents the corporation that I would love to read to you.

3713
02:02:17,800 --> 02:02:22,040
And I could probably I could probably basically

3714
02:02:23,040 --> 02:02:25,600
wrap this up if I could kind of use this letter.

3715
02:02:25,600 --> 02:02:28,680
I can't. I've been told not to, so I won't.

3716
02:02:28,680 --> 02:02:31,800
But I am going to read you one half sentence from it.

3717
02:02:32,960 --> 02:02:34,920
What? What's the sentence?

3718
02:02:34,920 --> 02:02:36,440
Is it like I don't see?

3719
02:02:36,440 --> 02:02:38,240
Sam's interesting.

3720
02:02:39,120 --> 02:02:40,440
What I elsewhere.

3721
02:02:40,440 --> 02:02:43,040
OK, so that video and he says at the beginning, I want to be brief.

3722
02:02:43,040 --> 02:02:45,040
I want to get right to it.

3723
02:02:45,040 --> 02:02:47,800
But then he talks for 16 more minutes.

3724
02:02:48,080 --> 02:02:51,520
And it has things in it like, is it doomsday?

3725
02:02:51,520 --> 02:02:53,320
No, no, it's not.

3726
02:02:53,320 --> 02:02:58,520
And anybody saying that on the Facebook, I resent that it is not every video.

3727
02:02:58,520 --> 02:03:00,120
And then that one's a short one.

3728
02:03:00,120 --> 02:03:02,080
He has hour long videos.

3729
02:03:02,080 --> 02:03:06,480
So I'm just going on and on pinning down like what is what is he doing?

3730
02:03:06,480 --> 02:03:07,760
What is the company?

3731
02:03:07,760 --> 02:03:10,760
What is he? What's his like belief system?

3732
02:03:10,760 --> 02:03:11,920
What is it?

3733
02:03:11,920 --> 02:03:13,520
Scatter shot insane.

3734
02:03:13,520 --> 02:03:17,280
OK, I think this is a guy who has he's been trying to be

3735
02:03:17,280 --> 02:03:20,080
like a media professional since the 80s.

3736
02:03:20,640 --> 02:03:24,960
I found a like in various ways, he's been like a host of things on the Heritage

3737
02:03:24,960 --> 02:03:29,480
USA on the YouTube channel for this theme park that's coming out in 2020.

3738
02:03:29,480 --> 02:03:33,280
Supposedly, there's a footage of him performing in a musical

3739
02:03:33,280 --> 02:03:35,640
that he seems to have written called Christmas is here.

3740
02:03:35,640 --> 02:03:36,560
Oh, my God.

3741
02:03:36,560 --> 02:03:39,000
Ninety. I don't have a clip of that.

3742
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:42,080
It's like if Alex Jones had a theme park and was a little.

3743
02:03:42,120 --> 02:03:45,440
It's very Alex Jonesy and that he seems to be like switching careers.

3744
02:03:45,480 --> 02:03:48,880
Right. He is a guy who just rambles on and can just unprompted

3745
02:03:48,880 --> 02:03:51,920
and who's getting into fights with nobody in these videos.

3746
02:03:52,480 --> 02:03:54,800
I found a pilot that he made in 1989.

3747
02:03:54,800 --> 02:03:57,680
There's someone that I will not mention that this really reminds me of

3748
02:03:57,680 --> 02:03:58,960
that you also know.

3749
02:03:58,960 --> 02:04:01,440
I'm sorry to do that on the podcast, but it's somebody we

3750
02:04:01,960 --> 02:04:04,040
we filmed some of their content for them.

3751
02:04:04,040 --> 02:04:05,200
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

3752
02:04:05,200 --> 02:04:07,920
I also put my fist through the wall of their stage.

3753
02:04:08,920 --> 02:04:12,360
I mean, it's something that made you so mad that one day we walked.

3754
02:04:12,360 --> 02:04:13,880
I walked into work and there was a flat.

3755
02:04:13,880 --> 02:04:15,360
Oh, no, I put a C-stand through it.

3756
02:04:15,360 --> 02:04:18,800
Yes, there is a C-stand sized hole in the middle of the stage.

3757
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:23,120
Oh, you mean like you're saying a sort of scammy guy

3758
02:04:23,120 --> 02:04:27,040
who just tricks company after company, doesn't have a good sketchy meter.

3759
02:04:27,040 --> 02:04:28,240
Self inflated.

3760
02:04:28,240 --> 02:04:29,480
I know. I see.

3761
02:04:29,480 --> 02:04:30,440
So you were talking.

3762
02:04:30,440 --> 02:04:33,160
People kind of reminds me of Alki David.

3763
02:04:33,640 --> 02:04:35,000
Oh, the billionaire.

3764
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:38,720
There's this weird guy we ran into who owns the hologram theater

3765
02:04:38,720 --> 02:04:42,240
on Hollywood Boulevard, and he's been sued for and lost

3766
02:04:42,240 --> 02:04:46,000
a sexual harassment lawsuit like a year ago and or no, this year.

3767
02:04:46,040 --> 02:04:50,720
Very recently, he makes some of the scariest Instagram stories you've ever seen.

3768
02:04:51,200 --> 02:04:54,920
That's all where he just like calls his wife a bitch and like, it's like, gee,

3769
02:04:54,920 --> 02:04:56,560
one of the grimest things you've ever.

3770
02:04:56,560 --> 02:04:58,480
Yeah. But weird where you look into it.

3771
02:04:58,480 --> 02:05:01,320
And when you look into somebody's history and like, huh,

3772
02:05:01,320 --> 02:05:04,880
I wonder if this person is owns 12 weird companies over the years.

3773
02:05:05,120 --> 02:05:07,200
Not a good sign.

3774
02:05:07,200 --> 02:05:08,280
So OK.

3775
02:05:08,280 --> 02:05:12,360
And then he made a pilot for a show in the Dallas, Fort Worth area.

3776
02:05:12,600 --> 02:05:17,640
I don't know if growing up, you caught the seemingly single episode of Family Jubilee.

3777
02:05:18,280 --> 02:05:19,400
Nope.

3778
02:05:19,400 --> 02:05:23,080
No, there is a special appearance from impressionist Fred Travelina.

3779
02:05:23,400 --> 02:05:24,680
Oh, my gosh. They got traveling.

3780
02:05:24,680 --> 02:05:26,520
They got traveling.

3781
02:05:26,520 --> 02:05:27,320
We got traveling.

3782
02:05:27,320 --> 02:05:29,280
You probably did, Reagan, Mr. Travelina.

3783
02:05:29,600 --> 02:05:32,160
Mr. Travelina.

3784
02:05:32,160 --> 02:05:36,840
So as Jason, as you were saying, he since the 80s has been

3785
02:05:36,840 --> 02:05:39,560
peddling around a character named Hubble Hare.

3786
02:05:39,880 --> 02:05:44,920
Hubble Hare is in the logo of Heritage USA

3787
02:05:45,760 --> 02:05:50,600
and this footage from a long time ago of like a guy of a Hubble Hare suit.

3788
02:05:50,920 --> 02:05:52,760
And you can only assume he's the one in the hubble.

3789
02:05:52,760 --> 02:05:53,880
So he's been carting.

3790
02:05:53,880 --> 02:05:55,840
He also seems to have come from Orange County.

3791
02:05:55,840 --> 02:05:59,200
So this guy has just been doing weird media enterprise after weird media

3792
02:05:59,200 --> 02:06:01,880
enterprise, trying to make his character thing.

3793
02:06:01,960 --> 02:06:04,280
He seems to have a real Walt complex.

3794
02:06:04,280 --> 02:06:07,840
Like there's a video where he says, because we're doing it like the original did it.

3795
02:06:08,680 --> 02:06:10,280
Walter.

3796
02:06:12,680 --> 02:06:14,840
I'm going to say four shots in.

3797
02:06:14,840 --> 02:06:15,960
Walter.

3798
02:06:15,960 --> 02:06:19,600
Oh, I think Orange County, California has some of the weirdest,

3799
02:06:19,600 --> 02:06:21,600
darkest energy in the country.

3800
02:06:21,600 --> 02:06:23,080
I buy that.

3801
02:06:23,080 --> 02:06:23,840
Yeah, I see that.

3802
02:06:23,840 --> 02:06:24,920
I see that for sure.

3803
02:06:24,920 --> 02:06:27,680
Obviously, we love Anaheim and we're very excited for our show.

3804
02:06:27,720 --> 02:06:29,480
The Anaheim Hotel, which is still to come.

3805
02:06:29,480 --> 02:06:30,920
Yes, tomorrow.

3806
02:06:30,920 --> 02:06:31,640
We're thrilled.

3807
02:06:31,640 --> 02:06:34,640
But there are also like KKK stuff in Anaheim.

3808
02:06:34,640 --> 02:06:36,640
Yes, I that's what I would.

3809
02:06:36,720 --> 02:06:37,600
Still, yes.

3810
02:06:37,600 --> 02:06:40,960
We were texting about like alcohol in Disney.

3811
02:06:40,960 --> 02:06:46,400
And I I didn't want to get into this because I was, you know, with my family

3812
02:06:46,400 --> 02:06:47,280
and about to go to the beach.

3813
02:06:47,280 --> 02:06:51,320
But I sort of alluded to like the some of the residents of Orange.

3814
02:06:51,360 --> 02:06:55,920
But Orange County just seems like a powder keg to me because it's like a hotbed of

3815
02:06:56,800 --> 02:07:00,520
classes, like the highest of highs in terms of money and the lowest of lows.

3816
02:07:00,520 --> 02:07:03,160
And there was a huge white nationalist presence.

3817
02:07:03,400 --> 02:07:07,680
And then there is a massive entertainment complexes in the middle of it.

3818
02:07:07,920 --> 02:07:10,920
And it always just makes me very nervous sometimes.

3819
02:07:10,920 --> 02:07:12,680
Yeah, not in the Disney bubble.

3820
02:07:12,680 --> 02:07:18,160
That's fine. But like I posted an Instagram one time of just saying how much I like

3821
02:07:18,160 --> 02:07:20,640
Orange County. And what I mean is like the resorty.

3822
02:07:20,800 --> 02:07:24,320
I like I like the route that the Disney Resort, I like Newport Beach.

3823
02:07:24,320 --> 02:07:25,760
I like like Top Shelf.

3824
02:07:25,760 --> 02:07:27,760
Yeah, that side of things.

3825
02:07:27,760 --> 02:07:28,360
You want to go?

3826
02:07:28,360 --> 02:07:32,840
I just went and wandered around like the Hyatt Regency in Huntington Beach

3827
02:07:32,840 --> 02:07:35,120
and had a great time, stuff like that.

3828
02:07:35,120 --> 02:07:37,240
So I just posted Instagram like I love Orange County, man.

3829
02:07:37,240 --> 02:07:38,800
Another great Orange County weekend.

3830
02:07:38,800 --> 02:07:42,640
And a friend of mine texted me and said, are you talking about the same county

3831
02:07:42,640 --> 02:07:46,720
where my my family, my children and I were recently hassled on the beach

3832
02:07:46,720 --> 02:07:48,200
for being Jewish?

3833
02:07:48,200 --> 02:07:50,560
Like, there is weird.

3834
02:07:50,560 --> 02:07:54,280
Yeah. And so I don't I don't think we're casting aspersions on all of Orange County.

3835
02:07:54,280 --> 02:07:57,440
But I know you said there is weird, there are weird pockets, weird pockets.

3836
02:07:57,440 --> 02:08:00,160
Totally plenty of normal people, plenty of weird pockets.

3837
02:08:00,320 --> 02:08:03,640
Do you think this guy is is is like a huckster

3838
02:08:03,640 --> 02:08:08,280
who's just kind of changed things over the years and now he's kind of is he go?

3839
02:08:08,280 --> 02:08:13,080
Is he saying American exceptionalism because he knows that's kind of a thing right now?

3840
02:08:13,080 --> 02:08:17,360
And it's where like scrappy shady media is conservative media person.

3841
02:08:17,360 --> 02:08:19,080
And I'll probably be readily embraced.

3842
02:08:19,080 --> 02:08:24,760
I think so. And maybe also a hardcore Orange County like pub.

3843
02:08:25,160 --> 02:08:27,160
I'm not sure. It doesn't seem to because there's nothing.

3844
02:08:27,160 --> 02:08:31,720
I will say there's nothing in any of this stuff alluding to to hate or anything.

3845
02:08:31,720 --> 02:08:33,440
Well, it's just the fighter jets and stuff.

3846
02:08:33,440 --> 02:08:36,840
It's like it seems like that's appealing to a certain. Yeah.

3847
02:08:36,840 --> 02:08:40,440
Yeah. Well, and also what I think is that he's a guy who got pushed.

3848
02:08:40,440 --> 02:08:44,640
He didn't like fit into the entertainment industry, like the mid the mainstream.

3849
02:08:44,640 --> 02:08:46,280
Right. So he's blaming it on.

3850
02:08:46,280 --> 02:08:49,680
Well, I guess they don't respect my values.

3851
02:08:49,680 --> 02:08:53,240
And that's what happened because in this thing where he's supposed to be saying

3852
02:08:53,280 --> 02:08:57,680
what we're doing, the video should be I'm going to fix the merry-go-round next week.

3853
02:08:58,040 --> 02:09:00,600
And instead, it's like we're going to build a studio and we're going to start making

3854
02:09:00,600 --> 02:09:07,680
animations. And he goes on and on and on wearing blazers that go like up to half of his arm.

3855
02:09:07,880 --> 02:09:10,120
That's the most the strangest style.

3856
02:09:11,200 --> 02:09:14,760
He he spends I feel crazy describing this.

3857
02:09:14,960 --> 02:09:19,000
He describes how he's working on a show that's a little a little bit of an adult

3858
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:23,000
animated show, kind of like The Simpsons or American Dad, where we're going to talk

3859
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:27,960
about those people in Hollywood and remind them of the way they used to do it

3860
02:09:28,200 --> 02:09:32,320
and remind them of how their point of view isn't everyone's point of view.

3861
02:09:32,480 --> 02:09:34,520
And he proceeds to play used to do it.

3862
02:09:34,520 --> 02:09:36,120
I can see that's what bothers me.

3863
02:09:36,120 --> 02:09:38,240
Yeah. That's leaning into like that.

3864
02:09:38,240 --> 02:09:42,840
That's like code for when it was musicals with whites, you know, it's like,

3865
02:09:43,560 --> 02:09:48,400
when all minorities were suppressed and made invisible as labor

3866
02:09:48,600 --> 02:09:51,680
that was non-unionized or we would destroy their lives.

3867
02:09:51,680 --> 02:09:53,840
And it was a little easier to beat your wife.

3868
02:09:53,840 --> 02:09:54,720
Right. Yeah.

3869
02:09:54,720 --> 02:09:57,040
It's just by show up on any set.

3870
02:09:57,360 --> 02:09:59,720
When things were like the way Al Capran.

3871
02:10:01,800 --> 02:10:05,640
Eddie Mannix would show up at your house and bring your windows if you didn't get to set on time.

3872
02:10:07,320 --> 02:10:10,160
So then he shows a video and the video is called Hollywood.

3873
02:10:10,360 --> 02:10:14,720
And in the video, he voices Carol Channing and Carol Channing.

3874
02:10:14,720 --> 02:10:16,520
For some reason, he's really going contemporary.

3875
02:10:16,520 --> 02:10:18,160
He's just really reaching for the edge.

3876
02:10:18,160 --> 02:10:18,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3877
02:10:18,960 --> 02:10:21,640
And even says, kids, Google Carol Channing.

3878
02:10:21,640 --> 02:10:27,840
She's a you know, she's a she used to talk like this and does a terrible Carol Channing impression.

3879
02:10:27,840 --> 02:10:30,360
And she sings a song called You Were Wrong.

3880
02:10:32,080 --> 02:10:34,120
No counterpoint.

3881
02:10:34,120 --> 02:10:35,000
You were wrong.

3882
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:40,080
And it is a song about how like Hollywood people telling you your opinions.

3883
02:10:40,080 --> 02:10:42,880
You know, it's this really like you got it wrong.

3884
02:10:42,920 --> 02:10:44,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3885
02:10:44,080 --> 02:10:46,120
Don't tell me what to think again.

3886
02:10:46,800 --> 02:10:52,880
I thought I was putting on a video about like and then the train track will cross through the new meadow that we're putting in nice new grass.

3887
02:10:53,560 --> 02:11:01,640
Isn't it funny that the criticism is always like the content is lascivious, violent, over sexualized, disgusting, amoral.

3888
02:11:02,480 --> 02:11:10,720
And then also preachy, progressive, opinionated, holier than thou, elitist, too academic.

3889
02:11:10,720 --> 02:11:16,040
Where it's like, wait, it's almost like describe what would you make?

3890
02:11:16,360 --> 02:11:17,400
Yeah, yeah.

3891
02:11:17,400 --> 02:11:21,360
Well, and what they often hear is like Dean Cain firefighter movies.

3892
02:11:21,840 --> 02:11:23,480
That's what that's fine.

3893
02:11:23,480 --> 02:11:24,040
They're fine.

3894
02:11:24,040 --> 02:11:24,520
I'll take it.

3895
02:11:25,280 --> 02:11:28,840
Yeah, at least really the firefighter movie people put their money where their mouth.

3896
02:11:28,840 --> 02:11:33,640
But I also feel like 99 percent of stuff that Hollywood generates is also Dean Cain firefighter movies.

3897
02:11:34,160 --> 02:11:35,760
Yes, it's actually higher quality.

3898
02:11:35,760 --> 02:11:37,160
People are more experienced.

3899
02:11:37,520 --> 02:11:41,720
But the Dean Cain ones are the ones that moralize for they like specific times to moralize.

3900
02:11:41,720 --> 02:11:42,720
It's like, don't moralize.

3901
02:11:42,720 --> 02:11:45,160
Like, get your politics out of my comics or my movies.

3902
02:11:45,560 --> 02:11:46,960
Don't moralize this stuff.

3903
02:11:46,960 --> 02:11:53,000
And it's also like, this is disgusting, prurient, content trash.

3904
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:56,120
But then so much of that trash is like, well, you know, the U.S.

3905
02:11:56,120 --> 02:11:58,880
Army paid for like half that movie.

3906
02:11:59,160 --> 02:12:01,840
You had to get those tanks and jets from somewhere like.

3907
02:12:01,840 --> 02:12:03,040
Yeah, yeah.

3908
02:12:03,040 --> 02:12:07,840
I'm never sure what they're talking about, especially when it's like dancing with the star.

3909
02:12:07,840 --> 02:12:09,280
Yeah, get this vile.

3910
02:12:09,440 --> 02:12:13,080
Like the Navy, the Navy enlistment rates going up after Top Gun.

3911
02:12:13,360 --> 02:12:14,440
Right. Same thing.

3912
02:12:14,440 --> 02:12:14,680
Yeah.

3913
02:12:14,680 --> 02:12:15,200
Oh, yeah.

3914
02:12:15,200 --> 02:12:18,000
Where it's like, what are we supposed to stand for?

3915
02:12:18,360 --> 02:12:19,920
Make me whatever you want to make me.

3916
02:12:21,200 --> 02:12:22,280
Charles Manson quote.

3917
02:12:22,760 --> 02:12:23,640
All right, I'm going to go.

3918
02:12:24,240 --> 02:12:25,440
It's a pretty confused.

3919
02:12:25,440 --> 02:12:26,520
It's a narrow window.

3920
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:36,480
Other quotes from this guy, you know, because I'm not sure it's widely understood within certain parts of the entertainment industry that the American flag is a good thing.

3921
02:12:36,880 --> 02:12:38,360
So we're going to celebrate it.

3922
02:12:38,400 --> 02:12:39,760
We're going to do it with fun.

3923
02:12:40,320 --> 02:12:41,720
Do it with fun, he says.

3924
02:12:41,720 --> 02:12:50,760
Literally, the movie skyscraper ends with the American flag being for all the taking up most of the movie with the biggest movie star.

3925
02:12:50,760 --> 02:12:51,880
Spider-Man one.

3926
02:12:51,880 --> 02:12:52,880
Spider-Man one.

3927
02:12:52,880 --> 02:12:54,640
One of us with all of us.

3928
02:12:54,640 --> 02:12:57,560
And then he goes up on the Washington monument in the new one.

3929
02:12:57,560 --> 02:12:58,680
Yeah, the Washington monument.

3930
02:12:58,680 --> 02:13:01,920
Yeah, he's talking about those Hollywood elites like Colin Kaepernick.

3931
02:13:02,360 --> 02:13:06,440
I'm sick of Colin Kaepernick in his movies telling me where to put my.

3932
02:13:06,440 --> 02:13:07,720
I want to make a Colin Kaepernick movie.

3933
02:13:07,920 --> 02:13:09,080
He should be an action star.

3934
02:13:09,200 --> 02:13:10,680
Yeah, he's not going to get drafted.

3935
02:13:10,920 --> 02:13:11,760
No, I'm in a movie.

3936
02:13:11,760 --> 02:13:12,640
He'd probably be awesome.

3937
02:13:12,720 --> 02:13:13,000
Sure.

3938
02:13:13,040 --> 02:13:14,280
Yeah, yeah, I'll show up.

3939
02:13:14,280 --> 02:13:16,280
I'll show him and him and Dave Grohl.

3940
02:13:17,320 --> 02:13:18,120
That would be awesome.

3941
02:13:18,120 --> 02:13:20,680
We're with the riffraffs who we want to put.

3942
02:13:20,880 --> 02:13:23,680
They think they have charisma, even though they're not actors proper.

3943
02:13:23,680 --> 02:13:24,080
Angry.

3944
02:13:24,240 --> 02:13:25,280
Yeah, sure.

3945
02:13:25,400 --> 02:13:26,640
Yeah, older now.

3946
02:13:26,680 --> 02:13:30,920
He bangs on bad guys heads like it would be like the drums.

3947
02:13:30,960 --> 02:13:32,640
Got a lot of documentaries to appear in.

3948
02:13:32,880 --> 02:13:34,800
OK, so he's saying that we don't respect the American flag.

3949
02:13:34,800 --> 02:13:36,000
We don't respect the American flag.

3950
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:39,280
The educational system is being overrun with an anti-American agenda.

3951
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:41,760
Christian values are in attack.

3952
02:13:41,760 --> 02:13:42,560
All of this stuff.

3953
02:13:42,560 --> 02:13:45,240
And why you say you're going to build a little place with a train?

3954
02:13:45,240 --> 02:13:46,720
Why is all of this important?

3955
02:13:48,120 --> 02:13:49,880
And this is Decker.

3956
02:13:49,880 --> 02:13:51,200
This is just Tim Heidecker.

3957
02:13:51,200 --> 02:13:52,120
You got it.

3958
02:13:52,120 --> 02:13:55,080
It is so Decker-esque in that he it's like really

3959
02:13:55,600 --> 02:13:59,480
that he just rambles on and on and on a lot of like heavy breathing.

3960
02:13:59,480 --> 02:14:02,760
Like, you know, look, if Dogpatch USA was up, if Herri...

3961
02:14:02,760 --> 02:14:07,280
If the name Heritage Heritage USA Ozarks Resort at historic dog patch,

3962
02:14:07,640 --> 02:14:10,160
if that that's what that's what the full title is going to be.

3963
02:14:10,480 --> 02:14:13,760
If that was open and thriving today, I wouldn't be questioning anything.

3964
02:14:13,760 --> 02:14:15,800
But it is it is not.

3965
02:14:15,800 --> 02:14:17,960
And so here's what seems to have happened.

3966
02:14:17,960 --> 02:14:20,320
So he plants on the land allegedly.

3967
02:14:20,800 --> 02:14:21,840
He plants on land.

3968
02:14:21,840 --> 02:14:24,440
He's making a lot of videos talking about all the cartoons that we're going to make.

3969
02:14:24,440 --> 02:14:27,320
We're going to make a Hubble, a Hubble hair animated film.

3970
02:14:27,520 --> 02:14:31,240
He's like angry at no one like because animation takes a long time.

3971
02:14:31,680 --> 02:14:34,040
OK, so give it a minute.

3972
02:14:34,400 --> 02:14:36,640
We're going to be done with the logo in three months.

3973
02:14:36,640 --> 02:14:38,240
I love giving you a human target.

3974
02:14:38,240 --> 02:14:39,640
That's always my favorite.

3975
02:14:39,640 --> 02:14:44,360
Scott, you know, you've seen that somebody squarely in Scott's crosshairs.

3976
02:14:45,280 --> 02:14:46,760
It'll be good. Yeah, yeah.

3977
02:14:46,760 --> 02:14:49,400
It does does light me up.

3978
02:14:49,400 --> 02:14:51,560
OK, I'll be careful, though.

3979
02:14:51,560 --> 02:14:54,040
No, no, it's like we all read the Wikipedia.

3980
02:14:55,080 --> 02:14:58,640
I think when you're a public figure, you open yourself when you're a high profile.

3981
02:14:59,760 --> 02:15:02,560
You have a YouTube channel that speaking has a YouTube.

3982
02:15:02,880 --> 02:15:05,680
You are the Andy Cap of YouTube.

3983
02:15:05,720 --> 02:15:09,320
He's got a forum that's the cap or Al Cap using each other's forums.

3984
02:15:09,720 --> 02:15:11,800
The both of you are making hot fries on YouTube.

3985
02:15:11,800 --> 02:15:14,120
No such thing as bad press.

3986
02:15:14,120 --> 02:15:15,560
All right. Now here I'm just going to OK.

3987
02:15:15,560 --> 02:15:16,360
So he's making a lot of videos.

3988
02:15:16,360 --> 02:15:18,520
He's talking about how we're going to make animated films.

3989
02:15:18,520 --> 02:15:19,520
There's a lot of plans.

3990
02:15:19,520 --> 02:15:22,600
What he doesn't seem to be doing is like fixing up the park.

3991
02:15:22,880 --> 02:15:25,360
Yeah. And I'm watching these videos.

3992
02:15:25,360 --> 02:15:27,320
I'm watching hour long videos.

3993
02:15:27,320 --> 02:15:31,400
I'm wanting to I'm wanting to turn them off like, all right, it's getting a little dull.

3994
02:15:31,400 --> 02:15:34,880
Maybe I need and then 38 minutes into a video, he will say,

3995
02:15:35,720 --> 02:15:39,000
OK, look, somebody buried the pool at the hotel.

3996
02:15:39,160 --> 02:15:40,760
All right. It is covered in sand.

3997
02:15:40,760 --> 02:15:42,280
And we've been meaning to get it fixed.

3998
02:15:42,280 --> 02:15:44,520
And it is on our list. It is on our list.

3999
02:15:44,800 --> 02:15:48,000
But so in the but in the meantime, we know the kids need somewhere to play.

4000
02:15:48,200 --> 02:15:49,480
We have a moon bounce.

4001
02:15:49,480 --> 02:15:50,840
We got how there is moon bounce.

4002
02:15:50,840 --> 02:15:53,520
So go to the so if you're going to stay at the hotel, go to the moon bounce.

4003
02:15:54,400 --> 02:15:56,640
Though the pool was buried in sand.

4004
02:15:56,640 --> 02:16:01,680
What? I mean, I guess people don't hurt themselves by falling into an empty pool.

4005
02:16:01,680 --> 02:16:04,560
Although that clearly they weren't looking out for people's safety.

4006
02:16:04,560 --> 02:16:06,600
There's a lot of safety issues.

4007
02:16:06,600 --> 02:16:08,440
The hotel is open.

4008
02:16:08,440 --> 02:16:09,600
This is important to note.

4009
02:16:09,600 --> 02:16:12,480
I read fleetingly like and I may have gotten this wrong,

4010
02:16:12,760 --> 02:16:15,920
but like that people were booking rooms and they did.

4011
02:16:15,920 --> 02:16:17,320
There wasn't a place to go.

4012
02:16:17,320 --> 02:16:18,960
That's that's absolutely great.

4013
02:16:18,960 --> 02:16:19,880
Fire festy.

4014
02:16:19,880 --> 02:16:22,560
And I will credit him in that he

4015
02:16:23,960 --> 02:16:28,600
he wanted to not open the hotel until the rooms had all been remodeled.

4016
02:16:28,840 --> 02:16:31,600
There's other financiers saying we got to get this place open.

4017
02:16:31,800 --> 02:16:34,440
So they do open the hotel,

4018
02:16:34,440 --> 02:16:38,280
but it builds to a point, yes, where there is nowhere for them them to go.

4019
02:16:39,840 --> 02:16:41,920
One quick guests, right?

4020
02:16:41,920 --> 02:16:42,680
Guess. Yes.

4021
02:16:42,680 --> 02:16:43,800
So, yeah, guests at the hotel.

4022
02:16:43,800 --> 02:16:46,320
There's if they if you come, there's nowhere to go.

4023
02:16:46,320 --> 02:16:49,760
Possibly because he's putting a lot of time into making various videos.

4024
02:16:49,760 --> 02:16:51,800
Let me play this quick one.

4025
02:16:51,800 --> 02:16:56,360
Imagine in this video for anybody not who doesn't have eyes on it.

4026
02:16:56,720 --> 02:16:59,720
There's sort of a sub Sherry Lewis puppet

4027
02:17:00,080 --> 02:17:01,280
who is driving a Mr.

4028
02:17:01,280 --> 02:17:05,560
Toad S vehicle in a green screen scape.

4029
02:17:05,560 --> 02:17:07,800
And there's a song called Down and Dog Patch.

4030
02:17:26,520 --> 02:17:27,480
Gives you the idea.

4031
02:17:27,480 --> 02:17:29,320
Can I have a little more?

4032
02:17:32,320 --> 02:17:33,480
I want to see if there's like a chorus.

4033
02:17:33,480 --> 02:17:34,720
Make that your ringtone, Scott.

4034
02:17:34,720 --> 02:17:36,560
Heck of a day can do.

4035
02:17:39,120 --> 02:17:40,480
Closer to Mike.

4036
02:17:41,480 --> 02:17:42,360
Yeah.

4037
02:17:42,360 --> 02:17:44,960
Riding on that train.

4038
02:17:44,960 --> 02:17:47,200
Imagination is to.

4039
02:17:48,400 --> 02:17:50,480
Riding on that train.

4040
02:17:51,160 --> 02:17:52,240
I'll be honest, I like it.

4041
02:17:52,240 --> 02:17:54,280
It kind of makes me a little nostalgic.

4042
02:17:54,360 --> 02:17:55,120
Does it?

4043
02:17:55,120 --> 02:17:59,480
I was thinking it might sort of recall like what maybe the little bit of the child.

4044
02:17:59,480 --> 02:18:01,480
I got a little bit there.

4045
02:18:01,480 --> 02:18:04,200
But then you watch another video where he shows you a taste of that.

4046
02:18:04,200 --> 02:18:05,680
And then he says, here's the problem.

4047
02:18:05,680 --> 02:18:08,440
The video is not done because we haven't done the color correction

4048
02:18:08,720 --> 02:18:10,720
and color correction takes a while.

4049
02:18:10,720 --> 02:18:13,600
And you have to film it at different times of the day.

4050
02:18:13,600 --> 02:18:17,680
And the sun moves. So how many views does the video is on average?

4051
02:18:17,680 --> 02:18:21,040
Like 500. OK, but are there comments or people are like, this looks like shit?

4052
02:18:22,040 --> 02:18:27,000
I think there was a Facebook page.

4053
02:18:27,000 --> 02:18:29,120
I mean, no one physically in the videos is yelling at,

4054
02:18:29,120 --> 02:18:33,520
but he seems to be responding to vague, bad sentiment in the Facebook group,

4055
02:18:33,720 --> 02:18:37,720
including he says at one point, let me find it.

4056
02:18:38,080 --> 02:18:40,480
Look, I'm not God. I'm not a deity.

4057
02:18:40,480 --> 02:18:42,400
I don't know all things.

4058
02:18:42,400 --> 02:18:45,920
I appreciate the well wishes of most of you.

4059
02:18:46,720 --> 02:18:49,240
So he's clearly getting some negative criticism.

4060
02:18:49,480 --> 02:18:53,640
Anytime he's ever said something like that, one person said it.

4061
02:18:54,160 --> 02:18:57,480
Yeah. Like we found the one negative comment.

4062
02:18:57,480 --> 02:19:00,160
Like when we got one three star review and it drove us crazy.

4063
02:19:00,160 --> 02:19:01,840
And I think it's still if we really thought about it.

4064
02:19:01,840 --> 02:19:03,160
We got worked up. Yeah.

4065
02:19:03,160 --> 02:19:04,800
Look, we're working on it.

4066
02:19:04,800 --> 02:19:06,640
We don't have Mike Stans yet. Yeah.

4067
02:19:06,640 --> 02:19:08,440
We're a new podcast. We didn't know.

4068
02:19:10,880 --> 02:19:13,200
The sand in the pool thing reminds me of a story.

4069
02:19:13,200 --> 02:19:15,160
And just like you guys get your person anonymous,

4070
02:19:15,160 --> 02:19:17,080
I'll keep everyone anonymous in the story.

4071
02:19:17,080 --> 02:19:19,320
But someone went into a meeting once with someone

4072
02:19:19,640 --> 02:19:21,960
and the person they were going to meet with was late.

4073
02:19:21,960 --> 02:19:24,640
And they came in. They're like, so sorry.

4074
02:19:24,640 --> 02:19:26,640
I got held up at the mechanic.

4075
02:19:26,640 --> 02:19:28,760
A rat crawled in my engine.

4076
02:19:30,280 --> 02:19:33,600
They're like, yeah, the engine of my car is a rat in there.

4077
02:19:34,480 --> 02:19:37,160
You got to tell us this later. Yeah, I will.

4078
02:19:38,120 --> 02:19:40,600
Listeners want to DM any of you to get the names.

4079
02:19:40,600 --> 02:19:42,760
Yeah, we can. Yeah.

4080
02:19:42,760 --> 02:19:44,840
We believe in the name of who we're talking about.

4081
02:19:44,840 --> 02:19:46,840
It's a higher Patreon tier, maybe.

4082
02:19:46,840 --> 02:19:49,200
Yeah. Yeah, this is a slander tier.

4083
02:19:49,200 --> 02:19:51,200
The slander tier.

4084
02:19:51,200 --> 02:19:53,200
It gets you.

4085
02:19:53,640 --> 02:19:56,360
So anyway,

4086
02:19:56,360 --> 02:19:59,160
yeah, a lot of video yelling at no one else.

4087
02:19:59,160 --> 02:20:01,720
I can't stop reading them. We are renting ATVs.

4088
02:20:01,720 --> 02:20:03,560
The answer to the question, can we bring our own?

4089
02:20:03,560 --> 02:20:06,120
Well, no, it's not a free for all.

4090
02:20:06,120 --> 02:20:08,120
You got to rent them from us.

4091
02:20:09,560 --> 02:20:11,080
It makes.

4092
02:20:11,080 --> 02:20:13,200
We'll give them the history. Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're right.

4093
02:20:13,600 --> 02:20:16,120
But later in the same

4094
02:20:16,120 --> 02:20:20,240
in the same stint, look, I'm not putting down canoes, but you know,

4095
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:24,280
we have to ask.

4096
02:20:24,280 --> 02:20:27,760
We have to get involved and ask questions.

4097
02:20:27,760 --> 02:20:28,400
Don't you think?

4098
02:20:28,400 --> 02:20:31,800
Well, I don't know if that's gone into your life.

4099
02:20:31,800 --> 02:20:34,000
Oh, I don't know. I think we already have.

4100
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:36,040
I think. Oh, yeah, I think we could be hearing about this.

4101
02:20:36,040 --> 02:20:38,680
And I don't like your shows or your podcast.

4102
02:20:38,680 --> 02:20:40,800
These Hollywood

4103
02:20:40,880 --> 02:20:42,080
stories are.

4104
02:20:42,080 --> 02:20:43,800
Yeah, he's going to leave us a review.

4105
02:20:43,800 --> 02:20:44,640
Amazon review.

4106
02:20:44,640 --> 02:20:48,160
Well, if you know how to get to the podcast, the right guys,

4107
02:20:48,160 --> 02:20:51,680
give us a three star review and we'll be infuriated forever.

4108
02:20:51,680 --> 02:20:53,720
Catch. Fuck you.

4109
02:20:53,720 --> 02:20:54,840
Catch. Fuck you.

4110
02:20:54,840 --> 02:20:57,320
I like this song, though.

4111
02:20:58,320 --> 02:21:00,720
I like this song that this guy made with a puppet.

4112
02:21:00,720 --> 02:21:01,920
I like the puppet song.

4113
02:21:01,920 --> 02:21:04,920
The fuck is the color correction, but the farts you lose.

4114
02:21:05,680 --> 02:21:07,600
No one's going to see that.

4115
02:21:08,280 --> 02:21:10,120
That's what you're saying to yourself already.

4116
02:21:10,160 --> 02:21:12,440
That's me. I said that earlier on the podcast.

4117
02:21:12,800 --> 02:21:15,320
Way ahead of you, David, your own negative commenter.

4118
02:21:16,560 --> 02:21:20,480
OK, so he's making these dog patch videos, which, by the way,

4119
02:21:20,520 --> 02:21:21,880
and you should watch the whole thing.

4120
02:21:21,880 --> 02:21:22,720
It's a lot of fun.

4121
02:21:22,720 --> 02:21:26,200
It's about that guy's name is Foxworthy and he watches a news report

4122
02:21:26,200 --> 02:21:29,240
and he gets mad that hobble hair,

4123
02:21:29,280 --> 02:21:33,040
hubble hair is moving to his town and he's like, I'm going to get him.

4124
02:21:33,040 --> 02:21:36,480
So then he watches like a dossier from like sort of a, you know,

4125
02:21:36,880 --> 02:21:40,200
the Charlie and Charlie's Angels type dog who gives him the mission.

4126
02:21:40,240 --> 02:21:41,080
Here's how you got to go.

4127
02:21:41,080 --> 02:21:44,360
Of course. And that video is called Down in Dogpatch Episode One, Part One.

4128
02:21:44,400 --> 02:21:47,680
Again, there are no further of these.

4129
02:21:47,680 --> 02:21:52,840
And even within this thing, the puppet dog takes the time out of nowhere.

4130
02:21:52,880 --> 02:21:57,120
He takes the time to say, hey, have you seen the FBI director's new book?

4131
02:21:57,120 --> 02:22:00,320
It's a real work of fiction like Mary Poppins.

4132
02:22:00,600 --> 02:22:03,560
Like he's criticizing Comey within this video.

4133
02:22:03,560 --> 02:22:05,520
Sounds like he's like a personal thing.

4134
02:22:05,520 --> 02:22:09,280
Like it's bleeding into his normal universal content.

4135
02:22:09,320 --> 02:22:10,480
Normal. Yeah.

4136
02:22:10,480 --> 02:22:13,640
Well, you know, his endeavor to reach a mass audience.

4137
02:22:14,040 --> 02:22:15,400
But it's in there.

4138
02:22:15,400 --> 02:22:16,720
So he's got to get it out.

4139
02:22:16,720 --> 02:22:19,080
He's got a platform now. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4140
02:22:19,080 --> 02:22:20,880
Yes. And fuck, Comey.

4141
02:22:20,880 --> 02:22:25,560
It's like, by the way, Charlie Horace on Lambchop started complaining about Dan Quayle.

4142
02:22:27,240 --> 02:22:29,040
You know, who's an idiot?

4143
02:22:29,040 --> 02:22:30,680
Learn how to spell.

4144
02:22:30,680 --> 02:22:32,960
Chris, he this is you've opened up a kid.

4145
02:22:32,960 --> 02:22:37,160
Aaron, Aaron is going to be calling you and go like, why did you plant this seat?

4146
02:22:37,240 --> 02:22:38,360
Oh, God, I know.

4147
02:22:38,360 --> 02:22:40,440
It's covered in red string. Sorry, man.

4148
02:22:41,120 --> 02:22:43,200
I was going to come after Aaron on Twitter.

4149
02:22:43,200 --> 02:22:45,560
Oh, no. He won't find me.

4150
02:22:45,640 --> 02:22:47,040
Everyone's in trouble.

4151
02:22:47,040 --> 02:22:48,920
We open a movie and enjoy it.

4152
02:22:48,920 --> 02:22:50,920
But I was a quiet, beautiful thriller.

4153
02:22:50,920 --> 02:22:52,560
And yes, yeah, I saw it. I saw it.

4154
02:22:52,560 --> 02:22:53,360
Really kind of. It's wonderful.

4155
02:22:53,360 --> 02:22:55,600
Is it playing dog patches? The road show?

4156
02:22:55,600 --> 02:22:56,840
Yes, we're going to do the dog.

4157
02:22:56,840 --> 02:22:58,000
We're going to do. Yeah.

4158
02:22:58,000 --> 02:22:59,440
You're using one of the rooms as a dog.

4159
02:22:59,520 --> 02:23:05,280
Big from the unopened hotel from the bedroom and might be bit by the

4160
02:23:05,280 --> 02:23:07,120
movie. There's definitely sand.

4161
02:23:07,120 --> 02:23:08,200
Yeah, there's some sand.

4162
02:23:08,200 --> 02:23:11,000
And we're going to go swimming in the sandy, the sandy holler pool.

4163
02:23:11,040 --> 02:23:14,240
Yeah. And enjoy a after party at the sand pool.

4164
02:23:15,280 --> 02:23:17,640
So all of this stuff is happening.

4165
02:23:17,760 --> 02:23:22,720
What doesn't seem to be happening is the improvement of the land and the park in.

4166
02:23:24,040 --> 02:23:25,360
OK, so I'm going to take you now.

4167
02:23:25,360 --> 02:23:28,640
This is all starting in 2017 in June.

4168
02:23:28,640 --> 02:23:30,360
Two more years of this.

4169
02:23:30,360 --> 02:23:31,240
Holy shit. Not quite.

4170
02:23:31,240 --> 02:23:31,960
No, no, no, not quite.

4171
02:23:31,960 --> 02:23:33,120
Now we're in Trump's America.

4172
02:23:33,120 --> 02:23:34,120
In June.

4173
02:23:35,320 --> 02:23:38,160
And that is happy for American exceptionalism is back.

4174
02:23:38,600 --> 02:23:40,960
He's found a voice in the White House.

4175
02:23:40,960 --> 02:23:44,840
I should also say that in some of these videos, he's he's saying all of this stuff

4176
02:23:44,840 --> 02:23:49,680
with it in front of a table and the table has four identical bald eagles

4177
02:23:49,960 --> 02:23:54,560
that are like on top of rocks with the American flag of America.

4178
02:23:54,560 --> 02:23:56,120
So this is real for him, I think.

4179
02:23:56,120 --> 02:23:57,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4180
02:23:57,360 --> 02:23:59,920
There's a lot he's been stewing on and thinking about.

4181
02:23:59,920 --> 02:24:01,600
And he's angry about a lot of stuff.

4182
02:24:01,600 --> 02:24:03,080
Yeah, yeah. He's got a place to chat.

4183
02:24:03,080 --> 02:24:06,040
And he bought acres of land where he can preach his truth.

4184
02:24:06,200 --> 02:24:06,880
Sure. Right.

4185
02:24:06,880 --> 02:24:09,640
Those four totems will summon the elder gods.

4186
02:24:11,560 --> 02:24:14,800
So the ghost of Falbus

4187
02:24:16,480 --> 02:24:18,320
has emerged from the sand pool.

4188
02:24:18,320 --> 02:24:19,200
Earthquake McGilliputty.

4189
02:24:19,200 --> 02:24:21,640
Falbus' ghost is loose, OK?

4190
02:24:21,640 --> 02:24:23,520
What do you want me to do about it?

4191
02:24:23,520 --> 02:24:27,080
God. You tell me how to get a governor's ghost.

4192
02:24:27,400 --> 02:24:30,640
I'm not saying he was right to keep those kids out.

4193
02:24:30,840 --> 02:24:33,880
I'm just saying he was also a public servant.

4194
02:24:33,880 --> 02:24:35,760
And that takes a tremendous amount of sacrifice.

4195
02:24:35,760 --> 02:24:37,880
He had responsibility to his voters.

4196
02:24:37,880 --> 02:24:41,200
You try to carry the weight of knowing the one true name of God. OK?

4197
02:24:43,360 --> 02:24:46,320
Sipping right over into craziness.

4198
02:24:46,320 --> 02:24:47,400
This guy.

4199
02:24:48,200 --> 02:24:50,080
All right. It's June 2018.

4200
02:24:50,080 --> 02:24:52,600
The videos are starting to trickle down. Less rants.

4201
02:24:52,600 --> 02:24:56,440
He in June, he posts a video that's all home movies of himself scored to a song

4202
02:24:56,440 --> 02:24:59,080
that he himself sings called Follow Your Heart.

4203
02:25:00,040 --> 02:25:01,880
Do you have it? I don't have it.

4204
02:25:01,880 --> 02:25:04,600
He's turned in. He's turned inward, man.

4205
02:25:05,480 --> 02:25:08,040
All this. Everything's scored by songs that he himself is singing,

4206
02:25:08,040 --> 02:25:09,200
including the Carol Channing song.

4207
02:25:09,200 --> 02:25:12,840
There is a theory about alien civilizations where they that civilizations

4208
02:25:12,840 --> 02:25:15,120
will become so advanced that that's why we don't hear from them,

4209
02:25:15,120 --> 02:25:18,000
because they will turn inward and become self obsessed.

4210
02:25:18,360 --> 02:25:22,440
So maybe David Hare has reached that point of his media journey,

4211
02:25:22,440 --> 02:25:24,920
where he's just he's not interested in anymore.

4212
02:25:25,160 --> 02:25:26,680
It's in the puppets. Yeah. Yeah.

4213
02:25:26,680 --> 02:25:28,240
In the bullshit he's surrounding.

4214
02:25:28,240 --> 02:25:30,680
He's like, yeah, building a little universe of mirrors.

4215
02:25:30,680 --> 02:25:33,400
We don't get it. So he's like, this is for me.

4216
02:25:33,400 --> 02:25:36,200
He thought, I have a content now. People are going to get it.

4217
02:25:36,440 --> 02:25:39,720
Yeah. But the two Facebook commenters revolted.

4218
02:25:40,040 --> 02:25:42,160
I can't find solace anywhere.

4219
02:25:42,160 --> 02:25:44,880
Another thing that starts happening around this time is that he stops

4220
02:25:44,880 --> 02:25:47,160
paying rent on the property entirely.

4221
02:25:48,360 --> 02:25:50,720
It's May 2018. He stops paying rent.

4222
02:25:51,720 --> 02:25:56,440
He's specifically leasing the hotel from whoever was owning the hotel,

4223
02:25:56,440 --> 02:26:00,240
turned it into like a motorcycle themed hotel called the Hub for a little while.

4224
02:26:01,200 --> 02:26:02,200
And he stops paying rent.

4225
02:26:02,200 --> 02:26:05,040
And this is also a problem because he's also living at the hotel.

4226
02:26:05,320 --> 02:26:07,240
Oh, my God. He lives in the hotel.

4227
02:26:07,240 --> 02:26:08,840
He's living in the hotel.

4228
02:26:08,840 --> 02:26:10,040
The unroomed room.

4229
02:26:10,040 --> 02:26:14,160
And also, he's also selling like come stay here.

4230
02:26:14,160 --> 02:26:15,800
He's like booking the rooms.

4231
02:26:15,800 --> 02:26:17,160
I think it's great.

4232
02:26:17,160 --> 02:26:19,240
It's working for me. I've been living here for several months.

4233
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:20,760
It's awesome.

4234
02:26:20,760 --> 02:26:24,680
Would I live in it if it's taking my room service plates away?

4235
02:26:24,880 --> 02:26:27,680
It's like his equivalent of Belushi, because of my shout out, our mom.

4236
02:26:29,880 --> 02:26:31,720
The final years.

4237
02:26:31,720 --> 02:26:35,760
So the documentary shows footage at the very end of like

4238
02:26:35,760 --> 02:26:40,400
motorcycle Mad Max looking people, and it doesn't explain why.

4239
02:26:41,320 --> 02:26:44,760
Oh, and it's presented in a way of like, but things maybe things could work out

4240
02:26:44,760 --> 02:26:46,120
for Dog Branch after all.

4241
02:26:46,120 --> 02:26:48,840
Cut to a bunch of scary people riding motorcycles.

4242
02:26:48,840 --> 02:26:50,200
We like it here.

4243
02:26:50,760 --> 02:26:53,040
Fine for us down in dog patch.

4244
02:26:53,040 --> 02:26:54,520
As long as we enforce the laws.

4245
02:26:54,520 --> 02:26:56,280
We're going to sharpen our knives on leather.

4246
02:26:58,040 --> 02:27:01,120
Fire shots from yards away.

4247
02:27:02,360 --> 02:27:04,280
I drink out after skull.

4248
02:27:07,360 --> 02:27:09,080
I drink my Kickapoo Joy Juice.

4249
02:27:09,080 --> 02:27:11,160
I'll show you Kickapoo Juice.

4250
02:27:11,160 --> 02:27:12,560
It was a Mountain Dew competitor.

4251
02:27:12,560 --> 02:27:13,720
I think it's better.

4252
02:27:13,720 --> 02:27:14,240
I was trying to.

4253
02:27:14,240 --> 02:27:16,680
Those motorcycle people just tore apart David Heron ate him.

4254
02:27:17,120 --> 02:27:17,960
That's what happened.

4255
02:27:17,960 --> 02:27:18,560
That's why we haven't heard.

4256
02:27:18,560 --> 02:27:19,440
Well, maybe.

4257
02:27:19,440 --> 02:27:21,000
Wait a minute, guys.

4258
02:27:21,000 --> 02:27:21,880
Because here.

4259
02:27:23,080 --> 02:27:24,520
Do you want to hear about Hubble hair?

4260
02:27:24,520 --> 02:27:26,640
Is that what happens?

4261
02:27:26,640 --> 02:27:29,240
He's quartered by motorcycles.

4262
02:27:29,240 --> 02:27:32,840
OK, in August 2018, he gets an eviction notice.

4263
02:27:32,840 --> 02:27:37,200
He has 10 days to vacate the premises or to like start paying rent or something.

4264
02:27:37,720 --> 02:27:39,080
And he does the noble thing.

4265
02:27:39,080 --> 02:27:41,440
He leaves in the middle of the night.

4266
02:27:41,440 --> 02:27:43,800
He just bail bail bail all gone.

4267
02:27:44,040 --> 02:27:45,520
He just takes off walks away.

4268
02:27:45,520 --> 02:27:46,680
And he was not.

4269
02:27:46,680 --> 02:27:49,760
But then he so they're like, oh, god damn it.

4270
02:27:49,760 --> 02:27:51,320
And it's still owned by everything.

4271
02:27:51,320 --> 02:27:52,080
He's just leasing.

4272
02:27:52,080 --> 02:27:54,200
Everything's still owned by the dog bowl guy.

4273
02:27:54,200 --> 02:27:56,760
Right. The dog bowl guy who was like, I believe in this maverick.

4274
02:27:57,360 --> 02:27:58,360
He's going to turn it around.

4275
02:27:58,360 --> 02:28:00,440
He's going to make it Heritage USA to the news.

4276
02:28:00,440 --> 02:28:01,520
Who interviewed him about this?

4277
02:28:01,520 --> 02:28:03,560
Like he came in with a good business plan.

4278
02:28:03,560 --> 02:28:04,920
He's like, I know good business plans.

4279
02:28:04,920 --> 02:28:06,840
OK, have you seen the inventor of the body?

4280
02:28:06,840 --> 02:28:08,800
He showed me various puppets.

4281
02:28:09,480 --> 02:28:10,800
Yeah, these puppets, these puppets.

4282
02:28:10,800 --> 02:28:11,440
They were incredible.

4283
02:28:11,440 --> 02:28:12,720
He had a very dense mythology.

4284
02:28:12,720 --> 02:28:14,560
He said he was going to color correct the videos.

4285
02:28:16,520 --> 02:28:18,320
I trust it sounds like a little process.

4286
02:28:18,320 --> 02:28:20,320
I don't know about video. He's working on it.

4287
02:28:20,320 --> 02:28:22,360
I mean, look, you've seen his videos.

4288
02:28:22,360 --> 02:28:25,440
He also talking to me, yelled at me.

4289
02:28:25,440 --> 02:28:26,960
But he's doing the videos.

4290
02:28:26,960 --> 02:28:28,120
That's who he's yelling at.

4291
02:28:28,120 --> 02:28:29,840
OK, fuck your balls.

4292
02:28:29,840 --> 02:28:33,320
OK, you walk around here with your judging eyes.

4293
02:28:33,880 --> 02:28:35,920
He's walking around abandoned dog

4294
02:28:35,920 --> 02:28:38,640
patch with one of the dog bowls eating ice cream out of it.

4295
02:28:39,440 --> 02:28:40,240
Wonder out there.

4296
02:28:40,240 --> 02:28:42,480
Wonder how everything's going with the hair.

4297
02:28:42,480 --> 02:28:44,000
You done with the hair drying yet?

4298
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:46,720
No, nobody gets my bag.

4299
02:28:47,280 --> 02:28:49,120
I got my back three months.

4300
02:28:49,120 --> 02:28:50,280
You'll see it.

4301
02:28:50,280 --> 02:28:55,480
He also constantly concludes points with and we're doing this as we speak.

4302
02:28:55,720 --> 02:28:57,680
This is happening as we speak.

4303
02:28:57,680 --> 02:29:01,640
Also, I missed a quote where he said, look about the hotel pricing,

4304
02:29:01,640 --> 02:29:03,600
how they're pricing the rooms, even though they haven't been remodeled.

4305
02:29:03,600 --> 02:29:05,680
Look, we aren't doing anything abnormal.

4306
02:29:05,680 --> 02:29:06,760
There's no bait and switch.

4307
02:29:06,760 --> 02:29:09,440
There's no means it is a great thing to yell.

4308
02:29:09,440 --> 02:29:11,880
So someone convinces me immediately.

4309
02:29:11,880 --> 02:29:14,520
There is. If you're yelling at the switch.

4310
02:29:14,960 --> 02:29:18,200
Did he ever like start talking to the puppet in the like the back of the room

4311
02:29:18,200 --> 02:29:20,600
ever like did he start having a conversation with Foxworthy?

4312
02:29:20,960 --> 02:29:21,840
What do I do?

4313
02:29:21,840 --> 02:29:26,800
Foxworthy, you want to follow your heart?

4314
02:29:26,800 --> 02:29:29,080
Of course, I leave right now.

4315
02:29:30,040 --> 02:29:31,200
It's four in the morning.

4316
02:29:31,200 --> 02:29:33,720
It's only one. All right.

4317
02:29:33,720 --> 02:29:36,880
Take me, if you say so, Foxworthy, we're a family.

4318
02:29:37,160 --> 02:29:39,720
I'm your son and you need to see the pile of puppets in the

4319
02:29:40,480 --> 02:29:43,080
passenger seat of the old civic.

4320
02:29:43,080 --> 02:29:46,880
Go take us to a place where we can all marry each other and be free.

4321
02:29:47,200 --> 02:29:49,280
So has this guy been heard from since or is he?

4322
02:29:49,520 --> 02:29:52,320
He came back the next day to try to get his car.

4323
02:29:52,520 --> 02:29:56,720
But it wasn't a car had been locked up and taken into the convention center

4324
02:29:56,720 --> 02:29:59,280
of the hotel. So it's a convention center.

4325
02:29:59,280 --> 02:30:01,120
Or no, this is a different.

4326
02:30:01,120 --> 02:30:03,880
This is the hub convention center. OK.

4327
02:30:03,880 --> 02:30:06,920
Since then, I'm not sure about lately, but at least for a few months,

4328
02:30:06,920 --> 02:30:09,400
he was not heard from disappeared, went off the.

4329
02:30:09,520 --> 02:30:11,480
And everybody just started suing him.

4330
02:30:12,920 --> 02:30:17,400
And and this leads to a point that I think is what you ran into where

4331
02:30:18,280 --> 02:30:20,800
OK, a mother and a daughter on a vacay.

4332
02:30:20,800 --> 02:30:22,120
They're like, we're going to do a mother daughter trip.

4333
02:30:22,120 --> 02:30:23,800
You know, where I used to go is this place dog patch.

4334
02:30:23,800 --> 02:30:26,320
And I hear it's open again in the hotels open and I booked the room

4335
02:30:26,320 --> 02:30:28,920
and we're going to go. They even they took my money already.

4336
02:30:28,920 --> 02:30:30,560
So everything must be fine.

4337
02:30:30,560 --> 02:30:33,920
And it's and they get lost because, as you said, it's hard to find the area.

4338
02:30:34,840 --> 02:30:37,640
It's way off country roads like the old highway at this point.

4339
02:30:37,640 --> 02:30:40,440
I don't know. But like, I would imagine it's like it was like a two lane.

4340
02:30:40,760 --> 02:30:41,600
That's what I remember.

4341
02:30:41,600 --> 02:30:42,280
It was little.

4342
02:30:42,280 --> 02:30:45,800
And we're still on the sign. Do we know they put up a they put up

4343
02:30:45,800 --> 02:30:47,960
a heritage USA sign with the with the hub?

4344
02:30:47,960 --> 02:30:50,560
Oh, so Hubble Air is on the side.

4345
02:30:50,560 --> 02:30:53,440
But it says historic dog patch, historic dog patch.

4346
02:30:53,440 --> 02:30:54,560
I would go to historic.

4347
02:30:54,560 --> 02:30:57,600
I say this was like meticulously restored. Sure.

4348
02:30:57,600 --> 02:30:59,560
Yeah, I would go. They will do it.

4349
02:30:59,560 --> 02:31:01,040
I'm looking for this property.

4350
02:31:01,040 --> 02:31:03,240
I would go in a rough road. Sandy Pool.

4351
02:31:03,840 --> 02:31:06,360
I don't care. I would like to see a bunch of sand.

4352
02:31:06,520 --> 02:31:07,840
So that kind of sounds fun.

4353
02:31:07,840 --> 02:31:10,880
But now we got we also have to now do the right.

4354
02:31:10,880 --> 02:31:14,200
The old heritage US, the Jim Baker Heritage USA. Oh, yeah.

4355
02:31:14,360 --> 02:31:18,040
Featuring the water slide that Jerry Falwell in a full suit went down.

4356
02:31:18,680 --> 02:31:21,320
Oh, my God. Wow.

4357
02:31:22,520 --> 02:31:23,800
We wait really?

4358
02:31:23,800 --> 02:31:25,880
Yeah, true. Oh, my God.

4359
02:31:25,880 --> 02:31:27,360
Oh, my God.

4360
02:31:27,360 --> 02:31:27,840
Let's just do it.

4361
02:31:27,840 --> 02:31:32,120
A few years before Jerry Falwell described Jim Baker as like the most vile man

4362
02:31:32,640 --> 02:31:33,160
to the earth.

4363
02:31:33,160 --> 02:31:34,560
Coming from Jerry Falwell.

4364
02:31:34,560 --> 02:31:36,600
I'll go down your slide, but you're still a piece of shit.

4365
02:31:36,640 --> 02:31:39,760
Let's just roll this episode into the Jim Baker one.

4366
02:31:39,760 --> 02:31:41,240
You want to start doing it? No research?

4367
02:31:41,240 --> 02:31:42,200
I know. Yeah, we are now.

4368
02:31:42,200 --> 02:31:44,960
I knew this was going to dance on Hard Rock Part.

4369
02:31:45,080 --> 02:31:48,600
When you stumble upon a world of multiple owners, of scandals,

4370
02:31:48,600 --> 02:31:51,520
of lawsuits, of American exceptionalism,

4371
02:31:51,520 --> 02:31:53,200
yeah, Kickapoo, Joy Juice.

4372
02:31:53,200 --> 02:31:54,760
Oh, my gosh. There is so much stuff.

4373
02:31:54,760 --> 02:31:59,200
If I could say a happy ending, the nice thing is that the dog bowl guy still owns it.

4374
02:31:59,360 --> 02:32:02,600
And what happened to this mother and daughter is like so they they're calling.

4375
02:32:02,600 --> 02:32:03,720
It's late. They don't.

4376
02:32:03,720 --> 02:32:05,560
They get so lost, they don't arrive until 11 p.m.

4377
02:32:05,560 --> 02:32:06,440
And they're trying to call the place.

4378
02:32:06,440 --> 02:32:08,480
Like, how do we get there? No one picks up.

4379
02:32:08,640 --> 02:32:11,680
They arrive in the dark and then some they flag down.

4380
02:32:12,000 --> 02:32:16,200
They flagged down a passing vehicle and the driver says, Oh, Heritage USA.

4381
02:32:16,400 --> 02:32:18,480
They were evicted earlier this week.

4382
02:32:19,600 --> 02:32:20,600
They weren't paying the water.

4383
02:32:20,600 --> 02:32:22,640
There's no water. There's no electricity.

4384
02:32:22,640 --> 02:32:24,960
This mother and daughter on a trip are stranded.

4385
02:32:24,960 --> 02:32:26,960
Essentially, this is very fire festival.

4386
02:32:26,960 --> 02:32:31,440
But then they they somehow like the dog bowl guy

4387
02:32:31,440 --> 02:32:33,120
finds out about it and says, you know what?

4388
02:32:33,120 --> 02:32:36,400
I will take you on a tour of the property and I'll show you all those places.

4389
02:32:36,400 --> 02:32:38,240
You had these nice memories.

4390
02:32:38,240 --> 02:32:42,400
He cancelled a vacation in order to take time to show them other.

4391
02:32:42,520 --> 02:32:45,080
Yeah. And how restored was the place at this point?

4392
02:32:45,080 --> 02:32:48,880
Like, was he just like, oh, these are where squatters used to take a dump.

4393
02:32:49,320 --> 02:32:52,080
You know, it was just like

4394
02:32:52,080 --> 02:32:54,960
we had a man living here for several months.

4395
02:32:54,960 --> 02:32:56,440
Yeah, there was a cult.

4396
02:32:56,440 --> 02:32:58,280
This was their base of operations for some.

4397
02:32:58,280 --> 02:33:00,320
All the trout out of the pond.

4398
02:33:00,360 --> 02:33:04,080
That was ninety seven trout with their bare hands.

4399
02:33:04,080 --> 02:33:05,680
They swallowed them without cooking them.

4400
02:33:05,680 --> 02:33:08,720
You imagine coming out here, seeing people eat trout with their bare hands.

4401
02:33:09,720 --> 02:33:11,400
It happened. This is last week.

4402
02:33:11,400 --> 02:33:14,800
Just a reminder, folks, most banks, credit card companies, PayPal.

4403
02:33:14,800 --> 02:33:17,480
You could just reverse a charge in our modern world.

4404
02:33:17,480 --> 02:33:19,880
You can just say cancel that charge, please.

4405
02:33:19,880 --> 02:33:23,080
Yeah, because it's kind of like our guy here, right?

4406
02:33:23,080 --> 02:33:26,040
Like, well, sorry, here's the park.

4407
02:33:26,480 --> 02:33:28,960
And this is the ice cream guy being like,

4408
02:33:28,960 --> 02:33:31,880
I'm going to take you on a tour of this derelict property.

4409
02:33:31,960 --> 02:33:34,800
Yeah, that is probably like a although that is kind of sweet, though.

4410
02:33:34,920 --> 02:33:37,560
I think I'm trying to see.

4411
02:33:37,600 --> 02:33:39,400
Well, but there's nobody to give the money back.

4412
02:33:39,400 --> 02:33:42,880
That makes him a very poignant kind of noble character in the story.

4413
02:33:42,920 --> 02:33:46,880
Yes, I like the dog bowl guy and I like the ATV 17 year old.

4414
02:33:48,240 --> 02:33:51,680
The other person, I just like the, you know, give them their money back.

4415
02:33:51,680 --> 02:33:54,400
Like I think and there's Facebook pages now are flooded.

4416
02:33:54,640 --> 02:33:55,920
Now he's good. Now there's a mess.

4417
02:33:55,920 --> 02:33:58,720
Now people are saying I so I just eat that money, I guess.

4418
02:33:58,720 --> 02:34:00,800
So he's just out there. We don't know where he is.

4419
02:34:00,960 --> 02:34:02,320
I don't know.

4420
02:34:02,320 --> 02:34:05,400
So I don't know how much of what we just said you heard due to editing.

4421
02:34:05,400 --> 02:34:07,760
But colorful tales were told.

4422
02:34:08,000 --> 02:34:11,160
I had no I truly can't believe how much

4423
02:34:12,360 --> 02:34:14,360
fell out of this pinata.

4424
02:34:14,360 --> 02:34:17,240
You guys, I feel like I've received a gift.

4425
02:34:18,040 --> 02:34:19,040
Fantastic.

4426
02:34:19,040 --> 02:34:24,000
Because I never knew as you said, a bunch of this nice like the surprises of information.

4427
02:34:24,120 --> 02:34:26,200
It was nice to teach you all of this.

4428
02:34:27,200 --> 02:34:30,760
But also but to hear your nice memories and about your dual toys.

4429
02:34:32,280 --> 02:34:37,160
Hey, look, what I'm trying to say is Chris, can we survive podcasts?

4430
02:34:37,160 --> 02:34:39,080
Right. Thank you so much for being here.

4431
02:34:39,080 --> 02:34:41,240
You're doing one of my favorite topics.

4432
02:34:41,240 --> 02:34:42,120
Thank you, guys.

4433
02:34:42,120 --> 02:34:44,560
Even if it's the topic that kills us.

4434
02:34:44,560 --> 02:34:47,000
No, I think I put fear into your head.

4435
02:34:47,240 --> 02:34:48,080
You're fine.

4436
02:34:48,080 --> 02:34:52,320
Yes. I think it's the producers that they talk about on how do those get made or like anything

4437
02:34:52,320 --> 02:34:54,440
like anybody shitting on anybody. That's a lot of.

4438
02:34:55,000 --> 02:34:56,280
We're just having fun.

4439
02:34:56,280 --> 02:35:01,320
I think these people are these are genuinely tragic figures that are very vivid, very vivid.

4440
02:35:01,320 --> 02:35:06,600
The local news had some pretty harsh words like when I was looking at some pretty harsh words.

4441
02:35:06,600 --> 02:35:07,120
Yes.

4442
02:35:07,120 --> 02:35:08,680
Heritage like failed.

4443
02:35:08,680 --> 02:35:09,520
Yeah.

4444
02:35:09,520 --> 02:35:10,080
Yeah.

4445
02:35:10,080 --> 02:35:10,960
Crooked.

4446
02:35:10,960 --> 02:35:17,800
And he left town just hearing that laid out in a and hearing the guy say like he didn't fix anything.

4447
02:35:17,800 --> 02:35:19,760
It's worse than it was before.

4448
02:35:19,760 --> 02:35:20,360
That's so sad.

4449
02:35:20,360 --> 02:35:21,160
It's really crazy.

4450
02:35:21,160 --> 02:35:22,000
He's out there right now.

4451
02:35:22,040 --> 02:35:27,120
But he gave us these YouTube videos that are and I really do recommend people just load,

4452
02:35:27,120 --> 02:35:29,040
watch all of the Heritage USA.

4453
02:35:29,040 --> 02:35:32,840
I will. Yeah, I'm going to put that one down in Dogpatch song on my iPhone.

4454
02:35:33,840 --> 02:35:36,080
I'm going to full size of three minutes on.

4455
02:35:36,080 --> 02:35:37,960
I know I wanted to hear all of it.

4456
02:35:37,960 --> 02:35:39,840
I want in dog.

4457
02:35:39,840 --> 02:35:42,160
I would like a Fox worthy puppet.

4458
02:35:42,160 --> 02:35:44,160
Yeah. If I could get that, we could maybe get.

4459
02:35:44,160 --> 02:35:46,080
Let's free and vigor at this guy's career.

4460
02:35:46,080 --> 02:35:48,040
I mean, maybe we'll do some up.

4461
02:35:48,040 --> 02:35:50,280
I don't know. I enjoyed Christmas is here.

4462
02:35:50,280 --> 02:35:51,560
The musical from 1990.

4463
02:35:51,560 --> 02:35:53,080
Really?

4464
02:35:53,080 --> 02:35:53,880
Yes.

4465
02:35:53,880 --> 02:35:57,720
No, you said earlier there was no video of it.

4466
02:35:57,720 --> 02:35:59,680
So I'm like, how did you know there's a video?

4467
02:35:59,680 --> 02:36:00,600
There is a video of it.

4468
02:36:00,600 --> 02:36:01,120
There's a video.

4469
02:36:01,120 --> 02:36:02,360
This is the music.

4470
02:36:02,360 --> 02:36:05,640
And I watched as much as he put up on his Vimeo of country.

4471
02:36:06,640 --> 02:36:07,680
Fun time Jubilee.

4472
02:36:07,680 --> 02:36:09,280
I don't remember. Fun time Jubilee.

4473
02:36:09,280 --> 02:36:10,160
Look, there's all.

4474
02:36:10,160 --> 02:36:10,560
Yes, there's.

4475
02:36:10,560 --> 02:36:15,120
Let me just slip this real quick in is that we did a patron episode about McGruff's music career.

4476
02:36:15,120 --> 02:36:18,800
But I found the guy who wrote all the songs and I'm still trying to get in touch with him.

4477
02:36:18,840 --> 02:36:20,960
But I found his song about 9-eleven.

4478
02:36:22,960 --> 02:36:25,960
So so everybody different types of play.

4479
02:36:25,960 --> 02:36:28,080
They think I played for Jason.

4480
02:36:28,080 --> 02:36:33,400
So you're saying to show that saying everyone has a variety of things they do with their career.

4481
02:36:33,400 --> 02:36:35,480
Yes. And we and we're just criticizing.

4482
02:36:35,480 --> 02:36:39,160
I think I think even he could agree that his theme park

4483
02:36:39,160 --> 02:36:42,480
owning career was not the most we are being so nice to him right now.

4484
02:36:42,480 --> 02:36:43,040
Very nice.

4485
02:36:43,040 --> 02:36:45,800
And we are handling him with kid gloves.

4486
02:36:45,800 --> 02:36:47,520
Guys, I'm scared.

4487
02:36:48,160 --> 02:36:50,920
This guy is a guy that's probably in a Motel 6 somewhere.

4488
02:36:50,920 --> 02:36:52,960
He's peeking out the blinds.

4489
02:36:52,960 --> 02:36:54,200
He's waiting.

4490
02:36:54,200 --> 02:36:55,760
He's waiting for the sirens.

4491
02:36:55,760 --> 02:36:58,000
He's waiting. He's like he's on the phone.

4492
02:36:59,040 --> 02:37:03,560
He's got a Wi-Fi access at a coffee shop and he's like, what can I do?

4493
02:37:03,560 --> 02:37:10,960
Well, yeah, he's hiding in a safe house in a plot reminiscent of your film coming out.

4494
02:37:10,960 --> 02:37:12,920
But he was shot and he's on an icy river.

4495
02:37:13,920 --> 02:37:16,280
Drag to safety by a deaf child.

4496
02:37:16,280 --> 02:37:18,840
But where is Foxworthy?

4497
02:37:18,840 --> 02:37:20,920
Yes, he's with a deaf child somewhere.

4498
02:37:20,920 --> 02:37:22,840
It's like hiding in a family barn.

4499
02:37:22,840 --> 02:37:24,240
Yes.

4500
02:37:24,240 --> 02:37:27,760
So if you want to know what happens, see the parts you lose.

4501
02:37:27,760 --> 02:37:29,480
What else would you like to alert people to?

4502
02:37:29,480 --> 02:37:30,280
You got a lot going on.

4503
02:37:30,280 --> 02:37:34,920
Oh, yeah. Boy, I got a comic book coming out on September 4th called Everything,

4504
02:37:34,920 --> 02:37:40,080
which is about a very shady, weird, maybe evil department store in 1980.

4505
02:37:40,120 --> 02:37:41,760
Oh, great.

4506
02:37:41,760 --> 02:37:44,920
You are living the dream and writing Dr. Doom coming up.

4507
02:37:44,920 --> 02:37:48,960
Yes, Dr. Doom comes out on October 9th.

4508
02:37:49,080 --> 02:37:50,920
Wow. Nice.

4509
02:37:50,920 --> 02:37:53,480
Yes, I've gotten a lot of a lot of

4510
02:37:54,720 --> 02:37:58,760
fans of Dr. Doom have have opinions about.

4511
02:37:59,520 --> 02:38:00,640
Would you like to Dr.

4512
02:38:00,640 --> 02:38:04,760
Do you like to record some hour long videos where you address all of these issues?

4513
02:38:04,760 --> 02:38:07,320
Look, you're working on it.

4514
02:38:07,720 --> 02:38:09,160
I didn't create him. OK.

4515
02:38:09,200 --> 02:38:11,000
There's a lot of mythology out there.

4516
02:38:11,000 --> 02:38:14,640
I inherited some of the problems from the previous owners created in the 60s.

4517
02:38:14,640 --> 02:38:17,200
For Christ's sake, I'm doing what I've been issue.

4518
02:38:17,200 --> 02:38:18,280
He's appeared in.

4519
02:38:18,280 --> 02:38:19,480
I am where I am working on.

4520
02:38:19,480 --> 02:38:21,480
This is being worked on as we speak.

4521
02:38:21,480 --> 02:38:23,760
He's never had the Infinity Gauntlet. OK, I know that.

4522
02:38:26,240 --> 02:38:28,200
That comes out on October 9th.

4523
02:38:28,200 --> 02:38:29,280
I'm excited about that.

4524
02:38:29,280 --> 02:38:31,600
They're letting me get away with stuff so far.

4525
02:38:31,600 --> 02:38:33,640
The mask. I'm bringing the mask back.

4526
02:38:33,640 --> 02:38:35,160
Yeah. Very excited.

4527
02:38:35,160 --> 02:38:38,600
Then wait. And the with the title of it, I pledge allegiance to the mask.

4528
02:38:38,600 --> 02:38:40,760
Oh, my God. So president.

4529
02:38:40,760 --> 02:38:42,360
You the mask like that.

4530
02:38:42,360 --> 02:38:45,200
A lot of click baity headlines about how it's political.

4531
02:38:45,760 --> 02:38:49,040
It's more just like anarchic and nihilistic.

4532
02:38:49,680 --> 02:38:52,640
Which is part me, part kind of the character. Yeah.

4533
02:38:52,640 --> 02:38:54,840
So that comes out October 16th.

4534
02:38:54,840 --> 02:38:57,160
And she's that's it.

4535
02:38:57,160 --> 02:38:58,840
And the movie October 4th. Oh, man.

4536
02:38:58,840 --> 02:39:00,600
So it'll be a good October. Yeah.

4537
02:39:00,600 --> 02:39:02,080
Yeah. Yeah. This is a nice.

4538
02:39:02,080 --> 02:39:04,240
Well, you have such a good comic on so much to announce.

4539
02:39:04,280 --> 02:39:05,280
Yeah, that was fun.

4540
02:39:05,280 --> 02:39:08,360
And everything will be going on for at least a little while.

4541
02:39:08,360 --> 02:39:09,200
And I'll catch fire.

4542
02:39:09,200 --> 02:39:10,240
We're talking it's fair now.

4543
02:39:10,240 --> 02:39:12,320
You can buy it. You can Netflix.

4544
02:39:12,320 --> 02:39:13,840
Yeah. You watch it for free on Netflix.

4545
02:39:13,840 --> 02:39:14,760
Oh, it's not for free.

4546
02:39:14,760 --> 02:39:16,280
Everyone thinks Netflix is free.

4547
02:39:16,280 --> 02:39:17,480
I think so. Yeah.

4548
02:39:17,480 --> 02:39:18,440
Just forget you've been.

4549
02:39:18,440 --> 02:39:19,200
Netflix. Right.

4550
02:39:19,200 --> 02:39:21,760
It's like, well, you paid $15 a month.

4551
02:39:22,080 --> 02:39:24,360
It's on Netflix. It's on Amazon.

4552
02:39:24,640 --> 02:39:26,120
I think it's still on on demand.

4553
02:39:26,120 --> 02:39:29,880
I know it's on AMC Premiere, which is their streaming thing.

4554
02:39:29,880 --> 02:39:32,040
Yeah. It's been in so many lists lately.

4555
02:39:32,040 --> 02:39:33,600
People still talk about it, which is nice.

4556
02:39:33,600 --> 02:39:35,400
Yeah. Yeah. It'll keep happening.

4557
02:39:35,400 --> 02:39:36,160
People.

4558
02:39:36,160 --> 02:39:39,040
The fact that people are still talking about it is really nice because it

4559
02:39:40,040 --> 02:39:44,240
was it was the the dog patch USA of TV shows when it first premiered.

4560
02:39:44,600 --> 02:39:45,720
No one knew about it.

4561
02:39:45,720 --> 02:39:46,480
It was very difficult.

4562
02:39:46,480 --> 02:39:48,040
You had to go off the interstate

4563
02:39:48,040 --> 02:39:52,200
onto a two lane highway and wait until you hit mile marker or whatever.

4564
02:39:52,280 --> 02:39:54,000
It's not the turn on at 10 p.m.

4565
02:39:54,000 --> 02:39:56,440
Walking Dead is the magic kingdom and you're right.

4566
02:39:56,440 --> 02:39:57,920
You're you're off the beaten path.

4567
02:39:57,920 --> 02:40:00,000
But people are exactly such fond memory.

4568
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:01,440
We were a thousand acres.

4569
02:40:01,440 --> 02:40:03,040
Catch fire.

4570
02:40:03,680 --> 02:40:07,920
And if they get people went too far, they ended up at turn Washington spies.

4571
02:40:08,080 --> 02:40:11,200
That's right. Turn Washington spies.

4572
02:40:11,200 --> 02:40:12,560
Yeah. Yeah.

4573
02:40:12,560 --> 02:40:16,080
That would Joe McMillan, if we had done a fifth season, he should have

4574
02:40:16,600 --> 02:40:20,320
invested in Dogpatch because it would have been right as a great opportunity.

4575
02:40:20,560 --> 02:40:23,360
Right as it closed over ninety five, ninety six.

4576
02:40:23,440 --> 02:40:25,760
Yeah. Selling that to everybody else.

4577
02:40:25,760 --> 02:40:28,160
This is a steal.

4578
02:40:28,160 --> 02:40:30,480
Possibilities. Yandwich.

4579
02:40:30,880 --> 02:40:35,400
If you start pitching the story of Dogpatch, please at least give us some vanity titles.

4580
02:40:35,400 --> 02:40:36,880
Right. Give us some associates.

4581
02:40:36,880 --> 02:40:38,880
But I think you got to do like the weird Charlie Coppin version

4582
02:40:38,880 --> 02:40:43,200
where like Lil Abner shows up at abandoned Dogpatch and it's like really.

4583
02:40:43,200 --> 02:40:44,400
Oh, yeah. That's good.

4584
02:40:44,400 --> 02:40:45,920
That's essentially fucked up. Yeah.

4585
02:40:45,920 --> 02:40:46,720
Yeah. Right.

4586
02:40:46,720 --> 02:40:47,760
It's already a take.

4587
02:40:47,760 --> 02:40:49,760
Incredible shoots. Fox worthy.

4588
02:40:49,760 --> 02:40:52,240
Yeah, he's hunting David Hare.

4589
02:40:52,240 --> 02:40:54,000
David Hare is being hunted by Lil Abner.

4590
02:40:54,000 --> 02:40:55,040
That's what he believes.

4591
02:40:55,040 --> 02:40:56,240
Probably what's going on in his head.

4592
02:40:56,240 --> 02:40:57,520
Yes, by the legacy.

4593
02:40:58,480 --> 02:41:03,040
And if I may, Jason Sheridan could play Available Jones.

4594
02:41:03,040 --> 02:41:05,040
Hey. Hey.

4595
02:41:05,040 --> 02:41:05,840
Available Jones.

4596
02:41:05,840 --> 02:41:07,840
Try to just do the spinoff of that right away.

4597
02:41:07,840 --> 02:41:08,880
OK. Yeah.

4598
02:41:08,880 --> 02:41:10,880
You know, people think this is an original project.

4599
02:41:10,880 --> 02:41:12,880
It's actually a spinoff of Lil Abner.

4600
02:41:12,880 --> 02:41:14,880
A comic that ran for 40 years.

4601
02:41:14,880 --> 02:41:16,080
Oh, good. Good. Good.

4602
02:41:16,080 --> 02:41:18,080
As long as it's IP. Wonderful.

4603
02:41:18,080 --> 02:41:19,120
Original IP. Great.

4604
02:41:19,120 --> 02:41:19,920
Yes. Yeah. All right.

4605
02:41:19,920 --> 02:41:20,720
Greenlit. All right.

4606
02:41:20,720 --> 02:41:21,680
Sixty million.

4607
02:41:21,680 --> 02:41:22,720
Yeah. Lil Abner. Great.

4608
02:41:22,720 --> 02:41:23,920
Here you go. Have fun.

4609
02:41:23,920 --> 02:41:25,920
Today's stubby K. Jason Sheridan.

4610
02:41:27,680 --> 02:41:28,320
I'll take it.

4611
02:41:28,320 --> 02:41:30,320
There's a real stubby K in that, Jason.

4612
02:41:30,320 --> 02:41:32,080
OK. Well, that was a lot of fun.

4613
02:41:32,080 --> 02:41:33,360
Hey, we don't have to plug all this stuff.

4614
02:41:33,360 --> 02:41:34,080
You know what's up.

4615
02:41:34,080 --> 02:41:35,840
I like that people might be listening to this

4616
02:41:35,840 --> 02:41:37,360
and then showing up at our live show.

4617
02:41:37,360 --> 02:41:38,720
We're like halfway through this.

4618
02:41:38,720 --> 02:41:39,200
Oh my gosh.

4619
02:41:39,200 --> 02:41:39,920
I didn't even thought about it.

4620
02:41:39,920 --> 02:41:40,960
What a thing for people to.

4621
02:41:40,960 --> 02:41:41,440
All right.

4622
02:41:41,440 --> 02:41:43,280
If we see you at the live show in Anaheim.

4623
02:41:43,280 --> 02:41:43,760
Tomorrow.

4624
02:41:43,760 --> 02:41:44,240
We're excited.

4625
02:41:44,240 --> 02:41:44,560
Wait.

4626
02:41:44,560 --> 02:41:46,080
You guys are doing a live show in Anaheim tomorrow?

4627
02:41:46,080 --> 02:41:46,800
Yeah, I am.

4628
02:41:46,800 --> 02:41:47,680
As we record.

4629
02:41:47,680 --> 02:41:48,160
Yes.

4630
02:41:48,160 --> 02:41:48,400
Yeah.

4631
02:41:48,400 --> 02:41:50,240
If you're listening to this on the day it comes out.

4632
02:41:50,240 --> 02:41:50,880
Yeah.

4633
02:41:50,880 --> 02:41:54,560
Down by the D23 Expo.

4634
02:41:54,560 --> 02:41:55,200
Tomorrow.

4635
02:41:55,200 --> 02:41:59,120
I was once sent by when we worked at Disney together.

4636
02:41:59,120 --> 02:42:01,680
I saw where it's very grounded company.

4637
02:42:01,680 --> 02:42:02,480
Yes.

4638
02:42:02,480 --> 02:42:02,880
Yes.

4639
02:42:02,880 --> 02:42:03,360
Yeah.

4640
02:42:04,480 --> 02:42:05,120
That's awesome.

4641
02:42:05,680 --> 02:42:06,160
Yeah.

4642
02:42:06,160 --> 02:42:06,400
Yeah.

4643
02:42:06,400 --> 02:42:06,880
We're so excited.

4644
02:42:06,880 --> 02:42:07,760
We're going to have fun.

4645
02:42:07,760 --> 02:42:08,720
And yeah.

4646
02:42:09,840 --> 02:42:10,400
We'll see you.

4647
02:42:11,120 --> 02:42:12,720
Ask us any dog patch questions.

4648
02:42:12,720 --> 02:42:13,920
I know you might have a few.

4649
02:42:14,720 --> 02:42:16,080
And yeah.

4650
02:42:16,080 --> 02:42:16,480
What else?

4651
02:42:16,480 --> 02:42:17,760
Say go to the Patreon.

4652
02:42:17,760 --> 02:42:18,560
Go to the second gate.

4653
02:42:18,560 --> 02:42:19,520
Lots of fun coming up there.

4654
02:42:19,520 --> 02:42:21,120
As always, follow us on Twitter.

4655
02:42:21,120 --> 02:42:21,600
Follow.

4656
02:42:22,320 --> 02:42:22,880
Or I don't know.

4657
02:42:22,880 --> 02:42:25,760
Maybe don't follow the ATV guy.

4658
02:42:25,760 --> 02:42:26,560
Don't bother him.

4659
02:42:26,560 --> 02:42:28,080
Don't bother the ATV kid.

4660
02:42:28,080 --> 02:42:28,560
Don't bother him.

4661
02:42:28,560 --> 02:42:29,280
He's been through it.

4662
02:42:29,280 --> 02:42:30,400
Yeah.

4663
02:42:30,400 --> 02:42:32,080
Seems like a good guy.

4664
02:42:32,080 --> 02:42:32,800
But don't go to Twitter.

4665
02:42:32,800 --> 02:42:35,840
He's positive in a world of darkness.

4666
02:42:35,840 --> 02:42:36,960
Leave him alone.

4667
02:42:36,960 --> 02:42:40,480
Or let him make the first move.

4668
02:42:40,480 --> 02:42:42,240
Let him decide when he's ready to be in the public eye.

4669
02:42:42,240 --> 02:42:43,440
Something the outcap never learned.

4670
02:42:43,440 --> 02:42:43,940
Yeah.

4671
02:42:44,720 --> 02:42:45,220
Sorry.

4672
02:42:45,220 --> 02:42:45,840
Oh, man.

4673
02:42:45,840 --> 02:42:46,340
He's sorry.

4674
02:42:47,280 --> 02:42:47,780
Sorry.

4675
02:42:47,780 --> 02:42:48,320
Oh, no.

4676
02:42:48,320 --> 02:42:50,480
We're also just shitting on the outcap estate too.

4677
02:42:50,480 --> 02:42:51,200
His son's alive.

4678
02:42:51,200 --> 02:42:51,360
That's fine.

4679
02:42:51,360 --> 02:42:52,480
The guy that got the PR job.

4680
02:42:52,480 --> 02:42:55,680
And we were like, I'm sure that was just a handout.

4681
02:42:55,680 --> 02:42:57,440
Just crying silently in his car.

4682
02:42:58,240 --> 02:42:59,680
My dad was a genius.

4683
02:43:00,720 --> 02:43:01,600
There is so much.

4684
02:43:01,600 --> 02:43:04,880
This is the most litigant ever.

4685
02:43:04,880 --> 02:43:08,160
We'll have the podcast right lawyer go through it

4686
02:43:08,160 --> 02:43:09,280
before it comes out.

4687
02:43:09,280 --> 02:43:09,760
Yes.

4688
02:43:09,760 --> 02:43:10,320
Yeah.

4689
02:43:10,320 --> 02:43:11,520
When we keep on retainer.

4690
02:43:11,520 --> 02:43:12,720
All of the Patreon money.

4691
02:43:12,720 --> 02:43:14,800
Like 95% of it goes to the lawyer.

4692
02:43:14,800 --> 02:43:17,200
You wouldn't believe the shit we say in most episodes.

4693
02:43:17,200 --> 02:43:17,840
No, that's true.

4694
02:43:17,840 --> 02:43:18,480
We leave on the game floor.

4695
02:43:18,480 --> 02:43:19,120
There's crazy stuff.

4696
02:43:19,120 --> 02:43:20,080
We'll tell you all of it.

4697
02:43:20,080 --> 02:43:21,920
And we'll see you at the Anaheim show.

4698
02:43:22,880 --> 02:43:24,240
Hey, thanks for listening.

4699
02:43:24,240 --> 02:43:24,880
Holy shit.

4700
02:43:24,880 --> 02:43:25,680
That was something.

4701
02:43:25,680 --> 02:43:26,160
OK.

4702
02:43:26,160 --> 02:43:26,640
Bye.

4703
02:43:26,640 --> 02:43:27,360
Double whammy.

4704
02:43:27,360 --> 02:43:28,480
Double whammy.

4705
02:43:28,480 --> 02:43:29,680
Have a heck of a day.

4706
02:43:30,640 --> 02:43:31,600
Hogwash.

4707
02:43:31,600 --> 02:43:32,320
Forever.

4708
02:43:34,000 --> 02:43:34,960
Dog.
